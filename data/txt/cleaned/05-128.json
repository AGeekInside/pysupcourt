STRAIN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. STRAIN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nWe are here about a bankruptcy priority, and\nbankruptcy priorities must be clearly granted by\nstatute or they are not granted at all. That's the\nfirst principle of bankruptcy law that this Court has\nlaid down, that equal priority, that equal distribution\nis the first principle, and every priority is a\ndeviation from that first principle, and therefore,\nthey must be clearly set out in the statute. This\nCourt has been very clear over and over on those\nbedrock principles.\nApplying them here, Zurich must demonstrate\nthat its workers' comp insurance policy receivables are\nclearly included within the statutory phrase of\n507(a)(4), contributions to an employee benefit plan\narising from services rendered within 180 days. Judge\nNiemeyer -- Judge Niemeyer followed those principles,\nthose bedrock principles of this Court. The two\nconcurring opinions below did not follow nor even\nmention those principles, and that led them to err, we\n-- we submit.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Can I get you to step\nback just -- the presumption that you began with. What\n-- what's your strongest authority for that? The first\nthing you cite in your brief is a dissenting opinion of\ntwo justices.\nMR. STRAIN: The strongest authority for\nthat, Your Honor, is the opinion in Kothe, K-o-t-h-e, a\n1930 opinion, followed by Nathanson, followed by\nEmbassy Restaurant, and it is the --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Nathanson is the --\nyou cite the dissenting opinion for this proposition?\nMR. STRAIN: No. It is -- Nathanson -- the\n-- the citation, the page citation, is to the majority\n-- is to the majority opinion. The principle is laid\nout in the majority opinion, Mr. Chief Justice. And\nNathanson majority opinion relied on Kothe, and\nNathanson majority opinion was followed in 1959 by this\nCourt in Embassy Restaurants, and followed in 1968 by\nthis Court in Joint Industries Board also dealing with\nbankruptcy priorities. That is the bedrock principles\nin the -- of the majority decisions of -- of this case\n-- of this Court.\nAnd what we have here, Your Honor and members\nof the Court, is that a -- an insurance policy -- what\nwe're talking about here is an insurance policy, and\nthe statutory language refers to an employee benefit\nplan. We don't even have a plan here. We have a\npolicy.\nThere's a citation in the Zurich brief at\npage 20 to this Court's opinion in Pegram v. Herdrich,\nwhich I think drives that point home. It is an\nincomplete citation. The omitted language from the\nZurich brief is as follows. From page --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Where -- where is the\nunomitted language? What -- what page of the brief are\nyou quoting from?\nMR. STRAIN: It's on page 20, Your Honor, of\nZurich.\nCiting to page 223 from this Court's opinion\nin Pegram, the omitted language, which comes in the\nmiddle of the quotation given at page 20, is as\nfollows. Thus, when employers contract with an HMO to\nprovide benefits to employees subject to ERISA, the\nprovisions of documents that set up the HMO are not, as\nsuch, an ERISA plan.\nNow, that is what our case is, an insurance\npolicy that incorporates a duty to pay benefits subject\nto workers' comp laws of the different States. So even\nunder the citation in -- the full citation in Pegram,\nit is seriously questionable whether this insurance\npolicy is a plan at all. The statute requires an\nemployee benefit plan. The -- this Court requires that\nit be clear from the statute that this insurance policy\nis itself a plan.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Now, ERISA -- ERISA makes it\nvery clear that -- that a plan to pay insurance for\nemployee benefits, whether it's disability or\nretirement or whatever else, is an employee benefit\nplan and -- and explicitly excludes workmen's comp\nbecause otherwise it would fall within that definition\nof an employee benefit plan.\nMR. STRAIN: I believe that is -- is correct,\nJustice Scalia.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I know that's a different\nstatute. I'm not saying that the -- that the\ndefinitions of that statute have to apply here, but the\ndefinitions of that statute at least demonstrate that\nit is a permissible use of the -- of -- of the term\nemployee benefit plan.\nMR. STRAIN: I disagree with you, Justice\nScalia --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: All right. Tell me why.\nMR. STRAIN: -- to this -- to this extent.\nThe definition of employee benefit plan under ERISA is\nin two parts: a section (a), which is a -- which is a\nlisting; and a section (b), which is incorporation of\nprovisions of the Taft-Hartley law. And it's under the\nsection (b), the incorporation of provisions of the\nTaft-Hartley law, that workers' compensation comes in.\nAnd, of course it is then excluded by -- by ERISA.\nBut a -- the ERISA definition does not\ndemonstrate that a -- an insurance policy is a plan.\nThis Court has dealt with the issue under ERISA of\nwhether everything scheduled in ERISA is a plan or not.\nIn the Massachusetts v. Morash decision, this Court\ndetermined whether a vacation -- unpaid vacation policy\nwas a plan under the definition of ERISA, and this\nCourt held that it was not. So it is clear from this\nCourt's precedent that whether or not something is\nlisted in ERISA, even if it applied -- in that case,\nERISA applied; in this case it does not -- even if it\napplied, would not qualify as a plan.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Would it -- would it if\nthe employer were self-insured? Can you be self-\ninsured for workers' comp?\nMR. STRAIN: The employer can be self-insured\nfor workers' --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Would that be a plan then?\nMR. STRAIN: I think it would not, Your\nHonor, because the self-insurance for workers' comp, as\nI understand them, what they normally do is, just as\nthe Court referred to in that omitted section of the\nPegram opinion, is it simply is -- is an agreement that\nit will provide the necessary wherewithal and bonding\nto pay the benefits as specified, as they may change\nfrom time to time in a State statute. There is none of\nthe other things, as I understand it, that the Court\ndealt with in Pegram which would make it a plan that\nare present in either a workers' compensation insurance\npolicy or a self-insurance program, as is permitted and\n--\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So it would be an employee\nbenefit program, but not a plan.\nMR. STRAIN: It would be, Your Honor, or in\nthe case of our case, an employee benefit policy.\nAnd I would like to pick up on that, if I\nmay, because it is not --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Before you -- before you go\non, could you satisfy a curiosity of mine? Maybe Mr.\nVerrilli should be the one I should ask this, but you\nmust have your -- your version of it. How do you\ndecide whether an insurance premium is for work that\nwas done within the last 180 days? How -- how do you\ncalculate it, whether that characteristic of the -- of\nthe statute is complied with?\nMR. STRAIN: Your Honor, I don't know that\nthere is any good way to do that, and I think that's\none of the anomalies in trying to superimpose an\ninsurance policy under the rubric of an employee\nbenefit plan.\nNow, premiums -- premiums, of course, there\nis a -- there is a mechanism --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, if it said premiums due\nwithin the last 180 days, I could understand it --\nMR. STRAIN: And there is a mechanism in the\npolicy to determine the payment of premiums.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But isn't -- doesn't the\nmechanism take into account the number of employees who\nare on the rolls at any given time?\nMR. STRAIN: I believe it does, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, if that's the case,\nthen -- then doesn't the premium that you're supposed\nto pay depend in -- in -- on the number of employees\nwithin the last 180 days, which in turn depends on\ntheir working in the last 180 days?\nMR. STRAIN: It is not my understanding -- and I\nmay be mistaken because this policy was not placed in\nthe record by Zurich. It is not my understanding that\nthat is how the policy premium calculations are made,\nYour Honor. Now --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, how -- maybe you just\ndon't know the answer.\nMR. STRAIN: -- certainly, Justice Souter,\nyou may be right, but we've checked the proof of claim\nfiled by Zurich which started this off, and they did\nnot attach the workers' compensation insurance policy\nto it. So it is not in the record, and I simply don't\nknow --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So that's -- that's really\nnot an issue for us.\nMR. STRAIN: Well, I -- I will not say that\nit's not an issue, Your Honor. It is -- it is an issue\n--\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, if you want to make it\nan issue, you'd have to get the -- the predicate in the\nrecord to do it, and -- and we just don't have that.\nMR. STRAIN: Well --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: We -- we couldn't resolve\nthat.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Or else establish that\nthere's no conceivable way that 180 days makes any\nsense.\nMR. STRAIN: And -- and I -- I think that, as\n-- as I hope may blend the answers to both questions.\nI think that --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Consider us together, yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: We're together on this.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. STRAIN: I -- I think that is -- I think\nthat is where we -- where we are. We have a policy\nthat was not placed in the record by the applicant for\nthis priority. We have our general knowledge of what\nworkers' comp insurance policies are. We have a\nstatutory requirement which reads, a calculation with\n180 days, which I suggest is an anomaly when we compare\nit to the statutory language.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Is there anything in the\nstatute which says how promptly the premiums have to be\npaid as it -- to -- to make it analogous, say, to\nwithholding where you might have to pay every quarter\non -- by a certain day? Does -- does the statute\nregulate when and how promptly the premiums must be\npaid, or is that just all comprehended in the terms of\nthe policy agreement?\nMR. STRAIN: Well -- well, certainly the\npriority statute does not because the priority statute\ndoesn't --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: No. I meant the State\nworkmen's comp law.\nMR. STRAIN: The State workers' -- workers'\ncomp law. Your Honor, I -- I don't know the answer. I\nknow that the State laws -- I know that the State laws\nvary, and we have 10 different workers' comp laws that\nallude to or mention workers' comp insurance policies\npresent just in this case. So it may be that those\nstatutes might provide some of the basis for an\nexplanation, but I simply don't know the answer to\nthat. I did want to --\nJUSTICE BREYER: If you have an employer who\nsays, I promise to give $200 a month per worker to a\nfund, which money will go to pay their health costs\nwhen they're sick, that's plainly covered.\nMR. STRAIN: Yes, it is, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And now suppose it's exactly\nthe same, but instead of his paying $200 a month, he\npays $200 to an insurance company in return for a\npromise that they'll pay precisely the same amount to\nthe employee if he gets sick. In your view, that's not\ncovered.\nMR. STRAIN: In our view -- in our view, Your\nHonor -- I -- if -- if I may, I think that the\nhypothetical you pose is not quite our case.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Of course. It's not meant\nto be.\nMR. STRAIN: It -- it --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I want to know how you are\ngoing to answer my hypothetical.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. STRAIN: Your Honor, I -- I think the --\nthe focus of the answer should be on whether it is an\nemployee benefit or not.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I'm not -- I'm asking you --\nMR. STRAIN: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- to answer my hypothetical\nplease. If in fact -- you didn't want me to repeat it?\nMR. STRAIN: No, no. No, I --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Then what is the answer?\nMR. STRAIN: -- I understand it, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: In your view, is my\nhypothetical covered or not?\nMR. STRAIN: I -- I think it is not, Your\nHonor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: It is not.\nMR. STRAIN: I think --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And therefore, if we accept\nyour interpretation, then all those employers who,\ninstead of contributing directly to health funds,\ninstead buy insurance policies to do the same thing,\nwill discover they do not have the advantage of the\nfifth priority.\nMR. STRAIN: All right. And now I see -- now\nI see, Justice Breyer, I did misunderstand --\nmisunderstand the facts. Those facts clearly are\ncovered. They're -- they're covered under --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Now, if they are covered --\nif they are covered, as I thought, then what is the\ndifference whether the employer buys a policy whereby\nthe insurance companies pays for their health benefit\nwhen they're sick or pays for their accident benefit\nwhen they have an accident at work?\nMR. STRAIN: Your Honor, I think the\ndifference are -- are several. Number one is what the\nemployer is doing here is insuring itself against a\nclaim that would otherwise be against the insurer.\nThat was not in your hypothetical, Your Honor. That\nmakes what we have here a policy for an employer\nbenefit. It is not an employee benefit.\nNow, the -- the employer is the insured.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The -- the correlative\nhypothetical would be a plan such as Justice Breyer\ndescribes in which the employer has contracted to pay\nhis employees $200 a month for when they're sick, and\nthat's a contractual obligation of his, and then he\nbuys insurance to cover that contractual obligation.\nMR. STRAIN: And --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You say that would be this\ncase.\nMR. STRAIN: That would be this case, Your\nHonor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And you say that wouldn't be\ncovered.\nMR. STRAIN: And that would not be covered,\nand that would not be covered in great part because it\nis an employer benefit, employer choice, employer\nbenefit. And what we have in this case --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, that's -- that's a\nbetter way to put it. If -- if that's right, then what\nyou're saying, as I understand it, is in those cases\nwhere an employer goes to an insurance company, they\ngive a contractual promise to pay the employee when he\ngets sick in return for a premium by the employer --\nand it's a health benefit or a vacation benefit, the\nmost typical thing -- you're saying all those -- all\nthose -- there's no fifth priority. They don't --\ncan't take advantage of that.\nMR. STRAIN: No. Your Honor, what -- what\nI'm saying is and what we have here, if what you're\ndescribing, if I understand it correctly, is a normal\nfringe benefit. That is, an employer agrees to take\nout a -- to contribute to a pension fund for the\nbenefit of the employees. That is clearly covered.\nThat was the kind of thing dealt with in Embassy\nRestaurant and the Joint Industries Board that (a)(4)\nwas intended to supplant or overrule.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And why did --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And that's clearly\ncovered.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- why did you answer\nJustice Scalia's question as you did? That is also an\nemployee benefit, that is, vacation, sickness.\nMR. STRAIN: Your Honor, I answered that\nbecause, as Justice Scalia changed the hypothetical, it\nwas not an employee benefit. It was the employer\ninsuring itself, buying an annuity or, like we have\nhere, insuring itself, so it -- so it could make the\npayments.\nWhat we have here, Your Honor, is a situation\nwhere, as it is admitted in the record, the employees\ndon't benefit at all. As Zurich has admitted in this\nrecord at page 17, the employees are in the same\nposition whether there is insurance or no insurance.\nIn fact, the irony here is that if Zurich prevails, not\nonly do the employees not benefit, they are harmed\nbecause there are in the (a)(4) -- the (a)(4) priority\nclaimants are a total of 1.6 million, including the\n400,000 of Zurich. All the others are health and\nwelfare funds such as Justice Breyer was -- was posing.\nZurich is not.\nBut what happens -- and there's not enough\nmoney to pay everyone. What happens is if the Zurich\nInsurance Company receivable gets an equal priority\nwith the health and welfare funds, then there is a\ndilution of the money going for the employees' health\nand welfare and pension, a 25 percent, in this case,\ndilution of that money because the employer chose to\ninsure itself for its liability, potential liability,\nto the employees. The employer benefited from that\ninsurance. In some States, it would be required to\nhave the insurance. In most States, it has the option\nof having insurance or not.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Would the same thing happen\nunder multi-employer plans? Would not the employees\ntypically receive the benefits even if their employer\ndid not make the contributions that it was required to\nmake?\nMR. STRAIN: It would -- they would typically\n-- in a multi-employer plan, as many of our priority\nclaimants are here, because the money is spread, the\nemployees still get some money. But if we consider the\ngreater whole, the money, the available res, the\navailable pot, to play those -- pay those employees is\ndiminished. So --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought there's also,\nisn't there, the Pension Benefit -- even if there's no\nmoney in the till for the plan, isn't there a\nGovernment fund so that the worker would receive the\nbenefit in any event if -- I don't see the distinction\nthat you're making based on whether the worker would\nget a benefit whether or not the employer made the\ncontribution.\nMR. STRAIN: Well, Your Honor, there\ncertainly is -- there certainly are -- in most States\nat least, there certainly are funds that step in if a\nworkers' comp insurer or an employer does not make --\nis not available to pay an award to a workers' comp\ninjured -- a worker who was injured on the job.\nOn the other -- on the other hand, Your\nHonor, whether such funds exist to step in and supplant\nthe payments not made to -- in the ordinary health and\nwelfare and pension context, I think not, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I recognize there are\ndifferent schemes. The only one I'm familiar with is\nmy former State. But did I understand from your answer\nthat in some or many of these States, the employer is\nfree not to have insurance? He can be self-funded?\nMR. STRAIN: Yes. Yes, that's correct, Your\nHonor, in -- in --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And is there any\nrequirement that there be an actual fund in place or is\nit just a general liability?\nMR. STRAIN: Well, there is -- there is -- it\nis a -- a traditional self-insurance with the overlay.\nThat is, there -- there must -- there must be a\nshowing of the wherewithal, but with the additional\noverlay, in all or virtually every State which permits\nthis, of the requirement of a bond. And that's --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: A bond.\nMR. STRAIN: -- which is an interesting point\nbecause if Zurich prevails, we have the -- the camel's\nnose is under the tent because in all the self-\ninsurance contexts, the bond issuer will have an\nequivalent claim to Zurich. Under their broad\nreasoning or broad interpretation of the statute that\nshould be considered narrowly -- under the broad\ninterpretation they want, that camel's nose would be\nunder the tent, and the bond issuer would have an\nequivalent claim to Zurich on its policy.\nTo extend that a little further, what Zurich\ndid here -- was an insurance company -- it required\nletters of credit of Howard Delivery, the debtor, to\nissue its policies. It drew down those letters of\ncredit $1.1 million. F&M Bank, the letter of credit\nissuer, of course sought security from the debtor, but\nnot enough. As is commonly the situation once the\nliquidation is finished, there wasn't enough security.\nSo F&M, which had facilitated Zurich's workers'\ncompensation insurance by its letters -- letters of\ncredit, would have an equivalent claim to Zurich as\nwell. So more and more of the camel is going under the\ntent. This is a very broad interpretation with major\nimplications that they seek and it is completely\ninappropriate under the bedrock principles of\napproaches to priorities under bankruptcy law.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, if there were letters\nof credit, why is Zurich injured? Because the letters\nof credit were not large enough to cover the premium\nliability?\nMR. STRAIN: They -- they were not, Your\nHonor. They were not.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: See, what I don't understand --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Strain --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Strain, you -- you\nmentioned --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- in -- in your brief,\nyou seem to put considerable stress on something that I\nhaven't heard you say one word about so far, and that\nis that these -- workers' compensation is State-\nmandated. They're not negotiated or even employer-\ndetermined benefits. They are whatever the law\nprescribes. And you haven't -- haven't mentioned that,\nso I'm wondering where that fits into your picture.\nMR. STRAIN: It -- I haven't mentioned it.\nI'll take this opportunity to mention it, Justice\nGinsburg, because it is a very important point.\nWe know that in the statute -- (a)(4) we're\ntalking about -- section (a)(3) -- these are numberings\nbefore 2005 amendment to the act. The language stayed\nthe same. The numbers were -- are different.\nBut there are two that work together. The\n(a)(3) priority for wages for the employees and the --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Where does (a)(3) appear?\nThere -- there was that discussion in your brief, and\nI'm darned if I could find (a)(3).\nMR. STRAIN: Section (a)(3), Your Honor.\nI'll refer you, if I may, to the brief of amicus at\npage 11, and that's why I mentioned, Your Honor, that\nthere is a new numbering because the numbering in the\namicus brief is using the 2005 numbering in the revised\nstatute. And what is listed there as (a)(4) is the\nwages priority, and at the next page, (a)(5) is the\npriority that we're talking about as -- as (a)(4).\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it would have been\nnice to have it in your brief --\nMR. STRAIN: I agree.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- and numbered -- numbered\n3 instead of 4. That would have helped a lot.\nMR. STRAIN: I -- I certainly recognize that,\nYour Honor.\nThe -- the provision of (a)(3) and (a)(4) --\nthey work in tandem to protect the workers. They share\na cap. The more a worker benefits from a wage\npriority, the less the worker benefits from the -- from\nthe employee benefit plan priority. And so they work\ntogether; they work in tandem, which gives meaning to\n(a)(4) under many of the canons of construction that --\nthat we're familiar with.\nIt would not work -- it's an anomaly that an\ninsurance company receivable would share the cap with\nthe wages priority. That is simply an anomaly. And\nwhen we look to the legislative history, it is\nabsolutely clear, Your Honor, that the fact of the\njudicial -- the statutory mandate for workers'\ncompensation insurance is very important because what\nis spoken about, as Judge Niemeyer pointed out in his\ndissent below -- what is spoken about in the\nlegislative history over and over again is a wage\nsubstitute or a wage surrogate that employers do not\ngive -- will lower the wages but provide fringe\nbenefits. So the package remains the same. Now,\nthat's not a workers' compensation insurance policy,\nbut that is the wage surrogates that the Congress was\nlooking at.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Let -- let me, if I may, ask\nyou about other possible wage surrogates because what\nyou're saying now seems to me to mesh with the\nargument, another legislative history argument, to the\neffect that the -- the current provision was meant to\noverrule two prior cases of this Court. And the -- the\nquestion I have turns on the fact that the -- the\nlanguage is broader than what would merely have been\nnecessary to overrule those cases.\nSo my question is if the broader language\ndoes not cover the premiums that we're concerned with\nhere, what other items dealing with -- with wage\nsubstitutes would it pick up, would it include?\nMR. STRAIN: Well, Your Honor, I -- I would\nanswer from -- in part from the legislative history of\nsome of the things discussed were joint apprentices and\ntraining programs, by way of example, as new forms of\nfringe benefits that some of the witnesses wished to\nsee to ensure would be covered. I think that sort of\nthing could be covered under -- under this language as\nwell.\nWe know from the legislative history -- we\nknow from the legislative history that there was\nabsolutely no intention to incorporate the definition\nof ERISA, and we know from this Court's teaching in the\ndecision in United States v. C&F Fabrication just 10\nyears ago that it is absolutely inappropriate to\nincorporate into the bankruptcy statute an ERISA\ndefinition where Congress does not provide. That's an\nabsolute square holding of this Court that exactly\nshould lead to rejection of the effort by Zurich to\nincorporate -- to ask the Court to engraft onto this\nstatute a -- a definition from another statute.\nIf there are no questions at -- additional\nquestions at this time, I would like to reserve my\nremaining time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.\nStrain.\nMr. Verrilli.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD B. VERRILLI, JR.\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. VERRILLI: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nI think it's important to focus at the outset\non exactly what a workers' compensation plan provides.\nA workers' compensation plan provides health insurance\nthat pays for the medical costs of a workplace\naccident, disability insurance --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You're begging the question\nby calling it a plan. I mean, that -- that's -- that's\none of the issues here. Why don't you tell us what\nworkmen compensation laws require?\nMR. VERRILLI: Well, I'd be happy to go right\nto the question of whether it's a plan, Justice Scalia,\nbecause I think it's indisputably a plan under this --\nunder the dictionary definition, ordinary meaning of\nplan, this Court's interpretation of it in Pegram,\nunder ERISA, under the Department of Labor's\ninterpretation of it, and under plain common sense. A\nplan is an arrangement or program or scheme, as Pegram\nsaid, to -- established by an employer or an employee\norganization to secure the provision of benefits to an\nemployee through insurance or otherwise.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Verrilli, there's no\nemployer or employee, for that matter, who's doing the\nplanning. The planning is all done by the Government\n--\nMR. VERRILLI: See, I -- I --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- because what's covered\nis prescribed by law.\nMR. VERRILLI: I think there is a plan for\nthis reason, Justice Ginsburg. The -- what the law\nprescribes is that which the employer must provide to\nthe employees. But it's not a self-executing law.\nThe -- the employer has got to make arrangements to\nensure that the benefits are provided, and under the\nlaws of the vast majority of the States, the employer\nhas options for doing that. The employer can contract\nwith an insurance company to do it. The employer can\nself-insure to do it. And by the way, Justice Kennedy,\nthere are quite stringent requirements for fiscal\nsolvency and there is a surety bond that needs to be\nposted in order to -- in order to self-insure.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But the it is not\nnegotiable. We think of a health plan, a retirement\nplan. That doesn't have to be any set coverage. It's\nnegotiated or the employer, if it's not a collective\nbargaining situation, determines what the benefits will\nbe. Here, the law determines what the benefits will\nbe.\nMR. VERRILLI: I agree that that aspect of\nthe arrangement is not negotiated, but there is\nnonetheless an arrangement that secures and guarantees\nthe provisions of the benefits, and that's the plan.\nThere are steps that the employer has to take to secure\nthe provision of the benefits, here through the\npurchase of insurance, and that is the plan. The plan\nis the arrangement to secure the provision of benefits.\nCertainly they are --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So that if an\nemployer decides to -- because his employees have had a\ngood year, he's going to put in a new parking lot for\nthem -- he -- his plan is to have a contract with a\npaving company to pave the parking lot. Are the\npayments under that contract's contributions to an\nemployee benefit plan?\nMR. VERRILLI: I don't think the answer to\nthat question is yes, Mr. Chief Justice. I think the\nanswer is no. I mean, I suppose you could say that\nthose are -- that's a benefit provided to employees,\nbut --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It seems like the\nconsequence of your theory though --\nMR. VERRILLI: I don't think so. I think\nthere's a limiting principle here and I think the\nlimiting principle is to look to ERISA. ERISA has a\nset of -- it defines what employee benefits are for\nERISA purposes, and it's not -- and it's not these\nbenefits and similar things. It's an exhaustive list\nof benefits. The parking lot isn't on the list.\nSimilarly, a break room wouldn't be on the list. None\nof those things are on the list, and therefore, I think\nby reference to ERISA, one can relatively easily\nexclude those --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But -- but providing\nfor workers' compensation through insurance, rather\nthan through self-insurance, is also not on the list.\nMR. VERRILLI: Well, I think both of them are\non the list actually, Mr. Chief Justice, because both\nof those are programs or arrangements to secure the\nprovision of benefits, and one is through insurance and\nthe other through self-insurance. So I think they're\nplans in both instances.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What's your answer to the\n180 days question I answered -- I asked? You know,\nthe provision provides contributions. It doesn't say\njust contributions to an employee benefit plan. It\nsays contributions to an employee benefit plan arising\nfrom services rendered, and then it goes on to say, but\n-- but the services have to be within the last 180\ndays.\nMR. VERRILLI: Right.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: How do you square that with\n-- with the purchase of block insurance like this?\nMR. VERRILLI: Well, because the amounts that\nZurich is seeking in premiums are the amounts that were\ndue for providing coverage during the 180 days before\nHoward ceased operations, and the reason that arises\nfrom -- it seems to me there are two ways in which that\ncould arise from services rendered. It can arise from\nservices rendered to the employees in the following\nsense. Howard has the obligation to provide those\nbenefits by virtue of the fact that the employees are\nworking for it during that period of time. That's what\nJudge King said in his opinion in the Fourth Circuit,\nand that seems to me exactly right. Alternatively --\nalternatively, as other courts have suggested, the --\nthe services rendered --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But each of those insurance\npremiums that's paid by the employer doesn't just cover\nworkers who've worked for the last 180 days. Each premium\nis divided among all the workers who've been working\nthere for years. Some of the premiums are going to go\nto -- to allow the insurance company to pay in the\nfuture people who have been there for 20 years.\nMR. VERRILLI: Well --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, it just seems to me\nit's a square peg in a round hole. I -- I don't see\nhow you make sense out of that 180 --\nMR. VERRILLI: I appreciate that, Justice\nScalia, but I do think the -- the obligation on the\npart of the employer to keep paying the premiums\nduring that period arises from the fact that the\nemployees are continuing to work during that period.\nAnd what the -- and what the insurance company is\nseeking to recover is merely the cost of providing the\ninsurance during that period of 180 days which arises\n--\nJUSTICE SOUTER: If -- if they don't pay the\npremium with respect to the 180 days, if there's an\naccident during the 180 days, the insurance doesn't\ncover the accident.\nMR. VERRILLI: That's an important point,\nJustice Souter, and I would like to focus on that and I\n-- I hope correct something that the Petitioners said.\nWith respect -- it all depends on when the\ninsurance policy cancels. If there's nonpayment of\npremiums, then the insurance company has the right to\ncancel the policy, and there has -- there's a notice\nprovision, 10 days in some jurisdictions, up to 30 days\nin others. But they have a right to cancel the policy.\nIf an injury occurs before cancellation, that\ninjury is covered and it's covered for all time, even\nif the policy subsequently cancels.\nBut the key thing here, I think, the critical\npoint is that without the priority, the -- the\ninsurance company is going to look at the situation and\nsay, we have very little prospect of recovering if this\ncompany actually goes down the tubes and into\nbankruptcy as a general unsecured creditor. Therefore,\nwe need to get out of this situation fast. And they --\nat that point, they're going to cancel the policy.\nThere's going to be much more of a hair-trigger sense\nof the need to cancel policies. When they cancel\npolicies, the immediate consequence, of course, is that\nthe -- that the employees are no longer covered.\nAnd then, the -- it seems to me, the\nsecondary consequence, which is also quite important --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You really think that --\nthat they cut it that fine? They say, oh, yes, this\nguy is going to go into bankruptcy. We're pretty sure\nabout that, but don't worry. We'll have priority.\nMR. VERRILLI: It's absolutely --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I think as soon as they\nsmell bankruptcy, they're going to pull the plug\nanyway.\nMR. VERRILLI: That -- I -- I disagree with\nthat, Justice Scalia. I think in -- in the real common\npractice here, the amount that they can recover and the\namount that they think they have a prospect of\nrecovering is a very important determinant in their\ndecision on whether to hang in and how long to hang in\nuntil they get to the chapter 11 process where the\ndebtor can then husband its assets and can pay the\nworkers' compensation premiums as an administrative\nclaim. So I think it's a -- it's a significant\ndeterminant.\nWithout the priority, there's going to be a\nhair trigger, which means coverage is terminated\nsooner, and it's going to mean for many employers that\nthey're going to have to go out of business because you\ncan't operate without --\nJUSTICE BREYER: There -- there are two parts\nin my mind to this. The question is what is the\ndifference between a workmen's -- worker compensation\nand health benefits. I agree with you, so far\ntentatively, that that difference can't lie in the\nnature of the contract providing the benefit. Now, I\nknow they'll want to argue the contrary, but put that\nto the side.\nIf it doesn't depend on that, it depends on\nthe difference between workers' compensation and health\nbenefits. And you want to say there isn't enough of a\ndifference there, though they argued the mandate makes\na difference. Of course, you could mandate health\nbenefits too, and I don't think that would matter.\nBut if you're right, what about a -- a long-\nterm contract for bottled water for the workers?\nMR. VERRILLI: I think my answer would be the\nsame as to the Chief Justice that in some sense, I\nsuppose you could say it's an employee benefit; in some\nsense, I suppose you could say that there's a contract\nto provide it. But I think you can set the outer\nbounds here by reference to the employee benefits that\nERISA defines as employee benefits.\nBut in any event --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, actually -- this is --\nto me anyway, this is an important point because at\nsome point you have to draw the line between the things\nof a kind that workers might bargain for and things\nnot. Now, if that's where we're getting there, the\nhistory of workers' compensation may cut the other way.\nMR. VERRILLI: Well, I don't -- I don't think\nso, Justice Breyer --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Because? What's -- what's\nthe principle I'm going to use?\nMR. VERRILLI: Well, first, if I can make a\nprefatory point, that the bottled water example doesn't\ndistinguish the Petitioners' position from our\nposition. The Petitioners' position is that if it's a\n-- if it's a negotiated-for, bargained-for benefit,\nit's in. So I don't think that's a -- it provides a\nlimiting principle. And it seems to me, wherever the\nline is --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, sure, if they\nhave a contract, as part of their -- part of their\ncontract, they get the bottled water, that's -- that's\neasy to see why that's covered. But the -- the\nquestion is when it's not. It's just something that\nthe employer does in the course of his business that\nhas -- that benefits both his business and his workers.\nMR. VERRILLI: Right, but --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It has to be arising from\nservices rendered. I mean, it -- it really has to be\npart of the contract with the employer --\nMR. VERRILLI: Well, I -- I don't think\nthat's right. For example, in the -- in the case of\nmost voluntarily provided health insurance, the vast\nmajority of employees in this country -- it's not\nbargained for. It's something an employer provides\nunilaterally --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But there's one feature of\nthis that is -- does make it different, at least one,\nand that is this is a benefit to the employer in the\nway that the others are not. The employer -- there's a\ntradeoff in workers' compensation. It's not just I'm\ngoing to pay benefits when the person is injured, but\nI'm going to get off the hook for the tort liability\nthat I might otherwise have. And in the other cases of\nthe other benefits, there is no -- no such tradeoff.\nMR. VERRILLI: Well, the fact that there may\nbe a benefit to the employer doesn't make it any less\nof an employee benefit. The question is whether there\nis a plan that provides employee benefits, and the\ninsurance coverage provided by workers' compensation\nare clearly employee benefits. I also -- and -- and,\nof course, the with -- with respect to that tradeoff,\nthat's -- that tradeoff is an employee benefit too,\nJustice Ginsburg, because the -- the employee has no-\nfault liability, gets paid promptly rather than have to\nsue and wait years, doesn't lose his or her job as a\nresult of the injury or as a result of bringing the\nlawsuit. So I don't think you can make the judgment\nthat it's not an employee benefit plan on the basis of\nthat fact. And of course, voluntarily provided\nbenefits also benefit the employer by making it a more\nattractive place to work and -- and --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this question,\nMr. Verrilli?\nMR. VERRILLI: -- better morale.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Can I -- can I ask you --\nit goes back to the first point your opponent made.\nWhat is the purpose of granting the priority? It seems\nto me the purpose of the priority is to increase the\nlikelihood that the wage claims will be paid. And if\nyou -- if you win, it won't affect it one way or\nanother, as you acknowledge in your brief. But it\nseems to me the priority should serve the purpose of\nincreasing the likelihood that the benefits would\nactually flow to the employee benefit plan.\nMR. VERRILLI: I think there are four things\nI'd like to say in response to that, Justice Stevens.\nFirst, there isn't a textual hook for -- for\nthat being a determinant, and it -- and it --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, it talks about\ncontributions to an employee benefit plan which one\nwould not normally think of as paying insurance\npremiums.\nMR. VERRILLI: And the second thing -- well,\nI think to the contrary, Justice Stevens. I think in\nthe overwhelming majority of instances, the\ncontributions employers make to employee benefit plans\nis the payment of insurance premiums to secure the\nbenefits. Collectively bargained benefits provided by\nunion trusts are a small minority of the benefits that\nare provided to workers in this country.\nBut -- but going back to the specific\nquestion, of course, as Justice Alito's question\nearlier suggested, in a multi-employer pension plan\nsituation, the plan is obligated by law to provide all\nvested pension benefits whether or not the employee's\nemployer has defaulted on its payments into the fund.\nSo it's in exactly the same position as the insurance\ncompany is with respect to that set of benefits, and\ntherefore, the argument doesn't draw a distinction\nbetween the two.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Verrilli, what -- what\nis your response to Mr. Strain's assertion that if you\nget a priority, so should the secondary insurer, that\nis, the -- the bank that gave letters of credit?\nThey're just insuring -- that -- that's part of the\nplan too. They couldn't have gotten the insurance from\nyou unless they got the letters of -- of credit from\nthe bank, which is a kind of secondary insurance.\nAnd also in the case of self-insurance, which\nis something of a plan -- I -- I guess you'd call it a\nplan -- what about the -- the person who puts up the\nbond? That person is a kind of insurer, just as you\nare. Do all of these people now -- now get bumped up\nto the head of the line?\nMR. VERRILLI: The answer is no. The statute\nexpressly covers this. The last provision of section\n507 says no subrogation, and those would be subrogation\nsituations. So the statute just expressly covers it.\nThey aren't -- they don't get bumped up in the line,\nperiod. I don't think there's any dispute about that.\nIf I could, though, return to a -- a point\nthat --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Where -- where does that\nappear?\nMR. VERRILLI: I'm sorry. I can't direct you\nto where it is --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, because it's not in the\nbriefs --\nMR. VERRILLI: I'm sorry, Justice Scalia.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- just -- just as the\ncontract isn't before us.\nMR. VERRILLI: It should be in the briefs.\nIt's not, but that is what the last section of section 507\nsays, that those who are subrogated to the rights of\nsomeone with a priority don't get the priority. So\nthat's just taken care of by the statute.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But if the payment of the\npremiums doesn't increase the likelihood that the\nemployees will get the benefits, why should you get\npriority?\nMR. VERRILLI: It does increase the\nlikelihood, and it goes back to the example I was -- I\nwas discussing with Justice Souter earlier. And -- and\nwhat -- it will not affect employees who are injured\nbefore cancellation, but it will accelerate\ncancellation. And as a result of accelerating\ncancellation, employers who are injured after\ncancellation will not get the benefits. And so it will\n--\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: What -- what about the --\nthe example we discussed, payment of a bond premium if\nyou're self-insured?\nMR. VERRILLI: No. I think that -- I think,\nagain, that last section of 507 takes care of that.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: How do we know what you've\njust told us? Is that in the record? You're just\nassuring us what the content of the insurance contract\nis. Right? But we don't have the insurance contract.\nMR. VERRILLI: The insurance contract is not\nin the record. That's right, but the --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So we -- we have your\nassurance that that's what happens here.\nMR. VERRILLI: As a systematic matter -- it\nseems to me as a systematic matter, this is what\ninsurance companies will do. I don't think that's\ndependent actually, Justice Scalia, on -- on the\nparticular terms of this contract. I'm saying as a\nsystematic matter insurance companies --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it has to be that way?\nI could write a contract differently.\nMR. VERRILLI: Well -- well, sure, but the\ncontracts comply with State law. State law sets notice\nperiods for cancellation, 10 days minimum, up to 30\ndays. We've cited those in our briefs. And so in most\nStates and in many States here, within as few as 10\ndays after nonpayment, you can cancel.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's a --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Verrilli, before --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But I was -- can -- can I\n-- I still don't quite understand the answer to the\nbond premium question.\nMR. VERRILLI: Well, that -- there would be\nno priority there because that would be -- that would\nbe a subrogated claim, and the last section of section\nof -- the last provision of section 507 says if you're\nsubrogated to a --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: No. No, it wouldn't be\nsubrogated. The bond premium -- the bonding company\nsays we're entitled to priority.\nMR. VERRILLI: Well, I don't think --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And it files the claim\ndirectly with the bankruptcy.\nMR. VERRILLI: -- I don't think that would be\na claim for contribution to the plan, Your Honor, in\nthe same sense that we're talking about here. The --\nif I -- if I could --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You couldn't have the\nplan without the bond, just as here you wouldn't have a\nplan without the insurance policy. It's just a\ndifferent way of paying for the same thing.\nMR. VERRILLI: Well, I'm -- I think there's\nan order of -- there's another order of degree of\nremoval, and it would make it a harder question, I\nsuppose, as to whether there would be a -- whether\nthere would be a claim for priority in that context.\nBut I think, if I could, Mr. Chief Justice,\nI'd like to return to the question of narrow\nconstruction where we started the argument.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: May I detract you just for\na moment? On -- on a question of the statutory\nhistory, correct me if I'm wrong, but originally, 1934,\nthe kind of claim that you have would be a seventh\npriority claim. And then in '38, Congress said no\npriority at all covering workers' compensation. And\nthen when Congress restored a priority, it ratcheted it\nup to four or five, depending upon which version of the\nstatute we use. Is there any explanation why, when\nCongress originally assigned first a very low priority\nand then no priority, suddenly it gets up to be on a\npar with the fringe benefits?\nMR. VERRILLI: Yes. I think there are two\nsignificant points there, Justice Ginsburg, in terms of\nthe history. First, in 1934 what Congress said was\nthat workers' compensation could be a provable claim.\nIt then said it's -- it gets the -- the seventh\npriority, but the seventh priority was not a priority\nspecific to workers' compensation. It was a priority\nthat's -- it was a provision that said you get a\npriority if State law provides the priority. In 1938,\nwhat Congress did was wipe out that provision for all\nState law granted priorities, not for workers' comp in\nspecific. So it doesn't seem to me it was a specific\njudgment about workers' comp and its place in the\npriority system.\nAnd, of course, you didn't have the well-\ndeveloped system of employee benefit plans in the\n1930's that you have now. And what Congress did, when\nit enacted this provision in 1978, following closely\nafter ERISA, was to use language which is identical to\nERISA in providing a priority for employee benefit\nplans which, as ERISA on its face, I think, makes\nclear, would encompass workers' compensation plans.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Verrilli, your --\nyour friend's argument about the interrelation between\n(a)(3) and (a)(4) seems like a compelling one. What is\nyour answer to that?\nMR. VERRILLI: I think the complete\nexplanation for the relationship between (a)(3) and\n(a)(4) was that Congress was trying to expand the scope\nof the priority here without doing damage either to the\nwage priority above it, which -- and -- and there would\nhave been damage to the wage priority above it if wages\nwere simply redefined to include the broader set of\nemployee benefits -- or to the priorities below.\nCongress just took the aggregate amount. It seems to\nme just an elegant solution that protects the wage\npriority above, creates a new priority, and doesn't\ndisadvantage any of the -- any of the priority-holders\nbelow. And I really do think that's the complete\nexplanation for the relationship between the two. You\nreally can't infer anything more than that.\nBut if I could just address the so-called\nrule of narrow construction. Certainly there is a\nsentence or two in Nathanson and Embassy Restaurant,\nbut those were such clear cases of statutory\nconstruction that -- that the rule of narrow\nconstruction, I submit, played no role there.\nIn many, many more cases in which this Court\nhas interpreted the priority provisions of the act and\nthe code, the Court has not mentioned this idea that\nthere's a rule of narrow construction or that the\nprinciple of equality of distribution to creditors\nshould trump everything else. We've cited four in our\nbrief: Lewis, Shropshire, Ricketts, and SBA v.\nMcClellan, which by the way, expressly cut back on\nNathanson.\nBut there are many more cases. There's a\nwhole line of tax priority cases culminating in the\nReorganized CF&I Fabricators decision in which the\ncourts adjudicated the question of -- of the scope of\nthe tax priority. Most of the time, they find\npriority. Occasionally they find no priority. But in\nnone of those cases is this so-called rule of\nconstruction ever mentioned or the supposed primacy of\nthe rule of equality of -- of the principle of equality\nof distribution ever mentioned.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, much of your\ncase hinges on the assumption that Congress\nincorporated the ERISA definition into the bankruptcy\ncode. What -- what is your strongest evidence for\nthat?\nMR. VERRILLI: Well, I think the fact that\nthe phrase is identical to the phrase that appears in\nERISA, employee benefit plan, is significant. ERISA\nwas one of the most substantial legislative\naccomplishments of that decade of the 1970s. And so I\nthink the mere fact that the exact same language\nappears in both places, importantly, however, with --\nwithout the limiting qualification in section 507(a)(4)\nthat exists in ERISA itself with respect to workers'\ncompensation plans.\nI also think that if the Court does look at\nthe legislative history, what -- what one learns from\nthe legislative history is that when the bill was\noriginally introduced to -- to create this priority, it\ncreated a priority for -- proposed to create a priority\nfor pensions, insurance, and similar employee benefit\nplans. The union representatives came in to Congress\nand said that's too narrow. We need something\nsignificantly broader to ensure that the full range of\nemployee benefits is protected and granted this\npriority. What the union representatives all urged\nCongress to do was to adopt the ERISA definition\nwholesale.\nNow, we don't have anything in the -- in the\nHouse or Senate report saying that's what we did. In\nother words, we intended to adopted ERISA wholesale,\nbut we do know that is what, in fact, they did. They\nused exactly the language from ERISA and they moved it\ninto the priority in section 507.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: To follow up on the earlier\nquestion of the Chief Justice, by whom do you\nunderstand the services have to be rendered within the\nmeaning of the act?\nMR. VERRILLI: Well, I think that the -- I\nthink that the statute could be read --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Does it refer to the -- the\nbankrupt's employees or your employees?\nMR. VERRILLI: It could be the -- it could be\neither, it seems to me, Justice Stevens.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: You think it could be\neither.\nMR. VERRILLI: And I -- but I don't think it\nmatters in this case because you get to the same answer\neither way. If it's the services rendered of the\nemployees, the -- the claim is for contributions to --\nfor the cost of providing insurance to those employees\nduring the 180 days. If it's the services rendered at\nZurich it's the provision of services during the 180 days --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But it's not just to those.\nIt's to a lot of other people. I mean, that's --\nMR. VERRILLI: But it -- but it arises from.\nThe -- had -- I think it arises from in this sense,\nJustice Scalia. Had Howard shut down on a certain day\nand didn't have employees anymore, it wouldn't have any\ncontinuing obligation to or need to pay workers'\ncompensation premiums because there would be no workers\nto cover. And so it arises from --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, except the workers who\nhad already been injured in the past --\nMR. VERRILLI: Right, but you don't need --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- and -- and whom you\ncontinue to pay. Right?\nMR. VERRILLI: But -- yes. But not -- but --\nbut we -- let's see. I think that maybe this will\nclear up the confusion. We continue to pay for them\neven after the policy is over --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Right.\nMR. VERRILLI: -- and -- but -- and so --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And I assume that each of\nyour premiums takes into account the fact that you're\nnot only going to be paying for people, you know, who\nwere injured between the last premium and now, but that\nyou're also going to be paying for people who were\ninjured a long time ago.\nMR. VERRILLI: Well, depending on the kind of\npolicy, that may be true to some extent. Sometimes\npolicies are loss-sensitive policies in which the\namounts owed are calculated very carefully with respect\nto the amounts actually of loss incurred during the\nperiod. That is, in fact, the case here. If you have\nan understanding of insurance, you can infer that from\nthe charts that are included in the joint appendix,\nalthough I acknowledge it's very difficult to do so.\nSo I do think -- I do think on any common\nsense understanding of the -- of the phrase, arising\nfrom, which is a capacious phrase, it really does arise\nfrom.\nBut in terms of -- I think, Justice Stevens,\nwith respect to your question, to get to the same\nanswer, in terms of calculating the amount of the\nclaim, whichever one you pick here, there's actually a\ndivision of authority in the lower courts. There's a\nFourth Circuit opinion by Judge Luttig, saying it's\nservices rendered by the insurance company. Other\ncourts say services rendered by the employees. Since it\ndoesn't make a difference in this case, I would\nrespectfully suggest probably it ought not to be\ndecided in this case because you get to the same place\neither way.\nI do -- I do think that it's important also\n-- I'm sorry. Excuse me. If I may just go back to the\nnarrow construction rule.\nThe -- the point of this idea of primacy of\nequality of distribution. Equality of distribution is\nan important policy under the bankruptcy code, but it's\nonly one important policy under the bankruptcy code.\nRehabilitation of the debtor is an important policy\nunder the code. The maximizing the value of the estate\nis an important policy under the code, and specific\ncode provisions advance other specific policies as\nwell. So in any given case, as here, all of those co-\npolicies aren't going to align and point in the same\ndirection. Sometimes they're going to be at cross\npurposes.\nAnd what -- what the Court said in Union\nBank, in I think a closely analogous context\ninterpreting the ordinary course exemption from -- from\nthe preference rule, was that we don't put a thumb on\nthe scale either way here. We don't assume that one of\nthese policies is more important than the other. What\nwe assume is that Congress struck the balance between\nthe potentially competing policies, that the balance is\nreflected in the text of the statute that Congress\nenacted, and that we should interpret the text as it's\nwritten without -- without a presumption in either\ndirection. I really think Union Bank is highly\ninstructive on that, and it's just -- it's just right\nand plain common sense. And that's why I think in the\nvast majority of cases, there is no rule of narrow\nconstruction.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What is -- what is\nunemployment compensation? Those two I think of as\nthose are law-mandated coverage that every employer\nmust have: workers' comp and unemployment. So\nwhat's unemployment, is that a plan too?\nMR. VERRILLI: No, because the employer\ndoesn't have the obligation to provide unemployment\ncompensation. That's a State-run system in which the\nState has the obligation to provide the benefit, and\nthe State does in fact provide the benefit. It's\nusually funded through a tax. The key difference is\nthis is an employer obligation to provide these\nbenefits, and I think that's why this is an employee\nbenefit plan. The employer is obligated to provide it\nto employees by virtue of the fact that the employees\nare working for the employer. Not true about\nunemployment compensation.\nIn conclusion, if I could just focus on the\n-- the point that it really is the case that enforcing\nthis priority, as it is written, will advance the\npurposes for which Congress included it in the code.\nIt will protect the interests of workers, millions of\nwhom have no employee benefit plan other than workers'\ncompensation, because it will increase the prospects\nthat that money is there to pay workers' compensation\nclaims.\nIt will also advance the code's purpose of\nbetter rehabilitation because it will give insurance\ncompanies a reason not to pull the hair trigger, to\nhang in there with these companies, and to allow them\nto have a chance to rehabilitate rather than forcing them\ninto liquidation by canceling coverage which the law\nallows.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.\nVerrilli.\nMr. Strain, you have 4 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL F. STRAIN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. STRAIN: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nThis Court 10 years ago in United States v.\nReorganized CF&I provided that -- I suggest, that the\nengrafting of the ERISA definition into this bankruptcy\nstatute was improper. Almost word for word what we're\nasking the Court to find about this engrafting of the\nERISA definition into the bankruptcy statute is dealt with\nin plain language in this Supreme Court decision. It is\nsimply improper to do that, and yet, that is the answer\ngiven by Zurich to the many probing hypotheticals about\nparking lots and bottled water and the rest.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, they're doing that to\nget a standard.\nMR. STRAIN: I'm sorry, Your Honor?\nJUSTICE BREYER: And I'd like to know what\nyour -- they're trying to use that as a basis for\nseparating the bottled water from the workmen's comp\nfrom the health benefit. And they're saying here's an\nexample of where Congress put the workers' comp on the\nsame side as the health benefit. Now, that's their\napproach.\nWhat's your approach to the standard? What\nrule or system would you use from deciding which\ninsured-for or paid-for benefits count as the plan and\nwhich ones don't?\nMR. STRAIN: What we look to, Justice Breyer,\nfirst of all, is whether it is a true wage substitute\nrather than a policy to take care of a non-negotiable\nstatutory requirement that's --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So if, in fact -- if, in\nfact, the State legislature mandates certain health\nbenefits, then the plan that provides those benefits\nwould no longer qualify.\nMR. STRAIN: That would be one significant\nfactor to consider, Your Honor. There are certainly\nothers, but that would be one significant factor to\nconsider. That is true.\nAnd I -- I suggest to the Court that when we\nlook to the legislative history, as the questions were\nasked about the legislative history, it is devoid of\nany reference to the commission that recommended the\nlaw, the House report or the Senate report, or even one\nstray Congressperson suggesting that workers' comp\ninsurance policies should get a priority. Not one.\nThe industry didn't even put up a representative to\nmake that suggestion at a hearing. It is devoid of any\nsupport for putting this nose under the tent in the way\nthey suggest, and it truly is a broadening. It is not\nsubrogation. The bondholder would not have a\nsubrogated claim. F&M Bank would not have a subrogated\nclaim. They would have a claim, a direct claim, just\nas Zurich does here.\nAnd I think that the issue we come back to --\nand I'm glad my brothers ended with that as well because\nthat's where we began. The issue is what is the\nCourt's proper approach to this attempt to enlarge the\npriority under subsection (a)(4). It is not correct\nthat this Court departs from the idea that priorities\nare a deviation from the bedrock principle of equality\nof -- equality of distribution. That remains good law,\ncited by this Court a number of times.\nThe cases they purportedly cite to the\ncontrary were plain language cases, were Embassy\nRestaurant and Joint Industries Board. This Court\ndidn't even feel necessary to cite that principle\nbecause of the -- because of the plain language. Where\nis the plain language establishing clearly, as this\nCourt requires, that this is a plan? Where is the\nplain language establishing clearly that this is an\nemployee benefit? The insurance policy. That's what\nwe're talking about. Not the workers' compensation\nstatute. The insurance policy may benefit the\nemployer. The statute may benefit the employee. But\nwe are talking about contributions to an employee\nbenefit plan. Zurich's insurance policy is neither.\nUnless there are further questions, Mr. Chief\nJustice, that concludes my argument.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.\nStrain.\nMR. STRAIN: Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The case is\nsubmitted.\n(Whereupon, at 11:11 a.m., the case in the\nabove-entitled matter was submitted.)\n"
