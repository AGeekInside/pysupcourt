Am I pronouncing your name\ncorrectly?\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK J. RICCIARDI\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. RICCIARDI: It's Ricciardi, sir.\nQUESTION: Mr. Ricciardi.\nMR. RICCIARDI: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThis case involves the extraordinary situation\nin the law where the burden of proof is shifted to a\ndefendant. Courts have recognized this type of burden\nshift in certain limited situations, certain torts, and in\n1989 this Court recognized that burden shift in Title VII\ncases.\nWe are here today because the court below has\nheld and the respondent argues that the Civil Rights Act\nAmendment of 1991 shifts the burden of proof to the\ndefendant in virtually all Title VII disparate treatment\ncases. That conclusion does not follow from the text of\nthe Civil Rights Act, nor does it make sense based on this\nCourt's history of fashioning the orderly presentation of\nproof in Title VII cases.\nThe Civil Rights Act of 1991 was passed in part\nas a response to certain decisions of this Court. One of\nthose decisions was Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins where the\nCourt recognized that in certain limited situations in a\nTitle VII disparate treatment case, when the plaintiff\npresents direct evidence of an unlawful motive that was\nactually relied upon in making a decision, the burden of\ncausation then shifts to the defendant.\nThe Price Waterhouse mixed-motive framework\napplies to a narrow subset of cases. The Court recognized\nearly on in Title VII that most of these cases will be\ncircumstantial evidence cases, and as a way to deal with\nthat, the McDonnell Douglas case set up a framework for\nconsidering the vast majority of those cases. In the few\ncases where there is direct evidence of illegal animus\ntied to an employment decision, the Court said that the\ndefendant must now prove that it would have made the same\ndecision either way.\nQUESTION: And what is your definition of direct\nevidence, Mr. Ricciardi?\nMR. RICCIARDI: There's two definitions that\nwe've briefed, Your Honor. Both of them I think are\nhelpful. The first one is quoted in the SG's brief at\npage 26, and that's from the EEOC guidance. And I'll read\nthat. Any written or verbal policy or statement made by a\nrespondent or a respondent official that on its face\ndemonstrates a bias against a protected group and is\nlinked to the complained-of adverse action.\nWe proposed, Your Honor, in our blue brief a\nslightly different formulation, but I believe it gets you\nto the same place. On page 41 of our blue brief,\nborrowing from the First Circuit Febres case, a three-\npart test which we think gets you to the same place. The\nfirst is there has to be a statement by a decisionmaker;\nsecond, that directly reflects the alleged animus; and\nthird, that it bears squarely on the contested employment\ndecision.\nQUESTION:\nis -- goes beyond what the -- what the Government -- the\nEEOC guideline would require, doesn't it? As I understand\nthe EEOC guideline, it doesn't require that -- that the\nindication come from a decisionmaker.\nMR. RICCIARDI: You're correct, Your Honor. The\nwords of the EEOC are the respondent or respondent\nofficial. Yes, so it does go a bit beyond. I -- I --\nQUESTION: Although the fact that it has to bear\nupon the decision, it's hard to get there without --\nMR. RICCIARDI: Well, I think maybe --\nQUESTION: -- pinning it on a decisionmaker\nsomehow.\nMR. RICCIARDI: What could be contemplated I\nguess is a respondent official, who's maybe even higher\nthan the decisionmaker, makes the statement.\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. RICCIARDI: The Civil Rights Act of 1991\nsets out a new section, and we've set it out in appendix\nA.\nQUESTION: Of your brief?\nMR. RICCIARDI: Of the brief, of the blue brief,\nYour Honor. It sets out 42 U.S.C. 2000e-2(m), which was\n107(a) of the Civil Rights Act. And that described that\nan unlawful employment practice would be established when\nthe complaining party demonstrates that race, color,\nreligion, sex, or national origin was a motivating factor\nfor any employment practice. And then this is the key\nlanguage: even though other factors also motivated the\npractice.\nThis indicates that Congress intended for there\nto be the distinction, recognized in Price Waterhouse,\nbetween the standard McDonnell Douglas pretext case, which\nyou prove under 2000e-2(a), and the mixed-motive case\nwhich was first recognized in Price Waterhouse.\nThe second part of the text that evidences this\ndistinction is section 107(b) of the Civil Rights Act\nwhich is codified there in that same place at 2000e-\n5(g)(2)(B), and that talks about where an individual\nproves a violation under 2(m) that -- and where the\nemployer does not succeed in proving -- excuse me -- where\nthe employer does succeed in proving the affirmative\ndefense, then in that case the plaintiff is entitled only\nto declaratory relief, injunctive relief, and attorneys'\nfees demonstrated to be directly attributable only to the\npursuit of a claim under section 2000e-2(m).\nQUESTION: Mr. Ricciardi, would that\ndemonstration by the defendant also have to be made by\ndirect evidence? The words Congress used is the same.\nOne is respondent demonstrates, and the other is the\nplaintiff demonstrates.\nMR. RICCIARDI: The word demonstrate is used\ntwice, Your Honor, but I do not agree that the respondent\nor the defendant or the employer has any heightened\nstandard. And the reason I say that is because in order\nto interpret the burdens of proof, this Court historically\nlooks at background principles. And when we look at this\nstatute, using the Court's background principles of\nMcDonnell Douglas for the standard pretext case and Price\nWaterhouse for the standard mixed-motive case, there's no\nheightened evidentiary standard for the respondent or the\nemployer.\nQUESTION: Well, the question whether there is,\nyou would be suggesting a rule that, as far as I know, is\nalien to our law, that is, to make a distinction between\ndirect evidence and circumstantial evidence. You can have\ndirect evidence by a liar and you can have highly\nconvincing circumstantial evidence. So why would the law\nin this one area make a distinction that, as far as I\nknow, is not made elsewhere?\nMR. RICCIARDI: Your Honor, I believe the\ndistinction is made because the shifting of the burden to\nthe defendant in employment cases is an unusual thing. It\ndoes not happen in other areas of the law. Courts need a\nbright line rule in order to --\nQUESTION:\nwas unquestionably made in Price Waterhouse, wasn't it?\nMR. RICCIARDI: Absolutely, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: I mean, that's what it said.\nMR. RICCIARDI: Price Waterhouse --\nQUESTION: What -- what was it -- the it that\nwas said in Price Waterhouse? Not in the -- not in the\nplurality opinion. The direct evidence rule doesn't come\nout of a plurality --\nQUESTION: Concurring opinion.\nMR. RICCIARDI: Well --\nQUESTION: It came out of a concurring opinion\nthat bore my name, did it not?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. RICCIARDI: That is correct, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Yes. And I don't think it appeared\nin the plurality opinion, nor in Justice White's\nconcurring opinion, did it?\nMR. RICCIARDI: No, it did not, Your Honor.\nWhat I believe the --\nQUESTION: I know a number of courts have\nfollowed it, but I -- it's hard to extract a -- a rule\nunder those circumstances.\nMR. RICCIARDI: I -- I --\nQUESTION: Congress, in making its amendments in\n1991, did not mention anything about direct evidence, did\nit?\nMR. RICCIARDI: No, it did not, Your Honor.\nAnd -- and I think there are two things that --\nthat we have to look at. One of them is the plurality\nopinion did in -- in note 13 state that -- that its\nformulation was not meaningfully different from Justice\nO'Connor's concurrence. For what -- for what that's\nworth, that's there. And another way I think to look at\nthe direct evidence picture is that six Justices of the\nSupreme Court all found that the facts in Price Waterhouse\nwere sufficient to have a mixed-motive burden shift.\nQUESTION: Fine. So that's what I took the\nstatement -- I mean, far be it from me to characterize\nsomebody else's opinion, but I thought the statement was\nsimply saying, and here this is an added feature that\nshows how right the majority is and that's true in that\ncase, but what is there that suggests that it's not just\nan added feature showing the majority was right in that\ncase, but that you have to have it and can't have anything\nthat isn't direct evidence.\nMR. RICCIARDI: Well, Your Honor, I think --\nQUESTION: Where does it say that?\nMR. RICCIARDI: I think we get that from going\nback to background principles. The McDonnell Douglas\ndecision, which has still been followed and has been\nreferred to by this Court, is the rubric that's used for\ncircumstantial evidence cases.\nQUESTION: But wait I didn't -- then I probably\nam unclear about it. What I thought happened is that\nPrice -- that McDonnell Douglas governs a circumstance\nwhere a plaintiff puts on a case, however he puts it on.\nOnce you show the McDonnell Douglas factors, you can get\nto the jury unless, of course, the defendant puts\nsomething on. And once the defendant puts something on,\nMcDonnell Douglas bursts and goes away. Now, am I right\nabout that or not?\nMR. RICCIARDI: That is correct, Your Honor.\nAnd the plaintiff --\nQUESTION: All right. Then -- then I don't see\nwhat McDonnell Douglas has to do with this because I would\nthink 90 percent of the cases in which there is a mixed\nmotive are going to come up because the defendant will\nsay, I did it for a different reason, and the plaintiff\nwill come back and say, you did it for both reasons. So I\nthink in 90 percent of the cases, we're not going to have\nany McDonnell Douglas involved.\nMR. RICCIARDI: I -- I --\nQUESTION: It will just be -- am I right or not?\nMR. RICCIARDI: I -- I don't agree with that,\nYour Honor.\nthe facts on the classic mixed-motive cases -- Mt.\nHealthy, for example, and -- and that was a case\nspecifically relied upon in Justice White's concurrence.\nThere we had a school district in a written letter making\nan admission, yes, we considered the illegal aspect of\nyour First Amendment rights. And then we have Price\nWaterhouse where, on the facts it's uncontested that the\nwritten evaluations by those partners, which were relied\nupon by the policy board, used sexual stereotypes.\nQUESTION: Did -- did the defendants in those\ntwo cases put on any evidence?\nMR. RICCIARDI: I would -- I would imagine they\nabsolutely did, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Yes, so do I. So neither of those\ncases does McDonnell Douglas have to do with anything,\nbecause they aren't involved in the case I gather, if I'm\nright, once the defendant put on some evidence.\nMR. RICCIARDI: That is correct, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: All right. So my question really is\nsince McDonnell Douglas doesn't have much to do with the\ncases in which mixed motive comes up, why does -- why are\nyou talking about McDonnell Douglas? What has McDonnell\nDouglas to do with the background rule? Why isn't the\nbackground rule just -- well, what your opponents are\nsaying?\nMR. RICCIARDI: Well, because, Your Honor, the\nbackgrounds rule enables us to deal with the cases where\nthere is not direct evidence of the illegal motivation,\nand those cases will be rare. And if you look at Mt.\nHealthy and if you look at the facts -- Price Waterhouse\nfacts, in the concurrence by Justice O'Connor in Price\nWaterhouse, it says, the employer has created uncertainty\nas to causation by knowingly giving substantial weight to\nan impermissible criteria. I believe these cases will be\nfew and far between where you --\nQUESTION: Mr. Ricciardi, can we go back to the\nbackground, which I find very difficult to understand\nbecause if an elevated proof standard is wanted, then\ncourts not uncommonly will say, we will require you to\nprove something by more than a mere preponderance. We\nwill require you to prove this by clear and convincing\nevidence. Then I can understand. But a line between\ndirect evidence and circumstantial evidence -- is there\nany other area where direct evidence counts for more than\nsubstantial evidence just by virtue of being direct?\nMR. RICCIARDI: I have not uncovered ones, Your\nHonor. I think that is what the Court in Price Waterhouse\nwas faced with, and I think it's a bright line rule that\nwould give our trial judges the ability --\nQUESTION:\nWaterhouse when it's in the opinion, as Justice O'Connor\nsaid? Her opinion. There were four people who didn't say\ndirect evidence. There was Justice White who said a\nsubstantial factor, but didn't say direct evidence.\nThat's a lot to load on two words in a concurring opinion.\nMR. RICCIARDI: Well, Your Honor, unfortunately\nbecause of the fractured opinions there, we have had to\nrely on, besides the actual words on the page, we had to\nrely on, what -- the way the circuits have read the case\n-- and they have all consistently -- almost all\nconsistently read it as having a heightened evidentiary\nstandard and --\nQUESTION: Well, wouldn't heightened ordinarily\nbe clear and convincing evidence, whether direct or\ncircumstantial?\nMR. RICCIARDI: Your Honor, it might ordinarily,\nbut I believe in employment cases it's very difficult to\ndo. In employment cases we have stray remarks, we have\nrumors, we have maybe documents that are --\nQUESTION: Sure. But doesn't -- doesn't a\nstandard like clear and convincing address that kind of\nproblem? If all you have are stray remarks that, you\nknow, cannot be taken as company policy, et cetera, then\nyou're going to have a hard time getting to the clear and\nconvincing standard.\nof evidence, direct or indirect, is -- is necessary to\naddress that problem as opposed to the -- to the quantum\nof proof, clear and convincing versus preponderance.\nMR. RICCIARDI: Your Honor, I think that you're\nputting too much weight on the shoulders of the trial\njudges. In our case, our trial judge was convinced that\nthere was direct evidence, and he was sifting through what\nwe believed amounted to nothing more than a pile of\ncircumstantial evidence. And I think had he had the\nguidance of the bright line rule, it would have been\neasier for him.\nQUESTION: Can you explain to me -- and you're\nthe expert on this, I'm not. You try a lot of these\ncases. When I look at it, being naive in this area, since\nI'm not trying a lot of them, I think, well, this -- this\nseems to make perfectly good sense. A plaintiff comes in\nand has to show that the bad motive was a motivating\nfactor. Well, once the plaintiff has shown that, why\nshouldn't the plaintiff win? And if, by the way, the\ndefendant can come in and show that she would have been\nfired anyway because she was a bad typist, well, then\nmaybe he shouldn't have to pay damages.\nMR. RICCIARDI: Your Honor, going back to the\ntext of the statute, 2(m) defined the plaintiff's duty as\nshowing that the illegal criteria was a motivating factor.\nBut the vast majority of cases fall under 2(a)(1) where\nthe plaintiff must show that he or she was discriminated\nagainst because of sex, gender, race, whatever. So that\nis a but for standard in 2(a), which means that the\nplaintiff has to carry the ball all the way across the\ngoal line, does not shift the burden of proof to the\ndefendant.\nQUESTION: But the burden of proof that -- that\nyou keep referring to, in effect, is the burden of proof\nfor what under the statutory scheme is -- is a partial\naffirmative defense. What is remarkable about saying if\nyou -- if you want to claim a partial affirmative defense,\nyou have the burden of proof on it? You always have the\nburden of proof on an affirmative defense.\nMR. RICCIARDI: Well, what makes this\nextraordinary, Your Honor, is that under 2(m), the\nplaintiff never has to prove that what this defendant did\ncaused this injury. The but for is in 2(a), but in 2(m),\nthe plaintiff can say --\nQUESTION: 2(m) is addressing something else.\n2(m) is -- is addressing what happens if, in fact, a -- a\ndefendant wants to raise an affirmative defense, a partial\naffirmative defense. That's all it addresses.\nMR. RICCIARDI: Your Honor, I believe --\nQUESTION:\naddresses the sufficiency of -- of liability, and then it\ngoes on to address the -- the affirmative defense.\nMR. RICCIARDI: Well, Your Honor, my response to\nthat is I believe that the Civil Rights Act incorporated\n2(m) as a direct response and a partial codification of\nthe Price Waterhouse decision because there was no burden\nshift under Title VII until Price Waterhouse created it.\nQUESTION: When that was enacted, was there\nalready a considerable body of court of appeals opinions\nwhich had interpreted Price Waterhouse as establishing the\ndirect evidence rule, or did they come later?\nMR. RICCIARDI: Your Honor, I believe these are\ncited in the -- in the SG's brief, and I believe there\nwere five circuit courts that had, between Price\nWaterhouse and the Civil Rights Act, recognized that.\nYour Honor, may I reserve?\nQUESTION: Yes, Mr. Ricciardi.\nWe'll hear from Mr. Gornstein.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF IRVING L. GORNSTEIN\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES AS AMICUS CURIAE\nSUPPORTING THE PETITIONER\nMR. GORNSTEIN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nSince 1964, Title VII's disparate treatment\nprohibition has required a finding that a protected\ncharacteristic such as gender was a but for cause of an\nadverse employment decision. Now, the '91 amendments\ncreate a special rule of liability for mixed-motive cases\nwhere proof of but for cause is not required. To qualify\nfor --\nQUESTION: How do we know that those amendments\napply only to mixed-motive cases? The language in the\nstatute Congress passed is pretty broad.\nMR. GORNSTEIN: It -- the --\nQUESTION: And in theory, it could apply across\nthe board.\nMR. GORNSTEIN: The text that says, even though\nother factors also motivated the practice, make clear that\nthe amendment only applies to mixed-motive cases. It\ndoesn't say, even if, which would be regardless of\nwhether, but it says, even though, which means the factors\nwere present, but that it doesn't matter. And so the text\nmakes clear that it applies only to mixed-motive cases,\nbut it doesn't address --\nQUESTION: Well, the text makes clear that the\nexception does, but why does 2(m) not apply to all cases?\nMR. GORNSTEIN: 2(m) says, even though other\nfactors also motivated the -- the practice. That's what\n2(m) says. And that -- that limits it to mixed-motive\ncases.\nQUESTION: It says whether or not they -- other\nfactors motivate it.\nMR. GORNSTEIN: No. If it -- if it was whether\nor not, it would be even if. Even though means the\nfactors were present. Other factors were present, but it\ndoesn't matter under this statute that they were.\nNow, the text of the law doesn't address what\nkind of evidence is sufficient to make out a mixed-motive\ncase, and it leaves that to resolution through background\nprinciples as Congress typically does. Congress typically\ndoes not address what kind of evidence is sufficient. And\nthe key and most relevant and pertinent background\nprinciple here was that before the amendment, direct\nevidence was required to make out a mixed-motive case.\nQUESTION: Do you say that because that's the\nway a lot of court of appeals determined, or do you think\nthat was a necessity by virtue of the split in the\nopinions on this Court?\nMR. GORNSTEIN: Two sources for that, Justice\nSouter. One is the court of appeals' decisions, and there\nwere five between the time of Price Waterhouse and the\ntime of the '91 amendments, and that formed an important\npart of the backdrop against which Congress --\nQUESTION: Were those -- were those opinions\nbased on the reading of this Court as depending upon\nJustice O'Connor's opinion where those words were used?\nMR. GORNSTEIN: I -- I would not --\nQUESTION: Or did the courts independently\ncreate a distinction between direct and substantial\nevidence?\nMR. GORNSTEIN: I think that those two -- those\ncases, for the most part, were trying to reconcile this\nCourt's decisions in McDonnell Douglas with Price\nWaterhouse, and that's exactly the first source for where\nwe would get the background rule as well.\nQUESTION: Well, then would you tell me --\nQUESTION: Why would you have that background?\nQUESTION: -- why would the court -- if that's\nwhat it was trying to do, why would it resort to something\nas extraordinary -- now that we no longer have formal\nrules of evidence, like you need two witnesses to prove A\nand three witnesses to prove B, why would it resort to\nthat kind of distinction between direct and circumstantial\nrather than a heightened burden expressed as clear and\nconvincing?\nMR. GORNSTEIN: Because it was trying to be --\nthey were trying to be faithful to this Court's decisions\nin McDonnell Douglas and Price Waterhouse. And let me\nexplain how those two decisions fit together because in --\nin Price Waterhouse, there was direct evidence, and six\nJustices said that was sufficient to shift the burden of\nproof. Now, no opinion expressly stated that something\nother than that would be sufficient to shift the burden of\nproof.\nQUESTION: But only one stated that it was\nnecessary as well as sufficient.\nMR. GORNSTEIN: That's correct.\nQUESTION: So you had five that did not say it\nwas necessary as well as sufficient.\nMR. GORNSTEIN: That's correct. And five did\nnot say that it would -- that anything less would be\nsufficient, however, and that issue is resolved by\nMcDonnell Douglas and -- and that line of cases.\nAnd what McDonnell Douglas and that line of\ncases say is that in a purely circumstantial evident case\n-- evidence case -- the plaintiff has a very light burden\nat the outset, but that once the employer comes back and\nputs on a nondiscriminatory explanation, the plaintiff has\nto carry the burden of proof all the way to showing\npretext and but for causation. The plaintiff under the\nMcDonnell Douglas line of cases has to show but for\ncausation.\nSo when you put the two decisions together,\nPrice Waterhouse and McDonnell Douglas, the rule that\nemerges is in -- to get into the Price Waterhouse box,\nwhere you get a shift in the burden of proof, you need\ndirect evidence.\nQUESTION: Are there cases in which a motivating\nfactor is not but for causation when it's not a mixed-\nmotive case?\nMR. GORNSTEIN: It -- it's a mixed-motive case\nwhere it's not a but for factor. That's correct.\nQUESTION: No. I'm asking the other -- the\nconverse of that. If there is no second motive, but\nmerely there's evidence of -- of a motivating factor,\nperiod, isn't that enough?\nMR. GORNSTEIN: No. If it's -- if it's the sole\nmotive, then it would be a violation under 2000e-2(a)(1).\nThat would be a --\nQUESTION: Would it also not be a violation of\nthis statute?\nMR. GORNSTEIN: No, because 2000e-2(m) is\ndesigned just for cases where there's more than one\nmotive.\nQUESTION: It's designed to create a special\ndefense and a special remedy, but it doesn't say anything\nabout what it takes to prove the case, does it?\nMR. GORNSTEIN: It leaves that to background\nprinciples. And as I was saying, that's the background\nprinciple.\nThe second point that's very crucial here is\nthat if there's not a direct evidence requirement, Justice\nStevens, the result would be that you are going to\neffectively render superfluous 2000e-2(1) which up until\nnow has been the principal safeguard against\ndiscrimination, and the reason is that 2000e-2(a)(1)\nrequires proof of but for cause. 2000e-2(m) requires\nproof --\nQUESTION: But I -- I still -- maybe I'm just\nstupid, but I don't understand the difference between a\nbut for cause and a motivating factor that is not part of\na mixed-motive case.\nMR. GORNSTEIN: If it's just --\nQUESTION: If -- if the only motivating -- if\nthere's a motivating factor and there's nothing else,\nisn't that but for causation?\nMR. GORNSTEIN: It -- certainly it is --\nQUESTION: And so is it if you have two, isn't\nit?\nMR. GORNSTEIN: -- 2000e-2(a)(1) but not -- it\ndoesn't apply where cases where it's not a but for cause.\nThat's what --\nQUESTION: Why not? In -- in law school, in my\nfirst year in torts, I learned that there's an odd case\nwhere you have two hunters shooting at the same person.\nNow, in both cases, you know, they're not actually\nliterally but for conditions, but they fall within the\nword because. My torts teacher used to call them co\ncausal conditions.\nMR. GORNSTEIN: Well --\nQUESTION: So I'm amazed that you're reading\nbecause, contrary to all tort law --\nMR. GORNSTEIN: No.\nQUESTION: -- to mean that if you have the co\ncausal condition, which happens to be two motives here,\nnot two hunters, that it wouldn't fall within the\nbeginning.\nMR. GORNSTEIN: No. That -- that's a special\ncase, Justice Breyer.\nQUESTION: Yes, it is.\nMR. GORNSTEIN: And -- and the ordinary rule is\nthat you have to show that it's but for cause, and the\nCourt said as much in --\nQUESTION: All right, but it's a special case\nwe're dealing with where you have two hunters -- I'm sorry\n-- two motives. And so in that unusual two-hunter/two-\nmotive case, what the Congress did was write 2(m) to tell\nyou treat it okay for liability, but don't award damages.\nNow, where am I wrong in that analysis?\nMR. GORNSTEIN:\nmissing there is that if you interpret 2000e-2(m) in that\nway, you would be rendering superfluous 2000e-2(a)(1)\nwhich requires but for cause by virtue of the because of\nlanguage. And if -- if under the -- that's because in\norder to show a violation, a plaintiff would only have to\nshow motivating factor, not but for cause. It would\nrender -- no plaintiff would ever seek to prove a 2000e-\n2(a) case. They'd always seek to prove a 2000e-2(m) case.\nAnd the result would be that what up until now\nhas been the principal safeguard in literally thousands of\ncases under Title VII would be translated -- transformed\ninto something that is almost completely obsolete, and\nthere's just nothing to indicate that Congress intended to\nso radically change the fabric of Title VII law. And what\nwe have is a much more modest adjustment.\nQUESTION: Would it be a radical change in our\nlaw if we said that instead of direct evidence, it's clear\nand convincing evidence?\nMR. GORNSTEIN: That would be a very big change\nin this Court's law if -- if this Court said that because\nthis Court has already said, under Title VII, the\nbackground understanding is more likely than not, and\nthat's what the plaintiff has to show. And so the way to\nlook at this amendment is not as a very fundamental change\nin the basic fabric of Title VII law, but a response to a\nparticular decision. That's what Congress was responding\nto.\nAnd if you'll recall in that case, there was\ndirect evidence. An employer basically admitted that it\nhad taken gender into account, and then the Court said,\nwell, the employer can get out from all liability by\nshowing absence of but -- but for cause. And Congress\nresponded to that particular decision in doing that.\nBut that didn't mean that Congress thereafter\nwent on to undertake a complete reexamination of the law.\nIt left it where it was, and where it was is in purely\ncircumstantial evidence cases, under McDonnell Douglas,\nonce the employer introduces a nondiscriminatory\nexplanation, the plaintiff has to carry the burden of\nproof of showing pretext and but for cause.\nIf the Court has nothing further.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Gornstein.\nMr. Peccole, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT N. PECCOLE\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. PECCOLE: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThis case, at the very middle of it, when we're\ntrying to settle instructions, the parties involved agreed\nto instructions 1 through 9.\njury was, in fact, the 107(a) instruction. It read -- and\nthis jury instruction is found at the joint appendix 32\nand 33. It read, the plaintiff has the burden of proving\neach of the following by a preponderance of the evidence.\nOne, Costa suffered adverse work conditions, and two,\nCosta's gender was a motivating factor in any such work\nconditions imposed upon her. Gender refers to the quality\nof being male or female.\nIf you find that each of these things has been\nproved against a defendant, your verdict should be for the\nplaintiff and against the defendant. On the other hand,\nif any of these things has not been proved against a\ndefendant, your verdict should be for the defendant.\nWhat I'm trying to point out is the parties at\nthat point and at that juncture had agreed that this\ndefinitely was a 107(a) case and it would go to the jury\nas such.\nThe only objection that Caesars had to\ninstructions was instruction number 10, and instruction\nnumber 10 was the same action defense that aids Caesars in\nthe fact that it actually cuts down the type of damages\nthat can be awarded. In fact, monetary damages cannot be\nawarded. That instruction aided Caesars and in no event\nis it easy for them to now come before this Court and say\nthey were harmed by the fact that that instruction was\ngiven.\nI would point out that this is similar to the\nReeves case, and the reason it is similar is in Reeves,\nthe parties in that case had basically agreed that the\nMcDonnell Douglas framework would be used, and this Court\nsaid since that seems to be the position of the parties,\nwe'll accept that. Well, I would submit that the same\nthing occurred in this case. The parties agreed that this\nis a 107(a) case, and that's -- that's the way it was\npresented to the jury.\nReading 703(m), which is Title VII 200e-2(m) --\nand that's found at the respondent's brief, page 9 -- the\nsection specifically states, except as otherwise provided\nin this title, an unlawful employment practice is\nestablished when a complaining party demonstrates a race,\ncolor, religion, sex, or national origin was a motivating\nfactor for any employment practice, even though other\nfactors also motivated the practice. That's stating any\nemployment practice that -- that takes into consideration\nany of the things listed, and in this case, it was gender.\nSo it was a gender-motivated case.\nI would point out that when we look at this\nstatute, it talks in terms of a plaintiff having to\ndemonstrate, and the plaintiff under that terminology\nmerely had to show and bear the burden of showing a case\nwhich actually would indicate that gender was a motivating\nfactor.\nIn the case that was presented to the jury,\nthere was absolutely no question that Ms. Costa showed a\ncase every bit as strong as the case and the facts that\nwere found in Price Waterhouse. Reference does not have\nto be made to Price Waterhouse. The statute itself does\nnot talk in terms of any heightened burden placed on the\nplaintiff, nor does it talk in terms of substantial\nevidence. It goes right to what it says on its face that\na plaintiff merely has to demonstrate.\nQUESTION: And what do you -- what do you\nrespond to the argument made by the Government if -- that\nif that is what it means and if it does not embody the\nunderstood requirement of direct evidence, it effectively\nsupplants (a)(1). It -- nobody would -- would try to\nprove a case under (a)(1), which is what has been the\ntraditional approach.\nMR. PECCOLE: In our brief, Your Honor, we -- we\nactually took the position that the language in 703(m)\ndoes, in fact, supplant the language in 701(a).\nQUESTION: So you -- you accept that argument.\nMR. PECCOLE: 703(a). Excuse me. But --\nQUESTION: Well, that's a massive change in --\nin --\nMR. PECCOLE: I -- I would like to maybe --\nQUESTION: I mean, it just shifts the burden to\nthe employer to prove nondiscrimination effectively.\nThat's a -- that's a very big change.\nMR. PECCOLE: I would like to backtrack just a\nlittle bit on that. I think there's an explanation\nnecessary. It has to be more detailed.\nIn the Price Waterhouse case, the plurality\nactually had said, first of all, the motivating factor was\nthe -- the motive involved.\nThe plurality also said that the -- the words\nbecause of, in 703(a), really didn't mean because of. It\nsaid something along the lines that it does not mean\nsolely because of. That's how the plurality basically got\nto motivating factor. The language motivating factor of\nthe plurality ended up in 703(m), and I think you could\nalso say that it -- the definition given by the plurality,\nto because of in 703(a), actually came over into 703(m)\ntoo.\nQUESTION: But they are still contradictory. I\nmean, (a)(1) would require in a mixed-motive case -- okay\n-- if -- if you apply (a)(1) to a mixed-motive case, it\nwould require the plaintiff to show that the -- the\nimproper motive was an effective cause and that the\nemployer would not have dismissed this person anyway.\nWhereas, if the new 2(m) governs, it's just the opposite.\nOnce you show an improper motive, it is up to the employer\nto show that if he wishes to get off, he would have taken\nthe same action anyway. So I -- the -- the two are just\nnot -- not compatible.\nMR. PECCOLE: I think the Ninth Circuit's\napproach is the best. The Ninth Circuit actually said\nthat if you show a single-motive type case which falls\nunder 703(a), that it goes to the jury as a because of.\nThere is just absolutely no question that is the better\napproach.\nThe other approach is, if there is a mixed\nmotive -- and these are decisions that have to be made by\nthe judge before the instructions go to the jury. If\nthere are mixed motives, then it goes to the jury as a\n703(m).\nIn this case, the mixed motives were there. It\ndid go to the jury as a 703(m), and it also included the\ndefense that Caesars had available under 706(g)(2)(b).\nQUESTION: And as I understand --\nQUESTION: Am I right --\nQUESTION: -- as I understand (m), it isn't a\nquestion of shifting the burden to the defendant. The\nplaintiff wins at that point. If the plaintiff\ndemonstrates sex is a motivating factor, at that point\nplaintiff wins. The affirmative defense doesn't take away\nthe plaintiff's victory. It just limits the remedy. So\nthe defendant can't get off the hook. As (m) is\nstructured, it's not that you're loading on the defendant\nan extraordinary burden of showing nonliability. If the\nplaintiff makes the demonstration that (m) calls for,\nplaintiff is the winner, and the only thing that -- the\nonly function of the defense is to limit the remedy.\nThat's how I understand --\nMR. PECCOLE: I -- I agree with you\nwholeheartedly on that. In fact -- and that's what\noccurred in this case. If you look at the verdict form,\nwhich is at the joint appendix on page 40, you'll see that\nwhat happened is the jury was instructed exactly the way\nyou just commented. If the plaintiff had established by a\npreponderance of an evidence that gender was a motivating\nfactor, then the plaintiff proved its case and should win\nright then and there.\nAnd if you see, you will find in number 2 of the\ninterrogatories, it asks the question, do you find that\nthe defendant's wrongful treatment of plaintiff was\nmotivated both by gender and lawful reasons? And the jury\nmarked yes. But had they marked no, if you look down to\nthe next sentence, it says, if your answer was yes, answer\nthe next question.\nquestion number 4, which was the damage section.\nQUESTION: Well, Mr. Peccole, what is your\nunderstanding of the relationship between 2(a)(1) and\ne-2(m)?\nMR. PECCOLE: e-2(m), Your Honor? Let me just\n--\nQUESTION: The -- the one we've been talking\nabout.\nMR. PECCOLE: The relationship between the two\nstatutes?\nQUESTION: Between the two sections, yes.\nMR. PECCOLE: Okay. First of all, the\nrelationship, if we're talking about 703(m), what -- what\nhappens there is the plaintiff --\nQUESTION: Why don't you refer to the statutory\nnumbers that -- that are in the -- the appendix.\nMR. PECCOLE: Yes. That's -- that will be a\nlittle bit easier.\nOkay. 703(m) is 42 U.S.C. 2000e-2(m).\nQUESTION: Right.\nMR. PECCOLE: What -- what that new statute did\nis it placed on the burden of the plaintiff to show -- and\nI -- and this -- this burden never changes. It never\nchanged with McDonnell Douglas. It does not change here.\nThe -- the burden is always on the plaintiff to prove by a\npreponderance of the evidence that gender was a motivating\nfactor. So what happens is once the plaintiffs have\nproved that, he's proved his case.\nThe problem now shifts, and it's -- it's an\naffirmative defense. It's not a shifting of burdens. An\naffirmative defense comes into play under 42 U.S.C. 2000e-\n5(g)(2)(B) which -- which allows the employer to come in\nand show that if they took the same action, even though\nthere was a gender-motivating factor, then it reduces\ntheir damages or the possibility --\nQUESTION: Well, are there any -- are there any\ncases that are covered by e-2(m) that are not covered by\n2(a)(1)?\nMR. PECCOLE: My answer in that case would have\nto be that conceivably -- the Ninth Circuit did say this,\nthat there are those cases. The cases are when you have a\n-- a single-motive case. They got back into the\ndistinction between single and mixed-motive. If you have\na true single-motive case, then it would come under the --\nthe section 703(a) which is 42 2000-2(a)(1).\nQUESTION: Does it matter?\nQUESTION: In your view, what -- what did\nCongress accomplish by 703(m), also known as 2000e-2(m)?\nMR. PECCOLE: I think what they accomplished\nwas, first of all, they clarified Price Waterhouse from\nthe standpoint that there was no heightened burden, no\ndirect evidence burden, no substantial factor burden. It\ndid that for sure.\nThe next thing that it did is it -- it made it\nso a plaintiff would bear the burden of having to\nestablish that gender played a motivating factor. And\nthat is in any employment decision, not just, you know,\nthe very limited type or anything like that. It says, any\nemployment decision. And that becomes an unlawful\nemployment action.\nQUESTION: Is -- is this correct, that McDonnell\nDouglas survives on your reading in a case in which the\ndefendant does not go forward with anything? The\nplaintiff puts in enough to make a prima facie case.\nDefendant sits mute. McDonnell Douglas controls the\nresult there. If the defendant does go forward with\nsomething at that point -- and -- and here I'm not sure of\nthis, but I think -- by definition, it then becomes a\nmixed-motive case, doesn't it? Under (m)?\nMR. PECCOLE: I believe it does.\nQUESTION: Okay.\nMR. PECCOLE: I -- I think --\nQUESTION: So McDonnell survives in the case of\nthe mute defendant. In the non-mute defendant, (m)\ngoverns everything.\nMR. PECCOLE: Let me see if I can answer.\nMcDonnell Douglas, as has been suggested -- it's used at\nthe very preliminary stage of a -- of a case. McDonnell\nDouglas at some point in that decision then bursts. It\ngoes away. And so what you're left with is the 71 -- or\n703(a) and the 703(m).\nNow, I'm -- here I'm -- again I'm relying on\nwhat the Ninth Circuit said. They are still giving\nMcDonnell Douglas cases some deference, but what they are\nsaying in fact is yes, once you're past that stage,\nbasically the 703(m) cases will come into play. That\nwill be the instructions to the jury.\nQUESTION: Does it -- does it -- just for\nclarifying in my mind, does it matter or doesn't it matter\nwhether you say (m) governs a separate set of cases? When\nI came in, I thought the answer to that was no, it\ndoesn't, that (e) governs every case because the cause can\ngovern the two-motive cases too, and that in (m) Congress\nwas simply clarifying that there could be such cases, and\nthen they go on to say what happens.\nBut the Government made a very good point and\nsaid no, I shouldn't look at it that way and I should look\nat it as if (e) governs the single-motive case and then\n(m) comes in to govern the dual-motive case. And that was\na good argument too.\nAnd so what I'm asking you, who understands this\na little better than I do, does it matter?\nMR. PECCOLE: No.\nQUESTION: No, it doesn't matter. That's it.\nQUESTION: Well, how many -- what percentage of\nall these cases, do you think, are single-motive cases?\nMR. PECCOLE: To guess, I would -- I would say\nprobably a vast majority of the cases are. They're -- or\nnot single. Excuse me. Those are mixed-motive cases.\nQUESTION: Well, you don't suggest the defendant\nalways admits liability, do you?\nMR. PECCOLE: No.\nQUESTION: If there's only issue about one\nmotive, it's always that the defendant has some kind of\ndefense in every case.\nQUESTION: If he stands mute, he -- he loses. I\nmean, under McDonnell Douglas, if the plaintiff comes in\nwith -- with a claim that this was the motive and the --\nand the defendant doesn't come up with anything, he loses,\ndoesn't he?\nMR. PECCOLE: Yes.\nQUESTION: So any case that goes forward is a\nmixed-motive -- is a mixed-motive case.\nMR. PECCOLE: Yes.\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. PECCOLE: Yes. And -- and the only thing --\nthe only time that I could see otherwise would be a -- a\nspecific instance where, for example, you have working\nwomen in a -- in a department. The employer comes in and\nsays we have to make a layoff because we're -- we're in\ndire straits. We can't afford it. They lay off that\nwhole division, and then 2 weeks later they hire a whole\nmale division. I think that you have the single motive\nthere and -- and you -- those are the only kind of cases I\ncan think of.\nQUESTION: Yes, they settle, don't they?\nMR. PECCOLE: Yes.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. PECCOLE: I -- I would entertain any other\nfurther questions.\nI think that one -- one other point I would like\nto make is that 703(m) and the way the Ninth Circuit has\napproached it, has made it simple and easy for the judges\nto handle, for the trial attorneys to handle, and for the\njury to handle through instructions. It's a -- it's a\nmuch easier way of handling these type cases.\nIt -- it's like any other civil case basically.\nPlaintiff has to come in and show by a preponderance of\nthe evidence that it's entitled to what it's -- it's\nsaying it's entitled to, that certain things occurred.\nThen the defense can either sit back and say, well, wait a\nsecond, you didn't prove your case, or the defense can\nsay, well, maybe there's a motivating factor here. Even\nafter I presented valid reasons for the termination, for\nexample, then what they'll do is they'll say, well, maybe\nI want this instruction that limits my damages. But it --\nit's a simple structure, and we have got to get to that.\nI mean, it is --\nQUESTION: But if you -- if you --\nMR. PECCOLE: -- so chaotic out there in the\ncircuits right now, it's just unbelievable.\nQUESTION: If you were right, Mr. Peccole, about\n(m) taking over the field so that every case becomes a\nmixed-motive case, why would Congress have added not even\nif, but even though other factors also motivated the\npractice?\nMR. PECCOLE: I don't think it has anything\nactually to do with the mixed-motive. I think what it is\n-- they're saying is even if that -- that kind of evidence\nis present. In any event, you succeed.\nQUESTION: Well, if they said whether or not,\nthen --\nMR. PECCOLE: Yes.\nQUESTION: -- I would see your point clearly.\nBut they didn't say whether or not.\nthough, which seems to assume that two -- at least two\nmotivating factors have been shown: one, sex; two,\nanother motive -- another even though another motivating\nfactor existed.\nMR. PECCOLE: I think if you read the any\nemployment practice means any. And I think what it does\nis it takes away from that last sentence or phrase. What\nit's done is it's basically said any employment practice\nwhere you can show that gender, for example, is a\nmotivating factor, you've proven your case. It doesn't\nmake any difference whether there's other factors present,\nwhether they're legitimate or illegitimate.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Peccole.\nMr. Ricciardi, you have 2 minutes left.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MARK J. RICCIARDI\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. RICCIARDI: I'd like to call the Court's\nattention to the joint appendix, page 17, the middle of\nthe page. It's the jury instructions colloquy. The court\nsays, all right, may I hear from the defense? And I say,\nyes, Your Honor. We have no objections to the court's\ninstructions 1 through 9. I believe this is not a mixed-\nmotive case, and under Price Waterhouse, direct evidence\nis required.\nI should have said 1 through 8.\nquestion about that. I don't think that's fatal to this\nappeal for several reasons.\nThere's no question that the trial judge was on\nfull notice of my position that it was not a -- it was not\na Price Waterhouse case.\nQUESTION: You also should have said, I believe\nthis is a mixed-motive case, not I believe this is not,\nshouldn't you? You had a bad morning I think.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: Did you think it was a mixed-motive\ncase or not?\nMR. RICCIARDI: No. No, Your Honor, it was not.\nIt was a McDonnell Douglas case. We should have gotten --\nif you look back to the actual jury instruction that was\ngiven, number 7 on page 32 --\nQUESTION: I see. Okay.\nMR. RICCIARDI: It was not a Price Waterhouse\ncase. That's why I'm here today. I've been living with\nthis for many years.\nBut jury instruction number 7 was the 2(a)(1)\nbecause of language, and the trial judge was on notice\nfrom our colloquy on my motion for judgment as a matter of\nlaw, which starts on page 15, that I was objecting that\nthe prima facie case hadn't been shown. There was no jury\nissue raised to show pretext.\nFurthermore, the Ninth Circuit, both the panel\nand the full en banc court, passed on the propriety of the\nmixed-motive instruction and never once had any problem\nwith the way I had preserved the objection.\nAnd then finally, in this Court, in the -- in\nthe petition for certiorari, we formulated the question,\nand in the opposition, which I believe is an optional\nfiling, the opposition to the petition for certiorari\nraises nothing about instruction number 9 or the 2(m)\nformulation. And it was only for the very first time in\nany of these many appeals was it raised in the merits\nbrief. So I believe --\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr.\nRicciardi.\n"
