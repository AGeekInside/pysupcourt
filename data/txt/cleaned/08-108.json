RUSSELL\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. RUSSELL: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nIn common usage to say that somebody\nknowingly transfers, possesses or uses something is to\nsay that that person knows what it is that he is\ntransferring, possessing or using. If I say that John\nknowingly used a pair of scissors of his mother, I am\nsaying not simply that John knew he was using something\nthat turned out to be his mother's scissors or even that\nJohn knew he was using scissors which turned out to be\nhis mother's, I am saying that John knew that the\nscissors he was using belonged out to be his mother.\nThe same principle follows under the Federal\naggravated identity theft statute, which calls for a\ntwo-year mandatory sentence for anyone who during and in\nrelations certain predicate --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Doesn't that depend on the\ncontext? You can think of examples where you have\nexactly the same usage and the person wouldn't\nnecessarily know about the ownership of the thing in\nquestion?\nMR. RUSSELL: I haven't been able to think\nof one. And the government hasn't been able to come up\nwith one.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How about so and so\nstole a car that belonged to Mr. Jones. I suppose you\ncould say that the person knew it was Mr. Jones' car,\nbut more likely somebody stole the car that turned out\nto be Mr. Jones's.\nMR. RUSSELL: I think that that formulation\ngives rise to a little bit more ambiguity in that\ncontext. I think if you said stole the car of Mr.\nJones, it is not particularly ambiguous. But at the\nvery least, this is a formulation that claim.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You think he knowingly\nstole the car that belonged to Mr. Jones, would that be\nthe parallel?\nMR. RUSSELL: Yes, I'm sorry if I left that\npart out.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You left out the\n\"knowingly.\" Once you put in \"knowingly\" --\nMR. RUSSELL: I think if the statement is,\nyou know, John knowingly stole the car of Mr. Jones,\nthat strongly implies that John knew that the car\nbelonged to Mr. Jones.\nJUSTICE ALITO: I repeat, doesn't that\ndepend on the context that you say somebody says to you,\nyou know, a car was stolen from our street last night.\nOh, what car was stolen? Oh, it was the car of Mr.\nJones. He knowingly stole the car of Mr. Jones. It\ndoesn't necessarily mean that the person who stole the\ncar knew that it was Mr. Jones's car.\nMR. RUSSELL: I do think that the\nformulation that John knowingly stole the car of Mr.\nJones most naturally is understood to imply that John\nknew whose car it was he was stealing.\nWe don't claim that the government has an\ninterpretation that's grammatically impossible. We are\njust simply saying that by far the most common usage of\nthis kind of formulation, particularly in a criminal\nstatute, is that the knowledge element applies to the --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Who did the mugger mug? He\nmugged the man from Denver. You think that he knowingly\nmugged the man from Denver. Do you think that means\nthat the mugger knew that the man was from Denver?\nMR. RUSSELL: I think that is a more\nambiguous statement.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Why is it more ambiguous?\nMR. RUSSELL: Because I think the \"from\"\npreposition --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Why isn't it less\nunambiguous. I thought your argument was that this was\nunambiguous.\nMR. RUSSELL: I think the possessive form\nmakes it, through common usage, unambiguous. We don't\nclaim that it is grammatically impossible. But we do\nthink that in ordinary usage people would understand --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So what if it isn't? I\nmean, suppose you had a statute, and the statute says it\nis a crime to mug a man from Denver. That's a Denver\nordinance, by the way, because no one else would pass\nit. I mean, but if those were the elements of the\ncrime, I guess, we do normally apply knowingly to each\nof them.\nMR. RUSSELL: That is correct in the\ncriminal --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Whether -- even if it isn't\nordinary usage.\nMR. RUSSELL: That's right. We have more\nthan one argument. We think that as a matter of\nordinary usage --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I was thoughtfully trying\nto push you on to the next argument.\nMR. RUSSELL: Well, we do think that in a\ncriminal statute you ordinarily assume, this Court has\nsaid that a conventional Mens Rea element extends to all\nof the elements of the offense.\nAnd Congress knows how to deviate from that\nwhen it wants to. It did so, for example, in the\nstatute that the Court construed in the X-Citement Video\ncase, where it referred to a person knowingly\ntransporting a visual depiction, comma, if that visual\ndepiction has certain characteristics. And this Court\nrecognized that that kind of formulation most naturally\nis read to end the knowledge requirement as the comma,\nif.\nCongress didn't do that here. In fact,\nthere is no textual indication that would lead one to\nbelieve that it didn't intend anything other than a\ncompletely conventional Mens Rea requirement in this\ncase.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Russell, am I correct\nin understanding that the government goes with you\nalmost all the way, and its only the last three words\n\"of another person,\" that they agree knowingly applies\nto \"without lawful authority,\" and that it applies to a\nmeans of identification? You have to know that it\nwas -- you were using the means of identification.\nMR. RUSSELL: As I understand that is not\ntheir position. That's the back-up to their back-up\nposition. The first position is that it only applies to\nthe verbs. Then they say, well, if you don't accept\nthat then, maybe it goes through \"without lawful\nauthority.\" And if you don't accept that, then maybe it\ngoes halfway through the phrase \"means of identification\nof another person.\nSo, they do raise all three alternatives.\nThat last argument, I think, fails both for text common\nusage reasons and in light of this tradition element\nthat we have been discussing. Textually, there is\nsomething no textual cue that the knowledge requirement\nstops halfway through the direct object phrase, \"means\nof identification of another person.\"\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: If the first -- this\nalien's first effort to get papers that would qualify\nfor him, if I -- if I remember correctly, the first time\naround he used an assumed name, not his own name.\nMR. RUSSELL: That's right.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: He used a false date of\nbirth. He got a Social Security card that happened to\nbelong -- to be the number of no live person --\nMR. RUSSELL: Correct.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- and -- and that would\nnot have violated. Even in the government's reading\nthat would not have violated --\nMR. RUSSELL: That's right.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- this statute.\nBut the second time around, your case, he\ndid use his own name. And the question was -- and it\nturned out that both the Social Security card and the\nalien registration, they were two different people but\nthey were both live.\nMR. RUSSELL: Correct.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So that does make it a\ncrime. But when the number turned out to be that\nbelonged to anybody that does not, you don't get the\ntwo-year add-on.\nMR. RUSSELL: Just to be clear, the only\nreason the government alleges that there is a crime here\nis because it turned out that those numbers had been\nassigned to somebody else. Under our view, that's not\nenough. That's enough to show that he committed the\npredicate offenses, and received very substantial\npunishment for that, but it's not enough to show that he\nwas qualified for an additional two years mandatory\nsentence as an aggravated identity thief.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Now, you can -- what would\nhappen if the -- the defendant doesn't -- doesn't act\nknowingly as to the question whether the identifying\ninformation belongs to a real person but is simply\nreckless as to whether the identifying information\nbelongs to a real person? Suppose that someone buys an\nidentification card and looks at it, and it looks like\nit might be a real identification card on which that\npersons picture has been inserted in place of the real\npicture, but the person can't be sure and it might\nreally be an entirely fake card. Would that be a\nviolation?\nMR. RUSSELL: Ordinarily recklessness does\nnot satisfy a knowledge requirement. Willful blindness\nordinarily does. But recklessness in itself ordinarily\ndoes not.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Would it be enough to go\nto the jury on the hypothetical Justice Alito gives you?\nMR. RUSSELL: I think so. I think the\ngovernment is free to present circumstantial evidence.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: You agree that you could\ngo to the jury whenever there is an identity card that\ndoes reflect the identity of a real person but there is\nno other knowledge that the government's case is\nintroduced that shows -- that there is no other evidence\nthat the government has introduced showing knowledge?\nMR. RUSSELL: If there is -- I think that\ncould be a component of circumstantial evidence case. I\ndon't think it would be enough. Particularly in a case\nlike this where --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose he has five\ndifferent cards with five different real people, would\nthat be enough to go?\nMR. RUSSELL: I don't think so in itself.\nParticularly in a case like this where the person gets\nup and testifies that they didn't know. The fact that\nthere is these numbers here --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: No, no. No. The fact that\nhe testified, that doesn't have anything to do with\nwhether or not the case goes to the jury. Does the\ngovernment make its case sufficient to resist the\nmotion -- the directed motion for acquittal if it just\nputs in the fact that you have five identity cards and\nthere are five different people and they are all real\npeople?\nMR. RUSSELL: No, I don't think so. And in\nfact, the fact that they are five different people\nprobably tends to undermine the evidence.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You are making it very hard\nfor me to vote with you, I must say. I thought you had\na pretty good -- a pretty good case. But if you are\ngoing to say somebody who has five identity cards, faces\nof individuals, presumably they are real individuals --\nMR. RUSSELL: I'm sorry, maybe I am\nmisunderstanding the hypothetical.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I thought that was the\nhypothetical. Five different -- the person has five\nidentity cards of real people, and -- and you don't know\nthat he knows that its the identity cards of a real\nperson, but he used it.\nMR. RUSSELL: Okay. If there -- if these\nare identity cards that have the picture of somebody\nother than him on them --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes. Yes.\nMR. RUSSELL: -- which is an unusual\nthing --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Of course.\nMR. RUSSELL: But if that's the case, then,\nyes, I think that -- you know, that there would be --\nthat that picture belongs to the person whose number is\nthere, and that they could do that. The ordinary --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: No, no. You have to have\nthe further inference that he knows that.\nMR. RUSSELL: I think a jury could\nreasonably infer that the person wouldn't -- would not,\nthat if you have an ID card with somebody else's name,\nsomebody else's number, somebody else's picture, that\nthat belongs to somebody else.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: That's not -- that's not\nthis case. In this case he had his own name. And I\ndon't know whether there was a picture on the alien\nregistration card. I don't know -- he used his own\nname. Did he use his own photograph?\nMR. RUSSELL: I don't know the answer to\nthat question. I mean, Social Security cards don't have\npictures.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: That was going to be my\nnext question. The next question is suppose it was the\nPetitioner's own name but somebody else's number.\nMR. RUSSELL: I would tend to think that\nthat's not sufficient. Of course --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I mean, that would --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Even if he had five\ndifferent cards, all with his name, but all with the\nidentification numbers of other real people?\nMR. RUSSELL: Again, I would -- I would\nthink not. I can understand that people could disagree\nwith that. And of course, the government is free to\nraise those kinds of arguments in other cases where this\ncomes up.\nAll of this goes the question of what does\nit take to show that somebody knows something. The\nquestion before the Court right now, and the only\nquestion, is whether the government has to show that\nknowledge at all. And in this case, you know, the\ngovernment's principal argument, I think their strongest\nargument is that reducing the mens rea requirements in\nthat way serves the purpose of facilitating prosecutions\nand therefore protection of the victim, and we don't\ndeny that it had that effect. And we don't deny that\nthis statute is directed at protecting victims, but that\ncould be said of an awful lot of criminal statutes.\nJUSTICE ALITO: What if the defendant\nchooses a name -- uses a name other than his or her own\nname? I guess has a identification card made up with\nthat, and doesn't know for sure that the name that's\nchosen actually belongs to another person, but because\nit's not an extremely uncommon name, has -- knows that\nit's virtually certain that that name belongs to some\nother person who is unknown to him? Is that a\nviolation?\nMR. RUSSELL: I think -- again, you have\nthis issue of recklessness versus knowledge. If he knew\nthat in fact it belonged to it, if he used John Doe, it\nturns out there are several hundred John Doe's in this\ncountry, and it does raise a difficult question about\nhow this statute ought to apply when you are using\nsomething that is so commonly identifying somebody, but\nit's hard to say that its identifying anybody in\nparticular.\nThe definition of the means of\nidentification in this statute says that it has to be a\nname or number that is capable of identifying a\nparticular person, so I think you get into questions\nwhen you're talking about common names, about how the\nstatute -- whether the statute would be satisfied.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, what if it's not an\nextremely common name, but not an extremely uncommon\nname? And what if it's -- what if the defendant chooses\nKevin K. Russell? Would that be a violation?\nMR. RUSSELL: You would have to show that he\nknew that that was a name belonging to a specific\nperson.\nJUSTICE ALITO: He would have to know that\nthere is such a person.\nMR. RUSSELL: He would have to know that\nthere is such -- he wouldn't have to know me, but he\nwould have to know that there is such a person. But\nagain --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Does he have to know that?\nSuppose he uses John Smith. Does it suffice that -- do\nwe have to show that he knows there is a John Smith in\nthe phone book, someplace in the United States?\nMR. RUSSELL: I think so. I think he would\nhave to know who that John Smith was, but he would have\nto know there is a John Smith. And that -- I mean, that\nkind of scenario does raise difficult questions about.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But I want an answer to\nthe question.\nMR. RUSSELL: Well, I think the answer is\nthe one that I gave you, which I think is disputable,\nbut it's -- the answer is that he has to know that there\nis a specific person named John Smith.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And it can't be submitted\nto the jury on the basis that anybody knows that there\nis a John Smith?\nMR. RUSSELL: I think that --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Can -- can it go to the\njury without any other evidence other than the fact that\n-- his possession of the card?\nMR. RUSSELL: If it's a sufficiently common\nname that he ought to know that there is somebody\nbearing that name, then yes, I would agree it would go\nto the jury on that.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: If the name said Anthony\nKennedy, would that go to the jury?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. RUSSELL: I -- again -- it's hard to\ndraw lines here, but I think the ultimate question is,\nyou know, could a reasonable jury think that somebody\nusing that name has to know there is a specific person\nwith that name, a specific person with that name? And\nquite possibly they could.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Can you give me an\nexample?\nMR. RUSSELL: It go to the jury. An awful\nlot of name examples would.\nI think simply in this case, though, when\nyou are talking about a number, I don't think -- it's a\nmuch harder case to say that simply having a number on\nthe card should -- should lead you to know that that\nname very likely belongs to somebody else. In fact,\nthere are nine -- there are -- there a billion possible\ncombinations for security -- Social Security numbers,\nand only about 400 million have been issued. But to get\nback -- I --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But if you say this goes\nto the jury, it doesn't leave very much to your\nknowledge argument.\nMR. RUSSELL: Well --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I mean, I suppose that\ndefense counsel can get up, say the government hasn't\nshown that he knew this, and then the government says\nthat of course he knows it -- I don't think you have\naccomplished very much.\nMR. RUSSELL: Well, it does. I think the\njury still has to make the finding that he knew it. And\nin a case like this where my client testified that he\ndidn't know it, where the government didn't contest\nthat, didn't argue that there were substantial evidence\nshowing that he did know it, it's going to be\noutcome-determinative. In that --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: How do these operations\nwork? He went to Chicago to buy false identification\npapers. Did, the first time he go to the same outfit as\nthe time he used a false name?\nMR. RUSSELL: The record doesn't disclose\nthat, and I don't know.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: These are outfits that\nspecialize in making false identifications?\nMR. RUSSELL: Again, the record doesn't\ndisclose how sophisticated the operation was. In this\ncase it could just be a guy who does this; it could be a\nvery sophisticated operation. I think it's kind of all\nover the place out there, in the real world.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Do you have any sense\nof -- because there are any people with false\nidentification papers, how many times it turns out to be\nthe number of a live person, and how many times it turns\nout like it was in the first instance in this case; it\nis just a number, a made-up number that doesn't belong\nto anybody?\nMR. RUSSELL: I'm afraid I don't have a good\nsense of that. But just to be clear, in addition to\nbeing able to just say on the face of the fact about the\nidentification that the government can present\ncircumstantial evidence to the jury, in a great number\nof cases, particularly the kinds that Congress was most\nconcerned about, the way that they -- the defendant\nobtained the identification and the way that they used\nit provides powerful circumstantial evidence of\nknowledge.\nSomebody who breaks into a computer system\nor unauthorizedly uses access to a computer system or\ngoes dumpster diving looking for IDs obviously knows\nthat they are going to end up with an ID that belongs to\nanother person, and if they use the ID to get into a\nreal person's bank account, then it is awfully good\ninformation that they were aware that that was an ID\nthat belonged to another person, because there's no\nsense in trying to break into the bank account of a\nnon-existent person. And so we don't think that this is\na case in which the government faces some kind of\ninsurmountable burden in proving knowledge in a way that\nis particularly different than -- than other kinds of\nsituations in which the law commonly requires the\ngovernment to prove what a defendant knew or did not.\nTo get back to the victim-focused nature of\nthis, you know, Congress could -- we don't dispute that\nCongress could make a policy judgment that it would be\ngood to hold defendants strictly liable when they used\nan identification that turns out to belong to somebody\nelse. Sometimes the law does. Most commonly with\nrespect to sentencing enhancement provisions of the sort\nthat the government points to with respect to the\nquantity of selling drugs in a school zone. But when\nCongress makes that choice, Congress makes that clear in\nthe decks of the statute, so if you look at the drug\nquantity of the school zone provisions that are in\nappendix E and D of the yellow brief appendix, in\nappendix D you see Congress establishes in subsection A\nof that provision the \"unlawful act,\" and it says it's\nunlawful for any person knowingly to manufacture,\ndistribute, et cetera, a controlled substance.\nIt includes in that provision a knowledge\nrequirement, which, by the way, nobody thinks means only\nthat the government has to show that they knowingly\nmanufactured something which turned out to be a\ncontrolled substance. Everybody agrees that the\nknowledge requirement in that position extends to the\ndirect object phrase \"controlled substance.\"\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that doesn't\nhelp you much because it can't be knowingly manufacture\nsomething is the crime. I mean, you do have to go on to\nhave that make any sense. You don't have to go on to\nmake your provision make any sense, that he knowingly,\nyou know, uses a means of identification.\nMR. RUSSELL: I disagree as matter of common\nusage. But I think when Congress intends to have a\nstatute read that way, versus a statute that looks like\nthis one, which in subsection (b) lays out the facts\nthat are aggravating, that they are going to find\nseparately, the drug quantity in subsection (b) of 21\nUSC 48-\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, I guess --I\nguess basically this is what I was trying to say earlier\nas well. You have in your statute in between there, the\nmodifier \"without lawful authority.\"\nMR. RUSSELL: Right.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So that means that\nit can stop at a lot more number of earlier places then\ncan the statute you were just citing in appendix D.\nMR. RUSSELL: Well, to answer that question\n-- and then I'd like to return to the school zone\nexample -- the fact that Congress put in \"without lawful\nauthority\" and enclosed it with commas I think simply\nreflects that Congress understood that, by inserting\nthat phrase between transitive verbs and the direct\nobject, it was interrupting the natural flow of the\nsentence. And I don't think it means -- so the first\ncomma may tell the reader to pause, but the second comma\nI think just as clearly indicates to the reader that the\nflow of the sentence continues.\nAnd so that I don't think you would say a\nsentence that says, John knowingly used without\npermission a pair of scissors of his mother's. You\nwould still read that to mean that John knew that the\nscissors he was using belonged to his mother. That the\ninsertion of the parenthetical I think indicates that\nCongress knew it could put it at the end and not change\nthe meaning or put it here.\nBut when Congress intends to write a statute\nthat -- that holds people strictly liable for\naggravating circumstances or writes something like the\nquantity provisions where, in subsection (b), Congress\nsets out the punishment that is deserving because of\nthat aggravating factor, and it does not include a mens\nrea requirement in subsection (b). And in the school\nzone provision, Congress likewise has no mens rea\nrequirement with respect to the knowledge of the person\nbeing in a school zone.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What about the\ngovernment's argument in this case that Congress was\nreally going after people who have false identification\nbecause of its concern to protect the victim, that is\nthe person whose number is misused? So the government\nis urging that we take a victim-centered approach to the\nstatute.\nMR. RUSSELL: I do think it's a fair point,\nthat this was a statute that was concerned with victims.\nLots of criminal statutes are. But we don't ordinarily\nread it -- Congress doesn't ordinarily enact even\nvictim-focused statutes without mens rea requirements,\nand courts don't ordinarily narrowly construe them, even\nthough it's true that omitting mens rea requirements or\nnarrowly construing them furthers the purpose of\nprotecting of the victim. In fact, by far more -- far\nmore commonly, as the LaFave treatise that we cite to\nyou explains, we don't hold defendants criminally\nstrictly liable for all of the consequences of their\ncrimes. It gives the example of somebody who breaks\ninto a house intending to rob it and accidentally sets\nit on fire -- you know, they're engaged in unlawful\nconduct to start with -- and so they're not fully to\nblame there, but nonetheless we don't hold them\ncriminally liable for arson because they didn't intend\nit.\nNow, Congress could make a choice. Congress\ncould choose to hold that arsonist strictly liable -- or\nthe robbery suspect strictly liable for the arson, just\nas Congress could hold defendants like Petitioner\nstrictly liable for the fact that he ends up using an\nidentification that belongs to somebody else.\nBut our point is simply there are reasons\nwhy Congress might not do that, including the nominalist\nkind of penalties that end up being meted out here,\nwhere you have people -- two people with identical\nculpability ending up with substantially different\npunishments, or people with substantially different\nculpability ending up with identical punishments.\nYou have the classic aggravated identity\nthief who breaks into a bank account using a means of\nidentification he knows belongs to somebody else. It's\nexactly the same sentence, under the government's view,\nas somebody like Petitioner who just unknowingly used a\nnumber in order to get a job.\nNow, it's not impossible that Congress could\nmake that policy choice, but when it does it tends to\nwrite statutes that look very different than this. It\nwrites ones that look like -- that are quantity statutes\nthat I just read or the school zone statute.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: It's not a clear -- what\n-- what if the accused knowingly uses a card --\nidentity belonging to a dead person? Is that a real\nperson?\nMR. RUSSELL: I think that's an open\nquestion in the circuits. Some circuits have said that\nit has to be a means of identification belonging to a\nliving person, but that's -- that's not settled.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: What is your view?\nMR. RUSSELL: My view -- I mean, the statute\nsays \"of another person.\" I think you would ordinarily\npresume that to mean a live person. But ultimately, I\nguess, it really doesn't matter to the outcome of my\ncase.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, it does, though, in\na way, because I understand your theory is there are two\nbasic kinds of crimes. You just use the document for\nyour own source if you want to get the job or you want\nentry into the country or something like that. That's a\nminor crime. But if you are -- it's identity theft\nwhere you are pretending to be somebody else so you can\nget advantage of his credit and his assets and his\naccess to computers. That's a much more serious crime.\nNow, if it's a dead person, it seems to me\nto be in the former category, rather than in the latter.\nMR. RUSSELL: That's true. Certainly, using\nthe identification of a dead person doesn't impose the\nkind of harms on real victims that Congress seemed to be\nmost focused on in this case. And certainly, our\ninterpretation of the statute we don't think unduly\ninterferes with that protective function, precisely\nbecause the government ought to, in a great many cases,\nvery easily show that the way that the person used the\nmeans of identification shows that they knew that it\nbelonged to somebody else.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: His conduct would amount\nto identity -- what did it say -- is there a crime of\nidentity fraud?\nMR. RUSSELL: Well, that's what we have been\nusing to refer to the underlying predicate offense here,\nwhich is the misuse of the immigration documents. But\nthat's -- that applies whenever somebody uses an\nimmigration document -- and there is another statute for\nSocial Security cards -- that doesn't belong to them.\nAnd the government only has to prove that they knew that\nit didn't belong them. And that in itself is a\nsubstantial protection for people who might be unknowing\nvictims or victims of somebody like my client. He is\nsubstantially deterred from risking their credit by the\nmere fact that he is going to face a substantial penalty\nfor using the false document in and of itself. So --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: It would be equally false\nif the Social Security number were fictitious -- it\ndidn't belong to --\nMR. RUSSELL: Didn't belong to anybody.\nThat's correct.\nIf I could reserve the remainder of my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.\nRussell.\nMr. Heytens.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF TOBY J. HEYTENS\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. HEYTENS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nIt is common ground that there are at least\nthree preconditions to liability under 18 U.S.C. section\n1028A(a)(1): First and foremost, the defendant must\ncommit one of the separate predicate felonies that are\nspecifically enumerated in subsection (c). Second,\nduring the commission of that felony, the defendant must\nuse something that is in fact a means of identification\nof another person. And, third, that use of the means of\nidentification of another person must itself be without\nlawful authority and must have the effect of\nfacilitating the defendant's commission of the\nunderlying predicate felony.\nThe question in this case is whether the\ngovernment must also show that the defendant was\nspecifically aware that the means of identification that\nhe uses to facilitate his underlying crime was that of\nanother person. And the answer to that question is no.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Heytens, did the\nprosecutor give the right answer to Judge Friedman in\nthe district court when Judge Friedman asked: Where I\ntake two people and one of them gets false Social\nSecurity cards and it happens that the number belongs to\nno live person, and another person goes to the same\noutfit, but the card that he gets does belong to a live\nperson -- he doesn't know in either case -- did the\nprosecutor give the right answer when he said, when it\nturns out to be a fictitious number, no two-year add-on,\nbut if it turns out to be a real number, two years'\nmandatory addition? The prosecutor says, yes, that's\nthe difference. Was that the right answer?\nMR. HEYTENS: Yes, it was. If I could\nexplain, the first -- the reason that the first\ndefendant is not guilty, is that it is an absolute\nprecondition for liability under this statute that the\nmeans of identification in question be that of another\nperson.\nSo there are no victimless violations of\n1028(a)(1), because if we are having this conversation\nat all, there was a real victim involved in the case.\nThe reason the second individual is --\nJUSTICE ALITO: If I could just interrupt\nyou, why does \"of another individual\" -- why can't that\nbe read to mean \"of a person other than the person who\nis using the identification,\" whether this other person\nis real or not?\nMR. HEYTENS: Justice Alito, I think the\nanswer to that relates to the definition of \"means of\nidentification,\" which is reproduced in the appendix to\nour brief. I believe it's 4a. That's 18 U.S.C.\n1028(d)(7). The definition of \"means of identification\"\nmeans \"any name or number that may be used, alone or in\nconjunction, to identify a specific individual.\" And we\nunderstand that, especially in conjunction with the\nwords \"of another person,\" to require, at least under\n1028A(a)(1), that we have to be talking about a real\nindividual.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Heytens, this raises\nthe question I was talking to your opponent about. Do\nyou think that Congress intended there to be a more\nsevere punishment for somebody who really steals another\nperson's -- knowingly steals somebody else's identity so\nhe can cash in on his credit and so forth? It seems to\nme, arguably, that's the important difference.\nMR. HEYTENS: Justice Stevens, I agree that\na person who deliberately sets out to misappropriate the\nidentity of a known individual is almost certainly more\nculpable than someone who does not do it but\ninadvertently does so.\nBut I don't think that is controlling in\nthis case for a very important reason, and the very\nimportant reason -- again, to go back to what I said at\nthe outset -- is we are not having this conversation\nunless the defendant has already committed the predicate\nfelony, and he is subject to punishment for that\npredicate felony. For example, in this case, the\npredicate felony subjected Mr. Flores-Figueroa to a term\nof up to 10 years of imprisonment, above and beyond the\ntwo years.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yeah, but I think -- I\nthought that argument cut against you, because what you\nare saying is everybody is on the hook. There's a basic\nproblem here, which iis -- I will call it identity\nfraud -- and yet you get an extra two years if it just\nso happens that the number you picked out of the air\nbelonged to somebody else.\nMR. HEYTENS: I understand how from the\ndefendant's perspective -- to use the Justice -- the\nexample that Justice Ginsburg used as well, but it may\nseem from the defendant's perspective that he just so\nhappened to take a real person's number. But I think\nthe critical fact here is that it not really seemed that\nway from the perspective of the real individual whose\nnumber he ended up using. And I think that's the\ncritically important fact.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, I think that's what\nwe normally bring into sentencing. I mean, normally,\nand that we don't impose mandatory. We impose mandatory\nsentences when the person does something, you know,\nthat's wrong and he knows it is wrong.\nWhen harm occurs, and the harm wasn't known\nor intended, you can take care of it if you are a judge.\nYou increase the sentence. That's the problem.\nMR. HEYTENS: Justice Breyer, my answer to\nyour question and probably only of interest to those\nmembers of the court who find legislative history\nprobative, but I think for those who do, the very\nsignificant answer to that is that the one thing the\nlegislative history makes very clear is that at least\nsome members of Congress believed that judicially\ndiscretionary sentences before this statute were enacted\nwere failing to adequately take into account the harm\nsuffered by real victims.\nThere is very clear legislative briefs to\nthat effect. The statement of just leaving up to the\njudge to take into account the impact --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- history, do you know\nwhat people who are stealing identities of people who\nhave been bilked or -- I think that --\nMR. HEYTENS: I certainly agree, Justice\nStevens, that there is a portion of the House report\nthat lists nine specific cases in which Congress -- of\nwhich some members of Congress -- people obviously\nreport -- made the judgment that people who would engage\nin the sort of conduct that Congress wants to reach had\nreceived short sentences under the previous regime.\nThere are nine specific examples given in the House\nreport.\nI acknowledge freely that eight of those\nnine examples very clearly by the description involve\nindividuals who must have known that they were using --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, why not just says\n\"means of identification,\" then? I mean, it's odd to\nwrite a statute that has elements and you put the word\n\"knowingly,\" and the knowingly is supposed to modify\nsome elements but not others. I can't think of other\nstatutes that do that. There may be some.\nIt's pretty peculiar. You could have left\noff the last element. I mean, if you are drafting a\ncriminal statute, anyone would know that.\nMR. HEYTENS: There are two responses to\nthat, Justice Breyer. First of all, Congress has\nwritten in some statutes that clearly increase the --\nthat know -- it doesn't go all the way through, because\nthey repeat the knowingly requirement in those statutes.\nFor example -- and it's the appendix to the\nreply, Appendix G, at page 23A, the appendix to the\nreply brief, that reproduces 18 U.S.C. 922(q)(2)(A),\nwhich is a statute that repeats another one of the\nrequirements in the text of the statute, which under\nPetitioner's argument doesn't make any sense at all. He\nwould just --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Give me one where what they\nhave done is they have used \"knowingly\" at the\nbeginning, and there are four elements of the crime, and\n-- I'm not saying there are none, but I would like to\nknow what they are where \"knowingly\" doesn't modify\nsomething there is strict liability for.\nMR. HEYTENS: Sure. I mean --\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's going to be\njurisdictional -- probably jurisdictional hooks, like --\nthere could be -- there could be some. But I don't\nsee -- you tell me.\nMR. HEYTENS: I will give you two. There's\nthe statute that is at issue before this Court in\nMorissette v. United States, and it's the statute that\nwas construed by the D.C. Circuit in an opinion by\nJustice Ginsburg in United States v. Chin.\nThe statute in Morissette says, \"knowingly\nconverts his use anything of value of the United\nStates.\" In Morissette, this Court held the defendant\nhad to have knowledge of the facts sufficient to make\nhis conduct a conversion. He has to know that the\nproperty has an owner, that it is not abandoned, and he\nhas to known that the owner is not him.\nBut the lower courts have uniformly held\nthat under that statute the defendant does not need to\nknow that the property in question belonged to the\nUnited States.\nOr take the Chin statute. The Chin statute\nsays \"knowingly and intentionally uses, hires or employs\na person under the age of 18 to avoid detection of drug\ntrafficking crime.\"\nIn Chin the D.C. Circuit said in every other\ncourt of appeals who have considered the question has\nsaid the defendant does not need to be specifically\naware that the individual in question is less than 18\nyears old.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But the reason for that is\nthat it is an equally culpable act where you steal\nsomething off of a field than Morissette. I agree the\nMorissette case supports you, even though they relied on\nit, which is interesting to me. But that's a -- you are\ndistinguishing between two equally culpable acts. It\ndoesn't even make any difference whether he knew the\nowner was some private farmer or the United States.\nIn this case, you have got two really big\ncategories of different kinds, and instead they are\ntreated alike is the thing that troubles me here.\nMR. HEYTENS: Justice Stevens, I get a\nMorissette -- the hypothetical defendant standpoint of\nMr. Morissette. It doesn't really depend on whether he\nknows the property belongs to the Federal Government or\nhe thinks he is stealing from his neighbor. He is a bad\nperson either way.\nI don't think that is true of the Chin\nstatute, though I tend make a very strong argument that\nsomeone who deliberately employs someone that he has --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: You can do it in this\nstatute. That is the point.\nMR. HEYTENS: Sure. Under this statute I\nthink the significance is, first and foremost, we are\nnot having this discussion unless he has already\ncommitted an underlying -- felony.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Even that isn't -- I mean,\nhere you are treating it as if it is a separate thing.\nThat is fair enough. And what are the words \"of another\nperson\" doing there if really they are not supposed to\nmake any difference in terms of mental state?\nMR. HEYTENS: What they are doing there\nis -- this goes back to my point this is the victim,\nbut, in fact, what they are doing there is to say this\nstatute does not apply unless the names or numbers in\nquestion is actually that of a specific individual.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I could understand your\nargument if you are saying you cannot tell from the tell\nsimply from the text what the answer is. You can only\ntell the answer if you say -- know what the answer is if\nyou say Congress had victims in mind, and if we are\ngoing to worry about victims, we are not going to\nworry -- we are going to take a narrow rather than a\nbroad view of \"knowingly.\"\nIf that's your position, you agree that if\nyou simply look at the text of this statute without\nconsidering confessional policy, you don't win?\nMR. HEYTENS: We don't concede that the text\nof the statute alone unambiguously resolves the issue --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Does it -- does it even\ncome close to supporting it? I mean, let's start out\nwith your analogous position. Your analogous position\nis that the \"knowingly\" simply refers to the -- the --\nthe three acts which are specified by which the\nidentification can be -- can be -- the misidentification\ncan be perpetrated.\nTransfers, possesses or uses. Could\nCongress possibly have said, gee, he might not know that\nhe was acting to transfer or to possess or to use. That\nis not the serious possibility. So, \"knowingly\" has to\nrefer to something more than the three possible acts.\nAnd once you get beyond the three possible\nacts, and you say, well, we are going to draw the line\nbetween \"without authority\" and \"another person,\" that\nseems like an arbitrary line. And the arbitrariness of\nthe line seems even more obvious when the \"without a\nlawful authority\" is set off as a parenthetical. And\nthe real logic of the statute -- the real -- the\noperative description is \"a means of identification of\nanother person.\"\nThat's why, it seems to me, if you look at\nthe text, you could say, well, of course, the\n\"knowingly\" has got to refer to the everything that\nfollows, both lawful authority and another person.\nAnd that's why, it seems to me, if you are\ngoing to win, you have got to win on the grounds that\nCongress wouldn't have meant what seems so natural,\nbecause Congress wanted to help victims not defendants.\nWhere am I going wrong there, if I'm going\nwrong?\nMR. HEYTENS: I think, as I said before, we\ndo not contend that this statutory text standing along\nambiguously supports our position enough to terminate\nthe inquiry. And I certainly agree that the purpose is\nan important part of our argument.\nI think there are two important things to --\nbriefly, two of the things you said there. Once you\nextend \"knowingly\" to about -- I think the significance\nis with the effect of once you extend \"knowingly,\" first\nto \"lawful authority\" and then to the \"use of\nidentification.\"\nOnce you extend it to \"without lawful\nauthority,\" any conceivable argument that the other side\ncan have about criminalizing innocent or inadvertent\nconduct disappears, because then at that point the\ndefendant knows specifically that he is acting in manner\nthat is contrary to law.\nAnd then second, if --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Is it worth two years?\nMR. HEYTENS: I think -- I think it is.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: The only thing that we know\nfor sure that is that Congress said it is not worth two\nyears extra unless that of another person was involved.\nAnd if that is so significant or necessarily significant\nin getting a two-year add-on, then it seems reasonable,\nI suppose, that Congress -- the state of mind -- that.\nMR. HEYTENS: Well, I think, first of all,\nat that point the defendant already has two different\nculpable states of mind. He has the culpable state of\nmind to commit the underlying felony and he has the\nculpable state of mind with regard to -- now, I agree\nwith you, Justice Souter, there's argument you can make\nboth ways as a matter of policy. I think so -- some of\nthe policy with my colleague on the other side\nillustrates why Congress would have made the decision it\ndid.\nAnd it's all of those pieces what the\ndefendant is reckless, where the defendant is willfully\nignorant or the defendant simply doesn't know because --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: All Congress has got to do\nis to say \"recklessly.\"\nMR. HEYTENS: It is certainly true that\nCongress has --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: It's an -- it's an accepted\nterm. Every -- well, almost everybody knows what -- is\na model Penal Code standard, and so on. All they have\nto do is put the word \"recklessly\" in there. It would\ncover every \"knowingly\" case. It wouldn't omit anything\nthat is covered by this, and it would solve precisely\nthat problem. And they didn't do it.\nMR. HEYTENS: I certainly agree there are\nother ways that Congress could have written the statute\nto make it clear. But I think it -- they could have\nwritten the statute in a way that would be more clear,\nboth that would resolve the case in favor of the\nPetitioner, and it would resolve the case in favor of\nus. So I don't know how that cuts either way.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, I tell you what cuts\none way or another. I -- I find it -- I find it, well,\nnot surprising because I have heard -- I have heard the\ngovernment do it before. You acknowledge that this is\nan ambiguous statute. That -- that on its face it -- it\ncould mean the one thing or the other.\nI would normally conclude from that that we\napply the Rule of Lenity. Since it could go either way,\nlet's assume that the defendant gets the -- the tie goes\nto the defendant. What -- why shouldn't I resolve it\nthat way?\nMR. HEYTENS: Well, under the Rule of\nLenity, Justice Scalia, the tie does go to the\ndefendant. But, as the Court has made clear again and\nagain including in its opinion in Hayes, the fact that\nthe statutory text has a certain amount of ambiguity\ndoesn't automatically trigger the Rule of Lenity. The\nRule of Lenity --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Shouldn't it --\nshouldn't it -- is it time to revisit the Court's\ndecision in Hayes?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. HEYTENS: The Court -- what the Court\nsaid yesterday in Hayes is precisely what it said before\nin Liparota. The Rule of Lenity comes into play at the\nend of the proper statutory interpretation after you\nconsider text, purpose, legislative history, and all\nother --\nJUSTICE BREYER: All that is true, and that\nis actually where I was going. It -- it seems to me\nwhere the ambiguity is precisely -- is that none of us\ndoubts, I don't think, that what Congress is after with\nthis extra two-year mandatory is identity theft.\nAnd where the argument lies is between did\nCongress do this by punishing people only who intend to\nengage in identity theft or people who, while not\nintending to do so, have that effect. That's the issue.\nMR. HEYTENS: I think that is --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And I don't thing I can\nresolve that one way or the other from anything you have\nsaid. It is rather hard to say. So, therefore, suppose\nI use the Rule of Lenity this way, which I am trying\nout. I am not buying it.\nIn the case of mandatory-minimum sentences,\nthere is a particularly strong argument for a Rule of\nLenity with bite. And that is because mandatory\nminimums, given the human condition, inevitably throw\nsome people into the box who shouldn't be there. And if\nthis person should be there and we put him outside, the\njudge could give him the same sentence anyway.\nSo the harm by mistakenly throwing a person\noutside the box through the Rule of Lenity to the\ngovernment is small. The harm to the individual by\nwrongly throwing him into the box is great. The Rule of\nLenity is, therefore, limited to a very small subset of\ncases where it has particular force, but this is one of\nthem.\nMR. HEYTENS: Justice Breyer, I -- I guess\nwhat I would say first and foremost is I -- I would -- I\nthink that would be a fairly significant\nreconceptualization of the purpose of the Rule of\nLenity.\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's why I raised it.\nMR. HEYTENS: Right. The Court -- if I can\njust explain why I think that is --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You have to rename it the\nrule of, you know, who gets hurt the most or something.\nMR. HEYTENS: The rule -- the Court has said\nover and over again that the two purposes of the Rule of\nLenity are providing fair warning to people before their\nconduct subjects them to criminal punishment and to\ndemonstrate the proper respect for the lawmaking powers\nof Congress. I don't think the fact that a statute\nimposes a mandatory minimum triggers either one of those\nconcerns in and of itself.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Then what about the --\nthe even division -- I think it is an even division, 3/3\n-- is it a 3/3 split? And if you wanted one indication\nthat this statute is indeed grievously ambiguous, it is\nthat -- that good minds have reached opposite\nconclusions with well-reasoned decisions on both sides.\nSo it seems to me that this is a very strong argument\nthat this is an ambiguous statute, unusually so.\nAnd I factor into that the answer that was\ngiven to Judge Friedman's question, which astonished me\nthe first time I read it: That the prosecutor would\nsay, Your Honor, I am saying no different degree of\nculpability. One happened to get a fictitious number;\nthe other happened to get a real number; two years for\nthe second one. There is no difference at all in the\nstate of mind of -- of the two defendants. That's --\nthat's why I think the -- the ambiguity argument is\nstrong. Why in the world would Congress want to draw\nsuch a line?\nMR. HEYTENS: Well, again, if I could --\nthere are several things there. If I could start with\nthe last one, why would Congress want to draw such a\nline, I think the reason Congress would want to draw\nsuch a line is for several reasons.\nFirst and foremost is the fundamentally\nfix-and-focus nature of this statute. And I -- I agree\nthat at least on first blush that Judge Friedman's\npolicy does strike a number of people as implausible.\nBut I think if you step back, things like\nthat are not uncommon throughout the criminal law. The\n-- the precise same objection could be made to the\nexistence of the felony-murder rule. Two people go out\nto engage in precisely the same unlawful course of\nconduct. Neither one of them wants to kill anybody, and\nneither one of them wants anyone to get hurt. In one of\nthem the gun goes off, and in one of them the gun\ndoesn't go off. And one of them is now guilty of felony\nmurder, and the other one is guilty of -- of robbery,\nwhich is admittedly a serious crime but not as serious\nof a crime as murder. There are other examples of that.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes, but in this\nparticular case, when you talk about identity theft, it\nis inconceivable the defendant would not know about fact\nthat there is another person involved. And so the --\nthe mens rea issue is easy in this case. The only time\nit's -- it's difficult is when he didn't -- when he did\nnot use it for an identity-theft purpose.\nMR. HEYTENS: Well, I think I -- if I\nunderstand the question correctly, I think there are\ncertainly many cases in which the manner in which the\ndefendant uses the means of identification will, itself,\nprovide powerful circumstantial evidence that he knows\nthere is, in fact, another person. Because otherwise\nthe action won't make any sense.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And those are the category\nof cases in which Congress wanted to have a more severe\npenalty.\nMR. HEYTENS: I certainly agree that those\nare actually some of the categories of cases. I -- I --\nwhat I guess I disagree about is that those are the only\ncategory of cases. And I -- I can try another tack on\nthat.\nWhen you -- when you review the -- the House\nreport, the legislative history that talks about the\nreason, the background, the need for the legislation,\nCongress repeatedly trots out a great many statistics\nabout the number of people who are victimized by\nidentity theft, the amount of dollar harm that is caused\nto people and businesses by identity theft, and --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: In any of those cases did\nthey talk about unknowing identity theft?\nMR. HEYTENS: What I guess I am saying,\nJustice Stevens, is in none of those cases did Congress\n-- when it was trotting out those statistics did\nCongress distinguish between situations in which the\nvictim was able to determine whether the defendant knew\nthat he existed. I mean --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Is this in the statute?\nMR. HEYTENS: It is not in the context of\nthe statute, Justice Scalia.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, let's not say\nCongress, then. Does -- does the Committee?\nMR. HEYTENS: The Committee report, I\napologize, Justice Scalia. The Committee report --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: You might not convince\nJustice Scalia of this, but you might convince me.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. HEYTENS: What I am saying is when the\ncourts were talking about the harm suffered by -- the\namount of harm, in the course of talking about the\nnumber of people who report that they were victims,\nthere is no distinction made whatsoever based on the\ndistinction that the Petitioner would like to draw. And\nI think there is a very good, practical reason for that.\nA person who discovers that there is a\nproblem with their Social Security number having been\nmisused, for example, by someone, that person is almost\ncertainly not going to be able to figure out whether the\nperson who used their Social Security number knows that\nthey exist or not. All they know is that problems are\nnow showing up on their credit reports. All they know\nis they are getting questions from the Social Security\nAdministration. About this earned income that they\nhaven't paid taxes on, for example. The person who is\nin the position of the victim is not well positioned to\ndetermine how the perpetrator got hold of their\nidentifying information.\nIf I could go back --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but in that\ncase you tell them, look, the person's got 10 years.\nRight? If they find the guy, he is going to face up to\n10 years for identity fraud.\nMR. HEYTENS: He is going to face up to\n10 years, Mr. Chief Justice. I think that's the\nimportant thing. I think Congress rationally could have\nbeen concerned that the guy is not actually going to get\n10 years because there was evidence before them that the\nperson was not getting 10 years, that the person was\nbeing, at least in the judgment of some people, not\nreceiving sufficient punishment to reflect that, that\nthere was a real person who was harmed by the conduct --\nthat was harmed by the conduct that eventually had an\nadverse impact on him.\nI think that fundamentally was the\nmotivating force behind the statute, the need to have a\nstatute that takes adequate and discreet account for the\npresence of real victims. Now the Petitioner, for\nexample, refers to the statement of having a\nmethod-statute excuse, as having a mandatory minimum.\nIt's not correct to say the statute has a mandatory\nminimum. This statute has a mandatory, discreet,\nprescribed punishment. It is not two years up to\nsomething else. It is two years, and exactly two years.\nAnd I think that's highly significant.\nBecause I think what it says is that Congress thought\nthere was a discreet measure of punishment that was\nappropriate to reflect the presence of a real victim.\nThe fact that there is a real victim gets you two years.\nYou get whatever else you get on your underlying felony,\nwhich can take into account all sorts of other\nconsiderations about your crime, but the fact that there\nwas a discreet victim is an independent harm to that\nperson that should be taken into account in imposing\ncriminal punishment.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You could also say you get\ntwo years for knowing that there is a discreet victim.\nI mean -- I -- you can describe it either way.\nMR. HEYTENS: You certainly can.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And it makes sense either\nway.\nMR. HEYTENS: You certainly can describe it\neither way, but I think in light of the concern that the\nharms to real victims are not being adequately taken\ninto account, it doesn't seem to us to make sense to\nmake the presence of that additional punishment turn on\nwhether the defendant is specifically aware that the\nvictim existed, and I think at the end of the --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You -- you gave earlier\nthe felony murder example of the one who, the gun goes\noff, he didn't mean to kill anybody. But I thought\nhomicide is -- it's an answer to your argument that this\nstatute was entirely victim-centered, because a person\nis just as dead if he's the victim of a reckless driver\nas a premeditated murder, and yet we certainly\ndistinguish the penalties in those cases, no matter that\nthe harm was identical.\nMR. HEYTENS: We certainly do, Justice\nGinsburg, and we don't make the extravagant claim that\nlaw doesn't look to relative moral culpability in\nassigning criminal punishment. I'm responding to the\nargument on the other side that that's all the law ever\nlooks to. The law frequently looks to two different\nthings; it looks to relative culpability levels, but it\nalso looks at the existence of harm. If you want to\ncontinue with the homicide example, if you look at moral\nculpability, two people who both intentionally attempt\nto cause the death of another human being without any\nlegal excuse for doing so, from a culpability standpoint\nthey engaged in precisely the same level of moral wrong;\nbut law treats attempted murder and completed murder\nextremely differently from one another. And that's\nbecause in one case, as Justice Ginsburg points out, you\nhave a real victim, a person dies; there is a discreet\nlevel of harm to the victim that is not -- that does not\noccur when fortunately the person who tries to kill\nsomeone else fails.\nAnd I think at the end of the day that is\nthe most important issue in this case. You see this\nargument again and again and again, especially in the\ncircuits -- let me go back to Justice Ginsburg's point\nabout the three circuits that have gone either way.\nFirst, as a -- as just a threshold matter,\nthis Court has said repeatedly that the fact that courts\nhave disagreed about the proper interpretation of a\nstatute doesn't suffice to trigger the rule of lenity,\nbecause this Court almost never takes a case where there\nis not a circuit split. And to say the existence of a\ncircuit split makes the statute ambiguous would mean\nthat the criminal defendant wins every time; and the\nCourt has not said that.\nBut -- but also I think where those courts\nhave fundamentally gone wrong is they have essentially\nsaid this is a crime about theft; theft requires you to\nknow that there is a real owner; if you don't know there\nis a real owner, that is not theft. And I think where\nthey went wrong was at the very beginning.\nWhere they went wrong at the very beginning\nis asking the question of whether it is natural to refer\nto someone like Petitioner as a thief. We think the\nmore appropriate question as the district court said in\nGodin is whether it would be at all unusual to refer to\nthe two innocent people whose Social Security number and\nalien registration number Petitioner used to facilitate\nhis two underlying felonies were the victims of identity\ntheft.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, the problem\nwith that is the statute says identity theft; it doesn't\nsay anything about victims.\nMR. HEYTENS: It certainty does, Mr. Chief\nJustice, but it says identity theft; it says -- not\n\"theft,\" and I think the question is whether you refer\nto those people as having -- identity theft occurred in\nthis case. And I think if you look at from the victim's\nperspective, which we think the perspective that\nCongress was looking at it from, the answer to that\nquestion is yes. And for that reason we ask that the\njudgment of the Eighth Circuit be affirmed. Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nFour minutes, Mr. Russell.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF KEVIN K. RUSSELL\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. RUSSELL: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nI would like to address just a couple of\nquick questions about the text, and then -- other issues\nas appropriate.\nJustice Breyer, you asked if there were\nexamples of other statutes in which knowledge\nrequirements didn't extend to all the elements, but the\ngovernment gave two examples. The first, Morissette, is\nclearly an example with a jurisdictional element. All\nof the circuit courts that say that the knowledge\nrequirement doesn't extend to, of the United States, do\nso on the grounds that because there is a jurisdictional\nelements and jurisdictional elements don't extend --\ndon't require mens rea.\nWith respect to the Chin example, I do\nacknowledge that there -- there is a decision that this\nCourt hasn't reviewed in which the D.C. Circuit says it\ndoesn't extend to the age of the victim. That falls\nwithin a category of special cases where courts have\ntreated the victimization of children differently, in\npart because it's so difficult and nearly impossible to\ngroup the defendant's knowledge of the age of the\nvictim.\nThat kind of practical barrier simply\ndoesn't exist here for all the reasons we've discussed\nearlier about the government's ability to rely on\ncircumstantial evidence to show the defendant's state of\nmind here.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: There aren't too many\n15-year olds who look like they're over 21?\nMR. RUSSELL: That's right.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. RUSSELL: That's right. With respect to\nthe victim-focused nature of this, again, it's true that\n-- that criminal law takes into account both defendant\nculpability and harm to victims; but the ordinary\nresolution is to reserve punishment in the criminal\nsystem for those who intend the harms that they inflict.\nThere are, of course, exceptions like felony murder. As\nthe history of this points out, that kind of treatment\ntends to be reserved for serious bodily injury or death\nkinds of harm, and there is no reason to think that\nCongress thought, although identity theft is serious,\nthat this fell within that kind of category of\nexceptions. There are of course these other exceptions\nwhere Congress relies on facts not known to the\ndefendant for sentencing enhancement, but as I've\nmentioned earlier, it tends to write those statutes in a\nway that makes clear that those enhancement factors are\nseparate and apart from the underlying events, and they\ndon't include an expressed mens rea requirement then.\nThe government has to say that any case, any statute\nthat looks like this, that has been treated as a\nsentencing enhancement provision.\nFinally, with respect to the rule of lenity,\nthe government I think has acknowledged that the\nstatutory text is at least ambiguous with respect to\nwhether or not it compels their conclusion. They\nacknowledge that you can make policy arguments both ways\nabout what would be a good idea about how to treat this\nkind of conduct, and I think regardless of your view of\nwhat the trigger of the rule of lenity is, this is a\nclassic case for it.\nIf Congress intended the government's\ninterpretation, the government is free to go back to\nCongress, and there is every reason to believe that\nCongress will be receptive. The problem with\noverconstruing a mandatory sentence or a mandatory\nminimum, as Justice Breyer was alluding to, is that it\ndoes have this particularly harsh effect, and one that\nis as a practical matter hard to undo in the legislative\nprocess, which as the Court has recognized, is another\nfunction served by the rule of lenity.\nIf the Court has no further questions.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
