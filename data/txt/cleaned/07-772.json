COLLINS\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. COLLINS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThis case comes before the Court under the\ndeferential standard of review of the Antiterrorism and\nEffective Death Penalty Act. The Ninth Circuit decision\nshould be reversed because the Washington court's\nadjudication of this matter was not objectively\nunreasonable. The Washington court concluded that the\ninstruction at issue properly informed the jury of the\nelements of accomplice liability, and the prosecutor's\nargument informed the jury that it could only convict\nSarausad if he acted with knowledge he was facilitating\nthe commission of a homicide.\nThe court also concluded that the trial\njudge did not abuse his discretion in directing the jury\nto reread the relevant instructions instead of giving\nthe supplemental instruction proposed by Sarausad. The\ndecision below was not an unreasonable application of\nclearly established Federal law.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But you think it was\nright?\nMR. COLLINS: I do think it was right, Your\nHonor, but I also believe that it was not objectively\nunreasonable, which is the standard before this Court.\nTurning to the PRP court's adjudication, the --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: First, is there some\nconstitutional minimum? Let's assume direct review. Is\nthere some constitutional minimum requirement for\nscienter with reference to an accomplice?\nMR. COLLINS: I believe there is, Your\nHonor.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: What is it?\nMR. COLLINS: You have to have knowledge\nthat you're facilitating -- you have to act and you have\nto have knowledge, both those two points.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Is that the same -- is\nthat the same as purpose?\nMR. COLLINS: I think it is, Your Honor. I\nthink the model -- I think the Model Penal Code refers\n-- uses the term \"purpose\" as opposed to \"knowledge,\"\nbut I don't think --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but you don't take\nthe position, do you, or do you, that Washington law\nconforms to the Model Penal Code? I thought the Model\nPenal Code was much more defendant-friendly than you're\nstating.\nMR. COLLINS: I believe that's correct, Your\nHonor.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So you're -- would --\nwould you say that the trial court in Washington states\nlaw correctly if it says that being accomplice you have\nto have a purpose to facilitate the commission of the\ncrime?\nMR. COLLINS: I believe that you would have\nto have -- you have to knowingly facilitate the crime,\nYour Honor. That's the --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But you agree there is a\ndifference in \"knowing\" and \"purpose\"?\nMR. COLLINS: I'm not sure there is much of\na difference, Your Honor. Frankly, I haven't thought\nabout that question, but I think you have to have that\nmental component. You have to either have purpose or\nyou have to do it with knowledge.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But the question is\nknowledge of what. And I thought it is now recognized\nthat in this State you have to know not just that a\ncrime -- you have to know in this case of the potential\nfor a homicide.\nMR. COLLINS: That's right, Justice\nGinsburg. You have to know -- you have to act with\nknowledge that you are facilitating a homicide.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why just a homicide? What\nwas -- what was the indictment here? What was he tried\nfor?\nMR. COLLINS: First degree -- a number of\ncounts, Your Honor. First degree murder, second degree\nmurder, attempted first degree murder, first degree\nassault with a deadly weapon, because there was one\ndeath and two people were shot -- wounded and then there\nwas --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why wouldn't assault with a\ndeadly weapon suffice or, alternatively, why would you\nhave to know that it was first degree murder or second\ndegree murder? I don't know how you get from the text\nof the Washington statute that all you have to know is\nthat it was a homicide?\nMR. COLLINS: Because the statute refers to\n\"the crime,\" so you have to have knowledge that you're\nfacilitating a homicide, but you don't have to have\nshared --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But -- but he wasn't\nprosecuted for homicide. I mean, the crimes are much\nmore specific --\nMR. COLLINS: Well --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- first degree murder,\nsecond degree murder.\nMR. COLLINS: In Washington, you have to\nhave knowledge of the general crime that is homicide,\nbut you don't have to have the same knowledge as to\nprinciple; therefore, you don't have to have knowledge\nof premediation. You just have to have knowledge that\nyou're going to commit the general -- the general crime.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: How does that appear from\nthe statute? If I read the statute, I would have\nthought that you have to have knowledge that he was --\nwould negligent homicide suffice?\nMR. COLLINS: You could be convicted of\nmanslaughter as an accomplice if you had knowledge of a\nhomicide. You have to have general knowledge of the\ncrime.\nLet me give you another example. In the\nDavis case, for example, this was a robbery case, and\nthe defendants agreed to do a robbery, but the person\nwho went into the store had a gun. The accomplice\ndidn't know that he had a gun, but still he was\nconvicted of armed robbery because he had a general\nknowledge that robbery was going to be committed. On\nthe other hand, if the principal had shot the store\nowner, the defendant would not be an accomplice to\nmurder if his only knowledge was that he was\nfacilitating the crime of robbery.\nSo you have to have knowledge that you're\nfacilitating the general crime charged. In this case\ncrimes charged were various kinds of homicides, first\ndegree murder, attempted murder. And in this case, the\nrecord is very clear that the prosecutor argued that\nMr. Sarausad acted with knowledge that he was\nfacilitating a homicide. Therefore, the PRP court's\nadjudication of that point is not objectively\nunreasonable under the AEDPA standard.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: This is -- the\nprosecutor's charge -- the prosecutor's charge was just\nfilled with the suggestion that as long as it was a\ncrime, that was sufficient. I don't find that what\nyou've said is an accurate description of the charge --\nMR. COLLINS: Your Honor --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- of the prosecutor's\nsummation.\nMR. COLLINS: Your Honor, the prosecutor\ncontinually talked about the fact that they were going\nthere for the shooting. For example, in the -- the\njoint appendix, the brown brief on page 123, the\nprosecutor tells the jury when they rode down to Ballard\nHigh School the last time, \"I say they knew what they\nwere up to. Fists didn't work. Pushing didn't work.\nShouting insults didn't work. Shooting was going to\nwork. In for a dime, in for a dollar.\"\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but isn't the problem\non your side of the case that there was another \"in for\na dime, in for a dollar\" argument and that was the\nhypothetical holding the hands behind the back while\nsome third party slugged the victim? And on that\nhypothetical, there was no reference to a definite\ncrime. In that hypothetical the victim was killed, and\nunder that hypothetical, there was no reference to the\ncrime, i.e., homicide, and so it seems to me that the\nprosecutor's arguments, the dime-dollar arguments, went\nboth ways.\nMR. COLLINS: I disagree, Your Honor. When\nthe prosecutor used the hypothetical, and in fact on\npage 123 that I just quoted you, the prosecutor talks\nabout, in fact uses that dime for a dollar hypothetical,\nand then immediately tells the jury that Mr. Sarausad\nacted with knowledge that there was going to be a\nhomicide. They went --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Sure, in that case. But\nthere was another one in which the prosecutor didn't do\nthat.\nMR. COLLINS: I'm sorry. Are you talking\nabout a different case, a case other than this, Justice\nSouter?\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I did -- maybe I dreamed\nthis. I thought the prosecutor also gave as a dime for\na dollar example the example of the individual, the\naccomplice who holds a victim's hands while a third\nparty slugs the victim and in fact kills the victim.\nAnd I thought in that hypothetical argument the\nprosecutor was saying that the -- that the accomplice\nwas an accomplice to homicide, even though he didn't\nknow at the time the assault started that homicide was\nintended or would result.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: It's toward the bottom of\npage 123. And I have the same, I have the same, just\ntieing onto Justice Souter's question, on the same\nsubject. It seems to me that that hypothetical is not\nnecessarily correct.\nMR. COLLINS: The court, the PRP Court of\nAppeals said that that hypothetical is problematic.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What about the\ninstruction that follows the hypothetical, first the\nstatement that the person gets assaulted, gets killed,\nin for a dime, in for a dollar? The law in the State of\nWashington says if you're in for a dime you're in for a\ndollar; if you're there or even if you're not there and\nyou're helping in some fashion to bring about this\ncrime, you are just as guilty, in some fashion. And\nthat was tied in to the person who thought he was\nassisting in assault and it turns out that the victim\ngot killed.\nMR. COLLINS: Justice Ginsburg, the\nhypothetical may be problematic, but you have to\nconsider --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But what about the\nstatement I just read, that the law of the State is you\ndon't even have to be there if you're helping in some\nfashion.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Where is that? Is that in\nthe charge to the jury?\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes. It's in the same\nparagraph, the paragraph with the example of the\naccomplice who is --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's not in the court's\ncharges.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: No. This is in the\nsummation.\nMR. COLLINS: Justice Ginsburg, the\nprosecutor's argument responds to the argument made by\nSarausad's counsel that you had to have shared intent,\nthat Mr. Sarausad had to have the same intent as the\nprincipal. They do use the hypothetical about holding\nthe arms, but as soon as they finish the hypothetical\nthe court -- the prosecutor identifies what happened\nhere, which is that the intention was to facilitate a\nhomicide, and you have to take the argument as a whole\njust looking at the hypothetical.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, if you take the\nargument as a whole you've got at best an ambiguous\nargument. You've got an argument that points to a \"the\ncrime\" interpretation and you've got an argument part of\nwhich points to an \"any crime\" interpretation, and to\nthe extent that your case may ultimately turn on the\nsignificance of the prosecutor's argument, it seems to\nme that the benefit of the doubt goes to the defendant.\nMR. COLLINS: Well, of course, Your Honor,\nin this case my argument doesn't have to turn on that.\nThe question is whether this is an unreasonable\napplication and looking at the whole argument that the\nprosecutor made, whenever the prosecutor used \"dime for\na dollar\" or that hypothetical, the prosecutor tied that\nto shooting. Mr. Sarausad was going to --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Maybe I'm beating a dead\nhorse, but it seems to me that what we've brought in our\nquestions from the bench is that that is not correct.\nIn one instance the prosecutor clearly tied it to\nshooting. If that's all we had before us we wouldn't\nhave an argument. But in the other iteration of the\ndime-dollar argument, the prosecutor didn't tie it to\nshooting.\nMR. COLLINS: Your Honor, I believe the\nprosecutor always tied it to shooting, and moreover\nthat's the way the defense counsel argued the case.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Can you help me with this?\nSuppose I'm a trial judge and I instruct the jury in a\ntechnical matter, an important but technical matter, and\nwhen they have questions about it I say read the\ninstruction. Suppose I'm right as far as the\ninstruction goes. But say the prosecutor gets everybody\nmixed up. Now, I guess if the prosecutor gets people\nmixed up enough, that could becomes a due process\nviolation. But I suspect that it has to be quite a lot\nof mix-up, that intuitively is what I suspect. Are\nthere any cases I should look at, one that would tell me\nhow mixed up the prosecutor has to get everybody before\nit's a due process violation?\nMR. COLLINS: Well, Your Honor, Brown v.\nPayton, which involved the Factor K in how you consider\nmitigating evidence in the --\nJUSTICE BREYER: In Brown, in that case did\nthey find that he did get them too mixed up or he\ndidn't?\nMR. COLLINS: He didn't get them too mixed\nup so.\nJUSTICE BREYER: He did not. So unless in\nthis case the prosecutor got everybody more mixed up\nthan in the Brown case, we should just reverse.\nMR. COLLINS: Exactly. Particularly --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What about the appellate\ncourt? I mean, the first time around the appellate\ncourt was as mixed up, more so perhaps, than the\nprosecutor.\nMR. COLLINS: Well, Your Honor --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Because the appellate\ncourt the first time got it wrong and it thought it was\nenough that the defendant knew that a crime was likely\nto be committed, not the crime, crime specified in the\nindictment, not -- not murder one, attempted murder, et\ncetera, just a crime. And the second time around that\nappellate court said, yeah, we got it wrong, now we know\nwe got it wrong because there has been an intervening\ndecision of the State's supreme court clarifying it.\nBut what the prosecutor said, at least as I\nread it, more than once is exactly what the intermediate\nappellate court said the first time around: Said he\ndidn't have to know that there was going to be a\nshooting.\nMR. COLLINS: Your Honor, the intermediate\nappellate court did get it wrong the first time around.\nBut I think you have to consider the context, Your\nHonor. The legal issue before the appellate court the\nfirst time on accomplice liability was Mr. Sarausad's\nclaim that there had to be a shared intent, that is to\nsay you didn't have to know the crime. You had to have\n--\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: They say, the court\nitself said: We got it wrong. We said go away\nappellant because you knew that a crime was likely to be\ncommitted.\nMR. COLLINS: Your Honor, I think you have\nto consider the context of the case. The argument that\nthe court of appeals was considering on direct review\nwas not the argument here. The question, the point that\nyou're looking at where the court said that it was not\nnecessary to prove shooting, the issue before the court\nwas Mr. Sarausad's claim that he was merely present,\nthat he didn't do anything. And the court of appeals\nresponded by saying no, there is evidence that you may\nhave known of the fight, you may have known of the\nshooting. And then in what I would characterize as an\naside, the court said the State doesn't have to prove\nshooting, but there is evidence of shooting.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Did -- hadn't other\nWashington State courts made a similar error in their\ninterpretation of the Washington statutes?\nMR. COLLINS: A few, a few court of appeals\ndecisions did misstate the standard, Justice Scalia,\nthat's correct.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And the same -- and hadn't\nthe prosecutors in Washington in misstating the standard\nthe same way and using \"In for a dime, in for a dollar\"\nto mean precisely the wrong thing, namely that even if\nyou were in for beating him up that's enough for holding\nyou liable for homicide?\nMR. COLLINS: Some prosecutors made that\nargument, Justice Scalia.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Including this one in an\nearlier case.\nMR. COLLINS: That's right. But in Boyde\nthis Court pointed out that the fact that prosecutors in\nother cases made improper arguments -- in Boyde\nprosecutors were arguing about Factor K didn't allow\nconsideration of mitigation evidence.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The only reason I raise it\nis, is to show that this jury was obviously perplexed on\nthe point. It asked for further instructions three\ntimes on this precise point, what did -- did he have to\nknow. And all the trial judge did was say read, you\nknow, read my instructions, which essentially recited\nthe statute. And what all of what you've just\nacknowledged shows is that reading the statute doesn't\nhelp a whole lot. It doesn't clarify. It doesn't, it\ndoesn't correct any misimpression that the prosecutor\ncould have created.\nMR. COLLINS: Justice Scalia, with respect,\nI disagree that the same question was asked three times.\nIn fact, if you look at the progression of the\nquestions, you can see the progress of the\ndeliberations. The first question asks about intent\nwith regard to the two convict instructions 11 and 12.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Let's look at -- where is\nthat?\nMR. COLLINS: That would be at JA 131 and\n132.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: In the white?\nMR. COLLINS: I'm sorry. The brown joint\nappendix 131, 132. And see \"Request Clarification on\nInstruction Nos. 11 and 12, Intent.\" Now, 11 and 12 are\nthe two \"convict\" instructions for first degree murder\nfor Mr. Recuenco and Mr. Sarausad. The next questions\nthat were asked -- this is on page 135 of the same\ndocument -- they ask about Instruction No. 17.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Excuse me. Let's go back\nto 131 for a minute. I thought that applied to the\n\"accomplice\" instruction.\nMR. COLLINS: The trial court directed the\n--\nJUSTICE STEVENS: That's a question\nspecifically applied to the defendant only for the\ndefendant or his accomplice.\nMR. COLLINS: They asked about \"accomplice,\"\nbut the -- this was not a question about the meaning of\n\"accomplice liability.\" This question is different than\nthe third question.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It doesn't -- your\npoint is that it doesn't go to the \"aiding\" issue.\nMR. COLLINS: Exactly, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, excuse me. \"Intent\"\nis broad enough to go to the DA issue, isn't it?\nMR. COLLINS: This question really goes to\nif you look --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: What's the answer to my\nquestion? I mean \"the\" and \"a\" are references to what\nthe accomplice had in mind at the time of acting.\nThat's an intent issue.\nMR. COLLINS: Your Honor -- it is an intent\nquestion, Your Honor. But the question, if you look at\nInstruction No. 12, which is on page -- page -- on page\n9 of the brown book, this talks about the fact that in\nparagraph 2, that the defendant or his accomplice acted\nwith intent to cause the death of another person. So\nthe question was: Did both -- do you have to have the\nsame intent as -- does the accomplice have to have the\nsame intent as the principal?\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Maybe so. Let's go to\nthe third question, when the jury asks: \"When a person\nwillingly participates in a group activity, is that\nperson an accomplice to any crime committed by anyone in\nthe group?\"\nMR. COLLINS: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: How could the jury better\nexpress its puzzlement? It wanted to know, if someone\nparticipates in a group, but did not -- that that person\nis -- is an accomplice to any crime by anyone?\nMR. COLLINS: And that, Justice Ginsburg --\nand that's the first time that the jury asked that\nquestion. The trial court referred them to the\naccomplice liability instruction and the knowledge --\nand the knowledge instruction and --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And the -- the counsel\nfor the defense says, tell them no.\nMR. COLLINS: And that would have been\nwrong, Your Honor. If -- if the trial judge -- there\nare two things wrong with that -- wrong, Your Honor.\nFirst of all, it would not have been accurate because\nyou don't know what the group activity is, and you don't\nknow what the knowledge is. If the knowledge of the\ngroup activity was going back to the school to\nfacilitate a crime --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: It says \"a group\nactivity.\" When a person willingly participates in \"a\ngroup activity,\" is that person an accomplice to any\ncrime committed by anyone in the group? I don't think\nthere is any ambiguity in that question.\nMR. COLLINS: With respect, Your Honor, I\nthink you have to know what the group activity is. More\n-- but the important point is: The jury got the answer\nto the question and --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: They didn't get an\nanswer. They were told to read an instruction that they\nhad been told three times to read and obviously didn't\nunderstand.\nMR. COLLINS: Your Honor, I think in the\nWeeks case this Court has held that it's proper to tell\na jury to reread instructions. They are not required to\ngive a supplemental instruction.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But we already know that\nmany people, prosecutors, justices, misunderstood this\n\"a crime.\" Was it \"a crime,\" or \"any crime.\" Or \"the\ncrime\"?\nSo I think you can't avoid the confusing\nnature of the statute and the charge, which repeated the\nstatute. It doesn't get clarified until the Washington\nSupreme Court says it means \"the crime,\" not \"a crime,\"\nand not \"any crime.\"\nMR. COLLINS: Your Honor, we are not arguing\nthat there couldn't be some ambiguity, but what we are\nsaying is that the adjudication by the PRP court was not\nobjectively unreasonable. Because when you look at the\ninstructions as a whole and the argument as a whole and\nthe evidence as a whole, the PRP court's decision is not\nobjectively unreasonable.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, isn't -- isn't the\nargument for objective unreasonableness, number one, to\nbegin with, what you just stated. Of course, there is\nsome ambiguity there. I'll be candid to say that if I\nwere stating it myself, I would say there is more than\nsome ambiguity here. It seems to be, if not misleading,\nat least incapable of informing a jury of exactly what\nthe law is.\nNumber two, the -- the second point in the\nargument is, the jury comes back repeatedly, and\nalthough, as you point out, it is -- it may well be a\nproper answer to a jury request for clarification to\nsay, go back and read the instruction; the answer is\nthere. When it has been demonstrated by repeated jury\nquestions that they are just not getting it, that they\nstill have perplexity, the court has got to do something\nmore than just say, oh, go back and do it again.\nAnd number three, in this situation in which\nthere is ambiguity, there is a demonstration of jury\nconfusion. There is an argument by the prosecutor\nwhich, in fact, is a two-part argument or a two-example\nargument and it cuts both ways, isn't it objectively\nreasonable to say under those circumstances that there\nwas an inadequate instruction to the jury in -- in the\ncorrect Washington law?\nMR. COLLINS: I would say no, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Then -- then what would it\ntake?\nJUDGE SCALIA: You -- you know, you are\ntaking on more of a burden than you have to. And you\ncould say, yes, it would be reasonable to say that, but\nit would also be reasonable to say -- to say otherwise,\nright?\nMR. COLLINS: It's not objectively\nunreasonable.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's not objectively\nunreasonable to say the opposite.\nMR. COLLINS: Exactly, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: The -- the \"opposite\" in\nthis case would mean that the jury was properly\ninstructed and was in a position adequately to\nunderstand Washington law correctly? That's the --\nthat's the opposite position.\nMR. COLLINS: There is no question that in a\nnumber of --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I want to know what you\nmean. That's what you mean by the \"opposite position\"?\nMR. COLLINS: I mean the \"opposite position\"\nis it's possible that if you are --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Would you -- you are saying\nyou want -- why don't you answer my question? My\nquestion is: I think you're telling me that it would be\nobjectively reasonable to say that on the scenario I\njust laid out the jury probably understood Washington\nlaw correctly.\nMR. COLLINS: And I would say I think that's\ncorrect, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But even, again, I\nthink you are taking on too high a burden. You don't\nhave to show that the jury properly understood it. You\ndon't even have to show that it's reasonable.\nYou have to show the opposite -- or your friend has to\nshow the opposite, that there is no way that the jury\ncould have understood this correctly or applied the\ncorrect constitutional law. That is, if there is a way,\nthen it's -- it's not objectively unreasonable.\nMR. COLLINS: That's exactly right, Chief\nJustice Roberts.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And that way would be the\nway we just set out, wasn't it: That the jury, if -- if\n-- if, in fact, it's objectively reasonable to conclude\nthat the jury did understand Washington law correctly on\nthose circumstances, then -- then the -- the Respondent\nhere cannot win in -- in his collateral attack?\nMR. COLLINS: We would say he cannot win\nbecause the decision of the Washington court was not\nobjectively unreasonable.\nI'd like to reserve the rest of my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Fisher.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY FISHER\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. FISHER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe State is here today making what we think\nis a rather extraordinary argument. It's arguing that\nthere is no reasonable likelihood that the jury in this\ncase interpreted the accomplice liability charge in the\nsame manner that the State itself urged the jury to\ninterpret it; that the State urged the Washington Court\nof Appeals to interpret it on direct review in this case\nand in many other cases, and how the Washington Court of\nAppeals in fact interpreted it.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well -- but is that\nthe standard? You said there is -- they are saying that\nit's not reasonably likely, but that's not the standard.\nThey have -- you have to show that it's objectively\nunreasonable to show that the -- to assume that the\nState got it correct.\nMR. FISHER: That's right, Your Honor. So\nthere is a constitutional violation, and then our\nburden, which we believe we can carry on the\nextraordinary record in this case, is to show that a\ncourt, the Washington Court of Appeals, could not have\nreasonably concluded that there was a reasonable\nlikelihood the jury understood the charge in this case.\nJUSTICE ALITO: When I read the opinion of\nthe Washington Court of Appeals, it does not seem to me\nthat what they are doing is providing a literal\ninterpretation of the jury instruction, as I think we\nhave to presume the jury did when they got that\ninstruction.\nWashington Court of Appeals is interpreting\nWashington law. And they may be influenced by\nWashington case law, which is what they cite. They\ndon't -- they quote the instruction but they don't say\n\"the crime\" means \"a crime\". That's how we interpret\nthe language of the instruction.\nSo there is an overlay of Washington case\nlaw, principles of accomplice liability that inform this\ninstruction. So I don't know that you can -- it's\nreasonable to argue that because they misinterpreted\nWashington law, they were misinterpreting the literal\nlanguage of the jury instruction.\nMR. FISHER: Well, Justice Alito, we think\nit is fair to say that, because in the Washington Court\nof Appeals decision, they start by laying out the\nstatutory language of Washington accomplice liability.\nAnd remember, the jury instruction in this case simply\ntracks that language. That's, in fact, one of the\nState's argument.\nNow, our response to that argument is, just\nas you said, Justice Alito, when a State supreme court,\nas the Washington court later did in this case, steps in\nand applies a gloss to that language and interprets it,\nas this Court has said many times, it's as though that\nlanguage is written into the statute.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: The gloss that the\nWashington Supreme Court ended up with was exactly the\nsame as the instruction that was, that the judge gave in\nthis case -- to be as a -- the trial judge, whatever the\nstate of the law was, got it right.\nMR. FISHER: Got it right insofar as\nregurgitated the language of the statute. But the\nWashington law that would apply to this case -- and I\nthink there is an agreement on this, Justice Kennedy, is\nthat Mr. Sarausad has to know that he was promoting or\nfacilitating a homicide. That's what he has to know.\nThat's theory one of the State's --\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's exactly what the\ninstruction said. My problem is, I guess different\npeople, I understand, can read the same words and come\nto different conclusions. But I have read the\ninstruction and the statute, probably over a dozen times\nby now, and I can't find the slightest ambiguity.\nIt seems to be absolutely clear. What it\nsays is you're instructed that a person is guilty -- I\nwould say what crime is the jury considering -- of a\ncrime. Namely, second-degree murder crime, if it is\ncommitted by another person for which he is legally\naccountable.\nThen it says you're an accomplice -- an\naccomplice -- it says a person is an accomplice with\ncertain knowledge when he aids another person in\nplanning or committing a crime; the crime, second-degree\nmurder.\nWhat is the problem?\nMR. FISHER: The problem, Your Honor, is it\nstarts with this Court recognized him void. Juries are\nlay people, and they understand things in terms of\ncommon sense.\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's a different\nargument. I want to know first -- in my mind in two\ndifferent categories. Category one: Is there an\nambiguity in this instruction? And my answer so far,\nwhich is what I was asking you, is zero. Why not?\nAnd then the second question is, could the\nprosecution get people so mixed up about something, a\ntypical thing like this, that it would violate due\nprocess? That's why I asked the question before. And I\nsaid, obviously the answer is sometimes they could.\nAnd then the question is, did they here?\nAnd what he referred me to was Brown, which I've looked\nat, in which I said the prosecutorial and problem in\nthat case did not rise to a federal due process\nquestion. So, I guess -- though it's only one person --\nyou would have to convince me that this is somehow worse\nprosecutorial conduct than existed in Brown.\nMR. FISHER: Let me take your question in\ntwo steps, Justice Breyer.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All my questions from the\nwhole case.\nMR. FISHER: Thank you. First I want to\nemphasize we are not alleging prosecutorial misconduct\nin this case in any way. The problem is --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No. But what I mean by\nthat is that the prosecution would have had to have\ngotten the jury more mixed up than -- I was using\nshorthand for that --\nMR. FISHER: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- more mixed up than they\ndid in Brown, where I thought it was pretty bad.\nMR. FISHER: That's right. Let me -- all I\nmeant to say was the prevailing view in the State at the\ntime of this trial was that any crime was sufficient,\nand so that's why the prosecutor was entitled to make\nthat argument.\nLet me take your question in two steps,\nfirst the ambiguity in the language. As the Washington\ncourts themselves and as the States themselves argue at\npage 38 and 39 of the appendix of our red brief, you can\ninterpret the language in the statute, when you get to\nwords \"the crime\", to mean one of two things:\nOne, it could mean as you said, Justice\nBreyer, that the particular crime the principal\ncommitted; or it could mean one could understand it to\nmean simply the principal's criminal conduct. And in\nWashington --\nJUSTICE BREYER: In my -- it it doesn't mean\neither. It means jury you are instructed that the\nperson is guilty of a crime -- in other words, the jury\nis sitting there and they are asked the question: Is\nthe person guilty of second-degree murder?\nNow they are to apply the instruction. A\nperson is guilty of second-degree murder if da, da, da,\nda. And when it gets to \"the crime\", it is referring to\nsecond-degree murder. I don't know how -- anything else\nit could be referring to.\nMR. FISHER: Well, maybe the best that I can\ndo, Justice Breyer, is refer you to empirical evidence\nfrom the State itself, from the State of Washington, and\nif you need one further thing to look at, I commend to\nyou the Supreme Court decision of the Supreme Court of\nColorado that cited in the actual brief -- there was\nlanguage exactly like this that comes to a textual\nanalysis and comes to the conclusion.\nJUSTICE BREYER: You're convincing me that\ndifferent people can reach different conclusions. What\nI'd like you to say is something that would change my\nmind on my initial conclusion that there is no\nambiguity. I think you could say something like that,\nbecause as you quite rightly point out, other people\nhave reached other conclusions.\nMR. FISHER: Because the articles \"a\" and\n\"the\" are simply not definite enough. And you can read\nthe words \"the crime\" to simply mean criminal conduct.\nNow, let me talk about the prosecutor's\nargument.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You might be able to\nand you might -- as I understood you to say earlier, you\ncould read it one way or you could say it another way.\nAnd if that's the case, it's hard to say that reading it\none way is objectively unreasonable when the State court\nreads it that way.\nMR. FISHER: I think if that's all we had,\nMr. Chief Justice, you would be exactly right. So let\nme turn now --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So it is not\nobjectively unreasonable for the State to instruct\njurors as they did? If that's all you had, then that\nwould be the point.\nMR. FISHER: Right. Right. Because the\ntest that this Court has repeated many times is whether\nthere is a reasonable likelihood that this jury\nmisapplied the instruction.\nNow, let me turn to the prosecutor's\nargument, because there was a lot of discussion about\nthat in the first half an hour.\nThere is two places in the joint appendix\nthat you might want to pay attention to, and I think we\nmight have been referring to two different places\nearlier. In joint appendix page 38, the prosecutor\nmakes her opening argument and says -- and uses the\nassault analogy of holding somebody's arms behind their\nback. And she tells the jury this is -- as Justice\nGinsburg was reading -- this is the law of the State of\nWashington.\nAnd again, in direct rebuttal at page 123 of\nthe joint appendix, the prosecutor again says very\nspecifically -- specifically to the jury, let me talk to\nyou about the accomplice liability instruction.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Was there an objection?\nMR. FISHER: There were objections both\nbefore and after.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: The objection was based on\nthe defense proffer of an instruction which was, namely,\nclose to the model penal code that says you have to have\nthe same -- is anterior principle, and that's not\nnecessarily the law in every state.\nSo the defense bears some responsibility for\nnot -- for -- number one, it didn't have a coherent\ntheory either.\nMR. FISHER: There were times where\nMr. Sarausad's counsel, you're right, did ask for a\nlittle more than he was entitled to. But Mr. Reyes'\ncounsel made objections directly on point, which\nMr. Sarausad joined, and as Justice Ginsburg noted\nearlier, when the jury comes back with the third\nquestion that is precisely on point, it's precisely the\nquestion on which that whole entire case turns -- and I\nmight add there would be no reason for the jury to ask\nthat third question, what kind of knowledge is required\nin this case, if they had decided, as the State argues,\nthat Mr. Sarausad knew a homicide was going to be\ncommitted.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I don't think that\nyour reading of question three is definitive. I think\nit's like the instruction, the jury could read it one of\ntwo ways. If you look at question three, the issue\ncould be whether others could have had an intent, in\nother words, others in the group, not simply -- it\ndoesn't show that the accomplice doesn't have to have\nthe requisite intent.\nMR. FISHER: Well, we think it's pretty\nclear, Mr. Chief Justice. I think the more important\nsentence may be the one that precedes that question,\nwhich is the jury tells the court, after seven days of\ndeliberations: We are having difficulty agreeing on the\nlegal definition and concept of accomplice.\nNow, that is the question -- and let me\nreturn to the prosecutor's argument --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's not the\nquestion. There are a number of areas, and I think the\nfirst two questions point in the opposite direction.\nThey do not say we don't know whether it's \"the crime\"\nor \"a crime\". Their questions, neither one, two or\nthree focus on that.\nIt's a more general question that we could\nread the opposite way. Perhaps you can read it the way\nyou are, even though it doesn't say is it \"the crime\" or\n\"a crime\".\nBut there again, I think it's incorrect to\nsay it's quite clear that the question -- and certainly\nnot questions one and two, I mean question three is your\nstrongest one -- but it's still not clear that they are\nfocusing on the \"the/a\" issue.\nMR. FISHER: Well, I think the best we can\ndo, because we have to make reasonable inferences from\nthe record and he we can't go back and ask the jurors\nwhat we thought, is we have to make, as the court has\ndone many times, reasonable inferences as to what they\nare doing. And I think the fairest reading of this\nrecord, even if it's not absolutely clear, is that the\njury was honing in progressively on the central issue in\nthis case, and that was Mr. Sarausad's mens rea.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So, then, what I take is\nauthoritative on that are two sentences from the\nWashington Supreme Court opinion, though people -- other\njudges have been all over the lot. The first sentence\nit says: The trial court correctly instructed the jury\nthat it could convict Mr. Sarausad of murder -- they\nmean second-degree murder -- as an accomplice only if it\nfound he knowingly aided in commission of \"the crime\"\ncharged, which was second-degree murder. That's their\ninterpretation, which I could understand.\nThen the second thing is, it does not offend\nthe principles of accomplice liability to hold\nresponsible one who knowingly aids such conduct; namely,\nconduct that creates a substantial risk of death when\nthe substantial risk of death results in actual death.\nSo that would seem to be hornbook law. If\nyou engage in conduct that might well cause substantial\nor -- substantial risk of death and you know it, you\nknow, you know you're engaging in this conduct, that's\nthe Washington view, that's it. You've had it.\nAnd here they go on to say that he knew\nthere was plenty of evidence that he knew that he was\nengaged in a drive-by shooting. And then to put every\ndot on every \"I\", they say a drive-by shooting does run\na substantial risk of death. Okay.\nNow that's what I read and at that point, I\nsaid I'll ask you that, because then I can hear the best\nanswer.\nMR. FISHER: Your Honor, we are not\nchallenging -- or this Court does not have authorities\nthe sufficiency of the evidence in this case, so there\nmight be enough evidence in the record for the jury to\nhave found that. But the question is, did the jury find\nthat? And we can't know from the instructions given in\nlight of the arguments made to the jury by the\nprosecutor and the jury's own questions trying to sort\nthrough them, this case -- whether the jury actually\nfound that. And so if the State wanted -- this goes\nagain to the prosecutor's argument.\nThere is two things that I think we might be\nconflating improperly here. There is the first question\nof what the prosecutor argued to the jury Washington law\nmeant. And I suggest to you if you look at JA 38 and JA\n123, there is no doubt what the prosecutor was arguing\nto the jury Washington law meant. It meant as she said,\n\"in or a dime, in for a dollar.\" If you hold somebody's\narms behind their back thinking that an assault is going\nto occur and the person dies, you can be found guilty of\nmurder.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: No objection from defense\ncounsel.\nMR. FISHER: Both before and after, Justice\nKennedy.\nBut I would add that another reason the\ndefense counsel may not have interposed yet another\nobjection at that instance was because that was the\nprevailing view of Washington law at the time.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Could I ask you this\nquestion about the jury's question where they say we are\nhaving difficulty agreeing on a legal definition and\nconcept of accomplice; when a person willingly\nparticipates in a group activity, is that person an\naccomplice to any crime committed by anyone in the\ngroup?\nSuppose that the judge had answered that\nquestion by saying a person who participates in group\nactivity is guilty of the crime of second degree murder\nif the person acts with knowledge that his or her\nconduct will promote or facilitate the commission of the\ncrime of second degree murder. Would you have a case if\nthat answer was given?\nMR. FISHER: I don't think so, Justice\nAlito. That would have cleared up the ambiguity in the\ncase.\nJUSTICE ALITO: That's almost a direct quote\nfrom the instruction that was given.\nMR. FISHER: No, it's not because what you\ndid is you inserted the name of the crime in there.\nJUSTICE ALITO: I put in crime of second\ndegree murder rather than the crime.\nMR. FISHER: That's exactly what defendants\neven still in the State of Washington are asking courts\nto do in the --\nJUSTICE ALITO: That poses a difference\nenough to make A, a constitutional violation and B, make\nit unreasonable for the Washington Court of Appeals to\nsay that there was no constitutional violation?\nMR. FISHER: Yes, under the particular\ncircumstances in this case, because the jury expressed\nconfusion. So we know the jury was confused. We know\nthe only reason they would have asked that is if they\nhad not found the facts the State alleges, at least at\nthat point, that Mr. Sarausad knew a murder was going to\noccur, and also because we know the prosecutor argued\nthe exact opposite to them. They were actually asking\nthe question -- another way to put it, I think which is\na fair characterization is, is what the prosecutor told\nus correct? That --\nJUSTICE BREYER: The prosecutor, I mean I\nthought, though I'm not -- this really is ambiguous, I\nthink, but if you do hold somebody's arms behind his\nback and punch him in the stomach, that does perhaps --\nat least might run -- I can see a person saying that\nthat runs a substantial risk of death. I mean Houdini\ndied that way, apparently. So maybe hitting somebody in\nthe stomach does create a substantial risk of death. Do\nyou know anything about -- one way or the other on that?\nMR. FISHER: I'm sorry, Justice Breyer. You\nneed more than that in this case. Second degree murder\nis intentional. So --\nJUSTICE BREYER: They intentionally hit\nsomebody in the stomach, you say, knowing all about --\nMR. FISHER: Intentionally killing is what\nthe State says.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I realize that but what the\nState supreme court holds. I think correctly, that if\nthe person conscious of the risk knows that a particular\nindividual is engaging in certain conduct for whom he is\nresponsible, he is -- he is guilty of the -- if the\nevent that you know there is a substantial risk of comes\nabout. I would be amazed that a State would say the\ncontrary.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And your answer to Justice\nBreyer incorporated the -- the principle that the\ndefense counsel had been arguing for from the outset of\nthis case, that you must have the same scienter as the\nprincipal, and that's not necessarily the law.\nMR. FISHER: I think that --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: It can go on in some\nStates but not -- it doesn't have to be the law as I\nunderstand it.\nMR. FISHER: The defendant didn't have to\nhave premedication, Justice Kennedy. I think the best\nanswer I can give and I -- is that we agree with the\nState on this. We agree with what the State said at\npage 31 of its brief, that it had to prove that\nMr. Sarausad knew he was aiding or facilitating a\nhomicide. That he knew, and it was argued to this case,\nJustice -- as it was argued to the jury, Justice Breyer,\nthe defense agreed that if Mr. Sarausad knew there was a\ngun in his car, or if he knew that the fellows were\nplanning on killing somebody, that he could have been\nfound guilty.\nThat was the very -- that was the central\nissue in this case; and when the State stands up and\nsays the prosecutor argued -- didn't make -- didn't make\na misleading argument, what they are talking about are\nthe prosecutor's arguments on the facts. After telling\nthe jury had is what Washington law is, the prosecutor\nargued in various ways that Mr. Sarausad knew that a\nfight was going to happen, or -- or that a gun was --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Washington -- in the State\nof Washington you think the law is that if Joe Jones\nhelps Dead Eye Dick shoot his gun right at somebody's\nleg and then accidental -- then, you know, he doesn't\naim quite right, the guy dies; then it's a good defense\nto say well, I knew he was Dead Eye Dick. I thought\nhe'd just hit him in the leg. I mean, that -- we know\nthat isn't a good defense in Washington because the\nSupreme Court of Washington tells us that.\nMR. FISHER: That's right. But I think you\ndon't --\nJUSTICE BREYER: What's the difference\nbetween that and punching him in the stomach?\nMR. FISHER: Because when somebody is\npunched in the stomach there is no reasonable belief\nthat the person is going to be put in grave risk of\ndeath. And so as I said, the issue of this case, that\nthe whole entire case was about, and that the jury was\ndemonstrably perplexed about, was what did Mr. Sarausad\nknow.\nAnd when the State says, well -- the\nprosecutor argued to the jury that he knew their\nshooting was going to happen or that he knew a gun was\nin the car, if the jury had believed that they could\nhave come back with a guilty verdict in 30 minutes; but\ninstead they asked a series of questions culminating in\nthe one after seven days of deliberation which can only\nbe interpreted as suggesting that we don't believe that\nMr. Sarausad knew that the worst was going to happen\nhere, and we are struggling to figure out what kind of\nverdict we have to render in light of that.\nJUSTICE ALITO: With the jury -- was the\njury told that the arguments of counsel are not the law,\nthat I, the judge, will tell you what the law is?\nMR. FISHER: I think a standard statement to\nthat effect was made. But remember two things, Justice\nAlito. First, the prosecutor herself kept telling the\njury this is what the State of Washington law requires.\nAnd as this Court has recognized in other cases, the\nprosecutor isn't just any old lawyer standing in front\nof a jury. The prosecutor carries with her the\nimprimatur of the government; and so we think it's\nperfectly reasonable for the jury to have understood the\nprosecutor to be arguing this is what the law is, and at\nthe very least to have created a question in their\nminds.\nAnd if I contrast this case with Brown\nagainst Payton, because Justice Breyer has asked about\nthat case and it is another case where the prosecutor\nmade what this Court found was a misleading argument to\nthe jury, there you have a very different situation.\nNot only do you have no jury questions at all coming in\nthat case to demonstrate to the Court that the jury was\nin fact confused and likely to follow the prosecutor's\nadvice, but you have a very different scenario in Brown,\nwhere this Court said that in light of the way that case\nwas actually argued, the prosecutor was really making\nmore of an argument on the facts, that these arguments\nthe defendant has made shouldn't really be considered\nmitigating evidence in your deliberations; and as this\nCourt said the jury must have taken it as a factual\nargument because otherwise the whole mitigation hearing\nwould have been totally unnecessary.\nNow, under the -- under the facts of this\ncase, the way this case was tried -- and again I want to\nemphasize that at the time this case was tried, the\nprosecutor had the better of the argument as to what\nWashington law is.\nThis case is only before you because it's\nthe oddball case, and the only one I can think of that's\nlike it is when this Court had in about 2000, or decided\nin 2001, called Fiore v White, when in Pennsylvania the\nState brought a prosecution and obtained a conviction\nfor discharging hazardous waste without a permit, and\nthen the Pennsylvania Supreme Court later said that not\nhaving a permit is required under the statute. It's not\nenough to prove to the jury that he so deviated from the\npermit that -- that no permit existed. And then this\nCourt said once we know that clarification under State\nlaw, we look back and it's clear as day that the jury\ndidn't find that element.\nNow the only difference between that case\nand this case is that in Fiore it was absolutely certain\nthe jury didn't find the element and the prosecution\ndidn't argue otherwise. Here you have enough ambiguous\nevidence and ambiguity in the jury instructions that the\nState was trying to backfill after it has lost the case\nin the Washington Supreme Court and say no, the jury in\nthis case even though we told them they didn't have to\nfind it, did go ahead and find it.\nJUSTICE ALITO: But the only difference\nbetween that case, which I know very well, and this case\nis that in that case there was no issue about jury\ninstructions.\nMR. FISHER: Well, not directly.\nJUSTICE ALITO: So what's the relevance of\nit?\nMR. FISHER: Right. So, the relevance --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Has to do with the\nretroactivity whether a State can -- whether\nPennsylvania had changed the interpretation of its\nstatute, or whether what they said it meant was what it\nalways had meant.\nMR. FISHER: That's right, Justice Alito and\nI know that you know that case. The -- you're right.\nSo we are on all fours with Fiore in the sense that the\nlater decision from the State Supreme Court applies\nretroactively, and in Fiore what you would have had, the\ncourt didn't need to talk about jury instructions,\nbecause I take it that the jury was instructed in Fiore\nthat deviating substantially from a permit satisfies the\nno-permit element of that defense, and so the jury was\ngiven there, simply an instruction that was simply\nwrong.\nAnd here our contention is that the -- that\nthe jury charge taken in light of the case was\nambiguous, but that distinction doesn't matter because\nas this Court has said in Boyde and Estelle and many\nother cases, all you have to show is a reasonable\nlikelihood that the jury misunderstood the charge.\nNow we have to show an additional layer of\nunreasonableness because we are on habeas now and no\nlonger on direct review, but for all the reasons that\nare apparent on the face of this record this is the\nextraordinary case.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Fisher, can I just ask\nyou a question? Is it your view that the question that\nis troubling the jury was whether they had to find that\nthe driver of the car knew that there was a gun in the\ncar.\nMR. FISHER: There's two ways to think about\nit. Yes, that could be one way to think about it. The\nother way that they might have been thinking about it\nwas whether he knew that a murder was going to happen\nand that a killing was going to happen.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Assume proof of the gun in\nthe car was enough to prove --\nMR. FISHER: That's the way the case was\npresented to the jury.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: It wouldn't -- and that's\nwhat presumably may have taken a lot of time\ndeliberating whether or not he knew there was a gun.\nMR. FISHER: That's right, Justice Stevens.\nThe defendant --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And in one theory it makes\na difference; in another theory it doesn't.\nMR. FISHER: Precisely. And the defense\ncounsel -- the defense counsel admitted in argument that\nif you find he knew there was a gun in the car, then we\nlose. And, remember, the jury earlier -- we've talk\nabout the three jury questions about what the law meant.\nRemember the jury earlier asked to have Mr. Sarausad's\ntestimony reread back to them. So, again, every\nindication is you have a jury really trying very, very\nhard to do their job.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, AEDPA of\ncourse requires that this be an unreasonable application\nof clearly established Federal law. What is the clearly\nestablished Federal law that was unreasonably applied?\nMR. FISHER: It's the rule that is stated --\nagain, at page 32 of the State's brief with which we\nagree -- that if there is a reasonable likelihood that\nthe jury applied instructions so as to violate the\nConstitution, then that violates due process.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So that's\narticulated at a fairly general level.\nMR. FISHER: That's right.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: In Yarborough, we've\nsaid that the more general the rule, the more leeway\ncourts have in reaching outcomes in a case-by-case\ndetermination. So you have a very general rule, and to\nfind an unreasonable application, the court has broad\nleeway because it is a general rule. And you've already\nsaid that the instruction does not establish\nunreasonable application.\nGiven that, isn't it pertinent, although\npeople have objected -- you've objected to the idea\nthat, well, all they did was send them back with the\ninstruction. So they sent them back with something that\nyou said could be reasonably interpreted correctly. So\nwhy isn't that -- why doesn't that -- given the leeway\nthe State court has because this is a general rule, why\nisn't that sufficient to refute the idea of unreasonable\nobjective? Yes.\nMR. FISHER: The State would have a better\nargument if nothing else had happened in this trial\nother than simply the jury had been given that\ninstruction, but our point is, and then this Court\nrecognizes as much, I think, in Brown against Payton,\nthat the prosecutor's arguments do matter. They are to\nbe considered in the calculus. And this Court said in\nEstelle that instructions cannot be considered in\nisolation. They have to be considered in the totality\nof the way the case was tried.\nAnd so my point, Mr. Chief Justice, is the\nreason why the State cannot show that the State court of\nappeals decision was reasonable is because it's not just\nthe instruction that had perplexed the State and\nWashington courts over the years; it's the fact that the\nprosecutor asked the jury to adopt the wrong\ninterpretation of the instruction and that the jury came\nback and told the court -- I think -- maybe it helps to\nthink about the case this way: After seven days of\ndeliberation -- now I understand that we can dispute a\nlittle bit what the jury was asking, but I think a fair\nstatement is that after seven days of deliberation, the\njury was telling the court at a minimum there's a\nreasonable likelihood we don't understand accomplice\nliability in this case and that we are going to find\nthat as long as Sarausad was a member of this gang and\nwillingly participated in gang activity, that that's\nenough to hold him liable for accomplice murder. And\nthat's what the State had argued alternatively, Your\nHonor.\nSo after seven days, there's no guesswork\nthat's even required. We know the jury was confused and\ngoing down the wrong path. And so the only way the\nState can rescue that is to say that, upon being told to\nread the same charge that it been told to read three\nprevious times, that suddenly the light bulb went off so\ndramatically that it reduced its confusion below the\n50/50 level. Now that's what this Court said in Brown\nagainst Payton. The reasonable likelihood test is below\n50/50.\nSo we think if you were the Washington Court\nof Appeals -- and I think this is another way to ask\nyourselves the question you have to decide in this case.\nIf you were the Washington Court of Appeals on this\nrecord, would it be reasonable for you to say that this\njury was not even reasonably likely to misunderstand the\naccomplice liability instruction in this case?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You've already said\nthat the instruction doesn't get you there. And I just\nheard you say that, with respect to the questions, we\ncan dispute what the jury was asking. So it's hard for\nme to see where you get the objectively unreasonableness\nif you can read the instruction correctly, if it's -- if\nyou can't tell what the jury was asking, you don't know\nthat they were reflecting the confusion you have here.\nSo is all you're left with the prosecutor's statements?\nMR. FISHER: Well, we have all three, but I\ndon't want to give away too much. I think it is fair to\nsay that the jury's third question is perfectly clear.\nI hedged a minute to be frank so that I could\nacknowledge the Court's earlier questions and get -- and\nget my statement out, but in all honesty, I think that\nthe third jury question makes it clear that the jury is\nconfused. But we have -- again, unlike Brown against\nPayton, unlike Weeks against Angelone, we have this\namazing constellation of all these mutually --\nJUSTICE BREYER: This argument -- I'm\nbeginning to get your argument. The statement is -- the\nprosecutor never suggested Mr. Sarausad could be found\nguilty if he had no knowledge that a shooting was to\noccur. You're saying that's absolutely wrong. There's\nno support for that in the record. In fact what the\nprosecutor was arguing is that, even if a shooting\ndidn't occur, he's still guilty because of other gang\nactivity, and when we read the record, we find that's so\nwrong the statement in the supreme court opinion, that\nhabeas was right. Is that the argument?\nMR. FISHER: That's a fair characterization,\nJustice Breyer. If you look at the hypothetical that\nthe State gives the jury as to what Washington law\nmeans, it is clear that's the argument they're making.\nOn the facts they made alternative arguments.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMR. FISHER: Thank you very much.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Collins, you\nhave four minutes.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM B. COLLINS\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. COLLINS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nI want to just focus for a moment on the\nthird question because Respondent focuses on that. To\nbegin with, you have to understand what was going on in\nthis trial. There was deliberation for seven-plus days\nbut it was a 10-day trial, I mean the jury heard\ntestimony for 10 days. There were three defendants\nbeing tried together. Each defendant was being tried on\nfive counts. It was a complicated trial. The fact that\nthe deliberations took seven days is not extraordinary\nat all.\nMr. Sarausad assumes that the third question\nis directed at him. I suggest -- of course we don't\nknow what was going on in the jury room, but I suggest\nas likely an explanation is that question went to\nMr. Reyes because Mr. Reyes was not driving, was sitting\nin the back seat. The question is, if you're just\nsitting in the back seat when your gang is going to do\nan activity, are you guilty? And they were told to\nreread the instruction. They did reread the\ninstruction, and they deliberated. So the third\nquestion came on the seventh day of deliberation. After\nthey got the answer to reread the instruction, they\ndeliberated about 45 minutes. They took a break for the\nnight. They came back, deliberated about another hour\nand a half, and then they pronounced their verdict,\nconvicted Mr. Ronquillo of first degree murder,\nMr. Sarausad of second degree murder. They hung on\nMr. Reyes.\nIt seems to me that the third question does\nnot -- is not some kind of a smoking gun. When you look\nat the trial --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: They didn't say anything\nat all about Mr. Reyes. They asked the question about\nan accomplice, a crime.\nMR. COLLINS: Exactly right, Justice\nGinsburg, but Mr. Sarausad assumes that that's a\nquestion about him. We suggest it's just as likely that\nit's a question about Mr. Reyes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But what he's saying, I\nthink now, is if there was no gun in the car -- suppose\nthe jury thinks there's no gun in the car, then he\ndidn't even know there was going to be a shooting, but\nthat the prosecutor in the context of the trial had\ngiven the jury the impression that they could convict\nthis person even if the person did not know there was\ngoing to be a drive-by shooting.\nAnd he's saying that the finding to the\ncontrary, the statement to the contrary in the Supreme\nCourt of Washington is wrong. When I look at that, I\nwill find, he says, that the prosecutor gave the\nimpression, as I just said, that even without a gun your\ninvolvement with this gang is enough to convict him of\nmurder. What is your response to that? You know the\nrecord. I don't.\nMR. COLLINS: My response, Your Honor, is\nyou will not find that when you look through the record.\nThe prosecutor -- and the PRP court stated the\nprosecutor never argued that if the only knowledge was\nsome kind of a fight, that you could convict him,\nbecause the defendants in this case testified that they\nwere going to go fight. And you never had the\nprosecutor saying: This is an easy case; I win. The\ndefendants have all testified that they were going to go\nfight. In for a dime, in for a dollar. If they were\ngoing to go fight, they're guilty. Never argued that.\nYou will not find that in the transcript or\nin the materials, Justice Breyer. What you will find is\nthe prosecutor consistently arguing they knew they were\ngoing to facilitate a homicide, a shooting, a murder.\nAnd given that this is a case brought under AEDPA and\nthe question is whether the PRP court's decision is an\nunreasonable application of Federal law, I don't think\nthere's any doubt that it's not an unreasonable\napplication, and, therefore, this Court should reverse\nthe Ninth Circuit.\nIf there are no more questions.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
