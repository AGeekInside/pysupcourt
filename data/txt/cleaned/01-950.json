Lyons, Jr., and a companion case.\nMr. Englert.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF ROY T. ENGLERT, JR.\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. ENGLERT: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and\nmay it please the Court:\nThis is a case of inventive statutory\ninterpretation by the Ninth Circuit. The statute at issue\ndirects the courts how to construe this act or any other\nprovision of law, yet the Ninth Circuit interpreted the\nstatute rather inventively as an exemption from a\nprovision of the Constitution. The statute protects\nCalifornia statutes and regulations regarding two aspects\nof California's composition regulation of packaged fluid\nmilk, yet the Ninth Circuit interpreted the statute,\nrather inventively, as an exemption for all aspects of\nCalifornia's economic regulation of raw milk.\nInventiveness may have a role to play in some\ncases of statutory interpretation, but not when the\ngoverning legal standard requires that Congress has made\nits intent unmistakably clear. The Ninth Circuit's\nstatutory holding should be reversed.\nThere is also a constitutional issue before the\nCourt involving the Privileges and Immunities Clause of\nArticle 4. The Ninth Circuit should be reversed on that\nissue as well, but not because it was overly inventive.\nThe Ninth Circuit simply ignored, with no explanation at\nall, binding precedent from this Court requiring that\ncourts look beyond the face of the statute to determine\nwhether, in practical effect, it draws a distinction based\non citizenship or residency.\nThe California statutes and regulations at issue\nin this case draw a distinction based on where milk is\nproduced, and 93 percent of dairy farmers live on their\nfarms. To draw a distinction based on the State of\nproduction is, in effect, to draw a distinction based on\nthe State of residency, and the distinction should be\nsubject to scrutiny under the Privileges and Immunities\nClause. We do not --\nQUESTION: But as far as that clause is\nconcerned it wouldn't help you with the corporate, if you\nhad a corporate farmer. It would only work for\nindividuals.\nMR. ENGLERT: Only the individual petitioners\nare entitled to invoke the Privileges and Immunities\nClause, yes, and there are individual petitioners.\nQUESTION: There are two individual petitioners\nI think in this group, is that so?\nMR. ENGLERT: A -- a husband and wife, Darrel\nand Diane Kuiper, yes.\nLet me return to the statutory issue. This act\nor any other provision of law in section 144 means\nstatutory or regulatory law, not the Constitution. Why do\nI say that? Number 1, section 144 is phrased as a\ndirective to courts about how to construe particular\nbodies of law. Congress doesn't have the power to tell\ncourts how to construe the Constitution.\nIt does have the power to tell courts how to\nconstrue congressional silence or inaction, and the\nMcCarran-Ferguson Act is a good example of the kind of\nphraseology Congress uses when it wants to enact a\nCommerce Clause exemption, but section 144 is a poor\ncandidate from the outset.\nNumber 2, the canons of construction applied in\nnumerous decisions of this Court, most recently the\nKeffler case in February, required that a general phrase\nlike, other provision of law, be construed by reference to\nthe phrases that came before. Federal statutory and\nregulatory law is naturally paired with this act, but\nwould be very odd to throw the Constitution in as an\nafterthought through use of the phrase, other provision of\nlaw.\nNumber 3, the legislative history is devastating\nto respondents' position. The absence of a single\nreference to the Constitution anywhere in the legislative\nhistory is quite significant, but it's not the strongest\nrefutation of respondents' argument in the legislative\nhistory. Rather, the very first paragraph of explanation\nof section 144 in the conference report describes it as,\nquote, an exemption from the preemption provisions of any\nFederal law respecting standards of identity and labeling\nfor fluid milk, close quote. That can be found on page 33\nof the blue brief.\nNumber 4, and this is merely the clincher that\nbuilds on the first three points, the standard is whether\nCongress has been unmistakably clear in passing a Commerce\nClause exemption. The evidence is so strongly the other\nway that one might call it unmistakably clear that\nCongress did not pass a Commerce Clause exemption, but\nit --\nQUESTION: This argument's probably better\naddressed to the respondents than -- than you, but do you\nunderstand the respondents to argue that the percentage\nof -- of milk solids which is one, and labeling, which is\nthe second part of the statute, simply will cease to exist\nif -- if this pricing regulation is not upheld?\nMR. ENGLERT: No, that -- I don't understand\nthat to be their contention.\nQUESTION: I -- I thought that that was going to\nbe -- when I got into the case I thought, well, they're\ngoing to say that it's just impossible to have the\nlabeling, but I -- I don't understand them to argue that.\nI can ask them, of course, but --\nMR. ENGLERT: I -- I don't understand them to\nargue that either, Justice Kennedy. I think the strongest\nform their argument takes is, there is a relationship\nbetween economic regulation of raw milk and compositional\nregulation of packaged fluid milk, and any relationship is\nenough to satisfy this statute.\nQUESTION: Well, is it true that the pricing and\npooling laws were adopted to help the milk producers\ncomply with the fluid milk content provisions?\nMR. ENGLERT: I -- I don't think that's\nfactually accurate, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: That was what the attorney in the\nShamrock case conceded.\nMR. ENGLERT: Not -- not --\nQUESTION: You don't agree?\nMR. ENGLERT: I'm sorry, Justice O'Connor. He\ndid not concede that. What he did concede was that the\nfortification allowance --\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. ENGLERT: -- which is a particular provision\nof the stabilization plan, that is the pricing plan, not\nthe pooling plan, was adopted to help compliance with\nCalifornia's composition standards.\nQUESTION: And section 7254 does use the word\nindirectly.\nMR. ENGLERT: It does, Your Honor, but it's very\ninteresting to look at the parallel phrasing of section\n144 of the Farm Bill, 7 U.S.C. 7254, and the preemption\nprovision of the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act,\nwhich is 21 U.S.C. section 343-1. Both use the phrase\ndirectly or indirectly.\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. ENGLERT:\nNLEA, Congress was talking about was -- what was\npreempted, and it was saying anything a State does\ndirectly or indirectly to have labeling requirements\ndifferent from Federal law is preempted.\nWhat section 144 of the Farm Bill does is, it\nunpreempts California's standards for milk.\nQUESTION: Right.\nMR. ENGLERT: Now, unless California is prepared\nto say that it's entire pooling and pricing plans were\npreempted by the NLEA in 1990, which I don't think you're\ngoing to hear from Mr. Urban, the entire pooling and\npricing plans weren't unpreempted by section 144 of the\nFarm Bill, either.\nLet me turn to the Privileges and Immunities\nClause issue.\nQUESTION: Just -- just before you get there --\nwell, maybe it's a part -- does -- do Nevada producers\nhave a -- a Federal marketing order?\nMR. ENGLERT: Nevada, yes.\nQUESTION: And Arizona as well?\nMR. ENGLERT: Yes.\nQUESTION: They -- they -- do they opt out of it\nif they want to sell the milk to -- to California\nproducers, or --\nMR. ENGLERT: Yes.\nor, to California processors, excuse me, are not regulated\nby those milk marketing orders. The -- the seller and the\nbuyer would both have to be within the marketing order for\nit to be governed by the Federal milk marketing order, I\nbelieve.\nQUESTION: I see, and -- and so far as the\nNevada and Arizona dairy farmers are concerned, they can\nsell to California without implicating any mechanisms\nunder the Federal marketing order?\nMR. ENGLERT: That's correct.\nQUESTION: Now, the court below didn't deal with\nthe Privileges and Immunities issue, right?\nMR. ENGLERT: Oh, it did actually, Justice\nO'Connor.\nQUESTION: It did.\nMR. ENGLERT: It affirmed the Rule 12(b)(6)\ndismissal.\nQUESTION: Okay.\nMR. ENGLERT: It's on page A14 --\nQUESTION: Okay.\nMR. ENGLERT: -- of the petition appendix.\nQUESTION: All right.\nMR. ENGLERT: And its only reasoning was, the\nstatutes and regulations do not, on their face, refer to\ncitizenship or residency.\nabsolutely precludes that reasoning is the Chalker case\nfrom this Court in 1919, and respondents frankly have not\neven made an argument for why Chalker should be overruled.\nOur own submission is that the 84 years since Chalker was\ndecided have strengthened its underpinnings a great deal,\nrather than undermining them.\nThe Camden case from 1984 reinforces Chalker by\nrejecting a formalistic approach to the threshold question\nof discrimination, and the Lunding case from just 5 years\nago stresses the concern with, quote, practical effect,\nclose quote, in this Court's Privileges and Immunities\nClause jurisprudence. There's just nothing to justify the\nNinth Circuit's disregard of this Court's cases.\nI'd like to reserve the balance of my time for\nrebuttal.\nQUESTION: Very well, Mr. Englert.\nMs. McDowell.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF BARBARA B. McDOWELL\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,\nSUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS\nMS. McDOWELL: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and\nmay it please the Court:\nSection 144 does not indicate with unmistakable\nclarity that Congress meant to exempt from the Commerce\nClause any California laws, much less to exempt the\nparticular raw milk pooling regulations at issue here.\nIndeed, section 144 is most naturally read as protecting\nonly a narrow set of California's fluid milk composition\nand labeling laws from invalidation only under Federal\nstatutes and regulations, not under the Constitution.\nFirst, Congress did not state or even imply that\nthe Commerce Clause is among the provisions of law from\nwhich section 144 provides protection. Section 144\ndirects how those provisions of law shall be construed,\nand Congress ordinarily does not direct this Court and the\nlower Federal courts how to construe the Constitution, and\nunder the canon that general words are known by their more\nspecific companions, the words, any other provision of law\nis understood to refer to the preceding words, this act,\nto refer only to Federal statutes and regulations\nimplementing them.\nSection -- second, section 144 protects only\nCalifornia laws regarding two specifically defined\nsubjects, the percentage of milk solids, and solid not --\nsolids not fat in fluid milk products sold at retail, and\nthe labeling of those products. The laws challenged here\ndo not concern either subject. They instead concern how\nCalifornia handlers account to the California equalization\npool for purchases of out-of-State raw milk which may or\nmay not ultimately be processed into fluid milk products\nsubject to the composition and labeling requirements.\nQUESTION: Ms. McDowell, as to the exemption\nfrom the National -- from the Nutrition and Labeling Act,\nis this -- is this a special exemption that California\nhas, or do a number of States have congressional\nexemptions from the Nutrition and Labeling Act?\nMS. McDOWELL: Well, this specific provision,\nsection 144, applies only to California.\nQUESTION: Yes, but are there similar exemptions\nin -- in effect in other States?\nMS. McDOWELL: Well, the Nutrition and Labeling\nAct does contain an exemption for maple syrup composition\nand labeling that might have been designed to benefit the\nparticular States where maple syrup is produced. I'm not\naware of the particular background of that provision.\nThere's also an adjoining provision of the 1996\nFarm Bill that provides further indication that Congress\ndidn't intend section 144 to apply to all of the pricing\nand pooling laws. That's section 143(b) on page 17 of the\njoint appendix, which authorizes the promulgation of a\nFederal milk marketing order for California if California\ndairy farmers approve of one.\nSuch a Federal milk marketing order would have\ncontained its own separate Federal pricing and pooling\nprovisions.\nCalifornia pricing and pooling provisions at issue here.\nIt seems unlikely that Congress intended in section 144 to\npreserve the very pricing and pooling laws that section\n143(b) and the Federal marketing order would supersede.\nThe legislative history reinforces --\nQUESTION: But there -- but there was no -- but\nthere is no Federal marketing order that supersedes it, or\nam I wrong there?\nMS. McDOWELL: No, it authorized the\npromulgation of one if California dairy farmers approved.\nCalifornia dairy farmers have not asked for a Federal\nmarketing order at this point.\nUnder a Federal marketing order, by the way,\nhandlers are required to treat milk from sources inside\nand outside the marketing order, marketing area similarly,\nso the same minimum pricing requirements that would apply\nto a dairy farmer within the marketing area would also\napply if milk came in from -- from outside that area.\nQUESTION: Is the Federal --\nQUESTION: Why doesn't that resolve this case?\nMS. McDOWELL: Because there -- there is no\nFederal marketing order that applies to California, and of\ncourse the --\nQUESTION: Oh, I -- I see. In other words it\nwould have to be a California marketing order treating\nNevada milk, not -- not a Nevada marketing order saying\nwhat happens when you go to California. All right.\nMS. McDOWELL: Well, if there was a Federal milk\nmarketing order for California, milk from Nevada would be\ntreated the same as milk from California. Of course,\nFederal milk marketing orders aren't subject to the\nconstraints of the Commerce Clause, as are the California\norders.\nQUESTION: Has Congress ever provided a -- an\nexemption for anything that looks like this California\npricing and pooling scheme?\nMS. McDOWELL: Not that I'm aware of, Your\nHonor. And this is a particularly unusual Commerce Clause\nexemption because it does benefit only one State. It\nseems particularly appropriate in that circumstance to\napply the clear statement rules and -- and to require an\naffirmative indication that Congress wanted to allow\nCalifornia and only California to burden out-of-State\ninterests.\nQUESTION: I thought the only thing Congress had\never -- maybe there's something else. I thought it was\nonly insurance that Congress had performed the\nextraordinary act of waiving the Commerce Clause. Isn't\nthat right?\nMS. McDOWELL:\nfamiliar instances of this --\nQUESTION: It's the only one I -- only one I\nknow of. Is there another one?\nMS. McDOWELL: There are other instances in\nwhich Congress has affirmatively authorized particular\naction by States. For example, the Northeast Bancorp case\ninvolved a -- an authorization for States to essentially\ndiscriminate against interstate commerce to prohibit\nacquisitions of local banks by out-of-State holding\ncompanies, and when Congress enacts an affirmative\nauthorization one would think that then Congress is\nremoving any impediments that Congress can remove from\nState regulation, but that's not the forum of the\nprovision at issue here. Rather, it applies only to this\nact and other provisions of law which are naturally\nunderstood to be Federal statutes and regulations.\nWith respect to the Privileges and Immunities\nClause, we agree that the court of appeals erred in\nsuggesting that a statute can violate that clause only if\nit discriminates on its face based on citizenship and --\nor residency. In Chalker, the Court recognized that a\nstatute could also violate that clause if it discriminates\nbased on some factor closely related to citizenship, such\nas the location of a person's chief business office. The\ndistinction drawn by the California regulations are\nsomewhat similar.\nThe lower courts didn't consider whether that\ndistinction is closely enough related to State citizenship\nto implicate the Privileges and Immunities Clause.\nAccordingly, we would ask that the judgment of the Ninth\nCircuit be reversed with respect to both the Commerce\nClause and the Privileges and Immunities Clause question,\nand that the case be remanded.\nQUESTION: May I ask just one just one factual\nquestion?\nMS. McDOWELL: Yes.\nQUESTION: Am I correct in thinking California\nis the only State that does not have a Federal order?\nMS. McDOWELL: That's not entirely correct,\nJustice Stevens. There are portions of other States that\nare not included in Federal marketing orders, either, I --\nI believe, and perhaps the entire State of Maine is not.\nCalifornia is unique, however, in, to the extent that it\nhas its own freestanding marketing program and, of\ncourse --\nQUESTION: Of its own, yes.\nMS. McDOWELL: -- California is the largest\neconomy.\nQUESTION: And my other question is, do you --\ndoes the Government think we have to reach the Privilege\nand Immunities issue to decide the case?\nMS. McDOWELL: Well, the Court granted\ncertiorari on the Privileges and Immunities question.\nIt's a narrow question. Ultimately, on remand, the\nPrivileges and Immunities claim may not have to be decided\nbecause a ruling in petitioners' favor on the Commerce\nClause issue would provide them all of the relief that\nthey're seeking.\nQUESTION: And it wouldn't take care of the --\nthe ruling on the statute would take care of everything,\nbut not Privileges and Immunities, because that covers\nonly individual persons, not corporations.\nMS. McDOWELL: That's correct. What we're\nsaying is that the entire case needs to be remanded for\nconsideration of the Commerce Clause claim on the merits,\nas well as the Privileges and Immunities Clause claim, and\nif the Commerce Clause question is decided in petitioner's\nfavor, all of the petitioners would benefit from that\nruling, so there might not be occasion to consider the\nPrivileges and Immunities Clause as well.\nIf there are no further questions --\nQUESTION: Thank you, Ms. McDowell.\nMr. Urban, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK J. URBAN\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. URBAN: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and\nmay it please the Court:\nThere are two distinct and separate inquiries in\nconstruing section 7254. First, does it create a Dormant\nCommerce Clause exemption for any California law, and\nsecond, what laws are within the scope of section 7254?\nAs regards the first step, it is unmistakably clear that\nCongress in adopting section 7254 intended to provide a\nDormant Commerce Clause exemption for at least\nCalifornia's milk content and labeling laws.\nAs regards the second step, the scope of section\n7254 encompasses not just the milk content and labeling\nlaws themselves, but also the various means that\nCalifornia uses to continue those laws in effect.\nQUESTION: How do you respond to your\nadversary's contention that when you use the word\nconstrue, Congress does not ordinarily tell this Court how\nto construe a provision of the Constitution?\nMR. URBAN: First of all, in the\nMcCarran-Ferguson Act statutes the Court found that there\nwas a Dormant Commerce Clause exemption. In that case\nthey used the term construe. Second of all, I don't know\nthat Congress is aware of the niceties of the difference\nbetween construe and interpret --\nQUESTION: Well --\nMR. URBAN: -- or it would have used both of\nthose words.\nQUESTION: Well, certainly, looking over a large\ngroup of statutes that Congress has enacted, there may be\nsomething to what you say.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: But I -- I do think the -- the word\nconstrued is simply out of place when Congress is saying\nsomething to this Court about how to -- how to interpret\nthe Constitution.\nMR. URBAN: But beyond that, Your Honor, the --\nthey then say, construe to preempt, prohibit, or otherwise\nlimit. If they wanted to limit the scope of the\nprotection of section 7254 merely to preempt, they\nwouldn't have added two additional phrases, and in\naddition to that, many of the preemption savings statutes\nuse the term, this act or other -- any other act of\nCongress, or lists a set of acts or regulations. They\ndon't simply have the statement of one act and then a -- a\ngeneral term like, any other provision of law.\nQUESTION: Of course, Congress is sort of at a\nloss for words, because it -- it's only the Commerce\nClause -- that's the only provision of the Constitution\nthat Congress can instruct us not to apply, so it's\nunderstandable.\nbody of law they -- they might use the word construe,\nright? I mean, we don't have any other examples of\nwhere -- unless it was the -- the Religious Freedom\nRestoration Act, which -- which we did not uphold.\nMR. URBAN: That's -- that's correct, Your\nHonor. There's two ways that Congress can act to save\nState laws. One is by a preemption savings statute, and\nthe other is by a Dormant Commerce Clause exemption. And\nbeyond that, Congress can't affect the State exercise of\nauthority through any means that involves the\nConstitution, and that, the -- the first question then is,\ndoes section 7254 create a Dormant Commerce Clause\nexemption.\nAnd then, as I indicated, the choice really is,\nis it preemption only or something more and the statute\nitself, by using the terms, prohibit or otherwise limit,\nsuggests that it is, or states directly that it is\nsomething more. If they just simply wanted to have this\nas a preemption savings statute they would have stopped at\npreemption.\nAnd again, the argument was raised, well, why\ndidn't they mention the Constitution directly. None of\nthe two areas where there have been cases in which the\nCourt has found a Dormant Commerce Clause exemption, one\nof which is the McCarran-Ferguson Act and the other of\nwhich is the Northeast Bancorp case, was there mention of\nthe Constitution. They -- they looked at -- at the total,\nat what the statute said, at what the context was in which\nthose statutes were adopted, and -- and from that\nconcluded that Congress had intended to fully regulate in\nthose areas or to provide a Dormant Commerce Clause\nexemption.\nThe petitioners have tried to use a doctrine of\nadjustum generis, the laws are interpreted in the company\nthey keep. I've never seen an application of that\ndoctrine where all you have is one statute or one item\nmentioned, and then you say any others. Usually that\ndoctrine's applied when you have three or four items.\nQUESTION: Mr. Urban, the problem, as I see it,\nis not whether they -- you might construe the language as\nbroad enough to cover the Dormant Commerce Clause, but the\nthing it saves is, legislation regarding milk solids and\nfats and so forth, and doesn't say anything about saving\npricing legislation.\nMR. URBAN: That -- that's true, Your Honor.\nThat's the second inquiry, what is the scope of the\nstatute, and they are distinct inquiries, and it would be\npossible for the Court to determine that the statute\ndoesn't cover pooling and pricing laws --\nQUESTION: Right.\nMR. URBAN: -- and still protect the Dormant\nCommerce Clause exemption from milk content and labeling\nlaws.\nQUESTION: In -- although you would not prevail\nif we so held.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. URBAN: We -- if you so held, we would be\nback to the district court on the question of whether\nthere's a Dormant Commerce Clause violation for the milk\npricing and pooling laws, but the core intent of Congress\nin enacting section 7254, which was to protect and allow\nState milk content and labeling laws to have full effect,\nthat would be protected, because we have the Shamrock\nFarms case from the Ninth Circuit that held that there was\na Dormant Commerce Clause exemption created for those\nlaws.\nI want to --\nQUESTION: I thought those laws weren't directly\nbefore the court in Shamrock. I thought the fortification\nprovision was.\nMR. URBAN: What was directly before the Court\nin the Shamrock case, Your Honor, was a challenge to the\nmilk content and labeling laws, and then the -- the other\nitem that was before the court that was specific was the\nfortification allowance, which is a small part of the milk\npricing and pooling laws, and then there was a general\nallegation involving milk pooling and pricing that, upon\nwhich there was an admission made about the laws being --\nI think it was something, interwoven.\nQUESTION: But -- but surely we're not bound by\nShamrock if -- if we consider it not to be sound, not to\nhave sound reasoning.\nMR. URBAN: That -- that's correct, Your Honor.\nIf the Court believes that there's no Dormant Commerce\nClause exemption at all --\nQUESTION: And I -- I -- and I must say, without\nknowing many of the details of -- of the pricing scheme,\nit seems to me that the labeling and -- and requirements\nfor fortification with, I guess, nonfat solids can exist\nperfectly well without your pricing scheme.\nMR. URBAN: Your Honor, as a general matter, you\ncan have composition and labeling laws without a pricing\nscheme. California's composition standards are unique\nbecause they require fortification. That produces several\nfeatures. One is that there's not a ready market to sell\ninto California with complying milk.\nIf you didn't have pricing and pooling laws and\nyou went back to the free market, you'd be subject to the\nsame boom-bust cycle that led to the creation of these\npricing and pooling laws in the first place, and when\nyou'd reached the point where the prices were very high\nand supplies were low, I think the -- the inevitable\nresult of that would be that the composition standards\nwould be undone and they'd simply revert to the Federal\nstandards.\nQUESTION: But -- but if that's so inevitable,\nit seems to me it would have been in 7254.\nMR. URBAN: I -- I don't agree with that, Your\nHonor, because I think that what Congress did in 7254, and\nthis goes to the scope of the statute, is that they\nprotected the composition and labeling laws themselves,\nand they also, by using terms like, directly or\nindirectly, establish or continue in effect, regarding\nrather than regulating, referred to something more, and\nthat something more are the means that California uses to\nenable the laws to continue in effect.\nQUESTION: That's an ingenious argument, but I\nmean, if I understand it what you're saying is that if\nwe -- if you didn't have the price controls, then\ncompetition would break out, and competition breaking out\nwould mean in -- if we were back in the thirties, that\neventually everybody would go out of business but for one\ngiant milk seller who then would raise the price so high\nthat the people really getting angry at him, as opposed to\nonly paying $18, which is considerably above the market\nlevel, they might have to pay $24, even more.\nThey'd really get angry, and this time, though\nthey don't get angry at the $18 price, they'd start really\nshipping milk in from Arizona, and once they shipped in\nmilk from Arizona, maybe that wouldn't have the fortified\nstuff in it and they'd -- they'd amend the law so that you\ncould bring it in from Arizona and down would go the\nlabeling requirement as it stands today.\nDo I understand the argument correctly? I've\nparodied a little, but I don't think I've parodied it that\nmuch.\nMR. URBAN: You did, Your Honor.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: I did. Yes, I did.\nMR. URBAN: The -- milk is an -- is an unusual\ncommodity because it can't be stored, and like any\ncommodity, it's subject to periods, and we have this a lot\nwith agricultural pricing, where you have periods of\nlow -- you have high supply and therefore you'll have a\nlow price. People leave the industry and then the cycle\nwill reverse, and it's when you reverse the cycle -- and\nthat's -- that is what happened with -- with milk that led\nto the --\nQUESTION: I thought that's --\nMR. URBAN:\nalso what occurs frequently with agricultural commodities.\nI mean, they're -- they're subject to a boom-bust cycle,\nand at some point in that cycle you're going to have\nprices that are very high, and we -- we've had that happen\nin California to some extent for other --\nQUESTION: Like --\nMR. URBAN: -- other reasons, and -- and you --\nand at that point, and it did happen in California in '99,\nas we've cited in the brief, there is a lot of pressure to\nundo the standards because they are -- they are more\nexpensive and you'll have limited supplies. I mean,\nthat's -- that's the connection.\nQUESTION: May I ask, though, are the -- the\npercentage of solids in the -- in the milk, is that\nsomething -- that's something that's not determined by the\nfarmer. That's determined by the processor, isn't it?\nMR. URBAN: The raw milk that comes to a -- a\nprocessing plant varies to some extent in the amount of\nfat and solids not fat.\nQUESTION: Right.\nMR. URBAN: Then the processor -- this is how\nCalifornia's processors are different from other\nStates' -- adds in solids not fat in order to meet the\nstandards, and they have -- you know, this is all\nmechanized.\nQUESTION: And that is done even if the milk\nwhen it left the farm was deficient in fat solids.\nMR. URBAN: Correct.\nQUESTION: Yes.\nQUESTION: Generally speaking, what percentage\nof the raw milk comes in from out of State to California,\nof the total?\nMR. URBAN: My recollection is somewhere around\n10 to 15 percent, most of which comes to fluid milk\nplants, which are the class 1 plants.\nQUESTION: So it's generally a small percentage.\nI'm -- I'm not sure that I think that you're dire\nconsequences scenario would play out.\nDo milk prices tend to rise and fall over a wide\nregion of the United States at the same time, or does it\ntend to be very spotty?\nMR. URBAN: California's prices rise and fall as\nan independent market. I don't know what happens in other\nparts of the United States, and I want to -- aside from\nthe sort of economic theory of the boom-bust cycle, it is\na fact that California's own laws say that the purpose of\nthe pooling and pricing laws is to provide supply and\nprice stability in order to allow for adequate supplies of\nfluid milk at -- at prices that are reasonable to\nconsumers, and that the purpose of --\nQUESTION: How -- how does the latter part come\nin? I mean, if we have to write this, as I understand it,\nand I'd just as soon you correct, because I don't want to\nsay something if it isn't right. This is actually a\nsimple system, it's not so complicated, and at the heart\nof it is simply, we could pretend that they want to pay\nthe dairy $16 a hundredweight indefinitely. That's\nstable.\nAnd now the problem is, although you can say to\neverybody, pay, a handler is paid $16, when they do that\nthey're going to discover cheese coming in from Wisconsin,\nand the cheesemakers are not going to be able to compete\nand still pay $16, so they figured out in California,\nhere's how we keep our cheesemakers in business. We\nsubsidize them. We pay them $2 because they can only sell\nat $14. Where do we get the money from? We get it from\nthe milk sellers.\nSo they pay $18 to pay the cheesemakers $14 so\nthat all can pay $16 to the dairies. That way, the\ncheesemakers stay in business despite Wisconsin, and the\nmilk sellers, unfortunately the retailers have to charge\nmore and the mothers have to pay more for their milk, but\nthat in a way helps the people who want to eat a lot of\ncheese. We don't know what happens to them if they eat\ntoo much cheese, but --\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: -- there we are.\nBut I mean, that seemed to me the essence of the\nsystem, and since that's the model that's in my mind, and\nsince it could become relevant, I'd like you to correct me\nif I'm not right.\nMR. URBAN: That -- that's -- that is the wrong\nmodel.\nQUESTION: All right.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. URBAN: The --\nQUESTION: And what is the right model?\nMR. URBAN: The right model is that the -- the\nprices are generally set, and they're recalibrated\nregularly, based on certain free market markers, like\nvarious cheese exchanges, et cetera, and then there are\nways for each of the prices to be adjusted, the class 1,\nclass 2, class 3, class 4 prices to be adjusted so that\nthey're -- they reflect in a sense an -- a open market,\nand there's also a desire to have these prices be\ncomparable to the prices that are being paid on the, in\nthe Federal marketing orders so that that doesn't produce\nproblems, so there's not a subsidy from one class of use\nto another class of use.\nWhat there was was then a blending when you come\nto the producers of their revenues, and that's the pool,\nand that blending of revenues, they adopted a two-tiered\nsystem. One was a quota system, and one was all other\nprices, and that really was set up because the\nquota-holders had contracts and commercial dealings with\nclass 1 dealers which -- for which they got a higher\nprice, and the goal was to protect those -- those rights\nand reflect those rights in the difference between a quota\nprice and an everything-else price.\nQUESTION: Is it true that in-State producers of\nraw milk are guaranteed a minimum price for their milk\nunder the California scheme, but out-of-State producers\nare not?\nMR. URBAN: That -- that's exactly right. The\nin-State producers are regulated. They get a guaranteed\nminimum price. Out-of --\nQUESTION: Yes, and the out-of-State producers\nare not.\nMR. URBAN: Right.\nQUESTION: They're at a disadvantage to that\nextent.\nMR. URBAN: They're at both an advantage and a\ndisadvantage. They're not regulated, so they have the\ndisadvantage that they don't have a guaranteed minimum\nprice, but they have the advantage that they can compete\non price, so if they want to be efficient and undersell\nCalifornia producers they can do that, so they have both a\nbenefit and -- both sides have a benefit and burden. One\nis of regulation versus nonregulation.\nI want to go into the legislative history of\nsection 7254, which was mentioned. When section 7254 was\nadopted, the Federal law NLEA preempted California milk\ncontent standards, but that law only applied to fluid milk\nin interstate commerce. The House conference committee\nreport which petitioners cite not only described the\npreemption issue, but it also said that the purpose of\nadoption of 7254 was to allow California to fully enforce\nand apply its -- its standards.\nIt would have made little sense, in light of\nthat congressional intent, for Congress to on the one hand\nallow for a exemption from preemption but at the same time\nallowed the exact same body of law to be subject to a\nDormant Commerce Clause challenge, which is, in fact, what\nhappened in the Shamrock case, yet that would occur, that\nundermining of Congress' intent to have California be able\nto fully enforce its own milk content standards, if\nsection 7254 were held to be only a preemption savings\nstatute.\nWe've touched on the issue of the scope of\nsection 7254, and we're not claiming that the unmistakably\nclear standard applies to the scope, and we're certainly\nnot claiming that it's unmistakably clear that section\n7254 applies separately to pricing and pooling laws. What\nwe're claiming is that section 7254 not only covers the\nlaws themselves, but the means to keep those laws in\neffect, and in answer to questions --\nQUESTION: Who's your authority for that, for\nthe extension of the unmistakably clear principle?\nMR. URBAN: That it doesn't extend to --\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. URBAN: First of all, we couldn't find a\nsingle case where the Court has come back, after it's\ndetermined there's a Dormant Commerce Clause exemption,\nfor example with the business of insurance, come back and\neach time it decides what is the business of insurance,\nthat it says this is a Dormant Commerce clause exemption\nso we have to use an unmistakably clear standard.\nThe Court has interpreted, after it's found a\ngeneral area of law that -- in which there's a Dormant\nCommerce Clause exemption, that it's interpreted then what\nis within that area of the law using standard rules of\nstatutory construction, and -- and --\nQUESTION: And the cases would be what,\nBenjamin, something like that?\nMR. URBAN: Yes.\nBenjamin, but then when the Court's come back, for\nexample, in Royal Drug to look at what's the business of\ninsurance, they've used standard -- you've used standard\nrules of -- of statutory construction.\nAnd you know, that -- that makes a certain\namount of sense here, because you know, you have both a\npreemption savings statute and a Dormant Commerce Clause\nexemption in the same statute, which is the case -- if you\nhave a Dormant Commerce Clause exemption you'd have to\nessentially have two sets of rules as to how you interpret\nthe, what is being affected by that -- that exemption, one\nfor preemption and one for a Dormant Commerce Clause\nexemption.\nThat -- that doesn't -- doesn't seem logical.\nThey should -- whatever Congress intended be covered by\nthe law should be interpreted the same, whether it's a\nCommerce Clause exemption or a preemption exemption.\nThe second issue before the Court is the\nPrivileges and Immunities Clause, and when this issue was\nconsidered by the Ninth Circuit they ruled that because\nthe out-of-State dairy producers were not being regulated\nbased on their residency, but that the regulatory scheme\ninvolved place of production, that the -- that the\nPrivileges and Immunities Clause didn't apply.\nThat is fairly unexceptional, because the\npurpose of the Privilege and Immunities Clause is that it\napplies when a State law deprives a nonresident who enters\na State to engage in some protective privilege, that\nthey're entitled to the same privilege and immunities as a\nresident of that State. There's no entry into the State\nby -- by the dairy farmers from Arizona -- if they came\ninto the State to produce milk, they'd be treated exactly\nthe same as --\nQUESTION: What do you do with the Chalker case?\nMR. URBAN: The Chalker case is a case where\nthere's -- there was different regulation when you came\ninto the State. There was a tax if you did business in --\nyou came into Tennessee and did business. There, the\nquestion was, they -- they didn't say residency per se.\nThey said --\nQUESTION: Chief office.\nMR. URBAN: -- place of -- yes, chief office of\nbusiness, and I think the Court correctly found, based on\ntheir common experience and knowledge, that that was\nsimply a pretext or a surrogate or a proxy for residency.\nThat's not the case here. Here, it's a shipment of goods,\nmilk into a State. It's -- it's a State regulatory --\neconomic regulatory scheme, essentially, that's affecting\nthe goods themselves, and that's nothing like what's\nhappened in Chalker.\nQUESTION: Well, do you support the Ninth\nCircuit's view that to be covered by the Privileges and\nImmunities Clause it has to be facially discriminatory?\nMR. URBAN: In the -- in the context of the\nstatutes that they had before them, yes. Whether that is\na --\nQUESTION: I -- I would have thought that broad\nstatement was not accurate in light of Chalker, that it\ndoesn't have to be facially discriminatory to be covered.\nMR. URBAN: The distinction in Chalker, what was\nthe discrimination was facial. It was based on where your\nplace of -- of business was.\nIf the Ninth Circuit opinion is being\ninterpreted, or would be interpreted to say that if you\nhad some transparent proxy for place of residence, like\nthey did in Chalker, that that would somehow be foreclosed\nby the Ninth Circuit's decision, I think that would be a\nmisreading of what the Ninth Circuit did. They took a\nstatute that, as they indicate, merely regulated based on\nplace of production, not on residency.\nQUESTION: The two sentences -- I hadn't\nunderstood that. They wrote two sentences on this in the\nopinion, and you're saying it's really the first sentence\nthat is the holding, that there is no violation with\nrespect to the individual dairy owners because the\nclassifications the pooling plan amendments create are\nbased on the location where milk is produced, and the next\nsentence is sort of a throw-away, and there's nothing in\nthe statute to the contrary.\nMR. URBAN: That's correct, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: That's how you -- I see.\nMR. URBAN: In -- in summation, there -- the two\nissues involving the section 7254 before the Court are\nfirst whether it establishes an exemption and second, its\nscope.\nOn the first issue we believe it's unmistakably\nclear that there is an exemption established by 7254 to\nthe Dormant Commerce Clause. As to the second issue, we\nbelieve that California's milk pooling and pricing laws\nare within the scope of section 7254.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Urban.\nMR. URBAN: Thank you.\nQUESTION: Mr. Englert, you have 11 minutes\nleft.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ROY T. ENGLERT, JR.\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nQUESTION: It -- it seems to me, Mr. Englert, it\nmake -- does make a certain amount of sense to say that\nyou should have one rule of construction for preemption\nand for Dormant Commerce Clause, and you don't have two\ndifferent rules for interpreting congressional intent with\nthe same statute.\nMR. ENGLERT: Well, Justice Kennedy, the Court\nhas said very consistently in its Dormant Commerce Clause\njurisprudence that the intent of the Congress must be\nunmistakably clear.\nQUESTION: Were -- were those statutes\npreemption statutes as well? You see, here you have a\npreemption statute --\nMR. ENGLERT: In -- in some instances, they\nwere.\nQUESTION: -- and -- and the argument is that --\nbut let's say that it was simply a preemption case that,\nwell, directly or indirectly Congress doesn't want have to\nspell out everything, so it says indirectly, so this -- so\nthis is not preempted. Then you have a Dormant Commerce\nClause and you say, well, we have a different rule for\nthat. That seems a little odd.\nMR. ENGLERT: Well, that's what the Court did in\nNew England Power Company v. New Hampshire, and the\nstatute being construed, the provision of the Federal\nPower Act being construed in that case, like the statute\nbeing construed in this case, was not so much a preemption\nclause as an unpreemption clause.\nThe typical statute that comes before this Court\nalleged to be a Dormant Commerce Clause exemption is one\nthat says certain State laws are protected, or are\nallowed, and in many of those cases the Court has said,\nand New England Power v. New Hampshire is a good example,\nthe Court has often said yes, those State laws are not\nsubject to preemption under Federal law, but there is no\nunmistakably clear Dormant Commerce Clause exemption.\nSo the -- the Court's jurisprudence as I read it\nis really rather consistent in setting a higher standard\nfor exemptions for the Dormant Commerce Clause, and\nthere's a reason for that, and the reason for that is that\nthe Commerce Clause is part of the -- is one of the\nstructural provisions of the Constitution and, as this\nCourt pointed out in the South-Central Timber case, the\nparticularly strong rule of construction ensures that all\nStates know what's going on and have their say in Congress\nbefore the protections the States have vis-a-vis one or\nanother -- vis-a-vis one another are altered.\nQUESTION: What is the answer to the last point\non privileges and immunities? I hadn't taken that in, and\nI -- I think it's been argued on -- on your side as if\nwhat the Court had said was, well, the statute doesn't\ncreate a classification on its face, doesn't create a\nclassification based on an individual's residency or\ncitizenship, which certainly it doesn't, and then you say\nquite right, but of course a statute nonetheless could do\nthat in effect, and -- and thereby have the same violation\nthat it would have had if it had been on its face, but\nthat isn't their point, and as I reread this they're\nsaying -- I think it does say what they say it said.\nWhat the judge was saying is, wait a minute,\nthere -- there's no -- nobody here could say they're --\nthey're discriminating on the basis of residency or\ncitizenship. That's not what the statute says. It's\ndiscriminating on the basis of where the milk is produced.\nWe don't care if he's a California resident or a -- or an\nAlaska resident, it's where the milk is produced, and\nthere's nothing in the statute as I read it, says the\njudge, i.e. on its face, that says anything to the\ncontrary.\nNow, what's the answer to that argument?\nMR. ENGLERT: It's all true. It's -- it's --\nbut it was just as much of a sin for the Ninth Circuit to\nignore the 93 percent correlation between where dairy\nfarmers reside and where milk is produced as it was to\nsay, we don't look beyond the face of the statute.\nQUESTION: I see, you're saying it might violate\nthe Privileges and Immunities Clause even if -- or, why?\nMR. ENGLERT: It's -- it's exactly --\nQUESTION:\nthe Privileges and Immunities Clause for a State to\ndiscriminate against out-of-State commerce, because after\nall, out-of-State commerce is mostly produced by\nout-of-State residents?\nMR. ENGLERT: I -- I'm not making that broad an\nargument, Justice Breyer.\nQUESTION: Then what is --\nMR. ENGLERT: I'm saying that in this case, as\nin the Chalker case, there is an extremely high\ncorrelation between place of business and residency or\ncitizenship of individuals, and just as this Court said,\nwe don't care that someone from Alabama could have a\nprincipal place of business in Tennessee, because most\npeople from Alabama don't have a principal place of\nbusiness in Tennessee --\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. ENGLERT: -- so too, here, the Ninth Circuit\nshould not have cared that Nevadans could have -- could\nproduce milk in California when 93 percent of all dairy\nfarmers do produce milk in the State and, indeed, on the\nvery farm where they reside.\nQUESTION: So if Massachusetts passes a\nstatute -- you know this area better than I at the moment,\nbut if Massachusetts passes a statute and it says, we're\nfed up with nectarines from California, they're too\nwoolly, and therefore no more nectarines from California\ncoming into Massachusetts, it's absolutely true, every\nnectarine farm down there is owned by a California\nresident, none by Massachusetts residents. That violates\nthe Privileges and Immunities provision, in your opinion,\nas far as individuals own the farms?\nMR. ENGLERT: I -- I certainly suspect it's a\nviolation, but we're we're not asking this Court actually\nto hold that there's any --\nQUESTION: No, no, I know that.\nMR. ENGLERT: -- Privileges and Immunities\nviolation.\nQUESTION: I know that, but there's nothing to\nthe contrary --\nMR. ENGLERT: Just that there should be --\nQUESTION: Okay.\nMR. ENGLERT: -- substantive constitutional\nscrutiny.\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. ENGLERT: The Ninth Circuit didn't give this\ncase any substantive constitutional scrutiny.\nQUESTION: Yes, well, that's primarily the\nDormant Commerce Clause. I'm more familiar with the\nPrivileges and Immunity Clause argument. I'm less\nfamiliar with how courts in this area --\nMR. ENGLERT: Right, but on -- on both issues,\nJustice Breyer, the Ninth Circuit declined to engage in\nany substantive analysis --\nQUESTION: I know. I know.\nMR. ENGLERT: -- with respect to the Dormant\nCommerce Clause on the erroneous ground that it was\nunmistakably clear that there was a Commerce Clause --\nQUESTION: Yes, I -- I understand.\nMR. ENGLERT: -- exemption, and with respect to\nthe Privileges and Immunities Clause on the ground that\nlocation is not the same as residency or citizenship, and\nwe need not look behind location of production to ask\nwhether it is so closely correlated with residency or\ncitizenship as to create an improper -- a classification\nthat must be scrutinized under the Constitution.\nMr. Urban pointed out that the McCarran-Ferguson\nAct uses the verb construe, and rightly so, but what it\nsays the Court is not to construe as forbidding State\nregulation is Congress' silence. It is not a directive\nhow to construe the Constitution. It is a very proper\nstatute, perhaps the model for how a Dormant Commerce\nClause exemption should be written. Don't construe our\nsilence to mean we want to stop the States from doing\nsomething. The statute here is very different. The\nstatute here says, construe this act or any other\nprovision of law in particular ways.\nMr. Urban, in talking about section 7254, said\nat one point, the use of three different verbs, only one\nof which is preempts, suggests that Congress' intent was\nsomething more than merely to negate Federal preemption.\nI respectfully submit that suggesting that Congress had\nmore in mind is not enough to meet the unmistakable\nclarity standard. Under Gregory v. Ashcroft, an\nunmistakable clarity standard means it would be plain to\nanyone reading the act what Congress had in mind, and\nmerely saying the use of three verbs suggests something\ndoes not make it plain to anyone reading the act.\nI do think -- Justice Stevens asked Ms. McDowell\nif the Court needs to reach the Privileges and Immunities\nClause claim. I -- I believe the Court does need to reach\nthe Privileges and Immunities Clause claim in the limited\nway we have suggested and that is because, although\nMs. McDowell correctly said the petitioners might prevail\non remand under the Commerce Clause and, indeed, I hope we\nwill, and if we do that will give all of my clients the\nrelief that they need, we also might not prevail under the\nCommerce Clause, and I think we're entitled to pursue both\nthe Commerce Clause claim and, with respect to the\nindividual petitioners, the Privileges and Immunities\nClause claim on remand.\nThe -- Justice Kennedy asked me some questions\nin my opening argument about the Federal marketing orders\nin effect in Nevada and Arizona, and I -- I perhaps didn't\nspeak with sufficient clarity about two aspects of that.\nThe Federal milk marketing orders cover parts of Nevada\nbut not other parts. Some are and some are not covered by\nFederal milk marketing orders, but in any event, it's\nworth making clear that the marketing orders fundamentally\noperate on the processors of milk, not on the producers of\nmilk, so when we say the Federal milk marketing orders\noperate in parts of Nevada, we're really talking about\nNevada processors. If you ship your milk to a California\nprocessor it -- it is at no point governed by a Federal\nmilk marketing order.\nWhatever -- with respect to the unmistakably\nclear standard, Mr. Urban made the argument that once\nyou've found an unmistakably clear Dormant Commerce Clause\nexemption, the unmistakably clear standard has no more\nrole to play and it's just a matter of ordinary statutory\ninterpretation.\nThis Court's cases, I believe, do not support\nthat proposition, but he spoke specifically about the\nMcCarran-Ferguson Act cases in which the Court has\nconstrued the phrase, business of insurance, without any\nparticular thumb on the scale.\nCourt must construe the phrase, business of insurance,\nbecause Congress has delegated authority over an entire\nbusiness to the States.\nThat's very different from this very precisely\ndrawn statute that speaks about two particular aspects of\nCalifornia's compositional regulation of raw milk and\nsaying, well, let's just resort to ordinary principles of\nstatutory interpretation to determine whether that also\nreaches economic regulation of fluid milk. The\nunmistakably clear standard is still in effect, and\ningenious arguments about the relationship between\neconomic regulation of fluid milk and composition\nregulation of raw milk are not enough to meet that\nstandard.\nIn particular, it cannot possibly be the case\nthat the 1997 amendments to California's pooling plan are\nsomehow necessary to effect composition regulation. The\nmain thing the 1997 amendments did was not negate the\npossibility that out-of-State milk would flood California\nto such an extent that there would be price effects that\nultimately would have -- would have sanitary effects.\nWhat the 1997 amendments did essentially was say, we're\ngoing to intercept some of the revenue that would\notherwise go to out-of-State processors at California's\nborder and redistribute it just to in-State interests.\nWe're going to take some of the money that they would\notherwise get in their milk transaction and say, it must\ngo to Californians, not to you out-of-Staters.\nThat's the essence of the Commerce Clause\nviolation in this case, and it's also inconceivable that\nthat kind of regulation could be protected by this\nstatute. If that kind of regulation is protected by this\nstatute, then a regulation that says 100 percent of every\nmilk check that would be written to a Nevadan must instead\ngo to a Californian is protected by this statute, i.e., no\nout-of-State milk, and that can't possibly be the\nunmistakably clear intent of Congress in section 7254.\nOne last detail, and it is just a detail.\nMr. Urban said that 10 to 15 percent of the milk that\ncomes into California is from out of State. I understand\nfrom a publication that's cited at page 39 of our opening\nbrief called Dairy Profit Weekly that the actual number is\ncloser to 3 percent. When Congressman Bill Thomas spoke\nat a field hearing -- thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you,\n"
