        "content": "(10:17 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument\nfirst this morning in Case 09-1454, Camreta v. Greene,\nand 09-1478, Alford v. Greene.\nGeneral Kroger.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN R. KROGER\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. KROGER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nIn Pearson v. Callahan, this Court gave the\nlower Federal courts discretionary power to decide\nsubstantive questions of constitutional law in qualified\nimmunity cases in order to further the development of\nconstitutional precedent. If it is valuable for the\nlower courts to decide these cases, then it is essential\nthat this Court be able to review those decisions in\norder to ensure that they are accurate. For this\nreason, the case is justiciable and should be reviewed\non the merits.\nTurning to the merits of this case, the\nCourt of Appeals held -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Not so fast.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Of course, there are two\nissues here, and I hope we do get to th substance. Can\nyou tell me Camreta's current occupation? Does the\nrecord establish that? Does the record tell us what\nCamreta is doing now? Is -\nMR. KROGER: The record does not, Your\nHonor, because the mootness issue was raised relatively\nlate in the proceedings, but I'm aware of what his\ncurrent occupation is.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Which is?\nMR. KROGER: He is a child protective\nservices worker with the Oregon Department of Human\nServices.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What I was about to ask is\nthis: I can agree with you that -- that where there is\na -- a determination on the merits, it should be\nreviewable, but could still disagree that it's\nreviewable where the requirements for Article III are\nnot met; that is, where there is really no justiciable\ncontroversy between the parties.\nWhat -- what is the interest of the -- of\nthe parties who were victorious here?\nMR. KROGER: Your Honor, the interest of Mr.\nCamreta is the ongoing harm he has in his job. Under\nthe Ninth Circuit's decision, he is forced to either\nforgo a regular and recurring duty of his job, which is\nto interview potential child victims in school, or to\nface liability for doing so.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Why would he face\nliability? Because he didn't have the opportunity to\nchallenge that decision, the Fourth Amendment decision;\ntherefore, it would have no preclusive effect on him. A\nparty who doesn't have the -- if there are alternative\nholdings and you lose on one, win on the other, you're\nnot precluded by the loss because you didn't have an\nopportunity to raise it on appeal. So why would Camreta\nbe precluded? Why would he face punitive damages as\nyou're suggesting?\nMR. KROGER: Your Honor, the Ninth Circuit\nopinion does apply to Mr. Camreta. The court\nspecifically advised Mr. Camreta and others in his\nposition that they are on notice that in-school\ninterviews of students that require a seizure require a\nwarrant, and, thus, the Ninth Circuit decision does have\nprecedential effect and impacts Mr. Camreta.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But it takes -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: General -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It takes two to tango, and\na case or controversy requires somebody on the other\nside who cares a fig about the outcome. And here, S.G.,\nwho was the -- the young woman affected in the case, has\nmoved to another State and -- making it virtually\ncertain that she'll never confront this situation again.\nShe doesn't care what the result of this thing is.\nBesides which, I think she's, what, 17 years old or so\nnow? It's impossible that she will be confronted with\nthe same situation.\nMR. KROGER: Your Honor, I disagree that\nS.G. has no ongoing concrete stake in the outcome of\nthis case. In footnote 20 of the Respondent's brief on\npage 33, the Respondent notes that they have filed a\nmotion in the United States district court to bring\ntheir Fourth Amendment claim against Deschutes County, a\npotential party that has no qualified immunity as a\ndefense. And, obviously, the legal viability of that -\nthat claim against Deschutes County will depend very\nmuch on the ruling on the merits of this Court.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: This is a Monell claim,\nand it's -- and the district court has held its ruling,\nI take it, in abeyance pending -- a ruling for\nreinstatement of that claim, pending our decision here?\nMR. KROGER: That is correct, Your Honor.\nThe district court ruled that it was premature until\nthese proceedings were concluded.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, why isn't the\nanswer, then, that that's the right case to take up?\nBecause in this case, we have a plaintiff who is not\ngoing to be confronted with this situation again and who\nhas put herself out of the running for damages because\nshe didn't -- she didn't challenge the qualified\nimmunity ruling. So she has no stake in any monetary\nrelief from this claim. She has no continuing -- the -\nwhat has happened to her, happened to her at age 9, will\nnever happen again now that she's past 18.\nSo she hasn't -- if she came to court today\nwith her case as an 18-year-old, she would have no case\nor controversy. It just seems like the whole case has\nevaporated. She has no claim. She did have a claim\nfor -- for money damages, but she has relinquished that.\nSo, what -- what genuine controversy is before us?\nMR. KROGER: Your Honor, the controversy\nremains the Fourth Amendment claim, which is the\nRespondent is seeking to pursue in the United States\ndistrict court and that gives the Respondent here a\ndirect financial stake in the viability of their Fourth\nAmendment argument, and -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sorry. Isn't\nthat -- isn't that the -- the county's claim? How\nCamreta does his job doesn't -- that claim doesn't\nbelong to him; it belongs to the entity who is telling\nhim how to do his job. And so why don't we go back to\nJustice Ginsburg's question of why isn't the Monell\nsituation the proper case? Because there, it's the\nparty interested in how its officers will do their job\nat its directive. It has the case and controversy at\nissue, not S.G.\nRight now, she's never going to be\ninvestigated again. She's in another State. I\nunderstand that she doesn't even ever want to return to\nOregon for, probably, fairly good reasons, at least from\nher perspective. So, again, why isn't this the\ninterests of the county, not -- not the interests of the\nofficer?\nMR. KROGER: Your Honor, in Arizonans v.\nArizona, the Court recognized that the employee in that\ncase had an interest in how she was able to conduct her\njob. The Court decided that the case was -- was moot\nbecause she had resigned from her position with the\nState. But there was no objection to -- to her standing\nbecause she was a public employee that wanted to perform\nher job in a particular way because she was required to\nunder State law, and here -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: She was the plaintiff.\nIn Arizona, we were talking about whether a plaintiff\nstill had a viable claim, right?\nMR. KROGER: That is correct, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: General Kroger, I don't\nthink that the question here is really a standing\nquestion; it's really whether there is a controversy\nbetween this particular plaintiff and this particular\ndefendant such that a judgment in this case would\nactually affect the legal relationship between the two,\nbetween the particular plaintiff and the particular\ndefendant.\nSo how would it do that? How would a legal\njudgment in this case affect the legal relationship\nbetween this plaintiff and this defendant?\nMR. KROGER: Your Honor, the -- the -- Mr.\nCamreta remains a party below, and it's possible that\nthe Court's rulings on the Fourth Amendment merits may\nimpact the Fourteenth Amendment claims that are being\nmade against Mr. Camreta that are alive and in\ncontroversy below.\nMoreover, this case, even if one strips out\nthe ongoing motion that's been made in the district\ncourt, resembles in all material respects Erie v.\nPap's A.M., where the Court found that there was\nstanding to bring the case and it was not moot. And so,\nthere does seem to be an active case or controversy that\nis equivalent to that that was present in Erie v.\nPap's A.M.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: How does it affect the\nFourteenth Amendment? There's a Fourteenth Amendment\nclaim pending below?\nMR. KROGER: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And what's the substance of\nthat?\nMR. KROGER: It is a claim of Mrs. Greene to\ninterference with familial rights as a result of certain\nactions by Mr. Camreta and other defendants.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But that didn't have to\ndo with the school search -- the school seizure?\nMR. KROGER: That is correct, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So -- and this case\npresents the question about was this unreasonable? That\n-- what's left in the case has to do with the mother's\nclaim, and it has to do with putting the girls in\ncustody, right?\nMR. KROGER: That is correct, Your Honor.\nSo the -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, if we were to\nhold this case was moot, what would -- what do you think\nthe appropriate disposition of the case would be?\nMR. KROGER: Your Honor, I believe if the\nCourt determined that this case was moot, the -- the\nappropriate remedy would be pursuant to Munson where -\nto vacate the Ninth Circuit decision.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, you don't really\nwant that, because the Ninth Circuit granted qualified\nimmunity. What would be -- what would we be vacating?\nThey haven't rendered a judgment on the search warrant\nissue.\nMR. KROGER: That is correct, Your Honor.\nWhat -- what I think the appropriate remedy for the\nCourt would be would be to effectively -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Vacate the opinion.\nMR. KROGER: -- vacate the opinion or\ndecision on the Fourth Amendment claim.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That would make you happy,\nwon't it? Won't that make you happy?\nMR. KROGER: Yes, Your Honor. The -- the --\nI think the only difficulty with that as a -- as a\noutcome of the case is it undercuts the logic of the\nPearson decision.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It doesn't just do\nthat. Is -- is Mr. Camreta in any more comfortable\nposition when he knows that the Ninth -- what the Ninth\nCircuit thinks on this issue and he just has to wait\nuntil there's another case when they can impose the view\nthat they've already spelled out? I know as a technical\nmatter it's not binding, but if you're Camreta, do you\nsay, well, the Supreme Court vacated that decision, so I\ncan go ahead and do this again and not have to worry\nabout personal liability?\nMR. KROGER: You're correct, Your Honor. It\nwould place Mr. Camreta and other child protective\nservices workers in the Ninth Circuit in a very -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: There are different panels\non the Ninth Circuit, aren't there?\nMR. KROGER: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And -- and they don't all\nhold the same thing, fortunately, do they?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. KROGER: They do they do not, Your\nHonor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: They're supposed to\nfile circuit -- follow circuit precedent, aren't they?\nMR. KROGER: That is correct, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But an opinion that is\nvacated is not circuit precedent, is it?\nMR. KROGER: It is not, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Mr. Camreta would be\nprotected. He would presumably still be entitled to\nqualified immunity because a vacated alternative holding\ncertainly could not really establish something, I would\nassume. But municipalities, if they continue to\nparticipate in -- in questioning of this nature, would\nnot be protected; isn't that right?\nMR. KROGER: That is correct, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What happened in -\nwhat -- what has Oregon done in response to this Ninth\nCircuit decision? Before it said that the caseworkers\ncould have this kind of interview with the -- the child\nwhere there was a suspicion of abuse. Was there any\nchange in practice in Oregon in response to the Ninth\nCircuit's decision?\nMR. KROGER: Your Honor, that is not in the\nrecord, but I would happy -- be happy to respond. The\nState of Oregon provided legal advice advising child\nprotective services workers to attempt to avoid anything\nthat would be a seizure in a school and, in cases where\nthere would pose no risk of danger to the children, to\nseek consent of -- of a parent before conducting an\ninterview. Nevertheless, that legal advice puts a\nsignificant burden on the child protective services\nworkers to -- to do their utmost to protect Oregon's\nchildren.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: On the merits -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Excuse me -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- do you think that\nthe same approach you're following here would apply if\nthe investigation focused on the student rather than a\nthird party? Would in those cases a warrant have to be\nobtained?\nMR. KROGER: Your Honor, I think in -- in\nthose cases, because parental consent is a viable\nalternative where the allegation is a child is being\nabused by another child -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, no, not another\nchild. It could be anything. We think the child is,\nyou know, selling drugs, obviously not a 7-year-old, but\nsomeone else in the school is involved in legal\nactivity, him- or herself.\nMR. KROGER: Your Honor, I believe the -\nthe child abuse context is somewhat unique in that there\nare very few ways to investigate properly child abuse\nwithout speaking to the only witness that's typically\navailable in the case, and that is the child.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So -- so you think\nit would be a different rule if we're talking about some\nother criminal activity? The father's selling drugs,\nand you think the child might have some evidence or at\nleast be willing to talk about that. Do you need\nanything other than reasonableness in that case?\nMR. KROGER: Your Honor, it would be the\nsame reasonableness standard that would apply, but I\nthink the courts might reach different conclusions about\nwhat would be reasonable in those circumstances.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, on -- we're getting\nto the merits. Do you agree that search -- strike\nthat -- that seizure under the Fourth Amendment is the\nrelevant category here?\nMR. KROGER: Absolutely, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: You agree that the child\nwas -- was seized?\nMR. KROGER: Yes, Your Honor, we concede\nthat the child was seized.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: What -- what happens if\nthe teacher tells -- the student is misbehaving on the\nplayground: Go back in the classroom. You can't -- you\nsit there by yourself. You can't be part of recess.\nIs that a seizure?\nMR. KROGER: No, Your Honor, I -- I disagree\nthat that would be a seizure, because -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: What made this a seizure?\nThe fact that it wasn't a teacher?\nMR. KROGER: Your Honor, the reason we\nconceded the issue of seizure is we are here on -- on\nsummary judgment, and we took the facts as alleged,\nwhich involved transporting the student inside the\nschool.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but I'm -- I'm\nasking for your view of the proper category to apply in\nthese cases, and if it is a seizure, then -- then it's\njust a question of reasonableness, and we'd look at all\nthe circumstances.\nMR. KROGER: That is correct, Your Honor.\nMr. Chief Justice, I'd like to reserve the\nbalance of my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMs. Kruger.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF LEONDRA R. KRUGER,\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,\nAS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS\nMS. KRUGER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nA number of the questions this morning have\nfocused on the question whether a live case or\ncontroversy remains because Respondent has chosen not to\nchallenge the Ninth Circuit's qualified immunity ruling\nand so purportedly has no continuing stake in the\nresolution of this controversy. We think that that's\nnot correct for the reasons General Kroger has given,\nbut it's also not an irreducible minimum of this Court's\njurisdiction to correct the mistake that the Ninth\nCircuit made in this case. I think, too -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What about -- did she -\ndid she -- let's go back one step. Does she have any\nviable claim now? This is not capable of repetition,\nevasive of review?\nMS. KRUGER: Well, two responses, Justice\nGinsburg. First, as General Kroger mentioned, she has a\ncontinuing interest in how this Court resolves this\ncontroversy because of her attempt to bring the same\nFourth Amendment claim against Deschutes County. But\nsetting that aside, this Court hasn't universally\nrequired that as a prerequisite to exercising its\njurisdiction. I think there are two examples that help\nto illustrate the point.\nThe first is the City of Erie v. Pap's A.M.\ncase, in which this Court decided to review a State\ncourt injunction entered in favor of a plaintiff who no\nlonger had what we would think of as an Article III\nstake in the case by the time the case reached this\nCourt.\nThe plaintiff in that case had left the nude\ndancing business and had affirmatively stated they had\nno intention to return. The Court, nevertheless,\nreached the merits of the State court decision that was\non review because to do otherwise would be to saddle the\nCity of Erie with an ongoing injury. In the -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: There was a dissent in that\ncase, wasn't there?\nMS. KRUGER: There was indeed a dissent in\nthat case. But I would note that there was also -\n(Laughter.)\nMS. KRUGER: -- a dissent from the denial of\ncert in Bunting v. Mellen, in which very much the same\nsituation was presented. The cadets who brought the\nchallenge to the VMI supper prayer that was at issue in\nthat case had graduated from VMI by the time this case\nreached this Court. And I think, as you quite properly\nnoted in your dissent from denial of review in that\ncase, for this Court to essentially insulate those types\nof constitutional rulings from review would be to\nundermine the very purposes for which this Court -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Ms. Kruger, how does this -\nthis situation, the qualified immunity situation, differ\nfrom a wide variety of other situations in which we\nmight not be able to get to the underlying\nconstitutional ruling?\nFor example, in any case where there's a\nconstitutional ruling but also a harmless error ruling,\nor in a Sixth Amendment case where there are standards\nabout ineffective assistance of counsel but then a\nfinding that there's no prejudice. In all of those\nkinds of cases, the underlying substantive ruling might\nbe insulated from our review. How would you say that\nthe qualified immunity situation is different and how\nwould you be able to cabin this rule?\nMS. KRUGER: The reason we think the\nqualified immunity situation is different, it presents a\nset of exceptional circumstances that weren't an\nexception to the usual prudential rule, is because the\nqualified immunity situation is one in which this Court\nhas encouraged courts to undertake these kinds of\nconstitutional rulings for the purpose of changing the\nlegal landscape going forward, for the very purpose of\nestablishing the law so that the -- that qualified\nimmunity doesn't remain perpetually available to\nofficials even though they are engaging in conduct -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: But, presumably, in every\ncase -\nMS. KRUGER: -- that has been found\nunconstitutional.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Excuse me. Presumably, in\nevery case in which a court does these paired rulings,\nif you will -- it doesn't just say that the error was\nharmless, but says that there was an error -- there's a\npurpose to clarify the law. How is this different, once\nagain?\nMS. KRUGER: I think that in this situation\nwhat we have is not just a preview of how the court of\nappeals would decide the case subsequently in a case in\nwhich it was actually necessary to reach a certain\njudgment. What we have is a decision that changes the\nlegal landscape going forward. It establishes the law\nsuch that qualified immunity will not be available in\nthe next case. And it means that people like Petitioner\nCamreta and other child protective services workers who\nare doing their best to protect children from abuse are\nnow on notice that if they attempt to detain temporarily\na child in school for the purposes of trying to confirm\nor dispel a reasonable suspicion of child abuse without\na warrant supported by probable cause, that they will\ninvite lawsuits that would put them on the line for\npersonal monetary damages.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But that wouldn't be the\ncase if the opinion were vacated -\nMS. KRUGER: That's true.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- under Munsingwear?\nMS. KRUGER: That's true, Justice Scalia,\nand I think that if that's the disposition that this\nCourt thinks is appropriate, we would be certainly be\nhappier with that than a rule that says -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It would be -\nMS. KRUGER: -- an incorrect constitutional\nruling.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It would be a\npartial vacatur, right? The Court's done that before,\nhasn't it, where we vacate part of a decision under\nMunsingwear?\nMS. KRUGER: That's correct, Mr. Chief\nJustice. But I would note that a vacatur rule would\ncome with certain costs that I think this Court should\nkeep in mind as it decides what the appropriate\ndisposition of this case is.\nThe reason that Respondent has so vigorously\nobjected to that disposition is because it is\ninconsistent in some ways with the very reason for\npermitting courts of appeals to undertake this kind of\nconstitutional determination in the first place. It\nundermines the -- the development of the constitutional\nlaw if this Court simply wipes the -- the slate clean\nbut doesn't exercise its own authority to clarify the\nlaw by correcting what the Ninth Circuit has done. And\nI think, as the Chief Justice has quite correctly\npointed out, it also does nothing to dispel the cloud of\nuncertainty that hangs over individuals within the\nterritorial jurisdiction of the Ninth Circuit.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I'm not so\nsure he was correct. The -\n(Laughter.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If it's vacated, it\nindicates that there's no established law on that\nquestion, and it seems to me Camreta would be free to do\nwhat he considered appropriate under the circumstances,\nand if somebody tries to impose personal liability on\nhim, it seems he has an even stronger case than he might\nhave before.\nMS. KRUGER: I think that's correct, Mr.\nChief Justice, and I think for that reason we would not\nobject to that disposition in this case. We would just\nobserve that that disposition is one that does not sit\nparticularly comfortably with the reasoning of Pearson\nand the line of cases that comes before it, that\nrecognizes that the reason why we encourage courts of\nappeals to undertake these determinations in the first\nplace is to promote the development of constitutional\nlaw and to ensure that the law doesn't remain not\nclearly established in perpetuity.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: It seems to me it would\naffect Camreta's behavior and that of other child\nprotective officers. The lawyer would explain: Now,\nlegally this is not binding; it just never happened.\nBut three judges of the court of appeals in a reasoned\ndecision have explained why this is contrary to the\nConstitution, and it would seem to me that any\nconscientious law enforcement officer would -- would\ntake that seriously into account.\nMS. KRUGER: I think that's absolutely\nright, Justice Kennedy.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why? What's the test?\nIsn't the test clearly established law?\nMS. KRUGER: That's right.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Would this be clearly\nestablished law under any -- any conceivable\ninterpretation of that?\nMS. KRUGER: I think it's -- it's true that\nif this Court were to vacate the Ninth Circuit's\nconstitutional ruling, Mr. Camreta and others who are\nsimilarly situated wouldn't face the very significant\nconcrete prospective effect of this decision, which is\nto strip them of qualified immunity in future cases.\nThey would be able to argue, as you're suggesting, that\nthe law is not clearly established. At the same time -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: If we told them -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You have very limited\ntime. Could you -- could you go to the merits of the\nFourth Amendment question and give us the Government's\nposition on that?\nMS. KRUGER: Certainly, Justice Ginsburg.\nThe Ninth Circuit in this case held that the temporary\ndetention of a child in school to confirm or dispel\nsuspicions that that child is being abused is\nunconstitutional unless the questioning officials have a\nwarrant, probable cause, or parental consent. We think\neach of those requirements is unjustified as a matter of\nFourth Amendment law and imposes a serious burden on the\nconduct of the -- of the government at the initial\nstages of a child abuse investigation. As -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, would -- I'm\ninterrupting you only for a quick reason. What's the\ntest? Is it a question of whether the seizure is\nreasonable or not?\nMS. KRUGER: That's correct, Justice\nSotomayor. The question is reasonableness.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. So -- so\nthat would be your proposed test. If we were to say you\ndon't need any of those three things right now, where\nwould that leave us or leave the courts below on\ndetermining whether what happened here was reasonable or\nnot? Meaning, what if a child is called in and says, I\ndon't want to talk to you without my mom; and they\ncontinue to speak to the child? Is that reasonable?\nMS. KRUGER: I think that the answer is that\nwould go to the -- the question of the manner in which\nthe -- the interview is conducted, as opposed to whether\nit's -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So how do we -\nMS. KRUGER: -- reasonable at its inception.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How do we develop the\nlaw, or how do we help develop the law in this case if\nwe answer your question but leave unanswered with no\nparameters, any idea -- because we have no set of facts;\nno one's going to review that question -- of what is\nreasonable in this context?\nMS. KRUGER: Well, the question that the\nNinth Circuit answered in this case was a question that\nconcerns the justification for the interview at its\ninception. The Ninth Circuit said a warrant, probable\ncause, or parental consent is required from the very\noutset. That would be true whether an interview lasted\n2 hours or 10 minutes, whether the child was responsive,\nwhether the child wasn't.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That -- you see, that's\nthe problem with taking up a case with no case in\ncontroversy, because what do we do? We don't remand for\nthem to reach the second question, which is really the\none that law enforcement needs some help on.\nMS. KRUGER: Well, I -- I would disagree\nwith that proposition. I think law enforcement very\nmuch needs help on the questions the Ninth Circuit\nactually decided because the warrant or probable cause\nrequirement is one that has a very significant effect on\nthe way that they carry out their very important\nbusiness in this area.\nIf the Court has no further questions -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMs. Kubitschek.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF CAROLYN A. KUBITSCHEK\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMS. KUBITSCHEK: Thank you. Mr. Chief\nJustice, and may it please the Court:\nThere is no case or controversy between S.G.\nand the Petitioners. That ended when -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Then why are you -\nwhy are you here?\n(Laughter.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You're not\nchallenging the qualified immunity ruling?\nMS. KUBITSCHEK: Precisely.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yet, you have -\nyet, you have -- why didn't you just go away?\n(Laughter.)\nMS. KUBITSCHEK: Mr. Chief Justice, we are\nnot here voluntarily.\n(Laughter.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, I know that.\nBut why -\n(Laughter.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I do know that. But\non the other hand, you had no -- you could have filed a\npaper saying we have no continuing interest in the case,\nbut you haven't done that. You've fought the legal\nissues on the merits in -- in an area where it's been\nsuggested you don't have a stake.\nMS. KUBITSCHEK: We -- S.G. does not have a\nlegally cognizable stake, Your Honor. She won a moral\nvictory when she obtained a ruling in her favor on the\nFourth Amendment claim in the Ninth Circuit, but as this\nCourt said in Hewitt v. Helms, a moral victory is no\nvictory at all, but -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you have\nobjection if we entered a Munsingwear order vacating the\ndecision of the Ninth Circuit on the merits of the\ndispute?\nMS. KUBITSCHEK: Well, Your Honor, the -- we\nwould submit that the Munsingwear test would not apply\nin this case because Munsingwear, which permitted\nvacating a decision when it became moot, talked about\ndecisions which become moot through happenstance, and -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, again -\nMS. KUBITSCHEK: -- the reason for that is\nbecause of preclusion. I'm sorry.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry. Again, I\nget to the question, why do you care? Why do you care\nwhether we vacate the -- the order or not? Your\nposition is your client has no continuing interest in\nthe case.\nMS. KUBITSCHEK: That -- our client has no\nlegally binding, legally cognizable interest in the\ncase. She has an interest in protecting her moral\nvictory, as do -- and in the issue, as do the many amici\nwho filed briefs on her behalf.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: She's asserting the\ninterests of other children who would be in the\nsituation that she was once in, but no longer; but we\nhave said the plaintiff herself must have a live\ncontroversy, and there was no class action here.\nMS. KUBITSCHEK: That -- that is correct,\nJustice Ginsburg. She does not have an interest, and\nthe case is moot.\nJUSTICE ALITO: But you want to have the\nFourth Amendment decision preserved and have it govern\nan enormous chunk of the country so that all the States\nin the Ninth Circuit have to comply with it, and anybody\n-- any individual officer who doesn't comply with it\nwould do so on pain of personal liability, but you don't\nwant that ground-breaking decision to be subject to\nreview by this Court on the merits. Is that a summary\nof what you want? Does that make any sense?\nMS. KUBITSCHEK: Your Honor, the -- the case\n-- if the case is truly as important to other employees\nof the States in -- within the confines of the Ninth\nCircuit, it will arise again, and this Court will have\nthe opportunity to decide the issue again between\nparties who have a live stake in the issue; or it will\narise in another circuit, and it will present a live\ncontroversy between parties who have a stake.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So, you want us -- so\nMunsingwear. You don't want us just to leave it sitting\nbecause there's no controversy; you want us to erase\nthat holding below, right?\nMS. KUBITSCHEK: No, Your Honor, we would\nnot ask the holding below be erased. That's -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, then -- then the\nanswer you just gave doesn't make any sense. You say it\ncan -- you know, it can arise again. That would be the\nanswer of someone who wants us to eliminate the holding\nhere: Don't worry; it will come up again in a context\nwhere, on appeal, somebody will have an interest in\narguing to -- to sustain it, but that interest doesn't\nexist here. That's the argument you're making, but\nthat's the argument of someone -\nMS. KUBITSCHEK: I'm sorry -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- who wants us to\nMunsingwear.\nMS. KUBITSCHEK: I'm sorry, Your Honor, I\nmisspoke. It will come up -- if it is as -- if the\npractice is as widespread as the Petitioners claim, it\nwill come up again in other circuits, and this Court\nwill have the opportunity to review it and -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but Justice Alito's\nquestion was addressed to the Ninth Circuit. In the\nNinth Circuit, it's not going to come up again if we\nassume that our public employees are going to be\nlaw-abiding. They're bound by this in the Ninth\nCircuit.\nMS. KUBITSCHEK: Well, Your Honor, I\nguess that's -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And you -- and you want\nthem to be bound, and yet you say there's -- that the\ncase is moot. I just don't understand it.\nMS. KUBITSCHEK: Well, Your Honor, that\nleads to the question of what exactly are they bound by?\nAnd our reading of the court of appeals decision is not\nnearly as broad as the Petitioners' reading. The court\nof appeals said specifically our caseworkers and police\nofficers are always allowed to question children in a\nprotractive custodial setting with -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Where are you reading in\nthe holding of the court of appeals? Because I was\nunder the impression that they did say there's only\nthree ways: One is you get a warrant; another is you\nget parental consent; and a third is exigent\ncircumstances. I thought that was the -- the ruling of\nlaw by the Ninth Circuit.\nMS. KUBITSCHEK: That was -- that was the\nruling as it applied to S.G. herself, Justice Ginsburg.\nThis was not a class action lawsuit, and the court was\ndeciding what happened to one 9-year-old child on\nFebruary 24th, 2003.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, let's see where\nthey -- I thought that, yes, the case is about a single\nplaintiff; it's not a class action. But they're making\na rule of law. What does the Fourth Amendment require?\nMS. KUBITSCHEK: Okay. On page 1022, Your\nHonor, it says: \"We consider the relatively\nstraightforward question whether an in-school seizure\nand interrogation of a suspected child abuse victim is\nalways permissible under the Fourth Amendment without\nprobable cause and a warrant or the equivalent of a\nwarrant.\" And the court -- and the court said: No, not\nalways and not in this case.\nAnd if this Court does reach the merits\nof -- of this case, we would ask this Court to uphold a\nrule that -- stating that a protracted custodial\ninterview of a child by police and child welfare\ninvestigators is presumptively unconstitutional unless\nthey have a warrant or court order or parental consent\nor exigent circumstances.\nJUSTICE ALITO: What is there in the Ninth\nCircuit's opinion, which -- which generally requires a\nwarrant, to suggest that the length of the interrogation\nwas relevant to their decision? I mean, at least the\nchild protective services need to decide whether they\nneed a warrant before they begin the questioning, no\nmatter how long it's going to last.\nWhere does it say that the length is\nrelevant to the -- to the issue that they decided?\nMS. KUBITSCHEK: Well, Your Honor, the -\nthe length of the questioning has been historically\nimportant to this Court's jurisprudence. It\ndistinguishes, for example, between a Terry stop and a\nseizure. And this Court said, for example, in the\nUnited States v. Place, that a 90-minute detention is -\nfalls out of the realm of a Terry stop and into the\nrealm of a seizure for which full Fourth Amendment\nprotections are required of a criminal suspect. And\nthis Court has also said, in Soldal v. Cook County, that\nit would be anomalous if people who are not suspected of\nany wrongdoing at all had fewer Fourth Amendment\nprotections than -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't understand. It\nseems like a very strange rule to me. You mean it's\nokay for a child protection worker to just ask the child\npassing in the hall, you know, has your -- or not\npassing in the hall. Come into this room, I have a\nquestion for you: Has your father been abusing you?\nAnd if the child says yes, thank you, and the child\ngoes, then that's okay?\nMS. KUBITSCHEK: We would -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Because it was a short\ninterview?\nMS. KUBITSCHEK: The -- I didn't mean to -\nthat the length of the interview is the only factor,\nYour Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Oh.\nMS. KUBITSCHEK: One of the other factors is\nthat the -- that the seizure is determined by the fact\nthat the police and child welfare worker removed the\nchild or removed any individual from the place where she\nis -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Right. Take her into a\nroom. I see that.\nMS. KUBITSCHEK: -- and bring her to another\nplace, and then -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But once they take her in a\nroom, it depends on how long the interview is; is that\nright?\nMS. KUBITSCHEK: That -- that goes to the\nquestion of whether or not there was a seizure.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Whatever.\nMS. KUBITSCHEK: In this case, it was\nstipulated that there was a seizure.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: We're talking about rules\nfor the future; we're not talking about this case, and\nyou're asking us to adopt a rule for the future that\nsays if it's very brief, it's okay, but if it's longer\nit isn't okay. Right? That's what you want us to\nadopt?\nMS. KUBITSCHEK: That -- that if -- if it\nwere very brief and the child was not removed from her\nclassroom -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No, no, no, no. Removed.\nThere has been a seizure, but it's been a very brief\nseizure, just as a Terry stop is a very brief seizure.\nMS. KUBITSCHEK: Our position would be that\nbecause the -- of the importance of consent here to a\nseizure, that the -- that there would need to be a court\norder to remove a child from her classroom and to take\nher to another room and then -\nJUSTICE ALITO: On the issue -\nMS. KUBITSCHEK: -- or parental consent.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So you're changing your\nposition: You need a court order, no matter how brief;\nis that it?\nMS. KUBITSCHEK: I think that has been our\nposition, and I'm sorry if I didn't make it clear.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, okay.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, on the issue of\nconsent, do you read the Ninth Circuit's opinion as\nhaving an age limit? Suppose that the child is, let's\nsay, 16 years old. Is the child at 16 incapable of\nconsenting to questioning?\nMS. KUBITSCHEK: Well, the way that we read\nthe Court of Appeals decision and the rule that we would\nask this Court to adopt, that is, seizure and for a\ncustodial interrogation is presumptively unreasonable\nwithout parental consent or a court order leaves open\nthe possibility that there are, in fact, some children\nwho are of suitable age and discretion to knowingly make\na decision whether or not to talk to an armed police\nofficer and a caseworker without their parents having to\nmake it for them. But -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, are you -- I\njust want to make sure I understand your position.\nAnswering Justice Scalia's question: Child walks into\nthe room -- is taken out of their classroom, walks into\nthe room. The officer says: We've heard that your\nmommy and daddy are doing some things to your private\nparts; is that true? And the child says -- 9-year-old\nchild says: I wish somebody had asked me before. I'm\nso afraid of my daddy. He does these horrible things to\nme.\nAre you seriously suggesting that if the\npolice stay there for an hour debriefing that child as\nto the circumstances of that situation, that that's a\nseizure? It seems to me that what you -\nMS. KUBITSCHEK: A seizure, yes, but that\nwould have exigent circumstances, and that would get it\nout of the warrant requirement.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, but what does that\nhave to do or change the police bringing a child into a\nroom and just asking the question? When does -- that's\nwhat you seem to have said to Justice Scalia, which is\nthat the mere removal from the classroom is the -- the\ndefining feature of seizure. So it can't be that.\nMS. KUBITSCHEK: Well -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: They don't know if\nthere's exigent circumstances until they ask the\nquestion.\nMS. KUBITSCHEK: That -- that's correct.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You got a stipulation\nthat there was a seizure, so -\nMS. KUBITSCHEK: What? Yes, there was a\nseizure.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: There was never any\nargument that was not at issue in this case. Given that\nthere was seizure -\nMS. KUBITSCHEK: That's -- that's correct.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- the question is: Is\nit reasonable?\nMS. KUBITSCHEK: Correct.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Have you, in the -- many\nof the questions have gone to leads, but this is\ninitially a social worker's investigation. And you\nsaid, when stating what the Ninth Circuit's rule was,\nthat police are in combination with the caseworker.\nSuppose we took out -- out of the picture.\nHe didn't utter a word in the interview. Suppose we\ntake the sheriff, deputy sheriff, out. The only one who\ncomes to the school and asks to talk to this child is\nthe caseworker from the department of health?\nMS. KUBITSCHEK: Well, it would depend on, I\nthink, the larger picture, whether or not there was\npolice entanglement, as this Court ruled in Ferguson v.\nThe City of Charleston. In this particular case, the -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: If the information\nelicited from the child is that she has been abused by\nher father, then there is a likelihood that there will\nbe police interest in that.\nMS. KUBITSCHEK: Well, and this -- this\nCourt recognized also that possibility in Ferguson v.\nThe City of Charleston, that the -- the nurses at the\nhospital would call child protective services, but\nthe -- the -- you have to look at it from the beginning,\nand in this case, the case began when -- on\nFebruary 10th, when the police got involved.\nThe police did not report the matter to the\nchild protective investigator until 10 days later, and\nthen they went out together. Subsequently, the child\nprotective investigator testified before a grand jury as\npart of the ongoing law enforcement investigation and,\nin fact, when he was questioned at his deposition,\npetitioner Alford said that his reason for being at the\nschool was for law enforcement purposes.\nJUSTICE ALITO: But what is your answer to\nJustice Ginsburg's question, suppose it was just\nMr. Camreta or suppose it was the school nurse, would\nthe answer be the same?\nMS. KUBITSCHEK: No, it would not be the\nsame if it was the school nurse or Mr. Camreta. And\nthe -- the reason is that the school nurse is part of\nthe school administration, and the school has an\nobligation and the authority under T.L.O. act and in\nEarls to make rules and carry out procedures that will\nprotect the children of the school and promote learning,\nand if the child comes -\nJUSTICE ALITO: So if it was just\nMr. Camreta and he -\nMS. KUBITSCHEK: If Mr. -\nJUSTICE ALITO: -- and he taped the\nconversation and then later turned it over to the -- to\nthe police if he discovered evidence of child abuse,\nthere would be no problem? Right?\nMS. KUBITSCHEK: If Mr. Camreta came in from\nthe outside, he would not fall within the T.L.O. rule,\nbecause in T.L.O. this Court said specifically that\ntheir ruling does not apply to individuals such as\npolice officers who come from the outside in -- in order\nto deal with situations that are not related to the\nschool, and nobody is saying that S.G. was abused while\nshe was at the school.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Same circumstance. Was\nthere a seizure? No -- no professor -- no policeman?\nMS. KUBITSCHEK: If -- if -\nJUSTICE BREYER: School nurse?\nMS. KUBITSCHEK: The school nurse?\nJUSTICE BREYER: Seizure?\nMS. KUBITSCHEK: Probably not a seizure.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And so, it's not a seizure\nif exactly the same thing happens but there is no\noutside person there, but it is a seizure if there's an\noutside person?\nMS. KUBITSCHEK: If the outside person comes\ninto the school -\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's the rule as to\nwhether there's a seizure?\nMS. KUBITSCHEK: That's one of the factors\nto look at.\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, no, no, whether there's\na seizure?\nMS. KUBITSCHEK: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay. What makes it a\nseizure? Go inside and speak to the principal, I saw\nyou push the child at recess. We want to find out who\nwas pushing you. Go inside and talk to the principal.\nSeizure?\nMS. KUBITSCHEK: Your Honor, I believe that\nit -- it would be considered a seizure, although that's\nnot our case.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Everybody is going to stay\n5 minutes after class, too much talking today. Seizure?\nMS. KUBITSCHEK: That -- that, Your Honor,\nit might be a seizure. Again, it's T.L.O. -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, that's what I need to\nknow, because I don't know see if there is no seizure,\nhow it could have been an unreasonable thing, if there\nisn't even a seizure.\nMS. KUBITSCHEK: If -- if the caseworker\ncomes to the school under circumstances where a child\nwould feel free to leave or -\nJUSTICE BREYER: You're not free to leave\nclass.\nMS. KUBITSCHEK: Well, Your Honor, that's -\nchildren -- this is correct, children have lesser\nexpectations of privacy, but when they are forcibly\ntaken out of class and moved to another location -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Go to the principal's\noffice. Too much talking.\nMS. KUBITSCHEK: That -- that would be --\nYour Honor, if that is a seizure, it would fall within\nT.L.O., precisely within T.L.O., whereas -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: If you send her to the\nschool nurse, it's not a seizure, but if the school\ndoesn't have a nurse and it brings in a nurse from the\noutside and say, you know, we think you have some\ncontagious disease, we would like you to speak to\nthis -- then it becomes a seizure?\nMS. KUBITSCHEK: Well, Your Honor, the\nT.L.O. framework would certainly apply in that\nsituation, where you have a child who has a potentially\ncontagious disease, then the analysis you follow -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Contagious, it's just a\ndisease that's going to kill this child and nobody else,\nokay?\n(Laughter.)\nMS. KUBITSCHEK: Your Honor, that certainly\nalso would fall within the T.L.O. -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Okay.\nMS. KUBITSCHEK: -- special needs exception.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So why doesn't it -\nlikewise, it's not a nurse, but it's a social worker\nwho's brought in to interrogate the child about\nsomething else that is going to very much harm that\nchild, why is that any different?\nMS. KUBITSCHEK: Well, Your Honor, because\nchild welfare investigations are also harmful to\nchildren. And when -- when a child is asked,\ninterrogated about whether or not her father touches her\ninappropriately, that's not a neutral action. Whether\nor not she has been abused that causes trauma to the\nchild -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It has nothing to do with\nwhether there's a seizure, nothing whatever to do with\nwhether there's a seizure.\nMS. KUBITSCHEK: If -- if there -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The questions you ask after\nthe seizure don't make it a seizure or make it not a\nseizure, do they?\nMS. KUBITSCHEK: They -- they affect the\nconstitutionality of the interaction between the child\nand the -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Doesn't that go to the\nquestion of the reasonableness of the scope of the\nseizure? Don't we have Lidster and -- and other\njurisprudence that basically addresses this question and\nsays is this type of seizure or stop detention\nreasonable?\nAnd it's hard to swallow that if a police\nofficer asks a child are you being abused and the child\nsays, yes, I need help, it is nearly impossible to think\nthat that seizure is unreasonable. You're -- you're -\nyou're -- it may well be that 2 hours for a protesting\nchild would be, but isn't that all subject to a question\nof reasonableness as to the scope of the seizure?\nMS. KUBITSCHEK: Well, Your Honor,\nbecause -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: She's helping you, I think.\nMS. KUBITSCHEK: I'm sorry?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: She's helping you, I think.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But -- but that goes to the\nreasonableness of the seizure. I was asking you about\nwhether there has been a seizure. Step one, has there\nbeen a seizure? And you're saying that in a lot of\nthese situations there simply hasn't been a seizure.\nNow, once there is a seizure, then we can\ninquire to whether it's unreasonable or not. But -- but\nthose are two distinct questions, and -- and we've been\ndiscussing the mere existence of a seizure. Now, true\nin this case it was already conceded, but you're asking\nus to adopt a rule for future cases, and we can't adopt\na rule for future cases until we know what we're talking\nabout when -- when -- when we talk about a seizure.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: He was not trying to\nhelp you.\n(Laughter.)\nMS. KUBITSCHEK: I'm aware of that. But,\nyou know, that again is perhaps a good reason why this\nCourt should not reach the merits of the Fourth\nAmendment question, because in this particular case it\nwas conceded that there was a seizure so early in the -\nin the case that the normal development of facts which,\nas Justice Scalia, you have pointed out, whether or not\nthere is a seizure is certainly dependent on the\nindividual facts of the encounter between the individual\nchild and the individual police officer.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you're -\nMS. KUBITSCHEK: Those facts were not\ndeveloped.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So that's your\nargument, again, that we shouldn't reach the merits?\nMS. KUBITSCHEK: That's correct.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Now, do you agree\nthat if we vacate the court of appeals' decision on the\nmerits, that if Camreta had did exactly what he did in\nthis case again, that he would not face personal\nliability?\nMS. KUBITSCHEK: If you -- if you vacate the\ndecision on the merits -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right. Then that\ncannot be used -- that cannot be used to establish that\nthere's clearly established law. And in the absence of\nclearly established law, he cannot be found personally\nliable?\nMS. KUBITSCHEK: That -- that would be\ncorrect.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So if he did exactly\nthe same thing, he would still be entitled to qualified\nimmunity?\nMS. KUBITSCHEK: He would still be entitled\nto qualified immunity, but if this Court were to vacate,\nthis Court would be effectively be telling lower courts\nthat they should not follow the Pearson sequence ever\nbecause if they -- if the lower court reaches a\nconstitutional issue and then rules that the defendant\nhas qualified immunity, which Pearson said that they\ncould do, that this Court would then say no, don't -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Not always. Not always.\nOnly when there is no longer a case in controversy.\nIn -- in many cases there will still be a case or\ncontroversy.\nMS. KUBITSCHEK: Well -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It will be something that\ncould be replicated again in the future for some other\nreason. It -- it isn't true that it will just eliminate\nthe whole purpose of our -- of our jurisprudence in this\narea. In many cases the -- the decision below can be\nappealed, and -- and we will rule on the -- on the\nconstitutional question.\nMS. KUBITSCHEK: Which is -- that's -\nthat's correct -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But you moved away, I mean\nif -- you know, it's a different situation.\nMS. KUBITSCHEK: It -- it's a different\nsituation, but if they're in the situations where\nindividual defendants have qualified immunity, it has\nbeen the procedure in this Court not only since Pearson\nbut really going all the way back to Siegert v. Gilley,\n1991, where the Court recommended that the lower courts\nreach the constitutional issue -- in Siegert this Court\nsaid that they can. In County of Sacramento v. Lewis,\nthe Court said that they -- it's the better approach.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, could you have\ncross-petitioned in an effort to get damages, so if you\nhad wanted to preserve the issue, you surely could have\ndone that, couldn't you?\nMS. KUBITSCHEK: S.G. could have\ncross-petitioned, but she decided not to.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: But then we wouldn't have a\ncase.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But there's nothing in the\nrecord that indicates that you're withdrawing your\nMonell action against the municipality, is there?\nMS. KUBITSCHEK: The Monell action against\nthe municipality was dismissed on the facts.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But isn't it -- isn't a\nmotion to reinstate it still pending in the district\ncourt?\nMS. KUBITSCHEK: The motion to reinstate it\nwas denied without prejudice to reinstate after this\nCourt rules, and -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: All right, so it's still\nalive. And -\nMS. KUBITSCHEK: It's still alive.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- there's nothing in the\nrecord to indicate that you won't ask that it be\nreinstated.\nMS. KUBITSCHEK: That's correct.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Is that against a different\nparty, Ms. Kubitschek?\nMS. KUBITSCHEK: That is against Deschutes\nCounty, Justice Kagan.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But who is -- who is\non the other side of the county?\nMS. KUBITSCHEK: I'm sorry; who's on the\nother side of the -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The claim pending\nbelow involves which two parties?\nMS. KUBITSCHEK: Oh, it -- it involves S.G.\nand the county.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Oh. So -\nMS. KUBITSCHEK: -- claim that it's alive?\nThe claim that is alive involves different incidents,\nincidents that took place in March of 2003, not -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Does the decision on\nthe merits here have any relevance whatever to the\naction that's still pending?\nMS. KUBITSCHEK: No.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you agree that if\n-- if this is -- we vacate the decision on the merits,\nthat's of no meaning whatever in the pending action\nbelow?\nMS. KUBITSCHEK: It would not have an effect\non the action.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Suppose that we dismiss the\ncase as improvidently granted, while indicating in an\nopinion some of the questions that we find difficult\nsuch, for example, as the seizure question, et cetera;\nwhat kind of impact would that have in your opinion?\nMS. KUBITSCHEK: If the Court were to\ndismiss the case as -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes, if -- while indicating\nthe reasons being in part that there are difficult\nquestions here, suggesting what they are. What would\nthe -- impact would that have?\nMS. KUBITSCHEK: Well, Your Honor, it would\nhave some impact at least on the Petitioner's position.\nThe Petitioner's opinion as stated in their brief that\nall seizures of children to investigate child abuse are\nconstitutional at their inception, meaning there -\nthere are no limits, there are no constraints on what a\nchild abuse -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: It wouldn't affect your\nclient in any way, because she's out of it and you were\ncandid from the beginning to say as far as she's\nconcerned this is a moot case; but as far as Camreta and\nthe other officers are concerned, we were told by\nOregon's representative that they are not -- that they\nhave tailored their behavior to conform to this\ndecision.\nMS. KUBITSCHEK: And, Your Honor, that -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So -\nMS. KUBITSCHEK: -- that would be to -- to\ntell the officials who investigate child abuse that in\nthe name of protecting children, they do not have free\nrein to do anything and everything that they think is\nappropriate, because what they do harms children,\nincluding the very children they claim to be trying to\nprotect.\nAs Justice Breyer said, even raising those\nquestions would -- would be beneficial to children who\nare forced to undergo child abuse investigations, 75\npercent of whom have not been abused at all, and who\nfind the experience psychologically traumatic.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If you're making an\nargument on something that you've already told us you\nhave no cognizable interest in -- correct?\nMS. KUBITSCHEK: Correct.\nJUSTICE ALITO: If you were designing what\nyou would regard as an ideal system, and you're very\nknowledgeable in this -- in this area, and you concluded\nthat some kind of approval by a detached individual\nshould be required before something like this is\nallowed, would you set the standard at probable cause?\nWould you say that the child protective service has to\nhave probable cause that there's abuse before they can\nquestion the child to find whether or not there was\nabuse, or would you set it at some lower level?\nMS. KUBITSCHEK: Well, in fact, Your Honor,\nthe -- most of the States have a procedure for seeking\ncourt approval, and their -- they differ in whether they\nrequire probable cause or reasonable suspicion or\nsomething like reasonable cause; and so while we put in\nour brief that the seizure of S.G. should have been\nbased upon probable cause, given the law enforcement\ncomponent, if there was -- if Alford, the deputy\nsheriff, were not there at all, and it was purely a\nchild welfare seizure and the child welfare caseworker\nwere going to a juvenile court judge and seeking some\nkind of judicial approval, the -- because the laws of\nthe States differ between reasonable suspicion and\nprobable cause, I would suggest that the better course\nwould be to let this play itself out between those two\nlegal standards.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMS. KUBITSCHEK: Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: General Kroger, you\nhave 4 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN R. KROGER\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. KROGER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: General, just a point of\nclarification before you go on. You said earlier that\nyour office had advised the county not to seize\nchildren. Does that mean they're not talking to\nchildren at all? Is -- you used the word seized. Are\nyou advising them that they don't have the right to talk\nto children? Without their parental consent or a\nwarrant?\nMR. KROGER: No, Your Honor, but they would\nhave to talk to children in a way which runs no risk of\nbeing found of seizing the children within the meaning\nof the Ninth Circuit decision.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, so then walking along\nthe hall in the school, right?\nMR. KROGER: I -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Just come up alongside:\n\"By the way, I wanted to ask you whether your mother --\"\n(Laughter.)\nMR. KROGER: Yes, Your Honor, and you can\nsee the problem which the Ninth Circuit decision causes\npractically on the child welfare system in the State of\nOregon. The -- Mr. Camreta and other child protective\nservices workers under the Ninth Circuit decision face\nan enormous burden. In most of these cases it is\nimpossible to establish probable cause to get a warrant\nwithout first speaking to the child because the child is\nusually the only witness that is available to the\ngovernment; and so to require, as the Ninth Circuit has\nhere, that we obtain a warrant prior to even speaking to\na child victim places -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What's the standard? I\nmean, I just assume you're not suggesting that this\nprocedure could be used with every child in every school\nwithout some ground for suspicion, correct?\nMR. KROGER: No, Your Honor, we believe that\nreasonable suspicion is the -- is the proper basis\nbefore making a seizure of a child to conduct one of\nthese inquiries.\nSignificant here in Griffin and subsequent\ncases like Lidster, the Court has recognized that the\nrelationship between the State and the person being\nsearched or seized is significant to the reasonableness\nanalysis, and here it is not an adversarial\nrelationship. The child and the State share a\nsignificant interest in making sure that that child is\nsafe; and were the government to continue to be put in a\nposition of not being able to speak to a child until\nprobable cause has developed in some other way, children\nwill continue to be placed at risk.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: But, General, I take it that\nthat problem disappears -- tell me if I'm wrong -- if we\nfind there's no jurisdiction. If we Munsingwear this\ncase, the decision is wiped off the case, you return to\nstatus quo ante, and you tell all your people that they\ncan do what they would have done beforehand; is that\nright?\nMR. KROGER: That is correct, Your Honor.\nThat would be a -- a significant step forward for Mr.\nCamreta and others similarly placed. The -- the\nchallenge is that those kind of claims then would be\nperpetually subject to -- to qualified immunity because\nthe law would not be clarified. And that -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Would you -- are you -\nand I guess what I'm asking is, let's assume we go ex\nante. At any moment that an agency speaks to a child,\nthey can move from a nonseizure to a seizure, correct?\nAnd some seizures can be reasonable and some can't,\nright?\nMR. KROGER: That's correct, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And law enforcement is\nnever going to know where that line of reasonableness or\nunreasonableness is, is that correct?\nMR. KROGER: That's correct.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's in -- that's in\nthe nature of doing this without a warrant, isn't it?\nMR. KROGER: Yes, Your Honor. That's part\nof the reason we agreed that a seizure was committed\nhere, so that law enforcement are not placed in a\ndifficult position every time they speak to a child, of\ntrying to make their own determination as to whether -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But they do it anyway,\nmeaning even if we say that they can seize the child,\nyou would still have to not do a seizure that was\nunreasonable. You wouldn't -- in scope. They can't\nspeak to the child endlessly, can they?\nMR. KROGER: No, Your Honor, that's correct.\nThe government officials will have to conduct that -\nthat seizure in a reasonable manner for a reasonable\nduration. That's different, I think, though, Your\nHonor, than the threshold question of if they start to\ntalk to a child, of trying to judge in the middle of an\ninterview, have we gone too far, has a seizure occurred.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm not quite sure why\nyou stipulated to a seizure in this case, but that was\nyour strategic choice.\nMR. KROGER: Mr. Chief Justice, the question\nis whether vacating the decision will have an impact on\nthe litigation below, and it will. The Respondent is\nseeking to preserve the Ninth Circuit decision precisely\nto aid the Fourth Amendment claim that the Respondent is\nmaking against Deschutes County, and thus, this is\nsomewhat analogous to the situation in the Pacific Bell\ncase, where you have a Petitioner and Respondent seeking\ndifferent remedies from this Court in light of the\nimpact that it will have on subsequent litigation.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Ms. Kubitschek said it was\nbased on different events. Is that right or not?\nMR. KROGER: The due process -\nJUSTICE ALITO: The Fourth Amendment claim\nagainst the county is based on -- on this interview?\nMR. KROGER: Your Honor, I have not seen the\nnew complaint, but my understanding is that it is the\nsame event and same claim.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel.\n"
