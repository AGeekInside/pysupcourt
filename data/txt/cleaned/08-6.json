ROSENSTEIN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. ROSENSTEIN: Thank you, Mr. Chief\nJustice, and may it please the Court:\nThe State of Alaska fully recognizes the\nimportance of DNA evidence. The State provides criminal\ndefendants with pretrial access to that evidence and it\nhas postconviction procedures that give prisoners a fair\nopportunity to retest that evidence should new\ntechnology become available.\nSo this case really isn't about the\nimportance or power of DNA evidence. Rather it's about\nthree things: First, it's about the proper procedural\ndevice for asserting in Federal court a right to\npostconviction testing. Section 1983 is not the correct\ndevice because Mr. Osborne's claim clearly sounds in\nFederal habeas corpus. The evidence he seeks has a\nsingular relevance to support a direct attack on the\nvalidity of his confinement.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, he's -- he's not at\nthis point. All he's doing is seeking evidence. We\ndon't know -- he doesn't know presumably -- exactly what\nthat evidence is going to show. The evidence may prove\nto be exonerating and it may not be.\nUntil one knows the tendency of the\nevidence, one can't say that we have a Preiser problem.\nSo if -- if we don't have that kind of a problem, then I\ndon't see -- I guess I don't follow your argument that\nthis necessarily sounds in habeas.\nMR. ROSENSTEIN: Well, Your Honor, the --\nMr. Osborne's case is comparable to Balisok v. Edwards,\nwhere the Petitioner was seeking damages for -- as a\nresult of a biased hearing in prison.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Right. And if he was\nseeking damages in this 1983 action for false\nimprisonment or imprisonment under an invalid\nconviction, I would understand your argument. But what\nhe is saying in effect is: I want process to know what\nthis evidence has to say. And that is not seeking\ndamages, and it's not seeking release.\nMR. ROSENSTEIN: That's correct, Your Honor.\nIt's not seeking damages, but the proof -- the\ndifference between this case -- the only difference\nbetween this case and Balisok is that in this case the\nproof is going to be happening in a laboratory; whereas,\nin Balisok the --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No. The difference -- the\ndifference is that if he succeeds in this case in\ngetting access to the evidence, that doesn't get him\noutside or even in position to go outside the prison\ndoor. All it does is get him some evidence to test.\nAnd what he does with that later, if he finds it\nfavorable, presumably is necessarily going to be in\nhabeas.\nMR. ROSENSTEIN: But this -- his request is\nsimply a discovery request. He's split his -- his claim\naway from his underlying claim of actual innocence, his\n--\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, he's got to because\nhe doesn't know whether he has any evidence of actual\ninnocence at this point.\nMR. ROSENSTEIN: But he -- to assert a claim\nof actual innocence, he doesn't need to have the result\nof a DNA test, and --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: He's not asserting it. He\njust says: I want to get to this evidence and see what\nit has to say.\nMR. ROSENSTEIN: But the -- this evidence\nhas a singular relevance, and his -- his true intent is\nto -- is to assert --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No.\nMR. ROSENSTEIN: -- a claim of innocence.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: He has a singular objective\nin getting the evidence, but we don't know what the\nevidence means. The evidence may conclusively prove\nthat he is guilty, for all we know.\nMR. ROSENSTEIN: That's true, Your Honor,\nbut what this represents, what his request represents,\nis a discovery request.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, it's a -- that's --\nthat's a fair way of putting it, but what he -- I think\nultimately his strongest argument or his -- his basic\nargument is this evidence is potentially so important\nthat the State has no valid interest in keeping me at\nleast from seeing it; i.e., testing it. And you can\ncall that discovery if you want to, but it's something\nvery different from the normal discovery that goes on as\nan ancillary process to a criminal prosecution.\nMR. ROSENSTEIN: Well, the State does have\nan interest in -- in insisting that Mr. Osborne follow\nthe established procedures.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Oh, that may be. I'm not\ngetting into that here.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Would the other side\nconcede the premise that he doesn't say that this is\ngoing to exonerate him? That he has -- you know --\nhere's some -- some evidence out there. It may help me;\nit may hurt me. I don't know which, but I'd like to see\nit. Is that the only claim he's making? If so, it's --\nit's a lot less -- what should I say -- a lot less\nplausible a constitutional claim. There's some evidence\nthat I'd like to look at; I'm not saying it will prove\nme innocent. I'd just like to look at this evidence.\nMight, might not. That's a lot weaker claim than what I\nhad thought he was making, which is the claim that this\n-- this new scientific evidence will -- will prove my\ninnocence.\nMR. ROSENSTEIN: That's correct, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, which is he doing\nhere? Is he saying the latter or not?\nMR. ROSENSTEIN: Well, he hasn't -- he has\nnever really asserted that he is actually innocent. He\nholds out the possibility, and he's filed an affidavit\nwhich is at joint appendix --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So it's not a\nconstitutional claim of entitlement to evidence which he\nasserts will prove his innocence, but rather a\nconstitutional claim to evidence which might or then\nmight not prove his innocence? Is that --\nMR. ROSENSTEIN: He has hedged, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Performance we should let\nthe -- let Osborne, Osborne's attorney, address that\nquestion, because you're not really equipped to answer\nfor the other side.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, we're assuming the\npremise, though, in the questioning.\nMR. ROSENSTEIN: Well, as this case started,\nYour Honor, Mr. Osborne was asserting that it would\nestablish his innocence. But yet he has never -- he has\nnever made a declaration under penalty of penalty of\nperjury that he is innocent. So, Your Honor, you're\ncorrect. He seems to be, for lack of a better word,\nfishing for evidence that -- that might help him.\nAnd --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: There was evidence in --\nat his trial at the state of the art at that time.\nThere was whatever the test was.\nMR. ROSENSTEIN: Justice Ginsburg, at trial\nthe State performed what is known as DQ alpha testing.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That was not the state of\nthe art at the time, was it?\nMR. ROSENSTEIN: That's my understanding,\nthat the RFLP testing was a much more discriminating\ntype of -- would yield a much more discriminating result\nthan the DQ Alpha. -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: He didn't ask for that.\nMR. ROSENSTEIN: That's correct, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But when did the current\ntechnology become available? When did the testing that\nhe now requests --\nMR. ROSENSTEIN: I'm not certain about that,\nYour Honor. My -- I would guess that it was around the\nlate nineties. It was available before he filed his --\nthis Federal action.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Does the State\nroutinely keep evidence of the sort Osborne is seeking\navailable? Or is there a cutoff point at which they\ndispose of the evidence.\nMR. ROSENSTEIN: I can't answer whether the\nState has a policy. It seems to be a decision that is\nmade jointly with the police, the crime lab, and the\nprosecutors, and it depends, I would think, on the\nstatus of the case as it proceeds after conviction\nthrough direct appeal.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What now? As far as I\nunderstand, there's a procedural problem. I tried to\nfigure out the Heck line once in Balisok. My impression\nof it is that if, Mr. Prisoner, you're bringing an\naction challenging some confinement or the effect of\nyour action is going to be to let you go out of solitary\nor out of prison, then proceed your habeas. But if what\nyou're trying to get is relief that may or may not mean\nyou get out of solitary or you get out of prison, then\nyou go to 1983. But, by the way, if you're in 1983 you\nare complaining about an action or inaction by a State\nofficial that violates a constitutional right.\nNow, as I look at this case the prisoner, if\nhe wins, is not going to get out, and he is complaining\nabout the State violating a constitutional right by\nrefusing to give him DNA. It seems to me that second\nquestion is the question that's the heart of the case:\nDoes the State have a constitutional obligation to give\nhim the DNA?\nSo I would appreciate your telling me why it\ndoesn't.\nMR. ROSENSTEIN: Justice Breyer, the State\ndoesn't have an obligation to provide this evidence to\nhim because there is no -- a -- prisoners have no\nFederal right to postconviction relief, and the State of\nAlaska has provided procedures by which -- which Mr.\nOsborne if he chose to use them could make available the\nevidence that he seeks. But he hasn't chosen to invoke\nthose procedures.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Would you explain that --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Is there any reason to\nthink that if, in fact -- sorry.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Justice Breyer.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Just to clarify his\nstatement, he said that the State of Alaska provides a\nmeans for him to get at this information; but if it did,\nI think we wouldn't be here. So would you -- Alaska is\none of the few States that has no statute.\nMR. ROSENSTEIN: That's correct.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So what -- you say --\nthis whole controversy is whether the State is obliged\nto give him this information; but you're saying it's\nsimply that he picked the wrong procedure. That's what\nI thought I heard you say just now; that there is a\nmeans under Alaska law where he could get this DNA\npostconviction. So would you please explain what the\nAlaska procedure is?\nMR. ROSENSTEIN: Yes, Justice Ginsburg.\nAlaska has a postconviction relief statute\nand that is at page -- starts at page 10a of the blue\nbrief. And under that statute, a prisoner can assert a\nclaim for -- for postconviction relief when there exist\nmaterial facts -- I'm quoting from Alaska Statute\n12.72.010. Postconviction relief is available when a\nperson claims that there exists evidence of material\nfacts not previously presented and heard by the court\nthat requires vacation of the conviction or sentence in\nthe interest of justice.\nNow, if Mr. Osborne were to state a\ncognizable claim under that statute the Alaska rules of\ncourt then apply the full civil rules pertaining to\ndiscovery as of right to the applicant.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Has there been any case\nin Alaska where a defendant postconviction was, in fact,\nable to get DNA testing under the procedure you just\ndescribed?\nMR. ROSENSTEIN: Well, Your Honor,\nthere's -- there was one case and it's cited in the\nyellow brief, Patterson v. State, that a prisoner did\napply in court and was granted access to the DNA\nevidence, but then it came to pass that the evidence had\nbeen destroyed by that time.\nSo in that case the relief was granted, but\nthrough the destruction of the evidence no testing was\npossible.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Can you give me some idea\nof how many cases there are in, say, the last 10 years\nin which in State postconviction proceedings the\nconvicted prisoner has asked for DNA evidence?\nMR. ROSENSTEIN: I believe --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Three? 300?\nMR. ROSENSTEIN: Less -- we did an informal\nsearch and found seven cases where there were actual\nrequests; and I believe that five of them involved court\ncases, the one that I have just mentioned where the\nrelief was granted, and I believe the remaining are\npending decision.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Of course, that relief\nwould require him to assert his innocence, wouldn't it?\nHe would have to bring a habeas corpus action claiming\nthat the State has no business holding him because in\nfact he's innocent?\nHe doesn't want to do that? He just wants\nto say, I'd just like to see this evidence. It might\nhelp me. It might not help me, but --\nMR. ROSENSTEIN: That's -- prisoners have\nnever been able to postconviction simply seek\nover-the-counter the evidence that was used in\ntheir earlier -- in their --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I don't know that they're\narguing with you on that score. What they are saying --\nI think what they're saying, and this goes to a variety\nof Justice Scalia's question, is that under the Alaska\nstatute in order to get to the evidence, or indeed in\norder to make his -- his postconviction claim, he's got\nto claim that the evidence of material fact requires\nvacation of the conviction or sentence.\nHis argument is, I don't know whether it\nrequires it; because I haven't been able to test it.\nWhat I want is to test it.\nAnd as I understand it, under this\nparticular statute, he has no chance of doing so because\nhe can't tell you in advance what the test is going to\nshow. Isn't that correct?\nMR. ROSENSTEIN: Justice Souter --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, first tell me whether\nthat's correct or not. He doesn't know what the test is\ngoing to -- he doesn't know what the test is going to\nshow; so --\nMR. ROSENSTEIN: That is correct.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- he cannot say that it\nrequires vacation of the conviction; isn't that correct?\nMR. ROSENSTEIN: That is correct.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.\nMR. ROSENSTEIN: But, but -- but only Mr.\nOsborne knows whether he is innocent. And if he is\ninnocent --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But Mr. Osborne doesn't\nknow what that evidence is going to show. He hasn't\ntested it.\nMR. ROSENSTEIN: That's correct.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Whether -- whether he\nbelieves he's innocent or whether he doesn't believe\nhe's innocent, he can walk into court, as I understand\nit, and say, I am absolutely innocent. But what he\ncannot do prior to testing the evidence is tell you, is\nallege, that the evidence is going to require the\nvacation of the conviction.\nMR. ROSENSTEIN: But if he is innocent, then\nhe does know the -- the result of the testing.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I thought you said the\nState has -- has indeed granted a habeas request. In\nthat case, where it granted the habeas request, although\nit turned out that the evidence was destroyed, in that\ncase surely the same situation -- the same situation\nexisted.\nMR. ROSENSTEIN: Well, actually, Your Honor,\nit did not, because in that case he never asserted his\ninnocence. That was a request he made on\nreconsideration after the denial of his ineffective\nassistance claim. And he said that under the due --\nunder due process, I am entitled to have this evidence\nso that I can present an actual innocence claim. So the\n-- the case that you are referring to is --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It is the case you are\nreferring to. I didn't -- I didn't make it up. You\ndid.\nMR. ROSENSTEIN: Well, in -- in Mr.\nOsborne's first postconviction relief case that was\ndecided in -- are you talking about the --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No. I'm talking about the\ncase you alluded to earlier where you say the State of\nAlaska had indeed provided DNA evidence or had agreed to\nprovide it --\nMR. ROSENSTEIN: Oh, okay. Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- but for the fact that it\nno longer existed. Now, in that case surely the same\nproblem existed that Justice Souter is -- is raising.\nThat -- that person also, while claiming innocence,\ncouldn't say for sure what the evidence would produce,\nbut that didn't stop the State from providing it; did\nit?\nMR. ROSENSTEIN: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I know your time is up, but\nI really have only one question this morning and I would\nlike to have a chance to ask it, and I am trying to\nclear away some undergrowth. And the undergrowth first\nI have cleared away in my mind is this Heck question.\nThe second is the Alaska court decision. And my\nimpression is that Alaska refused the test because,\namong other things, they couldn't say -- they said the\nconviction rested primarily on eyewitness testimony, and\nthey have a bunch of reasons. But the Ninth Circuit, as\na matter of fact, tried to blow apart those reasons.\nOkay?\nSuppose I agree with the Ninth Circuit.\nThen my question is this: Does the Constitution of the\nUnited States require you to give this evidence to the\ndefendant? And one of the relevant points in my mind is\nI see it would be of significant advantage to the\ndefendant. Even if he's guilty, he can be proved to --\nwhatever. It is an advantage to him. Okay?\nNow, why don't you want to give it to him?\nMR. ROSENSTEIN: Because, Your Honor, the\nState of Alaska has a procedure that was not invoked in\nthe --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I -- I -- there I -- that's\nthe undergrowth I tried to clear away. I am saying I\nread all that procedure. Suppose I believe that the\nNinth Circuit is right about that procedure, namely that\nthe tests that they're using in that procedure are not\nfavorable enough to a defendant who is seeking, as this\ndefendant is seeking, the DNA.\nHe just wants some DNA. He'll pay for it.\nThe odds are eight to one he's going to lose. But he\nthinks: I'm willing to run those odds. I won't put you\nat any trouble. Now, why don't you want to give it to\nhim?\nBecause, Your Honor, the State of Alaska has\na procedure that would enable him to obtain that\nevidence.\nJUSTICE BREYER: No. The procedure has the\ntests in it that the Alaska court -- didn't the Alaska\nSupreme Court say, we will not give you DNA evidence\nunless you can demonstrate: One, that the conviction\nrested primarily on eyewitness ID evidence; two, that\nthere was a demonstrable doubt concerning his ID as the\nperpetrator; and, three, that scientific testing would\nlikely would be conclusive. Wasn't that their test?\nMR. ROSENSTEIN: With respect, Your Honor,\nthat was the test they applied in that case, but that is\nnot the test that would apply if Mr. Osborne were to\nfile a new postconviction relief application asserting\nthat he is actually innocent. If he were to do that,\nthen the full civil rules of discovery would available\nto him.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And then -- are different\n-- then they'd give it to him?\nMR. ROSENSTEIN: Pardon me.\nJUSTICE BREYER: In other words, all he has\nto do is file a new piece of paper tomorrow, and he gets\nthe DNA?\nMR. ROSENSTEIN: Right. But Alaska --\nAlaska has procedures for this.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But you said something\nsignificant. You said that he would have to allege his\nactual innocence, which he hasn't done. So if he\ncontinues not to -- not to put in a sworn statement\nthat, I am actually innocent, under your current\nprocedure he still couldn't get the DNA.\nMR. ROSENSTEIN: If he doesn't allege his\nactual innocence, Your Honor, then this is really an\nempty exercise, a fishing expedition. He wants to just\nsee what -- what the evidence says. And that -- that is\nnot the way litigation works.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You gave the one case in\nwhich in the habeas in Alaska the court granted access\nto DNA, but the evidence wasn't there.\nOn how many occasions when postconviction\nsomeone moved for the DNA evidence did the Alaska courts\ndeny the request?\nMR. ROSENSTEIN: My -- my -- there were --\nas I said, there were seven cases. And my understanding\nis there have -- has not been a denial.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, you told us it was\ngranted in one case. What happened in the other six?\nMR. ROSENSTEIN: There -- well --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I thought you said they\nwere still pending.\nMR. ROSENSTEIN: There were -- there are\nfour or five that are pending. One of them is Mr.\nOsborne's case, and another is being reviewed by the --\nby the attorney general.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nWe'll afford you rebuttal time since the Court used up\nyour time.\nMR. ROSENSTEIN: Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Katyal.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF NEAL K. KATYAL\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,\nAS AMICUS CURIAE,\nSUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS\nMR. KATYAL: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe Ninth Circuit created a novel\nconstitutional right by extending Brady to the\npostconviction setting. Mr. Osborne doesn't attempt to\ndefend that rationale. Instead, he attempts to mint a\npreviously unrecognized liberty interest in access to\nclemency or State postconviction procedures. Assuming\nthe Court reaches the second question presented, it\nshould not constitutionalize rules for postconviction\naccess to DNA, an area of great legislative ferment in\nthe last few years. And even were it inclined to do so,\nthe unusual facts of this case, which include failure to\nattest to actual innocence under threat of perjury, two\nrecent confessions to the crime, and a tactical decision\nat trial to forego a highly discriminating RFLP DNA\ntest, all together make this a particularly poor\ncandidate for recognizing a new constitutional\nentitlement.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What were the two\nconfessions? I know the one before the parole\nauthorities. What was the other one?\nMR. KATYAL: There are two confessions to\nthe parole authorities. One is found at page --\npetition appendix 71a. There's a small reprint which is\nthe written portion of the -- of the confession.\nThere's also separately in the record -- this is at\nsupplemental excerpts of the record, pages 248 to 261,\nin the Ninth Circuit, which --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, but isn't it true\nthat we've had DNA cases where the person has been found\ninnocent despite the fact they confessed?\nMR. KATYAL: That is -- that is correct.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: How do we know this isn't\none of those cases?\nMR. KATYAL: Well, I am not quite sure that\nwe have had any situation like this, in which you have\nhad so many different facts altogether that -- that\nsuggested both that he -- that he's guilty and that --\nand you are talking about a confession that's taken\nplace years after. I think the cases that are referred\nto by the amici are situations in which someone has\nconfessed generally at trial or something like that.\nHere you have two confessions years later.\nThey are very detailed. The one in the -- in the\nsupplemental excerpts to the record is a very long\nstory. And he says that he told his attorney about it\nand talks all about how he had confessed to his mother,\nhow it was very difficult to exorcise. It is a very\nin-depth confession, and it is a confession that the --\nthat the Alaska courts have credited.\nIt is not just our word. At joint appendix\npage 221, the Alaska court found -- listened to that\n2004 confession in light of the 2006 affidavit that Mr.\nOsborne makes much of claiming that he is innocent and\nput those two documents side by side and said, taken\ntogether, they don't -- the 2006 affidavit does not\nreally take --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Am I right in\nunderstanding that the State has agreed that this\nevidence is exonerating; that this evidence potentially\ncould exonerate him?\nMR. KATYAL: The -- the State has so agreed.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And is it true that all he\nhas to do is file a piece of paper in the court that\nsays: Whatever I said before, I did it under pressure;\nI am innocent. And if he says those words, \"I am\ninnocent,\" then he will get this DNA?\nMR. KATYAL: Well, it is -- it is not clear\nto me under State law. I think as I understood my\nfriend -- but that's what I understood him to say. I\ncan tell you, Justice Breyer, for purposes of the\nFederal law, 18 USC 3600 has a requirement in it which\nsays that in order to get DNA testing you must attest\nunder threat of perjury that you are actually innocent.\nThat is a very serious requirement, done after years of\ncongressional debate. That is something that the Ninth\nCircuit rule would disregard, and it would permit\nsomeone to come in without that.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You think we could attach\nthat to the new constitutional right that we invent? It\nwould be a constitutional right to get it if -- if --\nbut if you lose, you get another three years? Could we\nsay that?\nMR. KATYAL: Our position, Justice Scalia,\nis that there is no constitutional right to DNA, but\nif -- were the Court inclined to find one and locate it\nsomewhere in Brady or the procedural due process clause,\nsomething we think which would be very difficult to do,\nbut were it -- if that were the Court's inclination,\nabsolutely, it should at least mirror the Federal\nstatute and the -- and the rock solid requirements of\n3600, which do require that perjury -- that perjury\nstatement to be made in order to --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Do you think there's a\nconstitutional right to establish innocence in some\ncases where there is new and -- evidence that could not\npreviously have been discovered, that has a high\nlikelihood of exonerating?\nMR. KATYAL: Well, this Court has struggled\nwith that and so far has said no. And the latest\nposition is Herrera v. Collins.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm asking for your\nposition.\nMR. KATYAL: Our position is that the logic\nof this Court's precedents is that there is no right at\npresent to actual innocence.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Katyal, the -- the\nright that they're asserting may be located not in\nprocedural, but in substantive due process. What I --\nwhat I would like you to comment on is what the\ngovernment's or any government's interest, the United\nStates or that of a State, may be in, in effect, in\ndenying that there should be such a right.\nAnd this question occurred to me when I was\ngoing through the briefs: What if -- we'll make this\nFederal for your sake -- what if the United States had\nimprisoned an individual who came forward and said:\nNobody realized it, but I was an eyewitness to the crime\nfor which X is -- is -- has been convicted and is\ncurrently being incarcerated; and, in fact, I saw that\ncrime committed and he did not commit it. X's lawyer\narrives at this individual's prison and says: I want to\ntalk to the guy.\nWould the United States have an interest in\nsaying, you cannot talk to him?\nMR. KATYAL: The United States wouldn't --\nwouldn't have an interest as a -- would generally permit\nas a matter of prosecutorial ethics access to -- if the\nUnited States knew that there was some exculpatory\nmaterial that it had within its purview, it would turn\nthat over. It just wouldn't be a constitutional --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, you know, prisoners\nsay all sorts of things. We don't know whether in the\nlong run it is going to be exculpatory or whether this\nguy has some axe to grind.\nBut the question is, would the United States\nhave any legitimate interest in saying to X's lawyer,\nyou can't even talk with him?\nMR. KATYAL: Well, I think that it would --\nit would have to -- if it adopted such a rule and\nallowed the talking in any situation --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Why wouldn't it?\nMR. KATYAL: Let me talk about DNA, for\nexample.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Why do you need a rule, I\nguess is what I'm saying.\nMR. KATYAL: Let me talk about DNA. The\nreason why with respect to DNA is it's a no-cost\nproposition for a defendant to say: Hey, I'm innocent,\nI want to get tested --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Oh, okay --\nMR. KATYAL: -- So that's why --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Are you starting with the\npremise that the United States would not have a\nlegitimate interest in my hypothetical in saying, you\ncan't even talk to him?\nMR. KATYAL: Well, it depends on the\ncircumstances of the hypothetical and whether or not\nthere's some -- whether or not it would open up the\nfloodgates, I guess, to other requests and so on.\nWith respect to DNA, there is --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, let's assume that if\nyou let this guy talk to -- X's lawyer talk to this guy,\nother individuals may say, boy, I can have my moment in\nthe sun, too; I'm going to claim this. You know, let's\nassume the worst case there.\nWould you still say, would the government\nstill say, we have an interest for that reason in not\neven letting him talk to him?\nMR. KATYAL: It's possible, because there --\nit may be that as a policy matter they will allow it.\nBut as a matter of constitutional law, Justice Souter,\nthis Court has repeatedly said --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I haven't gotten to the\nconstitutional law yet. I just -- I just want to know\nwhether there would be a legitimate interest in saying\nno. I mean, you can see --\nMR. KATYAL: Again, there may be because of\nfloodgates or other reasons. But for the --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: You mentioned the\nfloodgates. There are seven cases in this State in the\nwhole history of Alaska.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Is that right? That's\nfloodgates?\nMR. KATYAL: Seven thus far,\nJustice Stevens. If this Court were to recognize a\nconstitutional right to DNA for all 50 States, there\nwould really be, I think, quite a dramatically different\nresult.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Especially, I would assume,\none constitutional right in which you do not even have\nto assert your innocence.\nMR. KATYAL: Precisely. So we're talking\nabout seven in one State right now, but I think the\nnumbers could be great. That was what Congress said\nwhen they passed 3600, which said there has to be\nsomething to lose on the stake of defendants, so that\nthey can't come in, like Mr. Osborne, and have\nquestionable statements as to whether they're actually\ninnocent or not.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Why can't you do this?\nLook at the consensus of the statutes in the States and\nthe Federal Government and say there's a range of\nappreciation here, and there is a right but it catches\nonly the outliers? And so, the worst that would happen\nis that the outlying States would have to bring\nthemselves into conformity with the outer reaches of\nwhatever the set of statutes is now in all the other\nStates.\nMR. KATYAL: Because, Justice Breyer, that's\nnot the way this Court approaches due process questions.\nWere it, for example, non-unanimous jury verdicts, which\ntwo States have, would be impermissible.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I'm not saying every\ninstance in which there are outliers is\nunconstitutional. I'm just saying in this instance for\nother reasons it might be unconstitutional; namely, you\nhave a good way of proving guilty or innocence, and if\nthat's so, the practical problem is not great. You\nsolve the practical problem in the way I just mentioned.\nMR. KATYAL: But you enter the thicket of\npractical problems, it seems to me, Justice Breyer, when\nyou do that, because the 44 States that have these\nstatutes do it in a variety of different ways with\nrespect to perjury requirements, felonies versus\nmisdemeanors, who gets access, who pays for it, do they\nget lawyers. There's a host of policy questions that\narise --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So the constitutional right\nis bring yourself within any one of them, unless that\nany one of them is a real outlier, which you can make as\nan argument that you will never win?\nMR. KATYAL: Were that the case, then Alaska\nitself would be within that framework, because it\nalready has a process in place.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Neufeld.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF PETER NEUFELD\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. NEUFELD: Thank you very much.\nMr. Chief Justice, and may it please the\nCourt:\nIt is absolutely undisputed in this case\nthat there is a DNA test that Mr. Osborne seeks that\ncould conclusively prove his actual innocence.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, there was a\nmore reliable one at the time of trial as well, and his\ncounsel made the tactical decision not to use it\nbecause, I assume, she was concerned it would show his\nguilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Which apparently he had\ntold her about.\nMR. NEUFELD: The test actually, the RFLP\ntest I assume you are referring to, is not actually more\nreliable. It's more discriminating. And the reason it\ndidn't get used -- even the prosecutor didn't want to\nuse it as well, Mr. Chief Justice, because they felt\nthat the evidence was so degraded that if they tried\nusing that test there was a grave risk that it would\ndestroy all the evidence and not get any result. And\nthat's why they chose that DQ alpha test, which is more\nsensitive, albeit not as discriminating.\nJUSTICE ALITO: But what was the reason that\nRespondent's counsel provided for not requesting that\ntest?\nMR. NEUFELD: Respondent's counsel said that\nshe was doing it for strategic reasons, although I think\nit is quite important that Mr. Osborne at all points\nsaid he wanted the testing, okay, and that his counsel\nrejected his advice. He even wrote to a Nobel Prize\nwinner to see what he could do about getting this\nadditional testing.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, let's assume for the\nsake of argument that there is some constitutional right\nto obtain DNA evidence for testing postconviction.\nWould you still -- would you say that that right\nincludes the situation where, A, the prisoner refuses to\nassert under penalty of perjury that he or she is\nactually innocent; and applies if there was a tactical\ndecision at trial not to seek DNA testing at all or not\nto seek the most reliable form of DNA testing that was\navailable at the time?\nMR. NEUFELD: Justice Alito, first of all,\nhe was never asked in this pleading to assert his actual\ninnocence. As represented by his counsel --\nJUSTICE ALITO: You think that -- you think\nthat's a novel idea that never occurred to him?\nMR. NEUFELD: Well, no, no. It's in the --\nin 1983, it is not required or even asked that he make\nthat kind of statement. He did all through the State\ncourts. In the State courts he always asserted his\ninnocence; through his lawyers he asserted his\ninnocence, and indeed --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Under oath? Under oath\nso that he would be subject to penalty for perjury?\nMR. NEUFELD: No, because it wasn't\nrequired. Indeed, Your Honor, to respond directly to\nyour question, to both of your questions, If this Court\ndecided, as Justice Scalia mentioned before as well,\nthat one requirement of this right is that a person\nswear under the penalties of perjury, knowing that he\ncould be prosecuted, that he's actually innocent, then\nso be it. It can be remanded for that purpose.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, he just --\nMR. NEUFELD: That is what the Innocence\nProtection Act requires, and no one has opposed that.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, why isn't that the\nend of this case, because I heard opposing counsel say\nif you go tomorrow and file a piece of paper and swear\non that piece of paper you're innocent, Alaska will give\nyou the DNA. Isn't that what he said? I heard him say\nthat, I thought.\nMR. NEUFELD: He said it, but I don't\nbelieve that --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, if he said it in this\nCourt in answer to a question, I don't see why that\nisn't binding.\nMR. NEUFELD: Well, they took the same\nposition in the trial court in Alaska. They said that\nhe is not entitled to DNA testing under the\npostconviction statute under any circumstances.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, wait. What I heard\nwas that if your client files a piece of paper that\nsays, I am innocent, then under this new procedure,\nwhich apparently I hadn't read about because I didn't\nfind it or it wasn't obvious in the brief, that then\nthey will give him the DNA. Now that's either right or\nit's wrong; and if it's right, I think that's the end of\nit, and if it's wrong, well, then we'll have to proceed.\nBut I would proceed on the basis that this swearing\nrequirement is not sufficient.\nMR. NEUFELD: Well, I don't believe that you\nneed the swearing requirement, because he has previously\nasserted his innocence; but what's most important\nhere --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but the whole\npoint is that, Justice Ginsburg brought out the point,\nthat he hasn't asserted his innocence under oath. So\nthere's no cost to him for asking for the DNA evidence.\nIf there's -- if we're writing up a new constitutional\nright and we require as part of that that he assert his\ninnocence under perjury, and if he fails to do that,\nhe'll be prosecuted for perjury, that might at least put\nsome limitation on the number of people who can assert\nthe right.\nMR. NEUFELD: And I would agree with that.\nI think that's an excellent idea. And the problem is no\none's suggesting that Alaska can't do that as a\nrestriction. Indeed they can, but Alaska has had no\nmechanism at all.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: If you accept that -- of\ncourse it does; and this is not a new procedure. I -- I\ndidn't understand it to be a new procedure, as\nJustice Breyer has described it. It is the procedure of\nhabeas corpus.\nThey have a procedure for habeas corpus\nwhich includes discovery, and all he has to do is come\nin and say, you know, I have been wrongfully convicted;\nI am innocent; and I want to discover this evidence in\norder to establish it, so that I can get out of jail.\nMR. NEUFELD: That contradicts the position\nthey took in the -- in the State court, Your Honor.\nThey specifically said in the State courts that it is\nnot enough to simply assert one's innocence; that you\nactually have to have proofs, facts that -- that\ndemonstrate your innocence before you get to that\ndiscovery. It is a Catch-22 situation.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, we can ask your\nopposite, opposing counsel. We can put it to him point\nblank. That's what I thought he said, and we -- we\ncertainly will clarify that. But there's another\npossible impediment here to your claim. If we assume\nthat there is this constitutional right, and it's\navailable in 1983, this trial was in 1993. He brings\nthe 1983 action in 2003. Counsel told us that this\nbetter method of testing has been available since the\nlate nineties.\nWith any constitutional right, there's an\nobligation of due diligence on the part of the claimant.\nYou can't come in 10 years later, for example, and say\n-- say there was a tainted juror or something like that.\nIt was -- it -- when you're claiming even evidence that\nwasn't available at the trial, you have to make the\napplication with due diligence.\nMR. NEUFELD: I agree with that, Your Honor.\nI mean, not only is Alaska not making a claim that he\ndid not act with due diligence here, but they're not\ndoing -- they're making that claim for a reason. As\nsoon as he finished his direct appeal, he immediately\nfiled a pro se petition seeking postconviction DNA\ntesting, within months. And then -- in the late 1990s.\nAnd then eventually he was assigned a public defender to\nrepresent him, and that led to the 2001 filing in the\nState court which predated the 2003 filing in the\nFederal court.\nSo he's moved as quickly as he possibly\ncould as soon as he knew that there was this powerful\nevidence that could be dispositive.\nThis is the very first case litigated to our\nknowledge anywhere in the country where the prosecutor\nconcedes that a DNA would be absolutely slam-dunk\ndispositive of innocence, but doesn't consent to it.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It is very strange. Why\ndid they do that, I wonder.\nMR. NEUFELD: Well it's --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: There was a lot of other\nevidence in the case, wasn't there?\nMR. NEUFELD: Well, that's --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't know what they\nthought they were doing.\nMR. NEUFELD: 10 -- 10 years ago,\nJustice Scalia, the U.S. Department of Justice\narticulated a materiality test for DNA testing; and they\nsaid, like you're saying: Yes, let's look at the\nevidence of guilt; but then let's say to ourselves,\nlooking out of the other eye, what if there's a\nfavorable result? What impact would that have on the\nfavorable results?\nThat was the position adopted by the United\nStates Department of Justice 10 years ago. That was the\nposition, of course, that we're urging here. That was\nthe position adopted by the U.S. Congress five years\nago, and that materiality test has been adopted by 41\nStates to date.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So if it is so\nclear --\nMR. NEUFELD: Only Alaska --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Sorry, counsel. If\nit is so clear that this is the right way to go, that\nthe Federal Government, 41 States -- does it make sense\nfor us to devise a constitutional right to displace what\nthe legislatures have done?\nMR. NEUFELD: It is not a question of\ndisplacing what the legislatures have done,\nMr. Chief Justice. It is a question of when the State\nof Alaska chooses to provide a mechanism for\npostconviction relief. And here they do.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It is exactly a\nquestion of displacing what the States have done because\nnow this question is going to be subject to\nconstitutional law and it's going to be litigated in a\nvariety of cases with a variety of claims. Do you get\nthe right to it when you confess? Do you get the right\nto it when you've waived it at trial? Do you get the\ncontinuous right to it as technology advances and makes\nthe test more sensitive? All of those matters will be\nFederal constitutional questions for us to decide.\nMR. NEUFELD: I don't think necessarily,\nYour Honor. I think first of all, here we have a clean\nslate if you will, because there were no mechanisms\npassed by the Alaska legislature.\nWe have seen, and which is interesting, we\nactually think the Innocence Protection Act as passed by\nCongress is a marvelous statute that no one is -- is\nquestioning one bit. It is odd that the Solicitor\nGeneral walks into this courtroom and asks this Court to\nadopt a materiality test that was rejected by Congress.\nThe one that we are asking for here is\nsimply that you look at the evidence, the evidence of\nguilt that Justice Scalia pointed out --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but the whole\nquestion -- it is kind of along the same lines I've been\ntalking. The reason they might -- they're saying don't\nadopt that test, is because the question is whether it\nshould be adopted as a matter of constitutional law.\nThey may, and I suspect they do since they represent the\ngovernment, think Congress's balancing makes perfect\nsense. It is a different question here.\nMR. NEUFELD: Well, I agree with you. Our\nposition is, is that the test that they're calling for\nhere is irrational; that it's completely irrational when\nyou have something as powerful and new as DNA evidence,\nwhich can conclusively -- unlike any other forensic\ndiscipline that --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, just to get back\nto the point you were making earlier, it really doesn't\nmatter what the Congress said. It is a question of\nrationality under the Constitution.\nMR. NEUFELD: That is -- that is correct. I\nonly use what Congress said and what the other 41 states\nsaid to illustrate how there is an overwhelming\nconsensus now that to do it the way that Alaska wants to\ndo it is frankly irrational.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Is the irrationality\nultimately that they require an assertion, with some\nbasis for the assertion, that in fact there is evidence\nthat would show innocence? Is the irrationality the\ncart before the horse?\nMR. NEUFELD: I think I understand the\nquestion. Please interrupt me if I don't and I\napologize.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: You -- you were asked a\nquestion earlier what it was in effect about the Alaska\nprocedure which -- which in effect was constitutionally\nfrustrating. I understood that you did not claim that\nthe requirement to claim innocence was the problem,\nalthough they did require that; but that the -- that the\nreal problem was that you not only had to claim\ninnocence; you had to be in a position to claim that the\nevidence you were seeking would exonerate you. And in\nthe DNA case you couldn't do that, ultimately, until it\nhad been testing. And so it was that second point, in\neffect that they are putting the cart before the horse,\ntell us what the test is going to show before you test\nit, that I thought was the sticking point for you. Am I\ncorrect about your position?\nMR. NEUFELD: You are correct; and\nJustice Souter, they never ever said in -- in their\nbrief, in their petition for certiorari, that they\nbelieved that a condition for getting the test should be\nthat a person swear out an affidavit asserting\ninnocence. They are raising that now in a reply brief a\nweek before this oral argument.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, that goes -- that\ngoes to the first point.\nMR. NEUFELD: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And I -- I was concerned\nwith the second. I will be happy to get back to the\nfirst, but I just want to know your position on the\nsecond, the cart before the horse point.\nMR. NEUFELD: The second point is -- and\nthat -- which is why the only rational test is the\nCatch-22 or cart before the horse that you're referring\nto -- which is we can't speculate, based on the other\nevidence, whether it's going to be a DNA exclusion or a\nDNA inclusion. If you look at the amicus briefs that\nhave been submitted here by exonerees, by people who\nreceived clemency, all kinds of people, you will see\ncases where the evidence of guilt was much more\noverwhelming than it was here. You will see cases where\n50 percent of the judges that reviewed those cases found\nthe evidence to be very compelling evidence of guilt or\nindeed overwhelming evidence of guilt, but nonetheless\nDNA trumped all that evidence and excluded those.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And you will see cases\nwhere the defendant maintained that the defendant was\ninnocent. Now, whether this was a requirement imposed\nby Alaska or not, it seems to me you cannot point to the\npractice of the other States and say Alaska must have\nthe same practice.\nWhen, in fact, you don't comply with the\npractices of the other States. Almost all of them do\nrequire an assertion of innocence, which your client has\nnot made. I cannot imagine how you can simply -- oh,\nlook at all these other -- 44 other states, when your\nclient does not meet the requirements that those States\nwould impose.\nMR. NEUFELD: I'm not ignoring it at all;\nI'm simply saying that 1983, by its very nature, doesn't\nrequire it, and Alaska practice --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Why shouldn't --\nMR. NEUFELD: -- didn't require it, but if\nyou do --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Whether 1983 requires it\ndepends in part on whether we recognize a free-standing\nright to test DNA evidence. As I -- as I conceive it,\nthat sounds to me like substantive due process and\nrightly so.\nOne condition for recognizing a substantive\ndue process right could be that the individual claiming\nthe right to test claims that he is actually innocent.\nWhat would unreasonable about that?\nMR. NEUFELD: There would -- nothing be\nunreasonable about that, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Is your client prepared to\nmake that claim?\nMR. NEUFELD: Your Honor, I assume he\ncertainly would. I --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I'm not asking you. I'm\nasking for his position through counsel now. Do you\nknow?\nMR. NEUFELD: I know he has told every other\nlawyer who has represented him that he was actually\ninnocent. I --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Was his assertion\nbefore -- his confession -- his confessions before the\nparole board made under oath?\nMR. NEUFELD: I believe it was made under\noath, Your Honor --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So he's guilty of\nperjury one way or the other, either before the parole\nboard or in his assertions of actual innocence here.\nMR. NEUFELD: Well, wouldn't it be ironic,\nYour Honor, if we do the DNA test and he's exonerated\nand it proves he didn't do it at all, then the State\nwent ahead and prosecuted him for perjury because he did\nsomething just so he knew he could get out because,\nunder Alaskan law, unless you accept responsibility,\nyou're not going to get out.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, wouldn't it be\nironic --\nMR. NEUFELD: Two of our --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Excuse me, counsel.\nWould it be ironic to say that you do not have access\nwhen you're guilty of perjury one way or the other?\nMR. NEUFELD: I think that would be\nterrible. If the -- if the primary goal of our criminal\njustice system or one of them is that someone who is\nactually innocent of the crime for which he is serving a\nsentence can't -- okay -- present the evidence that will\nwin him his freedom. He --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Could you say this -- could\nyou say, suppose -- I'm just testing this out -- that\nlike any other governmental action, this action of\nrefusing the DNA evidence is subject to the Fourteenth\nAmendment's requirement that there be a reasonable\nbasis? Can't be arbitrary. Now, withholding DNA is a\ngovernmental action, and so you cannot do so\narbitrarily. If you were to do so simply because the\ndefendant would not sign a new complaint under this new\nprocedure, which I somehow missed in the reply brief,\nthat's a good basis for withholding it. He should be\nwilling to do that.\nIf the reason they won't give him the DNA is\nbecause before the parole board he said he was innocent,\nthat, to me -- not to others but to me -- that would\nmean nothing. Of course, he's going to say he's\ninnocent. He doesn't want to spend the rest of his life\nin prison. Okay?\nSo, I -- I would say, but not maybe others\nwould say, that if that's their reason for not giving\nit, I'd hear further argument, but that would be\narbitrary. But if their reason for not giving it is\njust because he won't file a new piece of paper in which\nhe says he's innocent or there's nothing to lose there,\nthen I think the State's being arbitrary. Okay?\nSuppose we said that: The rule is\nnon-arbitrary with illustrations, send it back to the\nStates. And of course when they apply their own\nstatutes, by and large they're not being arbitrary.\nMR. NEUFELD: I think that's a very sound\napproach to this, Justice Breyer.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, it does help you win.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. NEUFELD: It has that added advantage,\nJustice Breyer.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes.\nMR. NEUFELD: But -- but, quite honestly,\nwe've had two exonerees that are pointed out in the\nprosecutors' brief and in the exonerees' brief who did\nin fact that. They actually said to the parole board,\nyes, they were guilty, because they knew that was the\nonly way they could get out. And then the DNA testing\nwas done a couple of years later and, boom, it turned\nout they were completely innocent.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you have a --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Sorry.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you have a\nconstitutional right to the DNA evidence if the accuracy\nof the test was the same as the one that your counsel\nsubmitted at trial?\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: In other words,\nlimits it to -- what was it -- 16 percent or something\nlike that?\nMR. NEUFELD: I think you would -- because\nnumber one --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, all right.\nThen, obviously, the next question is at level of\naccuracy does your constitutional right no longer apply?\nMR. NEUFELD: Well, the constitutional right\ndoesn't apply with a -- with a level of accuracy. The\nconstitutional right applies in prohibiting the State\nfrom arbitrarily preventing you access to the evidence.\nThere's a very compelling record --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, just so to\nfollow up on that -- so you -- if -- if the evidence\nshowed that there was -- would show that there was a one\nout of two chance that your client was innocent, then\nyou think you still have a right -- a constitutional\nright of access to that evidence?\nMR. NEUFELD: No. I think the reason you\nhave it here, Your Honor, is that Alaska concedes -- I\nmean, when have you ever heard it before in a case?\nAlaska concedes that this powerful DNA test is so\npowerful that if he gets a favorable result, it is\ndispositive, he is actually innocent. Okay. That's how\npowerful this is.\nAnd so when you try and compare this to\nother types of either earlier DNA or other types of\nscientific evidence, you can't. And it's because of the\nunique power of these STRs, and the CODIS system, which\nallows for cold hits. So, it's not just the 232 people\nwho have been exonerated. We've also identified --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So fingerprint --\nfingerprints apparently are covered by it. They have\nfingerprint evidence that they are not releasing. So do\nyou have a constitutional right of access to that\nevidence?\nMR. NEUFELD: Well, I know it's slightly\noutside the record, but just this week the National\nAcademy of Science said that fingerprints don't have the\nsame indicia of reliability that these DNA tests have.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, I'm sure --\nMR. NEUFELD: And --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sure they're not\nas accurate as the DNA tests. I'm trying to figure out\nwhat the limit of the constitutional right you're\nasserting is.\nMR. NEUFELD: The limit is -- the limit is\n-- it's the same limit, if you will, that the Innocence\nProtection Act articulated and at least 41 of the States\nthat passed acts have articulated, and by common law the\nother States all gave DNA testing, the ones that didn't\nhave a statute, with the sole exception in the country\nbeing Alaska, is if there's either a reasonable\nprobability that the DNA tests will -- that a favorable\nDNA test result can prove innocence, okay, and you did\nnot -- you know -- that's the standard if you will,\nokay, to get the test.\nI would point out that I could understand\npeople having some disagreement about where that bar\nshould be in terms of how much proof of innocence the\ntest would provide.\nJUSTICE ALITO: How can this constitutional\nright be limited to DNA evidence? I presume that there\nare -- that there may be other scientific advances in\nthe testing of physical evidence, and if that happens,\nwhy wouldn't the right apply to those as well? Advances\nin -- advances in detecting fingerprints or testing\nfibers or all sorts of other things?\nMR. NEUFELD: Well, again, fibers didn't do\nany better than fingerprints. In fact, they did a lot\nworse in the National Academy report issued last week.\nI do think, however -- and I would hope that the day\ncomes that will be more truth machines like DNA, which\nwill make it easier for factfinders to have dispositive\nevidence of guilt or innocence. But right now, there's\nonly one test that caused the President of the United\nStates to appropriate billions of dollars for testing,\nthat caused Congress to create a special statute saying,\nwe don't even want this in habeas; we want this statute\nto be very special. We'd like to give people --\nJUSTICE ALITO: I'd like to get back to the\nsecond part of the question I asked at the start, which\nyou never really got a chance to answer: Would it be\nunconstitutional for a State to say that a -- a prisoner\ncan get postconviction access to DNA evidence, but not\nwhere it appears that the prisoner is gaming the system?\nNot where the prisoner declined at trial to ask for DNA\ntesting for a tactical reason because there was a chance\nthat the DNA evidence would be inculpatory? Would that\nbe unconstitutional?\nMR. NEUFELD: Well, first of all, in this\ncase, that didn't happen. The record is very clear that\nhe personally requested the DNA testing, and --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: His counsel -- his counsel\nforwent the DNA testing, and we attribute the actions of\ncounsel to the defendant.\nMR. NEUFELD: And the prosecutor also\nforwent the DNA testing because they --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But can we get an answer\nto Justice Alito's question -- a hypothetical, the one\nhe put -- could you put that condition on a statute or a\nrule consistently with the constitutional of the United\nStates?\nMR. NEUFELD: I don't think so if you -- if\nyou couch it in the loosest terms that Justice Alito\ndid, namely, \"gaming the system.\" Because I don't\nbelieve a person in Mr. Osborne's position could ever be\ngaming the system. Now, let me explain why so.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well -- well, let's assume\nthat counsel and the defendant -- after full discussion\nand being fully advised, say this is too dangerous; we\ndon't want the DNA test; we'll shoot the dice; we're not\ngoing to have the DNA test. He loses. Can you then get\nthe DNA test? Or, as Justice Alito's question pointed\nout, could you have a condition that when you've made\nthis conscious choice, you lost your right for later DNA\ntesting? That's what he asked. I still don't have the\nanswer.\nMR. NEUFELD: Okay. I would say, yes, in\nmuch the same way that the Innocence Protection Act says\nif a defendant expressly and voluntarily waives on the\nrecord a right to that DNA testing, which is so\nfundamental because it goes right to the core of\neverything, innocence versus guilt, then it would not be\nunreasonable to prohibit him from having the DNA test.\nBut that was --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Sorry. I'm sorry.\nWith the different questions asked, I have lost where\nthe answer is. You say it is still part of the\nconstitutional right if he forewent the test at trial,\nor it is not?\nMR. NEUFELD: What I'm saying is it would\nnot be an unconstitutional restriction like the\nInnocence Protection Act if the State of Alaska required\n-- which it does not now because there is no legislative\nscheme but in the future required -- that the -- a\ndefendant who doesn't want DNA testing has to\nvoluntarily and explicitly waive that on the record.\nThat -- the voluntary and knowing waiver is a\nrequirement in the IPA, and if -- if Alaska did\nsomething like that, I think that would be -- that would\nnot be irrational.\nHowever, I must point out in all honesty\nthat there are a number of people who are mentioned in\nthe exonerating briefs such as Eduardo Velasquez and Mr.\nTony, whose lawyers did just that. They said, for\nstrategic reasons, we don't want the DNA test. And then\n-- boom -- years later they get the DNA test, and they\nare completely exonerated. So --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, you seem to be\nsympathetic to that position. But as Justice Alito's\nquestion again points out, what you are doing is setting\nup a game in which it would be really unwise to have the\nDNA test. Take your chances.\nMR. NEUFELD: Why would it --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: You have a -- you have a\nbuilt-in -- you have a -- a built-in second chance.\nMR. NEUFELD: Let's for a moment --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And that's just -- that's\njust not sound trial strategy, counsel, and you know\nthat.\nMR. NEUFELD: Justice Kennedy, let's for a\nmoment think about it in a purely logical way. If\nsomeone is innocent and wants to have a DNA test -- okay\n-- as Mr. Osborne did, they will do what they can to try\nand get that DNA test.\nIf they get the DNA test years later,\nthey're not getting a new hearing. They are not getting\na -- or they are not getting a new trial. They are not\ngetting any of the other things that this Court often is\nworried about. All they are getting is a darn test.\nAnd they stay in prison while they get that darn test.\nAnd if that test shows that they actually committed the\ncrime -- okay -- if it shows they committed the crime,\nthen they get nothing.\nNot only do they get nothing, they get\npunished. They get punished because no -- no court in\nhabeas or in any other postconviction relief will ever\nthink about them again. And, in fact, the parole board\nwill --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But they will have acquired\nthe advantage of having a chance of the jury's\nacquitting them at the trial. Because by not asking for\nthe DNA testing, they was a chance the jury might let\nthem off. Had they asked for it then and had it shown\nconclusively, the game was over. So it is gaming the\nsystem.\nMR. NEUFELD: Well, the reason why I -- I\ndon't believe it is gaming the system -- and perhaps,\nyou know, you can help me with this -- is if he's\ngetting the test now and he doesn't get out of prison\nwhile he's having the test and he's actually using his\nown money to pay for the test and if the test shows he's\nguilty, the parole board is going to turn him down. He\ncan't go back in any other courts asking for any other\nremedies. So he is in a much worse position.\nOn the other hand, if it proves he's\ninnocent, then he's out. So how does that game the\nsystem?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Ex-ante. We're -- we're\nlooking at it at the time of the trial. Does its pay\nfor the defendant to ask for a DNA test? Well, of\ncourse, it doesn't. Because if he asks for it and it --\nit finds that he's guilty, that's the end of it. There\nis no chance of the jury acquitting him.\nMR. NEUFELD: Well -- well, why --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So why not just not ask for\nit and if it turns out that the jury happens to convict\nhim anyway, then ask for it?\nMR. NEUFELD: In -- in all practice, it is a\nmoot point. Because this is a transitional right for a\nvery small group of people who were tried during the\n1980s and early 1990s.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: On that -- on that point,\nI just want to make clear: In the present posture of\nthis case, I take it that if the Federal Innocence\nProtection Act applied, he would not qualify?\nMR. NEUFELD: No. He would -- he would\nqualify.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: He --\nMR. NEUFELD: All he would have to do is --\nis go back and actually swear out a declaration under\npenalty of perjury --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but -- but as the\ncase now stands he does not qualify.\nMR. NEUFELD: Well, he's never been required\nto do that or asked to do that.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: As the case now stands, he\ndoes not qualify.\nMR. NEUFELD: Other than -- other than that,\nhe meets every single other criterion.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's a biggie, though.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: You're -- you're, in\neffect, asking us -- and you would say the -- the\nSolicitor General appears here -- you're -- you're, in\neffect, asking us to say that the Federal Witness\nProtection Act on these facts is unconstitutional.\nMR. NEUFELD: Oh, not at -- not at all, sir.\nAll I'm saying is that if he was on notice that that was\nrequired as part of the procedure in Alaska, then no\ndoubt he would sign that affidavit even under penalty of\nperjury. The problem is that it's not a requirement of\n1983, and there was no legislative scheme. I -- you\nknow --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I am quite dubious that --\nthat he would indeed sign it. I -- I was really struck\nby his affidavit in this case, number -- or paragraph 9\nof which says: \"I have no doubt whatsoever that\nretesting of the condom will prove once and for all\ntime\" -- and one expects to follow -- my innocence.\nThat's not what it says. \"Will prove once and for all\ntime either my guilt or innocence.\"\nMR. NEUFELD: Your Honor --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, you know, what is\nthis?\nMR. NEUFELD: Well, first of all, each and\nevery time with his own counsel, Justice Scalia, he was\nadamant about asserting his innocence. You have to\nappreciate that at this point in time, when there's a\ndiscussion about, you know, what a prize -- and it is\nour position that this action ends, if you will, okay,\nand the Court grants him access to the evidence under\n1983.\nAnd as was pointed out earlier during the\nargument of my adversary, there is a possibility that --\nthat the testing -- because, look, I wasn't at the -- at\nthe commission of the crime. I don't have a videotape\nin my head. I'm trying to be as honest and forthright\nwith you as I possibly can.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if there was a\nvideotape? Is that covered by the constitutional right\nyou are asserting?\nMR. NEUFELD: I -- well, you know, given\nwhat I now know about --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Are there\nphotographs or other evidence that --\nMR. NEUFELD: I don't think so. Given what\nI now know about Photo Shop, I don't have -- I don't\nnecessarily hold out that much reliability for that\neither, Justice Roberts.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's a good point.\nWhat -- how long under the Constitution does the State\nhave to retain this evidence?\nMR. NEUFELD: Under the Constitution there\nis no duty under current law to preserve the evidence.\nWe --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Would that be a\ncorollary of the constitutional right you are asking for\nhere?\nMR. NEUFELD: I don't believe so. I --\nhowever, with one caveat. And the one caveat is it is a\ndifferent situation if a person like Mr. Osborne or\nsomebody else specifically says, I want to do DNA\ntesting in this case, files whatever appropriate\nprocedure in whatever court to commence that action, and\nthen, and only then, the other side goes out and\ndestroys the res that is the subject of that litigation.\nAt that point I think that would be in bad faith.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And I agree that\nwould be -- that -- yes. I am just wondering if there\nwould be any objection to an absolute rule that says\nwhat: After two years, after one year of conviction?\nMR. NEUFELD: No -- no objection. But on a\npractical level again, what we're seeing is that States\nall over the country want to preserve this evidence, not\njust for the wrongful conviction cases but also to\nenable detectives who are working cold cases to have\naccess to evidence.\nAnd if the evidence isn't there any more,\nthey can't work them. So we're seeing a movement across\nthe country now to preserve that evidence.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: May I -- may I just ask\none point.\nMR. NEUFELD: Certainly.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I take it he is not now in\ncustody for this offense?\nMR. NEUFELD: I believe he is in custody --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Not for this offense?\nMR. NEUFELD: Well, I -- I think what\nhappened is -- and I -- and I -- I can't swear to this\n-- is -- is that he was -- he got a conditional release\non the other matter. And then the conditional release\nwas violated as well.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: He's being held on other\nchanges.\nMR. NEUFELD: That's right.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But he's not now in\ncustody for this offense.\nMR. NEUFELD: He's -- he's not, but I don't\nthink that would make a difference in the outcome.\nCertainly, if a person had a death warrant in one State\nand then they were charged in another State, they would\nstill have a liberty interest in the outcome of that\nother case.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Was he released on\nparole with respect to this offense?\nMR. NEUFELD: I -- I believe he -- he was\nreleased on what's called conditional release.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And was his\nconfession a necessary predicate to that release?\nMR. NEUFELD: Well, under Alaska law one of\nthe key requirements to get parole is that you accept\nresponsibility for the crime. And so without a certain\n--\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So a confession that\nwould be perjurious if he claimed actual innocence now\nwas responsible for his release?\nMR. NEUFELD: I would hope, Mr. Chief\nJustice, that I would be principled enough that if I was\nactually innocent and they told me that the only way I\ncould get out was to say I committed a crime, that I\nmight say, forget it. I'll spend the next thirty years\nin prison. But I can certainly understand --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I understand that.\nMR. NEUFELD: Yes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But he's been --\nother than other crimes he committed, he's been released\non the basis of what you say is an unprincipled\nconfession. And now he is --\nMR. NEUFELD: I believe he has been -- he's\nback in, though, I think, because of the conditional\nrelease. It's been violated. One second.\nHe had a parole -- I'm -- I'm told that he\nhad a parole revocation hearing on the other case and\nthat he was given six more years to serve on the -- on\nthe underlying case which is the core of this oral\nargument.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So his parole was\nrevoked because he committed another offense?\nMR. NEUFELD: That's my understanding.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay. Thank you,\ncounsel.\nMR. NEUFELD: Thank you very much.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Now, counsel, we'll\ngive you three more minutes.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF KENNETH M. ROSENSTEIN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I -- before you start,\nwould you -- I want you to clear up the question that\nJustice Breyer asked. Assume on remand he would now\nmake the declaration under perjury that he's innocent.\nI understood you to say that would enable him get\ndiscovery, not necessarily to say he would get the DNA\nevidence. Am I right?\nMR. ROSENSTEIN: If he were to file a new\napplication for postconviction relief with an affidavit\nthat the civil rules of discovery would apply, and he, I\nbelieve, would be -- be able to obtain the evidence that\nhe seeks. However --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: How about --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Would you resist that\nrequest?\nMR. ROSENSTEIN: Well, there are -- there\nare possibilities of procedural default. Right. And\nthat would be for the court --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: You cannot confirm that\nyou would acquiesce and recommend that he get the DNA\nsample under those conditions?\nMR. ROSENSTEIN: I -- yes. I -- I believe I\ncould.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you would still want\nto leave yourself open to make the objection that he had\na chance to get this at trial and -- and -- and decided\nnot to get it.\nMR. ROSENSTEIN: As I say --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Wouldn't those objections\ncontinue to apply?\nMR. ROSENSTEIN: I'm --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, it -- it seems to\nme that -- that all -- all that you have to concede is\nthat there is some means for him to get into court, with\nthose -- those exceptions that other States make; and\nother States make an exception for gaming the system.\nSo, so long as he can get in in habeas corpus it seems\nto me you can very well leave for later whether you are\ngoing to concede that even though -- even though he\ndidn't ask for it at trial, he can get it now.\nMR. ROSENSTEIN: That's true, Your Honor.\nAnd -- and that was --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, why give it away?\nMR. ROSENSTEIN: Well --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- any more than you gave\naway the fact that this is going to --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Why don't --\nJUSTICE BREYER: We would like to know what\nyou do --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why don't we -- I'm\nsorry. Justice Stevens.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yes. I just want to be --\nif your answer, as I understand it, is he can now apply\nfor discovery, but you don't know what will happen then.\nMR. ROSENSTEIN: Well, before you reach the\ndiscovery issues there would be the issues of procedural\ndefault.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Right.\nMR. ROSENSTEIN: Once those were cleared\naway then he would be able to --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But the net result is that\nit is perfectly clear to me from the argument that you\nhave not conceded that if he now files the paper, he\nwill definitely get the DNA.\nMR. ROSENSTEIN: Not that he would -- that's\ncorrect. Not that he will definitely get that.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Okay.\nMR. ROSENSTEIN: I want to clear up --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But you -- you referred\nto the civil rules, and in discovery, in criminal cases\nas in civil cases, it -- ordinarily you have to prove\nthat you have a basis for a claim. Like you don't get\non the civil side discovery before you can pass the\n12(b)(6) threshold that you have stated a claim.\nAre you giving that up here? Because he's\nseeking the discovery but he hasn't established that he\nhas a tenable claim.\nMR. ROSENSTEIN: Justice Ginsburg, Mr.\nOsborne by filing an affidavit that would accompany his\napplication, that would -- I think that would operate to\nstate a claim.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Would there be instances\nwhen you, as the Attorney General of Alaska, would waive\nprocedural defaults, in order to determine if there was\nguilt or innocence in a case where DNA conclusively\nproved it, simply pause of your interest in not\nconfining innocent people?\nMR. ROSENSTEIN: That -- that's conceivable,\nYour Honor; but in -- in Mr. Osborne's case, he's had 14\nyears to step forward and declare his innocence as any\ntruly innocent --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: All you're can say in\nanswer to my question is, to your particular approach to\nyour duties here, is that that's conceivable?\nMR. ROSENSTEIN: Yes, Your Honor. It is.\nBecause I don't think that the mere existence of the\npossibility that DNA could exonerate is necessarily\nsufficient -- a sufficient basis to then do the testing.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay. This is where I --\nlook.\nHe files a new piece of paper. Now, if\nyou're going to oppose that, on the ground that it\nwasn't procedurally correct, one; on the ground, two, he\ndidn't ask for this DNA at trial, though he might have\nmet with the charge, what was at issue at trial is\nsomething very different; three, that he wasn't\nguilty -- you know, too much evidence against him, met\nwith the claim, there wasn't much evidence against\nhim -- okay, we have the case in front of us; we'll\ndecide it.\nBut if you're prepared to concede \"I'm not\ngoing to raise those things,\" then their client has what\nhe wants -- the DNA. So which is it?\nMR. ROSENSTEIN: I -- I'm not sure I\nunderstand your -- your question, Your Honor. I'm\nsorry.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I'm going to just repeat\nit. He -- His client follows your procedure. \"Please\ngive me DNA.\"\nNow will you give it to him? Or are you\ngoing to meet him with the same defenses that you raise\nhere?\nMR. ROSENSTEIN: The --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Wrong procedure. You\nask -- you could have gotten it at trial, which he says\nisn't true, and there was too much evidence, which he\nsays isn't true. Okay? So what are we going to have,\nMr. Rosenstein?\nMR. ROSENSTEIN: If he -- if he were to do\nas you say, then with respect to the request for\ndiscovery, I believe that our only defense would be the\nprocedural defense of -- you know -- lack of due\ndiligence or -- or something along -- or untimely --\nJUSTICE BREYER: If the only defense is\nprocedure --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- that defense --\nMR. ROSENSTEIN: Pardon me?\nJUSTICE SOUTER: If he walks into court and\nswears, \"I am innocent,\" subject to penalties of\nperjury, \"Please let me look at the DNA,\" as I\nunderstand your answer, your answer will be, we will\nthen raise issues of procedural default, waiver, et\ncetera. You will not say, on the contrary, \"let him\nlook at the DNA.\" Is that -- is my understanding\ncorrect?\nMR. ROSENSTEIN: I -- I can't say that we\nwould actually do that, but we certainly have the -- the\nright to do that. And there's nothing wrong with\nproceeding --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: In any --\nMR. ROSENSTEIN: Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
