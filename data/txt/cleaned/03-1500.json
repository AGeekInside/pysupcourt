CHEMERINSKY: Good morning, Justice\nStevens, and may it please the Court:\nOn the grounds of the Texas State Capitol,\nthere is one evident religious symbol that conveys a\npowerful religious message that there is a theistic\nGod and that God has committed rules for behavior.\nOf course, the government may put\nreligious symbols on its property, including the Ten\nCommandments, but must do so in a way that does not\nendorse religion or a particular religion, but does\nnot have the purpose of advancing religion, but does\nnot favor any particular religion.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Chemerinsky, I\nsuppose that opening statement suggests that you\nthink that Thanksgiving proclamations are also\nunconstitutional, which were recommended by the very\nfirst Congress, the same Congress that proposed the\nFirst Amendment.\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: No, Your Honor, I would\n- I'm sorry.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: They also refer to one\nGod, to a theistic ruler of the universe.\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: No, Your Honor, I think\nthe Thanksgiving proclamations would be\nconstitutional. I think it's analogous to the\nlegislative prayers that this Court upheld in\nChambers v. Marsh. I think it's very different than\nthis Ten Commandments monument.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: All right. But then you\nhave to narrow your opening statement and say that\ncertainly the State can acknowledge the existence of\na unitary God without offending the Establishment\nClause.\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: Yes, Your Honor, but it\nall depends on how it is done. Here the way in which\nit is done is the most powerful and profound\nreligious message that this Court has ever considered\non government property. Here you have a monument\nthat proclaims not only there is a God, but God has\ndictated rules for behavior for those who follow him\nor her.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I don't know whether\nthat's any more profound or ultra-religious,\nsuper-religious than the prayer that the chaplain\ngives every day in the House.\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: Your Honor, there is a\ndifference between a prayer that a chaplain gives --\nin Chambers v. Marsh, this Court emphasized that the\nprayer by the chaplain was a nonsectarian prayer.\nThis is very much sectarian. This proclaims that\nthere is a God. It proclaims --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I mean, I haven't\nread the prayer. So I would be surprised if I went\nthrough all the prayers and there was no mention,\ndirect or indirect, of the Ten Commandments or a\ncouple of them.\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: Your Honor, I would be\nsurprised because here, if you look at these\ncommandments, it's that God has claimed that he is\nthe only God, prohibiting idolatry, prohibiting\ngraven images, prohibiting taking the name of the\nLord and God in vain. Requiring observing of the\nsabbath. This is God dictating to God's followers\nrules for behavior.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Is there any other -- I\nmean, you can continue if you want, but one\ndifference which I've written down is you say that\nthe difference between this and the prayer is that\nthis is more profoundly religious. Is there any\nother difference, in your opinion?\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: No. I think the key\ndifference is --\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's the difference?\nSo if I happen to read these prayers in the Congress\nand I came to the conclusion that in terms of a\nreligious message, I actually thought the prayers had\nthe more religious message, then I should vote\nagainst you.\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: No, Your Honor. There\nare, of course, other differences. As I said to\nJustice Scalia earlier, with regard to legislative\nprayer in Chambers versus Marsh, this Court said that\nthere was a history going back to the very first\nCongress that allowed there to be those kinds of\nreligious invocations. Ten Commandments monuments\nstanding by themselves, as they do here, certainly\nare not of that historic origin.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: How about if they're\npackaged in a museum-like setting and there is some\ninterest on the part of the State in preserving\nsomething.\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: And displaying a whole\nvariety of things?\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: Of course, there can be\nTen Commandments or any religious works as part of a\nmuseum setting. This isn't a museum setting, Your\nHonor. Every monument on the Texas --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Is this a kind of a\npark? What do we regard this space as? What is it?\nIs it a park-like setting?\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: It is a park-like\nsetting. It is the acres of the State Capitol\ngrounds. Every monument on the State Capitol grounds\nis there because the State legislature wanted to\nconvey a particular message. It is a felony in\nTexas, an impeachable offense to put anything on the\nCapitol grounds without the approval of the\nlegislature.\nMost of the monuments are there to honor\nwar veterans. This is the only religious message\nanywhere on the Capitol grounds. And by itself --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, would it be all\nright, in your view, if they put several others up\nfor different religions? Then is it going to be\nokay?\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: If the clear purpose and\nmessage was to honor the diversity of religions in\nTexas, it would then be permissible. If it were a\nseries of displays like that frieze, the fifteen\ndifferent --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: You don't object to\nthat?\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: Quite the contrary, I\nthink it's a --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Or the depiction on the\ndoor of the Court?\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: Quite the contrary.\nThis is exactly how the State may display the Ten\nCommandments.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But the prayers in\nCongress don't do that and our Thanksgiving\nproclamations don't do that. They invoke a God, a\nunitary God, and that's contrary to the dictates of\nsome religions that believe that there are a lot of\ngods.\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: Yes, Your Honor, there\nis --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: We don't pray to gods,\nthe prayers are always to God. You know, I don't see\nwhy the one is good and the other is bad. It's no\nanswer to say, well, you know, the former has been\naround for a long time. Well, it has but it suggests\nwhat the framers and what our society for several\nhundred years has believed the Establishment Clause\nmeans.\nAnd it does not -- it is not too sectarian\nif it invokes a unitary God. Now, you're saying it\nbecomes too sectarian when it invokes the Ten\nCommandments.\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: No, Your Honor. I'm\nsaying several things. As I said earlier, first,\nthis Court in Chambers v. Marsh said that there was a\nunique history to legislative prayers. There isn't a\nsimilar history here.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Chemerinsky, too,\ndoesn't the venue count? After all, we have had the\nquestion of prayer in schools, and the Court has said\nthat that was not all right. Prayer in the\nlegislature was distinguished. So it's not just\nprayer anywhere that the government wants to have it\nis okay.\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: Of course, Justice\nGinsburg, the venue counts. And here the venue is\nvery important. It is the corner between the Texas\nState Capitol and the Texas Supreme Court.\nAnd in that way, this monument standing\nalone does convey the government's endorsement for\nreligion.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Okay. But if the\nlegislature itself can have its sessions opened with\na prayer, can the legislature itself want to have the\nTen Commandments posted within the legislative halls?\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: Your Honor, I think\nthere is a very different message that's conveyed.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Can it do that?\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: No, Your Honor, it can't\npost the Ten Commandments by itself in its\nlegislative halls because that would then be the\ngovernment endorsing expression for support for that\nmessage.\nIt cannot be, Your Honor, that just\nbecause there is a legislative prayer, that any\nreligious message anywhere on government property\nwould then be permissible. As Justice Kennedy has\nsaid in his opinion for --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: But it's so hard to\ndraw that line. If the legislature can open its own\nsessions attended by the public with a prayer, you\nsay it cannot, in the same building, display the Ten\nCommandments.\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: That's right, because\nthe message from the government is quite different.\nThe message with legislative prayers, as this Court\nfound in Chambers v. Marsh, is a recognition of a\nlong historical practice.\nBut when it comes to the Ten Commandments,\nit really is different than even a legislative\nprayer. This declares not only there is a God, but\nthat God has proclaimed rules for behavior. The Ten\nCommandments come from sacred texts.\nAs Justice Kennedy said in his opinion of\nCounty of Allegheny, certainly a city council could\nnot put atop the city hall building a large Latin\ncross, even if that city council begins every day\nwith a prayer.\nIt cannot be there just because some\nreligious messages are allowed, like a prayer, that\neverything then becomes permissible.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, you know, in the\nFirst Amendment speech area, we're very, very strict.\nA moment's delay in publication is a constitutional\ncrisis. And I'm not sure that we should carry that\nover to this area, where there is this obsessive\nconcern with any mention of religion. That seems to\nme to show a hostility to religion. I just don't see\na balanced dialogue in our cases or in these kinds of\narguments.\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: Your Honor, I don't\nbelieve there should be an obsessive concern with\nreligion. If the Ten Commandments are displayed as\npart of an overall display of law givers, like that\nfrieze, it's permissible. But when you put sacred\ntexts somewhere on government property, then the\nmessage is that the government is endorsing --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: This is a classic avert\nyour eyes. If an atheist walked by, he can avert his\neyes, he can think about something else.\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: I don't think so, Your\nHonor. This Court has said the key is that the\ngovernment can't endorse religion, in a way that\nmakes some feel like insiders and some like\noutsiders.\nImagine somebody who is Muslim or Buddhist\nor Hindu --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask you this\nquestion. Supposing -- I recently read a case from\nthe Seventh Circuit on what they did in Lacrosse,\nWisconsin. And as we all know, this organization has\ndonated Ten Commandments monuments all over the\ncountry. And what they did there is they sold the\nparcel back to the Eagles, their name, and put up a\nsign which read, this property is not owned or\nmaintained by the City of Lacrosse, nor does the city\nendorse the religious expression thereon.\nNow, my question to you is, if there were\na similar disclaimer on this monument, would that be\nan adequate remedy, in your view?\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: It would be a harder\ncase, but I don't think it would be an adequate\nremedy. And the reason is the city cannot put a\nreligious symbol standing alone on government\nproperty just through disclaimer.\nThat's exactly what County of Allegheny\nwas. There the nativity scene in the courthouse had\na plaque saying it was donated by others, but that\ncan't excuse it because otherwise the city could put\nthe large Latin cross just with a disclaimer.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But if the test is\nwhether the reasonable observer would think that the\ngovernment is endorsing the religious message,\nwouldn't the disclaimer make it clear to the\nreasonable observer the government was not endorsing\nthe message?\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: I think the disclaimer\nwould make it a harder case, but I think when you're\ndealing with the ground in a Texas State Capitol and\nthe Texas Supreme Court, that placement, when you're\ndealing with the Ten Commandments, sacred texts, I\nstill think that the message the reasonable observer\nwould be that this is the government endorsing\nreligion.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: At some point, would\nthe State's interest in preserving old objects\novercome the objection constitutionally?\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: Yes, at some point, it\ncould where it was clear to the reasonable observer\nthat it was there because it was an old object.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: How did this monument\nget there? Was it in -- is it true that it was put\nin as a result of promoting a movie about the Ten\nCommandments?\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: The record is unclear as\nto that. There are certainly many indications in the\npopular press that Cecil B. DeMille together with his\nmovie, The Ten Commandments, worked with the Friends\nof Eagles to have these monuments put around the\ncountry.\nBut there is nothing in the legislative\nhistory that links this particular monument to that.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Isn't the display on\nthe tablets on the top before you get to the text,\nbefore you get to, I am the Lord, thy God. I thought\nthat those were replicas of what was in the film.\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: I don't know that, Your\nHonor. I've tried to find out what that text is. It\nis not in Hebrew. It is not in a script that anyone\nwas able to recognize. But it is important to notice\nthat if you look at the entire monument, in addition\nto the Ten Commandments, there is also a Latin symbol\nof Christ, there is also Jewish Stars of David.\nAnd as I was saying in response to Justice\nKennedy's question, imagine the Muslim or the\nBuddhist who walks into the State Supreme Court to\nhave his or her case heard. That person will see\nthis monument and realize it's not his or her\ngovernment.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I thought Muslims accept\nthe Ten Commandments.\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: No, Your Honor, the\nMuslims do not accept the sacred nature of the Ten\nCommandments, nor do Hindus, or those who believe in\nmany gods, nor of course, do atheists.\nAnd for that matter, Your Honor, if a\nJewish individual would walk by this Ten\nCommandments, and see that the first commandment\nisn't the Jewish version, I am the Lord, thy God,\ntook you out of Egypt, out of slavery, would realize\nit's not his or her government either.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You know, I think\nprobably 90 percent of the American people believe in\nthe Ten Commandments, and I'll bet you that 85\npercent of them couldn't tell you what the ten are.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And when somebody goes by\nthat monument, I don't think they're studying each\none of the commandments. It's a symbol of the fact\nthat government comes -- derives its authority from\nGod. And that is, it seems to me, an appropriate\nsymbol to be on State grounds.\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: I disagree, Your Honor.\nFor the State to put that symbol between its State\nCapitol and the State Supreme Court is to convey a\nprofound religious message. If you're just saying,\nnow, this isn't there for its secular reason. If\nsomeone were to read this monument, one sees that it\nemphasizes its religious content.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It is a profound\nreligious message, but it's a profound religious\nmessage believed in by the vast majority of the\nAmerican people, just as belief in monotheism is\nshared by a vast majority of the American people.\nAnd our traditions show that there is\nnothing wrong with the government reflecting that. I\nmean, we're a tolerant society religiously, but just\nas the majority has to be tolerant of minority views\nin matters of religion, it seems to me the minority\nhas to be tolerant of the majority's ability to\nexpress its belief that government comes from God,\nwhich is what this is about.\nAs Justice Kennedy said, turn your eyes\naway if it's such a big deal to you.\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: I disagree, Your Honor.\nBecause this Court has said that above all, the\ngovernment can't make some feel like they're insiders\nand some like outsiders. Even if they're the\nmajority religion --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, suppose a\nnon-Christian, say a Muslim, comes before a judge who\nhas very strong Christian beliefs, a very religious\nperson. Does he feel like an outsider? And to\nrequire that we pretend that there is no religious\nmotivation, no deep religious conviction on the part\nof many of our public officials seems to me to be a\nhostility toward religion.\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: No, Your Honor. Imagine\nthat judge put the Ten Commandments right above his\nor her bench. That would make some individuals feel\nlike outsiders. Of course, many judges have\nreligious beliefs, but they can't have the religious\nbeliefs above them.\nAnd Your Honor, that's not hostility to\nreligion. As this Court said in County of Allegheny,\nexcluding religious symbols like the nativity scene,\nwhen displayed by itself, is not hostility to\nreligion.\nLast year in Locke v. Davie, this Court\nsaid that to deny funding through the State of\nWashington for scholarships was not hostility to\nreligion. Enforcing the Establishment Clause is not\nabout hostility to religion. It is about making sure\nthat every person who walks into that courtroom can\nfeel that it's his or her government.\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's an important point\nto me, but I don't see any way to get there in these\ndifficult cases without making a practical judgment\nabout whether that's really so.\nAnd the reason I say that, I start with\nGoldberg's opinion with Harlan in Schempp. And I\nknow there are a lot of others, but I don't know if\nwe've found a satisfactory test. And the point that\nthey make is the government should be noninvolved\nwith the religious, and it can't favor one over the\nother.\nBut at the same time, we are a religious\nnation, where most people do believe in God and most\nof our institutions flow from the religious nature of\nour people. The City on the Hill, proclaim liberty\nthroughout the land. All of those are religious.\nSo how can the government, without what\nthey call the pervasive and brooding commitment to\nsecularism, which they think would be wrong, become\nnecessarily involved because of our traditions, but\nnot go too far?\nNow, I come to the conclusion very\ntentatively, there is no way to do it other than look\nat the divisive quality of the individual display\ncase by case. And when I do that, I don't find much\ndivisiveness here.\nNow, I'm exposing the whole thing not\nbecause I'm accepting it, but I would love to hear\nwhat you think.\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: Yes, Your Honor, I think\nthat the test that this Court has formulated do draw\nthose lines. With regard to your point about\ndivisiveness, the Ten Commandments is enormously\ndivisive right now. I don't think we can ignore the\nsocial reality.\nThe chief justice of the Alabama Supreme\nCourt resigned, there are crowds outside today. I\ngot hate messages this week, not because people care\nabout the Ten Commandments as a secular document, but\npeople care about the Ten Commandments because it's a\nprofound religious message.\nAnd many want that religious message on\ngovernment property. And I'm saying the government\ncan put the Ten Commandments there as part of an\noverall display of law givers, because, Justice\nO'Connor, it's an overall display about diversity of\nreligion.\nBut when the Ten Commandments sits by\nitself it is, to use your word right now, enormously\ndivisive. And that's why, from that criteria, it\ndoes violate the Establishment Clause.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What about the opening of\nthis Court's session today, in a manner that has been\nused since John Marshall, is that divisive because\nthere are a lot of people who don't believe in God.\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: But You Honor, I\nthink that you have to distinguish between minimal\nreligious content and maximum religious content.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Chemerinsky, on\nthat point, how much of the Ten Commandments -- I\nmean, once we get to thou shalt not kill or murder,\nthen there are tenets to govern a society, but how\nmuch are strictly about the obligation that man owes\nto God?\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: The first of the two\ntablets, the first five commandments, Your Honor, and\nof course religions belief this was written in God's\nown hand and given to Moses. It's believed that the\nfirst five commandments that you were referring to\nare God's prescriptions for religious behavior.\nThe latter five, the others that you're\nreferring to, were God's commands for secular\nbehavior. All of these are God's commands to God's\npeople. And that's what makes it different than the\nminimal religious content of God save this Honorable\nCourt that Justice Scalia was referring to.\nThe core of Texas's argument seems to be\nthat it's there for secular purposes. But of course,\nif one looks at this monument, one sees that it's\nemphasizing the religious content and there is\nnothing that would lend the reasonable observer to\nsee the secular content.\nIt says in large letters, I am the Lord,\nthy God.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, suppose, Mr.\nChemerinsky, it was like Moses on that frieze where\nthere are commandments showing, but there are only\nthe sixth through tenth commandment. Would that be\nall right?\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: Your Honor, if it was\nlike Moses on that frieze together with fourteen other\nsymbols, absolutely okay, because it would clear to\nthe reasonable observer --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But if we just had the\nMoses with the tablet that has the instructions for\nhow people will conduct themselves in a civilized\nsociety versus worshiping the Lord.\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: I think that would still\nbe unconstitutional between the Texas State Capitol\nand the Texas Supreme Court because it would still be\nthe State of Texas expressing the message that there\nis a God and that God has dictated these rules for\nbehavior.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay, what if you go one\nstep further and there was simply a tablet without\nany embellishment about source saying, you know, thou\nshalt not kill, thou shalt not covet, et cetera,\nbasically just the last five commandments, pure and\nsimple. Would you have any objection on\nEstablishment Clause grounds?\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: If the tablets were by\nthemselves in that way, between the Texas Supreme\nCourt and the Texas State Capitol, it would be a\nharder case, but I believe it would still be\nunconstitutional because those tablets do convey a\nmessage that God --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, I'm just talking\nabout when I -- I don't know if I used the word\ntablet. I'm just talking about a piece of stone or a\nposter that says thou shalt not kill, thou shalt not\ncovet, thou shalt not bear false witness, et cetera.\nWould there be any Establishment Clause\nobjection simply because though it does not say so, those\nwere quotations from the last six commandments - last five commandments.\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: No, Your Honor. If all\nit said was thou shalt not kill and thou shalt not\nsteal, I don't think that that would be a problem\nbecause, of course, those are a reflection of law.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Who are you kidding? I\nmean, everybody knows that comes from the Ten\nCommandments. And what that message says is that\nthese commands that are engraved on the human heart\ncome from God. Why put it that way? You know,\ninstead of that, just quote the State statute against\nmurder. That's not what they're doing.\nThey're saying these basic principles of\nhuman behavior that we're governed by come from God.\nAnd that message would be conveyed so long as you use\nthe terminology of the Ten Commandments. That's what\nthe Ten Commandments stand for.\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: But Your Honor, this\nCourt has emphasized that content and context matter\nenormously. And what I'm trying to do is to\ndistinguish the situation where in Texas, it was\nclearly tablets with the words, I am the Lord, thy\nGod, with five commandments for religious behavior\nand five for secular behavior.\nFrom Justice Souter's question, there are\nfive others and especially those that are reflected\nin State law, like thou shalt not kill and thou shalt\nnot steal. I think that the message is different\nthere. It is the words, I am the Lord, thy God.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I think you're telling\nus that the State cannot accommodate religion. The only\nway they can do it is to put the Ten Commandments up\nand insist that it's always secular, whether it's\npredominantly for a secular purpose. It seems to me\nthat's hypocritical and it's asking religious people\nto surrender their beliefs and that is not\naccommodation.\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: No, Your Honor. I do\nthink that it degrades religion to have to have the\nTen Commandments defended for their secular purpose.\nI do think, though, that what's required of the\ngovernment, when it puts religious symbols on\ngovernment property, is to not be endorsing religion.\nThat's why a nativity scene by itself in the County\nof Allegheny case was unconstitutional.\nOn the other hand, that's why the nativity\nscene as part of a unified display in Lynch v.\nDonnelly was permissible. That's why, if the Ten\nCommandments are part of an overall display like this\nfrieze, it's permissible. If it's part of an overall\ndisplay about religious tolerance, and that's what\nthe reasonable observer would see, it is permissible.\nBut where it is the Ten Commandments\nthemselves, placed as they are here, then it really\nis about the government endorsing religion, then it\nis the purpose of advancing religion and then it does\nviolate the Establishment Clause.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So the word accommodate\nshould not be within our jurisprudence?\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: Accommodate should very\nmuch be in the jurisprudence. And any time there is\na Free Exercise Clause claim, then there has to be\ncareful attention to accommodating religion. But\nthere is no Free Exercise Clause claim in this case,\nYour Honor, so this isn't a case about accommodating\nanybody's religious beliefs. This is about the State\nexpressing support for religion with sacred and\nsolemn religious texts on government property. And\nmy position is --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Can the State express its\nsupport for religion generally?\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: Your Honor, it would\nall depend\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Suppose it didn't have\nthe Ten Commandments, it just had a big thing that\nsays religion is good. It said religion is the\nfoundation of our institutions. Suppose there were\nsomething like that. Would that be bad?\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: I don't think that would\nbe a problem under the Establishment Clause because\nit's minimal --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But there are atheists\nwho disagree with that intensely.\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: But Your Honor, I'm not\narguing for a heckler's veto by atheists. What I am\nsaying is that when the government puts sacred and\nsolemn texts taken directly from the Bible at the\ncore of its State government, it has to then do\nsomething to convey the message that it's not there\nfor religious purposes, that it's there for secular\npurposes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Doesn't it matter whether\nthat text has acquired an independent meaning of its\nown? As I say, I don't think most people know what\nthe text of the Ten Commandments are, but they do\nknow that it stands for the fact that our laws are\nderived from God. That's what it stands for. Why\nisn't that symbolism sufficient to enable the State\nof Texas to use it?\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: The Ten Commandments\nmonument by itself conveys the message that the Ten\nCommandments are the source of law and it's that\nmessage the State can't convey. May I save the rest\nof the time for rebuttal?\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, you may save your\ntime.\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: Thank you.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: General Abbott, we'll\nhear for you, please.\nORAL ARGUMENT BY GENERAL GREG ABBOTT\nON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS\nGEN. ABBOTT: Justice Stevens, and may it\nplease the Court:\nEvery court that has reviewed the specific\nfacts of this case has agreed that the Texas monument\nis constitutional under this Court's well settled\nprecedents in Lynch and Allegheny. This Court should\nagree that the Texas monument should not be torn down\nfrom its historical place for three reasons.\nFirst, the Ten Commandments is an\nhistorically recognized symbol of law. Second, this\nmonument is one of the smallest of the 17 monuments\non the Capitol grounds, and like most of the other\nmonuments, was a gift to the State of Texas and is\nclearly recognized as such on the monument itself.\nAnd third, this monument has stood for\nmore than 40 years without controversy on a national\nhistoric landmark. In fact, even the --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask you this\nquestion? Under your analysis of the reason this is\njustifiable, would it equally be permissible to have\na crucifix of the same size in the same location on\nthe Capitol grounds?\nGEN. ABBOTT: Justice Stevens, I think\nthat would pose a much greater problem.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: That's not my question.\nDo you think it would be permissible -- it seems to\nme your reasoning that you've given us would support\nthat result. And maybe that's the correct result.\nI'm wondering what your view is.\nGEN. ABBOTT: I seriously question whether\nor not a crucifix would be constitutionally\nacceptable in that same location, and for the very\nsame reasons which I'm articulating why the Ten\nCommandments would be acceptable in this location.\nThe crucifix is not like the Ten\nCommandments in that it's not an historically\nrecognized symbol of law. It doesn't send a secular\nmessage to all the people, regardless of whether or not they\nare believers or not believers of the important role\nthe Ten Commandments have played in the development\nof law.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's not a secular\nmessage. I mean, if you're watering it down to say\nthat the only reason it's okay is it sends nothing\nbut a secular message, I can't agree with you. I\nthink the message it sends is that law is -- and our\ninstitutions come from God.\nAnd if you don't think it conveys that\nmessage, I just think you're kidding yourself.\nGEN. ABBOTT: Well, Justice Scalia, the\nTen Commandments send both a religious message and a\nsecular message. When people --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: But the district court,\nI think in this very case, found that commemorating\nthe Ten Commandments' role in the development of\nsecular law was not one of the State's purposes in\naccepting the monument.\nNow, will you accept that finding as the\ncase comes to us? That hasn't been challenged. We\ndon't have any cross appeal. I assume we accept that\nfinding of the district court.\nGEN. ABBOTT: The Court obviously is\ncorrect to accept that finding. As you know, from\nthe district court's finding, the secular purpose\nthat was accepted by the district court was to honor\nthe Fraternal Order of Eagles. But also there was an\nongoing --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: But you're arguing for\nsomething contrary to the district court's finding.\nGEN. ABBOTT: I'm actually, Justice\nO'Connor, arguing for purposes that are in addition\nto that district court's finding because there was an\nongoing purpose to retain this now historical\nmonument that has stood for more than 40 years\nwithout controversy on a national and historic\nlandmark.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So in another case, if a\ngovernment official feels that the Ten Commandments\nhave been very, very important in his or her life as\na spiritual or religious matter and wants other\npeople to know how important the Ten Commandments\nare, he cannot accept on behalf of the city the Ten\nCommandments. And so you can have no Ten\nCommandments in city A, but the Ten Commandments in\ncity B. General, that doesn't make a lot of sense to\nme.\nAnd again, you're just doing with purpose\nwhat you did in response to Justice Scalia's\nquestion. You're asking us to ignore the religious\npurpose that is the most manifest value of these\nsymbols.\nGEN. ABBOTT: Well, with regard to both\npurpose and effect in this particular setting, I\ndon't think that religion was the driving force. I\nknow that all of the evidence shows that religion was\nnot a driving force in any respect.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: I suppose that every\nmonument that's on the State Capitol grounds in Texas\nin a sense conveys a message of State endorsement,\nState endorsement of the role of servicemen in\nfighting earlier wars or in support of the Boy Scouts\nor whatever it might be, doesn't it?\nI mean, by placing them there with the\nlegislative approval, is that not really some kind of\na message of endorsement for each one?\nGEN. ABBOTT: If I may clarify an\nimportant fact and that is clearly the State of\nTexas, by displaying 17 monuments in a museum-like\nsetting on the Capitol grounds, is trying to acknowledge\nand commemorate certain events.\nIt's important for the Court to remember,\nthough, that the State of Texas has specifically\nendorsed nine of those monuments by putting the State\nseal or the Lone Star seal for the State of Texas on\nthose nine monuments. This monument does not have\nthat kind of endorsement on there.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Isn't it all the case, as\nhas been pointed out, that no monument is going to be\non the grounds of the Texas State Capitol without the\napproval of the legislature? You don't dispute that,\ndo you?\nGEN. ABBOTT: Not at all. That is very\ntrue.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And you don't dispute\nthat anyone going on those grounds would assume that\nthe State government approved it or it wouldn't be\nthere?\nGEN. ABBOTT: Justice Souter, of course\nthe presumption would be that people on the Capitol\ngrounds would assume the State of Texas wanted those\nmonuments on the Capitol grounds.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I'm not sure that\nthat endorsement -- in England, there is a square\nwhere they have King Charles on one hand -- on one\nend and he's looking at Oliver Cromwell, who beheaded\nhim, on the other. I don't know if you have to\nendorse one or the other.\nGEN. ABBOTT: Well, Justice Kennedy, I\nbelieve that there is a very meaningful difference\nbetween this Court's standards of an endorsement and\nwhat a State or the nation may do with regard to\ncommemoration.\nAs an easy example, on the National Mall,\nthere is, of course, the Lincoln Memorial and in the\nLincoln Memorial, there is text from the King James\nversion of the Bible. The nation commemorates and\nacknowledges Lincoln and what he has said. But by\nthat display, the United States is not trying to\nendorse the King James version of the Bible or a\nparticular religious message in that. Instead what\nthe state\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But you have to contend\nwith the fact that the district court found that this\nsort of commemoration of the Commandments involved\nwas not the objective in placing the monument there,\nso you're left basically with a religious text.\nAnd if anybody has any doubt about that,\nthe religious text is surrounded by some religious\nsymbols, the Chi Rho, the Star of David. So it seems\nto me that it's hard to find, if we accept the\ndistrict court findings, that there's anything here\nbut an expression of approval by the State of Texas\nfor a religious expression, and only for the\nreligious expression.\nGEN. ABBOTT: Sir, all other factors, though,\nJustice Souter, as a person who stands in front of\nthat monument clearly recognizes, centered in a\nspecialized scroll is an indication that this was a\nmonument that was dedicated and presented to the\npeople and the youth of the State of Texas by the\nFraternal Order of Eagles. There is no stamp of\napproval on this by the State of Texas on that\nmonument.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But you're not trying to\nwithdraw the -- I took it to be the concession that\nof course anyone would reasonably assume that the\nState of Texas approved this message, and thought it\nwas appropriate to devote state property to its\npromulgation.\nGEN. ABBOTT: Clearly the State of Texas\napproved of the monument being on the grounds --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But then the fact that\nthe Eagles also approve it doesn't really get us very\nfar, does it?\nGEN. ABBOTT: Well, where I believe it\ngets you, as this Court has recognized, there is a\nvery meaningful difference between acknowledging\nsomething and endorsing something. For example, the\ncreche in Lynch or the menorah in Allegheny.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Let me ask you this. If\nthe Eagles' presentation statement weren't on there,\nwould that make a difference to Establishment Clause\nanalysis?\nGEN. ABBOTT: I think that the Eagles'\ndisclaimer on there helps our case, but if it were not\non there, I think the monument could still stand just\nas the creche did in Lynch or the menorah in\nAllegheny. The city of Pawtucket was not endorsing\nthe creche in the display, it was acknowledged as\npart of the overall holiday celebration.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: What is the -- that's one\nof the problems with the argument, it seems to me,\nthat by putting the Ten Commandments monument on\ngrounds that have lots of other monuments, that the\nreligious message is somehow either diluted or\nchanged. Contrast the situation in Texas with what\nwe've got here.\nYou've got Moses up there with at least\nthe last five commandments showing. But Moses is in\nthe company of a group of individuals who are nothing\nbut law givers. You've got Menes and Hammurabi and\nJohn Marshall and the rest of them. There is an\nobvious theme.\nAnybody who looks at the identity -- or\nknows the identity of these figures is saying they're\ngetting at law givers. But if you look at the\ngrounds of the Texas State Capitol, you see wars,\npioneer women, children and so on. There is no one\ncommon theme. The only theme seems to be these are\nobjects or symbols that are worthy of some kind of\nrespect.\nAnd one of them is religious. Being mixed\ninto a group that has no common theme does not\neliminate the religious -- the obvious religious\nmessage from this monument. Isn't that correct?\nGEN. ABBOTT: Well, just as this Court may\ndisplay in the courtroom itself, Moses with the Ten\nCommandments amongst law givers, doesn't mean that\nthat is the only way the Ten Commandments --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Maybe it doesn't, but I'm\ntrying to find a rationale for the argument that's\nbeing made, and that I thought you were alluding to.\nThe argument is that by mixing this in\nwith a grab bag of other symbols, you have somehow\ndiluted or changed the focus from a religious message\nto something else. And I can understand that in the\nMoses case in the frieze because there is a clear\ncommon theme.\nOn the Texas grounds, at least insofar as\nI can tell, there is no common theme. There are a\nseries of objects that say, these are worthy of\nveneration. One of them is religious. There is\nnothing that removes the religious message from its\nprominence in the display the way the religious\nmessage is removed from prominence in the Moses\ndisplay, isn't that correct?\nGEN. ABBOTT: Your Honor, if I may explain\nwith two points. One, there is a common theme on the\nTexas Capitol grounds, just as there are on most\nCapitol grounds and on the National Mall. And the\ncommon theme is to recognize historical influences in\nour country and in our State.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But what do you do with\nthe district court finding?\nGEN. ABBOTT: Well, the district court\nfinding obviously chose to decide that the secular\npurpose for the display was to honor the Fraternal\nOrder of Eagles for their commitment to combating\njuvenile delinquency.\nBut that is different -- the purpose why\nthe district court found why the display was\nconstitutional is different than the message that is\nbeing sent to the reasonable observer.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: You had a second point\nand I don't want to miss your second point.\nGEN. ABBOTT: The second point is that\nthere are other displays in this Court. As a person\nwalks into this courtroom or exits the courtroom,\nthey don't see the Ten Commandments in a display with\na bunch of law givers. Instead, they see the Ten\nCommandments alone with an eagle above it.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: They see blank tablets.\nThey don't see any writing. This is the only one\nthat has script on it. It has numbers and in fact\nthat's confusing because one of them, the people\nthink is the Ten Commandments is the Bill of Rights.\n(Laughter.)\nGEN. ABBOTT: Justice Ginsburg, clearly\nthe Ten Commandments that are reflected on the\ndoorway into and out of this courtroom don't have\nwords on them like the tablets do in the State of\nTexas.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But we know what they\nare, don't we?\nGEN. ABBOTT: We do and that's the point.\nEven more importantly, the reasonable observer knows\nwhat --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But do we know which\nversion of the Ten Commandments it stands for? There\nare three different versions at least.\nGEN. ABBOTT: I happen to agree with the\nPetitioner. There is more than three versions of the\nTen Commandments. And the purpose, if you go back to\nwhat the Eagles were trying to achieve here, was to\ncome up with a version of the Ten Commandments that\nwasn't reflective of any particular religion.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And it doesn't matter\nwhat the version is, does it? If it just stands for\nthe fact that laws -- the foundation of our laws is\nGod. If that's all it stands for, who cares what the\ntext is.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: General Abbott, would\nthe Texas purpose be equally served if the monument\nhad on it the kind of disclaimer that the city in\nWisconsin put on its monument?\nGEN. ABBOTT: Justice Stevens, I\napologize, I'm not familiar with that disclaimer.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: It reads this way. What\nthey did is they sold the parcel of land that had the\nEagles' donation on it back to the Eagles and then\nthey put a fence around it and then they put this\nsign up, \"This property is not owned or maintained by\nthe City of Lacrosse, nor does the City endorse the\nreligious expression thereon.\" Maybe as long as it's\nstill on the property, it couldn't be the same.\nBut suppose you had a comparable\ndisclaimer. Would that defeat any of the purposes on\nwhich you relied to justify having the statue there?\nGEN. ABBOTT: A disclaimer like that would\nsurely ensure that this display is constitutional.\nHowever, it's our contention --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And would it undermine\nthe message that you legitimately seek to convey?\nGEN. ABBOTT: I don't believe it would.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, why don't you do it and\nwe wouldn't have this case? I really would consider\nit something of a Pyrrhic victory if you win on the\nground that you're arguing. So that in all future\ncases, we're going to have to examine displays of the\nTen Commandments to see whether there was ever any\nintent to say that our laws are ultimately dependent\nupon God. Is that what you want us to do case by\ncase?\nGEN. ABBOTT: Well, this Court obviously\nhas decided Establishment Clause cases on a\ncase-by-case basis, but in this particular instance,\nthe Ten Commandments displayed in a museum-like\nsetting on the Capitol grounds arrayed among 17 other\nmonuments, the message that is received by the viewer\nwho is trekking through the Capitol grounds looking\nat monuments is clearly one not of the State of\nTexas.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I've got to get one\nquestion before you leave because you're the one who\nknows the record. And what I've had a hard time\nfinding in the record is what I think there must be\nsome material that the State or somebody in a tourist\noffice or a guide or somebody tells people what the\n17 different monuments are.\nAnd all I've found is the general brochure\nwhich doesn't tell them what they are. And I found\nsomething on the Internet. Well, which is in the\nrecord. But aside from this page from the Internet\nin the record and that, is there anything else in\nthis record that if somebody wanders around, they're\non the State grounds, they say, what is this, what\nare these things anyway? There must be something that\ntells them. And where is it?\nGEN. ABBOTT: The state provides a walking\ntour guide.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And the brochure doesn't\ntell what they are. This thing, it says grounds?\nGEN. ABBOTT: Your Honor, Justice Breyer,\nif I could refer you to page 205 of the Joint\nAppendix, it provides a description of each of the\nmonuments on the walking tour. And if I could also\nrefer the Court to page 117 of the Joint Appendix, it\nshows the actual walking tour where a person would go\nalong the process of seeing the monuments.\nBut clearly as they walk through the\nCapitol grounds, what any observer, not just the\nreasonable observer, what any observer would notice\nis that before they could even get to this particular\nmonument, they will have passed in full view of\ncountless other monuments and historical markers\nclearly indicating to them that they are not there\nfor the purpose of seeing just the Ten Commandments\nbut they are in a museum-like setting cast among many\ndifferent kinds of monuments.\nAnd so they appreciate the setting before\nthey even arrive at the Ten Commandments monument.\nAlso when they arrive at the Ten\nCommandments monument, they will notice it is one of\nthe smallest of the monuments on the Texas Capitol\ngrounds. It does have the disclaimer on it\nindicating that it was donated by the Fraternal Order\nof Eagles. It does not have the State seal on it\nlike many of the other monuments, so it's not --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Is it like how many\nother monuments? This is not peculiar to Texas. The\nOrder of the Eagles have given how many monuments\njust like this one, identical to this one?\nGEN. ABBOTT: Justice Ginsburg, it is\nactually not clear from the record. There have been\nsome accounts of hundreds, maybe even into the\nthousands that the Fraternal Order of Eagles have\ngiven out. And I cannot tell you for a fact that\nthey are all identical.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: When you said that\nevery court that has considered this case has said\nit's compatible with the Establishment Clause, did\nyou mean just this Texas case or other cases\ninvolving an Eagles Ten Commandments?\nGEN. ABBOTT: Justice Ginsburg, my\nreference was to the fact that every case that has\nconsidered the specific -- every court that has\nconsidered the specific facts of this case, meaning\nthe Texas case --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So you didn't mean this\nparticular depiction of the Ten Commandments?\nGEN. ABBOTT: No, Your Honor. What I\nmeant is that both the district court and the Fifth\nCircuit Court of Appeals specifically reviewed the\nfacts of this case and were all in complete agreement\nthat the facts of this case render this monument\nconstitutional under this Court's well settled\nprecedents in Lynch and Allegheny.\nOne other thing I would like to draw the\nCourt's attention to that will give you a very well\nunderstanding of what the monument looks like and its\nsetting is the videotape that is Exhibit 44, it's\nobviously not part of the Joint Appendix, but it\ndemonstrates how this particular monument is set in a\nmuseum-like setting amongst many other monuments and\ngives you the perspective of what the typical viewer\nwould appreciate as they walk around the Capitol\ngrounds.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Kind of an eclectic\nmuseum. One message that you get is that the State\nis honoring the donor of the various --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: General Abbott, I want\nto thank you for your argument and also for\ndemonstrating that it's not necessary to stand at the\nlectern in order to a fine job. Thank you.\nGEN. ABBOTT: Thank you, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Clement.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES\nAS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING RESPONDENTS\nMR. CLEMENT: Justice Stevens, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe Ten Commandments have undeniable\nreligious significance, but they also have secular\nsignificance as a code of law and as a\nwell-recognized historical symbol of the law. When a\nState decides to display a Ten Commandments display\nalong with more than a dozen other monuments on its\nCapitol grounds in order to honor the donor, it is\nnot endorsing the religious text of the Ten\nCommandments.\nAnd in the same way, when a state has that\nmonument as part of such a collection, the\nEstablishment Clause should not be interpreted to\nforce them to send a message of hostility to religion\nby singling out that one monument for removal solely\nbecause of its religious content.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Clement, can I ask you to address\none thing that troubles me about the case? As I\nunderstand it, it's the Protestant version basically\nof the Ten Commandments we have before us, which has\nsignificant differences from the Catholic version and\nthe Jewish version.\nAnd I understand it was the result of\nconsultation and so forth. But I noticed in your\nbrief, you list the States in which the Ten\nCommandments displays are listed, there is none for\nRhode Island, which I often think of as primarily a\nCatholic state, and the only one from Massachusetts\nis a frieze on the north wall of the public library\nwhich apparently didn't have the text of the\ncommandments in it.\nIs there any significance to the fact that\nthis kind of display may be more popular in areas of\nthe country where the Protestant religion is dominant\nas opposed to other versions of Christian religions?\nMR. CLEMENT: Justice Stevens, I don't\nthink so. I mean, we didn't purport to do an\nexhaustive survey, but I think there is a\nwell-represented group of displays throughout the\ncountry including, I think, in States that probably\nhave relatively high Catholic populations.\nBut I think we would steer this Court away\nfrom attributing too much significance to the fact\nthat if a State is going to display the Ten\nCommandments at all, it will necessarily have to\ndisplay a version that reflects one or another sect's\npreferences.\nI mean, in the Marsh case, for example, this Court\nupheld legislative prayer. It understood that they\nwould necessarily have to choose a chaplain and that\nchaplain would necessarily be of one denomination or\nanother. And this Court didn't doom the whole\npractice of legislative prayer because of the\nnecessity of picking a chaplain of one denomination\nor another.\nIn fact, in the Marsh case itself, this\ncourt upheld Nebraska's practice, even though they\nhad chosen the same Presbyterian minister for 16\nstraight years. And so I don't think this Court in\nother Establishment Clause contexts has steered away\nfrom putting the States and municipalities in a\ncatch-22.\nAnd given that this Court has suggested\neven in Stone against Graham that the Ten\nCommandments can be displayed, can be used in certain\nsettings, it can't be that once the State in practice\npicks a particular version, it's all of a sudden\nguilty of a sectarian preference.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Of course, the other\nthing that was notable about your listing is most of\nthe examples are examples of displays of the event\nitself rather than the text. And there is an\nargument made I think by Professor Laycock that when\nyou display the entire text, it's kind of a different\nsort of symbol than when you just have a symbolic\npresentation.\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, Justice Stevens, I\nthink there are quite a few of both types of displays and\nI think the very fact that the Fraternal Order of Eagles\nput a lot of these displays out suggests that a bunch of\nthem are textual displays.\nI'm not sure, though, that a display that\nactually has Moses receiving the Ten Commandments\nfrom God is any less religious. I would suggest\nthat's actually more religious than one that just\ndisplays the monument standing alone.\nIf the monuments are standing alone, you\ncan I think appreciate the fact that maybe they're\nbeing displayed for their secular significance as\nwell as their religious significance. When Moses is\nthere, it's hard to avoid the implication that they\nare the revealed law of God, as opposed to also a\nsecular code.\nSo in that sense, I'm not sure that the\nvariations in the display --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: You think just a symbolic\ndisplay is less objectionable than quoting the text as\nthis monument does?\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, Justice Stevens, I\nwould say -- my point is not that there are not other\nways to display it. I mean, certainly I think, as we point\nout in our brief, blank tablets or tablets with Roman\nnumerals are less objectionable -- certainly, I don't think\nthey're beyond objection -- than a textual display.\nMy point was that I'm not quite sure how\none would balance sort of four Commandments and Moses\nversus all Ten Commandments in text. I think it's a\nclose call.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, except the four\nCommandments and Moses would avoid the differences\nbetween the three different versions of the Ten\nCommandments, whereas when you quote one, you must\nselect one over the other two.\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, I guess I'm not sure\nthat's true. I mean, some of the displays that are\nout there in courthouses have Moses receiving the\nCommandments and have text. And I guess, my point,\nthough, would be, again --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Most of them don't.\nMR. CLEMENT: To be sure, to be sure. But\nI would hope the constitutional line wouldn't be that\nyou can't have text. I mean, the Ten Commandments\nhave a role in our society and had an influence on\nthe development of the law as text.\nI mean, you know, they weren't influential with ten\nRoman numbers. They were influential as text.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: General Clement, there\nis a question I have about the government's position.\nAnd does place matter at all? I mean, here we're\ntalking about the grounds surrounding a State\nCapitol. What about every school room, if that's the\nchoice of the school board? Is it the same or do you\nmake -- or every courtroom up to the court to decide\nfor itself?\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, Justice Ginsburg, I\ncertainly think location and context matters. I\nthink in almost every Establishment Clause context,\nthe setting and context matters a great deal. The\nschool case, for example, as you suggest, I mean,\nunless this Court is going to revisit Stone against\nGraham, it's certainly true that the school context\nat least raises much more difficult questions.\nIn terms of where it can be displayed in\na courthouse, I think there are certainly\npermissible displays in the courthouse, but it may be\nsomething all together different to have a display in\na way that it actually looks like a religious\nsanctuary within the walls of the courthouse.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: It looks just like this\nmonument. Let's take this monument and put it in the\nrotunda of the court because the judges of that court\nchoose to have it there. Is that all right?\nMR. CLEMENT: Justice Ginsburg, I think\nputting it in the rotunda of the court as a\nstand-alone monument, giving it sort of pride of\nplace, if you will, raises a much more difficult\nquestion, to be sure, and may well cross the\nconstitutional line.\nAs I was alluding to, the one case I'm\nfamiliar with, which is the case of the Alabama\nSupreme Court, there it was displayed in a way that\nthe district court literally found it was like a\nreligious sanctuary within the walls of the courthouse.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And do you think that it\nshould cross the constitutional line under the\ninterpretational theory of the First Amendment you\nwish us to adopt?\nMR. CLEMENT: I think the display that I\nhave in mind in the Alabama Supreme Court probably\ndoes cross the constitutional line even under our\nview. I think that a display of the Ten Commandments\nin some appropriate way in the courthouse certainly\nwouldn't cross the line that this Court -- that we\nwould have this Court draw.\nI mean, we think, for example, it cannot\nbe that the very fact that moving it closer to the\ncourthouse itself is a constitutional problem because\nas you yourself have pointed out, Justice Kennedy,\nthe legislative prayers that were approved in Marsh\nv. Chambers were at the absolute epicenter of the\ngovernment. And still those were a permissible\nacknowledgment of religion.\nSo I think while context matters, I don't\nthink solely the fact that it's moved closer to the\nseat of government does have a dispositive impact.\nAnd again, I would say in response to\nJustice Stevens' question, I do think it is important\nto remember that there is going to have to be a\nchoice among the various documents if they are going\nto be displayed at all. And I don't think that the\nConstitution puts the municipalities and the States\nin the bind of being able to display the Ten\nCommandments in theory, but in fact, not being able\nto pick any one version --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: What would your comment\nbe on requiring a disclaimer of some kind?\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, Justice Stevens, two\npoints to make about that. One is certainly a\ndisclaimer would make this an easier case. And I\nwould point out that there is a disclaimer of sorts\non the monument already because it clearly states\nthat it was a gift from the Fraternal Order of\nEagles.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: It is kind of ambiguous.\nMR. CLEMENT: It is, Justice Stevens, and\nI'm troubled frankly by the suggestion that they\nwould have to go as far as you suggested they would\ngo under the City of Lacrosse case. The idea that in\norder to have the Ten Commandments monument on the\nCapitol grounds, the State of Texas has to cordon\nthat monument off, unlike any other of the 17\nmonuments, suggests a hostility to religion.\nI think the idea that there has to be a\nfence away from the Ten Commandments to make clear\nthat the State has nothing to do with the Ten\nCommandments is bending over too far in the other\ndirection. The State can have, as this Court has\nacknowledged many times, permissible acknowledgments\nof religion. And I don't think in this case that the\nState of Texas has gone too far.\nOne other point I think that is important\nto put on the table, and it is consistent with the\nanalysis of both the district court and the Fifth\nCircuit, is that whatever the original purpose is for\nTexas accepting the monument and displaying it in the\nfirst instance, they now have an additional secular\npurpose in retaining the monument.\nAnd I would point this Court to Judge\nBecker's analysis in the Chester County case for the\nThird Circuit. In that case, he had a display that\nwas admittedly smaller, but it was actually a much\nmore overtly sectarian version of the Ten\nCommandments. It had the Ten Commandments plus the\nsummary of the Ten Commandments from the New\nTestament.\nAnd nonetheless, Judge Becker said that in\nthat case, the monument had been there since 1920 and\nChester County had a legitimate secular purpose in\nmaintaining that document and maintaining the plaque\non the courthouse.\nAnd I think he correctly understood that\nin these cases of displays that have stood for 40\nyears or longer, that the State is in something of a\ndilemma. Thank you, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Chemerinsky, you\nhave four minutes left.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ERWIN CHEMERINSKY\nON BEHALF OF PETITIONER\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: Thank you. This case\ncomes down to two questions. First, is the Ten\nCommandments a highly religious message. And second,\ncan the government place a single religious message\non government property at the seat of its government.\nAs to the first question, Stone v. Graham\nresolves this because this Court said that the Ten\nCommandments is an inherently religious message no\nmatter what disclaimer accompanies it.\nThe Ten Commandments is not on the Texas\nState Capitol grounds simply to recognize the role of\nreligion in government. It is not simply an\nacknowledgment. It is sacred text taken directly\nfrom the Bible. It's not there about the history of\nreligion in Texas. There is nothing that would tell the\nreasonable observer that it is there for historical\npurposes. It isn't there for history.\nWhat about all the other religions that\nhave played a role in Texas history? The Muhammad\nreligion, even Madeleine Murray O'Hare. Is Texas\nsaying they would accept statues for all of these\nindividuals there as part of the history of Texas?\nThe second question is, can the government\nplace a single religious message by itself on\ngovernment property, especially at the seat of\ngovernment. The County of Allegheny case resolves\nthat. This is much like the nativity scene at the\nseat of the county government.\nWhat's important and hasn't gotten enough\nemphasis this morning, this is the sole religious\nmessage anywhere on the Texas State Capitol grounds.\nThis isn't a museum. Every item that's there is\nthere because the Texas legislature chose to put it\nthere. Most of them honor veterans of particular\nwars. Texas put this there precisely to express the\nreligious message.\nYour Honors, what's left of the\nEstablishment Clause if any item can be displayed\nwith the most profound religious contents? Do we\nthen say the observer can just avert his or her eyes?\nThe observer could have averted his or her eyes in\nthe County of Allegheny case. But this Court was\nclear in saying that a single religious message, a\nsingle religious symbol on government property is\ninherently an establishment of religion.\nFor this reason, the Texas monument\nviolates the Establishment Clause. Thank you.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you,\n"
