Martin.\nMr. Marshall.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF TODD MARSHALL\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. MARSHALL: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nCharles Martin never adequately explained\nwhy he waited more than 5 years to present additional\nclaims to the California Supreme Court. As such, it was\nno surprise that these claims were rejected as untimely.\nCalifornia employs a habeas corpus timeliness rule that\nmerely requires reasonable diligence and disclosure.\nThe rule is adequate under this Court's longstanding\nprecedents, and the Ninth Circuit's decision to the\ncontrary should be reversed.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, what about the\ncharge that, yes, we can agree with you that in general\n5 years seems like a long time, but we have a brief from\nthe Habeas Corpus Resource Center that says that in the\n5- to 6-year delay category, 62 percent are dismissed on\nthe merits, and that you can't tell; sometimes they do\nit on the merits, sometimes they do it as time-barred,\nand there's no rationale to when they do one or the\nother.\nMR. MARSHALL: Three brief responses, Your\nHonor. The first is that to measure summary denials,\nyou can't tell from a summary denial ruling what the\ncourt was thinking about the time of delay.\nThe second point is that delay in California\nis only half the equation. In California, there is the\nsubstantial delay and then there's also the\njustification portion. So persons who operate under\nsubstantial delay still have an opportunity to justify\nthat delay and gain the desired review.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What was the third?\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Would they have to -\nwould they have to justify the delay first? I thought\nthere was something about, well, if the time question is\nmore difficult and the merits are easy, there's no\nmerit, so we just decide this.\nMR. MARSHALL: California's policy is to\ntake a first look at a habeas petition and determine\nwhether it is -- has a prima facie case or whether\nprocedural bars are apparent. A court that's denying a\ncase on the merits isn't necessarily saying the matter\nwas timely, and courts should be permitted to reach\nwhatever is the most judicially efficient method of\nresolving such a question without it being held against\nthem.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So basically you're\ntaking the position or you're conceding that the\nCalifornia courts are not consistent in their\napplication of the timeliness rule?\nMR. MARSHALL: No -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Your brief doesn't even\ntry to defend that position. Are you conceding that\nthere is inconsistent application of the rule?\nMR. MARSHALL: No, Your Honor.\nThe point that we're making is that when you\nlook at a rule, whether you apply it or not -- or\nwhether you impose it or not doesn't mean you're not\napplying the rule. For example, when trial courts\nreview matters under the Fourth Amendment, a decision\nnot to exclude the evidence doesn't mean they didn't\napply the Fourth Amendment.\nIn this case, if the trial court -- or if\nthe reviewing court looks at the length of delay, and\nthen they may look at the justification to determine\nthat the delay was justified.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well -- I might be\nspeaking for her, but I thought that the Habeas Corpus\nResource Center brief showed that the court, the\nCalifornia court, did reach some cases where an\nexplanation had not been proffered. And so it can't be\njust a simple rule, that if you don't proffer an\nexplanation, you won't get heard. So what's the next\nstep in that? Why do they reach some and not others?\nMR. MARSHALL: The California Supreme Court,\nif a case is patently meritless and perhaps the\nprocedural question of timeliness is more complex -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How could it be complex\nwhen there's no justification offered?\nMR. MARSHALL: The question of how long it\nwas -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, they pointed to a\ncertain number of cases that were 5 years or above in\ndelay where no justification was offered, and in some\nthey reached the merits and in others they applied a\nprocedural bar. So how is that consistent?\nMR. MARSHALL: Well, the State court has\ndiscretion to determine on the -- on procedural grounds\nor on the merits -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Is there some Federal rule\nthat says you have to apply a procedural ground before\nyou decide the merits?\nMR. MARSHALL: There is not. There's a -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So it's up to California\nwhich of the two it wants to use.\nMR. MARSHALL: That's correct.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And in California, if it\njust says \"denied,\" then the presumption is it's denied\non the merits; is that it?\nMR. MARSHALL: That's correct, a lack of a\nprima facie case.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And -- and if -- so if\nit's going to be denied on time bar grounds, there has\nto be something to indicate that it's for that reason?\nOtherwise we assume it's on the merits?\nMR. MARSHALL: That's correct. Typically,\nthe citation is to Clark and Robbins, just as it was in\nthis case.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So how do we know that\nthe California court just thinks that the Federal\nquestion is too hard and it doesn't want to reach it?\nIt may be meritorious. How do we know they're not\napplying the decision to reach the merits on an\narbitrary and capricious basis or one that seeks to\navoid hard Federal questions?\nMR. MARSHALL: First is this Court has never\ntaken the position, when measuring adequacy, of assuming\nthat the rule is inadequate. The starting position that\nthis Court has always taken when looking at the adequacy\nof a State rule is to look for evidence to see that -\nif it can be shown to be inadequate. And I posit that\nthere's no evidence in this case that has been presented\nto show that the State court is using their rules as a\npretext of any kind.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Is it arbitrary and\ncapricious for a court to take the ground of least\nresistance, to decide the case on the easiest issue\nthat's presented? Is that arbitrary and capricious?\nMR. MARSHALL: I posit that it's not. This\nCourt endorsed in Lambrix that it's all right for courts\nto address procedural default after Teague if that's a\nmore judicially efficient method of handling the matter.\nStrickland cases permit addressing either prong,\nwhichever is easier under the circumstances.\nAnd so the State courts ought to be\npermitted to address habeas corpuses on whatever the\neasiest, most judicially efficient basis is without\nbeing forced to answer a timeliness question if a case\nis patently meritless. And there should be no finding\nof inconsistency about that.\nAnd, more importantly, summary denials, as\nwe're discussing here, don't afford any notice to\nlitigants of what the State's procedures are or what\nthey're thin king, because you have to guess. You have\nto guess at how long the delay was, you have to guess at\nwhether there was any justification offered. So summary\ndenials do not assist the inquiry. And this Court has\nnever endorsed using summary denials in its adequacy\nmeasure. This Court has always looked to published\nState cases that explicate the rule.\nThis Court is looking to see whether the\nrule has been pronounced by the State for a certain\namount of time, and then all of a sudden the litigant\nthat's receiving the imposition of the rule receives a\nrule that was unexpected, either because the rule was\nchanged or because the rule was novel. Nothing like\nthat has happened here.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: The phrase is \"substantial\ndelay.\" Are there factors other than temporal factors\nthat go into whether or not the delay is substantial;\nthat is to say, the prisoner had difficulty contacting\nhis counsel and so forth? Is that what the court looks\nat -\nMR. MARSHALL: Those are -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- when it looks at\n\"substantial\"? And is there -- are there California\ncases that tell us what the -- how do we define\n\"substantial\"?\nMR. MARSHALL: Yes, Your Honor, to both.\nThe kind of circumstances you're describing\nare exactly the kind of circumstances which makes\nCalifornia's rule fair, because it considers how long it\ntakes a litigant to find his claim, get it prepared, and\nget it into court.\nAnd there are, in fact, concrete examples.\nThe Robbins case specifically provided that a 5-month\nwindow from the discovery of triggering facts to the\npresentation of the -- of the claim was a reasonable\namount of time. By contrast, the Stankewitz case\nprovided that 18 months of delay from the discovery of a\ndeclaration was substantial and had to be justified.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: When does the State think\nthat Mr. Martin's claim became untimely?\nMR. MARSHALL: Certainly he hasn't given any\nreason why he didn't present his additional claims at\nthe time of his earlier habeas corpus challenges.\nMr. Martin went through a full round of superior court,\ncourt of appeal, and supreme court challenges, and then\nwaited some additional years and has never explained why\nhe didn't include these additional claims in those\nearlier challenges.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: So you think it -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: It's supposed to be filed\nwithin 60 days. I don't -- this is along the same lines\nas Justice Kagan's question. Suppose there's the first\nround of habeas, and then he waits 60 days and files the\nnew claim. Would that be substantial?\nBecause you're indicating that failure to\ninclude it in the first review is a factor to be weighed\nagainst him. And I think that's what the Justice is\ninquiring about.\nMR. MARSHALL: Yes, it does -- it does weigh\nagainst. And it's a rule of reasonableness, and it's a\ndiscretion-based rule. And he would have to offer,\nwell, why didn't he include those claims earlier? And\nif he had a good -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, and what -- isn't that\na separate rule? I mean, no matter how soon, if he does\nit a week after, doesn't California have a rule that you\ncan't come back with another habeas with material that\nyou could have produced in the -- in the former habeas?\nMR. MARSHALL: That's correct, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So time -- time has nothing\nto do with that. It's just a separate -- a separate\nbar.\nMR. MARSHALL: California has articulated\nthat successive petitions are a type of delayed\npetition. But you're right, there is a difference in\nCalifornia between successive petitions and delayed\npetitions, and the ruling here is that he was delayed\nsubstantially.\nI was just addressing the point about when\nthey might have been timely had they been presented\nearlier, and it appears that in the earlier -- he didn't\nget a timeliness ruling in his earlier challenges. So\nit appears that he could have raised them then and did\nnot.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: But if we can take out the\nsecond and successive aspect of this and just focus on\nthe timeliness, when does the State think that this -\nthat these claims were -- became untimely?\nMR. MARSHALL: It's a rule of reasonableness\nand diligence that's circumstantially based, and -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Well, you have the\ncircumstances here, so -- so under those circumstances,\nwhen did the claims become untimely?\nMR. MARSHALL: In the Robbins case, it\nexplains that you have -- a 5-month span from discovery\nof the claims to presentation of the claims would be\nreasonable.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The claims here -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: The 5 months would be\nreasonable. So is a year unreasonable? Is 5 months the\nouter bounds, you know, assuming you don't have a good\nreason? I understand that if you have a good reason,\nthat can lengthen it. But suppose you don't have a good\nreason. When does the State think, okay, that's too\nlate?\nMR. MARSHALL: There isn't -- there isn't a\ndefined time line. But our position is that a defined\ntime line is not a necessity for adequacy. This Court\nhas endorsed reasons of -- rules of reasonableness and\ndiligence. For example, in the Federal prisoner context\nin Johnson v. United States, this Court said diligence\nin discovery, while it isn't exact, is good enough.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Well, I'm -- I'm trying to\nget to even around, not -- not exact. My standard is\nnot exact. It's just around. Around what? Around 6\nmonths, around 3 years, around someplace in the middle?\nMR. MARSHALL: The position of the State is\nthat Robbins has indicated that 5 months is reasonable,\n18 months is definitely too long, and that there is a\ndiscretion-based determination in the middle.\nJUSTICE ALITO: What if it's filed within 6\nmonths and it's -- it's rejected as untimely, and the\npetitioner wants to try to demonstrate that this\nrepresents a grave departure from the way these are\nnormally handled by the California Supreme Court? Is\nthere any way for the petitioner to do that?\nMR. MARSHALL: He would point to the\npublished authority and argue that his case was outside\nof the parameters of what the State had done in the\npast. However, our position is that, since California's\nruling is adequate, that there would be no evidence of\nsuch available to this particular litigant. A\nhypothetical litigant might be able to proffer that\nprior cases had treated claims differently.\nAnd the other problem with California is\nthat it would require two exact same litigants, and it's\nvery rare for two exact same litigants to have the exact\nsame claims, the exact same bases for their delay, filed\nin exactly the same amount of delay. So true comparison\nis difficult.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You think 5 years is too\nlong, though?\nMR. MARSHALL: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: There -- this was taken\nover by California from capital cases, but in the\ncapital case context, there -- they have a 90-day\npresumption of timeliness. And when they extended the\ncapital framework to non-capital cases, they left out\nthe presumption that within 90 days is timely. Was\nthere reason for that?\nMR. MARSHALL: Respectfully, I must\ndisagree. It actually is the other way around. The\ncapital case policies took the timeliness rule -- took\nthe general timeliness rule for themselves and added the\npresumption.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Was there reason for and\nthen saying, well, in the capital context, we're going\nto make it clear that 90 days -- 90 days is timely. Why\ndidn't they add that to the original rule?\nMR. MARSHALL: To the other litigant rule?\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes.\nMR. MARSHALL: They, I think, felt that the\nrule was adequate the way it was, that a\ncircumstantially based rule, a reasonableness-based\nrule, was sufficient to guide the conduct of litigants\nto tell them what they needed to do to present their\ncase.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, why would it be\ndifferent in the capital context? What was the reason\nfor adding the 90 days there?\nMR. MARSHALL: Capital cases are\nsignificantly more complex, the punishments are -- are\nmore significant, and so additional scrutiny might be\nwarranted in those contexts.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm -- I'm a little bit\nconfused by your response to Justice Scalia. I thought\nfrom your brief that you were positing that there was no\nclaim of inconsistent application of a rule that could\never survive.\nLet's assume for the sake of argument the\nfollowing hypothetical, and probably not far off the\nmark. Litigants who don't know the law, who claim\nthey're not educated in it, say that they have just\nlearned about a new California case that gives them a\nground to challenge their prior sentence. And the\nlitigants learn about the case anywhere between 3 and 6\nmonths of the issuance of the case by the supreme court.\nA dozen litigants apply for this discretionary review,\nand half of them are granted review and half are not.\nHalf of them get a correction of the sentence and half\nof them don't. There is no difference between them\nthat's discernible. They each just claim ignorance.\nIs that a case where someone would be out of\nluck, and why, for a claim of inconsistent application?\nMR. MARSHALL: I didn't follow the\nhypothetical. Was -- were some of the hypothetical\nindividuals getting time-barred?\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Getting time-barred.\nSome are time-barred; some -\nMR. MARSHALL: And some of the individuals\nwere getting relief?\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Exactly.\nMR. MARSHALL: And is there yet a third set\nof people who are getting -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No. Some -- all of them\nare within that small framework of 3 to 6 months from\nthe time the supreme court decision was issued. They\nall claimed they just learned of it and filed\nimmediately, and some are getting relief and some are\nnot.\nIs that an inconsistent application that\nwould be cognizable under your view of the rule as it\nshould be?\nMR. MARSHALL: That sounds inconsistent to\nme, Your Honor. However -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It does. So the\nquestion -\nMR. MARSHALL: But such a thing would not\noccur in California.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sorry. What?\nMR. MARSHALL: Such a thing would not occur\nin California.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, that's the issue.\nMR. MARSHALL: A meritorious -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Which is: What rule do\nyou want us to impose and how does that rule capture\nthat case?\nMR. MARSHALL: There's a specific exception\nfor timeliness in California to preclude fundamental\nmiscarriages of justice. And anybody that had a\nmeritorious United States -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You're not answering my\nquestion.\nMR. MARSHALL: I misunderstood it.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Wait. No. Why do you\nconcede that it would be bad? Can't the State, if it\nwishes, give grace to people who did apply late, but\nbecause the case is so meritorious or for any other\nreason? The issue is whether those people who filed 5\nyears later and knew that it was very late, whether\nthey're entitled to have their cases heard, not whether\nthe -- the State allows somebody who filed 6 years\nearlier to have it heard. How does that do any\ninjustice to the person who knew that 5 years was, you\nknow, you're likely to be denied?\nMR. MARSHALL: I absolutely agree, Your\nHonor. The basis for my earlier comments was the -- I\nbelieve the hypothetical was 3 to 6 months, which was a\nmuch shorter period of time.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't see why the State\nhas to be consistent in it. If -- as a matter of grace,\nit can -- it can allow some people, so long as the\npeople who are denied had every reason to believe that\nthey were coming in too late, and 5 years is coming in\ntoo late.\nMR. MARSHALL: Just as occurred in this\ncase, I absolutely agree, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But it doesn't answer\nwhy inconsistent application among similarly situated\nindividuals should not provide an avenue of relief.\nMR. MARSHALL: This Court has never\nreversed -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Five years is different.\nI'm talking about treatment of similarly situated\nindividuals differently.\nMR. MARSHALL: First, this Court has only\nlooked at the treatment of this individual, not\ndisparate treatment of prior individuals. The -- the\nrule exists for -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Oh, I don't disagree\nwith you. So that the question I have for your\nadversary is whether or not he can point to any case\nwhere a litigant who proffered an -- something that was\nevident on the trial record and on the appellate record\nwas ever granted a merits review after 5 years. Because\nI don't see them proffering any case that shows that.\nBut -- and I think that may be your argument.\nMR. MARSHALL: Yes, exactly. That no one -\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, I -- I'm not -- I\ndon't understand your answer, then. You have -- let me\njust adapt what Justice Sotomayor said. You have -- a\ncase, a Supreme Court case is decided. And you have\n10 -- 10 habeas petitioners in California who file on\nexactly the same day. And five of them, if you were to\nget to the merits of their claim under this new decision\nof this Court, five of them would be entitled to relief,\nfive of them would not be entitled to relief on the\nmerits. And the California Supreme Court holds that the\nfive who would be entitled to relief are procedurally\nbarred and the five who were not entitled to relief on\nthe merits are not, and they are rejected on the merits.\nNow, would that be an adequate State ground?\nMR. MARSHALL: Well, I'm not sure. It\ndoesn't happen in California that way.\nJUSTICE ALITO: No, I know -\nMR. MARSHALL: All right. I'm sorry.\nJUSTICE ALITO: -- and I'm not suggesting\nthat it would. But if it were to happen, would that be\nadequate?\nMR. MARSHALL: It doesn't sound like it\nwould be adequate under this Court's prior tests.\nJUSTICE ALITO: So fair notice is not the\nonly requirement.\nMR. MARSHALL: This Court has also required\nlegitimate State interests, and this Court has used the\nlegitimate State interests context, like, for example,\nin Smith v. Texas, where this Court has declared a\nparticular kind of violation was a constitutional\nviolation and the Court exercised its discretion not to\nreach the violation, this Court found that the State had\nno legitimate State interest in such a ruling.\nOur point is that -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But -- but the cases that\nyou're using in which we insisted upon adequacy in the\nsense of equal treatment of equal people are cases in\nwhich the effect of the State decision was to exclude\nthe matter from Federal -- from Federal supervision.\nThe matter could not come before the Federal courts.\nMR. MARSHALL: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: This is something quite\ndifferent. This is applying a time limit. I don't see\nwhy we have to apply the same rule and -- and look into\nthe -- whether it's not discretionary. I mean, to say\nit's discretionary always means that sometimes similar\ncases may be treated differently.\nMR. MARSHALL: Yes, Your Honor, exactly.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So I don't know why you -\nyou concede that -- that we take an adequacy rule that's\nused for one purpose and should apply it to a totally\ndifferent situation.\nMR. MARSHALL: It was the meritorious nature\nof the claims. And in California, meritorious claims\ndon't receive the time bar because there's exceptions\nthat take those into consideration.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But none of this is -- is a\ndevice as is used in the cases that -- that you are\nreferring to that go into adequacy, a device to exclude\nthe Federal courts from the case. That's -- that's not\nwhat's going on here, is it?\nMR. MARSHALL: That's correct.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I guess if the situation\nwere such that a lawyer who is representing a client and\nhas to figure out has there been too much delay or not,\nsuppose he looked into the situation thoroughly and he\nsaid, gee, I just have no idea, because half the cases\ncome out one way and half of them come out the other\nway. Could he then go to the California Supreme Court\nand say, Court, look what you have been doing? And\nwould the court then grant a hearing on that and\npossibly correct it?\nMR. MARSHALL: Well, in California, there's\nno such evidence, but I suppose that the lawyer could -\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. So you're\nsaying there is no such evidence.\nMR. MARSHALL: That's correct. In fact -\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's what I suspected\nreading this. But if there were such evidence is there\na route in California that they could deal with it?\nMR. MARSHALL: Certainly.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But that's not a question\nof adequacy, is it? It's a question of notice.\nMR. MARSHALL: That's correct, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Adequacy of notice, because\nno notice might be an inadequate notice.\nMR. MARSHALL: That's correct.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And if it's absolutely\ndivided 50/50, you have no notice. You don't know what\nwill happen. And it isn't a rule to say, oh, this is\nour rule, you don't know what will happen.\nMR. MARSHALL: Within an area of discretion,\nlike, for example, the finding of whether a piece of\nevidence was hearsay, if the court down the hall finds\nthe evidence should be excluded and the court in the\nnext room says it should be admissible, that isn't\nnecessarily an abuse of -\nJUSTICE BREYER: I agree with you, we are in\nhypothetical, never-never land so far. But it's\npossible your opponents will convince us it's real land\nand not never-never land.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And for it to be\nreal -- just so I understand -- for it to be real, you\nhave to have a defense counsel, a client comes to him\nwith a non-frivolous Federal habeas claim, and the\ndefense counsel says, I can't tell whether we're going\nto be barred by this time rule or not. Some courts,\nlooks like we will; some don't. So -- what?\nOf course he's going to file the Federal\nhabeas and see if it's determined to be adequate or\ninadequate, correct?\nMR. MARSHALL: California's rule is\nperfectly suited to such a scenario. All that litigant\nhas to do is explain why they didn't bring the claim\nsooner, either from late discovery or some other\nimpediment, and the substantial delay can be justified\nwith exactly those sorts of circumstances.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: What happens if a -- a\nperson in this position is trying to investigate\nmultiple claims at once, and some of them are ready to\nbe put before the court and others are not? How does he\nknow, look, I really better get in there right now and\nput whatever I have before the court? Or, look, I have\na little bit more time in order to investigate some of\nmy claims further? How does he make that determination?\nMR. MARSHALL: The Gallego case specifically\nspeaks to that exact circumstance and provides that if\nyou have a good faith basis in investigating further\ntriggering facts, you may withhold the claims that\nyou've already presented -- or prepared, to prevent\npiecemeal presentation. And that's a perfectly\nacceptable explanation in California.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Why is it, Mr. Marshall,\nthat the -- the California courts have not been a little\nbit more transparent about what the presumptive time\nlimits are? You know, look, it's around a year unless\nhave you a good reason. You know, at least we're taking\n3 years off the table.\nI mean, why don't we have decisions like\nthat from the California courts that would -- would help\nfolks here?\nMR. MARSHALL: Well, other than the Robbins\ndecision, which speaks of 5 months as being reasonable,\nthe court has tried to maintain a discretion-based,\ncircumstantially driven analysis in which they take\ndifferent litigants into consideration. One litigant\nmay be in a maximum security prison and only gets to go\nto the library once a month. Another litigant may be in\na minimum security prison; he can go to the library\nevery day. Those two litigants are going to be\ndifferent and should be treated differently.\nAnd if I might reserve the remainder of my\ntime.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Bigelow.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL B. BIGELOW\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. BIGELOW: Mr. Chief Justice, and if it\nplease the Court:\nThe adequacy inquiry is framed by asking\nwhether the State rule in question is firmly established\nand regularly followed. At its core is the prevention\nof State courts from declining to enforce Federal rights\nand to maintain Federal authority over the protection of\nconstitutional rights in the Supremacy Clause. In its\nbrief at page 7, the State would seem to agree that a\nrule is inadequate unless earlier decisions of the State\ncourt are at least consistent.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, but what did you\npresent below, or what has Habeas Corpus Resource Center\npresented? A case with a 5-year delay where the claimed\nerrors are apparent on the trial record and the\nappellate record, and no justification for the delay is\nproffered. Those are the three seminal facts that go to\nthe requirements of Robbins and the other supreme\ncourt -- other California Supreme Court cases.\nDo you have one case that's similar where\nthe court went to the merits?\nMR. BIGELOW: Sanders was a 5-year case\nthat's cited in my brief. Jones was -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No. Was that someone\nwho made a claim based on the trial and appellate record\nwith no justification?\nMR. BIGELOW: I'll speak to justification in\njust a moment, if I may.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Uh-huh.\nMR. BIGELOW: And Jones was an 8-year case.\nThe amicus brief, the Resource Center, cited Cooper,\nDuke, and Hardiman. Cooper was a 5-year case. Those\nwere both IAC claims which appear to -- with respect to\nthe Sanders and the Jones case, I cannot -- I do not\nknow specifically what the claim was as I stand here,\nand I apologize for that. But let us look at\njustification for just a moment. The justification\noffered in those cases was that the habeas petitioner\nwas ignorant and had no counsel. Now, I will represent\nto you that, in the State of California, 99.9 percent of\nthe lawyers -- the lawyers -- 99 percent of the\npetitioners who file aren't represented by counsel and\naren't lawyers themselves, and I will represent further\nthat probably 98 percent, 99 percent have no more than a\n12th grade education.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: These cases that you cite,\nbefore you go any further -- are they cases in which the\nCalifornia Supreme Court came out with an opinion saying\nthat 6 years was okay? Or are they just cases where,\nwithout an opinion, the California Supreme Court went to\nthe merits?\nMR. BIGELOW: They are -- well, in the\nSanders case and in the Jones case, there were -- I\nbelieve that they were decisions in -- they were\ndecisions. These cases predated the Clark/Robbins\nsituation. In the Cooper case and the Duke case, those\ncases -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What -- what do you mean\nthey were decisions, written opinions or just went to\nthe merits and decided the merits? Did they say\nanything about the delay question?\nMR. BIGELOW: They did say something about\nthe delay question in at least two of the cases, well,\nat least in one of the cases, the Mitchell case, which\nwas a 2-year delay. They said 2 years is unreasonable,\nbut I didn't cite those. And I cannot speak to -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But the other side says\nthat, unless there is an opinion, the reason they may\nhave gone to the merits is it was just a lot easier.\nMR. BIGELOW: No -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: They didn't have to worry\nabout it.\nMR. BIGELOW: To that extent, it -- it's my\nrecollection they went to the merits. They're not\nsilent denials, and they don't cite Clark/Robbins\nbecause they predated Clark/Robbins. With respect to\nthe Cooper case and Duke case, those I believe were\nsilent denials. Now -- and that's the interesting thing\nabout California. We are presuming -- we are presuming\nand this Court has reached that presumption -- that they\nare merit denials when they are silent, but we really\ndon't know -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, that's a puzzle to\nme. I mean, Justice Scalia's question was courts all\nthe time -- they -- you used see all the time they don't\ndecide an issue of whether it's filed too late because\nit's the simplest thing just to decide the merits. It's\nthe same result. And sometimes they don't do that. But\nthat happens often in a district court on appeal and\ntriple in a supreme court which has hundreds or\nthousands of questions for review. So how do we know\nthat that simple practice, which I've never heard of as\nattacked as unconstitutional -- how do we know that that\nisn't what's going on?\nMR. BIGELOW: Well, in -- in any given year\nrecently, in recent history at least, there are about\n800 truly silent denials, no explanation. Now, the\nState says we can't consider them because they mean\nnothing. From our perspective, they have to mean\nsomething, and they have to count because we don't have\nthe information that the litigant in this matter is -\ndoesn't have the same kind of resources, for example,\nthat the State does.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right, but that's -\nthey -- what's your point? Eight hundred are silent.\nWhat does that show?\nMR. BIGELOW: That they have got to count in\nthe adequacy -- in the consistency application, they've\ngot to count against the Petitioner.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Why?\nMR. BIGELOW: Because the Petitioner is the\none who has the resources and has the opportunity -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, I mean, but then you\ncan make any claim against him. I mean, what I\nwonder -- maybe this is where I'm leading -- the\nCalifornia Supreme Court is not the only court in\nCalifornia where people file for habeas petitions, is\nit?\nMR. BIGELOW: No. The appellate court -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes. So why, if there's\ninconsistency in this rule, wouldn't somebody go look at\nthe decisions of the appellate courts which write their\nreasons down, and then you would know whether it is\nbeing decided -- applied inconsistently or not\ninconsistently. Why look at a blank wall? Why not look\nat people who write opinions? And then you'll find out.\nMR. BIGELOW: Not all -- not all habeas\npetitions in California are filed in lower courts.\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, of course not. But is\nyour claim -- are you conceding, or are you conceding,\nare you denying, are you just saying nothing about\nwhether the practice in this rule, applying the rule of\nsubstantial unexcused delay, disqualifies you for -\nthat's the rule, isn't it?\nMR. BIGELOW: That's the rule.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. Are you saying\nit is being applied consistently or inconsistently or\nyou do not know -\nMR. BIGELOW: It is being applied --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- in all courts below the\nCalifornia Supreme Court?\nMR. BIGELOW: In all courts below, I do not\nknow, but -\nJUSTICE BREYER: So you don't know. So what\nyou've come -- what you've done your research on are\nquestions that cannot be answered due to the fact that a\nsupreme court normally doesn't say why when it denies\nsomething, but you haven't looked into the research that\nis readily obtainable, which is these are courts that\nwrite opinions. Is that -- have I gotten that\ncorrectly?\nMR. BIGELOW: That's -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Because if that's\ncorrect -\nMR. BIGELOW: That would be a correct\nstatement.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. Then I don't\nsee why you didn't because it would be so easy, if\nyou're right, to show this from the lower courts, but of\ncourse if you're wrong, it wouldn't be easy, then a\nblank wall is better than nothing.\nNow, what can you say that will disabuse me\nof the notion that I just expressed?\nMR. BIGELOW: The -- the lower appellate\ncourts -- there are six -- there are six district -\ndistrict courts. There are six appellate districts, I\nguess, within the State -- within the State of\nCalifornia and who knows how many superior courts. For\na petitioner to examine the holdings, the rulings in\neach of those districts would be virtually impossible.\nThe only one -- for a petitioner who is in prison, who\nis unrepresented by counsel, and let's not forget that\nnon-capital habeas petitioners, and this is a\nnon-capital habeas petitioner, is not represented by\ncounsel.\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, no. But some are -\nthere's a thing called sampling techniques, and sampling\ntechniques are designed to limit the burden. I'm not\nsaying it wouldn't be burdensome, but you have examined\nthousands of cases. And so I'm back to my original\nquestion. And statisticians, many of whom would like to\nhelp you perhaps you could find some, could do this for\nyou, I think.\nMR. BIGELOW: Amicus did it with respect to\nthe California Supreme Court.\nJUSTICE BREYER: The wrong court. And\namicus did it from the time that -- that the case was\nfiled, while the rule is you start the period of running\nfrom the case it was reasonably -- the person should\nreasonably have known his issue, which isn't the same\ntime as the time his case was decided against him. So,\nyes.\nMR. BIGELOW: Well, that's an excellent\npoint the Court makes. And it is that -- nobody in this\nroom, nobody in this room can tell this -- this litigant\nwhen his petition was filed late.\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's true.\nMR. BIGELOW: And so -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but everybody\n-- everybody in this room can tell him that he is\nobligated to file the petition as promptly as the\ncircumstances allow. He has complete notice of that.\nAnd if he wants to go and do the research and say, well,\nhere's one where they let it in after 5 months, but\nhere's one where they didn't leave it in after 9 months,\nand he sits here and decides so I'm going to wait 9\nmonths and put my money on that court -- that -- that is\nnot a scenario that's likely to happen, right?\nMR. BIGELOW: That -- that -- it is not a\nscenario that is likely to happen, but the construct\nthat the Court has -- \"as promptly as circumstances\nwould allow\" shows up in a footnote in a capital case.\nIt -- that -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You're not\nchallenging that as the State rule, are you?\nMR. BIGELOW: That is the -- that's the\nState rule that they proffer.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right.\nMR. BIGELOW: That is the rule that the\nState proffers. And what I'm suggesting is that that\nrule is so vague and unknown, in the context at least of\nthe habeas litigation, no one understands what that rule\nmeans. How prompt is prompt?\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Well, Mr. Bigelow, is that\nright? I take your point that nobody can say exactly\nwhen Mr. Martin's claims became untimely, but 5 years is\nuntimely, isn't it?\nMR. BIGELOW: Five years is not untimely\nif -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: I mean, if there's a very\ngood reason, but 5 years without an explanation is -\nwhy is that a hard question?\nMR. BIGELOW: Even with an explanation, 5\nyears is not beyond the pale of cases that have been\npreviously decided and with respect to similarly\nsituated litigants. Other cases in California -- and\ndon't forget, please, that the -- the Habeas Corpus\nResearch Center took only a small sample of a single day\nand that was the day that Martin's decision came down.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And they didn't look\nat possible justifications at all, correct?\nMR. BIGELOW: There was no justification\nwith respect to Mr. Martin's petition, that's correct.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, no. I'm not\nasking about Mr. Martin's.\nMR. BIGELOW: Oh, I'm sorry.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: This -- the analysis\nthat the amicus undertook simply looked at the\nchronological time. They did not consider the fact\nthat, for example, somebody with 3 years might have had\nan explanation; somebody with 1 year might have not had\nany. And they may view those cases as different cases.\nMR. BIGELOW: I -- I would disagree. I\nthink that they did, in fact, look at explanations for\ndelay, and a curious thing that they did find, which is\nin their brief, is that even though -- cases which -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, how did they\nlook -- did they look for explanations for delay when\nyou had the one-sentence denial?\nMR. BIGELOW: I think the short answer to\nthat is yes, but they also looked at silent denials as\nwell. So they found that where there was no explanation\nfor delay, more of those cases were decided actually on\nthe merits than cases that did offer a delay. So\nthere's a -- a gross inconsistency, a gross\ninconsistency between the need for justification of\ndelay.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, your -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, how much range\nare you willing to give the State? Do they have 3\nmonths' range? I mean, if you come in and say, well,\nhere they were filed in 9 months and they were allowed,\nand here they were filed in 6 months and they weren't\nallowed.\nIs that a problem under our consistency\nrequirement?\nMR. BIGELOW: It wouldn't be a problem.\nThat would be a discretionary rule if there were\nguidelines; if there were guidelines -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, it says -\nMR. BIGELOW: -- some kind of guidelines -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It says \"as promptly\nas the circumstances allow.\" And then they go back and\nsay there is a 3-range, a 3-month range.\nMR. BIGELOW: Oh, if they went back, with\ndecisional law, decided the range?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You do the same sort\nof research you've done here, and you find out that -\nthat there's a 3-month range. Sometimes -- I mean,\nthere are cases and you can show a lot where they are\nallowed at 9 months, and then you find cases that are\nnot allowed under 6 months.\nMR. BIGELOW: I would be in a lot more\ntenuous position arguing this case if there was some\nguidance to litigants with respect to what does\nconstitute a reasonable time period within which to\nfile. What -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And suppose -- suppose\nCalifornia had a rule that said that you have to file\nwithin 1 year of the finality of the conviction, absent\ngood cause for the delay. If that were the rule that\nCalifornia had, your client certainly would be untimely\nand you wouldn't have a leg to stand on, right?\nMR. BIGELOW: If that were the rule, the\npetition would have been filed timely.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Would -\nMR. BIGELOW: That's my answer. Had that -\nthat is my answer to that question. Had that time\nperiod been known, the petition would have been filed\ntimely.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But if there is a\nrequirement of prompt -- as promptly as circumstances\npermit, wouldn't a person know that 5 years is not as\nprompt as circumstances permitted?\nMR. BIGELOW: There has -- my answer is no,\nbecause in California there are no guidelines. That\ncame in the Clark decision, which was 1993, and nothing\nhas been decided in the State of California to define,\nto clarify, to narrow what constitutes \"promptly.\" What\nconstitutes \"promptly.\"\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Why was this petition not\nfiled for 5 years?\nMR. BIGELOW: I'm sorry.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Why -- why was this petition\nnot filed for 5 years?\nMR. BIGELOW: The record is -- does not\nspeak to that point specifically.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But didn't this come\nabout because it was returned? This was not -- I'm\nthinking about -- he didn't -- he didn't make any claim\nthat he was -- he was diligent.\nMR. BIGELOW: I'm sorry.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: He didn't make any claim\nthat he was diligent in filing it 5 years late.\nMR. BIGELOW: There were no claims made\nexcusing the -- excusing the filing at that time period.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Let's assume that -- that\nCalifornia had just adopted this -- this rule that\nhabeas petitions have to be filed as promptly as\ncircumstances permit. They've just brand-new adopted\nit, and you're the lawyer for somebody who says, you\nknow, I think I'm going to wait 5 years.\nDon't you think that even if there were no\nCalifornia law on the subject, you would know that his\nhabeas claim is going to be denied?\nMR. BIGELOW: If this were a -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Do you really need case law\nto tell you that 5 years is not as promptly as\ncircumstances permit when you -- when you have no\njustification?\nMR. BIGELOW: Decisional law is what our\nsystem is all about, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, so you can't have a\nfirst case?\nMR. BIGELOW: No, I think you can. I think\nyou can have a first case so long as -- so long as the\nstandard itself is not so vague -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, okay.\nMR. BIGELOW: -- that reasonable -- that\nreasonable men are able -- so long as reasonable men are\nable to understand the standard.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You think reasonable men\ndiffer about 5 years?\nMR. BIGELOW: Well --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Bigelow, isn't this\nsimilar to the rule that governed Federal habeas review\nprior to AEDPA?\nMR. BIGELOW: Well -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: A similar kind of delay\nstandard, whatever \"delay\" means.\nMR. BIGELOW: No, if I recall, the standard\nwas prejudicial delay. If I recall correctly. And\nprejudicial delay, if I'm correct, is a quantifiable\nstandard. It is a standard that had, over the years,\ncome to be understood. There was a -- a shared\nexpectation with what prejudice encompassed. And so\nyes, it's similar, but it's not exact. It's not the\nstandard in California.\nAnd if I may, California clearly understands\nthat case law can offer guidance to litigants. In In re\nHarris, a case cited by -- by both of us, by both\nparties, the State of California was concerned about the\nWalterus rule, which is another procedural bar. And it\nwent on to -- it acknowledged that it wasn't clear at\nthat time, and it went on to explain what the Walterus\nrule was all about and why it was needed.\nIn another case, more recently, the State of\nCalifornia -- a case not cited, the Kelly case; it's a\n2006 case -- the California Supreme Court directed its\nlower courts over which it supervises to provide greater\ndetail in their analysis of Wende briefs, which is the\nState's alternative to the Anders brief, in order to\nprovide guidance to litigants, to provide guidance to\njustices, and to -- to provide guidance to the Federal\ncourts who may be called upon to determine procedural\nbars.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Now, I understand\nthat you'd have a much stronger case if you were dealing\nwith a judge-made rule about timeliness, if the courts,\non their own authority, said, look, we're not going to\nlook at things that are filed 4 years late because that\nprejudices the State, it prejudices us, et cetera.\nBut here you have something different. You\nhave a rule, right? An established rule: promptly as\nthe circumstances allow.\nMR. BIGELOW: Judge-made.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Judge-made, but it's\nbeen around for a long time. This isn't a new rule\nthat's just coming in.\nMR. BIGELOW: So a rule in a footnote in a\ncapital case.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, let me get\nback. I tried to -- when you made that point earlier, I\nwanted to follow up on it. Your claim is not that you\ndon't know or defendants in California don't know that\nthe rule is \"as promptly as the circumstances allow,\" do\nyou?\nMR. BIGELOW: No.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No. I thought you\nhad fair notice of that rule.\nMR. BIGELOW: Yes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay.\nMR. BIGELOW: Just not the parameters of the\nrule. And the parameters of the rule, the guidelines\nwhich guide judges, which guide litigants, is just\nsimply not there in California, either with respect to\nthat rule or with respect to substantial delay.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Isn't your argument that the\nCalifornia timeliness rule was never an adequate rule,\nnever can proceed, never can bar consideration of a\nFederal claim?\nMR. BIGELOW: The -- had the -- never. Had\nthe rule been applied even-handedly, had the rule been\napplied consistently, it would certainly be more\nadequate. However, and getting back to Justice Scalia's\npoint, it has never been fairly defined, so it does not\nclearly -\nJUSTICE ALITO: What if Mr. Walker had\nwaited 20 years; would it still be inadequate as to him?\nMR. BIGELOW: In -- that's not -- that's not\nthis case. The rule hasn't been -- the rule has not\nbeen thoroughly set out, at -- at least the guidelines\nhaven't been set, and it might be -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, why can't you take\nthe brackets of -- what was it, 5 months is reasonable\ntime; 18 months is not a reasonable time? Mr. Martin\nfalls outside of the 18 months.\nMR. BIGELOW: Certainly, one -- one could do\nthat, but that hasn't been established as the brackets,\nand it is, after all, California's rule. And it is\nCalifornia that -- which needs to make that\ndetermination. Now, it's -- it's not as if California\nhadn't actually tried to do that.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought there was a\ndecision that said 18 months is too long.\nMR. BIGELOW: Not a decision that said that.\nThese were extrapolated -- no, I beg your pardon.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: There was a decision that\nsaid 18 months is too long.\nMR. BIGELOW: There was a decision that said\na 16-month period, but that was pre-Clark. That was a\npre-Clark decision that actually did say 16 months after\nall is not a particularly long period of time. And\nanother decision -- I beg your -- I beg the Court's\npardon -- another decision said that 2 years wasn't a\nparticularly long period of time.\nBut those are -- those are pre-Clark\ndecisions, if you will, and this case is relying upon -\nor the State, rather, is relying on what has come after\n-- after Clark with respect to its \"as promptly as the\ncircumstances should allow.\"\nBut the other point that I would like to\nmake, it's not as if the State of California doesn't\nunderstand the need for a finite period of time to\nprovide guidance to -- to all parties. In -- in\nSaffold, the State requested this Court presume a filing\nperiod. I think it was -- I want to say 60 days. More\nrecently in Chavez, a filing period was requested to be\npresumed, again by the State.\nAnd both occasions, this -- this Court\ndeclined because it isn't this Court's prerogative to\nset rules for the State. What this Court did do is it\ncertified the question to the State of California, or\nthey asked the Ninth Circuit at least to certify the\nquestion to the State of California. The Ninth Circuit\ndid exactly as this Court asked it to do and certified\nthe question, and the State of California said: We're\nnot going to tell you what a timeliness period is.\nNow, that does not help pro se litigants\nwith minimal education, without benefit of counsel, who\nare the vast majority of habeas petitioners in the State\nof California.\nJUSTICE ALITO: How many -\nMR. BIGELOW: They -\nJUSTICE ALITO: How may of these petitions\nare filed each year in the California Supreme Court?\nMR. BIGELOW: Approximately 2,500, give or\ntake.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Approximately what?\nMR. BIGELOW: Approximately 2,500, based on\na LexisNexis kind of search.\nJUSTICE ALITO: With that many petitions, is\nthere any possibility that a multifactor test such as\nthe one that California is applying could be applied\nwith any degree of regularity, unless there's some sort\nof secret internal guidelines that are being applied by\nthe California Supreme Court in deciding this?\nMR. BIGELOW: That's the problem. That's\nthe problem. The test that is applied without\nguidelines, without any kind of guidelines. Judicial\ndiscretion -- judicial discretion is informed\ndiscretion; it is not discretion -- it's -- it's\njudgment pursuant to known guidelines. It is not a\njudgment issued pursuant to inclination.\nAnd the concern is that with this kind of\namorphous standard, inconsistent and arbitrary\napplication is impossible to enforce.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But it's like having rules;\nwhen you have rules and say 60 days or 90 days, you find\nimpossible cases that you should have heard because it\nwas the 91st day or it was the 92nd day, and then you\ngive the people equitable discretion to depart from it,\nand pretty soon you get litigation over that. I mean,\nthere's no perfect system.\nMR. BIGELOW: Discretion to depart from a\nrule that has been violated is one thing. Here, there\nis no quantifiable or known parameters within which\ndiscretion -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So is the solution for\nCalifornia to say, if you delay more than a year from\nwhen you should have known, you're barred except we'll\nexcuse it for any number of reasons?\nMR. BIGELOW: Certainly, and -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That would be a\nregularly and consistently applied rule in your mind?\nMR. BIGELOW: Well -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That would be enough?\nMR. BIGELOW: It -- it wouldn't necessarily\nbe consistently applied until we're down the road and we\nlearn how consistently it has, in fact, been applied,\nbut certainly it would be -- it would be an appropriate\nrule.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You may be -- you'd better\nbe careful about what you wish for because I am not sure\nthat the kind of system that's being proposed is going\nto be better for habeas applicants than the one that\nCalifornia now has. We really don't know that, do we?\nMR. BIGELOW: We -- if -- if we collectively\nscreamed and yelled when AEDPA passed with its 1-year\nstatute of limitations, we've learned to live with it,\nand we meet the deadlines because we know what the\ndeadlines are.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And pro se litigants who\ndon't know deadlines generally are going to live with\nknowing that -- what?\nMR. BIGELOW: They've got a better chance of\n-- they've got a better chance of meeting deadlines if\nthey know what those deadlines are, and there's nothing\nto take -- there is nothing to take the flexibility from\nthe California Supreme Court if there is a deadline.\nBut the -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, what about -- that's\nwhy I go back to the lower courts. If there really is a\nproblem here, why wouldn't the bar look into how well\nthis practice is working in the lower courts and find\nout, well, what is the practice? How do they use it?\nDo we want more flexibility? Do we want more definite\nrules? That's -- I agree that you put your finger on a\nproblem, an important problem. I'm not at all certain\nthat the one system is better or required or compulsory.\nMR. BIGELOW: The red light is going to go\non in an about a minute. Let me answer it this way:\nThe most powerful court probably in the world requested\nclarification of the rule and didn't get it. I don't\nknow who else is going to.\nUnless there are other questions -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Marshall, you have 4 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF TODD MARSHALL\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. MARSHALL: This Court has explained, in\nDugger v. Adams, that a handful of inconsistent cases do\nnot undermine the adequacy inquiry, and unless the\ninconsistency becomes so profound that it undermines\nfair notice, it should not matter that there are some\ndifferent rulings that can be shown. There's no reason\nto think that a rule that has a bright deadline and then\ntakes into considerations after the deadline is somehow\npreferable to a rule that takes into considerations\ndiscretionary circumstances in the first instance.\nAnd unless there are any further\nquestions -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
