SMITH\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. SMITH: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThis case is narrowed to a single, but from\nthe Petitioner's perspective a critical, dispute over\nthe scope of internal State sovereignty: whether the\nFirst Amendment trumps the otherwise existing authority\nof the Idaho legislature to direct political\nsubdivisions of the State to take an action, here\nrestricting access to their payroll systems, that the\nsubdivisions could take independently without violating\nthe Amendment.\nThe genesis of this dispute is Idaho Code\nSection 44-2004(2), which was adopted in 2003. That\nprovision prohibits State and local government public\nemployers from deducting amounts for political\nactivities from the payroll checks due to their\nemployees and remitting those amounts to third parties.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Didn't the statute also\nprohibit private employers from doing that?\nMR. SMITH: As construed by the district\ncourt, it did. The base legislation in this, the\nVoluntary Contribution Act, excluded from application an\nemployee -- an employer subject to the two major labor\n-- Federal labor relations statutes, the NLRA and the\nRLA.\nBut there was obviously a group of\nemployers, private employers, in -- who were not engaged\nin commerce, as well as the agricultural sector.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And you concede the\nstatute was unconstitutional as applied to them?\nMR. SMITH: The district court concluded\nthat the -- yes, Your Honor, we did.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And you agree with that\nconclusion?\nMR. SMITH: We do.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And what is the difference\nbetween the private employer and the county agency?\nMR. SMITH: Well, the principal difference\nis that one is a private employer -- that is to say,\nengaging in private speech -- while the public employer\nis a -- is a subdivision of the State of Idaho, subject,\nwe would argue, to the plenary control, pursuant to the\nIdaho Constitution, of the Idaho legislature.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I think Justice\nStevens's question highlights for me one of the\nconfusing parts of this case. You sort of paired off a\nnumber of the people who would otherwise be covered, and\nyou are left with the county employees. If you\nhad started with the county employees, is this how you\nwould have gone about telling them they can't do this?\nI mean the county employers. Would you have passed a\nlaw saying that the county employers are not allowed to\nhave this checkoff? If you think they are part of the\nState, I guess you could have just written them a letter\nand say don't do this, right?\nMR. SMITH: Your Honor, in a word, the\nanswer is no. I don't believe we, referring to the\nPetitioners in this case, could have written the -- the\npolitical subdivisions of a State to direct them to take\nan action unless there was a legislative basis for doing\nso.\nIn this instance, the -- the legislature\nconcluded that it wanted all public employers, among\nothers, to not allow access to their payroll systems.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Do I understand that the\ncounties, if they elected to, could decide not to -- not\nto do the checkoff?\nMR. SMITH: Prior to the adoption of the\nstatute in 2003, yes.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And so why should counties\nbe different from -- from -- I'm still puzzled about why\ncounties -- county employers are different from private\nemployers in terms of the State interest in preventing\nthe checkoff.\nMR. SMITH: Well, there is a fundamental\ndifference, Your Honor. And -- and it rests in the\nnotion that the State has no interest in the -- in\nprivate employers' determination to be involved or not\ninvolved in political matters. The State legislature,\nhowever, has a very concrete interest in avoiding either\nthe reality or the appearance --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: If you -- if you think of\nthe case as a principal-agent case so that the principal\ncan direct the agent as to what to do, the agent being\nthe county, then it seems to me that the unions might\nstill have an argument that this is an unconstitutional\ncondition.\nI've been looking for ways to examine this\ncase. The public forum doesn't really work for me.\nSubsidy doesn't really work for me. It seems to me to\nbe an unconstitutional-condition case. At least that's\nthe argument.\nThat doesn't mean you necessarily can't\nprevail. But suppose the State told the city: You\ncan't have a parade that you sponsor for this particular\ncause. That would raise an unconstitutional-conditions\nargument; wouldn't it?\nMR. SMITH: It might, Your Honor, but that\nsituation, of course, is not the situation presented\nhere.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Why isn't it? And I say\nthat because I think that follows on Justice Stevens's\nline of questioning. I didn't mean to interrupt him,\nbut it seems to me that is consistent with what he is\nasking.\nMR. SMITH: Because the statute at issue\nhere, Justice Kennedy, speaks across the board to a\nspecific kind of conduct, political activities. It does\nso in the a viewpoint-neutral fashion. To prohibit a\nparticular parade might well raise viewpoint\nnon-neutrality issues.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes, because the\nState couldn't --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: You stand up and say that\nthis isn't viewpoint -- that this is -- that this is\nviewpoint-based. Isn't it where the union -- and\naren't they right about that?\nMR. SMITH: Your Honor, they are incorrect\nabout that. The district court concluded that the\nstatute is viewpoint-neutral. Indeed --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But does it get at any\nspeech other than union speech? I mean you say, yes, it\nis content-based, but it's viewpoint neutral. But it\nseems that what is banned by the statute is union\nspeech. Is any other organization affected? Does the\nban affect any other organization? Isn't it simply\nunion speech that's at stake?\nMR. SMITH: The answer is no. It -- the --\nthe statute just -- does not just affect union speech by\nits literal terms.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But, in practice, is\nthere any other application?\nMR. SMITH: Well, there is no evidence in\nthe record, Your Honor, as to any other entity who is\naffected by the statute. But that is hardly -- that's\nhardly remarkable, given the fact that the plaintiffs in\nthe litigation are six labor organizations. I should\nadd that --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Are there -- are there in\ncounties some charitable drives that occur annually and\nthat permit employees to donate to those charities\nthrough deductions from their wages?\nMR. SMITH: There are, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And would they presumably\nbe covered by this? United Fund drives, so-called, my\n-- my recollection is that usually the contributions to\nthat simply come out of -- are deducted from the wages.\nAnd if they existed in the counties, presumably they\nwould have been covered. But we don't know if they\nwould.\nMR. SMITH: Well, to the extent that the --\nthe contribution was for political activities --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, it's only political\nactivities?\nMR. SMITH: That's correct.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I see. Well, none of those\nwould allow that --\nJUSTICE BREYER: But if in fact there is a\ncharity, which charity in Idaho is a charity that makes\nall of its contributions to help support right-to-work\nlaws. All right. So that charity goes and says, could\nyou -- we'd like a payroll deduction. Can they get it,\nor not?\nMR. SMITH: Your Honor, again, it depends.\nI -- I don't know the answer.\nJUSTICE BREYER: You don't know. Okay. So,\nthen, we do know this. We do know -- what I'm wondering\nis: Isn't this case, to me, quite confused about\nsomething fairly simple? The question would be: Look,\none, do you or do you not in Idaho allow anybody to have\npayroll deductions for anything? And I take it your\nanswer to that question is: Yes, we do allow some\npayroll deductions for some things. Okay?\nSo then we look at this one, and it says:\nNo payroll deductions for union activities that are\npolitical. All right? Now, you either do have or you\ndo not have a justification for that difference. If you\nhave a reasonable, or whatever the sufficient test is,\njustification for the difference, you win. And if you\ndon't, you lose. And, indeed, whether you are the State\nor the county could have to do with the plausibility of\nthe justification.\nHere we are, end of case, traditional. You\njust -- you didn't argue it that way, I guess, below.\nWhat's wrong with that?\nMR. SMITH: Your Honor, in fact, we argued\nbelow that there was no constitutional right of access\nto the payroll system for purposes of making political\ncontributions. And let me reiterate at this --\nJUSTICE BREYER: There certainly, I would\nthink, would be a problem if the right-to-work people\ncan get there. And you are not going to let the unions\nget there. But I don't know the facts. So shouldn't we\njust send this case back and say: Please look at what\nthe situation is? If they have to treat some people one\nway, some people another, bad; if they don't, everybody\nis treated alike for good reason, probably okay.\nMR. SMITH: Well, the -- I would suggest\nthat a remand for that purpose would be futile. The\ndistrict court, as I said before, concluded that the\nstatute is viewpoint neutral. And let me stress that\nthe term \"political activities\" does not -- is not\ndefined with reference to unions or speech by other\nentities that might be controlled by unions.\nIt addresses political contributions for\nelectoral matters, independent expenditures, and\nexpenditures to political parties.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Would -- would they include\ncontributions to an organization that makes\ncontributions to political parties --\nMR. SMITH: Yes, to the --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- such as a right-to\nwork-organization?\nMR. SMITH: To the extent that the -- the\norganization is, for example, a political action\ncommittee, it would.\nAnd let me go back to Justice Ginsburg's\nquestion for a moment. Had the legislature intended\n44-2004(2) to apply only to unions, they would have --\nit would have been engaging in a redundancy because\nunder another provision of the same legislation,\n44-2603(1)(b)(iv), which appears at petition appendix\n70, the Idaho legislature proscribed amounts being --\namounts -- required all amounts to be paid -- paid to a\nseparate segregated fund which was established pursuant\nto the legislation that was invalidated by the district\ncourt, required those kinds of contributions to be made\ndirectly by the employee and not through -- or not by\nthe employee's employer.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Does the State give some\nparticular favor to unions? I mean, does it allow --\nwhat -- what is the situation? Can you be forced to\ncontribute to the union even though you're not a union\nmember?\nMR. SMITH: No, Your Honor. The --\n44-2004(2) is part of the Idaho Right to Work Act, which\nwas adopted in the mid 1980s. It allows amounts to be\ndeducted through payroll checkoffs for union dues.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But unions do have a\nspecial prerogative which -- which no other\norganizations, as far as you're aware, have in the\nState, which is to have money deducted from people's\npayrolls?\nMR. SMITH: That's -- that's correct. The\n--\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No other\norganization other than the Federal, State and local\ngovernments.\nMR. SMITH: True. But let -- let me -- let\nme continue with my response to Justice Scalia's\nquestion.\nThe special prerogative that, for example,\nthe Pocatello Education Association or the firefighters\nunion has is the ability to engage in collective\nbargaining pursuant to State statute as the exclusive\nbargaining representative of, for example, the Pocatello\nSchool District's teachers.\nThat exclusivity which is granted to a\nlimited number of -- of -- in fact, two areas under\nColorado -- excuse me -- under Idaho law, namely,\nfirefighters and teachers, is the extraordinary benefit\nthat unions have.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes. The point of my\nquestion is it doesn't seem to be terribly\ndiscriminatory if indeed the only organizations in the\nState that are given the right, whether by Federal or\nState law, to deduct, private organizations, given the\nright to deduct from the salary a municipal or private\nemployer pays. It doesn't seem to me particularly\ndiscriminatory to say that, moreover, in making those\ndeductions, no part of it will be given for political\nactivities. I mean you're only addressing a narrow\nclass, but it's a narrow class that has a special\nbenefit.\nMR. SMITH: Well, I would agree that -- that\nunions have, and particularly these -- particularly the\nRespondents have a special benefit. But again, I go\nback to the basic point that 2004(2) addresses all\npublic employers or public employees and is not limited\nto political activity contributions. That might be, for\nexample, as the situation is here, to a union-sponsored\npolitical action -- political action committee.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask a question\nabout, say, an attempt to deduct contributions to a\ncharity like the United Fund? Do counties have a choice\nto either do that or not do it, or does State law\nrequire them to accept such requests?\nMR. SMITH: Local governments have\ndiscretion.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: They have discretion to do\nthat?\nMR. SMITH: That's correct.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: With respect to the union\nsituation, the statute takes away that discretion.\nMR. SMITH: With respect --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And the question is why is\nthere -- why is there a State interest in taking away\nthat discretion for unions, but not as to charities.\nMR. SMITH: Well, it takes away that\ndiscretion with respect to any third party who might\nreceive amounts for political activities.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: For political activities.\nBut what is -- what is the reason for differentiating\npolitical activities from charities?\nMR. SMITH: The reason, as we articulate in\nour brief, is the desire to avoid either the appearance\nor the reality of public employer involvement in, in\nthis instance, electoral politics.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I see.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Are there other\nareas in which the State exercises the authority you're\nasserting here with respect to county employers, telling\nthem what they can and can't do?\nMR. SMITH: Outside the area of elections,\nnot with respect to payroll deductions.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I mean more\ngenerally. Your assertion is that this is part of the\nState, and therefore, as I gather, it's conceded on the\nother side, this is acceptable with respect to State\nemployees but not other public employers. Are there\nother areas in which you act like the counties are part\nof the State?\nMR. SMITH: Your Honor, the -- the county --\ncounties in Idaho and I suppose in most States act as\npolitical subdivisions of the State. And whatever\nauthority they have or don't have derives, if not\nexclusively, virtually exclusively from State law.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm looking for --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No. Please.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm looking for a\nspecific example. I mean, maybe counties or\nmunicipalities, you know, contract for trash collection\nor water services and maybe the State tells them, look,\nyou've got to deal with these people, you've got to do\nit by open bidding, whatever.\nMR. SMITH: Your Honor, let me go back to\nthe election context for a moment to try to address that\nquestion. Prior to its amendments pursuant to the\nlegislation at hand, Idaho Code Section 67-6605, which\nis part of Idaho's election campaign finance and\nreporting statute or general statutes, allowed payroll\ndeductions to be made for contributions to political\ncommittees. In that sense, it allowed counties, as well\nas other public employers, to make deductions of the\nkind at issue today.\nNow, that authority was rescinded by virtue\nof the amendment to 2004(2). The point simply is that\nif necessary, we -- we could describe in detail various\nkinds of -- of requirements that exist with respect to\ncounties or school districts or cities.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's --\nsince I asked the question, I think it's necessary. So\nwhat's the best example where the State exercises\ncontrol over what the counties would otherwise have\ndiscretion to do? You mentioned school districts. Is\nthat -- is that an area?\nMR. SMITH: Well, Your Honor, for example,\nwith respect to -- take open meetings, for example, take\npublic records, for example. Those are general kinds of\nstatutes that impose requirements on all levels of State\ngovernment. So, for example, with respect to open\nmeetings, the Idaho law requires essentially all\nmeetings, except for certain exclusions, to be open to\nthe public. In that sense, it's akin to the Wisconsin\nstatute.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What about a Hatch Act?\nDoes -- does -- does the State allow State employees to\nengage in political activity?\nMR. SMITH: Your Honor, it does, but not --\nnot in connection with their public employment\nactivities.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't know -- I don't\nknow what that means.\nMR. SMITH: It means that there is no\nprohibition under State law, for example, for a public\nemployee to engage in political activity. If -- but our\nstatute in Idaho applies actually only to State\nemployees. It doesn't govern those kinds of activities\nby local government.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's interesting. Why\nnot?\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: The general proposition\nthat underlies your argument that the local entities are\ncreatures of State law and they cannot receive Federal\npowers from the Federal Government when the States\nobject, is that -- is that an acceptable proposition?\nMR. SMITH: It would be an acceptable\nproposition to the extent that Federal law doesn't\npre-empt State law, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Right.\nMR. SMITH: In this instance, we would argue\nthat the First Amendment does not interpose some kind of\nbarrier to essentially vulcanize local government from\nState legislative control.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: There is -- there is a\ncase out of the Ninth Circuit, and it was affirmed by\nthis Court on a procedural point, but not on a -- not on\nthe merits -- out of the neighboring State of\nWashington, where the State says a locality cannot build\na dam more than 25 feet high. The locality then gets a\nlicense from the Federal Power Commission, and the State\nsaid, well, you still don't have this authority. And\nthe Ninth Circuit said you do. The Federal power then\nsupersedes.\nWould you agree that that case is valid?\nMR. SMITH: Depending on -- on the facts, I\n-- I would agree that it is certainly possible for the\nState law to --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Because there the local\nentity has powers greater than what the State wants to\ngive it, even over the State's objection.\nMR. SMITH: Well, but -- but, Your Honor,\nthat is, I think, beyond cavil; that is to say that\nFederal law --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I -- I didn't hear\nyou. You think that's what?\nMR. SMITH: Beyond cavil, beyond --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Really, if the State can\n-- can opt not to do something, it can't tell its\nsubdivisions, we don't want you to do it, either? And\nthe subdivision can then go to the -- directly to the\nFederal Government and say, please let us do this, even\nif the State would be free to reject it on its own?\nMR. SMITH: Well, it -- it depends on --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: It seems to me that that\nis the argument you should be making here.\nMR. SMITH: Your Honor, perhaps it was --\nit was an argument that we don't have to make in this\ninstance. Needless to say, by virtue of the Supremacy\nClause, there may be instances where Federal law --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But I thought your whole\nargument was that the counties are simply\ninstrumentalities of the State, and the State has full\npower over them. It chooses to delegate to them\nautonomy, but it holds the control rein. And now you're\nsaying no, that the Federal Government can give the\nState local-unit authority that the State, itself,\nchooses not to give. And you say that's beyond cavil.\nI really don't understand your argument.\nMR. SMITH: It is beyond cavil if the\nFederal law, in fact, supersedes State law. There may\nbe issues --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That depends -- I\nmean the whole case turns on -- and the response to\nJustice Kennedy, I think, would be -- if the Federal\nGovernment is simply saying you can do it if you want,\nthat's one thing. If the Federal Government is saying\nyou must do it because it's covered by the Federal Power\nAct, or whatever, that's different.\nIf it's just a grant of permission, I would\nsuppose the State can say, well, fine, it's okay with\nthe Feds, but you can't do it because we don't want you\nto.\nMR. SMITH: That's correct.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And don't -- don't you\nsuffer from -- doesn't your position suffer from a -- a\nmore serious problem that doesn't even implicate the\npre-emption doctrine? And that is, as I understand your\nargument, the -- the local governments are creatures of\nthe State. Their powers are the powers that the State\ngives them by statute, as -- as you were pointing out.\nThe same thing is true for corporations.\nCorporations are creatures of the State. They have the\npowers, and only the powers, that the State gives to\nthem. It -- it seems to me, going back to Justice\nStevens's initial question, that I don't see where the\ndistinction lies between the -- in effect, the position\nof the local-government units and corporations, and --\nand between the local-government units and the\ncorporations. And it seems to me that that's a problem\nfor you quite apart from any application of Federal law.\nMR. SMITH: I disagree, Justice Souter. The\n-- as I stated in response to Justice Stevens, the\ndifference is a central one. That is to say, a\ncorporation is a private entity with -- with distinct\nrights under the First Amendment.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, it has distinct\nrights under the First Amendment if State law creates a\ncorporate form of -- of -- of business organization.\nAnd the -- the -- when -- when it comes into existence,\nit then does acquire some rights under the national\nConstitution. But if in the first instance it's a\ncreature of State law, its powers, generally speaking,\nare the powers that State law gives it. And that is --\nthat same proposition is true of counties and towns and\n-- and other sub-State governmental units.\nMR. SMITH: I disagree to the extent that\nthere is any attempt to equate a private corporation\nwith essentially an agent or an arm of the State such as\na county, which has been delegated governmental\nfunctions.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: All right. Then -- then it\nseems to me that your argument is not that State law\ncontrols what it may do and defines its powers. Your\nargument, it seems to me, has to rest upon the fact that\nwhat it is doing is a public, as opposed to a private,\nfunction. And that's the extent of the argument. Isn't\nthat true?\nMR. SMITH: Well, that is -- certainly is\nthe distinction between a private corporation and, for\nexample, a county.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: That's the only distinction\nthat you can maintain. You can't maintain the\ndistinction based upon the superiority of State law in\ndefining the -- the extent of the governmental unit's\npowers and so on, because that is just as true of a\ncorporation. So your distinction has simply got to be a\ndistinction based on the nature of the function that is\nbeing performed.\nMR. SMITH: And -- and the very nature of\nthe entity, itself, Your Honor. A county --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: What -- what do you mean by\nthe \"nature of\" --\nMR. SMITH: A county or school district\nperforms functions assigned to it by the State\nlegislature to carry out the function, to carry out\nactivities that are public in nature.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, it's doing -- it's\ndoing a governmental job.\nMR. SMITH: That's correct.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: We understand what that is,\nso I understand that point.\nMR. SMITH: Your Honor, I -- I can only\nrepeat that the distinction between the private\ncorporation and the -- and a political subdivision of\nthe State is that, in fact, one is an entity created by\nthe legislature for the very purpose of carrying out\nState governmental functions. That -- that, I think, is\nentirely consistent with the position argued throughout\nthis case.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No. But -- it -- it is,\nbut I mean when you say, as I think you are now saying,\nthe -- the law for the State to be the law for the\nsubdivision because they are both governmental, the\ncounter-argument is, in fact, there are resemblances to\nprivate organizations, too. And those resemblances are,\nin effect, their creation and definition by State law;\ntheir enjoyment of the powers, and only those powers,\nwhich State law gives them; so that, in fact, there\nis -- there is not only an analogy with the State\ngovernment, there is an analogy with private\ncorporations, too. And the question is why should we\nchoose one analogy rather than the other analogy?\nMR. SMITH: And Your Honor, I think I\nresponded.\nJUSTICE ALITO: You don't think that under\nour Federal system, the States have greater powers\ndeciding how they are going to organize themselves than\nthey have with respect to the regulation of artificial\nprivate entities that they choose to permit under State\nlaw?\nMR. SMITH: Yes. States -- of course States\ndo have that authority.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, we'll give\nyou a minute for rebuttal --\nMR. SMITH: Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Since our\nquestioning has taken away from your time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Collins.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JEREMIAH A. COLLINS\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. COLLINS: Mr. Chief Justice and may it\nplease the Court:\nThis case turns on three points. First, the\nstatute at issue is a content-based restriction on\nspeech which is therefore presumptively invalid,\nrequires heightened scrutiny, which Petitioners\nacknowledge they have not satisfied, unless one of the\nexceptions to heightened scrutiny is applicable here,\nthose being exceptions which as the Court has explained\nin R.A.V. and Davenport, are limited to circumstances\nwhere there is no real risk of viewpoint suppression.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Collins, suppose -- I\ngather Idaho doesn't have it, but suppose Idaho wanted a\nHatch Act similar to the Federal Hatch Act that\nprohibits Federal employees from engaging in political\nactivity, and suppose it decided that not only should\nthe State employees at the capital not engage in\npolitical activities, but it's a problem for any\ngovernmental employee to do that; they ought to be\nneutral and we don't want patronage to be passed out on\nthe basis of whether they are campaigning for one party\nor another, and we don't want them to be coerced into\ncampaigning for one party or another. Now, I assume\nthat such a law would violate the First Amendment if it\nwere extended to all employers. Saying no -- no company\nemployee, no private employee can engage in political\nactivity would surely violate the First Amendment.\nWould it violate the First Amendment if it was extended?\nCertainly, it doesn't when it's applied to State\nemployees because there are a lot of State Hatch Acts.\nAnd you're saying it would violate the First Amendment\nas applied to county and municipal employees?\nMR. COLLINS: Not at all, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why not?\nMR. COLLINS: We don't take that position at\nall, because, as the Court has indicated in Letter\nCarriers and Broadrick and other cases, there is a\ncompelling interest in a statute which says that\ngovernment employees -- and it could be State or local\n-- will not be performing their jobs as servants of\npolitics.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You're saying -- you're\nanalogizing these to private entities. That's your\nwhole point.\nMR. COLLINS: That's not our point.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: This is not a creature of\nthe State. You're saying what the First Amendment -- as\nthe First Amendment applies to private individuals, so\nit applies here. This is regulation by the State,\nrather than the State's control of State government.\nMR. COLLINS: We are saying that, Your\nHonor, because the only defense that the State can\npossibly offer here to this content discrimination is\nthe forum notion that the State has introduced. In the\ncase of --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Now --\nMR. COLLINS: It's not a forum analysis.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Let me just establish something at\nthe outset. You had conceded below, and I thought I saw\nthis in your brief as well, that as to the State of\nIdaho, its determination not to allow the deductibility\nis permissible.\nMR. COLLINS: That's correct, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: All right. So, we begin\nwith the proposition that a State may do this if it\nchooses; i.e., this -- refused on its own to have the\npayroll deduction.\nMR. COLLINS: Yes. And the reason for that\nis that, under Regan and Finley and Rust and the other\ncases, the State has perfect freedom to decide not to\ndevote its own resources and expenditure. But\ninterestingly and very much on point here --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And if -- and if a State\nhad a system in which all payroll deductions were -- by\nlocal entities -- were routinely controlled by the\nState, the State did all the pay roles for the local\nentities, then it -- in that case the nondeductibility\nwould also be permitted, I take it.\nMR. COLLINS: Yes, Your Honor, and let me\nexplain because those are two -- the answer to both\nquestions is \"yes\" but for two very different reasons.\nThe answer to the second question is that our contention\nis not that the State is never a proprietor and never\nentitled to the kind of deference that goes with the\nproprietor when it's dealing with local government\nprograms. As the Court noted in the Council of\nGreenberg case, a government can become a proprietor\nwith respect to property or programs it doesn't actually\nown. Our point is quite simply that the State has not\ndone that here. That's why, if the State had done it,\nif the State said we are going to dictate the nature of\npayroll deduction systems for and local governments, the\nState could do that, and it would be then --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Did you have any\ndoubt how they would? I mean, they passed a law\ndictating that with respect to everybody. And then it's\npared down by litigation and concessions. So, we don't\nhave any real question of what the State is wanting to\ndo here. It's --\nMR. COLLINS: What I'm suggesting, Mr. Chief\nJustice, is that since we are beginning with a\ncontent-based restriction -- and I do want to emphasize\nit's a law here which says that for all employers --\npublic, private, or State -- the only expenditure you\ncan't make through payroll deduction is for political\nactivities, and also the only resource of an employer\nthat can't be used for any kind of political activity is\npayroll deduction, this being in a statute targeted at\nemployee support of union activity. So, we have a\ncontent-based restriction, and the question is: Can it\ncome within an exception to the heightened scrutiny that\nPetitioners acknowledge they can't satisfy?\nBut when I'm suggesting that the State could\ncome within reduced scrutiny if it were actually\nmanaging the payroll system, I'm referring to situations\nlike Council of Greenburg, where the government with\nrespect to a particular kind of facility or program\nsays, we don't own it, but we -- it's an integral part\nof a system that we are managing, establishing, not just\nsaying -- not just to say all we care about is one kind\nof speech we don't want to go on there. If the\ngovernment says we have -- we want to be the manager,\nthe operator of a particular kind of local government\noperation, the State is free to do that --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, if the State wants\nto, it's because it can exercise a heavy hand and\ncontrol its local units, but if it wants to give the\nlocal units discretion, then it has to leave it to the\nlocal units whether or not they want to enact such a\nban. That's your position?\nMR. COLLINS: No. It's not a question of\nwhether the State has the power to regulate. The\nquestion is if the State regulation is in the form of a\ncontent-based restriction on speech, can it elude\nheightened scrutiny? And --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: My question really is, if\nyou look at this at the most basic level, we have two\nimportant concessions. You don't question the\nconstitutionality of the ban as to State employees. And\nthe other side doesn't question that it is\nunconstitutional as to private employees. So here we\nhave State local employees. Do we bracket them with\nwith State employees or with private employees as\nessential --\nMR. COLLINS: Your Honor, functionally\nthat's the question, but I think analytically we don't\nsee it that way because the question is, as we see it,\nis the State, with regard to this challenged statute in\nits application to the local governments, acting in a\ncapacity that entitles it to be free from the normal\nFirst Amendment scrutiny that it acknowledges it would\nfail-- and that's where our point is. The reason it is\nfree from that scrutiny as to its own employees is\nbecause of the cases that say the government doesn't\nhave to spend its money.\nJUSTICE BREYER: It's at that part, just\nwhere you are, that I've always had a hard time not for\nlack of trying. I don't understand what the word\n\"content-based\" means, and I know it's all over the law,\nbut I've never understood it and maybe since you're\nrelying on it 15 times you can explain it. And the\nthing I don't understand it about is it seems to me\ngovernment engages in thousands of different kinds of\nactivity, and there isn't some special test. When they\nsay that in the jury room, the jury room is there for\njuries; it's not to show movies of Steven Spielberg.\nAnd there isn't some special test when you say the\npurpose of the biology class is to teach biology, and we\ndon't want people coming in here teaching some other\nthing. I don't understand what this special test called\n\"content-based\" is, and that's rather a deep\nmisunderstanding on my part, but since you're depending\non it, why don't you take 30 seconds or 45 seconds to\nsee if you can help me?\nMR. COLLINS: Well, Justice Breyer, the --\nthe concept of content discrimination may blur on some\nedges, but one thing that the Court has been clear on is\nthat when a government says speech -- one form of speech\nwill not be allowed and that will be political speech,\nthat is treated as requiring heightened scrutiny. And I\nshould say --\nJUSTICE BREYER: It doesn't -- for example,\nin biology class, the school board says: You know,\nbiology teacher, I want you to teach biology; I don't\nwant you to teach politics. And then there is some\nspecial scrutiny about how the biology teacher is to\nteach or -- but they say just face it. The jury room is\nfor juries. It's not for politics. All that is subject\nto some special First Amendment test?\nMR. COLLINS: Well, first of all, Your\nHonor, all of those would pass muster either because --\nJUSTICE BREYER: They might. They might.\nBut you know a lot of them, you know you could show\nmovies in jury rooms in the evening and people might\nfind it much better.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. COLLINS: They would pass muster either\nbecause they are within exceptions to heightened\nscrutiny -- because not all content distinctions require\nheightened scrutiny -- or they would pass muster even\nunder heightened scrutiny. But one kind of content\ndistinction that the Court consistently has indicated\nrequires heightened scrutiny is in -- well, in Burson, a\nmajority court at least, you can talk about anything you\nwant near the polling place but not politics. That was\ncontent. Consolidated Edison -- you can talk about\nanything -- billing envelopes but not controversial\nissues. Davenport, very recently -- from fees that\nindividuals are required to pay to you -- and in this\ncase we are not talking about any compelled fees -- but\nwith compelled fees, you can use them for anything you\nwant but not politics.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Since we are in\nconfessional mode, I've never understood forum analysis.\nI don't understand how --\n(Laughter.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- how you can say\nthat this payroll deduction system is some kind of a\nforum. A forum is, you know, the corner at Hyde Park or\nsomething. This is -- this is something that\ngovernmental entities and private entities do, and they\ncan either exclude this type of activity or they can't.\nAnd the problem with the forum analysis is it's all or\nnothing. I mean -- and both parties seem to agree: If\nit's a State forum, you could do it; if it's a private\nforum or if it's an open forum, you can't. That's not\nhow we usually analyze these things.\nMR. COLLINS: Well, two points in response\nto that, Mr. Chief Justice. First, we are not the ones\nwho say that this must be looked at under forum\nanalysis. We'd be quite happy, and I think the most\nsensible way actually to approach the case is that this\nis a content distinction, and it's presumptively\ninvalid, and there is no sufficient justification.\nThe other side says wait a minute; there is\na line of cases that says that when there is a forum\ninvolved of the government, and the government is\nrestricting speech in that forum, there can be an\nexception to heightened scrutiny. In Davenport --\nJUSTICE ALITO: You say there is a\nsufficient -- presumably you concede there is a\nsufficient justification for this content-based\nrestriction as to State employees.\nMR. COLLINS: What we say as the State\nemployees, Justice Alito, is that if falls under the\nRegan-Findley line of cases; that you don't even get to\na First Amendment scrutiny because it's under the\ndoctrine that when the government says we won't spend\nour money on something, that's not an infringement of\nspeech in the first place. And interestingly --\nJUSTICE ALITO: So if there is State money\ninvolved in these payroll systems that would be\nsufficient?\nMR. COLLINS: If the State said you can't\nuse our money for payroll deductions of this kind then\nit would arguably be into that category. But I think\nwhat's important to recognize --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Isn't there -- isn't\nthere some State tax money that goes to fund local\nunits? I mean, you say here there are State taxpayers'\nfunds involved; therefore the State doesn't have to pay\nfor what it doesn't want to buy. But are there State\nfunds that fund local government entities?\nMR. SMITH: There is State funding, but the\nreason, I believe, why the Respondents -- excuse me the\nPetitioners -- have conceded that the subsidization case\nlaw does not apply to this statute in its application to\nthe local governments, is that what the subsidization\ncases are talking about -- cases like Regan, Rust,\nFindley -- are situations where we'll say the State is\ninvolved in developing a program which it will pay for,\nand it says because we are paying for that, our\npriorities are to be honored.\nThe government in this instance, it's been\nconceded, as the Court of Appeals pointed out, there is\nno actual subsidization to the payroll systems. In\neffect the State says we have some money we give to our\nlocal governments -- by no means, all revenue, but they\nget some money. But we -- the State does not set the\nkinds of budget priorities that are protected by the\nRegan line of cases. Specifically, the State in effect\nsays that as far as payroll systems and in fact as far\nas most employment matters and most administrative\nmatters are concerned, here's some money for you, local\ngovernment. The only thing we say about it is don't use\nit for political payroll deductions.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, but another way of\nlooking at it is to say in each of these instances --\nwhether we are talking about the State taxing in order\nto perform functions at the State level or whether the\nState is authorizing taxation for functions for\nfunctions to be performed at the local level -- in all\nof these instances, the State is in the position to say\nnot that it is sort of our money, but to say it is\npublic money. And our decision is that public money\nwill not be used to -- by a public entity to underwrite\npolitical activity.\nAnd why isn't the State in exactly the same\nposition in making that judgment, whether it's talking\nabout money that goes directly into the State coffer or\npublic tax money that happens to be going into a -- a\ntown coffer?\nMR. COLLINS: Because, Your Honor, I think\nthe courts never applied the Regan subsidization\nanalysis in that kind of --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But I'm -- I'm asking you\nwhy shouldn't --\nMR. COLLINS: It shouldn't --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Why shouldn't we, on the\ntheory that what is important is not which particular\ncoffer the penny goes into, but the fact that it is\npublic money, i.e., money being raised from taxpayers\nunder a statute passed by the State authorizing\ntaxation; and it is going to -- and its justification\nfor taxation is the performance of public functions.\nAnd if the State can say it is not a proper public\nfunction when the money is being filtered through our\nparticular treasury, why isn't it equally valid for the\nState legislature to say that when the money is being\nfiltered through a local treasury?\nMR. COLLINS: For the following reason, I\nthink, Justice Souter. That -- the doctrine that says\nwhen a government is refusing to subsidize something\nthere is no violation in the first place in the First\nAmendment, and therefore except in the rarest, rarest of\ncases -- the rarest of cases there can be no First\nAmendment claim; that's very powerful medicine and it\nturns on the notion that -- somewhat alike but different\nfrom in detail the proprietor concept -- but it turns on\nthe notion that the government is making judgments about\nhow its money is going to be used. It decides what it\nwants its money to be used for, and we are going to\nhonor that --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but what you're saying\nis, I -- you're saying in effect that I -- that you\nreject my -- my hypothetical assumption here, that what\nwe ought to regard as the proper characterization of the\nmoney is not \"our\" State money, but public money raised\nunder a system of public taxation; and you're saying you\nshould not go -- you should not characterize the funds\nthat way.\nOf course that's your position --\nMR. COLLINS: No, I --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- because if you do\ncharacterize the funds that way, it seems to me you're\nin trouble.\nMR. COLLINS: Now --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But why shouldn't I\ncharacterize them that way?\nMR. COLLINS: The -- even characterizing --\neven characterizing it that way, the reason that I think\nthe analysis breaks down as to applying subsidization\nlaw, is that the subsidization law doctrine,\nsubsidization doctrine -- Regan and those cases -- as\nthe Court has explained it, it is to protect the\nprerogatives of the government that is making decisions\nabout how it wants particular programs to be operated.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: The State -- the State\nlegislature is making a decision as to how it wants the\n-- the programs which comprise local government to be\noperated.\nMR. SMITH: But the difference, Your Honor,\nin all of the other cases one could look at Regan and\nthe like, there is a program where the government is\ninvolved in its manifold details. The government\ndetermines the purpose of the program; it has an\noverriding interest in the program; and it says in the\ncourse of that, in the course of dealing with this\nprogram, we don't want government money to be used for\nthe following things.\nIf you -- if that were extended to say that\nthere will be essentially no First Amendment claim\nwhenever the government says as to some program that it\nhas no other involvement and that it has no other\ninterest in, we don't want the following speech, and\nover here we don't have the following speech --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, but the point in the\ncase that you concede that the government may make that\nchoice is that the government is subsidizing it by the\nactivity which the government is refusing to perform.\nSo it's not nearly a case of saying there shall be this\nkind of speech and not that kind of speech. In each\ninstance there is a decision being made in my\nhypothetical that the government will not subsidize that\nkind of activity, that kind of speech, by using public\nmoney.\nMR. COLLINS: But the difference for First\nAmendment analysis, I would submit, Your Honor, and the\nreason why I think the subsidization doctrine has been\nconfined in the areas it's been confined, is when we are\ntalking in this case, for example, about the State, the\nState determines whether it's going to have a payroll\ndeduction system. It determines whether it's going to\nallow deductions for charities; whether it's going to\nallow deductions for this that and the other. It\ndetermines who -- who's going to administer the program,\nhow expensive it's going to be, all of those things.\nIts money is going into that program and it is as to\nthat program making all of these decisions about how its\nmoney is going to be spent. That is -- and if the\ncourse of that it says we don't want this one, this\nelement as part of it just as we do want charitable, we\ndon't want political; maybe we don't want charitable\neither -- it is a different situation in items of basic\nFirst Amendment analysis, I believe, if you have a\ngovernment that's saying we don't care anything about\ngovernment payroll systems.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Collins, may I\ninterrupt you and ask you the converse of the question I\nasked your opponent?\nHe conceded that it was unconstitutionally\nwhat you call it, content discrimination -- whatever --\nto have the deduction from the private sector, but the\ncounties were different; and he justified the counties\non the ground that the State's interest in avoiding\ntaking a position with regard to union matters justifies\nit. But that's the only justification for the -- it's\nnot the administrative justification -- this statute\nwasn't enacted to save the government administrative\nexpenses. The purpose of the statute is perfectly\nclear, and I'm surprised that you concede that it's\nconstitutional as applied to the State government, when\nthere's no evidence whatsoever that it serves the\npurpose that everybody is talking about.\nMR. COLLINS: Your Honor, we conceded that\nreluctantly under the view that where the question is\nwhether the State -- our claim against the State would\nsay we are -- we are going to require the State to start\ndevoting money that it doesn't want to spend as we -- we\nhave chosen given the force of cases like Regan, not to\nmake that contention, but to accept the ruling that the\nState's refusal to spend money on its own programs is in\na different category.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But this is not a case\ninvolving a State's decision not to spend the time and\nenergy to do payroll deductions because they do them for\neverybody else. It's simply based on the reason for the\npayroll deduction, which is, in your view, an\nimpermissible reason. Is that not correct.\nMR. COLLINS: That's correct, Your Honor.\nAnd if it were clear that as to what kinds of reasons\nare considered impermissible under subsidization --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: How can it not be clear?\nIt enacted a general statute that had the same\njustification throughout the State. And now you're\njustifying on the ground it doesn't apply to all their\nother government activities because they allow payroll\ndeductions.\nMR. COLLINS: Well, in Davenport, Your\nHonor, the Court did indicate that a statute that\napplies to public and private, even though it's a\nunitary statute, you have to analyze it separately in\nthe two contexts.\nBut our point, though -- I think the point\nthat is being lost, we don't see this as a question\nabout what can the State do with respect to its own\noperations as such and what can it do with respect to\nlocal government operations. We see it as a case that\nasks the question whether a content distinction directed\nat certain kinds of political activities that would\nnormally require heightened scrutiny gets the pass from\nthat scrutiny because it's in a \"forum\"?\nAnd we -- our position is quite simply that\nif the State were, in fact, managing these local\ngovernment payroll systems, which it would have a\nperfect right to do, that then it could avail itself of\nthat analysis, but because it doesn't, it cannot.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I see your argument.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose the State at the\nState level says this is a contentious area, we want to\nstay out of it. We are going to be neutral. We are\nsimply not allowing payroll deduction for right to work\nclauses, for union clauses. We don't want this. If the\nState can say that, and your concession indicates to me\nthat it can, then why can't it tell its subdivisions you\nhave to be efficient, we don't want arguments from one\ncity to the next city about payroll deduction that's\ngoing to consume the time of the city council's, the\ntime of the citizens, we want to take this off the table\nfor you just the way we've taken it off the table for\nus?\nMR. COLLINS: Because I think the difference\nhere, Your Honor, as I understand the case law, is that\nwhen the State is simply saying we choose not to spend\nour own money on this activity, it does not have the\nsame burden of explaining why it's made that choice that\nit has when it reaches out and says, and by the way, we\ndon't want local government or even private government\n--\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, of course, that's\nthe interest. This is a very strong Federal interest in\nallowing the States to organize their governmental\nsystems the way they choose. Our gun control\nregistration case, where we said the Federal Government\ncannot tell the counties that it has certain duties for\ngun control.\nMR. COLLINS: And we have no quarrel at all\nwith that notion. Our position in no way dictates, in\nno way has the First Amendment dictating how a State is\ngoing to structure its government. It simply says,\nlook, we begin with the proposition that normally this\nrestriction on public speech would be heightened to\npublic scrutiny.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I -- I -- I'm not sure\nthat's right. I'm not sure the State isn't saying we\nwant to determine how our government is structured in\nthis respect.\nMR. COLLINS: If the -- if the State wants\nto have a uniform law for itself -- for public\nemployer -- employees, its own employees and local\ngovernment employees because of some unitary interest\nthat the State wants to pursue, there is nothing wrong\nwith the state pursuing that objective. But when it\ndoes it through restricting political speech, it has to\neither satisfy heightened scrutiny or come within one of\nthe exceptions.\nAnd the distinction -- maybe I can put it\nthis way, Justice Kennedy. The reason why for First\nAmendment scrutiny analysis, there is a sharp\ndistinction in this case between what the State's\ntreatment of its own employees and the State treatment\nof local governments is -- I think it's basically\nthreefold.\nThat, first, when the State says, we don't\nchoose to allow certain speech in our own forum, it is\nsimply declining to facilitate speech that couldn't take\nplace without an affirmative grant. When it says to\nlocal governments, who in the state of nature can allow\nwhatever they want in the way of speech, when it says\nthat there we will not allow these kinds of deductions,\nit's blocking speech that would take place but for the\ngovernment's intervention. And so --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I'll read Russo again, but\nI didn't think Pocatello, Idaho, was part of the state\nof major.\nMR. COLLINS: I just meant that no -- it's\nthis simple, Justice Kennedy, and the point I'm trying\nto make is that for someone to get access to\npolitical -- to a payroll deduction system of the State\ngovernment, it needs an affirmative grant from the\nState. To have access to the use of payroll deduction\nfrom local governments, it doesn't need an affirmative\ngrant from the State. It simply needs the State not to\ninterfere and reject the local government.\nSo it's -- it's a different kind of action.\nBut equally important, the basis for the kind of relaxed\nscrutiny that the -- that the Petitioners have argued\nfor, the forum cases like Cornelius, et cetera, those\nare all situations where a government, that is, that has\nestablished and managed a facility is determining on a\nday-to-day basis what's the purpose of our program, what\nare we going to allow --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Could you help me with\nthis? Would you object if we analyzed this as a\nconstitutional condition case? I don't know that you\nwould prevail or not. But it -- the forum analysis\ndoesn't seem to me to quite fit.\nMR. COLLINS: It's fine with me, but if you\nanalyze it in any way that says that heightened scrutiny\nis applicable and there is no exception --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Why is that?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. COLLINS -- the problem with\nconstitutional condition -- if it were a condition on\nthe local governments, then it's not really --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Are you saying -- is it\nyour view that heightened scrutiny applies whenever a\ngovernment tells any group that wants to raise money for\npolitical purposes in any way they want involving the\ngovernment that it can't?\nMR. COLLINS: No, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: No. Okay. I thought the\nanswer would be no.\nThen, will you try to say in a sentence or\ntwo if the answer is it heightened scrutiny doesn't\napply to any kind of an effort to raise money for\npolitical purposes where they say to the government you\ngot to help me, when does it apply and when doesn't it?\nMR. COLLINS: The -- well, there are\nexceptions to heightened scrutiny where the government\nis acting as a proprietor. There are exceptions to\nheightened scrutiny where the government --\nJUSTICE BREYER: But then you are making --\nsay it always applies except in a few little exceptions.\nI mean I know there is one for government speech and so\nforth. But you're saying whenever the government tells\na person you can't, for example, go to the city hall and\nraise money, you can't do it in the jury room, you can't\nraise money here, you can't raise money there, dah, dah,\ndah, or you can't speak there, you can't -- it's always\nheightened scrutiny?\nMR. COLLINS: Well, if the government is\nallowing other speech it would be heightened scrutiny.\nJUSTICE BREYER: You cannot -- you have to\nuse heightened scrutiny when the FDA, for example -- you\nknow, the case I wrote in -- the FDA says you cannot\nadvertise on a label for a drug. We don't want\nadvertising. We don't want advertising on the label.\nThat's heightened scrutiny.\nMR. COLLINS: It -- if it's -- if it's\ncommercial speech, it might fall under a different\nstandard. It would easily pass it is the point. I\nmean, this is no question that a lot of situations\neasily pass heightened scrutiny, and a lot of\ncircumstances are an exception. And the problem in this\ncase is that the Petitioner's sole submission --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And regulation of\ngovernment employees is the same?\nMR. COLLINS: It basically would trigger\nthe -- the heightened scrutiny except where the\ngovernment is involved. When the government is involved\nin managing employees in just as when it's managing a\nforum, there -- there could be a different analysis.\nBut the problem -- where the shoe doesn't\nfit the Petitioner's are trying to put on this case is\nPetitioner's concede everything there is to concede\nabout this case and then say but it's just like\nCornelius, and it's just the government deciding what to\ndo with its own programs. And our point is quite simply\nthat unlike every case where the court has applied\nrelaxed scrutiny in a proprietary situation, this is a\ncase where the government does not play any role with\nrespect to the -- to limit the speech.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why are you -- why\nare you focusing on heightened scrutiny? We have a\nwhole series of cases about employee speech Darcetti and\nPickering where it's quite different than heightened\nscrutiny, and here we are talking about the employees\nbeing able to deduct checkoffs from their paycheck for\npolitical speech?\nMR. COLLINS: If I may answer that question,\nMr. Chief Justice? It's correct that where a law is\nbased on employee behavior, that other kinds of scrutiny\ncan be involved. Darcetti is, obviously if it's speech\nin your capacity of doing your job.\nBut the Hatch Act cases, letter carriers use\nthe Pickering balance. That's not a mere reasonableness\ntest by a long shot. That's a comparison as in the\nNT -- National Treasury Employees honoraria case, same\nsituation, a balancing test between the harm that's\nperceived from allowing the speech and the benefits of\nthe speech to the individual.\nSo, there can be that separate analysis,\nwhich if it were applied here, the State would also\nfail. The State, it says it only prevails under a\nreasonableness test. But none of those are near\nreasonableness analyses.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Smith, you have one minute.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CLAY R. SMITH\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. SMITH: Two points that I think are\ncritical. First, the concession with respect to the\nState government employees based on Regan it itself\nentails a concession as to the reasonableness and the\ndue point neutrality of the statute.\nTwo, Respondents' theory of government with\nrespect to the legislature having to speak in some kind\nof specific term, we would suggest, ignores -- would ask\nthis Court to create entirely new case law. But it also\nignores in this situation the fact that the Idaho\nlegislature contributes in 2006-2007 about half of the\nfunds used by school districts in the State. And over\n80 percent of those funds that go into what is known as\na general maintenance and operations fund from which\nsalary compensation is paid.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
