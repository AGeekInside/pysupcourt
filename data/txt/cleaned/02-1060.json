Lidster.\nMr. Feinerman.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF GARY FEINERMAN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. FEINERMAN: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and\nmay it please the Court:\nA Lombard informational checkpoint was designed\nto find witnesses to a specific known crime. The\nprincipal question here is whether the checkpoint is per\nse invalid under the Fourth Amendment or whether it's\ngoverned by the Brown balancing test. Now, the touchstone\nof the Fourth Amendment is reasonableness, which generally\nis measured by balancing the Government interest advanced\nby a seizure against the intrusion on the individual and\nthis Court has held that road - roadway checkpoints,\nincluding those that serve a law enforcement purpose, are\ngoverned by the balancing factors set forth in Brown v.\nTexas.\nNow, in Edmond, an exception was carved for a\ncertain category of law enforcement checkpoints, those\nthat are designed to advance the general interest in crime\ncontrol. The Court held in Edmond that crime control\ncheckpoints are not subject to a balancing analysis, but\nrather are per se invalid. The Illinois Supreme Court in\nthis case held that informational checkpoints, including\nthe Lombard checkpoint here, fall within that general\ncrime control exception. That was an error. Per se\ninvalidity under the Fourth Amendment is very strong\nmedicine and ought to be reserved for exceptional\ncircumstances, and those circumstances -\nQUESTION: Well, I suppose we'd have to decide\nhere not only whether it was per se invalid, but whether\nit was reasonable under any other standard.\nMR. FEINERMAN: That's correct, Justice O'Connor.\nQUESTION: And let me ask you, is it often that\nroadblocks are set up just to get information like this?\nMR. FEINERMAN: I - I would rely on the amicus\nbriefs submitted by the Illinois Association of Chiefs of\nPolice and the Major Cities Chiefs Association, and they -\nthey have informed the Court that roadblocks are not used\nfrequently, rather they are used judiciously in order to\nsolve certain -\nQUESTION: This was a little odd. It was a week\nlater?\nMR. FEINERMAN: It was a week later, but there\nwas a very good reason why the checkpoint was set up at\nthat particular place and at that particular time. There\nwas a fatal hit-and-run accident at about midnight on a\nFriday night. There were no witnesses, at least\npedestrian witnesses, and the Lombard police reasonably\nconcluded that, because people's driving habits, or at\nleast some people's driving habits might be regular, that\nsome of the drivers that were there on the night in\nquestion would also be driving the same route at the same\ntime at the same place one week later, and we -\nQUESTION: The - the - you - you said that they\nhad to be used judiciously and that's a good word, but our\n- do our precedents in this area generally say, well, we\ndefer to the good judgement of the police, they won't use\nthem too often. The Illinois Supreme Court said, oh, if\nwe allow this, we're going to have roadblocks every other\n- every day, every other street and in part that's\nhyperbole, but on the other hand, it does caution us that\nthere should be some limiting principle and I just don't\nknow if our precedents would support us in adopting your\nword, oh, if it's used judiciously.\nMR. FEINERMAN: Well, it's used judiciously for a\nnumber of reasons. One are the resource limitations.\nThese kinds of roadblocks are very resource-intensive.\nThere's also the prudential limits that the police\ndepartments place upon themselves. They don't want to\nappear too intrusive to the public and this is a - a minor\ninconvenience and the -\nQUESTION: What if that isn't enough? What if\nthey - they're squandering their resources? You have a\ndumb police chief who's - who's using most of his\nresources in fruitless roadblocks. What do we do then?\nMR. FEINERMAN: Then the courts step in and apply\nthe Brown reasonableness factors.\nQUESTION: Well, what - that's what I'm asking.\nWhat makes this reasonable that wouldn't make other ones\nreasonable? What would be unreasonable? A - a general\nroadblock asking about general crime - you know, sir, have\nyou seen any crime committed in the last 6 months,\nsomething like that? Would that be -\nMR. FEINERMAN: That would be closer - that would\nbe closer to the situation that was presented in Edmond,\nalthough it wouldn't - it wouldn't present one of the\nhallmarks of what we believe is a general crime control\nroadblock, which is that it's the goal of the police to\nincriminate the motorists as opposed to simply seek\ninformation.\nQUESTION: No, it wouldn't - it wouldn't come\nwithin that, but you think that that would - would be\ninvalid even though you would support these informational\nroadblocks in some circumstances?\nMR. FEINERMAN: That - that question, of course,\nisn't presented here, but I - I -\nQUESTION: No kidding.\nMR. FEINERMAN: - I understand, but our - I - I\nsuppose we would say that such roadblocks should not be\ndeclared per se invalid under the Fourth Amendment, but\nrather they ought to be subject to the Brown balancing\ntest.\nQUESTION: You going to answer my question?\nWould that one be invalid or not?\nMR. FEINERMAN: It would depend upon the\ncircumstances. We could -\nQUESTION: I gave you the circumstances. It's a\ngeneral roadblock. They stop everybody who comes along\nsimply for the purpose of asking, sir or madam, have you\nseen a crime committed within the last 6 months?\nMR. FEINERMAN: I think there - there would be -\nQUESTION: What other circumstances do you need?\nWhether it's raining or not?\nMR. FEINERMAN: No.\nQUESTION: Okay. Now, can you give me -\nMR. FEINERMAN: I can't -\nQUESTION: - a yes or no? Is that good or bad?\nMR. FEINERMAN: It's, in my most instances it\nwould be bad, but -\nQUESTION: Okay.\nMR. FEINERMAN: - I - I don't know if we could\nforeclose the possibility that there might be some\ncircumstances were such a roadblock would be reasonable.\nFor example, let's assume that in - in some area of some\ncity that there's just rapid lawlessness because of a\nblackout or whatever and there are hundreds of crimes\ncommitted and the police might want to canvass the\nneighborhood but nobody wants to be seen talking to a\npolice officer. So in that instance perhaps a roadblock\nwould be set up where the police would hand each motorist\na piece of paper saying, you don't have to talk to me now\nbut here's a number, and if you know of anything that had\nhappened that was unlawful, please feel free to give us a\ncall, we'll maintain our confidentiality.\nQUESTION: Well, what - what about -\nQUESTION: Mr. -\nQUESTION: - a road - roadblock that you find in\nperhaps some smaller towns where the police just very\nbriefly stop you and ask you to contribute to the police\nboys fund.\nMR. FEINERMAN: I'm - I'm not sure that would be\na - a crime control roadblock.\nQUESTION: I don't think it is.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. FEINERMAN: That - that perhaps would be\nvalid and now it would be a better practice, of course, if\nthe police were to simply approach cars that were stopped\nat a stoplight or a stop sign or a tollbooth.\nQUESTION: If you had that kind of a roadblock\nand one of the drivers just about ran into the policeman,\ndo you think that the court - the courts would entertain\nthe argument that, well, the initial stop was invalid,\ntherefore running into the policeman - it cannot be\ngrounds for the arrest? I - it's just a clumsy way of\nasking, I guess, whether - whether or not there is any\nkind of a causation break here, causation link problem.\nMR. FEINERMAN: Yeah, we - that - that argument\nperhaps could been made below but it wasn't, and as this\ncase comes to this Court, the assumption is that if - if\nthe roadblock were invalid under the Fourth Amendment,\nthen the subsequent arrest would be as well. Even though\nthe - the - Mr. Lidster almost running into the police\nofficer did provide cause, that question's not presented\nhere.\nQUESTION: Mr. Feinerman, may I go back to your\nown hypothetical of a moment ago in which this crime has\nbeen committed, people don't want to be seen talking to\nthe police, so the police might set up a roadblock under\nthose circumstances. What about the same situation in\nwhich the police say - and I suppose it would be\nreasonable in your hypo that they need to talk to a lot\nmore people than simply the ones who were driving in cars\n- on your reasoning, could the police, in effect, cordon\noff sidewalks so that any pedestrian coming down the\nsidewalk would have to pass through sort of a chute at the\nend and could not get through with stopping to talk to the\npolice officer and answer questions in order to get\nthrough?\nMR. FEINERMAN: No, Justice Souter, because\npedestrians have greater Fourth Amendment rights than\nmotorists.\nQUESTION: Well, they - they - they do in the\nsense that we - we recognize certain rights to stop the\nmotorist because of the regulated nature and the highly\ndangerous nature of the - of the driving enterprise. But\nhere we're talking about stops which bear absolutely no\nrelation to the regulation of motor vehicles. The only\nreason for the stop in the case that you're defending, and\nthe only reason for the stop in my hypo is that there may\nbe an opportunity to gather evidence from a citizen who\nwon't come forward but would answer a question. So it\nseems to me that the difference between cars and\npedestrians has nothing to do with the - the - the answer\nto my question. Am I wrong there?\nMR. FEINERMAN: I believe so, Your Honor, with\nrespect. It would be permissible with motorists. It\nwouldn't be permissible with pedestrians because motorists\ndo not have the same expectation of freedom of movement\nthat pedestrians do.\nQUESTION: No, but the - no, but the\njustification for interfering with their freedom of\nmovement is not the justification that's involved in this\nstop. You're not looking for impaired motorists. You're\nnot checking licenses and registrations. You're simply\nstopping motorists because they might have seen a crime,\nand in the extension of your hypo I'm talking about the\npedestrian who might have seen a crime or have some\nevidence of it. They're in exactly the same situation.\nIf you can stop the cars, why can't you stop the\npedestrians?\nMR. FEINERMAN: Again, I - I just have to rely on\nmy prior answer. It's because this Court has held that in\ncertain - in certain situations, suspicionless roadway\nstops are permissible, or at least subject - potentially\npermissible and subject to the Brown balancing test.\nQUESTION: Does one have a - in - is it - a\ngreater sense of privacy walking down a main thoroughfare\nthan being in a car? I understand the distinction between\na home or an office, but you're out there on the street\nand the police could make - could - the police could go to\nany particular pedestrian and say, could you tell me if\nyou know anything about X crime that was committed in this\nneighborhood and the police could do that?\nMR. FEINERMAN: That's correct. The police can\nwalk up to any pedestrian and ask questions and that's not\na seizure under the Fourth Amendment.\nQUESTION: Can they make the pedestrian stop? I\nmean, I'm walking along, the police says, excuse me, sir,\ncan I ask - I say, no, I'm too busy, and I keep walking.\nMR. FEINERMAN: No.\nQUESTION: Can they arrest me for keeping on\nwalking?\nMR. FEINERMAN: No. That's Brown v. Texas. The\npolice cannot do that, but -\nQUESTION: So why can they do it with a car? Is\nthat what happened here? Suppose this car were in first\ngear as it cruised, you know, rolled up to the roadblock\nand the same thing happened, the policeman said, I want to\nask you, you know, sir, I'd like to ask you a question.\nI'm sorry, I'm too busy, just keeps rolling on through.\nWould - would he have been arrested in this roadblock?\nMR. FEINERMAN: If - if he's - if he rolled on\nthrough and - or - or if he stopped and said, I don't like\n- I don't want to -\nQUESTION: He didn't stop at all. He kept\nrolling at a very slow speed and he just told the\npoliceman, I'm sorry, I'm too busy.\nMR. FEINERMAN: The - the record doesn't reflect\nwhether any such instances happened and that would be a\nclose -\nQUESTION: He'd be arrested, let's - he'd be\narrested pretty -\nMR. FEINERMAN: Perhaps he would be arrested for\nnot following -\n(Laughter.)\nMR. FEINERMAN: Perhaps he would be arrested for\nnot following the police officer's -\nQUESTION: Well, now -\nMR. FEINERMAN: - instruction, but really the -\nQUESTION: Do - do you think he could do the same\nthing with a - with a pedestrian?\nMR. FEINERMAN: No, no. And that's Brown v.\nTexas. Pedestrians cannot be seized for this purpose and\nthat this -\nQUESTION: Well, now, in the Edmonds case, the\nCourt opinion said that under exigent circumstances there\ncould be some kind of a - an appropriately tailored\nroadblock. Do you take the position that trying to find a\nwitness was some kind of an exigent circumstance here?\nMR. FEINERMAN: No. Our position is not that\nthere are exigent circumstances. Our position is that\nthis is not a general crime control roadblock. A crime -\nQUESTION: When you make your balance under\nBrown, do you - does the time that it takes to answer the\nofficer's inquiry the relevant factor or the time you have\nto wait in line if there's a big - it's a crowded street,\nyou know, they - you cause a traffic jam, you have to wait\n20 minutes?\nMR. FEINERMAN: It's our position that it's only\nthe time that - of the police-motorist encounter.\nQUESTION: So that even if in fact the delay\ncaused the - a bunch of people a half hour's delay, that\nwould be irrelevant?\nMR. FEINERMAN: In - in our - we - we - if - were\nthat question presented, we would say that that's\nirrelevant because that's simply endemic. That's just a\nbyproduct of driving.\nQUESTION: It's a byproduct of the seizure of one\nperson that you got to wait - wait in turn to be seized\nyourself.\nMR. FEINERMAN: That's true, and - but what's -\nthe reason why - the police don't want there to be a line.\nThe police just want to talk to each motorist as they're\ndriving by.\nQUESTION: No, but if - if you're on a busy\nstreet, as they were in - in - I forget which suburb of\nChicago this was -\nQUESTION: Lombard.\nQUESTION: - in Lombard, you're gonna - you're\ngonna tie up traffic for a while.\nMR. FEINERMAN: Yeah, I should mention - I should\nmention that Mr. Lidster at his trial, at page 47 of the\ntranscript, testified that there were only three cars in\nfront of him. So he was stopped really for - at most only\na minute, which is permissible. But were there a case as\nin your hypothetical where a motorist were stopped for a\nhalf an hour, we would still say that that waiting time\ndoesn't count because that's really more a function of the\nnumber of vehicles on the street and it's not really - it\nwas not intended by the officer that there be this backup.\nQUESTION: I - I suppose part of the\nreasonableness inquiry has to be what alternatives were\navailable to achieve the same objective. And why couldn't\nthe police just have had a big sign on the side of the\nroad, one of those, you know, illuminated signs that they\nhave now, which said, you know, please help us, looking\nfor hit-and-run -\nMR. FEINERMAN: It -\nQUESTION: - last week, something like that. And\nthen those people who are willing to cooperate could pull\nover and cooperate and those - those who want to have\nnothing to do with it can keep on moving.\nMR. FEINERMAN: That would be possible, but this\nCourt has said very clearly that a less restrictive means\ntest is not to be applied under the second Brown factor.\nQUESTION: I'm not applying the least - least\nrestrictive means test, but surely one of the - one of the\nfactors in determining whether this was reasonable is\nwhether you could have done - achieved the same objective\nin - in some other manner.\nMR. FEINERMAN: That's correct. That is a factor\nand - but these kinds of signs or billboards, it isn't\nlike it just says, drink Budweiser or fly United Airlines,\nthere's a lot of information on there, and if these cars\nare -\nQUESTION: It might distract drivers if - if a\nbig sign on the road - on the highway when you're supposed\nto be looking at the road. That might be a reason, but\nthere's a - there's an aspect of this, you've repeated the\npolice many times, and one of the worrisome things of this\nset-up is all you need is a crime, and in major\nmetropolitan areas there are crimes, multiple crimes every\nday. Who makes the decision? The local police chief.\nAnd then after some, you can get into court. It's - it's\nnot like the law dictates this or even the State's\nAttorney General, but it's in every town, the local police\nchief that may have just a range of views about using\nroadblocks.\nMR. FEINERMAN: That - that's what the Brown\nbalancing test is there for. It's there to determine what\nkinds of stops are reasonable and which one aren't. Now,\nif there are some circumstances where we can imagine that\nwe'd want to have this kind of informational checkpoint,\nthen a - and that's really the principal question here.\nThere ought not to be a per se rule, because there are\nsome situations, and we submit that this is one of them,\nwhere it makes perfect sense for the police to set up a\nroadblock because the physical evidence recovered from the\nscene was not sufficient to identify the perpetrator, and\nthe only witnesses to the crime were fellow motorists, and\nthere was really only one way our - there wasn't only one\nway, but this was a very good way of getting at them. And\nif there are circumstances where we can imagine that we'd\nwant to enable the police to solve crimes in this manner,\nthen a per se rule is invalid. It ought to go through\nBrown balancing.\nQUESTION: You - you mentioned that this is a\ngood way to get at the people you want to get to. Is\nthere any indication that there - anything of value was\nobtained in the investigation of this crime in this\nparticular roadblock, or do you have any information\nacross the - from - from broader statistics across the\nnation about the effectiveness of doing this?\nMR. FEINERMAN: I have no statistics from across\nthe nation and I'd have to go outside the record to answer\nyour question. The Lombard police asked the local news to\nactually cover the roadblock, which they did, and somebody\nwho was watching the local news realized that a gentleman\nin her apartment complex had recently had damage to the\nright headlight of his F-150 and called -\nQUESTION: If - if the police had - if the police\nhad asked the local news to - to broadcast a 2-minute clip\nof a police officer saying, we're having trouble finding\nthe perpetrator of this crime, please come forward,\nwouldn't that have gotten the same result?\nMR. FEINERMAN: Well, we have to -\nQUESTION: They wouldn't have done it, but I mean\n-\nMR. FEINERMAN: They may not have done that. If\n- if there are no further -\nQUESTION: - a roadblock is much more fun to\ncover.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. FEINERMAN: Justice Scalia makes a good\npoint, and I'd like to reserve the remainder of my time.\nQUESTION: Very well, Mr. Feinerman.\nMs. Millett, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF PATRICIA A. MILLETT\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES AS AMICUS CURIAE\nSUPPORTING THE PETITIONER\nMS. MILLETT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe reason a news story covering a - a hit-and-\nrun fatality, as in this case, is not as effective for a\nnumber of reasons. First of all, statistically, the\nmajority of Americans don't watch local news. More\nimportantly, there is significant value as - as has long\nbeen recognized when police deal with pedestrians and\napproach them, seeking their assistance in solving crimes,\nthere is significant value to having a police officer\napproach someone in a one-on-one manner in an effort to\nsolve a crime.\nFirst of all, the - the approach impresses on\npeople, who are otherwise very busy, the importance of the\nmatter before them and that this may be worth devoting\ntheir time. The police officer's one-on-one approach can\nadvise the person, in addition, that what you say might be\nsignificant even though you didn't see an accident.\nQUESTION: But can you stop the person? I mean,\nput it in a pedestrian context, do you think a police\nofficer can insist that the person stop, stand there, and\nlisten to his pitch?\nMS. MILLETT: No, absolutely not, Justice Scalia.\nThere is a long - just there is a long historic\ndistinction between cars and homes, there's a long\nhistoric distinction between cars and pedestrians, and the\nreason - as a practical matter, you have to have a very,\nvery brief seizure here to protect the life and limb of\nthe police officer while he tries to make this approach.\nThat's not needed when you're approaching pedestrians.\nQUESTION: Why - why does the distinction -\nyou've mentioned it and - and Mr. Feinerman mentioned it -\nwhy does the distinction between cars and pedestrians\napply in a case in which the - the justification for\nmaking that distinction, regulation, a risk of impaired\ndriving, does not apply?\nMS. MILLETT: What - what is relevant is what\nthis Court has long recognized is - is the difference in\nyour reasonable expectations of freedom of movement\nbetween people in cars and pedestrians on the sidewalk.\nQUESTION: No, but my expectation of freedom of\nmovement in the car is that, yeah, the police can stop to\n- for a sobriety checkpoint and I'll assume they can -\nthey can stop to - to check my - my license and the\nregistration of the car, but I also assume that they\ncan't, you know, barring today, the result of today's\ncase, I - I'm assuming that they - they can't stop me for\n- for other reasons, barring some really exigent\ncircumstance. And if that expectation is reasonable, and\nI think it has been at least up until today, then I think\nmy expectation is - is the same as the pedestrian's\nexpectation, barring the - the regulatory authority of -\nof exercising the regulatory authority, which is not in -\nin issue here.\nMS. MILLETT: Justice Souter, the essential\ncommand of the Fourth Amendment is reasonableness, and\nthere's nothing in the Fourth Amendment that says stops\nfor sobriety or stops to see if you have any aliens in\nyour trunk are inherently reasonable and nothing else is.\nIt's a balancing test, as this Court has long recognized,\nand an important part of that balance is the expectations\nthat the individual brings to it, and the expectation of\nthe individual behind the wheel is that there are a number\nof times that I will come into contact with police\nofficers and I will need to stop, I'm highly regulated,\nI'm highly restricted, and I am engaged in a privilege of\ndriving on the public roadways. Walking is not a\nprivilege. Driving on the public roadways is and so the\nquestion -\nQUESTION: You're - you're saying that because\nthey might have observed or - or observed evidence in the\nexercise of their privilege that that would be a\nregulatory basis for stopping them in the cars, whereas\nthere wouldn't be any such basis for the pedestrian?\nMS. MILLETT: The regulatory need for it is that\nthere's - you have a very common police practice here, and\none that we expect the police to do if a - a fatality has\nbeen committed is try to find witnesses who were there at\nthe time. The only way that principle can work -\nQUESTION: And - and we understand that when -\nwhen there's something pretty contemporaneous between the\nstopping and the - and the accident. That's what I had in\nmind with exigency.\npractice that a week later or two weeks later -\nMS. MILLETT: It is extremely common for these\ntypes of informational checkpoints. There's two different\ntypes of checkpoints. There is the one that's trying to\ncatch the person right after the crime's been committed.\nQUESTION: Yeah.\nMS. MILLETT: But the witness checkpoints are\nquite routinely done, either 24 hours, or very routinely,\na week after, because people are creatures of habit and\nthey tend to drive the same roads at the same time of -\nthe same days, and so it's very common - a number - a\nnumber of Federal checkpoints have been done exactly like\nthis. They've been done a week after a child's been\nabducted. In the Elizabeth Smart case, it was a week\nlater. Federal checkpoints that I'm familiar with were\ndone exactly - exactly a week later, and you try to go at\nthe exact same time, because that is eminently sensible\nfor police officers. If you want to look for the\nwitnesses, you want to find people who are most likely to\nhave been there at the same time.\nQUESTION: Have they been successful? Is your\nknowledge of these things profound enough that you can say\nhow successful they've been?\nMS. MILLETT: I - I can't give you -\nQUESTION: Do you know of any that have been\nsuccessful?\nMS. MILLETT: Yes, absolutely. The - the Park\nPolice did one - the Federal Park Police did one here in\nthe Washington, D.C. area a couple years ago that found\nfour eyewitnesses to a hit-and-run fatality. But also,\nthe ability to measure success here - we're not talking\nabout immediately removing a drunk driver from the road or\nactually finding the alien - solving - you're successful\nif you defined you solved the crime, and solving a crime\nis not a linear project. It involves a lot of information\ncoming in from a different -\nQUESTION: But you couldn't - you couldn't do\nthis to try to get the perpetrator. That would clearly be\nEdmond, and there seems to be something odd about saying,\npolice, you can't have a roadblock in a neighborhood where\nyou think that it's likely the suspect is living, but you\ncan if you say what you're looking for, it's not the\nsuspect, but witnesses.\nMS. MILLETT: Justice Ginsburg, I - two\nresponses. First of all there are - Edmond leaves open\nthat there are at least some circumstances when you can do\nthis - maybe to approach is exigency - but where you can\ndo these types of checkpoints to catch someone. The\nlanguage there was a fleeing dangerous criminal who was\ngoing by particular routes, so it's not - that doesn't\nseem to be foreclosed in all circumstances. But the\nreason it makes a big differences for purposes of Fourth\nAmendment principles, there's actually three reasons why\nlooking for witnesses is better and should be more\nconsistent with the Fourth Amendment than what - the issue\nin Edmond. And that is, there - there's a difference\nbetween, just a practical difference, between police\ntaking action, seizing people first and looking for a\ncrime to go with them, which is what was going on in\nEdmond, or having a specific crime and looking to solve it\nin the most sensible and reasonable manner that police\nofficers do, and that is looking for witnesses.\nQUESTION: Well, following Justice Ginsburg's\nquestion, which is the easier of the two cases? The one\nwe have here or a hypothetical case in which they have a\ndescription of the hit-and-run driver and they stop\neverybody to look in the car to see if the driver meets\nthe description? Which is the easier of the two cases to\nsustain?\nMS. MILLETT: Assuming that this is not - it's\nnot right after the crime that I have the description -\nQUESTION: A week later, everything else the\nsame.\nMS. MILLETT: I think this Court's - I think both\nof them are different from Edmond, but I do think this\nCourt's doctrines establish why the witness approach is -\nis more - is less intrusive on Fourth Amendment interests\nfor - for three reasons. One is that there is a self-\nincrimination component, self-protection component to the\nFourth Amendment and that has been very important in the\ndrug testing cases. It was central to the resolution of\nthe Ferguson decision and mentioned in camera -\nQUESTION: I - I wonder if you'd answer Justice\nKennedy's question. Which is the easier case?\nMS. MILLETT: I - I'm -\nQUESTION: You don't know?\nMS. MILLETT: - oh, I'm sorry -\nQUESTION: Pardon me?\nMS. MILLETT: We would like to have them both\nsustained, quite frankly, and we don't think they're -\nthey're exactly covered by Edmond -\nQUESTION: Yes, yes, but which is more consistent\n- which is easier to say is consistent with the Fourth\nAmendment?\nMS. MILLETT: There -\nQUESTION: I would just - I'm mixed up with\neasier because I don't - which is - the two cases that he\ngave, in which do you think it's easier for you to win\nyour argument?\nMS. MILLETT: I - I think the witness one is\neasier for three reasons, and one is because the Fourth\nAmendment has this self-protection principle, which is not\nimplicated when you're - you're looking for witnesses.\nThe checkpoint does not -\nQUESTION: In other words, this case is easier?\nMS. MILLETT: Yes, yes, the witness checkpoint,\nthe looking for information checkpoint.\nQUESTION: All right. I got mixed up -\nMS. MILLETT: I'm sorry if I'm not -\nQUESTION: This case is easier?\nMS. MILLETT: Yes. This case is easier, but -\nbut there's - there's two other reasons besides the self-\nprotection principle. One is, as a practical matter, one\nof the balancing tests - factors - in Brown v. Texas is\nthe level of anxiety. When a police officer approaches\nyou and says - even if it's permissible - I want to know\nif you're doing something wrong. Do you not have a\ndriver's license? Are you drunk? That's - there's a\nlittle more anxiety there when a police - than when a\npolice officer comes and says, I would like your help,\nsomeone was killed here.\nQUESTION: And what's the third reason?\nMS. MILLETT: And - and the third -\nQUESTION: The Fourth Amendment is an anxiety\nthing? My goodness.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: That is a factor but -\nMS. MILLETT: It's all - it's all very - sorry.\nQUESTION: - that - that cuts against you in this\ncase, though, doesn't it? This was at midnight.\nMS. MILLETT: No, no. Part of the Brown v. Texas\nbalancing factors is - is of - one of the things that's\nbeen mentioned is the level of anxiety, and the reason\nthat you don't have roving stops but you're allowed to\nhave checkpoints is when you see other people being\nstopped around you, even if they want to know if you're\ndrunk -\nQUESTION: I have a pending question about the -\nthe third reason. I - what's the third reason?\nMS. MILLETT: The third - thank you - the third\nreason is - is a - is a - there's a sort of a practical\nlimitation on the use of these checkpoints when police are\nnot allowed to use it to do their run-of-the-mill\nbusiness. Their job is to find crimes and criminals.\nEdmond was a checkpoint to find crimes and criminals that\nwe didn't know about, when instead all that's being done\nhere is this is an adjunct to a - adapting to the roadway\ncontext the normal investigative processes of police\nofficers. You - you don't have that abuse, and the same\nway -\nQUESTION: So this is a built-in limitation on\nthe frequency of its use?\nMS. MILLETT: It is, and Justice Kennedy, you\nalso asked about doctrinal limitations in this Court's\ncases, and in Atwater v. City of Lago Vista the exact same\nargument was made dealing with misdemeanor arrests. And\nthis Court's decision there specifically relied upon the\ngood sense and political accountability of police, for the\nsame reason that we know police don't arrest for every\ncrime and infraction that - vehicle code infraction that\nthey find. A lot of police chiefs are arrested and\ncheckpoints are a great equalizer, especially these kind,\nbecause the location is dictated by where the crime\noccurred -\nQUESTION: Arrested or elected? What - did you\nsay arrested or elected? That a lot of police chiefs are\n-\nMS. MILLETT: Oh, I hope I said elected.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: Okay. I thought you said arrested.\nMS. MILLETT: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Ms. Millett.\nMr. Ramsell, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD J. RAMSELL\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. RAMSELL: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe mass, suspicionless seizure of innocent\ncitizens for the purpose of investigating ordinary\ncriminal wrongdoing without exigent circumstances is a\nviolation of the Fourth Amendment, and Indianapolis v.\nEdmond is the controlling precedent.\nQUESTION: Well, that sounds a little colorful,\nbut - but in my own mind I'm thinking that this is asking\npeople to help with crime investigation and to spend 10\nseconds listening to the request. Now, it's - I was\ndelayed 2 hours - not 2 hours, but like 2 minutes anyway,\nor 3 minutes, this morning coming in, for the last couple\nof days because they had some tree pruning equipment, all\nright? So maybe they could put that on the sidewalk and\nnot delay me, but I don't mind. I did actually mind, but\nI mean -\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: - but - you see, it's not - what their\nargument is, and that's, at least for me, what I'd like\nyou to address, is this is not much of a - of a demand on\npeople to stop for 10 seconds when they're trying to find\nout somebody who killed someone and - and we just want you\nto listen for 10 seconds. Now, why - why is that such an\nunreasonable thing for the police to ask the public to do?\nNobody has to take the flyer, they don't even have to\nhelp.\nMR. RAMSELL: Well, Justice Breyer, by definition\nthis is a seizure.\nQUESTION: I - I don't care about the - I'm\nasking you - I understand - I'm asking you why it's\nunreasonable. That's the word in the Fourth Amendment and\nI tried to make it as - as reasonable-sounding as I could.\nMaybe somebody else could do better, but I want your\nresponse to my effort to make this sound very reasonable.\nThat's what I'm interested in, your response.\nMR. RAMSELL: It remains unreasonable for a\nnumber of matters. It's the aggregate of the\ncircumstances then by which other innocent persons could\nbe seized. It's the fact that the gravity of the public\nconcern in this particular event is far less than the\nreasonableness - reasonableness factors that have been\nused in Sitz. It's far less than the immigration factor\nthat was found in Martinez v. Fuerte.\nQUESTION: I don't really want to hear cases so\nmuch. I want to hear in common sense why this isn't a\nreasonable thing to do. I'm not saying you even have to\nconvince me to win your case, I'm just saying that for -\nI'd like to know why, in ordinary, common-sense English,\nthis isn't the most reasonable thing in the world? Now,\nI'm - I'm now overstating it so you'll be sure to give me\nan answer.\nMR. RAMSELL: It's midnight. You're on a road\nwhere you do not expect to be confronted by a police\nofficer. You're waiting in line for several minutes as\nvarious other cars are evidently being interrogated, some\nare being transferred to secondary staging areas. The\nanxiety builds and you arrive at the front of the\nroadblock to be questioned about where you were last week,\npersonal indications, what have you seen? You feel\ncompelled to answer.\nQUESTION: I didn't think that was the evidence.\nI thought they were given a flyer saying if you - read\nthis and see if you observed anything that could help us\nfind the hit-and-run driver.\nMR. RAMSELL: Detective Vasil testified that they\nwere stopped, given a flyer, but also asked if they had\nbeen in the area last week and if they had seen anything\nunusual. That second phase was relatively\ninterrogational, although field interrogational.\nNevertheless, it is somewhat intrusive on what are\nconsidered some of our privacy -\nQUESTION: Well, suppose that there is a\nroadblock but the only purpose of the roadblock is the\npolice are stopping people to see if they'll contribute to\nthe police boys fund. The same thing - exactly the same\nthing happens with that roadblock has happened with your\nclient. He comes up, almost hits the policeman, smells\nalcohol on his breath and so forth, he's charged with\ndrunken driving and is convicted. Does he have a Fourth\nAmendment claim?\nMR. RAMSELL: Well, Mr. Chief Justice, it would\nbe a seizure, so the Fourth Amendment is implicated.\nHowever, applying the Edmond analysis, the programmatic\npurpose of that seizure not being in the investigation or\ndetection of crime, I would submit it would not be a\nviolation of the Fourth Amendment.\nQUESTION: So they can hold him up for 2 hours if\nthey're collecting for the police boys fund but they can't\nhold him up for 10 or 15 seconds if they're trying to\nsolve a crime?\nQUESTION: That doesn't make any sense. Or hold\nhim up for no reason at all, just for a lark. Hey, let's\nhold up a bunch of people.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: You - you say that passes the Fourth\nAmendment test but if - but - but this very reasonable\ninvestigation does not. That can't be right.\nMR. RAMSELL: I - I would submit, Justice Scalia,\nthat if you were to stop a person and seize them for no\nreason whatsoever that that would not survive a Fourth\nAmendment analysis. Ten to 15 seconds to deliver some\nfunds and put them in a can would certainly be reasonable\nfor that beneficent, non-crime control purpose. Two hours\nwould certainly exceed -\nQUESTION: Are you saying it would be okay to\nhave a roadblock to collect for the policemen's benevolent\nfund?\nMR. RAMSELL: Compulsive collection would be\nquestionable. That would seem to be a tax.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: I think if we endorsed -\nMR. RAMSELL: But we do -\nQUESTION: - your view that they can stop for the\nchief just as a purpose, there's going to be massive\nchange in the way these organizations raise money.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. RAMSELL: It - it is often difficult to say\nno when - when a fireman is seeking some funds. However,\nit is certainly not the detection or investigation of\ncrime, and the analysis that would take place there would\nbe different, and certainly 2 hours to put money in a can\nwould suggest that the scope and duration of that stop was\nfar beyond what was reasonable.\nQUESTION: Maybe - maybe your response to Justice\nBreyer's question - I'm not sure that reasonableness for\nFourth Amendment purposes is the same as reasonableness in\ngeneral. Do you think it would be - in general, if you're\nnot talking about the Fourth Amendment - an unreasonable\nthing for a policeman to knock on your door and say,\nexcuse me, sir, we're investigating a crime, we really\nneed your help, do you mind if I - I come in and ask you a\ncouple of questions just to help us solve this crime? Do\nyou think that's reasonable in - in - in a sense? I guess\nit is.\nMR. RAMSELL: It is considered a voluntary\nencounter to the extent that if you choose to open the\ndoor and engage in that conversation the Fourth Amendment\nisn't even implicated there.\nQUESTION: No, the person says, unreasonably says\nno, and the policeman comes in anyway.\nMR. RAMSELL: That would be a violation of the\nFourth Amendment.\nQUESTION: Even though it isn't really the\npoliceman that's being unreasonable in the general sense.\nIt seems to me it's quite unreasonable for the homeowner\nto refuse to cooperate at all with the police in the - in\nthe solving of a - let's assume it's a major crime. That\nseems to me unreasonable, but even so, the policeman is\nnot allowed to come into the home.\nMR. RAMSELL: That's correct, Your Honor, and\nthere's the difference between the voluntary consensual\nencounter and what we have in this case was clearly\ninvoluntary. They even had an officer -\nQUESTION: And so also here. It might be very\nunreasonable for the person not to want to cooperate, and\nit might be quite reasonable for the policeman to seek the\ncooperation, but that doesn't necessarily answer the\nFourth Amendment question.\nMR. RAMSELL: I would suggest that the fact that\nan innocent motorist would feel that he or she was\nunreasonable by not cooperating suggests the compulsive\naspects of this scenario, make it more of a violation of\nthe Fourth Amendment, and more unreasonable to that\nextent. One -\nQUESTION: Mr. Ramsell, did I understand your\nargument to be that if the crime had been a child\nabduction, that this kind of roadblock to try to get\nevidence would be permissible?\nMR. RAMSELL: In - in a general sense, yes. Of\ncourse, there would be other factors involved, but child\nabductions generally fall within the exigent circumstance\nanalysis. Clearly there would likely have to be further\nevaluation of the facts behind why they felt that -\nQUESTION: Well, why if - if it's the danger\ninvolved and wanting to save a life that we hope is still\nin being, why isn't the same thing if you're trying to get\nevidence about a hit-and-run person who kills people on\nthe highway?\nMR. RAMSELL: Well, first off, the child\nabduction is a continuing crime, to the extent that the\nneed for action in order to prevent the passable future or\nimmediate harm to that child, makes that an exigent\ncircumstance by itself.\nQUESTION: So you think this would be different\nif this was a serial hit-and-run killer, right? He does\none a week. Then - then you think it'd be a different\nsituation and maybe they could conduct the - the\nroadblock.\nMR. RAMSELL: Well, as we had in Sitz with the\nimminent hazard of drunk drivers, if there were such a\nthing as a serial hit-and-run driver, the imminency, the\nexigency would be suggested within that hypothetical, and\nso I believe that it would be more reasonable under that\ncircumstance, but what we -\nQUESTION: And what about a rape murder that -\nyou know that that's not just a hypothetical case?\nMR. RAMSELL: That had recently occurred?\nQUESTION: A rape murder recently occurred and\nthe police set up a roadblock to get evidence.\nMR. RAMSELL: Again, if there was - if it was\nvery fresh, and the more fresh it is the more reasonable\nit tends to become under a simply an exigency analysis,\nthe fresher the crime the more believability -\nQUESTION: So would this - would this case have\nbeen different if it had been the next day rather than a\nweek later?\nMR. RAMSELL: If they had some independent\nevidence to suggest that the person was still in the area,\nthat may have been a different set of facts. Commonwealth\nv. Burns was an example of a informational roadblock where\nthey had independent evidence to believe that the murderer\nwas still in the area. I believe that was 2 days later.\nQUESTION: So if you need a little - if you have\na little evidence, then you can seek more. But if you had\nnone, you can't try to get a lead by this technique?\nMR. RAMSELL: Justice Ginsburg, I believe the\nexigency of the circumstances would certainly authorize\nmore - a possible information roadblock under those\ncircumstances.\nQUESTION: Did this - is it the case that in this\nvery situation we're talking about it led to information\nabout the person responsible?\nMR. RAMSELL: Justice O'Connor, my understanding\nis that the roadblock itself was entirely ineffective. It\nhad zero effectiveness in seeking to obtain information\nregarding this event. In fact, I believe that we've just\nheard that it was the television which led to some\ninformation, which is a standard police practice, does not\nimplicate the Fourth Amendment, does not require any\nseizure of innocent persons -\nQUESTION: Yeah, but it requires a roadblock.\nMR. RAMSELL: I believe that in the television\ncontext there's no roadblock at issue and no one's even\ncompelled to watch the television -\nQUESTION: Well, but maybe television won't cover\njust a blurb put out by the police where they will cover a\nroadblock.\nMR. RAMSELL: That may or may not be true, Your\nHonor, but there are -\nQUESTION: Nothing duller than watching a wall of\n- of wanted posters, you know, and now, for our listeners,\nwe're going to pan the wanted posters at the post office.\nI mean -\nMR. RAMSELL: That would -\nQUESTION: - that is not going to sell. Who's\ngoing to sponsor that?\nMR. RAMSELL: That would certainly be very boring\nto - to watch wanted posters, certainly if they were\nrepetitious -\nQUESTION: But if - if they hired someone like\nJustice Scalia to go on the screen and describe it -\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: - big audience.\nQUESTION: Can I ask you a question about the\nfacts of this case, please? The blue brief describes it\nas a - a roadblock - roadblock set up in the evening, and\nas I understand it the crime was at 12:15 a.m., which I\ninterpret to be midnight. It was a midnight crime and I\nthought the roadblock was at midnight, and I wonder, how\nlong did it last? Was it started in the evening and\nlasted several hours or was it just -\nMR. RAMSELL: To be frank, searching the record\nit's - it's relatively unclear. My understanding is 90\nminutes to 2 hours at most.\nQUESTION: And it - it was though in the dark at\n- at night, not during the day?\nMR. RAMSELL: Yes, it was at night.\nQUESTION: And I also don't understand if they\nhanded something to read, how could you read in the - at\nthe - in the dark?\nMR. RAMSELL: That would also be equally as\ndifficult, Your Honor. I -\nQUESTION: Does the record explain that they did\nhand something legible to the person or use a flashlight\nor what - what was the -\nMR. RAMSELL: Logic would seem to dictate that by\nthe time the person received the flyer and drove away they\nwould again be away from the scene of the event before\nthey even read the flyer, which also makes it somewhat\nineffective in that regard.\nQUESTION: But did they - were there something\nthey were asked to read before they left or just left with\nthem to drive away with? I just don't understand what\nhappened, to tell you the truth.\nMR. RAMSELL: Well, to - to take - to take the 10\nto 15 seconds Detective Vasil describes as the duration of\nhanding the flyer, asking two questions, and obtaining two\nanswers, it would seem that reading the flyer would have\nhad to have occurred sometime after the seizure.\nQUESTION: I see.\nQUESTION: There wasn't very much on the flyer,\nwas there?\nMR. RAMSELL: Well, it did have some - it - it\nindicated the -\nQUESTION: We - we have it someplace, don't we?\nMR. RAMSELL: Yes. It is in the joint appendix\nand it's located on page 9 of the joint appendix, and\nthere is - there is a great amount of detail that's in\nthat flyer, certainly would suggest it would be difficult\nfor one to read the entirety of it, understand the purpose\nfor which they were even being stopped that evening, which\nis another point. There was no advance signs, unlike\nsobriety checkpoints, where as you're arriving, and even\nbefore you have contact with - with the police officers,\nthere's a sign that says, warning, sobriety checkpoint\nahead. At least you're putting - you're put on notice\nwhat it is that's taking place in front of you. Here,\npeople are waiting in line having no idea what it is -\nQUESTION: Well, but that - that happens in a lot\nof other contexts too. You can be driving on a highway,\nall of a sudden everything comes to a stop. What's the\nmatter? Is it an accident? Are they having one-lane\nrepair? And you just don't know, I mean, that's part of\nthe condition of driving.\nMR. RAMSELL: Well, certainly we have to expect\nthat we'll be stopped more often than anyone would wish in\nthat context, but it - it's quite different when you are -\nwhen there's six to twelve emergency vehicles there and\nas you get closer and closer you see this encounter taking\nplace before you with every single motorist in front of\nyou. That raises the anxiety of even the - the most\ninnocent citizen, I would suggest.\nQUESTION: Might I ask another question about the\n- the facts of the case?\nsomething you could have handed to a pedestrian too who\nmight have been at the scene. Does the record show\nwhether they did hand this flyer to pedestrians who might\nhave been walking by at the same time the week after the\naccident?\nMR. RAMSELL: Well, my understanding of this\nlocation, being familiar with the area, is that it's a\nmajor thoroughfare with -\nQUESTION: Right. I know -\nMR. RAMSELL: - multiple lanes. It would be\nhighly unlikely at midnight that any pedestrian would or\nshould be walking on the shoulder of this high speed limit\n-\nQUESTION: Oh, there are no sidewalks there?\nMR. RAMSELL: No. There are rarely sidewalks in\nour town, unfortunately.\nQUESTION: Oh, okay.\nQUESTION: Mr. Ramsell, there's something I'd\nlike you to comment on. The - the Illinois Supreme Court\nwas - was concerned about the - the effect of - of this\npractice, in effect, in opening the door to stops all the\ntime. They said, you know, there are loads of crimes and\nif it's justified here it will be justified in other cases\nand so on, and there have been some questions from the\nbench to that effect.\nOne answer to that might be that under the law\nas it stands now the police can conduct sobriety\ncheckpoints and we will assume that they can make license\nand registration checks and things like that. So the -\nthe police already have an opportunity, to put it bluntly,\nto abuse their right to stop if they want to do it. Is\nthere any indication that there is this kind of abuse\ngoing on, and hence, is there any reason to believe that\nthe abuse would be greater if this practice passed muster\nthan it is under the existing law?\nMR. RAMSELL: Well, I believe that law\nenforcement is always appreciative of any techniques or\ntools that they're allowed to use for investigatory\npurposes.\nQUESTION: But what - what do we know?\nEmpirically, what we do know? What is - has there - has\nthere been an indication of abuse? Is there a reason to\nbelieve that this invitation, this tool, would be abused\nmore than the tools that they now have?\nMR. RAMSELL: I would believe that it would be\nmore - more likely for abuse if this Court were to suggest\nthat these type of roadblocks were a valid investigative\ntool.\nQUESTION: But why - why?\nMR. RAMSELL: Because it would simply, number\none, it is - it makes for great publicity for law\nenforcement to use these roadblocks. They feel that it's\na -\nQUESTION: Well, it makes for great publicity to\n- to have sobriety checkpoints. That's one reason why\nthey have them.\nMR. RAMSELL: And - I agree, even though\nstatistically roadblock sobriety checkpoints tend to be\nfar less effective than saturation patrols. Most police\nchiefs comment that they don't get the type of publicity\nthey receive from a roadblock that they get from\nsaturation patrols.\nQUESTION: Is it true that -QUESTION: Suppose\nthey had done the same thing they did here, the same\nthing, except that, in addition to giving them a flyer and\nasking them about what happened - were - you know, were\nyou here a week before, they - it was also a check of\ndriver registration?\nMR. RAMSELL: I would suggest the programmatic\npurpose, the primary programmatic purpose employed in\nEdmond would still remain that this was for the purpose of\ncrime detection and investigation, not for simply checking\nlicenses. The same -\nQUESTION: Well, they were actually checking\nlicenses.\nMR. RAMSELL: And I -\nQUESTION: And they - they pick up some people\nwho don't - don't have licenses, but while they're at it\nthey kill two birds with one stone. And you say it would\nmake it bad because its primary purpose was the other?\nMR. RAMSELL: Justice Scalia, I would suggest the\nprogrammatic purpose, which would be a question of intent,\nwould still remain that it was truly for the investigation\nof this particular crime and certainly the duration and\nthe scope of the seizure would exceed the license check\nwhen questions were being asked about whether you had been\nhere last week, whether you had seen anything regarding a\nhit-and-run or any other crime. And that would seem to\nexceed even the suggested appropriateness of a roadblock\nfor license checks in Prouse.\nQUESTION: That - that incremental point of time\n- you're really playing with a - an inconsequential -\ninconsequential impingement upon the person's time.\nQUESTION: Mr. Ramsell, do you know - going back\nto Justice Souter's question - whether in the aftermath of\nSitz there have been an increase in sobriety checkpoints\nin this country?\nMR. RAMSELL: I know that a - a far greater\nnumber have been reported since Sitz, but I cannot confess\nto knowing what the statistics or the record-keeping was\nprior to Sitz, but it has - it has now crept into the\nAmerican psyche that roadblocks are a - a regular way of\nlife.\nQUESTION: But do - do they exist in Michigan\nanymore, these sobriety checkpoints?\nMR. RAMSELL: No. When the - when the case was\nremanded to Michigan, Michigan found under their own State\nconstitution that this - that a sobriety checkpoint still\nremained to be an unreasonable violation of the search and\nseizure clause of their own constitution, so they do not\nhave them.\nNow, in this case, what we have is we have a - a\nvery stale event. In fact, the facts do not even suggest\nthat the driver was perhaps even negligent in how the\naccident occurred. We have a - a bicyclist on a major\nthoroughfare at midnight in a place where it's highly\nunusual to - to find pedestrians in a dark area, and\nthere's been no indication that the driver was at fault\nother than failing to remain at the scene of the accident.\nQUESTION: That's pretty serious, isn't it,\ncalled hit-and-run?\nMR. RAMSELL: It's hit-and-run as -\nQUESTION: All right, so all that's at stake is\nthat it was a hit-and-run and the guy's dead, all right.\nSo - so now what has that to do with the reasonableness of\nthis? I'm not - not asking you facetiously because I\nthink maybe you think you want to tie it in and I just\nwant you to do it.\nMR. RAMSELL: Well, the consequences are very\nserious. However, hit-and-run would also fall within\ndinging the car in the grocery parking lot next to you and\nfailing to remain at the scene. These are single events -\nQUESTION: So you mean that it might be\nreasonable to do it for some serious crimes but not for\nless serious?\nMR. RAMSELL: I would suggest that it cannot be\ndone for any crime except in exigent circumstances, which\nwe do not have here. This is a stale event -\nQUESTION: So even - even if it were, say, a\ncarjacking, where there was a fatality, if it's stale it\ncan't be done?\nMR. RAMSELL: Yes, Your Honor. I would - I would\nrespectfully say that, under the analysis in Edmonds,\nthere is a lack of exigency. Edmonds suggests that, but\nfor the emergency circumstances of an - an imminent\nterrorist attack, otherwise that would be considered a\nviolation of the Fourth Amendment. This is a single\naccident. It - it does not fall within the magnitude of\nany of the previous issues that have been brought before\nthe Court -\nQUESTION: Now you seem - seem to be arguing the\nsame thing that, other things being equal, if you lose on\nyour other points you could only do it in a serious but\nnot non-serious. Is that what you're - is that the point\nyou're making? And if so, I want to know what the line\nis.\nMR. RAMSELL: Well, the line is exigency, and\nexigency meaning there was no - there's an immediate\nhazard on the roadway, which was what seemed to justify\nsobriety checkpoints in Sitz, that there would have been\nan effectiveness to removing then-hazardous drivers and\npreventing the potential for future injury to life and\nlimb. This is a post-event, non-exigent roadblock. The\nfacts, nevertheless, don't have the gravity of the public\nconcern. In the Brown v. Texas -\nQUESTION: Well, what if - what if you've got a -\na license number and for - for a serious crime that was\ncommitted, say, an hour ago? Can - can you then conduct a\n- this sort of program?\nMR. RAMSELL: I would submit yes, that you could\nunder that circumstance. Number one, you could tailor the\nroadblock substantially less. You have the exigency\nbecause it is a fresh pursuit analysis. You certainly\nwouldn't need to pull over every car and question them if\nyou had a license plate number to work from. And so it -\nit would certainly even be capable of being more\nsufficiently tailored so that those who are admittedly\ninnocent are less likely to have their liberties\ninterfered with.\nQUESTION: Of course -\nQUESTION: Well, what if you - what if you just\nhad the information that it's - it's a black Ford SUV?\nMR. RAMSELL: And it happened one hour ago?\nQUESTION: Yeah.\nMR. RAMSELL: I believe under that set of\ncircumstances the exigency would suggest there would be a\npotential for a reasonable checkpoint tailored in scope\nand duration with sufficient guidelines in place. In\nfact, in this particular checkpoint, we have virtually no\nguidelines in place. We have a field officer who\ntestifies that what he did was to ask some questions.\nThere's no indication as to why other persons were sent to\nsecondary staging areas. We do not have any guidelines so\nthat if a motorist had said, yes, I was here last week,\nand yes, I think I have some information, we have no\nguidelines for those field officers as to what to do and\nhow to treat that motorist and how to detain that person.\nQUESTION: You know anybody's that's challenged\nthese things who - for any reason other than the\nexclusionary rule? This case wouldn't be here except for\nthe fact that your client during the stop was found to be\ndriving under the influence. Had that not happened, don't\nyou think there's zero chance that anyone would have cared\nenough, would have felt beset upon enough by the police to\nbring some action to stop this Gestapo-like activity?\nMR. RAMSELL: I do believe there are -\nQUESTION: I mean, it's - it's really just the\nexclusionary rule driving - driving this case.\nMR. RAMSELL: Respectfully, Your Honor, I do -\nthere - I do believe there are people who care and there\nare people who care about our right to be let alone, our\nright of free passage.\nQUESTION: Well, if people in Lombard care about\nit, they can tell the police to stop doing it.\nMR. RAMSELL: I certainly would hope that they\nwould also exercise their right to let them know that they\ndislike these roadblocks as much as perhaps others in more\nintellectual pursuits, but -\nQUESTION: Are there indications nationwide that\nthe public makes objection to roadblocks, other than the\nperson that's caught for drunk driving?\nMR. RAMSELL: I would suggest that most - most\npersons are not pleased by roadblocks. I believe that\nmost people feel that they do reflect on an invasion of\ntheir privacy and liberty.\nQUESTION: I mean, is there evidence of that?\nMR. RAMSELL: I - I cannot cite any polling\nthat's been taken one way or the other that would really\nflesh that out. Here we have far less than the drug\ninterdiction that was rejected in Edmond. We have a\nsingle accident. We have far less than the concern about\nprotecting our national borders, as we had in Martinez v.\nFuerte, and certainly not the imminency of the hazard that\nwas found in Sitz. There's frankly no empirical or actual\ndata to even support that this roadblock will advance the\ninterest, and by the fact that nothing was advanced in\nthis particular event suggests that even in a balancing\ntest we don't have the sufficiency, the gravity of the\npublic concern, nor do we have any indication of any\ndegree to which this seizure would advance the public\ninterest. This is more akin to Prouse, where the Court\nfound that the - the likelihood of finding an unlicenced\nmotorist versus the likely numbers of persons that will be\nstopped was so substantial that data was insufficient.\nQUESTION: Well, Prouse was random stops, though,\nwasn't it?\nMR. RAMSELL: It was random stops. However, the\neffectiveness was mentioned as - as one of the factors,\nand there were certainly reasonable alternatives that were\nsuggested that could have avoided the random stop\nscenario. And here we have admittedly innocent drivers as\nwell with no escape route, so a person couldn't even avoid\nthe - the compulsory stop and questioning.\nI would also submit that this analysis, if - if\nfound appropriate here, would equally allow for the stop\nof pedestrians at - on the sidewalk. It would allow the\npolice to circle an office building and have the persons\nrun through the - with the gamut of brief questioning\nbefore they were allowed to leave an office building. And\nit would be very unmanageable and unworkable to find an\nappropriate balancing test, even though I would submit\nthat one thing the Court needs to do is to, of course, let\nlaw enforcement know in advance what will be acceptable\nconduct on their part and that it would be inappropriate\nto allow for a case-by-case, fact-sensitive analysis based\non the plethora of crimes that could potentially lead to\nit, the geographic area in a small rural town. The rural\npolice chief may find roadblocks or - may find their most\nserious crime to be the stealing of a purse and therefore\na roadblock of some form justifiable there, where that\nsame roadblock in an urban setting would be found to be\nunreasonable and unjustifiable, and certainly those\npolitically accountable officials that feel that their\ncitizenry are more favorable to roadblocks may be\nencouraged to allow them to occur more often. Thank you.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Ramsell.\nMr. Feinerman, you have 2 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF GARY FEINERMAN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. FEINERMAN: This Court in Edmond found that\nnarcotics check - narcotics checkpoints are so obnoxious\nto core Fourth Amendment values that a per se rule of\ninvalidity was justified and the principal question here\nis whether informational checkpoints present the same\nFourth Amendment dangers that general crime control\ncheckpoints present, and the answer to that is no.\nAnd in order to answer that, we - we have to\nfigure out what the hallmarks are of a crime control\ncheckpoint, and we suggest that there are at least two.\nThe first is that it's the purpose of the checkpoint to\nincriminate the motorist as opposed to the situation in\nLombard, which was simply the police asking for help, and\nthat distinction makes a difference under the Fourth\nAmendment for several reasons. The first has to do with\nprivacy. At a general crime control checkpoint, the\npolice are trying to learn something about you, whether\nyou've committed a wrongdoing, whereas at an informational\ncheckpoint there's just asking for help, somebody died\nhere last week, could you help us find the perpetrator.\nThere's also a difference in terms of jeopardy.\nAt a general crime control checkpoint you may be\ninterrogated, detained, arrested, prosecuted, and possibly\njailed, whereas at an informational checkpoint, again,\nyou're just being asked for help, and that's a critical\ndistinction that this Court drew in Ferguson between the\ndrug test that was invalidated in Ferguson and the drug\ntesting programs that were upheld in Skinner, Acton, and\nVon Raab.\nThere's also an indignity element to a general\ncrime control checkpoint. You're being - it's - it's a\nbit of an indignity to be suspected as being a potential\nlaw-breaker, whereas in - in an informational checkpoint\nthere's really no impingement on dignity, you're just,\nagain, being treated as an ally of the police and being\nasked for help, and in fact, it's an act of responsible\ncitizenship to provide help in that kind of situation.\nThe second distinction is that a general crime\ncontrol checkpoint - the police are simply trolling for\nhitherto undiscovered crimes, whereas in an informational\ncheckpoint, they're investigating a known, specific crime,\nand that's who makes a difference. There's a difference\nbetween - as Ms. Millett pointed out - there's a\ndifference between knowing a crime and finding the\ncriminal and then simply rounding up a bunch of potential\ncriminals and trying to peg a crime on them. And that's\nimportant not only for the fact that we're uncomfortable\nwith general - general surveillance, but also it's a\ntraditional police function. When a crime happens, police\nought to return to the scene of the crime and find\nwitnesses. Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr.\n"
