O'Brien.\nMr. Horwich.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF BENJAMIN HORWICH\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. HORWICH: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nSection 924(c)(1) starts by defining a\nsingle crime of using or carrying a firearm during and\nin relation to a crime of violence or a drug trafficking\ncrime.\nNext, it addresses sentencing, and it does\nthat by giving the judge some rules to channel his\ndiscretion in particular cases, and among those is a\nrequirement that a, quote, \"person convicted of a\nviolation\" ... \"shall be sentenced\" to a greater minimum\nsentence when the firearm is of a particular type.\nAnd --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well wait. There's --\nthere's some sentencing stuff in -- in the first part\nas well. There's sentencing stuff in (A). You can't\nsay that (A) deals only with elements and (B) deals\nwith sentencing.\nMR. HORWICH: Well, no, and, of course --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, (A) says, \"shall be\nsentenced to 5 years.\" Or to 7 years, or to 10 years.\nSo there's sentencing stuff in (A).\nMR. HORWICH: Well, I agree with you that\nthe phrase \"be sentenced\" certainly appears in (A) as\nwell. To the extent a statute is going to direct a\nparticular sentence, it's going to use those words.\nBut I think the -- we're relying a lot\nmore on the language in the beginning of subparagraph (B),\nthat says, \"if the firearm possessed by a person convicted\nof a violation,\" which necessarily presupposes, then, that\nthere has been a conviction --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So does -- so does the language\nof (A)(ii) and (A)(iii), which is the same language: \"if\nthe firearm is brandished\"; \"if the firearm is\ndischarged\" -- they all apply to a conviction for carrying\nthe firearm. There has to be a conviction before those\nthings apply.\nMR. HORWICH: Well, I agree. That's true.\nThat is certainly an accurate statement --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So that makes (A) the same\nas (B). And -- and you don't claim that the elements in (A)\nare just sentencing elements, do you?\nMR. HORWICH: Well, I certainly don't claim\nthat they -- that the elements in the principal\nparagraph of (A) are. The point I'm -- the point I'm\ntrying to make is that, with respect to firearm type,\nwhich is at issue here, is that the firearm type\nprovisions are introduced by specific language that\nsays -- that tells the reader these are relevant to a\nperson convicted of a violation; these are not relevant\nto whether --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No, but you're\nforgetting the words of this subsection. I mean --\nMR. HORWICH: Well --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- the subsection would be\n(B) itself. If you're convicted of carrying a machinegun,\nyou get -- I'm sorry -- a short-barrel rifle, et cetera,\nyou get 10 years. If it's a machinegun, you get 30.\nWhat's -- what's irrational about reading\nthe statute that way when it uses the word \"subsection\"?\nIt didn't use \"subparagraph.\"\nMR. HORWICH: Well, I agree it doesn't use\n\"subparagraph.\" And \"subsection\" certainly in\nconventional use in drafting would refer actually to\n924(c) as a whole.\nBut -- but looking to the word \"this\nsubsection,\" Justice Sotomayor, is not -- is not useful\nfor distinguishing among the elements and the sentencing\nfactors, because of course there are, I think --\ncertainly this Court's holding in Harris says that the\nbrandishing and the discharge provisions are sentencing\nfactors. They are part of this subsection.\nAll the courts of appeals have held, and\nit's the entirely natural inference of the recidivism\nprovisions in subparagraph (C), which is also part of\nthis subsection, are -- are themselves sentencing\nfactors. So saying that something is in this subsection\nmeans that it might be part of a violation doesn't\nactually answer what is or is not part of the violation\nversus --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But still and all, if -- if\nCongress were being precise and if the statute is to be\nread the way you suggest, the introduction to capital\n(B) should have been \"if the firearm possessed by a\nperson convicted of a violation of paragraph (A) above,\"\nand then pick it up, \"is,\" so forth.\nRight? I mean, that would -- would be more\nprecise.\nMR. HORWICH: That -- that I think would be so\nprecise that we wouldn't be here discussing it today. I\nagree with that.\nBut, of course, Congress has also used that\nsame reference to \"subsection\" throughout -- throughout the\nentire statute, even if it's not being used in the most\nprecise sense, in the sense that a violation of this\nsubsection appears in subparagraph (C), it appears in\nsubparagraph (D), which is not --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes.\nMR. HORWICH: -- which is not then to say that\nthis subsection -- that everything in this subsection is an\nelement. The Court has held otherwise already.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I guess I agree with you\nthat if (B) is -- if (B) is an element, (C) would be an\nelement, too.\nMR. HORWICH: Well, that certainly would be\nthe inference. And that would be quite contrary to the\ntraditional treatment of recidivism.\nBut, more generally, the tradition that\nCongress is working within in this new statute -- which,\nI want to point out, is significantly different in -- in\na very substantive way from the old statute -- that the\nnew statute proscribes a statutory maximum of life in\nall cases. That is different from the old statute. The\nold statute --\nJUSTICE BREYER: What is this to do -- I\nmean, the obvious question, to me, is -- since I wrote\nthe -- I think I wrote the opinion in Castillo -- is we\nlooked at the language of the statute, very similar to\nthis, and we said: Machinegun means a separate crime.\nAnd they recodified it. And it looks to me as if all\nthey did was take the things that we previously said\nwere separate crimes and put them in (B), and take the\nthings that are obviously sentencing factors and put\nthem in (A) and (C).\nAll right. Now, that's what it looks like\nif you just read the statute. I didn't find anything in\nthe history that suggested any other intent. So why do\nyou think that that change makes the difference?\nMR. HORWICH: Well, I think there are --\nthere are several specific changes that Congress made.\nAnd I think it would be, perhaps, useful to look at the\nold statute and the new one, the old statute and the new\none together and see why the things that -- that the\nCourt said in Castillo are gone in the new one. So the\nold statute is in the petition appendix at 11a.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Right.\nMR. HORWICH: And then the new statute is in\nthe appendix to the government's opening brief at 1a and\n2a, so you can look at them side by side.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Isn't the old one in your\nbrief, too, in your --\nMR. HORWICH: It is.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's 3a of the government's\nbrief.\nMR. NORWICH: It is, although, of course,\nyou have to turn the page, and I --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: All right. Okay.\nMR. HORWICH: Perhaps it's helpful to look\nat them next to each other, because the differences are\nquite stark --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: All right.\nMR. HOWICH: -- when you do that.\nSo the first thing is, as you suggested,\nJustice Breyer, the firearm type provisions were moved.\nBut I think that that move signals something contrary to\nwhat this Court had perceived in Castillo. In Castillo,\nthe firearm type provisions were part of the initial\nsentence that defined the elements. The sentence is\nrolling along, talking about using or carrying a\nfirearm, and then in the same breath it goes on to start\ntalking about specific weapons. And that is what, in my\nreading of Castillo, drove the Court's impression that\nthe they -- that the machinegun provision there should be\nan element.\nThe difference in the new statute is -- is\nthat Congress has moved it away, textually,\nconceptually, structurally, away from the elements,\nwhich ought to suggest that Congress doesn't think --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But it didn't. It kept\nin (A) the subdivisions of use and brandishing, which\nwe all agree are elements of the crime. So I don't know\nwhat it means to say that it moved it away from the\nelements. It mixed up in (A) elements and sentencing\nfactors, and so what we have to discern was, did it\nintend to make (B) sentencing factors or not?\nAnd I think what Justice Breyer was asking\nyou: What in the legislative history shows that? Where\ndo we read, outside of Castillo, a conclusion that\nsomehow Congress radically changed the assumptions we\nidentified in Castillo, which is historically it's not a\nsentencing element?\nMR. HORWICH: So a few answers there.\nFirst of all, in the new -- in the new\nstructure of the statute, on the government's view, the\nelements finish in the principal paragraph, and then --\nthen we're into sentencing factors. So brandishing and\ndischarge were held in Harris and acknowledged in Dean\nto be sentencing factors. So we are sort of, at that\npoint, on to sentencing factors.\nSo I take from what this Court said in\nHarris, about the separation of brandishing and discharge\nfrom the elements in the principal paragraph to indicate\nthat they are sentencing factors, would apply even more\nstrongly to subparagraph (C), which is even farther\naway. There's -- there's a period, a structural break,\na new sentence. The thought in the principal paragraph is\ncertainly complete. We've already been through some\nother sentencing factors, and now we're --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, except that with --\nwith (C), you -- you could say that traditionally\nrecidivism has been a sentencing factor, and you cannot\nsay with respect to (B) that whether it's a\nshort-barreled rifle or a machinegun has traditionally\nbeen a sentencing factor. To the contrary, it was an\nelement.\nMR. HORWICH: Well, I disagree with that,\nJustice Scalia, because the tradition, as I understand\nit, is relevant because it might indicate what Congress\nwas thinking or what suppositions it had in mind when it\npassed a statute.\nAnd there's a very -- there was a very\ndifferent tradition at the time of the 1986 enactment of\nthe old statute and the 1998 enactment of the new one,\nwhich is -- the big difference is that the sentencing\nguidelines came into effect in between those two times.\nAnd the sentencing guidelines -- sentencing\nguideline 2K2.1, the principal determinant of base\noffense level in the sentencing guidelines for\nfirearm-centric offenses in the Federal criminal law, was\nfirearm type. So it was unmistakably that -- it was\nunmistakable at the time in 1998 when Congress enacted\nthese -- these firearm-type provisions, that the\nsentencing guidelines were already making firearm type a\nsentencing consideration for the judge.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Let's -- let's talk about\nthe guidelines. Without the application of (B), the\nguidelines would provide for a much shorter sentence,\nwouldn't they?\nMR. HORWICH: Well, the guidelines -- as\nbefore and as now for this offense, the guidelines level\nis the minimum.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The guidelines -- do you\nthink that if under the guidelines the sentence was\n30 years because of a machinegun, do you think that that\nwould be upheld?\nMR. HORWICH: I'm sorry. And your -- if I\nunderstand you --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Do you think it would be\nupheld as a reasonable sentence under our Booker/Fanfan\ntheory of -- of how the guidelines are to be applied?\nMR. HORWICH: A reasonable -- well,\ncertainly courts have, since Booker, imposed even up to\na life sentence for offenses that did not otherwise\ntrigger the elevated minimums. There's at least one\ncase in the few years since Booker that implied a --\nthat imposed a life sentence for a -- for an offense\nthat would have been subject only to the base 5-year\nmaximum. There are several that imposed -- imposed a\nlife sentence for --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Where -- where is the life\nsentence maximum, by the way? I -- you say this is a\nminimum. It's just a mandatory minimum because the\nmaximum is specified to be life. Where is that specified?\nMR. HORWICH: The -- the maximum is not\ntextually in the statute, but all courts that have looked\nat this have understood that. Certainly, it seems to be\nthe supposition of this Court's statutory holding in Harris\nthat the nature of -- the structure of this -- of the\nsentencing provision here is that there's a life maximum,\nand then the firearm --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Where -- where do you get\nthe life maximum? I -- I'm reading through, and there's\n-- it mentions nothing about life.\nMR. HORWICH: Well, it is certainly the\ncase, if we simply take (a)(1) --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And if it mentions nothing\nabout life, then these are not mandatory minimums. To\nthe contrary, they are -- they are new maximums.\nMR. HORWICH: I absolutely disagree. If it\nsays \"at least,\" that can only mean that there can be some\n-- a sentence higher than that.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Is the life part of\nthe --\nMR. HORWICH: Or not less than.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- what the substantive\ncrime was? Is it the attempted robbery or whatever it was?\nIs that -- because this is -- you're -- you're saying this\nis an add-on to an underlying offense.\nMR. HORWICH: Well, I wouldn't describe it\nas an add-on. It is a separate Federal crime, in -- in\nthe sense -- in the sense that it is bad enough and\ndangerous enough to commit a drug trafficking offense\nor engage in a crime of --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, then -- then you\nwouldn't be relying on what might be a life sentence\nfor the underlying crime.\nMR. HORWICH: I -- oh, I'm sorry. I -- I\nmay have -- may have misspoken.\nIn response to Justice Scalia's question, my\nanswer -- my answer was directed to imposing a life\nsentence on the 924(c) conviction, separate from\nwhatever sentence may have been imposed on the --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, but where do you get\nthe maximum? You say, oh, these are just minimums.\nMR. HORWICH: Well, they are minimums\nbecause they say \"not less than 5 years.\" That applies --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But where is -- where is\nthe maximum?\nMR. HORWICH: The -- well, because there is\nno stated maximum, the -- the assumption then must be\nthat a sentence higher than 5 years is appropriate.\nThere is no --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Is there a Sixth\nAmendment problem with reading a statute this way,\nwith -- with reading a statute to provide for an\nunlimited maximum when Congress hasn't specified it, and\nnow you're going to have the judge find the minimum and\nthe maximum?\nMR. HORWICH: Well, I don't -- I disagree\nthat the judge is finding the maximum. The -- the\nimplied maximum term here is -- is life. Congress --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't find that implied\nat all. I don't see why it's implied.\nMR. HORWICH: Well, the trouble,\nJustice Scalia, is then that I don't otherwise know what\nthe maximum would be.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's right. That's --\nMR. HORWICH: The maximum --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's her question.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But isn't there a Sixth\nAmendment problem with not knowing what you are exposed\nto? And then doesn't the minimum in that case sort of\nbecome de facto the maximum?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I think what you are\nexposed to, as I read the statute, (c)(1)(A) does not\nimpose a new sentence at all. It just says there will\nbe added to whatever the sentence is for the crime of\nviolence or the drug trafficking crime -- there will be\nadded to that sentence. Then it says you'll add 7\nyears; you'll add 25 years; you'll add 30 years.\nThose are not mandatory minimums. Those are\nadd-ons to the sentence provided by the substantive\ncrime to which (c)(1)(A) refers. That way, the whole\nthing makes sense.\nMR. HORWICH: Well, I don't think it would\nmake sense to treat them, as you are describing them, as\nadd-ons. There's no question that this -- that this\nstatute defines an offense that someone can be convicted\nof. That certainly is the implication of this Court's\nholding in Deal. It is a separate offense which\ntherefore should carry its own punishment. And the\ncontrast --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I'll amend what I said.\nIt is a mandatory minimum if the substantive crime\nreferred to in (c)(1)(A) is above what is specified\nin -- in this statute. But if it -- if it is below\nthat, if the drug trafficking crime only provided for\n15 years, and you did the crime with a machinegun, you\nget 30 years, that's an add-on.\nMR. HORWICH: Well, I -- I think it would be\nhelpful then to compare this to the -- the language of\nthe prior statute, which describes exactly what you are\ndescribing.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I got it.\nMR. HORWICH: Which is -- which is that\nwhoever during or in relation, et cetera, et cetera,\nuses or carries a firearm --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Can you give us the page?\nMR. HORWICH: I'm sorry, this is at 11a of\nthe petition appendix.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's also on 3a of the\ngovernment's brief.\nMR. HORWICH: Or 3a of the -- of the\ngovernment's -- the government's brief.\nThe old statute said exactly what you are\ndescribing, Justice Scalia, which is that whoever during\nor in relation to a crime of violence, et cetera, uses\nor carries a firearm shall, in addition to the\npunishment provided for such crime of violence, et\ncetera -- and then it specifies --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Right.\nMR. HORWICH: -- particular determinate\nsentences.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Right.\nMR. HORWICH: If Congress had wanted to\ncontinue that approach, I assume it would have kept that\nlanguage. It didn't. It changed the language. The new\nlanguage says \"be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of\nnot less than 5 years,\" which leaves -- which leaves --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It says \"in addition to\" at\nthe end of (c)(1)(A): \"Who, in furtherance ... possesses a\nfirearm shall, in addition to the punishment provided\nfor by such crime of violence, be sentenced to\" 5\nyears, 7 years, 10 years. And then if the\nfirearm, blah, blah, blah, is blah, blah, blah -- since\nyour -- I assume that that introductory language \"in\naddition to the punishment provided for\" is implicit in\n(B). It's expressed in (A), but I think it's implicit\nin (B).\nMR. HORWICH: That -- I understand that\nlanguage, the in -- the \"in addition to\" language, to\nhave -- to have been to make clear that this is a\nseparate offense. There is separate punishment for a\nseparate conviction of this separate offense.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes.\nMR. HORWICH: And that then it is a\nseparate -- then from there it is a question what is the\nappropriate sentence for a conviction on the offense\ndescribed in 924(c)(1), which is to say, well, it's a\nterm of imprisonment of not less than 5 years, which\nholds open --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: In addition to the term\nthat's -- that exists for the substantive offense.\nMR. HORWICH: I -- I agree. And if you look\nin subparagraph (D)(ii) it says that the term of\nimprisonment imposed under this subsection shall run\nconsecutive to the other one, which -- which again shows\nthat -- that the considerations for sentencing in this\n-- in this law are distinct from the -- it is a -- it is\na separate question what the sentence on the 924(c) --\nJUSTICE BREYER: To make your life a little\nmore complicated and difficult, though perhaps it makes\nit easier, we reach the questions that Justice Scalia\nwas raising, I think, and they are important only if you\nwin, only if we say that it is a sentencing factor. If\nit is a new crime, we don't have any problem, because if\nit's a new crime, the jury has to find the fact.\nBut if it's a sentencing factor, then we get\ninto the problem of Harris versus Apprendi. And then you\nhave to decide whether it's maximum, minimum, et cetera.\nBut in Harris, I said that I thought Apprendi does cover\nmandatory minimums, but I don't accept Apprendi. Well,\nat some point I guess I have to accept Apprendi, because\nit's the law and has been for some time.\nSo if and in fact, unfortunately for\neveryone, I was -- it was 5-4 in that, I think, so my vote\nmattered, and I don't know what other people think\nbut in -- on this Court. But if that becomes an issue,\nif that should become an issue about whether mandatory\nminimums are treated like the maximums for Apprendi\npurposes, should we reset the case for argument? Or do\nyou feel, in your opinion that -- that you've had\nenough of an argument because you devoted two or three\npages to this topic?\nMR. HORWICH: Well, to answer -- well, first\nof all, there certainly has not been in -- in the\nbriefing or argument here, any opportunity for this Court\nto consider what it would need to consider to overrule\nMcMillan. We're not talking about overruling Harris.\nWe're talking about overruling McMillan. And --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, I think basically\nApprendi did significantly change McMillan, but that's --\nMR. HORWICH: Well, and that's -- and that\nwould be my -- my second point, is that -- is that since\n-- I think it has been become clearer since Harris that\nthe rule in McMillan and the rule in Apprendi coexist\nquite well and coexist in a principled fashion, and\nthat there is -- and that there is no -- Harris was\ncorrect in light of Apprendi, which is -- which is in\nthe following respect.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Does the government believe\nthat it has sufficiently argued this, or would you suggest\non the government's behalf that if it becomes an issue\nit's set for reargument? That was really my question.\nMR. HORWICH: Well, yes, we would certainly\nwant to set it for reargument --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's the right answer.\nMR. HORWICH: -- obviously.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. HORWICH: But -- but I -- again, I don't\neven think that's necessary. Respondents have offered\nnothing in the way of a justification for overruling\nHarris. And again, the distinction is --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Why can't we just say, as\nJudge Boudin did, they weren't -- this revision was on\nthe books before Castillo was decided, so obviously\nCongress wasn't trying to adjust the statute in response\nto Castillo. And they -- they made it read more easily.\nWe know the one thing Congress was concerned with was adding\npossession, which was not there before. So they added\npossession. They made it more readable.\nSome of the concerns that were expressed in\nCastillo are certainly present here. There is a huge\njump from a 5-year add-on to a 30-year add-on for -- for\nthe machinegun. So why don't we just say, well, this\nstatute has been revised, but it wasn't in response to\nCastillo? It's not all that different.\nMR. HORWICH: Well, I disagree that it's\nnot all that different. And -- and for the following\nthree -- for three reasons. First of all, setting aside\nmy disagreement with Justice Scalia, if you accept that\nthe statutory maximum is life, as I believe every court\nto have confronted this understands it to be, then this\nstatute belongs to an entirely different tradition than\nthe tradition that Castillo belonged to, which is to\nsay that this statute -- the -- the role of firearm type\nin this statute is to channel the sentencing judge's\ndiscretion by ruling out certain low sentences when\ncertain facts are present, such as the presence of a\nmachinegun.\nThat is something that when Congress wants\nto channel --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Isn't a minimum always a\nmaximum?\nMR. HORWICH: No, I --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: In -- to the person who\nwould otherwise, in the judge's discretion, qualify for a\nlower sentence, doesn't it become that person's maximum\nonce you have indiscretion?\nMR. HORWICH: I disagree with that because\nthe principle -- the background -- the basic principle\nbehind Apprendi and our criminal law is that what you\ncan rely on is what Congress has said in the statute or\nin -- as Booker holds --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What you can rely on in\nan indeterminate sentencing regime without a minimum is\nthat you've got a statutory maximum, whatever it may\nbe, but a judge's discretion to start from zero. If\nthat judge was inclined to give you zero, isn't the\nminimum then your statutory maximum? You're -- because\nthat's what the judge has to give you.\nMR. HORWICH: I disagree with that, because\nit is not the only thing the judge can give you. The\nfull range of punishment above those minimums is\navailable. I was indicating earlier that --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel -- counsel,\nI think you had said you had three responses to Justice\nGinsburg --\nMR. HORWICH: Yes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- and only got one out.\nMR. HORWICH: Right, and perhaps only\nhalf of that one, which is -- which is that in the -- on\nthe question of -- of tradition, Congress apparently\nexclusively uses sentencing factors when it wants to do\nnothing more than give some rules to the judge to\nchannel his discretion with minimum sentences. We\nobserved this in our opening brief, and Respondents said\nnothing in response.\nAs far as we know, every time Congress wants\nto channel a sentencing judge's discretion, it does it\nwith a sentencing factor. That is a difference.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: All right. Number two?\nMR. HORWICH: Number two is that the -- is\nthat the -- the -- the linguistic change here, the\ntextual change, the fact that subparagraph (D) says \"a\nperson convicted of a violation of this subsection.\"\nThat presupposes there has been a conviction, that the\njury has been charged with whatever the elements of the\noffense are and that now what's going to be stated in\nclauses (B)(i) and (B)(ii) are things that are relevant\nat sentencing.\nAnd then the third -- and then the third\npoint is -- is that -- is essentially the structural\nchange from -- that I alluded to earlier, of moving\nfirearm type wholly away from the elements of the\noffense. That made a difference to this Court in\nHarris. It is -- it would be, I think, irreconcilable\nwith this Court's holding in Harris to say that\nbrandishing and discharge have been moved far enough\naway from the elements to make them sentencing factors,\nor rather are stated far enough away from the elements,\nstructurally separated enough to make them\nsentencing factors, but then to --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Those are all -- all\nthree of those are -- are pretty subtle ways for\nCongress to change the view in Castillo.\nMR. HORWICH: Well, I would agree that --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Moving something\nfrom the body of the paragraph to a separate section and\nso on.\nMR. HORWICH: Well, I would -- I would point\nout -- of course, one has to -- one has to recognize what\nCongress had before it when it -- when it made the\nchange, which is to say, when it -- when it embarked on\nthese revisions, there was a one-to-one circuit split on\nthe question. And by the time it had finished making\nthe changes, it was actually three to one in favor of\nsentencing factor interpretation in the old statute.\nNow, I agree that if Castillo had been on\nthe books and Congress had said nothing about it, that\nmight be a basis to say that Congress was acquiescing in\nthat interpretation. But it's -- it's -- Congress was\ncertainly concerned with much more substantial issues in\nthe revisions. And the fact that it did not comment\nfurther should not be a reason to -- to not pay\nattention to the structural and textural changes that it\ndid make.\nI'd like to reserve.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: We have tall lawyers today.\nWhat is this, tall lawyer day?\n(Laughter.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Fisher.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L. FISHER\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. FISHER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nI think it's important at the outset to set\nthe context for this case. The government cannot point\nto a single defendant under this provision for the\nconduct at issue who has ever received more than\n10 years in prison absent the use of a machinegun.\nWe cited a long string of cases in the\nO'Brien brief and the government's response in its reply\nbrief was silent. So, therefore, the government is here\ntoday claiming that it is entitled, based on the fact of\na machinegun, to get 20 years more than any defendant\nthat perpetrated this conduct has ever gotten, and\nindeed 18 more years than the government itself asked\nthe district judge in this case for, once the machinegun\nprovision was off the table, under the guise that this\nis nothing more than a sentencing factor.\nWe think that this Court's statutory\ninterpretation jurisprudence as well, if necessary, this\nCourt's constitutional jurisprudence foreclose such a\nresult.\nLet me start with statutory interpretation.\nOn the government's theory in 1998, Congress stepped in\nand took a statute that made machinegun use an element\nand transformed it into -- into a sentencing factor. In\nother words, Congress, without a peep, a mutter, or\nanything, and in -- in the course of doing something\nentirely different, which was reacting to this Court's\nBailey decision, stepped in and took a fact that\nformerly had to be proved to a jury beyond a reasonable\ndoubt to trigger a 30-year sentence and left that same\nsentence in place but now allowed it to be proved to a\njudge by a preponderance, based on a presentence report,\nand, indeed, according to the government, also stripped\naway the mens rea requirement that attached to the\nstatute when it was an element.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: How about the short --\nwhat is it, the one that gets 10 years, the\nshort-barreled rifle? That's -- that's -- those two\nare together in the statute, and you said that it would\nbe startling because of the difference between 10 years\nand the 30 years, but the short-barreled rifle is the\nsame amount of time in discharging, and discharging is a\nsentencing factor.\nMR. FISHER: We think, Justice Ginsburg,\nthat if this Court had to construe that statute in a\ndifferent case, that provision, it would find it's still\nan element. Now, I grant that it's a difference, a\nvery significant difference between 10 and 30 years, but\nstructurally it is an element.\nAnd I think an -- a good way to go about\nunderstanding this -- I heard my -- my opponent today say\nthat this would be indistinguishable from Harris or fly\nin the face of Harris.\nWell, there's three very important\ndifferences between the machinegun provision at issue\nhere and the discharge provision in Dean and the\nbrandishing provision in Harris. The first difference\nis that this an entirely separate subparagraph.\nNow, if you imagine somebody amending the\nstatute and wanting to accomplish what the government\nsays was accomplished here, why wouldn't the firearm\ntype provisions just have been (iv) and (v) under\ncapital letter (A)? They're not.\nWhat the draftsperson did instead is break\nthem out into an entirely separate, stand-alone\nprovision. As the AUSA described it, when he charged\nthem in the alternative in the district of\nMassachusetts, he said I think it's a greater and lesser\noffense situation. And that's what we think.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, I guess I'm not\nfollowing the ball here. I thought the government had\nconceded that sub (i), sub (ii), sub (iii) under (A) are\nnot sentencing factors but are elements. Is that not --\nMR. FISHER: I don't understand that to be\nwhat the government has said. I believe the\ngovernment's argument is that the big paragraph with\ncapital letter (A) sets forth the elements, and then sub\n(i), (ii), and (iii) are merely sentencing factors.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Now, they have to because\nthat's what Harris said, brandished --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: That's -- yes, that's Harris.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- brandished is a\nsentencing factor.\nMR. FISHER: That's right. That's right,\nJustice Ginsburg.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that's even worse,\nthen. I agree with you.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. FISHER: So what sub (B) does, as I\nsaid, is it creates a greater offense, and so, it's\nbroken out in a way that incorporates the earlier\nelements up above in the main paragraph by using the\nphrase: If a \"firearm possessed by a person\nconvicted of a violation of this subsection.\"\nThat phrase, we believe, incorporates the\nearlier elements. Remember in Harris this Court\nemphasized that the brandishing provision just kept\ngoing in the sentence and did not incorporate earlier\nelements.\nSo when the government stands here today and\nsays, well, when you incorporate the earlier elements,\nthat shows it's a sentencing factor, too, it seems to me a\nsituation of heads, I win; tails, you lose.\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, their -- their -- their\nbasic argument is look at the statute. (A) has what is\nundoubtedly a set of sentencing factors. Brandishing and\ndischarging are as traditional as they come. Then look\nat (C), and you find some other ones that are sentencing\nfactors, because recidivism is as traditional as it\ncomes. And between those two they put (B).\nSo since the neighbors, (A) and (C), are\ncertainly sentencing, they must have meant (B) to be a\nsentencing factor, too. I -- as I understand it, that\nis one of their basic arguments.\nMR. FISHER: Right. And let me -- let me\ngive two responses to that. First of all, if you --\nif you look again at the appendix of the government's\nmain brief, which is 1a and 2a, the guts of the\nstatute is the \"use or carry\" language or \"possesses a firearm\"\nlanguage in the main paragraph.\nAnd then, the -- from the \"possessed\" language\ndown through sub (iii), what you have is the Bailey fix\nright there. So, then what happens --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And you believe there is a\nbackground of life sentence? You agree with the\ngovernment that --\nMR. FISHER: I don't think that's\nnecessarily the case, Justice Scalia. This Court --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it either is or\nisn't. You --\nMR. FISHER: -- has said a couple of times\nthat this is a theoretical maximum sentence, but, surely,\nif nothing else, the Sentencing Reform Act sets a\nmaximum sentence here if it's not just a straight\ndeterminant sentence.\nAnd we've argued at length in the O'Brien\nbrief that the reasonableness requirement under 3553 of\nthe Sentencing Reform Act would have to set a maximum\nsentence. And for the reason I said at the outset,\ngiven that no one has ever received more than 10 years\nabsent a machinegun here, certainly that maximum\nsentence would be far less than life and far less than\n30 years. But --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: What's the -- I don't want\nto interrupt your nice organization here. But what is\nthe principle, the general rule, that you articulate to\nsupport the distinction between 30 being necessarily an\nelement and 7 a sentencing factor? What's the general\nrule here?\nMR. FISHER: Let me answer it --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Other than, this is\njust --\nMR. FISHER: If I might say one more --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- other than how awful this is.\nMR. FISHER: If I might say one more\nsentence to Justice Breyer, and then I'll answer that.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Please.\nMR. FISHER: Justice Breyer, the other thing\nI'd point out is that, so therefore, once you make the\nBailey fix, you just come -- in the old statute, then\nyou come to the machinegun provision, and you just leave\nit where it was. And, in fact, there are plenty of\nstatutes that we've cited in both briefs where there are\nelements in the middle, sandwiched between sentencing\nfactors.\nNow, Justice Kennedy, you asked the general\nprinciple. The general principle is this, at least in\nterms of this Court's Sixth Amendment law, is that: The\ncritical question to ask is whether the defendant could\nreceive the sentence the government seeks without the\nfact at issue.\nSeven years is a sentence the defendant here\ncould receive without the machinegun finding. Thirty years\nis absolutely off bounds.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Is that just based on\nempirical studies or is there guideline support for\nthat?\nMR. FISHER: There is both, Your Honor. Of\ncourse, the guidelines are not binding --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I understand. I understand\nthat.\nMR. FISHER: -- but the guideline sentences\nas -- as to this statute are pegged exactly to the\nmandatory minimums.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry. Could\notherwise receive under what? The sentence -- you say\n7 years is a sentence he could otherwise receive.\nMR. FISHER: Under the facts that either we\nprove to the jury or are admitted by the defendant.\nSo -- so in this case, the defendant could receive 7\nyears, and we've conceded that.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: There must be some\nstatutory provision that you -- that you -- that you\nrely upon.\nMR. FISHER: Oh, certainly, Justice Scalia.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Where does 7 years come\nfrom?\nMR. FISHER: Seven years comes from -- comes\nfrom the statute, for brandishing, which is what both\ndefendants had admitted that they did. Seven years --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes, but we know\nthat's a sentencing factor.\nMR. FISHER: But they've admitted it. So\nthey've waived any Sixth Amendment right as to that\nsentencing factor. We're willing to concede that. But\nthen you go to the guidelines, which sets a\n7-year -- a 7-year recommended sentence.\nUnder this Court's jurisprudence following\nBooker, we know that we take that recommendation and we\nplug it into section 3553(a), which, if you want the\nstatutory language, directs that a sentence \"no greater\nthan necessary to serve the following factors\" be\nintroduced -- I'm sorry, be imposed. And when you look\nat those factors, disparity is a factor this Court has\nleft in place and emphasized at every term since Booker,\nand the guideline sentence. And when you put -- plug\nthose things into the facts here, we simply suggest\nthere is no way that it would be upheld as substantively\nreasonable if the defendant got 30 years absent the\nmachinegun fact here.\nAnd we've also cited in our brief several\nplaces where the government itself makes this -- the\nmirror image of the argument that I'm making in the\npost-Booker, Gall, Rita world, when judges deviate\ndownward from the guidelines. They emphasize -- we\nquoted one Eleventh Circuit case in our brief where the\ngovernment got overturned, as substantively unreasonable,\na downward variance from a guideline recommendation,\nbecause no defendant had ever received such a low\nsentence.\nBut I don't have to, of course, hang my hat\non this -- on the strict application of Apprendi here.\nWe think there's also an even deeper problem that\npredates this Court's Apprendi jurisprudence, which was\nflagged by this Court as early as McMillan, where this\nCourt said that if what Congress does is step in\nand manipulate the elements of a crime in order\nto relieve the government of its obligation to prove\nordinary and traditional elements, then we have a pure\ndue process problem, irrespective of any Sixth Amendment\nproblem.\nNow, this Court has never found such a\nproblem, but I would emphasize that the --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How do we find it with\nthis statute, if there's a 10-year minimum/maximum\nunder (A) subdivision (iii) if the firearm is\ndischarged, and it's 10 years; and if it's a\nshort-barreled rifle under (B), it's also an equal\namount, of 10 years? I think that's what\nJustice Ginsburg was pointing to.\nSo the question I have for you is: How do\nwe find substantive unreasonableness?\nMR. FISHER: How do we find substantively\nunreasonable after Booker?\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Unreasonableness, that\nthere was an act of manipulation here, or intent to\nmanipulate.\nMR. FISHER: Well, if you're asking me the\nquestion -- I want to be sure I understand and answer the\nquestion. If you're asking me how applying the\nprinciple this Court first articulated in McMillan, and\nyou apply it here --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Exactly.\nMR. FISHER: I don't think you have to look\nany further -- well, there is two places you can look.\nYou can look both at the intent of Congress and the\neffect of what it did.\nThe intent of Congress, at least as\nhypothesized by the Solicitor General, is laid out at\npage 33 of its merits brief, where it says: What\nCongress was intending to do here is, quote, \"simplify\nand streamline guilt-stage proceedings\" by relieving the\ngovernment of its burden to prove this case -- this fact\nbeyond a reasonable doubt to the judge. So that strikes\none as, as this Court put it in Harris, an intent to\nevade the ordinary requirements in the Fifth and Sixth\nAmendments.\nThen, as to effect, you can look at what\nI've also -- what I've already emphasized, which is that\nthis sentence simply is not otherwise available, absent\nthat fact. And that, on its own, ought to tell this Court\nthat it's dealing with an element.\nBut if it wants to dig even deeper, it could\n-- it could describe it in terms of a 20-year increase\nover what the defendant would otherwise get or what,\nindeed, as we've said, anyone has ever gotten for this act,\nabsent a machinegun. It could do it in terms of percentage\nand say it's 83 percent higher; the Court used the phrase once,\n\"tail wagging the dog.\" I don't think it matters\nexactly what exact avenue this Court would pick. Again,\nif it were doing a constitutional analysis -- I'm\nspeaking right now constitutionally instead of\nstatutorily -- it would all end up at the same place.\nBut I want to make sure that I understood\nyour question also, with due respect to you, Justice\nGinsburg, because what I was talking about was 10 years under\n(A)(iii), of course, is a sentencing factor, as this Court\nheld in Dean, whereas under (B)(i), the same length of a\nsentence might be an element. That was a matter -- that\nwas a statutory answer, and I think, as a matter of\nstatutory construction, which is, of course, the first\nthing you're going to address in this case, what we\nthink we can win on without even reaching the\nconstitutional questions. And the differences would be,\napart from the same sentence, you have the structural\ndifference that I've emphasized. You have the tradition.\nAnd let me say a word about tradition, if I\nmight. The government emphasizes the guidelines and\nother kinds of statutes. When this Court applies the\ntradition canon that it established in Almendarez-Torres\nand Castillo, I don't know why you have to look any\nfurther than Castillo itself to answer the tradition\nquestion. In Jones, as this Court put it, the reason we\nlook to tradition is because if it's a close case, we're\ngoing to not assume that Congress intended a radical\ndeparture from past practice. Well, the past practice\nhere is absolutely unequivocal. This Court held in\nCastillo, 9-0, that Congress intended this to be an\nelement.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, the Court's --\nthe Court's opinion in Castillo quite carefully noted\nthat it wasn't addressing this statute. I think it's a\nlittle bit of a bait-and-switch to say that, well,\nCastillo decides this case.\nMR. FISHER: I don't contend that Castillo\nabsolutely decides the case. My contention that I was\ntrying to make is that when this Court looks to\ntradition for purposes of construing the new amendments,\nthat Castillo gives the answer on -- at least on\ntradition, at least as applying that particular\nquestion. Because Congress, we know, intended it to be\nan element at least until 1998.\nBut I think that even -- even if you were to\nstep back from the Castillo analysis itself and the\nCastillo factors themselves, you would also, I think, do\nwell to give -- again, not dispositive, but -- but\ncareful treatment to Castillo, because Congress steps\nin, of course, and amends statutes all the time. They\nstep in and they amend one portion of a statute, and\nwhile they are at it, we know from the manuals that we've\ncited and from the examples in the back of the O'Brien\nbrief that Congress often, while they're amending one\npart, they reorganize or reword other parts of the\nstatute.\nAnd this Court, across its statutory\ninterpretation jurisprudence, within criminal law and\noutside, has always said that once we say the law means\nsomething, we're not going to assume that Congress\nchanged the law unless we get some sort of clear\nindication from Congress that it -- that it intended to\nchange the law.\nNow, here, as I think has been emphasized,\nbut I'll just reiterate, there's not a peep of\nanything in the legislative history or anything to\nsuggest that Congress was -- was intending to change the\nlaw here. And, in fact, it's not even a mere silence\ncase. We know quite clearly and affirmatively that\nCongress was intending to do something entirely\ndifferent, which was respond to this Court's Bailey\ndecision.\nBut even in the language -- and the only\nthing I think the Solicitor General even has for it in\nthis case is the language and structure, which are some\ndifferent words and different placement that it can at\nleast build an argument off of, because the other four\nof the five Castillo factors are entirely unchanged.\nBut even the language, we submit, is a far cry from the\nkind of change this Court ought to require before it\ndoes a 180-degree switch as to what it had said the\nprior law meant.\nJust for purposes of stability in the law,\nif nothing else, I think this -- it behooves this Court\nto take its prior decisions seriously and to -- and to\nengage in a dialogue with Congress that encourages\nCongress to be clear when it wants to change what the\nprior law is.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The prior statute -- which\nwas 18 U.S.C. 924(c)(1), right? That did deal with\nshort-barreled rifle, short-barreled shotgun,\nmachinegun, and so forth, but that's -- that provision\ndidn't say anything about brandishing or discharge.\nWhere -- what was -- how were they treated under the\nprior law?\nMR. FISHER: They -- as you say, they were\nnot in the statute itself. My understanding is that\njudges as -- on an ad hoc basis, would have treated\nthose as sentencing factors.\nAnd what Congress did -- when it came in to\nrespond to this Court's Bailey decision, I think it\ncodified all of the different manners of using the gun\nin the context of one of these crimes. So it not just\ndealt with, yes, possessing ought to be covered, but it\ntalked about other manners, brandishing and discharging.\nIn Castillo, this Court emphasized again the big\ndifference between manner of using a gun and the type of\nfirearm which lies at the core of this offense.\nIf I would turn -- if I would leave the\nCourt with nothing else, let me emphasize again to the\nCourt the difference between this statute, which I think\nthe government wants you to think is no different in\nintent, effect, or operation than the two that this\nCourt prior -- dealt with in Harris, as a matter of both\nstatutory construction and constitutional law, and in\nMcMillan, as a matter of constitutional law.\nWhat this Court emphasized in both of those\ncases was that there was a preexisting law on the books\nthat criminalized certain activity. And then a\nlegislature later stepped in and set a mandatory minimum\nfor a particular fact that could accompany the crime at\nissue. And it did so in a very minor way. For example,\nin Pennsylvania, the various crimes covered by the\nfirearm mandatory minimum in that case gave 10-, 20-year\nsentences routinely, and all the Pennsylvania\nlegislature did was step in and say: If he uses a gun,\nwe want at least 5 years. And in Harris, as I've\njust emphasized, I think, in discussing with\nJustice Scalia, the Court dealt with a bump of just 2\nyears. Again, what judges were already customarily\ndoing, I think, under the statute.\nHere, this is entirely and dramatically\ndifferent. Here, the fact allows a sentence -- indeed,\nrequires a sentence -- that is 20 years longer than\nanyone has ever gotten for this conduct at issue. That\nis a difference not just -- it's not a minor difference.\nIt is a categorically different difference that we think\nis enough, combined with other principles of statutory\nand constitutional interpretation, to -- I'm sorry,\nstatutory interpretation to resolve this case on the\nstatute alone.\nBut if you need to look to the Constitution,\nwe think that the Sixth Amendment, either as the\nbright-line rule articulated in Apprendi dictates that\nany fact that allows a greater sentence than the\ndefendant could otherwise receive is subject to the\nSixth Amendment, or sort of plain, pure due process,\ntail-that-wags-the-dog analysis, that this Court\nemphasized in McMillan -- either of those would be\nenough, and indeed require, a finding of\nunconstitutionality here and a finding this Court\ncan avoid.\nAnd if nothing else, Justice Breyer, I would\nsay that we think that this case can be resolved on statutory\ngrounds. We think there are narrower constitutional\narguments that would either require reading it narrowly\nor striking it down if you had to, on even narrower\ngrounds. But if nothing else, then we would ask this\nCourt to revisit Harris, if necessary.\nWe don't think it's necessary to resolve the\ncase for us here, but we think that would be appropriate\nif it -- if it needed to get there.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: It's a collateral point:\nDoes the government have to show, or does the -- don't\nyou have to find that the machinegun is operable?\nMR. FISHER: I assume so, but I don't know\nthe specific answer to that, Justice Kennedy. What\nthere is a dispute about, of course, is whether the --\nif it were a sentencing factor, whether the government\nhas to prove knowledge. And we do emphasize that that\nwould be an alternative basis for this Court to decide\nthis case, by saying you at least have to prove\nknowledge even if it's a sentencing factor.\nAnd let me just leave you with this, unless\nthere are any further questions: The government makes a\ncouple points in its reply brief suggesting that certain\narguments were not preserved or made properly in this\ncase. The knowledge argument that I just referred to is\nraised in the brief in opposition for Mr. O'Brien at\npages 23 to 25. So under rule 15 of this Court, that\nargument was properly presented at the cert stage. You\nwill also find that argument at pages 34 to 37 of the Joint\nAppendix.\nAlso with respect to the Sixth Amendment\nsubstantive reasonableness as-applied argument, the\ngovernment suggests that for some reason, that would be\ninappropriate for this Court to reach or rely on.\nAgain, we disagree. First of all, we can't understand\nwhy it would be inappropriate to reach or rely on that\nconstitutional argument, whereas it is apparently\nappropriate for this Court to address the McMillan\nargument or the \"overrule Harris\" argument. They're\nall three constitutional arguments that are present in\nthis case. And, again, if there were any doubt they\nwere raised below, pages 38 and 39 of Mr. Burgess's\nFirst Circuit brief, pages 32 to 35 of Mr. O'Brien's\nFirst Circuit brief, and in the brief in opposition,\nwhich the government, in its reply brief at the cert\nstage, responded to without claiming any error or any\nwaiver problems. So we think absolutely all the\narguments that are made in the blue -- in the red briefs\nare clearly before you.\nIf the Court has any additional questions, I\nwould be happy to entertain them. Otherwise, I am\nprepared to submit the case.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Fisher.\nMr. Horwich, you have 4 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF BENJAMIN HORWICH\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. HORWICH: Thank you.\nJustice Kennedy, just to answer your\nquestion: The definition of \"firearm\" in 921(a)(3)\nincludes a weapon that is designed to expel a\nprojectile, so one that can be restored to do so also\nqualifies as a firearm for purposes of the statute.\nMy friend made the comment that brandishing\nand discharge would have been treated, under the old\nstatute, as sentencing factors. But they couldn't be,\nbecause the old statute had determinant sentences, and\nbrandishing and discharge weren't relevant to it. So\nthere wouldn't be a higher sentence for those.\nAnd that -- that reveals sort of a basic\nflaw in this notion that somehow those can be treated as\nsentencing factors, but Congress wasn't embarking on a\ngeneral litany of sentencing factors. Congress inserted\nthose to be sentencing factors, as the Court recognized\nin Harris. Then what it did is move the firearm-type\nprovisions next in line, because that's what it thought\nof them as, not as elements. It moved them away. And\nthen it goes on to recidivism, which is also a sentencing\nfactor.\nSo the overall result, then, of the statute\nis that it's sort of an instruction manual. The first\nthing that comes up is the elements; that's what the\njudge uses to charge the jury or take a plea. That\nends. The statute takes up the next topic, which is\nsentencing. The judge needs to ascertain the limits of\nhis discretion. And then the statute ends with some\ntechnical considerations.\nThat -- that approach is entirely in line\nwith the sentencing factor tradition, and that's --\nthat seems to be what Congress intended. But my friend's\nunderstanding of the statute is sort of this disorganized\njumble, and he's making very much of the idea that when\nCongress revises a statute, it tries to confront -- it\ntries to make it better, on his view.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Is there anything\nother -- do we have anything other than the statute\nitself? When I looked at the statute itself, I thought,\nwell, all that's happened here is nobody's thought of\nthis issue at all; nobody's read Castillo. What really\nhappened is somebody in the legislative drafting section\nwas focusing on what he said they were focusing on,\nBailey, and then they have a form manual. So they\nfollowed the form manual.\nNow, is there anything to suggest that isn't\nwhat happened?\nMR. HORWICH: Well, there is no legislative\nhistory, but there is the fact that the form manual says\nif you're going to embark on this, here are some ideas\nfor how to do it. But it doesn't tell you -- it does\nnot tell Congress substantively what it should do.\nSomeone had to make a choice to write that introductory\nlanguage, \"a person convicted of a violation.\" And that\nis what Congress passed, and so Congress intended that\nthose things, firearm type, that follow that are\nrelevant after the person has been convicted of a\nviolation.\nOne final answer to your question\nJustice Scalia, about the life maximum. This Court\nheld -- in Custis v. United States interpreted the same\nlanguage, \"not less than\" a certain number of years.\nThat's in 924(e) of the Armed Career Criminal Act. The\nCourt held that to have a life maximum sentence there.\nSo I think the same would apply -- the same would apply\nhere.\nAnd so the final thing I would want the\nCourt to take away then from this is that Congress is\nusing firearm type to channel a sentencing judge's\ndiscretion. The life maximum exists in all cases.\nThere have been cases sentenced up to life even where\nthat was far above the minimum. And when Congress does\nthat, it uses a sentencing factor. It doesn't create\ngreater and lesser included offenses for the jury; it\ndoes it by addressing the person who is in charge of\nsentencing, which is the judge, and giving him a rule of\ndecision. That's what the text and the structure\nindicate here and that's what the Court should hold.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
