LAMKEN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. LAMKEN: Thank you, Justice Stevens. May it\nplease the Court:\nThis case concerns whether Congress, in enacting\nsection 332(c)(7) of the Communications Act, intended to\nexpose local governments and State and local officials to\nexpansive section 1983 liability with the tens of\nthousands of wireless antenna zoning decisions they must\nmake each year.\nEntitled preservation of local zoning authority,\nsection 332 provides for State and local agencies in the\nfirst instance to implement specific Federal substantive\nand procedural requirements, together with preserved State\nzoning laws, in passing on applications to build or modify\nwireless towers. It then provides a highly distinctive,\nindependent cause of action for accelerated judicial\nreview of the decisions, including a short limitations\nperiod and mandatory expedition. That tailored process is\nsufficiently comprehensive to evidence Congress' intent\nfor enforcement to occur --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, Mr. Lamken, it's not as\ncomprehensive as other schemes where the Court said, on\nthat basis, we would not find a section 1983 cause of\naction, is it? I mean, it's -- it's more spare.\nMR. LAMKEN: It -- it is unusual in its unique\nfocus on private enforcement, but there was a reason for\nthe focus on private enforcement. In other provisions of\nthe Communications Act, the Congress chose -- for example,\nsection 253, Congress chose to eliminate enforcement at --\nat the FCC level because it was concerned that State and\nlocal governments often wouldn't have enough -- excuse me\n-- local governments in particular --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, what -- what --\nMR. LAMKEN: -- wouldn't be able to -- I'm\nsorry.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: What would you think of a\ncase where the plaintiff alleges that the antenna zoning\nwas the -- was caused by racial discrimination against the\napplicant? Would there be a 1983 cause of action, do you\nsuppose?\nMR. LAMKEN: Yes. That would still be available\nbecause the -- the section 332(c)(7)(B)(v) only provides\nfor a cause of action for violations of the Communications\nAct. Violations of the Constitution continue to be\nenforceable directly under section 1983.\nSection -- section 332(c)(7)(B)(v) is\ncomprehensive in the relevant sense in that for every\nviolation of section 332(c)(7), for every person adversely\naggrieved, it provides a mechanism for private judicial\nenforcement. In addition --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, what about -- it -- it\n-- section 332 speaks of an award of all appropriate\nrelief. What does that include? Could it include\npunitive damages? Could it include attorney's fees, do\nyou think?\nMR. LAMKEN: In that respect, it is\nindistinguishable -- for example, the statute that was at\nissue in Smith v. Robinson, and it doesn't specify the\nprecise forms of relief available. In our view in this\ncase, appropriate relief would mean specific relief, the\ntype of relief that is traditionally given on review of\nzoning decisions and on review of judicial review of\nagency action. That's supported by a number of\nconsiderations.\nI should point out, in the first instance, that\nin this case respondent never did seek damages, or\npunitive damages for that matter, under section\n332(c)(7)(B)(v) itself.\nBut that's supported by a number of\nconsiderations.\nFirst is the structure of the act, which\npresents it as a form of judicial review of agency action.\nThe act is structured much as you have -- much as you\nwould when a Federal agency enforces or implements Federal\nrequirements and are subject to judicial review. The only\ndifference is that Congress swapped in, effectively, State\nand local agencies with the initial implementers in place\nof the Federal Government. In that respect, it shares\nsome of the characteristics of sections 251 and 252 of the\nCommunications Act which are also implemented by local --\nby -- excuse me -- by State governments as opposed to the\nFCC.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. -- Mr. Lamken, the\nargument has been made that 4 years before the\ntelecommunications act we're talking about was adopted,\nCongress adopted the Cable TV Consumer Protection Act.\nAnd in that act, it specifically limited the remedies to\ndeclaratory and injunctive relief. Here we face silence.\nIsn't that an indication that when Congress wants to limit\nrelief to declaratory and injunctive, it will say so in\nthe -- in the measure?\nMR. LAMKEN: Justice Ginsburg, that -- that's an\nexample where Congress, for a broad range of statutes that\ncould be potentially used to enforce the Cable Act, chose\nto restrict the forms of relief available. And it is an\nexample, in the words of Sea Clammers, where Congress has\nmade its intent explicit in the text of the statute.\nCongress can also by implication limit the forms\nof -- excuse me -- limit the mechanism for relief that's\navailable, and that's our position here, that Congress by\nproviding --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: What's the -- what's the source\nof the implication?\nMR. LAMKEN: Pardon?\nJUSTICE SOUTER: You say by implication.\nMR. LAMKEN: The implication -- Congress has\nprovided a specific mechanism for judicial relief here,\nsection 332(c)(7)(B)(v) itself, and that is a highly\nadapted mechanism which includes unique characteristics\nsuch as a very short limitations period.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So -- so the -- the\nimplication, I -- I guess, is that unless it specifically\nprovides for damages, it implicitly does not.\nMR. LAMKEN: I'm sorry. In terms of Congress\nmaking damages available under 332(c)(7)(B)(v), our view\nof the damage -- mind you damages are only one of the\ndifferences we think that exists here, but our view is\nsupported by a number of considerations, in addition to\nthe structure of the statute. For example, appropriate\nrelief is often -- is the traditional form of relief\navailable. In this context traditional relief was always\nspecific relief. Congress also included a specific\nsavings clause that extends not merely to Federal\nstatutes, but prohibits the impairment --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. Where -- where are\nyou getting the term, appropriate relief, from?\nMR. LAMKEN: This -- that comes from this\nCourt's decision in Franklin, that where Congress doesn't\nspecifically identify the specific forms of relief\navailable --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: All right. But that's --\nthat's not in the -- that's not in the text of this\nstatute, is it?\nMR. LAMKEN: No, it isn't. It is an inference\nthe Court draws from silence. When the Court -- when\nCongress provides an express cause of action and does not\nidentify the specific forms of relief available, the Court\nwill infer that Congress intended to provide all\nappropriate relief. But the term, appropriate relief, is\nthat relief which Congress would have intended, and when\nthe Court is determining that, it takes a look at what the\ntraditional forms of relief are and it will look at things\nsuch as the savings clause in 601(c), which expressly says\nthat the statute should not be read, unless it expressly\nprovides, to supersede, impair, or otherwise modify State\nand local law, as well as Federal law. And in order to\nput damages into the statute, if it doesn't provide\ndamages expressly, one would have to impair myriad\nmunicipal immunity laws that otherwise protect\nmunicipalities and State and local officers implementing\nzoning requirements from liability.\nFinally, the FCC has --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And -- and 1983 is not subject\nto that limitation.\nMR. LAMKEN: Well, 1983 is expressly preemptive\nunder this Court's decisions, and it is -- it would\npreempt the State laws by its own force. But we believe\nthat that also supports Congress' decision not to provide\n-- or supports the conclusion that Congress did not intend\nto provide section 1983 relief here because the effect of\nmaking the Communications Act enforceable under section\n1983 would be to expand the categories of claims for which\n-- that -- those immunities are unavailable, and it would\nthereby impair those immunities.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But are they only immune from\ndamages action or are they immune from suit?\nMR. LAMKEN: No. They're generally immunities\n-- immune from damages actions, not from suits.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So, I mean, that proves too\nmuch because they -- the statute obviously intends to\neliminate that immunity. The immunity from suit is -- is\nclearly --\nMR. LAMKEN: Oh, I think -- I think you may have\nmisunderstood. The immunity is not from suit. It's an\nimmunity from damages and the impairment would be the\nimmunity from damages. Section 332 is not designed to\nimpair the municipal immunity statutes, and they are not\nimmunities from suit. They are generally from damage\nliability. The officers are subject to suit because these\nare subject --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it allows suit against\neither municipalities or States, State or local\ngovernments. Right?\nMR. LAMKEN: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And the States have immunity\nnot just from damages but from suit.\nMR. LAMKEN: As a constitutional matter, they\nhave an immunity from suit, but --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Unless they have chosen to\nwaive it, which --\nMR. LAMKEN: Right.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- one must assume in this area\nthey haven't.\nMR. LAMKEN: Right.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So you have to regard this\nprovision as intentionally overriding some provisions of\nState law in -- inasmuch as they apply to -- to immunity.\nMR. LAMKEN: Well, first of all, I don't think\nit would be read to -- to override the State's\nconstitutional immunity to suit.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No. That's --\nMR. LAMKEN: But it would be read to -- it would\nbe read to override immunities to suit that exist under\nState law because otherwise it couldn't be affected.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: In for a penny, in for a pound.\nMR. LAMKEN: Right.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: If they've -- if they've\nwaived --\nMR. LAMKEN: But I'm not --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: If -- if you acknowledge that\nit was intended to affect their immunity from suit, why --\nwhy would we suspect that it was not intended to affect\ntheir immunity from damages?\nMR. LAMKEN: Well, because it would be -- it\nwould be a provision with no effect whatsoever if it\ndidn't override immunities to suit.\nBut I'm not sure there are provisions that are\nproviding for -- I mean, that there are myriad damages\nimmunity laws that provide municipalities absolute\nimmunity from suit. It's fairly common, at least under\nCalifornia and other State law, for municipalities to be\nsubject to suit for review of their -- of the actions that\nthey make. And that is the typical fashion that this --\nthis statute simply incorporated that typical fashion of\nproviding judicial review of agency action.\nAnother consideration that supports the view\nthat section 1983 has been displaced is that the act\nprovides an entire process for the implementation of the\nFederal statutes. It establishes Federal substantive\nrequirements that identifies the agencies to implement\nthem. It provides Federal procedural guarantees, APA-\nlike guarantees, like the requirement of substantial\nevidence, like the requirement of a written decision, like\nthe requirement of a decision with a reasonable period of\ntime.\nIt then follows up with a mechanism, an adapted\nmechanism for judicial review. In that sense, it is very\nmuch like the statute at issue in Smith v. Robinson.\nThat elaborate process is particularly\nsignificant given the pattern of the Communications Act as\na whole. The Communications Act repeatedly matches\nspecific regulatory requirements such as, for example, the\ncommon carrier requirements in 202 and 203, with\ncorresponding mechanisms for private enforcement, such as\nan action for suit -- I mean, an action for damages in\ncourt or an enforcement action in the commission in\nsections 206 and 207.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Does this action have to be\nbrought in Federal court? It says any court of competent\njurisdiction. Could --\nMR. LAMKEN: Yes. The action can be brought in\nState court and often is. There are about 50 reported\ndecisions that we have found where the suit has been\nbrought in State court. I haven't seen a particular\npattern between the choice, but Congress gave the option.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Would a State court be free to\naward damages or would that be preempted under the view\nyou take of the statute?\nMR. LAMKEN: The State -- because there's an\nexpress preservation of State law in this context, I think\nthat State -- States would be free to award damages under\ntheir own laws. They wouldn't -- whatever relief is\navailable under the Federal statute would be available\nunder the available under the Federal statute, and State\ncourts wouldn't be free to second-guess Congress' judgment\nas to what relief should be provided under Federal\nstatute.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: If the State court allowed\ndamages -- if -- if the State system allowed -- State law\nallowed damages, would the Federal court, in an action\nunder this section, be allowed to award damages under that\n-- under the State statute?\nMR. LAMKEN: Your Honor, I think since the --\nthe provision, the savings clause, says that the statute\nshould not be construed to impair State law -- and there\nare so many municipal immunity statutes and you would only\nhave one construction of the statute -- I believe that the\nconstruction would be an across-the-boards construction,\nthat this act does not provide damages and you would not\nvary from State to State.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: What if the State law\nauthorized the recovery of attorney's fees? Would they be\nrecoverable?\nMR. LAMKEN: Pardon?\nJUSTICE STEVENS: What if the State law\nauthorized the recovery of attorney's fees?\nMR. LAMKEN: Well --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: What would you do then?\nMR. LAMKEN: If the State law provides for\nrecovery of attorney's fees for State violations, then\nthat would control for State violations. For violations\nof Federal law, the -- the remedies that Congress chose to\nprovide would control and the States would not be\npermitted to second-guess the -- the remedies --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I'm not sure why that would be\nif you, in fact, see the statute as trying to impose an\nAPA-like structure, saying to the States, you decide the\nsubstance, we'll give you minimum elements of form, which\nhelps your position. Then if the minimum elements of form\nare not specifically stated in the statute, there's no\nreason to interfere with the States. Let them do what\nthey want. Only those minimum elements are what you can't\ndo. That works perfectly for you.\nMR. LAMKEN: Justice Breyer --\nJUSTICE BREYER: It's strongly supported in the\nhistory. It may lose your client the money. I don't\nknow.\nMR. LAMKEN: Well, in fact, California provides\na municipal immunity for permitting decisions, and so my\nclient --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So then you're only --\nMR. LAMKEN: -- would be fine with your\nposition. But that is a potential inference. My -- the\nnormal view would be that where Congress provides a -- a\nstatute, one would normally presume that Congress intended\na particular set of remedies to accompany it. You could\nsay that the silence is meant to -- meant to reflect the\nfact that Congress knew that these would be enforced in\nState courts, as well as Federal, and it would allow State\ncourts --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Congress didn't care.\nMR. LAMKEN: -- to use whatever --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Congress wanted to substitute a\nFederal judgment for the judgment of the States where it\nsaid so. And the reason you know that is because that is\nwhat is consistent with the purpose of the act and other\nthings are either neutral or negative. Don't interfere\nwith the State unless you have to.\nMR. LAMKEN: That is one of our principal\ncontentions, Justice Breyer, which is --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And what, Mr. Lamken, would\nbe the normal procedure in the State? You make an\napplication for a permit to a zoning board. What is the\nstandard operating procedure under State law? Suppose we\ndon't have any telecommunications act in the picture.\nMR. LAMKEN: The normal procedure is either\nunder a uniform State law or California law. If you have\na -- an entity which is -- excuse me. If you have either\na planning commission or sometimes there's another entity\nthat does the initial review and makes a determination\nwhether to grant the permit. It is then appealable either\nto a zoning board of adjustment -- that's the -- the model\nact -- or in California, States -- localities have the\noption of having the appeal go to the local legislature.\nThat appeal is then reviewed -- is then determined. And\nfinally, once you've gone through that process, under\nCalifornia law it's generally reviewable by a writ of\nmandate, although other -- other States provide review by\nwrit of certiorari, by mandamus, or by various other\nprocedures, almost always subject to a short limitations\nperiod, almost always short -- requiring finality, a final\ndecision, exhaustion through the State process.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And the remedies being\ninjunctive and declaratory.\nMR. LAMKEN: A -- a form of specific relief.\nGenerally they have the authority to effectively go in and\nrevise the decision below, but the remedies ordinarily do\nnot include monetary or compensatory relief I should say.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Are you saying that it's\nparallel to what APA review of an agency decision would\nbe?\nMR. LAMKEN: It's very much like that. The\nremand rule that this Court normally requires in the APA\ncontext is not so strictly observed in the context of --\nof review of -- judicial review of zoning decisions, but\nit is very much like APA review. That is what prevails.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: It -- it seems to me that the\n30-day provision is inconsistent with the award of\ndamages, but after I say that, I can't tell you why.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. LAMKEN: Well, actually this Court's\ndecision in Burnett v. Grattan actually tells you why, and\nthat is that 30-day provisions, which are typical for on-\nthe-record review of decisions below, are often\ninsufficient to allow somebody to develop a whole new\nrecord such as their proof of damages, to make important\ndecisions if they're going to have, for example, a jury\ntrial, or to prepare for discovery. And that's why 30-\nday provisions are not entirely uncommon in the area of\njudicial review of agency action, but they're wholly\nunprecedented, for the most part that I know of, in the\narea of tort-like remedies like section 1983.\nIf I -- if there are no further questions, I\nwould like to reserve the remainder of my time for\nrebuttal.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, you may.\nMr. Feldman.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES A. FELDMAN\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,\nAS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS\nMR. FELDMAN: Justice Stevens, and may it please\nthe Court:\nWhere Congress creates a special cause of action\nfor -- for a violation of a Federal law that necessarily\ncarries with it its own features and incidents, Congress'\ndecisions about the appropriate mechanisms for dealing\nwith that violation of Federal law should not be\nfrustrated or overridden by allowing a 1983 action in\naddition.\nIn this case, section 332(c)(7)(B)(v), which\ncreates a cause of action for violation of the specific\nstandards in (i) through (iv) is an independent,\nstandalone cause of action. If 1983 didn't exist,\n332(c)(7)(B)(v) would, undoubtedly, still provide\nplaintiffs with a mechanism to get into court and attain\nredress for the legal wrongs that they claim.\nWhere Congress has taken that step and has\nthought about what the appropriate remedy should be for a\nviolation of a particular Federal statute and has created\na judicial remedy, then it would only frustrate --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: But it -- the statute,\nthough, is silent on the question of damages or attorney's\nfees, isn't it?\nMR. FELDMAN: It is. It doesn't say anything\nexpressly about either of those things, but I think it has\nlong been --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Can we infer all appropriate\nrelief? Do we?\nMR. FELDMAN: As a matter of damages, I think\nall appropriate relief would be the standard. But as a\nmatter of attorney's fees, I think is a good example of\nwhy there shouldn't be a 1983 action here because the law\nis 100 percent clear, from this Court's decision in\nAlyeska and other cases, that where Congress hasn't\nprovided for fee-shifting, there simply is no fee-shifting\nauthorized. That's what they intended.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Attorney's fees are never\nappropriate, in other words.\nMR. FELDMAN: Are never appropriate unless\nCongress specifically provides for them.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But it has provided for them\nfor a 1983 action, and if it's a 1983 action, it takes\ncare of it.\nMR. FELDMAN: That's right.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And this is kind of circular.\nMR. FELDMAN: I don't think it's circular\nbecause I think when Congress created the specific cause\nof action here in (B)(v), it didn't provide for attorney's\nfees and therefore intended that attorney's fees not be\nprovided. If respondent's view in this case were\naccepted, the -- the presumption would be exactly flipped,\nand Congress would have had --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Feldman --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose Congress said\nspecifically 1983 applies. That's all it says. Would\nthat carry with it attorney's fees in your view?\nMR. FELDMAN: Yes, I -- yes, I think it -- I\nthink it would.\nThe question here, though, is where Congress has\nthought about what kind of remedy it wants for violation\nof a Federal statute and created a judicial cause of\naction for every wrong that's -- that -- that can exist\nunder that statute, then the incidents and features of\nthat cause of action should govern, not the incidents and\nfeatures of 1983 which almost inevitably and in this case\nare different. And attorney's fees is just the best\nexample of that.\nIf -- under respondent's view -- when Congress\nwas fashioning this statute, it certainly was aware of\nthis Court's decisions that have repeatedly said that\nattorney's fees are not available unless they're expressly\nprovided for. And indeed, elsewhere in the Communications\nAct --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I take -- you -- you\ntake the position that 1983 doesn't apply at all. It's\nnot just attorney's fees. It's damages.\nMR. FELDMAN: That's right. But it's just an\nillustration. There's other differences between the\nprovision here and 1983, but I think the basic point is\nthat where Congress has given thought to the remedy for a\nparticular violation -- type of violation of Federal law\nand has provided for a judicial cause of action, with\nwhatever features and incidents it -- it wants, 1983\nshouldn't be allowed in. It should be assumed that\nCongress didn't want to have its decisions frustrated by\nalso allowing a 1983 action.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What about damages?\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Do you -- do you think that\nany other provisions of the Communications Act are\nenforceable under 1983? I mean, we're talking about 332,\nbut it's a big, complicated act. Are any of the other\nprovisions enforceable?\nMR. FELDMAN: I think -- I think the same rule\nwould apply to any of the provisions where Congress has\nspecifically provided for a cause of action for the same\nreason, otherwise Congress when -- here, for example, just\nto return to attorney's fees for a second. When Congress\nwas framing this legislation, they knew that they weren't\ngiving attorney's fees and this 332(c)(7)(B)(v) would be\nconstrued not to give attorney's fees, but not --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, this is really a more\ngeneral proposition you're urging upon us then, that\nwhenever Congress creates a cause of action that is --\nwhat -- in any respect more limited than section 1983, the\nbackground action of section 1983 is not available.\nMR. FELDMAN: That -- I -- I think that's\ncorrect.\nJUSTICE BREYER: No. How could that be?\nWouldn't it depend on whether -- when you look at the\nparticular statute, the particular set of remedies that\nCongress has included in that statute could be absolutely\nindependent of 1983 or dependent upon 1983 or leaning in\nfavor or leaning against. It would depend on the\nparticular statute. Why in general?\nMR. FELDMAN: I think in -- I think the rule\nwould be in general because, first of all, it's not just\nremedies. There's other incidents of a cause of action\nsuch as statute of limitations, the provision here for\nexpedition, and other things. And really when Congress\nhas given thought to what remedy it wants for a violation\nhere of (i) through (iv), for a violation elsewhere in the\nCommunications Act of other Federal standards, it\nshouldn't be assumed that they all -- that -- to allow a\n1983 action would just frustrate Congress' intent in\nfashioning that particular remedy.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Then how would you ever have\na statute that -- 1983 provides for relief when there's a\nviolation of Federal law, statutory or constitutional.\nOne of the briefs in this very case says that your broad\nreading means that you were doing away with statute as a\nbasis for 1983.\nMR. FELDMAN: I -- I think that that's\ncompletely wrong. When Congress has created -- has\nrecognized a right, as this Court has found is essential\nfor a 1983 action, and it hasn't done anything about\nproviding a remedy for that right, hasn't created a cause\nof action in court in particular, then that's the function\nof 1983, is to serve -- it provides a cause of action for\npeople who suffer a violation of that wrong, a statutory\nviolation.\nBut where Congress has given thought to what\nkind of a relief it wanted and it said we want a cause of\naction with these such-and-such incidents, no attorney's\nfees, 30-day statute of limitations, expedition, whatever\nthe other ones are here, then it would just frustrate\nCongress' intent to say, oh, and also you get a 1983\naction to undo all of the things that Congress provided\nfor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, there -- there are two\nsituations. I mean, one can supplement without\nfrustrating. I mean, you -- you could say that in, you\nknow -- in some respects the 1983 will contradict the\naction that was provided, but one can conceive of a\nprovided action that -- that grants relief which 1983\nwould not grant.\nMR. FELDMAN: That's right. And -- and I --\nwhatever -- I guess the general point would be whatever\nremedial decisions Congress made, those should be\nrespected, but I would add in this case it's not just --\nit's a question of attorney's fees, which they would have\nhad to -- Congress would have had to do something very\nunusual here, which is particularly put in this statute no\n-- there shall be no fee-shifting because otherwise you\ncan always go to 1983 and get it. In fact, even if they\nhad done that in 332(c)(7)(B)(v), respondents would still\nargue, well, we still have our 1983 action.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What -- what about damages? Do\n-- do you take any position on whether the Communications\nAct provision enables damages to be collected?\nMR. FELDMAN: We don't have a position on\nwhether it does. I think there's arguments both ways. I\nwould point out --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You think it's unnecessary to\ndecide this case.\nMR. FELDMAN: I think it is unnecessary, and in\nfact, I think it shows a problem with -- a reason why our\nview, which is if Congress creates a cause of action, that\nshould be respected -- why that should be respected.\nUnder other views, you have to look at the 1983\naction and figure out all of its incidents. You have to\nlook at the 332 action and figure out all of its incidents\nin the abstract as here, not where -- in connection with a\nparticular claim for damages, and then see whether they're\nconsistent with each other.\nI think the much better rule would be to say\nwhere Congress has created a specific cause of action,\nthat's what it wanted, and whatever you get under that,\nyou get. Whatever you don't get under that, you don't\nget. But 1983 shouldn't be used to -- to frustrate\nCongress' intent and give you things that that cause of\naction wouldn't to give you a longer statute of\nlimitations, which would be, I think, the case here, to\ngive you -- eliminate the provision for mandatory\nexpedition, to have any differences in damages.\nAnother way to put it would be under the Court's\ndecision in Franklin, this statute gives you any\nappropriate relief. All that 1983 could do here -- it\nmaybe gives you the same thing in which, as far as that\ngoes, it doesn't matter. But all it could do otherwise\nwould be give you inappropriate relief, i.e., relief that\nCongress didn't want.\nAnd instead of construing the two statutes in\nthat way, they should be construed harmoniously and in\naccord with this Court's decisions which have set forth\nthe line of cases where you have a right to get into court\nin Wilder -- I'm sorry -- in -- in Sea Clammers and Smith\nagainst Robinson and said there we want to take Congress'\nremedy, however simple or complex it is. It gives you a\ncomplete right to get into court and gives you whatever it\ngives you. And that should govern.\nAnd then the other line of cases, which is\nWilder where -- and -- where it says -- and the Wright\nagainst Roanoke where Congress didn't give you a right to\nget to court -- get into court. In those cases, that's\nthe function of 1983.\nThe same thing would be true in -- in a number\nof other this Court's cases that have recognized you have\na 1983 action when Congress gave you a right and didn't\nthink at all about the remedy because that's the function\nthat 1983 was supposed to serve.\nIf there's no further questions.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you, Mr. Feldman.\nMr. Waxman.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. WAXMAN: Mr. Justice Stevens, and may it\nplease the Court:\nIn -- by its clear text, section 1983 promises\nredress for the depravation of any Federal right in any,\nquote, proper proceeding. And that expansive language,\nthis Court has recognized, dictates a heavy presumption\nthat its remedies apply to all violations of Federal\nrights, a presumption which this Court has said is\nrebutted only in the, quote, exceptional case in which the\nstatute that creates the right is accompanied by an\nenforcement scheme that is, quote, incompatible with or\ninconsistent with 1983's remedies. That's --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Waxman.\nMR. WAXMAN: -- the background principle.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Waxman, it seems to me that\nthe -- the best argument we've heard about incompatibility\nis the one -- or at least I think the best -- is the one\nthat Mr. Lamken touched on at the tail end of his\nargument, and that is, he said there's -- there's a 30-\nday provision in there, which in effect says Congress\nwants this litigation conducted fast and over with fast.\nAnd that is incompatible with a damage action because if\nyou get into a damage action, you are going to get into\nthe panoply of -- of damages litigation, including\ndepositions, and -- and the one thing you can guarantee is\nthat it is not going to be over expeditiously.\nWhat is your argument? What is your response to\nthat incompatibility argument?\nMR. WAXMAN: Well, I think that the way this\nCourt has interpreted incompatibility before -- in the two\ninstances in 25 years since Maine v. Thiboutot was\ndecided, the only instances in which this Court has found\nincompatibility has been where use of 1983 would create an\nend run around limitations in the statute. That is, in\nthe -- in Sea Clammers and in Smith v. Robinson, you had\nstatutes that forestalled an individual's access to court\nvia an administrative regime and then expressly limited\nthe judicial remedies that would be available once they\ngot there by requiring, for example, only injunctive\nrelief.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, the other word is\ninconsistent, and is it -- sorry. Were you -- is it\ninconsistent if Congress didn't want it? And if that's\ninsufficient to be inconsistent, then here, as I look at\nthe statute, to get out my thinking, I think that it\nsounds like an administrative law statute. If I saw the\nmaintenance and cure words, I'd think it was an admiralty\nstatute.\nMR. WAXMAN: Okay. I --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I see an administrative law\nstatute. It sounds like that's the system they're\nimposing and therefore a system that is not consistent\nwith the administrative law system fails and 1983 seems to\nfail.\nMR. WAXMAN: Okay. Now I have two points. I --\nI don't want to forget these. I have to deal with the --\nthe question of whether a 30-day requirement is\ninconsistent and whether damages would be inconsistent\nwith what -- with what my colleagues posit as an APA-like\nadministrative review model.\nA 30-day requirement is simply a reflection of\nCongress' -- Congress confirming expressly that somebody\nwho -- who is aggrieved under the rights provided to him\nunder 332(c)(7) and wants any judicial remedy, whether\nit's from 1983 or otherwise, has to go to court promptly.\nIt's precisely what 1983, this Court said in Patsy and\nFelder, guarantees and requires. It does not require --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But it also requires\nexpeditiousness on the part of the court.\nMR. WAXMAN: It requires that the court proceed\nexpeditiously and courts can proceed expeditiously where\ndamages are sought or are not sought.\nOne of the interesting things about damages --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But do you -- do you agree with\nthis much, that if -- if damages, in fact, are going to be\nallowed, what is going to count as expeditious is going to\nbe a lot slower than what is going to count as expeditious\nif damages are not allowed.\nMR. WAXMAN: I don't think that's true. In\nfact, I think this case is a pretty good example. The\ncourt separated it -- I mean, acting under a requirement\nof expedition at the request of the city. This -- the\ncourt didn't even begin to address this case until 18\nmonths after it had been filed. But what it said was --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. And -- and that --\nMR. WAXMAN: -- the first issue --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- that was a violation of the\nstatute, wasn't it?\nMR. WAXMAN: Well, it first issued an order\nsaying, okay, I've construed the statute and I've\ndetermined that the statute is violated. Now we will have\na separate proceeding. Then the city will conduct itself\naccordingly. Now we'll have a separate proceeding in\norder to determine whether damages or attorney's fees are\navailable. And that is available in any of these cases.\nWhat --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So they turned the damage issue\nbasically just into a separate remedial hearing at the end\nof the case.\nMR. WAXMAN: It could or could not be, and there\nmay -- may be many cases when damages aren't appropriate\nbut --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought that was just to\ndecide in -- in the -- in the court of first instance --\nthat tail end was not to decide whether in this specific\ncase damages or attorney's fees were due. But the\ndistrict court was deciding a question of law, that is,\nwhether in this kind of review proceeding anyone could\nhave damages, anyone could have attorney's fees.\nMR. WAXMAN: What he said, Justice Ginsburg, was\nwe'll deal with what other remedies, if any, are available\nand to what extent in a separate proceeding. As it turns\nout, he concluded in an --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But was not making a rule for\nthis case only. He was making a ruling of law.\nMR. WAXMAN: For sure. He said that I don't\nthink you're entitled to this because I think that the\nstatute doesn't allow it. And therefore, he didn't get to\nthis question.\nBut the point about damages -- I think there are\ntwo points that are very important that not be obscured.\nFirst of all, the Government -- the fact that\nthe Government and the petitioner can't agree on whether\nthe statute itself provides damages relief under the\nprinciple of Bell v. Hood and Franklin v. Gwinnett County\ncertainly shows that Congress did not speak expressly on\nthis subject.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: They -- they don't necessarily\ndisagree. The Government just says the -- the issue\ndoesn't have to be reached in this case.\nMR. WAXMAN: Well, I think -- I think that --\nwhat the Government says in its papers is they may well be\navailable and what Mr. Feldman -- I don't want to misquote\nhim, but he said that under Franklin -- he agreed, I\nthink, with what Judge Posner wrote for the Seventh\nCircuit, which is where no remedies -- where no specific\nremedies are specified -- and that's the case here -- you\napply a rule of judicial implication, announced in Bell v.\nHood and applied to an implied right of action in\nFranklin, to apply that all appropriate relief is\navailable. And damages are the paradigm.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Waxman.\nMR. WAXMAN: And the irony here --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Waxman, how do you -- how\ndo you get a reading of the 30-day limitation, which is\napplicable to the cause of action under the Communications\nAct, sucked into the cause of action under section 1983?\nI mean, if the suit is under 1983, it's under 1983.\nThere's no 30-day limit there.\nMR. WAXMAN: I have -- I have two different ways\nto get to that.\nFirst of all, section 1983, by its terms,\nprovides redress in any appropriate cause of action. It\nalso supplies a cause of action where no other cause of\naction is available, but by its express terms, it doesn't\nexclusively limit its remedies to causes of action that\nare brought under 1983.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No, it doesn't.\nMR. WAXMAN: But more broadly --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It doesn't require you to --\nto establish a cause of action under some other statute\neither.\nMR. WAXMAN: That's right. It provides a --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It does not at all. It's --\nit's self-contained. And do you know any case where we\nhave read into, or indeed, it's even been urged upon us to\nread into, section 1983 limitations that somehow come from\nthe statute that was violated and which forms the basis\nfor the 1983 action?\nMR. WAXMAN: Well, I don't, but I do know that\nthis Court -- first of all, Congress has now enacted\nsection 1658 which provides a -- a 4-year Federal default\nstatute of limitations, where -- where a statute like 1983\ndoesn't provide it, but includes an -- an introduction\nthat says, except where otherwise provided by Federal law.\nAnd there's certainly nothing in that language that says\nwhen you're looking at whether a statute of limitations is\notherwise provided by Federal law, you look to the very\nstatute that creates the substantive right that 1983 is\nenforcing.\nAnd even before that, when your -- your decision\nin Wilson v. Garcia made the point that when you try to\nfigure out what statute of limitations applies to a\nfreestanding 1983 action, there are -- there is a\ntripartite rule of construction that section 1988 requires\nyou to engage in. And the first part is to see whether\nthere is any, quote, suitable Federal statute of\nlimitations.\nNow, in constitutional cases, like the one that\nwas at issue in Wilson v. Garcia or under the Social\nSecurity Act, which is what was addressed in Maine v.\nThiboutot, there were no express causes of action, much\nless any express statute of limitations. And so this\nCourt said you then go to the second rule, which is what's\nthe most appropriate State limitations, as 1988 requires.\nBut the anomaly of the argument here is we have\na background principle that 1983 is available and there is\na heavy presumption that it will be available unless it is\nexplicitly incompatible or inconsistent with --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, that's --\nMR. WAXMAN: -- and --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- that's why I'm approaching\nit differently, and I -- I want to get your view on it.\nI'm taking the word inconsistent and I'm using that as a\nguide back into the purpose of the statute. And once I do\nthat, I find Congress here anxious, I think, to engage in\nwhat I'd call cooperative federalism. They could have run\nthe whole show, but they said we don't want the FCC. We\nwant each city and town to do what they want, subject to a\nfew minimal procedural requirements.\nIf that's right, that means all these damages\nquestions are open. All kinds of things are open, but --\nand we'll decide them in a variety of ways, maybe\ndeferring to the State, but one thing is true: 1983\ndoesn't apply because that is a different set of remedies.\nMR. WAXMAN: Justice Breyer, this is not the APA\nmodel. This is not a model of administrative review for a\nnumber of reasons.\nNumber one, it is a background -- there -- there\n-- it is established, for purposes of this case, that this\nstatute creates individual Federal rights and those rights\nwere violated. And the background rule is uniformly --\nand this Court has -- has -- in Owens v. City of\nIndianapolis and many other cases has reinforced the\nprinciple that damages are available and 1983 is available\nwhere Federal rights are violated by municipalities,\nwhether it's under the Takings Clause or the Due Process\nClause or the Equal Protection Clause or in statutory\ncases. What is more --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Waxman -- Mr. Waxman, one\nof these provisions gives you an option to go to the FCC,\nthe one having to do with emissions. Now, if you sought\nreview from the local decision to the FCC, you petition\nfor FCC relief, would the FCC have authority to give you\nattorney's fees?\nMR. WAXMAN: The FCC has said that it does not\nif you do that. In -- in 2000, when the FCC last\nreported, one person had chosen to go that route rather\nthan go to Federal court. It --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, isn't that an\nincongruity that Congress would say you have your choice?\nComplainant, you can go to the Federal agency, the FCC, or\nyou can go to court.\nMR. WAXMAN: You can't go to the -- excuse me.\nI didn't --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So if -- if you have that\nchoice, when you're dealing with the radio emissions, to\ngo the -- why would any litigant ever do that? Why would\nany attorney ever do that if you don't get fees at the FCC\nand you do get fees in court? Wouldn't the presumption be\nthat it would work the same way whether you go to the\nagency, Federal agency, or Federal or State court, that\nyou're in the same situation as respect to fees?\nMR. WAXMAN: The -- the FCC alternative for a\ndeclaration by the FCC applies to only one of the five\nrights that are provided here, and even if it applied to\nall of them, I don't think you could possibly infer\nthat --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, let's take the one,\nthat -- that one. Are you saying no attorney's fees there\nbecause you couldn't get them at the FCC, therefore you\nshouldn't get them in court?\nMR. WAXMAN: Absolutely not. If -- if there\nwere an instance in which a local zoning official said,\nyou know, I know I'm not supposed to take radio\nfrequencies emissions into account, but I'm going to, it's\ndenied, I would have the right either to go to the FCC and\nsay, tell them no, or to file an action under 332 and/or\n1983 and say that violates my rights. And actually your\nexample --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But isn't --\nMR. WAXMAN: If I just may finish.\nYour example, I think -- the example of this\nparticular provision points out that what -- the balance\nof what I was going to explain to Justice Breyer, which is\nthat another reason why this isn't the APA model is that\nthis statute includes in little (i) and little (ii)\nsubstantive provisions, not just procedural provisions.\nYou can't discriminate, to give Justice O'Connor's first\nexample, among providers. The -- that was a complaint in\nthis case. There is de novo review, it is clear, on those\nclaims. It's not administrative APA review in any\nrespect. And in fact, the district judge in this very\ncase, Judge Wilson, says it looks like, in fact, you were\ndiscriminated against, but I don't need to reach that\nbecause it's clear that there was no substantial evidence.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: They -- they didn't provide for\nthe normal administrative review because they were quite\naware that under the State zoning systems, there would\nalways be State administrative review before the issue\neven comes up.\nMR. WAXMAN: And this --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And so what this provides is\nwhat kind of judicial review there will be after the\nanticipated administrative review before the zoning board\nand whatever appeal from the zoning board exists.\nMR. WAXMAN: I -- I have to respectfully\ndisagree. This Court, in -- in Williamson County and\nDarby and many other cases, has distinguished carefully\nbetween final -- final action and exhaustion of\nadministrative review or judicial review. And all this\nstatute requires is that if you are aggrieved by an action\nor inaction of a State or local government or an\ninstrumentality thereof --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Final. Final action or failure\nto act is what --\nMR. WAXMAN: That's correct.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Final action or failure to.\nMR. WAXMAN: And final action, this Court has\nexplained, does not import into it exhaustion of either a\nState administrative or judicial remedies. What it means\nis that once you have been injured, it's a -- it's a\nripeness requirement that's familiar under --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You haven't been injured until\nyou've exhausted your --\nMR. WAXMAN: That is --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You -- you really think that\nwhen there is a State provision available for review of\nthe zoning board, you can commence an action under 1983\nwithout even going through the administrative appeals?\nMR. WAXMAN: I am entirely certain of that, and\nin fact, the -- the local ordinance -- I mean, the\nquestion of what is final agency action is surely a\nFederal question, but --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: This is really respecting the\nStates, which is what the -- the purpose of this -- of\nthis whole provision was.\nMR. WAXMAN: Justice Scalia, when Congress\naddressed this problem in 1996, as the Government points\nout in the very first page of its brief and as the\nlegislative history reflects, it was confronting a\nsituation in which intransigent, entrenched zoning\nauthorities were acting arbitrarily to frustrate the\ncreation of a national wireless network. And it was so\nconcerned about this that the House actually passed a\nprovision that removed this paradigmatic local authority\nto the FCC. The FCC was --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Which would be more\nburdensome? That enactment or subjecting municipalities\nnationwide to damages? Which would be more intrusive and\nburdensome on federalism --\nMR. WAXMAN: I think --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- and the abilities of local\ngovernments to function?\nMR. WAXMAN: Oh, I think the former, for sure.\nI mean, the notion that zoning decisions, siting decisions\nwould be removed entirely from localities is unbelievably\nintrusive.\nAnd what happened in the conference committee\nwas a compromise was reached whereby Congress' objective\nwas going to be achieved by creating -- by leaving it, in\nthe first instance, Justice Kennedy, to local --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I'm -- I'm not so sure\nbecause you're arguing that even the smallest municipality\ncan be liable for hundreds of thousands of dollars of\nattorney's fees.\nMR. WAXMAN: Well --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And I --\nMR. WAXMAN: -- let me just say this, with\nrespect to the --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Plus other -- plus other\ndamages.\nMR. WAXMAN: I think this case, Justice Kennedy\n-- I have three things to say about this.\nJust this case is every bit as -- as paradigmatic\nas the parade of horribles that they suggest. And here's\nmy proof. It has been since 1997 that courts have been\nruling that 1983 and damages are available under this\nstatute. There is no evidence in any of the briefs on the\nother side or any of their amici that there has either\nbeen a flood of litigation or inappropriately large\nawards.\nAnd if that happened, Congress would do -- would\nbe attentive to it in the way that Justice Ginsburg\npointed out when the local cable authorities came to --\ncame to the very same committees 4 years before and said,\nwe're being hit -- there's an express right of action in\n555 of the -- the Communications Act. We're being hit\nwith very large 1983 awards. Please do something about\nit. And the very same committees 4 years before enacted a\nprovision that said you may get only injunctive and\ndeclaratory relief, thereby creating an incompatibility\nwith 1983, as the legislative history expressly provides.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, cable -- cable media\ncompanies may -- may have Congress' ear more readily than\n-- than -- you know, than the municipality of whatever\nthis is or any --\nMR. WAXMAN: State and -- than State and local\ngovernments? I hope not. But here's -- here's the\nadditional --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But I -- I wouldn't put a lot\nof money on it.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. WAXMAN: The point is that Congress --\nJustice Kennedy, the point is not that Congress was being\ninattentive to State and local budgets. What it wanted to\ndo what was this -- the point this Court the addressed in\n-- in Stakura and -- and Owens v. City of Indianapolis,\nwhich is to enforce a Federal statute through privately\nenforceable Federal rights, which would include a damages\nremedy that both provides a deterrent against conduct that\nhad provided entrenched resistance to a Federal program\nand provide compensation where reasonable and appropriate.\nNow, this Court has made clear, with respect to\ndamages, in -- in Carey v. Piphus and other cases, that\nthere may be very many cases in which there's a violation\nof a procedural right but only nominal damages are\navailable. And in Buckhannon --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But with respect to --\nMR. WAXMAN: If I may just finish this sentence.\nAnd in Buckhannon and Farrar v. Hobby, this Court has --\nhas recognized that in order to get attorney's fees, you\nhave to have substantially prevailed and a court, under\n1988(b), may award attorney's fees in its -- may award --\nin its discretion insofar as they are reasonable. And --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. -- Mr. Waxman.\nMR. WAXMAN: Yes, Justice Ginsburg.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: There is in this legislative\nrecord a concern expressed by a Senator from California\nwhen there was a proposal on the table to make the FCC the\nFederal review forum. And that was rejected, if I\nunderstand correctly, because there was a concern that\nmunicipalities would have to travel all the way to\nWashington, D.C. to defend in the FCC's forum. And\nCongress did not want to saddle municipalities with the\ncost of transporting their representative to D.C. Well,\nthat cost would pale compared to attorney's fees that\nwould be awarded.\nMR. WAXMAN: First of all, Justice Ginsburg, I\n-- the reference to those two Senators -- what those two\nSenators were talking about is not, as my colleague's\nbrief suggests, this provision. They were talking about\nanother provision of the Telecom Act. I think it was\nsection 253, but I may be wrong.\nBut even if that's the case, the fact of the\nmatter is that whether it was going to cost them -- I\nagree. It would cost -- look, a regime in -- which left\nall of these siting decisions to the FCC is breathtaking,\nand it certainly would impose lots of costs not only on\nlocal municipalities to have to come to Washington to\njustify these decisions, but certainly on the FCC, which\nwould have to send an army out to example -- I mean, it\nwould sort of like be the -- the television commercial,\nyou know, where the guy is walking around saying, you\nknow, can you hear me now, can you hear me now? The fact\nis it made great sense to continue to leave the initial\ndecisions with local authorities.\nBut Congress had -- was frustrated, expressly\nfrustrated with the fact that the prior regime, in which\nthey had let local authorities do it under their normal\nroutines and applying the normal remedies, was not getting\nthe job done. That was the imperative of this statute.\nAnd in the -- in the absence of any evidence, even now 11\nyears later -- or I guess it's 10 years -- 9 years later.\nIn the absence of any evidence of a flood of litigation or\ninappropriate awards, I think given the very heavy\npresumption that this Court has recognized over and over\nand over again, that 1983 is there.\nJUSTICE BREYER: That isn't the only --\nMR. WAXMAN: 1983 is the background principle\nagainst which Congress legislates. And this statute\neither -- neither provides nor excludes any remedies, and\nall it does is confirm that when you go -- when you are\ninjured, you can go to court. And --\nJUSTICE BREYER: The other -- the other harm is\nthere any evidence of because it's -- it would also be\nharmful if local zoning boards, when faced with quite\ndifficult decisions, because the -- the antenna -- they\nbristle up and you put them in the wrong place. They're\nenvironmentally harmful. They -- there are a lot of bad\nthings, as well as good things about them. And of course,\nit would be a bad impact if we discovered that the zoning\nboards were erring too much on the side of granting\neverybody's application, as well as too much on the side\nof not granting them.\nMR. WAXMAN: To be sure.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And so I -- I don't know how --\nwhat the -- there won't be evidence. How can we get\nevidence on such a thing?\nMR. WAXMAN: The -- the -- you -- the evidence\nwill be either in the decided cases or by local municipal\ngovernments coming to Congress and saying, this is too\nheavy a thumb on the scale. But what we know is that if\nyou afford only prospective relief, which is the -- the\nancien regime that Congress was -- that Congress felt\nwasn't doing the job, it provides no deterrent, no\nincentive to accomplish what Congress said was --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But I -- I don't think we --\nMR. WAXMAN: -- a compelling national objective.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I don't think we usually think\nof -- of judicial review of agency decisions in the\nordinary course as being a deterrent.\nMR. WAXMAN: We --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: It's an opportunity to\nelaborate reasons. It's a safeguard. It's not a\ndeterrent. And you're saying it has to be a deterrent.\nAnd as Justice Breyer indicates, it -- it means that\nthere's -- there's another voice in that -- in that\nadministrative hearing room. They're terrified of\ndamages.\nMR. WAXMAN: Justice Kennedy --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And it's going to skew the\ndecisions.\nMR. WAXMAN: Justice Kennedy, it -- under their\n-- under the regulations of this municipality, which is --\nis perfectly representative, it is final agency action\nwhen the city planning commissioner says no, unless you\nchoose to appeal it to the city council.\nAnd there is -- not only is there nothing\npeculiar about applying 1983 damages awards to the\nviolation by a State and local government of an express\nFederal right, assuming you can prove not only that the\nright was violated but also that you were really damaged.\nIt's -- I'm not suggesting that -- that Congress had\ndamages in mind specifically and only to deter conduct.\nYou have said in a variety of instances -- I mentioned\nStacura in particular -- that 1983 damages do serve as a\ndeterrent to violation of Federal rights by municipal\nlocal officials.\nBut what Congress had -- Congress had to come up\nwith some way to confront this problem in which there were\nsort of local parochial --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this question, Mr.\nWaxman? I don't know if it's really a legal question\nexactly, but I have the impression that most of the\nplaintiffs in this type of litigation are well-financed,\nlarge companies rather than the typical 1983 plaintiff.\nAnd therefore, you don't need the attorney's fee incentive\nto be sure these rights are protected. Is that a correct\nimpression or is it incorrect?\nMR. WAXMAN: I -- I don't know whether it's a\ncorrect impression or not. Our brief points the Court to\nan authority that at least 9,500 of the entities that have\n-- have created antennas or tower facilities have 10 or\nfewer facilities.\nAnd one thing we know for sure is that when\nCongress enacted the Telecom Act of 1996, it specifically\nwanted to encourage small operations, start-up companies.\nIt had specific provisions in the law to give special\ntreatment to small entrepreneurs in order to foster\ndiversity and competition. But in the event that you --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I can't imagine -- I can't\nimagine, Mr. Waxman, that Congress wanted to impose\ndamages plus attorney's fees upon municipalities without\neven giving the municipalities the chance to correct their\nmistakes, which is what you're saying.\nMR. WAXMAN: Well --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You're saying the\nmunicipalities' appeal system, which is there for people\nto take advantage of, is just washed out. One mistake at\nthe lowest level and you get damages and you get\nattorney's fees. That -- that is extraordinary.\nMR. WAXMAN: Justice Scalia, the -- the -- 1983\n-- and your jurisprudence shouts this as clearly as it\ndoes any other principle -- stands for the proposition\nthat it's there unless, in the explicit language of the\nstatute that creates the right, there is a demonstrated\nincompatibility. And that's the background rule.\nThere are many instances in the Telecom Act and\nelsewhere in which Congress has said you can only get\ninjunctive relief. You may not get 1983 damages. I mean,\ngo back to Adickes v. Kress where this Court said in title\nII of the Public Accommodations Act, Congress expressly --\nexpressly precluded damages in order to avoid invocation\nof 1983.\nAnd I'm not saying that Congress had in mind my\nclient, who is an individual, a sole entrepreneur, who was\nsubject to, I think what the record shows is, prolonged\nand entrenched intransigence by this particular\nmunicipality, any more than it had Judge Posner's example\nin the Seventh Circuit where it was, you know, Verizon v.\nthe Village of Mequon.\nBut this Court has recognized, as have the lower\ncourts, that you only get damages if you prove that you\nreally have been damaged. And in an instance where\nthere's some procedural violation and a remand to correct\nit, this may very well be the instance of Carey v. Piphus,\nwhere the damages are purely nominal. The agency is given\nthe opportunity.\nIn this case, the city never said, give us the\nopportunity to go back and correct it. And Judge Wilson,\na very level-headed district judge, said there's nothing\nto go back and correct because the only thing -- the only\nreason that the city gave was it didn't like this antenna\nand tower in the first place. It -- we concede that it\nmakes no difference to anybody which frequencies are being\nbroadcast from this tower that we approved 10 years ago\nand have no right to modify. And therefore, there was a\nsubstantive violation, not just, you know, you -- you may\nhave had substantial evidence but you didn't lay it all\nout or you gave your reasons at length and orally but not\nin writing, I'll give you the opportunity to go back.\nThere's a line of cases this Court has decided\nunder the Social Security Act where there have been\nremands to correct procedural errors or small errors, and\nin those instances, Carey v. Piphus says you don't get\ndamages. And under Buckhannon and Farrar v. Hobby, you\nprobably don't get attorney's fees either.\nIf there ever is the sort of parade of horribles\nthat they protest about, even a small parade of horribles,\nCongress will be as attentive as it was in 1992 when the\ncable --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you, Mr. Waxman.\nMR. WAXMAN: Thank you.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Lamken, you have about 4\nminutes left.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY A. LAMKEN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. LAMKEN: I'd like to make only two brief\npoints.\nFirst, that the imposition of the -- of damages\nand fees under section 1983 from a decision in this Court\nfor even good faith mistakes in the implementation of the\nantenna siting rules, which are often complex and\nuncertain, would be a welcome mat for extensive and\naggressive litigation and the imposition of extensive fees\non municipalities which simply cannot afford to enforce\ntheir zoning rules, the rules that Congress expressly\nattempted to preserve in the statute itself.\nIt is -- in this case alone, for example,\nrespondent's most recent estimate of his damages and fees\n-- and this was before he retained Mr. Waxman, I might add\n-- is -- is $15 million, essentially the city's entire\nbudget for a year. And respondent claims to be a\nrelatively small operator. That sort of -- with that sort\nof liability in an uncertain area of law, very few\nmunicipalities could ever afford to stand on their rights\nto enforce local zoning even when they're relatively\ncertain that they are right.\nSection 332(c)(7) is entitled and has one of its\npurposes as the preservation of local authority. It\nshould not be construed to provide for that authority's\nevisceration.\nThe second point I wanted to hit is that when\nCongress established the mechanism for review in 332, it\nprovided a very adapted mechanism with an unusual pair of\ncharacteristics: a very short limitations period and\nmandatory expedition. This Court's decisions in Novotny\nmakes it clear that neither of those requirements can be\nsimply transferred over to section 1983. Novotny had very\nsimilar language, a 90-day limitations period. The Court\ndid not transfer that over to section 1983. Instead it\nunderstood that the general rule, the general Federal\nprinciple of law, that in the absence of an express\nlimitations period, that State law would control. Wilson\nthen confirms that rule, as an interpretation of section\n1988, that the governing Federal principle is that State\nlaw controls unless there's an express Federal cause of --\nstatute that addresses that particular cause of action.\nIf there are no further questions, we ask only\nthat the judgment of the Ninth Circuit be reversed. Thank\nyou.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you, Mr. Lamken.\n"
