ROBIN-VERGEER\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may\nit please the Court:\nRemon Lee is serving a life sentence without\npossibility of parole for first degree murder without ever\nhaving had a chance to present testimony from witnesses\nwho could have established his innocence.\nI would like to begin by discussing whether\nLee's failure to comply with two Missouri rules governing\nmotions for continuance is an adequate State law ground to\nbar consideration of Lee's Federal due process claim based\non the State trial court's denial of a brief continuance.\nIn the circumstances in which his motion for a continuance\nwas made, the answer is no.\nUnder this Court's existing precedents, Missouri\nrules 24.09 and 24.10 are not adequate to bar review of\nLee's due process claim because application of the rules\nin -- in this case was arbitrary and serves no legitimate\nState interest where Lee lacked a reasonable opportunity\nto comply with the letter of the rules under the\ncircumstances, where Lee supplied --\nQUESTION: You're -- you're just summarizing\nnow, I take it. You're going to go into more detail as to\nwhy --\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: Yes.\nQUESTION: -- the rules are arbitrary.\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: Correct. I was just\nsummarizing for the Court the circumstances that made it\nso that there was no legitimate State interest served in\nthis case.\nQUESTION: Well, at least as far as 24.10's\nelements are concerned, presumably those could have been\naddressed by counsel. I mean, the -- the different\nrequirements could have been orally presented. I would\nassume that 24.10 sets out certain information that is\ngenerally regarded by the State as -- as crucial --\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: That's --\nQUESTION: -- in making the decision.\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: That's correct, and every\npiece of information required by those rules were before\nthe trial court. The Missouri --\nQUESTION: When you say before the trial court,\nyou mean in the presentation made at that time orally by\ncounsel? Answer that yes or no, please.\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: No. Every element --\nQUESTION: Where -- where else are you saying it\ncame from?\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: The opening statement by\ndefense counsel.\nQUESTION: So, the trial judge is supposed to\nremember the opening statement by -- by defense counsel\nwhen he passes on a motion for a continuance that's made\nat the end of the trial?\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: Let me clarify a few things.\nEvery element required by the rules was -- was before --\nwas stated by counsel or by the defendants on the stand --\nQUESTION: How about -- I didn't find anything\nabout that at all. The sixth requirement was that the\naffiant knows of no other person whose evidence or\nattendance he could have procured at trial by whom he\ncould prove the same facts. Was that addressed? I -- I\ndidn't find it. Perhaps you could point me to where that\nwas addressed.\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: The discussion with the\ntrial court was -- bear in mind the discussion with the\ntrial court occurred in an emergency situation where\nwitnesses are suddenly gone and the -- and counsel is now\nbefore the trial court explaining what had happened.\nEveryone in the discussion knew who the witnesses were and\nwhy they were crucial to his defense. This was a short\ntrial --\nQUESTION: You -- you say that the trial judge\nknew it too?\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: Yes, and the trial court --\neven in the colloquy, you can see that the trial court\nknew who the witnesses were. At one --\nQUESTION: And what their purpose was? I -- I\ndidn't get that at all out of the transcript.\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: At one point during the\ndiscussion -- the only question that the trial court had\nfor counsel was were these witnesses under subpoena, and\ncounsel answered that question yes, twice.\nQUESTION: The counsel has to make a showing of\nhis own. It's not just responding to questions from the\ncourt.\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: When the -- when counsel\npulled out the subpoenas and starting reading from the\nsubpoena and he read, Gladys Edwards is supposed to come\non the last day of trial at 9 o'clock, the trial court\nresponded, is she the mother, showing that the trial court\nunderstood who the witnesses were. Bear in mind this\nwas --\nQUESTION: But what -- what the purpose was.\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: There was only one issue in\nthe case and that was whether the defendant was correctly\nidentified by the eye witnesses or was he somewhere else.\nThis was the entire affirmative defense for Mr. Lee.\nThree witnesses were his entire affirmative defense,\nand --\nQUESTION: Was that explained in the opening\nstatement? Could you elaborate on what was said in the\nopening statement?\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: Yes. In the opening\nstatement, which occurred only the day before this\nexchange took place, counsel outlined for the trial court\nand the jury the fact that Minister James Edwards, Mr.\nLee's stepfather; Gladys Edwards, his mother; and Laura\nLee, his sister had traveled from California to testify\nthat during the period of July through October 1992, Mr.\nLee had been staying with them in California and was not\nin Kansas City. And they -- and his statement provided\ncertain details that showed why they remembered when it\nwas, that he had come out for the birthday parties for\nhimself and for his niece and had stayed through the -- up\nto the Halloween party. And all of this was laid out in\nthe opening statement and made it clear that these\nwitnesses were crucial to his defense and is what his\nentire defense was based on.\nQUESTION: This -- this goes to the importance\nof those witnesses. I find it extraordinary that you\ndidn't get a neighbor or, you know, somebody other than\nhis mother, his father or stepfather, and the sister to\ncome and testify he was out there. Nobody else saw him\nthere? He -- he stayed in their home the whole time? You\nknow, if I was looking for people to -- to bring to\ntestify for an alibi -- he was there for how long? For\nthe whole holiday season?\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: July through October. The\nrecord is silent --\nQUESTION: Nobody else saw him there that he\ncould have brought in? He has to bring in his mother, his\nstepfather, and his sister?\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: I -- I can't answer that.\nThe record is silent on who saw him.\nQUESTION: Well, let me tell you -- let me tell\nyou, counsel, what -- what concerns me about your case.\nLet's -- let's assume that you can convince us that given\nthe haste -- the press of trial and the shortness of time\nthat the counsel did about all he could -- all he could\ndo. But there was a post-conviction new trial motion some\n17 days or -- or 2 weeks later, and at that point, the --\nthe counsel made no specific showing as to why the\nwitnesses -- the mystery remained. There was -- A, there\nwas no showing at all or even mentioned of the fact that a\ncourt officer might have misled them, and -- and B, we\nnever know why they left. Whether -- the counsel had 2\nweeks to -- to supplement that motion.\nI -- let me as you this as a predicate. I\nassume that the State trial judge at the new trial motion\nhad the opportunity and the right under State law to\nrevisit his ruling denying the continuance.\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: Correct.\nQUESTION: Well, there was nothing new shown by\ncounsel at that point. So, even if you -- if we concede\nthat the press of trial and the surprise that attended the\ndisappearance of the witnesses excused the counsel from\ndoing anything more, he surely is not excused from this\nskimpy showing 2 weeks later. That's what bothers me\nabout the case.\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: Okay. As for why, I was not\ntrial counsel below. I don't know why he didn't say more\nin the motion for a new trial. But I can tell you that\nthe Missouri rules governing motions for a new trial say\nthat when a -- when error is assigned at the motion for a\nnew trial stage -- and this is rule 29.11 of the Missouri\nSupreme Court rules -- that -- and a request is denied and\nthen that's made a basis for a motion for a new trial, a\nshort general statement reiterating that ground is\nappropriate in a motion for a new trial.\nAs for why he didn't say more, I can't answer\nthat.\nQUESTION: Well, but you're -- you're saying\nthat Missouri, as a matter of due process, did not afford\nadequate opportunity for this attorney to explain the\ndisappearance of his witnesses. And even if I grant you\nthat the rush of -- that the press of time was such that\nwe can excuse the performance at the -- on the day of\ntrial --\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: I have --\nQUESTION: -- 2 weeks later he had -- he had all\nthe opportunity in the world to explain this, I think.\nNow, Judge, we were in a hurry when you denied the\ncontinuance. Maybe you didn't understand him, and here's\nwhat happened. He doesn't do that. It seems to me that's\nthe end of the case from a due process standpoint.\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: I -- I disagree. I think\nthat the ruling on the motion for a continuance is\nevaluated ex ante. It's evaluated at the time that the\nmotion was denied, and at the time that the motion was\ndenied -- and the standard has been stated in Unger v.\nSarafite. Quote --\nQUESTION: But Missouri gave to the attorney the\nopportunity to revisit the entire matter at the post-\nconviction motion for a new trial, and nothing further was\nadduced.\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: The motion for a new trial\nrestated his grounds for granting a new trial, the fact\nthat the witnesses had come in -- and it did -- it did\nexplain that they -- these were the alibi witnesses from\nCalifornia -- so that was clear in the motion for a new\ntrial -- and the fact that the trial court had denied that\nmotion without giving him a short recess or without\nenforcing the subpoenas. These witnesses were under\nsubpoenas, and rule 26.03 of the Missouri rules states\nthat when a witness doesn't -- isn't there for a criminal\ntrial, he's under subpoena, he's subject to arrest.\nThere's no special procedural rule that governs\nhow that has to happen. The judge took no effort\nwhatsoever to enforce the subpoenas in this case, and\nwe're talking about just a short -- a few hours'\ncontinuance to try to figure out what happened and to get\nthem in.\nQUESTION: These were sequestered witnesses, as\nI remember it. At the time of the motion for a new trial,\ndid the lawyer point out that the bailiff, or whoever it\nwas, had told them they would be excused for the -- till\nthe next day?\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: That was not stated in the\nmotion for a new trial.\nQUESTION: It wasn't until later.\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: It was in the rule 29.15\nState post-conviction motion that that issue first came\nup.\nBut the question of why the witnesses ultimately\nleft and whether the State was responsible for that is\nreally a separate issue. That goes to -- well, that may\ngo to cause, but it also goes to whether he has a separate\ndue process claim on that basis. It's not necessary to\nfigure out why the witnesses left to evaluate whether or\nnot the trial court's denial of a brief recess to try to\nfigure out what happened to the witnesses was an arbitrary\ndenial --\nQUESTION: Well, there's where I disagree with\nyou because 2 weeks later, he didn't show anything more\nother than they were alibi witnesses. And I'll -- I'll\nassume, for purposes of this question that he knew that\nbecause of the opening argument.\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: The reason why they left\ndoesn't change the fact that the moment that the trial\ncourt ruled on the motion for a continuance, he didn't\nknow where they were, counsel didn't know where they were,\nthe prosecutor didn't know where they were. At that\nmoment, was it reasonable to deny him -- I mean, the\ndefendant only asked for 2 hours, just a few hours --\nQUESTION: Well, but what I'm saying is we don't\nneed to have at that time because we have the benefit of\nhindsight 2 weeks later, and you had nothing new.\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: There's nothing new in the\nmotion for a new trial, but no new facts need to be\nadduced in the motion for a new trial. It is appropriate\nin Missouri to bring facts that are outside of the record\nin a rule 29.15 post-conviction motion, and they were\nbrought up in the rule 29.15 post-conviction motion.\nThere's no mystery here about why the State\ntrial court judge denied the motion, and he denied it on\nthe merits. He did not deny it because the application\nwas defective. The prosecutor didn't object to the\napplication, either the request for a continuance or the\nform in which the request was made. Had the trial court\nor the prosecutor signaled some question -- and again,\nbear in mind the emergency way that this came up -- had\nsignaled some question, he could have cured it.\nAnd in a way, you have a kind of a reverse\nsandbagging where error is left embedded in the record and\nit isn't until the direct appeal 2 years later that anyone\nsuggests there was something procedurally defective about\nthe motion.\nQUESTION: Do -- do we know that if he had been\ngiven the couple of hours' continuance, which is what he\nasked for, you would have located the witnesses? Where\ndid they go? I -- I'm -- that part of the story never\ncomes out from this stuff. They -- they just disappear\nfrom the courthouse. Is there any explanation of what\nhappened to them?\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: Well, the affidavits of the\nwitnesses don't state where they went when they left. In\nthe rule 29.15 post-conviction motion, it states that they\nwent to a relative's house. The defendant represented to\nthe trial court at the time of the colloquy that he knew\nthey were still in town because there was a religious\nevent, and counsel provided the actual address of the\nrelative's house, at which were believed to be staying,\nand told the trial court judge that they had no telephone\nthere, which is why the girlfriend had gone out looking\nfor them.\nQUESTION: Where did they go? I mean, had they\ngone to a movie? I mean, if they were not back at the\nuncle's house, it wouldn't have made any difference unless\nit was a very short movie. I mean, the couple of hours'\ncontinuance that he asked for -- we have no reason to\nbelieve it would have been -- it would have been enough,\nand that's all he asked for. These witnesses just\ndisappeared into thin air. We still don't know where they\nwent.\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: The --\nQUESTION: Why do you say that, you know, if he\nhad only gotten these couple of hours, everything would\nhave been okay?\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: The record doesn't establish\nfor sure where it is that they went at the time they left\nor for a fact that they could have been brought in.\nAgain, I -- I don't think that that's necessary\nto the ruling because it's evaluated at the time of the\ntrial court's denial. But if the Court disagrees, it\ncould remand this for an evidentiary hearing to engage in\nmore fact-finding about what the witnesses did.\nThe lower courts never got that far.\nQUESTION: I think -- I think that's your\nburden. I think you have to show that there was an error\nthat -- that harmed your client, and -- and if the refusal\nto -- to give a couple of hours' continuance -- if there's\nno reason to believe that -- that it caused any harm,\nwhat's the difference?\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: There is nothing in the\nrecord that contradicts the representations made by\ncounsel and the defendant to the State trial court that\nthey were staying at a relative's house and that they were\nstill in town, and the State has never offered --\nQUESTION: There's nothing in those facts that\nsuggests you could find them in 2 hours.\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: Well, counsel's actual\nrequest for a continuance was -- was until the following\nmorning. And if nothing else, even if counsel couldn't\nhave found them, the State has an obligation --\nQUESTION: I'm quoting -- I'm quoting from your\nbrief. Lee asked his counsel to request a couple of\nhours' continuance to try to locate them.\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: Correct, and then it's --\nand then --\nQUESTION: Lee told the court that he knew the\nwitnesses were still in town, blah, blah, blah, blah,\nblah.\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: But then -- but ultimately\ncounsel asked for an overnight continuance. And that's\nwhen the whole exchange with the judge takes place where\nthe judge says, oh, Friday I'm going to be with my\ndaughter in the hospital. Then the lawyer says, well,\nwhat about Monday, and the trial judge's response is, I\nhave another trial scheduled. So, that's where that whole\nexchange takes place.\nQUESTION: So, you -- counsel did ask for a\ncontinuance until the following morning.\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: Correct. Correct.\nAnd the sheriff's office could have gone out.\nCounsel also asked for arrest warrants -- he called them\ncapiases -- arrest warrants to go out to find the\nwitnesses, if necessary, if he couldn't have located them.\nAnd that's -- that's the least that the Due Process Clause\nand the Compulsory Process Clause would require, would be\nsome effort to try -- to try to bring in the witnesses --\nQUESTION: But it's -- it's odd in a way, and\nperhaps this doesn't -- that, you know, you would have to\nget a capias and arrest your -- your father-in-law and\nyour mother and your sister.\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: You know, I think that is a\nbackup suggestion by counsel to cover all bases. They\nwere under subpoena. The defendant has a right to have\nwitnesses under subpoena there. They had mysteriously\ndisappeared. He had no idea why they left or where they\nhad gone. And he was covering all of his bases by asking\nthe trial court for arrest warrants, if necessary. It may\nnever have come to that because the girlfriend wasn't even\ngiven enough time to get to the relative's house to see if\nthey were there.\nAnd just returning also to the circumstances in\nwhich this exchange took place, the trial court had\ncreated a real sense of rush and urgency in this trial.\nI've quoted several instances in the opening brief. It's\nfootnote 9 where the State trial court had indicated to\ncounsel that he wanted to move this case along. Just\nbefore the lunch recess, in fact, he said, I want this\ncourtroom cleared by 2:00 p.m. And that's trial\ntranscript page 570. I want this courtroom cleared by\n2:00 p.m.\nQUESTION: Counsel, please -- please don't ask\nus to write an opinion where we tell judges it's wrong to\ntell counsel to hurry along.\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: No.\n(Laughter.)\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: No. And I'm not saying that\nthe -- the trial court doesn't have broad discretion in\nhow to manage its docket and everything else.\nBut when counsel was before the judge and is\nexplaining the situation that has occurred, the\natmospherics that had arisen where the trial court judge\nis pressuring them to move along factor into how the\ncolloquy went, especially given that this is an unexpected\nsituation.\nIt's not that different from what happened in\nOsborne v. Ohio, although I think that case is less\ncompelling than ours because there was no emergency\nsituation. But in Osborne v. Ohio, Ohio had a rule\nrequiring that jury -- that objections to jury\ninstructions be made right before they're delivered.\nCounsel didn't object to the lack of an instruction on\nlewdness, but this Court said that the pretrial motion to\ndismiss the indictment on First Amendment grounds was\nsufficient and --\nQUESTION: Well, the rules for reviewing that\nsort of thing in this Court have changed a good deal from\nthe time of Osborne against Ohio I think.\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: Well, the basic principles\nregarding when a State law ground is adequate haven't\nchanged much. This Court takes a functional approach to\nlooking both to whether or not a litigant has a reasonable\nopportunity to preserve his claim and also to whether\nanything would be gained whether all of the purposes\nserved by the rules have been fulfilled, such that there's\nsome adequate State interest in enforcing a procedural\ndefault.\nThe purpose of these rules is to permit the\ntrial court to pass on the merits of a motion for a\ncontinuance. The trial court denied this motion on the\nmerits, and we quarrel with the basis for the trial\ncourt's denial. We think it was as arbitrary as arbitrary\ncan be. But there's no mystery here was to why the trial\ncourt ultimately denied that request and it wasn't because\nof any procedural defect in that motion.\nQUESTION: But the Missouri Court of Appeals\nupheld the denial on the basis that it hadn't conformed to\nrules what? 09 and 10?\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: Correct. And -- and there's\n-- there's something anomalous about an appellate court\ncoming in to enforce a procedural rule, in circumstances\nwhere there's an emergency situation, such that neither\nthe trial court, the prosecutor, or the defendant believed\nthat there was anything more that needed to be done.\nQUESTION: Well, I -- I think it's fair to say\n-- or maybe it isn't. Maybe you can argue with this --\nthat what the appellate court was saying that at least\nunder 24.10, there was an insufficient showing, and that's\nexactly what the trial judge found. The trial judge\ndidn't cite 24.10. He doesn't say I'm ruling against you\nbecause you're inadequate of showing under 24.10. But\nit's clearly implicit in his ruling.\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: The only thing that could\npossibly be missing in the showing that was made during\nthe exchange on the continuance was a failure to repeat\nthe full opening statement regarding what the witnesses\nwould have testified to.\nQUESTION: No. I think it was assurance that\nthe witnesses would be provided within -- within the time\nframe that -- that they asked for. I didn't see where\nthat -- that assurance was, and that's what -- what .10\nrequires, and that's what I think the trial judge didn't\n-- didn't have, and that's the reason he said, forget\nabout it.\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: What rule 24 --\nQUESTION: One of the reasons.\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: -- rule 24.10(b) requires\nthe name and address --\nQUESTION: Where are you reading from?\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: I'm reading from page 3a of\nthe -- the appendix to the opening brief.\nIt requires the name and residence of such\nwitness, if known -- that was given -- and also facts\nshowing reasonable grounds for belief that the attendance\nor testimony of such witness will be procured within a\nreasonable time. The showing that was made to the trial\ncourt during the discussion was both that they were still\nin Kansas City, Missouri. They hadn't left for\nCalifornia, and that they had reason to believe they were\nstill there because they had a religious event to attend.\nIf he had written out of amotion, he couldn't\npossibly have said more. That is a sufficient showing\nunder that ground.\nQUESTION: And they had come voluntarily.\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: And --\nQUESTION: They had not come by subpoena. They\nweren't subpoenaed until they got to Missouri. They came\nthere voluntarily?\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: That's correct. They were\nsubpoenaed in counsel's office when he was interviewing\nthem.\nQUESTION: They also skipped voluntarily just\nbefore they were supposed to be put on the stand under\noath.\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: But we don't --\nQUESTION: Doesn't one factor that into account\nas to whether these witnesses who suddenly vanish into\nthin air are likely to be found?\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: No, because there was no\nfactual basis at that moment before the State trial court\njudge to have any idea whether it was a medical emergency,\na misunderstanding, they had gone to lunch and hadn't come\nback on time. There was no information before the State\ntrial court at that moment to form any assumption about\nwhy they left.\nQUESTION: They were there under subpoena. They\nknew that they were going to be testifying in an hour, and\nthey left without apparently telling the person who had\nsubpoenaed them, their -- their son's counsel, or anybody\nelse. I mean, are those circumstances which would lead\none to believe that it's going to be a cinch to find these\npeople and bring them back within a reasonable time?\nQUESTION: But you also have to factor in the\nfact they were sequestered witnesses not in contact with\nany of these people you're discussing.\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: Correct. They were in a\nseparate witness room, and during the time that they\nsupposedly left, there were trial proceedings that were\ngoing on. There was -- they were in trial with witnesses\nat the point that they -- that the witnesses left. So,\nthere wouldn't have been contact.\nQUESTION: Did their sequestering prevent their\nleaving a message with the -- with the clerk of the court\nor a marshal or someone saying, tell my son we're going\nbecause we had a medical emergency or, you know -- or\nbecause, as the -- as the later story comes out, some\nmarshal told us to leave?\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: Well, if you credit the\nlater story --\nQUESTION: I find that so implausible that they\nshould just walk out, not leave any word for -- for their\nson for whom they were about to testify. I -- and I don't\nthink, if I were a trial judge, I would have thought these\nwitnesses are about to be found within -- within a\nreasonable time.\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: You have witnesses who\napparently are unsophisticated. They're not lawyers.\nThey're not schooled in the law, and if you credit their\nstory that someone told them their testimony wasn't needed\nthat day and they could leave --\nQUESTION: Wasn't there a thing too that he's a\nminister, the father, and he was scheduled to give a\nsermon that night?\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: Correct. He had -- he was a\nminister and he had a religious event in Kansas City that\nday and the next, which was the reason that was given for\nbelieving that they were still in town. No one made any\neffort to track these witnesses down or to enforce the\nsubpoena.\nQUESTION: The defendant was in custody, was he\nnot, during --\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: Correct?\nQUESTION: So, they didn't have actual contact\nwith him. They couldn't have gone in and said, hey, we're\ngoing to lunch.\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: Correct, correct.\nQUESTION: There is a --\nQUESTION: But they could have told somebody to\ntell him, couldn't they? And -- and there was no reason\nto believe at that time -- this story came up a lot later\nafter the -- much later than 2 weeks that -- that in fact\nit had been some court personnel who told them that they\nwere no longer needed. As far as the trial court knew --\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: It actually makes the trial\ncourt's decision that much more arbitrary because at the\nmoment that the trial court is faced with this question,\nyou have witnesses who traveled voluntary from California,\nwho are under subpoena, who actually appeared in the\ncourthouse, were sitting in a witness room, and had\nsuddenly disappeared, and no one knew why.\nQUESTION: Why did it take 17 months to bring\nout the -- the information that a court official told\nthese people their testimony wouldn't be needed? Was it\nnot needed at all or not needed till tomorrow? That's\nunclear.\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: Well, with respect to your\nquestion regarding the delay, I think that's just a\nfunction of how the Missouri post-conviction process\nunfolded. He -- you know, he filed a -- a motion for\npost-conviction relief later in '94. Counsel was then\nappointed. Counsel filed an amended petition, and so you\nhad the passage of time.\nQUESTION: Did he get in touch with these people\nbefore -- before 2 weeks -- I mean, before the motion for\nreconsideration of -- of the denial of -- of continuance\ncame up?\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: I don't know whether he got\nin touch with them or not.\nQUESTION: Well, that's extraordinary. I mean,\nif they were so easy to find, one -- one would have\nthought that he would have contacted them within the 2\nweeks and they would have told him within those 2 weeks\nthat a court personnel had told us to leave.\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: The record --\nQUESTION: But he doesn't mention that --\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: The record --\nQUESTION: -- 2 weeks later.\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: The record is silent on\nthat. I -- I can't answer that.\nQUESTION: I know it is.\nQUESTION: Was the motion for a new trial filed\nby the same lawyer who represented him during the trial?\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: Yes, it was and in fact, he\nwas relieved during the sentencing hearing that took\nplace.\nQUESTION: I know. He wanted to get out of\nthere because he wasn't going to get paid even for the\nnotice of appeal. It seemed to me he was anxious.\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: Correct.\nQUESTION: And once he had gotten fee for what\nhad been done, he sort of lost interest in the case.\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: That is an impression that\nthe record gives.\nQUESTION: So, you -- you can't say that he --\nhe got in touch with these witnesses who would have been\nso easy to find within a day. You can't even say that he\ngot in touch with them 2 weeks.\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: I don't know. I don't know.\nGetting back -- just to return to the second --\nto this Court's cases because I think I was beginning to\nget into Osborne. I think that Osborne supports our\nposition here because the Court took a functional approach\nin Osborne to whether or not there was any -- anything\nthat would be gained by forcing counsel to repeat\ninformation that was already before the judge, and the\nCourt said, no, there was no -- there was no default.\nOther cases in which this Court has found that\nprocedural rules were applied with the phrase being\npointless severity or whether there were arid rituals of\nmeaningless form where technical niceties were not\nobserved, but nonetheless counsel could substantially\ncomply with the showings required by the rules, cases like\nDouglas v. Alabama where you didn't repeat a futile\nobjection, cases like Staub v. City of Baxley where\ncounsel challenged on First Amendment grounds an entire\nordinance and didn't signal out particular -- particular\nprovisions to -- to attack because it was clear what the\n-- what the lawyer was challenging. Wright v. Georgia and\nNAACP v. Alabama ex rel. Flowers where the claims weren't\ngrouped exactly right in the -- in the State court appeal,\nbut this Court, nonetheless, found that no purpose would\nbe served by finding a default in those cases. All of\nthose suggest -- and -- and also the fact, of course, that\nthe defendant did not have a reasonable opportunity to\ncomply with the letter of the rules, but nonetheless\nsubstantially complied with the rules. All of those\nsuggest there should be no default, and in the\nalternative, even if there was one, that there should be a\nfinding of cause and prejudice.\nAnd with the Court's permission, if there are\nany more questions, I'd like to reserve the remainder of\nmy time.\nQUESTION: Very well, Ms. Vergeer.\nMr. Wilson, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL C. WILSON\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. WILSON: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nJustice Kennedy -- Kennedy, you are quite right\nto be disturbed by counsel's failure to provide the court\nany more information or better showing under -- under rule\n24.10 in the motion for a new trial that was filed 2 weeks\nafter the events that the Court has been discussing than\nhe did.\nBut what should trouble this Court much, much\nmore than that is that 2 months following the last day of\npetitioner's trial, his new trial motion was heard, and\nthe trial court asked counsel whether he had anything else\nthat he would like to submit in consideration of the\nmotion for a new trial, and counsel replied no.\nQUESTION: Why -- why do you think that might\nhave been? I mean, why -- why do you think -- I mean, I\nwas wondering why it wasn't ineffective assistance of\ncounsel not to put the thing in writing and not to comply\nwith 10.\nMR. WILSON: First of all, for -- for counsel to\nhave represented the facts that 24.10 requires, counsel\nwould have had to believe that they were true. And one of\nthe principal purposes --\nQUESTION: He didn't say all that in the opening\nstatement, did he?\nMR. WILSON: Excuse me? I'm --\nQUESTION: I mean, I wonder why is there no\nineffective counsel claim. Why didn't the Federal court\nin this case say, well, look, you're the lawyer in the\nState court at the trial, didn't comply with rules 9 and\n10? My goodness, that was in effective assistance. Why\ndidn't the habeas court say that here?\nMR. WILSON: The habeas court addressed the\nquestion of whether there was such --\nQUESTION: Why didn't they say what I just said?\nMR. WILSON: And because they -- they said that\nclaim was never raised to --\nQUESTION: Now -- now, that's exactly right.\nNow I want to know why do you think that -- that\nthat claim wasn't raised at that hearing, namely, the\nafter-the-trial hearing, the post-conviction?\nMR. WILSON: First, how trial counsel conducts\ntrial motions and post-trial motions is an area in which\nhe -- there is a broad discretion for the trial counsel.\nQUESTION: Of course, and what I'm really\ndriving at is, isn't the reason that they didn't raise\nrule 9 and rule 10 as showing ineffective assistance at\nthat post-trial business is because nobody dreamt that the\ncourts in that State of Missouri would apply rule 9 and\nrule 10? Because up to that point, nobody had even\nmentioned them. They didn't get mentioned until the\nappellate court, after this series of events, on its own\nraises rule 9 and rule 10.\nMR. WILSON: Justice Breyer, that's correct.\nQUESTION: That's not --\nMR. WILSON: That is not correct.\nFirst, these are published rules of court that\nwere in the book long before petitioner's trial, and the\ncases applying these rules, in fact, comparable to these\nand in others, are -- it's an unbroken string of\nprecedent. So, counsel was either aware of those or was\ncertainly deemed to be aware of those.\nQUESTION: Well, at least --\nMR. WILSON: And second --\nQUESTION: -- we know that the -- the trial\njudge did not deny the continuance on the basis of a\nfailure to comply with those rules, did he?\nMR. WILSON: He didn't say because I find\nthat --\nQUESTION: There's nothing in the record to\nindicate that the trial judge said, well, I can't grant\nthat. You didn't file it in writing. You didn't supply\nthis information. That's not in the record, is it?\nMR. WILSON: No, Your Honor. He did not cite\nthat.\nQUESTION: The trial judge denied it because he\nwanted to go to the hospital with his daughter on one day\nand he had another trial in another case starting the day\nafter.\nMR. WILSON: I don't believe that's correct.\nQUESTION: Isn't that right?\nMR. WILSON: I don't believe that's correct,\nJustice O'Connor. I don't believe that a fair reading of\nthe record indicates that that is why he denied the\nmotion.\nQUESTION: What -- what does it indicate? I\nmean, I --I read it the same way Justice O'Connor did, and\nI -- I don't -- what is your reason for --\nMR. WILSON: I -- I think the record clearly\nshows that the reason he denied the continuance is\nbecause, as Justice Scalia suggested, he determined, on\nthe circumstances that had been presented to him, that\nthese witnesses abandoned the defense.\nQUESTION: Then why did he get into his\ndaughter's hospitalization and his Monday schedule?\nMR. WILSON: The -- the continuance that was\nrequested was till the following morning, and it was in\nthat context -- and -- and it is a single sentence\nutterance there, that -- that he noted that he was not\ngoing to be in the courthouse --\nQUESTION: Well, why if he -- if he was denying\nthe motion on the ground that there had not been the\nspecifications that rule 10 required, why get into his\ndaughter's medical condition?\nMR. WILSON: The trial judge could have been\nresponding to the idea that even though you've not made a\nsufficient showing, I'm not going to cut a break for this\nbecause --\nQUESTION: Yes, I assume -- I assume there are a\nnumber of factors that go into the judge's decision. One\nis that -- the -- the court's own schedule. The other is\nthe reason these people have gone. He says it looks like\nyour -- you folks -- I think he said you folks have been\nabandoned by these witnesses. And so, he gives a number\nof reasons, all of which are exactly what he has to do\nunder 24.10 even though he doesn't cite 24.10.\nMR. WILSON: He found that an insufficient\nshowing had been made, and there are other factors that he\nwould have been considering.\nFirst, counsel had committed to this trial\nschedule.\nSecond, defense counsel had announced himself\nready to proceed and had put on part of his case.\nThird --\nQUESTION: The witnesses were there, we're told.\nThey -- they, in fact, were there and subpoenas had\nissued. They were there. And it is, I think, somewhat\nunusual that in the strange circumstances of their\ndisappearance, that there wouldn't be some small amount of\ntime given to find out what had happened.\nMR. WILSON: Except that the circumstances that\nwere presented to the trial court, Justice O'Connor, I\nbelieve supported his conclusion that they had left --\nQUESTION: May I just interrupt? Isn't it\ncorrect that the witnesses were sequestered, and the one\nperson who would know where they were would be a court\nemployee who had -- in charge of the sequestered\nwitnesses?\nMR. WILSON: There was a court employee in\ncontact with them and also trial counsel was in contact\nwith them and the defendant.\nQUESTION: No. Trial counsel was in court.\nMR. WILSON: But trial counsel went and checked\non them at 10 o'clock when the State rested its case. He\nwas back one subsequent time I believe the record shows.\nBut at least he says in the new trial motion -- he says\nwith clarity and particularity that he went there at 11\no'clock and they were gone. So, from the time he knew\nthat they were gone, 2 hours elapsed before they were back\nin front of the trial court.\nAnd it is important to note that the -- the\ncolloquy that occurs.\nQUESTION: Well, they might have gone down to\nget an apple out of the vending machine. I mean, the\ncounsel has got a lot to do. He's got his closing -- his\nopening statement for the defense. He's got his\nwitnesses. He goes down. They're not in the room. I\ndon't -- I don't attribute much to that.\nMR. WILSON: But if these are the witnesses that\nstand between this young man and life in prison without\nparole, it is absolutely to be presumed that trial counsel\ndid what trial counsel would do in that circumstance and\nsay, you are under subpoena. You don't leave this\ncourtroom unless I tell you -- you don't leave the\ncourthouse unless I tell you it is okay. Our case is now\nbeginning. It will proceed --\nQUESTION: Why would he have any reason to think\nthat witnesses who had come on their -- by their own\nexpense all the way from California and who were in the\ncourtroom that very morning -- they were there at 8:30, as\nI understand, and at 10 o'clock they're still there. Why\nwould he have any reason to think they would leave?\nMR. WILSON: Justice Ginsburg, he may not have\nbelieved that they would leave or -- or suspected they\nmight leave, but these are the sorts of instructions that\ntrial counsel give their witnesses whether or not they\nthink that that might happen because the circumstances can\nbe very dire if they do leave.\nQUESTION: Well, if -- if we're -- if we're\ngoing to make an argument based on what trial counsel\ncould be expected to do, why isn't it equally fair to make\nan argument about what trial judges could be expected to\ndo?\nAnd I would have supposed that if the trial\njudge was denying that motion based on rule 9 or rule 10\ngrounds, he would have said I'm denying your motion\nbecause you haven't conformed with rule 9 to put it in\nwriting, if that was the case, or rule 10, to specify what\nyou're supposed to specify. And he didn't do that. And I\nam also supposing that if he had done anything like that,\ncounsel would have said, gosh, judge, please give me a\npiece of paper and let me write this out.\nSo, why -- why isn't it a -- a fair inference,\nwhen the judge says nothing about these rules, that the\njudge in fact is not relying on those rules in any way?\nMR. WILSON: First, the judge did ask, following\nthe discussion about what had happened, whether counsel\nintended to file a motion for a continuance. It seems\nclear in that that he expected or at least had reason to\nbelieve that counsel would be providing a writing.\nSecond, this trial judge was a very well-\nrespected court of appeals judge in the State of Missouri,\nand in fact he sat on the panel that decided State v.\nSettle, which is cited in our brief, which was a case that\ndetermined that a showing -- where the 24.10 showing was\nnot made, either by affidavit, but also by substance, that\nthe motion -- that the denial of the motion could be\naffirmed on that basis alone.\nQUESTION: Even -- even where it wasn't -- the\ndenial wasn't based on that basis.\nAre any of the other Missouri cases involve a\nsituation where the trial judge did not rely on 9 or 10,\nbut nonetheless, his action was affirmed on the basis of\n-- of failure to comply with 9 or 10?\nMR. WILSON: I don't know any of the dozens of\nMissouri cases that are cited in the briefs that applied\nthe rule that a failure to comply with those rules will\nforeclose appellate review where they cited that the\ntrial judge had made a specific finding 24.09 has been or\n24.10 has been violated. Instead, that's the -- the\nreview that the appellate court undertook.\nSecond --\nQUESTION: The question was --\nQUESTION: -- on that -- I -- I mean, they have\na lot of cases. You know, and in their reply brief they\nhave -- the other side has some that seem pretty much on\npoint against you. But there's no case that I can find\ndirectly on point. Direct.\nMR. WILSON: Justice Breyer --\nQUESTION: So -- so, if that -- maybe you can\nsuggest one, but I'll go back and read it. But the -- the\nrule -- the standard I thought might be useful is the\nstandard in respect to that, that did the lawyer have fair\nnotice that the rule exists and applies in the\ncircumstances.\nNow, maybe since -- and it was written in an\namicus brief that favors your side -- maybe you approve of\nthat standard. And I'd like to know, A, do you or not?\nAnd if you do approve of that standard, but I come to the\nconclusion here that that trial judge did not have fair\nnotice that the Missouri rules would apply in these\ncircumstances where he was suddenly surprised by the loss\nof witnesses and nobody in the courtroom said a word about\n9 or 10. And nobody said anything about 9 ever, and the\nappellate court went and applied it for the first time on\nits own.\nThat's a big question, but it has two parts, and\nI'd like an answer. The standard and the application of\nit.\nMR. WILSON: The standard that you gave me,\nJustice Breyer, I don't believe differs materially from\nthe standard in Ford v. Georgia which is firmly\nestablished and regularly applied. It's important to note\nthat regularly applied does not mean precisely applied to\nthese exact circumstances in a published case prior to the\ndefendant's trial, but rather regularly -- regularly\nenforced.\nAnd so, I believe that the standard you\narticulate is a good one, and this rule meets it because,\nA, it's published, and B, there were an -- an unbroken\nstring of precedents both before defendant's trial and\nsince that time, and not one of them excuses a default\nunder 24.09 or 24.10, reaches the merits of a request for\na continuance, and finds that the denial was error.\nQUESTION: The reason the -- the three aspects\nof it that suggest maybe this lawyer did not have fair\nnotice that the rule would apply in the circumstances are,\nfirst, the lawyer was surprised by his loss of witnesses.\nSo, he didn't have time to prepare anything in writing in\nadvance.\nSecond, he's in the courtroom talking to the\njudge and he knows full well that everyone in that\ncourtroom knows every single thing about what rule 9 and\nrule 10 require. There was no missing fact. The judge\nknew it. The prosecuting attorney knew it, and he knew\nit.\nAnd third, there is no Missouri case that says\nthat we're going to require a useless act in the\ncircumstance where the lawyer has suddenly been surprised\nby his loss of witnesses and everything is going on orally\nin front of the judge anyway.\nNow, those are the three that I think cut\nagainst you, and so I'd like your reply.\nMR. WILSON: Surprise, Justice Breyer, was not\npresent. He went to the witness room at 11 o'clock in the\nmorning before the lunch break, substantially before the\nlunch break, and discovered that they had left. From 11\no'clock then until just after 1 o'clock is the amount of\ntime he had to conduct his investigation as to where they\nhad gone, but also to prepare a writing.\nBut leave aside the writing requirement, which\nmay or may not have operated with any purpose in this\nsituation -- I believe that it did. But more importantly,\nhe did not gather the information and present it all at\nonce to the judge that 24.10 requires.\nSecond --\nQUESTION: Could you just tell me on that, what\ncould he have told the judge that he knew that he didn't\ntell the judge?\nMR. WILSON: He did not tell the judge that\nthese witnesses could be located in a reasonable amount of\ntime and that they would give the testimony that it has\nbeen suggested they would give.\nQUESTION: Well, he -- the judge knew what\ntestimony they were going to give. You don't question\nthat, do you, that there --\nMR. WILSON: I -- I do question that, Justice\nStevens.\nQUESTION: Didn't -- didn't the lawyer announce\nit in his opening statement to the jury? Isn't that one\nreason it was so -- so prejudicial that they didn't show\nup?\nMR. WILSON: The -- the -- a lawyer's statements\nand opening statement are not evidence and they're not\nevidentiary.\nQUESTION: But the judge heard the statement.\nMR. WILSON: He did hear the statement, but\nwhat's --\nQUESTION: He knew what the witnesses were\nintended to testify to, didn't he?\nMR. WILSON: But 24.10 requires more than that,\nJustice Stevens.\nQUESTION: Well, he did know that much, don't\nyou agree?\nMR. WILSON: I do, but -- but it requires\nsomeone to attach their credibility to the proposition\nthat they will actually give that testimony.\nQUESTION: And, of course, I suppose the lawyer\nknew what the family would testify to before they heard\nthe strengths of the prosecution's case, which was that\nthere were four witnesses that put him in -- in the city.\nQUESTION: I don't suppose a lot of judges\nconcentrate intently on opening statements the way they do\nperhaps motions that they have to decide or something like\nthat. If -- if some -- in the rare instance where\nopposing counsel objects to an opening statement, the\njudge -- but certainly he doesn't pay attention to that\nthe way he would to lots of other things in the case.\nMR. WILSON: Your Honor, that might be true as a\ngeneral proposition, but we don't need to rely on a\ngeneral proposition in this case because this judge told\nthese lawyers in this lawsuit the following. Quote: I\ndon't have a lot of faith in what's said in opening\nstatements anyway. That's the trial --\nQUESTION: Are you going to tell me right now --\nwe both read this record. And are you going to tell me\nthat in your opinion, the judge did not know that these\nwitnesses were here to say that the defendant was in\nCalifornia at the time?\nMR. WILSON: The judge knew that he did not have\nanybody in that courtroom who was willing to stand up and\nsay on my credibility, that's what these witnesses --\nQUESTION: He did not know that he had the\nlawyer's assurance of that. He did not know that he had\nthe lawyer's assurance of that.\nMR. WILSON: Or any other --\nQUESTION: Because in fact he did not have the\nlawyer's assurance.\nMR. WILSON: That's correct.\nQUESTION: But he did --\nQUESTION: Actually I asked the question that\nI'd like an answer to. The question that I asked you was\nwhether you're prepared to say right now that the judge\ndid not know that the purpose of these witnesses was to\ntestify that the defendant was in California at the time.\nI didn't ask you the question that Justice Scalia asked.\nI asked you my question. I'd like to know the answer to\nmy question.\nMR. WILSON: I believe that the -- that the\njudge knew what had been said -- what had been attributed\nto them in the opening statement. I -- that is not the\ntest that 24.10 requires. That's not the --\nQUESTION: That's a different -- well, if you're\n-- you're willing to say, which I think is fair and I\nthink correct, that on the basis of this record, the judge\nknew that the point of these witnesses was to testify that\nthe defendant was in California at the time.\nMR. WILSON: At the most --\nQUESTION: The answer to my question is yes. Is\nthat right?\nMR. WILSON: Yes. At the most what he knew was\ncounsel expected that to be their testimony the day of --\nQUESTION: Well, he knew something more than\nthat, didn't he? He knew that counsel, who was an officer\nof the court and need not be sworn in making\nrepresentations in that courtroom, had represented as a\nmatter of fact to the judge and to the jury that that's\nwhat the witnesses would testify.\nMR. WILSON: No, I don't believe that that's\ncorrect. I don't believe that that's what you can say his\nstatement and opening statement means. I think that it\nmeans that standing there -- at -- at the most, what you\ncould say is, standing there in front of the jury -- and\nhe's addressing the jury and not the judge -- that his\nbest expectation of the best the evidence will be out of\nthe witnesses' mouths is as he stated it. I don't --\nQUESTION: What -- I presume what he stated was\nnot if things go as well for me as possible, these people\nwill say as follows. I presume what he said is, I have\nthese three witnesses. He described their relationship,\ntheir location, et cetera. And they will testify that the\ndefendant was in California at the time. I presume that's\nwhat he represented in open court. Isn't that correct?\nMR. WILSON: That is what he told the jury.\nQUESTION: -- because we have the transcript\nthat shows exactly that. He told the jury these are the\nthree witnesses. They will testify that he was in\nCalifornia. He described the witnesses and he said, they\nwill testify.\nMR. WILSON: Yes.\nQUESTION: He didn't say, the best thing that\nyou might infer from what they testify.\nMR. WILSON: But counsel's statements to the\njury in opening statement are not held to the level of a\nrepresentation of an officer of the court to the judge --\nQUESTION: But the judge was fully apprised that\nthe defendant was expecting to put on witnesses and that\nthey were alibi witnesses. There's no doubt about that,\nis there?\nMR. WILSON: The judge knew facts -- knew those\nfacts from the opening statement only.\nBut 24.10 requires someone to attach their\ncredibility to those propositions when they are asserted\nas the basis for an interruption in the orderly conduct of\na criminal trial.\nQUESTION: Is it your experience that witnesses\never have second thoughts about giving their story after\nthey've heard the strength of the prosecution's case?\nMR. WILSON: That -- Your Honor, I believe that\nthat does happen. And I believe especially it can happen\nin a case such as this one where the defense counsel did\nnot know the strength of the State's case as accurately as\nhe might have because instead of the --\nQUESTION: But were these witnesses in the\ncourtroom to hear that testimony? I thought they had been\nsequestered.\nMR. WILSON: They had been sequestered. That's\ncorrect.\nQUESTION: So how would they know? How would\nthey know the strength of the government's case if they\nhadn't been there to hear it?\nMR. WILSON: I don't know that they did know,\nbut I know that they visited frequently with the defendant\nand with defendant's counsel. I don't know that they did\nknow.\nAnd -- and it isn't for us 9 years later --\nQUESTION: They did later file affidavits\nsubstantiating what the -- was said in the opening\nstatement, didn't they?\nMR. WILSON: Excuse me?\nQUESTION: They did later file affidavits\nconsistent with what the counsel had said in his opening\nstatement.\nMR. WILSON: Yes, 4 years later they did, 4\nyears --\nQUESTION: What about the third part which is --\nI -- I take it as well that you would agree that the judge\nheard that this -- the missing witness is a minister who's\nthere for a religious event that's taking place that\nevening. All right.\nSo, we know that 9 and 10 were not literally\ncomplied with. Now, but they might have been\nsubstantially complied with. And so, at this point, when\neverybody knows in the room what's going on, was the\nlawyer fairly apprised that what we had to do was perform\nwhat he might have thought of as a useless act?\nAnd the case that's the strongest for your yes\nanswer, he had to go through the form even though the\nsubstance was right there in the case of the surprise\nwitnesses -- your strongest case or two under Missouri law\nis?\nMR. WILSON: Missouri v. Cuckovich and other\ncases cited in the -- in the dissent in the Eighth Circuit\nwhere he quite candidly categorizes and admits that\nMissouri rules of 24.09 and 24.10 applied prior to trial,\nat the outset of trial, and during trial. They apply --\nthey apply --\nQUESTION: Well, you don't want us to decide\nthis case on the fact that he didn't make an affidavit, do\nyou? I mean, that's so easy. The judge puts him under\noath or gives him 2 minutes to write something out.\nYou're not resting on that, are you?\nMR. WILSON: Your Honor, I am not --\nQUESTION: -- 24.10 I would --I would think.\nMR. WILSON: I'm not going to stand on the\nformality, and we didn't stand in the court of appeals on\na formality of a writing or even the formality of an\naffidavit.\nBut there was no one in the courtroom at the\ntime this issue was being decided who was willing to\nattach their credibility to these assertions, who was\nwilling to say to the judge, if you stop this trial, I\nbelieve there is a reasonable probability that I can\nproduce these witnesses and that they will give this\ndefendant an alibi, that they will say on the date and\ntime of this murder, he was not within 1,000 miles.\nQUESTION: So, if I read through the transcript\nand I came to the conclusion that everyone in that\ncourtroom in that very short trial, in the circumstances\ngiven what was said, would have very clear that this\nlawyer does mean to tell the judge, one, these are my own\nwitnesses that make a difference. Two, they're alibi\nwitnesses. Three, they're going to say he's in\nCalifornia. Four, I don't know why they left. Five, give\nme a couple of hours or at least till tomorrow morning.\nHe's giving a sermon downtown and I'd like to try to find\nhim. Now, if I come to the conclusion that any one\nreasonable person in that courtroom would have thought\nthat was -- the lawyer was saying that in the\ncircumstances, I could hold against you. Is that right?\nIf I think that the circumstances were such in the\ncourtroom that anyone would have -- any reasonable person\nwould have come to the conclusion that this was in effect\nwhat the lawyer was telling the judge.\nMR. WILSON: In effect, what the lawyer was\ntelling the judge by reference, implied or otherwise, to\nthe entire body of trial is not what 24.09 or 24.10\nrequire. They require that that showing be made in the\napplication for the continuance.\nNow, if we say that an oral application is fine,\nokay, but you still have to present the facts and you have\nto present them in a way that makes them believable\nbecause what's being asked for is a serious imposition on\nthe trial court and its conduct of this criminal trial.\nQUESTION: Mr. Wilson, at the time of the new\ntrial motion, the transcript was available to the judge of\nthe proceedings?\nMR. WILSON: I don't know, Justice Ginsburg.\nThe new trial motion was filed 2 weeks after trial, but\nthe new trial motion was heard 2 months after trial.\nQUESTION: My concern with your position is you\nsuggest twice in your brief that counsel ought to have\nscribbled out this 24.09 notice. He could have had a\nlegal pad and scribbled it out. That seems inconsistent\nwith your answer that you're not seeking to the form.\nHere is -- is a man on trial for a very serious\noffense. The lawyer is faced with the absence of the only\nwitnesses he has. He's got to do his best. Should he be\nthinking about scribbling anything on a piece of paper?\nShould he be -- have all of his attention trained on how\ncan he do the best for his client under these extremely\nhorrible circumstances?\nMR. WILSON: Justice Ginsburg, that argument in\nthe brief is -- is not made to show what a reasonable\nlawyer would do or what every lawyer could do, but rather\nto show that it was neither impossible nor impractical --\nimpracticable to comply with the rule.\nQUESTION: Well, I -- I -- 29.09. I was\nsurprised to see the Missouri Court of Appeals interpret\nit to apply to things like a motion for a continuance\narising during trial because it -- well, it's very\ndifficult, I would think, for a lawyer, suddenly faced\nwith an emergency like this, to -- you know, you obviously\n-- you can't go back to your office and dictate a motion,\nand to simply write out something in longhand when perhaps\nhe can simply make the statement orally.\nMR. WILSON: It may be surprising that -- that\nthe court of appeals and the Missouri Supreme Court have\ndone that, but they have done it. And that is the\nMissouri law and -- and it has been so for some time. And\nthe mere fact --\nQUESTION: We don't know -- we don't know that\n-- that the idea of you have to scribble something in the\ncourt has been around for some time because, as you said,\nthere's no case that presents precisely that situation\nwhere the motion is in the -- in the heat trial something\nunexpected happens. You have no precedent that says, even\nso, under the Missouri rules you must sit there in your\nseat at counsel table and scribble out a motion.\nMR. WILSON: Well, the -- no. The -- the\nprecise circumstances of this petitioner's case have not\narisen in a published case in Missouri. That's correct.\nBut there is -- it was clear that in the midst\ntrial and even in some exigency, the courts of appeals and\nthe Missouri Supreme Court had held 24.09 and 24.10 to\nrequire a writing and a sufficient showing in the past.\nAnd -- so, if this counsel -- as soon as this colloquy was\nconcluded and the motion had been denied, they turned\nimmediately to the -- to the petitioner's counsel's motion\nfor judgment of acquittal at the close of all of the\nevidence. He made that motion orally, but because he knew\nthat in order to preserve his right to appeal any of the\npoints therein, he asked the judge, and the judge gave him\npermission, to file the writing later.\nThe same is true with this rule. Because\nanybody who had read the cases applying 24.09 and 24.10\nwould know that you are forfeiting your right to appellate\nreview of a denial if you have not put the sufficient\nshowing before the judge and done so in writing.\nQUESTION: Mr. Wilson, I thought you weren't\ngoing to rely very much on the -- on the not written part,\nbut let's talk about the other part, that all of these --\neven if all of these factors of substance that had to be\nin the motion were somewhere in the trial transcript and\neven if you could say that this trial judge knew it, you\ncouldn't say, could you, that the court of appeals knew\nit, that the court of appeals could look back to this\nmotion without searching the entire transcript and asking\nitself, I wonder what, under this transcript, the trial\njudge knew? The -- the court of appeals in Missouri could\nnot look at the motion and say, well, he set forth what he\nhad to say -- set forth. That -- that's clear, isn't it?\nMR. WILSON: Yes, that is clear.\nQUESTION: The court of appeals would have been\nconstrained to review the entire trial record, which it is\none of the purposes of -- of .10 to avoid.\nMR. WILSON: Yes, it is. 24.10 -- one of the --\nQUESTION: It is not purposeless, even if you\nassume that the trial judge knew that -- that in fact the\nlawyer was -- was making the affidavit that he -- that he\nhad to make.\nMR. WILSON: Yes. The purpose would be to\nprovide a meaningful appellate review by bounding the\nrelevant facts in a credible fashion and presenting them\nnot just to the trial judge, but also to the court of\nappeals.\nQUESTION: But, of course, I suppose the court\nof appeals is entitled to rely upon the trial judge's\nreasons when it reviews the adequacy of those reasons for\ngranting the motion. So, if the trial judge's reasons do\nnot look -- do not reasonably refer to rule 10, then I\nsuppose on anybody's theory, the court of appeals wouldn't\nhave to search the record. Isn't that so?\nMR. WILSON: No, I don't believe so because the\n-- the very purpose of the appellate rule is that they\nwill not do exactly that. If 24.09 and 24.10 were not\ncomplied with, then it doesn't really matter.\nQUESTION: No. All I'm -- all I'm saying is\nthat I thought what the -- the State court of appeals\nwould review would be the -- the reasons given by the\ntrial judge for ruling as he did. Isn't that correct?\nMR. WILSON: No, I don't believe so. I believe\n-- I believe that what is appealed from is the decision\nand not the reasons for the decision.\nQUESTION: Mr. Wilson, in -- in answer to\nJustice Scalia's question about hunting through the whole\nrecord, wouldn't counsel, notified about the 24.10\nrequirement, say, judges, you don't have to read through\nthe whole record? I'm putting it all in front of you, the\nexact words. It will maybe be two or three pages, but not\na whole record. Shouldn't the attorney be able to, in\nthis very case, in a matter of a few pages say where --\nwhere it was in the transcript?\nMR. WILSON: Except that compliance with 24.10\ndoesn't -- doesn't require you to be able to trace it\nthrough the record, but rather that you presented it all\nat once to the trial judge and that you did so with some\ncredible reason to believe that what was being asserted\nwas so.\nYour Honors, 2 -- 2 months after this -- after\nthe denial of the continuance occurred, they appeared\nbefore this very same trial judge to hear the motion for a\nnew trial. No explanation was given to that judge. No\nbetter or further showing was provided. Even the simplest\nfact like the -- like that they were available and able to\ntestify the very next day in Kansas City was not offered\nto this trial judge. There was no due process claim\nbefore this trial judge either at trial or on the motion\nfor new trial, and he had no facts to believe that he had\ndone anything other than what was fundamentally fair under\nthat circumstance on the circumstances as they had been\npresented to him in the context of the motion for a\ncontinuance.\nThank you.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Wilson.\nMs. Vergeer, you have 3 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF BONNIE I. ROBIN-VERGEER\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMS. VERGEER: Just a few quick points. With\nrespect to the proffer and somebody being willing to put\ntheir credibility on the line, the defendant actually took\nthe stand during the -- the colloquy on the continuance.\nHe was sworn, which actually you would think is a superior\nform of proof to an affidavit, and there he was subject to\ncross-examination by the prosecutor, if there had been any\nquestions. She didn't have any other than to clarify that\nthe witnesses had been under subpoena, which they had\nbeen. And -- and so, I -- I think that the -- that whole\nlike of inquiry about whether somebody is willing to sort\nof swear to facts in support of the motion sort of falls\nby the wayside because he was on the stand.\nIn addition, in terms of what -- what all the\nplayers in the sea knew about -- about these witnesses,\nthere's a rule. It's rule 25.05 of the Missouri rules\nthat requires a notice of an alibi to be given.\nApparently one was given because the prosecutor came\nprepared in her opening statement to address briefly the\nfact that there was an alibi defense that she expected to\nbe presented.\nAnd in addition, the detectives interviewed\nthese witnesses while they were in Kansas City and took\nstatements from them, and if there was any question later,\nas the record developed further in Federal court, about\nwhether these witnesses really would have said what --\nwhat they said they were going to say, the State had\nwhatever notes or statements that was taken from the\ninterviews that were done with these witnesses.\nQUESTION: Ms. Robin-Vergeer, was any due\nprocess argument ever raised at the motion for a new trial\nlevel?\nMS. VERGEER: At the motion for a new trial, the\ndefendant argued the denial of the brief continuance and\nthe denial of the arrest warrant to enforce the subpoenas\n-- argued that that denied the defendant a fair trial.\nDue Process Clause was specifically mentioned in the post-\nconviction motion and on appeal in the Missouri Court of\nAppeals.\nQUESTION: Well, in the post-conviction\nproceeding, as I recall, what was raised was ineffective\nassistance of counsel primarily.\nMS. VERGEER: Actually, it -- it was both. In\nthe amended post-conviction motion and -- and the relevant\npassage is on page 56 of the joint appendix and it\ncontinues through page 58 -- the defendant specifically\nargued that movant was denied his rights to due process of\nlaw and to the effective assistance of counsel guaranteed\nby the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments when -- and then it\nsort of recites, and it -- and it goes along and says --\nand talks about, A, the fact that someone told the\nwitnesses to leave and, B, that the trial court overruled\nthe -- the defense motion for a continuance. So -- so,\nthe Due Process Clause is -- is explicitly stated there\nand -- and thereafter.\nIf there are no further questions.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Ms.\nVergeer.\n"
