WAXMAN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. WAXMAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThis case is properly before this Court,\nwhich should reverse under the plain language and\npurpose of the Organic Act of Guam. As to jurisdiction,\nat the time Congress amended the Organic Act to replace\nthe certiorari jurisdiction of the Ninth Circuit with\ndirect review in this Court, the Ninth Circuit had\nalready granted the writ of certiorari that had been\ntimely filed and the case had been briefed, argued and\nsubmitted. The amendment said nothing about its\napplication to pending appeals, and someone had to\ndecide whether and how it applied to this case. The\nNinth Circuit was the proper body to do that, at least\nin the first instance, and until it did, this case was\nbefore that Court within the meaning of Gibbs versus\nWynn.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Waxman, I thought the\nNinth Circuit did decide that question in another case\nthat was pending, Santos.\nMR. WAXMAN: It did decide it in Santos,\nJustice Scalia.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why wasn't that the time at\nwhich it was clear that the Ninth Circuit no longer had\njurisdiction?\nMR. WAXMAN: Well, for reasons that we\narticulate, Your Honor, in a -- I forget the footnote\nnumber, but a footnote in our brief, there are some\nimportant distinctions, although they turned out not to\nbe dispositive, between the nature and position of this\ncase and Santos.\nBut in any event, we know from the Ninth\nCircuit that it did not consider it otherwise, because\nif the Court will refer to I believe it's page 50a or\n51a of the joint appendix, after the Court decided\nSantos, it sua sponte issued an order in this case -- it\nis on page 51a -- resubmitting this case effective\nFebruary 1 to the Ninth Circuit's active consideration.\nAnd shortly thereafter, it filed the order in this case\nfrom that -- in our view, triggered the 2101(c) 90-day\nperiod.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Are you suggesting that\nthe test is whether under colorable jurisdiction -- a\nhypothetical case, suppose the statute, Federal statute\nis very clear that it applies in any case. Would your\nargument be the same?\nMR. WAXMAN: Well, I wouldn't have the most,\nthe strongest argument that I have in this case. I\nthink -- now, the Court's cases are not clear here but\nit does seem to me that in the instance as here, where\nit isn't just that a party has made some application or\nfiled a cert petition with a court, but the court has\nactually reached out and asserted jurisdiction, surely\nanything other than an amendment withdrawing -- that an\nactive withdrawing -- withdrawing jurisdiction that\nrequires anything other than merely a ministerial act,\nwhere there can be no possible confusion about what\nCongress intended to do, certainly anything short of\nthat, it lies with the Court to ascertain it. And here\n--\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But if we accept that in\nthe opinion, what was the phrase you used, colorable\njurisdiction, or -- it's something I made up, I suppose\n-- is there some concept that we can refer to or some\nphrase that works to -- in order to incorporate your\ntest that you seem to be suggesting?\nMR. WAXMAN: I actually would not embrace\nthat test. I think that in an instance, Your Honor,\nwhere a court in which, properly had jurisdiction and\naffirmatively asserted it and issued -- and I can take\nthe Court through this -- a series of orders of the\nCourt, following this 19, the October 19, 2004 enactment\nleading up to the decision in Santos and thereafter,\nwhich the Court continued to rule, continued to issue\norders in this case, I think a good argument can be made\nthat on a theory of constitutional avoidance the court\nought to construe any enactment of Congress, no matter\nhow pellucid it is, as not constituting a self-effecting\nreversal of a preexisting order of the Court in which\nthe case had been pending per order of the Court.\nAnd so I'm not sure that I would even\nembrace a ministerial test concept in the context in\nwhich a case is properly pending in front of a court\nwhich has affirmatively asserted jurisdiction over it.\nAnd indeed here --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Mr. Waxman, may I just ask\nthis question? I don't understand what the import of\nthis order on page 51 is. I have it in front of me.\nWhat did that do? Is it anything different immediately\nafter the order entered than --\nMR. WAXMAN: Yes. Yes, Your Honor. And I\nthink you should -- well, I suppose you could start\nanywhere. But let's, maybe it would be as well to start\non 49a of the joint appendix. In December 15 --\nremember, the Guam Organic Act was amended I believe\nOctober 30, 19 -- or 2004, and it was silent as to its\neffect on cases that had already been filed and were\npending in the Ninth Circuit.\nSua sponte, the Court -- well, actually it\nwas not sua sponte. Almost two months after Congress\nenacted the Organic Act, the respondent in this case,\nGovernor Camacho filed a motion on December 8 with the\nCourt renewing a previous motion for the Court to\nexpedite its resolution in this case. And Governor\nCamacho's affidavit in support of that motion is\nincluded in the joint appendix.\nIn response to the motion, not telling the\nCourt hey, by the way, it's been nice doing business\nwith you but we have no further truck with your court\nbecause Congress passed the statute and you are ipso\nfacto by operation of law no longer in business, the\nNinth Circuit issued the order on page 49a that says no\nopinion in this case can issue until the case of Santos\nis decided clarifying our continuing certiorari\njurisdiction over decisions from the Guam Supreme Court.\nThen turn to page 50a of the joint appendix.\nA week later, on December 22, the Court sua sponte\nissues an order withdrawing and deferring a ruling in\nthis case pending the decision in Santos. Santos is\nthen decided in January. And on February 1, the Court\nissues an order in this pending case saying okay, it's\nresubmitted to the panel. And shortly thereafter, the\npanel issued the order dismissing this case for lack of\njurisdiction, and from that date we filed a timely\npetition for certiorari.\nNow the contention of the respondent in this\ncase that the attorney general should immediately upon\nenactment of the Organic Act amendment have also filed a\npetition with this Court would do one of two things. It\neither would have put this Court in the position of\ndetermining the effect of the amendment at the very same\ntime that the Ninth Circuit was doing so, which is a\nstate of affairs that this Court has repeatedly\nrejected, most notably in Andrews versus Virginia\nRailway, or it would have amounted to nothing more than\nwhat this Court has called, quote, \"the filing of a\nredundant slip of paper.\"\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, am I wrong? I\nthought that the Attorney General of Guam did file cert\nin some cases that are pending, or am I wrong on that?\nMR. WAXMAN: The attorney -- there were two\ncases in which the Guam Supreme Court issued a final --\nits own final ruling after the October 30, 2004\namendment of the Organic Act. And in that instance, the\nOrganic Act was in effect. He filed a petition for a\nwrit of certiorari in this Court. There were two cases\nthat were pending in the Ninth Circuit and over which\nthe Ninth Circuit had granted the writ, this case and\nSantos. In Santos, but not in this case, the Court\nasked the parties to file supplemental briefs with\nrespect to the Court's continued jurisdiction, and the\nattorney general did so in this case, and it's discussed\nin our reply brief.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Waxman, going back to\nwhat you just said, isn't a third possibility, the most\nlikely possibility, that this Court would simply hold\nthe petition if there were -- if the attorney general\nfiled a cert petition here while the Ninth Circuit had\nnot yet disposed of the case, this Court could have just\nheld it because the Ninth Circuit was likely soon to\ndispose of it.\nMR. WAXMAN: Well, the attorney general\ncould have filed a petition for writ of certiorari\nbefore judgment in this Court, you know, at any time\nprior to the time that the Ninth Circuit issued its\norder dismissing jurisdiction.\nThis Court has said uniformly outside the\nspecial context of three-judge courts that it will not\nrequire the mere filing of a redundant piece of paper,\nto quote the Colville Indian Reservation case, and it\nhas declined to extend this well, why don't you just\nfile a notice of appeal.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: There's no sense in\nwhich it's redundant, though. It would have been the\nfirst piece of paper that this Court would have seen in\nthe matter.\nMR. WAXMAN: Yes. But that is actually what\nthis Court was referring to in the Colville Indian\nReservation case and other cases in calling it redundant\nin the sense that it was identical or effectively\nidentical to a piece of paper that had invoked the\njurisdiction of another court at the same time.\nIn the three-judge court context,\nJustice Ginsburg, although this Court's jurisdiction to\nhear direct appeals in three-judge courts has been\ngreatly reduced since the 1950s and sixties and early\nseventies, there are certain instances that this Court\nhas realized where it is unclear whether an appeal lies\nto a regional court of appeals or to this Court and it\nis unavoidable there that you would file a notice of\nappeal in both instances; but this is not a situation in\nwhich there was any uncertainty about where the petition\nfor a writ of certiorari from the Guam Supreme Court's\ndecision had to be filed. The Organic Act said the\nNinth Circuit had certiorari jurisdiction. The Ninth\nCircuit granted the petition in this case and had\nassumed authority over it, and so --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But isn't it just the\ncase -- you've made several arguments, but you have a\ncase that's lodged in the court of appeals. It's not\nsimply a petition there. They have accepted it for\nreview.\nMR. WAXMAN: Right.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So in the normal course\nwhen you have a district court decision, a trial court\ndecision, then you're on appeal and the case is fully\nlodged in the court of appeals, it's like the judgment\nis suspended until the appellate court is done. So you\nhave no final judgment that is properly taken anyplace\nelse until that judgment is entered. I think that's the\nessence of your argument, isn't it?\nMR. WAXMAN: Yes, and in fact -- I mean,\nit's -- I don't think that anything actually turns on\nthis in the context of this case, but it is quite\nsignificant that at the time -- there has yet never been\nany appellate determination of the substantive question\nin this case. The Guam Supreme Court considered this as\na court of first instance that original petition was\nfiled in the Guam Supreme Court.\nAnd the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals at\nthe time that the attorney general filed the petition\nfor a writ of certiorari was the only place the attorney\ngeneral of Guam could go to get review of this\nconstruction by a territorial court sitting as a trial\ncourt in the first instance of an act of Congress.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Does it make any difference\nthat the review was discretionary in the Ninth Circuit?\nWhat if before the act was passed there was an appeal as\nof right to the Ninth Circuit? Wouldn't your argument\nbe exactly the same?\nMR. WAXMAN: It would be exactly the same.\nWe just think that, given the fact that this is an\ninstance in which the Ninth Circuit granted the writ of\ncertiorari and issued both before -- both before the\namendment and after the amendment and both before Santos\nand after Santos orders reflecting the fact that it\nbelieved it continued to have authority over this case,\nthe appropriate outcome in this case is more\nstraightforward than it might be in some other closer\ninstances.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Perhaps you should go on\nto the merits.\nMR. WAXMAN: Thank you.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And on that I have a\npreliminary question, because we have a new attorney\ngeneral and the question is whether the new attorney\ngeneral continues to oppose the legislature and the\ngovernor on this bond issue. Do -- in other words, do\nwe still have a case or controversy?\nMR. WAXMAN: Yes, Justice Ginsburg, we do.\nI have spoken personally and repeatedly with the\nattorney general, who is with me at counsel table, who\nhas instructed me unequivocally to continue vigorously\nto advocate the construction of the Organic Act that\nreflected in our petition and in our merits and reply\nbrief.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I have a more basic\nquestion, whether we had a case or controversy to start\nwith. This is kind of an intramural dispute between two\nGuamanian officials about what Guam's position should be\nwith respect to the Organic Act and I'm wondering why\nthat's a justiciable controversy under Article III. The\ncases you cited in your petition all involved on its --\nonly facially intra -- interbranch disputes within the\nFederal Government; but the agencies in those cases\nalways -- were representing a real party in interest.\nUnited States versus ICC, the ICC was actually the\nrailroad in whose favor the had commission ruled. Why\nshouldn't we just let Guam figure out its position on\nits own and then when a private party with standing\nchallenges something then we'll have a case or\ncontroversy.\nMR. WAXMAN: Well, Mr. Chief Justice, this\nis actually an a fortiori. If you don't agree with me\nand you think that there really wasn't a case or\ncontroversy, then we would respectfully submit the\nappropriate resolution would be to dismiss and vacate\nthe Guam Supreme Court's decision so that the attorney\ngeneral --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Oh, no. Guam --\npresumably, some state courts issue advisory opinions.\nWe don't -- that's their business. It's just a question\nof whether we have jurisdiction to address the question\nin that context.\nMR. WAXMAN: Indeed. But here's the\nsituation here, and this is why I think it's an a\nfortiori case. The attorney general and the governor of\nGuam are each separately elected. They each have\nnon-discretionary obligations under Guam law in addition\nto their obligation to interpret and enforce the\nConstitution and laws of the United States. The\nattorney general cannot be removed by, by the governor,\nby Guam law, unlike the case in many of these Federal\nexecutive branch intramural disputes; and she is\nrequired by Guam law in any instance in which the\ngovernor and the legislature attempt to borrow money\nsubject to the full faith and credit of the territory to\ncertify that such borrowing is lawful. And in this\ninstance, therefore, she is, as the unremovable elected\nchief law enforcement of the territory, she is required\nboth to properly apply the Federal law that, the Organic\nAct that constitutes Guam's constitution and Guam\nterritorial law which requires her affirmatively to\ncertify the legality of the proposed buy-in.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Except that she is\nremovable by election, and that is indeed what has\nhappened. And I understand that one of the issues in\nthe election was precisely whether this borrowing\nauthority existed or not. And if that's the case, you\nhave a new attorney general that presumably as an\noriginal matter would not do what the prior attorney\ngeneral did.\nMR. WAXMAN: Justice Scalia --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So it is an intrabranch\ndispute that can be resolved by the electorate\nessentially.\nMR. WAXMAN: There may very -- it may very\nwell occur. In fact, there either is or imminently will\nbe a proposed additional borrowing of $123 million\nproposed by the governor to the legislature, and that is\ngoing to require this attorney general to ascertain,\npresumably prior to the time this Court -- well, I won't\npresume, but perhaps before this Court renders a\ndecision in this case were it to, whether she can or\ncannot certify that.\nNow, the answer to that question will turn\nin the first instance -- and she's not going to be\nreelected before then. She can't be removed by the\ngovernor before then. Her position is that if she\nascertains that in the form in which it's enacted that\nproposed borrowing implicates, you know, constitutes\ndebt within the meaning of section 11, she will not sign\nthat legislation.\nAnd that, it seems to me, during the\ncampaign -- of course, none of this is in the record --\nher position was that she would continue to pursue this\nlitigation in the Supreme Court, which is why she's\nhere.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I guess I'm not quite sure\nwhat that means. I mean, it's one thing to say I will\npursue the litigation because it would be a good thing\nto have a definitive answer from someone other than the\ngovernor or me. Is it her position at the present time\nthat the position of her predecessor is correct or not?\nMR. WAXMAN: It is her position that if she\nwere presented tomorrow with a borrowing that would\nexceed the debt caps under the position of the attorney\ngeneral in this case, she will not sign it because that\nconstitutes her interpretation of the law.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So she adopts the\ninterpretation of her predecessor?\nMR. WAXMAN: Correct.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I have a question, if I\ncan, if we should reach the merits of the case --\nMR. WAXMAN: I think you should reach the\nmerits of the case.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I know that. That isn't\nit. I have a question about -- I have a question about\nthe merits.\nMR. WAXMAN: Okay. I have four reasons why\nI think we are correct --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I know, but I have a\nquestion I'd like you to go into.\nMR. WAXMAN: Okay.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I looked up, my law clerk\nhas, and found eight States that seem roughly\ncomparable. Those that go to assessed value, every\nsingle one of them -- and most of them do -- they have\nthe word like \"assessment. The only comparable places\nwe found are Puerto Rico, Philippines in 1916, and Guam\nhere which don't use the word \"assessment,\" but use the\nwords \"aggregate taxable value.\"\nAll right. Now, what's happened in those\nplaces? We know what's happening in Guam. I can't --\nwith the Philippines in 1916 and Puerto Rico, there\nought to be some experience there even if we couldn't\nfind a case how they treated it.\nMR. WAXMAN: Well, they -- what's happening\nin all those jurisdictions will certainly consume at\nleast the rest of the balance of my time. The simple\nanswer is that -- is the following. There are --\nlooking first at the States, there are States that use\nthe term \"the valuation.\" There are States that use\n\"the assessed valuation,\" \"aggregate assessed\nvaluation,\" and there are a few States that use \"tax\nvaluation.\" It is uniformly the case in the States and\nelsewhere that the word \"assessed\" in this context is\nunderstood to refer to the valuation against which the\nproperty tax is based, whether that happens to be a\nplace where it is full value or a fractional value; but\nit is also the case that at the time that the Guam\nSupreme -- that the Guam Organic Act was enacted\nfractional valuation was a commonplace for purposes of\nassessing property tax. Now, in the territories --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Try Utah, try Iowa. Try --\nMR. WAXMAN: There were three States that we\ndiscussed, Passy is one, Halsey is the other and I can't\nremember the name of the other one, where they used --\nwhere the State constitution just said \"aggregate\nvaluation\" or \"the valuation\" and the State supreme\ncourt said: There's no modifier for valuation; that\nmust mean full value.\nThere are, conversely, the State supreme\ncourt in Fishburn in the Illinois context and in the\nIndiana context where even that formulation, \"the\nvaluation,\" the State supreme court said: Come on, it\nis -- the debt limitation is always calculated --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Mr. Waxman, can I ask you\nthis, just about Guam, not about the other territories.\nIs there anything in the Organic Act that would prevent\nGuam from changing the assessed percentage from 35\npercent to 100 or 150?\nMR. WAXMAN: Absolutely nothing.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So there's no, no limit in\nthe Organic Act of any real meaning?\nMR. WAXMAN: That's -- the limit in the\nOrganic Act, and it makes it entirely consistent with\nall of the other territories that I -- are not that many\nand I will explicate -- which is the uniform rule has\nbeen that the basis for valuation of property against\nwhich the debt limitation percentage is multiplied is\nthe same as the valuation of property against which the\nproperty taxes apply. And in the territories the\nCongress has used essentially two formulations: In the\nSpringer Act it was \"assessed value of taxable\nproperty.\" In Alaska, it was \"aggregate taxable value.\"\nIn Guam it's \"aggregate tax valuation.\" In Hawaii, it\nwas \"assessed value;\" in the Northern Marianas,\n\"aggregate assessed valuation.\"\nThe Philippines, which you mentioned, is a\nparticularly instructive example because in 1902 and\n1905 it was \"assessed valuation,\" but then in 1916 and\n1922, it was altered to be \"aggregate tax valuation.\"\nAnd then the Virgin -- Puerto Rico is \"aggregate tax\nvaluation\" and the virgin Islands, which we've\ndiscussed, is \"aggregate assessed valuation.\"\nNow, the legislative histories of these\nprovisions, including the Guam provision, are lengthy,\nobscure and frankly have been very difficult to obtain\nbecause in many instances the hearings are unreported.\nAnd we have been receiving the legislative history,\nparticularly the unpublished legislative histories, of\nthese provisions up to and including Saturday because in\nthe 11 days over the Christmas holiday in which we did\nour reply brief we simply could not get hearing,\ntranscripts of hearings that were conducted in 1949 in\nthat Agana, Guam.\nBut we are prepared to lodge the relevant\nprovisions with the Court for the Court, and I don't\nwant to, therefore don't want to make any argument about\nit, but I don't want to say that these words --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Please don't.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. WAXMAN: But the --\nJUSTICE BREYER: My question is the\nfollowing. In Puerto Rico and in the Philippines after\n1916, and in Alaska, were there any instances in which\nthey issued bonds that exceeded the 10 percent of the\nassessed value as opposed to the aggregate market value?\nThey either did or didn't and that shouldn't be hard to\nfind out.\nMR. WAXMAN: I think that would be hard to\nfind out, and I don't know. I do know that there is\nlegislative history with respect to the use of the word\n\"assessed\" and tax in this context both in Puerto Rico\nand in the Philippines. I don't know about Alaska.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Just on the merits, the\nfirst thing that the tax authorities have to do is they\nhave to value the property.\nMR. WAXMAN: Correct.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And they're valuing it for\ntax purposes, so that sounds like tax valuation.\nMR. WAXMAN: I'm not -- our argument is that\nthe word \"tax valuation\" has to have meaning; and the\nplainest meaning is the meaning, we respectfully submit,\nthe most natural meaning of \"tax valuation\" is the\nvaluation that is used by Guam for the calculation of\ntax.\nAnd that's true not only as a matter of\nplain language, but for three other reasons. First of\nall, as I indicated, it puts Guam in harmony with the\nregime that has existed in every other U.S. territory in\nwhich the value of property against which the debt\nlimitation rate is assessed is the same as the value of\nproperty against which the tax rate is assessed. And\nsecondly, or thirdly, that fully accords with the\nstatutory and legislative history both with respect to\nthe territories and the states that reflects that it has\nalways been understood that tax valuation and assessed\nvaluation are equivalent in this context, and\nunderstanding that furthers Congress's consistent goal\nof restraining borrowing by territories.\nAnd finally, interpreting tax to mean full\nrenders the word tax all but meaningless. I grant you,\nJustice Kennedy, that it is possible to come up with a\nmeaning. It is not a meaning that the Guam Supreme\nCourt adopted but it is a possible meaning; but the Guam\nSupreme Court interprets -- actually said in its\nopinion, tax has to mean something. It interpreted tax\nnot to modify valuation, the word that follows it, but\nto modify the word \"property,\" and to read it as taxable\nproperty, which is with all respect plainly wrong.\nJUSTICE BREYER: There are big lenders in\nthe United States and those people don't fool around.\nThey get opinions. And they lend money to Puerto Rico\nor they lend money to some of these places. They're\ngoing to have opinion letters. And those opinion\nletters are going to say whether they think in their\nopinion this is over reaching to many bonds or not. And\nOf course, I would think those opinion letters would say\nfor Puerto Rico, what the words aggregate tax valuation\nmean. They might or might not.\nIn other words, I'm trying to find ways of\ngetting the tax.\nMR. WAXMAN: Okay. I don't have any such\nopinion letters. And I would therefore, much like to\nreserve at least a minute for rebuttal. But with\nrespect --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Now Mr. Waxman,\nwe've taken a fair amount of your time before you got to\nthe merits. So we'll give you a couple of minutes for\nrebuttal. Why don't you answer that.\nMR. WAXMAN: Thank you.\nWith respect to Puerto Rico, Puerto Rico\nhappens to be a situation which so far as we have been\nable to ascertain, the law actually requires that for\npurposes of determining valuation for application of the\ntax rate, the assessed rate is required to be the actual\nvalue, as is the case in the Virgin Islands. So that\ndistinction wouldn't exist.\nOn the other hand, in the Philippines, it is\nclear from 1902 on that a system of fractional valuation\nwas in place. Now, getting -- figuring out what\nactually happened in the Philippines way back when, when\nit was a territory of the United States, has been\nchallenging and its may very well be that there is\ninformation; but simply, simply obtaining for example,\nthe -- the three unpublished hearings with respect to\nthe Virgin Islands legislation in 1949 has been actually\nsurprisingly -- surprisingly challenging. If I may\nreserve the balance of my time?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Waxman. Ms. Brinkmann?\nORAL ARGUMENT OF BETH S. BRINKMANN,\nON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT\nMS. BRINKMANN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may\nit please the Court:\nThis case should be dismissed for want of\njurisdiction because the certiorari petition filed in\nthis Court to review the judgment of the Guam Supreme\nCourt was untimely. If the Court were nonetheless to\nreach the merits of the opinion of the case, the opinion\nof the Guam Supreme Court interpreting section 11 of the\nOrganic Act should be affirmed.\nThere are three principal reasons supporting\nboth of these positions. First, on the dismissal:\nDismissal is required, one, because when the Ninth\nCircuit was divested of authority to adjudicate the\nmerits of the case, on October 30th, 2004, this Court\nwas then the only court that could review that judgment.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Ms. Brinkmann, Congress\nsometimes withdraws jurisdictions from courts, but while\nthe case is spending it isn't until the court issues the\norder -- there's no automatic dismissal of the case when\nCongress passes an act. There is a case lodged in the\ncourt, and that court will follow Congress's directions\nand dismiss it. But until it does, its hold final\njudgment. The judgment of the Guam Supreme Court is\nsuspended while it's sub judicata before the Ninth\nCircuit, and then when the Ninth Circuit acts, then\nthere is a trigger. But until there isn't.\nMS. BRINKMANN: Your Honor, we respectfully\ndisagree. We don't believe that there was any\nsuspension of the time for filing once the Ninth Circuit\nwas divested of jurisdiction. This Court as long ago as\nthe Eisenberg case has recognized that the time for\nfiling certiorari is suspended so long as a lower court\nhas jurisdiction to adjudicate the merits of the case.\nThe Court reinforced that more recently --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What if, what if you have\nan ambiguous statute where it really is not clear\nwhether it applies to pending cases or not? What, what\n-- you say if it turns out after the fact that it does\napply to pending cases, you are out of time, if you\nhaven't immediately filed here while the case is still\n-- is still pending.\nMS. BRINKMANN: No, Your Honor, that is the\nsituation that the Court confronts in the three-judge\ndistrict court cases within in the instances in which\nthere was a mistake made as to where the appeal should\nbe taken. And the Court has jurisdiction to decide, the\njurisdiction in those instances has vacated and remanded\nthe order.\nI want to emphasize to this Court that in\nthe Santos case, Petitioner requested that the Ninth\nCircuit remand the order to the Guam Supreme Court, and\nin the language of this Court, what that does is it\nrefreshes the judgment of the Guam Supreme Court so that\nit can timely brought here. If Petitioner --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask, would the Ninth\nCircuit have had jurisdiction after October 30, 2004 to\nvacate the judgment of the Guam Supreme Court and send\nthe case back?\nMS. BRINKMANN: Yes. We believe under the\nauthority of this Court in those three-judge courts,\nthat is the solution that this Court has established --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: We did that. \"We don't\nhave jurisdiction but we are nevertheless going to enter\nthe following order, which presumably depends on our\nhaving jurisdiction, that the judgment is vacated,\"\nassuming it's bad. You agree that the Ninth Circuit\ncould have done that?\nMS. BRINKMANN: Yes, Your Honor. Petitioner\nagreed that, he asked for that relief in the Santos\ncase.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Isn't that subject\nto gamesmanship? Parties that are out of time in this\nCourt going to a lower court and saying well, just\nvacate and re-enter, and then I can start all over\nagain? We've discouraged that.\nMS. BRINKMANN: We think not, Your Honor.\nIn the Donovan Ricky Richland case, the Court made clear\nyou would not vacate it when it was simply a failure to\nobey the rules. The Court refused to vacate and remand\nin that case, as we point out in our brief. This is a\ncase such as Justice Scalia was positing where there is\nan actual issue of, colorable question of jurisdiction.\nThe proper course would to be to challenge, and here\nPetitioner did not even try to litigate the question,\ndid not file any brief after Santos came down, never\ntried to distinguish this case from Santos. He merely\nwaited and did not timely pursue the writ of the Guam\nSupreme Court, the judgment that was final at that point\nin time.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you'd say Santos,\nthen, is -- is -- is the Rubicon? Not the enactment of\nthe statute, but Santos?\nMS. BRINKMANN: No we believe in this\nparticular instance, particularly on, with the clarity\nunder Brunner, of the divestiture of the Ninth Circuit\njurisdiction here. This is not a rule of force.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yeah. Your last argument,\nthen, is irrelevant. I mean if it's clear, it doesn't\nmatter what they did before.\nMS. BRINKMANN: Well, I'm suggesting in\nresponse to your question, Justice Scalia, that in those\nother situations where there may be a question, that\ndoes not put the Petitioner in a situation of not being\nable to seek review.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Which is not this case.\nMS. BRINKMANN: That's correct, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The Ninth Circuit would\nhave been without authority to issue the orders in\nSantos under your reasoning. The Ninth Circuit is\npowerless because the authority had been transferred by\nvirtue of the statute to this Court, so the Ninth\nCircuit was wrong in any orders it issued.\nMS. BRINKMANN: No, Your Honor, the Ninth\nCircuit maintained jurisdiction to decide jurisdiction.\nAnd indeed if Petitioner had litigated the question of\njurisdiction they could have brought a writ to the Ninth\nCircuit and come to this Court and litigated the\nquestion of jurisdiction. If the Court had found there\nwas jurisdiction it could have reached the merits. If\nthe Court had found it was not, there was no\njurisdiction, it would have -- in the three-judge courts\nand said no, you need to come directly up from the Guam\nSupreme Court with vacate and remand for a fresh\njudgment, and then you come to the Guam Supreme Court.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask, how much time\ndid the Petitioners have after the statute passed? 90\ndays? Or the interval of 90 days minus whatever had\nbeen run?\nMS. BRINKMANN: 90 days Your Honor. We\nbelieve that the --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Why would that be so?\nMS. BRINKMANN: The timely petition to the\nNinth Circuit and the grant of certiorari would have\nsuspended the finality of the Guam Supreme Court\njudgment. Once Congress in its authority to demarcate\nthe jurisdictions of the lower Federal courts had passed\nthat the statute, it was no -- for no court to question\nthat, was divested jurisdiction at that time. The Guam\nSupreme Court judgment was again final and it had 90\ndays to petition.\nI should say there are other cases.\nEisenberg makes clear that time was not suspended when\nthe court below does not have jurisdiction. The Market\nStreet Railways case makes clear when as a matter of law\nthe lower court no longer can act on the case, the time\nis no longer suspended. And the Jesse Oil case makes\nclear that the party can not rely on a false exercise of\njurisdiction by the lower court.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, in this case if it\nwas not a false exercise in Santos, why was it a false\nexercise here?\nMS. BRINKMANN: It was not a false exercise,\nYour Honor, until October 30 of 2004. At that time\nCongress spoke. And what that --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But it, it, it was still an\nexercise -- it was an exercise in this case of the same\nauthority that it was purporting to exercise in Santos,\nwhich you conceded. And that is the authority to\ndetermine its own jurisdiction. I presume that\njurisdiction is determined on a case by case basis when\na case has already been accepted by the Court, and as\nJustice Ginsburg said is sub judice. So if there was,\nif there was jurisdiction to determine jurisdiction in\nSantos, I don't see why there wasn't likewise\njurisdiction to determine it here.\nMS. BRINKMANN: There was jurisdiction, Your\nHonor. Our position is the same in both of those cases.\nAnd indeed if that issue of jurisdiction had been\nlitigated in this case, Petitioner could have brought a\nwrit to the Ninth Circuit judgment and litigated\njurisdiction in this case. But if the courts ultimately\ndetermined that there was not jurisdiction, it had --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Once the -- once the Ninth\nCircuit determined that it had no longer a continuing\njurisdiction to do anything more than it did, in the\norder that finally dismissed this, the other side wasn't\nbound to litigate that here.\nAll the other side is saying is that up to\nthat point, the court was determining its own\njurisdiction. And therefore it is only when it\ndetermined that its jurisdiction no longer existed, that\nthe filing period began to run.\nSo it seems to me that the crucial question\nis if it could determine its own jurisdiction in Santos\nwhich you concede, why can't it determine its own\njurisdiction here?\nMS. BRINKMANN: It can, Your Honor, but --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Isn't that what it was\ndoing?\nMS. BRINKMANN: Yes, but if it is found\nthere is no jurisdiction, then the party cannot have\nrelied on that to suspend --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Why -- why can't it?\nMS. BRINKMANN: Because this Court's cases\nmake clear, the Wynn, Eisenberg case --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But those -- those -- are\nthey -- and you have got me here. The argument here is\nthat the, that the Ninth Circuit already had taken\njurisdiction in this case. It wasn't a question of\nwhether to accept it or not.\nMS. BRINKMANN: And in those cases, Your\nHonor, the courts also -- appellate courts were\nundoubtedly exercising jurisdiction in those cases. And\nin Eisenberg, for example, it was a request to recall\nthe remittitur. It took months for the California\nSupreme Court to decide that case. And they said yes,\nthere's a standard where you can do that there -- the\ncourt. We find you don't make it, so we don't have\njurisdiction. They came to this Court and said out of\ntime. You had to have sought our review timely, from\nthe final judgment of the California Supreme Court, you\ncould not wait for that period of time in which the\nCalifornia Supreme Court decided to not have\njurisdiction.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I --\nMS. BRINKMANN: That is a well established\nFederal jurisdiction principle.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I guess I'm still at a loss\non the point that for one purpose, the purpose of the\n90-day filing period, you're saying that the Ninth\nCircuit did not have jurisdiction; but for another\npurpose, the determination of whether it had\njurisdiction, you're saying it does have jurisdiction.\nAm I misunderstanding your argument?\nMS. BRINKMANN: I don't believe so. I think\nthat's very common --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I don't see how you can\nhave it both ways.\nMS. BRINKMANN: Well this Court has made\nclear, for example, in the three-judge district court\ncases, that this Court has jurisdiction when an appeal\ncomes before it, to decide whether or not it has\njurisdiction over that appeal. When parties have made\n--\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Maybe I should say I don't\nknow why this Court can have it both ways.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Don't, don't we have to\nchoose one analytical path or the other analytical path?\nMS. BRINKMANN: No, Your Honor, I think it\nrests in this whole idea that courts have to have\njurisdiction to decide jurisdiction. But when you're --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And then when they decide\nthey didn't have jurisdiction, then it's retroactive?\nThat's what your position is?\nMS. BRINKMANN: No.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The Ninth Circuit has\njurisdiction this whole time. But the day that it\nissues its decision dismissing this case, then it is\nretroactive back to the date that Congress passed the\nstatute? That's what you seem to be saying.\nMS. BRINKMANN: The divestiture of the\njurisdiction occurred on the date that Congress's\nstatute went into effect.\nJUSTICE ALITO: What if, what if the Ninth\nCircuit had incorrectly held that it had jurisdiction?\nWould it be the same?\nMS. BRINKMANN: Your Honor, that would have\nbeen the scenario I discussed before, the parties could\nhave litigated that. If it came to this Court, and the\nCourt found there was jurisdiction, so be it. We think\nit would have been a wrong ruling. And if it came to\nthis Court and this Court reversed, that is the scenario\nwe discussed, where in the three-judge district court\nwhen that turns out, the court says we don't have\njurisdiction, you needed to come up through the other\nroute, we will dismiss, vacate and send back and come\nup.\nNow I have to urge on the Court there's a\npurpose for that. In those cases the party is actively\nbelieving and pursuing the view that jurisdiction\nexists. In this case that was not the scenario.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But those cases really\nare not on point. Because there was a vast confusion in\nthe days when there was a three-judge court, do I file a\njurisdictional statement, do I file a cert petition?\nSometimes this Court said we'll treat the jurisdictional\nstatement as a cert petition. But those existed from\nthe beginning. Here there's a case lodged in the Court\nof Appeals, the Court of Appeals had every basis of\njurisdiction. This was no big shakes about it. It\nwasn't, did they file the right paper? And then\nCongress does something. And the Court would follow\nsuit.\nIt just seems to me very strange to say the\ncourt has jurisdiction to decide whether it has\njurisdiction, but if it decides it doesn't, then the\ndate of that order is not the critical date, but you go\nback to the date that Congress passed the law.\nMS. BRINKMANN: Your Honor, I think that\nthis Court addressed this scenario, and one of two\nthings could have happened. As you pointed out during\nPetitioner's argument, it would have been an easy thing\nto file a protective cert position. This Court is well\nfamiliar, has recognized the appropriate of protective\nfilings -- certainly in the Federal habeas situation\nwhere there are mixed petitions and we go back in\nthought, protective filing within the 90-day period\nwould have been appropriate. And I urge, particularly\nbecause Petitioner filed a brief within that period in\nthe Santos case, recognizing that Brunner required that\nthere was a divestiture of Ninth Circuit jurisdiction as\nof the day of the statute enactment.\nEven if there had not been that protective\nfiling, if Petitioner had a colorable jurisdiction\nargument and litigated it, this Court has made clear\nthat once that has been determined adversely, there can\nbe a vacation and remand back to the Guam Supreme Court\nso that judgment can be brought up. I would like to\nturn to the merits if I could, Your Honor.\nWe believe that the well-reasoned opinion of\nthe Guam Supreme Court should be affirmed for three\nreasons. First, the interpretation takes full account\nof the text of the statute. As Justice Kennedy was\nmentioning before, the purpose of this is to have a debt\nlimitation that is based on the property in Guam and the\ntax valuation of that property in Guam. The tax\nvaluation is the valuation of the property that is\nsubject to tax.\nThis is not an original interpretation of\nthis provision. In the Superior Court opinion from 1989\nthat we attached to our brief in opposition, the Guam\nSupreme Court came to the same conclusion and\ninterpretation of this language. We think it is an\neminently reasonable and correct interpretation,\nparticularly in light of the absence of the word as set.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But don't you know\nthat your interpretation reads the word tax out of this\nstatute? I mean your position would be exactly the same\nif it just said 10 percent of the value of the property\nin Guam.\nMS. BRINKMANN: No, Your Honor. That would\ninclude the tax-exempt property. That would be a much\nlarger number.\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's where I'm having\ntrouble on your side. I can't get very far with a\nhistory of other places. Apparently I can't get there.\nTax doesn't seem to help me very much. So I\nthought, well, one thing is clear. What they're trying\nto do here is they take out of the box, if you look at\nit, take all of the list of property that they don't\ntax. I guess a school, maybe some tax exempt business\nor something.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Now their reason for doing\nthat must be that those people who they've exempted\nentirely by statute are not going to be much help in\npaying Guam. Well, if that's true, isn't precisely the\nsame thing true of the two-thirds of the property that\nthey don't take into account when they set their taxes?\nMS. BRINKMANN: No, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Because?\nMS. BRINKMANN: Because that property in\nGuam is still securing this debt to a certain degree.\nIt is property that must be valued for tax purposes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: No. It doesn't secure it\none bit if, in fact, the tax statute says you can't take\nit into account when you set your taxes. Just as is\ntrue of, let's say, a tax free business of some kind.\nNow Guam doesn't have to do that, it could change its\nstatute, but so could it change its statute in respect\nto a school, a university, or whatever the other things\nare that are off those tax rolls. You know that, you\nknow, your answer was circular. That assumes that the\nwhole property is, but it isn't.\nMS. BRINKMANN: Well, Your Honor, as a\nmatter of textual interpretation as to the tax valuation\nof property in Guam, you look at the property in Guam\nand then you have to take the tax valuation. You're\ntaking the property that is subject to tax.\nWe believe that this is the intent of\nCongress also for two reasons, Justice Breyer, that\naddressed your issues before about one suggestion that\nGuam could change this. The purpose of Congress here\nwas to set a meaningful debt limit. That is what real\nvalue appraisal value does. It is an economic\ndetermination of currency fact.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, why why does it do\nany more than the 35 percent value? That sets a\ndefinite limit.\nMS. BRINKMANN: Because that could be\nchanged at the whim of the legislature, Your Honor, and\nthe legislature could change that assessment to increase\nthe debt limit and -- while lowering taxes and altering\nany tax liability.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: With respect to much\nof the tax exempt property, that could be changed by the\nlegislature as well.\nMS. BRINKMANN: But when you're looking to a\nbond debt limitation, you're looking at the bond market,\nyou're looking at investors, the certainty of an\nappraisal value, actual real value, and --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But it doesn't have to be\n100 percent. They could change what you call the tax\nvaluation from 100 percent of the fair value to 150\npercent. There's really much less to this case than\nmeets the eye. I mean, Guam is going to be able to\nfiddle with this thing no matter how you come out.\nMS. BRINKMANN: We don't believe that was\nthe intent of Congress.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, whether it was their\nintent or not, is it not the case that Guam could say\nall property will be valued at 150 percent of its fair\nmarket value and we will then impose a 1 percent real\nestate tax instead of the 2 percent, or instead of the\n1.5 percent we had before?\nMS. BRINKMANN: Yes, they certainly could do\nthat as a matter of fact. We don't believe that should\nalter the debt limitation Congress enacted, and that's\nprecisely why we believe that the Guam Supreme Court\nopinion gives a meaningful interpretation of the purpose\nof Congress and gives a real debt limitation that\nexactly should be affirmed as exactly the purpose that\nCongress intended. And that's why the assessed value\ncan be so easily manipulated, and is not a reasonable\ninterpretation.\nI also would like to address\nJustice Breyer's question about the --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: No, just before you go\nthere, if I were a bond investor, I would much prefer\nissuing bonds if it's the lower value, if it's the\nassessed value. I'm just more secure.\nMS. BRINKMANN: Your Honor, the uncertainty,\nhowever, that the debt limitation is a real limitation\nthat serves the purpose of Congress in order to have\nsome kind of fiscal responsibility to the Territory is\nwhat is furthered by the real limitation of having a\nconcrete appraisal full value as a basis for the\ncalculations.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, you do have a\nconcrete appraisal, but it's just reduced to 35 percent.\nMS. BRINKMANN: But that can be changed at\nthe whim of the legislature without any accountability\nto the voters because at the same time that they change\nthe tax rate and not alter any tax liability.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, you say without any\nresponsibility to the voters. I mean, the voters are\ngoing to know that if the valuation is changed and the\ntax rate isn't, their taxes are going up. So I assume\nthe voters are going to be vigilant to what is going on\nand I assume they have telephones and they'll call their\nrepresentatives. Why is this -- why do you posit this\nsort of failure of representative democracy?\nMS. BRINKMANN: Because I assume the tax\nrate will be changed, so it's not just -- there's no --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But if the tax rate is\nchanged, they're going to call twice.\nMS. BRINKMANN: No. The tax rate will be\nchanged to be lower to maintain the same level, so there\nwould be no -- because the legislature isn't acting to\naddress any tax liability. They're simply asking to\nmanipulate the debt limitation, which is very contrary\nto the purpose and any meaningful message that debt\nlimitation --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But they're going to know\nthis. I mean, they're going to be, if they are\nconcerned at all about it, they'll be in touch with\ntheir representatives.\nMS. BRINKMANN: Your Honor, of course the\nbond issuance here also goes to the Guam legislature and\nthey are held accountable for that in the political\narena. I would suggest, Your Honor, the question\nabout -- I agree with petitioner's counsel about the\ncertainty of determining some of this historical\nmaterial is difficult and not precise. But we have gone\nback and looked at the contemporaneous statutes in each\nof these territorial jurisdictions, and as Mr. Waxman\npointed out, Puerto Rico it turns out actually uses the\nactual value, all of them use the actual value.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Do they tax on the basis\nof the --\nMS. BRINKMANN: Yeah.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: This is a fractional,\nthis 35 percent. In the other places, do they use as\nthe -- the value taxed 100 percent of the property --\nMS. BRINKMANN: Yeah.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- and then just have a\nlower tax rate?\nMS. BRINKMANN: Yes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And what was the\nappraisal practice? I mean, in a lot of these\njurisdictions you have appraised value that turns out to\nbe 30 percent of the actual market value.\nMS. BRINKMANN: But here, in the Virgin\nIslands and Alaska, Federal law requires that the taxes\nbe imposed on the actual value. In the Virgin Islands\nit said your assessment will be actual value. That's\nwhy the term assessment was used in the Virgin Islands\ndebt limitation, because that was in a preexisting\nFederal statute that required assessment be an actual\nvalue.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Which one? You say they've\nall used market values?\nMS. BRINKMANN: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, which of the ones\nthat use it have in fact an assessed value that is a\npercentage of market value?\nMS. BRINKMANN: None.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. Well, that\ndoesn't help us then.\nMS. BRINKMANN: But I think it does further\nthe purpose of what Congress was looking to in both the\nVirgin Islands and Alaska. The requirement for various\nreasons that they impose their tax on the actual value\ncertainly supports the reasonableness of the\ninterpretation here, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, we could look at\nHawaii. In Hawaii they use the word assessed value.\nThey couldn't possibly have wanted it to be market\nvalue, I wouldn't think.\nMS. BRINKMANN: But the actual --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And in the District of\nColumbia -- where are we on this? It's something else\nin D.C. They use assessed value in the Virgin Islands.\nMS. BRINKMANN: The preexisting law in\nHawaii before it became a territory had tax imposed on\nthe actual value, and subsequent to the debt limitation,\nthe territorial law also put it on actual value.\nI would suggest, Your Honor, certainly if\nthere is any debate that there's more than one\ninterpretation of the Organic Act, that deference should\nbe afforded to the Guam Supreme Court's interpretation\nof that. That is well established under this Court.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But doesn't it --\nwho is this provision designed to protect, just the\nGuamanian taxpayers or Federal taxpayers more generally?\nMS. BRINKMANN: It's the Guamanians, Your\nHonor. It is not --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If the Guamanian\ngovernment runs a deficit, where is the difference made\nup from?\nMS. BRINKMANN: Most of the income and\nrevenue on Guam comes from the Federal income tax,\nbecause unlike on the mainland, the Federal income tax\ngoes to the Guam Treasury rather than the United States\nTreasury.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I know that any\ntaxes from Guam are returned to Guam. Are additional\ntax revenues given to Guam other than those that are\nderived from Guam?\nMS. BRINKMANN: Yeah, other financial\nrelationships with the U.S. Government, yes, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So that if the\nGuamanian Treasury runs into difficulty, it's made up\nnot just by Guamanian taxpayers, but by all Federal\ntaxpayers?\nMS. BRINKMANN: No, Your Honor. That's not\nmy understanding of the practice. The encouragement of\nCongress setting up the independent judiciary and\ngovernment of Guam has also included fiscal\nresponsibility, and part of that are the bond issuance\nand the issues that are here before the Court.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I cannot imagine that if a\nterritory of the United States goes belly up, that the\nUnited States is not going to foot the bill. I just\ncan't imagine that.\nMS. BRINKMANN: Your Honor, we believe here\nthat the debt limitation is a matter of local concern.\nIt is the Constitution of Guam. And we are not\nsuggesting that the Court affirm an erroneous\ninterpretation at all. This is a more than reasonable\ninterpretation of a theory, well reasoned opinion by the\nGuam Supreme Court. The Guam Supreme Court has support,\nit's 17-year old superior court opinion that had reached\nthe same conclusion. That was the only law out there\nthat Guamanians had looked to for the interpretation of\nthose provisions of the Organic Act. It predated the\n1993 appraisal. And it took that opinion and did not\nsimply adopt it, but went through and did a very\ndetailed analysis of the test of the statute of the\nOrganic Act, the fact that it did not include the word\nassessed, which was used 10 months later by Congress in\nthe Virgin Islands.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Miss Brinkmann, just to\nfollow up on Justice Scalia's question, is there any\nhistory of the Federal government having to bail out the\nGuam government for bankruptcy or anything close to\nthat?\nMS. BRINKMANN: No, Your Honor, none\nwhatsoever.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And is there anything in\nthe record that tells us what kind of a credit rating\nGuam has?\nMS. BRINKMANN: No, Your Honor, I don't\nbelieve it does.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Did this value issue -- I\nmean, was the borrowing effective given the controversy\nbetween, the attorney general refused to sign, did that\nhave any consequences for whether this bond issue went\nthrough?\nMS. BRINKMANN: Absolutely, Your Honor.\nBecause of Petitioner's delay for more than a year and a\nhalf in a court that did not have jurisdiction, these\nbonds still have not been able to issue. And Petitioner\nresponded no. As a practical matter, the bond market\nwill not support issuance of these bonds until attempts\nto undermine their validity have been brought to an end.\nAnd so the Guam government has been doing different\nmeans of financing in a positive manner. The economy of\nGuam has returned because of many of the devastating\nworld events have taken, have passed in time, and the\neconomy is recovering. The U.S. military is returning\nwith a very large presence there. But they are still,\nmy understanding, approximately two years behind in\ngetting back tax returns.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: In that case, you should\nwant us to exercise jurisdiction, decide it one way or\nthe other.\nMS. BRINKMANN: Your Honor, we believe that\nit should be dismissed for want of jurisdiction, the\nGuam Supreme Court opinion stands, and we prevail under\nthat ruling, the Guam Supreme Court's interpretation of\nSection 11 of the Organic Act.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Could you tell me whether\nthe rate of tax is uniform throughout Guam? The rate of\nreal estate tax. Is it an island-wide tax or is it\nlocal, county?\nMS. BRINKMANN: It is an island-wide tax,\nYour Honor. Land is taxed at one-quarter of 1 percent\nand improvements are taxed at 1 percent.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't know why you just\ndidn't raise your assessed value from 30 percent to 100\npercent and reduce the rate of tax accordingly.\nMS. BRINKMANN: We don't believe that\nCongress intended to inject itself into the workings of\nthis local territorial tax mechanism. The various\npolicies --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But you still have the\noption, and I'm just dying to ask the question not\nhaving anything to do with the case. Why did they do\nthis? Why did they have -- was it just to make\neverybody feel good and they think they're ripping off\nthe government because they're getting only a 35 percent\nvalue, even though everybody knows they'll just raise\nthe rate if it changes?\nMS. BRINKMANN: That is exactly the kind of\npolicy decision that the local governing authority makes\nabout taxes. Actually the Petitioner has a footnote\nexplaining the origin of fractional tax valuation.\nIndeed, it seems to be consistent with some of the\nhistory also that we've seen that there would be\ninformal adjustments of valuations to take into account\nperhaps poverty, or to take into account less\nmeritorious justifications. And the -- because of the\nperception or, I believe petitioner calls it the\npolitical psychology perhaps, of having such a high\nrate, that is a policy decision that different taxing\nauthorities make.\nIt should not mean that Guam surrenders\ntwo-thirds of its debt limitation. Congress did not use\nthe word assessed and it's a very difficult argument to\nadopt that by failing to use assessed, they limited it\nto an assessed value that surrendered two-thirds of the\nGuam territorial debt limitation contrary to all --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yeah, but you talked\nabout this as the deference we owe to the Guam Supreme\nCourt. This is a Federal statute, right? This was\npassed by Congress.\nMS. BRINKMANN: Yes, Your Honor, and in the\nSanta Fe case versus Friday, with all due respect,\nPetitioner is incorrect that that addressed territorial\nlaws. That was a provision in the New Mexico Organic\nAct that fed up the jurisdiction of district courts that\nCongress created in New Mexico. There was a provision\nin that Organic Act provision of New Mexico that said\nthe jurisdiction of those courts was as limited as law.\nThat passage was interepreted in this Court\nin Friday looking at another Federal statute and some\nterritorial laws. I would direct the Court to the\nbriefs in the case, that opinion itself was quite brief,\nand when you look at the explications of the party, it\nsimply reinforces that the Court there was construing an\norganic act, a Federal statue, and local territorial\nstatutes, and there directly said that they should defer\nto the local understanding of the courts unless it is\nclearly wrong. So we urge that that, too, should be --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Does that apply to\nall the provisions of the Organic Act? I mean, there\nare provisions there addressing the jurisdictional issue\nthat we are considering here as well. Do we defer to\nthe Guam Supreme Court's view on that?\nMS. BRINKMANN: Your Honor, I see my time is\nup, but if you'd like me to respond?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's fine.\nMS. BRINKMANN: I think that you could look\nto your area of administrative deference, for example,\nunder Chevron, where you do also defer to the authority\nof an agency, the interpretation of an agency. The\ndetermination of its own authority the Court has upheld.\nThank you, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Ms.\nBrinkmann.\nMr. Waxman, we'll give you 3 minutes.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN\nON BEHALF OF PETITIONER\nMR. WAXMAN: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nI want to direct the Court -- in response to\ntwo questions that were asked of Ms. Brinkmann, I want\nto direct the court to two pages of the Guam Supreme\nCourt's opinion, and I'm going to summarize them for you\nnow, but for purposes of what's the difference between\nin terms of bond holders, the fact that certain property\nisn't taxed at all and certain property is only taxed at\n35 percent, what's important to note here, and that is\nreflected at page 26a of the petition appendix, the tax\nroll on Guam includes a valuation of all nontaxable\nproperty. The Guam Supreme Court then has to go back\nand say, well, of this approximately 183 million is\nexempt. So in Guam, the tax assessor and the Guam\ncourts are treating property that is wholly exempt from\ntaxation the same way that it treats the two-thirds of\nfair market value that is exempt from application of the\ntax rate.\nSecondly, in response to Justice Kennedy's\nquestions about why are we focusing -- why wouldn't bond\nholders focus on assessed valuation rather than the rest\nand what difference does all of this make, page 18a of\nthe joint appendix, which is footnote 8 of the Guam\nSupreme Court's opinion, which comes in the -- the\nportion of the opinion where the court says, look, \"tax\"\nhas to mean something; we think it means taxable\nproperty, not tax valuation.\nThe Guam Supreme Court in its opinion in\nfootnote 8, quoting from some language from a dissenting\nopinion in the Hawaii Supreme Court, says as follows,\nand I'm quoting from footnote 8: \"It has been argued\nthat the use of a percentage of assessed value as a\nmeasure of the State debt limit is without\nsignificance,\" now skipping the rest of the sentence.\n\"The people that buy the bonds are interested in the\nratio of your debt to your assessed value because, while\nall of the tax revenues of the State or the counties\nnaturally are available for the payment of the debt,\nit's been customary for bond holders to look to the real\nproperty tax as their collateral.\"\nThat is the authority on which the Guam\nSupreme Court relied and it applies to this case and it\nexplain why the word \"assessed\" and the word \"taxable\"\nhave been construed synonymously and interchangeably in\nthe legislative history of these territorial statutes\nand why assessed value is understood to be usually\nfractional value for reasons of political psychology\nthat Ms. Brinkmann addressed, but even where it's full\nvalue, it is only pursuant to a determination that for\nassessment purposes full value should be used.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
