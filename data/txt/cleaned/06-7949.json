        "content": "(10:03 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument\nfirst today in Case 06-7949, Gall v. United States.\nMr. Green.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY T. GREEN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. GREEN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nWhen Judge Robert W. Pratt of the Southern\nDistrict of Iowa sentenced Brian Michael Gall on May 27,\n2005, he found Mr. Gall to be an individual who had\nfully rehabilitated himself by having voluntarily\nwithdrawn from a conspiracy five years earlier, by\nremaining crime-free throughout that period, by having\nrid himself of his addictions, by having graduated from\ncollege, by having learned a trade, by having built a\nsuccessful and thriving business.\nJudge Pratt carefully weighed the Section\n3553(a) factors and in a ten-page sentencing memorandum\nset forth cogent reasons why a sentence of probation\nwould better fit the purposes and factors specified in\nSection 3553(a) than a sentence of incarceration.\nThe Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed\nthat judgment on the basis of the extraordinary\ncircumstances test that we would ask the Court to\noverturn today.\nThe Eighth Circuit substituted its judgment\nfor that of Judge Pratt, saying that Judge Pratt had\nplaced too much weight on Mr. Gall's voluntary\nwithdrawal from the conspiracy and in so doing had not\nsatisfied or overcome the extraordinariness barrier.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: If it had been the other\nway around and the district court had said what\nappellate court said and the appellate court had said\nwhat the district court said, what would you be arguing?\nMR. GREEN: Certainly, Justice Kennedy, I\nwould probably be arguing something of the reverse.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. GREEN: It is -- it is an abuse of\ndiscretion --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, you can see the\nsystemic concern. I mean, it's just not always going to\nbe the case that the district judge is the one to give\nmore leniency.\nMR. GREEN: Yes, that's certainly true, but\nin this instance an abuse of discretion standard\napplies.\nJUSTICE ALITO: I thought it was your\nargument that if any rational judge could impose the\nsentence that's imposed, then that sentence has to be\nsustained. So you're saying that either the district\ncourt or the Eighth Circuit here was irrational?\nMR. GREEN: No. I wouldn't say -- well, let\nme -- the district court was certainly not irrational in\nour view.\nJUSTICE ALITO: No. But in answer to\nJustice Kennedy's question, you hesitated in saying\nthat, if the district court had taken the approach of\nthe court of appeals, that would also have to be\nsustained. But under your analysis wouldn't it have to\nbe unless you're going to argue --\nMR. GREEN: Yes.\nJUSTICE ALITO: -- that that approach is\nirrational?\nMR. GREEN: It would have to be. I\nhesitated because there -- there might be instances in\nwhich, as indeed the government admits in its brief,\nthat the reasons and the facts and circumstances don't\nlogically cohere with the sentence that's given.\nIn other words, if all of the circumstances\nand facts point a certain way -- in this instance, for\nexample, they point to a downward departure -- and\nsuddenly the judge goes up to the statutory max, that\nmight be an instance in which a court of appeals could\nsay no reasonable judge would have imposed that\nsentence. There doesn't seem to be a reason for doing\nso.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What about the Eighth\nCircuit, laying aside the extraordinary circumstances\ntest, saying the judge, the sentencing judge gave credit\nfor his leaving the conspiracy, but he didn't blow the\nwhistle, so the conspiracy continued. He could have\nstopped the conspiracy.\nAnd, similarly, yes, he rehabilitated\nhimself, but he earned some 30 to $40,000 in the drug\nbusiness, and that aided his rehabilitation, and maybe\nthere's some kind of obligation to pay back.\nSo could a court of appeals try to instruct\ndistrict judges and say: Now, in this factor, leaving a\nconspiracy, we want district judges to be aware of the\ndifference between one who leaves and blows the whistle\nand one who lets it continue; and, similarly, one who\nuses the ill-gotten gains to set himself up in business.\nMR. GREEN: Justice Ginsburg, when someone\nleaves the conspiracy and blows the whistle, typically,\nthat individual is not charged. The Department of\nJustice, for example, in its Antitrust Division says\nthat if a corporation or individual comes to it and\nblows the whistle on, say, a price-fixing conspiracy,\nthat individual is never charged to begin with.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I'm sure\nthat's not always true. I mean, if the leader of some\nvast conspiracy is the one who blows the whistle, I\nsuspect he may well be charged anyway.\nMR. GREEN: That's true, Your Honor. There\nare instances in which --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Lex Luthor might.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. GREEN: Yes, but the point is that\nblowing the whistle is -- is not only a voluntary\nwithdrawal, but also something so far beyond the bounds\nof what prosecutors typically see that that individual,\ntypically or generally is the individual that receives\nimmunity or amnesty in the case.\nTo respond to the second part of your\nquestion, with respect to the amount of money that\nMr. Gall made, he did not use it, and there's no\ninformation in the record that indicates that he built\nhis business on the basis of the use of that money.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: There is no indication\nthat he gave it back, or there was no fine attached to\nit.\nMR. GREEN: No, there was not, and in part\nbecause, as the sealed volume of the appendix\ndemonstrates, Mr. Gall did not at that point have money\nto pay a fine.\nRemember that he was -- he left the\nconspiracy in September of 2000. He was not approached\nby agents until late 2003. He was not charged until\n2004 and was not sentenced until 2005.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you don't -- you\ndon't have to answer all of these things for your case,\ndo you?\nMR. GREEN: No.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You're not saying that a\nreasonable person couldn't have found the opposite.\nYou're just saying that a reasonable person could have\nfound what this district judge found.\nMR. GREEN: That's exactly right, Justice\nScalia.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So why don't you just\nswallow all these things and say, yeah, I suppose the\ncourt of appeals could say that, but --\nMR. GREEN: I -- I --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- but my point stands?\nMR. GREEN: Yeah, well, I'm happy to swallow\nin that sense.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. GREEN: There's no doubt about the fact\n--\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well then, what's\nleft of the appellate review? I mean, under your theory\nis there any substantive review for the appellate court\nor is it all just procedural under -- putting aside your\nlogical coherence point, which --\nMR. GREEN: There is -- there isn't much\nleft besides the fact that it is abuse of discretion\nreview. That there is no robust substantive component\nto -- to reasonableness review of sentences, is really a\ncomplaint about abuse of discretion review.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And that's the problem.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: In a typical abuse\nof discretion review, you still have -- for example, if\nyou have a judge in -- well, let's say you have a judge;\nin one case he says because this is a -- a young\ndefendant, I'm going to give him a lighter sentence; and\nin the next case says, you know, I don't think age is a\nfactor that I should consider in the case; in the next\ncase he says it is and then not. Each -- all of those\ncases, I take it, are upheld under your view on\nappellate review.\nMR. GREEN: Not necessarily. I think if --\nif a judge --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So there can be\nsubstantive review for consideration of age?\nMR. GREEN: Not necessarily for\nconsideration of age, but a court of appeals could say\nto -- to such a judge -- and I am sure that one of the\nparties would point this out, would say you considered\nit last time; you didn't consider it. You've been\nseesawing back and forth on this. The court of appeals\ncould say --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay, so at the same\ntime --\nMR. GREEN: -- explain why --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But if you have two\ndistrict judges in the same courthouse and the one says,\nwhen I have a young defendant I always -- I forget\nwhether the term is \"vary\" or \"depart\" -- but I always\ngo down, and the next judge says, I never consider age.\nThose -- both of those are upheld under your view, I\ntake it?\nMR. GREEN: Yes, both -- both would be\nupheld.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Now, why --\nMR GREEN: If somebody said --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Why wouldn't the judge in,\nas it were, the second case give some consideration, be\nrequired under abuse review to give some consideration,\nto what is sort of the norm in that circuit so that he\ndoesn't stand out as either a \"let-them-loose\" judge or\na hanging judge? Doesn't abuse of discretion at least\nrequire a broader view than simply the -- literally the\ncase before the court?\nMR. GREEN: Well, it does require a broader\nview, and certainly a judge could --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And wouldn't there be at\nleast under the Chief Justices's hypothetical, wouldn't\nthere be a possibility of looking to those other cases\nrather than just automatically affirming on -- on abuse\nreview?\nMR. GREEN: There would be.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.\nMR. GREEN: And I was about to add --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Would the judge have to\nconsider the cases from the judge's district or from the\ncircuit or from the whole country?\nMR. GREEN: I would -- I would imagine a\njudge would want to look at -- at cases from the whole\ncountry.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Isn't that exactly\n--\nMR. GREEN: Certainly they have --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Isn't that exactly\nwhat the Sentencing Commission did in establishing the\nGuidelines?\nMR. GREEN: It did in establishing the\nGuidelines. There are disputes about whether the\ncommissioners actually modified the guidelines on the\nbasis of what judges have actually done.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It looked at them. It\ndidn't necessarily follow them.\nMR. GREEN: Exactly.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: With white collar crime,\nfor example, it went vastly higher than what had been\nthe practice.\nMR. GREEN: That's -- that's exactly right,\nJustice Scalia. So there is a component to this in\nwhich a judge might want to look through legal database,\nfor example, or even a blog or something like that, and\nlook and see --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Going back to the Chief\nJustice's hypothetical and the colloquy you had with him\nwith the hypothetical, the two different judges in the\nstatement district or the same circuit that treat age\ndifferently, if the Congress saw that would the Congress\nbe able to say anything about that, do anything about\nthat to stop the disparity?\nMR. GREEN: Certainly.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Consistently with the\nSixth Amendment?\nMR. GREEN: Certainly. And one of our\nresponses, Justice Kennedy, to the issue of there not\nbeing a robust component of substantiveness -- or --\nexcuse me -- of substantive review of sentences if that\nCongress can fix that.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: How?\nMR. GREEN: If the unwarranted --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: How can it fix the --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: One question. Why\ncouldn't, if there is some kind of substantive standard\nof reasonableness, why couldn't a court of appeals in a\nparticular circuit say that -- if one judge relies on\nage, 19, and the other judges do not, why couldn't the\ncourt of appeals say that one of those two positions is\nunreasonable?\nMR. GREEN: A court of appeals could, yes, I\nthink it could that. They could ask an explanation.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: There could be a common --\nsort of a common law of reasonableness developed through\nthe public process?\nMR. GREEN: I think that's correct. A\ncommon law --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And another circuit would\ndevelop the opposite. I mean, this circuit would say\nthat 17 is unreasonable. The other circuit would say\nthat 19 is unreasonable. And we would have to sort out\nall those things ultimately, right?\nMR. GREEN: That's -- that's correct Your\nHonor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: In kind of a sentencing\nreview court?\nMR. GREEN: Yes. Yes, and that is -- that\nis one danger of the extraordinary circumstances test.\nIn fact, there's two dangers in that --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Could Congress pass a\nstatute that says age is not relevant in sentencing\nexcept in extraordinary circumstances? Would that be a\nviolation of the Sixth Amendment?\nMR. GREEN: I believe that Congress could\npass such a statute, yes. But -- but -- I hesitate to\nadd that, to the extent that there is a constitutional\ngrounding for individualized sentencing and age is a key\nfactor with respect to individualized sentencing, I -- I\nwant to hesitate and I want to waver. I'm not sure --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But you said -- you said\nbefore that, and very definitely, that Congress could\nfix the case of where one judge said, I'm always lenient\non 17-year-olds and the other said, I throw the book at\nhim. You said yes, Congress could fix that. Well, how\nother than in the way that Justice Alito just proposed?\nMR. GREEN: Well, in response to that\nquestion and your earlier question, Justice Ginsburg,\ncertainly Congress could, to fix the entire problem\nhere, could adopt the solution that we proposed in\nBooker and in Fanfan that to say that -- that in order\nto enhance a sentence at all, that has -- it has to be a\nfact found by the jury, what's so-called Blakelyizing of\nthe Guidelines. That's one way to do it.\nCongress could also, as has been suggested\nand I believe legislation has been introduced on this,\nthey could make the Guidelines essentially topless, so\nthat there -- so that there was complete --\nJUSTICE ALITO: If Congress can pass a\nstatute without violating the Sixth Amendment saying age\nis ordinarily not relevant, then could Congress delegate\nto an expert agency the authority to make that decision\nwithout violating the Sixth Amendment?\nMR. GREEN: No, I don't think that it could.\nAny time Congress --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Based on what? Why could it\n-- why can't it delegate the authority if it can do it\nitself?\nMR. GREEN: Well, it could delegate the\nauthority. There's no doubt about it. And this Court\nhas said it's all right for Congress to delegate the\nauthority to the commission. But the problem, Justice\nAlito, comes whenever we limit the statutory continuum\nfrom zero to the statutory maximum sentence, if we\noverlay a consideration. If on the extraordinary\ncircumstances test we make the Guidelines the benchmark\nand we tether or we measure from the Guidelines, we have\nthen set a kind of statutory range.\nIf Congress says to a commission, we want\nyou to develop a kind of mini-guideline based upon age,\nwe think that there might be departure in some\ncircumstances but not other circumstances, that might be\nan instance where we are setting a kind of ceiling and a\nfloor and a range within the otherwise broader statutory\ncontinuum. That's --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Green, I\nunderstood you to respond to Justice Souter's question\nthat courts of appeals could consider a broader range of\ncases in deciding whether it's an abuse of discretion in\na particular case.\nMR. GREEN: Certainly.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Now, if they can\nconsider a broader range of cases, what's so bad about\nsuggesting that if a particular case is way out of what\ntheir broad review shows, if the broad review shows that\nin most cases this type of defendant gets 5 years and in\nthis particular case, the judge gave him 30 years or\ngave him zero, what's wrong with suggesting that that is\na factor they should at least start with in saying\nsomething's unusual about this case, we ought to take\ncloser look?\nMR. GREEN: In that instance, though, we run\ninto the problem that Justice Scalia identified and that\nproblem is we start to get limitations based upon\ncertain factors, and the courts of appeals --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well then, what's\nthe point of looking at the broad range of cases if they\ncan't do anything about it?\nMR. GREEN: To see whether -- the point is\nto see whether or not the reasons that are offered in\nthose cases turn out to be valid, cogent --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So is it right to\nsay if the broad range shows that most of these\ndefendants get a sentence of 10 years in jail and in\nthis case the person got probation, that the court\nshould look for some reasons to explain what the\ndifference, to justify the difference?\nMR. GREEN: Certainly the court should look\nat the reasons and should look to see whether or not the\nreasons are rationally grounded in Section 3553(a). But\nour position is once they are, that's -- that's the end\nof the matter.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Of course, all these\nquestions only -- only apply to departures downward from\nthe Guidelines, and if you ask the same question with\nregard to departures upward you do run into\nconstitutional problems when the -- when courts of\nappeals begin to establish certain facts that have to be\nfound in order to move upward or -- yes, certain facts\nthat justify moving upward.\nSo you end up with a quite skewered system\nin which there is -- there is vigorous hearty review of\ndepartures downward, but -- but very, very slight review\nof departures upward.\nMR. GREEN: That -- that's correct, and\nthat's essentially the kind of system that we've got\nnow. This is not a fulsome abuse of discretion review\nthroughout the range of sentencing.\nWhat we have now is a -- on this\nextraordinary circumstances test is a -- and this case\nis a perfect example of substitution of judgment.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What in your view would\nbe -- would fail the abuse of discretion test? If we\nhave a sentence of -- what was the guideline range?\nMR. GREEN: 30 to 37 months, Justice\nGinsburg.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And the judge gives no\nprison time, three years probation. What would it take\nto be -- describe what an abuse of discretion would be?\nMR. GREEN: Well, there are a couple of\nexamples out there. One, this case Poynter out of, out\nof the Sixth Circuit, where the judge went all the way\nup to the absolute statutory max in a child\npornography -- or rather, a child molestation case, on\nthe ground that, first, the statutory max will take care\nof any unwarranted disparity. That's not -- that's not\nreally a cogent reason and that would be an abuse of\ndiscretion.\nWe have another case out of the -- recently\nout of the Eleventh Circuit, Valdes, in which -- in\nwhich the court departed upwards on the ground of the\nfact that the check that had been written that -- the\nfraudulent check that had been written, had been written\nto the district court. And so the court was angry that\nits own court had been -- or the neighboring court had\nbeen duped.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You think that's\nunreasonable?\nMR. GREEN: I do think that's unreasonable,\nYour Honor. I'll go that far. I'll admit that much.\nCertainly that's not like the famous Yankees and Red Sox\nexample. That's not rationally grounded in Section\n3553(a) factors.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask, we've been\ntalking about a lot of hypotheticals. Is there any\ndispute, any claim that any of the facts on which the\ndistrict judge relied in this case were improper --\nMR. GREEN: No.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- that they were out of\nharmony with what's done throughout the country?\nMR. GREEN: No, none whatsoever, Your Honor.\nIn fact, we pointed at the end of our merits brief, page\n35 and 36, we point to other cases where courts have\ngiven lenient sentences because of a voluntary\nrehabilitative effort by the defendant. And the Eighth\nCircuit Court of Appeals said in no way -- or indicated\nin no way did Judge Pratt rely on improper factors in\ndeciding the sentence. It had a complaint about his\nreliance on age, but really that was a --\nJUSTICE BREYER: What in your opinion is\nsupposed to happen if we have Guidelines, a part of\n3553(a), a part of it -- voluntary or not, they're\nreferred to, so -- and I understand how you would deal\nwith this. If the district judge's sentence rests upon\nhis view of the facts, the appeals court is supposed to\nsay it's the district judge that counts here.\nMR. GREEN: That's right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I can understand if it's a\nquestion of judgment, a matter of judgment about this\ncase the court of appeals is supposed to say: District\njudge, it's your view that matters here.\nNow, the difficult matter is, suppose that\nthis district judge says: I don't approve of the way\nGuidelines treat a certain class of people and I am\ngoing to have a different sentence because I don't like\nwhat they do. And now there are several situations:\none, different from his fellow judges in the same court;\ntwo, different from other judges across the country;\nthree, different from what the Guidelines did initially;\nfour, different from what the Guidelines say after the\ncommission has over and over and over reconsidered the\nsame matter.\nAll right, that I find difficult and I'd\nlike your view.\nMR. GREEN: I would find such an absolute\npolicy disagreement difficult as well, Justice Breyer.\nAnd the reason why it's difficult is because it is not\nsentencing in accordance with Section 3553(a). Section\n3553(a) requires consideration of the individual\ncharacteristics of the defendant and the facts and\ncircumstances surrounding the crime.\nIn Koon, this Court --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Wait, wait, wait, wait.\nI think what you're saying is that -- which\nis the subject of the next case, really --\nMR. GREEN: Exactly.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But I want to know your\nview of it. Too. I want to know your view of it, too,\nbecause what I want to figure out here by the end of\ntoday is what are the words that should be written in\nyour opinion by this Court that will lead to\nconsiderable discretion on part of the district judge\nbut not totally, not to the point where the uniformity\ngoal is easily destroyed.\nThat's what I'm asking your view on, and I'd\nlike your view and the SG's view and everyone else who's\narguing today.\nMR. GREEN: The words should be these with\nrespect to policy judgments: The district court may\nconsider policy disagreements with the Sentencing\nGuidelines or may disagree with the policies stated in\nthe Sentencing Guidelines or underlying those\nGuidelines, as long as that disagreement is rationally\nor reasonably grounded in the facts of the case, that it\nfits the circumstances of the case.\nAnd in so doing --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. You're saying\nthey can't disagree with the policy. They can only --\nonly say there are special facts in this case that were\nnot taken into account in the policy. But you're saying\nthey are bound by the policy set forth in the\nGuidelines. That's not my understanding of either\nApprendi or Booker.\nMR. GREEN: Yes and no. The yes part is --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Which yes and which no?\nMR. GREEN: Okay. The yes -- the yes part\nis that -- that it is in accordance with the -- the\nmajority opinion in Rita and other cases, there is an\ninvitation to district courts to reconsider if they\nfind -- if they so find it necessary, the facts -- or\nrather, excuse me, the policies as articulated in the\nSentencing Guidelines. They are free to do that.\nBut under Section 3553(a), Justice Scalia,\nthat has to be rationally grounded in the case before\nthem. This --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It has to be relevant to\nthe case, Of course.\nMR. GREEN: Certainly.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Of course.\nMR. GREEN: Relevance and rational --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't know what you mean\nby rationally grounded in the case before them. Let's\ntake the question of whether you should give higher\nsentences for crack cocaine than for powder cocaine.\nWhy can't the district court simply disagree with the\nfact that the Guidelines said you should give a 100\ntimes more for the one than for the other? Why can't\nthe district court just say, that seems to me a very\nerroneous judgment by -- by the Sentencing Commission?\nMR. GREEN: If the district court applied\nthat as a policy across all cases that come before it\ninvolving crack or powder cocaine, Justice Scalia, that\nis an abdication of the district court's duty under\nSection 3553(a). And under this Court's opinion --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I see. It must follow the\nGuidelines,\nMR. GREEN: No, no, I'm not, I'm not saying\nthat.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It just has to consider\nthem. It did consider them and said: I disagree with\nthat judgment of the Guidelines.\nMR. GREEN: Yes, it has to -- it does not\nhave to follow the Guidelines and it can disagree, but\nit has to tie that disagreement to the facts of the\ncase.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: This case involves cocaine.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: You're saying -- you're\nsaying two things. You're saying it's got to follow the\nGuidelines -- it can depart from the Guidelines, but\nit's got to do so based on the facts of this case or in\nsome way relevant to the facts of this case. And when\nyou put that latter criterion in there, what you're\nsaying, and I think this was Justice Scalia's concern,\nyou're really saying you've got to find that this case\nis somehow an outlier to the broad range of cases so\nthat the policy does not fit. And that's a different\nthing from a general disagreement with the policy\nitself.\nIsn't that what you are saying?\nMR. GREEN: No, because I don't think a\ndistrict judge would have to find that the case was\nsomehow an outlier.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Then what is it in the\nfacts of this case that is crucial to the appropriate\ndetermination?\nMR. GREEN: Well, the facts of a case where\nthere's a disagreement with a policy might be, for\nexample, the policy might be -- let's take embezzlement\nbecause I don't want to tread on my colleague's\nargument. Let's take embezzlement --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Maybe you could take age.\nWhat is there about the age of this defendant? He was a\n21-year-old college student? Now maybe age is generally\na factor that should be considered as a basis for\nleniency. Maybe it's not. But it's a policy question.\nWhat is there about the facts of this case that -- that\nchanges that?\nMR. GREEN: Age is a good example. Justice\n-- or, excuse me -- Judge Pratt in his sentencing\nmemorandum, said -- cited studies that show that young\npeople's risk inhibition behavior is not quite as well\ndeveloped as people later on, and that recidivism drops\nremarkably as you move forward into your 20s.\nNow, he did not rely on that argument in\norder to impose the sentence he did. He used that as a\ncontrast to say this where is Brian Gall was when he was\na member of this conspiracy and look at where he has\ngotten to, having fully rehabilitated himself.\nSo that is a means by which a judge can say,\nyou know, the policy of the Guidelines may be that age\nshould be a discouraged factor, but it could be relevant\nin cases.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Sure. But if the reasoning\nthat you just articulated is reasoning that should be\naccepted, it's reasoning that should be accepted in\nevery case. And it -- i.e., the mind is less -- the\nbrain is less developed in the case of everyone under a\ncertain age.\nAnd that amounts, in effect, to a rejection\nof the policy for a certain swath of individuals,\nrelatively young individuals, for whom the judge is\nsaying age is relevant, the policy says age is not.\nThat's rejection of the policy.\nMR. GREEN: But not necessarily, because a\ndistrict judge who is looking the defendant in the eye,\nand is the best placed judicial actor to make that\ndecision, may say I see a 21-year-old in front of me who\nis uniquely mature. That is a -- that is a\nquintessential multifarious, pleading, narrow, shifting\nfact; the district judge may make the decision.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: You're saying that if a\njudge disagrees as a general matter of policy, once in a\nwhile he could make an exception to his disagreement.\nBut it's still, it seems to me, on your reasoning, that\nhe has rejected the policy with respect to a certain\nclass of defendant.\nMR. GREEN: Well, he -- he may have rejected\nit -- if -- I wouldn't even -- dare say that in a\nmultiplicity of cases. He may have rejected it in this\nparticular case and said, I see a defendant in front of\nme who is immature, as mature as the other defendants,\nand this study backs me up.\nAnd I'd like to reserve the reminder of my\ntime for rebuttal.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll give you\nrebuttal time, Mr. Green, but I just have one question.\nI think we've gotten off the track a little\nbit. The question presented is about the extraordinary\ncircumstances test and proportionality review. We've\nbeen talking a lot about what district court judges can\ndo. What's wrong with, whatever you want to call it,\nsaying if something is out of the norm, you ought to\nhave some good reason for being out of the norm?\nMR. GREEN: I --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's the only\nquestion presented in this case.\nMR. GREEN: Because it -- because it sets a\npresumptive sentence and that presumptive sentence is\nexactly like -- is the Guideline sentence. And it says\nto the district court: You must overcome a presumption\nagainst a sentence that is some unspecified distance\nfrom -- from the Guidelines. We don't know because we\ncan't estimate exactly how far it's from.\nBut what happens, and what will quickly\nhappen, is that there's going to be a kind of -- maybe\nin the Eighth Circuit it's one standard deviation; maybe\nin the Second Circuit it's two standard deviations. But\npretty soon we are going to have a kind of Guidelines\nwith a penumbra beyond which you can't go.\nIt is, as was indicated in the Rita opinion,\na presumption of unreasonableness. It says to the\ndistrict court, you're making a risk if you go outside\nthe Guidelines.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Green.\nMR. GREEN: Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Dreeben.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN,\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. DREEBEN: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nAppellate courts confronted with the task of\nconducting reasonableness review need some benchmarks\nfor how to distinguish between sentences that are\noutside the Guidelines and reasonable and sentences that\nare outside the Guidelines and are not.\nThe question presented here is whether an\nappellate court can reasonably decide that it should\ntake a harder look at a case that is significantly or\nextraordinarily outside the Guidelines and look to see\nwhether that sentence is supported by --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Excuse me, may I ask this\nquestion because it comes up throughout your brief, and\nyou've used percentages to decide when a case is\nsufficiently outside the Guidelines to justify a special\nhard look. You used the term \"dramatically\" in your\nbrief. At what percentage point is the threshold that\nthis standard of review kicks in?\nMR. DREEBEN: Justice Stevens, we don't have\na fixed percentage. We don't endorse that kind of\nanalysis.\nI think that the appropriate way to look at\nit is to see all different factors converging in order\nto determine whether it warrants this harder look. It\ncould be a different type of sentence. Here you have a\nprobation sentence as opposed to a prison sentence when\nthe Guidelines call for up to three years of\nimprisonment.\nIt could be couched in the number of levels\nthat the judge has --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: So you do not rely on a\npercentage as kind of the magic basic test?\nMR. DREEBEN: I don't. But I would say --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I think some of the courts\nof appeals seem to.\nMR. DREEBEN: The courts of appeals have\ngenerally relied on a \"I know it when I see it\" kind of\napproach, which I think is reasonable in this area of\nthe law, because you see sentences that are simply out\nof kilter with what the Guidelines range is, and it\nraises a question in the court's mind, why?\nIf you saw a judge who said the Guidelines\nrange here is 30 to 37 months for petitioner and I'm\ngoing to sentence him to 24 months and the judge gives\nthe same reasons as he gave here, no court of appeals is\ngoing to think this requires a particularly hard look or\nany greater justification than what the judge did. The\ncourt will understand that that's what abuse of\ndiscretion review means in an advisory system.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What if -- what if the\nsentencing judge simply disagrees with the Guidelines?\nHe just simply disagrees with the severity of the\nsentence that the Guidelines impose? He's free to do\nthat, isn't he?\nMR. DREEBEN: He is, Justice Scalia.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And so long as that\ndisagreement is reasonable, so long as another\nsentencing commission might indeed have imposed a lower\nsentence -- for antitrust violations, if indeed all the\nFederal Courts before -- before the Guidelines came into\neffect were rarely imposing any prison sentences, how\ncould you say it would be unreasonable for a district\njudge to say, I simply agrees with what the\nGuidelines -- with what the Sentencing Commission did,\nand I agree with all of those sentencing courts before\nthen, which thought -- which thought only in a rare case\nshould there be jail time? How could you possibly say\nthat that's unreasonable?\nMR. DREEBEN: Because, Justice Scalia, I\nstart with a fundamentally different concept of\nreasonableness review than merely is it possible to\narticulate a reasoned basis for sentencing the defendant\nthat way.\nI start with the proposition that this Court\nadopted reasonableness review in Booker as a means of\nhelping to achieve Congress's objective of increased\nuniformity without attempting to attain the degree of\nuniformity that had prevailed under the mandatory --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But we also made it very\nclear that the Guidelines are advisory, and there is --\nthere is no way to a maintain that with the -- with the\nkind of approach that you're offering. They aren't\nadvisory. They're pretty much mandatory. You depart\ntoo much and you'll be called to account.\nMR. DREEBEN: I think there's a difference,\nJustice Scalia, from saying that the Guidelines are\nadvisory and therefore a court can give a different\nsentence than what the Guidelines call for, and saying\nthat basically advisory guidelines means the judge can\ndo whatever policy judgment the judge wants, without\nregard to what degree of variance you achieve. From --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You cannot disagree on\npolicy with the Guidelines, then, at least not\nfundamentally?\nMR. DREEBEN: No, you can disagree\nfundamentally, and I think at one level every variance\nis a disagreement with the sentence that the Guidelines\nwould produce.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't know how that --\nthat fits in with your prior statement.\nMR. DREEBEN: It fits in with my prior\nstatement because what'S at issue in a case like this is\nnot whether the judge can disagree with the judgment of\nthe Guidelines and say youth matters, but whether the\njudge can do so to such an extent that the result is\nunwarranted disparity beyond what needs to be tolerated\nin order to achieve a system that complies with the\nSixth Amendment.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: You're saying that there's\na fairness component to the Guidelines in reasonableness\nreview.\nMR. DREEBEN: I'm saying that --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: When you start talking\nabout disparity, you're talking about a fairness across\na range of sentencing that is actually imposed.\nSo you're saying -- I think you're saying,\nthere's got to be a kind of substantive fairness\ncomponent to it.\nMR. DREEBEN: There has to be a substantive\nfairness component, Justice Souter, and I think that\nthere has to be a substantive excessiveness component.\nIn other words --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, that's kind after\nsubset, isn't it?\nMR. DREEBEN: I actually view it as the\nbroader category but I think the two of them work\ntogether.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.\nMR. DREEBEN: This is the fundamental\ndifference that I think exists between what Petitioner\nis offering and what the government is offering. We all\nagree that irrational sentences and procedurally\ndefective sentences are to be set aside on\nreasonableness review. But where we disagree, I think,\nis whether a judge on a court of appeals panel can look\nat the results reached by the district judge and\nconclude, this is an excessive sentence on the facts of\nthis case.\nWe think that the judge can do that on a\ncourt of appeals and that in order to determine whether\na sentence is excessive, a starting point is to compare\nwhat the judge did to what the Guidelines range does.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, then -- then you're\njust blowing smoke when you say that the Guidelines are\nadvisory. What you're saying is the criterion for\nfairness is the Guidelines and if you go too far one\nside or the other of the Guidelines, you're not being\nfair. That -- that's not -- that's not advisory.\nThat's the Guidelines as a criterion of sentencing.\nMR. DREEBEN: Unless, Justice Scalia, the\njudge offers sufficiently cogent, persuasive reasons so\nthat the court of appeals concludes that this is indeed\na reasonable sentence, given the reasons that the judge\nhas articulated as a matter of policy and the facts\nbefore him.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, he did that here. He\nsaid, you know, I think a young person like this --\nother people may feel differently, but I think somebody\nat 21 really is -- is not -- his brain isn't fully\nformed and we should give him another chance.\nMR. DREEBEN: He -- he did say that Justice\nScalia. But appellate review is conducted through the\nlens of 3553(a) and 3553(a) directs the judge to\nconsider a variety of things in addition to the history\nand characteristics of the defendant, which is where\nyouth comes in. It also directs the court to consider\nthe severity of the offense and the need for just\npunishment. It directs the court to consider deterrence\nconsiderations, and it directs the court to consider the\nneed to avoid unwarranted disparities between similarly\nsituated defendants, and that's where this court fell\ndown.\nIt's not that what the court said was wholly\nunreasonable, although in one respect, I think, with the\nemphasis on withdrawal for the reasons that Justice\nGinsburg mentioned, the judge did overstate the point.\nBut the judge lost sight of the fact that this is a\ndefendant who over a 7-month period engaged in a\nsustained drug conspiracy at age 21, not as an\nadolescent, and made 30 to $40,000 for that.\nAnd the result is that this judge\nconcluded that defendant --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Dreeben, do you think\nthere are any facts that would have justified probation\nfor this particular crime?\nMR. DREEBEN: Yes. I think that there are\ncases throughout the Federal system that have resulted\nin probation for defendants who committed similar crimes\nto this, maybe not as severe as this defendant. I'm not\nsure --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: What is the difference\nbetween the facts in this case and the ones which you\nwould find acceptable?\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, the ones that, I think,\nhave been the most appealing for probation sentences are\ncases in which the defendant's culpability is very low.\nThe defendant played a minor role in the offense,\nperhaps assisting a boyfriend or a friend --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I'm asking about whether\nin cases exactly involving the crime we have here,\nwhether any such cases would justify probation, where\nthe culpability was exactly the same as there was here.\nMR. DREEBEN: The only cases that I can\nthink of -- and I was trying to get to this point,\nJustice Stevens -- are ones in which courts conclude\nthere are compelling family circumstances where\nindividuals will be very badly hurt in the defendant's\nfamily if no one is available to take care of them, and\nthe defendant has really devoted his activities to doing\nthat, and there's no replacement; and the costs to\nsociety would be too high in those circumstances, courts\nhave concluded, to justify a sentence of imprisonment.\nI'm not saying that Petitioner is the most\nculpable defendant that could be sentenced under this\nstatute. This is a statute that carries a range --\nJUSTICE BREYER: This is exactly the kind of\ncase, though, that I think would give tremendous\ndiscretion to the district judge. Because, as I just\nlistened to you, you are listing a whole lot of features\nof it that are very case-specific, that require thorough\nknowledge of fact and thorough knowledge of the kind of\njudgment, a kind of individualized judgment, that\nsentencing judges are supposed to do.\nAnd that's what's worrying me about the test\nthat the circuit court gives here. It lumps together\nthings like what you just talked about with other things\nlike: I don't agree with the policy of the guideline,\nitself. And this is a typical case and, therefore, I\nthink we should look to try to find ways to unpack the\nsentence that it used, the statement -- you know, the\nworse it is, the worse the harder you look, et cetera,\nbecause that doesn't tell us much at all.\nIt suggests a proportionate test,\nmathematical, which must be wrong. It must be wrong\nbecause the same degree of departure could result from a\nview of an abuse of a vulnerable victim as could result\nfrom a total misunderstanding of what robbery is about.\nNow, it's not the percentage there that\nmatters. It's the rationale. It is what the judge did.\nAnd can you unpack it? We just did in the last\ndiscussion try to unpack that, and we continue in the\nnext case to try to do it.\nWhat we want -- I think what we want -- is\nto interpret that word \"reasonable\" so that we get back\nto a situation where judges do depart when they have\nsomething unusual and maybe occasionally when they think\nthe guideline wasn't considered properly, and then the\niterative process takes over, going back to the\ncommission. Now, how do we get there?\nMR. DREEBEN: Let me try to draw one\ndistinction and make a point about proportionality that\nI think is not encompassed within what you said.\nThere is a distinction between a judge\nforming a view based on the defendant's character and\nbehavior in front of the court and the history as\nrevealed in the presentence report where the judge has\nan institutional advantage over an appellate court for\nobvious reasons. And this was recognized in Koon versus\nUnited States. It hasn't changed today.\nOn the other hand, a district court has a\ndisadvantage, really, in formulating broad policy as\ncompared to the Sentencing Commission. Because the\nSentencing Commission has the ability to absorb vast\namounts of data and to consider the views of all\nsegments of the criminal justice community and to\nrespond to Congress. And it is really the component of\nthe sentencing process where you would expect broad\npolicy to be, as an initial matter, best formulated.\nNow --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: We should probably make\nthem mandatory.\nMR. DREEBEN: As I said to Justice Scalia,\nthey're not mandatory, and the judge does have the\nfreedom to challenge the judgment that the Sentencing\nCommission has drawn. But on appellate review, the\nnormal factors that go into which institutional actor is\nbest situated to decide a question tilts in favor of a\nmore rigorous form of review for pure policy\ndisagreements for not only the reason that the\nSentencing Commission is better, but for the reason that\nif you license all district courts to come up with their\nown broad, abstract policies, you end up with 474\nsentencing commissions who are operating --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So, on that ground I\nunderstand perfectly, and were we to write that into a\nparagraph in the opinion, this case still, would it not,\nbe the strongest case imaginable for discretion to the\ndistrict judge?\nMR. DREEBEN: I hope not, Justice Breyer.\nAnd I hope to --\nJUSTICE BREYER: You did, but I wanted to\nknow what you were going to say.\nMR. DREEBEN: As I said, the Section 3553(a)\nprocess is a holistic one. There are seven different\nfactors listed in Section 3553(a); and the commission,\nwhen it formulated the Guidelines, looked at the same\nsorts of factors and attempted to balance them.\nThis judge here did not devote particularly\nsignificant consideration at all to the fact that\nPetitioner sold 10,000 ecstasy pills, which have the\npotential for causing significant harm.\nAnd he earned a great deal of money out of\nit. He didn't give the money back. He may have\ninvested it in the house that he bought.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I'm sure that the\nprosecutor argued that, and the judge heard it, and he\nlisted what thought were the key factors.\nYou made a distinction between a sentence\ncould be rational but not reasonable. And I'm\naccustomed to understanding rationality review as\nequivalent to reasonableness review, but you made a\ndistinction between those two. So I get your idea of\nrationality passes the lunatic test. What is\nreasonableness?\nMR. DREEBEN: Reasonableness requires more\nof a balance of the policies and a consideration of the\noverall goal of the system of achieving uniformity.\nAnd I think perhaps the best way to\nillustrate the point is through a hypothetical similar\nto the one that Justice Kennedy posed. Suppose that a\ndistrict judge, confronting Petitioner, said: You were\na college student. You had every advantage in life.\nYou were 21; you weren't a kid. You made $40,000 over\nseven months. And when it suited you, you pulled out,\nand you did nothing to disrupt the conspiracy.\nNow, I have a statutory range here of zero\nto 20. And, although the guidelines call only for 30 to\n37 months, I think you should go to jail for 15 years.\nI don't see Petitioner as really offering a\ncourt of appeals or the criminal-justice system as a\nwhole a way for someone to step in and say that's\nexcessive. It doesn't leave room to make reasoned\ndistinctions among the kinds of defendants who violate\nthis statute, and it doesn't provide any check on\naberrant or outlier outcomes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: We're trying to development\na rule here that can be applied sensibly by all the\ncourts of appeals when they are reviewing the\ninnumerable sentences of federal district judges.\nAnd you have -- you haven't given me a rule.\nI have no idea -- if I were sitting on the court of\nappeals, I would have no idea when I can do it and when\nI can't do it.\nThe notion of reasonableness, you know,\nwhether a reasonable person could have given a sentence\nof this sort despite the fact that it is not what the\nSentencing Commission did, that's -- that's something\nyou can work with, but I don't understand what your rule\nis.\nMR. DREEBEN: Justice Scalia, the competing\nrule of mere rationality or the judge did something\nthat's reasonable is pretty much a one-way ticket to\ndisparity. Because it means that every district judge\nwould get the opportunity to say: I've seen the\nguidelines, but I don't agree; and, as a result, I'm\ngiving the 15-year sentence to Mr. Gall versus all the\nway down to probation, and the courts of appeals would\nhave to affirm both.\nNow, I am trying --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I wouldn't say -- I\nwouldn't say that. There are -- there are certain --\ncertain limits where you would -- the example you gave\nof that kind of an acceleration of the penalty, and I\ncan see giving this person no jail time whatever would\nbe extreme.\nBut if you are trying to get a narrow range\nof sentences out of the guidelines, it seems to me\nyou're just working in opposition to what our opinions\nhave said which is that the guidelines are advisory.\nAnd they're not mandatory.\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, the question I think\nhere is how advisory do they have to be in order to\ncomply with this Court's Sixth Amendment jurisprudence\nand the remedial opinion in Booker, as I understand it,\nanswered that question by saying they're not mandatory,\nbut the features of the appellate review and continued\nexistence of the sentencing commission are going to work\nsignificantly to achieving Congress's objectives of\nincreased uniformity. And the nine courts of appeals\nthat have adopted proportionality review, even if they\nmay have used slightly different words to express it,\nare -- I think, responding to a fundamental intuition,\nwhich is how do I know if the sentence in front of me is\nlikely to be significantly outside the norm.\nAnd second, if it is, should I not look for\nmore to sustain it than a sentence that's co-extensive\nwith the guidelines sentence.\nI think this case is really the counterpart\ncase to the Rita case that the Court decided last term\nwhen that judgment of the sentencing court and the\ndistrict judge -- the sentencing commission and the\ndistrict judge coincide, courts of appeals can assume\nit's likely, although not definitely true -- but likely\nthat the sentence is a reasonable one. But when the\nsentence is significantly outside what the guidelines\nwould call for on an average case of that type --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Dreeben, you are\nsaying that you admit there's no presumption of\nunreasonable merely because it is outside but there is a\npresumption of reasonable if it dramatically or\nsignificantly is outside and you don't define\ndramatically or significantly?\nMR. DREEBEN: I am not able to give the\nCourt a rigid definition of it.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: You are not able to give\nany definition. You disavow a percentage. You just\ncome up with nothing else. Just the word dramatically.\nYou do say it is a presumption at that point by --\nMR. DREEBEN: I don't treat what I'm arguing\nfor as a presumption, but if the Court wants to conclude\nthat it does function like a presumption, I would still\nsubmit it is a perfectly valid presumption under these\ncircumstances.\nIt is not that the court of appeals --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, you should --\nI'm sorry. But I mean -- the only purpose of the\npresumption under your view is to trigger some inquiry\ninto the reasons.\nMR. DREEBEN: Correct.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Under 3553(a),\ndistrict courts have to provide reasons anyway, right.\nMR. DREEBEN: They do.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So if there is no\nexplanation of the reasons it is going to be invalid\nunder the statute, quite apart from any presumption of\nunreasonableness.\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, the presumption of\nunreasonableness goes a little bit farther than that,\nMr. Chief Justice, because it allows the court of\nappeals to take notice that this is a sentence that if\nupheld holds the potential for unwarranted disparity.\nAnd it may be that the sentence doesn't pose that risk\nat all. But the reasons that the judge gave to justify\nthat sentence should be somewhat commensurate or\nproportionate to the degree of the variance, otherwise\nyou're basically back to a system where so long as the\njudge can go through the facts of the case and give a\nrational explanation of why a sentence should be at that\nlevel, there's nothing for the appellate court to do but\nto affirm.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Why isn't that always true?\nA judge should always give reasons commensurate with the\nproblem. So what if we added by saying remember give\nreasons commensurate with the problem? I see something\nwe've lost. What we've lost is we've sort of pulled\nacross the screen here a rather murky curtain called\n\"something of a presumption,\" which we can't quite\ndefine, which will lead to lawyers making endless\narguments about whether this murky curtain -- they're on\none side of it or the other. So let's sweep its aside.\nLet's get to the underlying facts.\nMR. DREEBEN: What you'd be doing I think,\nJustice Breyer, is sweeping aside the approach that nine\ncircuits have taken.\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's correct.\nMR. DREEBEN: Which have usefully\nfacilitated their appellate review. They didn't select\nthe standard because they drew it out of an opinion from\nthis Court. They selected the standard because they\nconsidered it essentially a rule of reason. The rule\nbeing that under an advisory guideline system, we must\naccept that there will be considerably less uniformity\nthan under a mandatory system. That's appropriate. But\nwe don't have to accept the proposition that materially\noutlier sentences that are not supported by an adequate\nexplanation should stand. And if the courts of appeals\nare told, you go back to the drawing board now, you\ncan't use any kind of proportionality test, I think\nunless the Court gives them something that will allow\nthem to distinguish between a materially out of\nguideline sentence that is reasonable and one that is\nnot, the ultimate result will be every district judge\nknowing that in their courtroom, they can decide\nwhatever they like about the fundamental policies of\nsentences, and it will stand.\nThe reason why the sentencing guidelines\nsystem was originally adopted was to eliminate each\ndistrict judge operating purely on that judge's\nphilosophy.\nJUSTICE BREYER: We were making progress? I\nthought our last discussion -- we were making progress\non this very point, where we have the judgmental\nmatters, the fact finding matters, and the pure policy\nmatters, and we distinguished the latter from the first\ntwo?\nIf you were a district judge, wouldn't you\nfind it more enlightening to talk in those terms?\nMR. DREEBEN: No. I think that what the\ndistrict judges need to understand is that they're not\nbound by the guidelines, but the guidelines remain\nsomething that is a reference point, that if deviations\nor variances are warranted, they should be explained,\nand they should be explained in a way that's consistent\nwith the degree of the variance. Because the\nalternative of wholesale abdication to the district\njudge to assess the individual facts of the case means\nthat one district judge can conclude that a defendant\nlike Mr. Gall warrants probation, and another one can\nconclude that he warrants 10 or 15 years, and there'll\nbe no remedy on appeal because it will all be very\ncase-specific. It won't be policy driven disagreements.\nMost of what goes on in Federal sentencing is not\nfundamentally a deep-rooted policy disagreement of the\nnature of the kind that Justice Scalia and I were\ndiscussing, about whether white collar defendants should\ngo to jail at all.\nMost of it is about how do the particular\nfeatures of this individual defendant match up with the\npolicy considerations --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Dreeben, can I ask\nanother question? I go back to percentages for just --\nto illustrate the point. You say that the justification\nhas to be responsive to the extent of the departure.\nAnd you -- you kind of disavow percentages that trigger\n-- you say substantial. But how do you measure the\nstrength of justifications? For example in this case,\nthere were four or five justifications -- withdrawal\nfrom a conspiracy, youth, that he got over alcoholism,\nso forth. Is the judge supposed to put a percentage\nvalue on each of those justifications and see if they\nadd up to the percentage? And if not, aren't you\ncomparing oranges and apples?\nMR. DREEBEN: It is more of a wholistic and\njudgmental process than a mathematical one, Justice\nStevens. And I am reluctant to offer percentages\nbecause I don't want to be mistaken for saying there is\nsome litmus test with superguidelines, ranges -- but I\ncan say that courts of appeals that find a variance to\nwarrant a substantial or extraordinary justification are\ntypically looking at 40 to 50 to 60 percent away from\nthe guidelines range, not sentences that --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Does that call for a 40 to\n50 percent justification?\nMR. DREEBEN: It calls for one that makes\nsense given the degree of the various --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But don't you read the\ncourt of appeals opinions as in effect saying we've got\nto get a percentage that matches the percentage of\ndeparture?\nMR. DREEBEN: Linguistically, the words used\nare, you need a compelling reason for an extraordinary\ndeparture -- an extraordinary reason for an\nextraordinary departure or variance. So in that sense,\nI agree with you. But the court of appeals have not\nattempted to create a mathematical grid, because such an\nexercise would be both contrary to the notion of\nadvisory guidelines, and also one that is inherently\narbitrary. And that's why I said that it is\nunfortunately more in the nature of, I know it when I\nsee it, but I don't think that this is as bad as the\npredicament the Court found itself in in obscenity\ncases, because it really isn't that hard to tell the\ndifference between a variance that is a few months\noutside the range or even a variance in the facts of\nthis Gall case, say down to 15 months, and a sentence\nthat just wipes out all prison time altogether.\nI don't think the Court should have any\ndifficulty saying that if a judge is just going to wipe\nout all prison time --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Can I ask you -- if it\nwipes it out entirely, does that make this case\ndifferent or like a case in which the maximum was say --\nwas 30 years instead of 30 months? Are they both to be\njudged by the same standard on the justification?\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, in this case, because\nthe government believes that the guidelines provide a\nreference point for proportionality review, a sentence\n--\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Supposing the guidelines\nprovided 30 years? Would the justification for\nprobation in that case have to be just as strong as in\nthis case?\nMR. DREEBEN: Stronger, I would say, because\nif the guidelines --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Because the percentage is\nreally irrelevant --\nMR. DREEBEN: Excuse me.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: It would -- then the\npercentage is irrelevant, if you said it has to be\nstronger in that case.\nMR. DREEBEN: Yes, I think that -- that's\nwhy I don't think you can confine it to percentage. I\nthink if the guidelines are calling for a very\nsubstantial period of imprisonment, and a judge says, I\njust don't think the culpability of white collar\noffenders ever warrants sending them to jail, I think\nthe better approach is you have them go out and make\nspeeches to fellow potential defendants about how\nterrible their experience was, that is something that's\ngoing to produce a very widespread potential for\ndisparity.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Dreeben, you're --\nyou're arguing hereby in a case where the departure was\ndownward, but you're -- the principle you apply, you\nwould apply for upward departures as well?\nMR. DREEBEN: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Doesn't there get to be a\nconstitutional problem where -- where the court which is\nestablishing these -- these ranges that you want has\nheld, after a series of decisions, that basically you\ncannot get 30 percent over -- over the guideline range\nunless particular facts exist? And it has specified\nthose -- those facts in prior decisions. At that point,\nin order to go 30, you know, 30 percent above the\nguidelines, that fact becomes necessary for the\nconviction and -- or for the sentence, and, therefore,\nyou would need the jury to find it.\nMR. DREEBEN: No, Justice Scalia. I don't\nthink that courts of appeals conducting reasonableness\nreview should in effect construct their own guidelines\nsystem. They should respond to the reasons and the\nfacts that are before them.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's what common law\nadjudication always amounts to. By trial and error, one\ncase, the next case, you eventually end up knowing what\nis necessary in order to give 30 -- 30 percent over.\nUnless you're accomplishing that, I don't\nknow what you're accomplishing.\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, I -- I think you're not\naccomplishing that kind of a common law system in\nreasonableness review for many of the reasons that the\nCourt has already identified in describing why an\nabuse-of-discretion approach is warranted. The court of\nappeals will not be saying that this is the maximum\nsentence you could give on these facts. It would say\nthese -- this is an unreasonable or a reasonable\nsentence based on the policy considerations that the\njudge articulated and the facts that he relied on.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: He said this fact is okay.\nYou can go 30 percent above with this fact. So then in\nthe next case, the district judge says, I find that this\nfact exists and therefore you get 30 percent above the\nmax, and the court of appeals affirms, but the jury has\nnever found that fact.\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, Justice Scalia, I think\nthat the fundamental question of whether there is\nsubstantive reasonableness review for excessiveness was\nsettled in the Rita an opinion in which -- Rita\nrecognized that Booker contemplated --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It left open -- it left\nopen case-by-case adjudication. It left -- application\nreview. And I'm saying that in the application review\nof that case, you'd have to say you needed a jury\nfinding.\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, my response -- and if I\ncould answer Mr. Chief Justice -- is that the\nfundamental point of this Court's Apprendi line of cases\nis that, so long as the statutory maximum is legally\navailable to the judge, the judge can find facts within\nthat range that justify the sentence, and that's all the\nBooker remedial opinion authorizes judges to do.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Dreeben.\nMr. Green, you have a minute remaining. Why\ndon't you take three?\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY GREEN.\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. GREEN: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nMost bluntly, an I-know-it-when-I-see-it\ntest or a holistic test is not likely to generate much\nin the way of warranted uniformity either.\nJustice Scalia, you pointed out, in your\nquestion about whether this sentence was excessive or\nnot on the basis of the -- of the facts, that the\ngovernment is blowing smoke with respect to its\nstatement that the guidelines is purely advisory. Well,\nit's not only doing that; it's removing the exercise of\ndiscretion by the district judge.\nIt's saying to the district judge, you must\ndemonstrate to us facts. You must come to us with facts\nthat not only consist of explanations of reasons but are\nsufficiently persuasive or compelling to overcome our\nnatural resistance to an outside-the-guidelines\nsentence.\nThat I submit is, as articulated earlier,\nmaking the guidelines presumptive. And it imposes a\nfact-finding requirement that is in violation of the\nSixth Amendment.\nJustice Ginsburg, you asked about whether\nthe prosecutor had, in fact, heard all of the evidence\nwith respect to -- or stated all the evidence to the\ndistrict court with respect to Mr. Gall. The answer to\nthat question is he most certainly did. And I agree\nwith my colleague that this case is the mirror of Rita.\nIn Rita, the district judge was presented with a wealth\nof facts about Mr. Rita's prior good works, his military\nservice, et cetera.\nHere, the district judge was again presented\nwith a wealth of facts with respect to Mr. Gall's\nvoluntary rehabilitation, with respect to his having\ngrown, developed, and established a business and rid\nhimself of crime and drugs. And this district judge\nexercised his discretion to go down on the basis of\nthose facts and imposed a sentence of probation.\nAnd, Justice Stevens, the Eighth Circuit,\neven before the Guidelines, even before the Booker case,\nin 1993, in 1999, in cases called One Star and Decora\nrespectively, went down from even higher levels to\nprobation based upon the particular facts of the case.\nWe would ask the Court to overturn the\njudgment of the Eighth Circuit and abandon the\nextraordinary circumstances test.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you Mr. Green.\n"
