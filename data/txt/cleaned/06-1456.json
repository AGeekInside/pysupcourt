        "content": "(10:02 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument first\ntoday in Case 06-1456, Cuellar versus United States.\nMr. Beard.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JERRY V. BEARD\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. BEARD: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nSection 1956, the money laundering statute,\nrequires an intent to minimize the criminal taint of\nunlawful proceeds. But the statute does not criminalize\nconcealing money's existence. In this case,\nMr. Cuellar's conviction should be reversed for two\nreasons. First, while the method of the transportation\ninvolved may have been designed to conceal, the\ntransportation itself was not. Secondly, while Cuellar\nmay have in fact concealed money itself, he did not\nconceal the nature, source, location, ownership or\ncontrol of the unlawful proceeds.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, he certainly\nconcealed the location. They were secreted in the car,\nunder the goat hair and everything else. The location\nof the money was certainly concealed.\nMR. BEARD: Chief Justice, in the broader\nsense location was concealed. The point to be taken\nhere I think is this: An examination of the text itself\nreveals particular listed attributes, and location\nnumbers among them. But what this suggests, the\nrequirement that there be a design to conceal or to\ndisguise these particular attributes, necessarily means\na plan, if you will, for those -- excuse me -- for those\nattributes to be presented either to law enforcement if\nthey intercept the money or inject it into legitimate\ncommerce later. In other words, they'll be observed\nlater. Location has independent meaning, but it's also\nunderstood within the context of the words that surround\nit. All money changes location, whether concealed or\nnot. Location in this context means more than the\nlocation that the money was found in the car.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Maybe I should ask you this\nnow because you've probably thought about it and I can't\nwork it out. I don't see any problem with the word\n\"location.\" I thought what you would say is it isn't\nthe transportation in this instance that concealed the\nlocation, it's the method of transportation that sealed\nthe location.\nMR. BEARD: Yes, Justice --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And if you read it that\nliterally, then there is no problem in getting to your\ninterpretation of the statute, or is there? Because\nsince you didn't advance that argument, I thought maybe\nthere's something I've not seen here.\nMR. BEARD: No, Justice Breyer; you're\ncorrect. There is a huge difference between the method\nof transportation and the transportation itself. And in\nthis particular case, the difference is certainly\nimplicated. What we understand the government to be\narguing is that the method of the transportation\nsignifies the listed attributes. But if that were the\ncase it would effectively render all transportation of\nfunds necessarily to be money laundering.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I just ask, what do\nyou mean by method of transportation in this case? I\nmean, that it was in a car or the fact it was wrapped up\nin dirty -- in a dirty kind of container, and so forth\nand so on?\nMR. BEARD: Justice Stevens, what I'm\nreferring to is certainly that it was in a car, but\nthere was a secret compartment, goat hair was sprinkled\naround to try to throw off drug detection dogs, and\nthose type of characteristics.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But isn't that all just\nevidence that there was a motive to conceal the\nownership?\nMR. BEARD: No, I don't think so,\nJustice Stevens. What we're looking at here is that the\ndesign of the -- the fact Mr. Cuellar may or may not\nhave known, for example, who owned -- where the money\nwas coming from or who owned it, that doesn't go to the\ndesign of the transportation. The design of the\ntransportation itself is just to get the money to\nMexico. I can say that abstractly, but in this case in\nparticular because we know from the government's\nevidence that what this was was essentially the last leg\nof a drug trafficking deal. We know that this was\nrepayment. So in this particular case at least, the\npurpose of this transportation was to get this money\nback as repayment money.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: If he were a courier\nbringing the marijuana into the United States what would\nbe the crime and the penalty?\nMR. BEARD: Justice, if he was bringing --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: If he was bringing\nmarijuana into the United States instead of returning\nwith the proceeds?\nMR. BEARD: Well, presumably, Your Honor, it\nwould be a drug trafficking crime. But of course, as I\nunderstand your hypothetical, he would possess marijuana\nat that time.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But now he possesses\nmoney. And you're not saying this is innocent behavior.\nIt is criminal behavior, so what is the crime if not\nmoney laundering?\nMR. BEARD: We have suggested that\nMr. Cuellar's, liability, liability or culpability, lie\nmore properly under the bulk cash smuggling statute.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But that requires knowing\nthat it's illegal to take out more than X amount of\nmoney, and there's nothing that indicates that the\ncommon courier would know anything about such a\nprovision.\nMR. BEARD: Yes, you're correct that it\nwould require inference as opposed to direct evidence.\nThis is why in our reply brief, we gave an example of\nwhere the identical type behavior arose, not in Texas\nbut in Alabama, and in fact the individual pleaded\nguilty to bulk cash smuggling.\nSo I suppose my response would be this. The\nsame weak inferences that supported the money laundering\nconviction in the government's eyes would be the same\ninferences that would support the cash smuggling.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: If we take it that you\nconcede -- I don't want to say that you concede. If we\ntake it the government has a strong case under the\nsmuggling statute, wouldn't it have an equally strong\ncase under (i) of the statute that we're considering\nhere, which doesn't require concealing or disguising the\nnature, just to avoid a transportation reporting\nrequirement. That's the same as the smuggling statute.\nMR. BEARD: No, I don't think --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I know the government\ndidn't indict under (ii).\nMR. BEARD: But I don't think it is the\nsame, Your Honor, because the cash smuggling, the bulk\ncash smuggling statute, speaks to currency and of course\nthis speaks to transactions. So I think that there\nis in fact --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: You mean as the proceeds\nof an illegal transaction?\nMR. BEARD: Well, I'm distinguishing between\ncurrency and transaction because as I understand it at\nleast transaction might implicate in a banking context,\nbut cash is cash, if you will. So --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And it doesn't matter for\npurposes of the bulk cash statute that it was illegal.\nIt could be perfectly lawful money.\nMR. BEARD: Yes, Your Honor, absolutely.\nThat's certainly true.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But why -- why isn't\nthis transporting to conceal the location or the\nownership in this sense? Suppose you have someone the\npolice suspect of engaging in drug activities. They\nknow he sold, you know, so much marijuana or whatever\nand got cash back. They think it's there, and they're\ngoing to investigate it, but this fellow comes in and\nthey transport the proceeds across the border.\nIsn't that transportation to conceal the\nlocation or the ownership?\nMR. BEARD: As I understand it, Mr. Chief\nJustice, if the police are aware of it and then the\nflush, if you will, takes the money across, I think\nthat's -- that's much closer. That's --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, they think\nit's there, but they're not sure, and they -- you know,\nthat would help them make their case, to find out that\nthe guy they think sold the drugs has $80,000. So they\nget a search warrant or whatever, and it turns out he\ndoesn't, because it's been transported to conceal the\nlocation or ownership.\nMR. BEARD: I would -- no, I think that\nthe -- if the police were aware, if the police were\naware and the kingpin were aware and put in place some\ntype of design, if you will, to flush the money and\nperhaps to -- to Mexico under the circumstances you\ndescribed, then you would be closer to, to having money\nlaundering liability, although certainly I don't know\nthat the courier necessarily would.\nHowever, I think it's very important to\nconsider that the money laundering statute necessarily\ncontemplates this notion of -- of detection or the money\nresurfacing, if you will. And the reason I think that's\nimportant is because it gives a particular meaning to\nthose listed attributes. If the police were just --\nwell, in this case, just stumbled upon it, and nothing\nwas -- had been done and there was no evidence on the\nrecord to suggest that there was going to be anything\ndone in this case other than repayment, money laundering\nliability is simply not going to arise.\nNow, I think that --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I still don't see why isn't\nwhat the Chief Justice said absolutely right? If you\nare transporting this money to get it out of town so the\npolice can't find it, you're transporting it to conceal\nit. That falls right within the statute.\nMR. BEARD: I --\nJUSTICE BREYER: If you're transporting it\nsimply to pay some courier somewhere else, you're not\ntransporting it to conceal it. And if in fact the\ntransportation is done in a way that conceals it, that's\nbeside the point because the statute is interested in\ntransporting it in order to conceal it.\nMR. BEARD: I think that --\nJUSTICE BREYER: What is wrong with that?\nMR. BEARD: I think what's wrong, Your\nHonor, is that the -- the statute focuses on the\ntransportation or some of the other transfers of\ntransmission and specifically is coupled, if you will,\nwith this notion of -- of the attributes themselves. I\ndon't know that it's -- it's simply too broad, in fact,\nto say that all transportation's will necessarily incur\nthe money laundering liability.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I -- maybe I don't\nunderstand the -- I thought he was helping you, but\nmaybe --\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Were you helping him? I\nthought so.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: It sounds like he was\nmaking the distinction that didn't the dissenting judge\nmake between -- the dissenting judge says transporting\nto conceal is no good, but concealing to transport is\nokay.\nMR. BEARD: That -- you're correct, Your\nHonor, and that is, I think, a point to be made. The --\nJudge Smith below did try to highlight the fact that if\nyou transport to conceal, then you're beginning to\nimplicate money laundering liability.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Suppose someone transports\nmoney across a border and is recorded surreptitiously on\ntape explaining exactly why the person did it, and the\nperson says: The reason why I'm transporting this\nacross the border is because I know that when I get it\nto the destination country, that's a place where people\nuse huge amounts of cash for bank deposits, for\npurchases; and, therefore the act of transporting it\nfrom the United States to the other country will\ndisguise the nature of the cash as drug money.\nWould that fall within the statute?\nMR. BEARD: No, I don't think so,\nJustice Alito, and the reason I don't is because that\n-- what you've described implicates potential money\nspending, this notion that the money is easier spent.\nBut without more, money spending would not equate to\nmoney laundering. That's --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Why wouldn't that fit the\nliteral language of the statute? It's a transportation\nacross the board with the design to conceal the nature,\ni.e., that it's drug money, of this money?\nMR. BEARD: I'm not sure, Justice, that\nyou've actually concealed the nature. If the money was\ngoing -- if the money was dirty and going across dirty,\nit remained dirty and just happened to be spent. But --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but it doesn't remain\ndirty simply because it goes to a place in which the\nappearance of this kind of cash does not have the dirty\nappearance that it does at home. Why -- why isn't\nthat the correct answer?\nMR. BEARD: I --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Why doesn't that make it\nlaundering?\nMR. BEARD: Again, I don't know that there\nhas been -- as I understood the hypothetical, I don't\nthink that there's been any suggestion of a design to\nconceal, the why. You're just taking dirty and you're\n--\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, but the design to\nconceal -- maybe I misunderstood the hypo, but I thought\nthe design to conceal was you conceal the dirty\ncharacter of the money by taking it to a place and using\nit in that place where use of large amounts of cash,\nwhether for bank deposits or spending in luxury stores,\ndoes not have the dirty implication, the dirty\nappearance that it does in the United States.\nSo, why doesn't that therefore satisfy the\nconcealment?\nMR. BEARD: I -- Justice Souter, I think\nthat the answer to the question is here. The statute is\ndesigned to take -- or purposed to take these dirty\nproceeds, unlawful proceeds, and to cleanse them so as\nto prevent their injection into streams of legitimate\ncommerce.\nWhat you've described as spending is\nadmittedly spending, but I don't think that the spending\nthat's -- that you've contemplated there basically\nimplicates the core concern, if you will. The money --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You don't have any evidence\nlike that here anyway, do we? Do we know that this was\ngoing to \"Spendy Land\" where everybody has a lot of\nmoney? Did we know that?\nMR. BEARD: Justice Scalia, what we know,\nbecause the government's evidence established it, is\nthat the money was being sent back to Mexico to repay\n--\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Does everybody have a lot\nof money in Mexico? Is that --\nMR. BEARD: Well, I would hazard to say no,\nof course, but the record --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Was there -- was there\nevidence about the nature of the Mexican economy?\nMR. BEARD: There was. There was, Your\nHonor.\nJUSTICE ALITO: What was the evidence?\nMR. BEARD: I'm sorry?\nJUSTICE ALITO: What was the evidence?\nMR. BEARD: The evidence that you just asked\nabout went to that it was easier to spend money in\nMexico.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Wasn't there an expert who\nsaid that Mexico has a cash economy?\nMR. BEARD: Yes, yes. And it -- and --\nJUSTICE ALITO: And what does that mean?\nMR. BEARD: What I take it to mean --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Does it mean people can\nspend a lot of cash without raising eyebrows?\nMR. BEARD: Certainly more than here. That\nwas what I think that the evidence was offered for. And\nthe same expert, of course offered, you know,\nestablished -- or the government established through the\nsame expert that the purpose of this particular\ntransportation was to complete the transaction, the drug\ntransaction.\nJUSTICE ALITO: In your brief, you argue\nthat there has to be a design to create the appearance\nof legitimate wealth. Are you drawing back now from\nthat argument?\nMR. BEARD: No, and, of course, we are well\naware that those words are not found in the statute, nor\ndo we suggest that they were. But what we have\nsuggested is simply that that's, if you will, shorthand\nfor describing what necessarily occurs if the\nattributes, the listed attributes, are obfuscated. That\nis the cleansing mechanism.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, why would that be so?\nSuppose -- I mean, just take -- modify my hypothetical.\nWhat this person says on the tape is: I'm sending this\nmoney across the border because I know that if it --\nonce it gets there, it will be harder to establish my\nownership of it. People will still know that it's drug\nmoney perhaps, but they -- it will be harder to\nestablish my ownership of it.\nNow, would that fall within the statute?\nMR. BEARD: Well, at that point, yes,\nbecause I think --\nJUSTICE ALITO: But there wouldn't be an\nattempt to create the appearance of legitimate wealth\nthere then, would there?\nMR. BEARD: Well, to the extent that the\nindividual who has been taped is contemplating the\nmoney's resurfacing, I think that there would be. It\nwould be not legitimate wealth, though. And perhaps I\nneed to drive this point home. It would be less dirty.\nIn other words, there's not a requirement that the dirty\nmoney necessarily be made clean or a description, but\nthat the dirty money be made less dirty. And that I\nthink is -- is what we're talking about.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Does the statutory purpose\nhave to be the only purpose or the principal purpose? I\nmean, I could conceive that the principal purpose of\nthis transportation was to give the money back to the\nfellow who gave the drugs, to pay the provider of the\ndrugs. I assume that would be the principal purpose.\nBut what if you know that when the -- when\nthe provider of the drugs is paid, he'll be able to\nspend this cash easily in Mexico, which has a cash\neconomy? And let's assume that the latter is enough to\nsatisfy the purpose requirement of this statute. What\n-- what would be the result?\nMR. BEARD: If we -- well, Justice Scalia,\nif we --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: If you assume a primary\npurpose to pay off the --\nMR. BEARD: Right. If we assume that the --\nthat the latter, as you just said, satisfies the\nstatute, then you have a conviction.\nBut we certainly don't assume that, because\nthat implicates money spending, and money spending\nhasn't -- hasn't been held to be money laundering.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Even though that wasn't the\nreal purpose -- I mean, the real purpose was to pay off\nthis fellow, who otherwise might come to hurt you.\nMR. BEARD: Yes, absolutely.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But once you do pay him\noff, you know that the money is going to be ready\nspendable.\nMR. BEARD: Well, certainly in this case, we\ndon't have any evidence that Mr. Cuellar knew any such\nthing. If you were to remove it from the confines of\nthe Cuellar case, I think you -- your hypothetical does\ncome closer to implicating liability; but that's simply\nnot what we have here, at least.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Now, what you understand\nthe language \"disguise the nature of the proceeds of\nthis specified unlawful activity\" to mean, does that --\nis that satisfied by merely proof that it is proceeds of\nunlawful activity? Or do you have to tell that -- what\nis the word \"nature\" talking about?\nMR. BEARD: No, Justice Stevens. It would\nagain, I think, require more. If all that were required\nis to show that there was unlawful proceeds --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, that's what it seems\nto say. What I'm asking is: What do you think it\nmeans?\nMR. BEARD: Well, what I think it means is\nthat there has to be some -- the transportation or what\nhave you has to be purposed, designed, to take the\nnature and obfuscate it. And this --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But I'm just asking about\nthe word -- the meaning of the word \"nature.\" What is\nthe nature, other than the fact it's proceeds of\nunlawful activity?\nMR. BEARD: That it would -- I think that it\nwould -- \"nature\" is perhaps the first and foremost of\nthe attributes, but I think that it means, that it means\ndirty, unclean.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: \"Dirty\" in some sense\nother than being proceeds of specified unlawful\nactivity?\nMR. BEARD: Oh, okay. I don't know.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I just don't know what\nthat means other than that it is proceeds of unlawful --\nMR. BEARD: When I have -- when I read the\nattributes and contemplate --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I'm just talking about the\none attribute, \"nature.\"\nMR. BEARD: Right.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I'm trying to understand\nwhat you think that means.\nMR. BEARD: I have thought of it as meaning\nbasically dirty.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Proceeds of unlawful\nactivity.\nMR. BEARD: Proceeds of unlawful activity\nare the --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: It's always dirty.\nMR. BEARD: There may be -- well, yes, I see\nwhere you're going. Is there -- what is the independent\nmeaning of \"nature.\" I think that --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Why isn't it simply to\nchange the nature from being drug money to look like\nit's apparently innocent? I mean the change of the\nnature -- the nature going in is it's always dirty.\nIt's drug money. And the purpose of the concealment is\nto get it converted to some different nature, i.e.,\nclean money.\nIsn't that what \"disguise the nature\" means?\nMR. BEARD: I don't -- I brook no quarrel\nwith that. I mean, yes. I'm just -- what I was simply\nsuggesting --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But the verb is not\n\"transformed.\" The verb is \"disguise\" or \"conceal.\"\nMR. BEARD: That's true, and the meaning\ncertainly of \"conceal\" would be to bring it forward with\nmaybe no explanation of the taint, if you will. And, of\ncourse, \"disguise\" would be to maybe create a false\nexplanation of where the money is --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Was there a reporting\nrequirement for -- for this shipment. If he had gone to\nthe border, would he -- well, then, a lot of what you're\narguing about isn't very important because they could\njust indict under (ii).\nMR. BEARD: To avoid a transaction-reporting\n--\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: To avoid a\ntransaction-reporting requirement, and you wouldn't have\nto go through all this \"nature\" thing.\nMR. BEARD: Your Honor, as I understand it\nhe would have a currency-reporting requirement, had he\nbeen going South.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: You indicated that there\nis such a requirement.\nMR. BEARD: A currency-reporting\nrequirement, yes. I'm not sure that there is a\ntransaction-reporting requirement. I think that that --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Oh, I see.\nMR. BEARD: -- may implicate different\nconsiderations.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And if he -- if he didn't\nknow about the currency-reporting requirement, then he's\nnot guilty under that statute because it requires\nknowledge.\nMR. BEARD: Yes, Your Honor, I understand.\nAnd so where we are left is he may not be guilty under\nmoney laundering and perhaps, perhaps not under bulk\ncash smuggling. But that in itself does not necessitate\na broadly interpreted understanding of the money\nlaundering statute.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: If he's not -- if he\ndoesn't fit into either category, then there's no crime?\nMR. BEARD: That's a possibility, yes,\nabsolutely.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, can I ask\nyou to go back to Justice Stevens's line of questioning?\nIf -- do you conceal the nature of proceeds if you\nconceal the proceeds?\nMR. BEARD: No, and I think that --\nMr. Chief Justice, I think that it's important to\nunderstand, for example, that hiding money is not\nnecessarily the same thing as -- I mean, concealing\nmoney is not necessarily the same thing as concealing\nthe location. And I think you could make the same type\nof analysis in the other --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that -- that\ndoesn't seem to follow. I understand the argument with\n\"nature.\" In other words, you're not concealing the\nnature; it's just not there. But when you're hiding it,\nyou are concealing the location.\nMR. BEARD: Yes. But, again, I think that\nthe term \"location,\" which is understood in the context\nof the words surrounding it, if I take money and hide it\nin my --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that gets me\nto a question. Several times you've referenced the\nattributes. Are you saying that the statute would have\na different meaning if it just said \"location\"?\nMR. BEARD: What I'm suggesting, Chief\nJustice, is that if the -- that the statute would have a\nparticularly different meaning from the one that the\ngovernment wants if the attributes just listed existence\nof the money. There is a huge difference between hiding\nmoney or hiding the location of the money.\nIf you just had location by itself, I'd be\nmaking the same argument; but there's a huge difference\nbetween hiding money or hiding the location.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, you better\nexplain that a little more for me.\nMR. BEARD: All right, then. If I --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Because they seem to\nme the same.\nMR. BEARD: If I -- no. I think that the --\nhiding the location suggests that the individual is\ncontemplating the money resurfacing later, either for\ninjection into commerce or for -- perhaps if the police\ndiscover it, and they're trying -- the launderer, if you\nwill, is trying to make sure that the money would\nsurvive that subsequent --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay, so hiding\nlocation assumes it's going to come up later.\nMR. BEARD: Yes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And if you just hide\nthe money, you assume he's just going to leave it\nsomewhere and forget about it?\nMR. BEARD: No. No, Mr. Chief Justice. If\nyou just hide the money, that would encompass just\nhiding money, for example, in the back yard of your\nhouse with -- with -- or in a tin can or under a\nmattress or whatever. It's a much broader -- broader\nconcept.\nAnd I think that that's really what is at\nplay here because, to the extent that the government is\nfocusing on the method or -- of the concealment here,\nthey're -- they're implicating that type of behavior, if\nyou will, and saying it's sufficient to support a money\nlaundering conviction.\nJUSTICE ALITO: But what if there is a wire\ntransfer to a bank in another country because that bank\nhas bank secrecy laws that will make it impossible to\nascertain the location of the money once it is there?\nDoes that fall within the statute?\nMR. BEARD: At this point, no, Justice,\nbecause you haven't suggested that there was any type of\ndesign, any intent to disguise or conceal. You've just\nsuggested it went to another place. If I sent it to an\naccount --\nJUSTICE ALITO: If that's the purpose. If\nthe person says, I'm sending this to blank country\nbecause they've got bank secrecy laws there that make it\nimpossible to find this money once it gets into their\nbanking system.\nMR. BEARD: No.\nJUSTICE ALITO: That's not --\nMR. BEARD: On those facts, no, I don't\nthink so. Now, if I were sending money to accounts in\nthe jurisdiction you've described, and perhaps with a\nlittle bit more, different names on the accounts or what\nhave you, then I -- then I think a different result.\nBut if I'm just sending from my account here to my\naccount there, then no.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Would you say the same\nthing for -- if you just put it in a safe deposit box in\na bank in the Bahamas?\nMR. BEARD: I would make the same -- my\nanswer would be the same without more, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, the \"more\" is\nthey don't hold it under your name. They hold it under\na numerical account number. Then that changes\neverything?\nMR. BEARD: It very well may. At least -- I\ndon't know that it changes everything, but it very well\nmay lead to a different result. But you just modified\nthe hypothetical.\nWhat I'm -- what I'm suggesting is that if\nyou're just putting money in a safety deposit box or\nthis account or under the mattress or in the hole in the\nback yard --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Because the police can't\nfind it in that account even if it is still under your\nname. In an account here the police would be able to\nfind it. In an account in the Cayman Islands, they\nwon't be able to. Isn't that -- isn't that transporting\nit in order to conceal, to conceal it?\nMR. BEARD: Justice, no, I don't think so,\nand I'll briefly answer and try to come back to you in\nrebuttal.\nBut I think that it's important to\nunderstand the money laundering statute is not a\ndetection statute. That's not where the focus of the\nstatute rests.\nMr. Chief Justice, if I can reserve the\nbalance of my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.\nBeard.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't understand that, so\nI hope you will explain it later. It doesn't mean\nanything if it's not a detection statute.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Ms. Schertler.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF LISA H. SCHERTLER\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMS. SCHERTLER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may\nit please the Court:\nThe international concealment money\nlaundering statute contains no appearance of legitimate\nwealth requirement, nor does it demand proof that the\nillegal proceeds will be cleansed after they cross the\nUnited States border. Petitioner's construction of the\nstatute is not supported by its tests and would defeat\nits purpose.\nWhat the statute does require is proof\nbeyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant knows that\nhe has illegal proceeds and that he knows that the\ntransportation across the border of those known illegal\nproceeds is designed in whole or in part to conceal or\ndisguise one, at least one, of the facts in the statute\nabout those proceeds. The phrase \"designed in whole or\nin part\" directs a full examination of the plan, of the\nway in which the cross-border transportation of these\nknown illegal proceeds was planned out.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Does the word\n\"transportation\" mean the act of transportation across\nthe border or the method of transportation?\nMS. SCHERTLER: The word \"transportation\"\nitself means the carrying of something from one place to\nanother. The phrase \"designed in whole or in part,\"\nsuggests that one should look at the entire plan, the\nway that this transportation was conceived or planned\nout in the mind, which would include, we would submit,\nthe method that was -- that was chosen to be used for\nthis transportation, the individual who was designated\nto conduct this transportation of known illegal proceeds\nacross the United States border, and, yes, reasons for\nconducting that transportation as well.\nBut it is not limited, as Petitioner would\nsuggest, to just one fact, that being what's going to\nhappen to the funds after the transportation is over.\nJUSTICE BREYER: You go back to\nJustice Alito's question. I agree with you that you\ncould read this as including a prohibition against a\nmethod of transportation which method is to hide the\nmoney. You could. But you could also read it the way\nthat the question suggests, to refer only to the\ntransportation. So you transport it physically in order\nlater to hide it.\nNow, the difference between the two is if we\naccept yours, which is the broader, this statute\nincludes everything that has nothing to do with the\ncommon word \"money laundering.\" Any time you hide\nsomething, for whatever reason you hide it, to take it\nto pay the couriers, you're money laundering. Any time\nyou run a gambling operation and the people stick the\nmoney in the wad of their shoe, they're money\nlaundering.\nI mean, why would you think Congress would\nwant that narrow reading when it can be read to focus\nmuch more closely on money laundering just by reading it\nliterally for what it says?\nMS. SCHERTLER: Your Honor, several\nresponses to that, to that question.\nFirst of all, what's the purpose -- if we\nwant to look beyond the words \"designed in whole or in\npart\" in the context of the international money\nlaundering statute to try to discern what the purpose\nwas of the statute, the purpose of this statute was to\nprevent criminals from taking their proceeds abroad\nwhere they would be outside the reach of all of these\ncontrols that have been set up in the United States in\norder to detect illegal proceeds and use those proceeds\nto trace back to the crimes and the criminals that\ngenerated them.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But if that's all they were\ngetting at, they wouldn't have to have this\ninternational component at all, because if you totally\neliminated the \"to or through\" requirement and you were\nable to focus or properly focus solely on the method of\nthe transportation, et cetera, then you would cover not\nonly cases in which the concealment ultimately would\ntake place by crossing a border, but you would pick up\ncases in which the concealment would take place even\nwithin the United States; and that would certainly be in\nthe government's interest.\nBut if you add, if you say, well, but this\nis limited by a to or through requirement, then it\nsuggests, it seems to me, as Justice Breyer's question\ndoes, that it must -- the statute must be getting at\nwhat happens when it crosses the border as opposed to\nthe means of crossing.\nWhat's your answer to that?\nMS. SCHERTLER: My answer to that, Your\nHonor, is that that would have -- that would defeat the\npurpose for which this statute was enacted. The -- the\npremise of this statute was that once illegal proceeds\nare taken abroad, taken outside of the United States\nsystem, we lose control of them, we lose the ability to\nfind them, and we will have no idea --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But that would be -- that\nwould be equally true and an equally appropriate\nobjective without the \"to or through\" requirement in\nthere. In other words, you don't have to have the \"to\nor through\" requirement in order to give the government\na tool for exactly the purpose that you describe.\nMS. SCHERTLER: And there -- there could\nhave been drafted a statute that was even broader than\nthis one in that respect. But the way -- the reason\nthat Congress imposed the \"to or through\" requirement is\nthat it knew -- is that that was when law enforcement in\nthe United States would lose the ability to use ordinary\ninvestigative methods to find the proceeds of illegal\nfraud.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Then what you're saying, I\nsuppose, is that the movement of funds, if they're\nillegal proceeds, outside of the country is a per se\nconcealment?\nMS. SCHERTLER: No, Your Honor. We do not\n--\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Give me an example of when\nyou take money outside of the country that's illegal\nmoney --\nMS. SCHERTLER: Yes.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- that's not a\nconcealment?\nMS. SCHERTLER: Yes. Let's say you have a\ndrug dealer who conducts a number of drug transactions\non one side of the border, takes his daily take, puts it\nin his pocket or his wallet and crosses the border into\nMexico. Based on that evidence alone, the government\nwould not be able to show beyond a reasonable doubt that\nmerely taking those illegal proceeds, known illegal\nproceeds, putting them in your pocket, that that was\ndesigned to conceal the location, that there was a\nplan --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: He puts it in his shoe,\nokay. Because it's a lot, he puts it in his shoe.\nMS. SCHERTLER: That would --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That would be enough,\nwouldn't it?\nMS. SCHERTLER: That would -- yes. Your\nHonor, that would permit the inference. Now, of course,\nultimately --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: What if he gives it to his\nbrother and says take it across for me, will you?\nMS. SCHERTLER: Well, I don't think that\nthat alone is -- is enough, Your Honor.\nWhat the statute asks is can you find --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: If he tells his brother to\nput it in his shoe?\n(Laughter.)\nMS. SCHERTLER: That would -- that would --\nthat would get close.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why isn't that\nenough? If, for example, he's being -- he thinks he's\nbeing watched by law enforcement because they know he's\nup to something, but his brother isn't, why isn't that\nconcealing?\nMS. SCHERTLER: With that additional\nevidence, absolutely. I think there would be a basis\nfor a jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt that that\nwas designed, that that was designed to conceal.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well then, let me back up.\nThen let me add this. It seems to me that you're\nsaying, as you have to say, that any movement of illegal\nfunds outside the country which is concealed is per se\nconcealing a relevant attribute?\nMS. SCHERTLER: We don't go that far, Your\nHonor. As I said --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But if you do.\nMS. SCHERTLER: -- you need to find --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I think you have to go\nthat far to make the case you're making.\nMS. SCHERTLER: No, not at all. I mean,\nwhat -- Congress could have said every cross-border\ntransportation of illegal proceeds is covered. And they\ndid not. What they did was they set up this filter\nfor the ones --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But you're always\nconcealing the control. You're always concealing the\nownership. You're always concealing the location if\nit's in your shoe or in the bottom of the car.\nMS. SCHERTLER: I don't -- you have -- they\nhave to find a design to conceal.\nJUSTICE BREYER: He purposely puts it in his\nshoe, okay.\nMS. SCHERTLER: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: It's a design. He knows\nhe's going to do it. So -- and you're saying, I take\nit, 100 percent of the time that's illegal. If you're\nnot saying that, I don't understand what you're saying.\nMS. SCHERTLER: No --\nJUSTICE BREYER: If you are saying that, I\ndon't know why they call this statute \"Laundering of\nMonetary Instruments.\" Why didn't they call it \"shoe\nhiding\"?\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And you're basically\nconfronting face-on the dissent here, which drew a\ndistinction between transporting to conceal and\nconcealing to transport. And all you have here is\nconcealing to transport, and the question is whether\nthat violates the statute.\nI agree with Justice Breyer that if this is\na statute directed at concealing to transport, it's a\nfunny name for it to think that it's a money laundering\nstatute.\nMS. SCHERTLER: Your Honor, the title of\nthis statute, \"Money Laundering,\" this is exactly\nwhat -- among the conduct that Congress had in mind when\nit enacted and when it confronted money laundering in\n1986. It saw money laundering as the variety of ways in\nwhich criminals prevent the detection of their illegal\nproceeds and thus are able to profit from their crimes.\nIt covered a wide range of conduct that included\nconverting, yes, illegitimate wealth into legitimate\nforms through very complex means.\nBut Congress was also concerned about\ncriminals taking their proceeds across the border\nsurreptitiously --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Were they concerned that\nthis was a 20-year penalty, not what you're talking\nabout, the person who gets -- who is the drug dealer,\nbut all that this evidence shows is that we have a\ncourier. We don't even know if he knows who put the\nmoney in the car. We don't know if he knows the -- who\nthe person is that he's to deliver the money to.\nSo on your theory, all you have to prove is\nthat this defendant drove a car in which illicit money\nwas hidden in order to get it out of the country. No\ngrand design. All he is is a courier.\nMS. SCHERTLER: He needs to know that part\nof the design, part of the plan of that transportation,\nwas to conceal or disguise --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: That's a -- that's a lot\nof fancy language. All he knows, in fact, if he's just\na courier is that somebody gave him money to take this\ncar in which drug money is hidden across the border.\nMS. SCHERTLER: And the use of that courier\nalso was part of a design to conceal or disguise the\nownership and control --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Not his design. His\ndesign is only -- I mean, he's just a drug courier, and\nI think that's what -- that's a problem with your\ninterpretation of the statute. One can think of the\nkingpin having this elaborate plan, and when it gets to\nMexico it's going to go into this bank and that place.\nBut here the defendant is simply a courier, and on the\ngovernment's theory anyone who transports hidden money\nto get it out of the country, who drives the car, just\nthe driver, is a money launderer.\nMS. SCHERTLER: Justice Ginsburg, the --\nCongress's purpose here was in getting at exactly this\nkind of conduct by third parties in particular, because\nwhen you use a third party that violates another purpose\nat which the statute is directed: using third parties\nto conceal who the true owner in control of the proceeds\nis.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I suppose then the brother\nshould be -- giving the money to the brother should\nsatisfy the statute.\nMS. SCHERTLER: It --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Because if I'm -- if I'm in\nthe drug business and my -- my brother is an\ninternational social worker or something, I'm certainly\ngoing to conceal when I give it to him and he carries it\nacross the border.\nMS. SCHERTLER: Yes, Justice Souter, that\nwould be another example of using a third party so that\na -- so that one part of the design of that\ntransportation is to conceal the ownership and control\nof the proceeds.\nAnd in response to Justice Ginsburg's\nquestion, Congress also -- well, in the sentencing\nguidelines system now, the guidelines takes account of\nwhether you have the individual who is also engaged in\nthe underlying offense or whether you have a third party\nwho had not been involved in the underlying offense.\nBut no -- no matter how you see it, this was\nprecisely the conduct that Congress is getting at. It\nsaw that the only way to -- to get at crime -- one way\nthat was very important to it was to get at the money\nand in order to get at the money you need to be able to\ncounteract the ways in which the criminals would prevent\nlaw enforcement from getting at the money.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Suppose the person who set\nall this up lives in Mexico and the sole intent of that\nperson was to bring the money back to him in the place\nwhere he lives? That would -- would that be money\nlaundering by him, to start out with?\nMS. SCHERTLER: If he had designed this\ntransportation, yes, Your Honor, because the whole --\nthe design of this transportation was to conceal or\ndisguise all five of the attributes of these illegal\nproceeds.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Isn't that a question of --\nisn't that a question of his intent?\nMS. SCHERTLER: I --\nJUSTICE ALITO: It's not the effect of the\ndesign, is it? It's the intent of the design.\nMS. SCHERTLER: It -- it is -- what was --\nwhat was the plan? What was the conception? What\ndecisions were made about why and how we get these\nproceeds from point A to point B.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Everybody knows he's a drug\ndealer, back in Juarez or wherever he lives in Mexico.\nMS. SCHERTLER: But by --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: He's famous in town. He's\na well respected man because he's a big drug dealer.\nAnd he has just arranged get the money delivered to him\nso that he can spend it. What -- what's concealing\nthere?\nMS. SCHERTLER: And he's arranged it in a\nway, if we're assuming the transportation here, so that\nhis ownership and control of those proceeds will be\ndisguised --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It won't be disguised.\nMS. SCHERTLER: -- during the course of the\ntransportation by saying, I'm going to select a third\nparty.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: During the course of\nthe transportation. That is not what you say in your\nbrief. I'm looking at page 41 and what you say is: \"If\nno independent evidence establishes that concealment or\ndisguising of the pertinent attribute of the proceeds\nwould occur at the point of destination, then a\nfactfinder would lack a reasonable basis for inferring\nthat the transportation was designed to conceal or\ndisguise.\"\nIn other words, in the hypothetical\nJustice Scalia just gave -- in other words everybody\nknows he's a drug dealer, he spends the money -- there\nis no concealment or disguising the pertinent attribute\nat the point of destination.\nMS. SCHERTLER: That -- the sentence,\nMr. Chief Justice, that you just read is the last in a\nseries of \"if's\" that we lay out in our brief, where we\n-- where we assert that at any point in the\ntransportation a jury could find evidence of a design to\nconceal or disguise. And that last sentence says if\nthey haven't found any evidence concerning the means and\nthe method and the person used for the act of\ncross-border transportation, and if in addition there\nwas no evidence of what would occur at the point of\ndestination, then there would be no evidence.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So there is no money\nlaundering if they conceal the proceeds in a suitcase\nthat's in the trunk of the car? Is that enough?\nMS. SCHERTLER: Well, that would --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is that concealing\nthe money?\nMS. SCHERTLER: If we're talking about just\nthe attribute of location, use of a suitcase I would say\nprovides some evidence that there was a design to\nconceal the location of those illegal proceeds during --\nas part of this cross-border transportation.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Does use of a\nsuitcase provide that evidence?\nMS. SCHERTLER: I think it would provide\nbasis for a jury to make --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: When I use a\nsuitcase I'm using it to carry my clothes, not to\nconceal them.\nMS. SCHERTLER: And if the jury were\npresented with testimony that that was the design --\nthat the only design, the only purpose, the only plan in\nusing that suitcase was to use it to secure money for\ntravel, then we would not have met our burden, but based\nsolely on the circumstances.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, your answer to\nJustice Scalia's hypothetical is still not clear to me.\nIt -- it seems to me your answer should be yes, because\nhe's concealing the ownership as of the time he goes\nacross the border, which brings me to my earlier\nquestion, if once it's concealed, the statute is always\n-- is always valid.\nThen you indicated that oh, well, what\nhappens at the destination is very important. Then we\nhad Justice Scalia's hypothetical. I'm not sure where\nyou came out on that.\nMS. SCHERTLER: Oh, our -- let me -- let me\nbe clear. I think even if one were to hypothesize that\nthere would be no effort whatsoever to conceal the money\nat the point of destination, but a jury could find that\nthe transportation itself was designed in other\nrespects -- in its method, in its means -- to conceal or\ndisguise an attribute of the proceeds, that would be\nenough to find that it was designed in whole or in part,\nin any part --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So Concealment,\nconcealment during the transportation is always a\nconcealment of an attribute under the statute. That has\nto be your position.\nMS. SCHERTLER: Concealment -- yes. The\nonly exception that we make would be in the Chief\nJustice's example, if the jury were to find that there\nwas no design to conceal the location, for instance, to\nprevent its discovery; it was only -- my only design was\nto secure this for transport, like I put my money in my\nwallet to do that.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask you a broader\nquestion, forgetting the text of the statute for just a\nminute, because the text is extremely broad. Do you\nthink the question whether there's an attempt to create\nan appearance of legitimate wealth has anything to do\nwith the analysis? The question presented is whether\nthere must be such a --\nMS. SCHERTLER: The question presented --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And you're arguing that's\ntotally irrelevant and that -- and also that that\nfamiliar title, \"Money Laundering,\" totally irrelevant?\nMS. SCHERTLER: Your Honor, we disagree that\nthere is any -- there is no appearance of legitimate\nwealth requirement in the statute. This --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: There is no -- okay.\nMS. SCHERTLER: This statute --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And the term \"laundering\"\nreally should be totally ignored?\nMS. SCHERTLER: The term \"laundering\" under\n-- when it is understood to mean the way Congress meant\nit and the way Congress was viewing this conduct is much\nbroader than Petitioner suggests.\nLaundering is the many ways in which\ncriminals prevent detection of their proceeds. It would\ninclude and Congress certainly had evidence before it --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I understand you could\nfind a violation of it, but what I'm really asking you:\nIs this just a total wild goose chase? We shouldn't\neven consider laundering at all? As I understand your\nargument, it's totally irrelevant.\nMS. SCHERTLER: The title of the statute\nsays -- but the terms of the statute are what matter\nhere.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: So it is irrelevant?\nMS. SCHERTLER: The terms are plain. But\neven if you were to look at the term \"laundering,\" it\nwould not support Petitioner's argument that that has a\nnarrow meaning that includes only conduct that creates\nan appearance of legitimate wealth.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So if this fellow\nwere driving to Canada would that be a different case,\nbecause Canada does not have the sort of cash economy\nwe've heard about in Mexico?\nMS. SCHERTLER: If the method of\ntransportation were exactly the same, it would make no\ndifference, Your Honor. In this case, this -- this\ntransportation method was designed, a jury could find\nbeyond a reasonable doubt, to conceal or disguise the\nownership and control of the proceeds through the third\nparty, and if that were the case and they were going to\nMexico it would be the same. The nature and the\nlocation of the proceeds through the use of this secret\ncompartment and the goat hair to discuss the scent of\nthe proceeds from the drug detection dog.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, what if the\nfellow says: You know, there are dangerous roads\nbetween here and Mexico. I'm hiding the money so that\nif, you know, a gang comes up they don't find it. And\nyou say: No, we think you're hiding it because it's\nillegal proceeds? Is that enough to get to the jury?\nMS. SCHERTLER: I think that's enough to get\nto the jury, and that would be a jury question, Your\nHonor, yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Just to be clear, you\naffirmatively say that concealing to transport is\nenough, right?\nMS. SCHERTLER: Yes, Your Honor. It's --\nthat is enough. Concealing to transport when the jury\n-- when it is part of the design of the transportation\nto conceal the location, nature, source, ownership, or\ncontrol, any single one of those things. And all of\nthose are in here.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Why do you make\ndistinctions between methods of concealment? And if the\ndesign is to get the money out of the country, why\nshould it matter whether you put it in a travel bag, you\nput it in the glove compartment, you put it in your\nwallet, or you go through this elaborate disguise that\nwe see here?\nWhat -- if what's important is getting it\nbeyond the border beyond the reach of law enforcement in\nthe United States, why should it make a difference how\ncarefully it is concealed?\nMS. SCHERTLER: That need not make a\ndifference if there is evidence before the jury, if\nthere is evidence that the ultimate design of the\ntransportation is to conceal or disguise the proceeds at\nthe point of destination.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, then your only\ndefense is to go across the border and before you go\nacross you put all the money in your arms so the people\ncan see it? That's the way you do it?\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Other than that?\nMS. SCHERTLER: In that situation, there\nwould no basis to find concealment or disguise of\nlocation. Now, some of the other attributes may be at\nissue if a third party is conducting that\ntransportation, but location from the method alone. So\nthe jury would need information about, well, what is the\ndesign, what is the purpose of this cross-border\ntransportation? They could still find that the\nnecessary design to conceal or disguise is satisfied by\nevidence that the whole purpose here is to get it to\nMexico where it will be turned into legitimate wealth,\nfor instance.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: That's transporting to\nconceal.\nMS. SCHERTLER: That's -- and I, for one --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But you're saying this\nstatute covers both?\nMS. SCHERTLER: It covers both, Your Honor.\nIt asks broadly what was this -- how was this\ntransportation designed and planned out in whole or in\npart? In any part, was it designed to conceal or\ndisguise? And that would encompass all of the stages\nthat we are -- that we are discussing.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: In your brief, you said\nthe bulk cash statute would not apply to a courier. Do\nyou still take that position, that the government's\nchoice is to indict for money laundering or nothing?\nMS. SCHERTLER: The bulk cash -- well,\nthe bulk -- in this case, there's no evidence in this\nrecord that a bulk cash smuggling statute charge would\nhave been viable because there's no evidence in this\nrecord that this defendant knew of a currency reporting\nrequirement and intended to evade it.\nPetitioner's argument that the bulk cash\nsmuggling statute shows that the conduct here was not\nintended to be covered by the money laundering statute\nis incorrect for the very reason that Justice Kennedy\nhas identified. The bulk cash smuggling statute could\nnot have filled a gap in the money laundering statute\nfor the conduct here because it has always contained a\nprovision that covers the transportation of known\nillegal proceeds across the border to evade a --\nreporting requirements.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: There's no principle that\nall criminal statutes have to cover every -- every bad\nact. Maybe Congress has left a gap. I'm willing to\nentertain the possibility that this individual,\nobviously doing something very bad, doesn't -- falls\nbetween the two stools. He is neither guilty under the\ntaking currency out of the country statute because he\ndidn't know of the existence of the statute, and he's\nnot guilty under one because he was not transporting to\nconceal but was concealing to transport. And so there's\na gap. The Justice Department can certainly get that\ngap filled readily enough. I don't know why we should\ntorture either one of the statutes to close it.\nMS. SCHERTLER: The plain reading of the\nmoney laundering statute covers this conduct, and\nCongress specifically had this conduct in mind. As\nSenator Biden said in questioning -- and he became one\nof the co-sponsors -- questioning a witness about this:\nIsn't it the truth that if we -- if we strengthen all\nour domestic controls against money laundering, aren't\nthe criminals going to resort to physically transporting\ntheir cash out of the United States? This is a --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How many co-sponsors\nwere there?\nMS. SCHERTLER: I don't know, Your Honor.\nThis is part of the core conduct at which\nthis statute was directed, this international\nconcealment money laundering statute.\nJUSTICE BREYER: How does that show what you\nwant it to show? I mean, what I just heard you say is\nthat Senator Biden said if we make it very tough to\nlaunder money in the United States, then criminals will\nsend their money abroad to be laundered.\nMS. SCHERTLER: And --\nJUSTICE BREYER: They'll transport it abroad\nin order to launder it. How does that help you?\nMS. SCHERTLER: They will resort to taking\ntheir money physically out of the United States. And\nthe Senate report says that this provision was designed\nto halt this flow.\nJUSTICE BREYER: In order to launder it.\nWere they not talking about money laundering?\nMS. SCHERTLER: If the premise --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Or were they not talking\nabout it? I'm just going back -- I didn't read Senator\nBiden's statement, so I'm just curious.\nMS. SCHERTLER: This provision was directed\nat preventing the illegal moneys from leaving the\ncountry. It would have made no sense for Congress,\nhaving understood that when money leaves the United\nStates we have little if any ability to know what\nhappens to it, to require in the statute proof beyond a\nreasonable doubt of what would happen to the money once\nit --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: If you're trying to prevent\nthe money --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But you, in response to\none of my hypotheticals, said that it would be relevant\nin some cases to show that it was designed to create the\nappearance of legitimate wealth. So you put that back\nin --\nMS. SCHERTLER: If --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So you put that back into\nplay.\nMS. SCHERTLER: If we have that evidence,\nyes, Your Honor. But to take Petitioner's position that\nit would be necessary evidence in every case in which to\nprevail under this statute to know of future plans to\nlaunder abroad, when the premise of this statute is that\nwhen the money leaves the country we cannot know what\nhappens to it, makes no sense.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What if --- if that's what\nthey're concerned about, taking the money out of the\ncountry, why do they have the concealment requirement?\nThey could have just said, you know, if you take dirty\nmoney out of the country you're guilty.\nMS. SCHERTLER: They --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: They didn't say that. They\nhave a concealment -- I can't understand why, if the\nmoney is hidden during the transportation, it's any\nworse than when the money is not hidden during the\ntransportation. It isn't -- it isn't the hiding during\nthe transportation they're concerned about. The statute\ndoesn't make any sense that way.\nMS. SCHERTLER: I think that it does, Your\nHonor.\nThe Court -- the Congress certainly could\nhave written it in the broad way that you've suggested.\nIt's not unlike the way that they wrote section 1957,\nwhich covers broadly all transactions in illegal money.\nThey chose to not cover everything and to\ncover cross-border transportation's where there's\nevidence of some intent on the part of that individual\nto conceal or disguise. And when you think about it,\nthey had set up regulatory provisions like the\ntransaction reporting requirement when there's no\nconceal or disguise. There were other controls in place\nas, say, the first line of defense against money\nlaundering to say, $10,000 or more is leaving the\ncountry, we're going to know about it because we have\nreporting requirements.\nHere the Senate report says that they made\nthe decision to require evidence of concealment.\n\"Evidence of concealment of a crime\" is what the report\nsays. And any time one of these attributes of illegal\nproceeds is being concealed or disguised, that is\nconcealing a crime in a way that impairs law enforcement\nfrom finding those proceeds.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask -- may I ask\nthis question? If the statute did include -- and I know\nyou think it does not -- a requirement of trying to\ncreate an appearance of legitimate wealth, you would\nlose? In this case.\nMS. SCHERTLER: I don't think so, Your\nHonor, and I would -- I would go back to the evidence\nthat Justice Alito has pointed out that is in this\nrecord, that there's evidence in this record that --\nthat the -- by taking the funds to Mexico, they would be\nable to be used in a way that would not raise suspicion.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, there's also,\nconsistent with the evidence, they want to pay the drug\ndealer for the drugs. And then a jury -- you can't say\nit's clear beyond a reasonable doubt that that was not\nwhat it was going on.\nMS. SCHERTLER: There was -- I would not --\nI would not disagree with that. I think that we do -- I\nsee that my red light is on.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why don't you finish\nyour answer?\nMS. SCHERTLER: Your Honor, there was --\nthere was evidence in this case that the proceeds were\nremoved -- this is expert testimony -- removed from the\nUnited States to conceal so as not to go through\nreporting requirements, so that the money would not be\nidentified to U.S. law enforcement. We believe the jury\ncould also infer that further efforts to conceal and\ndisguise those proceeds would occur at the point of\ndestination.\nThank you, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMs. Schertler.\nMr. Beard, you have four minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JERRY V. BEARD\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. BEARD: Justice Scalia, when I left we\nwere discussing --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I forget what it was that I\ndidn't understand.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. BEARD: Happily I've been thinking about\nit. Disruption versus detection I had told you, told\nthe Court that this was not a detection statute as much\nas it is a disruption statute.\nI think it is important for the Court to\nrecall that the very broad interpretations that the\ngovernment advances today are essentially the very broad\ninterpretations that the Congress rejected explicitly 20\nyears ago. The Congress rejected the notion that the\ntransportation of illicit funds in and of itself created\nmoney laundering liability. And we've discussed that.\nI think it's important, Justice Scalia, in\nparticular, in response to your question to bring this\nup, because the Congress recognized that detection would\nbe harder in rejecting that type of legislation, but\nrejected that they did.\nThe Congress has also shown itself capable\nof -- of -- in the 1957 context of taking transactions\ninvolving unlawful proceeds and making those per se\nillegal. They could have easily done the same thing in\nthe transportation context if they had wanted to, but\ninstead they were looking at the separate behavior that\ncomprises money laundering. I mean, it is the notion\nthat you're taking money somewhere else and you're doing\nsomething else and it gives rise to separate liability.\nI think the true harm in the government's\ninterpretation, it basically conflates liability for\nmoney laundering with the underlying offense, because\nall of the underlying offenses involve concealment.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask the same basic\nquestion of you? Do you think that this line, \"create\nan appearance of legitimate wealth\" is an essential\nelement of the offense?\nMR. BEARD: It is not an element,\nJustice Stevens. As I said, so --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: So then your question\npresented raised that question, you're walking away from\nthat question?\nMR. BEARD: We have spoken in the question\npresented in that broad term, because we think that that\nlanguage encapsulates what's taking place.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: It is not an essential\nelement of the offense?\nMR. BEARD: It's not an element. But what\nis an essential element is the need for the\ntransportation -- the transportation to be designed to\naccomplish the same thing, to obfuscate those\nattributes. It's -- and that's -- and therein is the\nreason why --\nJUSTICE ALITO: -- the same thing,\nappearance of legitimate wealth goes to one of the\nattributes, the nature of what's being transported. It\ndoesn't go to all the other attributes.\nMR. BEARD: The Congress had identified,\nJustice Alito, those particular attributes as being key\nto allowing the launderer to inject the money back into\ncommerce. It may be that nature is implicated more\noften, but the Congress chose to list the others because\nthey felt that those were the particular attributes\nthat, broadly speaking, allowed for the laundering\nprocess.\nThis notion of --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose the evidence is\nclear that he knew he was taking it across the border\nand it was to pay the drug dealer? Would that suffice?\nMR. BEARD: For liability under the statute,\nJustice? No, because the purpose there was not to\nobscure the attributes. It is simply repayment. It's\nthe final leg, if you will --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but -- no, no. He\nconceals it, in order to pay the drug dealer.\nMR. BEARD: Yes. I'm saying that -- I may\nhave misunderstood. If you are saying Mr. Cuellar were\nto know he was paying the drug dealer?\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes.\nMR. BEARD: That wouldn't give rise to\nlaundering, because all you have there basically is\nmoney spending. It's the conduct of the underlying --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: It's concealing who owns\nand controls.\nMR. BEARD: No, I don't think so. I think\nwhat you would have under these circumstances is merely\nthe final step, if you will, in the underlying unlawful\nactivity.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Beard, can't you give\nus something we can get this guy on?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. BEARD: I'm not comfortable doing that.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: He's carrying dirty money.\nIt even smells of drugs.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Can't we get him as an\naccessory to drug dealing or something? You say he has\nto walk?\nMR. BEARD: Well, Justice, I'm not\nuncomfortable with the notion of him walking, because\nI'm not uncomfortable with the notion you brought up\nearlier with that there may indeed be a gap. If there\nis a gap, then there's a remedy for that. But I think\nthat if --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The point -- the point\nabout aiding and abetting something, this money reeks of\nmarijuana, and that was very puzzling to me. Why this\nis the standard operating procedure to take this money\nand wrap it in containers that had contained the drug.\nSo when the police find it, they know it's drug money.\nMR. BEARD: Justice, I know that the --\ninitially the way this went down was the money that was\nin his pocket. That's what triggered the -- that's what\nthey said smelled like raw marijuana. And then\neventually, they found the drug money. And I can't tell\nyou why they did it this way. But I think that your\nquestion underscores they were concerned not with\nobfuscating any attributes, obviously, they were\nconcerned with getting this money back to repay the\nperson who had sent the drugs north under the\ngovernment's theory.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\n"
