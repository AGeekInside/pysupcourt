        "content": "(10:04 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument\nfirst this morning in Case 10-224, National Meat\nAssociation v. Harris.\nMr. Wells.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF STEVEN J. WELLS\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. WELLS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nCongress has unmistakably ordained that one\nset of rules govern animal handling and treatment,\ninspection, and determinations of meat quality for sale\nat federally inspected slaughterhouses from California\nto Maine, and those rules kick in at the slaughterhouse\ngate, and they continue through the sale of the meat by\nthe slaughterhouse. California has enacted its own set\nof rules regarding nonambulatory animals, rules which\nwere intended to be and are different than and in\naddition to the Federal rules regarding the handling of\nnonambulatory animals.\nWhere Federal law sets requirements for\nreceipt and allows for receipt if the -- if those rules\nare followed, California law bans receipt of the animals\naltogether.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What about purchase? What\nabout -- what about the contract to purchase? The\nCalifornia law addresses that. Do you -- do you contend\nthat that is pre-empted as well?\nMR. WELLS: We do, Your Honor. And --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: How so?\nMR. WELLS: Justice Scalia, the reason\nthat -- the reason that we do is because, to the extent\nthat purchase is -- is even relevant with respect to a\nfederally inspected slaughterhouse, I think all the\nparties agree that it occurs on or after the receipt;\nso, it's part of the operational process.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: What if it weren't? What if\nit took place at an auction site apart from the\nslaughterhouse?\nMR. WELLS: Well, Justice Kagan, I --\nbecause the scope of the FMIA starts at the gate of the\nslaughterhouse and ends with sale, California, I think,\ncould regulate and not -- not have its regulation be\nexpressly pre-empted if it attempted to prevent purchase\nbefore the purchase occurred.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Or contract of purchase. I\nmean, if the contract of purchase is made apart from the\nslaughterhouse itself, they could make it unlawful for\nthe -- the person who raises the animals to sell them\nwhen they're nonambulatory and unlawful for the\nslaughterhouse to contract to buy them, right, so long\nas the contract is off the premises?\nMR. WELLS: So long as the -- so long as the\ncontract -- so long as title didn't pass, Your Honor, or\nthe -- it didn't interfere with what happens on the\npremises from the gate through sale, then I believe that\nwould not be expressly pre-empted by --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Okay.\nMR. WELLS: -- by Federal law. There could\nbe implied pre-emption issues, however, in that\ncircumstance --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, your -- your\nposition is if the contract for purchase is consummated\nin some way on premises, that's pre-empted? And so,\nyour answer to Justice Kagan and Justice Scalia is that\nif the purchase contract occurs before the animals\narrive at the gate of the slaughterhouse, that that\nwould not be pre-empted?\nMR. WELLS: Not be expressly pre-empted.\nAgain, there may be implied pre-emption issues, but if\nthe law -- I think, Your Honor, if the law is intended\nto target --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, your whole\nargument is on express pre-emption.\nMR. WELLS: Yes, Your Honor. Absolutely\nright.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You've given up any\nargument on implied.\nMR. WELLS: Before -- we've not raised that\nargument before this Court. That's correct.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Please tell me why you\nthink the sale of the meat is expressly pre-empted. The\nSolicitor General says it's a closer question on sale of\nthe meat because the slaughterhouse processes -- the law\nis involved only with the operations and -- of the\npremises and manner of slaughtering and has nothing to\ndo with sales. So, why is the sale of the meat\npre-empted?\nMR. WELLS: Your Honor, sale is a -- it is a\npractical step. And the word \"operations\" as used in\n678, I think all the parties agree it encompasses all\nthe practical steps of the slaughterhouse. Sale clearly\nis the last practical step, to which all other practical\nsteps are directed. So, it is an operational step. It\nwould be news to the slaughterhouses that sales is not a\npart of their operations. That's --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, how about there's a\nlaw that says you can't slaughter cats, dogs, or horses,\nor you can't sell cats, dogs, or horses for slaughter?\nMR. WELLS: And, Your Honor, it would have\nto be --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Or for consumption.\nMR. WELLS: I'd have to put --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Is that pre-empted?\nMR. WELLS: It -- it would be. Well, with\nrespect to cats and dogs, the answer would be no,\nbecause those are not amenable species that are subject\nto inspection at a federally inspected slaughterhouse.\nSo, that's outside the scope of the FMIA.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Is there a Federal\nregulation to that effect?\nMR. WELLS: No -- yes. Only amenable\nspecies can be slaughtered. Amenable species are\ndefined at U.S.C. -- 21 U.S.C. section 601 subsection\n(w). And cats and dogs are not amenable species. So --\nJUSTICE ALITO: And what's that definition?\nMR. WELLS: Well, the definition is -- it's\nkind of a roundabout definition, Your Honor. Amenable\nspecies is -- mentions -- I mean, frankly, it mentions\ncatfish and -- and other species, and then all of the\nanimals which were amenable species prior to the\namendment of the Act in 2005. We set that forth in\nfootnote 11 of our -- our brief, but it clearly includes\nswine, and it includes -- it includes horses. It\nincludes cattle, obviously.\nJUSTICE ALITO: So, the Seventh Circuit\nand -- and I forget what the other circuit was -- were\nincorrect in saying that the -- that the State could\nprohibit the slaughter of horses?\nMR. WELLS: Yes, Your Honor. I believe they\nwere incorrect, although I would say that, even under\nthe rationale that the Fifth and Seventh Circuits used,\ntheir rationale would not save this State law. And the\nreason that it wouldn't is, even if you were to decide\nthat those -- those cases were decided correctly, the\nrationale that the court used was we can interpret those\nStates' laws in a way that the -- the laws never have to\naffect the operations of the slaughterhouse because we\ncan interpret those laws to keep the animals off the\nslaughterhouse -- off premises.\nIt's easy to identify what's a horse and\nkeep it off the premises. That's not true with\nnonambulatory animals. Nonambulatory animals present\nwith the symptom of nonambulatory-ness on the premises\nor on the trucks that are waiting to arrive on the\npremises. So, there is no way that this State law could\nbe interpreted in a way not to operate on premises.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, doesn't it seem\nstrange to hold that the Federal Meat Inspection Act\nspeaks to an issue like that? This doesn't have\nanything -- whether or not horses should be slaughtered\nand sold and their meat should be sold doesn't have\nanything to do with food safety, does it? And it\ndoesn't have anything to do with humane treatment,\nassuming the same methods of slaughter are used?\nMR. WELLS: Well, I would disagree, Your\nHonor. It clearly has to do -- this issue clearly has\nto do with both of those issues. As the State has\nadmitted on page 6 of its brief, this law was intended\nto address both -- both humane handling of animals,\nwhich is covered directly in section 603(b) of the -- of\nthe Federal --\nJUSTICE ALITO: No, I wasn't speaking of the\nCalifornia law. I was speaking of the law that\nprohibits the -- the slaughter of horses --\nMR. WELLS: Well--\nJUSTICE ALITO: That's based just on a\njudgment, a societal judgment, that this is an animal\nthat should not be slaughtered and sold for food. What\ndoes that have to do with any of the purposes of the\nFederal Meat Inspection Act?\nMR. WELLS: Well, because Congress has made\na different -- a different judgment, Justice Alito; and\nwhat Congress has said is we have identified -- we,\nCongress, have made a moral judgment that the following\nspecies are amenable and may be inspected on\nslaughterhouse premises. And to the extent that the\nState is making a different moral judgment --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And that presumably is why\nCongress excluded cats and dogs?\nMR. WELLS: That -- Congress -- correct.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So, Lassie -- Lassie and\nKitty are no good?\nMR. WELLS: Congress made a moral judgment\nthat --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But Dobbin is all right.\nMR. WELLS: I believe that's right, Your\nHonor. It's a moral -- it is a moral judgment by\nCongress as to which animals are going to be amenable\nfor slaughter and which ones aren't.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Young, you suggested\nthat even if the Seventh Circuit was correct, there\nwould still be a difference because of ease of\nidentification. You can tell a horse is a horse and\nkeep the horse away from the slaughterhouse. Would it\nbe possible to say the same thing about nonambulatory\nswine? And I guess my question is, do nonambulatory\nswine usually become nonambulatory in transit or at the\nslaughterhouse, or could you identify such swine\nearlier?\nMR. WELLS: They -- nonambulatory swine\nbecome nonambulatory -- may become nonambulatory in\ntransit. They may become nonambulatory on the\nslaughterhouse premises. The only way that the\nslaughterhouse operator knows that an -- that an animal\nthat has been transported has become nonambulatory,\nhowever, is when the truck is brought onto the premises,\nthe gates are thrown open, and the animals are\nshepherded off, and one of them doesn't move.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But I guess the -- the\nState could make it unlawful for a rancher or -- what\nare the people that ship the animals to you called?\nCould it --\nMR. WELLS: Could be a rancher or a farmer.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: A rancher or farmer could\nmake it unlawful for them to ship a nonambulatory swine,\ncould they not?\nMR. WELLS: Your Honor, Congress actually\nhas enacted regulations that don't -- they don't apply\nto slaughterhouses because, again, the scope with\nrespect to slaughterhouses started at the slaughterhouse\ngate.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but as far as this\nstatute is concerned, it would not preclude a State law\nthat forbids a -- a rancher to -- to ship a\nnonambulatory swine, right?\nMR. WELLS: That's correct. There are\nFederal -- I should point out, there are Federal\nregulations that govern the transportation of dead,\ndying, and diseased animals. They don't apply to\nslaughterhouses. They may apply in the situation that\nYour Honor is contemplating.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I would have thought\nthat your argument on sales would apply at the front end\nas well. You say sales can't be regulated because it's\nreally just a way to get to the regulation of what goes\non at the slaughterhouse. Wouldn't that concern also\napply at the front end?\nMR. WELLS: Well, Your Honor, our argument\nabout sale is slightly different, and it's a little\ndifferent than the argument that's being made by the\nGovernment. Our argument with respect to sale is there\nare requirements specifically regulating sale. That's\nfound in 21 U.S.C. section 610(c). That says,\nessentially, meat may not be sold if it is adulterated,\nor, to put it another way, you may sell the meat if it's\nunadulterated. So, that's a requirement. It's within\nthe scope of the FMIA. It -- it goes directly to sales\nas an operation.\nAnd it is different than and in addition to\nthe State regulation because what the State -- the State\nadds another condition. They say you may not sell the\nmeat if it is from a nonambulatory animal, or, looked at\nthe other way, you may sell the meat as long as it's not\nfrom a nonambulatory animal.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that -- isn't\nthat logically not -- doesn't that logically not follow?\nYou may not sell meat if it's been adulterated doesn't\nmean that you can sell meat so long as it's not been\nadulterated; right?\nMR. WELLS: Well, no. I think --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: One is a limitation,\nnot a grant.\nMR. WELLS: Well, I think, though, that\nthere were -- I think that -- the Federal -- what the\nFederal Government has done is established a requirement\nfor the sale of meat. California has established\nanother requirement for the sale of meat.\nUnder Federal law, one requirement for the\nsale of meat is that it not be adulterated, that it pass\nthrough inspection, that it be stamped \"USDA approved,\"\nall the conditions that happen at a slaughterhouse. The\nState, though, has set forth a different condition, and\nthat is you may not sell that meat unless it comes from\na nonambulatory animal --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, isn't it the case that\nmost nonambulatory animals become nonambulatory because\nof the method of transportation that's used? Do you\ndispute the statistics in the brief of the non-State\nRespondent that -- Respondents that, nationwide,\napproximately 220,000 swine die during transport,\nanother 440,000 become nonambulatory during the\ntransportation process?\nMR. WELLS: I don't -- Your Honor, the short\nanswer is I don't know where those statistics come from,\nand to my knowledge they are not accurate. But I don't\nhave additional statistics to --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Do you dispute the fact that\nthe reason -- that ranchers generally do not ship\nanimals that are nonambulatory at the time when the trip\nbegins, but that most of these nonambulatory animals\nbecome nonambulatory during the transportation process?\nMR. WELLS: I think that is a fair\nassumption, Your Honor, with respect to pigs that\npresent being nonambulatory when -- when the doors to\nthe -- to the truck are opened. I think that that's\ncorrect. I think that the practice is not to ship\nnonambulatory animals if you know beforehand that they\nare nonambulatory.\nJUSTICE ALITO: And you think it's difficult\nto identify which animals are nonambulatory? That's the\ndifference between horses -- between prohibiting the\nslaughter of horses, because you can tell whether it's a\nhorse or a pig, but you can't tell whether a pig can\nwalk?\nMR. WELLS: No. It isn't the only\ndifference, Your Honor. Really, it -- the -- what I'm\nreally saying is the -- the condition of being\nnonambulatory presents on the slaughterhouse premises.\nAnd so, there is no way for a law to -- no way for us to\nsay the California law can be interpreted in a way that\nwill not tell a Federal slaughterhouse what to do and --\nand how to do it with respect to nonambulatory animals.\nThat's not true in the horse case. In the horse case,\nyou can say keep the horses out. The -- the Federal\nslaughterhouse doesn't have to have anything to do with\nhorses. So --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Would it be possible --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Can you tell me, if it's\nokay for California to say you can't sell a\nnonambulatory animal and that that applies to everyone\noff the slaughterhouse premises, is that -- that's\nbasically your position. So that if the purchase occurs\non premises, then the person who's selling it, even if\nit's not the slaughterhouse, can still sell it on the\npremises?\nMR. WELLS: If I understand your question,\nYour Honor, if the -- if, let's say just for the\nshorthand, if title passes on the premises, if that's\nhow it's understood in the industry and that's what it\nis, that would be pre-empted. But if the law took\neffect --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What a -- what a\nfascinating area of immunity. Now what we're saying to\nauction houses and everyone else is don't pass title\nuntil you get to the slaughterhouse.\nMR. WELLS: Well, Your Honor, it's just -- I\nmean, I think the -- the real question is what has the\nFederal Government said about nonambulatory animals in\ngeneral, and are those amenable species and may they\nbe -- may they be slaughtered and turned into food? And\nthe Federal regulations deal directly with that\nsituation. So, whether title passes before or after, if\nthe animal is on the Federal premises, there are a whole\nseries of Federal regulations that tell the\nslaughterhouse worker exactly what the worker is\nsupposed to do with that animal.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Does that mean that a State\ncould actually pass a law and create a facility, let's\nsay, that says -- the law says the trucks have to stop\nat the State facility before it gets to the\nslaughterhouse, and at the State facility, we'll check\nto see whether there are nonambulatory animals and make\nsure that those animals don't go on to the\nslaughterhouse? Would a State be within its rights to\ndo that?\nMR. WELLS: Your Honor, the language of\nsection 603(a) says that the inspection is to occur\nbefore they enter the slaughterhouse. Now, that has\nbeen interpreted by the Secretary to essentially mean\nimmediately before; so -- so, trucks in line.\nSo, I think, under -- on Your Honor's\nhypothetical, if the State had set up their own\ninspection program right immediately outside of a -- of\na federally inspected slaughterhouse, that currently\nwould be within the scope of the FMIA, because that's\nhow the Secretary has defined it. The further upstream\nit goes, though, the -- the less likely it is to be\nexpressly pre-empted.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, if they do it at the\nweigh station that a truck has to stop at when it enters\nthe State, that would be okay?\nMR. WELLS: That would not be expressly\npre-empted, Your Honor. There might be implied\npre-emption issues.\nAnd if there are no further questions, I'd\nlike to reserve my remaining time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Horwich.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF BENJAMIN J. HORWICH\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,\nAS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER\nMR. HORWICH: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nI haven't heard any quarrel this morning\nwith the proposition that if an animal goes down, say,\nas it's entering the abattoir to be slaughtered, that\nthe State cannot at that point tell the slaughterhouse\nhow it is to handle that animal.\nBut that is not any different, of course,\nthan the situation where a pig goes down as it's coming\noff the truck, or it presents as nonambulatory when the\ngates of the truck are opened, because it's still an\noperational consideration; the same humane handling\nrequirements still apply; it's still a State\nrequirement; and it's not -- it's still different from\nthe Federal requirements.\nSo, the Court's questions this morning, I\nthink, have gone to kind of the situations at the\nmargins, at the extreme. So, let me try to -- try to\naddress some of those questions.\nThe -- the question about whether -- the\nquestion about the purchase of the nonambulatory animal\nand the regulation, the regulation there, the first\nthing is, as a practical matter, I think you have to\nthink about it in a concrete situation, which is that\nthere is a nonambulatory animal that's on the\nslaughterhouse premises. That's the hypothetical that\nwe're in. And the question is, what is the\nslaughterhouse employee to do with that animal? And the\nState law says, well, you can't buy it, you can't hold\nit, you can't receive it, you can't turn it into meat,\nand you have to immediately euthanize it.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, before you get to that\npoint, the animal has to be transported. Does Federal\nlaw regulate for humane purposes the transportation of\nanimals to slaughterhouses?\nMR. HORWICH: There are Federal laws\nregarding transportation. The Federal Meat Inspection\nAct has not been interpreted by the Secretary to apply\nspecifically to trucks that are in transit, although I\nshould say that the Secretary has, for example,\ninterpreted the FMIA -- and this is in part 309.1(b) --\nto apply, at least to the extent of humane handling, to\npens at stockyards that are committed exclusively to a\nslaughterhouse.\nAnd I think if there were a situation such\nas I think, Justice Kagan, your hypothetical envisioned,\nwhere a State determined that it wanted to essentially\nassert an inspection jurisdiction over animals that were\nin transit to a slaughterhouse -- so, essentially\nbetween the pen and the slaughterhouse -- the Secretary\nmight well recognize that -- that his authority needs to\nextend -- needs to extend to those, because the purpose\nof the Act, after all, is to set a Federal inspection\nstandard for animals to determine if they're suitable to\nbe turned into meat. And in your --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, if the Federal -- if\nCongress has not chosen to regulate the transportation\nof animals to prevent inhumane treatment in transit, why\nshould a State law that aims at that objective be\npre-empted?\nMR. HORWICH: Well, if you -- if you\ndisagree with -- if you disagree with me about the scope\nof the FMIA in that regard, the State law with respect\nto the handling of the animals while they're in transit\nwouldn't be pre-empted. But, of course, the injunction\nthat I understand Petitioners to be seeking is not one\nthat goes to State regulation of trucks but, rather, to\nState regulation of animals that are on the\nslaughterhouse premises. And the Secretary has made\nunmistakably clear that the scope of the FMIA is at\nleast as large as the official slaughter establishment's\npremises.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, if the State could\ninspect the trucks at a weigh station before they get to\nthe slaughterhouse, why can't they do the same thing\nwhen they get to the slaughterhouse, where it's more\npractical to do that?\nMR. HORWICH: Well, accepting the premise of\nyour hypothetical that the State could do the inspection\non the truck --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Do you dispute -- you\ndispute that?\nMR. HORWICH: I dispute that, but I'll\naccept that premise. Even if I accept that premise, the\nquestion here is different because the Secretary has\ndrawn a line that says the scope of the FMIA -- and\nthat's -- the question is the scope of Federal law here.\nThat's in section 678. The Secretary has made very\nclear that the scope of the FMIA extends to -- to all\nanimals that are on the premises of the establishment.\nThat's -- you can look at appendix --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So, is there anything\nsaved to the State? I mean, there is a savings clause.\nOnce you get to the entrance to the slaughterhouse, is\nthere any room for any State regulation?\nMR. HORWICH: Absolutely, Justice Ginsburg.\nI mean, State laws of general applicability would, to\nthe extent they don't in some particular application\nintrude into the scope of the FMIA, they would apply.\nAnd I also want to be very clear, so that\nthere's no mistaking the Government's position: State\nprosecutions for animal cruelty are not pre-empted to\nthe extent they are prosecuting conduct that is unlawful\nunder Federal law, because that is -- that is an example\nof a State that is not applying a different or an\nadditional standard of conduct but simply adding --\napplying its own sanction for conduct that Federal law\nwould similarly sanction. So, there's absolutely room\nfor State -- the application of State law on the\npremises of the slaughterhouse.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: In that respect, do State\ninspectors routinely go on the premises of\nslaughterhouse to ensure that their coextensive laws are\nproperly enforced? And if that's so, are there problems\nof judgment, that a Federal inspector says, no, this is\nokay under Federal law, and the State official says, no,\nthis is not okay under the State law, even though they\nsay the same thing?\nMR. HORWICH: I'm -- I am not aware that in\ngeneral State inspectors or other State officials would\ngo to a federally inspected premises as a general\nmatter. But let's assume for the sake of argument that\nthey were, and then your question -- excuse me --\npresents the question about these sort of differences in\njudgment that might be made. The Federal regulations\ngenerally provide that the disposition made by\nveterinarians, by Federal veterinarians, is the\nconclusive judgment of the Secretary as to the fitness\nof the animal for turning into meat. And so, in that\nsituation, the State official would not be able to reach\na different judgment on that question. And so, I -- so,\nI think that would resolve any situation where State\nofficials were there.\nOf course, the situation where State\nofficials do inspections is the one that the Act itself\nenvisions and that California has not taken the\nopportunity to implement, which is for intrastate-only\nplants, States can enact their own inspection\nregulations and have their own inspectors there as long\nas they're following Federal standards at a minimum.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What am I supposed to do --\nI have a quick procedural question, which I think is\nsimilar to Justice Ginsburg's. Suppose this is three\nsections, the State law, and some of them have three\nparts. Suppose I thought, well, the word \"buy\" -- I\nmean, \"buy\" might cover an awful lot of things that\ndon't have much to do with operations. Maybe sometimes\nthey do. Suppose I ended up thinking that, but I\nthought you were right about all the rest of it. What\nam I supposed to do?\nMR. HORWICH: Well, I would like to have an\nopportunity to take issue with your premise. But the\nanswer your question --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, no, no. I'm just doing\nthat hypothetically.\nMR. HORWICH: Yes. Yes. The answer to your\nquestion is this case comes here on preliminary\ninjunction; so, I think the Court could appropriately\narticulate its answer and its understanding of the\ndifferent provisions, and that probably would then lead\nto the lower courts working out the particulars of the\ninjunction.\nBut let me actually make a point in that\nregard about what the injunction might or might not look\nlike with respect to the buying provision, which is that\nI don't understand the State to have some free-floating\ninterest in when title does or doesn't pass. The State\nis interested in regulating what animals can be\npurchased because of a background principle of State law\nthat I assume exists, that slaughterhouses can't\nslaughter things they don't own.\nAnd if you put those two pieces together,\nthe ban on buying is nothing -- is nothing but doing in\ntwo steps what the State clearly can't do in one step,\nwhich is tell slaughterhouses how they are to deal with\nan animal that is on their premises. At least, they\ncan't -- States can't tell slaughterhouses how to do\nthat when there is a Federal regulation on the subject.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Do we have to peel this\nonion in order to decide this case? I mean, do we have\nto go through --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- each little provision of\nthe statute and say this is in, this is out, this is in,\nthis is out?\nMR. HORWICH: Well, I have --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Can't we just either affirm\nor reverse the particular preliminary injunction that\nwas -- that was issued here?\nMR. HORWICH: I think the Court could --\ncould do that, although I think there's some concern\nthat if the Court were to find -- to have some concern\nwith some specific aspect of the injunction -- and I\nguess I would let Petitioner's counsel speak to this --\nthere would be some concern that vacating the injunction\nso that it could be corrected would leave the -- the\nPetitioner in a spot where it wouldn't have protection\nfrom the vast majority of provisions --\nJUSTICE BREYER: But what I discover is\nthere are at least 11 different provisions in this, and\nI have exactly Justice Scalia's question. Do we have to\nwrite an 11-part opinion where we treat each of these\ndifferent things, which are different, separately and\nanalyze it? I'm not trying to get out of the work. I\njust want to know.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. HORWICH: Well, I think -- I think the\nCourt --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I'd like to get out of the\nwork, to tell you the truth.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. HORWICH: The right way to get out of\nthe work would be to understand that -- that California\nhas made every effort here to implement a provision\nthat -- to implement one underlying requirement, which\nis that it wants to tell slaughterhouses: Don't turn\nthese animals into food; immediately euthanize them\ninstead. And the rest of these are just ways of\nimplementing that underlying requirement. And this\nanswers your question --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Suppose we agree with you\nabout that. We say, if I agree with you about that,\nthere we are; you're supposed to pick up this animal\nwhich is on the slaughterhouse floor and kill it right\naway. That seems to have to do with operations. All\nthe rest of these other 10 provisions are just\nvariations on that theme, according to the Government,\nand we send it back for them to argue this out below.\nMR. HORWICH: If there would be anything\nleft to argue out below at that point. I think --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, there are 10 other\nparts. There are 10 other parts.\nMR. HORWICH: Well, there are the 10 parts,\nbut I actually want to answer -- well --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You want to give a\none-sentence answer?\nMR. HORWICH: I think I can.\n-- Justice Sotomayor's question, which is\nthe question about the sale of the meat, which, again, I\nthink fits under the rubric that it's just implementing\nthe underlying prohibition that California seeks here.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMs. Smith.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF SUSAN K. SMITH\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMS. SMITH: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nIn order to be pre-empted here, the State\nprovisions have to be -- excuse me -- the State law\nprovisions have to be within the scope of the Act and\nwith respect to the premises, facilities, and\noperations. None of the State provisions are within the\nscope, and some are not even operations.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How do you define the\nscope?\nMS. SMITH: The scope are the -- the\nmandates of Federal law dealing with the method,\nquality, and marketing of turning animals into meat for\nhuman consumption.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. So, now\nexplain how under your definition it's not among at\nleast one of those.\nMS. SMITH: None of the provisions are\nwithin the scope because California is not regulating\nanimals that are going to be turned into meat. And the\nFederal Meat Inspection Act, the purpose of the Act, the\nlegislative history of the Act, show that the scope of\nthe Act is concerned with animals that are going to\nbecome meat.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Well, is that true, Ms.\nSmith? I thought that under the Federal program some of\nthese animals could become meat, that under the Federal\nprogram, you take a nonambulatory animal and you say,\nwell, some of them might be condemned, but some of them\nare suspect, and if they're only suspect, it may be that\neventually they'll be turned into meat.\nMS. SMITH: That is correct. But the entire\npurpose of the Act is to inspect and examine animals to\ndetermine whether or not their meat will be wholesome\nand unadulterated.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, no. No. Provisions\nof the Act, at least as amended, also require humane\ntreatment of the animals while they're being processed.\nThat has nothing to do with whether the meat is any\ngood. It has to do with humane treatment of the\nanimals.\nMS. SMITH: The humane treatment of the\nanimals deals with animals in the connection of\nslaughter or while being slaughtered. And the animals\nthat California is regulating, the nonambulatory animals\nthat we're withdrawing from the process, will not be\nslaughtered, will not be turned into meat. Even the --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Wait. I don't -- you mean\nthe Federal requirements of humane treatment do not\napply once the slaughterhouse decides that this animal\nwill not be slaughtered for meat; then the\nslaughterhouse can do whatever it wants with the poor\nanimal? That can't be right.\nMS. SMITH: Well, the language of the\nregulations -- of the Federal regulations dealing with\nU.S. condemned animals, for instance, say that U.S.\ncondemned animals shall be killed and shall not be\nslaughtered and dressed in the same facility with\nanimals that will be turned into meat. So, even in the\nregulations there's a distinction between animals that\nwill be slaughtered for meat and that will be edible and\nones that are -- are condemned and will be killed.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What about the provision\nthat says that they will not be exposed to sharp --\nsharp instruments that can injure them? Does that apply\nto only those that are going to be sold for meat?\nMS. SMITH: It applies to -- well,\nspecifically the provisions in the Federal Meat\nInspection Act apply to the animals that are going to be\nturned into meat. To the extent they apply to other\nanimals or all animals as has been referenced, they\nwould be pursuant -- those provisions would be pursuant\nto the Humane Methods of Slaughter Act, which is -- does\nnot have a pre-emption clause and does not --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, wait, no. But that\nAct amends, amends, the Act that does have a pre-emption\nclause.\nMS. SMITH: Correct.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And, therefore, it seems to\nme the pre-emption clause applies to the humane\nprovisions as well.\nMS. SMITH: It applies to the humane\nprovisions with animals -- with respect to the animals\nin connection with slaughter and that will be\nslaughtered, with respect to the Federal Meat Inspection\nAct. Because the Humane Methods of Slaughter Act was\nnot incorporated into the Federal Meat Inspection Act,\nit does not have an express pre-emption clause, and\nthere's no language in the text of that Act, the Humane\nMethods Act, or in the legislative history showing that\nit was an attempt to federalize animal cruelty law, for\ninstance. So, the idea that --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Just in slaughterhouses. I\nmean, to the extent it's incorporated in that Act, it\nonly applies to humane treatment by slaughterhouses,\nright?\nMS. SMITH: Correct. 603 and 610 of the\nFederal Meat Inspection Act reference the Humane Methods\nAct and reference that that is to be applied when the\nanimals are in the -- being processed in the connection\nwith slaughter and being slaughtered. So, again, it\nis -- it is limited to the animals that -- that are\ngoing to become meat under the Federal Meat Inspection\nAct.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But they don't --\nyou don't know whether they're going to become meat\nuntil after the Federal process of post-mortem\ninspection and all of that. And your rules seem to\nprohibit that.\nMS. SMITH: Our rules -- well, the ante-\nmortem inspection and post-mortem inspection are\nrequired of animals that are going to be turned into\nmeat, correct. And our -- the California law does not\ntouch on post-mortem inspection at all. And only in the\ncase -- excuse me. And the -- as far as --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, but I mean\nyour -- your argument up to this point has been that\nthis doesn't interfere with the Federal laws because the\nFederal laws are designed only to deal with meat that is\nfor consumption. And you say with your -- with respect\nto your animals, that's not what it is.\nBut here, as I understand the Petitioner's\nand the Government's position, it is that nonambulatory\nanimals can be turned into meat for consumption. So,\nyou don't know whether it fits under the definition of\nthe State law until you've violated it.\nMS. SMITH: No, because when an animal\nbecomes nonambulatory, it is readily apparent. That's a\ncharacteristic that is readily apparent. And in -- at\nleast in California, when the animal becomes\nnonambulatory, the requirement would be to immediately\neuthanize the animal because it's not part of the meat\nsupply system.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: But that's exactly where the\nCalifornia system diverges from the Federal system\nbecause under the Federal system you separate the animal\nout, and then you take a look at it, and then you decide\nwhether that animal can continue to go through the\nprocess and eventually become meat, or whether you\neuthanize it. So, the California system commands an\naction that the Federal system say may be necessary but\nmay not be.\nMS. SMITH: It commands an action, but it's\nnot within the scope of the Act because at the very\noutset California is saying that these animals are not\nto be part of the meat supply system in California.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, but --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Where the Federal system has\nsaid maybe they should be part of the meat supply\nsystem.\nMS. SMITH: They may be part of the meat\nsupply system, but it's not required. It's not --\nnonambulatory animals are not --\nJUSTICE BREYER: But in any case, it's --\nlook, this is a simple question that occurs. I am an\ninspector at a federally inspected meat facility. I\nlook around, and there is a -- a cow and it's lying\ndown. All right? It seems to me that your law says I\nhave to go over and see that it is immediately\neuthanized.\nNow, how is that not what is forbidden, a\nrequirement -- the exact words are -- \"in addition to or\ndifferent from the Federal requirements governing the\noperations of that Federal meatpacking facility.\"\nThe Federal law does not require me\nimmediately to go over and euthanize the cow. Your law\ndoes require me to go over and immediately euthanize the\ncow. And, therefore, your law seems an additional\nrequirement in respect to the operations of a -- a\nfederally inspected meatpacking facility. Now, that\nseems to me the obvious, simple argument that people\nhave been making, and I would like to know your obvious,\nsimple answer.\nMS. SMITH: Certainly, Your Honor. The\neuthanization is an operation of the slaughterhouse.\nBut it's -- but this -- California's provision is not\nwithin the scope. And pursuant to 678, to be expressly\npre-empted, it has to be within the scope and with\nrespect to operations.\nSo, with respect to that provision, the\neuthanization provision, we concede that it is -- it is\npart of the operations. But it is not within the scope\nbecause we're dealing with an animal that California has\ndeemed as not part -- as -- excuse me --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I understood that the\nFederal regulation -- you can correct me if I'm\nmisunderstanding -- is that if there is a suspect animal\nof any kind, that it requires a slaughterhouse to wait\nuntil the Federal inspector comes and finds out whether\nit's just suspect or it's something that can't be sold.\nAnd the reason why the inspection occurs, as\nI understand it, is that there are some diseases that\nare so contagious that if the inspector decides that\nthat animal is carrying that disease, that the whole lot\nwill be quarantined or otherwise destroyed. So, are you\nfighting with -- that that's what the purpose of\npre-inspection under the Federal system is for?\nMS. SMITH: The distinction I would make,\nYour Honor, is that the purpose of the ante-mortem\ninspection is to determine if the -- if the animal's\nmeat will be wholesome and unadulterated. To the extent\nthat the pre-inspection or the inspection also finds\ndiseases that can be passed on to other animals or -- or\nto the rest of the herd, that's -- that's certainly a\nbenefit, but it's not part of the purpose of the Federal\nMeat Inspection Act.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm having a hard time\ndrawing that distinction. If there is a valid purpose\nto the pre-mortem inspection -- and I can't see how you\ncan argue otherwise -- that there may be some diseases\nthat are so contagious that the entire lot, ambulatory\nor nonambulatory swine, are affected, then I don't see\nhow you can argue that you aren't trenching on the scope\nof the statute. If the scope of the statute is to\nensure that meat is unadulterated and if there is the\nrisk of contagion, that has to be within the scope.\nMS. SMITH: Two points. One, the diseases\nthat were referenced by the amicus dealing with this are\ndiseases that will be passed to the animals, not to\nhumans.\nAnd the second point is that the -- the\npurpose, again, of the Act as specified in 602 is to\nmake sure that the meat of the animal is wholesome and\nunadulterated. And the ante-mortem inspection will\noccur for every animal that goes into the meat supply\nsystem.\nSo, if California withdraws a nonambulatory\nanimal, it doesn't receive the ante-mortem inspection,\nit's not going into the meat supply system. But all of\nthe other animals in that pen that are ambulatory,\npursuant to the Federal law, will receive that\nante-mortem inspection and will, by the inspector or the\nveterinarian, be declared disease free or not. So, they\nwill find -- they will be able to find those diseases in\nthe ambulatory animals and the ones that are going into\nthe meat supply system.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: So, I suppose what you're\nsaying, Ms. Smith, is that California or any State is\nentitled to take certain categories of animals outside\nof the whole process, to exclude certain categories of\nanimals from the whole process and so to exclude them,\nif you will, from of the scope of this chapter. And\nmuch as the Seventh Circuit said a State can simply\nexclude horses from the scope of this statute, you're\nsaying a State can exclude nonambulatory swine from the\nscope of this statute.\nBut then you have to, you know, ask yourself\nthe question: Are nonambulatory swine so easily\nexcludable as horses? Why couldn't the State then\nexclude swine with various kinds of diseases? And then\nit would be clear that the State was doing something\nthat the Federal statute is supposed to be doing.\nMS. SMITH: Your Honor, if your question is,\nwould that be pre-empted if California excluded pursuant\nto other diseases, it would not be expressly pre-empted.\nSo, California can make decisions on categories of\nanimals, here nonambulatory swine, and the -- it would\nnot be expressly pre-empted. There may be questions\nabout conflict pre-emption, but in this particular case,\nconflict pre-emption was litigated in the Ninth Circuit,\nand the Ninth Circuit found that there was no conflict\npre-emption.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it's an additional\nrequirement. I don't know why it's conflict\npre-emption. It's express pre-emption. If indeed the\nFederal regulations say that these diseases disqualify\nthe animal from being slaughtered and sold as meat, and\nCalifornia says no, we think additional diseases should\ndisqualify the slaughter and sale, that's an additional\nrequirement. I don't know how you say that's somehow\nconflict pre-emption. It's express pre-emption.\nMS. SMITH: It's not expressly pre-empted\nbecause it's not within the scope, because California is\nnot putting requirements on animals --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You keep saying \"not within\nthe scope.\" I don't know what you mean by \"not within\nthe scope.\" Why is it not within the scope?\nMS. SMITH: Because the scope of the Federal\nMeat Inspection Act does not include every animal on the\npremises of a slaughterhouse. It's limited by the\nlanguage of the -- of the text of the Federal Meat\nInspection Act and the authority given to the Secretary.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Right, and what -- what\nlimits it? What enables the State to disqualify other\ndiseases that the Federal law does not disqualify?\nMS. SMITH: California would -- there's no\nrequirement in -- there's nothing in the text of the\nFederal Act that specifies that States cannot withdraw\nanimals based --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: \"No additional\nrequirements\" is what the Act says.\nMS. SMITH: Correct. But that is -- no\nadditional requirements going to animals that are going\nto become meat. If California -- if California had a --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it doesn't say that.\nIt says \"no additional requirements\" with respect to all\nof the operations, both the operations that pertain to\nthose animals that are later sold as meat and the\noperations that pertain to those animals that are\nslaughtered and whose carcasses are burned or disposed\nof. How do you get the limitation to only those animals\nthat are -- that are slaughtered for meat?\nMS. SMITH: Because it's also within the\nscope. Within the scope is part of the -- of the -- of\n678. The express pre-emption clause references within\nthe scope of the chapter with respect to premises,\nfacilities, and operations. So, there -- the scope of\nthe chapter must be considered in terms of what the\npurpose is, what the language of the text allows the\nFederal Government --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, your argument is\nthat because the Act doesn't speak to whether or not\ncats and dogs and horses can be sold as meat, you can\nalso say it's not within the scope because it doesn't\nspeak to specifically whether nonambulatory animals can\nbe sold as meat or not.\nMS. SMITH: Correct, and since, Mr. Chief\nJustice --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that seems to\nme -- what you're saying then with respect to animals\nthat are slaughtered in a slaughterhouse is that the\ndifference is that the State law says you can't sell\nthat as meat while the Federal law says you can. Right?\nIn other words, you're saying, well, just because the\nFederal law says you can doesn't mean that the State\ncan't say you can't.\nMS. SMITH: Correct.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Correct? Well,\nisn't the exact flip side of saying you can sell it is\nthat -- that you can't sell it is that you can. So,\nwhen the Federal law says you can, that pre-empts the\nrule from the States that says you can't.\nMS. SMITH: Well, the Federal law doesn't\nsay you must. It does not say you must sell the meat or\nyou must --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But we're not talking about\nconflict pre-emption. If it said you must and the State\nsays you can't, then there would be conflict\npre-emption. But we're talking about express\npre-emption, which says in so many words no additional\nrequirements. And I don't know how you can get around\nthe fact that this is an additional requirement.\nMS. SMITH: Because the \"no additional\nrequirements\" has to be qualified within the scope of\nthe Act.\nJUSTICE BREYER: It does, you're right.\nYou're right. I see where you're going. It says we're\ntalking about regulations that are within the scope of\nthe Act. But I have assumed that that means we're not\ntalking about airplanes; we're talking about the subject\nmatter of the Act. And so, is this the kind of\nregulation that is within the subject matter of the Act?\nAnd it seems to be. It has to do with how you slaughter\nanimals. It has to -- I mean, if you're going to be so\nspecific as you say the only things that are within the\nscope of the Act are the specific requirements that are\nthere already in the Federal Act, then this prohibition\nagainst extra regulations means nothing.\nI mean, it can't mean that. So, it just\nmeans the subject matter. And now, if it means the\nsubject matter, then why don't you lose?\nMS. SMITH: This -- well, even if one looks\nat the subject matter instead of the scope of the Act --\nJUSTICE BREYER: What do you mean, instead\nof? What is the scope of the Act? Are you saying the\nscope of the Act refers only to those particular\nprovisions that are already in the Act, requirements\nalready there?\nMS. SMITH: Yes, the scope of the Act --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes? Then why did they put\nin something saying you can't add anything?\nMS. SMITH: Because the \"in addition to\" is\nqualified by on the -- with respect to the premises,\nfacilities, and operations and within the scope of the\nAct.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But you define the scope\nalmost exclusively by purpose. And regulatory power is\nbroader than purpose, I mean, as is reflected by the\nregulations here which are dealing not merely with\nanimals that are adulterated but are dealing with the\nwhole process of what happens from the minute they\narrive to the minute they're sold. So, if we don't\naccept your limitation based on a scope being defined by\npurpose, how do you win?\nMS. SMITH: If one looks at the authority\ngiven to the Secretary as well in 621, the authority is\nspecified as dealing with -- or making sure that no\nadulterated meat or any carcass, part of carcass, meat\nfood product therefor is not adulterated. So, the focus\nin 621 on the Secretary's authority is on making sure\nthat -- that the meat is not adulterated. So -- so,\nit's not simply the -- the purpose of the Act at 602 but\nalso the scope of the authority given to the Secretary.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, you seem to be\nassuming that in effecting its obligations that only\nwhen it finds adulterated meat is that within the -- the\nscope. The Government has basically said: We've got to\nfigure out if it is, and this is how we're going to do\nit: We're going to do it starting from the receipt of\nthe swine through its sale, and we're going to have\ninspections all through the process, whether or not the\nmeat will ultimately be sold or not; our scope is what\nhappens in that slaughterhouse. That --\nMS. SMITH: Correct. But the -- the focus\nof the Secretary's authority, as well as the specified\npurpose of the Act, is focused on not all animals, but\nanimals that will eventually become meat and making a\ndetermination, by inspections or examinations, whether\nor not -- whether or not those swine or those meat will\nbe wholesome and not adulterated.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I -- I didn't see your\nargument, and now I see it. Okay. So, I understand\nwhere you're going.\nBut then if I look at section 610 of the\nAct, it has a whole bunch of prohibitions, including\nprohibitions and references to how you slaughter\nanimals, and including how you slaughter animals\nhumanely. So, there, how do you say that this provision\nwhich talks about euthanizing an animal that you look\naround and it's lying down -- how is that not within the\nscope of the Act? I'm not saying that they have that\nparticular thing, but the subject matter, slaughtering\nanimals, indeed humanely, is something the Act\nabsolutely deals with.\nMS. SMITH: It -- as I mentioned earlier,\nit's certainly part of the operations. Euthanization\nis --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, I didn't say that. I\nsaid yes, it's part of the operations, but also it's the\nsubject matter with which the Act deals. The Act deals\nwith the humane slaughter of animals and other forms of\nslaughter of animals. So, how -- how is -- so, I repeat\nmy question.\nMS. SMITH: It deals with animals in\nconnection with slaughter and that will be slaughtered.\nAnd so, to the extent that that -- that slaughter is\nseen as an animal that is going towards the meat supply\nsystem, as opposed to one that's condemned and being\nkilled and not -- not --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay. I see. That's what\nyou said before --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't think that's what\nwithin the scope means. The pre-emption provision here\nin the statute has two provisions. The first one, which\nis the one we're talking about, says requirements within\nthe scope of this chapter with respect to premises,\nfacilities, and operations which are in addition to or\ndifferent than those made under this chapter may not be\nimposed. That's the first one. Okay? Requirements\nwithin the scope with respect to premises, facilities.\nNow, the second pre-emption provision reads:\n\"marking, labeling, packaging, or ingredient\nrequirements in addition to, or different than, those\nmade under this chapter.\" Now, I read the difference\nbetween those two being, under number two it has to be\ndifferent from something that has been made; whereas\nunder number one, it just has to be different from\nanything that could have been made under this chapter.\nIt's within the scope of the chapter. It's\nwithin the Secretary's authority to prescribe under this\nchapter. I think that's what Congress meant by the\ndifference between requirements within the scope and, in\nnumber two, \"in addition to, or different than, those\nmade,\" and that to my mind is -- is a much more\nplausible explanation of \"within the scope\" than -- you\nknow, it's directed to the purpose of -- of the statute.\nI don't think within the scope has anything\nto do with the purpose. It has to do with whether the\nSecretary is authorized to act in this field under the\nchapter.\nMS. SMITH: And as -- as I mentioned, the\nSecretary is given several -- at several different\npoints authority to act under this chapter, and the\nSecretary's authority is -- is circumscribed to making\nsure that meat is not adulterated and setting up\ninspections and examinations --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sorry. You're not\nseriously arguing that the Secretary couldn't regulate\nin the manner California has, that the Secretary is\npowerless under this Act to say you can't slaughter\nanimals that can't walk?\nMS. SMITH: No. The Secretary has done --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The Secretary could do\nthat?\nMS. SMITH: Yes. The Secretary -- yes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Because that would be a\nrequirement? Is that -- is that -- do you rely heavily\non -- on the distinction between a requirement and\nsomething that's merely permissive?\nMS. SMITH: No, we don't. Our -- our focus\nis on -- on the scope of the Act and not on\nrequirements. We -- we concede that the -- that\nCalifornia statute is setting out requirements, the\nrequirements in the penal code dealing with animal\ncruelty in -- in areas traditionally regulated by the\nState. So, we -- we do not dispute that the -- the\nprovisions in the State law are requirements.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: But suppose, Ms. Smith, you\ndecided that the Secretary was not doing a good job in\nterms of inspecting for disease. So, I guess that\nthere's some disease called diamond skin disease which\naffects a lot of pigs. And you just thought that the\ninspection standards were far too lenient, and you said,\nokay, we're not going to allow pigs with diamond skin\ndisease to be slaughtered. Under your theory you could\ndo that, too; isn't that right?\nMS. SMITH: Yes, we could because we would\nbe categorically withdrawing the animal from -- from the\nprocess. I want to be clear, though, we're not -- with\nthis law we are not setting up an inspection and\nexamination process. It's -- this provision is in the\npenal code. It's an animal -- it's within the animal\ncruelty statutes. It is not an attempt to set --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: But in fact it requires a\nparallel inspection system. It's trying to do the exact\nsame thing that the Secretary is trying to do, which is\ntrying to remove animals with a certain kind of disease,\nand it requires an inspection system of its own.\nMS. SMITH: In our -- our case or in your\nhypothetical?\nJUSTICE KAGAN: In my hypothetical case.\nMS. SMITH: In your hypothetical --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: And then I think that the\ncases seem similar to make.\nMS. SMITH: Well, it -- it would not be\nexpressly pre-empted, the hypothetical that you have\ngiven me, because we're withdrawing these animals from\nthe scope of the Act. There may be questions about\nconflict pre-emption in that -- in that example, but\nwith respect to what we're doing, what the California\nprovision is doing there, it's not setting up a parallel\nprovision. It's not trying to set up a --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The other argument is that\nit is within the scope of the Act because it is\npre-eminently something that the Secretary is authorized\nto regulate, this nefarious diamond skin disease which\nwe're all familiar with.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's within the scope of\nthe Act, because he could act and indeed is -- is told\nto act to prevent stuff like that. And that's why it's\nwithin the scope of the Act for California to do\nsomething in addition to what he has chosen to do.\nAnd that's why there's a difference between\none and two, requirements within the scope, and\nmarketing, labeling, and packaging requirements in\naddition to or different from those made. This one\nisn't made, but it is within the scope of what the\nSecretary could make. And, therefore, California should\nbutt out.\nMS. SMITH: Let me be precise about -- if\none -- if one saw that -- that paragraphs (b) and (c) of\nthe California law were within the scope, there's still\nan argument that they have to be with -- part of the\noperations, the premises, facilities, and operations.\nAnd certainly with respect to requirement (a), the\nbuying, selling, and the sale of meat, those are not\nnecessarily operations. And we do dispute the -- the\nfactual assertion that's been made that all purchasing\nhappens on the -- on the slaughterhouse grounds.\nThere's no -- no factual record of that in the -- in the\nlower record. We have no way to dispute that because it\nwas not -- it was not litigated.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Suppose I agree with you on\nthat but don't agree with you -- or least I'm dubitante\non that and -- and disagree with you on the rest. What\ndo I do?\nMS. SMITH: We believe the -- the law could\nbe or would be severable. In the Ninth Circuit, the\npreliminary injunction went to all provisions except for\nsubparagraph (e). We would have to litigate\nseverability, of course, but we do think that it would\nbe severable, and it seems that the Ninth Circuit --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What -- what purpose\ndoes the ban on buying and selling have, other than to\nimplement the restrictions that go to operations?\nMS. SMITH: Well, the purpose of the\nCalifornia law is twofold. One, general public health,\nbut there's also a very strong component of prohibiting\nanimal cruelty. And so, prohibiting the purchase,\nbuying, selling, or the sale of meat --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But that seems to me\nto be, the answer, that, no, it doesn't have anything\nelse to do because the animal cruelty that you're\nconcerned about takes place on the premises as a result\nof the operations. And so, you prohibit the buying and\nselling of an animal that wasn't treated the way you\nthink it should be treated, to give effect to your views\non how it should or should not be treated, which seems\nto be expressly pre-empted.\nMS. SMITH: Well, not necessarily, because\nthe law -- if we look at the entire California penal\ncode section, it's dealing not just with\nslaughterhouses. So, it is trying to deal with a\ncomprehensive problem that it sees with respect to\nnonambulatory animals, not just at the slaughterhouse\nbut at other market agencies, et cetera -- and livestock\nagencies. And so -- so, the focus on purchasing,\nbuying, receipt, selling of the meat is to prohibit and\n-- and stop the -- the commerce in nonambulatory\nanimals.\nAnd California's purpose there, as I said,\nwas twofold, to, one, protect general public health but\nalso to prohibit animal cruelty in an area where --\nwhere California legislators were concerned about the\nhumane treatment of nonambulatory animals, not just\nswine, because the law is broader than that, but that's\nwhat's at issue here today.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What does it include\nbesides swine?\nMS. SMITH: It includes cattle, sheep,\ngoats, and swine. And the preliminary injunction was\nbrought --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Those are -- those\nall go through slaughterhouses?\nMS. SMITH: They do. They do. And --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Wells, you have 4 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF STEVEN J. WELLS\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. WELLS: Thank you. I just have a couple\nof quick points to make. One is that the Secretary has\ninterpreted the -- section 602 and section 603 and\nsection 604 to require that all animals be handled --\nall animals on the premises be handled humanely and that\nall animals be subject to the regulations under the\nchapter. That's set forth in 9 C.F.R. 302.3, and it's\nalso set forth in the Secretary's directives. It's\ndirective 6100 at appendix at 47.\nSo, the Secretary does not make a\ndistinction in implementing section 602 through 604\nbetween animals that the State may choose to try to\ncategorically remove. It applies to all animals, and\nthat is critical because a State -- a slaughterhouse\nworker who is on the premises needs to have one set of\nrules that -- that the worker follows so that the worker\nknows that if he follows the advice of a Federal\ninspector and, for example, puts a nonambulatory\nanimal -- separates the animal, puts it in a covered\npen, and lets it go through the ante-mortem inspection\nthat it's required to have under Federal law, that the\nslaughterhouse worker won't go to jail.\nAnd that's why it's critical that -- to\nCongress -- that was critical to Congress that we had\nthis uniformity, and I think it's critical that this\nCourt find pre-emption in this case because otherwise\nFederal law will appear and disappear, apparently, based\non when the State believes that it's removing animals\nfrom -- in connection with slaughter, whenever that\nwould occur.\nJust one other point, and that is it is also\ncrystal clear that the Humane Methods of Slaughter Act\nof 1978 incorporated the standards of humane treatment\nthat were included in the Humane Methods of Slaughter\nAct of 1958, and it isn't just the preamble to that\npublic law that indicates that.\nThose requirements are found now in 21\nU.S.C. section 603(b), and they are backed up by\nprohibitions which are backed up by criminal penalties\nin section -- in 21 U.S.C. section 610 -- yes, 610(b).\nAnd if the Court has no more questions, I'll\nconclude my remarks.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you counsel,\ncounsel.\nMR. WELLS: Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The case is\nsubmitted.\n(Whereupon, at 11:04 a.m., the case in the\nabove-entitled matter was submitted.)\n54:23 43:18,20,25 44:23 45:16 apart 4:14,23
