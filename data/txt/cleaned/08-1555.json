Yousuf.\nMr. Dvoretzky.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF SHAY DVORETZKY\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. DVORETZKY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may\nit please the Court:\nThe FSIA applies to suits against foreign\nofficials for acts taken on the state's behalf, because\nsuch suits are the equivalent of a suit against the\nstate directly.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Counsel, I -- I want to just\nsay that I have one problem with the case at the outset.\nAnd I don't mean to interrupt the organization of your\nargument. You might want to address it later. And it's\na question that goes to the other counsel, too.\nI'm having difficulty seeing how the issues\nas presented in the brief really resolve very much.\nLet's assume -- I know this is not your position. Let's\nassume the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act grants\nimmunity to the state for this conduct and for a\nthen-serving official who is its agent and for a former\nagent. Let's assume there is -- there is immunity. Why\nisn't it just repealed, overridden, by the later\nenactment of the Torture Victims Protection Act?\nI just don't see the issue structured that\nway in the briefs, and I'm puzzled by it. But I say that\nat the outset, and I really didn't mean to interrupt your\n-- your good introduction.\nMR. DVORETZKY: The Torture Victim\nProtection Act creates a cause of action but is silent\nabout immunity, and, therefore, has to be interpreted\nconsistently with background immunity principles and\nconsistently with a preexisting statute codifying\nimmunity, rather than --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: What -- what authority do\nyou have for that?\nMR. DVORETZKY: I'm sorry. Could you\nrepeat --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: What case authority do you\nhave for that proposition?\nMR. DVORETZKY: Dellmuth v. Muth, for one\nthing. Also, the government previously argued that the\nTVPA has to be interpreted consistent with preexisting\nimmunity principles. When Congress wants to waive\nimmunity, it knows how to do that. For example, it\namended the FSIA to specifically waive immunity for\nactions against state sponsors of terrorism.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: It's like a -- it's like a\nclear statement rule?\nMR. DVORETZKY: Yes. If Congress wishes to\nwaive immunity, it has to do so expressly.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: If you are right about\nthat -- I guess it would be the same under the Alien Tort\nStatute -- then the Filartiga case -- if the -- if there\nhad been a quest -- request to dismiss because Filartiga\nwas a former officer, and the same thing in Karadzic,\nnone of those could have gone forward?\nMR. DVORETZKY: If, in those cases, an\nimmunity defense had been asserted and it had been\nestablished that the official was acting on behalf of\nthe state, then, yes, immunity would apply. Those\ndefenses were not asserted in those cases, though.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Is there -- is there any\nAlien Tort Statute or the torture statute that would\nhave survived, under your view, because your view is\nit's no exception under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities\nAct, end of case?\nMR. DVORETZKY: Absolutely, there are\nTorture Victim Protection Act and ATS claims that could\nbe brought. They could be brought whenever an FSIA\nexception applies. So, for example, if an action were\nbrought against an official of a state sponsor of\nterrorism, the FSIA exception for that would apply. If\na foreign state waived immunity, either explicitly or\nimplicitly --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, but that doesn't --\nthat's not going to happen.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. DVORETZKY: There are cases where it has\nhappened. For example, the Philippines effectively\nwaived immunity when claims were brought against Marcos.\nSo it certainly could happen.\nCongress envisioned that the statute would\nbe interpreted consistently with immunity principles.\nThe legislative history supports that inference. There\nare reports in the legislative history and a\nfloor statement by Senator Specter saying that the FSIA\ncould provide an immunity defense to a claim against an\nofficial where the official can establish an agency\nrelationship with the state.\nHere, there is no question that Mr. Samantar\nwas acting in an official capacity, because he is being\nsued for his actions as a prime minister and as a\ndefense minister, in the midst of what was effectively\nquelling a secessionist insurgency. That's an\ninherent --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Of course, that -- again,\nthe Torture Victim Protection Act says \"an individual\nwho, under actual or apparent authority, or under color\nof law of any foreign nation, subjects an individual to\ntorture.\"\nWhy isn't that a clear statement? And then\nI'll get off this hobby horse, and you can get back to\ntalking about the FSIA.\nMR. DVORETZKY: Well, it's not a clear\nstatement because it's only a clear statement creating a\ncause of action. It's not a clear statement that speaks\nto immunity. And, again, where Congress has wanted to\nwaive immunity, it has done that expressly, as where it\nwaived the immunity of a foreign state for claims brought\nagainst state sponsors of terrorism.\nAnd Dellmuth v. Muth, I think, is on point\nbecause there the Court held that even though a cause of\naction was created that would principally apply only to\nstate agencies, that in and of itself was not sufficient\nto waive the sovereign immunity of the states.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I'll jump on\nthe hobby horse even if Justice Kennedy is jumping off.\nI mean, the -- the exception in the TVPA is\nto the jurisdictional immunity of a foreign state. That\ndoesn't sound the way you would just establish a cause\nof action.\nMR. DVORETZKY: You're talking about the\nexception in the TVPA for state sponsors of terrorism?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes.\nMR. DVORETZKY: But the TVPA -- the FSIA, in\naddition, also has a cause of action applicable to state\nsponsors of terrorism. That's in the red brief at 17a.\nIt's 28 U.S.C. section 1605A(c). And so in that\nsituation, what Congress did was it both created a cause\nof action against state sponsors of terrorism and their\nofficials and waived immunity.\nIn the TVPA, all that Congress did was to\ncreate a cause of action. And so that cause of action\nhas to be read consistently with background principles\nof immunity.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, when you -- going\nback to where you started -- you started saying the\nofficer must go together with the state, because in\nreality it's the same thing; it's a suit against the\nstate.\nBut this is a case seeking money out of the\npocket of Samantar and no money from the treasury of\nSomalia, so why is the suit against the officer here\nequivalent to a suit against the state?\nMR. DVORETZKY: Because the touchstone of\nforeign sovereign immunity law, which the FSIA codified,\nis that one nation's courts cannot sit in judgment of\nanother nation's acts. And the basis for liability that's\nasserted in this case is Samantar's acts on behalf of\nthe state of Somalia.\nThe issue is not who pays the judgment; the\nissue is whose acts are in question. Now, in the\ndomestic context, of course, the distinction between\npersonal liability and liability from the state may\nmatter, but that's only because --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, that sounds like\nyou're -- you're talking about an \"act of state\" doctrine,\nnot that the suit against one is the equivalent of a\nsuit against the other.\nMR. DVORETZKY: The \"act of state\" doctrine\nis distinct from immunity doctrines, although they have\ncertain shared underpinnings and shared comity\nconsiderations. And just as the under -- act of state\ndoctrine is concerned with not judging the acts of\nforeign states, so too is foreign sovereign immunity\nlaw. That's the fundamental premise of foreign -- of\nforeign sovereignty immunity law.\nIn the domestic context, courts do sometimes\nsay that an official can be sued for personal liability\nbecause he wasn't acting for the state if he violated\nthe state's controlling law. U.S. courts are able to\nmake that determination because our courts are the\nultimate arbiters of domestic law. U.S. courts are not\nthe ultimate arbiters of foreign law. In fact, a\ndetermination that an official was not acting for a\nforeign state because he must have violated the foreign\nstate's law or international law is precisely what\nforeign sovereign immunity prohibits.\nSo in the foreign sovereign immunity\ncontext, as long as the underlying acts are those of the\nstate, foreign sovereign immunity prohibits the case\nfrom proceeding. And that --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I'm not sure that I\nfollowed your distinction of the domestic law, per se,\nbecause say, the Federal Tort Claims Act, to come within\nthat Act and to have the government cover it, the\nofficer has to be acting within the scope of her\nemployment, however careless or reckless she may be.\nMR. DVORETZKY: That -- and that goes to\nwhen the government would be liable for the employee's\nacts. In our case, what we're talking about here is\nwhen the official can be personally liable for acts of\nthe state. And in the domestic context, we say the\nofficial can be liable when he must not have been acting\nfor the state because he violated the state's\ncontrolling law.\nForeign sovereign immunity prohibits that\ndetermination with respect to the law of foreign states,\nand it prohibits U.S. courts from imposing their view of\ninternational law on other courts to conclude that an\nofficial must not have been acting for his state.\nJUSTICE ALITO: How will a court determine\nwhether an official was acting within the official scope\nof the official's responsibilities?\nMR. DVORETZKY: Ordinarily, the foreign\nstate would tell you, and that would be dispositive of\nthe matter.\nIf the foreign state doesn't tell you, you\nwould look at the nature of the allegations in the\ncomplaint and see if they fall within a category of\nconduct that is inherently viewed in -- as sovereign.\nAtop that list --\nJUSTICE ALITO: What if the court can't tell\nby looking at the complaint? Is there going to be\ndirect communication between the court and the foreign\ngovernment on this issue?\nMR. DVORETZKY: A foreign government\nordinarily is going to -- is going to get involved in\nthe case and indicate whether it wishes to assert\nimmunity on behalf of the official or not.\nFor example, there have been several cases\ninvolving suits against Israeli officials, and the\nIsraeli embassy communicated to the courts and to the\nState Department that these were acts of Israel and the\nofficial policy of the state.\nAgain, if you don't have that, though, it's\nnot going to be a difficult inquiry, typically, to look\nand see whether inherently sovereign acts are what's at\nissue. For example, if you have military or police\nconduct, as this Court said in Saudi Arabia v. Nelson,\nthat's inherently sovereign conduct. Legislative --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So how is the inquiry\nany different than the one that would go under the\ncommon law head of state inquiry? What would be\ndifferent in the two?\nMR. DVORETZKY: I -- I think the inquiry as\nto whether it's an official act would be the same, but\nhead of state immunity is a different sort of immunity\nthan sovereign immunity. It's much broader, insofar as\nit covers even personal acts by a head of state while he's\nin office, whereas for foreign sovereign immunity,\nwhat you're looking to distinguish is whether the\nofficial was engaged in personal activity or whether he\nwas engaged in acts on behalf of the state.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So your --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Is head of state immunity\nimplicit in the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act as\nwell?\nMR. DVORETZKY: No. Head of state immunity\nis a different body of common law immunity that the\nFSIA --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So why can't this be a -- a\ndifferent body of common law?\nMR. DVORETZKY: Do you mean, why\ncan't this --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No. I mean, you're saying\nthey -- they left head of state immunity to the common\nlaw, did not incorporate it in the Foreign Sovereign\nImmunities Act. Why -- why should I believe that they\ndid not do the same for -- for agent of state immunity?\nMR. DVORETZKY: Because head of state\nimmunity is not a form of sovereign immunity. And what\nCongress did in this Act was it codified the law of\nforeign sovereign immunity. At common law, the\nsovereign immunity of the state was always understood to\nextend to officials for their official acts.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Wait a minute. Why --\nwhy -- that doesn't make any sense to me. Why would we\nhave had the creation of all of these common law\nimmunities attached to foreign individuals like consular\nand diplomatic and heads of state if state sovereign\nimmunity was going to cover them naturally?\nMR. DVORETZKY: Because consular and\ndiplomatic immunity are very different in scope and in\npurpose than state sovereign immunity.\nThere are two sources of immunity that an\nindividual might be entitled to. There is the immunity\nthat flows from the state itself for official acts, and\nthere is immunity that flows from the individual's\noffice, like diplomatic and consular immunity.\nDiplomatic and consular immunity are meant\nto ensure that states can conduct their business without\ntying up their officials while they are in office in\nlitigation in foreign courts over any matters, personal\nor official.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm trying to go before\nthe Act, the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, before it\nwas passed, because that was Congress's first statement,\nand we have to figure out what they intended to replace\nor not replace.\nBefore the Act came in, what activities of a\nconsular office would not have been covered under the\nforeign sovereign immunity of a state? What activity\ncould a diplomat have engaged in or a consular officer\nhave engaged in that state immunity, as it was\nunderstood at the time, would not have given him or her?\nMR. DVORETZKY: He could get into a car\naccident. Diplomatic and consular immunity would\nprevent the diplomat or the consul from being sued for\ntort damages for a car accident in a foreign state.\nOfficial immunity would not, because driving\nis not considered an official policy of the state in the\nway that, as I was saying to Justice Alito, police or\nmilitary conduct would be.\nSo that's the distinction between official\nconduct and conduct that may well be within the scope of\nemployment but is not entitled to the state's immunity.\nAnd where Congress --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Can -- can you get to the\ntext of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act that you --\nthat you assert embraces this personal immunity?\nMR. DVORETZKY: Section 1603(a) -- excuse\nme -- section 1604 says that \"a foreign state shall be\nimmune from the jurisdiction\" of the United States and of\nthe States. When a suit is brought against an official\nfor his official act, that is effectively subjecting the\nforeign state itself to U.S. jurisdiction.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Suppose that the -- the\nDepartment of the Army orders clothes for the soldiers\nat a time when the department is a separate agency of\nGovernment X in 1940. In 1950, this department is\nbought by the Dior clothing company.\nNow, it's a private entity, and someone would\nlike to sue the department because they didn't pay the\nbill. It is now a private entity. They are suing them\nfor what happened years ago when they were part of the\nstate.\nIs it sovereign immunity, this statute that\nblocks the suit, or some other principle?\nMR. DVORETZKY: I think this statute would\nblock the suit --\nJUSTICE BREYER: The statute would block the\nsuit. There's precedent with -- you know, famous\nprecedent with King Farouk, which says the opposite. It\nsays: You were king, you are not king now; therefore,\nthere may be a different principle, but we can sue you\nnow.\nMR. DVORETZKY: Because the source of\nimmunity in that case was head of state immunity, which\nis different from the state sovereign immunity --\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. And you're\nsaying if a state disappears, it no longer exists, so\nyou couldn't possibly be interfering. You couldn't\npossibly be interfering in the workings of the state --\nMR. DVORETZKY: If the state --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- you still can't sue\nanybody --\nMR. DVORETZKY: It was --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- who was part of the official\noperation --\nMR. DVORETZKY: If the --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- even though there is no\npresent interference?\nMR. DVORETZKY: If the state does not exist,\nthen I think you probably could sue the official --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Why? Why?\nMR. DVORETZKY: Because --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Because if the state\ndoesn't exist, why is there any stronger reason\nthan in the incident where the entity is no longer\npart of the state?\nMR. DVORETZKY: Because ultimately, what\nforeign sovereign immunity and this statute are\nconcerned with is protecting a foreign state's act from\nbeing judged in court.\nIn your example of the Department of the\nArmy which subsequently is bought by another company,\nand the foreign state exists, the foreign state's acts\nare still being judged regardless of the status of that\ndepartment --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Oh, no, you may have act of\nstate doctrine. At that point, the State Department\ncomes in and says: You can't maintain this suit because\nof the act of state doctrine for the very reason you've\nsaid.\nMR. DVORETZKY: You may very well have the\nact of state doctrine, but --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And that's my question: Do\nyou need the act of state doctrine or does this statute\ncover it which removes the discretion from the Executive\nBranch to decide on a case-by-case basis?\nMR. DVORETZKY: The act of state doctrine\nmight very well cover your hypothetical, but it's a\ndifferent doctrine that is not duplicative of immunity.\nIt serves different purposes. Immunity prevents the\nsuit from proceeding at the outset. It's an immunity\nnot only from liability, but an immunity from the\nlitigation process itself.\nThe act of state doctrine is a discretionary\ndoctrine, first of all. It's not automatic in the way\nthat immunity is; and, second of all, it applies only on\nthe merits; and, third, it serves different purposes\nbecause it can be used even offensively and even in\ncases where the state itself is not a party, simply to\nestablish the legality of a state's conduct within its\nown territory. So the act of state doctrine is a\njudge-made prudential doctrine that serves different\npurposes than immunity.\nIn your hypothetical, Justice Breyer,\nimmunity would apply to the acts of the -- of the\nDepartment of the Army because, regardless of when suit\nis brought, those acts are still those of the state. In\nthe hypothetical where a state does not exist at all,\nthen 1604 would not come into play because there is no\nforeign state to be held immune.\nThat's not this case, though.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Can I come back --\ncan I come back to the text? I -- just for a moment\nthere we were on the text of this Act --\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- that the suit is about.\nAnd you said where -- where the immunity exists is at\n604, which says a foreign state shall be immune, but\n1603 defines a foreign state, which -- which says that\nit includes an agency or instrumentality of a foreign\nstate.\nAnd then it defines agency or\ninstrumentality in a way which, it seems to me, does not\ninclude private individuals, but rather just artificial\nlegal persons.\nMR. DVORETZKY: Section 1603(a) does not\ndefine a foreign state exhaustively. It simply states\nwhat a foreign state includes. We know that because, if\nyou look at 1603(b), the very next subsection, Congress\nsaid what \"an agency or instrumentality\" means.\nSo had it meant to define exhaustively what\n\"a foreign state\" means, it could have said: \"A foreign\nstate\" means its political subdivisions, agencies, or\ninstrumentalities. The fact that Congress said that a\nforeign state includes a political subdivision and its\nagencies or instrumentalities suggests that it includes\nmore than just the enumerated entities.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I -- I would find it\nextraordinary that it would go out of its way to say\nthat it includes the Department of Defense but would\nleave up in the air whether it includes the Secretary of\nDefense. I mean, I -- I -- it seems to me much more\nlikely that you would understand a foreign state to\ninclude the departments of -- of that state than that\nyou would assume a foreign state to include individuals\nwho happen to be officials of the state.\nMR. DVORETZKY: And the reason that I think\nthat Congress had to go out of its way to define what\nconstitutes an agency or instrumentality is that, at the\ntime that the FSIA was passed, there was uncertainty\nabout whether certain governmental or corporate entities\nwere included, maybe not the Department of Defense, but\nwhether certain commercial entities owned by the state\nwere entitled to the state's immunity. There was --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And there was no\nuncertainty about -- about individuals?\nMR. DVORETZKY: Precisely. There was no\nuncertainty about whether individuals were included.\nAnd so when Congress was simply continuing the common\nlaw against which it passed this statute, it didn't need\nto expressly say --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: How can you maintain that\nposition when the Department of State takes the position\nthat the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act applies to a\nstate and agencies and instrumentalities, but it doesn't\napply to officers? If it was all that certain that they\ndidn't even have to put it in, then is -- the State\nDepartment is being recalcitrant?\nMR. DVORETZKY: The State Department asked,\nbefore the FSIA was passed, to have Executive discretion\ntake -- taken away with respect to immunity\ndeterminations. Congress agreed with that judgment and\npassed the FSIA, and now the Executive Branch has to be\nheld to that judgment that was made. As far --\nJUSTICE ALITO: It's something of a --\nit's something of a mystery that the FSIA doesn't say\nanything at all about this form of immunity; doesn't\ncodify it, doesn't abrogate it, doesn't preserve the\npreexisting law. Do you have an explanation for that?\nMR. DVORETZKY: I don't, other than the\nexplanation that I gave Justice Scalia, which is: This\nimmunity was not in question at the time that the FSIA\nwas passed, and when Congress passes a statute in an\narea where there had been preexisting common law, this\nCourt presumes that Congress meant to incorporate and\ncontinue that common law and not abrogate it unless\nCongress has spoken directly to the contrary.\nJUSTICE ALITO: But was this Act originally\ndrafted by the Executive? Do you know?\nMR. DVORETZKY: I'm not sure whether it was\ndrafted by the Executive or whether it was drafted by\nCongress, but it was passed at the request of the\nExecutive Branch because there was -- the State\nDepartment was put in a position of being under\ndiplomatic pressure to grant immunity on -- on favored\nstatus to certain nations who asked for it when they\nwouldn't otherwise be entitled to it. This --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Is there any case by us\nin which we -- prior to the FSIA, where we recognize\nthat an individual was immunized in the way that the\nstate was, if he was acting as an agent of the state?\nOr were all of our cases having to do with other common\nlaw doctrines?\nMR. DVORETZKY: This Court's cases generally\nhad to do with other doctrines. The one possible\nexception to that is Underhill, in which the Second\nCircuit's decision decided the issue on foreign\nsovereign immunity grounds, and this Court affirmed.\nIt's unclear entirely whether this Court's\naffirmance was on act of state or immunity grounds, but\nalso at the time that that decision was -- came down,\nact of state and immunity doctrines were very much\nintertwined.\nThere is no question, however, as the\ngovernment argues, that the common law before the FSIA\nrecognized that officials were entitled to immunity --\nto the state's immunity for their official acts. The\nSecond Restatement, which was -- which was promulgated\nin 1965 just before the FSIA, says that. The Second\nCircuit's decision from 1971, just before the FSIA was\npassed, in Heaney, says that. And it --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, entitled to it, or --\nor able to obtain a letter from the State Department\nthat would confer it upon them?\nMR. DVORETZKY: No, Your Honor --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I mean -- well, I mean,\nprior to the FSIA, you -- you had to get it from the\nState Department, didn't you? Even the state,\nfor that matter?\nMR. DVORETZKY: No. The -- the -- prior to\nthe FSIA, this was a common law doctrine that courts\nwould often apply without any input from the State\nDepartment.\nIn the Heaney case, for example, the State\nDepartment was asked to provide input and provided none,\nand the Second Circuit nonetheless held that, using the\ngenerally applicable common law principles, that the\nofficial was entitled to immunity for the state's acts.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And what -- what if the\nState Department came in and said no, no sovereign\nimmunity here, what would the court do? Would the court\nbe bound by that?\nMR. DVORETZKY: Ordinarily, the court would\nat least defer to that. Whether it would be\ndefinitively bound by -- by that or not, it would at\nleast be entitled to deference.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So they didn't have to say\nyes, but if they said no, that -- it pretty much\ncarried the day?\nMR. DVORETZKY: That's probably right.\nAnd -- but the real issue that prompted the FSIA --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you -- you don't\nassert that to be -- to be the law now, do you? Has --\nhas that been carried forward --\nMR. DVORETZKY: No --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- under the FSIA?\nMR. DVORETZKY: No, because the whole\npurpose of the FSIA -- again, at the Executive Branch's\nrequest -- was to take the Executive out of that process\nand to --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, and then I -- I had\nthought -- again, correct me if I am wrong -- that,\nultimately, in this case, whether or not within the\nissues here present -- ultimately, you have two arguments.\nOne is that it's just implicit, inherent, necessary for\nthe Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act that agents be\ncovered; otherwise it won't work.\nThe other -- I take it you have a backup\nposition that even if that's wrong, that under generally\naccepted principles of international law, that agents\nstill have immunity. Or am I wrong about that?\nMR. DVORETZKY: Well --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I had thought when I read\nthe House of Lords opinion in Jones and they talked\nabout the statute, that they took your position, this\nfirst position, that the Act just won't work unless\nthere's an agent -- immunity for the agent. But I take\nit that even if we reject that position, you still have\na fallback position in the -- in the -- in further\nproceedings on remand?\nMR. DVORETZKY: Our position is that the\nFSIA incorporates the common law and that Mr. Samantar\nis entitled to immunity under the statute. If you\ndisagree with us on that, we would certainly wish to\nassert common law defenses on remand, but we believe\nthat the statute resolves the question.\nIf the Court has no further questions, I'd\nlike to reserve my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMs. Millett.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF PATRICIA A. MILLETT\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMS. MILLETT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nJustice Kennedy, the hobby horse that you\nwere talking about actually goes right -- right to the\nheart of this case, and that is of the Torture Victim\nProtection Act, in which Congress did create a cause of\naction, was -- that cause of action was created for -- to\nimpose a liability, personal liability, for acts that\nwere done with \"actual or apparent\" -- but included with\n\"actual\" -- authority of the foreign state.\nNow, if Congress believed that the FSIA\nimmunized everyone who undertook acts under color of\nlaw, or at a minimum with actual authority of the\nforeign state, that was a very empty statute.\nNow, part of the -- part of the --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Ms. Millett, I think it's a\npretty empty statute as well to interpret the Foreign\nSovereign Immunities Act to immunize the Department of\nDefense, but not the Secretary of Defense. I mean, that\nseems very strange.\nMS. MILLETT: It doesn't seem strange, for\nprecisely the reason that we have still with us today a\nformer minister of defense when we have no Ministry of\nDefense and no Government of Somalia whatsoever. The\nreason is that individuals come and go. Individuals\nengage in acts that are not acts of the state --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But the state --\nthere is -- the distinction strikes me as artificial as\nwell. We're talking about insulating state acts. The\nonly way a state can act is through people. And you're\nsaying: Well, the state is insulated, but the people\nwho do the acts for the state are not. I don't see how\nthat can -- can work.\nMS. MILLETT: The only question here is\nwhether the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act is the\nsource of that insulation. And the very\ndifficulty with --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Oh, well, then --\nbut the whole point of the Act was to codify what was\nthere before, and -- and it seems odd to say, well,\nthey were codifying the immunity of the state, but not\nthe immunity of the only way a state can act, which is\nthrough individuals.\nMS. MILLETT: Well, first of all, states do\ncorporate acts that are greater than the -- the whole is\nmuch greater than the parts here. And the issue in this\ncase is whether the part can claim the immunity of the\nwhole, and that is a very different thing.\nThe -- the individual -- individuals may\nact. They may act without authority; they may act\ncontrary to authority. And the problem with the FSIA,\nwhich is the issue here, is there is no mechanism in it\nfor addressing, for example, whether this was\nauthorized.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The -- the Ministry of\nDefense is not the whole, either. I mean, you -- you\nacknowledge that -- that each individual piece of a\nforeign sovereign acquires the immunity, but somehow\nnot -- not the principal officers of -- of the sovereign\nentity. That seems to me very strange. I mean, I guess --\nI guess you could write it that way, but I don't know why\nanybody would want to write it that way.\nMS. MILLETT: Well, Justice Scalia, if\nyou're going to write a statute that addresses\nindividual immunities -- in particular, what this case\nis about, personal immunity for personal liability,\nthen those statutes look very different.\nWhat's the first thing you are going to\nwant? You are going to want some way to decide what is\nofficial capacity or what is on behalf of a state, and\nyou are going to want a mechanism for the foreign state,\nor at least the State Department, to have input on that.\nThere's nothing in the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act\nthat addresses that. You're going to --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, what is your --\nMS. MILLETT: -- want to identify --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Right. The question I\nthink, as I understand it, which is certainly why it's\nbothering me, is: Don't think of this case. Think of\nthe set of cases where it's clear that the plaintiff is\nsuing an active state. He's suing France or he's\nsuing England or -- he's suing an active state for an\nofficial act. And the judge says: I have read the\nForeign Sovereign Immunities Act; dismissed. Judge,\nlet me amend this. And all he does is he fills in\nthe names of the individuals, because there were some\nindividuals who did the act.\nNow, does he suddenly fall outside the\nForeign Sovereign Immunities Act just because he listed\nthe names of the people who did it, and everything else\nwas the same?\nMS. MILLETT: Yes, he does, because --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, then, this Act does\nnothing whatsoever.\nMS. MILLETT: No, that's -- that's not true.\nThat's not true, Justice Breyer. This Act is designed\nto protect the state from being sued.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, it doesn't protect --\nMS. MILLETT: You can't --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- the state, because all I\ndid there is I made my complaint the same, relief was the\nsame, everything was the same. I happened to go to the\nInternet to find out who were the human beings working for\nthe state who did the thing I'm complaining did. And all\nI did was fill their names in, in the complaint.\nAnd I cannot imagine any complaint that\nisn't open to that, because a -- a state can only act\nthrough an individual.\nMS. MILLETT: Justice Breyer, there -- the\nquestion is whether Congress, in the FSIA, would have\nthought that is a suit against the state.\nNow, there may be many reasons that they\nwould have. If they thought, in the Restatement's\nwords -- which are not just if you are doing an official\nact. If you are doing an official act, and the exercise\nof jurisdiction would have the effect of enforcing a\nrule of law against the state, then you get immunized.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So wait --\nMS. MILLETT: That --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- you're saying this Act\nis only good as against a bad lawyer? Because any\ngood lawyer would simply fill in the right names.\nMS. MILLETT: I think --\nJUSTICE BREYER: There is never a case where\nthis Act would give immunity if the plaintiff has a good\nlawyer. Is that what you're saying?\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Ms. Millett --\nMS. MILLETT: This Act is good against --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- I thought your point\nis, if the relief is against the state, it doesn't\nmatter who you name as the plaintiff.\nMS. MILLETT: That --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Whether it's injunctive\nrelief or money relief, if the relief is against the\nstate, obviously, you can't dodge it by naming the\nofficer instead.\nMS. MILLETT: That's precisely right. That\nis the second half of the Restatement --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Oh. Oh, that's a different\nanswer --\nMS. MILLETT: Well, that's what I was trying\nto say. The second half of the Restatement says you\nhave to be enforcing a rule -- the effect --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Fine. If you're going to give\nthat answer --\nMS. MILLETT: -- if you're enforcing a rule\nof law against --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- which I thought was what\nyou would give --\nMS. MILLETT: That's what I was trying to\ngive.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- then I have added my\nquestion: Sometimes the individual, in the first set of\ncases that Justice Ginsburg mentioned, does count as the\nstate. Sometimes the individual does not count as the\nstate. And the trouble I'm having, in this case, is to\nwork out the principle of when that individual would\nfall within the FSIA -- as you now, via\nJustice Ginsburg, have conceded, sometimes it does --\nand when it doesn't.\nAnd I've tried to work with the idea of\nrelief, or maybe the nature of the cause of action, or\nmaybe the time that the suit is brought, such as a time\nafterwards. I'm not an expert. You're more of an\nexpert than I. What are the principles that determine\nwhen?\nMS. MILLETT: Well, there's -- there's two\nlevels here.\nFirst of all, we'd look -- and this is --\nCongress, presumably, was drawing on a well-established\ndomestic law analogies here. And they may not be\n100 percent controlling here, but we have\nwell-established ways of understanding whether a -- an\naction is against an official in -- in their official\ncapacity. We look at the form of relief, the nature of\nthe claim. I do think we need to be careful here --\nJUSTICE ALITO: What is there to suggest that\nCongress was looking to domestic analogies? This has\nnothing -- immunity of officials under domestic law\ndoesn't bear very much resemblance to the immunities\nthat are available to foreign officials, does it?\nMS. MILLETT: Well, this is a domestic\nstatute, and for Congress -- for purposes of Congress\ndeciding whether a lawsuit is a suit against a sovereign\nor not against a sovereign, then that is obviously a\nrelevant framework.\nAnd we know from two things -- the Torture\nVictim Protection Act, that they looked at that framework,\nbut also embedded in the FSIA itself, in the Foreign\nSovereign Immunities Act itself, is that same\ndistinction between holding people personally liable and\nholding the state liable.\nIn 1605A, the terrorist state exception, on\n15a to 17a of the addendum to our brief, they create a\ncause of action, one against the state and one against\nthe individual officials. Now, the one against the\nindividual officials is a recognition that individual\nofficials can have personal capacity liability for\ndamages, consistent with the Foreign Sovereign\nImmunities Act. Otherwise, if -- if, under\nPetitioner's theory, every lawsuit against an\nindividual -- and the language there, is \"acting under\ncolor of office or employment\" -- if every suit against\nsomeone under color of office or employment morphs into\na suit against the state, there is no cause of action\nto create against the individual.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Ms. Millett, I\nthought --\nMS. MILLETT: They understood it was\nindividual liability.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I thought the\nwhole point of the FSIA was to get the Executive Branch\nout of the business of sending letters to the court\nevery time a state was sued. The government requested\nit for that purpose. Now they are just back into it\nagain if you say, well, you can just sue the\nindividuals.\nAnd the government's position in this case\nconfirms that. They're -- they tell us the way you\nshould proceed is to look to the Executive Branch and,\nbasically, we'll send you a letter and let you know.\nSo it seems to me the whole reason you have the FSIA is\nundermined by the position you're taking today.\nMS. MILLETT: No, I think it's because the\ninquiries are very different, as this case illustrates.\nAnd that is -- first of all, the point of the FSIA, as\nsection 1602 says, is to codify -- as this Court's cases\nhave said, was to -- largely to codify the restrictive\ntheory of sovereign immunity, which did not apply to\nindividual immunity. It did not apply to the head of\nstate. The head of state was still immune for\ncommercial acts while a sitting head of state.\nSo, if that was codified, that was a dramatic\nchange done silently in the FSIA. The reason Congress\nwould want to retain Executive Branch role here is\nbecause the inquires are different, and the first one is\nthe most elemental one in Petitioner's case and that is\nthe assertion that: I was acting in my official\ncapacity. Who decides? How do we decide? Which\nagents? For which actions? For how long? What level\nof immunity?\nIf the FSIA eliminated the head of state's\nnormal absolute immunity while sitting from all actions,\ncommercial or not, that's a dramatic revolution. We can\nnow sue sitting prime ministers and presidents and\ndistract them from their duties.\nIf the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act made\nany official's official act an act of the state -- and\nremember, they are now every level of the foreign\ngovernment down to the mayor's office, and corporate\nofficials, too, so we've now eliminated the long-standing\nprinciple in corporate law -- corporations also only act\nthrough individuals -- that corporate liability and\nindividual liability go hand-in-hand.\nThe -- the FSIA did not uproot all that, and\nit provides no mechanisms. That's why we need to return\nto the common law immunity. Now, what happens when you\nhave a case that, in effect, is seeking relief against\nthe state --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. The -- the\nmechanism it provides is judicial determination of these\nquestions that -- that you say have to be determined --\nwhether he was acting within the scope of authority and\nall that stuff.\nMS. MILLETT: As you --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Isn't that what it did?\nIt took it away from the Executive, gave it --\nMS. MILLETT: When you're interpreting the\nlanguage in the FSIA, like \"under color of law\" --\n\"under color of office,\" that is undoubtedly a job for\nthe court. \"Official capacity\" appears nowhere in the\nFSIA. Deciding which agents will be agents of the state\nis nowhere in the FSIA.\nOne court has applied this agency -- agent\nprinciple to say that when we hire an independent\ncontractor, in the -- the United States independent\ncontractor, that gets the immunity of the foreign\nsovereign state.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Courts -- courts\ndecide this sort of question all the time, whether\nyou're talking about principles of domestic immunity\nor even corporate liability: Is the employee on a\nfrolic or is it a detour? Determining when an individual\nis acting for another entity as opposed to on -- on his\nown business, that's a very common inquiry.\nMS. MILLETT: Not in this area, where those\ndecisions have foreign relations implications. This\nCourt has done the opposite. And it has -- it has\nwaited for the political branches to lead, and it has\nfollowed. Because the decision whether we're\ndisplacing head of state immunity and now we're going\nto have commercial immunity --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Then that -- I mean, I'm\nsort of there. You may agree with this, that if you\nhave an individual and with what's being charged here\nis he is, in fact, now acting as Secretary of Defense,\nand this action is an action he took in his official\ncapacity, that's it. Forget it. This Act covers it.\nBut where you're claiming it's not and he's\nnot now a member, the reason for the Act disappears,\nand you go back to the act of state doctrine.\nMS. MILLETT: Justice Breyer, the -- I don't\nthink -- I think -- and this may seem a little formless,\nbut I simply think it's right, because you're dealing\nwith statutory text here.\nIt's not so much that the defense minister\nhimself becomes the state; it's that the court looking\nat that action goes: This is really an action against\nthe state. The state is a necessary party under\nPimentel and must be here. You, individual, actually\nhave a common law immunity, an absolute immunity, when\nyou are, under the Restatement, sued for official acts.\nAnd the effect of exercising jurisdiction would be to\nenforce a rule of law against the state.\nWhen you have those two things together,\nboth of them, you are entitled to immunity because this\nis an action against the state. The state's a necessary\nparty. Under Republic of Philippines v. -- excuse me --\nPimentel, they must be joined, and that will -- then we'll\nlook at the FSIA and decide whether they can be joined\nor not. That's the way it works.\nIt's not that individuals -- and this is a\nproblem -- that are sort of popping in and out all\nthroughout the FSIA. If it were, we need mechanisms\nthat we don't have here to deal with the very sensitive\ndecisions of which individuals. Well, how will we say\nyou're the agent? It's -- the individual can show up and\nsay I was working for the state; I was doing torture;\nwe loved torture; that was our policy -- you can imagine\nmany a government, if notified, if there was a mechanism\nfor them to come in, would say: Hang on, that was not our\npolicy. But there's no mechanism under his theory.\nWhat else happens? I don't even understand,\nunder this theory, what happens. Normally, what happens\nin these official capacity suits that we're familiar\nwith is if it really is an official capacity, then we --\nwe substitute the state, relief will run against the\nstate.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Your friend --\nyou friend --\nMS. MILLETT: But there's no mechanism here\nfor -- I'm sorry.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Your friend said it\nhappens all the time. He cited the example of the\nIsraeli embassy is always sending letters or showing up\nin court when their agents are -- are sued.\nMS. MILLETT: That may be. Nobody showed up\nin court here until we got to this Court. There was no\nSomali government to show up to say whether this was\nofficial or not, and the State Department didn't show up\nfor 2 years. What is a court supposed to do?\nWell, it was not supposed to do what it did\nhere and declare that it's essentially recognizing the\ntransitional federal government as the government of\nSomalia, because it didn't know what else to do. That\ncan't be right. And, again, we need to keep in mind the --\nthere is no mechanism in the text of the FSIA. This\nCourt will be engaged in an expedition of constructing\nand reconstructing the FSIA if you are going to turn\nit into either a Westfall substitution act with no\nlanguage here, or you have to turn it into a personal\nimmunity for personal liability act.\nThat's not the text. Sovereign immunity\nhas never been a personal liability from personal --\npersonal immunity from personal liability statute.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, do you agree with the\nSolicitor General's position about the preservation of\nthe immunities that existed before?\nMS. MILLETT: Yes, as to -- as\nindividualized, the specialized immunities --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Yes.\nMS. MILLETT: I do -- we do agree. Now,\nwhether we -- we don't agree, I think -- we may not agree\n100 percent on what the scope or content of that immunity is.\nWe certainly agree that head of state immunity was preserved,\nso we can't sue the head of state at all while sitting.\nJUSTICE ALITO: No, but whatever immunity\nexisted previously for an official or former official\nwas not abrogated by the FSIA. The FSIA just doesn't\naddress that subject at all.\nMS. MILLETT: Our position is that the FSIA\ndoes not address that. Our view of what the common law\ndid beforehand was it packed most of this into the act\nof state doctrine. That's exactly what happened in\nUnderhill v. Hernandez, that when you start getting to\nlower level officials who are not heads of state, who\nare not diplomatically protected, consular protected,\nmission on -- have mission immunity, that that -- a lot\nof that worked through act of state doctrine, and --\nJUSTICE ALITO: There's no -- there was\nno immunity for someone who is the equivalent of a -- of\na cabinet officer, previously?\nMS. MILLETT: There -- there --\nJUSTICE ALITO: The minister of this or that\nin another government -- they have no official immunity?\nMS. MILLETT: Well, look -- and much is to be\ndebated on remand. That issue is clearly not before\nthis Court. As we look at the cases and the authorities,\nin fact what you have are different things coming together,\nand it can be -- a lot of times, it was act of state\ndoctrines that were going on there. But the notion that\nindividual foreign officials are not personally liable\nfor actions is just wrong, and that is because --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Ms. Millett, do you agree\nwith the --\nMS. MILLETT: -- or cannot be.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Do you agree with the\ngovernment that it's the government's advice --\nthe government said, in the old days, the Tate letters\nwent out in all these cases. Now, they no longer go out\nwhen we're dealing with a state itself or a state\nagency, but we still -- the Executive -- basically, as I\nread the government's position, the government is\nsaying: The Executive Branch decides. We tell the\ncourt. And if we don't tell the court that this person\ncan be sued, then the person can't be sued.\nAre you in sync with the government in that\nwe are now back to the Executive -- essentially, the\nExecutive decides, not the court?\nMS. MILLETT: I don't think that's the\nexclusive one, and I think, as this Court explained even\nin Altmann that deference given -- respectful deference\nis always going to be given when the Executive Branch\nweighs in, because these are foreign -- cases that have\nforeign policy implications.\nI don't think it's a rubber stamp on the\npart of the courts. As this Court said in Altmann, it\ndepends on whether they're speaking with particularized\nspecialty. If they come in and say Mr. Samantar was\nthe head of state, we're done. I don't think\nthere's -- I'd like to think of something; I can't\nthink of anything that would save us from that. If they\nsay who a head of state is, then that, I think, has\nlargely been treated as binding on the courts.\nIf they say someone -- they've determined\nthat someone was acting in an official capacity, that's\ngoing to receive --- either whether communicated from the\nforeign state or based on principles that they have --\nthat's going to carry weight, but it's not going to\nnecessarily mean you automatically dismiss when you\nhave -- you could have times where the Executive\nBranch said anyone acting under color of law should be\nimmunized. Then --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No, I gather the --\nMS. MILLETT: -- you're going to have the\nExecutive Branch and the TVPA at war.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- the State Department\nasserts the right to say: Yes, he was acting\nin a -- in an official capacity, but sock it to him.\nMS. MILLETT: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, the -- the State\nDepartment wants to be able to decide whether\nindividuals will be held liable, whether they were\nacting in an official capacity or not; isn't that it?\nMS. MILLETT: Well, they -- that -- I'll\nlet them speak for their own position. I think\ncertainly -- certainly there are a variety of doctrines,\na variety of hurdles any case has to get through. And\nit's not just the Executive's views on a case. There's\nthings like exhaustion. There's necessary party\ninquiries. There's the act of state doctrine. There's\nsubstantive limits on what one can sue for.\nYou know, the Torture Victim Protection Act\nis Congress's judgment that individuals who do this,\nconsistent with international law, whatever else --\nindividuals who engage in torture and extrajudicial\nkilling are held personally liable in Congress's views\nand in the views of international law. And the Foreign\nSovereign Immunities Act doesn't stop that.\nAnd what's critical, again, is the --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I must say --\nMS. MILLETT: -- language that's missing --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- that I find it much\nmore acceptable to have the State Department say\nthat a particular foreign country should be let off the\nhook, which is what they used to do with the Tate\nletters, than I do to leave it up to the State\nDepartment whether -- whether an individual human being\nshall be -- shall be punished or not. I -- I somehow\nfind that less within the realm of the -- of the foreign\naffairs power of the State Department.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And your red light has\ngone off. I could just add -- make an addition to that\nsame question. I would agree that the State Department\nmight have some expertise in telling us what the facts\nwere: Who was the government, who was -- who was in\noffice at the time, what the policies were.\nBut it's just not clear to me what body of\nprinciples the State Department looks to, to make this\ndetermination that, as Justice Scalia said, Smith is\nimmune and Jones isn't.\nMS. MILLETT: I think --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Please.\nMS. MILLETT: May I, sir? The -- first of all,\nwhether one thinks it's the right rule or not, the FSIA\ndoesn't tell us any way of answering who was in official\ncapacity and getting input, at a minimum, from the\nforeign government whose mantle this individual is\ntrying to wrap themselves in. So the FSIA is not the\nsource.\nThe Executive viewpoint is not -- in our\nview, is not the sole source. And there are -- there\nare a number of other doctrines, whether it's act of\nstate doctrine, whether it is exhaustion principles,\nwhether it's a necessary party inquiries, whether it's\nsubstantive limits on, you know, law of nations\nrequirements for the Alien Tort Statute or the Torture\nVictim Protection Act. There's forum non conveniens.\nThere are a battery of doctrines that come together to\nvery narrowly limit these actions.\nAnd what the State Department looks for\nis -- what it has said is that it has -- it has a\npattern of decisionmaking, factors it lays out in its\nbrief, that I think it finds -- it says it finds --\ninfluential in the process. But in -- forgive me for --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Finish your\nsentence.\nMS. MILLETT: But in any given case, the\nrole of the Executive Branch is going to have more or\nless deference based on whether it is speaking something\nwithin its traditional expertise: Are you a head of\nstate? Were you a diplomat?\nBut when it comes to war -- and I -- I'm not\nsaying it would, but if it were to come to war with the\nvery elements of the Torture Victim Protection Act and\nsay that torture by an individual can be immunized just\nbecause it was done under color of law, then I think the\nCourt has a very difficult concern that was flagged in\nAltmann to resolve, and I think we might draw a\ndifferent -- we would definitely come to a different\nanswer than the Executive Branch in that situation.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You made that a long\nsentence.\n(Laughter.)\nMS. MILLETT: I'm sorry. I apologize.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMS. MILLETT: Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Kneedler.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER\nFOR THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,\nSUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. KNEEDLER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe text, the context, the purposes, and\nlegislative history of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities\nAct demonstrate that it was not intended to apply to the\npreexisting common law --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could you --\nMR. KNEEDLER: -- doctrine of official immunity,\nbut rather -- yes --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Kneedler --\nMR. KNEEDLER: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could you -- I'm --\nMR. KNEEDLER: I'm --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sure one of my colleagues --\nMR. KNEEDLER: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- will get you back.\nCould you address the practical implications of\nyour position? And by that I mean, it took 2 years\nfor the State -- for the government to respond to the\ndistrict court in this case. Tell us why your reading\nof the statute would not grind the courts to a halt.\nWhat happens when Justice Breyer's situation\narises? Someone takes a complaint against the state and\njust substitutes the names of the persons. What -- why\nwouldn't the courts come to a grinding halt?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, let me answer that in\ntwo ways.\nFirst, there's -- there is a very practical\ndistinction between suing the state and suing the\nindividual. The Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act is not\njust about immunity; it's about the subject matter of\nthe courts. If a foreign sovereign is found to be\nimmune, the court has no jurisdiction over the case. So\nto say that the individual is -- is governed by the FSIA\nmeans that it would be a threshold subject matter\njurisdictional inquiry in every case. So in terms of\njudicial administration, that is a problem.\nIt is also a problem, as a practical matter,\nto apply the FSIA's very reticulated standards that were\ncarefully negotiated between the Executive Branch and\nCongress when they knew what they were dealing with.\nThey were dealing with the immunity of states and\nthe -- and the principals of states. And this is\nreflected, as Ms. Millett said, in section 1602. That's\nthe business that Congress wanted to get -- Congress and\nthe Executive -- wanted the Executive to be out of,\nwhich was the immunity of foreign states --\nJUSTICE BREYER: But all you have to do is\nwrite a different word in. Now, that's the question\nthat's --\nMR. KNEEDLER: Okay. And -- right and --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- and then Ms. Millett\nsort of backed off that.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And that -- and if -- what I'm\nseeing here is two extreme positions.\nYou're saying: Never, no matter what, can\nyou simply write the name \"Joe Smith\" under the word\n\"Niger.\" Okay? Can't do it. Even though every act --\nno matter what, you write that human name in, and you --\nthis statute doesn't apply. To me, that means it never\napplies. All right?\nThe opposite would be that never, under any\ncircumstances, can you sue an individual for a -- for\na -- for an official act. That seems the opposite. I\nshould think sometimes you certainly could. Maybe after\nhe has left the government. But I'm looking for the\nprinciple, if I'm right, that would divide the two.\nMR. KNEEDLER: And --\nJUSTICE BREYER: You want to stick to your\nextreme position? Never, just write the thing in --\nMR. KNEEDLER: I don't -- I don't regard the\nposition as extreme at all. It's exactly --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, do you want to stick to\nthat position, that all the plaintiff --\nMR. KNEEDLER: Because this --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- has to do is\nrewrite the name?\nMR. KNEEDLER: -- this is a statute that\ninvaded the common law in the -- the background was\nthe common law in which the Executive made the\ndeterminations for both foreign sovereigns and\nindividual officials. This -- and in addition,\nit -- it affected the relationship of the\npolitical branches. It had been a power of the\nExecutive Branch for foreign sovereigns. The Foreign\nSovereign Immunities Act took that away with the\nagreement of the political branches.\nThere's none of -- there's no indication\nwhatsoever that Congress addressed common law\nimmunities, and there's a good reason. And that is\nthat there -- there are a lot of diplomatic\nsensitivities about whether immunity should be\nrecognized in a particular case or not.\nAnd with respect to foreign sovereigns, the\npolitical branches addressed those in very precise ways.\nThere's nothing in the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act\nto take into account the different sensitivities that\nmight well arise with respect to foreign sovereigns --\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's an excellent reason.\nCan you give me one single example ever of a complaint\nthat would ever be dismissed under this statute --\nMR. KNEEDLER: It would -- it --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- if -- if my lawyer is\nclever enough to look up who the individuals were and\nsubstitute their names?\nMR. KNEEDLER: And -- and it would -- here's\none example in which it would work: If the relief was\ngoing to run against the state, if there was an\ninjunction to take money out of the state treasury or to\nconvey land, for example, that would, in substance, be\nan action against the state, just like under Ex parte\nYoung. If you tried to bring an injunction against a\nstate officer to make him pay money out of the state\ntreasury, you couldn't do that.\nIt's not because the officer being sued is\nthe state. It's that the state is a necessary party to\nthat lawsuit. The state not being joined, the suit\nagainst the individual would have to be dismissed.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Do you think as a practical\nmatter --\nMR. KNEEDLER: That's Pimentel.\nJUSTICE ALITO: -- there's a -- I'm sorry.\nDo you think, as practical matter, there's a difference\nbetween a $10 million judgment against a state for\nsomething that is official state policy in relation to\ndefense, and a $10 million judgment against the current\nforeign -- defense minister of that state for exactly the\nsame policy?\nMR. KNEEDLER: There -- there -- there is a\ndifference in the operation of the suit. We're not\nsaying that such an official should not be immune. What\nwe are saying is that the immunity derives from the\ncommon law immunity. There's a presumption against a\nstatute invading the common law, and particularly a\ncommon law that was primarily shaped by the Executive.\nThere should be a strong presumption against\ntaking that flexibility away in the absence of a clear\nstatement in the statute. And as -- and -- if the -- if\na -- if a suit should go to judgment like that, perhaps\nthe state would indemnify the person. But we are not\nsaying that that person is not immune. A question that\nwas asked --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could we go back to the\npractical --\nMR. KNEEDLER: Yes. To the -- and -- and I --\nI understand the practical problem that the district\ncourt faced, and the district court was very patient.\nI think it's important to appreciate,\nthough, the -- the -- this case really illustrates the\nsensitivities of -- of foreign official immunity. This\nis -- this is a claim of foreign official immunity by a\nformer official of a collapsed state in a -- in Somalia,\nas some of the briefs point out. There has not been a\nfunctioning central government since 1991. There are a\nnumber of factions. On the ground in Somalia, the\nabsence of a central government has led to foreign\ngovernments coming in and exercising influence, to\ndomestic terrorist groups, and to piracy off the -- off\nthe coast of Somalia.\nThe request to the United States, to the\nState Department for its views, arose in that context.\nThis very case at this moment arises in a context where\nthings are fluid, and -- and there are circumstances in\nwhich the Executive Branch or sometimes even the\ncourt --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's -- that's very nice.\nA few years ago, a Spanish magistrate allowed a lawsuit\nto proceed, as I recall, against our Secretary of Defense.\nAnd what you say is that that's perfectly okay. It's up\nto the Spanish government to assert that that suit\nshould not proceed, and if it doesn't, it's perfectly\nokay?\nMR. KNEEDLER: It -- such a suit would not\nbe perfectly okay in -- because, I mean, it would depend on\nthe circumstances. But as was pointed out with respect\nto the suits against the two Israeli defense ministers,\nin that circumstance, the Israeli Government said,\nlisten, these two officers were acting on behalf of --\nof the government when they carried -- that's the Dichter\ncase and the -- and the case this Court had from the\nSecond Circuit last term.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I wonder -- I wonder\nif the example you give or the point you make, that\nthere's no functioning Somali Government, doesn't cut\nthe other way.\nLet's assume you have somebody who was\nacting in an official capacity, doing what his job\nrequired, whether you like it or not, and then there's\na change in the Somali government; and the United States\nlikes the new Somali government. That guy is kind of\nput out to -- to dry because he can't get anybody to say\nwhat he maintains is true, which was I was acting\npursuant to official policy of the government.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And the United\nStates is not going to give him the letter he needs\nbecause they like the new Somali government.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, under international law\nthe -- the official immunity exists for the benefit of\nthe state, not for the individual. The state can waive\nthat immunity, and the state can determine whether, as\nhappened in the Philippines case, that the -- that the\nactions being complained of were not -- were not within\nthe official activity.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But I take it your answer\nto Justice Scalia with reference to the indictment\nagainst the Secretary of Defense, is that that's not\ncovered by the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act. And if\na state interprets international law to allow the suit,\nthen it goes forward.\nMR. KNEEDLER: No. If -- if -- if one of\nour officials was sued in a foreign court, then we would\nexpect the dynamic to play out as -- as I have\ndescribed, where the United States would take the\nposition, presumably that what was being done was within\nthe scope of official conduct after investigation and\nassert immunity, and expect that to be respected. My\nonly point is that --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But that just goes back to\nthe Tate letter era, where we wait to get an e-mail\nfrom the State Department to tell us what to do.\nMR. KNEEDLER: And the -- this --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I thought that was the\nwhole purpose of the Federal -- of Foreign Sovereign\nImmunities Act.\nMR. KNEEDLER: It -- it was the purpose with\nrespect to foreign sovereigns, but there were good\nreasons why the court did that, precisely because\nimmunity questions -- as I've said, this case\nillustrates, to -- to recognize an immunity or not\nto recognize would -- might favor one faction or another\nin the ongoing dispute in -- in Somalia.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Kneedler --\nMR. KNEEDLER: And so the -- what --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: This is -- it's now\nmany years, and we still don't -- the State Department\nhas said in effect: We decide.\nCan you tell the Court, is this defendant\namenable to suit or is there an immunity that would\ncover him?\nMR. KNEEDLER: We are not addressing that\nhere. The court of appeals remanded for consideration\nof common law head of state and other immunities.\nSuggestions of immunity traditionally have been tendered\nto the district court. And the legislative history of\nthe Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act shows -- clearly\nsays that the official type immunities -- using the\nword \"official\" immunity, head of state immunity,\ndiplomatic immunity, consular immunity -- those things\nare not addressed by the Foreign Sovereign Immunities\nAct.\nSection -- section 1602 shows that Congress\nwanted to take the Executive away because the government\nwas being pressured by foreign governments with respect\nto the restrictive theory with respect to commercial\nactivities. And that's where the pressure was being\napplied, and the Executive Branch wanted to get out of\nthat business, and agreed to. If you read 1602, it\nspecifically refers to commercial activities.\nThere was no such conscious abrogation of\nthe Executive's critical role to make immunity\ndeterminations on behalf of officials in the legislative\nhistory. And this Court should not strain to read the\nrigid provisions of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities\nAct, which were just not tailored to the immunities\nthat the Underhill decision of this Court specifically said\nofficials have immunity for their official acts\nexercising governmental authority.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Kneedler.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: There were a lot of long\nsentences in there --\n(Laughter.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Dvoretzky,\nbecause of that, we'll give you 5 minutes.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF SHAY DVORETZKY\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. DVORETZKY: I'll try to keep it short.\nI'd like to make three points: First of\nall, when a suit is brought against a -- an official or\nformer official, the only question that a court will\nneed to answer under the FSIA is whether the acts\nchallenged are those of the state. That's a\ndetermination that courts can readily make and are\naccustomed to making. By contrast --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Wouldn't that be the\nsame question that you would ask invoking a common law\nprotection like head of state or act of state? Isn't it\n-- whether it's under the FSIA or under a common law\ntheory -- the identical question?\nMR. DVORETZKY: It is the same inquiry that\nyou would have asked under the common law in inquiring\nwhether the state's immunity extends to its officials.\nWhat the FSIA did was it codified that rule, and it took\naway Executive Branch discretion to deviate from it. If\nyou look at the Solicitor --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Isn't that the very\npoint? If the inquiry is the same under the FSIA and\nunder the common law, and we're unsure what Congress\nintended in the FSIA, because it certainly doesn't\nexplicitly say it covers individual acts, shouldn't we\ndefer to the Executive's decisionmaking in what is --\nhas been, for centuries now, within its jurisdiction?\nWhy should we take that power away when the inquiry\nwould be the same under either doctrine?\nMR. DVORETZKY: First of all, as we argue in\nour brief, this has not historically been a long-standing\npower of the Executive in the way that the immunity\nitself has been recognized under the common law. And\nwhat Congress did in 1976 was it codified the substance\nof the common law but took away that procedure. And\nthis case demonstrates exactly why it's necessary to\nextend the FSIA to foreign officials in order to -- in\norder to make the FSIA mean anything at all, and in\norder to ensure the uniformity and predictability that\nCongress intended through the statute.\nIf you look at the factors that the\nSolicitor General proposes to take into account in this\ncase -- I'm looking at page 7 of the Solicitor\nGeneral's brief -- \"Petitioner's residence in the United\nStates rather than Somalia, the nature of the acts\nalleged,\" the \"invocation of a particular statutory right,\"\nthe -- the state of the government in Somalia -- these\nare factors that have no basis in the common law that\nthe FSIA codified. No case has ever held that a foreign\nofficial or former official loses immunity for official\nacts on the basis of these sorts of factors.\nMoreover --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Why can't you say that if\nthe person, the individual you are suing, is a member of\nthe foreign state, is engaged in the kind of activity that\nyou're complaining about, is subject to the orders of\nthe foreign state, and the relief would affect the\nforeign state, you are suing the foreign state?\nBut where he was a member of the foreign\nstate, and you want money from him, even though what he\ndid in the past was an act of a foreign state, this\nlawsuit is not affecting him in his capacity -- is not\naffecting the foreign state. Indeed, there isn't even\none. So in the first set, he falls in the FSIA. In the\nsecond set, he doesn't. And you happen to have the\nsecond set, and, therefore, he may still be immune for\nwhat he did in the past, but that would be a different\ndocket.\nMR. DVORETZKY: All right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: That -- that's where this\nis all leading me.\nMR. DVORETZKY: Because the Restatement --\nwhat the Restatement, which summarized the common laws as\nof the time of the FSIA's enactment, says that an\nofficial is immune for his acts on behalf of a state if\nexercising jurisdiction would enforce a rule of law\nagainst the foreign state. You enforce a rule of law\nagainst a foreign state just as much by threatening to\nbankrupt an official as soon as he leaves office --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: How does this case --\nMR. DVORETZKY: -- as you do by issuing --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: How does this very case\nestablish a rule of law for the foreign state?\nThe Act is aimed at torturers. The remedy comes out of\nthe private pocket. How does this establish -- if the\nthing plays out and the plaintiffs prevail, there\nwill a remedy against an individual actor; there will be\nno relief awarded against any government. How would it\nset a rule for the foreign government?\nMR. DVORETZKY: Because enforcing a judgment\nagainst a foreign official, threatening to bankrupt the\nperson as soon as he or she leaves office, has just as\nmuch effect on the state itself as -- as enforcing a\njudgment directly against the state. It will force\nofficials to conform their conduct on behalf of --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Never mind that this\nperson has long lived in the United States, in Virginia.\nIt will have no effect -- will have no effect whatever on\nthe government of Somalia?\nMR. DVORETZKY: But the -- the rule that the\ngovernment proposes, and the courts would presumably be\nleft to apply on their own in the many cases like this\none and the 9/11 litigation against the Saudis where the\ngovernment doesn't weigh in, that rule does not draw\nthose neat lines.\nWhy, for example, would we know that a prime\nminister who comes to visit the United States has not\nspent enough time here in order to have his official\nimmunity abrogated?\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask just ask one\nquick question? Am I correct in understanding that you\ndo not contend that your client was covered by\n1603(b)(1)?\nMR. DVORETZKY: 1603(b)(1) is the agency --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: It defines an agency or\ninstrumentality of the --\nMR. DVORETZKY: We do argue that in the\nalternative. We think our principal argument is that --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: The principal argument is\nnot based on the text. You do make that argument in the\nalternative then?\nMR. DVORETZKY: We make that argument in the\nalternative. Our principal argument is based --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: It's interesting that nobody\nhas talked about that section during the entire argument.\nMR. DVORETZKY: Our principal argument is\nbased on the text of 1604, which is that in -- that\nsubjecting official acts --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: If they don't qualify\nunder 1603(b)(1), it's kind of hard to get the statute\nto apply to them at all.\nMR. DVORETZKY: I respectfully disagree,\nYour Honor, because 16 (b)(1) defines agencies or\ninstrumentalities. And an official, like an agency or\ninstrumentality, is the means through which the state\nacts. And, so, if the foreign state include --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's kind of hard --\nI mean, I assume the reason you don't rely heavily on it\n-- because it says that an agency or instrumentality is an\nentity. I mean, we usually don't think of individuals\nas being entities.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And 1602 applies only to\nforeign states.\nMR. DVORETZKY: 1602 applies to states, and\nour argument is that exercising jurisdiction over the\nofficial in the circumstances like these would be\nexercising jurisdiction over the state.\nAn entity, Your Honor, is not -- is not\nautomatically read to include a person, but it doesn't\npreclude persons, either, as the Ninth Circuit held in\nChuidian.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nCounsel.\nMR. DVORETZKY: Thank you.\n"
