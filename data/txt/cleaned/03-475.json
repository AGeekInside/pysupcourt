General\nOlson?\nORAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON\nON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS\nGENERAL OLSON: Mr. Chief Justice, and may\nit please the Court:\nThis is a case about the separation of\npowers. The Constitution explicitly commits to the\nPresident's discretion the authority to obtain the\nopinions of subordinates and to formulate\nrecommendations for legislation. Congress may\nneither intrude on the President's ability to perform\nthese functions, nor authorize private litigants to\nuse the courts to do so.\nAs this Court has construed the Federal\nAdvisory Committee Act to avoid what the Court\nregarded and described as formidable constitutional\nquestions, FACA does not permit the litigation and\ndiscovery the Respondents wish to pursue.\nQUESTION: Would you say it's also a\nseparation of powers question, Mr. Olson, to the\nextent that it involves the ability of the courts to\nformulate rules to prevent them from deciding\nquestions unnecessarily?\nGENERAL OLSON: I'm not sure I understand\nthe thrust of your question.\nQUESTION: Well, you said this is a case\nabout separation of powers. And I wanted -- I asked\nwhether or not the authority of the courts is not\nalso involved here, because there is a concern that\nwe should have rules designed to prevent us from\nunnecessarily deciding questions.\nGENERAL OLSON: Well, with respect to\nthe -- I'm not sure whether you are asking a question\nabout the jurisdiction of the Court, because that's\nan issue that's before the Court, or with respect to\nconstruing the Federal Advisory Committee Act to\navoid the constitutional questions that are implicit\nin that statute.\nWe think that there is jurisdiction in\nthis Court. We think that what the Court did in\nPublic Citizen was make it very clear that because of\nthe formidable constitutional questions, in fact, the\nCourt referred to the constitutional questions in\nthat case as undeniable.\nThe Court construed the Federal Advisory\nCommittee Act not to apply in that case. If that\nsame rationale is applied here, the Court will not\nget to the constitutional question which FACA would\ninevitably raise if it intruded upon the President's\npower to obtain opinions from his subordinates, and\nto make recommendations to Congress with respect to\nlegislation.\nQUESTION: General Olson, we would also\nnot get to it if we adhered to the firm final\njudgment rule which is the first hurdle that you have\nto overcome. You wouldn't get to the merits if there\nis no jurisdiction for us to review at this point.\nGENERAL OLSON: That's true, Justice\nGinsburg. This case fits squarely, we submit, within\nwhat the Court decided unanimously in the United\nStates vs. Nixon for two reasons. In the first\nplace, a denial of immediate review would render\nimpossible any review whatsoever of the claims, the\nseparation of powers claims that are being made here,\nbecause the Vice President -- and the Vice President\nis acting as the subordinate and surrogate for the\nPresident here. This is the President's authority.\nQUESTION: Well, of course, in the Nixon\ncase, the President exercised his privilege and it\nwas overruled.\nGENERAL OLSON: Yes, Justice Kennedy\nQUESTION: So it's not, it's not on all\nfours in that sense.\nGENERAL OLSON: Well, it's not all fours\nin that sense, but the principle as articulated by\nthe Court on pages 683 -- I mean 691 to 692. What\nthe Court was concerned about there is that the\ntraditional contempt avenue or any aspect of what\nwould be required of the President of the United\nStates to defy a court order would be both unseemly\nand would unnecessarily provoke a constitutional\nconfrontation.\nWhat the Court said in that case, when we\nare talking about, when the Court is talking about\nimportant separation of powers questions, the\nPresident is in the position of having to defy a\ncourt order, risk sanctions of some sort.\nQUESTION: But you are not defying a court\norder if you exercise a privilege. Or if you assert\na privilege.\nGENERAL OLSON: With respect, Justice\nKennedy, this case, the separation of powers issue in\nthis case goes far beyond the assertion of executive\nprivilege. Executive privilege concerns itself with\nparticular documents or a concern over the\nrelationship that particular documents refer to. The\nobjection here is to the process.\nThe President and the Vice President are\nbeing subjected to litigation and discovery which\ngoes far beyond what the statute would require here.\nQUESTION: It's essential to the\nGovernment's position, I take it, that this Court\nreject the de facto doctrine that was developed by\nthe Court of Appeals.\nGENERAL OLSON: We think, Mr. Chief\nJustice, that the de facto doctrine is wrong. It's\ninconsistent with Public Citizen, and if the Court\nwere to construe -- find that somehow that the\nstatute could be construed to create a de facto\ndoctrine, which no court has ever done, finally done\nin connection with a case, that the case, the statute\nwould be unconstitutional as it applied to these\ncircumstances.\nHowever, Mr. Chief Justice, we believe\nthat the Court does not need to get there by\nconstruing the statute narrowly, as the Court did in\nPublic Citizen, unanimously, I might say, because\nthree of the eight justices felt that the statute, if\nit were construed any other way, would be\nunconstitutional. Construing the statute in that\nfashion -\nQUESTION: When you say construe it\nnarrowly, but nonetheless, retain the de facto\ndoctrine?\nGENERAL OLSON: No. Not deal with it at\nall. I mean, the statute itself, we submit,\naddresses -- I think in the context of this case,\nMr. Chief Justice, the statute may be construed in\nthe context of a Presidential advisory group\nexplicitly excluding a committee that's formed of all\ngovernment employees, and as construed by the Court\nin that case, either -- the words used in the statute\nare established or utilized. As construed by that\ncase, this commission was established by the\nPresident. It would be exempt on its face from\napplication of FACA.\nQUESTION: But what if it's, what if\nit's -- what if the manner in which it's utilized is\nthat, in fact, outsiders, nongovernment employees,\nwere actually given a vote, that when the committee\ntook a vote, there were some nongovernment employees\nwho were counted?\nGENERAL OLSON: We submit, Justice Scalia,\nthat that would raise very serious constitutional\nquestions. As an antecedent to that, there was no\nintention when Congress passed a statute to prohibit\nor regulate ex parte communications between the\nexecutive branch and members of the public.\nQUESTION: Well, this is, this is more\nthan ex parte communications. It's that the\ncommittee is in fact, as utilized, not a committee\ncomposed exclusively of government employees. All\nI'm saying is the people voting, the people voting,\nwhy would that be such an intrusion upon the\nexecutive? Simply to require knowledge of whether\nanybody that voted on the various recommendations of\nthe commission was a nongovernment employee. Why\nwould that be such a terrible -\nGENERAL OLSON: Well, I'm going to, I'm\ngoing to quote from the Public Citizen decision\nitself, which authoritatively and specifically\ndefined the term or utilized in a way which would be\nflatly inconsistent with this question that you just\nraised.\nBut I also want to mention, and would want\nto go on to say, that would require that the courts\nignore the presumption of regularity which applies to\nthe executive, particularly when the executive is\nperforming core executive branch functions, which it\nclearly is in this case.\nBut to get back to your question, the\ncourt in Public Citizen, on page 462, specifically\ndefined what or utilized meant in that case. And\ndefined it in this way, in order to avoid the\nundeniable formidable constitutional questions that\nwould be raised if it was defined as you suggested.\nThe Court said -\nQUESTION: General Olson, would you\nclarify why we are dealing with the merits. I\nthought, and correct me if I misunderstand this, that\nthe merits will have to be resolved in the first\ninstance by the court below. If we find that there\nis jurisdiction, if we agree with you, for example,\nthat this discovery should not have been allowed,\nthen why should we take the first view of the merits\nof this case?\nGENERAL OLSON: It seems to me in the\ncontext of this case, Justice Ginsburg, that once\njurisdiction is acknowledged, the context of the\ncase, the administrative record, which specifically\ncontains within it the Presidential directive which\ncreated the advisory committee only to include\nmembers of the executive branch. The report of the\ncommittee, which specifically identifies as members\nonly members of the executive branch, and the\naffidavit or declaration that's on file from the\ndeputy director, which said that the only\nparticipants were members of the executive branch,\nand the presumption of reliability, of regularity\nthat the Court consistently, U.S. vs. Armstrong is\none case, the Court consistently, absent clear\nevidence to the contrary, accords executive branch\naction -\nQUESTION: But you would still be asking\nus to resolve the merits in the first instance, not\nto review any lower court decision because they said\nthere ought to be discovery first.\nGENERAL OLSON: Well, but we are\nsubmitting that the discovery itself violates the\nConstitution, violates FACA as properly construed.\nQUESTION: All discovery, not -- you are\nnot -\nGENERAL OLSON: Yes, because -\nQUESTION: But isn't that simply the basic\nargument on the merits again. The reason -- I think\nyou're saying the reason we can't have discovery is\nbecause the whole statute is unconstitutional as\napplied to the President.\nGENERAL OLSON: Unconstitutional if it --\nif applied in these circumstances. Now, it may be\nconstrued -\nQUESTION: Yes. If we go -- I mean, if we\ndo what Justice Ginsburg is trying to do, and that is\nget to the jurisdictional issue without passing, in\nthe first instance, as accord in the first instance\non the merits, then it seems to me that the\njurisdictional question, boils down to me at least\nto this. Why should we accept your position on\njurisdiction when jurisdiction goes to the propriety\nwith constitutional overtones, of course, of\ndiscovery, and we don't have the discovery order\nrefined yet.\nIf this case goes back or if it had indeed\nnot been appealed in the first place, you would have\nbeen fighting with your colleagues on the other side\nabout what specific discovery to allow. Once we knew\nwhat the District Court specifically was going to\nallow, we would have a fairly sharply focused\nquestion, and that arguably would be subject to an\nappeal regardless of the final judgment rule. But we\ndon't have that focus yet.\nGENERAL OLSON: Well, there is two answers\nto that -- at least two, Justice Souter. In the\nfirst place, the discovery was ordered by the\nDistrict Court. It may be found at pages 215 to 220.\nQUESTION: But you never came down -- I\nrealize that, I have read the orders. But you never\ncame back, or the Government never came back and\nsaid, well, that order is too broad because, and we\nthink it could be allowed to this extent, and there\nwas -- there was no, as I understand it, there was no\nprocess of trying to refine the discovery order down\nto anything beyond the generalities that we have on\nthe record.\nGENERAL OLSON: Every effort was made with\nrespect to the actions of the litigants in the\nDistrict Court to refine it as much as possible. The\nDistrict Court finally said this is what I order. I\norder the Petitioners not to file any dispositive\nmotions. I order the Petitioners to respond to the\ndiscovery, to reply to nonprivileged discovery\nrequests and assert executive privilege, which we are\nsaying -\nQUESTION: And you did not assert any\nexecutive privilege.\nGENERAL OLSON: No. We did not. We did\nnot.\nQUESTION: So we don't know what might be\nsubject to executive privilege, and sustained,\nperhaps, and what would not be. And it's the what\nwould not be that would raise the constitutional\nissue that you are trying to raise. And it seems to\nme, until we know exactly what that is, there is a\npretty good argument that the final judgment rule\nshould not be subject to exception at this point.\nGENERAL OLSON: Well, I think that there\nis a very strong case that it should be, Justice\nSouter. The Court of Appeals addressed this issue,\ntoo, and said, well, the District Court might have\nbeen too broad. In fact, the Circuit Court, the\nCourt of Appeals recognized the constitutional\nimplications and then said, but maybe that can be\nnarrowed down, but that the Respondents should be\nentitled to whatever discovery they need to prove\ntheir case.\nQUESTION: Was the District, was the\nDistrict Court's discovery order unconditional?\nGENERAL OLSON: Well, it was -- I don't\nknow what you mean by -\nQUESTION: Well, I mean, did it say, you\nknow, the Government must produce thus and so, thus\nand so, thus and so?\nGENERAL OLSON: Yes, it did, Mr. Chief\nJustice, although it did say that the Government\ncould assert privileges with respect to burden or\nexecutive privilege, and so forth. But if one looks\nat those discovery orders and they are in the joint\nappendix, they were much broader than the statute\nitself, broader than the relief that possibly could\n-\nQUESTION: But now we are dealing with the\nsituation at the two, the two justices, judges on the\nCourt of Appeals both said, this is too, this\ndiscovery order was too broad. It ought to be\ntrimmed. Now the District judge would have that\nmessage, so you could have gone back there and said\nsee, District judge, this has to be narrowed.\nGENERAL OLSON: Inevitably what would have\nhappened, because what the Court of Appeals said, and\nthis is at Petition appendix 18-A of the Court of\nAppeals decision is that however refined the District\nCourt's order would be, they would be, the\nRespondents would be entitled to whatever discovery\nthey needed to prove their case.\nNow, what they need to prove their case,\nnotwithstanding the presumption of regularity that\nthe Court has always applied to the executive, absent\nclear evidence to the contrary, there is no clear\nevidence to the contrary here, Justice Ginsburg. All\nthere is is a pure unadorned allegation which the\nRespondents say they get from media reports that\nthere were contacts, nothing beyond that.\nBut what they would need to prove, to\nprove their case is precisely what the District Court\nwas going to allow them to utilize.\nQUESTION: Well, can we get to -\nGENERAL OLSON: In the form of -\nQUESTION: Can we get to the jurisdiction\npoint? Why is it that you went to -- that you are\njustified in going to the Court of Appeals? Because\nthere is a new exception to the collateral order\ndoctrine, or because you are seeking mandate?\nGENERAL OLSON: Both, Justice Kennedy.\nQUESTION: What is the exception? Is it\nsomething new under Cox or is it on one of the before\nCox exceptions?\nGENERAL OLSON: This fits squarely within\nNixon. When the Court said to require the President,\nand remember, we are talking about the President as\nthe real party in interest, to place himself in the\nposture of disobeying a court order, merely to\ntrigger the procedural mechanism.\nQUESTION: We have already discussed that\nhe did not -- the Vice President in this case did not\nexercise his privilege. Wasn't close to being held.\nGENERAL OLSON: What we are dealing with\nhere is the President -\nQUESTION: How do you describe the general\nexception that you want us to have for discovery\ndisputes in the District Courts?\nGENERAL OLSON: When the -\nQUESTION: When it involves the Vice\nPresident, it's different?\nGENERAL OLSON: Well, it certainly does\nwhen it involves the President or the Vice President\nin core constitutional functions. And U.S. vs. Nixon\nstands for the proposition when the President must\nchoose between submission to an unconstitutional\norder, which participation in this discovery, the\nprocess of participation, having to prove every time\nthe President consults with someone, to submit to\nlitigation, and potentially submit to discovery, to\nsubmit to the violation of the separation of powers,\nor, or violate or challenge either sanctions or some\norder from the District Court.\nQUESTION: You wouldn't have to do that if\nyou just asserted executive privilege as to each\ndiscovery request that you thought would be\nburdensome. And then if that's granted, you have no\nproblem. And if it's denied, you immediately come up\non that.\nGENERAL OLSON: Justice Breyer -\nQUESTION: Why not do that?\nGENERAL OLSON: We believe that it's much\nbroader than executive -\nQUESTION: I know that's your legal\nargument, and you may be right about that. But\nassuming you are right about that, you bring up the\nbroader issue on an appeal from the case. See if you\nlose it. And as to your being right, being right I\nguess isn't enough to get you to appeal a discovery\norder if -- but maybe you can if you really need to.\nSo my question is, why did you really need\nto since you could have asserted executive privilege\nas to each individual.\nGENERAL OLSON: Because the act of forcing\nthe President to invoke executive privilege every\ntime someone files a lawsuit, notwithstanding the\npresumption of regularity which was completely\nignored here, that means that FACA would be used in\nevery case to file a lawsuit to challenge the\nPresident and the Vice President's ability to -\nQUESTION: Well, let me -\nGENERAL OLSON: To obtain opinions -\nQUESTION: Let me ask you this. At some\npoint, I think the Government made a Section 12(b)(6)\nmotion to dismiss this suit because the statute was\nunconstitutional. And that was denied.\nNow, could the Government not have sought\nreview either under the collateral order doctrine at\nthat time, or even by mandamus to address directly\nwhether the statute is constitutional?\nGENERAL OLSON: Potentially, Justice\nO'Connor.\nQUESTION: Why didn't the Government do\nthat?\nGENERAL OLSON: Because the Government was\nanxious -- because there was another way to resolve\nthis whole problem, notwithstanding the denial of the\n12(b)(6) motion to dismiss.\nQUESTION: But wouldn't that have given\nthe courts a chance to go directly to the issue of\nwhether the statute is constitutional?\nGENERAL OLSON: We submit that what the\nGovernment did here was try to work out the delicate\nconstitutional problems that were involved here, the\nbalancing of the executive's prerogative with the\nlitigation function and that sort of thing, and to go\nthe extra mile. I don't think the Court would want\nto encourage filing a mandamus or collateral order\nappeals every time there is a denial of a motion to\ndismiss.\nQUESTION: I take it, General Olson, that\nfrom the rest of your argument that traditional\nexecutive privilege doctrine would not cover all of\nthe constitutional issues that you think exist here?\nGENERAL OLSON: That's precisely correct,\nMr. Chief Justice. The forcing of the President to\nsubmit to litigation and discovery, which if\npermitted in this case could be in any case\ncomparable to it, any time advice is being sought\nfrom a citizen or from subordinates who may have then\ntalked to citizens, notwithstanding the clear four\ncorners of the directive when the President created\nthe body within his own Administration from which he\nsought advice, every time there would be a lawsuit,\nevery time they would say, well, Mr. President, come\ninto court and claim executive privilege.\nQUESTION: I see that. I see that. But\nthat's an argument which you made in response to my\nquestion which is an argument on the merits. And I\nwant you to focus on the fact that -- assume I agree\nwith you on the merits. You will have a chance to\nmake that argument on the merits, even if you lose\nhere and if you lose the case.\nNow, my question is addressed to the need\nfor an interim appeal from the discovery. And as to\nthat, what is your response to the fact that you\ncould get your interim appeal or at least preserve\nyourself from harm if you had asserted executive\nprivilege to the individual bits of the discovery\norder with which you disagreed.\nGENERAL OLSON: There is two answers to\nthat, one of which the Chief Justice suggested in his\nquestion. Executive privilege may not have covered\nevery scrap of paper. It would have required the\nPresident and the Vice President to spend time with\ndocuments deciding whether or not to assert executive\nprivilege.\nAnd it is the process -- more importantly\nthan that, it is the process itself of submitting, as\nit would be if someone, if the Congress had applied\nthis statute to the Supreme Court of the United\nStates or even to itself, and then allowed litigants\nto bring the Court or members of Congress into court\nto explain why they wouldn't produce information with\nrespect to who they talked to.\nQUESTION: Well, but Mr. Olson you know better than\nmost the dynamics -- than most attorneys, the dynamics of\nthe discovery system. I hear in your argument echoes\nof every discovery dispute I've ever listened to.\nGENERAL OLSON: Yes. There are several\ndifferences, Justice Kennedy. As I said at the very\nbeginning, this discovery dispute involves bringing\nthe President and the Vice President of the United\nStates into court to defend themselves with respect\nto textually committed obligations and\nresponsibilities that they have under the\nConstitution.\nEvery other discovery dispute that I have\nexperienced, and I submit this Court has experienced\nexcept for perhaps U.S. vs. Nixon, maybe another\ncase, did not involve those circumstances. This is\nat -- this puts the President, in order to challenge\nthe constitutionality of a process that's invasive to\nfundamental Presidential prerogatives and\nresponsibilities into court to defend himself,\nnotwithstanding the questionable constitutionality of\nthe statute that triggers it, that mandamus may not\nbe brought against the Vice President which is the --\nthe Federal Advisory Committee Act, it's worth\nmentioning, does not create a private right of\naction. The APA did not create a right of action\nagainst the Vice President here.\nSo the litigants in this case, not having\na right to even bring this case under the statute,\nthen sought mandamus, it's important to mention.\nQUESTION: Well, then why did the\nGovernment turn over 36,000 pages of paper from the\nagencies that were also a part of this action if the\nwhole thing is so misguided, if the application of\nthis Act violates the separation of powers, why did\nthe Government respond to the request for information\nfrom the agencies?\nGENERAL OLSON: There are several answers\nto that. One, the agencies occupy a different\nstatute under the APA. They occupy a different\nposition under the Freedom of Information Act. And\ntherefore, the obligations were different with\nrespect to the President's core function. Arguments\n-\nQUESTION: But those documents that were\nturned over were, as I recall, documents that would\nhave been available under FOIA, is that right?\nGENERAL OLSON: Yes, Mr. -- Justice\nScalia, they would have been arguably available under\nFOIA, and they were produced under FOIA.\nQUESTION: But you didn't get, you didn't\nmake the argument that no discovery, you are very\nclear about that, no discovery is appropriate under\nthis statute. And yet you didn't, whether -- whether\nthe information that was turned over could have been\ngotten under FOIA, this wasn't a FOIA suit.\nGENERAL OLSON: There was more than one\naction, Justice Ginsburg. There were several FOIA\nactions brought against the various different\ndepartments.\nQUESTION: Well, specifically, these pages\nthat had been previously disclosed to other\nrequesters under FOIA. The request in this case,\nwasn't it made to them under the FACA?\nGENERAL OLSON: Yes. But the documents\nhaving already been produced and made available to\nthe public under FOIA, it seemed to the government\nthat would be foolhardy and unnecessarily\nconfrontational and would serve no purpose whatsoever\nto withhold producing another set of those documents.\nAgain, this is effort -\nQUESTION: General Olson, would you\nclarify one thing for me? Were these documents\nproduced by agencies or were they produced by the\nenergy policy group.\nGENERAL OLSON: They were produced by\nagencies.\nQUESTION: So there has been no discovery\nat all from the policy group, and you claim, of\ncourse, that they are totally exempt under the plain\nlanguage of the statute.\nGENERAL OLSON: Yes. And Mr. Chief\nJustice, if I may reserve the balance of my time.\nQUESTION: Very well. Very well, General\nOlson. Mr. Morrison, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF ALAN B. MORRISON\nON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT SIERRA CLUB\nMR. MORRISON: Mr. Chief Justice, and may\nit please the Court:\nThe threshold question before this Court\nis whether the Court of Appeals correctly ruled that\nit lacked jurisdiction over Petitioners' attempt to\nobtain interlocutory review of the District Court's\norder.\nIn seeking review in this Court,\nPetitioners paint the picture of having been backed\ninto a corner. They claim that if they do not obtain\nimmediate appellate review that they will lose all\nmeaningful opportunity to obtain review of the legal\npositions that they have taken in the District Court.\nThe basis for this claim, as the Solicitor\nGeneral said, is United States against Nixon. The\nCourt of Appeals correctly distinguished that case,\nand said that under neither mandamus or the\ncollateral order was review proper.\nThe Petitioners -\nQUESTION: The Court of Appeals based\nthat, as I recall, on the fact that in Nixon,\nexecutive privilege had been asserted, right?\nMR. MORRISON: They certainly made that\nobservation, but that was not the only reason relied\nupon by the Court of Appeals. There is some question\nas to the extent to which the Court of Appeals\nopinion can be read in that regard. We do not rely\non the fact that executive privilege was not claimed\nbecause here the Government's position is that no\ndiscovery of any kind whatsoever, other than the\npreviously produced documents, is available here.\nQUESTION: I'm surprised to hear that. I\nwas, I was going to talk to you about executive\nprivilege, because I thought that your briefs did\nrely on the fact that executive privilege was not\nclaimed, and that doesn't seem to me a very\nsignificant factor.\nMR. MORRISON: I thought I had been pretty\nclear in my brief saying that executive privilege was\ncertainly something that could be claimed down the\nroad. And we certainly -- the District judge had not\nprecluded that from happening. But as far as we were\nconcerned -\nQUESTION: It should make no difference to\nthe outcome of this.\nMR. MORRISON: It makes no difference. It\nmakes no difference.\nQUESTION: But there is an interim\nposition in which one would say, well, it makes a\ndifference to this extent, that until the executive\nprivilege has been claimed and has been ruled upon,\nthe extent of -- to which they have a plausible\nseparation of powers argument is not clear.\nI mean, we could take that position, I\ntake it, you would agree?\nMR. MORRISON: Yes. That would require\naccepting the notion that -- that everything else\nthat they can -- they can refuse to turn over\neverything else, which is essentially their position\nhere. The Solicitor General's brief is very clear,\nno discovery, period, in this case.\nQUESTION: It would also require\nacceptance of the position that executive privilege\nis a definable doctrine only applicable to certain\nmatters, and that it is, it is the function of this\ncourt to decide what it can be asserted for and what\nit can't be asserted for. And that is not my view of\nexecutive privilege.\nI think executive privilege means whenever\nthe President feels that he is threatened, he can\nsimply refuse to comply with a court order. And the\nsame thing with Congress. And it ends up in a, you\nknow, a struggle of the two branches. I don't view\nthat as some legal doctrine that enables him to\nwithhold certain documents.\nHe is, he has the power as an independent\nbranch to say, no, this intrudes too much upon my\npowers, I will not do it. And after that, it's a,\nit's a struggle between two branches. And if you\nview executive privilege that way, forcing him to\nassert executive privilege is really pushing things\nto an extreme that should not very often occur in\nthis Republic.\nMR. MORRISON: Well, leaving aside the\nquestion of the interpretation of the United States\nagainst Nixon as to whether that decision agrees with\nYour Honor's interpretation, we don't have to get to\nthat issue in this case, and -- and the -\nQUESTION: I don't want to delay this.\nBut to me this is important. Assume that their\ninterpretation of the statute is completely right.\nAssume that.\nMR. MORRISON: Yes.\nQUESTION: I know you don't want to, but\nfor argument's sake, then what they are really asking\nfor is a separate exception from the collateral\norder. I mean, and a separate exception that allows\nthem, the Vice President and the President, and\nnobody else, to take an appeal from discovery.\nNow, executive privilege in my mind came\nin by asking, well, shouldn't they at least have to\nassert that it's that kind of imposition upon the\nPresident's office prior to being able to carve out,\nunder whatever name, a separate exception that would\npermit an appeal.\nMR. MORRISON: I don't read the\nGovernment's brief as being that narrow. But to the\nextent that what they are saying is that they have\nsome kind of special immunity from discovery, it\nwould, as Justice O'Connor suggested earlier, have\nbeen perfectly apparent the day of July 11th when the\ncourt denied the motion to dismiss, and ordered that\ndiscovery is going to take place. That that was the\ntime in which the Government should have taken an\nappeal if they claimed some sort of immunity like -\nQUESTION: What kind of a -\nQUESTION: Mr. Morrison -\nQUESTION: You can't appeal from, you\ncan't appeal from the denial of the motion to\ndismiss. That's really interlocutory.\nMR. MORRISON: Well, Your Honor, but --\nthe notion that there is a special kind of immunity\nfrom discovery of the President and Vice President, a\nsituation like this which is what I understand their\nargument to be, that's the functional equivalent of\nan immunity defense for which there is an exception\nunder the collateral order rule. I disagree with the\nmerits of that, but if that's their argument, that's\nwhen they should have taken the appeal.\nQUESTION: Are you saying -\nQUESTION: I wonder about that. I can see\nyou coming up here and saying, everyone knows that\nthe motion to dismiss was denied is not\ninterlocutory. There has been no discovery yet.\nThere's been no order. They haven't been heard. I\ncan hear that.\nMR. MORRISON: But nothing has happened of\nany legal significance in the case from that time on.\nThe Solicitor General said the Government was trying\nto work things out.\nQUESTION: Discovery order. That's\nsignificant. The mere denial of the motion to\ndismiss did not automatically determine that there\nwould be a discovery order. The court, the court\nmight have found, in accordance with the arguments of\nthe Government, that discovery would be\ninappropriate.\nMR. MORRISON: Your Honor, with all\nrespect -\nQUESTION: And so that is a new injury to\nthe, to the executive which they are trying to bring\nup here.\nMR. MORRISON: With all respect, Your\nHonor, if you read the District Court's opinion, the\nprincipal grounds on which the District Court refused\nto dismiss the case was that discovery was required\nboth with respect to the de facto officer issue and\nwith respect to -\nQUESTION: Ordinarily, that would be\nsummary judgment, not motion to dismiss. Motion to\ndismiss just deals with the pleadings. You are not\ntalking about discovery at that stage.\nMR. MORRISON: Well, the Government, Your\nHonor, had offered in evidence the Executive Order\ncreating the task force and a copy of the final\nreport. The Knutson affidavit did not come in until\nthree months later.\nQUESTION: Then why wasn't that the end of\nthe case? Because as I understand it, discovery is\njust what you want at the end of the case.\nMR. MORRISON: No, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: What relief can you get if you\nwin the lawsuit?\nMR. MORRISON: Well, if Your Honors will\nlook -\nQUESTION: No. Tell me what relief you\ncan get if you win the lawsuit?\nMR. MORRISON: We can get a declaration\nthat it was -- that de facto has to apply. We then\nget access to all the drafts.\nQUESTION: So you get discovery.\nMR. MORRISON: No, Your Honor. What we\nget -- some of the things we would have gotten -\nQUESTION: You get more discovery, or what\ndid you get if you win the lawsuit? That's the thing\nI hadn't really been understanding.\nMR. MORRISON: We get copies of all the\npapers that were exchanged in the entire advisory\ncommittee process.\nQUESTION: Have you not asked for those in\ndiscovery?\nMR. MORRISON: We have asked for\ndocument -- for discovery requests which the\nGovernment contends are very broad and could include\nsome of those things. Our discovery plan -\nQUESTION: And are they right?\nMR. MORRISON: They could be interpreted\nas being right, but not in light of what the District\nCourt said in his order denying the motion to\ndismiss. He said, we are going to have very narrow,\ntailored discovery designed to find out first and\nforemost is the de facto officer applicable. If you\nlook at our plan of discovery, which is in the joint\n--\nQUESTION: What is this de facto officer?\nWhere does that come from?\nMR. MORRISON: It comes from a case that\nwas decided in the D.C. Circuit in 1993.\nQUESTION: It did not involve this\nparticular exception from the FACA, though.\nMR. MORRISON: Yes, it did, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: It did not involve -- it did\nnot involve a committee composed entirely of\ngovernment employees.\nMR. MORRISON: Oh, yes, it did, Your\nHonor. It was alleged that -- the first place, the\nHillary Clinton task force was composed entirely of\ngovernment employees and the working subgroups were\nalso composed entirely of government employees. The\nfirst question was, was the First Lady a government\nemployee.\nQUESTION: Yes. I understand. But the --\nas to the working groups, they were found not to be\ngovernment employees?\nMR. MORRISON: No, Your Honor. They were\nfound sufficiently unclear that the Court of Appeals\nsent the matter back for discovery.\nQUESTION: And they were defined, they\nwere identified in the order appointing the\ncommittee, the working groups. Do you contend that\nany of the people named in the order appointing this\ncommittee are not the people they purport to be?\nMR. MORRISON: Not in the order appointing\nthe committee, Your Honor. But we do contend that\nthe subgroups -\nQUESTION: That people not named in the\norder are really members.\nMR. MORRISON: Which were specifically\nauthorized -\nQUESTION: Which is different from that\nother case.\nMR. MORRISON: It is arguably different.\nBut as Justice Ginsburg suggested earlier, since the\nCourt of Appeals was the one who created this\ndoctrine to begin with, it would seem inappropriate\nfor this Court to try to distinguish this case from\nthat one on the basis of when we, A, don't have a\nrecord, and B, when the Court of Appeals had never\nbeen allowed to pass on that particular issue.\nQUESTION: That's a rather strange\ndoctrine, that we can't tinker with what the Court of\nAppeals has done, even though we disagree with it.\nMR. MORRISON: No. It hadn't done\nanything, Your Honor. It has not ruled on that\ndoctrine in this case at all. It hasn't reached the\nmerits. The Court of Appeals decided nothing but\njurisdiction.\nQUESTION: And so you say that we then are\nprohibited from saying the Court of Appeals de facto\ndoctrine is wrong?\nMR. MORRISON: I didn't say prohibiting,\nYour Honor. I said in the exercise of your\ndiscretion, it would be appropriate to allow the\nCourt of Appeals in the first instance to pass on it.\nJudge Randolph, by the way, Justice\nStevens, thought in his dissenting opinion that the\nonly way he could distinguish the two cases was to\noverrule the prior decision. He may or may not be\nright, but it suggests to me -\nQUESTION: Well, why isn't it wrong? Why\nisn't, why isn't the Court of Appeals wrong on that,\nthe argument being that this is not a discovery\nstatute. This is not an ex parte communications\nstatute. This is not a Freedom of Information Act\nstatute. This is a blue ribbon committee statute.\nMR. MORRISON: No, Your Honor -\nQUESTION: And if you turn it into the\nlatter, you will stop -\nMR. MORRISON: It is partially -\nQUESTION: -- you will stop every --\nyou'll stop every lower level official in government\nwhen he is creating legislative policy from getting\non the phone and calling up whoever he pleases. You\nunderstand that argument. I want your response.\nMR. MORRISON: All right. Two responses.\nFirst, to some extent, it is an open government\nstatute because part of the relief under FACA is\ngetting access to all the documents that the\ncommittee prepares, including its minutes.\nSecond is that this statute does not\napply, except to committees. A committee under the\nPublic Citizen case requires a substantial level of\nformality. We concede that both this committee and\nthe Executive Office of the President and anyone else\ncan call anyone they want at any time without\ntriggering FACA. Only if you have a formalized\ncommittee and if you bring people in to participate\nin the same manner as other committee members -\nQUESTION: That would require voting.\nMR. MORRISON: Not necessarily, Your\nHonor.\nQUESTION: I have -- I have always been\npuzzled by that in your briefs, to participate in the\nsame manner as other committee members. It seems to\nme the essence of being a committee member is having\na vote in the outcome. So it seems to me the only\ndiscovery you would need is discovery as to whether\nanybody who was not a government employee voted.\nMR. MORRISON: That, Your Honor, I suggest\nis a question of law as to whether voting is\nrequired, but we believe that if outsiders\nparticipated in the marking up of drafts, they had\ninput into the drafts, particularly at the subgroup\nlevel, even though they had no formal vote -\nQUESTION: Why is that? If I bring\nsomebody else from my agency with me, I expect all of\nthese cabinet members didn't come to the meetings\nalone. They certainly had assistants with them.\nWere those assistants members of the committee?\nMR. MORRISON: They were -\nQUESTION: Certainly not.\nMR. MORRISON: They didn't lose the\nexception, Your Honor, because they were full-time\ngovernment employees.\nQUESTION: I'm not asking whether they\nlost the exception. I'm asking whether they were\nmembers of the committee, and the answer has to be\nno. Now, suppose I bring instead of another\ngovernment employee with me to give me advice, I\nbring a private individual with me to give me advice.\nSuddenly, that private member becomes -- private\nindividual becomes a member of the committee even\nthough a government agency member -\nMR. MORRISON: It is certainly a plausible\ninterpretation, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Not plausible to me.\nMR. MORRISON: Well, the statute says the\nexception is composed of, wholly composed of\nfull-time government employees. Congress was well\naware of this problem and it decided that it wanted\nto have a very narrow exception. At least it's an\narguable basis and we are now here on interlocutory\nappeal without any facts in the record whatsoever as\nto how these committees operated, how the subgroup\noperated. They may have had a vote at the subgroup\nlevel.\nQUESTION: What do you say about the\npresumption that high officials of the government\nobey the statutory provisions that they are supposed\nto follow?\nMR. MORRISON: Well -\nQUESTION: You don't have any information\nand belief that the people who are said to have been\nappointed were really not appointed, do you?\nMR. MORRISON: They were appointed. If I\nmay, Your Honor, a quote from the staff director's\naffidavit, which appears in the, in the joint\nappendix on page 76. He admits, and the Government\nadmits, that there were substantial numbers of\nmeetings between outside people and the task force.\nThe question is what happened at those\nmeetings, and that's what we seek discovery. This is\nnot simply an allegation. The General Accounting\nOffice -\nQUESTION: But that's all you would get if\nyou won the suit, and it goes back to Justice\nStevens' question. Isn't the posture of this case\none in which what happens at the end of discovery if\nyou prevail and get discovery is substantially the\nsame as if you won the suit.\nMR. MORRISON: Your Honor, we would get\nproperly reined in discovery, as the District Court\nunderstood it, we would get the basic information\nabout who went to the meetings, who had access to the\ndrafts, whether anybody had the right to vote. At\nthat stage of the proceeding, that's all the\ndiscovery we think we are entitled to.\nQUESTION: Do you think those are fairly\nconcluded within the separation of powers privilege\nthat the Government is asserting?\nMR. MORRISON: I do not think that the\nGovernment has any right to withhold that kind of\ninformation in this kind of case. And if the\nGovernment makes -\nQUESTION: But that's, but that's the\nissue.\nMR. MORRISON: Yes. And if the Government\nasserts that it has the right to withhold that\ninformation, it may continue to assert that right.\nThe District Court will then proceed under Rule 37,\nenter an order against it. It can then take an\nappeal from a final judgment and the question -\nQUESTION: Only if the District judge\nenters a default judgment, but that's just one of\nmany options. The District judge isn't required to\ntake that -\nMR. MORRISON: No. That is correct. And\nget -- the question is, should we try to anticipate\nwhat the District Court, District judge will do.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Morrison.\nMr. Orfanedes, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL J. ORFANEDES\nON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT JUDICIAL WATCH, INC.\nMR. ORFANEDES: Mr. Chief Justice, and may\nit please the Court:\nJudicial Watch submits there was no\njurisdiction in the Court of Appeals to review the\nDistrict Court's discovery orders, but assuming for\npurposes of argument that there was jurisdiction, we\nrespectfully submit that the District Court properly\ndenied Petitioners' motion to dismiss, both as a\nmatter of statutory construction and consistent with\nCircuit precedent and separation of powers.\nQUESTION: Well, that surely is one thing\nthat's not before us, is it, is the District Court's\ndenial of the motion to dismiss?\nMR. ORFANEDES: Well, no -\nQUESTION: I mean, it's not appealable.\nMR. ORFANEDES: That's correct. The\nGovernment is arguing, however, that the discovery\nthat the District Court did order should not have\nbeen ordered because of the underlying merits of the\nmotion to dismiss is my understanding of the\nGovernment's argument. We submit that that's a -\nQUESTION: They are arguing that it's not\nbefore us -- what they are arguing is that this\nstatute doesn't apply, so therefore there was no\ndiscovery. The statute isn't one under which you can\ngo behind the certification of the President, the\nVice President, et cetera. We both read their\nbriefs.\nMR. ORFANEDES: I think that's\nindistinguishable from arguing -\nQUESTION: Okay. Well then go ahead and\nmake the argument.\nMR. ORFANEDES: If you could allow me to\nproceed. The District Court ordered discovery\nbecause it believed that it was necessary in order to\navoid the constitutional issues that the Government\nis raising in their briefs. In denying the motion,\nthe District Court properly applied what was Circuit\nprecedent at the time and is Circuit precedent, the\nAAPS case, allowing for this de facto membership\ndoctrine that we have talked about.\nThe District Court thought that if\ndiscovery yielded information that would show there\nwere no, there was no involvement of private\nindividuals in the task force, then there would be no\nreason, no reason to even reach the constitutional\nissues.\nQUESTION: Involvement of private\nindividuals in the task force does not equate with\nmembership of private individuals in the task force,\nand I wonder what your view is about the question\nthat I asked to Mr. Morrison. What, what is it that\nmakes you a de facto member? It surely can't be just\nsitting there next to somebody else who is even at a\nfull committee meeting. It can't be sitting next to\nthe cabinet member.\nMR. ORFANEDES: I think the court in the\nAAPS case, that the District Court was relying on,\nand that the Circuit Court was also -\nQUESTION: Yes. Well, that case may be\nwrong. What is it that makes you de facto member?\nWhat -- I assume it's the same thing that makes you a\nmember, that is the power to determine the action the\ncommittee will take. That is the power to vote.\nMR. ORFANEDES: I think it's not looking\njust at voting, but whether or not there is anything\nthat functionally distinguishes the members, the de\nfacto members from the actual members.\nQUESTION: There is. The vote. Let's\nassume that's the only thing that distinguishes them,\nthe vote. Isn't that enough?\nMR. ORFANEDES: It could be a vote. But\nthere could also be -- it could also be more than\nthat, in this particular instance -\nQUESTION: If it's more than that, you are\nnot talking about de facto members. You are talking\nabout de facto participants, and that's a different\n--\nMR. MORRISON: In this particular\ninstance, there was one allegation we set forth in\nour complaint of policy recommendations that were\nconveyed to the Vice President and those\nrecommendations did end up mirroring recommendations\nthat were -\nQUESTION: Exactly. Now, their problem\nwith your interpretation of the statute, I take it,\nis the following. Forget the Vice President. You\nare Assistant Secretary of Antitrust.\nMR. ORFANEDES: That's correct.\nQUESTION: You are Assistant Secretary of\nHHS in charge of drug policy. You are trying to\ndevelop a legislative proposal. Every staff person\nin the Congress, given such a task, would phone\neveryone in sight who knows about it outside the\nCongress to try to develop sound proposals.\nAnd if it's a serious matter, they'd have\n50 meetings with everybody under the sun. And if you\nassigned the same thing, try to do the same thing\nunder your interpretation of the Act, every one of\nthose outside people could be hit with a discovery\norder, what meetings did you go to, what did you say,\nwhat did you do.\nAnd their final point is that Congress\ncould not possibly have intended in this statute to\nhave created that circumstance, putting government in\na cocoon when it develops legislative policy. Now, I\nhave overstated what they said, but I'm trying to get\na response from you as to what I take is their basic\npoint.\nMR. ORFANEDES: I think that's correct,\nJustice Breyer. I don't think -\nQUESTION: Well, you don't think it's\ncorrect.\nMR. ORFANEDES: I don't think -- I don't\nthink Congress would have created such a statute, and\nI don't think they did create such a statute.\nQUESTION: Cause.\nMR. ORFANEDES: The case law that has\ninterpreted the statute and the statute themselves\nrequires a certain degree of formality, structure and\ncontinuity to an advisory committee before, before\nthe requirements of the statute begin to apply.\nCircuit Court precedent, including the Nader vs.\nBaroody case, that I think all the parties have cited\nin their brief held exactly that. That there has to\nbe -- there cannot be ad hoc committee meeting or ad\nhoc committee members.\nQUESTION: Explain the degree of formality\nthat you think triggers the statute.\nMR. ORFANEDES: Well, certainly there has\nto be an establishing document, according to FACA. I\nthink there has to be some degree of understanding of\nwhat the membership of the committee is going to be.\nThere talks about an end point to the committee as\nwell.\nQUESTION: The Attorney General of the\nUnited States turns to the head of the Antitrust\nDivision and says I want a legislative proposal about\nWebb-Pomerene acts. You get together with your\ncounterpart at State, create an interagency task\nforce and give me a document, and he announces the\nwhole thing in a public speech. Now, do we have the\napplication, in your opinion, of FACA that would\ntrigger the questions I mentioned?\nMR. ORFANEDES: That, that may trigger the\nquestions that we made. And I think there is one\nthing that's important about this particular\ncommittee, and the document that established it.\nIt's a January 29th memorandum from the President.\nIt's in the appendix at 157, I believe.\nAnd in that document, the Vice President\nwas given the discretion to create subordinate\nworking groups. There is nothing in that document\nthat limits subordinate working groups to consisting\nonly of private employees.\nQUESTION: If the interagency task force\ncreates the FACA situation in your view, imagine that\nI have repeated my first question, but simply applied\nit to interagency task forces. If you remember my\nfirst question, it had to do with the cocoon.\nMR. ORFANEDES: Sorry.\nQUESTION: All right. Now, what is your\nresponse?\nMR. ORFANEDES: I think again what becomes\nimportant is the membership of that task force. And\nif that, if the idea behind creating that task force\nallowed for, in the AAPS case, outside consultants or\nconsultants of undetermined origin, in this instance\nsubgroups, without any limitation as to whether or\nnot they would be Federal employees or not Federal\nemployees, in that instance, the requirements of the\nstatute could be triggered.\nQUESTION: Those subgroups would report to\nthe full committee, I assume, they would not have any\ndispositive authority over what the report of the\ncommittee says, would they?\nMR. ORFANEDES: Well, there was nothing in\nthe originating document that described who those\nsubgroups would report to.\nQUESTION: Well, they are called\nsubgroups, aren't they?\nMR. MORRISON: That's whether or not -\nQUESTION: That seems to indicate that\nthey are under somebody. And I gather what they are\nunder is the committee.\nMR. ORFANEDES: It could very well be\nwhether they reported to the committee as a whole or\nto the executive -\nQUESTION: Well, that's fine. I don't\ncare who they report to. They are not the committee.\nMR. ORFANEDES: They are not the\ncommittee, but FACA includes within its definition of\nan advisory committee any subgroups or working groups\nof a committee.\nQUESTION: Well, if the, if the statute\nrequires disclosure of all these things, at the end\nof the day, as a final order, and discovery, when\nthey are hit with a discovery order, it gives them\nall the same information, why isn't the Government\nright, that this really is the essence of the suit\nand we should hear the merits of it now.\nMR. ORFANEDES: I don't think it is the\nessence of the suit. I think the appellate court\ngave some strong advice to the District Court to\nlimit discovery to two points, really. Number one,\nbeing the involvement, whether there were private\nindividuals involved.\nQUESTION: I don't know how the Court of\nAppeals -\nMR. ORFANEDES: -- and to what extent -\nQUESTION: -- can give any advice at all\nif it says it has no jurisdiction or the case is\nimproperly before it.\nMR. MORRISON: Well, I think -- and also a\nsignificant point to be considered in that regard is\nthat the Government did not object to the scope of\nthis, of the discovery that it was -- as it was\nserved. They had the opportunity, they had every\nopportunity to submit particularized objections,\nincluding privileges, but not just privileges, also\nobjections as to scope, relevance, materiality. The\nusual long litany of discovery objections that any\nparty is able to. They declined that opportunity.\nThe District Court was very careful. I\nthink he bent over backwards in inviting them to\nassert objections on several occasions. They chose\nnot to do so. So for them to come back -\nQUESTION: Suggesting that they -- they\nconsented to the discovery, but just they did not\nmake specific objections?\nMR. ORFANEDES: They did not make specific\nobjections. No. I'm not saying they consented to\nit. They were, they were clear in their objections\nto any discovery whatsoever, discovery that the\nDistrict Court felt it needed as a means of\nconstitutional avoidance in order to determine, first\nof all, whether the statute applies. And secondly,\nin order to narrow any constitutional issues that it\nmight have to consider if the statute did apply.\nQUESTION: In any case, they did not avail\nthemselves of the opportunity that the Court of\nAppeals has clearly given them now to whittle that\norder down.\nMR. ORFANEDES: That's correct. They have\nnot.\nQUESTION: But you are -- am I correct in\nthinking your case in the District Court was just a\nmandamus action, right? There is no cause of action\nunder the statute. And so in order to establish\nrelief on mandamus, you have to show a clearly, clear\nright to relief and jurisdictional defect, something\nalong that kind. You don't normally file a mandamus\naction and then get discovery to see whether you are\nentitled to mandamus.\nMR. ORFANEDES: Justice Stevens, we had\nactually several different counts in our complaint,\nwhich included, first of all, we did assert a count\nunder FACA. That was dismissed. We also asserted a\n--\nQUESTION: The FACA doesn't create a\nprivate cause of action.\nMR. ORFANEDES: That was ultimately the\nbasis for the dismissal.\nQUESTION: That's why it was dismissed.\nMR. ORFANEDES: But we also had an -- an\nAPA claim. And then ultimately -\nQUESTION: But you don't -- that also has\nno merit because the Vice President is not an agency,\nand neither is the group.\nMR. ORFANEDES: Well, the reasoning behind\nthe APA claim -\nQUESTION: The only viable claim you had\nwas the mandamus claim, as I understand it.\nMR. ORFANEDES: Well, the APA claim is\ncontinuing with respect to the agency defendants.\nThe heads -- I shouldn't say the agency defendants.\nQUESTION: And they have given you\nthe discovery you asked for, if I understand it?\nMR. ORFANEDES: Actually, they have -\nQUESTION: It's only the group itself that\nrefuses to give any discovery. And if I understand\ntheir position, if we give you discovery, that's just\nthe same as giving you a victory in the lawsuit.\nMR. ORFANEDES: The agency defendants have\ngiven us some discovery, but at the same time, they\nalso asserted objections as to executive privilege\nand deliberative process in answering our questions.\nThey did not give us any information about what role,\nif any, independent individuals, private individuals\nplayed in the deliberations of the task force.\nQUESTION: Could you just embellish your\nanswer to Justice Stevens' question a little bit?\nAnd that is, if you, if you get some discovery, and\nyou win your case, what do you get when you win that\nyou will not already have gotten by the discovery?\nMR. ORFANEDES: I guess I just want to --\nis this as a comparison to the discovery that, that\nwas ordered?\nQUESTION: Whatever the discovery is.\nWhatever the discovery is. You got enough discovery\nto win your case, you win it. What do you get then\nbesides a statement saying they were wrong, you win.\nMR. ORFANEDES: If discovery is limited to\nthe narrowing that the appellate court suggested,\nnone of that information, I believe, would be\nsomething that we would get under the statute if we\nwere to win. Under the statute, we are entitled to\nbasically the documents of the committee as limited\nby any properly applied exemptions of FOIA.\nQUESTION: You are saying you get more\ndiscovery?\nMR. ORFANEDES: I wouldn't -- no, we don't\nget more discovery.\nQUESTION: What are these documents that\nyou would get that you would not already have gotten\nat the discovery stage?\nMR. ORFANEDES: Well, the documents the\nappellate court was talking about, and in addition to\ninterrogatories which we don't get -- and actually,\nat one point the Government actually suggested that\ndiscovery take place on the basis of interrogatories.\nWe wouldn't get any interrogatory answers.\nQUESTION: So you would get documents?\nMR. ORFANEDES: We would get documents.\nQUESTION: And what documents would you\nget?\nMR. ORFANEDES: We would get, I believe\nthe statute allows disclosure of all of the documents\nof the task force subject to the limitations of FOIA.\nThe documents are produced as if the task force was\nan agency subject to FOIA, and all the exemptions\nthat FOIA applies, I believe, apply to these\ndocuments.\nQUESTION: So you'd get a broad disclosure\nis what you are saying?\nMR. ORFANEDES: That's right. I think the\ndiscovery as suggested or as narrowed by the\nappellate court is a much smaller subset of the\ninformation we would get if we were entitled to -- if\nwe ultimately prevail on the merits of the lawsuit.\nThere has been a couple of statements with\nrespect to our complaint being based on nothing more\nthan mere unsupported allegations. That is a false\nstatement, in our view. In order to support our\nclaims, we are relying first and -- first and\nforemost on the statement in the memorandum creating\nthe document that says the Vice President has\ndiscretion to create subordinate working groups.\nThen we also attach several statements,\nacknowledgments by the Government, that describe\nmeetings between task force representatives and\nrepresentatives of Enron and representatives of other\nworking groups. I believe the Government itself\nacknowledged there were at least five such meetings.\nWe know that the Vice President met with the chairman\nof Enron, Ken Lay. The Vice President himself in an\ninterview he gave on Nightline said we met with all\nkinds of folks, we met with energy groups, we met\nwith environmental groups -\nQUESTION: When does that -- I don't see\nhow that's -\nQUESTION: What does that prove?\nMR. ORFANEDES: The point is that this\nshows the involvement of outside -\nQUESTION: They talked to a lot of people,\ngot a lot of advice, but does that make them de facto\nmembers of the committee?\nMR. ORFANEDES: Well, that's the question\nthat we are seeking to answer through our discovery.\nThe point is that this is not an unsupported, these\nare not mere unsupported allegations.\nQUESTION: Well, I'm not sure that's\nright. Just because you said they talked to a lot of\npeople doesn't really prove anything, it doesn't seem\nto me.\nMR. ORFANEDES: Well, if you put that\ntogether, the allegations of the individuals that\nwere met with, with the statement in the memorandum\nthat allows the Vice President discretion to create\nworking groups, we think it does at least raise a\nsignificant question as to whether outside\nindividuals were participating in these working\ngroups and participating in the committee as a whole.\nIn any event, the District Court firmly\nbelieves that it needed this discovery in order to\nanswer these questions. I see my time is up.\nQUESTION: Yes. Thank you, Mr. Orfanedes.\nGeneral Olson, you have five minutes left.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON\nON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS\nQUESTION: General Olson, I hope you'll\naddress the point whether you'll, whether you'll have\nto disclose anything more at the end of the suit than\nyou will under the discovery. Is there a big\ndifference between what they get under the discovery\norder and what they would get if they win the suit?\nGENERAL OLSON: Thank you, Justice Scalia.\nI was going to address that point because it's been\naddressed by Justice Souter, Justice Stevens, Justice\nKennedy. What the discovery -- and I don't have time\nto read the interrogatories or the requests for\nadmissions, but those require the production of all\ninformation with respect to any contacts at all\nbetween any member of the task force or any\ngovernment employee that assisted with it or any\nagency -\nQUESTION: Those were all within the scope of\nthe order that the District Court gave?\nGENERAL OLSON: Yes. Those were the\ndiscovery and requests for admissions. Now, the\nCourt of Appeals didn't refine that. It said that,\nwell, that's pretty broad, and it should be narrowed\ndown, but it should be whatever is necessary to prove\ntheir case.\nThey thought what was necessary to prove\ntheir case was to have all outside contacts. FACA\ndoes not require the production of that degree or\nthat scope of documents. It has to do with minutes\nand drafts and things that were actually considered\nby the committee. So the discovery is vastly broader\nthan the relief that would be available if FACA\nexisted. Secondly -\nQUESTION: General Olson, I thought that\nthe, what the Court of Appeals said is there could be\ndiscovery on two issues. And one was what\nnon-Federal offices participated, and two, to what\nextent. Judge Tattle and Judge Edwards were both\npretty clear on that, that that would be the nature\nof the discovery permissible.\nMR. ORFANEDES: Well, of course. But\nthat's exactly what those requests for admissions in\nthose interrogatories seek. All contacts between any\nmember of the committee or any other government\nemployee and any outside person. And then what Judge\nTattle and what -- went on to say at page 18-A, that\nis to say the discovery they need to prove their\ncase.\nQUESTION: The point is it's different,\nisn't it?\nGENERAL OLSON: It's -\nQUESTION: They want stuff on discovery\nthat has to do with who said what to who. And if\nthey win, they get a different set of things which\nare the documents of agendas, et cetera.\nGENERAL OLSON: Well, it's -\nQUESTION: Is that right?\nGENERAL OLSON: It's different, but it --\neverything that they have asked for in those requests\nfor admissions and those interrogatories, Justice\nBreyer, include everything they would get under FACA\nand a whole lot more. So -- and there is no question\nabout that.\nNow, with respect to the subordinate\nworking groups, a point was made with respect to the\nPresident's directive, that the President said the\nVice President may establish subordinate working\ngroups to assist. The declaration that's in the file\nat page 240 of the Joint Appendix specifically says\nthat the Vice President authorized that, but the Vice\nPresident did not establish any such subordinate\nworking groups.\nAnd then the declaration goes on to say\nthat there was only a public citizen that was\ninvolved in developing graphics and that sort of\nthing. And that was the only person that was\ninvolved. No such individuals, the individuals named\nin the litigation, participated in the working group\nformulation.\nWhat we are saying here is that the\nconstitutional immunity from discovery that we are\ntalking about here is rooted in the overriding\npresumption of regularity, which, if repealed in this\ncase, would repeal -- if overridden in this case\nwould repeal the exemption under FACA for all\ngovernment working groups.\nAnd these are exclusive functions,\ntextually committed to the President of the United\nStates getting opinions from his subordinates. As\nyour question suggested, Justice Breyer, virtually\nanything that the President might do, asking the\nAttorney General or the Assistant Attorney General\nfor this or that to formulate something, and they go\nout to talk to people, that could be a -- that would\nbe a FACA lawsuit in a heartbeat.\nThere is no statute that creates the right\nthat the Petitioners seek here. There is no, there\nis no cause of action under FACA, and there is, no,\nJustice Stevens, no clear remedy, no clear right to\nwhich they are entitled to ministerial duty and\ntherefore a remedy. And they just jumped over the\nfact that the statute didn't give them the right to\nbring this case and brought it in the form of\nmandamus.\nMandamus is no substitute. It's not\nappropriate here. It's a pure circumvention of the\nstatute. There is, we submit, no such thing as a de\nfacto member of an advisory group under FACA. FACA\nwas intended to address the creation of de jure\nworking groups where the President would cloak\nhimself in the benefit of public citizens who have\ncome up with this proposal. It's not, I think your\nquestion, Justice Breyer, it's not a FOIA case. It's\nnot a -\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you,\n"
