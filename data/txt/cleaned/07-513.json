KARLAN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMS. KARLAN: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice\nand may it please the Court:\nIn February 2004, the Dale County circuit\nclerk told the local sheriff's department that the court\nwas recalling a warrant that had been issued earlier for\nPetitioner's arrest. Having received that notice,\nsomeone in the sheriff's department physically removed\nthe warrant from the file and physically took the\nwarrant back to the court clerk's office. But no one\neither then or later in the sheriff's department ever\nupdated the computer file to indicate that the record\nhad -- that the warrant had been recalled. As a result\nof that police department error, the Petitioner in this\ncase was subject to a warrantless arrest for which there\nwas no probable cause five months later.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Didn't they have\nsome regular system for updating the computer base? I\nmean, I assume it was updated at some point.\nMS. KARLAN: No. Your Honor. There was\nno -- there's nothing in the record to suggest that this\ndepartment ever does, for example, what the FBI does,\nwhich is to conduct periodic audits. Had they conducted\none, they would have discovered almost instantly what\nthey discovered five months later, which was there was\nno warrant in this case. So this --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So people who are,\nyou know, the warrant is served, they're arrested, they\ngo to trial, they're in jail, their name still shows up\nas having a warrant out for their arrest.\nMS. KARLAN: We don't know, Mr. Chief\nJustice, because this is a department that as far as the\nrecord reflects conducts no audits of any kind to update\nits files. And if you look at page 41 and page 60 of\nthe joint appendix, one of the things you'll discover\nabout this department is that everyone in the department\nhas access to the physical place warrants are kept.\nThey're kept in several different places in the office.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well then, how did\nthis warrant clerk, I guess is what I'd call her,\ndiscover the error? She discovered it within 10 or 15\nminutes, right.\nMS. KARLAN: She discovered it because what\nhappened is a clerk in another police department called\nand said, is there a warrant for Petitioner's arrest.\nShe looked at the computer list on her computer and said\nyes. Then this other warrant clerk said, please fax us\na physical copy of the warrant. So she went to the file\nwhere the warrant should have been. It wasn't there.\nShe went to another file. The warrant wasn't there.\nShe then called the court clerk's office and discovered\nthat they had recalled the warrant which was back in\ntheir records five months earlier.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why did the first --\nfirst person in that scenario need a physical copy of\nthe warrant?\nMS. KARLAN: The record doesn't reflect\nthat, but she simply I guess wanted to verify that there\nactually was a warrant because they were picking\nPetitioner up in a different county.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Does your argument depend on\nthe quality of the recordkeeping in this particular\ndepartment? I thought your argument would apply even if\nthis department had excellent recordkeeping procedures\nbut nevertheless made a mistake in this instance.\nMS. KARLAN: That's correct, Justice Alito.\nOur view is, just as is true with respect to probable\ncause, the fact that 99 percent of a department's\narrests are with probable cause doesn't mean that when\nthey arrest someone without probable cause you say,\nwell, you get one bite at the apple or a sort of \"good\nenough for government work\" theory.\nJUSTICE ALITO: You're not asking for\nArizona v. Evans to be overruled are you.\nMS. KARLAN: No. We're asking to you apply\nArizona v. Evans. And if I could give an answer to the\nquestion the Chief Justice was asking earlier that comes\nfrom Arizona v. Evans, what happened in Arizona v. Evans\n-- and Justice Stevens mentions this in his dissent\nthere -- is the clerk discovered there, the court clerk\ndiscovered, that the warrant that had been, that she had\nverified, had in fact been recalled. And so what they\ninstantly did is they checked their files, and they\ndiscovered four other warrants from that same day that\nhad been recalled but that were still in their files.\nHere we didn't have anything done after they\ndiscovered the error. They discovered this error and,\nas they say, have gone on their merry way. There's\nnothing in this record --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, there was\nsomething done in this particular case, though, right?\nThe warrant clerk notified -- was it the Coffee County\npeople?\nMS. KARLAN: Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- that the warrant\n-- that the information she had given 10 minutes before\nwas inaccurate.\nMS. KARLAN: Yes, Mr. Chief Justice. And\nthat indicates part of what we're concerned about here,\nwhich is this is a department that was built for speed,\nnot for accuracy.\nJUSTICE ALITO: But none of that matters for\nyour argument, does it?\nMS. KARLAN: Oh, no.\nJUSTICE ALITO: You want to make it -- you\nwant to draw a clear line between errors by -- by\nclerical court employees versus errors by police\nemployees.\nMS. KARLAN: That's correct. We think\nthat's the most workable argument, because what we want\nis a system in which suppression hearings can be\nconducted expeditiously based on the facts of particular\ncases.\nJUSTICE ALITO: How expeditious would it be\n-- suppose there's negligence on the part of both a\ncourt employee and a police department employee. What\nis the judge supposed to do in deciding the suppression\nmotion? Is this a comparative negligence determination.\nMS. KARLAN: I don't think it would be\nexactly a comparative negligence determination. I think\nit -- that raises a difficult question and the way I\nwould approach that question is to perhaps use some of\nwhat Justice Kennedy talked about in Hudson as a\ncausation approach. That is, if but for the negligence\nof the police department there would have been --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I thought negligence is\nirrelevant here. I think if the police department was\nwrong, even if they had been very careful but for some\nreason or other they made a mistake -- so you're arguing\nfor shear causality, not for negligence. If negligence\nmade the difference then we'd have to go into these\nfactors that you say are very difficult to calculate.\nMS. KARLAN: Well, Justice Scalia, I was\nanswering Justice Alito's question and if I could just\ngive a little bit of --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I know you were answering\nhis question, but you want to answer it in a way that's\nconsistent with your argument here.\nMS. KARLAN: Well, it is, Justice Scalia.\nSo let me explain why it's consistent, which is our\nposition is if police department error causes an\nunconstitutional arrest then you should suppress\nevidence, but if both the police were negligent and the\nclerk was negligence and the police department's\nnegligence.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You've injected the word\n\"negligence.\"\nMS. KARLAN: Okay, let me take the word\n\"negligence\" out then. If the police error didn't cause\nthe discovery of the evidence --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Alone, but --\nMS. KARLAN: -- that's correct.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- there is dual\ncausality.\nMS. KARLAN: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It isn't a matter of simple\nnegligence.\nMS. KARLAN: No, that's correct. That's\ncorrect.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How is it going to\nkeep --\nJUSTICE ALITO: How are -- how are you going\nto determine whether there's error without determining\nwhether there's negligence? Suppose the court clerk\ncalls up the police department and says the warrant is\nstill outstanding, and in fact it's not. And it sends\nthem over a physical copy of a warrant, but that warrant\nhas been withdrawn. Now, the police could always take\nadditional steps: They could send someone over to check\nthe records, to look at the court docket to make sure\nthat the warrant had not been withdrawn. So there would\nbe causality, but it would not determine what they\nshould --\nMS. KARLAN: There would be no police error\nthere.\nJUSTICE ALITO: -- what their duty was.\nHow are you going to determine where this error should\nbe -- should be assigned?\nMS. KARLAN: Because in that case there\nwould be no police error. What this Court held in Evans\nis that police departments are entitled to rely on the\nrepresentations of court clerks that there are warrants.\nSo if the court clerk erroneously sends a warrant over,\nthe police are not required to look behind that warrant,\njust as they're not required in Evans.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Let me give you another\nexample. Suppose that the court clerk calls up and says\n-- it leaves a message, gives a message to somebody in\nthe police department. And they memorialize that, and\nthey say \"called up.\" And let's say the warrant number\nis the same as the docket number of this case. So the\ncourt employee says -- writes down \"Called up,\" says,\n\"Warrant quashed in warrant, in case 07-513.\" The court\n-- the police department has a record of the call, and\nthey say, \"Received call from court clerk. Warrant to\nbe quashed. Warrant quashed in case 07-531.\" And so\nthe 513 is not quashed; the person is arrested. Now,\nwho caused that? You have to have a hearing?\nMS. KARLAN: The police -- the police\ndepartment person caused that by writing down the wrong\nnumber.\nJUSTICE ALITO: How do you know that the\npolice department wrote down the wrong number?\nMS. KARLAN: Well, it's the same question as\n--\nJUSTICE ALITO: How do you know what number\nwas --\nMS. KARLAN: Well, it's the same question as\nin Evans: How do we know who made the mistake? That\nquestion, just like the question -- is a question on\nwhich you're going to have to hold a hearing because\nEvans says if it was court error, there is no\nsuppression; and our position is, if it was police\nerror, there is. But that's a very manageable hearing.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Just so I have your theory\nfirmly in mind, you would say there is police error even\nif what happened was that there was an unpredictable and\nunavoidable computer glitch, no negligence on anybody's\npart? The computer simply malfunctioned, got it wrong.\nIt wasn't negligence. You would still say that that is\npolice error, and you would say that that counts against\nthe admission of --\nMS. KARLAN: That's correct. As long as\nit's police error, it counts against the police.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Why, if there is no\nnegligence? Why do you need to argue that and why do\nyou argue that? I mean doesn't there have to be at\nleast negligence on somebody's part?\nMS. KARLAN: Well, here's the problem:\nThere are two kinds of negligence you might have; that\nis, you might have the negligence of an individual\nemployee, or what you might have is a decision to use a\nshoddy recordkeeping system that doesn't catch those\nerrors. So the question is --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, either of those\nthings are negligence or worse.\nMS. KARLAN: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So what I didn't understand\nis why you would charge the police with anything or\nsuppress a warrant where there was a mistake but no one\nwas negligent or worse.\nMS. KARLAN: Well, we have had some\ndifficulty finding any reported cases in which there is\na police error of the kind of computer glitch that was\njust hypothesized. That is where the machines --\nJUSTICE BREYER: But what you argued for --\nMS. KARLAN: Yes. What --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- you said, it should be\nsuppressed even if no one is negligent or worse. And I\nhave trouble seeing why you're suppressing a warrant\nwhere no one does anything wrong at all.\nMS. KARLAN: Well, part of what I'm trying\nto get at in my answer to your question is it's unclear\nin that situation whether anyone has done something\nwrong; that is, whether somebody in the police\ndepartment programmed the police department computer --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Let's just assume the\nhypothetical -- the hypothetical: The computer\nmalfunctions.\nMS. KARLAN: Well, you could have an act of\nGod exception to exclusionary rule, if you wanted to,\nbut this case doesn't ask you to do that.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm sure a computer might\nbe compared to God, but let's --\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Could I ask this question\n--\nMS. KARLAN: It's more powerful sometimes.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Could I ask this question?\nYou're saying that the question is whether anybody did\nanything wrong at all. This is not undisputed, that\nthis person was illegally arrested? The arrest itself\nviolated the Fourth Amendment.\nMS. KARLAN: There is no question that as a\nmatter of fact --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: The question is whether it\ncan be justified.\nMS. KARLAN: Yes. This was a warrantless\narrest without probable cause. And the question is:\nDoes the government have some sort of affirmative\ndefense as to why it should be allowed to use this?\nNow, in Evans --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's a separate\nquestion. It may be an illegal arrest, but the question\nis the separate one of whether or not you exclude the\nevidence collected incident to that arrest. And we\nhave, in several cases, separated the two questions, and\nI guess it's difficult for me to see if no one has done\nanything wrong, no one, why you would suppress the\nevidence in that case.\nMS. KARLAN: Well, that case of course is\nnot this case, and you might want to leave open the\nquestion of the --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, but you have\nthis difficulty: Do we have to get into negligence, or\nshould we assume, as I understand to be your theory, as\nJustice Breyer put it, that you would still suppress the\nevidence when no one has done anything wrong?\nMS. KARLAN: We are asking in this case for\nyou to suppress when someone has done something wrong.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But how do you know? How\ndo you know? That's the problem.\nMS. KARLAN: Well, we do know that someone\ndid something wrong here, because we know --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But we want an answer --\nMS. KARLAN: No, I'm trying to answer --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: We want an answer to the\nquestion.\nMS. KARLAN: No, I'm trying --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Let's assume no one did\nanything wrong.\nMS. KARLAN: I know. I'm trying to answer\nthat question.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- because this bears on\nthe fact of why are we doing this at all.\nMS. KARLAN: No. I'm trying to answer that\nquestion, and the point I wanted to make is: This case\nasks for a narrow rule, but the question that you may\nalso want to be thinking about here is how to have a\nworkable suppression hearing. And if you require\nshowings of different levels of fault, rather than\nasking was this police-generated error, the suppression\nhearings are going to be somewhat more cumbersome. So\nyou have a choice.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Exactly. You give\nsomething, you get something. If you adopt a negligence\ntheory, the --\nMS. KARLAN: We would be happen with the\nnegligence theory.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- the noose is not as\nwide, but on the other hand it's a lot harder to\ncalculate whether you -- every case involves an inquiry\ninto whether there's police negligence or not.\nMS. KARLAN: That's exactly what I'm --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: A much easier rule, was\nthere a warrant or not? If there wasn't, end of the --\nend of the inquiry.\nMS. KARLAN: Well, that's exactly why I --\nwhy I said I think the easier rule for judges faced with\nsuppression hearings is a rule that says --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I mean, I don't know what\nthe underlying law is here. I mean -- I guess it's\nlittle weird, but what happens if the policeman arrests\nthe wrong person, but it's nobody's fault? You know,\nthe person was pretending to be his brother.\nMS. KARLAN: Well, that's like --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Or the mother said it's\nJohn and it's really Joe. And so, the policeman wasn't\nat fault. They arrest the wrong person. I guess that's\nhappened in history --\nMS. KARLAN: Sure.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- but do they suppress\nthings then? I wouldn't think so --\nMS. KARLAN: Well, there are two different\n--\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- but maybe they do.\nMS. KARLAN: There are two different kinds\nof cases where police arrest people: One set of cases\nwhere the policeman is arresting on the basis of\nprobable cause, and there, there's a lot of room for\nerror that is based on the facts. The mother told him\nit was Joe when it was really John. That's good enough,\ngood enough, because that's probable cause.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But do we suppress?\nMS. KARLAN: No, you do not --\nJUSTICE BREYER: We do not? Okay.\nMS. KARLAN: There was not even a Fourth --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So there's no reason then,\nif we don't suppress when there's no error in the part\nof the policeman, none, it was just a weird\ncircumstance, then I don't understand why we would\nsuppress here. And nor do I understand why you have to\nargue this because I thought it's clear here that there\nis error, and it was negligently caused. There were\nfour months that went by without anybody doing anything\nabout this mistake.\nMS. KARLAN: No. That's correct. If I can\njust say one thing that will make this perhaps a little\nclearer, Justice Breyer, you would not even find a\nFourth Amendment violation in the first place in the\nhypothetical you gave because there was probable cause\nto arrest.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Isn't there probable cause\nhere?\nMS. KARLAN: Probable cause to do what?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: He thought he had a\nwarrant; he had probable cause to arrest.\nMS. KARLAN: There is no such thing as\nprobable cause to believe there's a warrant. You\nyourself in Hudson said it's a bright-line rule. Either\nthere's a warrant or there isn't. Here there was no\nwarrant.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's just\nrephrasing it. It's probable cause based on the\nexistence of a warrant, and it turns out to be there is\na mistake in the warrant.\nMS. KARLAN: This Court has never said that\nbefore, which is it's not probable cause to believe\nthere's a crime because there's a warrant. It's --\nyou've always separated those two lines of cases for --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It doesn't seem to make\nsense, though. Why should we separate the two?\nMS. KARLAN: Well, because here --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: If the policeman is\nmistaken about whether he saw this guy picking\nsomebody's pocket, he's mistaken about that, and in that\ncase, the search is -- the product of the search is\nadmitted. In the other case he's mistaken about whether\nthere was a warrant. Why do you want to draw a line\nbetween those two?\nMS. KARLAN: Well, for two reasons: One is,\neven in the probable cause case, if the reason he\nthought there was probable cause is another officer told\nhim there was probable cause and that officer was wrong,\nthis Court said in Leon you continue to suppress. Here,\nthis police officer was told by other police personnel\nthat there was a warrant, and there wasn't. So it's a\ncase just like the cases post-Leon -- you suppress when\nthe chain of information is fatally flawed by police\nerror, which is what happened here.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, you would impose\na burden on the officer on the street serving a warrant?\nWhen he gets the call saying there's a warrant, he's\nsupposed to say, \"Are you sure? Did you double-check\nwith the clerk? When was the last time they updated the\ncomputer system? I don't want to go through all this if\nthe evidence is going to be suppressed.\" At every chain\nin command, you would impose that burden.\nMS. KARLAN: No, I would not, Mr. Chief\nJustice, because if you announce that police error is\ngoing to lead to the suppression of evidence, the police\nwill do a better job of maintaining their records.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes, but I mean I\ndon't know what the situation is like --\nMS. KARLAN: And then you won't have this\nproblem.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I don't know what\nthe situation is like in Dale County. They probably\ndon't have the latest version of WordPerfect, or\nwhatever it is. They are probably making do with\nwhatever they can under their budget and doing the best\nthey can.\nMS. KARLAN: But there's not a Barney Fife\ndefense to the violation of the Fourth Amendment either.\nIf a department is having its records kept the way they\nare keeping them here, then suppression is the only\nthing that tells them: You're going to have to --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, you said this\nwasn't anything in the record about what type of program\nthey might have, whether they were updated. They found\nthe mistake in ten minutes.\nMS. KARLAN: Which suggests if they had been\ndoing a good job of maintaining their records all along,\nthis violation never would have occurred.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, what's the\njustification for drawing a distinction between a court\nemployee and everybody who works for the police\ndepartment? Suppose the person who makes the mistake in\nthe police department is a -- a person who holds a\nunionized position where advancement is based purely on\nseniority, or it's a civil service position where the\nperson is -- is totally protected from any sort of\nadverse job consequences as a result of displeasure\nabout or pleasure about how the job is being -- being\nperformed.\nAnd what's the justification for drawing a\ndistinction between errors committed by those two\nemployees just based on where they fit in the\norganizational box?\nMS. KARLAN: Well, three things: One is the\npolice themselves are often unionized and protected from\nretaliation.\nSecond --\nJUSTICE ALITO: What if it's not a police\nofficer; it is not a law enforcement officer? It is a\nclerical employee, or it's a computer guy.\nMS. KARLAN: Well, I think that the clearest\nline is inside the police and outside, and let me give\nyou a couple of reasons why. The first reason --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, one is that you --\nyou are stuck with the Arizona v. Evans, which says if\nit's the court --\nMS. KARLAN: Well, if it's the court, yes;\nbut I -- I was going to give some reasons why the police\ndepartment should be treated as an integrated whole.\nOne reason why is in many departments\nofficers, sworn officers, who are on desk duty for\nphysical disabilities and the like, perform clerical\ntasks.\nThe second is on the record in this case.\nWe don't know whether it was a sworn officer who removed\nthe warrant from the file or it was a clerk, and there's\nno way of finding that out now.\nA third reason, if I could just point to\nthis --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Sure.\nMS. KARLAN: -- this Court, for just a\nmoment, is clerical personnel, support personnel --\nthere is a reason they are called \"support personnel\".\nThey support the mission of the office, and here this\noffice decided to maintain its records in a particular\nway and to have this quick reference file and the like,\npresumably to support --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But the Coffee\nCounty people aren't called \"support officers\" for the\nDale County police.\nMS. KARLAN: They are support for the\npolice, and this Court has --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Now you keep saying\nthis when you did this in your brief. You just call\neverybody \"police,\" \"police,\" \"police,\" when the\nquestion is whether there's a distinction between the\nCoffee County police and the Dale County police for\npurposes of applying the exclusionary rule.\nMS. KARLAN: This Court, at least since\nElkins, has recognized that police departments often\noperate across the board. If I could point to Leon\nitself, in Leon the search was conducted by California\nmunicipal police, and the evidence was used in Federal\ncourt.\nAnd this Court never suggested, not even for\na minute, that the fact that the evidence was obtained\nby State-level -- local-level police and used in a\nFederal prosecution was relevant to the question whether\nor not it should be suppressed. Because what the Court\nis trying to do in the exclusionary rule, as I\nunderstand it, is to deter future violations.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's crucial to your case\n--\nMS. KARLAN: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- really, that you -- that\nthe police will not keep good records unless -- unless\nwe let the criminals go.\nMS. KARLAN: That they need a powerful\nincentive.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And that's the theory of\nthe exclusionary rule as --\nMS. KARLAN: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- as has been expressed in\nwritings in some of our prior cases. Things have\nchanged a whole lot since we adopted the exclusionary\nrule, and I think it's quite -- policing has become much\nmore professional, and I think it's quite unrealistic to\nthink that if we don't adopt the rule that you -- that\nyou propose, police -- police departments will just\nwilly-nilly not keep track of warrants. I -- I just\ndon't think that's true. That's not professional\npolicing, and -- and I think to say -- to apply the --\nthe severe remedy that you propose in this -- in this\narea at this date seems to me excessive.\nMS. KARLAN: Well, we don't think this is a\nsevere remedy, and we think that the professionalism of\nthe police is in substantial part a response to the\nmessage that the exclusionary rule sends, which is\neither you professionalize your police departments or\nthe evidence they obtain is going to be suppressed;\neither you maintain good records or the reliance on\nthose records is going to lead to suppression.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You don't think that --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: We don't know if these\nrecords are good, bad, or indifferent. As far as this\nrecord shows, this could be an isolated incident, or it\ncould be typical of what goes on. We just don't know.\nMS. KARLAN: It could be, and if I can just\npoint to -- if you look at the Government's brief at\npage 48, they talk about how the FBI maintains its\n\"Wanted\" lists now. And they show that due to a list of\nreforms they were able to cut the error rate there from\nabout 6 percent to about 3 percent. None of those\nreforms, limited access to entry, periodic audits, is\ndone here. And the last available published data, which\nwe cite in our brief about -- about Alabama, is that\nthey had about a 13 percent error rate. That is, 13\npercent of the --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you are back to\narguing that there was negligence, and that that's\npertinent.\nMS. KARLAN: Well, in this case there was\nnegligence, and you need not go any further than that.\nIf the Court has no more questions, I'll reserve the\nremainder of my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMiss Karlan.\nMr. Dreeben, we'll hear now from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. DREEBEN: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nThe exclusionary rule under this Court's\ncases has always been a balance between the interest in\nachieving some deterrence of police misconduct and the\nhigh cost of excluding probative evidence of criminal\nactivity. The exclusionary rule does not put the error\nback in the box. It does not correct it. It serves\nonly as incentives for future compliance to avoid future\nFourth Amendment errors.\nIn this case, where nothing is shown other\nthan a negligent and isolated clerical error in the\nmaintenance of warrants, there is no showing that\nsuppression of evidence will achieve the kind of\nappreciable deterrence that this Court has said is\nnecessary before the exclusionary rule is applied.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do we assume on the\nbasis of the record that there is negligence in this\ncase?\nMR. DREEBEN: The district court did find\nthat there was negligence. There is very little in the\nrecord, Mr. Chief Justice, that explains precisely what\ndid happen. But I would take issue with my colleague's\ncomment that the record shows that there were no\nauditing procedures. The record simply was not made on\nwhether there were auditing procedures.\nWhat the district court did find based on\ntestimony is that the Dale County Clerk's Office and the\nDale County Sheriff's Office both had a reliable system\nof recordkeeping on which law enforcement could rely.\nThat's a finding of the district court.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Now, Ms. Karlan made\nthe point -- and I'd like to get your response to it --\nthat if we adopt something that depends on the showing\nof negligence, that that will require extensive hearings\nin every case into exactly what their computer update\nsystem was, and so on.\nMR. DREEBEN: Mr. Chief Justice, I actually\nthink that negligence alone should not be enough to\njustify suppression, because it would not produce the\nappreciable form of deterrence that this Court has said\nis warranted. But I also think that --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: May I interrupt you there?\nI mean, why do you say that? I mean, we -- we have --\njust getting outside the criminal law for a minute, we\n-- we've got a whole system of personal liability law in\nwhich the theory is that, in effect, requiring\ncompensation for negligence, even though it is not an\nact of bad faith or malice, is -- is going to affect\nconduct. Why do you assume it will not affect conduct\nhere?\nMR. DREEBEN: I'm not sure that it won't\naffect conduct to some degree, Justice Souter. I think\nthe exclusionary rule requires far more than saying that\nit might affect conduct, and I think that what the Court\nshould look at --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Don't you think it's\nprobable that it will affect conduct? I mean, if the\npolice know that they are going to lose the case because\nthey are engaging in a negligent or objectively\nunreasonable way in -- in relation to their\nwarrant-keeping, they are going to be more careful.\nMR. DREEBEN: I think the incremental change\nin police behavior will be modest at best, and I think\nthis is crucial to my view of the case.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: They -- they won't know\nthat they are going to lose a case. What they will know\nis that if they happen to arrest someone whom they\nshould not have arrested anyway, they won't be able to\nprosecute him, right?\nMR. DREEBEN: That's precisely so.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So they are saving\nthemselves nothing. I mean, this person would not have\nbeen stopped. I mean, if the difference was we -- we\ncaught a criminal and we could have convicted him except\nbecause of the clerical error we can't, but that's not\nthe situation. They would never have found this fellow\nbut for the clerical error.\nMR. DREEBEN: Justice Scalia, if you take it\n--\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But they -- but they also\n--\nMR. DREEBEN: -- if you take it --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But they also, as in this\ncase, in the course of -- of committing their -- their\nnegligent arrest find evidence of a crime.\nMR. DREEBEN: They do. But from an ex ante\nperspective, Justice Souter, they can't know that, but\nthey do have --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: They can't know that, but\nwe all know, as a practical matter, that that's why\npolice want the -- the greatest scope to the arrest\npower.\nMR. DREEBEN: No, I think that --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Because in the course of\ndoing incidental searches, they find things. They know\nthat, and we know that.\nMR. DREEBEN: Justice Souter, what I think\nit's important for the Court to know is that the\npolice have ample incentives as it stands to try to make\ntheir recordkeeping systems as accurately as possible.\nThe police do not have an interest in believing that\nthere is an outstanding warrant for someone's arrest\nwhen there is not.\nThe first reason is that an arrest situation\nis a highly dangerous encounter for police officers.\nIt's not one to be undertaken lightly. That's why this\nCourt has rules that govern searches incident to arrest\nin order to remove potential weapons from suspects. The\npolice don't want to convert what would be an otherwise\nroutine traffic stop or no stop at all into a felony\nencounter that could go bad for all concerned.\nSecond, there is --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Is there a 1983 violation\nhere?\nMR. DREEBEN: On the facts of this case,\nJustice Kennedy, I would not say there is 1983\nliability. It's a litigable issue whether there would\nbe the potential for a plaintiff to show, as the\ndefendant in this case did not try to show, that there\nwas a degree of deliberate indifference to a need to\nhave a reliable recordkeeping system such that some\nofficial would be personally liable for the failure to\nhave that.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I suppose if the concern\nwere that the police would become sloppy, then a 1983\nsuit would be more likely?\nMR. DREEBEN: Yes. I think a 1983 suit, and\nthere is ample evidence that many such suits have been\nbrought, and we cite cases in our brief and the\nPetitioner cites cases in his brief.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Dreeben, can I go back\nto your point you were just making. What incentive does\nthe police department have to withdraw warrants that\nhave been cancelled? Why not just leave them there? As\nlong as they are there, it would justify an arrest.\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, that assumes, I think,\ncontrary to this Court's assumption of good faith on\ngovernmental actors --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: If you put aside good\nfaith for the moment. If you just think in terms of\nincentives of officers, would they not have an incentive\njust to leave everything there?\nMR. DREEBEN: No. There are three reasons\nwhy they would not. The first is the danger factor, as\nI mentioned.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: The existence or\nnonexistence of the warrant doesn't affect the danger.\nMR. DREEBEN: Oh, it certainly does, because\nit converts what would otherwise be not a stop at all or\na reasonable suspicion stop into a felony arrest. And\nwhen the police are undertaking an arrest, this Court\nhas recognized that suspects often have an incentive to\nescape or to use weapons to resist --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But the incentive exists\nwhether there is a warrant in his pocket or not.\nMR. DREEBEN: If there is no warrant, there\nwill be no arrest. And that's why the police have an\nincentive to clean up the records so that they don't\nsend out the police on warrant situations when there is\nno warrant.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Dreeben, what you've\nsaid about the danger to the arresting office -- officer\nand so they don't undertake an arrest lightly, doesn't\nfit with the facts of this case. This was a police\nofficer who really wanted to go after the defendant. He\nexpected -- he suspected defendant was a bad guy. So\nthat's how this all started. So he called his own\ndepartment, do we have any warrant, and then the next\ncounty's department. But this was an officer who wanted\nto go after the defendant.\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, Justice Ginsburg, I\nassume that the Court will make its decision not based\non the conduct of Officer Anderson in this case, but in\nan assessment nationwide of whether the exclusionary\nrule is necessary because the police lack incentives to\nkeep warrant systems up to date. And I'm giving reasons\nwhy institutionally the police do have that incentive\nand, therefore, undertake those kinds of efforts.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And there are three\nreasons. One is to reduce the incidence of arrests, so\nthey don't have the hazard of felony arrests.\nNumber two is?\nMR. DREEBEN: The second reason is police\nresources. It takes a lot of time and energy to\nundertake a felony arrest. Many jurisdictions have\ndedicated warrant forces which seek to serve outstanding\nwarrants, and they don't want to spend their time doing\nit on warrants that have been recalled.\nSimilarly, in a case like this, the police\nhappened to find drugs on Petitioner's person and a gun\nin his car, but if they had found nothing and taken him\ndown to the station house and booked him, that would\nhave been taking two police officers off the street for\nan afternoon, wasting their resources so that they're\nnot engaged in the kind of protection of the community\nthat the police force wants to do.\nAnd the third reason is that it does not\ncreate community goodwill to undertake arrests when\npeople do not have warrants and simply because of a\nmistake in police records they're hauled downtown.\nThat's the kind of thing that creates friction between\nthe police and communities.\nJUSTICE BREYER: There is one question I\nhave in my mind, and it's the only factor I thought of\nhypothetically that cuts against you. This is the\nargument and I'd like you to respond to it.\nI take everything you said as so. I'll\nassume all that. And so I'd still say the rule, the\nbasic rule of suppression, putting Leon to the side,\nbasic rule is -- the opposite of Holmes: If the\nconstable blunders, you suppress the evidence. Okay.\nNow, our prior case -- here we have a case\nwhere the constable blundered. I grant you, not the\narresting officer. It was a different policeman, and it\nwas a different form of error. But five months this\nthing -- this warrant had been recalled five months\nearlier and you agree that it was negligent. Therefore,\nthe constable blundered. And the virtue of our earlier\ncase where we said don't suppress, it wasn't the\nconstable who blundered. So I see an absolutely clear\nline: If the constable blunders you suppress; if it's\nsomebody else who blundered, you don't.\nNow, every time I've tried to think of a\nsubstitute for that clear line, I've run into trouble.\nI've been sitting in my chambers with my law clerks and\nwe've tried out five substitutes, and I can't find one\ndecent substitute that isn't filled with problems.\nMR. DREEBEN: Justice Breyer --\nJUSTICE BREYER: What is your substitute?\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, my first answer, Justice\nBreyer, is that this Court's exclusionary rule\njurisprudence already draws a number of careful lines\nbased on the balance that --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Right. Well, I'm\noverstating my point. What I'm really driving at and\ntrying to show you is you, if you want to have a\ndifferent rule than within the prior case, remember the\none where it wasn't the police that blundered, you have\nto come up with some rule. And I want to know what your\nrule is.\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, the rule, to state it\nsimply, that I think should govern this case is: An\nisolated and negligent police clerical error in the\nmaintenance of warrant records should not lead to\nsuppression. And the reason for that is there are ample\nincentive for the police to attempt to correct their own\nrecords such that the exclusionary rule would not\napprove --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So now we have -- let's\nthink about that. The special rule is now we have the\nLeon exception and now we have a new exception, and the\nnew exception is called for isolated police clerical\nerrors. Well, that's going to be interesting, I\nsuspect.\nThe first thing you'll have when you try to\nimpose your rule is you will have the defense attorneys\nthroughout the city going in to see if it's an isolated\nerror. And they will, of course, have a right to decide\nwhether or not this is the only such error, whether\nthere are other clerical errors, how often they occur,\nwhat the -- is that an administrable rule?\nMR. DREEBEN: I think it's highly\nadministrable. It doesn't create that many problems.\nThis exclusionary rule hearing is an illustration. The\nwarrant clerk for Dale County was on the witness stand.\nThe warrant clerk for Coffee County was on the witness\nstand. The arresting officer was on the witness stand.\nAll of those people were asked, do these errors occur\nwith frequency? They said: They don't; our system is\nreliable.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And if there were\npervasive deficiencies, I assume that's exactly what we\nwould inquire about under 1983?\nMR. DREEBEN: That's correct, Justice\nKennedy.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And would you add 1983 as\nnumber four to your list?\nMR. DREEBEN: Yes, I would add number -- I\nwould add 1983 possible liability as an additional\nincentive, just as it was remarked in Hudson that it\nprovides for additional incentive for --\nJUSTICE BREYER: One other question.\nSuppose that the error here consisted not of a computer,\nbut rather Joe, who is the policeman, has a partner\ncalled Sam, and Sam told Joe that this is Harry Smith,\nwhen negligently it wasn't Harry Smith? It was Joe\nSmith.\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, I think --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, I mean does that\ncount as a clerical error if, in fact, it's the man's\npartner who tells him this negligently?\nMR. DREEBEN: I'm with Miss Karlan on this\none. I don't think that's a Fourth Amendment violation\nat all. I think under Hill v. California --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Negligent. It's Negligent\npolice work.\nMR. DREEBEN: Yes. It's a mistake.\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's negligent error.\nYou mean we don't suppress the negligent errors of the\npartners who, after all, say, let's arrest this man over\nhere, and through negligence they have got the wrong\nman? We don't suppress?\nMR. DREEBEN: I think that that's a very\nclose case, and I don't think that this Court --\nJUSTICE BREYER: There must be millions --\nnot millions, but there must have been cases where two\npolicemen or one policeman goes off to arrest someone\nand negligently arrests the wrong man. And when he does\nthat and does a search, we don't suppress.\nMR. DREEBEN: What we know about that from\nthis Court's cases is that if one police officer has a\nwarrant and it's, he obtained it based on an affidavit,\nthat's purely a bare-bones --\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's Leon. I'm not\nthinking that.\nMR. DREEBEN: No, it's actually not Leon.\nIt's Whiteley versus Warden. And I'm positing a warrant\nthat was completely based on a bare-bones affidavit. So\nit would not pass the Leon test.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I'm not thinking of a\nwarrant. I'm thinking of a policeman who has a warrant\nfor Jack Smith and he goes to arrest Jack Brown because\nthrough negligence he went to the wrong house. Now,\nunder those circumstances would we suppress the drugs\nthat happen to be found in Jack's house.\nMR. DREEBEN: I don't think it's so clear\nfrom this Court's cases.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, there must have been\na lot of cases.\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, not in this Court.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But what about the lower\ncourts? What have they done?\nMR. DREEBEN: I'm not so aware that there\nare so many of them in the lower courts where it's\nnegligence. Most often the kind of mistakes that's\nmade, the courts say it's within the realm of probable\ncause if it's a reasonable mistake. If it's an\nunreasonable mistake, negligent mistake, I would be\nprepared to say that the lower courts are probably today\nsuppressing. And this Court doesn't have to decide\nwhether that's correct in order to decide this case.\nThis case --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Do we use the word or the\nphrase \"good faith\" in writing the opinion if we write\nit your way?\nMR. DREEBEN: I don't think the Court needs\nto use the word \"good faith.\" The Court used the words\n\"good faith\" in Leon. It's repeated it in all of its\nso-called good faith exclusionary rule exceptions.\nWe're talking about an objective rule, and the line that\nI think that the Court should draw today is between\nisolated negligent errors and errors that result from a\nmore systematic or widespread pattern, the kind that\nJustice O'Connor referred to in her concurrence in\nArizona v. Evans.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You would allow all of that\ninquiry every time there's a motion to exclude. That\nwould not just be the basis for 1983. You still want\nnegligence inquiry.\nMR. DREEBEN: I don't want it. I'm saying\nthat the Court doesn't have to reach the issue today of\nwhether a widespread pattern of errors or complete\nneglect --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Thank you. That's a little\ndifferent.\nMR. DREEBEN: Yes. That's not to say --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: What about reaching -- what\nabout reaching your standard in cases in which the\narrest is wrong, not because there's no warrant, but\nbecause there's just slightly less than probable cause?\nIf there are isolated incidents of that are we going\nto -- are we going to say that in fact that does not\nviolate the Fourth Amendment?\nMR. DREEBEN: I think that's a very\ndifferent -- well, whether it violates the Fourth\nAmendment or not would turn on whether there is in fact\nprobable cause. If there is no probable cause, and I\nunderstood your question, Justice Souter --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No. We're starting with\nthe assumption that there is a violation of the -- I\nthink we're starting with background law at this point\nthat there is a violation of the Fourth Amendment if\nthere is an arrest without probable cause or without a\nvalid warrant.\nMR. DREEBEN: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: The warrant itself may be\nsubject to attack, but at least that's sort of the front\nline of our objective reasonableness inquiry. And\nyou're making a dent in the warrant requirement for\nisolated incidents, and I don't see why we can't or why\ncoherence would not require us to make the same dent in\nthe probable cause requirement for equally isolated\nmistakes.\nMR. DREEBEN: I think it's simply a\ndifferent inquiry, Justice Souter, because, as I tried\nto explain, in this area the Court can note a number of\nincentives that law enforcement has to keep its warrant\ndatabases accurate and up to speed.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Dreeben, can I ask a\nbackground question? How frequent does the issue in\nthis case arise?\nMR. DREEBEN: In my experience, Justice\nStevens, not that frequently.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: That's my understanding,\ntoo.\nMR. DREEBEN: And I think --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: It seems to me the case\nmay have more symbolic importance than practical\nimportance.\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, I think that the\npractical importance of it and the legal importance of\nit is what, kind of a balance is the Court going to\nstrike under the exclusionary rule. We heard a lot from\nPetitioner today about how the exclusionary rule would\nhelp make police engage in better practices. We heard\nnothing about the costs of the exclusionary rule.\nCompared to, for example, to --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Are there any cases where\n-- this is a drug peddler here that was caught. Are\nthere any cases involving violent criminals that have\nbeen affected by the outcome of this case?\nMR. DREEBEN: Some in the lower courts have\ninvolved violent crime, and I think this case would look\nand feel very different if evidence of a murder had been\ndiscovered in the car. And that just accentuates the\npoint that the exclusionary rule comes with a price to\nsociety. It's not free.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Dreeben, if we adopt\nyour formulation that isolated negligence doesn't count,\nis it clear that that's all there was in this case?\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, that's all that the\ndistrict court found. The district court had evidence\nand made a finding that there was no pattern of\nviolations like this, that the system of recordkeeping\nwas generally reliable. This is the findings of the\ndistrict court that are on page 17a and 18a of the\nPetitioner appendix. The district court concluded:\n\"There is no credible evidence of routine problems with\ndisposing of warrants and the warrant clerk herself\ncould not recall other instances like this.\"\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, if Miss Karlan's\nfigures are correct in Alabama there would be\nsuppression.\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, there was no record made\nwhatsoever on what Alabama's overall --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No. I said if her figures\nare correct and there's a 13 percent error rate either\nin the State of Alabama or at least in the department\ninvolved that we'd have suppression there.\nMR. DREEBEN: Unless -- if the Court is\nprepared to say that the exclusionary rule is going to\nfunction differently on a State by State basis depending\non the statewide error rate, which I think is an unusual\nthing for the Court to do --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, it's going to\nfunction -- even on your theory, it's going to function\ndifferently on a department to department basis\ndepending on the error rate.\nMR. DREEBEN: Upon a -- Not just upon a\nshowing of an error rate, but upon a showing that a\nparticular recordkeeping system that produced an error\nwas conducted in a manner so that you could say much\nmore than negligence was involved here.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, if you've got a 13\npercent error rate I think you've got a pretty good\nprima facie case.\nMR. DREEBEN: You do. I would concede you\nhave a good prima facie case. I would want to know more\nto know what that really means because with a lot of\nthese statistics --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But the fact is unless the\n\"more\" showed that they were getting a 13 percent error\nrate in a negligence-free system, you would have\nsuppression there and you would not have suppression\nthere in the town next door or the county next door or\nthe State next door.\nMR. DREEBEN: If the Court adopts a rule\nthat says that a showing of more than isolated\nnegligence would justify suppression, you're correct. I\nwould note, though, that --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But I thought that\nbasically was the distinction that you were arguing for.\nMR. DREEBEN: No. I think I clarified to\nJustice Scalia that I think all the Court needs to\ndecide today is that an isolated negligent error in\npolice recordkeeping should not result in suppression.\nIt should not hold today because it's not confronted\nwith today --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But I take it if you're not\naccepting -- if you're not accepting -- I mean, you're\nnot accepting the proposition that the 13 percent error\nrate which is not somehow shown to be non-negligent\nshould have a different result, you are saying in the 13\npercent case we're still not going to suppress.\nMR. DREEBEN: I would reserve the right to\nargue that the exclusionary rule's costs outweigh its\nbenefits even if that is shown in a particular case\nbecause there are a myriad of other reasons why the\npolice would have an incentive to improve that.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But if you -- if you were\nto make that argument and it came down to that bald a\nproposition, I assume you would come in with some kind\nof evidentiary basis to tell us exactly what the cost\nis. And you have spoken of the cost today. You have\nnot spoken of the benefit and the value of having\nrelatively error-free arrest recordkeeping. But I\nhaven't heard anything about the unreasonable cost of\nthe exclusionary rule --\nMR. DREEBEN: Well I think --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- beyond the record.\nMR. DREEBEN: It's manifested in it every\ncase in which reliable probative evidence is suppressed.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Sure, sure it is. But that\ndoes not even get us to, as it were, to half the\nequation. We want to be know how much of that there is\nand we want to be able to measure against that the value\nthat society is getting by requiring valid arrest\nwarrants and in a probable cause case by requiring\nprobable cause. And you can't just walk in and say,\nwell, there's a cost. We know there's a cost.\nMR. DREEBEN: I don't think, Justice Souter,\nthat the Court has ever looked for an empirical count of\nhow many cases.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Don't you think we should\nif we are in effect -- if you are making what sounds to\nme like an empirical argument -- there is a cost to\nsociety, cases are being lost, criminals are going free\n-- don't you think that we ought to have a factual basis\nto know what that cost is?\nMR. DREEBEN: If the Court wants one in\norder to justify the exclusionary rule, then it probably\nneeds to go back to scratch and start all over again.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: We've done an exclusionary\nrule now and in effect you are arguing for an exception\nto it because the cost is too great, and it seems to me\nthe burden is on you to tell us what the cost figure is.\nMR. DREEBEN: I will say this, Justice\nSouter. If the cost is very low because very few cases\nresult in suppression, then deterrence is also very low\nbecause there are very few cases in which evidence is\nbeing suppressed.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But if you take that\nargument to the extreme, we won't have an exclusionary\nrule at all, I suppose.\nMR. DREEBEN: But my argument today does not\nrequire the Court to take that step at all because this\nis an area in which there is a local geography of\nincentive pertaining to the accuracy of warrants that\nallows the Court to conduct the balance in a way\ndistinct from what it might do if it's confronted with\npolice negligence or if it's confronted with a\nwidespread pattern of negligence.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Of course, if you did the\ncost-benefit analysis the way Justice Stewart would, the\ncost is always zero to the State because they would not\nhave had the evidence if they had obeyed the law.\nMR. DREEBEN: Yes, but I think, Justice\nStevens, that form of looking at the question has been\nrejected in this Court's cases that have recognized that\nthe exclusionary rule has to pay its way because in\nevery case in which it results in suppression there is a\ncost to society and the benefit therefore needs to be\nappreciable and this Court needs to be confident of that\nbefore it concludes that what the Court called the\n\"massive remedy of exclusion\" is applied in any\nparticular case.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We know what the\ncost was here, right? I mean, not just a drug peddler,\nbut somebody with an illegal weapon found in his car, a\nweapon that presumably he would use on an occasion in\nwhich it was in his view appropriate to do so.\nMR. DREEBEN: Correct. There was benefit in\nthis very case and cost if the evidence is suppressed.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But don't you take -- I\nunderstood you to take the position and I thought the\nCourt had previously taken the position that the cost\nbenefit analysis had to be a systemic one.\nMR. DREEBEN: I think that that's correct,\nJustice Souter, but I'm not aware of any case in which\nthe Court has said the exclusionary rule has costs and\nnow we need to see the numbers of statistically how many\ncases result in suppression. I'm just not aware of any\ncase in which the Court has done that.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, I think that's -- I\nthink that's true. I mean, we operate -- quite think\nfrankly we operate on the basis of a -- of a good guess\nand I think your argument is saying let's have -- let's\nhave an exception to the good guess. And if -- if you\nstart with a good guess as the baseline it seems to me\nyou -- you ought to have something more than another\nguess to justify the exception.\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, Justice Souter what my\ncase comes down to today I believe is the proposition\nthat when we are talking about clerical errors made by\nthe police, there are ample incentives for the police\nnot to make those clerical errors that I've described\nearlier, such that the incremental benefit of the\nexclusionary rule which we know has a cost; it has a\ntangible cost in every case in which it's applied; does\nnot pay its own way. In other words, there is no\nsufficient incremental deterrence to warrant taking an\nisolated negligent error in a generally reliable system\nand saying we need to suppress evidence anyway; and\nPetitioner's argument goes farther than the isolated\nnegligent error case. It says even if the police have\ndriven the error rate down as low as it's humanly\npossible by committing mass amounts of are resources to\nwarrant database systems in order to avoid suppression,\nwhich is what the Petitioner's theory posits, you should\nstill suppress; and that seems to me nothing other than\nthe return to the theory when there is a Fourth\nAmendment violation, suppression automatically follows;\nand this Court --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But that's not what we\nhave here, and we have a 13 percent error rate. If this\ncase goes your way, the police have limited resources;\nwhy should they spend them on upgrading their computer\nsystem when if there is an error it wasn't matter?\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, it does matter, Justice\nGinsburg, because the police officers that I'm familiar\nwith and the agencies that I'm familiar with as\nexemplified by the NCIC which is the national database,\nsays that the last thing that we want to do is send\nofficers mistakenly out on a felony arrest where they\nare going to be placed in a potentially dangerous\nsituation spending community police resources to arrest\nsomebody who should not be arrested. This is not what\nthey want to do. They have a good reason to avoid being\nplaced in that situation and I would caution the Court\nagainst relying on a 13 percent figure in a study that's\nsubmitted in a brief to this Court for the first time\nwithout any kind of adversarial testing. That is not I\nthis think a reliable basis for the Court to infer that\nthis particular police department had that kind of an\nerror rate or that the exclusionary rule is necessary to\nprevent it from having that kind of an error rate or\neven that there were no procedures in place to prevent\nerrors and warrants from remaining in the system.\nThe record simply doesn't show that. The\nwarrant clerks were on the stand and neither party asked\nthem the question so this Court doesn't have the\ninformation to say today was there a system that would\nhave ferreted this out. We know that if there was it\nfailed in this case.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: In Hudson versus Michigan,\ndidn't the Court engage in a very broad balancing of the\nsocial costs and the potential for increase in\nviolations in saying that there was no necessity for the\nsuppression rule in the no-knock case?\nMR. DREEBEN: Yes, Justice Kennedy; the\nCourt did just that and it began with the outset that\nthe massive remedy of suppression of evidence is a high\nsocial cost that should not be borne by society, not\njust the police, by all of us, unless appreciable\ndeterrence will result as a benefit; and the Court then\nexamined the incentives that the police had not to make\nillegal no-knock entries and to add that whatever\nincremental benefit there might be from exclusion was\nnot justified in light of the possibility of 198e\nliability and the increased professionalism of the\npolice which has made it less necessary to make the\nexclusionary rule a remedy of first resort rather than\nlast resort. While this Court could conceptualize the\ncase as one in which the government is looking for an\nexception to the exclusionary rule, I think it's more\naccurately one where the Court should extend the\nexclusionary rule to cover negligent police clerical\nerrors. For the first time, at this day and age when\n1983 recoveries have become effective --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: How many 1983 recoveries\nhave there been when someone says the police, they\nconvicted me on the basis of this evidence that wasn't\nsuppressed, but they committed a Fourth Amendment\nviolation so I should prevail in the 1983 action? How\nmany defendants in that situation have ever won a 1983\naction?\nMR. DREEBEN: No one knows, Justice\nGinsburg, because a great many of these cases will\nsettle out of court, but our brief does provide examples\nof conduct that was more serious and more egregious than\nanything involved in this case resulting in situations\nwhere courts denied summary judgments to the defendants\nand ordered the cases to go to trial.\nAnd I'm not suggesting that in a case like\nthis -- may I complete the answer -- there should be a\n1983 remedy, but I am suggesting that civil remedies\nwill provide incentives to the police to avoid the bog\nof litigation by putting into place systems that will\nprevent this kind of error.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Dreeben. Miss Karlan, you have eight minutes\nremaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAMELA S. KARLAN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nJUSTICE BREYER: Can I use 30 seconds of\nyour eight minutes because I want some clarity on this.\nMS. KARLAN: Absolutely.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Divide in your mind two\nseparate things: The nature of the bad conduct: is it\nnegligent, reckless, deliberate; and the other question\nis who engaged in it -- a police department official or\nsome other official?\nI thought this case was about the second\nquestion, but now I'm confused about the first question\nbecause I suppose a policeman, an arresting officer\nmakes a negligent error. He goes to the wrong house.\nAnd he never looks at the number; and he arrests, starts\nto arrest the wrong person: Is the evidence suppressed?\nIf the evidence isn't suppressed, frankly, I\ndon't see why a clerical official should be held to a\nhigher standard; but if the evidence is suppressed then\nquite possibly the clerical official should be held to\nthe same standard. So you've heard the government say\nwell, the answer isn't clear; very often a negligent\nofficial -- a negligent officer would not have that\nevidence suppressed. Well, what is it?\nMS. KARLAN: The answer to your question,\nJustice Breyer, is if the police officer in your\nhypothetical was negligent the evidence would be\nsuppressed. There are cases where the mistake of the\nofficer was a reasonable mistake, that is. He did not\n--\nJUSTICE BREYER: He was not.\nMS. KARLAN: Then he was not negligent.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I want to know if he is\nnegligent.\nMS. KARLAN: If he is negligent --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Excuse me, because I think\nI'm getting a different view from the government.\nMS. KARLAN: I'm absolutely certain that the\nanswer is if he was negligent then there was not\nprobable cause; if there was not probable cause and one\nof the other exceptions to the exclusionary rule does\nnot apply, then the evidence will be suppressed.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And the definition of\nnegligence is that he was not objectively reasonable?\nMS. KARLAN: That's correct.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. So we've got\nthis --\nMS. KARLAN: And the rule we are asking for\nhere -- the narrow rule for our Petitioner is when you\nhave negligent error by police officials, you suppress\nbut as Justice Scalia pointed out in my colloquy with\nhim earlier, that rule is perhaps slightly less workable\nthan a rule that says all error.\nNow we have given you a workable rule here\nand we still have not heard I believe a workable rule\nfrom the government; because what Mr. Dreeben tells you\nis that under some circumstances there will be\nsuppression. And I just want to make up with factual\ncorrection here which is about the 13 percent. It was a\nstudy by the FBI. It's a very dated study because they\nhaven't done a more recent one and it was statewide.\nBut let assume for purposes of argument here that if 13\npercent of the errors in the file are there because the\npolice are not maintaining their records properly, there\nought to be suppression of a warrantless arrest based on\nthat because otherwise you're really telling the\ndepartment that \"good enough for government work\" is,\nyou know, one out of six warrants is invalid, one out of\nseven warrants is invalid, but that's okay.\nSo then what you would have to have in each\ncase is a hearing, and at the hearing we would be\nentitled to discovery --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But in that -- but in that\nhypothetical I think it might be easy to say that the\npoliceman on the beat was not objectively reasonable in\nrelying.\nMS. KARLAN: But Justice Kennedy --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But that's certainly not\nthe case here.\nMS. KARLAN: But Justice Kennedy, if you\nbelieve in the government's rule we should have a right\nto audit that system to show that 13 percent of the\nwarrants --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I agree with that. If --\nto say with Mr. Dreeben that we don't have to decide\nthat today is just unrealistic. We have to decide today\nwhether we are going to adopt a rule that down the road\nwill turn every exclusionary request into a pretrial\ninvestigation of the procedures of the police.\nMS. KARLAN: Yes. That's --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And a major -- major trial.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Not the procedures\nof the police. The officer is on the stand and you say,\nall right, you've been here a while, how many times have\nthese warrants turned out to be wrong, just as simple as\nit was in this case? And he says, gosh, this is the\nfirst time that I've had this question.\nMS. KARLAN: But one of the things we know\nfrom the oral argument and the transcript in Evans is\nthat clerk said this is the first time there has ever\nbeen an error, and it turned out there were four errors\nthem made the same day.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay. Cross-examine\npeople. These people are under oath, you cross-examine.\nYou say, I don't think that's right. How many times?\nIt's not that big a deal to find out on what basis the\narresting officer was acting.\nMS. KARLAN: Right. But we would be\nentitled I think, Mr. Chief Justice, to say to the clerk\non the stand, have you ever conducted an audit? She\nsays, no, but our system is reliable.\nAt that point I think we are entitled to an\naudit. That is we are entitled to hire an expert at\ngovernment expense to figure out how many times this\ndepartment has gotten it wrong.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Isn't your rule also going\nto require hearings. If negligence is required --\nMS. KARLAN: The hearing in this case --\nJUSTICE ALITO: -- you are going to have to\nhave a hearing on whether there was negligence. And if\nso, who was negligent. If only causation is required,\nyou're going to have to have a hearing on who caused it.\nMS. KARLAN: Justice Alito, we had a hearing\nin this case that's adequate to the rule that we have\nand it took approximately two hours.\nJUSTICE ALITO: And will that be the case in\nevery instance?\nMS. KARLAN: It will be the case more often\nthen that you'll have a two-hour hearing that you have\nto show isolated --\nJUSTICE ALITO: How do you know that? What\nbasis do you have for saying that? How do you know\nthat? How many of these hearings have you examined?\nMS. KARLAN: Hearings in which there was no\nwarrant? I have examined none, but I can't imagine that\nit would take more than two hours. In this case it took\ntwo hours.\nAll you have to do is figure out who said\nthere was a warrant when there wasn't one. Was it a\ncourt employee under Evans? The answer is then clear.\nYou let the evidence in. Was it not the court, that is,\neverybody concedes that the court called, everybody\nconcedes the warrant was removed, everybody concedes\nthat the warrant went back? Then you answer it that\nway.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose it were an agency\nlike INS or Customs in which they have many people that\nare not sworn officers or some that are, does it make a\ndifference who answered the phone?\nMS. KARLAN: I don't think the sworn officer\ndistinction makes a difference. I think the agency\ndoes.\nIf I can refer to the State cases here, I\nthink they can illustrate how to answer your question\nmore precisely, Justice Kennedy. That is, a number of\nStates suppress evidence under these circumstances, and\nthey ask what's a question of law that then applies to\nall future cases, which is, is this agency an adjunct of\nlaw enforcement or is it something else?\nSo, for example, in California, the\nDepartment of Corrections, not. They are not an\nadjunct. So errors by the Department of Corrections,\nevidence is admitted. The State of Florida, the\nDepartment of Motor Vehicles is an adjunct. So there if\nthe Department of Motor Vehicles makes the mistake,\nthere is suppression.\nThis rule has been --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: In Rand we said this is\nexactly the inquiry we are not going to make.\nMS. KARLAN: I'm not sure.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Rand was where we had a\ntraffic stop made by a narcotics officer. And the\nquestion was, well, he was going outside his\njurisdiction. We said we are not going to get into the\nway police departments are organized. We are just not\ngoing to do it.\nMS. KARLAN: That's correct.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: That's Rand.\nMS. KARLAN: No. I understand Rand\nperfectly well, Justice Kennedy. But the question here\nis not a Rand case. It's what counts as the police?\nAnd that's the only question we are asking you to answer\nhere, is what counts as the police? Everyone who works\nfor the police department. When they make an negligent\nerror, that's enough.\nNow, let me turn for just a moment to the\nquestion of the bloated records and their incentives.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's your bottom line\nposition, it has to be a negligent error?\nMS. KARLAN: In this case, yes. Yes. I'm\nperfectly happy --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What is the position you're\narguing for?\nMS. KARLAN: We are arguing for negligent --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You want to adopt a rule\nthat's only when it's a negligent error?\nMS. KARLAN: We are arguing for that rule\nbut wanted you to understand that there is a tradeoff as\nyou identified earlier. Our rule is, I think, a clean,\nnarrow rule. It may require, as Justice Alito has\npointed out, slightly more detailed hearings.\nLet me turn now to this question of the\nincentives, which is the incentives of departments, as\nillustrated in this case, are to leave the question of\nmaintaining records to the end of the line in spending\ntheir resources, because they are not going to have to\nserve these warrants. These warrants serve as an\nopportunity to stop and arrest someone they otherwise\nwouldn't be able to stop and arrest here, because they\nlike probable cause.\nAll they had to do to cite -- Justice\nKennedy, to cite Rand to you is if they wanted to follow\nhim for a while, I'm sure they could have found a motor\nvehicle violation at some point. But they didn't even\nwant to do that. They just wanted to use this\nwarrant --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So that's assuming\nbad faith on the part of the police.\nMS. KARLAN: No, it's good faith.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: They want to arrest\nhim, so they follow him until they find a motor vehicle\nviolation.\nMS. KARLAN: This Court has said it's\nabsolutely fine and it's not bad faith.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But you're\nsuggesting it's bad faith --\nMS. KARLAN: No, I'm not suggesting that.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- because they --\nbecause they don't want to have to worry about getting a\nwarrant that might be wrong?\nMS. KARLAN: No, no. That's not what I\nsaid, Mr. Chief Justice. May I please --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What was the point\nof -- well, sure, as long as I'm asking the questions,\nyou can answer.\n(Laughter).\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What was your point\nthen? You're saying, well, they want to get this guy\nand they don't have to go through the warrant or\nanything else. They can follow him, find the broken\ntaillight and then they would have gotten that guy. I\nthought that was the point you were trying to make?\nMS. KARLAN: No. The point I was -- the\npoint I was trying to make is that there are other\ntechniques here if you haven't as yet inarticulable\nsuspicion that somebody is a bad guy that you can use\nthat to comply with the Constitution. What you can't do\nis rely on a warrant that doesn't exist, and then turn\naround and say police error, but we are entitled to rely\non our own error.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: May I ask one question,\nChief.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Sure.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Your -- your comment seems\nto assume that these warrants just lie there and the\npolice only use them incidentally. I have always\nassumed that when a warrant is out, part of the job of\nthe police is to -- is to arrest the person. Isn't that\nthe case?\nMS. KARLAN: Well, there are really two very\ndifferent kinds of warrants out there, Justice Scalia,\nas I understand it. One is warrants the police go and\ntry and find themselves, and then they are trying to\nserve those aggressively. But there are a lot of\nwarrants like this one that sat in a file for five\nmonths, nobody tried to serve it during the vast\nmajority of that time because a lot of these warrants,\nas is true in this case, are for failure to answer a\ncalendar call or for not paying a parking fine on time\nor for not sending in your fine on a motor vehicle.\nIn the Ott case that we cite it was failure\nto pay child support.\nSo those are not the kinds of things where\nthe police are serving the warrants aggressively.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you\nMiss Karlan, the case is submitted.\n(Whereupon, at
