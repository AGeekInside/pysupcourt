ENGLERT, JR.\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. ENGLERT: Thank you, Justice Stevens, and\nmay it please the Court:\nThis case comes to the Court in a remarkable\nposture. If you agree with the Hobbs Act arguments in the\nblue briefs, you should reverse the jury verdicts and\ndirect entry of judgment for the defendants. But even if\nyou believe the arguments in the red and gray briefs, you\nshould still reverse, but for a new trial. And whatever\nyou do on the Hobbs Act, you should reverse the RICO\ninjunction because RICO simply does not authorize private\ninjunctive relief.\nNow, why do I say so starkly that even\nrespondents and the Government's theories require reversal\nof the jury verdict? Because the attempts in those\nbriefs, to salvage the theory of plaintiffs' case, concede\nthat someone must obtain the victim's property for the\noffense of extortion to be shown. And the whole reason\nthe Court granted cert on the Hobbs Act issue was to\nreview the Seventh Circuit's holding directly contrary to\nthose concessions that, quote, a loss to, or interference\nwith the rights of the victim is all that is required,\nclosed quote. Likewise, the jury was instructed that all\nit had to find was that the defendants caused someone,\nquote, to give up a property right, closed quote.\nYou will find in the red and gray briefs very\nelaborate efforts to suggest meanings of obtain and\nproperty under which the record in this case supposedly\ncould support a finding that petitioners obtained some\nabstract form of property from the clinics or women. But\nno defense of the Seventh Circuit's holding and the jury\ninstructions that substituted the phrases, interference\nwith and give up for obtaining.\nquestion that some form of reversal is required.\nNow, the reason why there should be reversal for\nthe entry of judgment for the defendants, and not just for\na new trial, is that respondents and the Government's\nbrief-formulated conceptions of obtaining and property are\nwrong. The essence of the theories is that petitioners\nobtained control over the use and disposition of clinic\nassets. To refer to that as obtaining property of\nanother -- the language of the Hobbs Act -- is an awfully\nbroad use of language. It's a far cry from the New York\nlaw on which the Hobbs Act was based.\nQUESTION: I suppose in some instances one\ncompetitor can buy another competitor's firm and just\nclose it up in a regular business transaction, and that --\nthat would be obtaining it in that sense. Now, of course,\nI recognize that title transfers, et cetera, et cetera.\nHere the result is about the same.\nMR. ENGLERT: No, Your Honor. Respectfully,\nit's not. My clients don't have the clinic's property\ntoday as they would if they had, in fact, obtained it.\nThey may have temporarily interfered with some use of it.\nQUESTION: Let's assume that the -- that the\nboycott or -- or the protests are sufficient to close it\ndown. They have obtained it in a certain sense in that\nthey have obtained -- they have secured for themselves the\nuse that they want of it, i.e., no use.\nMR. ENGLERT: That is a sense of the word\nobtain, but it's not the sense relevant for interpreting\nthe Hobbs Act for several reasons. One is the Hobbs Act\nhas historical predecessors that this Court has said\nshould be looked to in interpreting its terms.\nQUESTION: You -- you concede it's a sense of\nthe term obtained? I mean, would you really speak of\nobtaining somebody's property when you -- when you\ninterfere with that person's use of it?\nMR. ENGLERT: Well, I certainly don't -- I'm\nsorry, Justice Scalia. I certainly don't concede it's a\nrelevant sense of obtain.\nBecause of -- because of the Hobbs Act\nhistorical antecedents, because of the rule of lenity,\nbecause of the very odd use of language, for all those\nreasons, that's not how the Court should interpret obtain.\nBut more important than any of those things is\nthe implications of such a theory. When Carry Nation went\ninto saloons with her axe and destroyed property, she\ncertainly interfered with the property owner's unfettered\nuse and control over disposition of his assets, and that's\nexactly what she intended to do. Was that extortion?\nThe civil rights boycott of white merchants that\nthe Court considered in Claiborne Hardware certainly\naffected the ability of the boycotted merchants to use\ntheir property and involved isolated acts of violence as\nwell. Was that extortion?\nThese aren't hypothetical concerns.\nQUESTION: Of course, that -- extortion wasn't\ncharged in that case, was it?\nMR. ENGLERT: No, Your Honor, but were the Court\nto uphold the theory in the red and gray briefs, which\nwouldn't support the judgment, but if the Court were to\nuphold that theory, it certainly could be charged the next\ntime the facts of Claiborne Hardware come along.\nQUESTION: One must wonder why it wasn't\ncharged.\nMR. ENGLERT: Yes.\nQUESTION: Because it was a State case it\nwasn't -- the reason -- reason it wasn't charged. It grew\nup through the Mississippi court system, if I remember\ncorrectly, didn't it?\nMR. ENGLERT: Well, my -- that's correct, of\ncourse, Justice Stevens. But my fundamental point is not\nthat one case was or wasn't charged as -- as extortion.\nIt's if you uphold the theory of the red and gray briefs,\nit can be charged as extortion in the future. And that's\nactually happened to People for the Ethical Treatment of\nAnimals.\nBecause of these implications, the Southern Christian\nLeadership Conference joined the amicus brief of the\nSeamless Garment Network at the cert stage. Disability\nrights groups that conduct protests have joined the\nSeamless Garment Network brief at the merits stage.\nActivists of all stripes and their admirers -- Daniel and\nPhilip Berrigan, Nat Hentoff, Martin Sheen --\nQUESTION: But are we talking about actions that\nconstitute the commission of some kind of criminal offense\nin the process?\nMR. ENGLERT: Oh, yes.\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. ENGLERT: Oh, yes. Trespass.\nQUESTION: Yes, and other things, destruction of\nproperty and so forth, I suppose.\nMR. ENGLERT: Oh, yes, Justice O'Connor.\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. ENGLERT: There's never been any doubt in\nthis case --\nQUESTION: I mean, we're not talking about\nconduct that is lawful here.\nMR. ENGLERT: We are not talking about\nextortion, but we are talking about some things that could\nbe punished much less severely.\nIt has never been disputed in this case, from\nthe opening statement through the closing statement of the\ntrial or in the earlier phases of the case, that there\nwere trespasses. There could be in particular\ncircumstances --\nQUESTION: -- more than that. In some cases,\nassaults and so forth.\nMR. ENGLERT: Well, fair enough except the --\nthe jury verdict really is quite at rejection of\npetitioners' proof in many respects rather than supporting\nit. But, yes, Justice O'Connor. I really don't want to\nfight with you on that particular point.\nBut -- but let's --\nQUESTION: -- I think to paint the picture that\nwe're talking about, just pure speech is -- is not the\ncase.\nMR. ENGLERT: No, but that's why I used the\nexamples of Carry Nation and Claiborne Hardware which\nweren't pure speech either. There was certainly violence\nin those cases, but not extortion.\nQUESTION: Would you say coercion? One of the\nquestions was, well, coercion -- if that's defined as\nusing compulsion to force a person to do or not do\nsomething that she otherwise would do or not do, does this\nconduct fit that crime?\nMR. ENGLERT: Yes.\nQUESTION: That crime --\nMR. ENGLERT: And that's a very important point\nsupporting our position because Congress at one point had\ncoercion as a predicate act in the Anti-Racketeering Act\nof 1934 and, at the request of organized labor, took it\nout. In the Hobbs Act, in the passage of the Hobbs Act in\n1946, again, organized labor lobbied to make sure that\ncoercion was not part of the Hobbs Act. Coercion is a\ndifferent crime from extortion, and interfering with\nsomeone's rights is the crime of coercion under the Model\nPenal Code, under New York law, under various other bodies\nof law, but it's not the crime of extortion.\nQUESTION: Just -- just on the obtain point,\nwhich I -- I agree with you is of great relevance here,\nif -- if a group trespasses on property and -- and remains\nthere for a period of days, can it be said that they're\nobtaining the use of the property, or is -- is that too\nmuch of a stretch?\nMR. ENGLERT: I think it's a stretch, Justice\nKennedy, but even if it weren't a stretch, it still\nwouldn't be a Hobbs Act violation for a different reason.\nThere must be consent to the obtaining of property or --\nof another, and simply going in and engaging in adverse\npossession doesn't necessarily entail consent.\nQUESTION:\nto avoid confrontation. I suppose if A robs B, and B\nturns over the wallet, in a sense there's consent, not --\nnot the kind of consent that the law would ever recognize.\nIt's a consent in a -- just from the standpoint that\nthere's a voluntary act in handing over the -- the wallet.\nMR. ENGLERT: Well, that actually --\nQUESTION: You make your -- you make your\nmuscles move and that's about it.\nMR. ENGLERT: Yes. Words can be stretched to\nmake lots of things into lots of things that the law\ndoesn't want them to be. And in fact, the common law\ndistinction between robbery and extortion, which are both\nHobbs Act predicates, is one is with consent and the other\nis without. So robbery is a classic example of something\nthat you could stretch the word of consent to cover, but\nit isn't extortion.\nQUESTION: I guess it's obtaining property if a\ngroup of people through criminal means tell an owner of a\nbusiness precisely and in detail how he has to run his\nbusiness.\nMR. ENGLERT: Oh, I don't think so, Justice\nBreyer.\nQUESTION: No? In other words, if -- if, say,\nyou have a group of terrible criminals, and they say here\nis what -- we're going to kill you unless you do the\nfollowing, and then they say, today you serve X and\ntomorrow you serve Y, and you send the money over to Z,\nand you do all these different things; in other words,\nthey run the business.\nMR. ENGLERT: If it --\nQUESTION: Now, why haven't they obtained that\nbusiness?\nMR. ENGLERT: In the hypothetical example you\njust gave me, they most certainly have obtained property.\nYou said send the money over to Z.\nQUESTION: Because I said -- say -- I regretted\nputting that in the hypothetical the instant I did.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: I'm simply looking for an example of\na group of criminals who will tell a property owner, a\nbusinessman, exactly and precisely how to run his business\nin a way that he doesn't want to run it. Now, why isn't\nthat obtaining the property called the business? I mean,\nthat's what the SG I think is suggesting basically.\nMR. ENGLERT: And the SG is wrong because that's\nnot what obtaining property meant under the New York law\nin 1946. It -- it's a stretch of words. It's a modern\nconcept of property.\nQUESTION: It's like a theft of services.\nI mean, you go in and you -- there was a -- years ago a\nperson who figured out how to whistle various tones into\nthe telephone so that it would connect people without\ncharge. All right. Now, hasn't that person stolen the\nuse of the telephone?\nMR. ENGLERT: Yes.\nQUESTION: Yes. And -- and a person who tells\nthe telephone company owner, I want you to go and provide\nthe services to A, B, and C, hasn't he stolen those\nservices?\nMR. ENGLERT: Well, that's getting to be more of\na stretch, but probably yes, under United States v. --\nQUESTION: Then -- then the difference between\nthat and a person who tells the business owner to provide\nhis services to A, B, C, D, and E, whom he doesn't want\nto, that doesn't seem a difference.\nMR. ENGLERT: No. There is a major difference,\nwith respect, Justice Breyer. Saying do provide services\nto A, B, C, D, and E is quite different from saying don't\nprovide services to A, B, C --\nQUESTION: That's what I wondered, and what is\nthe difference there?\nMR. ENGLERT: The difference is that A, B, C, D,\nand E have obtained the services in one case and they\nhave -- and no one has obtained any property in the other\ncase, exactly the words of the Hobbs Act.\nQUESTION: Except that services is not property,\nand the one thing that is common in both the negative and\nthe positive examples is the obtaining of control.\nIt's -- it's -- it seems to me it's -- it's the control\nthat's important when he says serve A, B, and C. It isn't\nproperty that he has obtained. It's -- it's an action.\nIt's a service.\nMR. ENGLERT: Justice Souter --\nQUESTION: And that's true in each case.\nMR. ENGLERT: -- if I've understood you\ncorrectly, that's even more support for our position\nbecause the words of the Hobbs Act are obtaining of\nproperty from another. So if all of Justice Breyer's\nexamples --\nQUESTION: No, no --\nMR. ENGLERT: -- property --\nQUESTION: I -- I agree with you on that point,\nbut I -- I guess I'm saying that if you concede in the one\ncase, I don't see why you -- you really don't have to\nconcede in -- in the other case because the one thing that\nis common to each is control, and there is no property in\na tangible sense that is obtained in -- in the positive\nservice examples.\nMR. ENGLERT: No. With respect, what is common\nis not control. It's acquisition.\nThat's what obtaining means. The Solicitor General's own\nbrief on page 21 in footnote 11 says that's what obtaining\nmeans. And --\nQUESTION: And what does one obtain? One\nobtains, in each case, control --\nMR. ENGLERT: But control --\nQUESTION: -- i.e., direction.\nMR. ENGLERT: I apologize, Justice Souter, for\ninterrupting, but control is not property. Property is\nproperty.\nQUESTION: My point is if you are conceding that\nJustice Breyer's positive examples would fall within the\nstatute, I don't see why you don't have to concede that\nthe negative example, i.e., don't serve, doesn't also\nfall --\nMR. ENGLERT: The --\nQUESTION: -- on -- on your own theory.\nMR. ENGLERT: I don't think so, respectfully,\nJustice Souter. The distinction I draw is that in the\nwords of the statute, one involves obtaining property, and\nthe other doesn't, on the assumption that the services are\nproperty. If they aren't property, I win the case for a\ndifferent reason.\nQUESTION: What do you do with the New York case\ninvolving a work stoppage?\nor do you think it's wrong? The one the Solicitor General\ncites in his brief, the -- the old 1890 case involving\na stop -- a strike, I guess, is what you'd say. Do you\nthink that case would -- would be decided the same way\nunder your view?\nMR. ENGLERT: I -- I think so, Justice Stevens,\nbut the case is not immediately coming to mind. I'm\nsorry. I -- I do think the New York courts construed\nrather strictly the obtaining of property, and the\nSolicitor General's more expansive cases are from long\nafter 1946.\nQUESTION: It's People against Barondess,\ndecided in 1892. It was under the -- under the New York\nstatute, which I think everyone agrees was the model for\nthe Federal statute.\nMR. ENGLERT: Yes, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: It seemed to me there was no\nobtaining in the very literal sense that you used the\nterm, but there was merely acquisition of control of the\noperation in that. And I'm not quite sure how you come\nout on -- on those facts.\nMR. ENGLERT: Well, Your Honor, I'm -- I'm, as I\nstand here, blanking on those facts. I -- I believe the\nNew York courts did construe obtaining of property rather\nstrictly in that case and in every other pre-1946 case,\nbut I can't -- I apologize. I can't give you an\nintelligent discussion of that right at this moment.\nI'd like to turn to the RICO injunction issue,\nif I may. It's very straightforward. I plan to address\nit only briefly.\nFirst, this Court has held in several cases that\nsection 7 of the Sherman Act and section 4 of the Clayton\nAct, both worded almost identically to section 1964(c) of\nRICO, did not authorize private injunctive relief.\nThe dissent in Paine Lumber contended that\ncourts had inherent power to grant injunctions --\nQUESTION: The language of the acts, though, is\na little different than this, isn't it?\nMR. ENGLERT: Well, very, very slightly\ndifferent, Justice O'Connor.\nQUESTION: The analogy may not be perfect\nbecause the language differs.\nMR. ENGLERT: Very slightly, but the -- where\nthere's a world of difference and not a slight difference\nis between section 16 of the Clayton Act and section 1964\nof RICO. And in section 16 of the Clayton Act, Congress\nauthorized private injunctive relief. No language\nremotely resembling section 16 appears in section 1964 of\nRICO, but all of the language from the statutes this Court\nheld didn't authorize injunctive relief with very tiny\nvariations appears in RICO.\nBesides the obvious statutory language borrowed\nfrom the Clayton and Sherman Acts, as this Court has\nrecognized throughout its cases, the statutory evolution\nof RICO presented Congress with repeated opportunities\nexpressly to provide private parties with injunctive\nrelief under RICO. Every such proposal failed before and\nafter the final enactment of RICO.\nThe court below dismissed the reliance on\nlegislative history on the theory that this Court would\nnot ascribe any significance to legislative inaction. But\nironically the very day the Seventh Circuit decided this\ncase, this Court was hearing argument in Chickasaw\nNation v. United States, and the opinion of the Court in\nthat case reiterated the longstanding principle -- with\nwhich some members of the Court disagreed, but the\nlongstanding principle in majority opinions -- that courts\nordinarily will not assume that Congress intended to enact\nstatutory language that it has earlier discarded in favor\nof other language.\nQUESTION: Would you clarify one thing on the --\non the rejected amendment? Was it voted down or\nwithdrawn? I can't remember.\nMR. ENGLERT: It was actually passed unanimously\nby the Senate, but then the House didn't take a vote on\nit.\nQUESTION: But we don't know why they --\nMR. ENGLERT: I'm sorry. I -- Justice Stevens,\nI -- I've misspoken slightly. Excuse me. The -- the\npost-RICO effort --\nQUESTION: Well, no. I'm talking about the one\nbefore enactment. The post -- the later statute is a\nlittle less persuasive.\nMR. ENGLERT: The pre-RICO effort was withdrawn.\nThe pre-RICO effort was withdrawn by Representative\nSteiger on the ground that it would complicate matters too\nmuch to take it up at that stage of the legislation, but\nit was very important. He'd come -- come back again with\nit next year. But he recognized that the statute didn't\nhave private injunctive relief in it in his floor\nstatements.\nQUESTION: At the -- on the second round,\nwhen -- when the Senate passed and the House didn't,\nthere's no explanation in the House record, is there?\nMR. ENGLERT: Nothing that sheds tremendous\nlight on this except for Representative Steiger's --\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. ENGLERT: -- own statements.\nQUESTION: It would -- it would be -- I -- the\ntrouble I'm having is I don't have any trouble seeing the\nargument your way.\nThe -- the reason I'm -- at this point, I'm not\nconvinced is that you do have in subsection (c) the\nlanguage referring -- it says may. What is it? May\nsue -- I can't -- yes, may sue therefor. And we've got\nthe general presumption that all appropriate remedies go\nwith a cause of action. And I'm -- I'm wondering if in a\ncase in which it's uncertain what to infer, either from\nthe legislative record in -- on intent, or from the\ntextual record here, whether the presumption not to carry\nthe day in a case of doubt --\nMR. ENGLERT: It shouldn't because, as is\npointed out at pages 7 and 8 of the Operation Rescue reply\nbrief and correctly so, this Court has two lines of cases:\none when Congress doesn't specify the remedies. That's\ncases like Franklin v. Gwinnett County which was an\nimplied right of action case, and like Califano v.\nYamasaki.\nAnd a different line of cases saying, when\nCongress does specify remedies, they're intended to be\nexclusive. A line of cases that -- that --\nQUESTION: Well, it -- may I tell you the reason\nI wasn't convinced on that is that if -- if Congress\nwere -- were specifying in the text here choices among\nordinary remedies, I think that would be a very strong\nargument.\nThe reason it seems less strong here is that the\nchoices that -- or the -- the remedies that Congress has\nspecified are extraordinary remedies, e.g., right in this\nsection. What is specified is treble damages, not\ndamages. If they had simply said can get damages, I think\nit would be a slam-dunk, but -- but what they did was --\nwas to specify something out of the ordinary, and I'm not\nsure that that carries the implication that ordinary\nremedies, consistent with what it specifies, are -- are\nmeant to be excluded.\nMR. ENGLERT: Well, Justice Souter, this Court\nsaid over and over again that it did carry that\nimplication when the exact same language was used in the\nSherman and Clayton Acts. The Paine Lumber case, the\nD.R. Wilder Manufacturing case, a whole host of antitrust\ncases.\nQUESTION: And I just don't remember this.\nDoes -- does the -- does Clayton use the phrase, sue\ntherefor?\nMR. ENGLERT: Oh, yes.\nQUESTION: I have to go back and look. Is that\nthe term of art that's in there?\nMR. ENGLERT: Oh, yes. Oh, yes. The -- the\nlanguage of Sherman and Clayton is in the appendix to the\nScheidler blue brief --\nQUESTION: Yes. I just -- I just didn't go back\nand look. That is the phrase?\nMR. ENGLERT: It is. It is. The terms that\ndiffer are quite trivial, and some sections are separated\ninto different subsections. That's about all the\ndifference there is.\nI'd like to reserve the balance of my time for\nrebuttal.\nQUESTION: Mr. Solicitor General.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,\nAS AMICUS CURIAE\nMR. OLSON: Justice Stevens, and may it please\nthe Court:\nThe right to control a business, whether or not\nfor profit, is a well-recognized and longstanding interest\nin property. When that control is surrendered in response\nto unlawful force, whether motivated by economics,\npolitics, or ideals, the extortionist has attained his\nobjective, and the Hobbs Act has been violated.\nQUESTION: Well, under that definition, I\nsuppose that anytime protesters trespass on property,\nthey've obtained the use of that property and there's a\nHobbs Act violation --\nMR. OLSON: If --\nQUESTION: -- Hobbs Act predicate violation?\nMR. OLSON: If there's an unlawful use of force\nor threats or violence, Justice Kennedy, whether it be in\nthe form of trespassing -- and the aim -- which this Court\nrecognized 8 years ago in this -- in this very predecessor\ncase was to shut down the clinics. If that aim is\nachieved, the control of the property has been transferred\nfrom the owner of those clinics to the extortionist.\nQUESTION: Well, if -- if that's -- if that's a\nstrained reading of obtained, shouldn't we be -- take\ncounsel of -- that there's a -- serious First Amendment\nconsequences -- consequence if we adopt that extensive\ndefinition?\nMR. OLSON: As Justice Souter said in -- in the\ndissent, which you joined, in the earlier case, the First\nAmendment is not an issue in this case, and it can be\ndealt with in particular circumstances in particular cases\nwhere it arises. The issue here is if the use of force --\nQUESTION: Well, the -- there's always a First\nAmendment implication in a protest case. There's -- at\nthis point there is a First Amendment issue in the case\nbecause of the broad definition you're proposing, it seems\nto me.\nMR. OLSON:\npresented that was not accepted by this Court. Question\n3, I think it was, or 4 in the -- the one Scheidler\npetition was not accepted by this Court.\nQUESTION: Well, but the point -- the point\nis -- the point is not whether there's a First Amendment\nviolation here. The point is whether the interpretation\nof the word obtain that the Government is -- is suggesting\nwe adopt does not threaten to -- to bring us constantly\ninto difficult situations where we're going to have to try\nto sort out whether that definition doesn't sail too close\nto the wind with respect to First Amendment rights.\nMR. OLSON: I submit, Justice Scalia, that that\nis not going to be the -- the problem that this Court or\nany courts are going to have to face.\nFirst of all, the definition of property as\ncontrolling a business has been accepted for a long time.\nNow, the only question that is --\nQUESTION: You -- you -- do you agree that your\ninterpretation would have been applicable to the civil\nrights sit-ins?\nMR. OLSON: Under some circumstances, it could\nhave if illegal force or threats were used to prevent a\nbusiness from operating.\nQUESTION: Do you --\nMR. OLSON: In many --\nQUESTION: Do you agree that it would be\napplicable to many labor picketing situations --\nMR. OLSON: Well, they --\nQUESTION: -- where they obstruct entrance?\nMR. OLSON: This -- this Court specifically\ncarved out an exemption in -- in the Enmons case with\nrespect to legitimate labor objectives --\nQUESTION: No, but --\nMR. OLSON: -- and made it --\nQUESTION: The exception wasn't with regard to\nlabor objection. What -- what is there in the statute\nthat -- that enables you to make an exception for labor\npicketing?\nMR. OLSON: What -- what this Court --\nQUESTION: What language of the statute enables\nyou to separate labor?\nMR. OLSON: Well, I -- I can't pull a specific\npiece of the language out of the statute, but this Court\nsaid nearly 20 times in the Enmons case that the Hobbs Act\nwas not intended to cover achievement of legitimate\ncollective bargaining demands, and because the Court did\nnot want to --\nQUESTION: It said any legitimate demands --\nMR. OLSON: No, it --\nQUESTION: -- elsewhere.\nit to just legitimate collective bargaining demands, did\nit?\nMR. OLSON: I -- I take that the Court, because\nit said over 15, nearly 20 times legitimate collective\nbargaining demands, legitimate union objectives --\nQUESTION: Because that's what was involved in\nthe case. But why would you separate legitimate\ncollective bargaining demands from other legitimate\ndemands? What is there possibly in the word obtain that\ncould cause you to separate legitimate collective\nbargaining demands from legitimate demands that you --\nthat you refrain from doing something else?\nMR. OLSON: I -- I can only submit, Justice\nScalia, that it seemed to me a clear implication of the\nwords used by the Court and the fact that the Court\nemphasized that it was -- that we were dealing with -- the\nCourt was dealing with the extraordinary -- the potential\nextraordinary change in Federal labor law, that that\nphrase was emphasized over and over again. Neither this\nCourt --\nQUESTION: So -- so you say we simply made a\nlabor law exception to the extortion statute.\nMR. OLSON: In the -- in the context of the\nhistory --\nQUESTION:\nlaw exception.\nMR. OLSON: No, not out of nowhere, Justice\nScalia. There was a long history of --\nQUESTION: You give me no language in the\nstatute that would justify it.\nMR. OLSON: What -- what the statute -- what the\nlanguage of the statute does -- and here's -- here's\nwhere -- what I would emphasize. The language of the\nstatute specifically makes it unlawful and makes no\nexception for -- for whether the -- whether the -- the\npetitioner -- the -- the protester, or the -- or the\nalleged extortionist is motivated by ideals or politics or\nwanting to shut down a business or a -- or a boycott of\nIsrael or -- this is a classic use of force and extortion\nin the organized crime setting. The use of force or\nthreats to take over a labor union or a business --\nQUESTION: But it says there, to obtain control.\nTo obtain control.\nMR. OLSON: Yes.\nQUESTION: Fine. What I don't understand is\nwhether there isn't a line somewhere between obtaining\ncontrol in the sense of taking over a business for a\nperiod of time, shutting down a business, and just telling\nthe owner of the business to do one single thing once that\nthe blackmailer -- but not the owner -- wants to do.\nMR. OLSON: Let me --\nQUESTION: There's a spectrum that falls within\nthat word control or the word taking over that if you push\nit to an extreme, the Hobbs Act becomes a coercion statute\nin respect to a business owner.\nMR. OLSON: It -- the question, it seems to me,\nwas answered in part by this Court in the earlier NOW case\nby saying that the extortionist doesn't have to gain a\nfinancial benefit or take possession.\nNow, the -- the robbery and larceny statutes at\ncommon law required the taking and acquiring of\npossession.\nQUESTION: I take where you're going is that it\nis a coercion statute in respect to a businessperson\ninsofar as you ask the owner of the business to do\nsomething that he doesn't want to do.\nMR. OLSON: That's -- that's part of it, yes.\nAnd the answer to the question about obtaining --\nQUESTION: If I think that's too extreme, is\nthere any stopping place?\nMR. OLSON: Well, there -- there is a stopping\npoint, is whether at the end of the day, through the\nthreats or the -- the actions of the extortionist, that\nproperty interest that was held by the victim of the\nextortion has been transferred to the hands of the\nextortionist in the sense that the aim has been\naccomplished. The aim was to shut down the clinics. That\nwas the attempt, and to the extent that that was or was\nattempted to be accomplished, that control --\nQUESTION: General Olson --\nQUESTION: Mr. -- yes, Mr. Olson. If -- if we\nagreed with your view -- and I'm not sure we will -- about\nproperty including the right to control business assets,\nit does not, I assume, cover some personal right of\nsomebody to obtain services in the clinic. And I guess\nthe jury verdict covered both. Could the jury verdict be\nupheld here even if the Court agreed with your view?\nMR. OLSON: We -- we have not addressed that,\nJustice O'Connor. I do --\nQUESTION: Well, I'm asking you to.\nMR. OLSON: I do -- I do agree. I think that it\nwould have to be sent back to the Seventh Circuit for a\nremand to examine that question. The jury instruction did\nhave the component to which you refer which we would\ncharacterize as a liberty interest of a right of an\nindividual. And that was --\nQUESTION: And we have no idea what the jury\nwent on. There were three pieces, and one involved the\npeople who worked in the clinic. One involved the women\nwho were served by the clinic, and the third involved the\nclinic operation.\nAnd that was exactly the question that I wanted\nto ask you. Is your bottom line a new trial? Because the\ncharge doesn't match the theory you're putting forward.\nMR. OLSON: I think that -- I think that at the\nend of the day, although we haven't briefed it and the\nGovernment is interested in the definition of extortion,\nat the end of the day that might have to be the result\nbecause the general -- generalized verdict does not make a\ndistinction between that which we contend is property\nright which was obtained by the extortionist or -- or was\nattempted to be obtained --\nQUESTION: Well, you wouldn't want us to send it\nback without resolving the extortion issue, would you?\nMR. OLSON: That's -- no, I --\nQUESTION: You want us to send it back so it\nis -- it is -- the jury is given a charge only on the\nextortion theory that you're -- that you're delivering.\nThen it comes back up and then we will resolve the issue.\nMR. OLSON: Well, I -- the question presented,\nin connection with the Hobbs Act, I think is answered this\nway. Where unlawful -- which this Court should\narticulate, we hope, in its opinion. Where unlawful force\nis used to arrest sufficient control of a business to stop\nthe performance of its services, the Hobbs Act has been\nviolated because control of the business, a property right\nhas been acquired.\nI -- I may have 1 minute left to just mention\none thing with respect to the -- the RICO provision.\nCongress created a private right to damages for\nRICO violations by intentionally copying language from the\nantitrust laws that this Court had repeatedly held did not\nconfer a right to seek injunctive relief. This Court has\nsaid that Congress was aware of the antitrust history, was\ncopying it, intended to copy it, and was presumed to know\nthe consequences of what Congress was doing.\nQUESTION: Of course, at the time the statute\nwas enacted, a private litigant could get relief,\ninjunctive relief, under the antitrust laws, not under\nthe -- not under the section 7 of the Sherman Act, or\nsection 4 of the Clayton Act, but under whatever the other\nnumber is.\nMR. OLSON: Section 16.\nQUESTION: But the question is really whether\nthe first section of the RICO gives us authority.\nMR. OLSON: Well, may I answer that, Justice\nStevens?\nQUESTION: Sure.\nMR. OLSON: It seems to me that in the context\nof the language that the -- that Congress knew would not\ncreate a right, and knowing -- Congress knowing that\nsection 16 did specifically create such a right, and\nknowing that this Court had said that when a right is\ncreated and remedies specifically provided, the Court --\nthe Court will not expand. The Court will accept what\nCongress has done. And Congress did not adopt and in fact\nrejected the opportunities or -- or failed to accept the\nopportunities to adopt precisely the remedy that would\nhave had that result.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Olson.\nMs. Clayton.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF FAY CLAYTON\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMS. CLAYTON: Justice Stevens, and -- and may it\nplease the Court:\nI'd like to begin with the RICO issue, if I may,\nand then turn to the Hobbs Act questions.\nThe stark contrasts between the antitrust law\nand RICO prove the -- prove why private injunctions are\navailable. When it comes to damages, we agree that the\nlanguage is virtually the same, treble damages and so\nforth. But when you look at the injunction provisions,\nthey are radically different.\nIn the antitrust law, Sherman IV, all the\ninjunction provisions were put in a single paragraph\ngiving the Government the exclusive duty to enforce. That\nis not -- that was not copied in RICO. In RICO, Congress\ntook out permanent injunctions, put them in section\n1964(a), a separate, unrestricted section. Not only did\nit give the duty to the Government, it didn't even mention\nthe Government.\nQUESTION: But in the next section, it did\nmention the Government and said that the Government shall\nhave the authority to -- to use the injunctive provisions\nmentioned in the first section. Right?\nMS. CLAYTON: No, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: And then in the third section, it\ngives private individuals a right to damages, but does not\nmention that they have the right to use the first -- first\nsection.\nMS. CLAYTON: Justice Scalia, of course, you are\ncorrect about section (c). Section (c) does give standing\nto private parties, and gives them these extraordinary new\nremedies, treble damages and legal fees, which they could\nnever get without a statutory grant.\nBut section (b) does not give the Government the\nright to use permanent injunctions. It only talks about\npreliminary relief. It takes that one section of\nSherman IV out, and the other part, the permanent\ninjunctions in Sherman IV, are now, under RICO, put in a\nwholly different provision, the unrestricted section (a).\nThe natural reading of section (a), which says\nall these permanent remedies, including the injunction\nthat our trial court granted here, went against future\ncriminal activity. Section (a) in an -- unrestricted\nlanguage makes that available to the court to restrain\nviolations of section 1962, the very violations that\nsection (c) --\nQUESTION: Section (a) says what the court may\ngrant. It doesn't say who has authority to ask the court\nto do that. And in the -- the provision (b), it empowers\nthe Government and the Government only to ask for\npreliminary injunctive relief. It's a strange thing. Why\nwould Congress withhold the power to seek a preliminary\ninjunction and yet give that party the right to seek a\npermanent injunction?\nMS. CLAYTON: That's a question that we have\npondered for a long time, and -- and I think the Motorola\nbrief, which explains -- a very important brief -- why\npreliminary injunctions should be available to everybody,\nmakes a good argument for that. But we don't have to\naddress that question here.\nMy own thinking is that section (b) gives the\nGovernment something that it wouldn't have had without the\nstatutory grant because preliminary injunctions require\none -- one element that permanent ones don't, the\nirreparable harm to the victim. And the Government, suing\nas sovereign, doesn't have property that's harmed. And if\nyou look at the Wollersheim case, they recognize that was\na plausible reason for why section (b) is there.\nQUESTION: But you're just addressing the second\nsentence of section (b). There is a first sentence which\nsays, the Attorney General may institute proceedings under\nthis section.\nMS. CLAYTON: That's right.\nQUESTION: Now --\nMS. CLAYTON: That's right.\nQUESTION: -- that -- that gives the Attorney\nGeneral the power to institute proceedings under (a).\nMS. CLAYTON: Your Honor, it doesn't -- excuse\nme, Justice Scalia. Section (b) does not say the Attorney\nGeneral may institute proceedings under section 1964(a).\nIt says under this section which is section --\nQUESTION: What else could it mean?\nQUESTION: What else could it mean?\nMS. CLAYTON: It means section 1964 as a whole,\nYour Honor, and in section (c) private parties are given\nthe right to sue, which is another way of saying the very\nsame thing. In fact --\nQUESTION: As I -- sorry.\nMS. CLAYTON: I was going to say in the American\nStores case, this Court construed the very same language\nin the Clayton Act, sections 15 and 16. Institute\nproceedings, sue for in the other. And the Court said\nboth of them mean both the Government and private parties\nmay go and get injunctive relief including divestiture.\nIt's just two ways of saying the same thing. The\nGovernment is thought to institute proceedings. It's\nbringing them as a sovereign. Private parties are suing\nfor. It's just the traditional language. Certainly those\nphrases don't bear the weight of the argument that\ninstitute proceedings means this party and only this party\nhas access to those unrestricted remedies of section\n1964(a).\nQUESTION: And I looked -- I mean, I couldn't\nmake too much out of the fact that you take the language\nfrom the Clayton Act which says the Attorney General may\ninstitute proceedings in equity, and you move it to\nsection (b) and just change it to say, he may institute\nproceedings under this section. That's the only\ndifference with the Clayton Act that I could find.\nSo I looked up the history. In the history, it\nlooks as if there were five different bills floating\naround, and things didn't -- weren't all that\nstraightforward. It got a little mixed up. And you have\nin the House several Congressmen getting up and saying\nthey made a mistake in the Senate. They didn't include\nthis. They should have. And then there were four more\nbills floating around, and the ones who wanted to include\nit said, send it all to the Judiciary Committee, let them\nwork it out, and they never worked it out. I mean,\nthat's -- that's the thrust of it that I -- that I got out\nof that.\nMaybe it was just a mistake. Well, if it was a\nmistake, you're the -- you have another law. You can\nbring it under the -- you could get an injunction I guess\nunder the Abortion Act, the Abortion Clinics Act, or -- it\nseemed to me this one -- they made a mistake. Well, they\nmade it.\nMS. CLAYTON: Well, Justice Breyer, even if\nsomeone made a mistake, the bill, as it stands, is what\nCongress voted on, and what the President signed. It is\nthat bill that we interpret. And we all agree -- this\nCourt has said on many occasions that --\nQUESTION: I'm with you on that.\nMS. CLAYTON: I know you are, Justice Scalia.\n(Laughter.)\nMS. CLAYTON: Perhaps the only thing. And\nyou've often commented on how there are probably as many\nreasons for congressional action or inaction as there are\nMembers of Congress.\nBut the fact is the bill makes a very -- it's a\nvery radically different structure from the antitrust law.\nPrivate -- I mean, permanent injunctions are unrestricted,\nand under the traditional jurisprudence, Califano -- when\nwe -- we assume all traditional remedies are available\nunless -- unless there's the clearest command. There's\nnot even a hint here. Maybe it was a mistake. It was\ncertainly not a clear command to do the opposite.\nAnd as my -- petitioners have pointed out, the\nonly time private injunctions were voted on, they passed\nunanimously. Why didn't they put it in there? I think it\nwould have been redundant, and the Court doesn't like\nsurplusage. If they had said in section (c), and private\nparties can get permanent injunctions, then the courts\nwould have been trying to figure out, well, what did they\nmean in section (a). That has to mean something\ndifferent.\nThey didn't say again the Government could get\npermanent injunctions in section (b). That would have\nbeen redundant too. But everybody agrees the Government\ncan get permanent injunctions.\nIn any event, this Court's jurisprudence teaches\nus --\nQUESTION:\nQUESTION: We don't agree on whether they get it\npursuant to section (a) or section (b), though.\nMS. CLAYTON: The Scheidler brief, the opening\nbrief, says that section (b) gives the Government\nunrestricted access to the remedies in section (a).\nThat's the way they've put it. I don't read -- if -- if\nthat's the case for the Government, the same applies to\nprivate parties. By parity of reasoning, anyone with\nstanding -- and it's strict standing for private parties.\nYou've got to be injured in your business or property.\nQUESTION: But -- so you say private parties\nhave the power to require -- to ask the court to order a\nperson to divest himself of any interest, direct or\nindirect? Do you know of any other situation in which a\nprivate party can -- can cause the -- the divestiture of a\nbusiness?\nMS. CLAYTON: Justice Scalia, it's not\nautomatic. The court in its discretion might do it or\nmight not, but it must --\nQUESTION: I understand that, but to put that\npower and -- and to request it in the hands of a power --\nof a private party seems to me extraordinary.\nMS. CLAYTON: It's been in the hands of private\nparties under the antitrust law for more than a half\ncentury before RICO was passed, and the courts have had no\nproblem exercising their discretion to my knowledge.\nIn fact, in the American Stores case, this Court\npointed out how the very same remedy sought by the\nGovernment and sought by private parties, the Government\nmight get it, and the private party might not.\nFurthermore, any -- any injunctive relief --\nQUESTION: You can understand it in the context\nof the antitrust laws where the divestiture is the only\nway to prevent the -- the monopolization, but to use that\nas a punishment for -- for extortion is, it seems to me,\nquite -- quite bizarre.\nMS. CLAYTON: And then I think the court\nwouldn't grant it to the private party, and they certainly\nwouldn't grant it unless it was designed to remedy the\nparticular injury that the private party suffered to their\nbusiness and property by virtue of a 1962 violation. It\nwould be very strange, indeed, Your Honor, to remove from\nprivate parties who are deputized to be a -- private\nattorneys general, supplement the Government resources, to\ntake away this powerful core injunctive remedy and instead\nmake them sue for treble --\nQUESTION: But the divestiture -- you say the\ndivestiture should never be -- should never be used by the\ncourts.\nMS. CLAYTON: No, I don't, Your Honor. I think\nthat the district courts are --\nQUESTION: It could -- could simply destroy an\norganization as the punishment for -- for extortion as\nyou --\nMS. CLAYTON: The court would only do that in an\nextreme case, I am sure. Maybe they would never give it\nto a private party, but it would be up to the -- but the\nprivate party may seek it. Section (a) doesn't say they\nautomatically get it.\nQUESTION: Then it's even odder that they\ndon't -- the private party can't seek that preliminary\ninjunction even if they can show irreparable injury. To\ngive the extraordinary power of ordering divestiture and\nnot giving a party who is irreparably injured the\nauthority to go into court and say, stop now --\ntemporarily --\nMS. CLAYTON: I -- I agree, Your Honor, and even\nthough that's not an issue that the Court has to resolve\nin this case, I think the Motorola brief makes an\nexcellent case for why -- since this is a very special\nremedy, it's not an exclusive list. Congress didn't mean\nto deprive private parties or anyone else of any of the\ntraditional remedies. The Califano rule is clear. Unless\nthere's a clear command to deny it, it's available. I\ndon't think section (b) -- remember, it doesn't even have\nthat duty language.\nOne other point I'd like to make is when the\nantitrust laws were written, there was no merger of law in\nequity. To go in -- when someone had a right to get\ndamages, they had to go into the law court which could\nonly give money damages. It couldn't give injunctions.\nThat had changed by the time RICO passed. And Congress\nknew that. Congress knew the Federal courts had the\nability to design any appropriate remedy to fix the wrong,\nbarring the clearest command. There's no clearest\ncommand.\nQUESTION: Well, you do agree, though, I guess\nthat were efforts to include language authorizing the\nobtaining of injunctions by private petitioners, and that\nwas not adopted by Congress.\nMS. CLAYTON: But they were passed unanimously.\nThey didn't get in I believe because it would have been\nsurplusage. It would have been redundant, and we don't\nlike that in statutes.\nQUESTION: Well, we don't know.\nMS. CLAYTON: We don't know, Your Honor, and we\ncan -- and as the Court has said in Central Bank and Solid\nWaste, one never -- it's a thin reed to rest an\ninterpretation on what Congress might have had --\nQUESTION:\nof the battle, and everybody says, without any opposition,\nthat this isn't there. You would have thought if it was\nsurplusage, somebody would have gotten up and said, well,\nit is.\nMS. CLAYTON: Well, I think that's what\nRepresentative Steiger said. The -- in fact, we quoted\nhim. It's ambiguous.\nQUESTION: I don't know.\nMS. CLAYTON: But it's certainly not the clear\ncommand to the contrary.\nQUESTION: Well, you have two -- two difficult\nand major arguments here.\nMS. CLAYTON: I'd like to turn to it. Thank\nyou, Justice Kennedy.\nQUESTION: I -- I would like to hear your\ncomments on obtaining property.\nMS. CLAYTON: I would like to turn to those.\nI think we all agree that property includes both\ntangible things and intangible things. Of course, in this\ninformation age, some of our most important property is\nintangible. So the question, of course, is how does one\nobtain it. One obtains it by obtaining control over it or\ndominion over it, as this Court explained in the Carpenter\nand Green case.\nRemember in Carpenter -- now, this is a mail\nfraud case that had the same phrase, obtain property.\nMr. Winans, the Wall Street Journal reporter, the On the\nStreet column, was held to have wrongfully obtained\nproperty. Now, he had already received the information.\nQUESTION: Do you think that it includes liberty\ninterest deprivation?\nMS. CLAYTON: No. No, Your Honor, I don't. We\ndo not believe -- but sometimes they --\nQUESTION: Then what happens to a generalized\nverdict no matter how you define this --\nMS. CLAYTON: Your Honor, the verdict here is\nbased only on property. If you look at the Hobbs Act\ninstruction, it required that the respondents be made to\npart with property, not part with liberty interests. If a\nnewspaper publishes an editorial, it has a liberty\ninterest, a First Amendment right, to do it, but it also\nhas a property right.\nQUESTION: Yes, but it defined property. It\nsays you can find a violation, other things -- all the\nother -- all the other requirements being met. You have\nto say that the doctors, nurses, or other staff or clinics\nthemselves give up a property right. The term property\nright means anything of value --\nMS. CLAYTON: Right.\nQUESTION:\nservices from the clinic, the right of doctors or nurses\nto perform their jobs, the right of the clinic to provide\nmedical services free from wrongful threats.\nMS. CLAYTON: Right.\nQUESTION: Now, your brief I think, more or\nless, seemed to concede that -- that at least two out of\nthose three parts were certainly wrong.\nMS. CLAYTON: Oh, no.\nQUESTION: You don't. I mean, then -- then do\nwe have to decide -- is this -- is --\nMS. CLAYTON: No, no. No, Your Honor. What we\nbelieve is that to find property in any one of those\naspects of property -- there are three aspects of\nproperty: the clinic's right to control its equipment and\nbuildings and so forth, the women's right to spend their\nmoney, and the contract among -- between the two parties.\nExtortion of any one of them proximately injures all of\nthem because it's two sides of the same coin. If the\nclinic is forcibly -- through threats of violence, the\nclinic is forcibly closed, now the women who have\nappointments, which are contracts, bilateral contracts,\nthey can't get in. It's a -- it's two sides of the same\ncoin. So to extort the property of the clinic is to\nproximately injure the women in her business or property,\nwhich is -- the standing comes under RICO. This is\nsomething that petitioners have never even challenged at\nthe trial court --\nQUESTION: All right. So -- so in other words,\nthis instruction is correct that it's -- it's --\nMS. CLAYTON: It is, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: So a -- a woman's right to seek\nservices is property which, if they say, I don't want you,\nthe clinic, to serve the woman so the woman can't get the\nservices, that is obtaining property?\nMS. CLAYTON: It is under these circumstances\nwhere she has an actual agreement with the -- the clinic.\nShe's not just going shopping. Each woman who went to\nthese clinics had an actual appointment for a particular\nservice at a particular time. When I have an appointment\nwith my doctor for a biopsy, I have a property right in\nseeing my doctor at that time.\nQUESTION: What have you obtained control of?\nWhat have you obtained control of?\nMS. CLAYTON: Just as in the Carpenter case,\nyou've obtained control of the right to do business and\nthe intangible rights that come out of business, the\nexclusive rights.\nQUESTION: Obtaining control means -- means\nnothing at all if -- if whenever you deprive somebody\nof -- of a right, you say you obtain control of the right\nthat -- that you've deprived them of. I mean, everything\nbecomes an obtaining of property.\nMS. CLAYTON: When one uses a demand to make one\ncede their control over property -- this is my pen. This\nis my property. It has ink and plastic. But I also have\na right to use it for writing. And if someone puts a gun\nto my head and says, if you use that pen, I'll shoot you,\nthey have taken my property. They've taken my control.\nQUESTION: If I -- if I say to you, don't --\ndon't use that pen, or I'll do something unlawful and you\ndon't use the pen, I have obtained the pen.\nMS. CLAYTON: You have obtained control.\nQUESTION: In -- in ordinary parlance, I have\nobtained the pen.\nMS. CLAYTON: Your Honor, in the Florida Prepaid\ncase, in the Craft case, in the Drye case, this Court made\ncrystal clear the essence of intangible -- and, for that\nmatter, tangible property is the rights that come out of\nit, especially the right of control. The right to control\nmy pen, the right of the clinics to control their --\nQUESTION: Or what about the right to perform a\njob? Let's think of a labor strike.\nMS. CLAYTON: Absolutely.\nQUESTION: And -- and think of the strike, my\ngoodness, where people can't get into the factory. And --\nand somebody comes out and says, you've -- you've\ninterfered under the Hobbs Act and have obtained property;\nnamely, my right to perform my job is interfered with.\nThe person at the soda fountain -- you've heard\nthe litany.\nMS. CLAYTON: Right.\nQUESTION: There are the soda fountain -- the\nsit-ins. The soda jerk who wouldn't serve the black\ncustomers. Well, this -- this is interfering with my\nright to perform my job.\nI mean, this seems -- you have another statute\nthat you can sue under. But a lot of -- a lot of people\nwho don't like these various demonstrations don't, and\nthey'll all be in under the Hobbs Act and -- and RICO and\nso forth. I'm rather concerned about this problem. I'd\nlike you to address it.\nMS. CLAYTON: I'd like to address those,\nJustice Breyer. Let's start with the soda joke -- jerk\nexample.\nMartin Luther King didn't tell his followers to\ngo into the Woolworth's and bash the people around and\nforcibly prevent the white people from getting service.\nQUESTION: No, but just obstructing -- just\nobstructing -- you've used the term violence several\ntimes.\nMS. CLAYTON: It --\nQUESTION: As -- as your argument to the jury\nitself indicated, it was enough if they obstructed the\nentrance and failed to part like the Red Sea --\nMS. CLAYTON: Not true.\nQUESTION: -- if somebody wanted to go in.\nMS. CLAYTON: Justice Scalia, that is not\ncorrect. We -- the instruction required that the\nrespondents be made to give up property. We -- and -- and\nquestion 12 ensured that a mere blockade or sit-in --\nquestion 6 on the jury form asked the jury if any of the\npredicate acts they found was based on a mere blockade and\nsit-in. The jury said no. I told the jury don't include\nin your predicate acts -- I told them -- anything that was\nbased on mere speech, or mere presence, or the message.\nIt had to be something that involved force or violence,\nthe wrongful use of fear --\nQUESTION: I -- I am reading the closing\nargument on behalf of the clinic plaintiffs at the trial,\nand it says, in every issue we've shown you the property\nrights of the clinics and the women were extorted under\nRICO. Even a few hours of deprivation of legal rights\nwill satisfy the RICO act of extortion.\nThere is one way, I guess, in which you don't\nhave the element of force in a blockade, and that would be\nif the blockaders did something that they were\nspecifically instructed that they should never do, that\nis, politely move aside, part like the Red Sea, and let a\nwoman through.\nBut you know that never happened. No witness\never testified to that. No witness -- not defense, not\nplaintiff -- ever said that any of the blockaders were\ninstructed to let women through.\nIn other words, you told the jury that you could\nfind an offense here under the Hobbs Act by the mere\nblockade. It wasn't smacking people around. It was just\nnot letting people in.\nMS. CLAYTON: No, Your Honor. If the jury had\nfound a mere -- first of all, that was argument. The jury\nfollows instructions not argument, as the Weeks case from\nthis Court has held. But the evidence supported --\nQUESTION: So you're -- you're changing your\nposition here.\nMS. CLAYTON: No, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: I see.\nMS. CLAYTON: When we made -- we made that\nargument, but we also told the jury that if they were\nbasing any predicate acts on the mere presence and a mere\nblockade, mere sit-in, they had to put yes to question 6.\nThey put no because we showed them that they had to find\nthat any predicate act needed an element of force or\nviolence. And that's what PLAN did. It used these --\nQUESTION: Well -- well, but still -- still it\nseems to me that your -- your theory doesn't depend on\nviolence. Your theory is that you're obtaining -- or that\nthe defendants here were obtaining property because they\nprohibited its use. That's your theory.\nMS. CLAYTON: Yes, Your Honor, by -- by wrongful\nmeans. That's correct.\nQUESTION: And -- and so -- so long as the means\nwere wrongful, the obtaining definitional problem still\nremains, and I think you should address that.\nMS. CLAYTON: I'd like -- yes, I'd like to go\nback to the Carpenter case. Mr. Winans had the\ninformation, but then he wrongfully obtained it. How did\nhe wrongfully obtain it? When he exercised dominion or\ncontrol over it. This Court said he -- he wrongfully\nobtained it when he deprived -- that was this Court's\nword -- deprived the Journal of its right to control that\nproperty.\nIn the Green case, the same way. The --\nQUESTION: How about Carry Nation? I -- you\nwould concede, I take it, based on your argument that if\nRICO had been around then and the Hobbs Act, that she\nwould have been in violation.\nMS. CLAYTON: I would, Your Honor, if she had\nbeen doing it to get consent, to get the business to\nchange its ways, which I guess she was. Yes, that's not\nthe lawful way. If my client, the National Organization\nfor Women, organized people to go to Augusta Golf Course\nand tear up the greens until they let women members, that\nwould be extortion.\nQUESTION: But it is -- it is strange to think\nof Carry Nation, that notorious extortionist. I mean, you\nknow, that's just not the crime involved. There --\nthere's a crime there, but is it extortion?\nMS. CLAYTON: Your Honor, the Hobbs Act doesn't\ngive exemptions for motives, as this Court has repeatedly\nheld. There's no more a motive requirement there than\nthere is under RICO.\nQUESTION: What's the difference between --\nQUESTION: Ms. Clayton, may I ask you one\nquestion? I just -- I -- I want to be sure I heard you\ncorrectly. There's a definition of property in the\ninstructions, a three-part definition, at page 158. Did\nyou tell us that that instruction was not objected to?\nMS. CLAYTON: Oh, no, I don't believe I said\nthat.\nQUESTION: I just misunderstood you.\nMS. CLAYTON:\na definition of -- of extortion that was part with\nproperty, and they didn't define it. So at the trial --\nat the pretrial stage, that was all they offered. They\ndidn't object then.\nDuring the course of trial, they made numerous\nobjections. I can't say they never objected. They didn't\ntimely object.\nAnd their original view of what extortion meant\nwas part with property, which is the same I think as give\nup property.\nQUESTION: What is the difference between\ncoercion and extortion?\nMS. CLAYTON: The difference is whether property\nis being attacked. When you coerce somebody to give up\ntheir First Amendment right, that might be coercion, but\nsince it's not focused on property, it's not extortion.\nQUESTION: What would you coerce them to do that\nis not the giving up of property? Give me an example.\nMS. CLAYTON: To stop speaking. You don't have\nproperty in your speech. Liberty interests are not the\nsubject of extortion, but -- but property interests are.\nEvery extortion is a coercion.\nQUESTION: Shouldn't we draw the line this way?\nInstead of speaking as, for example, the Solicitor General\ndid and some of the cases do about obtaining control,\nisn't the way to -- to adhere to the line between the\nliberty and property distinction to say that you extort if\nyou gain control in a way which prevents them from doing\nbusiness, i.e., engaging in a property exercise, but you\ndo not extort if you gain control simply in the way they\ndo business, i.e., their choice of whom to serve?\nIf we draw that distinction, then the old\nsit-ins in the lunch counter weren't there to stop them\nfrom doing business. They wanted them to do business.\nThey wanted them to do business with them. Whereas, the\ncase which I think you have is a case that could be argued\nthat the point of it was to stop the business, period, and\nthat gets into property and crosses the line from liberty\nto property. Would you accept that distinction?\nMS. CLAYTON: Not quite, Justice Souter.\nI certainly agree that the -- that the sit-in protesters\nwere not extorting anybody because they were trying to\nchange people's mind by persuasion, not by intimidation.\nBut I believe if you look at the old --\nQUESTION: Well, they wanted a -- I mean, but\nthey -- the --\nMS. CLAYTON: They --\nQUESTION: -- their immediate object was to get\nthe sandwich or the Coke. So that was easy.\nMS. CLAYTON:\nright.\nBut when we look at the old organized crime, the\nclassic organized crime extortion cases that the Hobbs Act\nwas based on, we see organized crime going in saying, let\nthese people run your pension fund. Don't do business\nwith these people. Fire these people. Hire those. Any\nattempt to control a lawful business decision I believe is\nextortion, whether it's positive or negative.\nQUESTION: Well, maybe -- maybe it is, but I --\nI think -- among other things, I think we are, and should\nbe more concerned about the First Amendment issues which\narise when you cross the line into liberty than the --\nthan the cases were 40 years ago and --\nMS. CLAYTON: But the proper -- excuse me,\nJustice Souter. The best way to address the First\nAmendment issue is to apply the standards of Claiborne\nHardware to any extortion at conduct, as was done here.\nMake sure that the petitioners had to have specific intent\nthat the crime be done. Make sure it was done knowingly,\nwillingly, wrongfully, not just accidentally. Make sure\nthe enterprise authorized or ratified it. Those were the\ninstructions given here. There was -- nothing could be a\npredicate act unless all those tests were met.\nAnd then on top of that, they had to use\ndemands, wrongful demands, to control lawful business\ndecisions. And I do believe that decisions either to do\nsomething or not to do something, as long as the business\nowner -- say the company makes round widgets and square\nwidgets. And the -- the extortionist says, we don't like\nround widgets. We want you to only make the other kind.\nOr maybe they don't make round and they want them to start\ndoing it. That's as much a control of their business\ndecisions as all those classic organized crimes that were\nthe basis of the Hobbs Act. And it's just as offensive\nhere.\nYour Honor, we ask the clock not to turn back\nthe -- ask the Court not to turn back the clock on 50\nyears of Hobbs Act jurisprudence which protected\nbusinesses and their customers in making their lawful\nbusiness decisions.\nWe ask the Court to decline to add any\nlimitations like tangible or personal to -- to the Hobbs\nAct. By the way, even if you did, the State law --\nQUESTION: You want to retain the labor union\nexception, however, I assume.\nMS. CLAYTON: And of course. Enmons -- and it's\nsection (c), Your Honor. It's section (c) of 1951 that\nsays nothing in this law will affect -- and then they list\nall the labor laws. That's why there's a union exception.\nPlus the -- the New York and all the other States had not\nonly a statutory labor exception, but common law.\nAnd please don't --\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mrs. -- Ms. Clayton.\nMS. CLAYTON: Thank you. Thank you, Your\nHonors.\nQUESTION: Mr. Englert, you have 6 minutes left.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ROY T. ENGLERT, JR.\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. ENGLERT: Thank you, Justice Stevens.\nThe defendants in this case objected strenuously\nto reading the word obtain out of the Hobbs Act. They did\nnot say that giving up property is enough. If you read\nthe 1995 opinion wrongly denying the 12(b)(6) motion,\nthat's all over the place. If you look at pages 4324 to\n4340 of the transcript at the jury colloquy, the point\nthat there needs to be obtaining was made quite\nstrenuously.\nQUESTION: Was -- was this particular\ninstruction, the one that I read from in 1998, the\ninstruction that had the three parts to it -- was that\nobjected to?\nMR. ENGLERT: Yes, at the -- at the pages I\nindicated.\nPeople v. Barondess. The work stoppage led to\nobtaining $100. Of course, it was extortion. That's the\nproperty in that case. That's -- it's cited in footnote\n16 of our opening -- of the Scheidler opening brief.\nUnited States v. Cleveland Indians Baseball\nCompany. This Court reminded us members of the bar that\nthe tendency to assume that a word used in two different\nlegal rules always has the same meaning, has all the\ntenacity of original sin, and must constantly be guarded\nagainst. To think that property's definition in tax cases\nand in Fifth Amendment takings cases is necessarily the\ndefinition of the Hobbs Act is simply wrong. The Hobbs\nAct draws its definition of property from the common law\nand the New York law, not from takings cases and tax\ncases.\nThe First Amendment is in this case. Yes, the\nCourt did not take the First Amendment question, but the\nprinciple of constitutional avoidance always governs the\nconstruction of statutes. And Ms. Clayton concedes that\nclassic protest activities that are venerated in American\nhistory in retrospect would be covered as extortion by her\ndefinition. That should give the Court pause.\nClaiborne --\nQUESTION: They wouldn't -- they wouldn't be if\nyou observed the distinction I was throwing out.\nMR. ENGLERT: The -- the answer to that\ndistinction, if I may, Justice Souter, is Claiborne\nHardware and Carry Nation -- those fact patterns certainly\nwould be covered even under the distinction you suggest.\nThere were 10 acts of violence in 1966 in Claiborne\nHardware.\nQUESTION: Yes, Carry Nation would be covered.\nThere's no question. The -- the lunch counter sit-ins\nwould not, as I understand it.\nMR. ENGLERT: Well, actually I -- I don't think\nthat's historically accurate. I think there was an effort\nto stop the lunch counters from serving other people in\naddition to getting them to -- to serve black people. But\nit doesn't matter.\nQUESTION: Well, the --\nMR. ENGLERT: It -- it -- there are -- there are\nexamples that this Court should be concerned, I\nrespectfully submit, about calling extortion under\nMs. Clayton's definition, and that would include the facts\nin Claiborne Hardware. That would include the Carry\nNation example. The Seamless Garment Network brief goes\ninto many other examples.\nQUESTION: If the conduct in Claiborne Hardware\nwas pretty rough. Maybe it should have been included.\nQUESTION: You're not going to get -- you're not\ngoing to get my --\nMR. ENGLERT:\nthe Court in that case refers to it has having elements of\nmajesty as well as elements of violence. And the Court\nreally should be concerned about whether the classic\nhistorical pattern -- and please look at the Seamless\nGarment Network brief -- the classic historical pattern of\nvenerable leaders whose followers get out of hand is\nreally what is meant by Hobbs Act extortion and RICO.\nQUESTION: No majesty with Carry Nation. I\nmean, you don't get my sympathy by saying you -- you might\nhave interfered with Carry Nation on --\nMR. ENGLERT: Well, I --\nQUESTION: He didn't say might have. You said\nthat you would.\nMR. ENGLERT: There's another more legalistic\nreason.\nQUESTION: I think both sides agree on Carry\nNation.\nMR. ENGLERT: If -- if I may, there's another\nmore legalistic reason why Ms. Clayton's and the Solicitor\nGeneral's position has to be wrong, and Justice Breyer and\nothers have laid their finger on it, Justice Ginsburg as\nwell.\nWhat they're talking about is the classic\nexample of coercion, not extortion, and for those who like\nlegislative history, the fact that organized labor got\ncoercion out of the statute should give you pause. For\nthose who don't like legislative history, the fact that\nthere's a list of predicate acts and coercion isn't one of\nthem should give you pause.\nI think almost everyone agrees that there has to\nbe at the very least a remand in this case, and\nMs. Clayton hasn't quite conceded it. But if this Court's\ndecision in Griffin v. United States, a criminal case, is\napplicable in civil cases or if this Court's decisions in\nYates v. United States, Maryland v. Baldwin, Sunkist\nGrowers are applicable, then this jury verdict, which\nalmost indisputably rests, at least in part, on\nindefensible notions of property, has to be reversed.\nQUESTION: Can I ask you one question about\nthat? Did the individuals get damages here, or was it\njust the clinics?\nMR. ENGLERT: Only the clinics for extraordinary\nsecurity costs.\nQUESTION: Okay.\nMR. ENGLERT: Violence. Let's talk about\nviolence for a moment. Please look at -- at special\ninterrogatory 4(e). The jury was asked to find how many\nacts or threats of violence to persons or property were\nthere. The jury said four. Ms. Clayton argued 30 in her\nclosing argument, and the jury said 4. So actually the\njury rejected -- we know to a certainty the jury rejected\nmost of NOW's evidence, and there weren't even any\nallegations that Mr. Scheidler, Mr. Scholberg, or\nMr. Murphy actually engaged in violence. There were\nallegations they were connected to violence, not that they\nengaged in violence. And I should say my clients are\nproponents of nonviolence. Mr. Terry was not alleged to\nengage in acts of violence either, I should add.\nRICO. Section 4 of the Sherman Act is repeated\nalmost verbatim in 1964(a) and 1964(b). Section 7 of the\nSherman Act is repeated almost verbatim in 1964(c).\nSection 4 of the Clayton Act is repeated almost verbatim\nin 1964(c). Section 15 of the Clayton Act is repeated\nalmost verbatim in 1964(a) and (b). Section 16 of the\nClayton Act, the statute that authorizes injunctions,\nnowhere in 1964.\nAnd as -- as -- thank you.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you, Mr. Englert.\n(Whereupon, at 11:07 a.m., the case in the\nabove-entitled matter was submitted.)\n"
