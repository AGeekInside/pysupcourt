        "content": "(10:07 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument\nfirst this morning in Case 11-1351, Levin v. United\nStates.\nMr. Feldman?\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES A. FELDMAN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. FELDMAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nAs the language and structure of the\nGonzalez Act demonstrate, Congress did not completely\neliminate the long-recognized tort remedy that's\navailable to essentially everybody else in the country\nwhen doctors perform surgery without a patient's\nconsent.\nBy abrogating the intentional tort exception\nto the FTCA for the class of cases covered by the\nGonzalez Act, Congress both preserved a remedy for the\nvictims of that tort, and, by virtue of the Gonzalez\nAct's exclusive remedy provision, they made certain that\nthe Federal employees themselves would not be sued.\nAs everyone understood at the time of the\nenactment, that was the meaning of the terms of the\nGonzalez Act. The Act has two clauses, an operative\nclause and an introductory clause.\nThe operative clause says, in simple\ndeclarative terms, that the intentional tort exception\nto the Federal Tort Claims Act shall not apply to any\ncause of action arising out of a wrongful act or\nomission in the performance of medical functions.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Feldman, but it says,\nfirst, \"for purposes of this section.\" And, as I -- I\nunderstand your argument, those words don't count. In\nother words, you would be making -- you would interpret\nthe statute the same way if the sentence started with\n\"the provisions of Section 2680(h).\"\nMR. FELDMAN: No, Your Honor. That's not\nright. We -- we -- that -- that -- the part after the\nintroductory clause says, \"The provisions of the\nintentional tort exception shall not apply to medical\nmalpractice cases.\" And that would make it apply across\nthe government to any government employee who is\nperforming those medical functions.\nBy saying, \"for purposes of this section,\"\nCongress limited it in accordance with the case -- the\nagency by agency approach that it had adopted in this\narea and limited it to just the cases that are covered\nby the Gonzalez Act; that is, by malpractice that's\ncommitted by doctors of the Department of Defense, the\nNational Guard, the Armed Forces Retirement Home, and so\non.\nAnd so the -- each clause serves quite an\nimportant function. Congress had before the Gonzalez\nAct -- they had already passed the statutes dealing, for\nexample, with the Public Health Service that's\nessentially written in the same terms, with the Veterans\nAdministration -- although part of that was then added\nlater -- with the State Department doctors, and so on.\nAnd so they were proceeding on an agency by\nagency basis, and the way to accomplish that was to\nfirst say, we -- we think that the intentional tort\nexception should not apply to these cases because in\nmedical batteries of the sort that we -- as alleged in\nthis case, are so close to the kinds of medical\nmalpractice cases that are going to be brought against\nthe government anyhow.\nBut then, in each statute, they say, \"for\npurposes of this section,\" because it's only the\nagencies, only the personnel covered by those sections,\nand the torts covered by those sections.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The Veterans\nAdministration, it doesn't say that, does it?\nMR. FELDMAN: The Veterans --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes.\nMR. FELDMAN: The Veterans Administration,\noriginally -- the original Veterans Administration\nstatute, which was from about 1965, doesn't have this\n1089(e) intentional tort exception at all in it.\nBut then they added it later, about 10 years\nafter this statute, and then they added a provision that\nwas slightly worded differently, but it achieves exactly\nthe same result. Instead of saying, \"for purposes of\nthis section,\" it says, \"by the personnel named in\nSection A,\" which accomplishes exactly the same thing.\nAnd, actually, if you look at the history of\nthat statute, the Senate report on that statute, quite\nclearly, recites that Congress understood that 1089(e),\nthe statute here, has exactly the effect that I said.\nAnd they said, we are modeling it on that provision.\nAnd then they did tinker with the wording, and there's\nactually no explanation for the specific change.\nBut it's not uncommon that, in statutes that\nhave been reviewed by different committees and passed 10\nor 12 years apart, that Congress would have a -- they\nwould use slightly different language to achieve,\nessentially, the same purpose.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What would -- what do you\ndo, if anything, about those of us -- I hope more than\none -- who actually look at legislative history, and the\nHouse and Senate Report -- the Senate Report says\nSubsection (e) would nullify a provision of the Tort\nClaims Act, which would otherwise exclude any action for\nassault and battery, then the House says about the same\nthing.\nSo, when I look at those two things, I think\nthe purpose of this Act was to do just exactly what the\nother side says, it was to get rid of assault and\nbattery as an exception and said the government of the\nUnited States will pay for unlawful assault and battery.\nThat's what the two reports say. That's why\nthey passed it.\nMR. FELDMAN: Right. I believe, actually,\nthat's our -- that -- that's the way we read it, exactly\nlike that, which is the -- by nullifying the intentional\ntort exception -- what the intentional tort exception\nprovides is -- actually, what it says, is, \"The\nprovisions of the Federal Tort Claims Act shall not\napply to any case arising out of assault, battery,\" and\nso on.\nAnd, by eliminating that, the -- the\nprovisions of the Federal Tort Claims Act are otherwise\ntotally applicable to cases of medical battery, like\nthis, or other kinds of intentional tort.\nAnd so, for cases, covered by the Gonzalez\nAct -- that is, cases of medical malpractice committed\nwithin the scope of employment by the doctors of the\ncertain specified agencies that Congress has named --\nfor those cases, there is no intentional tort exception,\nand, therefore, you can bring an action against the\ngovernment.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I don't quite\nunderstand your answer to Justice Ginsburg on the \"for\npurposes of this section.\"\nWhat the section does is provide that the\nremedy against the United States is exclusive. But what\nthe 1089(e) goes on to say is that the 26 -- the 2680(h)\nprovision doesn't apply. So I don't see how that -- I\nmean, the -- the reference is to the exclusivity, not to\nthe waiver of the limitation on -- on intentional torts.\nMR. FELDMAN: Well, I don't think that\nthat's right. I mean, I think, for purposes of this\nsection, you have to read it in context. And the fact\nis that 2680 -- the term \"2680(h) of Title 28\" doesn't\nappear elsewhere in the Gonzales Act.\nThe only work that that provision does in\nthe law, section -- the intentional tort exception,\n2680(h) of Title 28, the only work that that does is to\nmake the -- is in the Federal Tort Claims Act, is to\nmake the -- the Act inapplicable to those kinds of\ncases.\nSo when they say, in simple terms, that\nshall not apply, all that could mean -- all that could\npossibly mean is you eliminate that, and then you have\nthe Tort Claims Act how it is. And then what the four\npurposes of this section does is say, but we're not\ndoing that across the board for every Federal employee\neverywhere or even every malpractice case. We are just\ndoing it for the claims that are covered -- for the\ncases that are covered in this section -- for purposes\nof this section.\nIn this section, if you look at (a), then,\n(a), which is the -- you know, basic exclusive remedy\nprovision that Your Honor mentioned, what (a) does is\ndeal specifically with -- intent with medical\nmalpractice committed by doctors and personnel.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, one of the\nstrongest arguments by your adversary has to do with the\nincongruity between these claims and the Westfall ruling\nby this Court. It's more a policy argument than a\nlanguage argument, but how do you address the fact that\nwe will be interpreting, essentially, two statutes that\nare almost identical, but with different conclusions now, if\nwe were to adopt your view.\nMR. FELDMAN: Right. I -- I think there\nare -- there are a few reasons why the statutes have to\nbe construed differently. I mean, one is that, if you\nlook at the Court's decision in Smith, where it\nconstrued that provision of the Westfall Act, it -- the\nCourt never suggested that the language -- the part of\nthe Westfall Act whose language is the same as this\nsupported its conclusion there. It was relying on other\nprovisions in the Westfall Act.\nIn particular, there was a provision that\nsaid, \"Once the government substitutes itself for the\ndefendant, the case shall proceed, subject to all the\nexceptions and limitations in the Tort Claims Act.\" And\nthe Court said, well, yes, that -- that gives us a clear\nunderstanding that, whether there's exceptions or not,\nwe want that case to proceed -- to proceed. That\nprovision isn't here in the Gonzalez Act.\nAnd there was another provision in the\nWestfall Act -- in the Smith case, in the Westfall Act,\nthat dealt with making a specific exception for Bivens\ncases. And, again, that provision isn't here. And\nthat --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But why -- why would\nCongress want to treat them differently?\nMR. FELDMAN: Right. I think the reason is,\nwhen they were dealing in this case with this area in\n1976, they were dealing with a specific problem of\nmedical malpractice, and they were looking at that --\nthat problem, doctors, doctors had to get insurance,\nwhat are we going to do about that for Federal\nemployees?\nAnd they were -- when they focused on that\nproblem -- actually, as the Executive Branch itself said\nin a letter that was sent to the Senate committee, it\nsaid there's an urgent need, both, to assure adequate\nremedies for tort victims and to protect Federal\nemployees.\nAnd that's what they were trying to do here,\nand I think you see it throughout the Gonzalez Act.\nBut --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But why -- why did they\nfeel the need here to assure adequate remedies for tort\nvictims, where they did not in -- in the Westfall Act?\nMR. FELDMAN: Well --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I mean -- you know, injured\ntort victims are injured tort victims. It does seem --\nyou know, rather odd that, in -- in one instance,\nCongress would be concerned and, the other, not\nconcerned.\nMR. FELDMAN: Right. I think the difference\nis that, here, they were dealing specifically with the\nproblem of medical malpractice. 12 years later, when\nthey got around to the Westfall Act, they weren't\nlooking at medical malpractice.\nThey were looking, generally, at a whole --\nthe whole problem of government employees being sued\nafter this Court's decision in the Westfall case, a\nproblem that particularly affected, actually, lower\nlevel government employees who were -- it's clear,\ncouldn't take advantage of the discretionary function\nexception.\nAnd, when they are looking at the broad\nuniverse of employees, they took a different approach\nand decided, well, we're just going to -- some people\nare just going to be out of luck because this is the --\nthe determination that Congress made -- felt was\nappropriate there.\nBut, when it was looking at the specific\nproblem of medical malpractice in the Gonzalez Act, it\ndefinitely took the position, as everybody said at the\ntime and as the structure of the Act itself showed, that\nthey wanted to preserve remedies. And there are two\nprovisions in the Westfall Act that make that clear --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, maybe we could address\nthis in slightly more concrete terms. You have two --\ntwo situations. In one case, a Federal employee who's\ndriving a car deliberately runs somebody down. And, in\nthe second case, a government doctor grabs somebody who\ndoesn't want an operation and performs the operation\nanyway.\nNow, as -- under your reading, there\nwould -- there would be a claim against the government\nin the second situation, but not in the first situation;\nis that right?\nMR. FELDMAN: That -- that's correct.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Why would Congress want\nthat?\nMR. FELDMAN: The reason they'd want it is\nthis: In the first situation, that -- that really\narose -- that -- that problem came with the Tort Claims\nAct when it was first enacted in 1946. And, when\nCongress was looking at the universe of Federal\nemployees, they felt -- and, especially, given the law\nat that time and that continued really up to the\npresent, that, when a Federal employee or average\nFederal employee, for the types of intentional torts\nthat they commit, especially a battery, it's\nextraordinarily unlikely that that's going to be within\nthat scope of that employee's employment.\nAnd Congress felt, well, we want to just\neliminate that altogether. It's not just to hold the\ngovernment responsible for that kind of a claim, when\nsome Federal clerk slugs someone or something like that,\nand that was the determination they made.\nWhen they got around to 1976, to dealing\nwith the particular problem of medical malpractice,\nthe -- it doesn't actually usually happen -- these kinds\nof claims don't arise -- I'm not aware of anywhere a\ndoctor just grabs somebody and throws him, physically,\ninto the operating room. They happen when the doctor is\nperforming some procedure and performs a different\nprocedure or a procedure that was not authorized by the\npatient.\nAnd that -- that is very closely related to\ncore medical malpractice claims of exactly the sort that\nthey were dealing with here. It's very closely related\nto informed consent claims, which I believe the\ngovernment -- I read the government to be conceding,\ncould be brought against the government.\nAnd they thought there was no reason to\ndistinguish -- to distinguish one type of medical\nmalpractice from another. We want all of these claims,\nwe want to provide a remedy, and they all should be\nbrought against the government.\nI would add one other --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: In law review commentaries\nand maybe in lower courts' opinion, is there -- is it\nfair to say that the weight of authority is to criticize\nthe battery-negligence distinction as being productive\nof litigation and not really making a lot of sense?\nMR. FELDMAN: I think that is fair to say,\nand -- you know, States -- a lot of States have dealt\nwith this by dealing with -- in statutory -- in\nstatutes, not in common law development, so they\ncould kind of rationalize the system and say, look, this\nis the kinds of claims you're going to have.\nBut the key thing is that everybody in the\ncountry, I think, under every State's law, if a doctor\nperforms an operation that you didn't consent to, you\nhave an action in tort. And that protects both you and\nprovides an incentive -- an important incentive, to\ndoctors and medical personnel, to be sure that they are\nonly doing what they are authorized to do.\nThere is not a hint that, when Congress was\ndealing with the Westfall Act -- I keep saying, \"the\nWestfall Act\" -- when Congress was dealing with the\nGonzalez Act, there is not a hint that they were trying\nthere to say, well, we want to save money or something\nby eliminating those kind of very, very traditional tort\nclaims from those victims, and we don't want those\npeople to have compensation.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Feldman, do I\nunderstand the mechanics of this right, that, if the\ninjured person sued the United States directly, that\nsuit would fail because the battery exclusion would\napply, but it's only by suing the officer -- the doctor\nand then getting the United States substituted that the\nbattery exception is abrogated; is that right?\nMR. FELDMAN: No, I don't -- I don't believe\nthat that's correct. There is nothing in this Act that\nsays it should make any difference. There is nothing,\ncertainly, in Subsection (e) or anywhere else in the Act\nthat says it should make any difference, whether you are\nsuing the government or suing the -- or suing the -- or\nsuing the doctor. If you sue the government, the\ngovernment says, well, we have a defense that the\nintentional tort exception applies.\nYou would say, no, it says here, for\npurposes of this section, the intentional tort exception\ndoes not apply. And what that means, \"for the purposes\nof this section,\" is for claims that are covered by this\nAct, which is claims that are medical tort claims\nbrought against personnel of the affected agencies who\nare acting within the scope of their authority.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Are there any -- I'm\nsorry.\nAre there any other tort claims besides the\nlack of consent battery claim at issue here that could\nbe encompassed by the Intentional Tort Act, as it\nrelates to medical malpractice?\nLet's assume that it's not an operation, but\nsexual behavior with a patient in their hospital room,\nsomething of that nature.\nIs that covered under the Gonzalez Act, as a\nclaim against the United States?\nMR. FELDMAN: If it would be an assault or\nbattery that was committed by -- within the scope of the\nprofessional's employment, then it would be. But it's\nalways the question of whether it's within the scope of\nemployment.\nAnd I think, usually, the -- the case law --\nI mean, I think, usually, the cases are that a doctor\nwho commits a sexual assault on a patient or something\nis not acting within -- in the kind of circumstances you\nare talking about, is not acting within the scope of\nemployment.\nBut that would be a case-by-case\ndetermination. There might be some kind of case\nwhere -- you know, it would depend on the facts of the\ncase.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: This exception you're --\nyou're talking about is regularly applied in the lower\ncourts?\nMR. FELDMAN: What -- I beg your pardon?\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: In the lower courts,\nthis determination is regularly made?\nMR. FELDMAN: The -- the scope of employment\ndetermination is made every day because that is made --\nthat is applicable throughout, in any kind of respondeat\nsuperior situation, whenever the employer of the medical\nprofessional is sued and that kind of thing -- or -- or\nnonmedical professional, for that matter. That --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Of course, when the\ngovernment removes the case, it concedes that point,\ndoesn't it, normally? Where a case is removed from\nState court, the government -- the Attorney General must\ncertify that it was within the scope of employment, no?\nMR. FELDMAN: That's correct. That's\ncorrect. And that is actually one of the two -- one of\ntwo of the key provisions of the Act, that kind of\nestablish -- that could make it very clear that what\nCongress was trying to do was preserve remedies because,\nin that very provision, after it talks about removing\nwhen the Attorney General has certified that it's within\nthe scope of employment, it says, \"The case can be\nremanded if the removed case is one such that\" there --\n\"that no remedy against the United States is available.\"\nAnd what that shows is that Congress knew\nthat there would be actions that would continue to be\nbrought against doctors. And they actually wanted to\nprovide for that, right there, and say it should be --\nthose should be remanded to State court, and then they\nwill proceed against the doctor in State court.\nThen there is -- so that there would be --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What was that case, where\nno action against the United States is available?\nMR. FELDMAN: That would be a case, for\nexample --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Not -- not by reason of\nthe -- of the battery?\nMR. FELDMAN: No, it wouldn't be -- if\nCongress didn't have this provision in the statute --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I understand.\nMR. FELDMAN: -- it would have been by\nreason -- that would have been.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, yes.\nMR. FELDMAN: Another one would be a foreign\ntort, which is also another exception under the Tort\nClaims Act --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I see.\nMR. FELDMAN: -- a discretionary function\ncase, and there are some in the medical context.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I got you.\nMR. FELDMAN: Or one of the other\nexceptions. All of those exception cases, they go on.\nThey go on, and Congress -- Congress could have closed\nall of them down.\nAnd, in fact, if Congress was worried that\nthere would be -- really, if their sole purpose here was\nto say, we don't want any actions to be brought against\nFederal employees, they should -- they could have just\nsaid, we don't want any actions to be brought against\nFederal employees. But, instead, they are providing for\nwhat happens and for the continuation of the action\nagainst the doctor.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Now, the government has an\nalternative interpretation, and I know you think it's\nwrong. But would you go further and say that it's not a\nplausible interpretation?\nMR. FELDMAN: I would. I think that\nbecause, as the court -- when the courts used -- you\nknow, a number of different formulations to -- to talk\nabout that -- I think you are referring to a kind of\nstrict construction rule that -- that applies to waivers\nof sovereign immunity, which we don't think is\napplicable here.\nBut, even where that rule does apply,\nreally, the question is, is it a reasonable degree of\nclarity that Congress intended to waive immunity? Is it\n-- as the Court has said, is it clearly discernible from\na fair reading of the statute that they intended to\nwaive?\nAnd it has to be clear, and I think it is\nclear here. And that was what everybody at the time of\nthe statute thought. It's what the government itself\nthought up through the time of the -- of the Smith case,\n15 --\nJUSTICE ALITO: But was the\ninterpretation adopted by the district court and by the\nNinth Circuit, but you still say is implausible.\nMR. FELDMAN: I think so. I would add\nthat -- I am not here to defend the Ninth Circuit's\njudgment, but I would add that they had a pro se\nlitigant before them, and I don't think they had access\nto the full degree of presentation that they might have\nhad, if -- if it had been more fully developed.\nBut I do think that, when the Court is\nmaking that determination of what's clearly discernible\nfrom a fair reading of the statute, the Court has also\nmade it clear, though, that what you don't do is take\neach word in the statute and say, we're going to take\nthe most pro-government meaning of this word, and then\nyou add them altogether.\nWhat you do is you look at the statute as a\nwhole, you look at the context of the statute, you look\nat the structure of the statute, and then you say what\nis plausible, what is clearly discernible from a fair\nreading.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Feldman, when the\nWestfall Act, which doesn't abrogate the intentional\ntort provision, when that was passed, why -- was there\nany reason why Congress kept these five or six separate\nacts, like the Gonzalez Act, instead of saying, well, we\ndid this piecemeal for particular agencies, and, now, we\nwe're dealing with Federal employees across the board, so\nthere is no reason why we should have these five or six\nthat go another way?\nMR. FELDMAN: Well, I can give you the\nanswer that the government gave in its brief in Smith,\nwhich is the Gonzalez Act and the other four or five\nstatutes continue to serve two -- at least two vital\nfunctions, and one is specifically this: That they\neliminate the -- the intentional tort exception and,\ntherefore, allow relief for victims of intentional tort\nin this medical malpractice context, just like victims\nof other kinds of malpractice.\nThe other thing is there are some cases, for\ninstance, foreign torts, where there is another\nprovision of the Gonzalez Act, 1089(f), that provides\nfor indemnifying or holding harmless doctors, when\njudgments are against them in certain -- when there's a\nforeign tort, when the doctor has been detailed to a\nnon-Federal agency, or if the circumstances are such as\nare likely to preclude a remedy under the Tort Claims\nAct.\nSo, again, Congress in that -- that\nprovision remains important because there could be a\nforeign judgment against the doctor or something, even\nafter the Westfall Act, and that would -- that gives the\nauthority to reimburse the doctor, if the agency\ndetermines that -- that that's appropriate.\nBut that provision also shows that Congress\nintended that to preserve remedies here because it would\nhave made no sense for Congress to say, we want to\nprovide for the indemnification or reimbursement of the\ndoctor, if what they really were trying to do was\neliminate all the cases against doctors.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Feldman, is --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It -- it --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Justice --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's right on the same\nthing, so I -- that provision ends -- and I am\nstrengthening you -- your last point -- that provision\nends, \"if the circumstances are such as are likely to\npreclude the remedies of third persons against the\nUnited States described in Section 1346(b) of Title 28.\"\nThat clearly envisions that, in the ordinary\ncase, those remedies against the United States would not\nbe precluded.\nMR. FELDMAN: That's right. And the -- and\nthe choice that Congress had -- had here, really, was\nbetween taking intentional tort cases and allowing them\nto be continued to be brought against doctors and then\nsubject to this kind of reimbursement provision, which\nthey had provided for, or saying, no, we want these to\njust be brought against the government and to protect\nthe Federal employees much more fully. And so that was\nthe purpose of 1089(e).\nThey said, we want to steer this into the\nsame channel that all the other malpractice actions are\ngoing into.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Feldman, as I understand\nyour argument and -- and the differences that you have\nwith the government, you have one set of differences\nabout the meaning of 1089(e), but then another set about\nthis question of, if it were true that the government\nwas immune from suit, could you bring a tort suit\nagainst the doctors?\nAnd the government said -- says no. And you\nsay, yes, you might be able to do that. But do you have\nto answer that question, at all, in order to say that\nyou're correct on 1089(e)?\nMR. FELDMAN: No. I mean, that's -- that\nquestion isn't at issue in this case. That would really\nonly be directly at issue if somebody brought a suit\nagainst the doctor. But --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: So there is a lot of going\nback and forth about this question of what would happen\nif the government were immune, would the individual\ndoctor be immune? But that is, essentially, irrelevant\nto the question before us; is that correct?\nMR. FELDMAN: I -- I just wouldn't say it's\nirrelevant because what the -- the provisions that I\nhave been talking about show is that Congress --\nCongress was not trying, in this Act, unlike in the\nWestfall Act, which doesn't have either of these two\nprovisions, the reimbursement and remand provision that\nI've talked about -- unlike in the Westfall Act,\nCongress wasn't trying to save money or other -- do\nsomething else by just eliminating remedies for victims.\nIt was trying to -- as the Executive Branch\nsaid, as I said, to assure remedies for all tort victims\nand to protect doctors in a variety of different ways.\nAnd given that that's what they were trying to do in the\nGonzalez Act, which is clear from the structure, that\nalso helps clarify what 1080 -- or makes more clear what\n1089(e) means.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Saying it a different way, I\ndon't have to accept your broader argument; I can remain\nambivalent about your broader argument and still accept\nyour narrower argument.\nMR. FELDMAN: Yes.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Is that correct?\nMR. FELDMAN: Yes. That is correct.\nI would add that, with respect to the strict\nconstruction standard, I don't think it does apply in --\nin this context. The Court has never applied it in the\nFederal Tort Claims Act context. In the Gonzalez Act,\n1089(e), specifically, refers to the Federal Tort Claims\nAct. It says, \"Section 2680(h) of Title 28.\"\nEach of the other provisions of the Gonzalez\nAct, for their operation, also depend on the Federal\nTort Claims Act. The exclusive remedy provision talks\nabout the Tort Claims Act. The reimbursement provision,\nthe remand version, each of them -- the whole statute is\nreally part of the Federal Tort Claims Act machinery.\nAnd, when Congress invoked that machinery\nhere, I think it knew and I think it was consistent with\nthis Court's precedents that the Court applied the same\nrule that it applied in the Dolan case, which is\nconstruing the words in accordance with their reason and\nnormal tools of statutory construction, without a strict\nconstruction rule.\nAlthough, as I said, I do think that it is\nclear what the meaning of -- of the provision is, if\nthey do -- you do apply the rule.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Feldman.\nMr. Shah?\nORAL ARGUMENT OF PRATIK A. SHAH\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. SHAH: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nSubsection (e) of the Gonzalez Act states,\nin pertinent part, that, \"For purposes of this section,\"\nwhich refers to the Gonzales Act, \"the FTCA's\nintentional tort exception shall not apply.\"\nThe question in this case is whether those\nwords unequivocally waive sovereign immunity for medical\nbattery claims like Petitioner's. The answer is --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, the\n\"unequivocally\" -- we have a lot of cases that say you\ndon't get -- you certainly get the benefit of the\n\"unequivocally\" standard, when you are talking about a\nwaiver of sovereign immunity in the first instance, but\nyou don't keep getting the benefit over and over again\nwhen you are talking about, as in this case, an\nexception to an exception to an exception.\nMR. SHAH: Well, Your Honor, I think the --\nthe canon actually applies most strongly in this set of\ncircumstances. And let me talk about Dolan and the line\nof cases which recognizes a very narrow exception to the\nnormal presumption against waivers of sovereign\nimmunity.\nDolan and the -- and its predecessor cases\nrecognize that the narrow exception to the canon, when\nconstruing the scope of exceptions that were enacted\nalongside the broad waiver of sovereign immunity in the\nFTCA itself. And the purpose of drawing that exception\nto the canon was it didn't want -- the Court didn't want\nto defeat Congress's purpose as manifest in the broad\nwaiver itself.\nThose exceptions were cutting back on the\ncontemporaneous waiver of sovereign immunity. The Court\nsaid, we don't want to cut back, given the uniquely\nbroad waiver that the FTCA enacts. It's a narrow rule\nexception limited to those circumstances that hasn't\nbeen applied outside those circumstances.\nUnlike those cases, this case is not\nconstruing the scope of an exception that was enacted\nalongside the FTCA that was trying to cut back on the\nwaiver of sovereign immunity.\nTo put it more concretely, on the day before\nthe Gonzalez Act was enacted, there was no question that\nsovereign immunity barred the type of claim at issue;\nthat is, no one had any dispute that the FTCA's baseline\nof sovereign immunity applied and would have blocked\nthis claim.\nThe question is whether --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but that was\nbecause, at that point, there was an exception to the\nexception of sovereign immunity.\nMR. SHAH: Correct.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And you're going\neven a step further, to say you get the benefit of the\nunequivocal test that you've set forth at even the next\nstage.\nMR. SHAH: Here's --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, you've already --\nyou've already used up your benefit of an unequivocal\nrequirement when you've got the interpretation of the\nFTCA itself, which is the waiver of sovereign immunity.\nMR. SHAH: Well, Your Honor, we haven't used\nit up because of the scope of interpreting Section\n2680(h). You wouldn't apply the waiver because of the\nexception that was enacted in Dolan. That's Dolan\nitself. If we were just talking about construing the\nscope of Section 2680(h) itself, I would agree\ncompletely with you.\nWhat we have here is, some years later, we\nhave a baseline of sovereign immunity. Everyone agrees\nthat the FTCA and its exceptions have struck the\nappropriate balance.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Wait a minute. You\nagree with me that you don't get the benefit of your\nhigher standard of interpretation with respect to\n2680(h)?\nMR. SHAH: With respect to the terms of\n2680(h) as enacted at that time. The difference --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But then the -- then\nthe heightened standard of use sort of resurrects again,\nwhen you get to considering an exception to 2680(h).\nMR. SHAH: The reason, Your Honor, is that\nyou have a baseline of sovereign immunity. What 26 --\nin order for -- for the other side to prevail, Section\n1089(e) has to waive sovereign immunity.\nIt has to -- it has to enact a new waiver of\nsovereign immunity that, undisputedly, applied the day\nbefore the Gonzalez Act. That is when the canon should\napply most strongly, when -- when the other side is\nsaying that Congress --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What do you need more\nclear than \"(h) doesn't apply\"?\nMR. SHAH: Well, Your Honor --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I mean, I don't know how\nmuch clearer Congress has to get than to say it's\nnullified.\nMR. SHAH: Sure.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What more does it have\nto say; the exception doesn't apply, and then what's\nleft?\nMR. SHAH: Your Honor, if all it said is\nthat the intentional tort exception does not apply, I\nwould agree with you, that that would be enough. And\nthat's exactly what Congress said in the 1988 --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But it didn't -- it didn't\nwant to say it shall not apply for everything. It\ndidn't want to eliminate the intentional tort exception\nfor everybody, right? It only wanted to eliminate it\nfor the people covered by -- by the Gonzalez Act.\nMR. SHAH: That -- that may well be true,\nand Congress, when it enacted the 1988 VA Act, did it in\nthe most direct way. It said, \"The intentional tort\nexception shall not apply with respect to personnel\nemployed by the VA.\" But it --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It might have said that,\nbut, if it wanted to be more parsimonious in its\nlanguage, it could simply say for purposes of this\nsection.\nMR. SHAH: Well --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Which section applies only\nto these particular individuals.\nMR. SHAH: Justice Scalia, I think it might\nbe helpful to take a step back. We have four statutes\nstarting in 1965, then 1976. The Gonzalez Act was part\nof that chain. All four statutes in this relevant\nsubsection, the analogue, the Subsection (e) here, said,\n\"For purposes of this section, the intentional tort\nexception shall not apply.\"\nThen we get to 1988, the last one in the\nline, which is the VA amendment. It changes that\nlanguage. It eliminates that opening proviso for\npurposes of this section. The legislative history\naccompanying it says, look, we want to allow intentional\ntort remedies for veterans.\nIt does so -- the only reason I can conceive\nof that Congress would have done it is because it didn't\nthink that the prior four model statutes did it clearly\nenough. And I think that is the reason. And -- and if\nwe were in a normal statutory --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It was a -- it was a\ndifferent Congress. They don't always use the same\nlanguage. Come on.\nMR. SHAH: Well, Your Honor, they used the\nidentical language --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You're -- you're lucky they\neven remember the earlier statutes.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. SHAH: Well, Your Honor, they use the\nidentical language in every other provision of that\nstatute. They made an affirmative decision to change\nthe language of Subsection (e). Now, if this were an\nordinary --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Now, what do you do with\nJustice Breyer's point -- or with your adversary's\npoint? I know you'll tell us don't look at the\nCongressional Record because it suits you right now,\nbecause when it doesn't, you point to it extensively.\nBut what do you do with the Veterans Act\nrecord that says, we are modeling ourselves after the\nGonzalez Act, including its nullification of the\nintentional tort?\nMR. SHAH: Well -- well, Your Honor, it said\nthe first part. It did not say the second part. There\nis nothing in that legislative history that says it\nis -- it thought 1089(e) nullified the intentional tort\nexception. It says it's patterned after the Gonzalez\nAct, and then it changed the main language, the opening\nproviso of that provision.\nNow, if this were an ordinary case of\nstatutory interpretation, this Court would have to\nfigure out whether, by changing that language, did\nCongress just want to tinker with the language to\nclarify its intent? Did it intend to have a dispositive\nchange by making that change in language?\nBut this is not an ordinary case of\nstatutory interpretation.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, listen, I -- you\nknow, I don't -- I don't much care about legislative\nhistory, but -- but, if I did --\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- I wouldn't think that --\nthat you would say it is patterned after another Act,\nwhere you change a very basic provision, whether suit\ncan be brought against the United States or not.\nMR. SHAH: Well, Your Honor, it is\npatterned --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, that's sort of\nrudimentary and fundamental to it. It doesn't seem to\nme they would say it's patterned after it. But -- you\nknow, I -- I don't care.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. SHAH: Well, Your Honor, it is patterned\nin the sense it does use the operative language. It\ntakes out the key opening proviso, which is the entire\ndispute in this case.\nBut legislative history, while it might be\nimportant if this were a normal statutory interpretation\ncase, this Court has said, time and time again, you\ncannot look to the legislative history to supply an\nunequivocal waiver that is not present in the text\nitself.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Well, let's go back to the\ntext then, Mr. Shah. As I understand your argument, it\ngoes something like this: This provision is there to --\nto prevent people from drawing a mistaken inference.\nAnd the inference would be that the doctors were liable\nbecause the government was not. Now, there are a\nthousand ways to do that pretty clearly.\nYou could just say, irrespective of whether\nthe government is liable, the doctors are not -- or some\nsuch thing.\nMR. SHAH: Sure.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: But, instead, what Congress\ndid was it enacted a kind of \"let's pretend\" provision,\nright? Let's pretend that the government is liable, so\nthen the inference won't arise. Now, that has to be not\njust not the best way of achieving Congress's objective;\nit has to be the worst, right, because, then, you're\nraising the inference that in fact the government is\nliable.\nWhy would Congress have wanted to do that?\nMR. SHAH: Well, Your Honor, I agree with\nyou, Congress could have written this provision in a\ndifferent way and more clear ways, but I think it's\nhelpful --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: I'm saying something more\nthan that.\nMR. SHAH: Sure.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: It could not have written it\nin a worse way.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. SHAH: Well, I would disagree with that.\nBut let me -- let me take a step back here, on sort of\nthe landscape in which Subsection (e) was enacted.\nBoth sides agree that, without Subsection\n(e), covered medical personnel would have faced the risk\nof personal liability for medical battery claims. Both\nsides also agree that Subsection (e) was enacted to\nobviate that risk and, in fact, successfully does so\nunder either side's construction. Everyone agrees on\nthat.\nThe dispute here is whether Congress\naccomplished that objective by, A, assuming the\nexistence of an available tort remedy for purposes of\nthe Gonzalez Act's conferral of immunity, as the text of\nthe provision suggests; or, instead, whether it takes\nthe substantial further step of actually amending the\nFTCA, which is a separate -- an entirely separate\nstatute and, thereby, provide a remedy against the\nUnited States.\nThe latter construction, I don't think is\nunmistakably correct, it's not unavoidable. And -- and,\nbecause of that, the unequivocal waiver requirement\nfavors the government --\nJUSTICE BREYER: You're -- you're -- I'm\npicking up from -- I find Justice Scalia's hypothetical\ninterpretations of legislative history very useful.\nSo the -- the -- and I --\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Thank you. Thank you, dear\ncolleague. I appreciate that.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: The -- the thing where we\nare in this -- it' -- we have a -- we have a statute,\n1089, basically, and it says you can sue the government\nfor the tort of an employee -- I'm oversimplifying, I'm\noversimplifying so. And we should interpret that narrowly,\nokay? We should interpret that -- absolutely has to be\ndefinite, and it is pretty definite.\nNow, what we have is an exception to that.\nAnd the exception is an exception for battery, but not\nbattery. Can't sue the United States for battery. And\nwe're supposed to interpret that, I guess, as broadly as\npossible. If you have a plausible argument that it\ncould be broader, you get it, as long as it's plausible.\nThen what we have -- because, after all,\nafter these two things, you can still sue the person who\nhit you over the head, you can go sue him in a State\ncourt, can't you? Now, oh, now, we bring a new Act\nthere. And this new Act says, we are going to have a\nlittle exception to the exception. Right? And we are\nsupposed to interpret that one, I guess, as narrowly as\npossible.\nYou see -- so, now, what we are -- because\nthat's an exception to something which should be\ninterpreted as broadly as possible, which is an\nexception to something that should be interpreted as\nnarrowly as possible.\nSo I think I get it like Costello used to, I\ndon't know what I'm talking about.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: Because there are a lot of\nwords in these things. And -- and so given all these\nwords and -- this is where the Chief Justice started --\nI mean, can't we at least look at legislative history,\nto try to figure out what Congress was doing by the time\nwe get to the exception to the exception to the\nexception?\nMR. SHAH: No -- no, Your Honor. This Court\nhas made quite clear you cannot look at the\nlegislative history. And the fact that, if you find\nthis confusing --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes.\nMR. SHAH: -- Justice Breyer, if you find\nit's not --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, then you win, as long\nas I find it confusing.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. SHAH: -- unequivocally clear, we win,\nand you don't look to the legislative history for\nclarity. That's the point of what --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, I don't find it all\nthat confusing. What it says is that this battery\nexception, which is in (h), is not supposed to apply\nwhen we look at the military doctors. That's what it\nsays.\nMR. SHAH: Your Honor --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And if -- and you say, ah,\nbut it says, \"for purposes of this section.\" Okay. I\nlook at \"for purposes of this section,\" and the purposes\nof this section -- the very first whole sentence has to\ndo with 1089. It has to do with the scope. It has to\ndo with the general waiver.\nMR. SHAH: Well, the \"for purposes of this\nsection\" language, I think, is the key phrase, and this\nsection refers to the Gonzalez Act. What the Gonzalez\nAct primarily does -- what Sections (a) through (c) are\nall about, are about conferring personal immunity. So I\nthink --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't think those are the\nkey words. I think the key words are \"shall not apply.\"\n\"Shall not apply.\"\nMR. SHAH: Well, Your Honor --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It isn't shall be deemed\ninapplicable.\nMR. SHAH: Your Honor, I think, when we are\nreading it --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It is not a hypothetical.\nIt says, \"They shall not apply to any cause of action,\"\netc.\nMR. SHAH: I think, when we are reading it\nagainst the canon -- the sovereign immunity canon, I\nthink we would expect Congress to speak more clearly.\nAnd Congress gave us two examples of how it spoke more\nclearly in this very context.\nOne is, in 1974, the sole -- the only time\nit amended Section 2680(h), it amended it within the --\nthe provision itself; that is, it amended the language\nof 2680(h) to add a law enforcement proviso that said,\n\"This exception applies except with respect to law\nenforcement in certain circumstances.\"\nThat's one way --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay. But why? Why would\nthey have wanted to do that? That is to say, look, if\nyou cut the exception to the exception to the exception,\nthe presumption, da, da, da, out of it, what we've got\non your interpretation is that a person who's hurt by a\nbattery committed by a government official, given your\ninterpretation, has no remedy at all. I mean,\npreviously, he could have at least sued in State court.\nMR. SHAH: Well --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Now, what you're saying is\nCongress tried to do with this language is say, hey, you\ncan't sue in State court; and, by the way, when you try\nto sue the Federal government, we are not going to give\nyou your suit, either. Why do that?\nMR. SHAH: Well, Your Honor, I don't\nthink -- I don't think that's true. I think before --\nbefore the Gonzalez Act came along, there was a split in\nthe circuits. That's why the Gonzalez Act came along.\nThere were -- there were circuits that did not allow a\nclaim to proceed personally against the physician.\nThere were circuits that recognized absolute\nimmunity against a personal suit, even while it was\nundisputed that battery claim could not proceed against\nthe government.\nThat -- and what -- what Congress said, if\nyou want to look at legislative history, what the Senate\nReport says is, in light of this D.C. Circuit decision\nthat went the other way, Congress enacted the Gonzalez\nAct because it was primarily concerned about conferring\npersonal immunity.\nEvery time the Senate Report talks about the\npurpose of the bill -- it's on page 1, heading, \"Purpose\nof the Bill\" -- it says conferring personal immunity,\nnothing about expanding the government's tort liability.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Shah, this is not\nalways the government's position. In fact, in a brief\nto this Court, in the Smith case, the government took\nthe position that Mr. Feldman is presenting to us.\nWhat occurred to turn on the light for the\ngovernment, to see that it was wrong in the Smith case\nand come up with this -- the interpretation you are now\nadvancing?\nMR. SHAH: Sure, Justice Ginsburg. Well,\nthe first thing I would say is that Section 1089(e) was\nnot directly at issue in Smith, and the issue had really\nbeen litigated quite sparsely, both before and after\nSmith.\nOnce this case presented itself, the\ngovernment revisited its position. I think there were\ntwo --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: But this is not a side\nissue, Mr. Shah. In fact, you used your understanding\nof 1089(e) as an argument to produce that the result this\nCourt reached in Smith, so it was -- it was not a very\nlarge issue, but it was -- it was an argument.\nYou said -- you know, we should reach the\nresult that we -- that you wanted in Smith because\n1089(e) would continue to have this effect.\nMR. SHAH: Well, Your Honor, I don't agree\nwith that characterization. The government's argument\nwould have been identical, with or without 1089(e). But\nI don't want to quibble about --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: It was a supportive\nargument. I am not saying that it was the but-for\nargument, but it was clearly a supportive argument in\nyour brief.\nMR. SHAH: Your Honor, if you want to read\nit that way, I think that's fine. I think --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why -- why else was it\nthere? Just for fun?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. SHAH: No, I agree. It was in order\nto --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It was obviously there to\nsupport your position. Now, your position would have\nbeen the same. Now, that's true. Your position would\nhave been identical, but the only purpose of that\nargument was to support that position.\nMR. SHAH: Your Honor, I agree. It -- it\nsupported that position --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And that was\nsuccessful. The Court relied on that argument several\ntimes in its opinion.\nMR. SHAH: I don't believe so, Your Honor.\nI don't believe the Court --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We certainly -- we\ncertainly cited Smith.\nMR. SHAH: Yes, but the Court did not\ninterpret 1089(e). I think Smith -- what Smith\nhopefully said, Your Honor -- and this is one of the\nreasons why the government revisited its position --\nwhat the Court said in the Smith decision -- you don't\nhave to take my word of what the legislative history\nsays.\nWhat the -- what the Court in Smith itself\nsaid is that the sole purpose of the Gonzalez Act -- not\nthe primary purpose, not a purpose, not a chief\npurpose -- the sole purpose of the Gonzalez Act -- and\nit's talking about the Gonzalez Act as a whole -- was to\nconfer personal immunity and not to create malpractice\nrights in favor of plaintiffs.\nWhat Justice Ginsburg --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Your friend -- your\nfriend says that, in Smith -- I'm sorry for the\nconfusion -- the Court addressed your argument on the\nmeaning of the Gonzalez Act several times.\nMR. SHAH: Your Honor, it did not address\n1089(e) at all, and -- and I think that's plain as day\nfrom -- from the opinion. What the Court said in Smith\nis that the purpose of the Gonzalez Act -- the sole\npurpose of the Gonzalez Act is to confer personal\nimmunity. And what it also said is the Gonzalez Act\ndoes not create malpractice rights in favor of\nplaintiff.\nThat was one of the things that the\ngovernment looked at in reformulating its position and\nadopting its current position, was the decision in\nSmith, which came after our brief. The other thing we\nlooked at --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, you did -- you did\nsay, in the reply brief, that the point of the Gonzalez\nAct, it says, \"would enable plaintiffs to pursue those\nclaims against the United States.\"\nMR. SHAH: You are correct.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I know you would have been\ndisappointed if we didn't ask you about this.\nMR. SHAH: Yes, you are correct. We said\nit. This is a change of position. We revisited it.\nThere were a couple things we looked at in coming to\nour --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And I -- but it -- and\nJustice Kagan indicated, this wasn't just an aside.\nThis was rather a central theory for your interpretation\nof the Act; maybe not the only theory, but a central\ntheory.\nMR. SHAH: I -- again, I -- I disagree,\nfundamentally, with that characterization. It's two\nsentences in our brief. It's at the back end of the\nbrief. It was not fundamental to the position in Smith.\nThe Court did not rely on it at all in Smith.\nBut, even if all that were true, I think the\nimportant thing is why we changed our position. The one\nis -- the first and foremost is the statements in the\nCourt's decision in Smith itself, which, obviously,\npost-dated our brief --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't find that\ninconsistent with the position argued. There -- you are\ntalking about the statement that the sole purpose was --\nwas to --\nMR. SHAH: The two statements, the sole\npurpose of the Gonzalez Act is to confer immunity,\nnot --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't think it is the\nsole purpose, even if you -- you accept your friend's\ninterpretation.\nMR. SHAH: But, no --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No, no. The sole purpose\nis to assure immunity to these doctors. Now, in\nassuring immunity to these doctors, we -- we are not\ngoing to leave these people without any remedy, and so\nwe allowed them a remedy against the United States.\nThat's subsidiary to the sole purpose of the\nAct. Sure, the sole purpose is to -- is to -- is to\nhelp these doctors. But, in order to do it and be fair\nat the same time, you have to allow suit against the\nUnited States. I think you could still say the sole\npurpose was to help the doctors.\nMR. SHAH: Well, Your Honor, I would\ndisagree with that. The other side's brief says, all\nalong, the sole purpose of this Act was not just to\nconfer personal immunity, but it had a dual purpose.\nThe dual purpose was to confer personal\nimmunity -- and this is, time and time again, in the\nother side's brief -- to -- to confer personal immunity\nand also to provide adequate remedies to tort\nplaintiffs. That was not, we submit, a purpose, let\nalone a primary purpose, of the Gonzalez Act.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Why would -- why would\nCongress -- I mean, the Veterans Administration Act came\nafter the four or five others, and Congress thought it\nwas patterning that Act after the Gonzalez Act.\nWhy would Congress want to provide this\nbattery remedy if a Veterans Administration medical\nperson messed up, but not if it was an armed service\ndoctor?\nMR. SHAH: Of course, Congress doesn't say.\nI think there are two potential reasons, Justice\nGinsburg. One might be the -- as -- as this Court has\nrecognized, the special solicitude that Congress pays\nveterans, and it may have wanted to open up remedies to\nveterans that were unavailable to others.\nI think the second potential reason is the\ndefense side reasons. The defendants in Veterans Act\ncases are civilian Veterans Administration employees.\nIn a Gonzalez Act case, by and large, the defendants are\ngoing to be active military personnel. Congress is\noften hesitant to create -- expand judicial remedies\nagainst active military personnel because of the risk it\nposes to interfering with military function and order.\nSo I think those are two reasons why\nCongress may have decided to -- to change course in the\nVeterans Act in 1988, after it had four provisions that\nsaid exactly the same thing, using the four purposes of\nthis Act provision, it changed it, and it must have\nchanged it for a reason.\nTwo potential reasons are to change the\nresult, which, of course, under which the government\nwould win; or because it think -- it thought it needed\nto speak more clearly, in order to waive sovereign\nimmunity. And, under the presumption against sovereign\nimmunity waivers, the government would also prevail.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Shah, your basic theory\nof the case, which is that, in order to make absolutely\ncertain that everyone gets the benefit of the\nintentional tort exception, both the government and\nindividual doctors, in order to make that absolutely\nclear, Congress writes a provision saying that the\nintentional tort exception shall not apply.\nNow -- I mean, the -- the position, I have\nto say, seems to refute itself. If Congress wanted to\nmake absolutely clear that the intentional tort\nexception would apply, it wouldn't have written a\nprovision saying that it doesn't apply.\nMR. SHAH: Well, the provision that you\ndescribe, Justice Kagan, is not this provision. It's\nthe 1988 Veterans Act amendment, which says the\nintentional tort exception shall not apply. This\nprovision says, \"for purposes of this section,\" that is,\nfor purposes of the Gonzalez Act's conferral of immunity\nin Subsection (a), that the -- the intentional tort\nexception shall not apply.\nNow, sometimes, when Congress uses the four\npurposes of this section's formulation, sometimes, it\nuses words like \"assume that\" or \"consider that,\" as\nit -- as cited in the other side's brief, in footnote 4,\non page 18. However, other times, when it uses \"for\npurposes of this section,\" even though it intends\nsomewhat of a counterfactual inquiry, it eliminates\nthose words.\nIn Title 10 itself, Section 10 USC 335 says,\n\"for purposes of this section\" -- the exact language is,\n\"For purposes of this chapter, the term 'State' includes\nGuam and the Virgin Islands.\"\nNow, there's no dispute that Congress was\nnot trying to add Guam and the Virgin Islands as the\n51st and 52nd States of the Union. What it meant is,\nwhen applying the provisions of this section, treat Guam\nand Virgin Islands as if they are States. So --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Would you -- are you\nfinished there?\nMR. SHAH: Yes, sir.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Would -- would you go back\nfor a minute and think, before this Act was passed --\nthe Gonzalez Act -- and think of the millions of\ngovernment employees, and they're in different parts of\nthe country, and some of them commit batteries.\nNow, you told me before that, where an\ninjured person -- a plaintiff sues a government\nemployee, and they sue under State tort law, and they\nsay, this government employee committed a battery, okay,\nin the course of duty, you say there was an immunity\nthere.\nWhere did the immunity come from?\nMR. SHAH: It was -- it was a common law\nabsolute immunity.\nJUSTICE BREYER: From what?\nMR. SHAH: One -- one case is the\nMartinez --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I mean, what was the theory\nof it? I mean, here it's just -- it's a person, he's at\nwork, he does happen to work for the Federal government,\ninstead of working for someone else --\nMR. SHAH: Sure.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- and everybody else, you\nhave to respond, and you -- if liable, you'd have to pay\ndamages for the battery. Now, where -- where did the\nimmunity come from --\nMR. SHAH: The theory was --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- if the Federal employee\ndid it?\nMR. SHAH: The theory behind the individual\nimmunity was the same -- essentially, the same theory\nbehind the Westfall Act immunity that this Court\nrejected in the Westfall Act decision. So, up until\nWestfall, there was an argument that there was absolute\nimmunity, that -- that the individual government\nemployees had absolute immunity.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Why?\nMR. SHAH: It was a common law immunity\nthat -- it was an offshoot of the sovereign immunity,\nand it conferred it on the individual employee. This\nCourt, of course, in Westfall, rejected that notion and\nsaid -- you know, that immunity doesn't apply, unless\nyou are talking about both beings in the scope of\nemployment and that apply -- that involve discretionary\npolicy decisions at a high enough level.\nThe last point I would make, Your Honor, is,\neven if you believed -- and I think you do -- that the\ntexts were more naturally read to favor Petitioner, that\nis not enough. And I think you can look at this Court's\ndecision in Nordic Village.\nThe statutory provision in that case made\ncertain Bankruptcy Court determinations binding on the\ngovernment, \"notwithstanding any assertion of sovereign\nimmunity.\" The relevant language is reproduced on\nfootnote 10, on page 41 of our brief.\nThat language, \"notwithstanding any\nassertion of sovereign immunity,\" sounds awfully like a\nwaiver of sovereign immunity. It seems pretty explicit.\nBut what this Court said, in applying the unequivocal\nwaiver requirement, in finding that there was no waiver\nof sovereign immunity, despite that very explicit\nlanguage, was that the statute, nonetheless, performed a\nsignificant function.\nHere, the same is true. Section 1089(e),\nthough not authorizing monetary relief, still\nundisputedly performs a function here. It performs a\nfunction of securing the personal immunity conferred by\nSection 1089(a), that is, for purposes of the Gonzalez\nAct, the conferral of immunity under Section 1089(a).\nJust -- just as in Nordic Village, that is\nenough to construe the statute against a waiver of\nsovereign immunity.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you want us to\ndecide the case with the unequivocal question before us,\nin other words, deciding whether that benefit to the\ngovernment applies in this type of case.\nMR. SHAH: Yes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It seems to me to be\nyou are really upping the ante here, and it may well --\nI have no idea why the government took the opposite\nposition below, but that's -- that's putting a lot more\nat stake in this case than the particular statutory\nposition.\nMR. SHAH: Well, Your Honor, there are four\ncourts that have decided -- conclusively spoken -- to my\nknowledge, four courts, in the history, that have\ninterpreted this provision, Section 1089(e). All have\ncome out in the government's favor. There were two\ndistrict court decisions before the Smith case. Both\ncame out in the government's favor.\nThe only two decisions I am aware of are the\ntwo decisions in this case, conclusively interpreting\n1089(e), the district court and the court of appeals.\nBoth courts in this case relied on the unequivocal\nwaiver requirement. And I think that that's -- it's not\na stretch, at all, to apply the unequivocal waiver canon\nhere.\nIn fact, this case is far afield from Dolan.\nIt would be a substantial expansion of the narrow\nexception in Dolan to say that the unequivocal waiver\nrequirement didn't apply. There was no dispute that\nsovereign immunity applied the day before the Gonzalez\nAct was enacted.\nSo the only question is whether the Gonzalez\nAct enacts a new waiver of sovereign immunity. That is\nthe type of situation in which the canon applies most\nstrongly.\nAnd Congress did it in a separate statute.\nAgain, in Dolan, we were interpreting provisions that\neveryone agreed were part and parcel of the FTCA that --\nthat altered the balance of sovereign immunity. Here,\nthe question is whether it even affects or amends the\nFTCA in the first place, whether it means to affect the\nsovereign immunity balance in the first place.\nThat's an especially strong case in which we\nwould want an unequivocal waiver requirement.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Shah, does it make\nany sense to distinguish between a medical malpractice,\nnegligence and this unconsented operation, to split\nthose two and say the government is liable for\nmalpractice, but not for this unconsented action.\nMR. SHAH: Your Honor, I think it makes a\nlot of sense, and here's why: When Congress enacted the\nintentional tort exception itself in 1946, one of the\nprincipal reasons it -- it did that was because\nintentional tort claims are sometimes easier to allege\nbut more difficult to disprove.\nThat is particularly true with respect to\nthese sort of lack of consent claims, where you have a\npatient who has signed consent forms, agreed to a\nsurgery, and says -- and the facts of this case, I\nthink, are illustrative -- says right before the\nanesthesia kicked in, \"I said I don't want the procedure\nanymore.\"\nNow, here, the government was successful in\nwinning on summary judgment dismissal of the actual\nmedical negligence claim, that the doctor's standard of\ncare didn't -- that the doctor's care didn't meet the\nstandard of care.\nThe government won summary judgment on that\nbecause there -- there was no evidence -- no expert\ntestimony that supported Petitioner's claim. But his\nclaim that, \"I said no right before the anesthesia\nkicked in,\" survived summary judgment.\nAnd I think it was correct to survive\nsummary judgment, but the problem is that that survived\nsummary judgment, even though the deposition testimony,\nas pointed out in the government's brief, everyone else\nin the operating room, including the doctor, said that\nthis patient did not so object, just shows that these\nclaims --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Shah, can I ask you\nwhy -- if your interpretation is correct, Subsection (e)\ndid not read -- not for purposes of this section, but\nrather for purposes of Subsection (a), the provisions of\n2680(h) shall not apply?\nMR. SHAH: Well, Your -- may I -- may I\nrespond, Your Honor?\nFor -- this section -- Subsection (a), (b),\nand (c) all work in tandem. (D) is a settlement\nprovision that really doesn't really have anything to do\nwith this. So, when it says, \"for purposes of this\nsection,\" \"Subsection (a)\" and \"this section\" are\nessentially the only operative provisions of the Act.\nThe only other provisions that do any work\nare (e) and (f), which come after, obviously, Subsection\n(e). So, when Congress used the term \"for purposes of\nthis section,\" I think the fair statement is it was\nreferring to Subsections (a) through (c).\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Feldman, you have 4 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES A. FELDMAN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. FELDMAN: I -- I just wanted to make a\ncouple of quick points. One is the Court has not\napplied the clear statement -- the unequivocal statement\nstandard at any time in the Tort Claims Act, not just\nwhen it's dealing with exceptions, but, if you go back\nto the very early cases, the Aetna case, the Yellow Cab\ncase, really, right after the Act was passed, you can\nsee that the Court is saying there, no, we want to\ninterpret this Act to -- consistent with Congress's\nintent, the way it wanted it interpreted, which is with\na fair reading of its words, not in one direction, not\nin the other.\nI just also wanted to clarify, in the Smith\ncase because, of a possible misunderstanding, the Court\ndefinitely addressed the Gonzales Act, repeatedly, in\nits opinion in the Smith case, but it didn't -- the\nCourt did not actually address 1089(e).\nThe reason the government, though -- this\nwas important to the government, and, actually, the\ngovernment's reply brief in the Smith case was, I think,\na hundred percent about the Gonzales Act -- was that the\nother side of the Gonzales Act was saying, if you\nconstrue the Westfall Act the way the government wants,\nthat will be an implied repeal, but the Gonzales Act\nwill have nothing left to do.\nAnd it was important for the government --\nthat's why they kept saying it. It was important for\nthe government to say, no, the Gonzales Act does have\nthings to do, this is not an implied repeal. And one of\nthe things it does is exactly what we say Section\n1089(e) does.\nIf there are no further questions?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Feldman, the\nCourt invited you to brief and argue this case as an\namicus curiae, and you have ably discharged that\nresponsibility, for which the Court is grateful.\nMR. FELDMAN: Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The case is\nsubmitted.\n(Whereupon, at 11:05 a.m., the case in the\nabove-entitled matter was submitted.)\n60:9 47:19 48:6,13 affect 56:7 57:12 2:2,5,8
