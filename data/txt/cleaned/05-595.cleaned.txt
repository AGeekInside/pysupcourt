ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEORGE J. CHANOS
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. CHANOS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may
it please the Court:
Crawford v. Washington should not apply
retroactively to cases on collateral review because it
fails to meet the exacting standards for retroactivity
established by this Court in Teague versus Lane. In
addition, respondent is not entitled to relief under
AEDPA. Teague held that new rules of criminal generally
should not apply to cases on collateral review unless
they fall within one of two narrow exceptions. The
second exception, at issue here, is for those new
watershed rules of criminal procedure without which the
likelihood of an accurate conviction is seriously
diminished, rules that alter our understanding of the
bedrock procedural elements essential to a fair
proceeding. Crawford is not a watershed rule of
criminal procedure.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Could you give an
example, General Chanos, of one that is other than
Gideon? Is there any other one, or --
MR. CHANOS: The only example that this
Court has pointed to in its 25 years of retroactivity
jurisprudence is Gideon versus Wainwright.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: And none other occurs to
you?
MR. CHANOS: None other occurs to me at this
time. None of the cases that this Court has ruled are
not retroactive would I find to be retroactive or
watershed, and I certainly don't find Crawford to be
watershed. Crawford is not watershed because it is not
a rule without which the likelihood of an accurate
conviction is seriously diminished and it is not a rule
which altered our understanding of the bedrock
procedural elements essential to a fair proceeding.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I take it from your
presentation you think we do have to go through the
Teague analysis. We can't just rely on 2254(d)(1)?
MR. CHANOS: No, Chief Justice Roberts. I
believe that you could go straight to 2254(d)(1) and bar
relief under 2254(d)(1).
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well then, what do
you do about 2254(e)(1), or I guess (e)(2), which seems
to suggest at different rule if a case is made
retroactive?
MR. CHANOS: Well, 2254(e)(2) provides a
cause and prejudice opportunity in the event that the
state court denies relief on a procedural basis rather
than a substantive basis and the petitioner can show
cause and prejudice under 2254(e)(2)(A). The Federal
court could then look at the petitioner's claim because
no merits determination had been made by the state court
and, finding the cause and prejudice elements under
2254(e)(2), the Federal court would not be precluded
from making a merits determination since the -- and
conceivably applying a rule that had been made
retroactive active under Teague -- because the state
court had not made a substantive merits determination.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Now, my point was
that looking at (d)(1), it says is the decision contrary
to established law. And I would have thought that if
it's a new decision it's clearly not contrary to
established law.
MR. CHANOS: Correct.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But on the other
hand, you look at (e)(2) and it says here's what you do
if you're applying a new decision that's that been made
retroactive. So I would have thought that meant you
can't say simply because it's a new decision it won't
apply.
MR. CHANOS: Our reading of 2254(d)(1) is
that Congress intended to have the federal courts give
the state courts deference to the extent that the state
courts made a substantive determination. If the state
courts made no substantive determination, there's no
requirement for deference by the Federal courts, which
under 2254(e)(2)(A)(i) the Federal court conceivably
find that there was cause and prejudice under
2254(2)(a)(i) under the standards enumerated in those
subparagraphs (a) and (b) and could then make a merits
determination.
There would be nothing that would preclude
the Federal court from making a merits determination so
long as the state court had not already made a merits
determination.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, suppose the state
has, which is going straight to AEDPA. Does that mean
that Teague is out entirely, even the first category,
that is a decision, a substantive decision that would
mean that what defendant did was not a crime?
MR. CHANOS: Yes, Justice Ginsburg. It
would mean under -- under a plain meaning reading of
2254(d)(1), if the state court made a determination on
the merits, it would bar subsequent Federal review
whether it was a substantive, a substantive claim or a
procedural claim. However, in Atkins v. Kentucky there
would be nothing that would prevent the petitioner from
going back to the state court and arguing cause and
prejudice, and then if the state court were to make a
procedural determination on the second petition that
was -- that were to deny the petitioner his claim, he
could take that to the Federal court. The Federal court
could then look at that because it was only a procedural
determination by the state court on the second habeas
claim and the Federal court at that point could look
back at the substantive rule as established law because
on the second claim they have the right, if he's only
denied a procedure -- on a procedural basis, there's
nothing that would preclude the Federal court on his
second claim from looking back at what would then be
established law.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: What is the source of the
rule in Teague? Could Congress overturn the rule in
Teague if it wanted to and say that nothing is
retroactive or that everything is retroactive?
MR. CHANOS: My understanding is that the
rule in Teague is -- the source is not the U.S.
Constitution. It's a judicially created rule that began
with Linkletter and developed into Teague and its
progeny. And yes, I believe Congress could pass
2254(d)(1) and alter the habeas procedures, as they have
in enacting 2254(d)(1).
JUSTICE SCALIA: Habeas is an equitable --
MR. CHANOS: I'm sorry?
JUSTICE SCALIA: Habeas is equitable relief
and the Court has a lot of discretion in identifying the
boundaries of equitable relief, doesn't it?
MR. CHANOS: Yes, Justice Scalia.
JUSTICE SCALIA: I assume that's how we got
to Teague.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Let me ask this question
as to the basic issue of whether you should be relying
on Teague or the statute. If you're relying just on the
statute, how would it apply to a case which was correct
under established law at the time that the state court
made its ruling, but before the case reached the
appellate court, in which there was a change in our
interpretation? What if this case -- if Crawford had
been decided while the case was on appeal?
MR. CHANOS: While under the Court's
retroactivity jurisprudence Griffith would control,
under 2254 it would not. 22(d)(1) would control.
JUSTICE STEVENS: So it really makes a
difference whether we rely on Teague or whether we rely
on the statute if we disagree with you?
MR. CHANOS: It make difference. It makes a
difference.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I assume there would
be a Rule 60(b) motion or the equivalent of it in state
court.
MR. CHANOS: Yes.
JUSTICE SCALIA: If indeed our law had
changed; don't you think?
MR. CHANOS: Absolutely.
JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, it's inconceivable
that the problem wouldn't be solved in some fashion by
the state court that rendered the decision.
MR. CHANOS: I believe that the petitioner
would be able to make a subsequent habeas petition at
the state court level and if they were somehow denied
relief on a procedural basis, there would be nothing
that would preclude the Federal court from granting them
relief thereafter.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: That's a odd position to
take, to proliferate proceedings that way. I mean, I
thought your argument, AEDPA argument, was: Too bad,
the Federal court is out of it, but the state court is
most likely, recognizing that this Court has said what
this man did wasn't a crime, to grant him relief. But
if you're making this two-step and saying, but somehow
we can change the substantive proceeding into a
procedural proceeding, that seems to me odd, to
proliferate proceedings that way.
MR. CHANOS: Justice Ginsburg, what we're
saying is that Congress in enacting 2254(d)(1) was
stating that the Federal courts should give deference to
the state court decision so long as it is a merits
decision and so long as it complies with existing
clearly established law and is not unreasonable.
And if that occurs, then Congress under
2254(d)(1) was saying give state courts deference under
those circumstances.
JUSTICE SCALIA: You're saying not just
"clearly"; "then clearly established law."
MR. CHANOS: That's exactly.
JUSTICE SCALIA: That is, at the time of the
state court decision. *END STENO
MR. CHANOS: Exactly, absolutely, at the
time of the state court decision. In fact, if you look
at the language of 2254(d)(1) it says "resulted in a
decision that was contrary to or an unreasonable
application of clearly established Federal law. It
doesn't say "is contrary to clearly established law."
It says "was contrary to."
JUSTICE STEVENS: The word was is somewhat
ambiguous. It could either mean at the time of the
trial court's decision or at the time of the final
judgment on appeal.
MR. CHANOS: Well, in either case, it is
referring to the --
JUSTICE STEVENS: I know you win under
either view, but --
MR. CHANOS: Yes, exactly.
JUSTICE STEVENS: -- it could mean either of
those two things.
MR. CHANOS: Our, our position would be that
it would be up to when the decision became final.
Whatever the law was up to the time that the decision,
the state court decision became final, that is what was
clearly established law.
I'll continue with our Teague analysis
because we believe that the claim is barred under either
analysis. The --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Crawford did use the term
bedrock?
MR. CHANOS: Yes. Yes. And what
Crawford -- what we believe Crawford was saying -- well,
Crawford said that the Sixth Amendment right to
confrontation is bedrock. It didn't say that that
decision altered our understanding of the bedrock
procedural elements essential to a fair trial. That is
the standard. Not whether or not the Sixth Amendment is
bedrock.
In fact, if you look at the case of Gideon
versus Wainwright and Betts versus Brady, in Betts
versus Brady this Court had held the Sixth Amendment
right to counsel was not applicable to the states
through the 14th Amendment. Gideon overruled Betts
versus Brady and said that the Sixth Amendment right to
counsel was applicable to the states under the 14th
Amendment.
That alters our understanding of the bedrock
procedural elements that are essential to a fair trial.
In one case, we're saying rights of counsel is not one
of those bedrock procedural elements. Is not,
therefore, applicable to the states under the 14th
amendment, Betts versus Brady. In the next case we're
saying right to counsel is it implicit in the
Constitution. It is an essential to the fairness of a
proceeding, and it is therefore applicable to the states
under the 14th Amendment.
That truly alters our understanding of the
bedrock procedural elements that are essential to a fair
trial.
In contrast, when you look at Crawford
vis-a-vis Ohio versus Roberts, the -- there's a real
distinction there. In both cases, we know that the
right to confrontation is essential and Federal and one
of those bedrock elements that are essential to a fair
proceeding. Therefore Crawford doesn't alter our
understanding of what elements are or are not essential
to -- bedrock elements essential to a fair proceeding.
Instead it modifies the contours --
JUSTICE STEVENS: You make the same analysis
if you say the right is not necessarily the right of
confrontation but the narrower right of
cross-examination.
MR. CHANOS: Would I make the same analysis?
JUSTICE STEVENS: Because that is central to
Crawford.
MR. CHANOS: Yes. Yes. Crawford doesn't
tell us that the rights to confrontation or the right of
cross-examination is a new right as Gideon tells us.
Instead Crawford tells us --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, there is a new
emphasis on cross-examination.
MR. CHANOS: It alters, it modifies the
manner in which we implement that right. Under Ohio
versus Roberts there was plenty of cross-examination
that was occurring. The standard under Ohio versus
Roberts was unavailability and inadequate indicia of
reliability. There was a reliability screen in place,
and it was clear under Ohio versus Roberts that the
right to confrontation was an essential bedrock right,
essential to a fair trial.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Exactly. But you know, how
you play the game depends upon at what level of
generality you describe the right. And I agree with you
if you describe the right as the right to
cross-examination, that -- that was -- reinstituted by
Crawford, which said that the confrontation right is a
right to confrontation -- to cross-examination, which
didn't exist before. I mean, you could dispense with
that right of cross-examination if there were indicia of
reliability.
MR. CHANOS: Well, there were --
JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm not sure that you can
so -- in such a facile fashion decide what is a bedrock
principle. Frankly, I don't know any formula that
would -- that would describe it. I really think it is
a -- you know it when you see it.
MR. CHANOS: Well, Justice Scalia --
JUSTICE SCALIA: It is like obscenity.
(laughter.)
MR. CHANOS: I understand. The other point
that --
JUSTICE SOUTER: That gets, if you follow
Justice Scalia's argument, that gets you to, I think to
the argument you have made. And that is all right, we
have got to look at it pragmatically. I mean, what are
the consequences of following a reliability model rather
than a cross-examination model? And your argument is
consequences that are not necessarily more favorable to
defendants, in fact -- or more productive of ultimately
reliable determinations, in fact. And that I take it is
your basic point.
So I think you've answered what for all of
us is a problem. And that is we don't have a clear
analytical definition of bedrock; but if we look to
consequences, you have got an argument. Your friends
don't think it is a good one, but that's your point.
MR. CHANOS: The other point is that there's
a second component to watershed which is it must be a
rule without which the accuracy of a proceeding is
seriously diminished. There was cross-examination under
Ohio versus Roberts. There -- in Crawford, the language
of Crawford isn't a sweeping indictment of -- of
Roberts.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, there wasn't
cross-examination by defense counsel.
MR. CHANOS: I'm sorry?
JUSTICE KENNEDY: In this case there wasn't
cross-examination by defense counsel. Or am I
incorrect?
MR. CHANOS: There was cross-examination of
the mother, there was cross-examination of the police
detective -- there was cross-examination of --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Oh, oh. No, I mean of the
witness.
MR. CHANOS: Not of Autumn -- not of Autumn
Bockting. But the important point that I want to make
before I reserve the balance of my time is that the
question isn't simply, is Crawford accuracy-enhancing?
The question is is it a rule without which the accuracy
of a proceeding is seriously diminished. In other words
must all --
JUSTICE SOUTER: -- accuracy-enhancing then?
MR. CHANOS: I'm sorry?
JUSTICE SOUTER: It's a question about how
much more accuracy-enhancing, if at all?
MR. CHANOS: That, and it is really an
analysis of Roberts. Is, is that judicial determination
of reliability under adequate indicia of reliability, so
fundamentally flawed that all of the decisions that
were, that were arrived at pursuant to its authority
must be undone, and new trials must occur with respect
to those decisions because it is so fundamentally
flawed. And our point is that it is not. It does not
rise to that level of inadequacy and Crawford is
therefore not a rule without which the accuracy of a
proceeding is seriously diminished.
Mr. Chief Justice, may I reserve the balance
of my time?
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you General
Chanos.
Mr. Gornstein, we will hear now from you.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF IRVING L. GORNSTEIN, ON BEHALF OF
THE UNITED STATES AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING
PETITIONER
MR. GORNSTEIN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may
it please the Court.
Crawford does not satisfy either of the two
requirements for a retroactive watershed rule. The
application of Roberts rather than Crawford did not so
seriously diminish the likelihood of accurate
convictions as to require the wholesale reopening of
convictions that were final before Crawford was decided,
with all the societial costs that entails.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Since you barely
cite AEDPA, I think you assume we need to reach the
Teague question before the AEDPA question.
MR. GORNSTEIN: Mr. Chief Justice, we do not
have an interest in the AEDPA question because it does
not apply to Federal convictions, the 2254(d)(1), and
there is no Federal conviction analog to 2254(d)(1), so
we are not telling you that you should or should not
reach it. We just don't have an interest in that
question.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It is law that is
applied in Federal court, though. I assume you have an
interest in that.
MR. GORNSTEIN: Well, we have a general
interest in the way law is applied in Federal court but
we do not ordinarily opine on issues just on that basis
and we haven't in the past opined on AEDPA issues unless
they have some Federal analog carryover effect. And we
did not here.
Now with respect to the reliability prong of
the Teague analysis, there are three reasons that the
Roberts rule did not so seriously diminish the
likelihood of accurate convictions as to call for
retroactive application of Crawford.
The first is that Roberts had a built-in
reliability screen. Hearsay could not be admitted under
Roberts unless a determination was made that there were
particularized guarantees of trustworthiness.
The second reason that Roberts did not
seriously diminish the likelihood of accurate
convictions is that there were other procedural
components that operated in tandem with Roberts to
promote accuracy. They included the right to
cross-examine the witness through whom an hearsay
statement was introduced, the right to introduce your
own evidence to challenge the reliability of the hearsay
statement. Defense counsel could point out to the jury
all the weaknesses in the hearsay statement and the
defendant could count on the common sense of the jury to
weigh the reliability of the hearsay statement in light
of all the evidence in the case.
JUSTICE ALITO: Can't you make that argument
about any, about cross-examination in general? It is
debatable whether -- how good cross-examination is in
determining the truthfulness of a witness's testimony.
Now, our Constitution decides the issue one way, but any
infringement of cross-examination could be susceptible
to the same argument that you are making.
MR. GORNSTEIN: Yes. And I don't think that
this is a self-sufficient argument for that reason. It
is just one component of the argument about why there
was reliability. The fact that there was a Roberts
screen on reliability is an additional factor that
distinguishes my example from what you said.
And the fact is that there was a right to
cross-examine live witnesses here. So there was a right
to cross-examine the police officer through whom this
hearsay statement was made. It is not a case where
there was an across-the-board denial of any
cross-examination.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well I guess you're asking
us to say Crawford, get one, take one, it is really not
that important. If that's so, I suppose we shouldn't
have overruled Roberts.
MR. GORNSTEIN: No, I think Crawford that is
an important decision. But if you made retroactive
every one of your important decisions, you would be
reversing the rule of Teague. What Teague says that is
there is not -- that the purposes of habeas corpus are
largely exhausted once somebody has received a trial in
accordance with then existing law.
Because of the importance of finality to the
system -- and there are only going to be two very --
there's only a very narrow window for watershed rules,
of rules that, the accuracy of proceedings beforehand
are so seriously diminished that there is an
unacceptably large risk that systematically, innocent
people were being convicted, and that this is a rule
that approaches Gideon in its fundamental and sweeping
importance. Those are the only circumstances in which
the Court is going to go back on finality.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: How many times have we
dealt with a quote, "new rule," with the argument made
that it was watershed and therefore should be
retroactive? This is not the first time.
MR. GORNSTEIN: No, I think that there have
been -- I don't know the exact number, but maybe 11 or
12, about half of which are ones, are proposed new rules
and half of which are ones where the rule was already
established previously and the question was whether it
was going to be made retroactive. And I cited in the
brief there are three or four death penalty cases where
the Court had already established before each one of
them there was a right not to be -- the death penalty to
be arbitrarily imposed. And in each case there was a
new rule that built on that basic rule in an important
way; but in each case, the Court said it was not the
kind of rule that was going to be applied retroactively.
And so, too, here.
The third reason I wanted to give about why
there was not a serious diminishment in accuracy that is
in at least one respect, the Roberts rule actually
promotes more accuracy than the Crawford rule, and
that's with respect to non-testimonial hearsay. In the
case of non-testimonial hearsay, under Roberts, that
could come in only if determination had been made there
were particularized guarantees of trustworthiness.
Whereas under the Crawford rule, that kind of
non-testimonial hearsay comes in without any reliability
check under the Constitution at all.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: But that's not this case.
MR. GORNSTEIN: Well there was actually in
this case the mother's testimony about what the daughter
said to her.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm talking about the
daughter's testimony.
MR. GORNSTEIN: Yes. The daughter's
testimony about what she said to the mother illustrates
the difference, because that came in through the mother.
It only came in because there was a particularized
guarantees of trustworthiness to that statement; whereas
under Crawford in future trials, statements to the
mother -- which are not testimonial -- they will come in
through the mother without any screen for reliability
under the Constitution at all. So in that respect, the
defendant here got more by virtue of the Roberts rule
than by -- than he would have had by virtue of the
Crawford rule.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Is that the case in Federal
courts, too?
MR. GORNSTEIN: Well, it is a matter of
interpreting -- what protection is left is only going to
be by virtue of the residual hearsay rule. So there
will have to be some determination made about whether
there are sufficient guarantees of trustworthiness.
JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, it is conceivable
that Federal courts would interpret the hearsay rule to
require precisely that anyway.
MR. GORNSTEIN: But Justice Scalia --
JUSTICE SCALIA: In which case you shouldn't
be making this argument because it applies only to state
courts.
MR. GORNSTEIN: No. I think it applies
equally to Federal courts because it is free to the
Federal court system to devise a rule that would allow a
looser standard of entry than the Roberts standards, and
if it did, that would be constitutional. So there is an
interest in that kind of argument in the Federal system.
I wanted to move on to the bedrock aspect of
the inquiry, which is a separate second inquiry that had
threshold that has to be crossed if you are going to
find something to be watershed, and the only rule that
the Court has found to be bedrock is Gideon. And this
rule, Carawford does not approach Gideon in its
fundamental and sweeping importance, and there are a
couple of reasons for that.
First, the right to counsel pervasively
affected all aspects of the criminal trial whereas this
focuses on one limited -- the admissibility of one
limited category of evidence, testimonial hearsay, and
adopts a somewhat new rule for that than had existed
before.
The second thing is that under, the right to
counsel is deemed so essential to a fair trial that
depriving someone of that right can never be discounted
as harmless error, whereas Crawford errors can be
harmless. There are a significant number of cases where
they are found to be harmless. So you cannot say that a
violation of the Crawford rule always and necessarily
results in an unfair trial, whereas you can say that
about the right to counsel.
Finally, the Gideon rule established for the
first time a right to free counsel in all felony
criminal trials. Before Crawford was established, there
was a right to cross-examine. It simply was a different
right. You had a right to cross-examine the live
witnesses and you had a right to screen out
uncross-examined statements unless they met the
reliability standard of Roberts. And the change that
was made was one in which the Roberts rule was thrown
out, and you can no longer get in uncross-examined
statements with a determination of reliability.
But that is a modification or an incremental
change in an existing right that previously existed to
cross-examine, and instead -- unlike the Gideon rule,
which established the right to counsel for the first
time.
If the Court has nothing further.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,
Mr. Gornstein.
Ms. Forsman?
ORAL ARGUMENT OF FRANCES A. FORSMAN
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MS. FORSMAN: Thank you very much, Mr. Chief
Justice. Members of the Court:
This man was sentenced to life in prison
based upon accusations that have never been tested by
the only constitutionally reliable test that is now
acceptable in this Court. There is no question that the
statements that were admitted through the police officer
were testimonial. There is no question that if
Mr. Bockting were tried today, that those statements
would not have come in.
The government has argued that the
reliability screen, so-called, that came from Roberts
was sufficient, and it was only an incremental change
when the Crawford decision was decided. The fact of the
matter is that this Court found that the reliability
screen that the government has discussed was
fundamentally flawed.
And in this case, comparing the right to
counsel to the right to cross-examination is easy. It
is easy because it would not have mattered how many
lawyers Mr. Bockting had. It would not have mattered if
he had the finest lawyers in the country. It would not
have mattered if he was Duke Power Company and had every
lawyer at the highest hourly rate representing him. If
he was unable to cross-examine his accuser, just as in
Crawford -- in Crawford, there was even an audiotape of
what the wife said. There was an audiotape. There was
a police officer who listened to what she said. And
this Court found that wasn't good enough.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, we didn't say in
Crawford, I don't think we said in Crawford -- I ought
to know, I suppose.
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE SCALIA: -- that the new rule
produced greater accuracy. We said that it was the view
of the framers of the Constitution that
cross-examination, confrontation in that sense, was
necessary for greater accuracy.
Now in our evaluation of what constitutes a
landmark decision, are we bound to the framers' view of
things? I mean, you know, maybe -- I'm not sure that if
you apply a proper interpretation of indicia of
reliability under Roberts, I'm really not sure whether
it wouldn't be more accurate than confrontation, but
that wouldn't matter to me, because confrontation is
what the Constitution required and what the framers
thought were necessary.
Am I bound, for purposes of the rule we're
arguing about here, to what the framers think?
MS. FORSMAN: No, Your Honor, you are not
bound to what the framers think. However, I think that
you went far beyond simply saying that this was like
quartering soldiers in discussing the confrontation
clause and the right to confrontation. The opinion goes
into at length why the Roberts rule was so fundamentally
flawed. You talked about the kinds of decisions that
were produced, although this Court said that this Court
had pretty much tacked to the same direction as the
framers' view.
JUSTICE SCALIA: I think that discussion of
the, you know, the contrary decisions that had been
produced under Roberts was just for the purpose of
justifying the overruling of a case that -- you know --
that was not that old. It hadn't worked out as well as
we maybe expected it would. But I don't think it was
for the purpose of showing that it always produces
unreliable results.
MS. FORSMAN: And I don't think that our
burden would to be show that it always produces
unreliable results. I think that this Court has clearly
taken the position that the only constitutional
reliability is the right to cross-examination. However,
throughout your retroactivity jurisprudence, you have
been able to distinguish easily between issues such as
the exclusionary rule, the right to a cross-section of
the community on a jury, and the right to
cross-examination. I would point out to you, the
decisions that made Bruton, for instance, retroactive,
because the right to cross-examination went so directly
to the integrity of the fact-finding process.
I think that one of the major difficulties
in the argument being taken by the State --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: That's in an instruction,
like Toomey versus Ohio. The judge is corrupt. It is
just structural. You can't say that about Crawford, or
can you?
MS. FORSMAN: I don't mean to say, Your
Honor, that it is structural. I think the issue of
whether something is structural error or harmless error
has to do with whether or not it is measurable, not
whether it's bedrock, not whether it's watershed, not
whether it leads to better accuracy.
We know that, because in Teague, although
Gideon was the only case explicitly referenced, there
was also three other examples mentioned in Teague.
There was a trial tainted by mob violence. There was a
trial flawed because of the intentional introduction of
perjured testimony. And there was a trial flawed by the
introduction of testimony with regard to a coerced
confession.
We know that two out of those three examples
are actually subject to harmless error analysis. So
this Court has never tied the issue of the elements of
Teague or even the elements of the pre-Teague
jurisprudence to the issue of whether something is
structural or harmless. It is the issue, as it was in
the more recent decision of Gonzalez-Lopez, of the right
to choice of counsel decision. They are what the Court
looked to to determine the issue was, is it harmless, is
it quantifiable. And in this case, courts are
accustomed, appellate courts are accustomed to looking
at the introduction of this kind of evidence and
determining whether or not it is harmless.
The State has not taken a position before
this Court that the Ninth Circuit was erroneous in
determining that this evidence was prejudicial, and
therefore affected the outcome.
So the issue of accuracy as defined by the
State and by the government, the problem with that
argument and the easiest way to see the problem in that
argument is if you look to Gideon. Certainly we
wouldn't argue that the insertion of counsel into a case
may not result in what the State is defining as a more
accurate result. The insertion of counsel into a case
may well cause the exclusion of evidence. In fact, in
many instances that is exactly what counsel does.
So their definition of accuracy if applied
to the Gideon case would mean that Gideon would flunk
that definition, and wouldn't be the case that has been
so repeatedly referenced by this Court as an example of
the kind of case that should be made retroactive.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Ms. Forsman, what about
the cases we're had so far on this second Teague
category? As far as I know -- well, we haven't found
anything to be retroactive on collateral review so far,
so this would be the first time.
MS. FORSMAN: It would be, Your Honor, and
it is appropriate that this be the first time. As I
previously referenced, those cases fell -- there are 12
of them, by the way. There were 12 decisions post
Teague applying the Teague analysis in which this Court
did not find retroactivity. The Solicitor General is
correct. Some of those were cases in which on
collateral review, the petitioner was seeking to
actually create a new rule and apply it retroactively.
But if we look to cases such as the
retroactivity application of Batson, for instance, what
this Court has found is that the Batson rule, the
cross-section of the community on a jury, that the
purpose of that rule was not created for the purpose of
protecting against unjust convictions or ensuring the
integrity of the fact-finding process. That was not the
purpose of the Batson rule, this Court found that it
wasn't the purpose of the Batson rule, and that
therefore, it would not fall under the Teague exception.
That is not so when you talk about the
purpose of the cross-examination rule.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: What about the decision
that said Ring v. Arizona was not retroactive on
collateral?
MS. FORSMAN: Again, in Schriro versus
Summerlin, the issue there was an issue with regard to
ultimate accuracy of a jury versus a judge. Again, this
Court found that the evidence was -- the evidence was
equivocal with regard to whether or not a judge findings
or jury findings were more accurate.
Now you might say, well, that sounds a
little bit like Roberts. The problem with that is that
it isn't like Roberts, because under Roberts, the
cross-examination right, which is something that we held
so dear and connected so directly to the right to
counsel, having counsel without the right to
cross-examination, isn't much of a right.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: The problem with your
case -- maybe it's our problem because it was our
rule -- is that we're asked to adopt an across-the-board
calculus as to the rule. In some cases, as I think you
will have to concede, under the Roberts jurisprudence,
the fact finding was more accurate.
In your case, what you are telling us is
that the fact finding is far less accurate. But I think
you are stuck unless you can give us some reason that we
depart with it. With a rule-made jurisprudence, we have
to look at the rule in the whole universe of cases, not
just your case. It seems to me that was the problem you
had in arguing in this area, and maybe you can suggest
some way out. I don't see it.
MS. FORSMAN: I can, Your Honor. The reason
that I can is that the judge does not have the ability
to see the cross-examination statement either. So if we
start with the premise, when making this reliability
determination, we would have to throw out all of the
statements in Crawford and all of the previous cases
which hold so dear the right to cross-examination and
say, but a judge can make a reliability determination
without ever hearing the statements cross-examined, can
make them in that vacuum without ever testing the
reliability of the statements with the -- with
cross-examination.
And I don't know how you would be able to
square that with the strong statements that are made in
Crawford. And the strong statements that are made in
the cases, for instance, in the case finding that Bruton
should be retroactive, because it goes to the integrity
of the fact- finding process. Unlike all of the other
cases that you've talked about since Teague, the
integrity of the fact-finding process is what is at
issue here. Do you have confidence in a result which is
based upon an accuser's statements being admitted
without ever having been cross-examined?
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But Ohio versus
Roberts was not overruled because of a judgment that it
was not doing a good enough job in assessing reliability
of these statements. It was overruled because of a
judgment that the Founders wanted there to be
cross-examination.
MS. FORSMAN: That's -- Your Honor, that is
the base of the decision. It harkens back to what the
Founders believed. However, the rule in Roberts was
described variously from "amorphous to unpredictable,
proof manipulable," to saying that the basis for the
right to confrontation and cross-examination comes from
a basic mistrust of, even to the levels of a judge in
terms of accepting the testimony without the advantage
of an actual adversary proceeding.
This case, of course, illustrates the dire
need for cross-examination because the accuser in this
case testified inconsistently at the preliminary hearing
in this case and then was excused before
cross-examination was allowed. The accuser in this
case, who was sent to a counselor by the district
attorney, when she went to the counselor refused to
knowledge that the incident happened, according to the
testimony of the counselor.
And because the court -- and the record is
very scant on what happened here -- the court, the trial
court for instance, under Roberts made only a couple of
findings and he said the testimony was consistent -- he
didn't look at the fact that it had been inconsistent on
at least two other occasions -- and said it was
chronological, at least according to what the police
officer said.
And so there were only a couple of findings
by the trial court at all with respect to --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You had the
opportunity to challenge those findings under the
Roberts regime in state court?
MS. FORSMAN: We did. We did, and that --
and that issue was not reached by the Ninth Circuit
because after we had argued the case in the Ninth
Circuit the Crawford decision was decided; and it was at
that point that the Ninth Circuit picked up on the
Crawford, and they didn't decide the issue of whether or
not Roberts would have meant that this testimony was
unreliable anyway.
JUSTICE BREYER: You can still argue -- what
hearsay exception did it come in under?
MS. FORSMAN: It came in under a Nevada
statute which was patterned after Roberts. It came in
under a Nevada statute --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Adequate indicia of
reliability.
JUSTICE BREYER: Adequate indicia of
reliability?
MS. FORSMAN: Yes, adequate -- basically,
indicia of reliability. It didn't go into -- it didn't
go into too much more detail than that. It just simply
required that, a witness under ten, the court must find
that the, that the statement is reliable and the
statements are reliable, and then --
JUSTICE BREYER: Is that universal in
Nevada? I mean, is they are no more hearsay rule in
Nevada, that you just evaluate hearsay straight out in
every case?
MS. FORSMAN: No. No. That was a statute
that was adopted specifically for child witnesses.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: This is for children
under ten, isn't it?
MS. FORSMAN: Children under ten.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: As you just said.
MS. FORSMAN: That's correct.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: And here we had someone
who was six years old and was hardly articulate, it
seems from the little we have of this record. So the
Nevada statute I think was very specific to children and
was not --
MS. FORSMAN: It was. Yes, yes. No, it
was. It was adopted for witnesses under ten. This
child actually was quite articulate in the preliminary
hearing and was able -- was able to talk about the fact
that she remembered talking to the police officer, that
she remembered -- but then, but then in terms of trying
to recall the incident, she was unable to recall the
incident, and she was unable to recall it in any of the
same detail that the police officer testified to.
So it wasn't -- you know, it wasn't a
circumstance in which you had a child who simply
couldn't speak or a child who couldn't describe what had
occurred.
JUSTICE BREYER: So if you lose this case,
you can go back to the Ninth Circuit and say, well, even
under Roberts it shouldn't have come in?
MS. FORSMAN: I believe that's correct, Your
Honor, because the Ninth Circuit did not reach that
issue.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Would you comment,
Ms. Forsman, on your opponent's argument based on
2254(d)?
MS. FORSMAN: Yes. I think the easiest way
to explain our position on that is that what has been
articulated here is that a retroactive -- a rule made
retroactive by this court would be applicable to
Mr. Bockting if he had not raised this issue or had been
somehow procedurally defaulted along the way. In other
words, in order to be able to get the advantage that was
discussed by both the state and the government of the
other sections of the statute which clearly recognize,
as to the extent that it's relevant the sponsor of the
legislation did, that you still have the power to make
rules retroactive, but the only way that Mr. Bockting
would be able to get advantage of that rule would be if
the state court had never ruled on the merits of his
claim or had made some sort of procedural ruling that
meant that he was defaulted on the claim. So instead of
Mr. Bockting, who has raised this question of being able
to cross-examine his accuser from day one in the trial,
he cannot have that rule applied retroactively to him.
If instead he now, he goes back later and the court
says, no, this is a successor petition, you can't, you
can't get it, you can't come into our courtroom, the
door is slammed on you, according to the state now
there's no ruling on the merits of his claim, and that's
why that section of the statute would permit the
retroactive rule to apply.
2254(d)(1), while it has the language
clearly established, and the court asked some questions
about that, I think it must be remembered that when that
statute is being addressed, it's being addressed in
state court -- or in Federal court, on Federal habeas.
And so at the time that the petitioner is in Federal
court, then the rule has been clearly established.
The 2254(d) --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's not -- the
state has to result -- the state -- it's adjudicated on
the merits in state court and results in a decision that
was contrary to clearly established Federal law.
MS. FORSMAN: Correct.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So it seems to me
that the question is what was the law, what was the
clearly established law at the time of the state
decision.
MS. FORSMAN: 2254(d)(1), I think the only
way that you can read that section compatibly with the
four other sections which are quoted in our appendix 2
of our brief, the only way that you can do that is to
recognize, although this Court will recall that it has
described AEDPA as not quite a silk purse of legislative
drafting, but the only way to make those sections
compatible is to say, listen, what was going on when
2254(d)(1) was written was we were talking not about the
timing of the new rule, what we were talking about is
who is it decided by, because before AEDPA was adopted
it wasn't apparent that it must be a decision by you, by
this Court, that established by the rule. So that's the
first part.
And the second part is that it's not dicta.
It is an actual holding of this Court that is to be
looked to to determine whether or not the state court
was wrong. And so the only way to read that is to say,
listen, there has to be some meaning to retroactivity,
and what does retroactivity mean? Retroactivity means
like a nunc pro tunc order, that when you've determined
that a new rule is retroactively applicable -- and
certainly between AEDPA and the Teague exceptions, which
you did say in Horn versus Banks, by the way, should be
analyzed differently -- although it has not been tossed
up to you directly as it has in this case, the meaning
of the 2254(d)(1), you have repeatedly advised that
Teague is still alive and well and that when you look to
the application of whether a rule should be applied
retroactively you look to the Teague exceptions, so we
also look --
JUSTICE ALITO: Is there any language in
2254(d) that could incorporate the Teague exceptions?
MS. FORSMAN: There is not language in
2254(d)(1). The language -- the reason that we know
that Congress was cognizant of Teague is that there is
language throughout AEDPA, particularly in the sections
that we've quoted to you, that are lifted directly from
Teague.
JUSTICE ALITO: What would we say if we were
to say that 2254(d)(1) accommodates the Teague
exceptions, that Congress meant to put them in but just
forgot to do it? How would we account for the language?
MS. FORSMAN: I think that what you would
say is that
Congress would not have deprived you of the power to
make a rule retroactively applicable and would have not
then created the ludicrous situation which the state
suggests would occur here, which is instead of the
motivation in Congress in having someone like
Mr. Bockting raise the issue from the very beginning in
one unitary proceeding, as opposed to going back, which
is what they've suggested he must do in order to get the
advantage of a retroactive rule, is that Congress was
cognizant of that and in order to make all of the
statute -- all of the provisions of the statute have
meaning and not render certain provisions, including the
sections that we quoted, superfluous, that you must
interpret that to mean that the -- that the -- that
2254(d)(1) is not a timing statute. It's what law do we
look to. That must be what they meant. Otherwise, the
rest of it just doesn't make any sense.
JUSTICE ALITO: Isn't that making the tail
wag the dog, because there's language in the provisions
on successive petitions that refers to Teague, that you
would read the Teague exceptions into 2254(d)(1) when
there's nothing in the language there that can be
interpreted to refer to them?
MS. FORSMAN: No. I don't believe that's
the tail wagging the dog, because I don't think that
that was the intent of 2254(d)(1). I think the
intent -- again, I think the intent of 2254(d)(1) was in
order to define what kinds of decisions the state court
decisions should be measured against. There must be
some kind of meaning to retroactivity, and retroactivity
means that you are making this decision now and you're
making it retroactive to the time. It is not going to
be many things, as we know not only from your decisions,
but as we know from the very small core of decisions
that Teague left open. And it is those decisions where
we must worry whether or not an innocent man has been
convicted. It is those rules that protect against
those -- an unjust, an unwarranted, a wrongful
conviction. It is only those rules that go to
reliability, that go to the integrity of the
fact-finding process, that you are going to let through
that veil.
So if it is only that small core of rules
that you reserved in Teague, only that small core of
rules, and we know it won't be many at this point, then
if you read that compatibly with AEDPA, it is not and,
as we know, it is not going to open the floodgates.
There is a very defined period of time in which people
can bring actions for relief. Under your Dodd decision
decision, there is only one year, not from the time that
you make -- if you were to make, for instance, this
decision retroactive, not from today, but it is one year
from Crawford that petitioners have the opportunity to
be able to come into court within that statute of
limitations with regard to the date on which a new rule
is adopted.
It is from that date forward. So there is a
defined population. In appendix 1 of our brief, you
will see all of the decisions that we could find that
have actually applied Crawford and there were 49 of
them. And what you'll find is that of the decisions --
and the state and the government have not disputed
this -- of the 49 decisions which we were able to find
at the time of the writing of that brief, only five
actually resulted in relief. There's no question it
would result in relief here because there is no
contention before you that the Ninth Circuit's
determination of harmfulness -- there is no
determination before you; they haven't challenged that
to you.
So it would result in relief for
Mr. Bockting. But because it's harmless error or it's
not testimonial or there was a previous opportunity to
cross-examine, of the 49 decisions only 5 were found to
have to result in relief.
And that is as it should be. The state
argues that watersheddedness, if that's a word, is that
watersheddedness must mean that it affects many, many
decisions. Now, that can't mean what Teague means.
Teague can't mean that my burden is to show you that
many decisions will be overturned. That's the exact
opposite of what Teague was decided for.
Watersheddedness has to do with the
alteration of our understanding. It is difficult for me
to understand how the change of course as described by
then Chief Justice Rehnquist, that the change of course
that Crawford represented in the way that we look at the
right to confrontation cannot be, cannot be seen as
precisely the alteration in the understanding of this
bedrock principle again directly from the language of
Crawford.
We ask you, Your Honors, to make the rule of
Crawford retroactive and to affirm the determination of
the Ninth Circuit.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Ms. Forsman, can I ask you
a personal question? Were you a moot court finalist?
(Laughter.)
MS. FORSMAN: I was not.
JUSTICE STEVENS: I attend a moot court at
Notre Dame in about your year and it was an awfully good
moot court.
MS. FORSMAN: Thank you, Your Honor.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Ms.
Forsman.
General Chanos, you have two minutes
remaining.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF GEORGE J. CHANOS
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. CHANOS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.
I only have a few points.
First of all, counsel's argument with regard
to the interpretation of 2254(d)(1) clearly established
language is inconsistent with the statement made --
statements made by this Court in Lockyer and in Williams
v. Taylor. In Lockyer, the Court stated Section
2254(d)(1)'s clearly established phase referred to the
holdings, as opposed to the dicta, of this Court's
decisions as of the time of the relevant state court
decision, citing Williams v. Taylor. In other words,
clearly established federal law under 2254(d)(1) is the
governing legal principle or principles set forth by the
Supreme Court at the time the state court renders its
decision.
With regard to counsel's point about
this case in particular, Bockting, I agree that there
are broader issues beyond this particular fact
situation. However, I want the Court to feel
comfortable that when this Court sent this case back
down to the Nevada Supreme Court and told the Nevada
Supreme Court to follow Ohio -- Idaho versus Wright, the
factors in Idaho versus Wright to determine
trustworthiness, talk about spontaneity and consistent
reputation -- repetition, mental state of declarant, use
of terminology unexpected of a child of similar age, and
lack of motive to fabricate. Particularized guarantees
of trustworthiness must be so trustworthy that
adversarial testing would add little to its reliability.
Following that admonishment from this Court,
the Nevada Supreme Court found those statements to be
reliable and to satisfy the standards of Ohio -- Idaho
versus Wright.
Finally, I would just point out that
although Caldwell is indeed an important rule, and may,
in fact, be a fundamental rule, so was Batson in Teague,
as was Caldwell in Sawyer, as was Ring in Summerlin, as
was Duncan in DiStefano as was Mills in Banks. Yet this
Court failed to apply retroactive status to any of those
important fundamental rules saying none of them rose to
the level of Gideon versus Wainwright. The same should
be true with your decision here with respect to
Crawford.
Finally, as Justice Harlan stated in the
case of McKay, talking about where this Court's
retroactivity jurisprudence has come from, no one,
not --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You can finish your
sentence.
MR. CHANOS: Thank you.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Particularly if it
is Justice Harlan you're quoting.
(Laughter.)
MR. CHANOS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.
No one, not criminal defendants, not the judicial
system, not society as a whole is benefitted by a
judgment providing that a man shall tentatively go to
jail today, but tomorrow and every day thereafter his
continued incarceration shall be subject to fresh
litigation on issues already resolved.
Thank you.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, General.
The case is submitted.
