BUCHANAN,\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. BUCHANAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe issue here is whether a common law claim\nthat Mazda should have equipped Mrs. Williamson's\nseating position with a lap/shoulder belt is impliedly\npreempted under the rationale of Geier v. American\nHonda. The claim is not preempted, because it is\nperfectly consistent with and would not frustrate the\nobjectives of the operative 1989 version of Standard 208\ngoverning Type 2 seatbelts in rear seats.\nOne point that is clear from this Court's\nexpress preemption holding in Geier is that Congress\nintended common law to play a complementary role in\nachieving the objectives of the Motor Vehicle Safety\nAct.\nBased on the savings clause, the Court\ndecided that Congress intended to preserve a significant\nrole for State tort law to operate in compensating\naccident victims and promoting greater safety in vehicle\ndesign. And, on the issue of implied obstacle\npreemption, the majority also agreed with the dissent\nthat State common law will not be preempted unless there\nis clear evidence of a conflict with Federal objectives.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why would -- why would the\nFederal Government do that? I mean, trust juries to\nsupplement whatever -- whatever the Federal rules are,\nbut not permit State agencies who -- who studied the\nmatter with experts, to supplement what the Federal\nrules are?\nMR. BUCHANAN: Justice Scalia -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why does that make any\nsense, to just say, oh, you know, we -- we don't want\nthe State mucking around in this area, but of course\njuries can do so? Why does that make any sense?\nMR. BUCHANAN: Justice Scalia, I think the\nCourt answered the question in Sprietsma when it said\ncommon law has an important role to play in providing\ncompensation to victims. And therefore the Court found\nit rational in Sprietsma to make that distinction; and\nultimately it's a -- it's a judgment call for Congress\nto make.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't -- I don't doubt\nthey made it. I'm just curious as to why it could\npossibly have been?\nMR. BUCHANAN: Well -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Unless I -- unless lawyers\nbring suits before -- before juries, maybe.\nMR. BUCHANAN: Well, Justice Scalia, I\nbelieve common law has an important role to play, not\nonly in compensating victims but also in providing\nmanufacturers with an incentive to develop safer\nvehicles, even safer than the Federal minimum standards.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I thought the reason\nthat the Solicitor General gives for not -- that NHTSA\ndid not immediately require the type 2 seatbelt is\nbecause the costs would have been higher. Is that your\nunderstanding?\nMR. BUCHANAN: Mr. Chief Justice, for the\naisle seating position that we are talking about in this\ncase, the reason NHTSA decided not to mandate it\nimmediately was, A, a concern about obstructing the\naisleway with the shoulder belt; and B, a concern, yes,\nabout the cost of a possible alternative design.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How come allowing -\nor why doesn't allowing the relief you seek under State\nlaw impose those same costs, contrary to NHTSA's\nobjective in not making those mandatory?\nMR. BUCHANAN: Well, Your Honor, any time\nNHTSA creates a safety standard it necessarily takes\ninto account costs and benefits and the safety\nattributes. So -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And a State tort\naction does not?\nMR. BUCHANAN: A State tort action does.\nWhat I'm trying to -- the point I'm trying to make,\nMr. Chief Justice, is that if that were sufficient to\npreempt, then any minimum standard that NHTSA creates\nwould therefore preempt State law and it would nullify\nthe savings clause.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I suppose -- I\nunderstand the argument. I'm not sure it's right,\nthough, in the sense that NHTSA may decide not to make\nparticular standards mandatory for reasons other than\ncost. It may decide it doesn't think the technology is\nadequately developed. It may decide that it doesn't\nthink there are adequate, you know, mechanics prepared\nor involved.\nBut here it's because of the cost, and the\nrelief you are seeking it seems to me directly imposes\nthe costs that NHTSA decided not to require.\nMR. BUCHANAN: Well, NHTSA made a decision\nas of 1989 that the technology -- it obviously had\nconcerns about the technology and costs. But any type\nof -- of consideration of technology and costs is as of\nthat moment in time, and the agency specifically\nencouraged manufacturers to install Type 2 lap/shoulder\nbelts in these types of seating positions. And our\nlawsuit is perfectly consistent with the agency's\nobjective of encouraging lap/shoulder belts in these\nseating positions. By 1993 -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, every -- there\nis no objective that the government pursues regardless\nof cost. I understand that their objective was to\nencourage this, but it was clearly not to impose it,\nbecause it thought at that time that the costs were too\ngreat. So to simply say their objective was to get\nthese in ignores the other side of the cost/benefit\nanalysis.\nMR. BUCHANAN: Well, I think what the agency\ndid with respect to these seating positions in 1989 is\nit, A, it recognized that there were tremendous safety\nbenefits for Type 2 lap/shoulder belts. And yes, it\nfound enough countervailing considerations in terms of\ncost and feasibility not to mandate that as part of the\nFederal minimum standard. And so from the Federal\nGovernment's perspective, for these seating positions,\nthe government was neutral as between Type 1 and Type 2\nbelts.\nEither one of those belts would have\nsufficed to satisfy the Federal agency's objectives.\nAnd therefore a State law claim that eliminates\neffectively one of those options does not in any way\nfrustrate the agency's objectives. The government has\nexplained in its brief that its objectives would have\nbeen fully satisfied if all car manufacturers had\ninstalled Type 2 lap/shoulder belts immediately.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why is that different from\nGeier? Didn't the automobile manufacturer in Geier -\nwasn't -- weren't the manufacturers similarly left to\ndo, choose for themselves whether to have one type of\nconstraint or another?\nMR. BUCHANAN: They were, Justice Scalia,\nbut the Court's decision in Geier did not turn on the\nmere fact that the manufacturers had a choice, and Mazda\nis not asserting that claim here either. The\ndeterminative agency policy at issue in Geier was that\nthe agency deliberately sought a variety of different\npassive restraint types. It was concerned about a\npublic backlash against airbags, and it wanted to\nencourage the development of alternative passive\nrestraint systems.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But you are saying that\nonce the government gives the manufacturer a choice,\nthen the jury -- the -- the tort system can second-guess\nit; and that is not consistent with a likely government\nintent to allow the manufacturers a choice based on the\ntechnical advances to that date.\nMR. BUCHANAN: Justice Kennedy, I don't\nthink that the government gave manufacturers a choice.\nIt gave them two different options for complying with a\nminimum standard; but it didn't suggest that foreclosing\none of those options would in any way frustrate its\nobjectives. It didn't suggest that it thought State -\nthat there should be some -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, suppose the\ngovernment says you have a choice and the State of Iowa\npasses a law and says you don't have a choice. No\nfrustration of the governmental purpose there?\nMR. BUCHANAN: It depends what the reason\nfor the choice is, Justice Kennedy.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: No, there's just -- just\nthe statutes as I have given them to you. That there -\nis there preemption just on the face of the statute?\nMR. BUCHANAN: Not if it's a -- not if it's\njust simply creating a minimum standard. There is no\npreemption.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: That's what the statute\ncalls for, minimum.\nMR. BUCHANAN: Yes, that's -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: That the agency is to set\nminimum standards. And then I take it that the Court in\nGeier says it wasn't -- it wasn't a minimum standard,\nbecause if a State deviated from it, it would detract;\nit would be an obstacle to the realization of the\nFederal standard.\nBut here the -- a minimum standard was\nadopted, minimal standard, and I think the agency is\ntelling us just the opposite of what it said in Geier;\nright?\nMR. BUCHANAN: Exactly correct, Justice\nGinsberg. In Geier the agency was the entity putting\nforward the theory of exemption, that this claim by\nGeier that all Honda vehicles should have been equipped\nwith airbags, frustrated its intent to accomplish a\nwhole variety or mix of passive restraint devices.\nIt was a direct conflict with the agency's\nobjectives. Here, the agency is telling us the exact\nopposite. It was not trying to further choice or\nvariety. It was not trying to maintain a diversity of\nType 1 and Type 2 seatbelts in rear seating positions.\nIts objective was to obtain the greater safety benefits\nof Type 2 seatbelts.\nThe agency found that Type 2 seatbelts were\nmore effective in preventing fatalities and serious\ninjuries, that they offered greater overall protection\nfor children, and, most fundamentally, that they\nactually increased seatbelt usage in rear seating\npositions.\nOur common law theory seeks to obtain all\nthose exact same safety benefits for aisle seating\npositions. And we know by 1993, when this vehicle was\nmanufactured, at least one major manufacturer, GM, was\nin fact installing Type 2 lap/shoulder belts in aisle\nseating positions. Our complaint alleges that it was\nperfectly feasible for Mazda to do so in 1993 when it\nmanufactured this vehicle, and that it was unreasonable\nnot to do so, and that's the important -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Of course, your theory is,\nif I understand your case -- correct me if I am wrong -\nif GM had installed Type 2, they could have been sued on\nthe theory that Type 1 was better and there would have\nbeen no preemption.\nMR. BUCHANAN: I think that would be a much\nmore difficult case, Justice Kennedy, but -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But under the theory of\nyour case, that suit could go forward.\nMR. BUCHANAN: That's correct.\nTheoretically, that suit could move forward. But the\nquestion that the Supremacy Clause asks is not whether\nhypothetically, there might be future conflicting jury\nverdicts. The question is: Does our claim here that we\nare asserting under California State law conflict with\nthe Federal objectives? It does not. The agency has\ntold us it does not.\nThere is nothing in the contemporaneous\nregulatory history of the Type 2 seatbelt rule that -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if the rule\nhere had another provision that said you must have\nType 1? You can have Type 2 -\nMR. BUCHANAN: Cannot?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You can have Type 2,\nright? But we are not requiring Type 2, because we\nthink the costs on manufacturers would be too great. We\nmay require it in the future, but not now.\nIs it the same? Is your position the same?\nMR. BUCHANAN: My position would be the\nsame. There is no preemption there.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, doesn't the -\ndoesn't the increased costs that are imposed by the tort\nliability conflict with NHTSA's determination in my\nhypothetical that they're not requiring Type 2 because\nof the cost?\nMR. BUCHANAN: Your Honor, any time the\nagency considers costs, it is at a particular moment in\ntime. It is not necessarily a determination that for\nall the future, this should never be done and no State\nlaw should ever mandate that it be done.\nAnd that's -- what we have here is not only\na determination that there were cost issues, but an\naffirmative encouragement to manufacturers to do what\nour State -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, then, if the\nregulation comes out July 1, you say there is a\npreemption until midnight July 1, but as of July 2 there\ncould be a suit?\nMR. BUCHANAN: I think there was never\npreemption under this regulation.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I think what you are\nsaying -- the statute says \"minimal standards\" and the\nagency says \"no obstacle,\" and that's it, that if there\nis a preemptive force to the -- to the safety standards,\nthat it is for the government to say that.\nMR. BUCHANAN: Correct, Justice Ginsburg.\nAnd not only does it say \"minimum standards,\" it\nexplicitly says in the savings clause that mere\ncompliance with a motor vehicle safety standard shall\nnot exempt the manufacturer from common law liability.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, it said all\nthose thing in Geier, too, didn't it?\nMR. BUCHANAN: It did. But again, the key\ndispositive fact in Geier was the agency's desire to\nachieve a variety of different passive restraint\ndevices, and a claim that the entire Honda fleet should\nhave had airbags would directly conflict with that.\nThat was the dispositive fact in this Court's decision\nin Geier, and that is what is lacking here. And what we\nhave here is much more -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Your judgment here doesn't\napply to the entire Mazda fleet, supposedly, right?\nJust to the car that caused harm to the plaintiff?\nMR. BUCHANAN: No, that's not correct,\nJustice Scalia. It's not a matter of whether it's the\nentire fleet or not. It's a matter of whether the\ncommon law claim conflicts with the Federal objective.\nAnd in Geier, it conflicted, because the objective was\nvariety.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What about the next case?\nLet's assume a similar case. Is that jury bound to come\nout the same way as to whether there should have been a\nshoulder constraint or not?\nMR. BUCHANAN: No, Justice Scalia, and\nthat's something that the Court in Geier contemplated\nand discussed. The Court in Geier acknowledged that -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Geier came out against you.\nWhy are you appealing to Geier?\nMR. BUCHANAN: It came out -- I don't -- I\nthink Geier fully supports us, Justice Scalia. And\ncertainly on the express preemption issue, the Court\nacknowledged the possibility that there could be\nconflicting results, inconsistent jury verdicts, which\nis always -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Why are we looking to\nGeier when you have a statute that says common law\nremedies are safe? I mean, as long as it says that -\nmaybe it didn't make a whole lot of sense, but they did\nit.\nMR. BUCHANAN: I agree with you, Justice\nGinsburg. But I think Geier also says that. Geier\nrelies on the savings clause to say that there's a\nsignificant role for common law actions to play. And\nspecifically with regard to the possibility of\ninconsistent jury verdicts, the Court in Geier said the\npossible -- the possibility of nonuniformity, the\nSavings Clause reflects a congressional determination\nthat that's a small price to pay for a system where\njuries create and enforce safety standards and\nsimultaneously provide compensation to victims. So I\nthink that's something the Court considered in Geier.\nI would like to reserve the rest of my time\nfor rebuttal, please.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Jay.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM M. JAY,\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,\nSUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS\nMR. JAY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nRespondents chose to comply with the Federal\nminimum safety standard by installing a Type 1 seatbelt,\nbut the savings clause makes clear that they are not\nexempted from the consequences of that choice under\nState common law when that choice results in injury.\nThey must show that, as Geier makes clear, that the\nState law rule of decision would pose a conflict with an\narticulable Federal policy. They haven't shown that\nhere.\nI would like to go first to the question the\nChief Justice asked my friend Mr. Buchanan about cost\nbenefit analysis and the Federal judgment that at the\ntime the imposition of a national uniform Federal\nminimum standard of Type 2 seatbelts wasn't warranted at\nthese seating positions.\nSimply saying that, and I -- simply saying\nthat is not enough to establish that the Federal agency\nwished for the adoption of Type 2 seatbelts not to\nhappen. As Mr. Buchanan said, every Federal\nrulemaker -- certainly every NHTSA safety standard\nadoption must include -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No -- I agree with\nyou, it doesn't require. It doesn't support the\ninference that they did not want Type 2 seatbelts to\nhappen, to be used.\nIt does, in my hypothetical view, support\nthe inference that it didn't want to mandate Type 2\nseatbelts because it was worried, as you said in your\nbrief at page 9, about the cost. And yet its worries\nabout the cost, it seems to me, are overridden by the\nposition that State tort suits can go on for the absence\nof Type 2 seatbelts.\nMR. JAY: Well, of course the baseline is\nthat State tort suits can always go forward. And in\nthis case, the agency decided not to impose this\nnationwide mandate because of the tradeoff between costs\nand benefits.\nThe benefits were significant. Everyone\nrecognizes that. Everyone recognizes that Type 2\nseatbelts were better for -- better or at least\nequivalent for all categories of passengers, and I will\ncome back to that. But as far as the imposition of\ncosts go, NHTSA decided that it was not worth it at that\ntime for NHTSA to require that. That doesn't mean that\nNHTSA wanted to adopt the policy of freeing\nmanufacturers of -- of any obligation to incur those\ncosts, let alone that it wanted -- for example, if NHTSA\nhad thought that it would harm safety for manufacturers\nto spend that money on Type 2 seatbelts instead of\nsomething else, it could have said that.\nIn Geier, for example, the reason that the\nagency deliberately sought variety -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, it did say that\nearlier, didn't it?\nMR. JAY: I'm sorry, Justice Sotomayor?\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Earlier, it said that\nthere was difficulties with -- pre-1989, '82 or '84,\nthat there were difficulties with Type 2 belts and\nchildren's safety. So was this preempted in '82-'84 and\nnot preempted by '89?\nMR. JAY: No, Justice Sotomayor. It was not\npreempted at any time. What you're -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So what do you need for\nthe agency to say before Geier comes into effect? For\nthe lower courts, what's the minimum that lower courts\nmissed here in not -- in coming to the conclusion they\ndid in their application of Geier?\nMR. JAY: The contrast between this case and\nGeier is that this case, like Geier, involves options,\nbut it does not involve a Federal policy that the\nmanufacturer must remain free to choose among those\noptions as it sees fit. In Geier -\nJUSTICE ALITO: Mr. Jay -- I'm sorry.\nMR. JAY: I was going to say in Geier the\nmanufacturer -- the agency concluded that it would\ndisserve safety if automatic seatbelts and airbags were\nnot both on the market. There has been no such\ndetermination here either in 1984 or at any other time.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Isn't it true that for a\nperiod of 10 years the lower courts uniformly held that\nthere wasn't any preemption here? And if that's the\ncase, why didn't the Federal Government come forward at\nany point during that time and say that this is\npreempted?\nMR. JAY: Two responses, Justice Alito.\nFirst, the question presented here about Type 1 versus\nType 2 seatbelts has only been by decided by a couple of\nfederal courts of appeals, no states courts at last\nresort.\nSecond, on the more general question, why\ndoesn't NHTSA participate in these cases, NHTSA as a\nmatter of course does not usually participate in private\nparty litigation under State common law, even when that\nlitigation might touch on a State -- the interpretation\nof a Federal safety standard. And when the courts asked\nfor NHTSA's views, NHTSA generally responds, as this\nCourt asks for the government's views in this case and\nthe government responded. And I think if the Court were\nto look back to the first brief in a string of briefs\nthat the government has filed about these issues under\nthis act, the brief in Wood versus General Motors filed\nin 1990, you could predict the position that the\ngovernment would take in this case from that brief. The\ngovernment said in that case that options don't preempt,\nmerely because they are options. In most cases there\nwill be no federal policy that presents a conflict.\nThat case presented the case of the passive\nrestraint phase-in and there it was the rare\ncircumstance, as the Court later held in Geier, where\nthere was frustration of the Federal policy, but that's\nbecause the Federal policy was to encourage variety, not\njust for its own sake, but because variety would serve\nsafety. The roads would be measurably less safe if\nairbags were rushed into service.\nBy contrast, in this case NHTSA would have\nbeen perfectly happy if every manufacturer had installed\nType 2 seatbelts the day after the 1989 rulemaking. So\nthere was no conflict.\nAs far as the child safety concern to which\nJustice Sotomayor alluded, it is referred to in the 1984\ndenial of a request to impose the rule that later was\nimposed in 1989. The agency said that it had concerns\nabout how particular child seats, which at the time were\nanchored with a form of tether. And it said that it\nthought the continued use of tethered car seats was\nsomething that it chose to encourage rather than\nanchoring them with Type 2 seats.\nThe agency did not speak at all to whether\nType 2 versus Type 1 was better for child safety and the\nagency then answered that in the 1989 rulemaking. So\nfor adults Type 2 seatbelts are safer and they encourage\nseatbelt use because they are more popular. For\ninfants, the agency specifically asked whether Type 2\nseatbelts could be as efficacious as Type 1 seatbelts in\nholding an infant car seat in place. It concluded that\nthey could. That's set out at page 25 of our brief.\nAnd for toddlers, children who are too small to sit in a\nType 2 seatbelt without assistance, the agency\nrecommended booster seats. And if there was no booster\nseat the agency recommended that they not use the\nshoulder belt. Not that they detached the shoulder\nbelt. The agency indeed specifically rejected the idea\nthat the shoulder belt should be removed at page 47990\nof the notice of proposed rulemaking.\nJUSTICE ALITO: If the child were injured by\na Type 2 belt, would a suit based on that be preempted?\nMR. JAY: If the child were injured by the\nType 2 belt and the suit would be on the theory that a\nType 1 belt should have been installed?\nJUSTICE ALITO: Yes.\nMR. JAY: At the time, no, that lawsuit\nwould not have been preempted. Mr. Buchanan said that\nthat would be harder case and I think he said that\nbecause the agency was specifically encouraging Type 2\nseatbelts, and in this case Respondents can't show\nanything suggesting that the agency was encouraging Type\n1 seatbelts. So it might be a harder case for that\nreason, but at that time there were two ways of\ncomplying with the Federal minimum standard and the\nsavings clause provides that simply complying with the\nFederal standard does not preempt the operation of State\ncommon law.\nSo we discussed the child safety, the\nalleged child safety rationale. I want to say a word\nabout the idea that aisle seats were unsafe for the\ninstallation of these seatbelts. As Mr. Buchanan\nmentioned, the agency specifically encouraged the\ninstallation of those seats where it was feasible. It\nwas found to be feasible in 1991 by General Motors,\nwhich installed them. But another word about that,\nbecause Respondents have suggested that the chief\ncounsel of NHTSA has said in 1994 in a letter something\nfavorable to their position, and that letter is\nreproduced in the appendix to the Petitioner's reply\nbrief.\nI urge the Court to look at the entire\nletter and not the sentence that was excerpted several\ntimes in Respondents' brief. Because what the agency\nsaid was that, in response to someone who complained\nthat manufacturers were installing Type 2 seatbelts and\nthey said, the complainant said that makes these\nminivans unsafe because people will be trapped in the\nback seat. The agency said it disagreed, that people\ncould go under the safety belt, that they could detach\nthe safety belt, that the safety benefits of a Type 2\nseatbelt outweighed any convenience concern about access\nto or egress from the rear seat.\nAnd I think that is perfectly consistent\nwith the policy NHTSA has taken all along. Type 2\nseatbelts are safer, more effective and to be\nencouraged. When NHTSA decided not to mandate that\nbased on its understanding at the time of who used\nseatbelts, who used seatbelts in the rear center seats\nand what the -- how many fatalities and injuries would\nbe prevented and whether the dollar cost would be\njustified by -- by the dollar equivalent of injuries and\nfatalities prevented, it wasn't making a preemptive\njudgment that Type 2 seatbelts, therefore, should not be\ninstalled. And for that reason there is no frustration\nof anything that NHTSA had in mind in the 1989\nrulemaking by allowing this tort suit to proceed as\nsaved by the Savings Clause.\nJUSTICE ALITO: If we adopt your view, would\nGeier apply to any other regulation?\nMR. JAY: I don't think that Geier is good\nfor that day only. I do think, as we said in Geier and\nthe brief in Wood to which we alluded and so on, that\nGeier is the exceptional circumstance. That was, of\ncourse, an exceptionally difficult and unusual\nrulemaking. The phase-in concern in Geier one can\neasily envision being replicated in another safety\nstandard issue where the agency were to conclude that\nit's going to impose a new requirement, but it does not\nwant it rushed into service in the entire fleet right\naway and so it affirmatively discourages hurried\ninstallation. But that's not the case here because the\nagency actually encouraged earlier compliance.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Garre.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY G. GARRE\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. GARRE: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nIn 1984 and again in 1989 the agency\nspecifically determined that the statutory safety and\npracticability objectives would be best served by giving\nmanufacturers the flexibility to install a lap-only or\nlap/shoulder seatbelt.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Can I ask you a\nquestion? How is this case different from a situation\nwhere the agency looks at a request for a minimum\nstandard, says: Require that a certain light be added\nto the lights in a car. The agency comes back and says,\nyou know, there are so many designs of cars; in some\ncars, particularly sedans, the light is an added safety\nfeature; in vans it may not be because of the size of\nvans. And so we are not going to require it. We are\ngoing to let manufacturers, depending on what design\ntheir car has, to choose between the two, so that we're\nnot going to set a minimum standard for every one\nbecause there are too many different designs.\nDespite that ruling, the manufacturer says it costs\ntwo pennies more to put this light in a sedan. I know\nthe agency has said it's safer, but I don't want to do\nit. I don't have a van, I don't have any reason except\nthe two pennies that I don't want to do it. Is that\ncase preempted? Because you were just merely given the\noption?\nMR. GARRE: The typical case where a Federal\nmotor vehicle safety standard establishes only a\nminimum, like the standard for braking performance or\nroof structure is not going to be preempted. Geier says\nthat and we're not challenging that.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How is this different\nfrom the hypothetical where the agency said there could\nbe an obstruction with the entry, but manufacturers who\ncan design it without the obstruction should really do\nit. How is this, this case, different than the one\nhypothetical?\nMR. GARRE: This case is different because\nthe agency specifically recognized in 1984 and 1989 that\nthere were serious safety and practicability tradeoffs\nbetween these two different design options and\nspecifically gave manufacturers the option of installing\none type of seatbelt or the other.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Nothing in the agency that\nI can find says that the agency really wanted a mix of\noptions. I mean, they said it's up to the manufacturer.\nBut in Geier which I think all of this could be just\navoided.\nMR. GARRE: I think -\nJUSTICE BREYER: And the agency would simply\nsay, do they want to have this to be a maximum or just\nthe minimum. It's so easy to say that, but I haven't\nfound agencies saying it. I don't know why.\nMR. GARRE: We are not here -\nJUSTICE BREYER: We are forced to deal with\nthe situation we have; and the situation we have in\nGeier is filled with indications that they really wanted\na mix because of the unusual circumstances present\nthere.\nMR. GARRE: What the agency -\nJUSTICE BREYER: You have to point to\nsomething here that shows that.\nMR. GARRE: What the agency wanted here was\nflexibility. It wanted flexibility because it\nrecognized that there were safety tradeoffs and that the\nsafety and practicability objectives were best served by\nleaving -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But wait a minute. What\nthat -- what you are not answering is flexibility to\nensure that a manufacturer imposes or thinks about\nsafety and chooses the option that is safest.\nMR. GARRE: And -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So what's the inducement\nfor a manufacturer to put the light into a sedan or to\nput a seatbelt 2, when it can, without causing an added\nsafety risk? If it's preempted, there is no inducement.\nMR. GARRE: The agency recognized here that\nType 1 seatbelts, the lap-only seatbelts, themselves\nposed unique safety risks. It did so to children. If\nyou look at the 1984 rulemaking, the agency couldn't\nhave been more clear that we are not going to impose a\nType 2 mandate for rear seats, because that's going to\nbe harmful to children.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Garre -\nMR. GARRE: The agency preserved that very\nstatus quo in 1989. Petitioners recognize that in note\n1 of their brief.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Garre, in -- in Geier\nI think it was Justice Breyer who called attention to\nthe agency having informed the Court that if tort suits\nwere to go on, at -- in -- in contradiction to the\ngovernment's view that there should be both of these -\nthat the safety standards that were set there, it would\nbe disturbed. It would be impeded.\nAnd the opinion said we assign weight to the\nDepartment of Transportation there, to their view that a\ntort suit there would stand as an obstacle to the\naccomplishment of the Federal safety standards. And if\nthe Court gives weight to what the agency says in Geier,\nshouldn't it equally give weight here when NHTSA is\ntelling us there is no conflict? It says its rule sets\nout what the statute calls for, a minimum standard.\nMR. GARRE: We don't think the Court should\ndefer to the agency's position. We don't think the\nCourt should adopt it. In Geier the Court found that\nthe regulatory record was clear enough that it didn't\nhave to rely on the agency position. So we think -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But then the Court -\nwhat was the Court doing in saying that? Was it -- just\nwanted the agency to feel good?\nMR. GARRE: Well, I think what it said, and\nobviously Justice Breyer can correct me; he wrote the\nopinion for the Court -- was that it thought the\nregulatory record was clear enough, but it did\nultimately say that it did agree with the agency,\nalthough it didn't make a difference to the Court's\nopinion.\nJUSTICE BREYER: It also said -- it did say\nas a practical thing, not -- not some theoretical legal\nthing. Who is most likely to know what 40,000 pages of\nagency record actually mean and say? People in the\nagency. And the second most likely is the SG's office,\nbecause they will have to go tell them.\nMR. GARRE: But if -\nJUSTICE BREYER: So if the government\ncontinuously says, this is what the agency means and the\nagency is telling them, yes, this is what it means, the\nchances are they will come to a better, correct\nconclusion than I will with my law clerks -\nMR. GARRE: And -\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- because I have a lot to\ndo. All right.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. GARRE: Of course, from -\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's the practical. I'm\nsorry, but that is the practical idea that I think\nunderlies what was said in Geier.\nMR. GARRE: And from the Wyeth case we know\nthat the Court isn't always going to agree with the\nagency. Here I think what's different from Geier is\nthat you have no contemporaneous interpretation of the\nagency. The agency is looking at a cold record going\nback 20 years, and it's not taking into account\neverything that's in the record.\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, but it did -- we are\ndealing with 1989 primarily.\nMR. GARRE: That's right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And in 1989, I think -- we\nare at least quoted on the other side -- what the agency\nsaid was, well, we see these lap and shoulder belts are\nactually more effective. Now, we are reluctant to\nrecommend them for the center seat or aisle seat because\npeople might get caught in the spools. On the other\nhand, manufacturers may be able to work out that\nproblem. Therefore, we encourage the manufacturer to\ntry to figure out a way around it.\nAnd the SG, looking at all that stuff, says,\nyou see, they didn't mind if manufacturers were put\nunder another legal obligation to do it, because they'd\nhave no objection to making the manufacturers do it,\nthey are just not certain yet.\nMR. GARRE: And -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Now that's -- that's how I\nread what was said.\nMR. GARRE: And I think that's what the SG\nsays and we think that -- that the SG is wrong.\nWe think the agency said in 1989 and it said\nin 1984 it could not have been more clear that they did\nnot want to mandate the Type 2 belt, the very rule that\nthe Petitioners want to mandate through this State law\ntort action. They didn't want to do it because they\nwere concerned about child safety, they were concerned\nabout aisle safety, they were concerned about\npracticability.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But that's always the\ncase when the agency sets a minimum. By setting a\nminimum, it's basically saying we don't want to mandate\nmore.\nMR. GARRE: That's -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But -- but you are not\ndisagreeing that the statute by its term says that a\nminimum doesn't preempt State common law.\nMR. GARRE: The statute says that and from\nGeier we know that that doesn't resolve the preemption\nquestion.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So I'm still not sure\nwhy creating an option is any different than the\nminimum.\nMR. GARRE: Where the option is designed to\nprotect flexibility that serves the statutory safety and\npracticability objectives -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But the default is\nalways that the manufacturers have an option. A minimum\nby definition gives manufacturers options.\nMR. GARRE: It's not that. As a practical\nmatter, that kind of option, like the minimum for\nFederal braking standards is fundamentally different\nthan the kind of option is Geier and the kind of option\nhere.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But you haven't\nexplained why.\nMR. GARRE: The reason why is because -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: If the minimum by its\nown definition gives freedom to the manufacturer to\nimpose more if it chooses, or not, why does the option\nto tell a manufacturer, pick what you think is safest,\nwhy does that do more?\nMR. GARRE: Because the agency determined\nhere that the flexibility was necessary to advance\nFederal safety and practicability objectives, and that\nthat -- those objectives would be frustrated by a Type 2\nmandate. And flexibility -- this Court has\nrecognized -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But there is no such\nstatement. I mean there was a statement we don't want\nto impose those costs, but we have the agency in\ncourt -- we have the Solicitor General's office in court\ntelling us, the statute says minimum, the statute says\nthe common law isn't displaced, and we are telling the\nCourt that we think this is a situation where it is\nminimum and so the common law isn't displaced.\nShouldn't we assume that the standard that\nthe agency set, that as the agency said is a minimum\nstandard unless the agency tells us that it should be\npreemptive of tort suits?\nMR. GARRE: Not when you have the kind of\nunique standard here. Granted, this is going to be the\nrare situation. But if you look at, for example, take\nchild safety. The agency couldn't have been clearer in\n1984. Look at 49 Federal Register 15241, the final\nrule, that it was not going to mandate Type 2 seatbelts\nbecause they found that that would harm child safety.\nThe agency specifically carried forward that rule in\n1989 for the rear inboard seats at issue in this case.\nNote 1 of Petitioner's reply brief said that\nthe law is exactly the same in 1989 as to these seats as\nin 1984. It -- hasn't been preempted in 1984,\nnotwithstanding what my friend said here from the\ngovernment today; and if it was preempted in 1984 it has\nto be preempted in 1989.\nThe tradeoffs here, we have talked about the\nlawsuit involving a -- a child who was -- who was\nrestrained by a shoulder belt and harmed as a -- as a\nresult of that belt, which is a concern that NHTSA has\nrecognized throughout its history.\nUnder their position, the manufacturer could\nbe sued for having a Type 2 belt by the child who was\nharmed or by the person in the back row that had\ndifficulty getting out of the car in the event of an\naccident, just as they could be sued under Petitioner's\ntheory for having a Type 1 belt. This -- the agency\nrecognized, this was a unique situation where there were\nserious safety and practicability tradeoffs; they wanted\nto give the -- the manufacturers the flexibility to make\nthis decision, and that flexibility served, the agency\nconcluded, the Federal safety and -- and practicability\nobjectives.\nIf you look at this Court's decision -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But I'm sorry, you still\nhaven't responded to me. Manufacturers are always at\nrisk for common law claims under this statute, because\nthis statute expressly says they are. Every design\nchoice a manufacturer makes under almost any situation\nwhere the common law is in effect puts it at risk that a\njury will decide whether it did enough or not, under\ncost/ benefit analysis and technology.\nSo I don't know why when the agency creates\na minimum by choice or not, it should be implicitly\npreempted in -- from the application of State law.\nMR. GARRE: Justice Sotomayor, there are\nhundreds of Federal motor vehicle safety standards, and\nI would agree with you for virtually all of them, except\nyou have the rare standards -- and they are rare, like\nthe one in Geier and like the one here -- where the\nagency quite obviously is doing something much\ndifferent. It's expressly granting options and it's\nmaking clear in the record that the reason it is doing\nthat is to serve Federal objectives that would be\nfrustrated by the imposition of a particular rule.\nI think you have to look at this from the\nstandpoint of the manufacturers who are told that they\ncan manufacture this car with this design or that\ndesign, and you can go look at the Federal Register and\nsee that the reason the agency is doing that is to\nadvance safety and practicability objectives.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How do you tell -\nin response to Justice Sotomayor, how do you tell\nwhether the agency is giving options or simply setting a\nminimum?\nMR. GARRE: Well, first you would look -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Because a minimum,\nof course, always gives you options.\nMR. GARRE: In a very generalized sense.\nBut we know from Geier that that doesn't resolve the\npreemption question, because the same could have been\nsaid with respect to the rule in Geier.\nFirst you look at the rule, and you are just\nnot going to find very many rules at all in the\nFederal -- in the Code of Federal Regulations that\nprovide this kind of express option for equipment\ndesign. And then second, you go look and you -- and you\nsee what the agency said about that in its final rules\nand the commentary accompanying the final rules.\nAnd here, if you look, not only would you\nfind that the agency granted this flexibility to serve\nFederal safety and practicability objectives, you would\nfind that it specifically rejected the very rule that\nPetitioners want to impose on State tort law, because it\nconcluded that that rule would be counterproductive from\nthe standpoint of safety and practicability. So there\ncouldn't be -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Was that in 1989? I\nthought there was some advance in the child seats\nbetween the early '80s and '89.\nMR. GARRE: There was some question about a\nmovement from tethered to non-tethered, but that only\ncreated the compatibility issue that the agency\nrecognized in the 1989 rulemaking and 1984.\nI mean, at the same time the agency is\ntelling manufacturers: Install your -- manufacture your\ncar seats so they can be installed with a\nType 1 lap-only belt, and it's telling parents:\nParents, put your children in the rear center seat\nbecause that's going to be the safest seat, which, by\nthe way, is the seat that is going to have a lap-only\nbelt. And so it's clear -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Was that in 1989?\nMR. GARRE: That was true at the time of\n1989, as well as -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But this wasn't the\ncenter seat. This was an aisle seat.\nMR. GARRE: It was -- as the plaintiffs\ncalled it in their complaint, it was the middle seat in\nthe middle row. It was a center seat in every practical\nsense. It just happened to be an aisle seat as well,\nbecause there was a space on the -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't understand that,\nand I looked for a diagram. It talked about the center\nseat, aisle seat -\nMR. GARRE: Unfortunately, the diagrams -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Do you know what the\nterminology is?\nMR. GARRE: It's not in the record, Justice\nScalia.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Where is it?\nMR. GARRE: You have three rows in the car.\nIn the front row, you've got the driver's side and the\nfront row driver on the right-hand side. And then you\nhave the middle row of seat, and then have you a back\nrow.\nThe middle row seat had a seat on the side,\nwhich was the outboard seat, a seat in the middle, which\nis where the descendent in this case was sitting, and\nthen it had an aisle next to it. So it was a center\nseat -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The aisle was not between\nthe two seats?\nMR. GARRE: No, it was on the side of the\nvehicle. So it was the center seat in every practical\nsense, and therefore provided the same structural\nconcerns that NHTSA recognized.\nJUSTICE BREYER: They wrote: \"Of course, in\nthose cases where manufacturers are able to design and\ninstall lap/shoulder belts at seating positions adjacent\nto aisleways without interfering with the aisleway's\npurpose of allowing access to more rearward seating\npositions, NHTSA encourages the manufacturers to do so.\"\nIt doesn't sound like they are against a\ntort suit that would require you to do so, because, in\nprinciple at least, all of those things should be taken\ninto account.\nMR. GARRE: If I could make three points in\nresponse to that.\nFirst, as the language you just read\nindicates, it didn't require -- they didn't encourage at\nall costs. They encouraged where this specific safety\nconcern could be addressed.\nSecond, there is a world of difference\nbetween saying, we encourage manufacturers to do what's\nappropriate when they can practically do so, and a world\nin which a jury could have decided the day after -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Those arguments are what I\nthink Justice Sotomayor was saying: It is a huge\nproblem for manufacturers. It's called tort suits in\ndifferent places and different juries and different\nStates. But that is beyond the scope of this case.\nIf the agency wants to displace those tort\nsuits often, all they have to do is say that the purpose\nis something like you are saying and that they are\nintended to be displaced.\nMR. GARRE: We know from Geier that the\nagency doesn't have to make a formal statement to\njustify its intent.\nJUSTICE BREYER: It doesn't have to. That's\nwhy I am only making this comment, rather than in the\nform of this question that maybe I don't understand why\nthey don't. It would make our job simpler.\nMR. GARRE: I think the record -- we\ncertainly think the record here -- the agency really\ncouldn't have been clearer in saying: We don't want the\nType 2 mandate, the lap/shoulder mandate the Petitioners\nare trying to impose here. It said it unambiguously -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: If the government doesn't\nmean what it says the way you do -- we are being told\nhere that far from encouraging Type 1, all along, the\ngovernment says: Yes, Type 2 is a better seatbelt.\nMR. GARRE: Well, that's just not true. And\nwith respect to the government, I don't think that the\nregulatory record supports that generalized statement\nthat it was Type 2 at all -- at all costs. It was clear\nthat the agency recognized -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: No, they did say that the\nreason that we are not making it mandatory is because of\nsome cost benefit analysis. We don't think we should\nimpose that as a minimum then.\nMR. GARRE: And gave the very unique kind of\noption here. The agency identified several costs with\nimposing a Type 2 mandate here. It recognized the\nunique safety concerns present when you are trying to\nstretch a Type 2 belt across the aisle, which is going\nto block access, which is a clear safety concern. It\nidentified the child safety concerns which were the\nbasis for this very same option in 1984 and which were\ncarried forward when the agency preserved the status quo\nfor the rear inboard seats at issue here. It recognized\nother safety concerns, including obstructing the\nrearward vision of drivers when you install the Type 2\nbelt in the center seat, because -\nJUSTICE ALITO: By 1989, hadn't the agency\ndecided that the child safety concerns were no longer\napplicable?\nMR. GARRE: No, and the portion of the\nnotice of proposed rulemaking that's cited refers to the\nno positive or negative effects. And that language, it\ndoes not lead to the conclusion that the government and\nPetitioner suggests, for a few reasons.\nFirst, the agency was referring only to rear\noutboard seats, not rear inboard seats, the kind of seat\nat issue. And that's important because NHTSA was\ntelling parents: Put your children in the rear center\nseat, the inboard seat, because that -- that seat also\nwas the seat that was most likely to have the lap belt,\nwhich is how NHTSA was telling child seat manufacturers\nto install their child seats, that you could install\nthem with a lap belt because it was more compatible with\nthat.\nSecond of all, that, the reference to the no\npositive or negative, was a tentative assessment. If\nyou look in the Federal Register where that language\nappears -- it's on 53 Federal Register 47988 to 47989 -\nthe agency said: This is a tentative assessment; we\nwant your comments on this. Comments came back and the\nagency backed off from that and said, we have to examine\nthis more.\nAnd secondly, that positive -- no positive\nor negative statement -- could only apply when child -\nwhen children were using the boosters which would help\nwith the Type 2 shoulder belt so the belt wasn't going\nover the neck. But NHTSA knew at that time that very\nfew, less than 1 percent, of parents were actually\nputting their kids in the booster seats. This was\n20 years ago. This was at a time when many children\nweren't in any car seats at all, no matter what NHTSA\nwas saying.\nSo they recognized that they were at real\nrisk here, that children -- children with a Type 2 belt,\njust to be clear -- and NHTSA recognized this during the\n1989 rulemaking -- that belt is going to pose an obvious\nsafety risk to children, because the shoulder belt that\nis terrific for adults is going to take -- is going to\ncreate unique chest loads on children. And if the\nchildren is not on a booster, as virtually all were not,\nthe belt is going to appear too high on the head -- on\nthe neck or head, which is a safety problem.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why didn't they prohibit\nit, if they were so sure about that? They allowed it,\ndidn't they?\nMR. GARRE: Well, because this -- this was\nsomething, Justice Scalia, that the agency struggled\nwith for almost a decade until it ultimately adopted the\nlatch system, which resolved the compatibility issue of\nthe lap belt versus the lap/shoulder belt for installing\nthe child car seat. I mean, anyone who has tried to\ninstall a child car seat with a Type 2 belt, the\nlap/shoulder belt, knows how difficult it was. And the\nagency went back and forth on this and ultimately went\nin a completely different direction in 1999 and\ninstalled the lap system.\nAnd another thing that happened is over\ntime, booster seats became more accepted. More parents\nwere putting children in booster seats. And we solved\nthat safety concern as well. But 20 years ago, at the\ntime that this rule was adopted, the agency clearly\nappreciated the child safety risk. Again, in 1984 -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why shouldn't we allow the\njuries to take account of those changes over time?\nMR. GARRE: Because it would -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, as you say, the\nagency's rule only spoke of the situation at that time.\nMR. GARRE: This was an area that NHTSA was\ncarefully monitoring. You had rulemakings in '84 and\n'89 and it adopted a very unique approach to resolving\nthe safety issue, which was to expressly give\nmanufacturers this option to advance Federal safety and\npracticability objectives. We haven't talked as much\nabout the practicability objectives, but that is one of\nthe statutory objectives of the act.\nCongress couldn't have been more clear on\nthat and the agency in 1989 couldn't have been more\nclear in the final notice, saying we are not going to\nrequire manufacturers to install Type 2 belts in the\nrear center and aisle seats because that's just too\ncostly. It's substantially expensive and the agency\nwell knew based on its history that imposing this sort\nof overly costly safety measures that the Type 2 belt\nwould have been for these seats at that time could have\nproved counterproductive with the agency's long-term\nsafety mission.\nThe agency said that in the rulemaking in\nthis case at 52 Federal Register 22819 where it said\nthat requiring these kind of overly costly measures\ncreated a lost opportunity to improve safety through\nother means.\nThis is something that Congress gave the\nagency the expert judgment to make on these matters and\nthe practicability objectives, which was just as much a\nstatutory objective as a safety objective, would have\nbeen directly frustrated if, as could have happened\nunder the Petitioners position in this case, on the very\nday after the agency passed this rule in 1989 and said\nwe are not going to require rear inboard seats to have\nType 2 lap/shoulder belts. A jury in California hit my\nclient with a multimillion dollar punitive damages award\nbecause they did not install a Type 2 belt in that seat.\nThat would have been directly contrary to\nthe Federal objectives. It would have undermined the\nsafety objectives that the agency recognized and it\nwould have undermined the practicability objectives that\nthe agency recognized, and then you have this world in\nwhich manufacturers like my client could be hit with\nmultimillion dollar punitive damages award in one state\nfor installing the Type 2 belt where a child was injured\nor someone was in the back seat and couldn't get out.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought we were told\nthat there was one manufacturer, I think General Motors\nwas mentioned, that was doing this Type 2 belt\nuniformly?\nMR. GARRE: I think that was later in time.\nIt wasn't in 1989. Truthfully, if you look at late as\n2004 when the agency adopted so-called Anton's law rule,\nwhich eventually did mandate Type 2 belts in these kinds\nof seats. Even then the agency recognized that there\nwere still technical feasibility concerns with\ninstalling the Type 2 belts in these seats.\nAnd just to be clear, the problem is, is\nfinding the anchor to install the shoulder belt in rear\ncenter or aisle seats. You have got to anchor it\nsomewhere. If you put it in the side wall you are going\nto have straps crossing across the aisle and obstructing\naccess. If you put it in the roof you are going to have\nsomething -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But that is not the\nissue here. The issue is whether it was feasible in\nthis car, not whether or not it was not feasible\nelsewhere.\nMR. GARRE: And the agency resolved\nconclusively that it was not practical in 1989. Was it\ntheoretically possible? Eventually manufacturers -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That goes to my point of\nthe light in the sedan versus the van. It's letting the\nmanufacturers decide what's the best choice.\nMR. GARRE: It gave them that flexibility,\nthe agency determined in the 1994 chief counsel letter\nand we hope the Court does read it, makes it clear that\nthe agency concluded that in this situation, and it's a\nrare situation, the manufacturer was in the best\nposition to decide what was most appropriate for its\nvehicles. And, again, there is this flexibility\nobjective.\nIf you look at Fidelity Federal Savings &\nLoan v. A. la Cuesta, the decision cited on page 19 of\nour brief, you have this Court recognizing that a\nFederal law that gave flexibility where you have a state\nmandate that interferes with that flexibility, that is\nan actual conflict. Ultimately under Geier, this Court\nis looking for the existence of an actual conflict. We\nthink a rule that says manufacturers, you are free to\nchoose between this type of seatbelt and that type of\nseatbelt, and the reason we are giving you that\nflexibility is to advance federal safety and\npracticability objectives.\nWe are not going to require you to put a\nlap/shoulder belt in there because that would frustrate\nthose Federal objectives, the state law tort suit that\nwould mandate the very thing that the agency chose not\nto, to advance federal objectives is preempted. If\nthere are no further questions?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Buchanan, have you four minutes.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MARTIN N. BUCHANAN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. BUCHANAN: First of all, I would like to\nclear up the child safety issue and I know Mr. Jay has\naddressed this to some extent, but let me be perfectly\nclear, there is absolutely nothing in the '87 to '89\nregulatory history that mentions anything about child\nsafety being a consideration in the agency's decision\nnot to mandate Type 2 shoulder belts for aisle and\ncenter seating positions.\nSpecifically, Justice Ginsberg asked Mr.\nGarre about whether there is anything about the rear\ncenter seat being the safest place for children in that\nregulatory history. There is no mention whatsoever in\nthat regulatory history about that issue, and the reason\nfor that is this: The reason the rear center seat was\nconsidered safer for children had nothing to do with the\ntype of seatbelt that was installed in that seat.\nIt's considered safest for children because\nit's farthest from the potential point of impact in a\nside impact collision.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: When you talk about\nsafety to children, are you also addressing the strap\ngoing across the aisle or the strap interfering with\nvision? I know that is not directly related to\nchildren, but it affects what type of belt might be the\nsafest overall.\nMR. BUCHANAN: You are right,\nMr. Chief Justice, that was not expressed in any way in\nterms of a child safety concern. I would also, minor\ncorrection, the interference with rear vision was a\ncomment that a commenter made in the regulatory history\nand the agency never really expressed an opinion one way\nor the other about whether that was a concern.\nI think what's really important here is that\nstate tort law provides an incentive for manufacturers\nto exercise their options reasonably. And whether that\noption is to exceed a minimum standard that doesn't have\noptions, or to choose between two different options that\na minimum standard provides, state tort law ensures that\nmanufacturers act reasonably. Our contention -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But state tort law\ndoesn't, juries typically don't take into account the\nfleet costs of avoiding liability, which as I understand\nfrom the SG's brief in this case was the reason that\nType 2 was not mandated, because of the overall costs.\nYou have a jury with an injured plaintiff, they are not\nlikely to weigh heavily the fact that this would cost 3\nextra cents per car fleet wide. I think that is the\nsort of thing NHTSA considers.\nMR. BUCHANAN: Mr. Chief Justice, under any\nstate's tort law, I think cost and feasibility would be\npractical considerations for the jury under the jury\ninstructions given. Those are liability issues, cost\nand feasibility in any tort system. And so that's a\nliability issue down the road.\nHere it's important to preserve state tort\nlaw because Congress said state tort law shall be\npreserved. And again, whether it's a choice between\noptions, Type 1 or Type 2, or whether it's potential\nliability for not going beyond the minimum braking\nstandard, either way manufacturers should be held\naccountable according to Congress in its enactment of\nthe statute for the design choices they make. There is\nnothing different about a design standard option 1\nversus option 2.\nThe final point I want to make before I sit\ndown is that I think in some respects this case with\nregard to the question about whether Congress intended\nfor the agency to be the exclusive authority for\nweighing these types of considerations, in some respects\nWyeth versus Levine is instructive here.\nBecause I think that was the same argument\nthat was made in Wyeth versus Levine, that a jury should\nnot be allowed to second-guess the FDA's labeling issues\nand to allow the jury to do so would subvert the\nexclusive authority of a Federal agency, and the Court\nrejected that argument in Wyeth, and as the dissent\npointed out in Wyeth, that statute did not even have a\nSavings Clause. And it did not define the labeling\nstandards as minimum standards.\nHere we have a much more clear expression of\ncongressional intent. They intended these to be minimum\nstandards. They have a savings clause that says common\nlaw liability shall be preserved. Obviously Congress\ndid not intend NHTSA to be the exclusive safety standard\ncook. They deliberately preserved state court juries as\nalso providing for additional vehicle safety and for an\nincentive to manufacture safer vehicles.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
