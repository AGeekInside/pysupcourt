DABNEY\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. DABNEY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThis case concerns a very broadly worded\npatent claim, claim 4 of the Engelgau patent, that the\nSolicitor General and the United States Patent and\nTrademark Office have both told this Court is invalid\nunder Section 103 of the Patent Act and was issued in\nerror. The Federal Circuit's vacatur of summary\njudgment in this case is grounded in a judicially\ndevised test that is fundamentally inconsistent with --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: May I ask, if that's the\nposition of the PTO, why aren't they proceeding to\ncancel the patent?\nMR. DABNEY: The case is in litigation at\nthis point, Justice Ginsburg, and in patent litigation\ndistrict courts are vested with authority and this\nCourt is vested with authority to render a judgment of\ninvalidity under Section 282 of the Patent Act.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But the question is, you\nsay the PTO has recognized that it issued this patent,\nthat it's an invalid issuance. So why aren't they\ncuring their own mistakes, never mind what a court is\ngoing to do?\nMR. DABNEY: Well, there is the possibility\nof director- initiated re-examination of patents as\ncertainly an administrative remedy that does exist. But\nwhere a case is in pending litigation such as this, the\ntraditional way that these disputes are resolved is for\na court to apply the law to the facts and render a\njudgment on a defense of invalidity which has been\npleaded to the plaintiff's claim of patent infringement\nin this case. This issue arises in the context of a\ndefense pleaded to a claim for patent infringement and\nI'm not sure that the Patent Office really could swoop\nin and cut off the plaintiff's claim in the manner Your\nHonor is suggesting.\nThe Federal Circuit in this case applied the\napproach it's applied in previous cases, which is a\ncategorical approach. The Federal Circuit says that no\nmatter what might be the nature of an alleged invention\nor improvement, no matter how broad might be a claim\nmade in an issued patent, no matter how small might be\nthe difference between a patent claim and prior art, and\nno matter how modest might have been the degree of skill\nneeded to devise subject matter described by a patent\nclaim, the Federal Circuit says regardless of any or all\nof that a court of the United States can never, ever\nsustain a defense of invalidity under Section 103 of the\nPatent Act except in a very limited and narrowly defined\ncircumstance.\nThat circumstance is a record that includes\nclear and convincing evidence, that yields a jury\nverdict or specific finding showing what the Federal\nCircuit calls a teaching, suggestion, or motivation to\ncombine prior art teachings in the particular manner\nclaimed by the patent at issue. The decision in this\ncase treats Section 103 not, as this Court has said, as\na codification of a condition for patentability whose\nbenchmark is skill and ingenuity. The decision in this\ncase treats section 1 as implementing a supposed\nentitlement to patent protection that a court --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You're talking about in\nthis case.\nMR. DABNEY: Yes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: We're talking about what\nthe law should be. Would you make, be making the same\nargument if we were looking at the most recent decisions\nof the Federal Circuit, the ones that they issued within\nthe year, and each as I remember they held that the\npatent was obvious and therefore invalid? Suppose we\nwere dealing in what was, the cases were, what were\nthey, Kahn, Alpha, and Diestar?\nMR. DABNEY: Your Honor, what the Federal\nCircuit has done in recent times has been after a\ncertiorari was granted in this case to erect a series of\nescape devices from what is otherwise a categorical test\nthat must be imposed in all cases. As a practical\nmatter the Federal Circuit still characterizes as an\nissue of fact for determination by a jury the presence\nor absence of teaching, suggestion, or motivation, and\nso these seemingly remedial steps that have been taken\nby the Federal Circuit do not materially affect the\nproblem that's praised by this case, which is the well\nnigh impossibility nowadays of being able to have an\nefficient, inexpensive, quick and predictable\ndetermination of whether claimed subject matter meets\nthe statutory standard.\nJUSTICE ALITO: But what is the difference\nbetween asking whether something is implicit in the, in\nthe prior art and simply asking whether it would have\nbeen obvious to a person of ordinary skill in the art?\nMR. DABNEY: The statute and this Court's\nprecedents make the benchmark of patentability skill,\nwhat degree of skill is needed to devise subject matter\nin respect to an objectively defined problem, objective\nlooking at the claim and looking at the prior art? What\nthe Federal Circuit is talking about now is an inquiry\ninto motivation, not skill. Those two are very\ndifferent concepts. There is not a word in this Court's\nprecedents that says that whether a patent should be\ngranted or not depends on whether a hypothetical person\nhad hypothetical motivation to do what everybody knows\nhe could do.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Of course, the\nreason that the Federal Circuit has devised this\nadditional test or gloss on Graham is that they say\nobviousness is, it's deceptive in hindsight. In\nhindsight everybody says, I could have thought of that;\nand that you need -- if you don't have the sort of\nconstraint that their test imposes, it's going to be too\neasy to say that everything was obvious.\nMR. DABNEY: Well, the Court, Mr. Chief\nJustice, the Court needs to be very clear what is meant\nby the term \"hindsight.\" If by hindsight is meant\nlooking at what's claimed now, the subject matter sought\nto be patented, and comparing that to the prior art, to\ncall that analytical process improper hindsight is to\nmake a frontal assault on the statute itself. If by\nhindsight means to posit a desired result, a clay\ndoorknob, and to ask whether more skill and ingenuity\nthan were required by ordinary skill in the art was\nneeded to do that, to say that that constitutes improper\nhindsight is to make a frontal assault on the entire\nbody of this Court's precedents construing section 103\nand its common law predecessors.\nWith regard to the kind of bias Your Honor\nis talking about, this Court's precedents provide a\nwealth of mechanisms for protecting against that,\nincluding the statement towards the end of the Graham\nopinion, which is the only source of the word\n\"hindsight\" that I've seen cited in the amici brief,\nwhich was a discussion of the secondary consideration.\nSo that in a case like Goodyear against Rayovac there's\nan excellent case where the claimed subject matter seems\nso simple in hindsight. This was a case decided by this\nCourt in 1944. A leakproof battery that had been a\nproblem that had defied solution for years and there was\nall kinds of motivation to solve it, and the fact that\nit was not solved was considered important by this Court\nin sustaining the validity of the patent in that case,\nwhich claimed nothing more than a sheet metal sheath\nwrapped around the electrodes and materials generated in\nthe battery.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I can understand, I think,\nwhat a teaching is. I take it a teaching is you put all\nthe prior art -- that's what I guess that's what Judge\nRich explained, which I thought was very enlightening to\nme in I can't remember the name of the case, Wigmore,\nWinsmore --\nMR. DABNEY: Winslow.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Winslow. You put it all\naround the room. All right, we've got it all around the\nroom, and I begin to look at it and if I see over that\nit somehow teaches me to combine these two things, if it\nsays, Breyer, combine this and that, that's a teaching\nand then it's obvious. Now, maybe it doesn't have the\nteaching, it just has the suggestion. Maybe it says, we\nsuggest you combine this or that; okay, then it's\nobvious. But I don't understand, though I've read it\nabout 15 or 20 times now, it though I've read it about\n15 or 20 times now, I just don't understand what is\nmeant by the term \"motivation.\"\nMR. DABNEY: Well, the best I think anybody\ncould do would be to look at the opinion in this case\nand try to figure that out.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I tried. You've read a lot\nof cases. You're a patent lawyer, and so what is the\nunderstanding as best you have it of what is just meant\nby the term \"motivation\"? To be more specific, if they\nmean motivated to go look to the prior art, well,\nanybody would want to look in the prior art. If I want\nto invent something I'll look anywhere. I'll look to\nthe prior art. I'll look to the Library of Congress.\nI'll look to my cousin. I mean, I'll look wherever I\ncan find it. So they can't mean that, and if they don't\nmean that what do they mean?\nMR. DABNEY: Well, in this case what the\nrespondents is Mr. Engelgau would have had no motivation\nto look to the Asano-designed pedal because he was\ntrying to meet the requirements of Fort Motor Company\nand Asano would not have met those requirements and\ntherefore Mr. Engelgau would have had no motivation to\nstart with Asano.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Say that again? You\nwouldn't have a motivation to look to the prior art to\nfind your problem. What's an example where you have a\nmotivation distinguishing you from everybody else? I\nmean, everybody has a motivation to look to the prior\nart.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You disagree with the\nmotivation test.\nMR. DABNEY: Yes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So perhaps you're not the\n--\nJUSTICE BREYER: Right person to ask.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. DABNEY: I respectfully suggest --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You don't have a\nmotive to answer that question right away.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Fine, that's fine.\nMR. DABNEY: I believe if you study\ncarefully this Court's precedence, including Graham\nitself and just about every other case this Court has\never decided, what this Court has said is the measure,\nwhat our society agreed to pay off on is subject matter\nthat reflects a certain degree of skill. And this Court\nhas rejected time and time again the notion that someone\nwho was the first simply to take advantage of the known\ncapability of technology was entitled to a patent.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, would it be, would\nit be inadvisable for us to say the motive test teaches\nus something important; it has a valuable place; it's\njust not the exclusive test for what's obvious.\nMR. DABNEY: Certainly.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Or do we have to reject it\nall out of -- out of hand?\nMR. DABNEY: The -- the presence or absence\nof motivation to devise something.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Motivation in this special\nsense.\nMR. DABNEY: Well, I'm not sure it is in a\nspecial sense. What the Federal Circuit has done is\nhas, it has attributed controlling significance to what\nis in most cases at best a factor, and in fact is\nnothing more than a legal argument about the preemptive\neffect of prior art. The motivation debate in this case\nis all about what is the preemptive legal effect of the\nAsano reference. It either invalidates the claim --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But, but, but my question\nis does it not serve to show us at least one way in\nwhich there can be obviousness?\nMR. DABNEY: I would agree that if there is\n--\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: It may not be the\nexclusive test. We're -- I'm asking what the test ought\nto be.\nMR. DABNEY: Well, the test, I mean in this\ncase, the specific claim at issue in this case is very\nanalogous to the claim that this Court considered in the\nAnderson's-Black Rock case. What we have in this case\nis no dispute as to any of the factual inquiries that\nhave traditionally defined patent validity analysis.\nThe prior art that we rely on, it's undisputed that it's\nprior art and it's in the record. The level of skill is\nundisputed. The quantum of difference between the\nclaimed subject matter and the prior art is undisputed.\nThe only issue in this case is what legal consequences\nfollow from that. What question do you ask to decide\nwhether or not that difference adds up to a patentable\ninvention?\nIt's very analogous to what was going on in\nthe Anderson's-Black Rock case. Anderson's-Black Rock\nwas a case like this in which someone had invented a\nradiant heat burner and the patentee in that case had\nseen that there was a market for using that by attaching\nit to an asphalt spreader. So the patent claim in that\ncase was taking someone else's invention, the radiant\nheat burner and hanging it on a standard painting\napparatus and using it for its, one of its marketable\npurposes.\nThis Court held in this, in the\nAnderson's-Black Rock case that the patentee had not\ndone anything patentable in that case. All he had done\nwas take a burner that functioned as a burner, and a\nspreader that functioned as a spreader, and the two\ncomponents did not affect one another's operation at\nall. It was in the parlance of this Court's precedents,\nan aggregation.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: How does -- how does\nmotivation enter into that analysis in that case? How\nwould you, how would you have applied the motivation? I\n-- like Justice Breyer, I don't understand what the\nmotivation -- motivation element is. How would you have\napplied the --\nMR. DABNEY: Well, if the patentee in that\ncase --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: He had no particular\nmotivation to use that earlier patent, did he?\nMR. DABNEY: Well, actually in that case\nthere actually was quite a story. In that case there\nwas a story that for years and years you'd had this cold\njoint problem of laying successive courses of asphalt\nblacktop, and -- and this guy actually saw something\nthat was interesting, that you could use this radiant\nheat burner to solve the asphalt blacktop problem. That\nwas not what he claimed, though.\nWhat he claimed was an apparatus that just\nhad these two things together, and they didn't interact\nwith one another any more than if they had been both put\nin the same shopping bag. And that's what we have in\nthis case. We have an adjustable pedal assembly that\ndoes whatever --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: No. No. No. It took\nfrom 10 years to go from -- I think 10 years from Asano\nto Engelgau, so it must have been not all that obvious.\nMR. DABNEY: Well, the, on this record, and\neven if you take at face value what's said in the\nrespondent's brief in this case, which is very largely\nnot based on the record, the story is, from Mr. Engelgau\nis, Fort Motor Company had a particular requirement and\nMr. Engelgau sat down to design to it. He to design a\npedal that had would meet Ford's requirements and one\nway that he did that was to come up with the kind of\npedal assembly that's shown in the figures of the\npatent.\nBut we are not here talking about the\npatentability of the figures of the patent. We are not\ntalking about the patentability of claims 1, 2 or 3 of\nthe patent; we are talking about claim 4 in which these\nrespondents got a little greedy. Claim 4 describes\nalmost nothing --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Do you, do you concede --\ndo you concede that claims 1 through 3 are valid?\nMR. DABNEY: We take no position on that.\nThey're not an issue in the case.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: If I had asked your\nopinion as an expert would you --\n(Laughter.)\nMR. DABNEY: Well, Your Honor, with respect,\nI would have no opinion on that question.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. DABNEY: I could stand here and make\narguments.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I mean it seems to\nme that the whole argument that you're making as to Ford\nis that anybody knows you could, you use an electronic\n-- you have an electronic throttle, it serves a purpose;\nthe pedal serves a purpose; put the two together.\nMR. DABNEY: Here's the --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Why doesn't -- don't 1, 2\nand 3 do the same thing?\nMR. DABNEY: Well, because -- because --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: If they're invalid then I\nhave -- then I'm struggling to find what your test is.\nMR. DABNEY: Here's the reason.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I don't know what your\ntest is.\nMR. DABNEY: Here's the reason. What's\nshown in the figures of the Engelgau patent is an\nadjustable pedal assembly that has a large bore tube\nfrom which you suspended a pedal arm on a yoke, and it\nslides back and forth along the tube. And that's the\nway that it provides for adjustment. And in claims 1, 2\nand 3 some of that structure is recited. So those\nclaims would not necessarily be invalid by the Asano\nreference because the Asana adjustment mechanism doesn't\nuse a tube, and doesn't use a yoke; it uses pins and\nslots and it provides adjustment by a different\nmechanism. The respondents have not asserted claims 1,\n2 and 3 in this case because those claims don't describe\nanything remotely like the petitioner's pedals. They\nlimited their claim to claim 4 because only by claiming\nthis enormous verbal abstraction that is claim 4 can\nthey make a colorable claim of patent infringement\nagainst the petitioner in this case.\nSo I would respectfully submit that the\nCourt does not need to decide whether 1, 2 or 3 would be\nvalid but the point would be, the question would be what\nwe did in the Hotchkiss case or in the Anderson's-Black\nRock case or any of these cases. Would it have required\nmore than ordinary skill to devise that claim structure\nwith those additional structural limitations to solve\nsome objectively defined problem, and that hasn't been\nlitigated or briefed.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Going back to the asphalt\ncase, were you suggesting that if they had made a claim\nfor a process patent, that it might have been valid?\nMR. DABNEY: Conceivably. If there are no\nfurther questions I'd like to reserve the rest of my\ntime.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Dabney.\nMr. Hungar.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS G. HUNGAR\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE\nSUPPORTING PETITIONER\nMR. HUNGAR: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court.\nConstrued as the sole means of proving\nobviousness the teaching suggestion motivation test is\ncontrary to the Patent Act, irreconcilable with this\nCourt's precedents and bad policy. It asks the wrong\nquestion and in cases like this one, it produces the\nwrong answer. It should be rejected and the judgment of\nthe Court of Appeals should be reversed.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What do you\nunderstand motivation to refer to in that test?\nMR. HUNGAR: Well, it's not entirely clear,\nYour Honor. I think that it's sometimes difficult to\ndistinguish, certainly between motivation and\nsuggestion. One way in which it is used for example, is\nif there were some indication in the prior art that\ndoing something a certain way might save money and then\nthere would be a motivation to save money, which might\nsupply the requisite motivation for combining the two\nprior art references.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Do you agree that in that\ncontext it would serve a valid purpose, i.e., can we --\nthat is to say, can we keep the motivation test and then\nsupplement it with other, with other means of, other\nways of showing obviousness?\nMR. HUNGAR: Yes, Your Honor. We agree that\nteaching suggestion and motivation are valid means of\nproving obviousness, valid considerations for the Court.\nAnd this Court's precedents are entirely consistent with\nthat. A number of cases cited by respondent show that\nthe Court has looked to suggestion as a means to\ndetermining whether a patent is obvious.\nThe problem with the Federal Circuit's test\nis it makes that the exclusive test and precludes\nobviousness determinations in the absence of\nsatisfaction of that test which this Court's precedents\nare clearly not consistent with. In fact in Graham\nitself, in the Sakraida case, in Dann against Johnston,\nlower courts had held patents valid because of a lack of\nsuggestion. This Court reversed without requiring or\neven addressing the question whether there was some\nexplicit principle that had been proven by the party\nchallenging the patent, by clear evidence that there was\nsuch a teaching suggestion motivation. It's just\nforeign to this Court's precedents as a mandatory\nprerequisite for obviousness.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: What do you make of the,\nsort of the revolution argument that whether it's\ncontrary or intention with, in fact the, it's been\napplied in what is now the Fed Circuit for what, 20\nyears, more than 20 years I guess. And to tip it over\nnow is going to produce chaos. What's the answer to\nthat?\nMR. HUNGAR: Well, several things, Your\nHonor. First of all, of course, there can be no\nlegitimate reliance in lower court precedent that's\ncontrary to Supreme Court precedent, and it was an open\nsecret in the patent bar that the approach being taken\nby the Federal Circuit was inconsistent with cases such\nas this Court's Sakraida decision.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, I realize there's\nbeen comment on it, but guess I'm -- I'm raising the\nquestion that comes up in the old motto. I mean, if the\nerror is common enough and long enough, the error\nbecomes the law. And in effect is that what we are\nconfronted with here?\nMR. HUNGAR: No, Your Honor. I just think\nit would be dangerous proposition for this Court to\nendorse that line of argumentation but even leaving that\naside, it's not justified here on the facts. And this\npatent is a good example. No one is suggesting that\nclaims 1 through 3 are invalid; the problem here is that\nclaim 4 sweeps so broadly, so much broader than what the\napplicant in fact invented, that it sweeps in obvious\nmanifestations.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, but -- if we see it\nyour way, are there going to be 100,000 cases filed\ntomorrow morning?\nMR. HUNGAR: I don't think so, Your Honor.\nWhat we are talking about here are claims at the outer\nboundaries of patentability, even under the Federal\nCircuit's test. And in those cases there will no doubt\nbe some claims, such as the claim in this case that can\nbe resolved at summary judgment by a court, that the\ncourt can simply determine as a matter of law, it's\nobvious. Whereas under the Federal Circuit's test it\nhas to go to a jury and the somewhat unpredictable, at\nthe least --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Hungar, this is the\nproblem that I have with your test. I think I\nunderstand you right, now, just to say teaching\nsuggestion motivation has its place; it's okay; but it\nshouldn't be the exclusive test.\nMR. HUNGAR: Correct.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And what I understand\nyour brief to say is that it has to be supplemented with\nwhat you have called, you've labelled \"sufficiently\ninnovative.\" And then I begin to think well, what's\n\"sufficiently innovative?\" How is a trier supposed to\nknow if something -- in other words I think what you're\nsuggesting as a supplement is rather vague.\nMR. HUNGAR: Your Honor, I think the\n\"sufficiently innovative\" is more of a description\nrather than a test; it's a description of what this\nCourt said in Graham. In Graham itself the Court laid\nout the proper analysis which is you need to consider in\ndetail, not in the more cursory fashion that the Federal\nCircuit's test encourages, but in detail the\ncapabilities of a person of ordinary skill and the\ncontent of the prior art and the differences between the\nprior art and the invention, and ascertain -- it's\nultimately a legal judgment informed by those detailed\nfactual inquiries, whether it is obvious or nonobvious\nand entitled to patent protection.\nAnd in addition I would point out that this\nCourt in Sakraida provided a framework for assessing\npatents like this one, where each of the elements is set\nforth in the prior art and each of the elements in the\nclaimed invention is merely performing its already\nknown, previously known function as set forth in the\nprior art.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Hungar, I have a\nquestion that's sort of along the lines of Justice\nGinsburg's. It isn't just the Federal Circuit that has\nbeen applying this test. It's also the Patent Office\nand it's been following the Federal Circuit's test for\n20 years or so.\nWhat, what is -- assuming that we sweep that\ntest aside and say it's been incorrect, what happens to\nthe presumption of validity of, of patents which the\ncourts have been, have been traditionally applying?\nDoes it make any sense to presume that patents are valid\nwhich have been issued under an erroneous test for the\nlast 20 years?\nMR. HUNGAR: Your Honor, I think that it\nwould make sense because the statute requires it, and as\na practical matter it shouldn't make any difference,\nbecause the only category of cases in which the result\nwould change under our test is the category in which as\na matter of law, in light of the factual issues that are\nrequired under Graham, as a matter of law the Court\nconcludes that the difference between the claimed\ninvention and the prior art is so trivial that it cannot\nbe given the protection of a patent. And in those\ncircumstances the presumption doesn't come into play.\nIt's a legal determination; the presumption has been\nunderstood to effect the burden of proof, and in the\nFederal Circuit's view the measure of the burden of\nproof requiring clear and convincing evidence on the\nunderlying factual considerations, not the ultimate\nlegal determination.\nBut one of the problems with the Federal\nCircuit's test is that it transforms what this Court\nmade clear in Graham is supposed to be a legal\ndetermination. Ultimately it transforms it into a jury\nquestion. Because in a case like this one where you\nhave as conclusory affidavits from respondent's experts\nsaying \"oh, this would not have been obvious.\" And that\nin the Court of Appeals view is enough to create a jury\nquestion and then you then have to role the dice in\nfront of a jury in each one of these cases, except of\ncourse the many cases in which the challenger can't meet\nthe teaching suggestion motivation test at all and\nsimply is unable to challenge the validity of the\npatent, notwithstanding this Court's holding in Graham\nthat it's ultimately a legal determination -- admittedly\none informed by detailed factual inquiries.\nAnother problem with the Federal Circuit's\ntest is that it devalues and de-emphasizes the statutory\nfocus and this Court's focus in Graham on the\ncapabilities of the person of ordinary skill.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well when you talk\nabout the statutory focus, your innovation test -- I\nmean, do you regard that, is that a legal conclusion of\nnonobviousness? Or is it an additional test beyond what\nthe statute requires?\nMR. HUNGAR: We haven't suggested an\ninnovation test, Your Honor. We were simply attempting\nto describe in perhaps imprecise terms the holding of\nthis Court in Graham, and the holding of this Court in\nGraham is that the ultimate inquiry for the court,\nobviously suggestion, teaching, motivation, teaching a\nway in the prior art, all of these are factual,\nsubsidiary factual issues that will shed light and a\ngreat deal of light on the ultimate question in each\nparticular case, but ultimately the question for the\ncourt is whether in light of all those underlying\nfactual showings the differences between the claimed\ninvention and the prior art are sufficient to, that they\nwould have been obvious to a person of ordinary skill in\nthe art. And that ultimately is a legal determination,\nyou can refer to that as sufficiently innovative to\njustify a patent, but the ultimate question, the\nultimate test is the one set forth in the statute and in\nthe Graham decision.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: In this case, would there\nhave been anything for a jury under your test?\nMR. HUNGAR: No, Your Honor, because in this\ncase it is perfectly clear that it would have been\nobvious for a person of ordinary skill to take the Asano\npatent, add the sensor, the electronic sensor in a\nmanner that that off-the-shelf sensor is designed to be\nadded, and voila, you have a winning combination.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: What about claims 1, 2 and\n3?\nMR. HUNGAR: I don't know, Your Honor.\nThose have not been litigated. Those have additional\nlimitations that are not present in claim 4 that,\ndepending on what the prior art might reveal about\nthose, we have no way of knowing whether they would or\nwould not be obvious because obviously, that question\nhas not been litigated. Certainly there is nothing in\nthe record in this case that would suggest they are\nobvious.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What about the experts?\nYou said this was obvious and this should have, not have\ngotten very far. But there were two experts, were there\nnot, who made declarations, that had all kinds of\ncredentials, and they called it elegant, novel and\nnonobvious.\nMR. HUNGAR: Yes, Your Honor. There are two\nproblems with that. Number one, the conclusory\nassertion that an invention is nonobvious, just like the\nassertion that it's obvious from an expert, should have\nno weight because of course --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well these, these were\ndeclarants who gave a whole declaration. They didn't\njust say that bottom line.\nMR. HUNGAR: But again, it's a legal\nquestion. And moreover and more importantly, the\nproblem with the Court of Appeals analysis, one problem,\nand with the experts' analysis, is that they're focusing\non the narrow definition of the quote unquote problem by\nlooking only at what this particular inventor was trying\nto solve, but the scope of the claim is far broader.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Hungar. Mr. Goldstein.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS C. GOLDSTEIN\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Thank you, Mr. Chief\nJustice, and may it please the Court:\nI think the Court will want to have\navailable to it the red brief and also this big, which\nis the supplemental joint appendix which has some of the\npatents in it, and I'm going to quote from both of them.\nI think you can't understand what motivation means and\nwhat the whole test that the Federal Circuit is\nemploying means --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You're right about that.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: -- without --\n(Laughter.)\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: -- without starting from the\nstatute itself. And so I want to start with the\nstatutory text and use that as the jumping off point\nlike the Court of Appeals has for the inquiry that it's\nasking. It's reproduced at page 21 of the red brief.\nAnd Congress said it's the first blocked quote, that a\npatent may not be obtained though the invention is not\nidentically disclosed or described, as set forth in\nSection 102 of this title. Those are the other\nrequirements for giving a patent. If the differences\nbetween the subject matter sought to be patented and the\nprior art are such that the subject matter as a whole\nwould have been obvious at the time the invention was\nmade to a person having ordinary skill in the art. So\nthe term of art here is obvious, and the plain meaning\nof obvious, if you understand that the outcome of this\ncase is obvious or if you think that the, what the\nFederal Circuit means by its test is not obvious, is\nsomething that's either apparent or not apparent, and\nthat's what the Federal Circuit is asking. It says\nlook, take the invention and see whether or not it was\napparent or not apparent, and what the Federal -- to a\nperson of ordinary skill at the time of the invention.\nAnd what the Federal Circuit says is, we want to be\ninclusive.\nThe other side takes these words, teaching,\nsuggestion, motivation, as if they were words of\nlimitation rather than these words of inclusion. And\nwhat the Federal Circuit has said is what we mean by\nteaching a suggestion or a motivation, and it can be\nexplicit or implicit, is anything that would have made\nthis invention apparent to a practitioner at the time.\nThat's what it's after. It wants to know, look, was it\napparent to someone else, a practitioner at the time of\nthe invention of Engelgau to take Asano and put the\nelectronic throttle control on pin --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, if that's all it\nmeans, why don't they say it?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: They do say that.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, then what is this\nword that confused me a lot, motivation? I found a lot\nof enlightenment in Judge Rich's idea of taking all the\nrelevant art and putting it up around the room in\npictures. And then I thought, well, okay, if that art\nteaches me to do what your client did, okay, it doesn't.\nDoes it suggest it? Not really. Well then, you say\nmotivated. Where does that get you?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: I understand. Can I take\nyou to their, the Federal Circuit's answer? It's two\npages before the quote that I just gave you, page 19,\nthere's another blocked quote. The Federal Circuit has\nexplained what it's talking about when it means a\nmotivation. They say that they have repeatedly held\nthat there is an implicit motivation to combine. It\nexists not only when a suggestion may be gleaned from\nthe prior art as a whole, that's a teaching, but when\nthe improvement is technology independent and the\ncombination of references results in a product or\nprocess. And these are common motivations. You would\ndo it because it's more desirable because it's stronger,\ncheaper, faster, lighter, smaller, more durable, more\nefficient.\nJUSTICE BREYER: For who? For me?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: For a practitioner, yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: For me the inventor?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I know that, because\notherwise --\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: No. Justice Breyer, you\ndon't understand.\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's true.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: The question is not -- I can\nillustrate it with this case. The question is not do\nyou want more efficient pedals. If that's the test,\nthen everything is obvious because we always want more\nefficient pedals, Justice, and I'll come back to this.\nIt's always going to be the case that if your test is\ncapability, every patent including the first three\nclaims of this one is going to be obvious, because\nyou're always capable of assembling a pedal. What it\nsays, what the Federal Circuit says, is there a\nmotivation to make this invention? Was there\nmotivation, and this was the heart of the Federal\nCircuit's ruling in this case, their theory is that\nAsano renders our patent obvious. And the Federal\nCircuit said all right, what's the motivation to take\nAsano and take the electronic throttle control and make\nit responsive --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, the claim goes beyond\nthat. Your claim goes beyond the Asano combination and\nin your brief you, you, you discuss the case as though\nyour, your limited claim 4 just relates to this\ninvention that you, you -- nobody would have thought of\nusing the Asano pedal in the Ford car given the limited\nspace available and so forth, and therefore, this was\nreally an invention. But that's not the claim. The\nclaim is simply combining the, any pedal, the Asano\npedal or any other one with the, with the automatic\nelectronic sensor.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: In a particular place, yes,\nthat's correct. Justice Scalia, the reason these\nFederal Circuit judges were right notwithstanding your\ncorrect point which is, just to be clear, our invention\nis not limited to Asano. Our invention takes any fixed\npivot adjustable pedal and any electronic throttle\ncontrol and says combine it in a particular way. The\nFederal Circuit's point is their motion rests on Asano.\nThe other side's theory is, we've got this\ninvention, Engelgau. As has been pointed out, nobody\ndid anything like this for 10 years. The other side\ncomes back and says yes, that it would have been obvious\nto somebody who had an Asano to do the same thing\nbasically. And so the Federal Circuit said okay, show\nus. If this isn't going to be hindsight, where we just\ngive you the invention and you just say oh, I could have\ndone that, they say give us any evidence that someone\nwould have done what you say, which is take Asano, it's\ntheir argument, Asano --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But why Asano?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: You'll have to ask them,\nJustice Scalia. They filed a motion that it was\nobvious.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You're the one that's\nstanding up here making that argument. They're not\ndoing it.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Justice Scalia, the patent\nexaminer gave us a patent, initially rejected this\npatent as obvious, decided that it wasn't after\nconsidering all of these things, a statutory presumption\nof validity attached under Section 282. So we have what\nwe say is clear and convincing evidence, the question\nisn't presented here, but whatever. The other side\ncomes in and tries to knock our patent out. They file a\nmotion, and the motion rests on a piece of prior art.\nAnd so what the Federal Circuit said is, if we're not\ngoing to knock all of these patents out by hindsight,\nall we want to know is one thing and you know, on\nremand, they may well be able to prove it. We don't\nthink they can. But all it's asking for is for the\ndistrict court to make a finding that says the other\nside is right, that it would have been obvious to take\nAsano, which is their only example, and combine it with\nelectronic throttle control in this way. That is what's\nso --\nJUSTICE BREYER: You look at that thing, you\nthink what this genius did, and I don't doubt that he's\na genius, is there are wheels that turn around. And the\nwheels turn around to a fixed proportion to when you\nmake the accelerator go up and down. Now I think since\nhigh school a person has known that if you have three\nparts in a machine and they each move in a fixed ratio\none to the other, you can measure the speed of any part\nby attaching a device to any other as long as you know\nthese elementary mathematics. I suppose it wasn't\nMr. Engelgau, it was probably Archimedes that figured\nthat one out. So he simply looks to something that\nmoves, and he sticks a sticker on it.\nNow to me, I grant you I'm not an expert,\nbut it looks at about the same level as I have a sensor\non my garage door at the lower hinge for when the car is\ncoming in and out, and the raccoons are eating it. So I\nthink of the brainstorm of putting it on the upper\nhinge, okay? Now I just think that how could I get a\npatent for that, and that -- now that's very naive,\nthat's very naive. But the point is, I don't see what\nwe're talking about, and what is supposed to happen with\nall these affidavits. And the -- the -- Mr. Asano\nhimself, I would think at some point when the Ford\ncompany decides to switch to electronic throttles, of\ncourse will have every motivation in the world to do\nprecisely what your client did, because he can't use\nthat thing that pulls back and forth anymore. Rather,\nhe has to get a little electronic cap and attach it to\nsomething that moves in fixed proportion to the\naccelerator going up and down. Now those are my whole\nreactions when I saw this and I began to think it looks\npretty obvious. What's supposed to go on, I don't\nunderstand it.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Okay. Let me answer it in a\nfew different ways because I want to again specify and\nmake clear what it is that the Federal Circuit says is\nincluded within teaching, suggestions, motivations.\nThen I want to turn to our invention and the affidavits\nin the case. The Federal Circuit has said, and I'll\njust -- you can come back to it for future reference.\nIt's recorded at the bottom of page 19 of our brief.\nCommon sense, common knowledge, common understandings\nare all included within teaching, suggestions or\nmotivations.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: It looks like Dystar was\ndecided by the Federal Circuit after it decided this\ncase, didn't it?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes, it did.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I mean, you have to be\ndefending what the Federal Circuit did in this case.\nAnd the fact that they say well now, what this means is\nreally in some other case, that seems to me that's\nreally irrelevant.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: If I could just clarify,\nDystar --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And I think you should\ntell us when the case has been decided after, I think it\nhas much less, much less weight.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Justice Kennedy, I agree\nthat you have to distinguish two things rightly. The\nfirst is the state of the law as it exists now, and\nthat's what we ask you to affirm. And that is, the\nFederal Circuit has made quite clear that its test is\ninclusive, and we think that that establishes that it's\nnot necessary to add some new sort of undetermined test\nof --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You say its test is\ninclusive. I would say its test is meaningless. They\nhave essentially said, our test simply reduces to what,\nwhat your opponents in this litigation say. If you\nthink that's being inclusive, you know -- it doesn't add\nanything whatever to -- to the -- to the question, would\na person of the ordinary skill in this field have\nconceived of this idea.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Justice Scalia, I disagree\nfor the following reasons, and that is: What the\nFederal Circuit is saying is that any amount of\nevidence, any form of evidence is relevant to answer a\nparticular question. We have a question that we want\nanswered. They have a question they want answered.\nTheir question, the petitioner at least, I'm not sure\nabout the Solicitor General, the petitioner's standard\nis, was somebody capable of doing this? We have a\ndifferent question. Would it have been apparent to, and\nthat's what we think the text requires, would it have\nbeen apparent to one skilled in the art? And so the\nFederal Circuit is saying whatever evidence you want to\nbring to bear --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Don't you think there's a\ngrammatical difference in the meaning of the word\nobvious and the meaning of the word apparent?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: No, I don't.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: So you're saying that the\nquestion is whether it's obvious?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes, that's right. And what\nthe Federal Circuit is saying, you have -- what it's\nsaying is, if you just look to capability, and that is,\ncould you put Asano together on pin 54, you will miss\nthe most important part of invention. And that is,\ninvention isn't at the end when you put the two things\ntogether. Invention is finding the problem, deciding\nwhat pieces of the prior art to use, and deciding how to\nput them together. Everybody is always capable of, it\nwill always be the case, I think, that a practitioner of\nthe art can put them together. Remember the very point\nof a patent, when you look at our patent at the end of\nthe case, we were required to explain it in great\ndetail.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes, but your -- the\nFederal Circuit is saying that, the gist of it is if and\nonly if the previous patents taught this. But you, you\ncan look at these two devices, and you're a good\nmechanic, you've never seen a patent, you've never read\nthese patents, you've never read these claims, you've\nnever been to the Supreme Court, and you put them\ntogether.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Justice Kennedy, that's\nnot --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And the Federal Circuit\nsaid oh, it's not in the patent, it's not obvious.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Justice Kennedy, with\nrespect, that is not a fair description of the Federal\nCircuit's test, and I will take you to the language that\naddressed this claim. It's at the bottom of page 18 of\nour brief and also at the top of 19, and we quote the\nSolicitor General's brief. The Solicitor General\nasserts to the contrary, that Federal Circuit precedent\nfocuses attention exclusively on a search for teaching,\nsuggestions and motivations in the prior art. That is\nnot accurate. That was a quote from their brief.\nHere is a quote from the Solicitor General.\nIt is from a new opinion of the Federal Circuit, but it\nis quoting, it is citing a series of old opinions from\nthe Federal Circuit. Under our nonrigid motivation,\nsuggestion, teaching test, a suggestion to combine need\nnot be found in the prior art. And then there is the\nblocked quote that I read to Justice Breyer about making\nthings cheaper, faster, lighter, common knowledge and\ncommon sense.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, once you define the\nteaching, suggestion and motivation test that way so\nthat it can be implicit, it can be based on common\nsense, I don't quite understand the difference between\nthat and simply asking whether it's obvious. Could you\njust explain what that adds?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Well, all that it adds is an\nanalytical framework. It's an elaboration. The word\n\"obvious\" --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It adds a layer of\nFederal Circuit jargon that lawyers can then bandy back\nand forth, but if it's -- particularly if it's\nnonexclusive, you can say you can meet our teaching,\nsuggestion, or motivation test or you can show that it's\nnonobvious, it seems to me that it's worse than\nmeaningless because it complicates the inquiry rather\nthan focusing on the statute.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Mr. Chief Justice, the\nreason that the Federal Circuit disagrees and over 30\nyears this special court has elaborated this problem --\nthese judges alone, for example, have heard 300 cases on\nnonobviousness -- is that we need a guidance, we need\nguidance for the lower courts. We need to focus them on\nthe right question, and for patent examiners and patent\npractitioners, and the right question is not is -- was\nsomeone merely capable of putting the two together. The\nright question is is there any reason to believe that it\nwould have been apparent at the time of the invention to\ncreate this invention whether it's through a teaching, a\nsuggestion, a motivation.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Or anything else.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Or anything else.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So why don't you say that?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: They have.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It is -- I agree with the\nChief Justice. It is misleading to say that the whole\nworld is embraced within these three nouns, teaching,\nsuggestion, or motivation, and then you define teaching,\nsuggestion, or motivation to mean anything that renders\nit nonobvious. This is gobbledygook. It really is,\nit's irrational.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Justice Scalia, I this it\nwould be surprising for this experienced Court and all\nof the patent bar -- remember, every single major patent\nbar association in the country has filed on our side --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, which way does\nthat cut? That just indicates that this is profitable\nfor the patent bar.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Mr. Chief Justice, it turns\nout that actually is not accurate.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It produces more patents,\nwhich is what the patent bar gets paid for, to acquire\npatents, not to get patent applications denied but to\nget them granted. And the more you narrow the\nobviousness standard to these three imponderable nouns,\nthe more likely it is that the patent will be granted.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Justice Scalia, that is not\nthe point of these bar associations' either. These bar\nassociations, including the American Bar Association,\nthe American Intellectual Property Law Association, have\nlawyers on both sides of all these cases. They're\nlooking for a test that has balance and that is what the\nFederal Circuit has done. Now, let me just say --\nJUSTICE BREYER: As you know, we've had a\nseries of cases and in these series of cases we have\nreceived many, many briefs from all kinds of\norganizations and there are many from various parts of\nthe patent bar that defend very much what the Federal\ncircuit does and there are many from parts of the patent\nbar and others who are saying basically that they've\nleaned too far in the direction of never seeing a patent\nthey didn't like and that has unfortunate implications\nfor the economy. So if you're going to these very basic\ndeep issues, is there a reason for me to think, which I\ndo now think, that there is a huge argument going on in\nthose who are interested in patent as to whether there\nis too much protectionism and not enough attention paid\nto competition or whether it's about right, or whether\nit goes some other way.\nIn other words, your argument now suggests\nall this is well settled, but I tend to think maybe it\nisn't well settled and maybe it is a proper thing for us\nto be involved in. So what are your views since you\nbrought it up?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Justice Breyer, there is a\nbig debate over whether or not there is too much\npatenting in this country and Congress is involved in\nthe debate. What I don't think that there is that much\ndebate about is whether a properly applied test that the\nFederal Circuit has articulated strikes the right\nbalance, because that is why all of the patent bar\nassociations have filed on our side, I think, and that\nis it takes account of the interests of both sides and\nthat is it says, you're right, we have to be concerned\nabout overpatenting, it says on the other hand we have\nto be very concerned about hindsight determinations of\nobviousness.\nBut I do want to just step back and make a\npoint about judicial administration. If the ultimate\nconclusion of this Court is that teaching, suggestion,\nmotivation just boils down into an inquiry into\nobviousness, I still think that an opinion that says\nthat and says that it, that this Court believes that it\nis embracing the bottom line of what the Federal Circuit\nhas been doing, is the one that will be much better for\nthe patent system and for the courts, because we have a\nreal concern and that was articulated -- asked about at\nleast by Justice Ginsburg and Justice Scalia, and that\nis if you purport to change the rules unnecessarily, if\nyou say we're going off in a different direction, this\ntest has -- underlies 160,000 patents issued every year.\nThere is no rhyme or reason to applying a presumption of\nvalidity if you're saying the patent examiner applied\nthe wrong test. And it will create genuine dramatic\ninstability.\nThe question I think is if you think instead\nthat the teaching, suggestion, motivation test is\nincomplete, what is it that you want to add on top of\nit, and that's really what I didn't understand from the\nfirst half-hour. If it's going to be --\nJUSTICE BREYER: It doesn't have to go on\ntop. It's just to say what you've been saying, that\nwhat you're supposed to look to ultimately is whether a\nperson, as the statute says, who is familiar with the\nsubject, of ordinary skill in the art, whether to such a\nperson this would have been obvious. Now, there are\nmany, and this Court has listed several, factors that\nmight count in favor of it not being obvious, such as\npeople have been trying to do it for a long time and\nthey haven't been able to figure out how. That's a good\none, and there are some other ones here. If there's a\nteaching right there, it seems to cut the other way.\nBut to hope to have a nonexclusive list\nseems to me a little bit like Holmes trying to hope to\nhave an exclusive list of what counts as negligence. In\nthe law we have many standards that you can get clues\nabout, but you can't absolutely define them, and why\nisn't this one of them?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Justice Breyer, I think\nthat's the dilemma that the Federal Circuit has been\nfacing and is in answer to the criticism of Justice\nScalia and that is the Federal Circuit isn't trying to\narticulate every single possible thing that can show you\nthat it is obvious. What it's trying to do is focus you\non the right question. It's trying to say, here's the\nprocess of invention: We have to figure out there's a\nproblem. We have to figure out what prior art you're\ngoing to use. You have to figure out how you're going\nto combine it, and then you actually combine it.\nThe act of invention, the thing that is the\ndiscovery that we want to encourage, is there in the\nmiddle. It's picking out the prior art and deciding how\nto put it together.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Supposing we then were to\nsay exactly what this Court already said, that the\nstandard here is obvious, we list a few of these\nadditional factors that they've thrown in, and just as\nthe Court said before, all these additional factors are\nthere. They can be considered in an appropriate case,\nbut it is important to remember that the ultimate matter\nwhich is for the judge is to apply the word \"obvious\" or\nnot in light of the evidence and what the experts say\nand the facts as found by a jury or whoever is the\nfactfinder. Would you have any objection to an opinion\nlike that.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: No.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well then, in this case\nlet's assume that we all strike out on coming out with\nthe magic formulation. One of the ways the law\nprogresses is we go from case to case, and in this case\nyou have two standards of operation. One is a pedal\nthat basically operates by pressure. The other -- and\nby levers. Other is by electronics, and these are two\ndifferent methods of making the carburetor release the\nfuel. So why not, so somebody combines them. Why is\nthat such a big deal as, as claim 4 says it is.\nCertainly this inventor would not be the only one to\nthink that the two could and should be combined.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Justice Kennedy, that's\nabsolutely right, and I just want to focus you on why it\nis you now think I lose. We don't lose because that's\nnot our invention. The Federal Circuit's point was that\nthat this invention, claim 4, does not put an electronic\nthrottle control together with an adjustable pedal.\nIt's do it in a particular way. And let me take you in\nsummary judgment in this case to the declarations and\nexplain why it is that the experts here said you would\nnot have done this. And I just have to urge the Court\nto cross the t's and dot the i's here and pay particular\nattention to exactly what it is that we claimed and\nexactly what it is that they said rendered our patent\nobvious.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Where in claim 4 do\nyou say it's putting it together in a particular way?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Mr. Chief Justice, if I can\ntake you to the big book that I asked you to --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right, page 8.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Page 8, exactly. And that\nis, there are six different pieces to claim 4 and I'm\ngoing to take you to the relevant one. And they are the\nlast two paragraphs here. We claim an electronic\ncontrol attached to the support, so we specify where the\nelectronic control is going to be. And then we say\nwhere, what that electronic control is going to be\nresponsive to, and that's the next paragraph: Said\napparatus characterized by said electronic control being\nresponsive to said pivot, and that said pivot is defined\nabove to be a fixed pivot. So here is the design.\nLet me take you to a picture if I could, and\nthat's going to be at the back of the red brief.\nEngelgau is the third foldout page. It looks like this.\nWhat we say is there is going to be a fixed pivot. It's\nthe red pivot in our picture, and there's going to be an\nelectronic throttle control. That's actually on the --\nyou can't see it because you're looking straight at the\ndevice. That's on the next page. It's in green.\nThere's going to be an electronic throttle control and\nit's going to respond to that pivot.\nSo we specify where we're going to put the\nelectronic throttle, on the support. That's what the\nFederal Circuit recognized was our invention. Now --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Is it basically an\ninvention where in fact there are only four or five\nmoving parts on the thing that we have seen, every one\nof the moving parts is moving with a fixed ratio to the\naccelerator going up and down, as it must be because\nthey're also moving in fixed ratio with the throttle\nthing coming out. And so, whichever of those four that\nyou figured out you were going to attach it to, it's\nobvious, isn't it, that you have to attach it either to\nthe pedal or to the throttle thing that comes out, or to\na part of the machine that moves in fixed ratio to the\nmovements of one of those two? Now, that's what I would\nfind fairly obvious. Why isn't that obvious?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: All right. Let me, Justice\nBreyer. The experts say it's not obvious and the reason\nnobody did it for 12 years and the reason that Asano was\nnever combined with an electronic throttle control is\nexplained in the record in this case and it's twofold.\nThe first is, and I have to take you now to the picture\nof Asano because that's what the claim that is supposed\nto make our invention obvious is. They say you would\nhave done this with Asano. What the experts say is this\nAsano thing, no one would ever use it at all.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Who do you get to be\nan expert to tell you something's not obvious.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: You get --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I mean, the least\ninsightful person you can find?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Mr. Chief Justice, we got a\nPh.D. and somebody who had worked in pedal design for 25\nyears.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Exactly.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: And people who actually know\nthis industry. And they, there are two things that come\nfrom the record in this case. The first is all of the\nexperts and Engelgau himself testified not simply, no,\nthis is not obvious, but you would have never used Asano\nto solve this or any other problem with an electronic\nthrottle control.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. You keep coming\nback to Asano. Why do you keep coming back? Your claim\nhere does not say anything about Asano.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Justice Scalia, the way\nthese cases are litigated, and properly so, is the other\nside says this would be obvious in light of a particular\npiece or collection of prior art. You may have a\nnonprior art motivation to combine them, but you're\ngoing to say something else already exists. They say\nit's Asano, and you're going to combine it with\nsomething else. This is their motion. Their argument,\nthe argument that was presented to the Federal Circuit,\nwas that you would take Asano. That's why --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I think they happened to\nuse Asano simply because that's what you stuck it on.\nBut I think their basis, their basic point, is anybody\nwould have thought to stick it on, whether it's stick it\non Asano or stick it onto some other mechanical\naccelerator mechanism.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Well, that is not -- we did\nnot stick it on Asano. Nobody stuck it on Asano. They\npicked Asano because it was the prior art of adjustable\npedal designs.\nJustice Scalia, you --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's because\nthe Federal Circuit's approach focuses narrowly prior to\nour grant of certiorari, allegedly more flexibly after,\non prior art, as opposed.\nTo I would say common sense. And so they\nsay we have to find something in prior art to show that\nthis was non -- that this was obvious.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Mr. Chief Justice, that's\nnot correct. Even under a capability standard, even\nunder an extraordinary innovation standard, you are\ngoing to compare something to prior art. You're going\nto take what exists now and compare it to what existed\nbefore, no matter what standard you're employing. And\nwhat they did is they compared it to the prior art,\nwhich is Asano, and the Federal Circuit said, all right,\nyou want to say it will come from Asano. It would not\ncome from Asano for either of two reasons.\nThe first is you would never use Asano.\nThat's the expert testimony. The second is the reason\ngiven by the PTO in its brief in this case and that is\nyou wouldn't put it on the pin that would render\nEngelgau obvious. You would put it somewhere else.\nThey say that you would put it attached to a lever up\nhigh. What I want to make clear is two things. The\nfirst is, though the Federal Circuit has in recent\nopinions been quite emphatic about how inclusive its\ntest is, it has consistently cited earlier Federal\nCircuit precedent and said that the other side and the\npeople who claimed that their standard is too narrow and\nmisguided are mischaracterizing it. And the second is,\nthe judgment in this case quite explicitly acknowledges\nand implies the implicit teaching, suggestion,\nmotivation standard.\nSo I don't want you to have the mistaken\nimpression that there has been some radical change in\nFederal Circuit law. But no matter what one thinks\nabout the differential between Federal Circuit law today\nand Federal Circuit law a year ago or two years ago,\nthere is a quite considerable cost by articulating a\ndesire to head off in a new direction, because there\nwill be dramatic instability in the patent system, the\nincalculable investments that underlie current patents.\nThere is nothing fundamentally not functional about how\nthe Federal Circuit is approaching this question. It\nhas had decades to look at this to try and elaborate a\nstandard. This court in cases like Sakraida and --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And it so quickly modified\nitself.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And in the last year or so,\nafter we granted cert in this case after these decades\nof thinking about it, it suddenly decides to polish it\nup.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Justice Scalia, if you\nactually believe that, then you just don't believe the\njudges in the Federal Circuit because in each of these\nopinions they say quite explicitly we are not changing\nit.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Would you dispute that in\nsome of the earlier cases, like Dembiczak with the\ngarbage bag that looks like a pumpkin, that this TSM\ntest was applied in a way that seemed to ask for\nsomething quite explicit in the prior art?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: I do think that you can find\noutliers. I think that's fair. These judges as I said\nhave heard 300 of these cases. There are mistakes in\nthe Patent Office; there are mistakes by judges. The\nFederal Circuit explains in Dembiczak what it was\nactually looking for is an explanation. It wasn't\nsaying that you had to use the prior art, and it has\ntried to make quite clear that the law is not that you\nhave to have prior art. Or that those decisions here\ntoday.\nYou can't take, in a system that produces so\nmany patents, and say ah, look at this side swing\npatent, or the garbage bags, and draw from that the\nconclusion that the system is fundamentally broken.\nJustice Breyer, I meant to come back to\nthat. We can look through the studies, we cite a series\nof empirical studies in our brief that have looked at\nthis problem, the rhetorical claim that the obviousness\nrule is leading to gross over-patenting.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Tell me again, just to be\nsure I have it my -- tell me very briefly, what it is\nthat makes this invention nonobvious?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Two things. The first is --\nand they do arise from the other side's motion under\nAsano. First you wouldn't have chosen Asano. The\nsecond is the Federal Circuit explained -- excuse me,\nthe Solicitor General explains that you would have put\nthe electronic throttle control somewhere else,\ntechnically on what's called pivot 60, which would not,\nwould have rendered, would have not have rendered\nEngelgau obvious.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: The invention, to use an\nold-fashioned term, is the decision of where to put the\ncontrol.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: That is the extent of the\nentire invention.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And just -- what\nmakes it nonobvious is that it's attached to a nonmoving\npiece?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: An adjustable pedal that has\na nonmoving pivot, yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But the claim doesn't\nrequire that.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes it does. It does. I\npromise.\n(Laughter.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But just to follow\nup from Justice Stevens' question, what makes this\nnonobvious is the decision to place the electronic\ncontrol on a part of the car that doesn't move?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: On the support --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: And then a particular kind\nof adjustable pedal. That's the state of the record so\nfar.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I'm sorry. Doesn't the\naxis turn?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Does the pivot turn?\nJUSTICE BREYER: Isn't there an axis, and\nthe axis turns?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: The pivot rotates?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: The pivot rotates, but it\ndoesn't -- the difference is that the pivot doesn't move\nwith the adjustment of the pedal. It spins around, of\ncourse, you have to have something that you can -- but\nthe prior art, almost all that involved a pivot that\nwhen the pedal moved out, the electronic throttle\ncontrol would go with it.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And the wires would\nget worn, worn down, right? And the invention here is\nwell, let's not put it somewhere where it doesn't move,\nand so the wires won't move and it won't get worn down.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: That would be a motivation.\nThat's absolutely right, why you would want to improve\non the part. The Federal Circuit said that you would\nnever do it in the way that was described here. You may\nbe able to prove it some other way on a remand. This\nwas a very specific motion, and the Federal Circuit\nfaithfully addressed the claim of obviousness that was\npresented to it.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you.\nMr. Dabney, you have three minutes remaining but you may\ntake four.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT BY JAMES W. DABNEY\nON BEHALF OF PETITIONER\nMR. DABNEY: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nAs someone who tries patent cases, there is\nno legal regime that is a greater generator of patent\nlitigation than the teaching suggestion motivation test\nthat is urged by the respondent. Where in this\nunbelievable situation where, in the District Court,\nthis Court's precedents were cited, were not followed.\nIn the Court of Appeals, this Court's precedents in\nAnderson's-Black Rock and others were cited, not\ndistinguished, followed at all.\nIf the law of this Court had been applied in\nthe District Court I wouldn't be standing here right\nnow. The reason that we have this, this proceeding\ngoing on is because of this extraordinary situation,\nwhere notwithstanding that this Court has issued\nprecedents in a variety of circumstances dealing with\nmultiple technologies, lots of different kinds of\ndifferences, lots of different kinds of alleged\ninnovation, they are simply not paid attention to in the\ncorpus of the Federal Circuit's case law up until about\na month ago.\nSo the, this Court could do no greater\nservice to the actual process of determining whether\nclaimed subject matter does and does not comply with the\nstatute than to decide with case. The worst possible\nthing that can happen in this case is for the case not\nto end here, and for the Court not to provide a\nprecedent as it has done in so many particular past\ncases, and give the public an example of a particular\nclaim and a particular difference that does not meet the\nstandard.\nWhat's made clear throughout the history of\npatent decisionmaking is that no verbal formula is ever\ngoing to get you there. What we have as a functional\napproach; it's not as opposing counsel suggests -- is\n\"it\" apparent, is \"it\" obvious, would it have been\nobvious to do \"it?\"\nWhat this Court has held over and over again\nstarting with the doorknob case in 1851 is to pose a\nproblem. Would it have --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: What about in this case\nwhere the wires were getting frayed until this\ndisclosure?\nMR. DABNEY: That's not, if you read the\naffidavits carefully that is not an accurate\ncharacterization of -- of any evidence put in by the\npetitioner. That was an argument --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So suppose I read the\nrecord the other way. Suppose I read the record as\nsaying this invention stopped the wires from being\nfrayed and therefore it was an advance.\nMR. DABNEY: That would be, to the extent\nthat that -- if that is established that could be taken\ninto consideration along with other facts.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Why would that be? I mean,\nI've worked out that the raccoons are gnawing the\nmachine, at the bottom of the garage door and that's a\nproblem. So I move it to the top of the garage door.\nDoes that suddenly -- nobody before thought of moving it\nto the top of the garage door; nobody before had thought\nof moving it to a different part that moves in a\nconstant ratio with the accelerator.\nMR. DABNEY: What the statute calls for,\nJustice Kennedy, is not to focus on a particular\nsubjective problem like fitting into a Ford F 350, or\nparticular difference between a prior art pedal that\nprovides wire chafing and a claimed invention. The law\nhas always required that the patentability be determined\nby the smallest amount of difference. So if it were\ntrue that there was wire chafing, that that was a\nproblem that would have had to have been overcome, if\nyou started with a prior art pedal that, that provided\nfor wires to move -- well then, maybe that combination\nwould not make the claimed subject matter obvious.\nBut that would not foreclose the defendant\nfrom saying well, this other technology over here that\ndoesn't suffer from that problem, it's a simple matter\nto modify that, so the premise of the question, that\nbecause there is some other potential combination that\nmight have been, might have been more difference or less\nreason to modify it than the one that's relied on by the\npetitioner, is legally not material to the decision in\nthis case.\nSo I respectfully submit that the -- I\nreally have to emphasize this. I mean, this is a\nlitigation between, you know, two real businesses. The\njustified expectations, Justice Souter that I think this\nCourt has recognized over and over again, are the\nexpectations of real innovators, who make real products\nand have real inventions. And -- and I think it would\ncome as a great surprise to the owner of the Asano\npatent to find as Justice Breyer suggested, that in\norder to supply it to a modern vehicle maker it would\nhave to pay tribute to the Engelgau patent.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel.\n"
