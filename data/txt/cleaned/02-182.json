WALBERT\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. WALBERT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nFor some 6 decades now, the policy of the United\nStates has been to embrace integration, reject segregation\nand separation of people. We stand -- really, the Nation\nof the United States of America stands pretty much as the\nbeacon in the world to the notion that balkanization is\nnot the way to go.\npublic life, integration, working together, not separating\npeople on the basis of race is our goal.\nThis Court started that trend, that great trend,\nin the early -- in the 1940s with the original decisions\nof Smith versus Allright, putting aside segregation, the\npast history of that in this country, the ICC, Interstate\nCommerce Commission desegregation decisions, Brown versus\nBoard of Education, voting rights cases, jury cases, and\nso on. And the policy of the United States, as this\nCourt was the leader on that at all times, has always\nbeen -- has been for integration, for treating people the\nsame independent of their color.\nCongress followed behind this Court, started\nadopting some of the early Civil Rights Act in the early\n1950s, the more moderate ones, if you will, under -- under\nPresident Eisenhower's administration, and of course, the\ngreat Civil Rights Act of 1964 was enacted. 1965, Voting\nRights was enacted; and the 1968 Open Housing Act.\nThroughout that entire time, the policy of\nintegration has been the policy that this Nation has\nembraced and espoused and advocated. And I would submit\nto Your Honors respectfully that the State of Georgia --\nthe position the State of Georgia puts before this Court\nin this case today stands four square in the center of\nthat tradition.\nGeorgia comes here to this Court today\nadvocating that politics should be open and integrated.\nPolitics should not have allocations unnecessarily, in\nparticular, of seats based on race. I would submit to\nthis Court that what we say is totally consistent with\neverything this Court has said that touches upon this\nmatter and in this particular regard.\nQUESTION: Could we bring it down to what we\nhave to decide here, which is whether there was\nretrogression or not?\nMR. WALBERT: Yes, Justice O'Connor, and I was\ngoing -- excuse me.\nQUESTION: And on that, do we look at the whole\nState and what would happen overall, or do we just focus\non individual legislative senatorial districts?\nMR. WALBERT: Well, I think you look at both,\nand when you look at the whole plan of redistricting, then\nyou go down to look at the district. You can't do one\nwithout the other. One looks at, first of all, the whole\nplan and sees if opportunities are the same in terms of\nmajority and minority seats, for example, or opportunities\nwhere minorities have a real opportunity get election, and\nsees whether that, under the whole plan, is the same and\nwhether that's been maintained.\nAnd to do that, though, one has to look --\nQUESTION: Well, what -- what ended up deciding\nthis case apparently was the fact that in three of the\ndistricts that were drawn for the Senate, the number of\nblack voters decreased under the new plan from what it had\nbeen, and they had been very safe districts --\nMR. WALBERT: Yes, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: -- assured of electing black\nofficials before, and it was reduced to around 50 percent.\nIs that right?\nMR. WALBERT: That's correct. The -- the\nlikelihood of winning -- the -- the black voter age\npopulation was reduced to about 50 percent --\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. WALBERT: -- which according to the\nevidence, would give about a 75 percent chance of a\nminority candidate of choice winning in that particular\ndistrict.\nQUESTION: And was that the finding of the court\nbelow?\nMR. WALBERT: The finding was that safe seats --\nthe rule of law was that safe seats must be maintained.\nTo get a safe seat here, one had to raise these 4 to\n5 percent.\nQUESTION: Is --\nQUESTION: So that's the --\nQUESTION: Is -- is that one of the ways, at\nleast, that you think we ought to view this case? As I\nunderstand it, no one on the other side is claiming that\nthe percentage of safety has got to be maintained in order\nto avoid retrogression.\nBut one difference between you and them, at\nleast as I am reading what you're saying, is you, I think,\nare saying they maintain the same opportunity to elect.\nMinorities maintain the same opportunity to elect if they\nuse their best efforts and their good politicians in doing\nit. Whereas, the other side seems to be saying, there's\ngot to be more of a margin of safety for maintaining -- or\navoiding retrogression than merely best efforts. There\nshould be some margin of safety, even if it's not as great\nas it used to be under the old districts. Is that a fair\nway of looking at the disagreement?\nMR. WALBERT: I -- I think it understates it a\nlittle bit, in all due respect, Justice Souter, because I\nthink the district court came squarely down. If you look\nat the majority opinions -- and both Judge Sullivan and\nJudge Edwards wrote ones that were concurred in about each\nother -- and Judge Oberdorfer's decision, the line is safe\nseats. One must maintain safe seats. And I think the\nonly way that those can be looked at in this case is that\nall of the evidence is -- when you get to that level, no\none has ever -- on an open seat in Georgia, no one's ever\nlost a 54 percent BVAP seat.\nQUESTION: Mr. Walbert, I didn't get that\nimpression from Judge Edwards' opinion or Judge\nSullivan's. They both say we are dealing with a narrow\nsection 5. It has a concept, retrogression, backsliding.\nAnd I assume that they would say if you start out, you\nstart with the status quo. Everyone agrees with that. If\nyou start out with, say, 30 percent and you end up with\n30 percent, it's okay. You don't have to have a safe\ndistrict because the starting point may not be safe.\nMR. WALBERT: I -- I agree entirely with that,\nYour Honor. I didn't mean to suggest that they are\nrequiring more than that. The fact is that these\ndistricts that evolved demographically from the 1990\nCensus, when two more districts under the old districting\nplan became majority minority, became high BVAP -- let's\ntake Senate District 26, for example.\nQUESTION: Well, is it -- are you saying that\nwhen you get up over a certain number of black voters,\nsay, 50 percent, then retrogression or backsliding is\nreally out of the picture because it's good enough?\nMR. WALBERT: Well, I would say this. Where you\nhave a real equal opportunity at winning the seat, that is\nenough.\nQUESTION: Yes, but that's the -- that's the\nconclusion, and we're -- we're looking for some kind of\nindication at this point of whether that is true. And the\nonly indication that at least I have and I think that\nJustice Ginsburg is -- is looking at right now are -- are\nthe percentage figures, the BVAP percentage figures.\nMR. WALBERT: Well, I think this, Your Honor. I\nmean, the -- the court accepted Dr. Epstein's probability\ncurve all over -- any number of times. I think it was on\npage 36 the first time. Dr. Epstein's evidence is -- his\nstudy is reliable and relevant is what the court says in\nthat regard. And I guess the critical thing is that was\nthe only evidence in this case, plus the legislators who\ntestified, and -- and Congressman Lewis who testified\nabout the likelihood of winning at a 50 percent BVAP\nlevel.\nQUESTION: Let -- let me ask you this because\nsome of what you say might be explained as just a\ndifference of -- of -- a conclusion of facts, which we\nhave to accept. Were there legal premises that the\nmajority opinions adopted below that were wrong? Was it\nwrong to talk about robust campaigning? Was it wrong to\nconsider polarized voting? Were there -- did the\ncontrolling opinions make reference to any impermissible\nlegal standards?\nMR. WALBERT: Well, I think the bottom line\nstandard of safe seat is the problem that we have. I'm\nnot sure that -- they didn't speak of robust campaigning,\nwith all due respect, Justice Kennedy. It was robust\ndistricts, meaning -- they equated that with safe. And\nthe -- the point -- that is the legal issue. That is the\nfundamental legal flaw in the opinion of the majority\nbelow that we take issue with, the fact that one must\nmaintain safe seats and --\nQUESTION: What's -- what's the legal issue?\nMR. WALBERT: That --\nQUESTION: That is, I -- I thought there's a\nstatute, and the statute here says that you cannot have a\nnew plan which will have the effect of abridging the right\nto vote on account of race.\nMR. WALBERT: Yes, sir.\nQUESTION: And Judge Edwards says that that\nstatute has been interpreted to mean you cannot backslide,\nand he adds that if you go from a safe seat to a seat\nwhere there's only a fair opportunity, that is clearly\nbacksliding unless it's made up for in other districts.\nLet's call it frontsliding. And here there is no evidence\nof frontsliding, and here there are two experts who\ndisagree as to the backsliding. One is Epstein who thinks\nthere isn't, and the other is Engstrom --\nMR. WALBERT: Well --\nQUESTION: -- who thinks there is. And two\njudges below agreed with Engstrom and one judge below\nagreed with Epstein.\nMR. WALBERT: I --\nQUESTION: Now, are we supposed to do -- to go\nback and redo the work of those three judges and say,\nwell, we happen to think Epstein was better or the other\none thinks Engstrom was better? Is that this -- what this\ncase is about? And if it isn't about this, I don't know\nwhat it's about.\nMR. WALBERT: Well, first, that's not what\nhappened in the record. Professor Engstrom gave no\ntestimony. There was no testimony but from our side of\nthe case about the likelihood of winning. Professor\nEngstrom came in and said there is racially polarized\nvoting, and he criticized that and the Department\ncriticized it, and it was relied upon. But the African\nAmerican candidates were winning in election after\nelection after election in which he said there is a\nproblematic racially polarized voting.\nQUESTION: I -- I'm overstating what I say for\npurposes of clarity, because you're giving a view of\nEngstrom, and I'm sure the other side will give a somewhat\ndifferent view, but nonetheless, I want to know what it is\nI'm supposed to do as a judge in this Court.\nAfter reading it, I thought what you're asking\nme to do is to go back, look at what Judge Edwards and the\nother majority judge cite as convincing, factual, detailed\nstatistical evidence, look at the evidence of the\npolitical figures who are very distinguished whom Judge\nOberdorfer cites the other way, and remake that evaluation\nthat three judges of -- of a three-judge district court\ndid. Now, my question is, is that right? Have it got it\nright what you think we should do in this case?\nMR. WALBERT: No, you do not.\nQUESTION: All right. Good. Then what is it\nI'm supposed to do?\nMR. WALBERT: The rule of law that was\nestablished here by the majority of having to maintain --\nhaving to maintain a safe seat. There's no question\nthey're not saying you have to create one if there wasn't\none, but the question is, do you have to maintain a seat\nthat's safe?\nQUESTION: All right. Why -- if that's the\nissue, assuming that the safe seat, going down to only a\nprobable seat, is nowhere made up for by countervailing\nfactors elsewhere in the State, assuming that, why isn't\ngoing from a safe seat to a fair probability seat -- why\nis that not backsliding, retrogression, other things being\nequal, an abridgement, a -- the effect of abridging the\nright to vote because of race?\nMR. WALBERT: Well --\nQUESTION: Why isn't it? It if that's the\nissue, why isn't it?\nMR. WALBERT: There's two reasons. And -- and\nfirst of all, no one disagrees that lowering\nthe percentage and the likelihood down -- the -- we're\nnot -- no one in this case, including the district court,\nsays you can't lower the probabilities. So what Your\nHonor is saying is a position more extreme than what the\nmajority says below.\nQUESTION: I'm reading -- I'll say it again\nbecause I'm reading from Judge Edwards. Going from a safe\ndistrict --\nMR. WALBERT: Yes, sir.\nQUESTION: -- into one where there is only a\nfair opportunity, that -- that, he says, other things\nbeing equal in the State, will constitute retrogression in\neffect, not necessarily in purpose, but in effect. And\nnow, why isn't that so?\nMR. WALBERT: And -- and my point is that he is\nconceding that dropping down from a certain seat to a safe\nseat is okay. Now, how does that -- how can that possibly\nsquare to the notion of retrogression?\nin this courtroom, including the majority below, that\nthere can be decreases in the likelihood of success. The\nonly question in this Court -- in this case is where do\nyou draw the line? Safe or equal seats?\nSafe is just out of the air. Never before in\nthe history of this Court has anyone ever said safe is\nthe -- is the Plimsoll line or the water line beyond which\nyou cannot drop.\nQUESTION: You're drawing a distinction between\nsafe and certain. Now, did --\nMR. WALBERT: Well, safe is --\nQUESTION: Did Judge Edwards --\nMR. WALBERT: And that's what the -- and the\ncourt is acknowledging that there is a drop for sure. The\ncourt said --\nQUESTION: A drop that makes no difference.\nThat's -- that's how I understood their opinion.\nMR. WALBERT: I don't think that could be,\nbecause --\nQUESTION: A safe seat is a safe seat. It means\na certain seat.\nMR. WALBERT: No, it doesn't in this case, Your\nHonor, because when you get to the levels they're talking\nabout, there is still a possibility for sure, whether it's\n20 percent or whatever, but that's a real possibility.\nQUESTION: But I didn't think we're dealing with\nsafe versus certain in this case. I thought what we're\ndealing in this case is two judges decided that dropping\nfrom safe to whatever you want to characterize this\nlevel -- Edwards characterizes it as fair probability, but\ncharacterize it as you wish -- dropping from safe to this\nlevel, however you want to characterize this, is a\nretrogression. And one judge thought it wasn't given the\ncircumstances.\nSo what is it that you, aside from re-evaluating\nthe evidence, believe that we should say?\nMR. WALBERT: They used different legal\nstandards, with all due respect, Justice Breyer.\nQUESTION: And what is that difference?\nMR. WALBERT: Safe versus equal. That is the\ndifference in the legal standards between the majority\nand -- and the decision below.\nQUESTION: Or why is Edwards' standard in your\nopinion wrong?\nMR. WALBERT: Because I think it's inconsistent\nwith what this Court has said on section 5 before. And if\nI might read several of the -- just a sentence. And I'm\ngoing to start with Justice Marshall, who was the most\naggressive interpreter and advocate of what section 5\nwould mean.\nStates versus Mississippi in 1980, he three times\naddressed what section 5 requires in a retrogression\ncontext.\nAnd he said in the first thing, it requires a\nreasonable opportunity to elect a candidate of their\nchoice. That is what a district had to be maintained like\nunder Justice Marshall's interpretation of section 5.\nThat's on page 1055 of that decision.\nAgain, on the next -- on page 1057, Justice\nMarshall says, the numbers must be sufficient to provide,\nquote, a fair opportunity to elect candidates, unquote.\nQUESTION: That sounds very much like section 2\nlanguage.\nMR. WALBERT: And -- and that's in section 5\nunder Justice Marshall is all I'm saying, Your Honor,\nbecause this issue that is in this case today has never\nbeen squarely put before this Court. But all the prior\nlanguage of the Court interpreting, where does section 5\nkick in when there is still fair, equal districts.\nQUESTION: I thought that the Bossier, the two\ncases, clarified the difference between section 2 and\nsection 5, and what you just read from Justice Marshall\nsounds to me like the section 2 standard.\nMR. WALBERT: Well --\nQUESTION:\nwhat you have, you look to see if there's backsliding.\nMR. WALBERT: I think the problem, though,\nJudge -- and -- and certainly you start with backsliding\nand retrogression, but the question is, where does inquiry\nstop? Truly, you could say at a 100 percent district goes\ndown to 80 percent, the chances clearly change on\nelectoral success, without a doubt. That is inevitable.\nGoes from 100 to 60, 100 to 55. That is a real and\npalpable change. That is okay, according to the district\ncourt, because at least we stopped at safe.\nThat's our problem. We don't think safe is\nwhere you arbitrarily draw the line to stop. No decision\nof this Court ever has suggested that before. So is --\nQUESTION: Well, you start with, say, 55. Where\ndoes backsliding start in your view of section 5?\nMR. WALBERT: In our view of section 5, so long\nas -- if you have a district that is -- that it has at\nleast an equal opportunity, it must be maintained in that\nfashion. If you have a -- a district where minorities\nhave an equal opportunity or better, to prevail and to\ncontrol.\nQUESTION: Well, then how do you fit\nbacksliding, retrogression --\nMR. WALBERT: If you go -- excuse me.\nQUESTION:\nwhat? 44? That's okay because you -- you would have a\nfair opportunity?\nMR. WALBERT: If the evidence in a particular\ncase would show that, that -- you know, we never went\nbelow 50 on anything, so that's not here in this case.\nQUESTION: Although it would seem an unusual\ndefinition of backslide.\nMR. WALBERT: Well, I think the problem is this,\nthough, Your Honor. Where -- what would be the policy\nreason where a section of the Voting Rights Act,\nsection 5, could be construed to mandate a State to\nmaintain something more than what Federal law could\npossibly compel it to under section 2?\nQUESTION: It doesn't contain --\nQUESTION: So -- so what you're saying is --\nQUESTION: It doesn't contain the word\nbacksliding, does it? What -- what's --\nMR. WALBERT: Section 5 does not, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: What's the text that -- that we're\ninterpreting and -- and --\nMR. WALBERT: It's abridge --\nQUESTION: -- interpreting to mean backsliding?\nMR. WALBERT: It's abridge or deny the right to\nvote --\nQUESTION:\nMR. WALBERT: Yes, sir.\nQUESTION: And -- and that has been interpreted\nby some of our opinions to mean that once a certain level\nis reached, you're abridging or denying the right to vote\nif it goes below that level of -- of safety. Is that it?\nMR. WALBERT: That's correct, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: And you --\nQUESTION: And the reason for that is because, I\ngather, historically there were quite a few instances\nwhere, indeed, in the South, you could elect -- a black\nrepresentative was elected by a black community in, let's\nsay, one district. And then, lo and behold, what happens\nis that the district boundaries are changed so that there\nhappened to be a lot fewer black representatives elected\nout of districts that were predominantly black. I take it\nthat's why Congress passed this statute.\nMR. WALBERT: Section 5?\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. WALBERT: No. Congress passed the\nstatute -- section 5 in 1965 because they were concerned\nabout voter registration laws changing after --\nQUESTION: And backsliding so that you had fewer\npeople who were --\nMR. WALBERT: It was -- it was passed to\ndovetail with the literacy test.\npassed.\nQUESTION: So it doesn't really have to do with\nretrogression in your view?\nMR. WALBERT: Sure, it does, as been interpreted\nby this Court since then, but the original reason why it\nwas passed was to fit in with the literacy test.\nQUESTION: So what it -- what it comes down to\nis not a -- is -- is that the State is entitled to take a\nsafe district and make it a district where there's just\na -- an even chance.\nMR. WALBERT: Equal opportunity, yes, Your\nHonor. And -- and our reasoning on that is -- is a simple\nthing. If one looks at it from the other side, and -- and\nwe're not saying section 2 is incorporated in section 5.\nQUESTION: And -- and this cannot be within the\ndefinition of retrogression.\nMR. WALBERT: That's correct, Your Honor. That\ncannot be the abridgement of the right to vote.\nQUESTION: May I ask a sort of a general\nquestion? In any of the analysis, do the -- the judges\ntake into account the likelihood of winning primaries as\nopposed to the likelihood of winning the election itself?\nMR. WALBERT: It's -- it's implicit in what we\ndid because we looked at the whole election scheme.\nEverything that Dr. Epstein did was the whole election.\nDr. Engstrom made no distinction between nonpartisan\nelections, generals, and primaries. He lumped them all\ntogether and treated them in one ball of wax. We\ncertainly did, and our evidence always looked at\nwinning/winning, winning the seat. If you won the primary\nand lost the seat, you're a loser because we're talking\nabout winning the election. That's all we looked at. If\nyou didn't win it, we didn't count it.\nBut the thing that is the most troubling, I\nguess, in this regard that is -- and the reason I looked\nto section 2 is not that section 2 is incorporated in\nhere, but if you assume that section 2 was proved -- that\na plaintiff came in and proved a section 2 violation in\nGeorgia, what would be the high water mark relief that\nthey would get? They would get under Justice Souter's\nopinion for the Court in Johnson versus DeGrandy a\ndistrict with an equal opportunity to prevail. That --\nQUESTION: But we really haven't equated\nsection 2 challenges with section 5 challenges.\nMR. WALBERT: That's correct, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: I know that's what you're arguing,\nbut we have not done that. And we have said that\nsection 5 prevents retrogression. So I think this case\nboils down to what amounts to retrogression.\nMR. WALBERT:\ndue respect here, I believe that the problem with\ninterpreting it to be an absolutist at the safe seat\nlevel, you've got to -- in our opinion -- and we raised\nthe issue, of course -- is a grave constitutional\nquestion. What is the legitimate ends? What is the\nlegitimate ends into -- I think the Court's discussion in\nCity of Boerne versus Florida is the most detailed\ndiscussion recently about section 5 enforcement power\nunder the 14th and section 2 under the 15th -- and\neverybody on the Court agreed with the formulation there.\nThe ends of Congress must be legitimate and the\nends must be related proportionately and with congruence,\nthe -- the remedies that are chosen by Congress. And I\nwould have to say what is -- other than just preserving\nwhat happens to be there -- the only reason we're talking\nabout keeping safe seats is they happen to be there. This\nis not because they're ever put in because of a remedy.\nQUESTION: Is it illegitimate for the State to\ndecide to keep the safe seat if it wants?\nMR. WALBERT: That's a different question\nsurely, but no, I would say it's not, Your Honor. I think\nas long as it's not --\nQUESTION: It is not --\nMR. WALBERT: Excuse me.\nQUESTION: -- illegitimate.\nMR. WALBERT: Correct.\nQUESTION: It -- it is proper.\nMR. WALBERT: I think that is within the State's\nprerogative so long as --\nQUESTION: Well, then is it proper for the\nJustice Department to consider that in its discretion in\ndeciding whether or not to preclear?\nMR. WALBERT: You know --\nQUESTION: It's not using an illegitimate\nfactor.\nMR. WALBERT: I'm going to add on the last part\nof that. So long as it's not the predominant reason for\nthe way the lines are drawn is how I was going to try and\nanswer the -- the rest of the last question. So the State\ncan do it.\nAnd -- and it is illegitimate in this sense,\nYour Honor, because you're getting back to the question\nabout why didn't the State do it, which is almost like\nBossier II. What's the purpose and so on behind it? So\nlong as we maintain a system that satisfies the -- what I\nwould call the high water liability remedy level of\nsection 2, that has got to be enough.\nQUESTION: All right. What is your answer to\nthis -- this counter-argument? I don't know whether the\nother side is going to make it, but let -- let me -- let\nme try it here.\nThe reason that section 5 is in there is that\nefforts simply to achieve your Plimsoll line, the -- the\nequal opportunity, historically failed over and over and\nover and over again because every time a decree came down\nsaying equal opportunity is required, there would be\nanother voting change that, in fact, would inject a -- a\nnew fact pattern. And the new fact pattern, just about\nevery time, resulted in something less than equality.\nSection 5 is there, in effect, to say you\ncan't -- you can't make a move without advance approval,\nand the only way, in effect -- this Court has said in\nBeer, the only way to -- or the -- the best way at least,\nto keep from moving that line in a way which is going to\nresult in less than an equal opportunity is to insist that\nat least the status quo, as best you can determine it, is,\nin fact, not going to be modified by the change. And if\nthe status quo is some measure of safety, then the theory\nof section 5 is preserve the measure of safety because if\nyou don't do that, we know what's going to happen, and\nwhat's going to happen is you're not going to get to the\nline of equality.\nThat's the argument. It's essentially an\nhistorical argument. And what do you say to that?\nMR. WALBERT: Several things.\nhistory Your Honor cites, which is correct in some\nregards, has nothing to do with redistricting history as a\nmatter of fact in Georgia at least. We have eight --\nQUESTION: That's what we -- that's what you get\nfor general laws. We -- we've got a general law, and\nthat's the theory behind it.\nMR. WALBERT: Well, I think insofar as you're\ntrying to apply that in interpreting section 5 in this\ncontext, with all due respect, Justice Souter, I don't\nthink that that is a realistic way of interpreting it here\nbecause of that history.\nIf the mere fact that there was segregation and\nso on before 1965, a horrible history before 1965, that\nthat was enough to justify in the year 2003 where African\nAmericans are demonstrably having success that no one\nwould have dreamed of in 1965 in the State of Georgia --\nin a 26 percent black State, one-quarter of the statewide\nelected officials are African American today in the State\nof Georgia. And to say that it is necessary is so\ndivorced from the factual reality that it wouldn't be a\nfair factual predicate to apply that constitutionally to\nthe State of Georgia at this time in history.\nQUESTION: Why wouldn't it be -- why wouldn't it\nbe fair for us to say, number one, we're going to maintain\nthe Beer theory?\ntaken by Judge Edwards that if there was a margin of\nsafety before, there's got to be some margin of safety now\nin order to comply with Beer and ultimately with\nsection 5, and we're going to leave the law alone to that\nextent because the statute is up for renewal in a few\nyears, and that will be an appropriate time for Congress\nto decide whether it wants to modify the standard or,\nindeed, to continue to have any section 5 standard at all.\nThat's a timing argument. What's your response to that?\nMR. WALBERT: I would say that's punting the\nCourt's constitutional and statutory interpretation duty\nto a coincidence of time like that, with all due respect,\nYour Honor. We have this case today.\nQUESTION: Well, we've --\nMR. WALBERT: And what Georgia can do today is\nthe questions before this Court. And the fact that\nCongress may or may not -- any law that ever comes before\nthis Court may be repealed the next week.\nQUESTION: Maybe -- maybe it would be --\nQUESTION: No. But this isn't repealed. This\nis --\nMR. WALBERT: But it is always --\nQUESTION: This is an automatic expiration --\nMR. WALBERT: Well --\nQUESTION:\nact.\nMR. WALBERT: It's a de facto extension as a\npractical matter. There is no real likelihood that\nsection 5 will not be extended as a practical matter.\nThat's been true in '70, '75, '82. Whether it will be for\n25 years, 20 or 50 or become permanent this time, I don't\nknow.\nQUESTION: Maybe if we make it bad enough,\nthey'll think about repealing it.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: Maybe worse is better from your\nstandpoint.\nMR. WALBERT: I don't know about that, Judge.\nWe don't have a problem with section 5. It's the way it\nwould be applied if the district court were affirmed in\nthis case.\nAnd the difficulty is that just the whole notion\nof making section 5 compel more than the substance of\nsection 2 in a redistricting context, there's a grave\nillogic about that given the narrow purpose of section 5\nwhich is always the freeze and the backslide, the\nemergencies. Don't -- don't let anything bad happen.\nIf what Your Honor just said, Justice Souter, if\nit happened that there was a mistake and, oh, my gosh, it\nreally -- the world changed in Georgia and 55 percent or\n50 percent wasn't equal and it turned -- and 40 percent\nwasn't and it had to go back up to 60 -- let's take an\nunimaginably bad situation -- section 2 is still there.\nSection 5 could be applied.\nSection 5 is a stopgap, extraordinarily harsh\nstatute that is unique. It is unique in our Federal\nsystem.\nAnd the answer, I truly believe, to Your Honor's\nquestion is section 2 is always there if any of those kind\nof parade of horribles, if you will -- if the expectation\nof equality disappeared. But we're dealing with the facts\nof today, and the facts of today at the time of this trial\nshowed equality was absolutely established at the level\nthat we were talking about. And that is the problem with\nthis case that is before this Court today.\nIf I may reserve the remainder of my time for\nrebuttal, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Very well, Mr. Walbert.\nMr. Stewart, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM L. STEWART\nON BEHALF OF THE FEDERAL RESPONDENT\nMR. STEWART: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nIn a section 5 preclearance action, the\nappropriate comparison is between a covered jurisdiction's\nproposed voting change and the jurisdiction's existing\npractice.\nIn the present case, the district court found\nthat Georgia's proposed Senate districting plan was likely\nto cause a significant diminution of black voters' ability\nto elect their candidates of choice.\nQUESTION: In -- in preclearing, does the\nGovernment look at the effect as a whole? What if, under\nthe plan, it's true that the districts reduced the black\nvoter population somewhat from the prior districting, but\nin so doing, they picked up enough black voters in another\ndistrict that gave them an additional elected official of\nthe minority race --\nMR. STEWART: The Justice Department --\nQUESTION: -- and -- and as a whole might be\nbetter off?\nMR. STEWART: The Justice Department's view is\nthat the analysis should focus on the plan as a whole, and\nour guidance is --\nQUESTION: You do look at it as a whole.\nMR. STEWART: We do look at the plan as a whole.\nQUESTION: And you didn't think that this plan\nresulted in a gain as a whole?\nMR. STEWART: No, because our -- our feeling was\nthat there were three Senate districts that we focused on\nspecifically because we felt, for a variety of reasons,\nthat the diminution in black population was likely to have\na significant impact on black voters' ability to elect\ncandidates of choice in those three districts. And we --\nwe also looked to where those black voters were going.\nWere they being redistributed to other districts in which\nthey would increase the ability to elect candidates of\nchoice?\nThe -- the focus of the inquiry has always been\non the ability to elect candidates of choice. So, for\ninstance, if --\nQUESTION: Well, with certainty or -- or\nability? I'm -- I'm really concerned about how far we are\ngetting from the text of the statute. The statute says\nnothing about retrogression. Indeed, it says nothing\nabout redistricting. It -- it's -- it -- it says that if\none of the States who were covered by section 5 seeks to\nadminister any voting qualification or prerequisite to\nvoting, or standard practice or procedure with respect to\nvoting, which I would have thought meant, you know,\nwhether you vote on a -- on a working day or on a\nnon-working day, whether the polls are open for a certain\namount of time or not. Anyway, we've expanded that to\ncover districting.\nThen it goes on and it says, any change cannot\nhave the purpose and will not have the effect of denying\nor abridging the right to vote on account of race or\ncolor. And we have said that that means you're denying or\nabridging the right -- the right to vote if you backslide.\nIf -- if a -- even though all of the black or minority\ncitizens can vote just the way they did before, if\nthe percentage of -- of minority voters in a -- in a\ncertain district goes down, we have denied or abridged\ntheir right to vote.\nI -- I find that -- maybe that is a plausible\ninterpretation of the statute when you are going from a\ngood chance to elect a minority candidate to no chance of\nelecting a minority candidate. Maybe you can stretch it\nthat far, but to say that you're abridging or denying the\nright to vote when you go from a certainty or safe seat\nfor electing a minority candidate to a mere probability\nof -- of electing a minority candidate -- to say that that\nconstitutes a denying or abridging of the right to vote\nseems to me to -- you know, in violation of the -- of the\nlegal principle that fun's fun but you can't die laughing.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: I mean, that is such a -- such a\nstretch of the statutory language that the -- that the\nGovernment is asking us to accept that I -- I find it\nimplausible.\nMR. STEWART: Several points. The -- the Court-\nin the second Bossier Parish case discussed the\nretrogression standard and grounded it in the word abridge\nand explained that the -- the word abridge necessarily\nimplies a comparison to some baseline. And in the\nsection 2 context, the baseline is a hypothetical\nreasonable world. But because section 5 is targeted\nspecifically at voting changes, the appropriate baseline\nis the jurisdiction's existing practice.\nQUESTION: Well, you -- you wouldn't say that a\nreduction from 90 percent minority to 85 percent minority\nabridges, would you?\nMR. STEWART: No, because I think the likelihood\nof --\nQUESTION: So that proposition that mere\nreduction is enough is -- is simply not valid.\nMR. STEWART: I mean, I think -- I think the --\nQUESTION: So why isn't it reasonable to say\nthat the reduction that counts is the reduction below the\npoint where the minority has a probability of winning the\nelection? Why does it have to be below the point where\nthe minority has a certainty of -- of winning the\nelection?\nMR. STEWART: Well, I -- I think one -- one\nthing the Court should focus on is that when we're talking\nabout the Senate districts at issue here, we are talking\nabout districts that are among the strongest for blacks in\nthe State of Georgia; that is, under the benchmark plan,\n13 out of 56 districts with -- Senate districts within the\nState had majority black voting age populations. That's\nin a State that's approximately 27 percent black in terms\nof voting age population. So to say that the districts in\nwhich blacks are strongest have been reduced to a point\nwhere blacks have an equal opportunity to elect candidates\nis not equivalent to saying that in the State as a whole\nblacks have equal electoral opportunities.\nQUESTION: Well, how about if it's reduced to a\nprobably will elect? More likely than not.\nMR. STEWART: I mean, I think if we're going\nfrom the 90 percent certainty to the 51 percent\nlikelihood --\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. STEWART: -- we would still say that's\nretrogression. We -- we do have a sort of substantiality\ninquiry in Department of Justice preclearance practice\nwhere --\nQUESTION: Well, there was another district,\nSenate District 15, where the percentage dropped from\n62 percent to 50.8 percent, and the Government didn't\nchallenge that.\nMR. STEWART: I -- I think part of the reason --\nQUESTION: Why?\nMR. STEWART: Part of the reason that the\nGovernment challenged these three districts had to do with\nthe magnitude of the increase, but part of it also had to\ndo with electoral history and evidence of racially\npolarized voting. And I -- I don't --\nQUESTION: Does the --\nQUESTION: What about section 15?\nMR. STEWART: I -- I don't know the reason that\nwe didn't object to -- to Senate District 15. I do know\nas to Senate District 2, for instance, that even though\nthe BVAP under the benchmark plan was over 60 percent, in\na 1999 runoff election, the black candidate of choice had\nwon the -- the primary by only 70 votes, and the reason\nwas that the black candidate received approximately\n78 percent of the black vote but only 9 percent of the\nwhite vote, and then --\nQUESTION: Does the State have any latitude\ninsofar as your interpretation of the statute is concerned\nand insofar as your Department policy is concerned to\nexperiment to see if it can't expand the black franchise\nin other districts? Nothing in life is certain, and your\nposition is -- is that the State is simply frozen in these\nsupermajority districts and it can't attempt to increase\nminority representation in other districts.\nMR. STEWART: No.\nQUESTION: Doesn't it have -- doesn't the State\nhave some latitude to try that?\nMR. STEWART: We certainly think that they do,\nand -- and nothing that we've said in this case and\nnothing that the district court said is to the contrary.\nThat is, if the State had sought to prove that the\nlikelihood of electing black voters' candidates of choice\nin these three districts would be somewhat reduced, but\nthat that was likely to be offset by corresponding\nincreases in the ability to elect -- to elect candidates\nof choice in other districts --\nQUESTION: Well, was that -- where did I get the\nnotion that there was very likely going to be, under their\nplan, another minority official elected --\nMR. STEWART: I --\nQUESTION: -- in an additional district?\nMR. STEWART: I don't -- there was -- there was\na pair of Senate Districts, not 2, 12, and 26, one of\nwhich was reduced sharply in black population --\nQUESTION: I have the same -- I have the same\nproblem with Justice O'Connor. I -- I thought the case\nwas before us on -- on the assumption that there is a\nlikelihood that there will be another black representative\nfrom another district --\nQUESTION: Yes.\nQUESTION: -- and that that was the testimony of\nthe State and the State said that this is the reason why\nwe're doing this.\nMR. STEWART: No. That -- that's not the case\nat all. I think the -- the nature of the State's plan was\nto reduce the high majorities of black voters in some\ndistricts, and those voters would be redistributed to\nother districts, but not districts in which there would be\na high enough black population to create a plausible\nlikelihood of electing black candidates of choice.\nQUESTION: Why -- why is that the only change\nthat's relevant? Why is it insignificant that you -- you\nchange a district that was previously lily-white into a\ndistrict that has, let's say, 30 percent black voters\nwhose wishes and whose desires have to be taken into\naccount by whoever is elected from that district, whether\nhe's white or black? Why is that an insignificant benefit\nto -- to the black voters in that district so they won't\nget some -- some redneck discriminatory representative,\nbut rather somebody who will take into account their\nneeds, even if he's not a black man?\nMR. STEWART: As -- as an original matter, I\nthink an argument could be made that black voters\nthroughout the State of Georgia would be better off if\nevery district were 27 percent black on the theory that\neven though they couldn't elect any candidates of choice,\nthey could influence all legislators. But although an\nargument could be made along those lines, the Court has\nconsistently, in its vote dilution cases, framed the\ninquiry in terms of the ability to elect -- to elect\ncandidates of choice.\nQUESTION: We've never had a case before that --\nthat amounts to a reduction not below the level where they\ncan elect, but -- but just to the level where it's merely\nprobable as opposed to certain that -- that they can\nelect. I -- I don't know that we're foreclosed from\ntaking that reality into account.\nMR. STEWART: I -- I agree that the -- the\nprecise question hasn't come before this Court.\nThe two things I'd say are that, first, we are\ntalking about the strongest districts for blacks. So to\nsay that those districts have been reduced to an even\nshot, a toss-up, is not to say that blacks have equal\nelectoral power statewide.\nThe second point I'd make is this is not\ndifferent in principle from what goes on all the time in\nother preclearance settings. That is, it is often the\ncase that a covered jurisdiction will seek preclearance of\na voting change, and the change will consist of getting\nrid of something that the jurisdiction had no obligation\nto create in the first instance. But the inquiry has\nalways focused on retrogression, on whether the State has\nmade black voters worse off than they were --\nQUESTION: Now, worse off, I thought -- and I'm\nstill at my same problem of what am I supposed to do in\nthis case. But I thought worse off means their right to\nvote is abridged because of race. Abridged is the word.\nAnd that it isn't so much a question, though it's partly a\nquestion, of percentage of black voters in the district.\nIt is really a question of what a reduction in\nthat percentage means in terms of a -- a race, black\npeople, being able, across the State, to have a better or\nworse chance of electing public officials that they want.\nAnd that's a function of polarization because if there\nisn't a lot of polarization, there is no such person as\nthe official they want. But there might be where there is\npolarization. And it's also a function of how much of a\nreduction you get in a particular district in terms of\nwhat that means.\nNow, if I'm thinking that way, A, is that the\nright way to think about it? B, if it is, do I have any\nalternative in this case but to go through the statistical\ntestimony about polarization?\nany, which I'm not sure that there is or not -- I thought\nthe majority held there wasn't -- that somehow other\ndistricts will be benefitted, and then sort of second\nguess the district court. What is it I'm supposed to do?\nDo I have it right? And if I have it right, is that what\nI'm supposed to do?\nMR. STEWART: I -- I think you're looking at it\ncorrectly. And when the Justice Department approached\nthis case, there were other Senate districts in which the\nabsolute drop in black voting age population was much\ngreater than in these three districts. The reason we\nfound these districts problematic was partly the -- the\nmagnitude of the reduction, partly the fact that it had\noccurred along a point in the spectrum where a 10 percent\nreduction was especially likely to have a concrete impact.\nThat is, it stands to reason that reducing black\npopulation from 60 percent to 50 percent will more likely\naffect concrete results than reducing it from 80 percent\nto 70 percent or from 20 percent to 10 percent.\nQUESTION: It isn't just percents --\nMR. STEWART: And --\nQUESTION: -- it's a question of what a percent\nmeans in the context of the particular district.\nMR. STEWART: That's correct. And we -- we\nintroduced --\nQUESTION: And it's not just a little. It has\nto be a lot.\nMR. STEWART: We introduced --\nQUESTION: It has to mean a lot.\nMR. STEWART: We introduced substantial\ndistrict-specific evidence of racial polarization in these\nthree specific Senate districts. We -- both statistical\nand anecdotal evidence to the effect that there was a high\ndegree of correlation between the race of the voter and\nthe candidate of choice and evidence that racial appeals\nhad been made in prior elections within those districts.\nSo the first step was to say, based on all that evidence,\nthere is a -- this change is likely to have a significant\nimpact on black voters' ability to elect candidates of\nchoice in these districts. And the district court found\nto that effect.\nAnd the second thing that the district court\nsaid --\nQUESTION: I think the -- the district court\nfound that -- I thought there was a heavy concentration on\ncrossover in this record. Wasn't that the whole\ncontroversy about Engstrom? Didn't he say that there\nwould be minimal white crossover in these districts?\nMR. STEWART: That's correct. His -- his\nanalysis of the statistical evidence of prior elections\nwithin the districts was that there would be minimal white\ncrossover voting. There was substantial racial\npolarization within these three districts specifically.\nAnd so the district court found that the likelihood of\nblack candidates -- of black voters' ability being able to\nelect candidates of choice in these three districts --\nQUESTION: Do the findings tell us whether\nthere's been any change in the last few years in the\namount of white crossover voting? It seems to me there's\nsome anecdotal evidence to that effect.\nMR. STEWART: I -- I don't believe that there\nwere findings to that effect. The -- the findings were\nbasically surveying the last --\nQUESTION: Were they based on evidence during\nthe last few years, or back in the '80s and '90s?\nMR. STEWART: During the last few years.\nBasically the experience under the benchmark district.\nBut the second thing that the district court\nsaid and -- and emphasized -- and I believe it's on\npages 133 and 134a of the appendix to the jurisdictional\nstatement. The district court said at the very bottom of\nthe page, once again we note that it may well be the case\nthat any decrease in African American electoral power in\nSenate Districts 2, 12, and 26 will be offset by gains in\nother districts, but plaintiff, namely the State, has\nfailed to present any such evidence.\nSo the district court acknowledged in principle\nthat even though black voters' ability to elect candidates\nof choice in these three districts had been substantially\ndecreased, the State might, nevertheless, be able to prove\nnon-retrogression for the plan as a whole if it presented\nevidence that there would be offsetting gains in other\ndistricts. And the court faulted the State for a failure\nof proof not for any -- not -- it didn't suggest that\nthere was a -- an analytical barrier to proceeding along\nthat basis.\nSo I think the district court regarded this as a\nrelatively easy case precisely because there were\nmeaningful losses in identified districts and no attempt\nto prove offsetting gains in others. And again, the\nretrogression standard has always focused on whether the\nchange renders minority voters worse off.\nAnd again, the -- the preclearance inquiry would\nsubstantially -- be substantially complicated if the\nanalysis were otherwise. That is the Court has held, for\ninstance, that relocation of polling places is one type of\nchange that has to be precleared before it can --\nQUESTION: Well, if they were not offsetting\ngains, what was the gravamen of the testimony of the black\nState officials who testified in favor of this plan?\nMR. STEWART: The -- the gravamen of the -- the\ntestimony was not that there would be offsetting gains in\nblack voters' ability to elect candidates of choice.\nReally, the thrust of the plan was black voters would be\ntaken out of majority black districts and placed in\ndistricts that were predominantly white. The black\npercentages would be too low for the black electorate to\nelect candidates of choice, but it might be high enough\nthat the black vote could swing the balance between a\nwhite Republican and a white Democratic candidate. That\nwas really the thrust of the plan.\nAnd because -- again, whatever might have been\nsaid in the first instance, the Court's analysis has\nfocused on ability to elect candidates of choice.\nCongress has amended section 2 to facilitate vote dilution\nclaims along those lines. Congress has continued to\nreenact section 5 against the backdrop of the Court's\ndecision. So even though the argument could have been\nmade that it's more important for blacks to be the balance\nof power in a lot of districts than to be able to elect\ncandidates of choice in a few, the Court has rejected that\nproposition and Congress appears to have endorsed the\nCourt's holdings by continuing to reenact these provisions\nwithout change.\nIf the Court has nothing further.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Stewart.\nMr. Braden.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF E. MARSHALL BRADEN\nON BEHALF OF THE PRIVATE INTERVENORS\nMR. BRADEN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease this Court:\nI assume that the threshold question for the\nintervenors in this case raised by the State is whether or\nnot the two intervenors of the four intervenors, two\nAfrican American Republican voters and two African\nAmerican Democrat voters, are properly in this case. Is\nintervention permitted in a section 5 case?\nIf precedent or experience provides any guidance\nto this Court, the answer clearly is yes. In more than\n70 percent of the section 5 litigation in district court\nhere in the District of Columbia, more than 70 percent of\nthose cases have involved intervenors. There is not a\nsingle case -- not a single case -- cited by the State of\nGeorgia where the Court has rejected the concept of\nintervention in section 5 litigation.\nQUESTION: Well, in -- this type of case is\ngoverned by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, is it\nnot, which provide for intervention under given\ncircumstances?\nMR. BRADEN:\nJustice, and --\nQUESTION: Mr. Braden, I -- I think even if\nyou're correct that intervention was appropriate, did the\nintervenors join in the appeal here?\nMR. BRADEN: Intervenors did not join in the\nappeal.\nQUESTION: So why isn't it moot as to your\nissue?\nMR. BRADEN: As to our issue, it's not moot\nbecause this Court might fashion a remedy to send it back\nto the district court for additional findings, in which we\nwould have presumably a position to argue it in that case.\nQUESTION: Well, then you should have appealed.\nI mean, that -- if that was a real possibility, you should\nhave appealed, but not to appeal and then ask us to decide\nwhether you're proper intervenors because this might\naffect you, it seems to me --\nMR. BRADEN: We did not ask this --\nQUESTION: You can't walk both sides of the\nstreet.\nQUESTION: I thought intervention was granted.\nMR. BRADEN: Intervention was granted.\nQUESTION: So how could you appeal from a\nvictory?\nMR. BRADEN: I do not know, Justice. It appears\nto me that --\nQUESTION: Well, intervention was granted, but\nyou didn't join the appeal from -- from the decision below\nor file a cross appeal. Right?\nMR. BRADEN: That is correct.\nBut we are before this Court now and that -- in\nthat issue I think we are properly before this Court as\ndecided by the lower court.\nNow, the real issue I think below -- before this\nCourt is the question of whether or not you can accept\nGeorgia's invitation to throw out 27 years of your\njurisprudence because the reality of the Georgia position\nis the rejection of retrogression. It's not this bugaboo\nabout safe seats.\nEvery redistricting plan, by its very nature,\ncreates safe seats. The plan that wasn't precleared\ncreated safe seats. It simply created safe seats solely\nfor white members of the legislature. Their proposal\nwould permit the State to decide that there's only one\nclass of Georgia's citizens entitled to safe electoral\nseats, and that would be white voters in Georgia.\nThe reality of what happened in the Georgia\nredistricting process is clear from the record in this\ncase. To maintain the political majority in the State\nlegislature in Georgia, the individuals involved in the\nprocess looked at it and decided, well, these existing\nblack districts, these existing represented communities\nhave to be divided up. Black precincts have to be pulled\nout of those districts and put in adjoining white\ndistricts so we may be able to maintain the Democrat level\nof vote in those districts so white Democrats can win.\nQUESTION: Didn't -- didn't almost all of the\nblack legislature -- legislators in the Georgia assembly\nfavor this -- this plan?\nMR. BRADEN: That is, in fact, correct, Justice\nScalia.\nQUESTION: How -- how many opposed it? Was it\njust one?\nMR. BRADEN: One in --\nQUESTION: A woman. I forget her name.\nMR. BRADEN: Actually, I believe there were two,\nbut one in the Senate. Actually the senator representing\nDistrict 2 which was one of the districts that was\nrejected in this case.\nBut I might make the observation that the view\nfrom aboard the ship of state and on the dock is quite\ndifferent. If you're on board the ship, if you're already\nin the legislature, the gangplank doesn't look very steep\ngoing up, but if you're there trying to get aboard the\nship of state, if you're not an incumbent -- incumbents\nhave a different view and when an incumbent needs to be\nelected, it's totally different than a challenger\ncandidate.\nQUESTION: Well, that may be, but I -- I find it\nhard to believe that they didn't have the -- the -- or a\nmajority of them at least didn't have the best interests\nof their -- of their race in -- in mind.\nAnd -- and of course, you know that one of the\nproblems has been in the southern States packing\nminorities into one district. I mean, it's been the -- in\nthe interest of particular parties on occasion to put all\nthe black voters in one district so that all the other\ndistricts can be -- can go to the other party. And, you\nknow, maybe the black voters who supported this plan did\nso because they thought it was a good thing to disperse\nsome of the black voters who weren't needed to -- to\nproduce a high probability of success for a black\ncandidate into other districts. I mean, that's -- that's\na very plausible explanation --\nMR. BRADEN: That -- that -- Justice Scalia,\nthat is a very plausible explanation in a hypothetical\nState. It simply isn't a plausible explanation in the\ncase of Georgia.\nOne, no one alleged that these districts were\npacked.\nSecond, we're not talking about incumbents\nlooking at the notion of whether or not we will maintain,\nquote/unquote, our racial position. We're talking about\nincumbents looking about --\nQUESTION: Yes, but don't the figures --\nMR. BRADEN: -- whether or not they'll be\nelected.\nQUESTION: Don't the figures show that some of\nthe districts were way up there before, were -- were\npacked and they reduced them something like 80 percent to\n55 or 60? Doesn't that fit precisely under what Justice\nScalia described?\nMR. BRADEN: Absolutely correct. And in fact,\nto be candid with you, it's our view as the intervenors --\nwe believe the court actually probably went too low, that\nthey took the numbers down, and frankly, the election\nresults from the last election showed that our argument\nwas vindicated by the failure to elect in certain district\ncandidates of choice.\nThe process -- the district court took a very\nconservative view on the issue of retrogression. They\npermitted the State to decrease the number of black voting\nage populations in many districts, and the reason for that\nwas not to unpack. Look at the record. I ask the Court\nto look at the record.\nperson who drew the plan. Look at the dissenting opinion\nof the judge. Clearly what was happening here was a\ndesire to divide up an existing community, to move black\nprecincts into other districts to help elect Democrat\ncandidates.\nNow, politically that's understandable and\npolitical gerrymandering -- it would appear to me, that\nit's possibly constitutional to do that, but not in a\nretrogression situation where we would reduce the black\ncommunity's ability to elect its candidates of choice.\nAnd that's what's happening. Undeniable.\nAnd you're talking about two different classes\nof candidates. We have white safe seats but not black.\nQUESTION: The black -- the black community's\ncandidates of choice has overwhelmingly been Democrats and\nto -- to increase the probability of getting a Democrat\nelected by moving black voters into another district is\nprecisely to give black voters a -- a better choice, to --\nto -- it may not be a black candidate, but it will be the\ncandidate the black voters want.\nMR. BRADEN: And I think that's a\nmisinterpretation of this Court's position and a\nmisunderstanding of what the voting rights is meant to\nprotect. This is not a max Democrat plan. Our\njurisprudence doesn't point -- we've got to create as many\nDemocrat seats as possible. We're talking about\nmaintaining the existing level of the choice of the\nminority community which might be Democrat or might be\nRepublican.\nBut we're not -- it's hard to imagine the\nCongress in 1982 renewed this act and thought it would be\ninterpreted of -- of not looking at how many black or\nminority candidates would be chosen, but how many\nDemocrats would be elected to a legislature. One can't\npossibly believe that they would think that your\njurisprudence would metamorphose to something like that.\nThat cannot be what we're looking at.\nQUESTION: No. But -- but I -- it's an\nimplausible argument that you are -- you are contravening\nthe choice of black voters by increasing the probability\nof a Democrat's getting elected.\nMR. BRADEN: In -- Justice Scalia, the fallacy I\nbelieve of that argument, in all due respect, is that\nthere's one type of Democrat candidate, and the reality to\nthat is there isn't one type.\nAnd the political science on this is abundantly\nclear and the record in this case is abundantly clear that\nthere's racial polarization and bloc voting. No one\ndenies that. It exists in Georgia. And this is simply a\ncontinuation of Georgia's sad history of 100 years of not\njust blocking minority voting rights, but enacting\nstatutes and working very hard to do this. And this is,\nin fact, another statute that was created to -- again to\ndivide up existing representative districts, move out\nblack precincts to elect Democrats. That's the process\nhere.\nThere is no tension whatsoever --\nQUESTION: Move out -- move out black voters to\nelect Democrats in the district they are moved to or in\nthe district they're moved from?\nMR. BRADEN: In the district that they're moved\nto. This is just a carefully calculated scheme to move\nthe numbers down to make adjoining districts to those\nexisting black districts more likely to elect Democrat\ncandidates. And what happens is those districts the black\nprecincts are moved from become less likely to choose the\ncandidate of choice in more --\nQUESTION: Whether they're Democrats or\nRepublicans or whatever they are in these other districts,\nI take it in your view if evidence had been put on the\nstand that the black voter was better off, then you might\nlose your side of the case.\nMR. BRADEN: Absolutely correct.\nQUESTION: Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Braden.\nMr. Walbert, you have 3 minutes left.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID F. WALBERT\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. WALBERT: Thank you, Your Honor.\nI would ask the Court to think of one question\nhere, and it is this question. Is it remotely realistic\nin the real world that 43 out of 45 African American\nlegislators who are the most sophisticated, knowledgeable\nAfrican Americans about politics and winning and political\npower and electoral power would have voted for this if it\ndid all these bad things, if this wasn't the best way they\ncould see of enhancing the power? Is that conceivable?\nIt's not conceivable. That's -- that's fanciful. One\ncan't possibly say that's possible. And --\nQUESTION: Well, it's conceivable if all they're\ninterested in -- is, is in race and you want us to presume\nthat. They might also wanted to have kept their jobs.\nMR. WALBERT: Well, Your Honor, I don't think\nthat there's -- that's realistic to think that the\ndelegation would vote themselves out of office, which is\nwhat we're talking about. Are they making their districts\nso weak they're voting themselves out of office? No.\nTheir testimony is unequivocal that this\nenhances black voting strength because -- and the\nSolicitor General was wrong when he says there's no\ntestimony that the other districts would be enhanced.\nThere is no testimony that any other districts would\nbecome safe seats, but from a black point of view,\nabsolutely. When you're shifting the black votes into\nthose other districts, the potential is enhancing, the\npotential of getting someone the Democrats prefer who\nhappens to be white.\nQUESTION: And the evidence is where? What am I\nsupposed to read?\nMR. WALBERT: That's in the testimony of every\none of the legislators, said that's why we get --\nQUESTION: So what -- what do I read and what\npages do I read?\nMR. WALBERT: It would be in the -- it's in\nthe -- the testimony of the legislators. It would be in\nthe proposed --\nQUESTION: Okay.\nMR. WALBERT: It's -- I'm sorry. It's the\ntestimony of the legislators. Some little bit of it is\nquoted in our brief. It's in the proposed findings of\nfact in great detail, but it's the testimony of the\nlegislators.\nQUESTION: The district court didn't consider\nthat relevant testimony because it was not testimony about\nsafe seats elsewhere.\nMR. WALBERT:\ncharacterization, Your Honor.\nAs a practical matter, it would be a tragedy.\nAnd we're well aware of the history. We're not up here\napologizing that we are disowning the history of race in\nGeorgia. We know what it is. The Attorney General knows\nwhat it is. But it would be a tragedy on the facts of\nthis case to utilize that history to penalize what African\nAmericans are trying to do -- tried to do in this\nreapportionment under this evidence.\nIntegration's working in Georgia. We have the\nmost politically integrated political system probably in\nthe United States.\nQUESTION: That's what we're supposed to, go\ninto which political party is better for which particular\ngroup of people?\nMR. WALBERT: No. We look at the success of\nwhat the record unequivocally and without contradiction\ndemonstrates in terms of African American success in the\nState of Georgia, and it's a compelling record, Your\nHonor.\nIt shows again that we have 4 congressmen out\nof 13 who are African American, 52 percent district,\n50 percent district, 41 percent district, and 38 percent\ndistrict. Last one just elected 13 -- Congressional\nDistrict 13 just created -- this reapportionment got two\nnew districts. 13 was open, 38 percent, African American\nelected. African American elected in the last election in\na 28 percent multi-member house district. It's working.\nQUESTION: May I ask before -- before you\nconclude your argument, what is the status of the\nlitigation that's pending in the State court to resolve\nthe dispute between the Attorney General and the Governor?\nMR. WALBERT: Yes. There's oral argument next\nweek on that, Your Honor, and we expect that to be decided\nvery quickly. There is, of course, your favorable\ndecision from our position from the superior court.\nThat's on direct appeal to the supreme court, oral\nargument next week and that will in all likelihood be\ndecided very, very promptly. So --\nAnd I think that -- what is the reason --\nputting all these facts aside, which are compelling, if\nthis Court were to hold that section 5 --\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Walbert.\nMR. WALBERT: Thank you, Your Honor.\n"
