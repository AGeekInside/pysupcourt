BONNER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nMr. Lawrence in this case made an\napplication for relief in the state courts of Florida,\nthat unfortunately was denied to him, the relief that he\nsought. Consequently, he came here to the United States\nSupreme Court on a certiorari review and the certiorari,\nalthough it was denied, he did present to this Court an\nissue on which it could have acted had it chosen to act.\nIt is well within the power under 28 U.S.C. 2104 for\nthis Court to modify, vacate, remand. In other words,\nthis Court can and could have affected that judgment.\nOur position is that this -- there is a\ndistinction between the, quote, \"appellate jurisdiction\"\nunder 2104 and the original writ of certiorari which\nwould lie in this Court in some instances. When one\nuses the appeal, one is not making a new application.\nWe respectfully suggest that the utilization of the\nemphasis in 2244 should be on application and what was\nbefore this Court on petition for certiorari was the\napplication, the document, the issues, which had been\npresented below in the Florida courts and this Court was\nsitting to determine whether it would --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It would presumably,\nthough, be limited in some ways. For example, if the\napplication for state post-conviction relief raised\narguments under state law, those would not be a proper\nsubject of a petition for certiorari.\nMS. BONNER: Absolutely not, Your Honor.\nAnd the issues which were raised were the same ones that\nwere raised in the state court and were of\nconstitutional dimension that Mr. Lawrence raised here.\nBut our point is if the emphasis is on the application,\nthen until the finality of action on the application --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You're saying the\napplication is the application -- the petition for\ncertiorari is the application?\nMR. PECK: No, sir. I'm saying the\napplication under 3850 in Florida state trial courts,\nwhich then goes to the Florida State Supreme Court, is\nthe application upon which this Court would be acting.\nIf it were not acting on that, what would it be acting\non?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, we can't act on it\nunless, unless it's final. We, we need final action by\nthe state court, don't we?\nMS. BONNER: Well, except --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: How can it be final action\nand yet still be pending?\nMS. BONNER: To utilize the word \"final\"\nthere would be -- we can use the word \"final\" after a\njury determination and that in one effect, in one sense,\nis final. And when Florida is done it's final in some\nsense. But it's not final under 2104 because this Court\ncan modify it, can remand it.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's final as far as the\napplication for state review is concerned.\nMS. BONNER: There -- it is the --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Which is the text that\nwe're dealing with here.\nMS. BONNER: Yes. It is the application for\nstate review which comes before this Court. We're\nasking you to review the lower court's rulings on the\napplication.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I take it you're talking\nabout language, if I followed it, in 2244(d)(2).\nMS. BONNER: Yes, sir.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And it tolled the statute\nwhile the \"properly filed application for state\npost-conviction or other collateral review is pending.\"\nSo the question is during the 90 days after they said no\nto you in the state court and you had a chance to file\nthe writ, is that application pending? And you say yes,\nthat application is pending, that application is pending\nand subject to various motions, such as a motion or a\npetition for certiorari.\nMS. BONNER: Yes, sir.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But it is pending.\nMS. BONNER: Yes, sir that is --\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's where we are in this\nargument.\nMS. BONNER: That is exactly our position.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Thank you.\nMS. BONNER: That this application is\npending.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Of course, the other\nway to read the language is that the state application\nis final -- otherwise you couldn't file the Federal\npetition for certiorari, and that petition may affect\nwhat happens with your application for state relief, but\nthe state application itself is final and over.\nMS. BONNER: In that sense it is not final\nin that it can be altered and that this Court can\norder --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, it has to be\nfinal before you can file a petition for cert.\nMS. BONNER: Yes, sir. It's the vagaries of\nthe use of the language --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Does it say that? I would\nhave thought it said that there has to be a final\njudgment of the lower court, and the final judgment of\nthe state court concerns that application which is still\npending and will continue to be pending at least for 90\ndays in your view.\nMS. BONNER: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So it doesn't require a\nfinal state application. It requires a final judgment\nabout the state application.\nMS. BONNER: Yes, that's exactly true, sir.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So what about the\nargument raised by your friend that exhaustion doesn't\nrequire filing a petition for certiorari, that the state\nprocedures are considered fully exhausted upon the final\ndecision in the state court and that it makes sense to\ntreat this, this 2244, in a parallel way with respect to\nthe exhaustion requirement?\nMS. BONNER: Well, Your Honor, first of all,\nit would require this Court to substitute the word\n\"exhaustion\" for the word \"pending\" in the statute.\nThere is no reason to believe and there is much reason\nnot to believe that Congress intended exhaustion has a\nconcept which should be read into this particular\ncontext in which we're dealing. In point of fact, in\nthe 1995 proposal for habeas reform the word\n\"exhaustion\" was in there. It was taken out in 1996.\nUnfortunately, the Congressional history and the\nspeeches on the floor, etcetera, are not really\nilluminating, except the concept of exhaustion\napparently the legislature, the Congress, felt would be\nsubject to interpretation differently in different\nstates.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How do you know what\nis pending with respect to when the state defendant,\nmovant, doesn't file a petition for certiorari? Is\nthat --\nMS. BONNER: Well, I believe.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is the state\npost-conviction application still pending on the 90th\nday?\nMS. BONNER: I believe it is, Your Honor,\nand I think the logic that this Court has used in the\ncontext of 2255's obtains as well, and it -- it is\npending because the reason that we have 90 days -- it's\nan unusual amount of time that we have to come to ask\nthis Court for relief. And I believe that part of that\ntime and part of the reason for the existence of that is\nthat we can contemplate whether we should be filing a\npetition for certiorari.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, anybody who\nwants the additional time -- this law was passed to\nprevent people from delaying. But anybody who wanted to\ndelay would then have to file a cert petition, I assume?\nMS. BONNER: I would suggest to you, Your\nHonor, that it should be -- this should be construed the\nsame way that the finality of a state conviction, the\nfinality of a Federal conviction, and the finality of a\n2255 are determined, and that is at the time that either\nthis Court has dealt with certiorari by denying or\ngranting it or that 90 days has, has been --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But if you filed --\nso you say you get 90 days whether you file or not?\nMS. BONNER: Yes, I do, sir.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But if you want the\nadditional time that it takes for an opposition, for\nwaiver of response, for this court to dispose of it,\nthen you have to file a petition for cert?\nMS. BONNER: I don't -- that is not my\nposition, Your Honor. I believe that the 90 days should\nobtain no matter what so that we'll have a universal\nrule.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right.\nMS. BONNER: -- that practitioners will not\nbe making this error because they will be acting in\nconcert --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But the Chief's point is\nthat if a petition is in fact found it will end up being\nmore than 90 days because then you would have, in\naddition to the 90 days you'd have to file the cert\npetition, the time it takes for this Court to dispose of\nthe petition, and the statute of limitations would be\ntolled throughout that entire period, not just a fixed\n90 days.\nMS. BONNER: That is true, ma'am.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Do you -- does your\nargument mean that a defendant who wanted to file within\nthe 90 days, wanted to file in the district court,\nwanted to file the habeas application in the district\ncourt within the 90 days, couldn't do so because it\nwould be premature because the, the state application is\nstill pending?\nMS. BONNER: I believe that the way that we\nhave been seeing the opinions come from this Court and\nfrom the various courts around the country are that\nthere seems to be a favorable disposition to protective\n2254, 2255 petitions. I agree with the premise of Your\nHonor's question that it would be pending and it would\nbe pending here and therefore, you should not go to\ndistrict court and file a 2254. Now whether you can and\nyou can do it in a protective fashion is another entire\nissue which isn't really raised here because he did seek\ncertiorari review.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Do you read the tolling\nprovision in 2263(B) the same way as you read the\ntolling provision that's before us?\nMS. BONNER: No. Certainly I do not. And\nthe state really did not analogize to 2263 as I believe\nperhaps they should have analogized to it. 2263 of\ncourse is the opt-in provision which moves things along\non an even quicker track than a one year, and you have\n180 days to file, and the Congress was absolutely clear\nand this was enacted at the same time that the\nprovisions at issue were enacted, that it was 180 days\nafter final state court affirmance and you had to, you\nhad to file. That's it.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Do you think Congress really\nwanted to have two different, entirely different tolling\nconcepts in these provisions?\nMS. BONNER: I think they did, and one of\nthe reasons that I believe that they did, number one was\nto achieve their goal of moving things faster if the\nstates were able to guarantee counsel, and the second is\nthat they told, as well, in 2263(B) the main difference\nbetween 2263(A) and (B)(1) is that the time when you're\ngetting your certiorari petition ready for this Court\nunder the opt-in provision is not tolled. But the time\nwhen this Court is considering the post-conviction\ncertiorari request is tolled. It's tolled clearly by\nstatute. I cannot presume and would not presume that\nwhat Congress did was write these in numerical order and\nwhen it got to 2263 come up with a new and exciting\nidea, and then not go back to 2254 and 2244 to change\nthe language there.\nI think Congress meant something different.\nAnd what it meant was the trigger time, the time that\nwas going to be elapsing between the petition, between\nyour final decision and when you could go to certiorari.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You know, what about\n2244(D)(1)(a) where Congress referred expressly to the\ntime for seeking direct review or the expiration of the\ntime for seeking such review? Your reading of D(2) is\nthat that's what they meant when they said the state\napplication was pending. The state application or the\ntime for seeking review of the state application, and in\n-- just in just a few sections above that they expressly\nsaid that shouldn't we read pending in a different,\ndifferent direction?\nMS. BONNER: Well, the distinction, I have\nat least two things to say about that. The distinction\nbetween the two sections, that would be (D)(1)(a) and\n(D)(2), one is dealing with one thing, a judgment which\nhas reached finality and it is determining when that\njudgment is final. They would have had to rewrite the\ntolling provision because it is not speaking about a\njudgment. It is speaking about an application which is\na process. And the second thing is that --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, they would\nhave just said during the time of the application for\nstate post-conviction, or the expiration of the time for\nseeking review of it.\nMS. BONNER: I believe that Congress is\npresumed to have read, written its laws knowing the\nhistory of interpretation of this Court. And pending\nhas a very long tradition and this Court's role in the\nstate-Federal continuum obviously is of well defined 200\nplus-year-old role, and the part of that role is that\nyou as this Court are the final arbiters and the only\ntrue people who can make the decision about what the\nFederal Constitution says.\nThe state would have you read this as if it\nsays application for state post-conviction relief is\npending in the state court. I would be hesitant to\nrewrite the statute since Congress did not invite me to\ndo so as the state has actually done by saying, pending\nin the, in the state court. And that is not the concept\nthat we have lived with for 200 years or 200- plus\nyears. Pending means until it is, cannot be any longer\nacted upon, and it is clear here, you as this Court can\nupon it.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Do you think the final, the\njudgment in the criminal case is still pending because\nit can be acted upon?\nMS. BONNER: Not the judgment in the\ncriminal case, but I would suggest that the judgment in\nthe 22 -- I mean the 385.1 procedures in Florida which\nwould be that post-conviction application because that's\nwhere we are. We have reached finality on the, after\nthis Court has had, after we have either come to this\nCourt for certiorari or the 90 days is exhausted.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Are you saying, are you\narguing that there, during this period, there is an\napplication for state relief pending in the state courts\nor that there is an application for state relief pending\nin this Court?\nMS. BONNER: I am saying that the\napplication in state court is yet pending when it is\nhere, because that court can be ordered by --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Where is it pending?\nMS. BONNER: -- this Court to act upon it.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Where is it pending?\nMS. BONNER: It is pending still in state\ncourt because this Court can order that court.\nJUSTICE GINSBERG: I thought your argument\non brief was that it is pending here and the statute\nsays pending. It doesn't say pending, as your statute,\nyou compared it with says. That pending, the\napplication is pending someplace. Where is it pending?\nNot in the state court anymore. They have reached their\nfinal judgment, but it's still pending in your case here\nbecause you filed a petition for cert.\nMS. BONNER: Yes, ma'am. It just is, also,\nI -- there is some case law which speaks to the fact\nthat it remains pending or unsettled or unsure or\nunfinal when a court can order another court to act on\nit.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: In the same sense that it\nis pending after the trial court has acted but before\nthe defendant or the petitioner decides whether he wants\na state appeal.\nMS. BONNER: Yes, sir.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I don't know where it's\npending. Whether it's still pending in the state trial\ncourt or in the state appeals court. But nobody denies\nthat it's pending. And I understood your argument to\nbe, whatever mending means there, pending means here\nbecause there is no modifier that would limit the same\n-- the same construction.\nMS. BONNER: Yes. That is -- that is so,\nsir.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But in what sense is\nit an application for state post-conviction review when\nit's pending before us? We are considering a claim that\nthe state erroneously decided a Federal question --\nMR. BONNER: You are --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- but it's not an\napplication, it's an application for our review, not\nstate post-conviction review.\nMS. BONNER: It began as a complaint. This\nis, analytically, everyone seems to have a little bit of\npause because of exactly the context of your, of your\ncomment, of your question. But there is only one\nlawsuit, complaint, whatever you wish to call it, which\nwe are dealing with, and that is the one that seeks\npost-conviction relief in Florida. If you're\nunsuccessful there, you go to the Florida Supreme Court\nand that same application is what we come to this Court\non. There is nothing else out there. The state seems\nto tell us, or suggest to us that it's some kind of an\nindependent state -- uh, Federal action.\nJUSTICE ALITO: It's a Federal writ, isn't\nit? It's an application for a Federal writ. It's not\nan appeal in state criminal -- state case.\nMS. BONNER: But it comes under this Court's\nappellate jurisdiction versus its original jurisdiction\nfor writs of certiorari.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: If you succeed you're going\nto get an order from this Court to the state court say,\nsaying, go back in this state proceeding that has been\nbegun, and do it right. So the focus of it is still the\nstate proceeding even though we may correct it under\nappellate jurisdiction.\nMS. BONNER: Yes, sir. The state brings\nforward an argument that this certiorari before this\nCourt is not a part of, not an integral part of and in\nfact not any part of the state process. I believe they\ncome to that conclusion because they insert what they\nwish the statute said, rather than what the statute\nactually says, and we are attempting as best we can to\ninterpret what Congress did not, what you wish it did.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you have any, I\nsuppose this, we ought to know better, but how long the\naverage disposition time is for a petition for\ncertiorari in a case like this?\nMS. BONNER: I believe it's like 44 days if\nyou don't --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No. From the time\nof, I suppose the pertinent question would be from the\ntime of final state, final state judgment, eventual\nfiling for petition for cert, opposition, waiver, our\ndisposition? Presumably, probably five or six months?\nMS. BONNER: It's not usually that long.\nThis Court is very efficient with that. And that's one\nof the points --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, why don't you\ntake, let's just if say you take 90 days, and you get --\nMS. BONNER: You get 42 or so.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And you get a two\nmonth extension.\nMS. BONNER: Yes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Then you get another\nmonth for the opposition depending on what circuit\nyou're from for the extension. Get another month for\nthe opposition, at least two months, month and a half,\nfor us to dispose of it. It probably comes out to about\nsix months.\nMS. BONNER: It could, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Now I guess -- my\nquestion is, in a law that imposed a one-year statute of\nlimitation, is this an implicit additional, I realize\nit's a question begging to some extent, but implicitly\nan additional six-month period would strike me as odd.\nMS. BONNER: Well, Your Honor, it is not a\none-year statute of limitations per se. That may be\nwhat looks good on paper with the writing of the statute\nand the expressing of the statute to the public, that\none year is what's going to happen. But when one takes\ninto account the exhaustion requirement and takes that\ntime out, we are still not talking about a 365-day\nprocess.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Let me ask on that,\nMs. Bonner, what typically in Florida is the time\nelapsed between the conclusion of the criminal\nproceeding and the conclusion of the state collateral\nrelief?\nMS. BONNER: It's quite a while. Your\nHonor. I wouldn't know the average.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But it's more than six\nmonths, I assume.\nMS. BONNER: It's a long time, Your Honor.\nAnd --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Two, three, four, five\nyears.\nMS. BONNER: Yes, sir.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And all that time, the\nstatute has been tolled?\nMS. BONNER: Exactly, till it's -- that's\nwhy I don't look at exactly --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: The question is whether\nthere may be another six months added on to that five or\nsix-year period.\nMS. BONNER: Yes, sir. And one of the\nimportant things here is --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, the reason\nthat's tolled is because it's designed to encourage the\nexhaustion of the state procedures. This additional\nperiod is when it's pending, not before the state but\nbefore a Federal court.\nMS. BONNER: But it's the state petition\nwhich is pending for your review. And one of the things\nI want to point out is that the 90 days, when they\npassed habeas reform, they were not speaking about 30\ndays, 20 days, 60 days, 90 days or even the six months\nthat Your Honor posits. It was 10 years, 12 years, 14\nyears. And that was I think the major impetus to\nencourage the Congress to put the 365 day on there.\nThis Court has complete control over the\ncertiorari process. You know, being lawyers we always\ndo file at the last minute, but of course it's this\nCourt's rules which gives us the 90 days versus another\nperiod of time. It is, the petition for certiorari is\nnot like a notice of appeal, because it's not just a\none-page document that's laid out in the Federal\nstatutes for us to do. It's an application to, it's an\napplication for review and it is, it takes some time to\nfashion.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Any -- any\nstatistics on how many petitions for cert from state\npost-conviction collateral review are granted? In other\nwords, if we are talking about an additional six months\nin every case, how many of those are actually granted?\nMS. BONNER: I don't know how many are\ngranted, Your Honor, but one thing that struck me as I\nwas reading through these cases is that many are granted\nto the state. And of course, when the state goes to\ncertiorari from post-conviction, from a post-conviction\nloss on its side, then the whole process is turned on\nits head, and many, many times this Court has granted\ncertiorari to the state. And that is another problem\nthat happens with this tolling if you read pending the\nway the state wants you to read pending, because what do\nwe do then? What do people do?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, but if the state\nis petitioning for cert it means you've won.\nMS. BONNER: It means you've won.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So presumably you're\nnot looking forward to further --\nMS. BONNER: No. But what happens to the\ntime? How do you count that time if you lose here?\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I suppose you'd have to\nfile a protective petition with the district court\nsaying we won but we might still lose.\nMS. BONNER: I guess. And - you know, a\nprotective -- to litigants, protective and to district\ncourt judges, I believe and state court judges,\nprotective petitions are kind of anathema, because since\nyou don't know what you're going to raise -- and in the\n2254 you have more of an idea, certainly, because you're\nlimited in many instances if not all instances to those\nthings which were exhausted -- but obviously there are\nnew claims that are brought up because there would not\nbe a stay and abey. There would not even be a request\nfor stay and abey if there were things that the Federal\ncourts find.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Assuming you make\nthe same argument you make on questions 2 and 3 about\nthe availability of equitable tolling.\nMS. BONNER: I'm sorry. I didn't --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I would be very\nsurprised if the court found you were out of time\nbecause the state had filed a petition for certiorari.\nMS. BONNER: I'd be surprised --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And have it granted.\nMS. BONNER: I'd be surprised too, but I've\npracticed a long time and I've seen some very odd things\nhappen in courts and, both a stay and abey, and the\nother procedures that have been discussed by this Court\nhave not been handed down as mandates to the lower court\nto require the lower court to rule in a certain way, or\nto absolutely stay, or to entertain protective motions\nand then permit those protective motions to be\nsupplemented at a time later. If Your Honors do not\nmind, I will reserve some time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Kise.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF CHRISTOPHER M. KISE\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. KISE: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court: Petitioner's case amounts to no more\nthan a disagreement with AEDPA's recognized policies and\nprocedures, and an improper attempt to convert ignorance\nof settled law into an extraordinary circumstance\nwarranting equitable relief. AEDPA's plain language and\nrecognized purpose is established, that tolling does not\nextend to the post-conviction certiorari process.\nAdditionally, ignorance of settled law whether by an\nincarcerated pro se petitioner, by private counsel, or\nby appointed counsel is not an extraordinary\ncircumstance and does not excuse prompt filing.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Kise, can I ask you\nwhat your view in this matter would be if the Court\ngrants certiorari, would the application be pending\nduring the period that the case is under advisement in\nthis Court?\nMR. KISE: No, Your Honor. And I'm assuming\nyour question is asking me, grant certiorari based on an\napplication filed by the petitioner.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Either way.\nMR. KISE: Well, in both circumstances the\nanswer would be no, and in both circumstances I think\nthe relief that would be accorded --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Let me ask a second\nquestion. Suppose it were reversed, we send it back for\nfurther proceedings in the state trial court, would you\nsay that it's still not pending during the further\nproceedings?\nMR. KISE: It may be pending in state court\nduring the further proceedings, but it's not pending\nduring the time that it is at this Court, because this\nCourt has not --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: So it started pending\nagain after an interruption, is that the way it would\nbe?\nMR. KISE: Based on equitable principles, I\nthink that would be the interpretation, yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Forget about equitable\nprinciples, statutory principles. Is there a lack of\ncontinuity, where you could have it pending for a period\nof a couple years and then an interruption, and then it\ncan resume pending after the interruption?\nMR. KISE: You're using the phraseology\ninterruption, and I would, would --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, period when it's not\npending followed by a period when it begins to pend.\nMR. KISE: In that unusual circumstance,\nYour Honor, I think principles of equitable tolling\nwould apply to keep the petitioner's ability to file.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But there would be no\nstatutory right in your view, it would depend on the\nequitable considerations?\nMR. KISE: I believe that's correct, Your\nHonor, because statutory pending contemplates a\nfinality, it contemplates -- and I think that this is,\nit is one of the fundamental problems, I believe, with\npetitioner's construction, is this ignoring of not only\nthe plain language of the statute but what this Court\nhas said about this statute, about 2244(d)(2). In\nDuncan this Court said that state, the word state\nmodifies both post-conviction and other collateral\nreview, and established that we are talking about a\nstate application.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But it doesn't say state\npending or pending in state court, and what I want to\ndo is go back and ask a question somewhat along the\nlines that Justice Stevens asked. Is the application\npending in the period between the disposition of the\npetition by the state trial court and the determination\nby the petitioner whether or not to go forward for state\nappellate relief?\nMR. KISE: Yes, Your Honor, I believe it is,\nand I believe that's what this Court said --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: By the same token, why\nisn't it pending between the final disposition by the\nstate appellate court and the determination to seek cert\nhere?\nMR. KISE: Well, I have two answers to that,\nYour Honor. First would be, that's inconsistent with\nthe language utilized by this Court in Carey where the\nCourt defined pending as until final resolution through\nthe state's post-conviction --\nJUSTICE BREYER: That was the issue in that\ncase. This issue wasn't in that case.\nMR. KISE: Correct, Your Honor, but the\nlanguage utilized nevertheless --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I can't when I write\nsomething, I don't think I or anyone else can, if it\nhappens to be a state case, refrain from using the word\nstate. I wouldn't say there is an implication in\nwriting an opinion that it doesn't mean Federal as well.\nAs least I can't find that written in the opinion\nanywhere.\nMR. KISE: Fair enough, Your Honor. Then\nwith respect to the second part of my answer to your\nquestion, Justice Souter, that it cannot be both final\nfor 1257 purposes and pending --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But why isn't your sister's\nanswer to that adequate? It is the state judgment that\nis final, but action on the petition is not yet final\nuntil it has gone through the period allowed for final\nreview by this Court.\nMR. KISE: I would, I would respectfully\ndisagree with that, with that nondistinction, if you\nwill, Your Honor, in the sense that the application --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So you're distinguishing\nbetween a state judgment and an application upon which\nfurther, further proceedings can be had. Why is that a\nnondistinction?\nMR. KISE: Because I would, I would disagree\nwith the notion that further proceedings could be had on\nthat application. The basis for this Court's certiorari\nof jurisdiction is that it is subject to no further\nreview or correction in any state.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Let's assume that the, the\npetition for cert is granted and this Court grants\nrelief. The relief as I understand it is going to\nconsist of a remand to the state court saying you did\nsomething wrong on this application before, go back and\ndo it over again and do it right. It's the -- it is the\nstate application which is going to be the subject of it\nand that therefore, it is the state application that\nnecessarily is the subject of the cert petition.\nMR. KISE: I would say, Your Honor, that the\nstate application may be the subject matter of what you\nare looking at from a subject matter standpoint, but\nwhat the Court is ruling on is the petition for\ncertiorari, which was a Federal court ruling on --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: It's a petition for\ncertiorari to review action taken on a state petition,\njust as at the state level, whatever may be the, the\nnomenclature for filing an appeal from the state trial\ncourt to the state appellate court, is an application\nwhich relates entirely to the original application for\nrelief that was filed in the state trial court. It\nseems to me the two situations are exactly parallel.\nMR. KISE: And I would respectfully\ndisagree, Your Honor, because I don't see how it can be\nfinal for 1257 purposes and still pending for purposes\nof the statute.\nJUSTICE GINSBERG: But that -- that --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's the application\nthat is not subject to review. We review the state\ncourt judgment, not the state application, correct?\nMR. KISE: In this case, Your Honor, the\napplication is the state court. I mean, the judgment is\nwhat is being reviewed, and it is a final judgment in\nthe application. The Florida Supreme Court in this case\nhas no power at all once they have issued the mandate to\ngo back and modify, to correct it six months later. If\nthe Florida Supreme Court decided, you know, we made a\nmistake in that application, they don't have the power\nsua sponte to correct it. It is final. It is over.\nThe state's province has been completed.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But they would correct it\nif we told them to.\nMR. KISE: In that circumstance, yes, Your\nHonor, certainly they would in a circumstance, in the\nvery unusual circumstance where this Court were to\naccept certiorari and then subsequent to the acceptance\nof certiorari, then reverse the ruling.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And when it got back in\nthe state supreme court, they would still be working on\nthe application that had been pending until the end of\nthe proceedings down there, and then suddenly came back\nto life after we sent it back.\nMR. PECK: Yes, Your Honor, but that is,\nagain, the extraordinary circumstance. And that I think\npoints out the, one of the flaws in petitioner's\nargument, and that is that that's making the exception\nthe rule, that clearly Congress did not intend to add\nwhat I believe Chief Justice Roberts alluded to earlier,\nan extra three months, an extra six months.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I think what you're saying,\nthough, is when you have ambiguous language, a sensible\nrule is not a rule, it has to have a lot of exceptions\nto make sense. Surely that's a sound principle, isn't\nit?\nMR. KISE: Yes, Your Honor. And I don't\nthink that this would be a lot of exceptions. I think\nthis would be, the only exception would be, to the rule\nthat we are advocating would be in the unusual\ncircumstance, the one in 5,000 cases, the one in 1,000\ncases, the exceptional case where this Court actually\ngrants certiorari, those cases are exceptional in and of\nthemselves.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Those are the most likely\nwhere people are going to get mixed up. I mean, I'm not\nfollowing -- I think I think this argument about the\nword is metaphysical, you know, and I can make wonderful\narguments, and you have made wonderful arguments on both\nsides of this. I just can't get a clear answer. So if\nI were right about that and there is no clear answer\nfrom the language, then the thing, I'd like to go back\nto Justice Stevens' question, because it seems to me\nthat that puts my greatest concern, my greatest concerns\nare practical. If we take your position, we have words\nright next to each other, near each other in the same\nstatutory provision, meaning different things. And I've\nlearned out of my own experience perhaps, judges and\nlawyers are not always geniuses and they get mixed up.\nAnd they will get mixed up all the time, and when they\nget mixed up, people will lose rights that they have.\nThe second concern of Justice Stevens, which\nis what happens in the case, and those are the ones who\nintuitively are going to cause the problem. Because on\na rare occasion, the state or the prisoner has a very\ngood Supreme Court case. And that's going to be the\ncase where he forgets to file in the Federal court\nbecause he thinks this thing isn't over, and lo and\nbehold, the Court grants it. And now what happens? On\nyour interpretation, I just see a mess, and on the other\ninterpretation, it seems to work out fine. So those, I\nwould say are the two practical problems, and anything\nyou would like to say about that, I'd like to listen to.\nMR. KISE: Thank you, Justice Breyer, and I\nwould respectfully answer your question I think in three\nways. First, drawing a distinction between when the\nstate petitions for certiorari and when the habeas\npetitioner petitions for certiorari. Under both\ncircumstances, equitable principles would apply, but\nthey would apply in I think different ways. But in\neither circumstance, the ability of the petitioner to\nsubsequently seek habeas review would be protected. And\nso what we are advocating is not making those\nexceptional cases the rule. In a case where the state\npetitions for certiorari there isn't an ability, there\nis no way to even file a protective habeas because there\nis nothing to file. You've won, the habeas petitioner\nhas won in the court below. There is no cause of\naction. There isn't a basis upon which to file a\nFederal habeas claim, so even a protective one would be,\nit wouldn't be premature, it would be effectively\nnonexistent. So from an equitable standpoint, the\nextraordinary circumstance which the courts have\nrecognized, the circuits have recognized that the test\nfor equitable circumstance is, the extraordinary\ncircumstance would be this Court accepting certiorari.\nAnd then the exercise of diligence on the\npart of the petitioner is if the petitioner did\neverything he or she could under that circumstance,\nbecause there would be no way for that petitioner to\nfile for a Federal habeas review because there would be\nno basis for it.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Can I ask -- it seems very\nstrange to me. I can understand protective filings when\nyou've lost, but it seems to me a very strange\nprotective filing. When you've won in state court and\nthe government has taken certiorari, can you file, file\nin Federal district court? What do you say? What are\nyou complaining about?\nMR. KISE: Exactly my point, Your Honor.\nYou cannot.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No. It's their point. I\ndon't see how it's your point. How can you cover\nyourself? I mean, if we come out your way, how -- how\n--\nMR. KISE: There isn't a need to cover us\nup, Your Honor, because you've won in state court.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Provided equitable --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You're worried about\nwinning in the Supreme Court.\nMR. KISE: In the one in 1,000 or one in\n5,000 cases, equitable principles would then apply. The\ndistinction may not be clear between statutory tolling,\nwhat the statute actually provides for, and equitable\ntolling, equitable principles that have been applied by\nthe court.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But you're asking us to\nsay that the Congress has written a statute which\ndoesn't take account that the state might sometimes file\na petition for certiorari that would be granted. And\nyou say oh, that's so rare, that's so extraordinary. It\nhappens. It's part of the system.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Would you advise a client\nthat way? Would you advise a client that way?\nMR. KISE: Well --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You've won here and the\nstate is taking certiorari to the Supreme Court. Don't\nworry about making a protective filing in the district\ncourt because, you know, if by chance the Supreme Court\nreverses, equitable tolling will apply. You know, you\nroll the dice with equity.\nMR. KISE: I don't think there would be -- I\nthink it would be ill advised to, to direct a petitioner\nto file in Federal court under those circumstances\nbecause there would be nothing to file. What would be\nthe complaint?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I agree.\nMR. KISE: There would be absolutely nothing\nto file.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: The irony of your position\nis that it has those harshest consequences in those rare\ncases where there was a denial of constitutional right.\nMR. KISE: Your Honor, I would respectfully\ndisagree that it has its harshest consequences, because\nthat's where the equitable tolling principles would in\nfact apply.\nJUSTICE GINSBERG: Why do you need equitable\ntolling? Why can't you use, why isn't it most sensible\nto use the model when -- for the time clock on direct\nappeal, say there has been a conviction affirmed by the\nhighest court of the state, when does the time, when\ndoes that judgment -- it's a final judgment if you seek\ncert, right? But the time clock, the one year doesn't\nbegin to run until after the 90 days has elapsed; isn't\nthat right?\nMR. KISE: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So why shouldn't it be\nthe same way for collateral review as it is for direct\nreview? Direct review, everyone agrees that you get the\nstate final judgment. But then you have 90 days and\nnothing starts until that 90 days is up or, if cert is\ngranted, until the cert process is done. Why shouldn't\nit be just the same for collateral review?\nMR. KISE: I would say it's different, Your\nHonor, respectfully, for two reasons: One, because this\nCourt has said that direct review is different in\nnumerous cases. And two, because the statute makes that\ndistinction. Congress in (d)(1)(A) utilized that very\nspecific language that included the, the certiorari\nperiod and in (d)(2) did not use that language, and it\nis the absence of that language that indicates that\ntolling is only to apply while a petitioner is\nexhausting relief, state relief.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well that means, that\nmeans that if a petitioner who has had his state\napplication for collateral relief denied wants to\npetition this Court, but doesn't want to lose out on the\npossibility of seeking Federal habeas, that prisoner has\nto do two things at the same time: One, prepare a\npetition for cert; and the other is to prepare, prepare\na complaint to file in a Federal district court. That's\na lot to put on a person, particularly the one who isn't\nrepresented.\nMR. KISE: Well, Your Honor, I would say\nthat in many circumstances that would be the case, but\nnot always the case. It depends on how much time is\nleft on the Federal statute of limitations, how much\ntime is remaining, how long did it take to get through\nthe state post-conviction process. How timely was the\nfiling in the state post conviction process. And how\nmuch time is remaining, assuming for what was\ndiscussed --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Here there were 31 days,\nright?\nMR. KISE: Then they would need to file --\nyes, Your Honor, and they would need to --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: They'd have to file a\nFederal court complaint and a cert petition within the\n31 days.\nMR. KISE: Yes, Your Honor. Yes, Your\nHonor, because the amount of time that would elapse\nbefore this Court were to rule on the cert petition\nwould consume that 31 days. And I don't think that's\ninconsistent with what Congress intended here because\nwhat Congress intended by this provision was to provide\npetitioner -- well, what this Court said in Duncan, what\nthis Court has recognized, is that the scheme that has\nbeen put together here by Congress is one which\nencourages petitioners first to file and exhaust their\nstate remedies, recognizing and giving deference to the\nprinciples of comity, and then second to file, once\nthey're done with their state process, once they've\ncompleted the state process and exhausted their state\nremedies, to file their Federal habeas, in the words of\nthis Court in Duncan, \"as soon as possible.\"\nAnd the anomaly that would be created by\npetitioner's construction would be it would be the only\ntime under all of AEDPA where a petitioner could file in\nFederal district court but isn't required to file. And\nso I would submit to this Court that it cannot be both\nexhausted and pending at the same time. It would not\nfit within the scheme that this Court has already\ndetermined the structure of (d)(2) is designed to\naccomplish.\nThe principle is that you are to, as a\nhabeas petitioner, go quickly to state court, and we're\ngoing to give state courts the first opportunity at\nthese Federal constitutional questions. And yes,\nJustice Stevens, it may take some time. It may take\nseveral years in Federal -- in state court, before they\naccomplish that purpose. But that's the state's issue\nbecause it's the state's judgment and the state is\ntaking its time and it shouldn't be -- and this is what\nCongress recognized I think in (d)(2) -- that, that,\nthat the petitioner should not be penalized for that\ntime. That's why it was tolled.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Is it, is it clear that he\ncan go to district -- I mean, I'm not familiar with how\nthese things work. Is it possible that when there is an\nappeal or certiorari pending here there can be\nproceeding in district court a habeas action on the\nsame, on the same matter that we are considering on\ncertiorari?\nMR. KISE: Yes, Your Honor, I believe there\ncan. I believe, there is, in fact --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: District courts do that? I\nmean, they would be considering the same, the same\nissues we are, I suppose?\nMR. KISE: Well, I don't know that they\nwould be considering the exact same issues, Your Honor.\nAnd there are many things that can be done -- petitioner\n--\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You're sure that happens,\nthat while cert is pending here there is a habeas\nproceeding ongoing in district court?\nMR. KISE: Well, I certainly hope that in\nthe 10 of the 11 circuits that have agreed with\nFlorida's position here that that is happening, because\nif not then they are at risk, depending on how --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Wouldn't a district judge\nwho knows that there's a cert petition pending just say:\nWell, I'll wait; this petition will be held pending the\nSupreme Court's disposition of cert.\nMR. KISE: I would respectfully say to Your\nHonor that it's not an automatic stay. I mean, perhaps\nthere would be a stay at some point. But there are\nthings that can be accomplished in Federal court before\nthe undertaking of the review. There is the Rule 4\nscreening process in habeas. There is the initial\nreview by the district court to see if the filing itself\nmeets the procedural requirements. There is the asking\nfor an answer by the state. There is discovery that can\ntake place.\nAll of this can take place while the cert\npetition is pending before the Federal district\nundertakes any review of the merits. Now, if there gets\nto be this juxtaposition where it looks like there is\ngoing to be a conflict between the Federal district's\ncourt's review of the substantive merits and that is\ngoing to conflict with this Court's certiorari review,\nwell, then I think a stay would be implemented.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I'll accept your\nview as being the personal experience. I'm rather\nsurprised that district courts would go through all of\nthese preliminary steps when the case is on cert and\nthey may not have to.\nMR. KISE: Well, they may not have to --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm not sure if I would\ntell the district courts that's what they ought to do,\nis a wise expenditure of resources. I'll think about\nthat.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I mean, it sort of\ndepends on how often cert is going to be granted,\ndoesn't it? If you're a district court and you have\nhundreds of these habeas petitions being filed, you can\neither hold of them whenever a cert petition is filed,\none in one thousand or whatever the number is, because\nthey might be granted. I think you'd probably take your\nchances depending on the petition. If it looks serious\nand there's a petition pending you don't have to\nproceed. If it's frivolous perhaps you can proceed.\nMR. KISE: I think that's exactly right,\nYour Honor. I think that's really the point, and you've\nobviously articulated it better than I did in my\nprevious answer. But that's exactly right, that --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But isn't it true the real\nproblem with the capital cases? The state's interest in\ngetting things moving is the strongest in the capital\ncases, I think.\nMR. KISE: Absolutely, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: In the non-capital cases\nthere is an interest in promptness, but the longer the\nguy stays in jail is not going to prejudice the state.\nBut you do want to get your death cases terminated as\nsoon as you can. And what we're really talking about as\nI understand it is whether in most death cases we'll add\non a period of six, eight, nine months to the total\nperiod. And in most of those death cases, which is a\nlimited number -- I don't know, you have a couple\nhundred people I suppose in death row -- in those cases\nit's going to be seven, eight, nine years anyway.\nMR. KISE: Well, it may be that long. It\nmay be a shorter period. But I think what we need to\nlook at is not what we would think would be the\npreferred time frame, but what Congress said was the\npreferred time frame. And Congress is saying that it's\none year, and the only time it's tolled is when the\npetitioner is doing what it should be doing to exhaust\nstate remedies. That's again what this Court said in\nDuncan about describing this entire structure.\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's if you're formally\nright on the metaphysical question. But if you're not,\nnow thinking you just gave a response to the Chief\nJustice that said, well, really the Federal district\njudge when he gets these things just has to look at them\nand then he figures out whether he is going to stay it\nor whether he's going to proceed on some issues or\nwhether he is going to do something else.\nAnd that's what you thought was fairly easy.\nYou have the experience there and I just wonder how easy\nit is. I mean, why wouldn't it be easy? Because I\nguess before doing anything the judge has to know what\nthis thing is about. And that's where it seems to me to\ntake the time of a district judge. They have many, many\npetitions. Sometimes they are well organized, sometimes\nnot. He sends them to a magistrate possibly. The\nmagistrate has a lot to do, and the time consumed is the\ntime finding out what is this case about. Is that fair\ncharacterization or not? How easy is it?\nMR. KISE: I think it's partly fair, Your\nHonor. What I would say is the time -- certain time is\nconsumed just determining whether or not under the Rule\n4 screening process, whether or not the petition meets\nthe formal requirements, whether they've articulated the\nclaim in the correct way and whether it's worthy of the\nstate response, if there's discovery that needs to be\nhad.\nI mean, all of these things can be taking\nplace and in the one in one thousand or perhaps more\nthan that -- and I don't pretend to have the exact\nnumber or the statistics -- but in the very, very usual\ncircumstance where cert is actually granted, I think\nthen a stay could be put in place. And I don't think\nit's fair to say, respectfully, that Congress intended\nto forestall this entire process while this Court\nundertakes certiorari review.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Kise, there are two\napplications. Your answer to the petitioner is you have\nto file in the Federal court within that 31 days. If a\nprisoner says, I can't manage a cert petition and a\nFederal habeas corpus, it's hard enough for me to get\nany assistance, so I'll have to pick one or the other,\nisn't the, the reading of an ambiguous statute that\nyou're proposing going to be an incentive or a\ndisincentive to filing both, which the prisoner has a\nright to do? He is going to have to pick one or the\nother if he is in this timeline.\nMR. KISE: Well, respectfully, Your Honor --\nand I know that that is the petitioner's argument and I\nsee that you have given me that question, but I don't\nknow that it is that much of a choice. I mean, I think\nthat they can file, they can file both in those\ncircumstances and, and depending on the particular\ncircumstances -- and this is back to the equitable\ntolling principles -- for statutory tolling purposes, I\nthink the answer is they must file both or they forfeit\nthe right to one or the other. If they choose not to\nfile for cert, then they voluntarily if they pass the 90\ndays forfeited that right; and if they don't file within\nthe statutory period then they have under AEDPA missed\nthe statute of limitations deadline.\nBut I would, I submit to you that it is\npossible to do both, and in circumstances where there is\nsome impediment to them doing just that, if they\nexercise diligence, if they are doing everything they\npossibly can and it is not possible to file both at the\nsame time, well, then I think under the facts of the\nproper scenario that equitable principles might apply.\nBut again, to say that Congress built into the system\nthis automatic time period that's going to be tacked on\nto a very short one-year statute of limitations, a\nstatute of limitations that is designed to really move\nthings through the system rapidly, is, respectfully, I\ndon't think the correct interpretation of the language,\nand I don't think it is consistent with what this Court\nsaid in Duncan or, with respect to Justice Breyer, what\nthis Court said in Carey.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Let me be clear on your\nanswer to Justice Stevens' earlier question. Where\nthere is a reversal of the state judgment by, by this\nCourt, and the case is remanded to the state, you don't\nargue that what occurs then is equitable tolling? But\nyou say that the case is again pending once it goes back\nto the state, is that right?\nMR. KISE: I think once it's back in the\nstate system then it would have to be considered\npending, because the statute contemplates that while\nit's part of the state process it would be pending.\nIf the Court has no further questions, thank\nyou.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Kise.\nMs. Bonner, you have four minutes remaining.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MARY C. BONNER\nON BEHALF OF PETITIONER\nMS. BONNER: Thank you, sir.\nI've heard the state over these many years\nsay that a simple exception will help the defendant and\ndon't worry, we will not proceed, we'll ask for -- don't\nworry, we won't object. Kind of what we're getting here\nis, we won't be objecting to a stay if there is a stay\nrequested. However, they objected to the stay here that\nthe United States district court entered. In an\nexercise of honesty, he said: I'm going to wait for the\nSupreme Court to decide what happens in Artuz, whether\nthey accept cert or not. And they vigorously.\nObjected and utilized a good little built of\ntime litigating it on an interlocutory type appeal.\nOne of the practical problems is if this\ncase is in both courts, this one and the United States\ndistrict court, where is the record? Is -- It's just\nthe most practical of things. And also, where is the\nlawyer, who is the lawyer?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Records don't have\nto -- typically are not filed with the petition for\ncert. So the record would be back in the lower court.\nMS. BONNER: So that solves that. The --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Just to be clear, it\nis your position that to get -- you think everyone's\nentitled to the additional 90 days whether they file or\nnot.\nMS. BONNER: Yes, I do.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: To get the\nadditional time for an opposition that would be\nconsidered here, you have to file the petition for cert.\nIn other words, if you don't file after the 90th day\nit's no longer pending.\nMS. BONNER: Absolutely.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay. So then why\nwouldn't the result of your position be that every\nperson who is denied state post-conviction relief is\ngoing to file a cert position to get the additional\ntime?\nMS. BONNER: Why is my position that they\nwould not?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Wouldn't that lead\nto that result? If Congress was concerned that people\nwere stringing out the time before they seek habeas, one\nway to string it out under your reading, but not under\nthe state's reading, would be to file a petition for\ncert.\nMS. BONNER: Well, Congress couldn't have\nbeen too concerned about that 90 days because it\ncertainly permitted the trigger to have the 90 days\nincluded within it, and this Court has allowed the 90\ndays --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry. What's\nthe trigger?\nMS. BONNER: A, 2242(b)(A).\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes. When they\nwanted to include the 90 days, they said the expiration\nof the time for seeking review. They did not say that\nin (d)(2).\nMS. BONNER: They did not say that, but they\nsaid while the application is pending. And the state\ndid not address for this Court what is pending here if\nit's not that application from state court.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Does your argument --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I guess you could also say\nthat except in capital cases the defendant will not have\nan incentive to delay. He wants to get out, right?\nMS. BONNER: Of course, of course. And you\nknow, frankly, I think all of the defendants on death\nrow --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I mean, if the\ndefendant had no incentive to delay, why did Congress\nthink it necessary to impose the statue of limitations?\nThey did that because they thought people were stringing\nout their -- and they were applying for Federal habeas\nafter too long of a delay.\nMS. BONNER: Well strangely enough in this\ncase I was looking at statistics as to the average\nlength of time that a case was pending before, between\nconviction and the filing of the 2254, and\nMr. Lawrence's petition was filed within days of what\nthe average was before the AEDPA. That comes up in a\nstatistical analysis I believe by the Department of\nJustice cited to by the state.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Doesn't the title of a\nstatute indicate the category of cases that Congress was\nprimarily interested in?\nMS. BONNER: Oh yes.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: The death penalty.\nMS. BONNER: Oh yes. When they joined\ntogether in anti-terrorism, effective -- the -- just the\nword effective was plenty to convey to us what they\nactually mean. The other big problem that's not been\naddressed is these people in a practical sense do not\nhave the same lawyer for both proceedings. Many people\nwho were more than willing to practice in state court\nare not willing to practice in Federal court. It's a\nmore formalized, rigorous endeavor.\nAnd in this case what happened was\nMr. Lawrence had a lawyer who practiced in the state and\nobviously must have prepared for him that initial place\nholder, if you want to call it, 2254, because it's\ntypewritten. They cite to a Westlaw site. I don't\nthink there is any way that anyone can contemplate that\nthat would be Mr. Lawrence's doing in his own right.\nAlso, whether it's 90 days or six months as\nYour Honor has said, it's always in the control of this\nCourt. Once the 90 -- this is not a frolic of\nunnumbered years. When someone files a petition he\neither files it by the time 90 days is over or he is out\nof court, or he files it and this Court is quickly\nreviewing it after some input from the other side.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMiss Bonner.\nMS.
