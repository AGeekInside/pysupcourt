SUTTON\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. SUTTON: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. May\nit please the Court:\nThe question presented in this case is whether\nCongress in 1994 divested the States of their traditional\nauthority to delegate police powers over local safety\nmatters to their political subdivisions. It would be no\nsmall matter for Congress to impose such a restriction on\nthe States, and we submit they did no such thing in this\ninstance.\nIn making that point, it may be helpful to look\nat the text of the statute, which is reprinted in full in\nthe appendix to our brief, the blue brief. And page A-2\nof that appendix specifically repeats the language of\n(c)(2)(A), the operative provision at issue here.\nAnd our first point, as a matter of the language\nof the statute, is that Congress specifically said that\nthe preemption provision, quote, \"shall not restrict the\nsafety regulatory authority of a State.\"\nNow, prior to 1994, Ohio, the State of Ohio, had\nexercised regulatory authority in this area by delegating\nits power specifically over tow truck regulations to local\npolitical subdivisions. It's very difficult for us to\nunderstand how the court of appeals interpretation does\nnot in fact, quote, \"restrict the safety regulatory\nauthority of a State.\" That's --\nQUESTION: Well, I think the argument on the\nother side, Mr. Sutton, is that the first section (a)(1)\ndoes say, no State or political subdivision thereof and no\ninterstate agency. It talks about a political subdivision\nso that when you come down to the section you've just\nquoted, and it only says State, there's perhaps a fair\ninference that only a State and not a political\nsubdivision is included.\nMR. SUTTON: Yes, Your Honor. And the normal\nRussello argument is that a litigant like myself is trying\nto read into another provision a term that is specifically\nmentioned elsewhere in the statute. Here the suggestion\nis that we're trying to read the term, political\nsubdivision, into (c)(2)(A). That's not what we're trying\nto do.\nWhat we're saying is the traditional safety\nregulatory authority of a State was preserved by (c)(2)(A)\nand traditionally States, including Ohio, had specifically\nexercised that authority by delegating it in some\ninstances to State executive branch agencies and in other\ninstances, specifically here, to political subdivisions.\nQUESTION: Would your argument be the same if\nthe State had not made a specific delegation? Did it make\na specific delegation with respect to tow trucks?\nMR. SUTTON: Actually it did, although it's --\nit's backwards, in the sense that they generally regulate\nall motor carriers at the State level, but they exempted\ntow trucks, therefore allowing political subdivisions like\nColumbus to enact their own tow truck ordinances. So, in\nfact, in this case it would be specific, although I\nwouldn't say our argument rests on that point. Many\nStates like Ohio are home rule States, which in their\nconstitutions give general grants to political\nsubdivisions to have powers of local self-government. So,\nin this case, I -- I would say it's a little easier\nbecause there was something specific as to tow trucks, but\nI wouldn't say that our argument rests on that point.\nQUESTION: Mr. Sutton, would -- would you look a\nlittle further down in, in the provision set forth in the\nappendix to your brief? Look on page A-3. You were\nreading from (c)(2)(A) --\nMR. SUTTON: Yes, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: -- in which it says, shall not\nrestrict the safety regulatory authority of a State. And\nyou say that includes, you know, political subdivisions of\na State.\nMR. SUTTON: No. That it includes the right to\ndelegate political subdivisions.\nQUESTION: All right. Okay. Just read two --\ntwo lines later, (2)(C) where it says, does not apply.\nMR. SUTTON: Right.\nQUESTION: Again, it uses the same -- shall not\nrestrict, does not apply to the authority of a State, or a\npolitical subdivision of a State, to enact or enforce a\nlaw, regulation, or other provision. Why in that\nprovision does it say does not apply to a State or a\npolitical subdivision? Because you're telling us, when\nyou say State, it includes whatever authority the State\nhas to delegate to a political subdivision.\nMR. SUTTON: We're not saying --\nQUESTION: You wouldn't have --\nMR. SUTTON: We're not --\nQUESTION: -- you wouldn't have needed that\nlanguage there.\nMR. SUTTON: We're not saying States are\npolitical subdivisions. We're simply saying the\npreservation of a State, deregulatory authority of a State\nincludes the power to delegate.\nBut as to (c)(2)(C), keep in mind that was a\n1995 amendment. That was not part of the original\nlegislation. So, the suggestion would be that\nCongress's --\nQUESTION: Well --\nMR. SUTTON: -- style in 1995 modified the 1994\nact. And no one is arguing --\nQUESTION: I think we always look at an act in\ntoto and -- and don't try to piece it apart as to what was\nenacted when. It seems to me we have to make sense of\nthis statute as a whole.\nMR. SUTTON: That's -- that's true, Your Honor.\nBut I -- in O'Gilve, the Court said specifically that a\nlater act cannot modify the terms of an earlier act.\nBut let me -- I think there's another answer\nthat --\nQUESTION: It doesn't modify it, but it -- it\ncan give clear indication of what -- of what it meant.\nmean, you're assuming that it modifies it.\nMR. SUTTON: Right. Well, Your Honor, the --\nthe thing that I think may be helpful in thinking about\n(c)(2)(C) and the other mentions of political subdivision\nthroughout 14501 is they're all in the context of --\ncontext of the enact or enforce language, which is exactly\nhow (c)(1) reads. (c)(1) says these political bodies may\nnot enact or enforce these particular laws. That, of\ncourse, is not the way (c)(2)(A) or, for that matter,\n(a)(2) -- (a)(2) does exactly the same thing. It\npreserves the safety regulatory authority of the State\nover these various other provisions elsewhere identified\nin title 49.\nWhen it comes to (c)(2)(C), it's dealing with a\ntopic specifically mentioned in (c)(1), prices. And it\nfollows the exact same structure of(c)(1), not\nsurprisingly, because it's dealing with a topic that is\ncovered in (c)(1).\n(c)(2)(A) --\nQUESTION: Mr. Sutton, are you making the\ndistinction there between the safety regulations which\nwould be covered under (c)(2) and the economic regulation\nwhich would be the main prohibition?\nMR. SUTTON: Exactly, Your Honor. And there was\na division of authority, going back to 1966, where the old\nICC had regulated all of the economic issues over motor\ncarriers, and the Department of Transportation had\nregulated all the safety issues. And what happens in 1994\nis they're simply deregulating. The ICC is deregulating\nthis area. They wanted to make sure, as this Court said\nin Morales, that States wouldn't undo that particular\nderegulatory effort. But at the same time, as (c)(2)(A)\nand (a)(2) makes clear, they wanted to preserve the\nprovisions of a separate part of title 49 dealing with\nsafety issues, something that DOT, a separate agency, had\nalways regulated. And I hope, Justice Scalia, this will\nhelp in getting to your -- your point.\nQUESTION: There's a --\nMR. SUTTON: Oh, I'm sorry.\nQUESTION: There's a question I think that still\nwould be left open even if you prevail; that is, whether\nthese regulations are appropriately characterized as\neconomic or safety. You say they're all safety.\nMR. SUTTON: Absolutely.\nQUESTION: But that hasn't been adjudicated yet.\nMR. SUTTON: Absolutely. And -- and if -- if\nthe court of appeals decision would reverse, it would\ncertainly be within the rights of respondents to go back\nto the Sixth Circuit and say, as to some of these\nprovisions of the Columbus code, they are not in fact\nsafety ordinances or safety provisions, and therefore they\ncould be regulated as a price, route, or service.\nBut there's another, I think, important point\nthat responds to this issue of the mention of political\nsubdivisions elsewhere in 14501. I think there is general\nagreement in the case that as to (c)(2)(A), all of the\nother words, every single other word in (c)(2)(A)\nincluding, for example, the definition of the term safety,\nis defined not from 1994 on by looking at the difference\nof -- between safety and price, routes, or services\nmentioned in (c)(1) -- in other words, you would not\ndefine safety after 1994 based on its contextual\ncomparison to prices --\nQUESTION: Where -- where exactly is (c)(2)(A)?\nMR. SUTTON: Excuse me, Your Honor. It's on\nA-2 of our appendix, and it's -- it's labeled motor\ncarriers of property. Excuse me. I should have made that\nmore clear.\nThe point I was trying to make is that these\nother terms in (c)(2)(A) I think all would agree would be\ndefined by other provisions in title 49. For example, the\nword safety would be defined by the provisions in chapter\n311 of title 49, which is a large -- a large section of\nthe code dealing with safety provisions. It would not be\nwithin the States' rights after 1994 to suddenly start\nreinventing new definitions of safety, new definitions of\nhazardous materials routing restrictions or size and\nweight routing restrictions. We would be stuck with all\nof those definitions, including notably those preemption\nprovisions. We think it would be a rather odd\ninterpretation of (c)(2)(A) to say that, yes, you\ndetermine the meaning of all of these preserved matters by\nreference to other parts of title 49, but you do not do so\nwhen it comes to what the meaning of safety regulatory\nauthority of a State is.\nAnd when you look at those other provisions of\ntitle 49, it's quite clear that Congress contemplated in\nall of them -- routing restrictions, safety -- that States\ncould delegate their power to local subdivisions. That's\nnot only in some of the statutory provisions, but it's in\nthe regulations.\nQUESTION: Well, but it's not defined. It\ndoesn't -- there's not a definition that says, State\nincludes political subdivision of a State.\nMR. SUTTON: That's not our argument, Your\nHonor. We're not saying a State --\nQUESTION: I understand it's not your argument.\nMR. SUTTON: We're not saying --\nQUESTION: It would be a stronger argument if\nthat were your argument. That -- that's my point.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. SUTTON: I -- I disagree, Your Honor. We're\nnot saying that -- Congress -- let me put it this way.\nCongress has no right to empower a city. Congress can't\ncreate a city. They can't give it a power. That's a\npower the States have. It made perfect sense in (c)(2)(A)\nto preserve the safety regulatory authority of a State\nbecause it's the State legislature's job to determine what\nother political bodies, if any, regulate in that area.\nQUESTION: Well, in that connection, I was going\nto ask could this -- suppose that you do not prevail in\nthis case and we accept the respondents' interpretation.\nCould the State then every year have a cleanup statute in\nwhich it says the State hereby adopts -- or authorizes\ncities that are no less than X number of persons, no\ngreater than Y number of persons, obviously referring to\nthe City of Columbus, that -- that the State then allows\nspecifically Columbus to regulate, that it have an\nordinance and it just tracks the whole ordinance?\nMR. SUTTON: Absolutely, Your Honor. And that\nwe think --\nQUESTION: So, then we're not arguing about very\nmuch in your view.\nMR. SUTTON: Well, Your Honor, that would strike\nme as an extraordinary hoop for Congress to ask the States\nto step through. We're not aware of a single statute that\nthis Court has ever construed to mean that State\nlegislatures alone, but not their political subdivisions,\ncan regulate a particular area. I'm not aware of a single\nstatute where that's ever happened.\nQUESTION: There's a -- there's a problem with\ncities when you get to safety regulation for trucks. Can\nyou give me an example of a safety regulation that a city\nmight want to have that wouldn't have a negative impact or\nsome impact on routes?\nMR. SUTTON: Right. Excuse me? The last word?\nQUESTION: On routes.\nMR. SUTTON: Right. The -- and I think the\nrespondents' point is or suggestion is that it would be\nquite natural for Congress to say, as to routing\nrestrictions, we want uniform laws. We want them to be\nthe same throughout the State, and we don't want to bother\nwith municipalities establishing different regulations for\na routing restriction. Well, the -- the whole point of a\nrouting restriction is to account for differences within\nthe topography or geography of the States.\nQUESTION: Yes, but I mean, there's a long\nhistory in the ICC of trying to create, say, dynamite\ntruck routes. Well, you can imagine what something like\nthat does once you start talking about it within the city.\nAnd -- and every neighborhood in sight says, send it\nsomewhere else. So, it's not illogical that people who\nare worried about creating uniformity of routes would say,\nkeep the cities out of this. It's -- it's a nightmare.\nAnd -- and -- but I have no reason to know\nwhether this is so or not. And so I ask you, is there any\nkind of safety regulation that doesn't get into that kind\nof routing nightmare when you talk about cities?\nMR. SUTTON: Well, hazardous -- I -- I don't\nthink the general rule has been that either the Federal\nGovernment or the States have been concerned about heavily\npopulated regions deciding, for example, to route\nhazardous materials around their beltway as opposed to\nthrough the middle. Everyone thinks that's a good idea,\nand the cities generally, including Columbus, have been\nleft in control of that kind of decision, which is\nsomething obviously one doesn't need to worry about --\nQUESTION: But I'm looking for specifically --\nMR. SUTTON: In a size and weight situation, of\ncourse, you're going to situations where bridges or\nparticular roads in, you know, densely populated areas\nrequire different rules than in rural regions of a State\nwhere, for example, the roads are bigger and even if\nthey're not bigger, they're not as near to either\nbusinesses or heavily populated areas.\nQUESTION: How about a restriction that on a\nparticular residential street that's, nonetheless, an\narterial highway, no trucks over 10 tons?\nMR. SUTTON: Could -- could a -- a -- the\nquestion, first of all, would be whether that relates to\ninterstate commerce, and if it relates to interstate\ncommerce -- that is, commerce between States -- then the\nDepartment of Transportation is -- is going to very\nheavily regulate that particular route restriction and --\nand has authority to preempt it, even as a matter of\nregulation. If it's purely intrastate, traditionally\nthat's been something that Congress or the agencies hardly\nregulated at all, and to the extent they regulated them,\nit was only when there was Federal funding. But for the\nmost part, the regime has been that a locality makes that\ndecision through a delegation of power from their State\nlegislature.\nQUESTION: Mr. Sutton, can I ask you, do you\nregard -- just assume the -- assume the other side is\nright on their interpretation. Would that mean that a\ncity could not fix speed limits in neighborhoods? Speed\nlimit is a safety regulation, isn't it?\nMR. SUTTON: It is, Your Honor, but title 49 --\nI think it's 31147 -- specifically says that traffic laws\n-- I think a speeding limit would fall under that --\nQUESTION: It would be a traffic law?\nMR. SUTTON: -- is something that the Department\nof Transportation does not regulate and neither does\nCongress, which to me is one more indicator that you\ndon't, after 1994, start having free-form debates about\nwhat safety means.\nQUESTION: But even if the -- if it's not\nfederally regulated, would there, nevertheless, not be\npreemption under their interpretation of this provision of\nspeed limit rules?\nMR. SUTTON: On what ground? I mean, it would\nhave to be a price, route, or service for there to be\npreemption.\nQUESTION: No. I mean, if -- if you read the\n(c)(2)(A) --\nMR. SUTTON: As -- I see what you're saying.\nQUESTION: -- as -- as saying only States are --\ncan -- are -- preserve the right to -- to regulate\nsafety --\nMR. SUTTON: Right.\nQUESTION: -- it seems to me that would preempt\na local government's right to fix a 15-mile limit in a\nschool zone.\nMR. SUTTON: I understand what you're saying.\nthink the position they would take -- and maybe they could\nclarify this -- is that if it's not a price, route, or\nservice, you ignore (c)(2)(A), and you simply go to the\nrest of title 49. But I'm not -- I don't know the answer\nto that.\nIf I could make one more point, Justice Scalia,\nand I hope this responds somewhat to the point you raised\nearlier. State laws, even if you think of them as State\nlegislative acts, are being preempted in this case. Let's\nignore the State of Ohio. New York. The State of New\nYork says as to populations with more than 1 million\npeople, the cities in -- those populations can enact tow\ntruck ordinances. This interpretation that the court of\nappeals embraced preempts that State law. There's no --\nstrictly speaking, there's no such thing as a city law\ndivorced from a State law. The city power comes from the\nStates and there's just no such thing. And we think, as\nthe lack of parallelism between (c)(1) and (c)(2)\nindicates, all they were doing was preserving that\ntraditional safety regulatory authority of a State.\nIf I could save the rest of my time for\nrebuttal, I'd appreciate it. Thank you.\nQUESTION: Very well, Mr. Sutton.\nMr. Stewart, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM L. STEWART\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,\nAS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS\nMR. STEWART: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe phrase, safety regulatory authority of a\nState, in section 14501(c)(2)(A) is most naturally read to\nencompass the State's traditional authority to delegate\nits powers to political subdivisions. That view is\nsupported by the larger statutory context in which the\nphrase appears and by the purposes of the 1994 act.\nAs Mr. Sutton has explained and as this Court\nhas frequently recognized, one integral component of the\nState's ability to regulate within its borders is to\ndelegate as much or as little power as it wishes to\nsubordinate political units.\nQUESTION: We understand all that, of course.\nAnd -- and in isolation, that phrase most naturally would\n-- would mean safety regulatory authority of a State,\nincluding, of course, its ability to delegate it to\nmunicipalities.\nBut what is sticking in our craw is the fact\nthat elsewhere in the statute, the language is very\ncareful to distinguish between the authority of a State,\non the one hand, and the -- and the separate authority of\npolitical subdivisions of the State. Now, what -- what is\nyour explanation for those other separations?\nMR. STEWART: I guess there are about three\nresponses we would make.\nThe first is, as Mr. Sutton points out, this is\nnot a case in which the other provisions are identical but\nfor the inclusion of the word political subdivision. For\ninstance, in subsection (c)(2)(C), which is at the -- the\ntop of A-3 of the --\nQUESTION: Right.\nMR. STEWART: -- petitioners' brief, it refers\nto the authority of a State or a political subdivision of\na State to enact or enforce a law. Now, even though\ndelegating power to municipalities is an integral feature\nof the State's regulatory authority, it would certainly be\nless than clear that when a municipality enacted or\nenforced a law, pursuant to such delegation, it could not\nnecessarily be said that the State had enacted or enforced\nthat law.\nAnd so, if the provision left out political\nsubdivisions and simply said that the preemption rule does\nnot apply to the authority of a State to enact or enforce\na law, there would be ambiguity, and Congress -- whether\nit was necessary or not, Congress might rationally choose\nto eliminate that potential ambiguity through an express\nreference to political subdivision.\nBut the phrase that appears in subsection (2)(A)\nis simply safety regulatory authority of a State, and\nthat, as you say, would most naturally be construed to\nencompass the authority to delegate power to\nmunicipalities.\nThe second point is that based on the country's\ntraditions, it would certainly be an unusual thing for\nCongress to interfere with the States' decisions as to the\namount of power that should be delegated to subordinate\npolitical units.\nQUESTION: Has there been any -- what's the\nclosest case respondents could cite to show a contrary\npractice?\nMR. STEWART: I believe the respondents have\ncited a couple of court of appeals cases which have\nheld --\nQUESTION: From this Court?\nMR. STEWART: None from this Court. The -- the\nrespondents have not cited any case in which this Court\nhas held that any Federal statute had the effect of\ndivesting a State of its authority to delegate power to\npolitical subdivisions.\nQUESTION: Well, there are many Federal statutes\nthat -- that make grants to municipalities for various\nfunctions and don't make it to the State. This is a --\ncertainly the Federal Government interfering in the\nrelationship between the State and its municipalities.\nAnd the State has no -- no ability to veto whether the\nmunicipality is going to accept those funds or not. And\nthere's -- there's been a lot of controversy within the\nStates between the municipalities and the State government\nas to -- as to what money should be accepted and so forth.\nIt seems to me that has exactly the same effect as what\nyou're talking about here. The Federal Government has,\nindeed, indeed, intervened in the relationship between the\nState and its -- and its political subdivisions.\nMR. STEWART: We cited the Lee Deadwood case in\nour brief as support for the proposition that Congress\nwould constitutionally be authorized to preempt municipal\nlaw without preempting State law if it chose. Our only\npoint is it would be sufficiently unusual that we would\nexpect Congress to address the matter fairly directly.\nQUESTION: Mr. Stewart, would you be able to\ngive us any examples of municipal safety regulations that\nare preempted by this section as it's been interpreted\nbelow?\nMR. STEWART: We -- I think that as it's been\ninterpreted --\nQUESTION: As a practical matter?\nMR. STEWART: As it's been interpreted below, I\nbelieve the types of regulations that have been held\npreempted are -- are fairly similar to the City of\nColumbus's regulation, namely, a licensing scheme in which\nthe vehicle is inspected, the driver is tested to ensure\nproficiency in the operation of the vehicle. And those\nhave been held to be preempted on the ground that they\nrelate to routes --\nQUESTION: So, we're really talking about\nlicensing schemes.\nIs this anything that the State couldn't\nundertake to do itself with its State driver's license and\nso forth?\nMR. STEWART: I -- I think that the licensing\nscheme, while we would respect Ohio's decision to delegate\nthat to municipalities, it -- in truth I think this is\nsomething that could fairly realistically be accomplished\nat the State level.\nNow, with respect to some of the other matters\nthat are specified in (c)(2)(A), for instance, route\ncontrols based on size and weight or hazardous nature of\nthe cargo, because the determination at issue is whether a\nparticular vehicle or a particular cargo is suitable for a\nparticular stretch of road, those are the sorts of things\nthat can't realistically be expected to be done in their\nentirety at the State level. And therefore, it would be a\nparticular disruption of the State's processes --\nQUESTION: Mr. Stewart, before your time goes\nout, will you give us your third point too? You gave us\nthe first two.\nMR. STEWART: The third point is that to the\nextent that the provision at issue here is ambiguous and\nthe Court wants to interpret it by reference to other\nrelevant statutory provisions, it is important to examine\nthe larger statutory context. That is, (c)(2)(A) is not\nlimited to safety. It specifies these other matters, and\nas Mr. Sutton was pointing out, the other matters are\ncovered in detail in different provisions of title 49. In\ngeneral, those other provisions of title 49 contain their\nown preemption provisions. They explain at -- at great\nlength what States can and can't do. At least in the area\nof safety, State law is specifically defined to include\nthe law of the local governmental unit, and so the -- the\nsafety regime in the other parts of title 49 specifically\ncontemplates municipal safety regulation. And it would be\nodd to think that Congress, in this oblique way, has\nsuperseded that carefully developed statutory framework.\nAnd to put this in larger historical context, to\nfollow up on Mr. Sutton's point, from 1966 to 1995, at the\nFederal level there was division of regulatory authority\nbetween the ICC which did economic regulation and the\nDepartment of Transportation which did safety regulation.\nAnd it's no coincidence that State law as to economic\nmatters was preempted at about the same time that the ICC\nsaw its powers diminished and the ICC was eventually\neliminated altogether. This was part of a larger program\nof deregulating the economics of commercial trucking.\nBut --\nQUESTION: Who -- who administers this statute?\nIs there a Federal agency that -- that can be said to be\nadministering this -- this statute?\nMR. STEWART: There -- there is no Federal\nagency entrusted with the administration of this\nparticular statute. The Department of Transportation\nadministers the related provisions of title 49 that are\nspecifically addressed to these matters, and their\nimplementation of their responsibilities under those\nprovisions would be affected by this Court's decision in\nthis case because if there is no municipal safety\nregulation at all, that would obviously have an impact on\ntheir administration of the scheme for determining when\nmunicipal regulation is and is not permitted. But they\nare not specifically entrusted with authority over this\nscheme.\nSo -- so to return to the point about the\ndivision of responsibilities, Congress eliminated the ICC,\neliminated Federal economic regulation of commercial\ntrucking, and at the same time it preempted State law in\norder to ensure that the States didn't undo the Federal\nderegulatory efforts. But there's been no Federal\nderegulation in matters of trucking safety. The prior\nprovisions of title 49 remain on the books.\nThere's no expression of congressional\ndiscontent with the manner in which power in those areas\nhas been divided between the Federal, State, and local\ngovernments. To the contrary, the conference report\naccompanying the 1994 act refers specifically to those\npreexisting provisions and expresses the intent that their\nadministration continue unchanged.\nQUESTION: May I ask this question on the\ndivision of responsibility? Is it your view -- your\nunderstanding that the cities would not be able in their\nlicensing scheme to regulate the rates that the truckers\ncharge?\nMR. STEWART: That's correct.\nIf there are no further questions, I have\nnothing further.\nQUESTION: To what extent, Mr. Stewart, does the\nDepartment of Transportation -- you said there's no\nadministrator of the statute, but they do have authority\nunder the motor safety -- motor carrier safety assistance\nprogram that seems to be relevant.\nMR. STEWART: The motor carrier safety\nassistance program, and they also have authority under\nother provisions of title 49 to review and declare to be\npreempted State and local laws -- State and local safety\nlaws that apply to transportation in interstate commerce.\nAgain, those are not provisions of this particular\nstatute. They are among the preexisting provisions of\ntitle 49 that were intended to be preserved by subsection\n(c)(2)(A).\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Stewart.\nMr. Cordray, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD A. CORDRAY\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nQUESTION: Mr. Cordray, I hope you'll tell us\nthe practical effects of the decision below.\nMR. CORDRAY: The practical effect of the\ndecision below, as you uncovered it in your questioning\nearlier, is that Federal law preempts municipalities and\nother local governments from imposing their own individual\nlicensing schemes upon motor carriers of property and that\nis --\nQUESTION: Well, it also speaks to routes or\nweight limitations. Are there situations where the city\nor town is particularly aware of traffic problems within\nthe city or a weak bridge or something and that its\nlimitations are needed?\nMR. CORDRAY: Size and weight limitations, as\nthe other matters addressed in (c)(2)(A), would be\nregulated at the State level, not at the local level under\nthe proper reading of this statute. And the reason is\nthat Congress did not want to open up the trucking\nindustry, where it was attempting to do something new,\nwhich is deregulate it nationwide and create an unfettered\nfree market for trucking and transportation services.\nQUESTION: So that if a city says no trucks\nthrough the park with the public playground between\ncertain hours, that has to be the -- the State? That's\nthe only one that could do that?\nMR. CORDRAY: That could be done at the State\nlevel and it could be done either by going to the State\nlegislature, as you suggested, or it could be done by\nsetting up a very simple administrative scheme at the\nState level where you would go to the State department --\nQUESTION: Well, why would --\nQUESTION: Well, most cities I've been in had --\nQUESTION: -- why would Congress choose to -- to\nregulate in that way, say we want the State to do it but\nnot the locality?\nMR. CORDRAY: Specifically because they were\ntrying to deregulate this market nationwide. To leave in\nplace every municipality with the option to license\ndifferent motor carriers of property is not only --\nQUESTION: No. I'm not talking about licensing.\nI'm talking about the -- the example of, say, that no\ntrucks over 10 tons on this particular road.\nMR. CORDRAY: Again, I think that petitioners\nagree and all the courts have agreed that every subsection\nof (c)(2)(A) has to be read together, and to the extent\nmunicipal authority is being preempted in one respect,\nit's being preempted in all. And the reason is that\nCongress was recognizing that schemes directed\nspecifically to motor carriers of property at the local\nlevel simply incorporated too much regulation that would\ninterfere with and impede a free market for transportation\nservices and motor carriers --\nQUESTION: May I ask a similar question?\nSupposing that there's a heavy rain storm in a city or\nsomething and it becomes unsafe to use a certain street if\nthe truck is over a certain size. Could -- the police\nwould not be permitted to divert the traffic around that\nparticular flooded area, I suppose.\nMR. CORDRAY: Certainly they could. This goes\nto your question you asked earlier which is whether\ntraffic laws, ordinary, general traffic laws, would be\npreempted under our --\nQUESTION: No. This is for safety reasons.\nMR. CORDRAY: -- statute --\nQUESTION: They figure it's -- it's dangerous\nbecause the thing is too deep and the trucks have to over-\nset -- overturn or something like that.\nMR. CORDRAY: They -- they would be -- they\nwould be diverting --\nQUESTION: It would be preempted, I guess.\nMR. CORDRAY: They would be -- no. They would\nbe diverting presumably all traffic that's heavy enough to\ncreate a safety problem.\nQUESTION: Supposing -- truck size traffic, yes.\nMR. CORDRAY: Yes, but -- but it's not directed\nsimply to motor carriers of property. It's directed to\nall trucks, all oversize vehicles. It could be private\nvehicles, RVs that people use to take vacations, whatever\nit might be. That would be permissible.\nAnd traffic laws, I want to stress, are not\npreempted by this statute. This statute is not limitless.\nAs this Court has --\nQUESTION: Well, then what about the -- the\nanswer that you gave earlier to the question that the\nChief Justice and I had? No -- no trucks through the\nplayground or -- or through a residential neighborhood at\na certain time. I thought you said that would be\npreempted, but now you're saying it applies only if\nthey're motor carriers of property?\nMR. CORDRAY: Let me step back. If the\nordinance related to all oversize vehicles -- that would\nbe a general traffic regulation -- that would be\npermissible. And I'll -- and I'll get to that in a\nmoment, why traffic laws are not preempted by the statute.\nThey -- they are not related to price, route, or service\nof motor carriers of property.\nIf it was directed specifically to a type of\nmotor carrier of property, as this licensing scheme is --\nit applies directly, specifically, and only to tow trucks\n-- that would be a different matter. Municipalities are\nnot permitted to do that, and Congress specifically wanted\nto do that because although there was a tradition of lots\nof regulation at the State and local level, Congress was\nmaking a policy decision, as it's free to do, to say that\nall of that is impeding a free market for transportation\nservices and motor carriers that's affecting broad\nsegments of the American economy. We want to bring down\ncosts, rid us of these inefficiencies --\nQUESTION: I understand that, but I'm at the\nsame question that I think everyone has asked. In my mind\n-- and I might be misremembering -- there are lots of\nstreets -- there used to be in San Francisco and you'd see\na sign, and it would say, no trucks over 3-and-a-half\ntons. And it seems to me in Boston I can think of seeing\nsigns. I thought maybe they said, no trucks over such and\nsuch. Maybe they just say no vehicle over such and such.\nAnd my impression is that in many cities there are many\nsuch streets, and which streets there are is a matter for\nthe municipality to decide. And it's a shifting pattern,\nand typically it's in residential areas. And there's lots\nof local regulation of that kind. That's my impression.\nAnd I want to know, on your reading of this\nstatute, does this change when I'm thinking of those signs\non one street after another? Does that all change because\nthey're preempted, and now each neighborhood has to go to\nSacramento, if they're in California, and convince the --\nthe legislature? I'd be very surprised if that is so,\nthat Congress changed so well established a municipal\npattern of behavior without saying anything about it. And\ntherefore, I think everyone is driving at the same\nquestion. I understand about all the licensing stuff, but\nI want to know the answer to that question.\nMR. CORDRAY: All right. Again, it's not what's\nspecifically at issue in this case, but I understand the\nCourt wants the answer to the hypothetical. Absolutely.\nQUESTION: It has nothing to do with this case.\nI'm saying when your -- accept the fact that if I accept\nyour position in this case --\nMR. CORDRAY: Yes.\nQUESTION: -- at the moment I'm thinking all\nthis traditional regulation of what street you can use if\nyou're a truck is being wiped out. I mean, that's\nrelevant.\nMR. CORDRAY: It could be dealt with either of\ntwo ways, Your Honor. Either it could be regarded as a\ngeneral traffic law, like a one-way street, like a speed\nlimit, and the like, in which case we believe that it\nwould not come within the preemption clause ex ante\nbecause it has to have a connection with or reference to\nmotor carriers of property to come within the terms of\nthis preemption clause --\nQUESTION: Motor carriers of property or just\nmotor carriers?\nMR. CORDRAY: Motor carriers of property which\nis what --\nQUESTION: In other words, if they -- if they\ndon't say on the street motor carriers of property cannot\nuse this, then it's not preempted.\nMR. CORDRAY: Then it is a general traffic\nregulation no different from where the speed limit says 55\nmiles per hour and trucks have to obey it, just as cars\ndo. And motor carriers --\nQUESTION: Well, does the term, motor carriers\nof property -- does that mean motor carriers of property\nfor hire or any motor carrier that is carrying property?\nMR. CORDRAY: Well, it would be those who come\nwithin the terms of this specific preemption clause.\nQUESTION: Yes, that's what I want to know.\nWhich does it mean?\nMR. CORDRAY: Yes. I -- I believe that this\nstatute is referring to for hire carriers of -- motor\ncarriers of property.\nQUESTION: So -- so, if a State were to say all\nprices of all trucks in this State have to be $50 -- all\ntrucks -- and they don't say motor carriers of property,\nthat's not preempted.\nMR. CORDRAY: No, that is not correct because\nit's specifically referenced --\nQUESTION: Of course, it's not correct. And\nsimilarly, if they say on a street, no truck can use this\nstreet --\nMR. CORDRAY: Yes.\nQUESTION: -- and they don't say motor carriers\nof property, it's the same.\nMR. CORDRAY: The reason is -- no. The reason\nis that specifically references price. There are lots of\nlaws that in -- tangentially will affect routes. All\nright? A one-way street law, for example, has to be\nobeyed by trucks, just as it is by cars. That's not\nwithin this preemption clause. So, that's one way to\naddress it. All right. And -- and that would be true of\nall general traffic laws, just as it's true of all general\ntort laws, general tax laws.\nQUESTION: Mr. Cordray, on this point, look at\non page A-2, (c)(1), the general rule. It has at the very\nend of it the phrase, with respect to the transportation\nof property.\nMR. CORDRAY: Right.\nQUESTION: Where are you reading from?\nQUESTION: I'm reading on page A-2, (c)(1), the\ngeneral rule from which (c)(2) is -- is an exception. And\nthe general rule is, except as provided, blah, blah, blah,\nblah, no State, political subdivision shall enact any\nprovision having the force and effect of law related to a\nprice, route, or service of any motor carrier. And then\nthere's a lot of other language. And then at the very\nend, with respect to the transportation of property. Does\nthat phrase at the end go all the way back to related to a\nprice, route, or service with respect to the\ntransportation of property?\nMR. CORDRAY: I believe it does, Your Honor, and\nit's just -- it's just --\nQUESTION: Well, that would make it a very\nnarrow provision then, wouldn't it, that -- that we're\nexcluding the -- the municipalities from?\nMR. CORDRAY: I believe it is.\nQUESTION: They just couldn't say you're not\nallowed to use this street to carry -- to carry moving\ngoods or --\nMR. CORDRAY: This is a key point.\nQUESTION: But you're -- you're asking -- you're\nasking us to -- to have a very careful grammatically\ncorrect reading of the act, and in your answer that --\nthat you've just given to Justice Scalia, transportation\nof property is preceded by an or. It seems to me the\nfirst clause is quite independent, related to a price,\nroute, or service of any motor carrier. That's it.\nMR. CORDRAY: With --\nQUESTION: So, I'm not sure the qualification\nyou urge on us, in order to mitigate the effects of this\nholding works.\nQUESTION: Well, I don't know what it would go\nto if it didn't go to that. It can't go to the stuff\nafter the or. Or any motor -- motor private carrier,\nbroker or freight forwarder with respect to the\ntransportation of -- what is a -- what is a motor private\ncarrier with respect to the transportation of -- of\nproperty? It has no meaning unless you read it all the\nway back up to price, route, or service with respect to\nthe transportation --\nMR. CORDRAY: And the title of the provision is\nmotor carriers of property. That's specifically what\nthey're dealing with, as distinguished from motor carriers\nof passengers, which are addressed earlier in the same\nsection of the statute, 14501(a).\nQUESTION: It's not the best statute, is it?\nMR. CORDRAY: I beg your pardon?\nQUESTION: It's not the best statute.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. CORDRAY: It's -- it's clear enough with\nrespect to the things we care about here, which is that --\nQUESTION: Well, but I don't think it is.\nMR. CORDRAY: -- Congress very carefully\nattempted to distinguish between a State and a political\nsubdivision of a State. And it did so repeatedly in the\nstatute for the specific purpose of drawing a distinction\nbetween them. And the only way --\nQUESTION: There's not a word of legislative\nhistory I take it --\nQUESTION: If you read (c)(1) as narrowly as\nyou're suggesting, you don't even need the exemption\nbecause it only relates to law, regulation, or other\nprovision related to price, route, or service. So -- and\nit doesn't even reach safety.\nMR. CORDRAY: No, that's not true, Your Honor.\nAnd this case is a good example of it. They are\nattempting to impose a licensing scheme with respect to\ntow trucks and could do it with respect to any motor\ncarrier of property, parcel delivery service, or the like.\nAnd their -- their rationale for doing so apparently is\nsafety. But in fact, that is exactly what is preempted by\nthis statute and by this clause.\nQUESTION: But, Mr. Cordray, that's open. Mr.\nSutton said that that question whether these regulations\nare genuine safety regulations or, on the other hand,\neconomic is not determined by this case. Here the\nquestion is whatever is safety, may the State delegate\nthat authority to the municipalities.\nI did want to get your response to a question\nJustice Kennedy asked Mr. -- and it was answered for you\nby Mr. Sutton. Suppose the State says, okay, we do\nbusiness by dealing with municipalities. So, we will\nsimply take the municipal regulation of Toledo and the\nmunicipal regulation of Columbus, and we'll put it all\ntogether in one package. It will say, State regulation of\nsafety, and -- and we'll preserve everything. Would that\nbe permissible under your reading of this Federal statute?\nMR. CORDRAY: Yes, it would, Your Honor. It\nwould. If the State is doing the regulating or enacting\nthe law, under this statute, the way it reads and the --\nthe way it was designed, that would be permissible, even\nif it's nonuniform. If we wanted to make it uniform, we'd\nhave to go to the legislature and try to get that package\namended or go perhaps to the State department of\ntransportation which also could do this through an\nadministrative scheme.\nQUESTION: So, it's strictly a question of form\nthat we're dealing with, that States, you can delegate to\nyour cities, as you always have, just say, cities, what do\nyou want and we'll give it to you by enacting a State law.\nMR. CORDRAY: No. It's not simply a matter of\nform because Congress made a judgment that if there were\n50 different States imposing their own schemes, that would\nbe less impediments and -- and tangle of restrictions\nimpeding a free market than if 39,000 municipalities and\nlocal governments around the country were free on their\nown to do what they wished, and that that -- that was in\nfact very much undercutting the desire to get to a free\nmarket in transportation services.\nBut I also want to go back to your comment and\nyour question earlier. This statute does not itself\ndistinguish between economic regulation that's preempted\non the one hand and safety regulation that's not on the\nother. The phrasing of the statute is much broader. It\nis related to price, route, and services of a motor\ncarrier of property. That may not only be economic\nregulation. And so the notion that that's the divide and\nwe can simply remand, the lower court can sort it out, I\nbelieve is not correct.\nNow, as we've seen here, the fact that the --\nthe statute is broad does not mean it's all encompassing.\nI mean, I could see an argument that truck -- trucking\ncompanies no longer now have to pay corporate tax because\nthat affects their price. But that's a general provision.\nAs this Court has said in construing ERISA and needs to be\nimported here in the Dillingham case and the like, there\nhas to be a connection with or reference to the specific\nitem at issue. Here motor carriers of property. And\nthat's what we have with this licensing scheme here which\nis directed specifically at tow trucks and will have a\nvery direct relation and -- and effect on their prices and\nservices.\nI also want to mention the problem of surplusage\nbecause it's not been mentioned on the other side, and\nit's very important here. What possible reason would\nCongress have had for including in the statute what\nobviously is a key phrase? It shows up seven times in the\ncourse of the single statute. Political subdivision of a\nState. Why would that be included at all if the authority\nof a State is to be read, as petitioners would have it, to\nalways include within it the authority of a political\nsubdivision.\nQUESTION: Their -- their answer is that -- that\nwhen you speak of the regulatory authority of a State,\nthat naturally connotes the authority to -- to delegate\nthat to -- to municipalities. But when you speak of the\nauthority of a State to enact or enforce a law, that --\nthat much less naturally includes the authority of a\nmunicipality to enact or enforce a law so that -- and all\nof those other references are in connection with that\nphrase, to enact or enforce a law. Are they not?\nMR. CORDRAY: Two reasons why that does not\nwork, Your Honor. They agreed that the subsections of\n(c)(2)(A) have to be read in parallel and the second one\nwith respect to size and weight and the like. It doesn't\nsay anything about regulatory authority. It just says\nauthority of a State.\nSecond, in the preemption clause itself --\nQUESTION: Wait, wait. I --I missed that.\nMR. CORDRAY: Well, regulatory authority is the\nphrase used in the first subclause --\nQUESTION: Right.\nMR. CORDRAY: -- of (c)(2)(A) related to safety.\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. CORDRAY: But they're not talking about\nauthority to regulate. They're just talking about\nauthority of a State with respect to the size and weight,\nhazardous cargo, and then with respect to insurance. And\ninsurance is an excellent example I'll get to in a moment.\nBut also in the preemption clause itself,\n(c)(1), it refers to the authority of a State to enact or\nenforce a law or regulation. That is regulatory\nauthority, and it distinguishes it full stop from the\nauthority of a political subdivision of a State to do the\nsame thing. What? Enact or enforce a regulation. So,\nthe regulatory authority is being discussed specifically\nin the preemption clause itself.\nThat's the fallacy of starting the analysis here\nby jumping all the way to (c)(2)(A) and wrenching that\ntext out of context and divorcing it from the preemption\nclause that it's meant to be a savings subordinate to.\nBut the preemption clause itself --\nQUESTION: No, but (c)(1) uses may enact or\nenforce just as -- as (c)(2)(C) does, whereas (c)(2)(A)\ndoes not. The to enact or enforce language applies in\nevery subsection except the one that we're arguing about.\nMR. CORDRAY: That's correct, which is a telling\npoint. In every subsection, Congress went out of its way\nto add political subdivision of a State. I've still not\nheard a single sensible explanation for why they would\nbother to do that.\nQUESTION: Well, if -- but if you didn't add the\npolitical subdivision in those States and if you had a\nhome rule State, then a local government could -- would\nnot be affected by it.\nMR. CORDRAY: No, not correct because their\nnotion is that State includes delegating to its local\ngovernment as a delegated power from the State. They want\nto read the two as being encompassed within one another.\nQUESTION: When you described the regulatory --\nregulatory authority in gross as you do in (2)(A), then it\nwould apply to the authority to delegate. But when you're\ntalking about authority to enact or enforce, then you have\nto identify the entities that do the enacting and the\nenforcing. It seems to me that's a perfectly logical\ndistinction.\nMR. CORDRAY: Well, I don't believe it is, Your\nHonor. And again, there's nothing about regulatory\nauthority that is unique in this statute because (c)(2)(A)\ndoes refer to regulatory authority with respect to safety,\nbut it doesn't refer to regulatory authority with\nrespect --\nQUESTION: Well, don't you agree that if you\ndidn't have all the other subdivisions in here, that would\nbe the normal reading of regulatory authority, which would\ninclude the authority to delegate?\nMR. CORDRAY: I would agree that if (c)(2)(A)\nalone were the statute --\nQUESTION: Correct.\nMR. CORDRAY: -- that would be a sensible\nreading. But if you -- that -- that's taking it out of a\ncontext where Congress specifically is dealing with a\nState and a political subdivision regularly in the statute\nand then in one instance a special kind --\nQUESTION: Yes, but in one -- but in one\nprovision, they say regulatory authority, which has a\nplain meaning that you'd be -- brings a result you\ndisagree with. In the other they consistently use\nauthority of a State or a political subdivision to enact\nor enforce.\nMR. CORDRAY: But it doesn't --\nQUESTION: If you don't refer to political\nsubdivision, it just wouldn't include it.\nMR. CORDRAY: It doesn't have a plain meaning.\nIt doesn't really have any meaning because in the\npreemption clause itself, they're referring to the\nauthority of a State to regulate, and they're separately\nreferring to the authority of --\nQUESTION: No. It says a State or a political\nsubdivision may not enact or enforce. That's the language\nof the preemption clause.\nMR. CORDRAY: Correct. That's right. Enact or\nenforce what? A regulation, which is the same thing as to\nregulate.\nQUESTION: (c)(2)(A) at the bottom of page A-2\nin the same sentence uses this shall not restrict the\nsafety regulatory a State -- authority of a State with\nrespect -- or the authority of a State. They don't use\nthe adjective regulatory even in the second clause.\nMR. CORDRAY: That was my point. I was trying\nto make it earlier. I -- I didn't make it as clearly as\nyou just did. But that's exactly --\nQUESTION: Well, obviously, I -- I missed it, so\nsay it again.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. CORDRAY: Well, that's exactly right.\nTrying to give some special meaning --\nQUESTION: Where? What -- what section are you\ntalking about?\nMR. CORDRAY: We're talking about (c)(2)(A).\nQUESTION: At the bottom of page A-2.\nMR. CORDRAY: This is a point I tried to make\nearlier and I did not make it as clearly as the Chief\nJustice just did.\nQUESTION: I didn't get it.\nMR. CORDRAY: But they're attempting to give\nsome special meaning to the phrase safety regulatory\nauthority, but by their own argument, that can't follow\nbecause they want to -- they have to read all these\nprovisions the same way. And the second subclause there\nrefers --\nQUESTION: The authority of a State.\nMR. CORDRAY: -- to the authority of a State,\nnothing about safety, nothing about regulatory, and has to\nbe read in the same fashion.\nI would also point out that the third subclause\nthere, which relates to insurance requirements, they would\nbe saying that municipalities are free to impose their own\ninsurance requirements upon motor carriers of property.\nSo, FedEx, UPS in different municipalities would have to\nmeet different insurance requirements. They'd have to do\ndifferent kinds of filings and have very different kinds\nof --\nQUESTION: You're too fast for me. Where is the\ninsurance requirement?\nQUESTION: At the very end of that provision.\nMR. CORDRAY: It's the third subclause in\n(2)(A).\nQUESTION: (2)(A).\nQUESTION: Oh, in -- in (2)(A), okay.\nMR. CORDRAY: And that is completely at odds\nwith the statute because in 14504, which this Court is\ngoing to take up in a case called Yellow Freight next\nterm, it says specifically there -- Congress said even 50\nregistrations by motor carriers of property in different\nStates for insurance purposes is too many for our taste.\nWe think there should only be one, and they said the\nsingle State --\nQUESTION: Well, what about the middle one?\nWhat about the middle one? It says, the authority of a\nState to impose highway limitations.\nMR. CORDRAY: Yes.\nQUESTION: Now, I can't figure out, for the life\nof me, how -- why Congress would have wanted to say the\nState can impose limitations on the use of highways, but\nthe city cannot impose limitations on the use of streets.\nBut your reading would lead to that.\nMR. CORDRAY: That would be one respect, Your\nHonor, in which either -- if it was a general traffic\nregulation, then it would not be preempted at all. Or if\nit were preempted, it would have to be done at the State\nlevel and it could be done by the --\nQUESTION: I thought part of your argument was\nalso that streets are not highways, and I'm surprised you\ndidn't make that point when we were talking about the --\nyou know, no trucks on a school street or something like\nthat. Isn't the term highways arguably different from --\nfrom local residential neighborhood streets?\nMR. CORDRAY: Arguably it could be, but I\nbelieve for purposes of title 49, it's a defined term to\ninclude streets. But our point there was that it's\nperfectly sensible for Congress to say that the States\nshall deal with these issues, but not the municipality.\nQUESTION: And you found not a word -- am I\nright? There is not a word in the history of this --\nalthough there was some human being who wrote these words,\nthere is not a word in any document, hearing, report,\ndebate that casts any light on this one way or the other.\nMR. CORDRAY: One way or the other. But again,\ntraffic regulations --\nQUESTION: Is that right?\nMR. CORDRAY: -- generally are not within the\npreemption clause.\nQUESTION: No, no. I'm just trying to -- it's\nmysterious to me.\nMR. CORDRAY: Yes. The legislative history\nhere --\nQUESTION: And I'm having trouble, and therefore\nI -- I just sometimes look at the legislative history --\nMR. CORDRAY: Yes, I understand.\nQUESTION: -- to try to figure it out. And you\nhaven't found anything, nor does the other --\nMR. CORDRAY: The legislative history here is\nconfused and somewhat unilluminating.\nQUESTION: I guess we'll have to use the\nstatute.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: Mr. Cordray, is there -- is there an\nexample -- any other example of a Federal statute -- I\nmean, it is unusual to say, States, you can no longer\ndecide how your authority is going to be exercised. An\nordinary mode of a State exercising its authority is to\ndelegate it to localities. Apart from this statute, is\nthere any other Federal statute that says, State, you may\ndo it but you may not delegate it to a regional or local\nor municipal unit?\nMR. CORDRAY: There are two responses to that\nquestion. The first is the example that was already given\nwhich is when the Federal Government puts a grant to a\nmunicipality full stop and doesn't allow the State to\ncontrol the use of that grant, that's an example like\nthis.\nBut the other point I would make is throughout\nits history, Congress has --\nQUESTION: Well, that's a State -- that's --\nthat's --\nMR. CORDRAY: May I --\nQUESTION: -- Congress giving money to a\nmunicipality. I asked an instance in which Congress says,\nState, you may do it but you, State, may not delegate.\nMR. CORDRAY: I know of none, but this is a new\ndeparture for Congress. They have always taken free\nmarkets and sought to regulate them. Here they're taking\na market they had regulated and the States and localities\nhad regulated and they're now trying to deregulate it.\nThat's a new development and it calls for new measures.\nAnd the measure here was to try to clear away all this\nunderbrush of -- of State and local restriction --\nQUESTION: Since it was -- since you say it's\nsingular and this is new, wouldn't you expect Congress to\nmake a clear statement that the State may not delegate\nthis authority because --\nMR. CORDRAY: Congress did make a clear\nstatement by including the term, political subdivision,\nwhenever it wanted political subdivisions to either have\nauthority or be restricted in that authority, and then\nspecifically speaking only to States here. There could\nnot be a clearer statement of that. Why else ever use the\nterm, political subdivision? That is unexplained.\nQUESTION: And the State may not delegate this\nauthority to a political subdivision. Just as simple as\nthat, to negate what has been the assumption all along.\nMR. CORDRAY: They could have used the term\nState everywhere alone and then said, State but not\npolitical subdivision, here. Or they could this term,\nState and political subdivision, everywhere and omit the\nterm, political subdivision, here. Those are the same\nmeaning and they're the same purpose.\nAnd again, canons of construction have been\ndenigrated in this case, but they have to do with the\nnatural and ordinary reading of statutes. The baseline\nthat Congress uses to draft laws in some confidence that\nthe executive branch and the courts will interpret them as\nCongress meant them, and that's exactly what's --\nQUESTION: The executive branch. Now, you -- I\nknow you have said, and I quite agree, that the Department\nof Transportation has no supervisory authority, it has no\nChevron deference. But doesn't it deserve some respect\nfrom the courts simply because it has familiarity with the\narea of motor carrier regulation that the courts don't?\nMR. CORDRAY: That's a -- that's a statement I\ncouldn't disagree with more strongly. The Solicitor\nGeneral here has conceded they have no authority to\nadminister this statute. The notion that you have a --\nQUESTION: They've not conceded the Department\nof Transportation -- you -- deserves no respect.\nMR. CORDRAY: The -- the notion that a\nderegulatory statute that took governmental entities out\nof an area to create a free market would now be subject to\numpiring by the Federal agency, in terms of the scope of\npreemption, which is an issue this Court has always said\nis for the courts to determine --\nQUESTION: I didn't say umpiring. I said its\nviews on the proper construction of this statute. What\nweight, if any, should this Court give to the Department\nof Transportation's view, this is what the statute means?\nNot as an umpire, not as a referee.\nMR. CORDRAY: Their construction is to leave\nthem as an umpire. But I would say certainly not Chevron\ndeference. At most some sort of Skidmore respect, but\nthat's only entitled where there's some sort of reason to\nthink that before they got to their litigation position\nhere, which has migrated in the course of this case -- it\nstarted off as an argument about repeal by implication.\nIt's now turned into argument about sort of reading\nstatutes together to import them into this statute -- is\nentitled to really, I think, no respect here because it is\nnot persuasive. They have not analyzed the statute in\ndetail --\nQUESTION: Well, if -- if you lose, you know --\nMR. CORDRAY: -- in any of their prior --\nQUESTION: If you're changing your argument --\nyou know, if you lost in the lower court, you'd probably\nbe well advised to change your argument.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. CORDRAY: I wouldn't disagree with that,\nYour Honor. But again --\nQUESTION: Mr. Cordray, what -- what about the\npoint made that if -- if you accept your interpretation,\nmunicipalities not only would not be able to enact\nregulations themselves, they would not be able to enforce\nregulations adopted by the -- by the State, which would be\na great inconvenience, that the only enforcement can be by\nthe State police and not by local -- local police.\nMR. CORDRAY: We agree, but that's not what this\npreemption clause is about or any preemption clause is\never about. When they say enact or enforce here, they\ndon't use it in the terms of making law and executing the\nlaw. They use it in the -- in the sense of enacting new\nlaw or applying -- or enforcing and applying preexisting\nlaw.\nAnd the point of this preemption clause is to\nsay that municipalities do not have the authority to act\nin this realm by imposing their own public policies. It's\na matter of either new law or preexisting law. That's the\nstructure of many of these preemption statutes the Court\nhas dealt with.\nQUESTION: If we think this statute is -- that\nthere are arguments either way for interpreting it,\nshouldn't we pay heed to the petitioners' point that it's\na very serious matter for the Congress of the United\nStates to tell States how they should govern themselves?\nMR. CORDRAY: We think the language of the\nstatute is clear here, Your Honor. They explicitly\nextinguished the power of the municipality --\nQUESTION: Let's -- let's say we -- we disagree\nwith that. Is -- is that not -- let's say we find the\nstatute in -- in equipoise, or the arguments. Should we\nnot give force to the argument petitioner makes that the\nStates should be presumed to have the authority to\ndetermine how best to govern themselves?\nMR. CORDRAY: No. There's no substantive Tenth\nAmendment issue here. There's no commandeering of States\nor local governments to enact some sort of program. This\nis the same as the Court in Wolens where they said this\nstatute must be read to say the State cannot legislate in\nthis area, but they can enforce contracts through their\ncourts. There's no Tenth Amendment problem with that.\nThat's Congress exercising its power under the Supremacy\nClause, anything in the laws or constitution of the States\nnotwithstanding.\nAnd as the Solicitor General said in the brief\nin the Mortier case, the notion that when Congress decided\nthat there could be State regulation but they had to\npreempt local regulation, that they would somehow have to\nbe forced to preempt State regulation as well, simply\nturns the Tenth Amendment on its head. So, we don't think\nthat there's any -- any serious constitutional issue here.\nQUESTION: It seems to me your argument boils\ndown to the point that there are 10 provisions in the\nstatute. Nine of them are perfectly clear. The tenth\nsays the same thing, but we're not going to read it the\nway it seems to read because it's not as clear as the\nother nine.\nMR. CORDRAY: No, that's not what it boils down.\nQUESTION: That's about all it amounts to.\nMR. CORDRAY: It boils down to the fact that\nCongress deliberately inserted a phrase here, political\nsubdivision of a State, so that it can preempt --\nQUESTION: In the -- in the nine, right.\nMR. CORDRAY: And -- and it --\nQUESTION: If you just read the one all by\nitself, it's perfectly clear too.\nMR. CORDRAY: Well, it's -- it is clear, I\nbelieve, because it's clear because they said a State\ncannot -- a political subdivision cannot --\nQUESTION: But the only reason --\nMR. CORDRAY: -- and they state the authority of\na State to do certain things.\nQUESTION: The only support you have is they're\nnot as detailed and specific in the one in question as\nthey are in the other nine.\nMR. CORDRAY: No. I think it is equally\ndetailed and specific. And -- and there's no rationale\nfor Congress legislating in this way or drafting this\nlanguage or enacting it unless they intended to make a\ndifference. That's -- that's the whole purpose of\nincluding that language.\nQUESTION: Your support is the context of the\nstatute, which --\nMR. CORDRAY: No. Text and context. Text and\ncontext. That's correct.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Cordray.\nMr. Sutton, you have 4 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY S. SUTTON\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. SUTTON: I'd like to respond to a few of the\npoints --\nQUESTION: Mr. Sutton, could you ask one --\nanswer one factual question for me? Your -- your brother\nmade the argument that in -- in reading (c)(2)(A), he went\nto the last clause and said on your theory every political\nsubdivision could enact its own financial responsibility\nand insurance laws and so on.\nMR. SUTTON: Yes.\nQUESTION: And that would be a crazy scheme. My\n-- my question is, is there in fact any history of\nmunicipalities enacting these kinds of statutes so that\nit's something that might have been in Congress's mind?\nMR. SUTTON: No, Your Honor, not in -- in the\ninsurance area. But there's a -- I think a better answer\nto that concern, and the better answer is, our point is\nthat (c)(2)(A) incorporates all of these preexisting\npreemption provisions. They are preemption provisions in\nother parts of title 49, whether it's insurance, safety,\nsize and weight routing, or hazardous material routing.\nSo, the problem with Justice O'Connor's point of\npractical consequences -- in reversing the Sixth Circuit,\nthere is no gap here. Why? Because for 60 years,\nCongress and the Department of Transportation have been\nregulating these very areas, both with respect to State\nlaws and city laws, to the extent they've been enacted.\nSo, the multiplicity of insurance regulations is a false\nconcern. I mean, the -- Congress has already indicated in\n31138 and 39 what the rules are there. The Department of\nTransportation has implemented regulations that do get\nChevron deference, and they lay out what the rules are.\nQUESTION: The same problem, you didn't, is --\nto me anyway, is -- is (3)(A). Do you see what I'm\nthinking? I mean, the same human being at the same time\nwrote the words in -- in (c)(2)(A) and he used the word\nState, and at precisely the same time, he wrote the second\nexception, which is (3)(A) --\nMR. SUTTON: Right.\nQUESTION: -- and he put in political\nsubdivision. And what I cannot get over is I don't see\nhow a single human being on the same day at the same time\ncould write two exceptions, use the word \"State\" in one\nand use the word \"political subdivision\" in the other,\nwithout meaning a difference.\nMR. SUTTON: Right. Your Honor, look -- compare\n(3)(A) to (c)(1). They follow the exact same enact or\nenforce language. (c)(2)(A) does not use the enact or\nenforce language.\nQUESTION: That's the answer.\nMR. SUTTON: That's the answer, number one.\nNumber two, remember, (c)(3) is for the benefit\nof motor carriers. They want to make sure they could have\nthese rules, whether city or State, apply to them on a\ncity-by-city not State-by-State basis.\nNow, the -- the regulatory purpose, Your Honor\n-- the landmark legislation in this area was the 1980 law\nthat deregulated interstate commerce. Everyone agrees\nthat did not divest cities of authority.\nThe 1994 law at issue here was about intrastate\ncommerce, primarily to put FedEx and UPS on a level\nplaying field, and suddenly respondents are saying that\nderegulated -- regulatory purpose required the divestment\nof local authority?\nQUESTION: Well, what's -- what's Congress's\nauthority to regulate intrastate commerce?\nMR. SUTTON: It's at its outer edges, and that\nto me is what is so odd about this particular\ninterpretation. They're saying in the intrastate area,\nyou could divest States of their authority to delegate,\nbut they've not done it in the interstate area? I mean,\nhow absurd is that? It's -- it's got it exactly\nbackwards.\nNow, the practical consequences -- I want to go\nback to again -- of their interpretation. (c)(2)(A),\nthey've agreed, has to be construed the same way\nthroughout, and there are countless -- as we indicated in\nour opening brief, every State in the country has\ndelegations to cities that have size and weight controls,\nsize and weight rules that would be eliminated by this\nparticular construction.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr. Sutton.\n"
