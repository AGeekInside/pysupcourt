SHAH\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. SHAH: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces,\nor CAAF, held that military appellate courts possess\nopen-ended jurisdiction under the All Writs Act to\nentertain a coram nobis challenge to the merits of a\nfinal court-martial conviction. This Court should\nreverse that decision, both because the All Writs Act\ncannot supply jurisdiction that Congress chose not to\nconfer and because Respondent is a civilian who may no\nlonger invoke the military court system.\nAs this Court explained in Clinton v.\nGoldsmith, military courts, as Article I courts, are\nstrictly limited to the bases of jurisdiction conferred\nupon them by the Uniform Code of Military Justice, or\nUCMJ. Three related aspects of the UCMJ make clear that\nit does not confer jurisdiction over Respondent's coram\nnobis petition.\nFirst, as noted in Goldsmith, the UCMJ\nnarrowly circumscribes military appellate jurisdiction\nto the findings and sentences of a court-martial\nconviction. That is a direct review jurisdiction. UCMJ\nArticles 66 and 67, which define appellate jurisdiction,\ndo not contemplate any further review within the\nmilitary appellate courts.\nSecond, once direct appellate review is\ncomplete and the military authority executes the\njudgment, UCMJ Article 76 affirmatively forecloses any\nfurther military court review. As this Court has\nrecognized on two prior occasions, UCMJ Article 76 marks\nthe terminal point of proceedings within the\ncourt-martial system.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Shah, how does that\ndiffer from the general rule that a judgment becomes\nfinal and has preclusive effect once the appellate route\nhas been exhausted or the time to pursue it has expired?\nIt seems to me that Article 76 simply codifies the rule\nthat applies ordinarily in criminal cases, in civil\ncases, stating when a judgment becomes final for\npreclusion purposes.\nMR. SHAH: Your Honor, yes, Article 76 does\nthat, but it does more than that. As this Court\nrecognized in Gusik and in Councilman, it marks the end\nof proceedings within the military court system.\nNow, beyond the text, what this Court looked\nat in Gusik -- in Gusik, it was a Petitioner seeking\nhabeas review. One of his alternative arguments in\nGusik was that Article 76 essentially violated the\nSuspension Clause because it -- it marked the end of --\nno further proceedings within the military court system\nas well as within the Article III court system. The\nCourt agreed with the Petitioner that Article 76 marked\nthe end of any further proceedings within the military\ncourt system. It disagreed that it also effected a\nrepeal of Article III habeas jurisdiction, but there was\nno disagreement between the Petitioner, the government,\nand this Court in Gusik that it did mark the end of\nproceedings within the military court system.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So therefore one could say\nthat that point wasn't decided in the case, right?\nMR. SHAH: Well, Your Honor, one could say\nthat, but this Court again in Councilman ratified that\nline that the Court drew in Gusik. It -- it reiterated\nthe reasoning that Article 76 forecloses any further\nproceedings within the military court system. So I\ndon't think it's just dicta. It was relevant to its\ndenial of the Suspension Clause claim, and the Court\nreiterated that in Councilman 25 years later.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Where in your view, in\nthat the government is putting forward, can this -- can\nDenedo go? He said, I was misinformed by my counsel. I\nnever would have entered a plea if I had known I would\nbe subject to deportation. And he said, I never found\nout about it until what, 8 years later, when the\ngovernment -- 8 years after his conviction, the\ngovernment said, you're subject to deportation. Where\ncan he go with that plea?\nMR. SHAH: Your Honor, it appears that\nRespondent no longer has any further remedies to -- to\npursue. But we think the important point is that in a\ngeneral -- in the general case, Petitioner is bringing\n-- the exact same claim the Respondent is bringing is\nnormally going to have several avenues of remedy outside\n--\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: We're assuming now,\nbecause we haven't gone any further than his plea, that\nhe was so misinformed and he didn't lack diligence in\nfailing to bring it earlier, that he was surprised by\nthe government's action, so he was unaware and,\ntherefore, unable to make this plea any earlier. You\nhave given us the answer that it's too bad, he's just\nout of any court.\nMR. SHAH: Well, Your Honor, I think it's\nimportant to note that the UCMJ marks the high-water\nmark of process within the military justice system.\nWhat the UCMJ did is it took the prior system, which\ndidn't even allow for real direct review within the\nmilitary court system, and it made that direct review\nsystem much more robust. It added an intermediate court\nof review. It took administrative review that was\nembodied within boards of tribunals that had typically\nbeen under the Judge Advocate General. It moved that\nout and gave it greater independence to provide more\nrobust intermediate appellate review. It added an\nentire level of a new court, the Court of Appeals for\nthe Armed Forces, which provided additional -- a new\nlevel of review. And then it said still --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, part -- part of\nindependence is the assurance that the court has the\nability to do justice in the case before it, and I think\nthe purpose of coram nobis or coram vobis is to protect\nthe integrity of the court, and that's all this court is\nasking. So that's quite consistent with what you've\njust said.\nMR. SHAH: Well -- well, Your Honor, in\nenacting the UCMJ, Congress was balancing several\nvalues. On the one hand, it was balancing the rights of\nservice members, but at the same time, it was balancing\nthe important value of maintaining good order and\ndiscipline within the armed -- within the armed forces,\nmindful of the military's primary mission in fighting\nwars and defending the nation.\nNow, given those competing values, it was --\nit was reasonable for Congress to draw a line at some\npoint and say it, the conviction is final and to the\nextent you want to seek further collateral review you\nhave to go to the civilian system to seek that review.\nThat -- that line is reasonable not only from a\nhistorical standpoint, but also from a practical\nstandpoint, given the institutional limitations --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But is there collateral\nreview available in the civilian system in your view?\nMR. SHAH: Yes, as a general matter there's\n--\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I mean in this case.\nMR. SHAH: In this case, Respondent no\nlonger has any reviews because the time has passed.\n2241 would --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: So the answer is no in\nthis case?\nMR. SHAH: No, there is no further review,\nYour Honor, in this case. Now, as a general matter\nthere are ample avenues of review within the civilian\ncourt system. For the entire time that a Petitioner\nwould be confined, he can seek 2241 habeas relief in the\nFederal court system. Even after --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Shah, you just said\nsomething about -- you answered my question and Justice\nStevens' question: This person is out because it's too\nlate for him. He was convicted in what, was it --\nMR. SHAH: 1998, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes. And the government\nnever said anything about deportation until 2006? And\nthey went through -- he twice applied for\nnaturalization, is that correct?\nMR. SHAH: That is correct, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And he was turned down on\ngrounds that had nothing to do with deportation. The\ngovernment never alerted him to the possibility that he\nwould be deportable. They turned down his application\nwith no hint of that, and you say that he is -- he's out\nof time, but nothing counts against the government\nbecause of that 8-year lapse?\nMR. SHAH: Right. Your Honor, in the\ndenials I agree with you that they did not alert him to\ndeportation, but it based its denials on his military\ncourt convictions. So to that extent he was somewhat on\nnotice that the military court convictions were posing a\nproblem to his citizenship, potential citizenship\nstatus.\nNow, it is true, you're absolutely right,\nthat the government did not begin deportation\nproceedings until October 2006, and until that time he\nwas not on notice, but the fact that this particular\nclaimant -- that the time has run should not be\ndispositive. For example --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, the time -- I mean,\nthe time may very well run in the civil system, and yet\nI take it that under -- you accept Morgan and in the\nArticle III system this -- in comparable circumstances,\nthis Petitioner could seek coram nobis.\nMR. SHAH: Right. There are two reasons,\nYour Honor --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And I take it you also -- I\ndon't think there's any dispute that the All Writs Act\napplies to the Article I court as well as to the Article\nIII court. And I take it -- and I would like your\nresponse to this. I take it you accept the fact that in\ntestimony before the House, at least, at the time the\npresent system went into effect the general counsel for\nthe Department of Defense, Mr. Taft, testified to a\nHouse committee that coram nobis would be available in\nthe -- in the Article I courts. And if that is so,\nisn't the kind of the most reasonable way to construe\nthe statute, including Article 76, as allowing for this?\nMR. SHAH: No, Your Honor. Mr. Taft's\ntestimony that you're referring to was not given at the\ntime of enacting of the UCMJ.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: What was the occasion for\nit?\nMR. SHAH: That was during a subsequent\namending process of the act.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: What were they amending at\nthe time?\nMR. SHAH: It was I think it was in terms of\nthe 1983 amendments to the UCMJ. There have been\nseveral --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: You're way ahead of me\nbecause I don't know what the '83 amendments would refer\nto. What was the subject matter?\nMR. SHAH: Okay. Well, what Mr. Taft was\ntestifying to, we believe, are -- he was -- the specific\ntestimony that Mr. Taft was giving was related to the\nboards of correction, I believe, and whether that the\nboards of correction should retain jurisdiction review\nof final court-martial judgments, so his testimony was\nrelated to that distinct issue.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Now, with respect to the\nboards of correction, I take it there's nothing\nspecifically in the statute that says there's coram\nnobis jurisdiction?\nMR. SHAH: Nothing specific in the UCMJ?\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yes.\nMR. SHAH: There's nothing specific in the\nUCMJ --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Now, if he was right about\nthat, that would undercut your argument that, with\nrespect to a special court-martial and subsequent\nproceedings, there could be no coram nobis because\nthere's no specific reference in the statute in either\ncase?\nMR. SHAH: No, Your Honor. What Mr. Taft\nwas testifying to was the state of the prevailing law in\n1983 before the CAAF. The fact that Congress did not\namend the UCMJ in light of Mr. Taft's testimony -- this\nCourt has said on multiple occasions that we don't read\ninto congressional silence --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Oh, I quite agree. The\npremise of my -- sort of my argument to you a second ago\nwas that if we accept the proposition that Mr. Taft was\nmaking a correct statement of law --\nMR. SHAH: Right.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- then the logic would in\neffect answer your argument that because there is no\nspecific grant of coram nobis jurisdiction with respect\nto special court-martials and subsequent proceedings,\nthere couldn't be any. That's the only point that I was\ntrying to make.\nMR. SHAH: Your Honor, I don't think we can\nread that into the silence, and here's why. We have\nmuch more precise legislative history on this very\npoint. At the time the provision was enacted, at the\ntime the UCMJ was enacted, there was Article 73 of the\nUCMJ provides one means of collateral review within the\nmilitary justice system once a court-martial conviction\nis final, and that's a new trial petition, which is\nlimited to certain subject matter and certain time\nlimits.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: It is pretty limited. What\nis it, it's limited to fact and fraud.\nMR. SHAH: To fraud on the court and newly\ndiscovered evidence.\nThe person who drafted that provision --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Is it available to\nsomeone who enters a guilty plea?\nMR. SHAH: It does not appear it would be\navailable to someone who has entered a guilty plea. The\ngovernment is not aware of any cases where the military\nhas granted an Article 73 petition to someone who has\npled guilty.\nBut the important point is at the time that\nprovision was enacted, the person who drafted that\nprovision testified before Congress and said, we've\nconsidered the universe of post-conviction remedies, and\nspecifically named coram nobis relief, and said that\nwe've looked at it and we think the only circumstances\nthat warrant appeal within the military court system\nbeyond coram nobis are those stated within or including\ncoram nobis are those stated within Article 73\nspecifically.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: May I ask you just -- and\nI'm doing this from memory, so my premise of the\nquestion may be wrong. But I do recall the quotation of\ntestimony in the brief, and I -- if I recall it\ncorrectly, the person testifying said that the 73 was\nsort of a combination of coram nobis and new -- and new\ntrial motion practice. But my recollection was that\nthere was no statement, or at least it wasn't quoted in\nthe briefs, to the effect that this is all there is.\nNow, there was -- it was explaining what 73\ndid, but it was not an explanation to the effect that if\nyou didn't get under the tent flap in 73 you were out\ncompletely. Am I correct about that?\nMR. SHAH: Well, I'll read the testimony to\nyou, Justice Souter.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.\nMR. SHAH: And this appears on pages 25 to\n26 of the government's brief, and it says: \"What we did\nwas to combine what amounts to a writ of error coram\nnobis with a motion for a new trial on newly discovered\nevidence. We have provided for both of them and to our\nminds they are the only additional circumstances over\nand above the appeal that need a remedy.\"\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay, I see.\nMR. SHAH: So I think that's conclusive on\nthis point and provides a firm ground on which to\ndistinguish this Court's decision in Morgan, which you\nreferenced earlier, that applies coram nobis in the\nArticle III system. Congress considered it for the\nArticle I system and rejected it in the military courts.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Does that mean that your\nargument boils down to the proposition that the relevant\nprovisions of the UCMJ were intended to eliminate coram\nnobis, or is there more to your argument than that?\nMR. SHAH: I don't think it's to eliminate\ncoram nobis. It was never available within the military\ncourt system.\nJUSTICE ALITO: All right. Well, then I'm\nnot quite sure I understand your argument. Maybe you\ncan explain why you contend that if the Respondent had\nbeen convicted in a Federal district court and\neverything else was the same, he would be able to\npetition for a writ of coram nobis, but he can't in the\nmilitary courts. What is the basis for that? Both a\nFederal district court -- a Federal district court is a\ncreature of statute. It has the jurisdiction that\nCongress gives it and no greater jurisdiction. It has\ncertain what's been termed inherent authority. The All\nWrits Act applies to it. All of those things are true\nof the military courts as well. So what is the basis\nfor the distinction?\nMR. SHAH: There are two distinctions, at\nleast two distinctions, Your Honor. The first is in the\nFederal court system there is an independent basis of\njurisdiction when someone is bringing a Federal\nconstitutional challenge, collateral challenge to their\nconviction. That separate independent basis of\njurisdiction is 1331. There is -- there is independent\nbasis of jurisdiction. The All Writs Act does not\nconfer jurisdiction. The Court made that very clear in\nGoldsmith. What it requires is an independent basis of\njurisdiction. That exists in Article III courts. It\ndoes not exist in the military court system. That's the\nfirst distinction.\nThe second distinction, Your Honor, even if\nthis Court wasn't convinced by that jurisdictional\nargument, is that Congress specifically considered\nwhether to -- to allow coram nobis petitions within the\nmilitary court system. The All Writs Act was designed\nto be a residual source of authority to fill gaps within\nthe system. It is not --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well -- well, that, as I\nunderstand, was the argument I started out with: That\nthe --Your argument is that the UCMJ was intended to\neliminate coram nobis if it had been previously\navailable. That's your -- that's the argument you're\nmaking now?\nMR. SHAH: Well, again, I would -- I would\nquibble with the characterization to -- to -- that it\nwas previously available. As of the enactment of the\nUCMJ in 1950, coram nobis relief had never been\navailable within the military justice system.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, what is the difference\non the face -- on their face between the relevant\nprovisions of the UCMJ and the provisions that govern\nthe ability of a criminal defendant in Federal district\ncourt to get relief after being convicted? There are\nlimited avenues that are provided under the Rules of\nCriminal Procedure and under the statutes --\nMR. SHAH: Right. Right.\nJUSTICE ALITO: -- just as there are in the\nUCMJ. What -- what is the difference?\nMR. SHAH: The difference is significant,\nYour Honor. In the -- in the military court system\nthere is only one avenue for post-conviction relief.\nThat is, after your -- and I'm speaking after your\ndirect review -- appellate review process has been\ncomplete, there's only one, and that is the Article 73\nnew trial petition. Of course, in -- in the Article III\nsystem there are several independent grants of\njurisdiction, the habeas jurisdiction --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But I thought the Morgan\ncase said that coram nobis was not dependent on any\nindependent basis of jurisdiction. Didn't the Court say\nthat a coram nobis application challenging a conviction\nis a step in the criminal case and not like habeas,\nwhere relief is sought in a separate case and record,\nthe beginning of a separate proceeding?\nMR. SHAH: Right. In -- in Morgan, Your\nHonor, the Court was refuting the argument that 2255,\nsection 2255, occupied the field and, therefore there\nwouldn't be a coram nobis petition. It rejected that\nargument. But I don't think the rejection of that\nargument means that coram nobis, which is still a\nresidual source of authority, is available when Congress\nhas specifically rejected its application within the\nArticle I system.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but -- but you're\nshifting ground a little bit. The tenor of the\nquestions from Justice Alito and Justice Ginsburg really\nis to the effect: Does coram nobis require an\nindependent source of -- of jurisdiction? And I should\nthink not.\nMR. SHAH: Well, your --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: The whole idea of coram\nnobis is to protect the integrity of the jurisdiction\nthe court already has.\nMR. SHAH: Your Honor, this Court could not\nhave been clearer in Goldsmith. It says the All Writs\nAct requires an independent basis, an existing\nindependent basis of jurisdiction.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I -- I acknowledge that.\nBut there is a source of jurisdiction here. Coram nobis\nis to ensure the accurate exercise of jurisdiction that\nthe court has earlier asserted.\nMR. SHAH: With respect, Your Honor, I would\nargue that the past jurisdiction in this case does not\nconstitute an existing basis of jurisdiction.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But suppose -- suppose that\nthe problem was a professional soldier convicted a\ncertain number of years ago of a particular crime, a few\nyears later through some amazing mistake they wrote the\nwrong number down. The clerk just wrote the wrong\nnumber of the code provision. That's all.\nMR. SHAH: Okay.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And it made it a felony\ninstead. It was actually a misdemeanor. What's he\nsupposed to do? I mean, normally you go back to the\nCourt and say: Judge, you know, they just made --\neveryone admits it's a simple transcribing error. Would\nyou please correct it? Now, how -- how is that supposed\nto work in the military?\nMR. SHAH: If he is still within custody --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes. No, he's -- he's\nfinished his sentence. This is several years ago. They\njust now discovered it, and it could affect him in the\nfuture that it happened in fact to be a misdemeanor he\nwas convicted of. But the -- the code section they\nwrote down is a felony.\nMR. SHAH: Well, if the military isn't\nwilling to correct that sort of error on its own as an\nadministrative matter and that he needs some judicial\nforum to --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes. Yes, that's right.\nMR. SHAH: -- to get relief, he can go to\nthe Court of Federal Claims and bring a Tucker Act\naction. There is a 6-year statute of limitations.\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, this is 7 years.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. SHAH: Well -- well, then, Your Honor,\nhe probably wouldn't have a judicial forum.\nJUSTICE BREYER: He can't even do that. So\nnobody in the military, in fact, once their thing is\nfinal -- then it has nothing to do with it, in your\nview, that he has left the military?\nMR. SHAH: Well --\nJUSTICE BREYER: You are saying -- you are\nsaying, whether you are in the military, whether you are\nout of the military, no matter how egregious, no matter\nhow obvious, there is no route for a military person, a\nprofessional, to go and get an obvious error corrected\nif -- if he has missed the statute, that there was an --\nthe civil statute of limitations, it's hard for him to\ngo to the Tucker Act. He's been in the Philippines the\nentire time.\nMR. SHAH: Justice Breyer, to make your\nhypothetical work he has to no longer be in custody. He\nhas had to have discovered this error 6 years after the\nconviction has happened.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes, it happened. It\nreally happened.\nMR. SHAH: The military would have had to\ndeny this -- correcting his --\nJUSTICE BREYER: What I'm trying to do is\nsuggest that I think you -- I can't quite decide what\nstool you want to rest on. Part of this you say, well,\nhe's a civilian that has left the military. And then I\nread that. It seems to have nothing to do with it. But\nyour other argument seems to be that doesn't matter.\nMR. SHAH: Well --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No military soldier can\ncorrect an error, no matter how egregious, even a\ntechnical -- you know, they just wrote the wrong thing\ndown, because Congress didn't want them to. Now, I\ndoubt that Congress thought about that. I'm just not\nsure they didn't want them to.\nMR. SHAH: Well -- well, Your Honor, once\nagain, your hypothetical, I think there would be an\nadministrative recourse there. And, of course, there's\nalways the fail-safe of a presidential pardon if the\nobvious -- if the error is that obvious and that\negregious.\nNow, you did refer to a second argument,\nwhich is an independent argument, which is that the\nmilitary courts lack jurisdiction for the independent\nreason that Respondent -- it's an independent reason,\nYour Honor, that he lacks any remaining connection to\nthe armed forces and, therefore, cannot invoke the\nmilitary courts. This Court held in Toth v. Quarrels\nthat Congress lacks power under Article I to extend\nmilitary court jurisdiction over a civilian.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I know, but that's --\nthat's a different -- that's a different issue from --\nfrom whether it -- it may retain some residual\njurisdiction to correct an error with respect to someone\nover whom it has had jurisdiction.\nMR. SHAH: Your Honor, once again, that\nwould be relying on the long-expired past jurisdiction.\nIt is --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, you -- you made that\npoint before. And I -- I want to follow up with one\nquestion on that. As I recall, it was in response to\nthe -- to the Morgan argument. The -- the Morgan\nanalysis was, well, this isn't a -- a new ground or a\nnew assertion. It is jurisdiction as would be the case\nin habeas. It, in effect, is -- is kind of a\nmetaphysical continuation of the -- the jurisdiction\nthat existed before.\nAnd your response to that was, in effect, a\nGoldsmith response. And -- and you said past\njurisdiction doesn't mean present jurisdiction. The\npast jurisdiction is over, and that's under -- under the\nstatute and under Goldsmith that's -- that's the end of\nit.\nCouldn't that same argument simply have been\nmade, however, in -- in Morgan? In other words, Morgan\nwas a case in which the point of finality had been\nreached. There was no specific statute in Morgan saying\nthere's coram nobis jurisdiction, and yet the Court's\nanalysis -- I -- I called it metaphysical a second ago\n-- was that this really was simply a continuation of the\npast jurisdiction. If that was a sound argument in\nMorgan, why isn't it a sound argument with respect to\nthe -- the military code here?\nMR. SHAH: Well, because the military --\nCongress specifically contemplated that possibility, and\nnow I'm going back to my Article 73 argument, Your\nHonor, and to the legislative history which shows what\nCongress was trying to do in Article 73. That is, to\nencapsulate whatever post-conviction remedy it's\nintended to be available within the military court\nsystem appears in Article 73 that considered coram\nnobis.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: It -- it did do that, and\nthere's -- there is no question that it certainly made\nfinality provisions in Article 76. But in the civilian\nsystem, so far as express provision is concerned, there\nare limits. There are statutes of limitations, and it\nseems to me that the same argument could be made there\nthat was made here --\nMR. SHAH: Well, I think this --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- that was made there.\nMR. SHAH: Your Honor, I think the structure\nof the military court system is different than the\ncivilian system, and -- and that goes back to --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Outside of 1531, is there\nany structural difference?\nMR. SHAH: Yes, Your Honor. In the military\ncourt system, Article 76, even though it was first\nenacted in 19 -- in 1950, there were other provisions\nanalogous to it. It's always been understood within the\nmilitary system that once a conviction was final and the\nmilitary authority executed the judgment, that was it in\nterms of review within the military justice system, save\nfor a presidential pardon. Any further relief to be\nobtained was through an Article III habeas petition in\nthe Federal courts. That's the understanding that\nCongress had when it enacted the UCMJ, and that's the\nunderstanding --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: You could say the same\nthing, that when the statute of limitations is passed in\na habeas case or, indeed, after habeas has been fallen,\nso far as the statutes governing Article III courts are\nconcerned, that's the end. And yet Morgan says, no, it\nisn't the end. There's this coram nobis jurisdiction.\nMR. SHAH: Well, the difference is in\nMorgan, the Court specifically said that Congress did\nnot intend to occupy the field when it passed 2255\ngoverning habeas relief for Federal prisoners. That's\nnot the situation here. We know that Congress intended\nto occupy the field when it passed Article 73.\nSo regardless of the jurisdictional\narguments, Your Honor, there's no right of action,\nthere's no right of coram nobis relief within the\nmilitary courts.\nYour Honor, if there are no further\nquestions, I would like to reserve the remainder of my\ntime for rebuttal.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMR. SHAH: Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Freedus.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MATTHEW S. FREEDUS\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. FREEDUS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nBecause there are courts, appellate military\ncourts must have coram nobis power to protect the\nintegrity of their judgments. The court of appeals\ncorrectly asserted the same coram nobis power that\nArticle III courts have.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What do you mean, \"they\nmust\"? Do you think it's unconstitutional to deprive\nthem of that?\nMR. FREEDUS: No, Your Honor. We believe\nthat they were given the All Writs Act authority as a\nbirth right in 1950, and that includes all prerogative\nwrits, including coram nobis.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's what you mean by\n\"they must have\"?\nMR. FREEDUS: And also, Your Honor, they\nmust have the ability to protect the integrity of their\njudgments just like other Federal courts have. The\nsuperior court in D.C. has the power to issue coram\nnobis to protect its judgments.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's fine, but -- but is\nit unconstitutional for Congress to say military courts\nare different, they've always been different, the need\nfor finality is greater there, and we're conducting a\ndifferent rule for there?\nMR. FREEDUS: I think Congress has the\nauthority to legislate very broadly in the area of\ncollateral remedies, and Congress could take away the\nwrit of coram nobis if it left in its place an adequate\nand effective substitute, like it did in 2255.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, oh, oh, so it would be\nunconstitutional if they did not leave in its place an\nadequate and effective substitute --\nMR. FREEDUS: Our view is that if --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- which would cover every\nsituation no matter how fanciful, right?\nMR. FREEDUS: No, Your Honor. We believe\nthere has to be reasonable opportunity to bring a\ncolorable constitutional claim for which there is no\nother avenue of relief, which we believe is the case\nhere.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What -- which case\nof ours establishes the proposition that there always\nhas to be an available avenue of relief?\nMR. FREEDUS: The best authority we have for\nthat, Your Honor, is Webster v. Doe, which we believe\nstands for the proposition that courts should read\nstatutes so as not to preclude judicial review of a\nconstitutional claim absent an express congressional\nintent to do so --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's\ndifferent than saying there always has to be available\nrelief. That's saying you think Congress usually\nintends there to be available relief. And that would be\na doubtful assumption here, given the rather clear\nexpressions of finality that -- that are -- that are in\nthe UCMJ statutes.\nMR. FREEDUS: On -- well, if I could make\ntwo points, Your Honor. On the first, we don't believe\nthat there is square authority for the bedrock\nconstitutional proposition that Congress can wipe away\nall avenues of relief for a claim. We believe that we\nwere --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You don't -- you\ndon't think there's authority for the proposition they\ncan do it?\nMR. FREEDUS: Correct.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm looking for\nauthority that says they can't do it.\nMR. FREEDUS: I'm not aware of any, Your\nHonor. We would -- I think we are --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Did -- did coram nobis\nrelief -- you say it has to be there. Was it ever used\nbefore in the military courts?\nMR. FREEDUS: Yes. I would like to -- yes,\nYour Honor, it has been used since 1966. I assume you\nmay be asking about before 1950.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Indeed, yes.\nMR. FREEDUS: Yes. Well, the reason it\nhasn't happened before 1950 is that the UCMJ was created\nin 1950, and that was the first time there were military\ncourts. There were no courts, so therefore no All Writs\nAct authority prior to 1950.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Worse still. My goodness.\nSo you were --\nMR. FREEDUS: Absolutely.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- convicted by a\ncourt-martial and had no basis for -- for getting that\nrevised, and that -- that lasted for a couple of hundred\nyears, right? And that was okay or it wasn't okay?\nMR. FREEDUS: That was -- I think that's the\nimpetus behind the UCMJ, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that's fine. I mean,\nyou can patch it up and say that they thought it wasn't\na good idea to have just military courts. But it's very\nhard to make the constitutional argument you're making\nwhen for a couple hundred years in military, in military\ncourts, which are different, there -- there was no\nrelief at all.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Will you clarify something\nfor me. Are you contending that the result you seek is\nconstitutionally compelled? I didn't think you were.\nMR. FREEDUS: Not -- no, not -- we aren't,\nYour Honor. I was more responding to the Chief\nJustice's --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And you were saying it is.\nJust say, no, it's not constitutionally compelled and\nI'll be happy.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. FREEDUS: No, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: You might say that there\nis a lurking constitutional question and that we ought\nto interpret the statute to avoid a constitutional\nconcern.\nMR. FREEDUS: I think, Your Honor, that's\nthe best answer that I should have given.\n(Laughter.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I don't like it very\nmuch.\nBut what is -- your argument is that the\nConstitution does not require that this person have,\nright now, an available avenue of relief, your position?\nMR. FREEDUS: We don't have square authority\nfrom this Court to support that proposition.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So then it comes, as\nJustice Kennedy suggested, a question of whether or not\nwe should read the statutes here in a particular way to\navoid confronting that question?\nMR. FREEDUS: Yes, Your Honor, I think\nwhere -- we're comfortably in that neck of the woods and\nwe really don't need to get closer to the scarier\nquestion that was alluded to. I think --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: When you say it's lurking,\nyou're -- you're invoking the doctrine of constitutional\navoidance?\nMR. FREEDUS: Yes, Your Honor, we are.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Okay.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't think it's much of\na lurk when for 200 years this was going on. It's not\nlurking to my mind.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But you are making -- I\nthought that the core of your argument is that the All\nWrits Act applies to all courts established by Congress,\nthe military courts are included in that definition, and\nthere is nothing in the All Writs Act that says it\ndoesn't apply to the military. But the All Writs Act\nrequires that the writ be in aid of the court's\njurisdiction. So if you would spell out how the writ\nhere is in aid of the military court's jurisdiction.\nMR. FREEDUS: Yes, Your Honor. We believe\nit does it in a very similar way that this Court\nexplained in the United States v. Morgan, and that is\nthe writ of coram nobis aids the past appellate\njurisdiction that the Navy court had when it affirmed\nand reviewed Mr. Denedo's conviction. It had\njurisdiction there.\nAnd the coram nobis writ by its very nature\nallows a court to correct an error in a case that was\nbefore it, but it failed to perceive that error while it\nhad the case before it. And had it known the facts we\nnow know after all the remedies are no longer available,\nthe Court would not have issued the judgment that it\nissued.\nThat's the -- in that sense, that's how the\nwrit aids the jurisdiction the Court had in the past.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, if that's so, then I\nguess you can have courts reviewing the civilians. They\nwill review after the event the court-martial\njurisdiction, the court-martials of people while they\nwere in the military. That will become a matter of\ncourse anytime. I mean, there are many, many errors.\nWe have approximately 5,000 petitions a year claiming\nsome kind of constitutional error, and sometime they're\nright.\nMR. FREEDUS: Yes, sir.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So that's what you foresee?\nMR. FREEDUS: I would -- yes and no.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What way is it no?\nMR. FREEDUS: No is when the individual is\nnot in custody and the six-year statute of limitations\nhas expired for all the types of claims that are\navailable for collateral tactic of a court-martial\nconviction, a declaratory judgment attack, a mandamus\nattack, Court of Federal Claims attack, all those --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Why -- in other words, in\nthe case I posed, he would -- he -- in your view, he\nwouldn't have any remedy, you would agree with the\ngovernment about that, if it's seven years later you\nfind a clerical error?\nMR. FREEDUS: We agree. But we don't think\nit's necessary, actually, to decide the issue here. The\nissue here really is whether coram nobis is --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, if, in fact, you're\nwaiting until the -- the civil courts have lost all\njurisdiction because the statute of limitations has\nexpired, why do you need this? Why can't they just go\n-- I mean, why do you need this special thing that\nhasn't existed for 200 years? Why don't they just go to\na civil case? And moreover, why doesn't your client\nfall within that situation?\nYou're claiming that if all the statutes\nhave run and everything, there is no coram nobis\njurisdiction, I thought in your case they had all run.\nMR. FREEDUS: This gets to the other piece\nof the answer I was trying to give, and that is a\npetitioner from the military system could not file a\ncoram nobis petition in the Article III courts or the\nCourt of Federal Claims because there's no authority\nthat supports the proposition that you can take a coram\nnobis petition and attack a judgment from a different\njurisdiction. Coram nobis has to allow the court that\nissued -- that -- that --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Then you're saying that\nwhat you're foreseeing is through coram nobis,\nindefinitely, a person outside the military who once was\nin it can bring constitutional challenges?\nMR. FREEDUS: Yes, Your Honor, in the\nmilitary justice system.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes, okay, and we see those\nevery day, don't we? But there is one difference. The\ndifference is that often, though not always, a person in\nhabeas who challenges a prior normal, civil system\nconviction, the State can retry him; and I guess in the\ninstance that we're talking about, he can never be\nretried. So in fact the difference would be, in your\nview, the civilians who bring this would never be\nretried if they're right.\nMR. FREEDUS: That's correct, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And so they would have in\nthat sense greater protection in the military system\nthan in the ordinary criminal courts a person has in\nhabeas, because the option of retrial is often but not\nalways there. Now, why would Congress have intended\nthat?\nMR. FREEDUS: I think it's the very nature\nof the coram nobis petition, Your Honor, and that is\ncoram nobis petitioners have already served their entire\nsentence, so the societal interest to seek a retrial is\nmuch lesser than in the habeas case where there's a\nlengthy sentence less -- left, and if someone gets out\nof jail --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but the\ncollateral consequences of the conviction are pretty\ndramatic. In this case they decide whether the guy\nstays in the country or is deported.\nMR. FREEDUS: Yes, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, so I think\nJustice Breyer's question is still on the table. Why\nwould Congress intend to afford greater relief and\nremedies to somebody who's outside -- was within the\nmilitary system and is now outside, than to an ordinary\ncivilian under Article III jurisdiction?\nMR. FREEDUS: I think there is a classic\ndistinction between the habeas and the coram nobis\npetitioner. In a coram nobis petitioner under 2255, if\nthey were to file a successful petition long after a\nstatute of limitations had expired, they would be in no\ndifferent position than a coram nobis -- a successful\ncoram nobis petitioner in the military.\nWe would say, we do believe there's a -- a\ncolorable argument for -- the ability to retry Mr.\nDenedo, but it's not pivotal to our case. Our view is\nthat the inability --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Where? Colorable --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: In the civilian courts or\nthe military courts?\nMR. FREEDUS: The military courts, Your\nHonor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I think you have a good\nanswer to what my question was. I thought that was a\ngood answer. It's helping me. And -- but where I'm\nslightly -- and maybe this is just not relevant to this\ncase or maybe it's for the future. Coram nobis, I\nthought, was a writ that means really like technical\nclerical errors or something really unusual. Is this --\nI mean, it's hardly ever there. I've not really seen\nmore than a handful of cases.\nSo -- so is this writ supposed to be\navailable for what you're claiming is what I call a\ntypical error of inadequate representation? And I don't\nknow the answer to that question, but I think it's --\nmaybe you could say that's not presented. Maybe that's\nfor a later case. I don't know how to treat it. That's\nwhy I'm asking.\nMR. FREEDUS: I think Morgan is helpful on\nthat, Your Honor. Morgan is a violation of the right to\ncounsel, and it's this Court's --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But was -- that question\nwasn't resolved, was it? I thought we were just talking\nabout the authority of the military courts to issue this\nwrit, and the question that Justice Breyer has raised,\nwell, is this ineffective assistance of counsel adequate\ngrounds to issue the writ? I thought that question was\ncertainly not raised before this Court.\nMR. FREEDUS: Well, the government hasn't\nurged that there's no ineffective assistance of counsel.\nIt's not in their opening --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, let's assume it\nraised because Justice Breyer asked the question --\nMR. FREEDUS: Yes.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- and I would be\ninterested in the answer.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I knew it was.\nMR. FREEDUS: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I thought it might be your\nanswer: Well, that isn't raised. And that would be a\nperfectly good answer.\nMR. FREEDUS: That's -- that's why --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I'm telling you my honest\nproblem which I'm trying to think through: Where are we\ngoing with this?\nMR. FREEDUS: I think --\nJUSTICE BREYER: What's going to happen one\nway or the other way? That's why I asked the question.\nSo all I'm asking is your best thought on it.\nMR. FREEDUS: Yes, Your Honor. I think\nUnited States v. Kwan and United States v. Castro are\ntwo court -- two cases that give the answer to your\nquestion and both of those indicate that ineffective\nassistance of counsel in very similar factual\ncircumstances to this is a basis for coram nobis relief\nafter -- after the ineffective assistance is discovered.\nWe recognize this Court has granted in --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Military courts now since\n1950 have quite a record of saying coram nobis is\navailable in these courts. However, they have routinely\nthrown out the cases on the merits. Is there any case\nwithin the military where the military has said anything\nlike inadequate assistance of counsel qualifies as a\nreason to grant the writ?\nMR. FREEDUS: Aside from this -- this case\nbelow, Your Honor, I don't know of a case that raised\nineffective assistance of counsel. And you are correct\nthat the vast majority of these cases are thrown out of\ncourt in the most -- in the briefest of orders. There\nare cases where relief has been granted. They are few\nand far between. Del Prado is one. It involved a\ncompositional jurisdictional error to the -- to the\ncourt. An individual failed to elect military judge\nalone in writing and waived the right to have a -- a\nmember's jury trial, and that was deemed a\njurisdictional defect. And long after the case was\nfinal the conviction was set aside, and I would note the\nCourt in that case observed the personal jurisdiction\nwas no obstacle to granting the coram nobis relief.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Was that person retried, do\nyou know?\nMR. FREEDUS: I do not know, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Was he still in the\nmilitary?\nMR. FREEDUS: I do not know. He was -- the\nrelief -- the decretal paragraph of the -- of the\ndecision indicates that he was restored all rights and\nbenefits, but it stops shy of saying, you know, here's\nyour uniform back.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Do I understand correctly\nthat since 1989 there were a total of 30 coram nobis\npetitions filed, and of those only 4 were granted?\nMR. FREEDUS: The statistics that we cited\nin our brief, Your Honor, were ten coram nobis petitions\nat the court of appeals within the last 10 years --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes.\nMR. FREEDUS: -- and 176 writ appeals from\nthe lower courts up to the court of appeals that don't\nbreak out the category of writs. They could be habeas,\nthey could be coram nobis, mandamus, so we don't know\nwhat percentage of the 176. But even if it was a -- a\nsignificant percentage, it's still a tiny percentage of\nthe court's overall docket.\nBut they are rarer than hen's teeth, Your\nHonor. These cases, one a year maybe would be the\naverage of a coram nobis --\nJUSTICE BREYER: What is the theory of the\njurisdiction of the military court in the circumstance\nwhere the individual is still in the military, he's been\nconvicted, and he is in custody? So he wants to get out\nof custody. Now, what's the theory of that? He can --\nI take it it's accepted, is it, that they can, that such\na person can ask the military justice system -- I don't\nknow which court -- for release on the ground that he\ndidn't -- wasn't adequately represented or some other\nground?\nMR. FREEDUS: That would be a habeas case,\nYour Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. It's a habeas\ncase. Now, do you have -- can you do that in the\nmilitary?\nMR. FREEDUS: Yes. There are --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And what's the theory of\nthe jurisdiction that the military courts have over\nthat?\nMR. FREEDUS: It's similar in that it's All\nWrits Act authority aiding the --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Aiding what jurisdiction?\nMR. FREEDUS: The direct review authority of\nthe military --\nJUSTICE BREYER: But they've already\ndirectly reviewed it.\nMR. FREEDUS: Correct. And that's --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So there is no more direct\nreview to be had?\nMR. FREEDUS: That's correct, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So how does this aid the\ndirect review that is to be had, since there is none?\nMR. FREEDUS: It aids it in the same way\nthis Court recognized it can do so in Goldsmith, where\nit acknowledged that a mandamus writ could issue after\nfinality --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I see.\nMR. FREEDUS: -- to compel adherence to the\ncourt's own judgment, so that --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Within -- within the\nmilitary system?\nMR. FREEDUS: Yes, Your Honor, within the\nmilitary justice system. In that -- in Goldsmith it was\na situation where Goldsmith was out of the -- you know,\nout of the military. He had a final -- I guess he was\nin custody, Cut he had a final court-martial conviction,\nand this Court indicated that a writ of mandamus could\nissue to aid past appellate jurisdiction to compel\nadherence to the --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: All within the\nsystem. I mean, the difference with this case is that\nyou're talking about somebody who is, I guess that's the\nissue, out of the military system.\nThe problem with your position is that it\nwould dramatically expand the jurisdiction of the\nmilitary system. It would sort of follow everybody\nthey've dealt with around for their life, right?\nMR. FREEDUS: The fact --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: At any time somebody\nwho is out of the military system, whose judgment is\nsupposedly final under the provisions that Congress has\nestablished, he could come back and knock on the door 20\nyears later and say, I want to review my conviction.\nMR. FREEDUS: That's correct, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And he would be\nwithin the military system.\nMR. FREEDUS: He would be a civilian, former\nservice member --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right.\nMR. FREEDUS: -- filing a coram nobis\npetition, and the coram --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And he's back in the\nmilitary system, 20 years later.\nMR. FREEDUS: For purposes of the coram\nnobis petition.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: In coram nobis cases in\nthe civil system, do courts appoint special masters when\nthey're an appellate court and they have to find out if\ncoram nobis was --\nMR. FREEDUS: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Or do they use district\ncourts as special masters?\nMR. FREEDUS: They --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: In this case, the court\nhad to invent a procedural device: There's going to be\na new court-martial, which is a little odd because it's\na new court-martial sitting in judgment on somebody who\nisn't even in the military any more.\nMR. FREEDUS: It's not a court-martial, Your\nHonor. It's what's called a DuBay proceeding, and what\nhappens is -- and this in the decretal paragraph of the\ndecision below. A remand is for further factual\ndevelopment, and if the case can be disposed of on\ndeclarations, if the government came forth -- it didn't\ndo so below -- but if it did so on remand and provided\naffidavits that blew our affidavits out of the water,\nthe court could dismiss the petition out of hand.\nIf they couldn't do that or if there is a\ncredibility contest that needed to be resolved, what\nwould happen is the court would order what's called a\nDuBay hearing, where a judge is appointed. And it's\njust like an evidentiary hearing. Witnesses are\npresented and they're cross-examined and then findings\nof fact and conclusions of law are drawn. And then that\nis put into a record, added to the record of trial, and\nreviewed in the coram nobis petition.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But all of that is\nextra-statutory in your -- this instance?\nMR. FREEDUS: We don't believe so. We\nbelieve the court -- the Navy court here has decisional\nauthority under Article 66 to do factfinding. It's a\nvery unique court. Congress created these courts with\nfactfinding power, which is different than I think\nvirtually all appellate courts, save maybe one or two\nunusual situations. But these courts have factfinding\npower, so it's right in Article 66. And these courts\nalso have rulemaking authority. And so does the court\nof appeals, and it has exercised that to provide for\nthese procedures. So we don't believe --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Where are -- where are the\nprocedures set out for -- for military habeas?\nMR. FREEDUS: They're not, and actually that\n-- that -- this Court pointed that out in Noyd v. Bond.\nIt said that military appellate court have habeas power,\nbut the court of appeals hadn't provided rules, and\nCongress could facilitate with rules but hadn't, but\nthat didn't stop this Court from saying habeas power\nexisted. The absence of the procedure --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Are you -- are you arguing\nthen that if it has habeas power without a -- a textual\nbasis, there's no reason to argue that it lacks coram\nnobis power because there's no textual basis?\nMR. FREEDUS: I think the answer to that is\nyes. The negative in there caught me. But, yes, I\nthink that's what we're saying.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But this Court has never\nheld that the military courts have habeas jurisdiction?\nMR. FREEDUS: Yes, it has, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: In what case?\nMR. FREEDUS: In Noyd v. Bond this Court\nsquarely held that military -- the Court of Appeals at\nthe time has habeas authority.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: For someone still\nwithin the military system?\nMR. FREEDUS: That was the case where the\nindividual was pending appeal, I believe.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So the answer --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But that was --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- to Justice\nGinsburg is that we have never held that with respect to\na situation like the facts here, where you're dealing\nwith somebody who is outside -- long departed from the\nmilitary system?\nMR. FREEDUS: Well, I would -- I would\ndirect the Court's attention, if I could, to footnote 11\nof Goldsmith, where this Court says: \"And of course,\nonce a criminal conviction has been finally reviewed\nwithin the military system, and a servicemember in\ncustody has exhausted other avenues provided under the\nUCMJ to seek relief from his conviction\" -- citing Noyd,\nthe six pages therein which refers to the military\ncourt's habeas power -- this Court in Goldsmith put\nhabeas power in the context of a -- a final case, so\nhabeas authority after final relief.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's talking about somebody\nstill within the military, if I -- if I heard the quote\ncorrectly, right?\nMR. FREEDUS: An individual is out of the\nmilitary if they -- if their dismissal has been executed\n-- or their discharge has been executed and they're in\nLeavenworth. They could even be moved to another\nFederal penitentiary and still in custody.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The --\nMR. FREEDUS: So they're not really in the\nmilitary.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The quote you referred to\nfrom Goldsmith says: \"And a servicemember in custody.\"\nSo I think Goldsmith, in that footnote that you're\nciting, is presenting a service member still in custody,\nhaving exhausted all other areas, can come to a Federal\ndistrict court and seek habeas. It's not talking about\nsomeone who is out of the military.\nMR. FREEDUS: I read it differently, Your\nHonor. I read it -- the next clause in that sentence is\nreferring to habeas outside. I read this sentence as\nclearly saying that there's direct review. There's\nhabeas after direct review within the military. And\nthen there's of course collateral review in the Article\nIII courts, if -- if everything misfires within the\nmilitary justice system.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, what am I missing?\nI thought that the footnote reads once a criminal\nconviction has been finally reviewed within the military\nsystem a service member, having exhausted all other\nareas, can petition in a Federal district court for a\nwrit of habeas corpus. I don't see anything that talks\nabout someone who is no longer a service member.\nMR. FREEDUS: Right. I -- I see the\nin-custody and exhausted avenues provided in the UCMJ as\nreferring to a phase before you get to the Article III\ncourts. Obviously, if I'm reading it wrong, the Court\nwill let me know, but I read that as prior to Article\nIII review.\nIf I could talk briefly about the 1983\nlegislation -- it came up in opposing counsel's opening.\nI think it sheds a lot of light on the availability of\ncoram nobis relief. When Mr. Taft testified, he wasn't\nsimply giving his -- he wasn't simply stating the state\nof the law. He was providing the state of the law as a\npremise for legislative action, in particular stripping\ncollateral review authority from the correction boards,\nwhich used to be able to review collaterally, after\nfinal judgment, military convictions. And that existed\nbefore the UCMJ was enacted.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: This is -- this is\nat a hearing. This isn't a Member of Congress,\nobviously, that we're talking about. It's not even a\nsingle Member of Congress?\nMR. FREEDUS: This is the chief counsel for\nthe Department of Defense proposing the legislation and\noffering the only premise there was for the particular\nlegislative change that I'm referring to, which is\nstripping the -- the correction boards of this\ncollateral review power and saying, when we do that,\ndon't worry, Congress, because it will channel these\ncollateral -- post-final collateral attacks into the\nmilitary courts, and -- and they can have habeas. He\nsays habeas -- I'm sorry --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Under the specific\n--\nMR. FREEDUS: -- coram nobis.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Under the specific\nprovision that was at issue, which is accompanied by\nvery strict finality provisions.\nThere's no suggestion in his testimony that\nthe availability of the relief that he's talking about\ncontinues after the individual is outside the military\nsystem. He's channeling -- he says these are channeled\nthrough a specific provision applicable only within the\nmilitary system.\nMR. FREEDUS: I don't read it that way, Your\nHonor. I read it as channeling apt post-final attacks\nwithin the military -- within the courts in the military\njustice system, even though the person is -- is -- a\nfinal judgment typically happens before an individual is\nno longer in the service. A final judgment is final\nbecause the discharge has been executed. So what he's\nreferring to is, once you have a final judgment, you\nthen can seek collateral relief in the military the way\nyou used to be able to do it in the correction boards in\nthe military courts. And he was saying, now that we're\ngetting rid of this one collateral remedy in the\ncorrection boards, we're giving you this other one.\nWe're not giving -- we're just channeling all of them\ninto the military appellate courts, which is a more\nappropriate judicial forum. And he says clearly it\nwould denigrate the courts to have administrative bodies\noverturning their judgments, once again showing that\nthese are final judgments that we're talking about. And\nthe only -- that was the only premise he offered to make\nthe change.\nSo stripping away one remedy while leaving\nanother intact was the single premise, which is\nreflected in the House -- the Senate report on page 52\nof our brief, where Congress adopts the exact language\nout of his sworn testimony with, you know, a tiny\nvariation, but that's the premise for the change in the\nlegislation.\nI'd also note that, in that legislation,\nthis is the Department of Defense proposing to open the\ndoor to this Court's jurisdiction for the first time in\n-- in 28 U.S.C. 1259. And when it did that -- it had to\nsurvey the whole landscape of military justice\njurisdiction, and when it did that, it saw there were\ndirect review cases, which are reflected in 1259\nparagraphs 1, 2, and 3, and this other category that is\ndefined by what's not in paragraphs 1, 2, and 3, and\nthat's the All Writs Act cases. The government\nacknowledges --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry. I've had\nthe chance to go back and look at the Senate report, and\nlike Mr. Taft's testimony, there's no suggestion in\nthere that the relief he's talking about continues after\nsomeone is out of the service.\nMR. FREEDUS: I think that's implicit in\nfinal judgment, Your Honor. If there's a final\njudgment.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, a final\njudgment is subject to review in the appellate courts\nwithin -- in the military system, just like you have --\na final court of appeals judgment is subject to review\nin our system.\nMR. FREEDUS: Your Honor, the -- the key\ndifference is that -- two things: He's referring to\npost-finality, which means that the discharge or the --\nyou know, the sentence has been executed. The person is\nout. They're a civilian at that point. And coram\nnobis, by its very nature, is someone who is not in\ncustody. So I don't think it's too much of an inference\nto read that what he is saying here is --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, you have\nreview in the appellate system. Someone is -- the\njudgment is they're to be discharged, and they seek\nreview. Are they discharged while the review is going\non?\nMR. FREEDUS: No, on direct review, you're\nright, Your Honor. They're -- they remain within the\nservice, and it's interesting that the government cites\nMr. Taft's testimony as authoritative on that point.\nAnd that -- that makes good sense. Keep the person in\nfor a direct review so that if the sentence is set\naside, we can retry.\nBut there has been decades of\nmilitary justice authority that says even if someone is\ndischarged before their conviction is set aside -- so\nthey're on direct review, their conviction is set aside,\nafter they're already out in their civilian world, you\nknow, doing whatever they're doing -- if the government\nwants to retry them, they do. And the government is --\nis the party that asserts continuing jurisdiction to\nre-prosecute.\nAnd that's why this case is so\ndistinguishable from Toth v. Quarles, because in Toth\nthere was no conviction while the individual was on\nactive duty. And that's why there couldn't have been a\nretry. Here there was conviction on active duty, which\nis where jurisdiction attaches. It cements in. And if\nthe government wants to invoke that to retry Mr. Denedo,\nit can try that.\nI would say, though, that if --\nif there were a personal jurisdiction loophole here,\nlike there was for the MEJA, the Military\nExtraterritorial Jurisdiction Act, Congress could fix it\nin a heartbeat. But we're talking about, you know, ten\ncases in ten years. So even if someone, you know, got\naway without retrial --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You -- you don't\nthink that if you prevail in this case, we're going to\nsee a lot more coram nobis petitions than we did before?\nMR. FREEDUS: I -- I think there would be an\nuptick, and there may actually have been an uptick while\nthis case has been up here at this level, because it has\n-- it has gotten a lot of visibility in the military,\njust like there was an uptick after Noyd v. Bond when\nthis Court declared for the first time that military\ncourts had All Writs Act power.\nSo I think there could be an uptick. But\nonce the novelty of it wears off, I think we will see\nlevel off. And you will see the same trend that we have\nseen since 66 when it was available the first time. I\nmean this isn't new. The only thing new here is the\ngovernment's interpretation of Article 66.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMR. FREEDUS: Thank you, Your Honor.\nMr. Shah, you have three minutes remaining.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Shah, could you tell us\nwhat the government's position is on whether, when\nsomebody has been discharged from the service and then a\nconviction which he -- which he suffered while he was in\nthe service is set aside, can he be retried in military\ncourts?\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PRATIK A. SHAH\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. SHAH: Not if he has passed his\nenlistment period, no, Your Honor. The government's\nview is they would not be able to retry him.\nI would just like to make four quick points\nin response. First, to the Chief Justice's question,\ncould someone be in custody after finality? Of course,\nyes, that -- that could be the case. The military\ndoesn't have to issue a bad conduct discharge as part of\nits sentence. He could still be in confinement within\nthe military during the post finality period.\nThe second point I would like to make is\nthat Noyd v. Bond is clearly distinguishable. That\ndealt with habeas review within the military while the\nperson was still pursuing his direct appeal. So there\nwas a clear, independent basis of jurisdiction in the\nNoyd v. Bond type situation, and that's the Article 66\nand 67 direct review jurisdiction, and that --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: What has direct review got\nto do with habeas?\nMR. SHAH: Well -- well, Your Honor, the --\nthe habeas would be in aid of the direct review\njurisdiction. In -- in Noyd -- in the Noyd v. Bond --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: In the civil system we\nregard it as -- as entirely a separate proceeding.\nMR. SHAH: Well, what was going on in Noyd\nv. Bond, Your Honor, is he was pursuing a habeas\npetition for release pending the -- the resolution of\nhis direct appeal. So the military courts just referred\nthe petition to the same court reviewing his direct\nappeal on the merits, and it became part and parcel of\nthat jurisdiction.\nThe third point I would like to -- to make\nis in response to Justice Kennedy's question, which\nshows the incompatibility of coram nobis relief within\nthe military justice system. That they've had to create\nthis DuBay procedure where -- where a new court-martial\n-- and DuBay sets this out. The new court-martial does\nhave to be convened, and then they would have a\nfactfinding tribunal in which new -- a new military\njudge would have to be assigned to govern it.\nNone of that is specified within Congress's\nscheme. That has all been created. It shows the\nincompatibility of the practical burdens that this\nprocedure places on the military, and nothing in Article\n66(c) which governs the jurisdiction of the military\nappellate courts, the intermediate courts, references\nany independent factfinding power. It says in a case\nreferred to it, the court of criminal appeals may act\nonly with respect to the findings and sentence as\napproved by the convening authority. It may affirm only\nsuch findings of guilty and the sentence or such part or\namount of the sentence as it finds correct in law and\nfact and determines on the basis of the entire record.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why don't you\nbriefly make your fourth point.\nMR. SHAH: The fourth -- fourth point is in\nresponse to Justice Breyer. My military colleagues\ninform me that in the situation of a true clerical\nerror, they could go to the Board of Correction of\nMilitary Review and seek correction of that error.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
