GURA: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nAlthough Chicago's ordinances cannot survive\nthe faithful application of due process doctrines, there\nis an even simpler, more essential reason for reversing\nthe lower court's judgment. The Constitution's plain\ntext, as understood by the people that ratified it,\nmandates this result.\nIn 1868, our nation made a promise to the\nMcDonald family; they and their descendants would\nhenceforth be American citizens, and with American\ncitizenship came the guarantee enshrined in our\nConstitution that no State could make or enforce any law\nwhich shall abridge the privileges or immunities of\nAmerican citizenship.\nThe rights so guaranteed were not trivial.\nThe Civil War was not fought because States were\nattacking people on the high seas or blocking access to\nthe Bureau of Engraving and Printing. The rights\nsecured by the Fourteenth Amendment were understood to\ninclude the fundamental rights honored by any free\ngovernment and the personal guarantees of the --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Of course, this\nargument is contrary to the Slaughter-House Cases, which\nhave been the law for 140 years. It might be simpler,\nbut it's a big -- it's a heavy burden for you to carry\nto suggest that we ought to overrule that decision.\nMR. GURA: Your Honor, the Slaughter-House\nCases should not have any stare decisis effect before\nthe Court. The Court has always found that when a case\nis extremely wrong, when there is a great consensus that\nit was simply not decided correctly, especially in a\nconstitutional matter, it has less force.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What injustice has --\nhas been caused by it that we have to remedy? Meaning\nStates have relied on having no grand juries; States\nhave relied on not having civil trials in certain money\ncases; they have relied on regulating the use of\nfirearms based on us, the Court, not incorporating the\nPrivileges and Immunities Clause in the way that you\nidentify it.\nMR. GURA: State --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What -- in which ways\nhas ordered liberty been badly affected?\nMR. GURA: Justice Sotomayor, States may\nhave grown accustomed to violating the rights of\nAmerican citizens, but that does not bootstrap those\nviolations into something that is constitutional.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Are you saying that the\nrights -- if you could clarify your conception of\nprivileges and immunities. Am I right in thinking that\nto keep and bear arms would be included even if we had\nno Second Amendment, as you envision privileges and\nimmunities?\nMR. GURA: Justice Ginsburg, that is\ncorrect. The framers and the public understood the\nterm --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But -- just tell us the\ndimensions of what it is. I mean, we have the eight\namendments, so I know you say that's included. Keep and\nbear arms would be included even absent the Second\nAmendment. What unenumerated rights would we be\ndeclaring privileges and immunities under your\nconception of it?\nMR. GURA: Although it's impossible to give\na full list of all the unenumerated rights that might be\nprotected by the Privileges and Immunities Clause, just\nas it's impossible to do so under the Due Process\nClause, at least with respect to the Privileges and\nImmunities Clause we have wonderful historical\nguideposts. There are --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Gura, do you think it's\nat all easier to bring the Second Amendment under the\nPrivileges and Immunities Clause than it is to bring it\nunder our established law of substantive due process?\nMR. GURA: It's --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Is it easier to do it under\nprivileges and immunities than it is under substantive\ndue process?\nMR. GURA: It's easier in terms, perhaps,\nof -- of the text and history, the original public\nunderstanding of --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No, no. I'm not talking\nabout whether -- whether the Slaughter-House Cases were\nright or wrong. I'm saying, assuming we give, you know,\nthe Privileges and Immunities Clause your definition,\ndoes that make it any easier to get the Second Amendment\nadopted with respect to the States?\nMR. GURA: Justice Scalia, I suppose the\nanswer to that would be no, because --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And if the answer is no,\nwhy are you asking us to overrule 150, 140 years of\nprior law, when -- when you can reach your result under\nsubstantive due -- I mean, you know, unless you're\nbucking for a -- a place on some law school faculty --\n(Laughter.)\nMR. GURA: No. No. I have left law school\nsome time ago, and this is not an attempt to -- to\nreturn.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I mean, what you\nargue is the darling of the professoriate, for sure,\nbut it's also contrary to 140 years of our jurisprudence.\nWhy do you want to undertake that burden instead of just\narguing substantive due process? Which, as much as I\nthink it's wrong, I have -- even I have acquiesced in it.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. GURA: Justice Scalia, we would be\nextremely happy if the Court reverses the lower court\nbased on the substantive due process theory that we\nargued in the Seventh Circuit. And, indeed, had the\nSeventh Circuit accepted our substantive due process\ntheory, which was our primary theory in the court below,\nwe might not be here, or perhaps we would be here in a\ndifferent posture.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But that -- that court\ndoes not have the prerogative to overturn any of this\nCourt's decisions, and I think it said -- said as much.\nSo it was kind of a pass-through in the court of\nappeals.\nBut I really would like you to answer the\nquestion that you didn't have an opportunity to finish\nanswering, and that is: What other enumerated rights?\nWhat does the privileges and immunities of United States\ncitizenship embrace?\nMR. GURA: Of the unenumerated rights,\nJustice Ginsburg?\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes.\nMR. GURA: Well, the framers clearly used\nlanguage that to them meant rights beyond those\nguaranteed in the first eight amendments. And whenever\nthey spoke about those unenumerated rights, they gave\nsome concrete examples. So I think that there might be\ntwo categories of unenumerated rights if a claim were\nbefore the court under that provision.\nIf a right is, for example, the sort of\nright that was mentioned in the Civil Rights Act of\n1866, the piece of legislation enacted by a\nsupermajority of Congress, where the Congress said, over\nPresident Johnson's veto, here are the rights of\nAmerican citizenship, and they are -- they listed: To\nmake and enforce contracts; to sue, be parties, and give\nevidence; to inherit, purchase, lease, sell, hold, and\nconvey real and personal property. That's the sort of\nright that would be easy to find because there is a\ncontemporaneous source for telling us --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Even though -- even\nthough a large portion of the population at that time\ndidn't have those rights?\nMR. GURA: The large -- the population at\nthe time that did not have those rights needed their\nprotection, primarily in the South, which is why the\nCivil Rights Act --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: No, throughout --\nthroughout the nation at the time.\nMR. GURA: I'm sorry.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Did married women at that\ntime across the nation have the right to contract, to\nhold property, to sue and be sued?\nMR. GURA: Married women were considered\ncitizens of the United States, just like children were\nconsidered citizens. However, the law did not always\nprotect people fully, and we've made great strides in\nthis country giving a greater level of protection to --\nto certain rights. We understand certain rights better\ntoday than we did 140 years ago, and the fact that First\nAmendment rights weren't fully respected, Second\nAmendment rights weren't always respected, Fourth\nAmendment rights were not always understood well --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Does it work just one\nway? I mean, if the notion is that these are principles\nthat any free society would adopt, well, a lot of free\nsocieties have rejected the right to keep and bear arms.\nMR. GURA: As we mentioned -- as we\nmentioned in our brief, this Court in Benton v. Maryland\ndecided that henceforth American history and tradition\nare important to consider what rights are protected in\nthis country. It's true that our friends overseas who\nhave more or less civilized, free societies don't\nrespect rights to the same level that we do. For\nexample, England, which is a free society, has a\nmonarchy. They have hereditary lords in parliament.\nThey don't have First Amendment protection.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But this -- then it's not\none expression of this unenumerated rights, natural rights,\nor the rights that any free society -- basic to a free\nsociety. So you -- you have to trim your definition.\nIt's not basic to any free society.\nMR. GURA: As understood by the people who\nratified the Fourteenth Amendment. It's not a\nfree-flowing license, necessarily, for judges to\nannounce unenumerated rights. However, to the extent\nthat we have unenumerated rights which the framers and\nratifiers didn't literally understand, they nonetheless\nleft us guideposts that we can --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, what about rights\nrooted in the traditions and conscience of our people?\nWould -- would that do the job?\nMR. GURA: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That happens to be the test\nwe have used under substantive due process.\nMR. GURA: That's correct and, as Judge\nO'Scannlain --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes.\nMR. GURA: -- in the Ninth Circuit observed\nin the Nordyke decision, the Slaughter-House dissenters\nseemed to arrive at the same point, perhaps, that this\nCourt did in the Glucksberg case.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Gura, can I ask you\nthe same question Justice Ginsburg asked about: What if\nthere were no Second Amendment? You say the right would\nstill be protected under the Privileges and Immunities\nClause. What about -- would it also be protected under\nsubstantive due process if there were no Second\nAmendment?\nMR. GURA: It would be, Your Honor. The\nfact --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Because of the -- the\nimportance of the right to protection -- and would that\napply to the entire scope of the Second Amendment or just\nthe right to keep the gun, a homeowner's right to keep a\ngun for self-protection against intruders into the home,\nunder the -- without the Second Amendment, just the\nLiberty Clause?\nMR. GURA: The Second Amendment is not so\nlimited and neither is the right to arms, even outside\nthe Second --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I'm assuming we don't have\na Second Amendment for purposes of the substantive due\nprocess analysis. I'm asking you what is the scope of\nthe right to own a gun that is protected by the Liberty\nClause of the Fourteenth Amendment? Is it just the\nright to have it at -- at home, or is the right to\nparade around the streets with guns?\nMR. GURA: An unenumerated right to arms in\nthe absence of the Second Amendment would be, perhaps --\nprobably identical to that secured by the Second\nAmendment, because the Second Amendment codified the\nunderstanding of that right that people have\nhistorically had in the country. So there would not be\na difference between the right to arms if it were a part\nof the Second Amendment or --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, I thought your --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: In -- in that\ncontext, is your position that the rights that are\nincorporated as essential to the concept of ordered\nliberty, do they bring all of our decisions with them?\nWhen you say the First Amendment is covered, does that\nmean New York Times v. Sullivan is incorporated as well?\nOr is it only some lesser version of the incorporated\nright?\nMR. GURA: With respect to the substantive\ndue process argument that we're making?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes.\nMR. GURA: We are not challenging -- we are\nnot the party that's before the Court that is\nchallenging anything that has gone on before in terms of\nsubstantive due process. We believe that those cases\nwere by and large decided appropriately, and if the\nCourt wishes to reconsider any of them for some reason,\nit -- that has really nothing to do --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: No, I understood the Chief\nJustice's question -- maybe I misunderstood it, but my\nunderstanding of the question as important is this:\nUnder incorporation by reference, the States are bound\nby the rights in all -- with all of the refinements and\nsophistication with which we interpret them for the\nFederal Government. It's the same. You don't just\napply the core of the right. You apply all of the right\nas it is elaborated by the cases.\nIs -- is that same consequence -- does that\nsame consequence follow if we adopt the privileges and\nimmunities interpretation that you are urging upon us?\nMR. GURA: Yes, Your Honor, because --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay. How does that work?\nI think that would be useful for either you or\nMr. Clement, if you've thought this through. Is this\nright different from others?\nMR. GURA: Well --\nJUSTICE BREYER: There are two ways. One is\nthat -- look at -- all you have to do is look at the\nbriefs. Look at the statistics. You know, one side\nsays a million people killed by guns. Chicago says that\ntheir -- their gun law has saved hundreds, including --\nand they have statistics -- including lots of women in\ndomestic cases. And the other side disputes it. This\nis a highly statistical matter. Without incorporation,\nit's decided by State legislatures; with, it's decided\nby Federal judges.\nNow, think of this, too: That when you have\nthe First Amendment, or some of the other amendments,\nthere's always a big area where it's free speech versus\na whole lot of things, but not often free speech versus\nlife. When it's free speech versus life, we very often\ndecide in favor of life. Here every case will be on one\nside guns, on the other side human life. Statistics,\nbalancing life versus guns. How are Federal judges in\nyour opinion, rather than legislatures in the States in\na Federal system -- how are Federal judges supposed to\ncarry this out? I want to see where we're going.\nMR. GURA: Federal judges should carry this\nout in the same way that was announced in this Court's\ndecision in Heller. So --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Heller, I didn't think,\nexplained that with great -- I was dissenting,\nthough. I didn't think it explained it with total\nclarity, but that's a dissenter's view.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. GURA: Heller stood for the proposition\nthat some activities are within the core boundaries of a\nright, and so long as people wish to do something that\nis literally understood to be a part of the boundaries of\nthe right, it is to be protected, and --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Let me be specific, suppose\nChicago says, look, by banning handguns not in the\nhills, not hunting, nothing like that, nothing outside\nthe city -- in the city, we save several hundred human\nlives every year. And the other side says, we don't\nthink it is several hundred, and, moreover, that doesn't\nmatter. How do you decide the case?\nMR. GURA: We decide that by looking, not to\nwhich side has the better statistics, but rather to what\nthe framers said in the Constitution, because that\npolicy choice was made for us in the Constitution.\nThey --\nJUSTICE BREYER: You're saying they can\nhave -- no matter what, that the City just can't have\nguns even if they're saving hundreds of lives -- they\ncan't ban them.\nMR. GURA: The City cannot ban guns that are\nwithin the common use as protected by the right to arms.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: There's a lot of\nstatistical disagreement on whether the Miranda rule\nsaves lives or not, whether it results in the release of\ndangerous people who have confessed to their crime, but\nthe confession can't be used. We don't -- we don't\nresolve questions like that on the basis of statistics,\ndo we?\nMR. GURA: That's correct, Justice Scalia,\nand as your opinion --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, why would this one be\nresolved on the basis of statistics? If there's a\nconstitutional right, we find what the minimum\nconstitutional right is, and everything above that is up\nto the States.\nMR. GURA: That --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: If they want to have, you\nknow -- I think we mentioned in Heller concealed carry\nlaws. I mean, those are -- those are matters that we\ndidn't decide in Heller. And you may have a great deal\nof divergence from State to State. And on that, I suppose,\nyou would do statistics, wouldn't you? Or the legislature\nwould.\nMR. GURA: Well, Your Honor, we do agree\nthat statistics are not important to determine whether\nor not a right --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: For the judges. For the\njudges.\nMR. GURA: That's right.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But they would be for the\nlegislatures.\nMR. GURA: A legislature should respect the\nfact that there is a constitutional right at issue, and\nthis Court in footnote 27 in Heller explained that under\nthe Carolene Products paradigm, footnote 4, rights\nenumerated in the Constitution are entitled to a greater\nmeasure of respect.\nAnd if I may reserve the remainder of my time\nfor rebuttal.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Clement.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT\nON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS NATIONAL RIFLE\nASSOCIATION, INC., ET AL.,\nIN SUPPORT OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. CLEMENT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nUnder this court's existing jurisprudence,\nthe case for incorporating the Second Amendment through\nthe Due Process Clause is remarkably straightforward.\nThe Second Amendment, like the First and the Fourth,\nprotects a fundamental preexisting right that is\nguaranteed to the people -- -\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Clement, would you\ncomment on Justice Kennedy's question about whether that\nnecessarily incorporates every jot and tittle of the\nFederal right into the Federal, keeping in mind that\nwith regard to trial by jury in criminal cases, there's\na difference. It's nonunanimous juries. Why does this\nincorporation have to be every bit as broad as the\nSecond Amendment itself?\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, Justice Stevens, I think\nin that respect the Sixth Amendment is a bit of an\noutlier. For most of the provisions and as far as I\nknow all of the substantive provisions of the Bill of\nRights that have been incorporated against the States,\nthis Court has incorporated basically all the\njurisprudence that comes with that.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, what is the last\ncase in which we incorporated a substantive provision?\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, I guess maybe it's Mapp,\nis one way of thinking about it. I mean --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mapp was a procedural\ncase.\nMR. CLEMENT: -- I could quibble about that --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mapp was a Fourth Amendment\ncase. I'm asking you cases involving incorporation of\nsubstantive rights, as opposed to procedural rights.\nMR. CLEMENT: Well --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: The procedural cases come\nin under the due process language, but the substantive\ncases comes under the word \"liberty,\" and \"liberty\"\npicks up the First Amendment and so forth. And I take\nit it's the word \"liberty\" that picks up the Second\nAmendment. And if it does, why does it have to be\nprecisely the same scope as the Second Amendment?\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, sure. We could quibble\nwhether -- I think of the Fourth Amendment as more of a\nsubstantive guarantee. But in any event, with respect\nto certainly like the First Amendment guarantees that\nthis Court has incorporated through the liberty -- the\nliberty subclause, if you will, of the Due Process\nClause, there too I think this Court -- certainly I\nunderstand this Court's jurisprudence as incorporating\nall of the cases that go along with that.\nSo New York Times v. Sullivan is the law of\nall 50 States, et cetera, et cetera. And I think that\nin a sense the virtue of that approach is probably even\nmore apparent with the Second Amendment than it might be\nwith some other jurisprudence --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I guess we -- I guess we\nhave applied substantive due process with regard to the\nnecessity of permitting homosexual conduct and with\nrespect to the necessity of permitting abortion on\ndemand. We have not adopted a more rigid rule for the\nFederal Government than we have adopted for the States\nin either of those instances, have we?\nMR. CLEMENT: That's also right, Your Honor,\nthough I guess I would stress that I think that,\nwhatever the debate's about substantive due process when\nit comes to unenumerated rights, I think the gist of\nthis Court's incorporation doctrine is that the textual\nprovisions of the Bill of Rights stand in a favored\nposition with respect to incorporation. And so Glucksberg\nhas its discussion about the standard for unenumerated\nrights, but it starts that off by saying of course the\nBill of Rights are different. And, of course, the Bill\nof Rights, I think, as I read this Court's selective --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: They stand in a favored\nposition, but we've never said had to be literally\nall the way down the line, or we couldn't have done\nthe criminal jury -- nonunanimous criminal jury case.\nMR. CLEMENT: Again, though, it's\ninteresting that the one place that I -- that I see where\nthe Court has not effectively translated all the case law\nis one of the procedural rights, the Sixth Amendment\ncriminal jury right. And I think with respect to the\nsubstantive rights -- and I think the alliance here or\nthe similarity between the First and the Second\nAmendments are very stark in this respect -- this Court\nhas incorporated essentially not just the amendment and\nnot just the right, but all of the jurisprudence as\nwell.\nAnd, you know, I would -- just to dwell for\na moment if I'd could on the -- on the First and the Second\nAmendment, I think it's striking, very striking, that if\nthis Court's not going to reconsider its Privileges or\nImmunities Clause jurisprudence, the Cruikshank case\nactually stands as very good precedent for incorporating\nthe Second Amendment, just as it was the precedent this\nCourt relied on in incorporating the assembly and petition\nrights of the First Amendment in the De Jonge case. And\nthe reason is Cruikshank -- the whole reason that\nCruikshank said the First and Second Amendments aren't\nprivileges of national citizenship is because they were\npreexisting rights that didn't depend on the\nConstitution for their existence.\nThat seems to me to be a pretty good working\ndefinition of what a fundamental right is, one that is\nso fundamental and basic that it preexisted our very\nConstitution. And so it's not surprising that De Jonge\ncited Cruikshank as favorable precedent for\nincorporation.\nI think the exact same logic would apply to\nthe Second Amendment here, and, as I say, I do think the\nconsequence of that, certainly the most logical\nconsequence, would be to carry over the jurisprudence\nunder the Second Amendment. Now, right now, that's not\ncarrying over a lot, right? That's carrying over the\nHeller case.\nBut I think in a way that points up to the\nfact that one of the virtues of incorporation is that,\nbecause the Miller decision of this Court sowed\nconfusion, we don't have substantial Second Amendment\njurisprudence. And I would think that it's going to be\ndifficult enough to develop the Second Amendment\njurisprudence that you wouldn't want to make it more\ndifficult by having to develop a Federal Second\nAmendment jurisprudence and then some sort of shadow\nversion of that jurisprudence for the States.\nAnd I think in the more recent incorporation\ncases, this Court was quite candid that it wasn't going\nto adopt sort of a shadow version of the Federal\nguarantee or some watered-down version of the Federal\nguarantee, but it really saw the virtue of incorporating\nnot just the right but the jurisprudence that came with\nthat right.\nAnd so I do think that's in a sense\nsomething that counts in favor of incorporating the\nSecond Amendment and doing so through the Due Process\nClause, the same way this Court has dealt with the other\nsubstantive guarantees of the Bill of Rights. And I\nthink if you apply that jurisprudence, the case really\nis very straightforward. In fact, I think if you\ncompare the First Amendment and the Fourth Amendment to\nthe Second Amendment, they have the same textual\nguarantee to the people, they trace their origins to\npreexisting rights back to the English Bill of Rights,\nback to even earlier constitutional history.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: That's true of the\ncriminal jury trial right, too, all of those things?\nAnd yet we don't -- it's not exactly the same. I just\ndon't see why it has to be exactly the same. I can\nunderstand your argument that it should be substantially\nthe same, but I don't see that there's anything in the\ntext of the Fourteenth Amendment that would justify\nsaying it must be precisely the same, or of any of our\ncases.\nMR. CLEMENT: Well -- and, again, Justice\nStevens, you know, since I think that -- that the\nincorporation clause is -- I mean, the incorporation\njurisprudence is, to put it lightly, a gloss on the text\nof the Due Process Clause --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Incorporation\njurisprudence is -- we haven't had an incorporation case\nfor 30 years or more.\nMR. CLEMENT: That's right. That's right,\nJustice Stevens. But I guess I would say is that,\nputting the Sixth Amendment to one side, which I think\nis a bit of an outlier in the jurisprudence here, I\nthink the trend of all of this Court's incorporation\njurisprudence has been more towards complete\nincorporation of the right and the jurisprudence. So --\nI mean, Mapp is a perfect illustration.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That still allows\nscope, once you determine that the right is\nincorporated, for recognizing that the States might have\nbroader interests that the Federal Government doesn't\nhave. But I would suppose that would come up in the\napplication of the right, rather than in an effort to\ndetermine whether parts of it are incorporated or not.\nMR. CLEMENT: That's right,\nMr. Chief Justice, and I think the same thing can be\nsaid for any other one of the other incorporated\namendments. So I think the same thing might be true in\nthe First Amendment. There are certainly going to be\nsituations that the Federal government confronts that\nthe State governments won't confront the exact analogue\nsituation and vice versa.\nNow, you know, there may be unique issues\nabout national parks that the States aren't going to\nhave to confront, and the jurisprudence can take that\ninto account. But I think that's far different from\nsaying that we really are going to have this shadow\njurisprudence for one of the provisions.\nAnd I think, again, to go back to Mapp just\nas an illustration, when this Court first incorporated\nthe Fourth Amendment and said, well, we'll talk about\nthe exclusionary rule later; maybe we won't incorporate\nthe Fourth -- the exclusionary rule. We'll just\nincorporate the Fourth Amendment's basic guarantee. And\nthe trend of later cases was to say, no, kind of in for\na penny, in for a pound --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: You're -- you're dead right --\nMR. CLEMENT: -- let's bring the\njurisprudence with --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- about the majority of\nthe Court, but it's interesting that during this whole\nperiod, Justice Harlan staked out a separate position on\nwhether it should be just the substance of the right or\nthe -- every detail. And we have followed Justice Harlan,\nrather than the majority in a number of cases in -- in\nthe recent years.\nMR. CLEMENT: Well --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: He is very much against you,\nand he's a very important member of our -- of our history.\nMR. CLEMENT: Justice Harlan was a terrific\njustice. Justice Black was a terrific justice in --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Maybe we should go back --\nMR. CLEMENT: -- in his total\nincorporation --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, Mr. Clement, why\nshouldn't we go back completely to Justice Harlan's view\nabout the way in which the Bill of Rights applies to the\nStates?\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, I think if we are going\nto go back, maybe we should go back to the first Justice\nHarlan, who actually had an -- an approach, I think,\nthat would be much more similar to the approach --\nJUSTICE BREYER: But there is a difference.\nMR. CLEMENT: -- that we take in this case\nand that Mr. Gura takes in this case.\nJUSTICE BREYER: There is a difference here\nwith the other amendments. There is a difference, and the\nother amendments -- you have the First Amendment's,\nthe First Amendment expression.\nHere we have right in the amendment written\na militia-related clause. And the way that -- the\nway -- the way that the right might be incorporated in\nrespect to that is light years different from the way\nit might be interpreted if you think what it is, is the\nright to have a gun to shoot a burglar. They're just\ntwo separate things.\nAnd as to the first, it's pretty hard for me\nto see why you'd incorporate it, for reasons I won't\ngo into. As to the second, I understand it. So we're\nstarting with a difference in purposes at the least.\nAnd shouldn't that make a difference in how you\nincorporate?\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, I mean, I guess what\nI -- what I don't understand is why, given the way that\nthis Court wrestled in the Heller decision with how to\nbasically apply the operative clause in light of the\nprefatory clause, why one would want to come to a\ndifferent conclusion --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Because the -- one of the\nreasons --\nMR. CLEMENT: -- with respect to the States.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- at least, is that --\nyou've read, I'm sure, that all the law professors\nat Harvard, Yale, Princeton, London, et cetera, that say\neven Blackstone in the 17th century thought that this is\nprimarily a right to raise an army through Parliament\nto -- well, I can't go on here. I'm just saying think\nof that brief, and you'll see the differences, even\naccepting Heller.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You can respond if\nyou want, briefly.\nMR. CLEMENT: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nI mean, obviously this Court was focused\nvery much on Blackstone's writings in the Heller\ndecision, and I think the majority read Blackstone\nactually as being primarily concerned with the\nself-defense right, which goes a long way to understand\nwhy the Heller decision came out the way that it came\nout.\nAnd I would simply finish by noting that the\none thing that I think we can come to a conclusion about\nBlackstone is the very fact that Blackstone dwelled on\nthe right is good evidence that it's a fundamental right\nthat should apply to the States.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Clement.\nMr. Feldman.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES A. FELDMAN\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. FELDMAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe Second Amendment should not be\nincorporated and applied to the States because the right\nit protects is not implicit in the concept of ordered\nliberty. States and local governments have been the\nprimary locus of firearms regulation in this country for\nthe last 220 years.\nFirearms, unlike anything else that is the\nsubject of a provision of the Bill of Rights, are\ndesigned to injure and kill. And the very same features\nthat make firearms valuable for self-defense as the\nCourt noted in Heller also --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: When is the last time an\nopinion of ours made that the test, implicit in the\nconcept of ordered liberty? It sounds very nice. But\nwhen is the last time we used it? I think it was 1937.\nMR. FELDMAN: I don't believe it was, Your\nHonor. The --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Has it been the basis of\nour decision in any case since Palko?\nMR. FELDMAN: I think the -- the Court\nhas -- the Court has used the term in a number of cases.\nSince then, it has used it in -- not in corporation cases\nas recently as the Glucksberg case. It used it in Mapp.\nIt has used it in other cases, but I think --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And it was also the Harlan\nview, although a separate opinion in the Griswold case\nand in Poe v. Ullman.\nDo you think that it best describes the\napproach that the Court has used over the years?\nMR. FELDMAN: Yes, I do.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I was going to ask\nMr. Clement what test he thought the Court used. If\nyou looked at all the cases, you think implicit in\nthe concept of ordered liberty?\nMR. FELDMAN: Yes, I do, and here's the\nreason why. In 1833, this Court has held in Barron v.\nBaltimore, in a -- in a ruling that Chief Justice\nMarshall said was not a difficult one, although\nimportant, that the Bill of Rights did not apply to the\nStates.\nAs far as I know, no justice has ever\ndisagreed with that -- with that ruling or suggested he\nwas wrong in so ruling. From -- it was -- the only\nreason -- and when the Fourteenth Amendment was passed\nand ratified in the late 1860s, again, the -- the\nframers did not directly apply the Bill of Rights to the\nStates. They gave us some generalities.\nAnd the Court has always understood that\nwhen it's applying the Due Process Clause, what it asks\nis not just is something in the Constitution, but is\nthis something that's so fundamental it's a necessary\ncondition --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Is the right to trial by\njury implicit in the concept of ordered liberty?\nMR. FELDMAN: I --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: My goodness --\nMR. FELDMAN: I think that it --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- there are a lot of\ncountries that don't give the right to trial by jury,\neven England does not give it in all criminal cases.\nMR. FELDMAN: I think it is in the following\nsense: When you're talking about a procedural right\nthat's embedded in a particular procedural system, you\nhave to look at how that system operates and how the --\nthe right works within that particular system.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I think that's\nexactly -- that's exactly right. And that is what the\nCourt elaborated on in Duncan. I do think the focus is\nour system of ordered liberty, not any abstract system\nof ordered liberty. You can say Japan is a free\ncountry, but it doesn't have the right to trial by -- by\njury.\nThe -- the concept only makes sense,\nI think, if you limit it to our system. Under our\nsystem, as you said, the -- the right to a jury is\nessential.\nMR. FELDMAN: I -- I agree -- I -- I\nthink that's right. I was just distinguishing\nbetween --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, if you think\nthat's right, why wouldn't you think, for all the\nreasons given in Heller, that the Second Amendment right\nis essential to our system, whatever it may be with\nrespect to France or England or anywhere else?\nMR. FELDMAN: The question that the Court\nwas addressing in Heller was not -- again, was not how\nimportant the Second Amendment right was, or how\nimplicit it is in our system; it was what did it say and\nwhat did the -- what restrictions did the framers of the\nSecond Amendment impose on the Federal Government.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But I thought its\nrationale was that because of its fundamental character,\nthe right to bear arms must be understood as separate\nfrom the qualifying phrase of the militia clause, all\npeople, most people in the United States. The public\nmeaning of the Second Amendment was that there was an\nindividual right to bear arms, and that's because it was\nfundamental. If it's not fundamental, then Heller is\nwrong, it seems to me.\nMR. FELDMAN: No, I -- I -- I don't think\nthat that's right. The question is what right -- what\ndid they impose upon the -- as restrictions upon the\ngovernment when the Second Amendment was ratified. And\nas to that, it's not a question of whether it's\nfundamental any more than with the Grand Jury Clause or\nwith the civil jury trial right --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I don't see how you\ncan read --\nMR. FELDMAN: -- under the Seventh Amendment.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I don't see how you can\nread Heller and not take away from it the notion that the\nSecond Amendment, whether you'd want to label it\nfundamental or not, was extremely important to the framers\nin their view of what liberty meant.\nMR. FELDMAN: I -- it was important, but\nactually what Heller says is this: The Second Amendment\npreexisted the -- its inclusion -- or the right that's\nin the Second Amendment preexisted its inclusion in the\nBill of Rights. But the reason it was codified, the\nreason it -- the reason it was put into the Bill of Rights\nwas because the framers were concerned about the Federal\nGovernment disarming the militia.\nThe right of self-defense, which had been\npreviously recognized and highly valued, I would agree,\nwas -- had -- according to Heller, quote, \"had little to\ndo with its codification\" --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That may be --\nMR. FELDMAN: -- with its inclusion in the\nConstitution.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That may be the reason it\nwas put there. But it was put there.\nMR. FELDMAN: That's --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And that's the crucial fact.\nIt is either there or it is not there.\nAnd if it's there, it doesn't seem to me to\nmake any difference why they chose to put that one there\nas opposed to other ones that they didn't put there.\nIt's either there or not.\nMR. FELDMAN: That -- I agree as far as the\nFederal Government goes. But now there's a different\nquestion being asked, and the Second Amendment in this\nrespect is unlike any of the other amendments that have\nbeen incorporated.\nThe same -- very same reason why the\nFirst -- the various rights in the First Amendment were\nput there in 1791 is exactly the reason why it was\nheld -- why it was incorporated and applied to the\nStates under the Fourteenth amendment.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So do we read the -- the\nclause at the beginning -- the militia clause -- we're\nsupposed to read the words of the Constitution, aren't we?\nI guess --\nMR. FELDMAN: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- the answer to that's yes.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes.\nMR. FELDMAN: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Thank you. Very well, and\ndoesn't that suggest what the purpose of putting the right\nthere is even under Heller or at least one purpose --\nMR. FELDMAN: Well, that -- that --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And does that not give us a\nclue as to what they thought that --\nMR. FELDMAN: That's what --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- the ordered liberty\nwas? That's your point?\nMR. FELDMAN: That's what -- and that's what\nHeller said. And here's the difference -- is, it is it\nis now urged that this right is fundamental because of\nits importance, the importance of firearms in\nself-defense. That was true also in 1791, but it\nwouldn't have been in the Constitution for that. That\nhad little to do with putting it in the Constitution.\nThis is a right that has always been subject to the\npolitical process and --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, sure, and it's\nstill going to be subject to the political process if\nthe Court determines that it's incorporated in the Due\nProcess Clause. All the arguments you make against\nincorporation, it seems to me, are arguments you should\nmake in favor of regulation under the Second Amendment.\nWe haven't said anything about what the content of the\nSecond Amendment is beyond what was said in Heller.\nMR. FELDMAN: That's -- that's --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And so the argument\nyou make is, well, given this context, you should not be\nable to have concealed carry. Well, maybe that's\nright, but that doesn't mean you don't incorporate the\nSecond Amendment to allow you to enforce that type of\nregulation.\nMR. FELDMAN: No, I don't think so. I think\n-- the argument that I'm making is that States and local\ngovernments under the political process, which as far as\nwe know, if the only issue had been self-defense, the\nframers would have been satisfied to leave this to the\nStates and to leave this to the political process, and not\nto put it in the Constitution -- that -- that -- that as\nfar as the right to self-defense goes, that's something\nthat has always been effectively regulated through the\npolitical process and especially at the State and local\nlevel. And through our history, as technology has\nchanged, State and local regulation has altered to draw\nthe balance that has to be drawn.\nJUSTICE ALITO: And your position is that a\n-- a State or local government could completely ban all\nfirearms?\nMR. FELDMAN: If the State and local\ngovernment did that, I think would it raise two\nquestions. One question would be, there is always\nreview under the Due Process Clause and under the Equal\nProtection Clause for provisions that are arbitrary.\nAnd I'd want to know why a State had done that. It's\ncertainly relevant that in the last 220 years, no\nState has done that or even come close, and, in fact, as\nthe briefs on the other side of the case from some of\nthe States show, they are quite in the opposite direction.\nBut the second point would be --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I -- I don't understand.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: What is the due process\nliberty --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What basis would there be\nto -- to deny that?\nMR. FELDMAN: Well, there's always --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Firearms kill people is\nwhat the States say, and -- and we ban it.\nMR. FELDMAN: Right, and that has --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Other countries have done\nthat.\nMR. FELDMAN: It has not led to States doing\nit in -- in this country. The second question --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But if they did do it, I\nthink you'd have to say it's perfectly okay.\nMR. FELDMAN: No, the second -- there would\nbe two questions actually. One would be was this arbitrary,\nor is that actually based on a reason that's --\na sound reason?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes. The reason is guns are\ndangerous.\nMR. FELDMAN: The second argument would be,\nthe Court at that point, if in the very unlikely event a\nthat a State or local government tried to do that, then\nthe Court might have to wrestle at that point with the\nquestion of the relationship between self-defense and\nthe right to keep and bear arms. In other words, this\nCourt has never said --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But would self-defense be\npart of liberty under the Due -- substantive meaning of\nthe Due Process Clause?\nMR. FELDMAN: I mean, if by that is, do you\nhave a substantive right to self-defense, the Court\nactually has never answered that question, but I'm\nwilling to accept that there is such a right for --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And you've given -- you\nsaid there were two reasons. So you have given us both\nin your answer to Justice Alito's question?\nMR. FELDMAN: Yes, and -- and what I'd say\nabout the right to self-defense is, if -- if the\nchallenge -- if a State or local government banned all\nfirearms it might raise the question of, given that\nthere -- if there is a constitutional right to\nself-defense, has the State prohibited you from\nreasonable means of exercising that right? But that --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Without repeating that and\njust so I understand your position, how could some\nmember of the Court write the -- this opinion to say\nthat this right is not fundamental, but that Heller was\ncorrect?\nMR. FELDMAN: I -- the Court would just say\nthat what Heller held was if you look at the meanings\nthat the words in the Second Amendment had, the common\nmeaning -- as the Court said in the Heller opinion --\nthe common meanings that the word had in 1791, it\nimposed limitation on the state. It took a preexisting\nright that had not been -- it was not codified in the\nConstitution, and it said, this self-defense right we\nneed in the Constitution in order -- in order to protect\nthe militia against being disarmed by the Federal\nGovernment.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That sounds an awful\nlot to me like the argument we heard in Heller on the\nlosing side.\nMR. FELDMAN: Well, it's actually what the\nCourt said in its opinion. What the Court said in its\nopinion is the reason it was codified was the concern\nthat the framers had with the -- that the Federal\nGovernment might disarm the militia. Not self-defense.\nSelf-defense according to the Court in Heller, quote,\n\"had little to do with the codification of the right.\"\nJUSTICE SCALIA: They said that is the\nreason it was codified. They did not say that that is\nthe function of what was codified. The function of what\nwas codified was to enforce the traditional right of the\npeople to bear arms.\nMR. FELDMAN: And that -- that --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And to say that that wasn't\nthe reason it was codified doesn't say anything about\nwhat it consists of.\nMR. FELDMAN: That -- that's correct, and\nI'm not arguing today about what it consists of, but the\npoint being that this was a right that had been -- that\nthe framers as far as we know would have been satisfied to\nleave to the political process if it was just a question\nof the feature of it. But today --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Let me see if I understand\nyour argument. I thought you said a minute ago that if\na State or local government were to ban firearms\ncompletely, this Court might hold that that violates\nsubstantive due process because the right to use a\nfirearm for self-defense is -- might be held to be\nimplicit in the concept of ordered liberty; is that\nright?\nMR. FELDMAN: That's correct.\nJUSTICE ALITO: And -- but I thought you\nbegan by saying that the right to keep and bear arms is\nnot implicit in the concept of ordered liberty.\nMR. FELDMAN: The right to keep and bear\narms that was recognized -- I don't think actually the\nright to keep and bear arms itself is. Perhaps the\nright to self-defense is, and then like other rights,\nsimilar rights, if the Court were to hold that that is\nconstitutionally protected, the question would be is the\nState now giving you sufficient means to exercise that\nright? Not whatever means you want, but sufficient means\nso that you reasonably can exercise that right. I\nwould think that would be the only way that that kind of\nanalysis could go, if you start off from self-defense.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Feldman, let me take\nyour argument at -- at its face value. Let's assume\nthat the only reason it is there and the only purpose it\nserves is the militia purpose. Isn't that militia\npurpose just as much defeated by allowing the States to\ntake away the militia's arms as it would be by allowing\nthe Federal Government to take away the militia's arms?\nMR. FELDMAN: Yes, but I -- that --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Then so --\nMR. FELDMAN: But that --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- even if you assume that\nthe whole thing turns around the militia prologue, that\nprologue is just as -- just as important with respect to\nthe State's depriving the people of arms.\nMR. FELDMAN: Yes, but I don't think the\nargument -- the primary argument that's being made today,\nthat this is implicit in the concept of ordered liberty or\nsufficiently fundamental or whichever other formulas --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You're switching horses\nnow.\nMR. FELDMAN: No, I'm not. No --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Let's just focus on your\nargument that -- that -- that deals with the prologue.\nYou say this is different because of that prologue. But\nthat prologue has just as much force if the States take\naway the militia's arms as if the Federal Government\ndoes.\nMR. FELDMAN: I -- I think that few people\ntoday would say -- and in fact few people in 1868 would\nsay that the concern to protect the State militias is\nsomething that's so fundamental or essential to a\nconcept of ordered liberty or central to our system that\nit has to be --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, suppose it is.\nMR. FELDMAN: -- protected --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- Suppose it is. Assume for\nargument's sake that it is. Still, I take from what\nyou are saying that -- let's make up an imaginary\nimportance of ordered liberty chart, and we give it to\nJames Madison and the other framers. And he would say,\ninsofar as that right to bear arms is important for\nthe purpose of maintaining the militia, it's high on\nthe ordered liberty chart. Insofar as the right to bear\narms is there to shoot burglars, it's low on the ordered\nliberty chart.\nAnd if that's what they'd say, it's\nconceivable that part of this amendment would go through\nand be incorporated; namely, that part which would\nprevent a law that would disarm people to the extent\nthey couldn't form militias. But that part which would\ndisarm people to the extent that they couldn't shoot\nburglars, that would not be incorporated.\nMR. FELDMAN: It -- that would be -- that\nwould be possible, but another -- another way to look at\nit is that the question that the Court had -- the Court\nhas never answered the question, is this implicit in the\nconcept of ordered liberty or should this be\nincorporated under any other test?\nJUSTICE ALITO: But if we took the\napproach that --\nMR. FELDMAN: By just --\nJUSTICE ALITO: If we took the approach\nthat Justice Breyer outlined, would -- why would we not do\nthe same thing with respect to all the applications of all\nof the amendments that up to this point have been regarded\nas being completely incorporated, along with all of our\ndecisions? So why would we not look at all of our\ndecisions under the First Amendment and the Fourth\nAmendment and the Fifth Amendment and the Sixth\nAmendment, and rank all of those interpretations on some\nscale of ordered liberty?\nMR. FELDMAN: I -- I don't think -- I don't\nthink the Court would. And what I was really responding\nto Justice Breyer was, we understand that the Second\nAmendment is in the Constitution and binds the Federal\nGovernment, but it has always been understood, from 1868\non, that before an amendment applies to the States, you\nneed something more than just finding that it's in the\nConstitution, and --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, to get back to\nJustice Breyer's point, which I'm not sure you answered,\nis your theory that you simply -- it's not a question of\nis it in or is it out? But you're saying, well, what is\nin and what is out, are you?\nMR. FELDMAN: No, I -- actually my -- excuse\nme. My answer to the question would be it's -- I think\nit's out, because all that shows is the framers certainly\nhad --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you think it's in\nor out, right?\nMR. FELDMAN: I think that -- I think the\nbest argument is that it's out, for this reason:\nWhen the framers --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, I -- I know your\nreasons.\nMR. FELDMAN: Okay.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm trying to get\nyou to take a position on whether or not you want us to\nnot only pick and choose among which amendments are part\nof our abstract notion of ordered liberty, or if you\nwant us also to take amendments that might be in and\nrefine them and shave them off a little bit and say,\nwell, this part of the amendment is in, and this part\nisn't.\nMR. FELDMAN: No, that's not the argument\nthat we're making.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay. So your\nargument is all in or all out.\nMR. FELDMAN: The argument that we're making --\nyes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay.\nMR. FELDMAN: The argument that we're --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Step one -- step one is\nmake my chart. Step two is look at what's high. Step\nthree is, even though that high part, even that high part,\nnobody could think was incorporated.\nMR. FELDMAN: I -- in our view, the things\nthat the framers -- the framers had their reasons for\nputting --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's how you think\nMadison went about his job?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. FELDMAN: No. No, I think that --\nJUSTICE BREYER: He did, actually.\nHe did. That's how he went about it.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm asking counsel.\nDo you think that's how Madison went about\nhis job?\nMR. FELDMAN: I think the framers had\nreasons to put everything in the Constitution that they\nput in it. But the question about whether it should be\nincorporated against the States is a different question\nthan whether they put it in the Constitution.\nAnd what you have in the Second Amendment\n-- and it's right clear on the face of it from the\nprologue; it's clear -- it's clear from the opinion in\nHeller -- is the reason they put it in the Constitution is\nnot the primary reason why people today are arguing that\nthis is a right that -- that is so fundamental that it\nhas to be applied against the States.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Feldman, our\nselective incorporation doctrine under the Due Process\nClause does suggest that there are some rights that were\nfundamental enough to be incorporated and some that are\nfundamental, but not fundamental enough to be\nincorporated. We've drawn a line.\nIs it the ordered liberty concept alone in\nour jurisprudence that you are relying upon, or is it\nany other articulation of our incorporation doctrine\nthat supports your view?\nMR. FELDMAN: I think that's the underlying\nstandard, but the Court has certainly looked at our\nhistory and our traditions in answering this question,\nand I think they are relevant in this area, as they were\n--\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The Chief says: Yes, if\nwe look at it, we have to look at it in the context of\nour history, our structure. So address his question as\nto why --\nMR. FELDMAN: I would say that --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- in our structure or\nour history, it's not fundamental enough --\nMR. FELDMAN: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- to incorporate.\nMR. FELDMAN: Yes, and I think it's -- I\nthink it's not. We have discussed already 1791, and the\nreasons why -- the reasons even that the framers thought\nthat -- well, I've already discussed that. I don't want\nto go into it again.\nThe --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Eleven of the colonies had\na guarantee at the time the Constitution was\nadopted, and I believe something like 44 States\ncurrently have in their constitutions protection of the\nright to bear arms.\nMR. FELDMAN: I -- I --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Does that suggest anything\nabout -- about how fundamental it is generally?\nMR. FELDMAN: I -- what the Court actually said\nin Heller was that there were two States at the time, in\n1791, that had a firearms right, and with -- there were\npossibly two more where the evidence was a little bit\nmore ambiguous.\nAs far as today, it is true that 44 States\nhave some kind of recognition of a right to keep and\nbear arms. Now, some of those States -- a couple of\nthem, at least, two to four -- recognize that only in\nconnection with the militia, and it's really quite\ndifferent from the right that this Court recognized in\nHeller. Many other of the rights that are recognized in\nState constitutions include provisions that really would\nbe unheard of, and that actually point to the reasons\nwhy this is not fundamental, like, say, freedom of\nspeech or freedom of religion. They have provisions\nthat say: Subject to such regulation as the legislature\nmay prescribe, or the like.\nAnd that points out the other difference.\nBecause firearms are -- the same features that make them\nuseful for self-defense make them also useful as\ninstruments of violent crime, suicide, and accidental\ndeath. Their -- regulation of these items has -- is a\npart of our tradition and --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: \"Subject to such\nregulation\" certainly excludes banning them entirely,\nwhich is what you assert can be done.\nMR. FELDMAN: No, I think that --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What's the purpose of a\nState constitutional guarantee which has at the end of\nit \"subject to such regulation as the legislature may\nproscribe,\" if that regulation includes banning it\nentirely? That --\nMR. FELDMAN: With that --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- would make a nullity\nof the constitutional requirement.\nMR. FELDMAN: The overwhelming consensus\namong the State courts in interpreting the wide variety\nof different types of provisions that they have is that\nit imposes a reasonable regulation standard that is not\nviolated by banning a particular weapon or a particular\nclass of weapons, as long as you are allowing some kind\nof firearm, and that is not the right that this Court --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And is that what you're\nasserting here --\nMR. FELDMAN: -- recognized in Heller.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- that the States have\nto allow firearms?\nMR. FELDMAN: No.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Is that --\nMR. FELDMAN: I -- I didn't think I was.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I didn't think so, either,\nso --\nMR. FELDMAN: No. What I'm --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- why does your last argument\nmake any sense?\nMR. FELDMAN: No, what I'm saying -- I'm\nsorry. What I'm saying is that the right that is\nembodied in the wide variety of different State\nconstitutions -- the overwhelming consensus is that what\nthe States have determined as a result of their own\nprocesses and in light of their own conditions is that\nyou can't ban all kinds of firearms, but you can ban\nsome kinds of firearms.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's fine.\nMR. FELDMAN: And that is -- and the kinds\nof firearms that have traditionally been banned --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: We said as much in Heller.\nMR. FELDMAN: Right. Well -- and the\nkinds of firearms that have traditionally been banned by\nthe States and that actually the period around the time\nof the Fourteenth Amendment is a good period to look.\nAt or around that time, there are numerous States that\nhad regulations barring the carrying and even that go up\nto the point of possession of pistols and Bowie knives,\nwhich are not firearms, but are also arms under the\nSecond Amendment, and so on.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, all those\nmay be perfectly valid today, or -- if the Court\nincorporates the Second Amendment. Incorporation\ndoesn't say anything by itself about whether those types\nof regulations, which you think are reasonable and your\nfriends think may not be reasonable, are valid or not.\nMR. FELDMAN: I think the Court in Heller\ndid hold that a ban on -- a ban on handguns is invalid.\nThat was the holding of the case. And these are --\nthese were laws that were passed that are very close to\nthat. In the 1860s and the 1870s, in Texas, in\nWyoming, places that -- not necessarily for the whole\nState --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Handguns in the home?\nMR. FELDMAN: They --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Handguns in the home?\nThat's what Heller addressed.\nMR. FELDMAN: They banned -- I -- well,\nnot -- I can't say that they banned handguns in the home\nper --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No, you can't, because they\ndidn't.\nMR. FELDMAN: But if you look at the\ndecision -- no, if you look at -- actually, if you\nlook at the decisions, some of them banned the sale;\nthey banned carrying them anywhere in the jurisdiction,\nand in such a way that -- and some of the judicial\ndecisions even say: This was intended to eliminate\nthese weapons from our jurisdiction. And they were\ngenerally upheld at that time.\nNow, those were responding to local\nconditions at the time, and generally, the history of\nfirearms regulation, because of the risk that firearms\npose, has been that in this country, it has been widely\nrecognized that in many places it's appropriate to carry\nfirearms. And many jurisdictions have found, and\nreasonably found, that allowing broad use, carriage, and\nwhatever of firearms is appropriate, but there are some\njurisdictions that have found that's not to be the case,\nthroughout our history.\nAnd that has been a State and local decision\nthat has worked through the political process in those\njurisdictions. And that political process here is\nanother distinction between the Second Amendment and\nsome of the other amendments that have been\nincorporated -- is that one basis, I think, for\nincorporating the other amendments and for applying them\nagainst the States has been that there is a concern\nabout a discrete minority or a highly unpopular view\nthat's not going to get a fair shake in the political\nprocess. I don't think that has ever been the case\nhere. And as far as I know, the framers didn't think\nthat was the case with respect to the right to keep and\nbear arms.\nIt's a right that gets controlled in\naccordance with local conditions, with local cultures,\nand with local views about the necessarily difficult\nquestions about how best to protect public safety. That\nis -- that has been a part of our -- of our history\nsince 1860, since --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But there -- but there are\nprovisions of the Constitution, of the Bill of Rights,\nthat have been incorporated against the States, where\nthe States have substantial latitude and ample authority\nto impose reasonable regulations, rights respecting --\nrights respecting property, the Cruel and Unusual\nPunishment Clause. We look to see what the political\nprocess does. We look to see -- why can't we do the\nsame thing with firearms?\nMR. FELDMAN: Well, it's just that the end\n-- I have really two points I'd like to make about that.\nOne is the analysis the Court used in Heller. In\nHeller, what the Court said is: This is not the time to\nbalance things; you cannot ban handguns.\nNow, there may be local -- there have been\nlocal jurisdictions before and there are now ones where\nthey feel allowing some firearms, but banning handguns,\nis the best way to achieve public safety and to increase\nthe zone of ordered liberty for their people. And those\nthings would be apparently impermissible under Heller.\nBut even more than that, Heller construed\nthe Second Amendment's \"bear\" -- the word \"bear,\" \"to\nkeep and bear arms\" -- to mean the same thing as \"carry\"\nin this Court's case in Muscarello, much later. And to\ncarry -- generally to carry.\nMany -- there's a long history of\nregulation of not just concealed carry, as the Court did\nrecognize in Heller, but of banning open carry\nin a variety of jurisdictions. Again, generally, it's\nsomeplace that is -- it has a particular problem; it's a\ncity or something like that.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Do you think there is\nexisting authority with reference to other provisions of\nthe Bill of Rights that would allow us to incorporate\njust the core of Heller with respect to the States?\nJust the core of the Second Amendment with respect to\nthe States, along the lines to this question Justice\nStevens was asking earlier?\nMR. FELDMAN: Well, I think that there would\nbe --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And if so, what's -- what\ncase do we look to for that proposition?\nMR. FELDMAN: I think really this -- I\ncannot offhand think of a case that would lead you to\nthat -- would lead to that.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: If you look to Justice\nHarlan's dissent in Griswold, where he says the\nFourteenth Amendment stands on its own bottom and it can\nbe either more or less than the provisions of the Bill of\nRights, and there's no reason in the world why this\nCourt could not adopt the same position here and say:\nInsofar it's incorporated, it applies only within the\nhome. The Court had ample precedent for that.\nMR. FELDMAN: And actually the other point I\nmake is if you approach it from the other point of view,\nthe case has not been made here -- it hasn't even been\nbrought -- that the City of Chicago is denying people\nthe -- the right to have any kind of firearm or the\nright to have any kind of reasonable means of\nself-defense.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry. Is it\nthe position of the City of Chicago that we should rely\non Justice Harlan's dissent in Griswold?\nMR. FELDMAN: No.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, then your\nanswer to Justice Stevens is no, you're not going to\nfollow that approach, right?\nMR. FELDMAN: No, what I would say is that\n-- what I would say is that if the Court -- what I was\nsaying is that if the Court approaches it from the\nstandpoint of perhaps if there is -- if the Court\nchooses in an appropriate case to recognize a\nfundamental right to self-defense, it would then raise\nthose kinds of questions. And someone could make the\ncase that they are being denied any right to\nself-defense or any reasonable right to exercise\nself-defense because of a jurisdiction's firearms\nregulations; the Court could address that. That's not a\nclaim that has been made in this case; that's not a\nclaim that could be made in this case because --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: See, the right to keep and\nbear arms is right there. It's right there in the Bill\nof Rights. Where do you find the right to self-defense?\nMR. FELDMAN: Well, I --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You -- you want us to\nimpose that one on the States but not -- not the\nexplicit guarantee of the right to keep and bear arms.\nThat seems very strange.\nMR. FELDMAN: No, actually I -- I don't want\nto impose that on the States. I think it's very\nunlikely that the Court would ever be called upon to,\nbecause our history for the last 200 years -- 220 years\nhad been of reasonable State and local regulation of\nfirearms that responds to local conditions, to local\nthreats of violence, and so on that occur. And I don't\nsee any reason to think that there will be a\njurisdiction that would try to sufficiently ban firearms\nthat people wouldn't have a reasonable means of\nself-defense.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The District of Columbia\ndid. That's what Heller said.\nMR. FELDMAN: Well, the District of Columbia\nin any event is controlled by Second Amendment as it --\nas it's written. That's not the question in this case.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Would you be happy if we\nincorporated it and said reasonable regulation is part\nof the incorporation? And how do we do that?\nMR. FELDMAN: Well, there is the reasonable\nregulation standard. There's an article by Professor\nWinkler that we cite in our brief, that goes very\nextensively through the ways that State courts have\ndealt with their own rights to keep and bear arms and\nhave adopted, really by overwhelming consensus, that\nkind of a reasonable regulation standard, which\ngenerally recognizes --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought that Heller --\nHeller allowed for reasonable regulation.\nMR. FELDMAN: Excuse me.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought that the Heller\ndecision allowed for reasonable regulation, and it gave a\nfew examples, as Justice Scalia mentioned.\nMR. FELDMAN: Right. Well, it's just our\nview would be that what Chicago has done here, which is\npermit you to have a -- permit you to have long guns but\nban handguns, is the kind of regulation that throughout\nour history jurisdictions in their own -- that are most\nfamiliar with their own particular needs, their own\nparticular problems, and in a position to balance the --\nthe need for self-defense with the risks to the use of\nfirearms -- for violence, for accidental death, and for\nsuicide -- that the City of Chicago has come up with\nsomething that is well within our tradition. And --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What you're urging is\nreally a mixed blessing for gun control advocates. To\nthe extent we sever the Federal guarantee from what the\nStates are obliged to comport with, we encourage a\nstricter Federal Second Amendment, one that forbids all\nsorts of regulations that the Federal Government might\notherwise be allowed to do, because it doesn't matter --\nthe States can take care of it.\nI mean, you know, if -- if you sever the\ntwo, you're encouraging a broader prohibition at the\nFederal level, and that's what -- Heller was very\ncareful not to impose such a broad prohibition\nprecisely because it realized that -- that this is a\nnational problem.\nMR. FELDMAN: I -- I think that, if I may --\nthat the restriction that the Second Amendment imposes\non the Federal Government should be and is controlled by\nwhat the meaning of that Second Amendment was in 1791.\nIt shouldn't vary one way or the other with whether\nthere's incorporation against the States.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Gura, you have 3 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ALAN GURA\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. GURA: Sure.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Counsel, at the -- at the\nvery outset of your argument, Justice Sotomayor asked the\nquestion which, as I understood it, essentially said what\nare examples of privileges and immunities that are being\ndenied by the States that -- which denial would be\nremedied by following your proposal to overrule the\nSlaughter-House case?\nAnd let's leave the Second Amendment out.\nLet's assume the Second Amendment is a wash; it's either\ngoing to be incorporated or not going to be incorporated\nthe same -- to the same extent under either the Privileges\nor Immunities Clause or the Due Process Clause. Leaving\nthe Due Process -- the Second Amendment out of it, what\nprivileges and immunities are now being denied citizens\nof -- of the United States?\nMR. GURA: Well, apart from the Second\nAmendment right, which is being denied to people in the\nUnited States by Chicago at least, there are other\nrights -- other rights enumerated in the first eight\namendments that were thought to be the personal guarantees\nas well as certain unenumerated rights which were\nunderstood to be part of --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: What are examples of\nthose? The jury trial in civil cases?\nMR. GURA: The jury trial --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And grand jury. What\nelse?\nMR. GURA: There's not much left, Your\nHonor. Those are the only two provisions of the Bill of\nRights that have not been held incorporated under due\nprocess, which informs us that perhaps we should have\nthe Second Amendment incorporated. There's no reason\nto treat it any differently. With respect to the\nunenumerated rights that perhaps are not being --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So you are saying that\nunder -- under your view, every State would have to use a\ngrand jury to bring criminal charges; no more information.\nAnd that every State would have to have a civil jury, if\nany party in the case requested it. Is that --\nMR. GURA: Yes -- well, it's not just what\nwe're saying; it's what the framers of the Constitution\nsaid. And as Justice Scalia noted in Apprendi, the right\nto a jury trial, for example, may not be efficient, but\nit is free.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: That's a criminal case;\nthat's quite different.\nMR. GURA: That's right. We're talking\nabout the Grand Jury Clause; we have 28 States right now\nout of the 50 that allow prosecutors to pursue felony\ncharges without indictment by a grand jury, but the\nother 22 States do require it.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I'm -- we're using\nup your time. But --\nMR. GURA: Sure.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- do you want me to leave\nthe bench thinking grand jury indictment and civil trial\nand jury case -- that's it. There's no other -- what are\nthese other unenumerated rights?\nMR. GURA: We can't give a full description\nof all unenumerated rights that are going to be\nprotected by the Fourteenth Amendment. Either --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It doesn't trouble you.\nMR. GURA: No, it does not, and it shouldn't\ntrouble the Court because the Court addresses due\nprocess cases all the time without saying we're --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, does it include the\nright to contract?\nMR. GURA: The right to contract --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Isn't that an unenumerated\nright?\nMR. GURA: That is literally understood by\nthe framers to be an unenumerated right under the\nprivileged immunities. We know that because in the\nCivil Rights Act of 1866, that's the very first right\nthat they mentioned as something that people in the South\nshould be enjoying, because they were not allowed to\npursue a livelihood.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Your approach --\nyour original approach would give judges a lot more\npower and flexibility in determining what rights they\nthink are a good idea than they have now with the\nconstraints of the Due Process Clause.\nMR. GURA: No, Your Honor; our approach\nmight actually provide judges with perhaps no more than\nwhat they have now, perhaps even less, because our\napproach is rooted in text and history. It's not a\nlicense for judges to make up unenumerated rights that\nthey believe --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Privileges and\nimmunities give you a lot more flexibility than due\nprocess, because it's not limited to procedural --\nwhere you don't have to deal with the hurdle that it's\nlimited to procedural by the text.\nMR. GURA: Sure. If I may?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes, you may.\nMR. GURA: Thanks. We believe that it's\nmore limited because that -- that text had a specific\nunderstanding and that there are guideposts left behind\nin texts and history that tell us how to apply it, unlike\nthe due process. But at least we know one thing, which\nis that, in 1868, the right to keep and bear arms was\nunderstood to be a privilege or immunity of citizenship,\nand if the Court is considering watering down the Second\nAmendment, perhaps it should look to text and history.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMR.
