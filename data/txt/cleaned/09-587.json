COLOMBO\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. COLOMBO: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe California Supreme Court's denial of\nRespondent's ineffective counsel claim was entitled to\nthe deferential review for reasonableness prescribed by\n28 U.S.C. section 2254(d). By its plain terms, nothing\nin 2254(d) requires a State court to render a reasoned\nor explained decision, nor is there anything in section\n2254(d) that would treat Strickland claims differently\nfrom any other Federal constitutional claim.\nHere, the Ninth Circuit failed to give the\nState court decision the proper deference -- indeed,\ndouble deference -- it was owed. Rather than applying\nthis Court's proper -- excuse me -- clearly established\nStrickland standard, the court of appeals employed its\nown eccentric rule that essentially requires counsel to\nalways consult with and present expert testimony in\nevery case in which the prosecution -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: How do -- how do we know\nthat the -- the California court even reached that\nquestion? Because there was -- wasn't there a motion to\ndeny review as -- as -- wasn't there a time bar question\nraised?\nMR. COLOMBO: There was a procedural bar\nthat was argued in the informal opposition to the\npetition for writ of habeas corpus that had been\nrequested by the California Supreme Court. It did not\ninvoke that bar as a basis for denying relief. Under\nwell-established -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Of course, it said -- it\njust said denied on -- on the merits. And it's still\nnot clear to me how to -- pardon me. It just said\n\"denied\"?\nMR. COLOMBO: Yes.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: It's still not clear to me\nhow to distinguish that, between denied, deny -- do we\nsay, when there's a one-line order, as in this case,\nwhere it says simply \"deny,\" it is presumptively on the\nmerits? I mean, how -- how do we interpret that?\nMR. COLOMBO: Yes. In fact, that is a\nwell-settled and long-established practice, local\npractice. It's well-understood by not only the\nlitigants, but the State and Federal courts of the Ninth\nCircuit, dating back to the Ninth Circuit's 1974\ndecision in Harris v. Superior Court.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Then it is presumptively\non the merits?\nMR. COLOMBO: Yes.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: They don't -- I mean, is\nthat the way it's stated? Don't let me use my\nformulation. What's -- what's the State's formulation?\nMR. COLOMBO: The State's formulation is\nthat the silent or so-called summary denial is on the\nmerits, unless the State court indicates otherwise in -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Now, that can't be a Ninth\nCircuit rule. I mean, that has to depend upon each -\neach of the States in the Ninth Circuit, no?\nI mean, some State could -- could have a\ndifferent rule, I assume. You're -- you're telling us,\nhowever, that California has that rule?\nMR. COLOMBO: Yes. And that rule, again,\nhas been well-established -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But did -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But if I'm on the\nCalifornia court and I have two choices -- one is to say\ndenied, no explanation, as this case; the other is to\nsay denied on the merits -- if I have those two options,\nthen why are they both on the merits?\nMR. COLOMBO: Again, because it has\ncertainly been well-understood for at least three and a\nhalf decades that when the California Supreme Court\nrenders a so-called silent denial, that it is on the\nmerits unless the court ordered -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And what is the leading\nCalifornia authority on that proposition?\nMR. COLOMBO: That would be In re Robbins,\nin which -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: That's the Robbins case.\nOkay.\nMR. COLOMBO: -- which is discussed in our\nbrief, as well as in the reply brief.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: All right. Thank you.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, I don't know\nthat you answered Justice Kennedy's question.\nMR. COLOMBO: I'm sorry.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I don't know you\nanswered his question.\nHis question was: If you can deny or deny\non the merits, what's the difference between the two?\nMR. COLOMBO: There really is no\nsubstantive -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: There's two choices, so\nthey have to have different meanings in some way.\nMR. COLOMBO: I would submit that there is\nno substantive distinction between an order that simply\nreflects denied versus one that reflects denied on the\nmerits.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: They showed us the\ndocket for that day -\nMR. COLOMBO: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- of the denial here,\nand there were different ones. If it's the same court\ntaking action, why would they choose one over the other\nfor particular cases?\nMR. COLOMBO: Well, I submit that there\ncould be any number of reasons, and not the least of\nwhich this Court addressed itself in Carey v. Saffold,\njust a couple of terms ago.\nAs the Court recognized, that sometimes the\nState court may choose to include the phrase \"on the\nmerits\" to give a reviewing court an alternative basis\nfor understanding why relief was denied, or to let, for\nexample, a pro se petitioner, who are typically the ones\nthat present petitions for writs of habeas corpus in the\nCalifornia Supreme Court, know that their case wasn't\ndenied because of some mere procedural technicality, but\nbecause the claim itself was substantively meritless.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, that's what -\nthat's feeding into your adversary's argument, that when\nthe court does a summary denial, you don't know whether\nit's procedural or merits.\nThat's his argument. You're adopting his\nargument?\nMR. COLOMBO: No. No. Our argument is that\nit's a long-settled, established question of local\npractice that when the California Supreme Court renders\na -- a silent denial, simply says \"petition for writ of\nhabeas corpus denied,\" it is understood by the court's\nlitigants, has been well-established for over three and\na half decades: That is a merits decision.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, what would the\nCalifornia Supreme Court do if they all agree that this\napplication should be denied, but two of them think it's\nfor a procedural bar -- timeliness -- and then others\nthink it has no merit, and they say just \"denied,\" but\nthere's no majority for either one?\nMR. COLOMBO: In -- in that instance, then\nthe claim would be presumed -- assuming that the court's\norder simply reflected \"petition denied,\" again, it's\nwell understood that that would be a denial on the\nmerits.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Even though, in fact, it\nwasn't?\nMR. COLOMBO: Well, we can't know that. In\nfact, it would be purely speculative to suggest that\nthat's what the courts have done.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So we -- so there is that\npossibility -- even though there is that possibility, we\nshould assume it was on the merits.\nWhat about -- I mean, you said this is three\ndecades, but we are told that the California Supreme\nCourt has this pattern of saying merits when it's on the\nmerits; giving a citation, if it's a procedural bar to\nthe -- a procedural fault; and when it says simply\n\"denied,\" that's most likely that they couldn't all\nagree on a reason.\nMR. COLOMBO: Well, I would respectfully\ndisagree with that suggestion, that because it simply\nsays \"denied\" without including the phrase \"on the\nmerits,\" it's not a merits determination.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But that's what they\nwould say if, in fact, they were divided, right?\nMR. COLOMBO: I'm sorry. What?\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: If, in fact, the court\nwas divided, all agree that the petition should be\ndenied, but there's no majority for any particular\nreason, merits or procedure, they -- they would say\n\"petition denied,\" right?\nMR. COLOMBO: Yes, if it's -- if it's a\nstraight silent denial, and the -- the court doesn't\ninvoke either a procedural bar to deny relief or forgo\nthe procedural bar and find that the claims are\nsubstantively meritless in any event.\nWhat I submit that the silent denial simply\nmeans is the court didn't agree that there was a basis\nfor invoking a procedural bar; the claims were\nmeritless, and it simply orders the petition denied,\nwhich is, again, well-understood. It's a\nwell-established practice in the -- in the State and\nFederal courts in California that those silent denials\nare merits determinations, which are entitled, then, to\nAEDPA deference under the statute.\nEven the Ninth Circuit, in the en banc\ndecision in this case, recognized that the California\nSupreme Court's silent denial was a merits determination\nwhich it then had to review.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Do -- does the court\nsometimes deny explicitly on procedural grounds?\nMR. COLOMBO: Yes. And when the court does\nthat, it will reflect such in its orders. That's\ndiscussed in footnote 34 in the Robbins case, which we\ndiscuss in our brief in this Court.\nThe court says when it's going to invoke as\na basis for denying relief on a Federal claim, it will\nindicate that in its order. If it's relying on a\nseparate State procedural default, for example, if it's\na successive petition of the claimant's previously\nraised on direct appeal or -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So you're saying that if\nit's on both grounds, if they agree with both the\nprocedural and the merits ground, they may well just -\njust deny without any explanation? But if they deny\nonly on the procedural ground, they will -- they will\nsay it?\nMR. COLOMBO: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: All right.\nJUSTICE ALITO: If you looked back at a\nsample of the cases in which they have simply said\n\"denied,\" would we find cases in which no procedural bar\nwas raised by the State?\nMR. COLOMBO: I don't know the answer to\nthat question, because I haven't researched to find out\nwhether or not in any of those cases, like in this case,\nthe California Supreme Court directed the Attorney\nGeneral to file an informal opposition or some other\npleading that would have addressed that question.\nWithout knowing whether or not there was briefing on\nthis -- those particular cases, and there's no\nsuggestion in Respondent's brief that that was done, I\ncouldn't -- I couldn't guess on that.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Was there a procedural\nissue in this case before the California Supreme Court?\nMR. COLOMBO: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What was that?\nMR. COLOMBO: A timeliness bar, among\nothers.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What was the basis of\nthat?\nMR. COLOMBO: That the claim of ineffective\nassistance could and should have been discovered at an\nearlier time than when it was presented to the\nCalifornia Supreme Court under California's timeliness\nrule, which would require that counsel present the claim\nof, in this case, ineffective assistance upon learning\nof the factual basis to support such a claim.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So it took 14 months for\nthis petition to be filed to the State court. Do you\nhave cases that show whether those 14 months are\npresumptively unreasonable under California law?\nMR. COLOMBO: Yes. And that's basically the\nClark case that's also discussed in our brief.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So there is great\nvalidity, you think, to your timeliness -- so this\ntimeliness claim. And despite that, you believe the\nsilent denial was an adjudication on the merits.\nMR. COLOMBO: Yes, because I would submit\nthat when the State argued that the claim was\nprocedurally barred by reason of untimeliness and the\nState court did not invoke that as a bar to relief, it\nnecessarily concluded that the claims were\nunmeritorious, because they otherwise could have been\nbarred by a procedural bar, but they -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I thought you just told me\nthat if they -- if they agreed both with the procedural\nground and the merits ground, they could issue just -\njust a denial without explanation.\nMR. COLOMBO: That's -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Now you're telling me\nthat -- the opposite.\nMR. COLOMBO: If I said that, then I\nmisspoke or perhaps I misunderstood the Court's\nquestion.\nWhat I'm suggesting is if the court invokes\nas a basis for denying a Federal claim a State\nprocedural bar, it will reflect that in its order.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That will always be in the\norder.\nMR. COLOMBO: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But if, in this case, they\ndid reject it on a procedural ground, and it was a\nreasonable ground that they applied consistently, then\nthe Ninth Circuit or the Federal courts couldn't\nconsider the claim at all; is that right?\nMR. COLOMBO: That's correct, assuming that\nthe Federal courts agreed that the State bar wasn't -\nJUSTICE BREYER: If, in fact, the -- they\nare right, if in fact that the State was correct that\nthis is procedurally barred -- they should have raised\nit earlier; they didn't -- and if that was correct and\nreasonable and proper under both Federal and State law,\nthen you shouldn't be in this subject at all; is that\nright or not?\nMR. COLOMBO: Yes. That's correct. Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So, normally, to decide a\nmatter on a substantive -- to have a presumption that\nthey were deciding it substantively rather than\nprocedurally will help a defendant, though not in this\ncase.\nMR. COLOMBO: That's correct.\nJUSTICE ALITO: But you didn't raise -- you\nhaven't argued that it's procedurally barred.\nMR. COLOMBO: Not in the Federal court, no.\nJUSTICE ALITO: So you may have waived that.\nOn the other hand, your opponent has, as I gather, until\nthey got here, never argued that it was based on\nanything other than the merits. So they might have\nwaived that.\nMR. COLOMBO: Yes. I would submit that -\nJUSTICE ALITO: So everything might be\nwaived here.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. COLOMBO: Well, I'm not sure that -- we\nnever invoked a procedural bar in the Federal court\ninsofar as the presentation of these particular claims.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: One thing that's not\nwaived is the second question, or the first, which is\nthe merits of the Strickland claim.\nMR. COLOMBO: Yes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And maybe this would\nbe a good point for you to switch to that.\nMR. COLOMBO: I would -- I would be pleased\nto discuss that with the Court.\nWe have argued in our brief, and I think\nit's crystal clear: First of all, the Ninth Circuit's\ngrossly overbroad explication of a so-called Strickland\nstandard that would require counsel in every case in\nwhich the prosecution presents forensic -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Did they say that?\nMR. COLOMBO: I'm sorry.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Did they explicitly say\nin every single case you have to consult an expert?\nMR. COLOMBO: No. They didn't say that.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Or did they say, in the\ncircumstances of this case, given the nature of the\nissues, that consultation would have been effective?\nMR. COLOMBO: That is -- that certainly is\none reading of the Ninth Circuit's opinion. I submit\nthat the more correct reading, so to speak, would be if\nthe Court looks at the language that the Ninth Circuit\nuses in -- in discussing this standard, they essentially\nsay, since counsel should have reasonably expected the\nprosecution was going to present this forensic evidence,\nhe should have not only investigated it, he should have\nconsulted with experts. He should have presented them.\nAnd I think -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: We could take issue with\n-- with the timing of that consultation, but let's\nassume that it turns out afterwards that if he had\nconsulted an expert, that that expert would have told\nhim that one of those blood spots absolutely had to be\nKlein's near the bedroom. You would have no quarrel\nwith saying it would have been ineffective for that\ncounsel to have failed to confer with an expert,\nwouldn't you?\nMR. COLOMBO: No, I would disagree with that\nfor the reasons -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You would say, even if\nthe expert were to give that kind -- an expert would\nhave given that kind of exculpatory information, that\nthat would not have been ineffective?\nMR. COLOMBO: Let me start by saying this:\nFirst of all, we can't know and no one can ever know\nthat Klein's, or Johnson's blood, for that matter, was\nin this blood pool that the Ninth Circuit -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm not talking -\nMR. COLOMBO: -- focused its attention on.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I gave you a\nhypothetical different from the facts of this case. I\ntake the Ninth Circuit to be saying, if you're in an\narea, and you are a lawyer, where you have no expertise\nand your case depends on a technical issue, it behooves\nyou to at least talk to an expert to find out if you are\non the right track. And if you fail to and you get\nsomething that's completely exculpatory, you're\nineffective.\nSo I posed the hypothetical: If an expert\nwould have looked at all of these test results and said,\nthat has to be Klein's blood there, it can't be\nJohnson's for this reason, you are positing that even\nunder that circumstance there would not have been\nineffectiveness for the failure to consult with an\nexpert? Is that what you are telling us?\nMR. COLOMBO: Yes. And the reason why I say\nthat is because it's important to remember that the\ncritical forensic evidence in this case, that the jury\nwas -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You keep wanting to\nreturn to this case, and I respect why you want to, but\nI am positing a hypothetical that underlies, I think,\nthe Ninth Circuit's point.\nMR. COLOMBO: In response -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It may well be in this\ncase that the consultation would have resulted in no\nprejudice. That's different from whether it was\neffective to ignore a consultation. Those are two\ndifferent questions.\nMR. COLOMBO: I suppose, accepting the\nCourt's hypothetical as stated, that counsel was aware\nof and failed to consult with an expert knowing that\nthat testimony would be presented, could be deemed\ndeficient performance under -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why -- do you think it\nmakes a difference whether the expert would have -\nwould have helped or not? I mean, counsel has to make\nthat decision of whether to call an expert ex ante, not\nex post. I mean, you -- we shouldn't evaluate his\ndecision on the basis of whether, even if it's a\n1,000-to-1 long shot, it turns out that that testimony\nwould have been very successful.\nDon't we have to examine it ex ante before\nhe knows what the result will be?\nMR. COLOMBO: Yes, and I think it's\nimportant to look at -- as this Court has described in\nthe Strickland case itself, we have to view from\ncounsel's perspective at that time. What did he know?\nWhat could he have reasonably expected the prosecution's\nevidence to be? How is he going to meet that evidence?\nWhat tactical or strategic choices -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, Justice Sotomayor's\nhypothetical would include the situation where he\ndoesn't know that the prosecution is going to introduce\nany expert testimony. He knows that there is blood\nthere. He should -- he should get his own expert,\nwhether or not the prosecution uses one. Right?\nI mean, can it never be ineffective\nassistance not to call an expert where -- so long as the\nprosecution doesn't have one on the other side?\nMR. COLOMBO: No, I would submit that it\ncertainly could be deficient performance if counsel\nfails to investigate readily available evidence that\ncould lead to exculpatory evidence in support of his\nclient's defense. That's the hypothetical, I believe,\nthat Her Honor asked a moment ago.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, could? Really? Is\nthat your test? It could -- there's some remote\npossibility?\nMR. COLOMBO: Again, I think it would be -\nit's going to be fact-specific depending upon the kind\nof case. It may well be in a given case that forensic\ntestimony would not be controverted, would not be\ndisputed. It wouldn't be relevant, necessarily, to the\ndefense.\nLet's say, for example, that there was no\ndispute that the person who committed the offense left\nDNA evidence at the crime scene, and it's clear that the\nDNA evidence suggests that the perpetrator was the\ndefendant. Then the court -- then the defense attorney\nisn't going to profit by consulting an expert to dispute\nan indisputable issue.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But isn't it the reality\nthat sometimes the defense doesn't want to have an\nexpert, because the expert may turn up findings that are\nadverse for him, and it's better for the defense counsel\nto just leave things murky and argue to the jury that\nthe State didn't produce the evidence, either? That's a\nperfectly legitimate strategy, isn't it?\nMR. COLOMBO: It is. And I think that in\nmany instances that would -- that would inform a defense\nattorney's strategic choices as to how to present the\ndefense in a given case.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Colombo -\nJUSTICE ALITO: Unless the -- sorry.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Colombo, you -- you\nsay in any event, leaving aside the question of whether\nthere was ineffective assistance of counsel, even\nassuming there was, there would -- there would be no\nprejudice in this case.\nMR. COLOMBO: That's correct. Yes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And could you just\nsummarize why you say there would be no prejudice?\nMR. COLOMBO: Well, first of all, I think\nit's important to recognize that the expert declarations\nthat were proffered by Respondent in support of his\nhabeas petition really don't challenge the testimony\nthat was presented in the State trial by the State's\nexperts, specifically the question of whether or not the\nmurder victim could have been moved from, supposedly,\nthe area outside the bedroom door onto the couch.\nThe testimony at trial suggested that that\ndistance was somewhere between about 20 and 25 feet.\nThere was no evidence at the crime scene that suggested\nthe victim had moved from the point where he was shot\nwith a fatal gunshot wound.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What about the -- the\npool of blood? There was one expert affidavit that said\nsomething about -- that Johnson, standing up, could not\nhave produced that amount of blood.\nMR. COLOMBO: I think the actual expert\ndeclaration suggested that the prosecution's theory, as\nthe expert described it, could be eliminated, because\nJohnson could not have bled into the blood pool\nsufficient to have formed it by merely standing and\nwaiting for the police to arrive.\nI think it's important to realize the\ndistinction between the prosecutor's theory which he\npropounded in his closing argument versus the evidence\nthat the jury actually heard at trial from the State's\nown blood-spatter expert that suggested in order for -\nfor Klein to have been moved from the point where the\nblood pool had formed onto the couch where his body was\ndiscovered by the police, there would have been some\ntrail or some indicia, some evidence that would have\nsuggested that he had to have been moved from that\npoint.\nAnd the more important question, I suppose,\nwould be, as the dissenting opinion pointed out in this\ncase: Why would the victim have been moved if he had\nbeen shot at that location? Why would he have been\nmoved onto the couch?\nIt certainly makes no sense for another\nvictim, who's already shot, who's intoxicated, who's\nwounded and moving around in the house -- why would he\nhave wanted to have moved the victim of the gunshot\nwound to the head from point A to point B? It just\ndoesn't make any sense. And there has never been\nanything in any of Respondent's experts' declarations\nthat suggests a rational explanation for how or why that\ncould have happened. Without -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: On the -- on the no\nprejudice issue, are you relying just on what\nhappened -- what was found at the scene of the crime? I\nmean, you said it's implausible that Klein would have\nbeen moved with no trail of blood at all. So, you say,\ntherefore no prejudice.\nAny -- anything else that goes into your no\nprejudice argument?\nMR. COLOMBO: Yes. I think for all of the\nreasons that are discussed in the dissenting opinion at\npages 193a to 194a of the petition for writ of\ncertiorari -- excuse me -- of the appendix.\nAs the dissenting opinion points out, it\ncertainly was -- there's no evidence in the various\nexperts' declarations that suggests, first of all, why\nthe jury would have believed Respondent's trial\ntestimony that after having essentially partied with the\ntwo victims for several hours the night before, they\nsuddenly leave, go back to their place of employment,\ncome back two hours later to return property and a\nfirearm to another occupant of the house that they had\nno reason to believe was actually there; then they are\nsuddenly surprised by these two victims; that there is a\nspontaneous gunfight that ensues involving a firearm\nthat's never found, that's never attributed to either of\nthe two victims in the house, that could have only been\nattributable to the Respondent himself.\nSo the jury had all of that evidence to\nconsider, and we balance that against these -- as I,\nagain, described them -- inconclusive and speculative\nexpert opinions that are proffered in support of\nRespondent's habeas petition. The jury could not have\nbeen persuaded to find the defendant not guilty, even\nhad that evidence been introduced.\nSo, necessarily, Petitioner could -\nRespondent could not have been prejudiced by the failure\nto introduce that evidence, assuming that that evidence\nwas, in fact, available and could have been presented in\nthis case at the time of Respondent's trial.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Was there additional\nphysical evidence found not at the scene?\nMR. COLOMBO: Yes. In fact, the -- the\nother thing that really tied the Respondent into this\ncrime was that there was an expended casing at the crime\nscene that matched perfectly with a loaded firearm\nmagazine with the exact same kind of bullets and a box\nfull of the same exact bullets in the Respondent's house\nwhen the officer served a search warrant, along with the\nstolen gun safe and some evidence that there was\nmarijuana there, which the victim -- the surviving\nvictim was -- admitted to be a marijuana dealer.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Could I ask you a question\nabout California procedure?\nIs what happened here unusual? Is there -\ndoesn't -- does the prosecution have an obligation to\nprovide notice before trial of its intention to call\nexpert witnesses?\nMR. COLOMBO: Yes. Under California\ndiscovery rules, the prosecution would have to disclose\nto the defense any evidence it intends to introduce,\neither by way of lay testimony or expert testimony,\nbefore the trial commences.\nJUSTICE ALITO: And if the defendant\nrequests that, does -- what's the defendant's reciprocal\nobligation, if any?\nMR. COLOMBO: The defendant would have to\ndisclose any witnesses that he or she intends to\nintroduce at trial, including expert testimony and any\nreports supporting such experts.\nUnless the Court has any further questions,\nI'd like to reserve my remaining time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Colombo.\nMR. COLOMBO: Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Gardner.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF CLIFFORD GARDNER\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. GARDNER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe Court has invited briefing in the\nadditional question presented on the application of\nAEDPA in this case, and in light of the Court's many\nquestions this morning, I want to address that. But I\ndid want to clear up one piece of information that seems\nto be confusing in the record, and if I can start with\nthat.\nThis was in response, I think, to a question\nyou asked, Justice Ginsburg, regarding the -- the\nprejudice prong of the Strickland claim. And the\nquestion was: Why is it -- why is it not -- why is it\nharmless? And counsel suggested that there was an\nabsence of blood between the blood pool and the couch.\nDetective Bell testified to that.\nAnd I just want to clear up, because I know\nthis -- this bit was confusing in the briefs, too: That\nis not what Detective Bell testified to. If you look at\npages 181 and 195 in the reporter's transcript in\nExhibit R5, you will see that Detective Bell says, yes,\nthere were drops leading away from the couch; yes, there\nwere drops leading away from the blood pool.\nAnd in fact, Exhibit R5 is a picture of the\ncouch, and you can indeed see -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought that the point\nwas that there was no trail from the bed. I mean, the\ntheory was that Klein was removed from the bed to the\ncouch.\nAnd I thought that the point that the -\nthat counsel for the State emphasized was, did the -- if\nsomeone were moved from the bed, taken to the living\nroom couch, you would have expected to see a trail of\nblood from the bed. And there wasn't that.\nMR. GARDNER: Indeed. But the State's\ntheory -- the defense theory was that the body had been\nmoved from the blood pool -- not the bed -- the blood\npool to the couch. And the State's response, in its\nbriefing and today at oral argument, was that there was\nno blood trail between the blood pool and the couch.\nAnd, indeed, that's not what Detective Bell testified\nto. He said there were drops outside the blood pool,\ndrops outside the couch, and when asked if there was\nblood in the carpeting in between, he said he did not\nremember how much blood there was in between.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So -- so the idea is\nthat Johnson drags Klein. This is your theory, right?\nBecause you are not suggesting he could have lifted\nKlein and walked him over, are you?\nMR. GARDNER: Yes, I think he could have\nlifted him, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Really? Did you\nhave an expert testify to that?\nMR. GARDNER: No.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Did you get expert\ntestimony about that or an expert report about that?\nMR. GARDNER: No. There was no -- there was\nno expert testimony about the ability of someone to -\nto lift a weight.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But you think you\ncan assume that he could lift the weight. How much did\nKlein weigh?\nMR. GARDNER: I think he weighed between 150\nand 160 pounds.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And Johnson?\nMR. GARDNER: I think about the same, Your\nHonor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay. And you say\nthat he could have dragged him from the pool to the\ncouch because there were drops along the way.\nMR. GARDNER: I'm saying that -- that the\ntestimony and -- and the suggestion that there was no\ntrail of blood between the blood pool and the couch is\nnot consistent with what Detective Bell testified to.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. -\nJUSTICE ALITO: And what is your theory\nabout why he -- why Johnson would have a motive to go\nthrough this exertion? He's -- he's wounded. And let's\nsay there really was a gun -- a gun fight, and Klein\nfell someplace else. Johnson wants to make it seem like\nKlein was -- that there wasn't any gun fight.\nWhy -- why is it so valuable to him to move\nKlein's body from the location where you think he fell\nto the couch?\nMR. GARDNER: Well, if he's -- if he falls\nin the bedroom doorway, Your Honor, and he falls in a\ncrossfire, then Johnson is in some ways culpable. Now,\nwe don't know what the extent of his culpability is, but\nif he's involved in firing the first shot, he is\nculpable.\nPutting Klein on the couch and having as\nState's theory that Klein is shot in cold blood on the\ncouch eliminates his culpability, or at least eliminates\nthe risk of it.\nJUSTICE ALITO: But he could have -- if he's\ngoing to make up a story, he could have made up the\nstory that Klein jumped up and he was shot without\nhaving engaged in any firing himself, and he fell\nwherever he fell. Putting him on the couch doesn't seem\nto -- unless I'm missing something and I wish you'd\nexplain it -- doesn't seem to aid this purportedly false\nstory very much.\nAnd if you weigh whatever benefit there is\nfrom that against the exertion of moving this guy, it\ndoesn't seem to make a whole lot of sense. But\nmaybe there's something there that's not apparent.\nMR. GARDNER: Well, I can only say that if\nKlein is caught in a crossfire, then Johnson is\nculpable. And let's remember, he has drugs in the\nhouse. He has scales. He has all sorts of drug -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why wouldn't he wipe up the\nblood? I mean, what -- what good is it to simply put\nhim on the couch when you leave a pool of blood showing\nthat that's where he was shot?\nMR. GARDNER: Yes, I don't doubt that in\nretrospect he could have come up with a better plan,\nYour Honor.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. GARDNER: But I do think it's important\nto realize that this plan, at least on its face and\ninitially, in terms of his adrenaline response, is going\nto get him out of a crossfire scenario.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What other -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, there's a lot\nof talk about the importance of this pool of blood, but\nas I read Detective Bell's testimony, he never posited\n-- or talks about how that pool was formed. Only your\nexpert does that.\nWhat Bell does talk about, however, is that\nthere's a high-velocity blood splatter in front of the\ncouch and that the pooling of blood on Klein's face\nshows that he was shot there.\nYour experts do nothing to refute that\ntestimony, which was really the basis of -- of Bell's\ntestimony. He had nothing to say about the pool of\nblood. He talked about why Klein was shot where he was\nshot. And there's no expert testimony to refute that.\nSo how do you get past there being a\nreasonable probability of a different verdict when there\nis nothing to refute the critical testimony at issue,\nthat Klein was shot where he was shot because there's\nhigh-velocity blood splatter in front of him and because\nthe pooling on his face shows that?\nMR. GARDNER: Let's take both the\nhigh-velocity blood spatter and the pooling, Your Honor,\nbut let me start with the predicate. And you are right,\nDetective Bell did not testify at all about the\nformation of the blood pool, and that's why this case\nisn't about anticipating a State's expert about the\nblood pool, but about getting your own for your own\ncase.\nBut turning to the specifics of your\nquestion, the high-velocity blood spatter. It actually\nwasn't in front of the couch, Your Honor. It was to the\nside and below the arm. And let's remember Detective\nBell's testimony about how the homicide occurred,\nbecause the State's theory was not that Pat Klein was\nshot while he was lying on the couch, but that he was\nsitting on the couch.\nAnd so what's -- what's most interesting\nabout the high-velocity blood spatter, since he's shot\nin the head, is that there is none on the wall\nimmediately behind the couch. This was a matter of some\nconfusion in the briefs as well, but I think it's been\ncleared up. There's no high-velocity blood spatter\nbehind, on the pristine white wall.\nSo the question is: If he's shot while\nsitting up, the high-velocity blood spatter that Bell\ntestifies to travels, oh, about 4 feet over the couch,\nand then two drops sink down. Now, in terms of the jury\nevaluating that testimony, it's important to note that\nDetective Bell gave a description of what high-velocity\nblood spatter is, and he said it's a fan-like pattern of\natomized blood. And when you look at these two drops,\nthese two drops alone that travel 4 feet and then drop\nstraight down to fall on a plastic bag, you see, as\ndefense counsel pointed out in his closing argument,\nthat they are the same size as blood drops found in the\nkitchen on Exhibits R18 to R22.\nAnd Detective Bell's entire theory for why\nthese were high-velocity was their size. There was\nnever any dispute that there was no shooting in the\nkitchen.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, what other\nexpert evidence should Richter's counsel have pursued\nbefore deciding upon his course of action in this case?\nPut aside the blood-spatter expert. What\nother experts did he need to consult?\nMR. GARDNER: Putting aside the\nblood-spatter issue -- and these were raised in the\nlower court but not addressed -- there were -- he\npromised the jury ballistics testimony as well, which he\ndidn't produce.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay. We have got a\nblood-spatter expert, a ballistics expert. Go on.\nI thought, in their habeas proceeding, you\nsaid he should have consulted a serologist and a\npathologist. Okay, that's four. Why wouldn't he have\nwanted to talk to an expert on the effects of alcohol\nand drugs on people's different perceptions of the\nevents?\nMR. GARDNER: Well, I think the chief reason\nis, is that that wasn't part of his theory. If you\nlook -- and really, the guide to this, Your Honor, is\ndefense counsel's own theory, because defense counsel\nstands up in opening statement and he promises the jury\na theory. And the theory isn't you're going to hear two\nstories, and you have to assess credibility.\nHis theory, as he explained to the jury, was\nthe physical evidence will show you Pat Klein was not\nshot on the couch.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, he had not received\nnotice from the State that they were going to call any\nexperts, so why wasn't it reasonable for him to assume\nthey're not going to call any experts, they're not going\nto be able to pull experts out of their pocket in the\nmidst of the trial, and the judge isn't going to allow\nthem to do that without providing a -- without granting\na recess? What seems to have happened here seems pretty\nunusual.\nMR. GARDNER: Well, if this case were about\nanticipating the State's decision to call an expert, I\nwould agree, but it's not. And the reason it's not is\nbecause we have an insight into what defense counsel's\ntheory of the case was before the State ever started its\ncase, Your Honor. I mean -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I thought the Ninth\nCircuit said that part of the ineffective assistance was\nfailing to consult an expert in planning his defense and\nin preparing his defense, not simply responding to the\nState's expert in the middle of trial.\nMR. GARDNER: I agree, Your Honor, and if I\nsaid something that sounded like I didn't, then I\nmisspoke. My point is that that's exactly the theory.\nOnce defense counsel decides on his defense -- in this\ncase, I think he picked the right defense. He told the\njury the physical evidence would prove Pat Klein wasn't\non the couch, and he could have done that.\nBut despite promising the jury that the\nphysical evidence would prove this, he never consulted\nwith someone. And once -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could you explain the\nblood pooling in the face for me? You talked about the\nhigh-velocity, but -\nMR. GARDNER: Yes, I did. I didn't get back\nto that. Thank you, Your Honor.\nThe testimony was, of course, about the\nblood pattern flow on the face. And when you read\nDetective Bell's testimony carefully, that testimony has\nnothing to do with where Pat Klein is shot. It has to\ndo with the angle of his face after he's shot. So if\nhe's shot on the bedroom -- in the bedroom doorway and\nfalls and that's the angle, the blood flow would be the\nsame. So it really -- the blood flow pattern really has\nlittle to do with where he was shot, but just the angle\nof his face.\nAnd getting back to the blood spatter\nitself, the blood pool itself, what's interesting in\nthis case now is that, even after all these years, the\nState has never disputed the fact that the absence of\nsatellite drops means the State's theory is false.\nGunner Johnson could not have deposited that\nblood, because there's no satellite drops, which means\nit had to come from another source. The only other\nsource is Pat Klein.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Did I understand you\n-- I just want to step back to the prior answer.\nYou think what counsel did here would have\nbeen effective assistance but for exactly what he said\nin the opening statement?\nMR. GARDNER: If -- I'm sorry. If the\nquestion is, but for the opening statement, would we\nstill have this argument, yes, although it would be much\nmore difficult to establish what his theory was. The\nopening statement doesn't change the Strickland\nanalysis. It simply gives us an insight, an easier path\ninto knowing what counsel's theory was, much like -\nmuch like the case of Wiggins v. Smith, where the Court\nlooked at defense counsel's opening statement in the\npenalty phase repeatedly to see what was his theory and\nwhat didn't he do. And when there was a suggestion made\nin Wiggins v. Smith that, in fact, counsel's theory was\nsomething else, the Court said no, look at his opening\nstatement. We know what his theory was.\nSo it doesn't change the standard, but it\ngives us a very keen insight into exactly what he was\nthinking and when he was thinking it.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Gardner, what about\nthe argument that all this is beside the point because\nthe argument for prejudice is so weak, given all the\nother evidence that Mr. Colombo referred to?\nMR. GARDNER: Well, it will come as no\nsurprise to know that I disagree with that argument,\nYour Honor, and -- and for a couple of reasons.\nThe -- the cases really came down to Gunner\nJohnson v. Petitioner Richter. Who was the jury going\nto believe? Even on the record that counsel has\ndescribed, the jury deliberated 14 hours. And remember,\nthat record included a surviving eyewitness, and if you\nbelieve the surviving eyewitness, the case is over.\nThe jury deliberated over 14 hours, asking\nfor reinstruction twice and a rereading of testimony\nthree times. And I think there's good reason for that\npause.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, of course, Johnson\nhad given so many inconsistent statements at the outset\nthat he was a weak prosecution witness.\nMR. GARDNER: I -- I -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: It seems to me the defense\ncould have pinned a great deal of hope on that.\nMR. GARDNER: Well, I think -- actually, I\nagree with the predicate of the question, Your Honor,\nand that is Johnson had given a number of stories. He'd\ngiven four or five different stories. And after all, he\nknew both Branscombe and Richter. When he first spoke\nto the 9-1-1 people, they said: What happened? He\nsaid: Five people came in and shot me. Then he said\nfour, then he said three. And when they said, Who, he\nsaid: I don't know. So clearly Gunner Johnson was a\ncompromised witness, Your Honor.\nBut the fact that the State has a\ncompromised witness is not the reason not to research\nthe physical evidence and enhance your client's\ncredibility. It's more of a reason to do it.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What do you do with the\nammunition back at Richter's home, that the -- the gun\nsafe is found there and the unlikely story about them\ngoing -- having the zeal to clean up their workplace and\nthen coming back?\nMR. GARDNER: Well, let me take them one at\na time, Your Honor. And in a sense, the ammo and the\ngun safe, the answer is -- is very similar. All parties\nagreed in this case that several weeks before the\nincident, Gunner Johnson had stored all his belongings\nat my client's house. And, so, the only dispute was had\nthe -- the gun safe included. And this is one of the\nunusual features, is that the State's theory requires us\nto believe that this happened so he could rob a gun safe\nthat had been at his house for weeks.\nThe question was had -- had the material,\nthe gun safe and the ammo -- who's was it and had it\nbeen taken back to Gunner's house? The ammo is found in\na place with two other things. It's found with a scale\nused for measuring drugs, and it's found with shotgun\nammunition.\nNow, the record shows that Gunner Johnson\nhad a shotgun, and Gunner Johnson was a drug dealer. So\nthe defense theory, of course, is that this ammo wasn't\nmy client's. It was Gunner Johnson's and hadn't been\nmoved back. Similarly, as to the safe, there was\nconflicting testimony as to whether the safe had ever\nbeen moved back.\nSo, that really is the explanation. And\nthat, I think, is why the jury had such pause about this\ncase when it heard the case.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You mean the case\nagainst Gunner you've just described, would it have been\nenough, and wouldn't that have justified counsel's\ndecision to focus on credibility rather than expert\nphysical evidence?\nMR. GARDNER: I think not. And -- and -\nand we know this again for two reasons. And let me\nstart by saying the fact is that when counsel was asked,\nthat wasn't the reason he gave. It's not as if he -- he\ncame to the depo and he said this was my tactical\nreason, and so we can say, okay, that's a reasonable\ntactical decision. That wasn't the decision -- reason\nhe gave.\nWhen asked did you decide not to present or\nwhy didn't you present this blood-spatter testimony, he\nsaid I simply didn't know it was out there. And after\nall, let's keep in mind this was only his second\ntrial -- his second murder trial. He didn't know what\nwas out there. So, he didn't make that tactical\ndecision. And that's the first reason.\nThe second reason, I think, is that -- and\nalmost every case that has ever addressed this -- and I\nhave cited most of them -- has come to the same\nconclusion. When there is a credibility determination,\nwhen a defense -- any defense lawyer worth his salt\nknows that there's a credibility determination to be\nmade, the jury is going to believe either this story or\nmy client's story, it at least behooves you to\ninvestigate to see if the physical evidence can support\nyour position. You can always make -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Did -- did counsel\nhave to investigate the other aspects? I mean, we're\ntalking -- we're focusing on the scene where the\nshooting took place. Did he have to consider experts\nwith respect to the bypass, where they threw the guns,\nRichter's apartment, the vehicle that was used? One\nthing counsel said is he thought about hiring a tire\nexpert because of the vehicle. He has to look at the\npossibility of expert testimony affecting every aspect\nof the various scenes that were pertinent in this claim?\nMR. GARDNER: I don't believe so. And -- and\nthe reason, again, comes back to the same focus this\nCourt had in Wiggins, another failure-to-investigate\ncase. What we know is that counsel suggested to the -\ntold the jury in opening statement, this is about the\nphysical evidence. The physical evidence will show\nthis.\nWhen counsel -- when it's clear that that's\ncounsel's position in a case, it's simply application of\nthe Strickland test. It's unreasonable for counsel not\nto at least have investigated the physical evidence that\nhe told the jury would show that Klein wasn't on the\ncouch.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What does -- what\nhappens -- I know you have an answer that that's not\nthis case, but what -- what happens if the defendant\ntells his lawyer, look, I did it, I'm guilty? And the\nlawyer decides that the best thing to do is try to pin\nit on a guy whose nickname is Gunner?\n(Laughter.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Does -- does -- what\nelse is the lawyer supposed to do? He thinks no matter\nwhat -- what physical evidence is found, it's got to cut\nagainst his client because his client did it.\nMR. GARDNER: Well, in a situation where -\nwhere counsel's investigation will not be exposed to the\nprosecutor, and -- and there was questions before about\nhow California procedure works. And, indeed, once you\ndecide to name -- to call a witness, you name him and he\nbecomes, you know, exposed through cross-examination and\nfor investigation. But at least in terms of your\nprivate investigation of a case, the ABA standards are\nfairly clear that even an admission of guilt doesn't\naffect your ability or your obligation to investigate.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But if -- if the expert\nsays that the pool of blood all belonged to -- I guess\nit's Johnson, I certainly think ethically that you could\nnot argue otherwise to the jury?\nMR. GARDNER: I think ethically you couldn't\nargue otherwise to the jury.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: All right. So, that's a\nreason why defense counsel in this case and, the Chief\nJustice puts, in many cases prefers not to have experts,\njust so they can punch holes in the State's case.\nThat's a -- that's a legitimate strategy. And this\ncounsel was very -- an adept cross-examiner. There's no\ndoubt about that.\nMR. GARDNER: I -- I don't disagree, except\nthat again we come back to the -- the notion from\nWiggins, which is you can't defend a tactical judgment\nthat wasn't made. And, in fact, when counsel was asked,\nis this the reason you did this, he said no. I didn't\ncall a blood-spatter expert because I didn't know it was\nout there. I -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Can I come back to your\nresponse to the Chief Justice's question about counsel\nwho knows that his client is guilty, and you say the ABA\nstandards say that even when that's the case, you have\nan obligation to get an expert witness to confirm that\nthe client is -\nMR. GARDNER: I'm sorry. I thought -- I\nthought the hypothetical was counsel's client has said\nhe was guilty, not that counsel knew he was guilty.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Right.\nMR. GARDNER: The ABA standards say that the\nduty to investigate, the broad duty to investigate on\ndefense counsel exists irrespective of the client's\nstatements to his lawyer.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: We've never adopted the ABA\nstandards, have we?\nMR. GARDNER: In that regard, no, you\nhaven't.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That standard seems to me\nquite silly.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. GARDNER: I -- I -- you know, I can\nunderstand that, Your Honor, but from practical\nexperience, I will tell you the fact that a client\nadmits to something doesn't mean he did it or she did\nit. That's the real world consequence we face as\ndefense lawyers. Often our clients tell us things, and\nyou can't always believe them, whether they say they're\ninnocent or whether they say they're guilty.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I'm sure they often\nsay they're innocent when they're guilty, but I'm -\nI'm -- I'm astounded that they often say they're guilty\nwhen they're innocent.\nMR. GARDNER: Well, you know, I would\nsuggest the false confession literature that has come\nout, and there's plenty of it to show that, in fact,\nthat's not an infrequent occurrence.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: To -- to the police,\nperhaps, yes, but to his own counsel? I -- I'm -- I'm\nnot aware of any literature to that effect.\nMR. GARDNER: In which case I'll come back\nto the answer the Chief Justice suggested moments ago,\nthat that's not my case. It seems like a safe haven at\nthis point.\n(Laughter.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, your\ncase -- your case does involve the AEDPA issue. Perhaps\nyou want to turn -\nMR. GARDNER: It does, and so -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- to that now.\nMR. GARDNER: I was trying to use that as a\nsegue into that, Your Honor. Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It worked.\nMR. GARDNER: It worked. That rarely\nhappens, Your Honor.\nAnd let me turn then to the AEDPA issues in\nthis case, because on March 28, 2001, this California\nSupreme Court denied the petition for writ of habeas\ncorpus in my client's case with an order that said the\npetition for writ of habeas corpus is denied. That same\nday in five other cases, noncapital cases, the\nCalifornia Supreme Court denied the writ saying the\npetition for writ of habeas corpus is denied on the\nmerits. And the State's position here today and in the\nbriefing is that the Federal court should simply ignore\nthat difference. And I don't believe that's the case\nfor several reasons.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What is your answer to\nthe -- to -- to the representation that In re Robbins\nsettled that when the California Supreme Court says just\ndenied, it's on the merits?\nMR. GARDNER: Well, actually I agree and I\ndisagree. In re Robbins does settle the matter from a\nState law perspective, but not as the Attorney General\nhas suggested. In re Robbins says a few things.\nFirst, it says that when we deny a case on\nthe merits, we add the phrase \"on the merits.\"\nThen it says that when we find a procedural\ndefault, we cite to that default so that everyone knows.\nAnd then it says -- and this was in response\nto a question I think you asked, Justice Scalia -- they\nsay a third thing. They say sometimes we'll find both,\nthat it's meritless and it's defaulted, and we will say\nboth. We will cite a default, and we will say it's\ndenied on the merits as well, trusting that the Federal\ncourts will give deference to -\nJUSTICE BREYER: But what they cite it for,\nactually, is they make a slightly different argument in\ntheir brief. They say going back to 1974, there are at\nleast three cases in the Ninth Circuit that have said\nwhen the California Supreme Court says nothing, just\ndenied, we take that as a decision to reach the Federal\nissue and deny it on the merits.\nNow, not in your case, but in most cases\nthat will benefit a defendant, because it will avoid the\nquestion of whether there's an adequate and independent\nState ground of a procedural nature. So, what they're\nsaying is that that's the Ninth Circuit's statement in\nthree cases, and the California Supreme Court over a\ncourse of 30 years has never said to the contrary, which\nit had plenty of opportunity to do, and in other\ninstances where the Ninth Circuit was wrong, it did do\nit.\nSo, that, I think, is a fairly strong\nargument. Now, you're going to -- the only reason that\nyou're not out of court on your own interpretation is\nbecause you'll say that the State waived the procedural\nissue. And then they'll come back and say so did you.\nSo, what -- what is your response to all\nthat?\nMR. GARDNER: Well, I -- there's a whole\nbunch there, so let me see if I can -- if I can tease it\nout. It is true that the Ninth Circuit has had this\nprocess, this procedure for a long time, and, of course,\nit developed in a pre-AEDPA world, when the fact whether\nsomething was on the merits or not didn't really matter.\nThe only question was, Was it defaulted? And if it was\ndefaulted, it might bar Federal review. Whether it was\non the merits was really irrelevant because, before\n2254(d), that really didn't matter.\nSo that's where -- and I agree with the\nState -- that's where those cases come from. I don't\nbelieve, however, that the waiver argument is really\nimplicated here, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, look, for example, in\nHunter v. Aispuro -- they quote it as saying the\nfollowing: The California Supreme Court's denial of a\nState habeas petition, quote, \"without comment or\ncitation constitutes, a decision on the merits of the\nFederal claims.\" End quote. And then they have three\nother cases roughly to the same effect.\nNow, what you're saying is that this Court\nshould hold to the contrary, and by the way, in doing\nthat, we will bar many Federal habeas petitioners from\nthe Federal courts, because what it will mean is that\nthere is an adequate and independent State ground in\ncase after case, which perhaps is an irrelevant feature.\nBut, nonetheless, the silence of the California Supreme\nCourt is significant, I think, when faced with those\npretty clear interpretations of what their silence means\nby the Ninth Circuit.\nMR. GARDNER: Yes. And actually if the\nNinth Circuit were the only voice in the fray, Your\nHonor, I think the argument would be stronger, but the\nNinth Circuit's voice isn't the only voice in the fray,\nand that brings me to Ylst. In Ylst, of course, the\nNinth -- and Ylst v. Nunnemaker is a case which is part\nand parcel of this history from the Ninth Circuit of\nsaying silent denial is on the merits.\nIn Ylst v. Nunnemaker that's exactly what\nthe Ninth Circuit said. And it came to this Court, and\nthe State actually argued that it wasn't on the merits.\nAnd, indeed, this Court held that you cannot tell from a\nsilent denial whether it's on the merits or not. That's\nthe first response, Your Honor, is that there are\nadditional voices other than the Ninth Circuit. The\nsecond is that well after Hunter v. Aispuro comes the\nRobbins footnote and in the Robbins footnote -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm having a very hard\ntime with your reliance on that footnote because the\nvery last paragraph of that footnote says when\nRespondent's asserts -- and I'm shortening the\nintroductory line -- a State procedural bar and when\nnevertheless our order disposing of a habeas corpus\nposition does not impose the proposed bar or bars as to\nthat claim, that signifies that we have considered\nRespondent's assertion and have determined that the\nclaim or subclaim is not barred on the procedural\nground.\nMR. GARDNER: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So the footnote itself\nsays unless we invoke the procedural bar, we're not\napplying it.\nMR. GARDNER: I think that's right, Your\nHonor, but that's not the only thing the footnote says.\nThe footnote says when we deny on the merits, we say on\nthe merits; when we cite a procedural bar, we mean a\nbar; and if the State has raised a bar, as they did\nhere, and we don't rely on it, that means we haven't\nrelied on the procedural bar.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Right.\nMR. GARDNER: When you put those together,\nwhat it means is there was no majority for a decision on\nthe merits, otherwise they would have said on the\nmerits. There was no majority for a decision on\nprocedural default, otherwise they would have said\ndefault. And that's what a silent denial means, and\nthat's exactly what this Court said in Ylst. You cannot\ntell because there are seven judges, there are different\nclaims, there are different possibilities. That's why a\nsilent denial is there in State court. It's\nprecisely -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. There -\nthere's no majority for either ground, and yet you find\nin favor of the State? How can that be?\nMR. GARDNER: Well, I -- you say either\nground. There are -- there are multiple grounds for\nprocedural default, Your Honor, under State law. There\nare many possible procedural defaults.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but you're -- you're\npositing that the only time they do not say either\nprocedurally barred or on the merits is when they don't\nhave a majority for either one?\nMR. GARDNER: That's correct.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: How can they render a\ndecision in favor of the State, then, if there's no\nmajority for either disposition?\nMR. GARDNER: The question is, Why\ndeliberate to a majority when they sit around the\nconference, the seven judges -- let's say two judges\nbelieve there's a procedural default of untimeliness.\nTwo judges think it's timely but think it should have\nbeen raised below. Two judges think it's both timely\nand it didn't need to be raised below, but it hasn't\nbeen pled with sufficient specificity, and one judge\nthinks it's improper on the merits. There's seven\njudges; they all believe it should be denied, but\nthere's no majority for any position.\nThere's no reason for the California Supreme\nCourt -- and this is addressed more in the amicus brief\nby the California Academy of Appellate Lawyers. There's\nno reason for the California Supreme Court at that point\nto spend a day, two days debating it when all seven\njudges agree there's a reason to deny the petition.\nJUSTICE ALITO: But under your example,\nisn't there a majority for the proposition that there's\na procedural default, but disagreement as to the\nparticular procedural default?\nMR. GARDNER: That could be. And -- and\nwhat the California -- I'm sorry.\nJUSTICE ALITO: If it's just a binary choice\nbetween procedural default and merits, isn't there -\nand everybody agrees it should be denied, then there's\ngoing to be a majority for one or the other, right?\nMR. GARDNER: That is true, and I have been\nunclear and I apologize for that. It is not a binary\nchoice between default and merits; it's a choice between\nwhich default and merits. And there are many defaults\nunder State law. When the court denies on timeliness\ngrounds, it will cite Clark. When the Court finds that\nit has been pled with insufficient specificity, it will\ncite Swain -\nJUSTICE ALITO: Is there more than one\npossible procedural problem here?\nMR. GARDNER: Yes.\nJUSTICE ALITO: I thought it was just\ntimeliness.\nMR. GARDNER: Well, timeliness was the only\none raised by the State, but -- but to be sure, like\nthis Court, the California Supreme Court has never been\nbound in terms of its procedural default findings by\nwhat has been raised and -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What others could apply\nin this case?\nMR. GARDNER: Well, at the risk of not\nwanting to argue against my client, I could give you\nsome -- some that could apply that haven't been\nsuggested and, therefore, most certainly are waived.\nBut the California law often requires that you file your\nhabeas petition in a lower court first. Reviewing\ncourts often deny petitions for failure to file in a\nlower court first.\nThere is a requirement that says you must\nplead with sufficient specificity. That's often relied\non by reviewing courts. There is a requirement that\nsays you must attach all readily available documents.\nThat's another -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: With this confusion, your\nversion, your colleague's version, when the district\ncourt -- the district court denied relief, did you ask\nthe district court, please certify this question of what\na silent denial means, certify it to the California\nSupreme Court so we will have once and for all an answer\nof what a silent denial means?\nMR. GARDNER: The answer is no, I didn't\nrequest certification. When we were in district court\nand when we were in the Ninth Circuit, both sides\naccepted the existing framework the Ninth Circuit had\nestablished applies to a silent denial, but only under\n-- only through the lens of independent review. The\nCourt's added question has put both of those at issue.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMR. GARDNER: Thank you, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Colombo, you\nhave 4 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF HARRY J. COLOMBO\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. COLOMBO: Thank you.\nI think it's important to remember this is\nan AEDPA case. It has always been an AEDPA case. We've\nnever asserted this case was not an AEDPA case. The\nCourt has had a very spirited discussion this morning\nessentially conducting a de novo Strickland review of\nthe claims that are presented in the district court in\nthis case.\nIt's important to remember that we have to\nview, as this Court described in Woodford v. Visciotti,\na Strickland claim through the lens of the applicant's\nburden to demonstrate that the State court's resolution\nof the Strickland claim on the facts of his case was\nobjectively unreasonable.\nWhether this Court were to choose to find\nthat the California Supreme Court's determination, if it\nwere reviewed de novo, was improper is different from\ndetermining whether or not the State court could have\nreasonably concluded, on the factual record presented to\nit, that the applicant's claim failed to -- to show a\nbasis for relief. That -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Is it fair to say that this\n-- in this case, that every party in the lower courts\nassumed this was going to be a merits-related issue and\nthat some deference was due, and that nobody ever said\nanything about it being a procedural issue where there\nwould be a procedural bar of some kind that was either\nwaived or not waived?\nMR. COLOMBO: That's correct. The -\nJUSTICE BREYER: The first time anybody\nmentioned this procedural issue was when?\nMR. COLOMBO: When Respondent's counsel\nfiled his brief in opposition in this Court.\nJUSTICE BREYER: That was on the merits\nbrief in opposition?\nMR. COLOMBO: That's correct.\nJUSTICE BREYER: There was nothing before\nthat?\nMR. COLOMBO: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It wasn't part of the\ncert -- the question -- we added the question.\nMR. COLOMBO: Well, I would submit that if\nthere was a dispute about the applicability of AEDPA\ndeference to the California Supreme Court's summary\ndenial in this case, it should have been raised much\nearlier than when we got to this Court.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No, no. I'm saying they\ndidn't raise it to start with; we added the question.\nMR. COLOMBO: Yes, that's true.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So it wasn't as if they\nwere trying to get around their own waiver?\nMR. COLOMBO: No, I wouldn't suggest that\nRespondent's counsel was avoiding that. I'm suggesting\nthat if this was a legitimately disputed question, it\ncould have been addressed much earlier.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. You've lost me.\nI thought you said -- I thought you said that they\nraised it in the brief in opposition to the petition for\ncert?\nMR. COLOMBO: No, it was not raised in the\nopposition to cert. It was not raised -- it was not\npresented until the merits brief -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Until the merits brief in\nopposition?\nMR. COLOMBO: Yes. I wanted, if I may, just\ntouch a couple of points real quickly. On page 23 in\nfootnote -- I believe it's 6 of our reply brief, there's\na discussion about what the detective's testimony was in\nregard to this blood spatter near the couch where the -\nwhere the murder victim's body was found. I think it's\nimportant to remember Respondent's counsel talked about\nwhether or not this spatter would have been consistent\nwith having been shot on the couch if there were blood\nspatter behind the armrest.\nWhat the detective testified to and what's\ndescribed in our brief is the detective said because\nthis was not a through-and-through exit wound -- that\nis, the bullet lodged in the victim's head -- that the\nspatter would have been what he described as back\nspatter, meaning the blood would have flown out from the\nvictim's head outward, and that was consistent with what\nthe evidence was at the crime scene that the detective\nobserved when he was there after the murder was\ncommitted.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What about the drops\nbetween the blood pool and the couch?\nMR. COLOMBO: The detective described those\nas essentially insignificant, that they didn't reflect\nanything other than that someone was moving around in\nthe house, which was consistent with what the crime\nscene investigators had discovered when they first\nresponded to the 9-1-1 call from the -- Mr. Johnson to\nthe police.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Is there any reason not to\ndo this? I'm just thinking from our point of view -- I\nmean, I think it's probably correct what you say:\nNobody mentioned a word about this procedural issue\nuntil the brief in opposition on the merits, not the\ncert brief. And the reason they did was perfectly\nlegitimate: We'd asked the question.\nWell, if we were wrong to do that, could -\nand if we took the opinion as being a question of\nreasonable deference, et cetera, and went into it, is\nthere anything -- any reason not to put in that opinion\nsomewhere, given Ylst and given the Ninth Circuit, it\nwould be helpful if the California Supreme Court, for\nfuture reference, explained what their practice does in\nfact mean, whether it's procedural or whether it's on\nthe merits?\nMR. COLOMBO: I would submit that that would\nbe helpful but unnecessary.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel,\ncounsel.\n"
