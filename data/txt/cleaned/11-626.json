FISHER\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. FISHER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nTo be a vessel, a structure must be\npractically capable of maritime transportation, and this\ncase turns on how to assess such practical capability.\nAnd that's a question this Court answered\nover a century ago in Cope and Perry, explaining that\npractical capability depends not on any physical\nattribute the structure might have, but rather, on \"its\npurpose,\" that is, whether its function is to move\npeople or things across water.\nAnd that test has been applied numerous\ntimes before and since, across decades, providing\nstability and overall coherence to general maritime law.\nAnd of course --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You should have phrased the\ntest that way then, because it really --\nMR. FISHER: Pardon me?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That doesn't seem to me a\nvery felicitous description of what -- of what the test\nis -- is enunciated to be.\nMR. FISHER: Well, I think --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The test is whether it's,\nwhat, practically able?\nMR. FISHER: Practically capable.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Practically capable. Well,\nyou could be practically capable of doing something,\neven though the purpose of -- of setting the thing up\nhas nothing to do with that.\nMR. FISHER: Well, that's not what this\nCourt -- case is saying --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I understand. I'm just\nsaying we ought to get a different test, and let's --\nlet's get rid of this. If we agree with you, let's get\nrid of this practically capable test, because\npractically capable, frankly, would make us come out the\nother way in this case.\nMR. FISHER: With all due respect, I don't\nthink that's correct. In Evansville in 1926, this Court\nused that exact phrase, practical capability. And it\nassessed that practical capability by looking at \"the\nfunction of the structure.\"\nAgain and again, in Evansville and other\ncases, this Court asked, was the function of the\nstructure to carry people or things across water.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that just\nhas -- I understand that argument. It's got no\nconnection whatever to the statutory language, right?\nMR. FISHER: Well, I think the word capable\nobviously is in the statute. And what this Court said\nas recently as Stewart is that capable --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Capable is in the\nstatute, purpose is not, right?\nMR. FISHER: Correct.\nAnd what this Court said in Stewart is that\ncapable means practically capable, not theoretically\ncapable. There's a range of how broad the word capable\ncan be.\nAnd again, going back over a century, every\nsingle time this Court's been confronted with that\nquestion, it's used the term function to describe\nwhether or not something is practically capable of\ncarrying people or things over water.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You -- you described\ncases with this purpose -- or function, the briefs cited\nthe district court decision, Sea Village Marina, that\nsays floating homes like the one here that can be towed\nand are not in the business of carrying people or goods,\nbut can be towed miles across the water, that those\nconstitute vessels.\nAnd this district court decision,\nSea Village Marina, cited many, many cases. And you say\nthat that district judge got it wrong, or the cases were\nwrong?\nMR. FISHER: Justice Ginsburg, I think\nthere's a confusion of terminology that I hope I can --\nthat I hope I can straighten out at the outset.\nThe term floating home is generally\ndescribed to mean a residence that is designed to sit\nstill and is not designed to carry people or things over\nwater.\nThe term houseboat is something that is\nself-propelled, generally moves people or things over\nwater.\nWhat happened in the Sea Village Marina\ncase, to my understanding, is the Court simply used the\nwrong term. It cited a lot of cases that held that\nhouseboats, as we describe a houseboat as something that\nis designed to move its owner and the owner's things\nfrom here to there, are vessels. And we don't dispute\nthat.\nBut on the other hand, you have something\ncalled floating homes, which the brief filed by the\nSeattle and Sausalito floating homes associations give a\nvery thorough description of what a floating home is and\nhow it's different.\nAnd a primary way that it's different is\nthat, as opposed to a houseboat, which is doing its\nfunction, it's doing its job when it's moving things\nfrom place to place, a floating home can't function when\nit's out in the water being towed. None of the\nutilities work, none of the power, no equipment is\naboard to do anything --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but in -- in your\nbrief, I really lost count, but I think it's six times\non the first two pages, you talk about indefinitely\nmoored.\nNow, the facts are in dispute, and we're not\nquite clear of the facts, but let's assume that this\nmagnificent structure is -- which was mercifully\ndestroyed -- let's assume that it was attached to the\ndock by a rope, a garden hose and an extension cord, and\nthat it could leave within 30 minutes notice. Is that\nindefinitely moored? And if the answer is yes, is that\nbecause of subjective intent of the owner?\nMR. FISHER: Justice Kennedy, it would be\nindefinitely moored. That's the term this Court used in\nStewart to describe whether something was being used to\ntransport people or goods.\nIt had said -- I have to emphasize that some\nof the assumptions we do in fact dispute in your\nhypothetical. But the fact that it sat still for three\nyears performing its function as a stationary residence\nshows that it was indefinitely moored.\nThe importance of indefinite mooring,\nthough, I want to emphasize, is actually less important\nin this case than it might be if this were a dead ship\ncase, where you had something that was concededly a\nvessel --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But suppose --\nMR. FISHER: -- in the question --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- you know the law school\ngame, suppose it was moved every month.\nMR. FISHER: It would still not be a vessel.\nAnd you don't have to look any further than this Court's\nEvansville case.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: That would be indefinitely\nmoored, in your view?\nMR. FISHER: Well, I'm not sure if you'd use\nthe term indefinitely moored at that point, but it\ncertainly wouldn't be transformed into a vessel because\nlook at this Court's Evansville case. The structure --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Before you get to\nEvansville, let's say it moved around, which is one\nthing, but also it had a raked bow; it wasn't square.\nThen -- then it starts to look more like a boat. It\nmoves around more frequently.\nIts mooring -- I mean, if you have a\nsailboat and you pull it up to a dock, you hook up for\nwater and plug in for power. It doesn't seem to me to\nbe terribly significant.\nMR. FISHER: I think that's right if you\nstart with something that is a vessel; the fact that you\nsimply leave it at the dock for a long time doesn't take\naway vessel status. That's what this Court held in\nStewart.\nBut if you start with something that isn't a\nvessel -- and I give you the Roper case, which did have\na raked bow; it was an old Liberty ship that everybody\nagreed had been decommissioned and turned into a\nnon-vessel. Then, they brought it in, they towed\nit -- Justice Ginsburg, they towed it -- they loaded it\nup with grain. Towed it again, let it sit still for a\ncouple years, towed it back, unloaded the grain. And\nthis Court said, it's not a vessel.\nAnd why did this Court say it's not a\nvessel? And I will quote from the opinion. It said:\n\"Because unlike a barge, the Harry Lane was not moved in\norder to transport commodities from one place to\nanother; it served as a mobile warehouse performing its\nfunction of storing grain.\" In the Evansville's case --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counselor, can I -- can\nI -- I have been lost even as I have read the briefs,\nbecause there's a lot of terminology that I'm not sure\n-- and standards that have been proposed that -- what\nconcepts they're tied to, okay?\nAs I see our cases, I'm -- I'm not quite\nsure where indefinitely moored came from. I've seen the\nword permanently moored.\nYou seem to be suggesting a difference\nbetween the two things, and I'm not sure where you get\nthe latter, indefinitely moored, from, and how that ties\nto the concept of purpose.\nDoes it -- does the permanent status or\nindefinite mooring of a vessel not make it -- of a\nstructure not make it a vessel, and/or does purpose get\nlayered on top of mooring?\nMR. FISHER: No. Purpose is the overall\nquestion. The way where --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But it applies to\nwhether something is permanently moored or floating on\nthe sea?\nMR. FISHER: That helps you determine its\npurpose. So the word -- where the word indefinite comes\nfrom, Justice Sotomayor, is from the Stewart case, where\nthis Court cited the Fifth Circuit's Pavone case with\napproval, which had held that an indefinitely moored\nfloating casino was not a vessel.\nJUSTICE ALITO: I just don't see how you can\nget purpose into this statutory language. It says\nnothing about purpose. It says, capable of being used\nas a means of transportation on water. How does purpose\nget in there? Whose purpose are we talking about?\nMR. FISHER: We're talking about an\nobjective purpose, Justice Alito --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Well, then you're not\ntalking about purpose; you're talking about function,\nright? You're just using purpose as a kind of strange\nsynonym for function.\nBut you're not talking about purpose of\neither the homeowner or the manufacturer of the boat.\nYou're just saying what does this -- or what does this\nthing, this floating home, do.\nMR. FISHER: Exactly. And I'm doing -- if I\ncan just say this directly, I'm trying to do exactly\nwhat this Court did in Cope and Evansville and Roper.\nThe exact analysis this Court applied in those cases is\nprecisely what we want this Court to apply here. But I\nthink what we're --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Can I ask about that\ndefinition? That definition comes from the Rules of\nConstruction Act, right --\nMR. FISHER: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- which provides the\nmeaning of all -- of the word vessel as used in the\nUnited States Code. Okay?\nMR. FISHER: Correct.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What -- what meaning of\nvessel in the United States Code is at issue here?\nMR. FISHER: The word vessel in the Maritime\nLien Act, which is what provides the Federal forum,\nassertedly, for the plaintiff, the City, to bring this\ncase. So the word vessel is -- is its jurisdictional\nand substantive hook.\nJustice Sotomayor, if I can return to your\nquestion about indefinite mooring, the importance of\nindefinite mooring in this case, where you have\nsomething that was not a vessel to begin with, is simply\nto ask whether it's been transformed into a vessel,\nexactly as this Court asked in Roper. So is it being\nused for its function for which it was created and --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Aren't you just\nbegging the question? You keep saying it was not a\nvessel to begin with. Why -- doesn't it just restate\nthe question?\nMR. FISHER: I'm not trying to beg the\nquestion; I'm just trying to describe our argument to\nyou. There are some cases where --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, doesn't your\nargument beg the question?\nMR. FISHER: I hope not. I'm trying to\ndistinguish between two lines of cases, one being where\nyou have things that were -- like the Roper case, that\nwere made as boats, as vessels undisputedly, and now the\nquestion is whether they've been pulled out of\nnavigation; as opposed to another set of cases, which we\nbelieve this falls into, where the question itself is\nwhether this was ever a vessel. In those kinds of\ncases, the indefinite mooring shows that it's being used\nfor its function.\nIt hasn't -- for example, if I could give a\nhypothetical, maybe it would help, imagine a piece of\nfloating dock. Now, under their test, that would be a\nvessel because you can unhook the dock, load it up with\nstuff and tow it around, if a company wanted to use that\nas a makeshift barge.\nBut no maritime case has ever held that a\nfloating dock is a vessel. But if somebody did that,\nthen it would no longer be indefinitely moored and would\nbe using a different function and might be transformed\ninto a --\nJUSTICE ALITO: I think you may -- you may\nvery well have a good argument, but if you're relying\neither on purpose or on indefinite mooring, then you've\nlost me. I don't see how they get -- how you get those\ninto the words of the statute.\nSuppose you have a boat, and it's tied up at\nthe harbor here in Washington. It hasn't been moved for\nfive years. It's indefinitely moved -- or 10 years or\n20 years. But if it's capable, if you could untie it\nand sail it out into the river, doesn't it fall within\nthe definition?\nMR. FISHER: It absolutely does because the\nfunction of a boat is to move people or things over\nwater. So when it's sitting still, Justice Alito, it's\nnot performing its function.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Right. So you are really\ntalking about a function test. And you are using\nstrange words, because they come out of our opinions --\nkind of not your fault. But you're really saying that\nwhat should apply here is a function test.\nWe are looking at this floating home. What\ndoes it do? Is it just a thing that sits, or is it a\nthing that transports things over water.\nIsn't that your test?\nMR. FISHER: Yes, it is. In addition --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So it changes -- one\n-- the same thing is not a boat sometimes, and it is a\nboat. You've got a casino that's tied up for a month.\nDuring that time, it's not a boat. And then they move\nit around to go to the other side of the river, and\nduring that time it is a boat?\nMR. FISHER: No, this Court in Stewart\nrejected the snapshot test that I think is what you just\ndescribed.\nThe question is whether what -- whether it\nhas the function of moving people and things over water\nor not. Now, some casinos go up and down the river --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But -- but I'm just\n-- the hypothetical -- the hypothetical I've posed was\nmeant to pose the question, well, sometimes things do\nboth, and how do we tell which it is --\nMR. FISHER: If it actually does the latter\nand is performing its function while moving, then it is\na vessel. And that's what this Court held in Stewart.\nThere's not a primary purpose test.\nIf one of its purposes is to move people or\nthings over water, then it's a vessel. But that's not\nthe purpose of a floating home. That's not the purpose\nof a floating restaurant or something else that might\nbe float --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Well, how do we know that.\nMR. FISHER: But you could tie it up and\nmove it.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: How do we know that, Mr.\nFisher? I mean, maybe these floating homes are just a\npoor man's houseboat, right? That the point of getting\na floating home is actually to have a home that you can\nhook up to a boat and move from place to place, and so\nyou don't have to, you know, have the motor running all\nthe time or have the capacity to move it all the time,\nbut when you want to move it on water and when you want\nto move your possessions on water, you have the capacity\nto do so.\nMR. FISHER: Well, with all due respect,\nJustice Kagan, that's not why people have floating\nhomes. The amicus brief explains that. Don't look\nat -- but you don't have to look any further than the\nhistory of this. The only two times it moved any\nsignificant distance were: One, when it changed\nownership; and two, when a hurricane struck, so it had\nto be moved.\nAnd look at your own cases. In Pavone,\nwhich this Court cited with approval in Stewart, that\nstructure moved hundreds of miles over several years.\nThis Court said not a vessel. The structure in\nEvansville moved three different ways. It moved up and\ndown the Mississippi-Ohio River as it changed ownership\nseveral times over the course of 14 years. It also\nmoved every winter to avoid the ice that would come in.\nAnd thirdly it was repositioned on literally almost a\ndaily basis to accord with the stages of the river. And\nagain, applying this Court's well settled function test,\nthis Court said that's not a vessel.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But it was still -- it was\nstill tied to the land with roads and ramps and so\nforth. Here you've got the hose and the extension cord\nand the rope.\nMR. FISHER: Well, the important --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And it seems -- and it\nseems to me, suppose you -- you want us to make some\nuniversal definition of we know what a floating home is.\nSuppose this -- suppose there were -- another owner of a\nstructure like this, and it moved to a different slip\nevery week to get more shade or more wind or something.\nThen that would be different?\nMR. FISHER: It would sound to me just like\nthe floating warehouse and office in Evansville as I\njust described that case. But Justice Kennedy, let me\nsay one more thing before I reserve my time.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And suppose it moved --\nsuppose it moved up and down the canal to get better or\nworse weather during different seasons.\nMR. FISHER: If it's simply being\nrepositioned and not being used for a transportation\npurpose, that is to move people or things, then it's not\na vessel. And that's exactly what this Court --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I have the same\nproblem Justice Kagan says. The whole point is that it\ncan move. That's the whole -- that's the reason you\nhave it.\nMR. FISHER: That is not the point,\nJustice Kennedy, with all due respect. There's a\ndifference between a floating home and a houseboat, and\nI urge you to look at the briefs on this point.\nAnd this comes right back to your\nquestion --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, outside of your\nfloating home, what other structures would be kept out\nof your definition of purpose or function and the city's\ndefinition of practically capable? Can you imagine any\nother function that's out there floating around?\nMR. FISHER: Other floating commercial --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Because they disavow\nwater skis and garage doors and say they're practical,\ncapable tests with --\nMR. FISHER: Well, I'm not sure they can\nactually disavow that on their tests, but --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, I know. But --\nMR. FISHER: Floating commercial\nestablishments, floating pieces, floating docks,\nfloating trampolines and play structures.\nAnd, Justice Kennedy, if I could just answer\nyour question and reserve the rest of my time. The\nimportance of the connecting of the utilities and the\nwater hose, which was actually a specialized water hose,\nnot a garden hose, but the importance of those\nconnections is found in State codes across the country\nthat distinguish between floating homes and houseboats,\nasking whether they're dependent on those connections to\noperate.\nA floating home cannot function if it's not\ntied to land. It doesn't matter how many amps we want\nto fight about, it's whether it needs that power from\nland, whether it needs those connections to land. A\nhouseboat, like any other vessel, can fully function\naway from port.\nIf I can reserve the remainder of my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Gannon.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF CURTIS E. GANNON,\nFOR UNITED STATES,\nAS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER\nMR. GANNON: Mr. Chief Justice and may it\nplease the Court:\nI think if I could start with Justice\nKagan's questions, the government's position is that\nthis is an objective function test and in evaluating\nwhen a structure is practically capable of being used as\na means of transportation this Court has repeatedly\nrecognized that function is important to that inquiry.\nIt did so as recently as Stewart, when it\nrecognized that the function of the dredge there was to\ncarry crew and equipment across Boston Harbor in the\ncourse of dredging a trench.\nIt also did so in the cases that\nPetitioner's counsel has already talked about,\nEvansville, Roper --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Can I -- can I\ninterrupt you just there on the dredging? You say the\nfunction of the dredge was to carry people and\nequipment. I would have said the function of the -- the\ndredge is to dredge in the middle of the river.\nMR. GANNON: Well, the Court --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right? And so --\nand I don't know which of us would be right, so it seems\nto me that that function test is a very difficult one to\napply.\nMR. GANNON: Well, the Court in Stewart said\nthat \"dredges\" -- and I'm quoting from page 492 --\n\"serve a waterborne transportation function, because\nthey carry crew and equipment across\" --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I know what it\nsaid. I guess I would say, obviously, it serves a\nwaterborne function, but I'm not sure the first thing I\nwould say when I see one of these dredges in the middle\nof the river is its purpose is to move people and\nequipment. I would say its purpose is to dredge.\nMR. GANNON: Well, but in general, it needs\nto dredge not just in one place, because it's not just\ndredging a hole, it's dredging a trench. It usually\nneeds to move in order to do that.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, I know but\nthat's saying that it has to be able to move, and I\nagree with that. But its purpose is still to dredge,\nnot to move.\nMR. GANNON: Well, I think that the Court --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You could use it if\nyou had a -- you know, a transportation boat, right?\nAny equipment you need to move, you put it on another\nboat and drop it off. The people who work, you bring\nthem over and drop it off.\nMR. GANNON: Yeah, I think that you could do\nthat. I think that's typically not the way the dredges\nthat -- not the way the superscoop works in Stewart and\nit's not the way historic dredges worked in the case\nof --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Sure it is, isn't\nit? I mean, the superscoop doesn't go to the -- maybe\nit does -- go to the shore every morning, then come\nright out again? They move people back and forth with\nother boats, don't they?\nMR. GANNON: Oh, but I -- what I meant is\nthat there are people and equipment on the superscoop\nwhen it is moving across Boston Harbor. They didn't\nsort of take it out there all empty every morning and\nthen load other things on to it that they -- that they\nbrought out there.\nAnd in Evansville, the Court recognized that\nthe wharf boat there, which is a large structure -- it\nwas 240 feet long, 48 feet wide -- it served as an\noffice, a warehouse, and a wharf on the side of the\nriver, and the Court said that it performed no function\nthat might not have been performed as well by structures\npermanently attached to the --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Suppose someone builds a\nreplica of an historic watercraft, a Viking boat, the\nkind of outrigger canoes that the Polynesians used\nthroughout the Pacific Ocean, and the purpose of this is\nto display it in a museum, no one has any intention\nwhatsoever of ever putting it in the water, but it's\nbuilt so that if they did, it would -- it would function\njust like its historic antecedent, is that a vessel?\nMR. GANNON: I think that that would be a\nvessel, because it really -- its objective function, if\nyou look at its design and its natural function --\nthat's just the phrase that the -- even Respondent's law\nprofessor amici used. They acknowledged that the\nfunction and purpose test is appropriate if it takes\naccount of the craft's own design and natural function.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What about the -- I thought\nthere was a -- a kind of caveat in one of these cases,\nmaybe Stewart, that said take a thing that looks just\nlike a boat, the Queen Mary, but if it is permanently --\nthey use the word \"indefinite.\" I think they mean\n\"permanently.\"\nMR. GANNON: Well, the Court --\nJUSTICE BREYER: But if it is permanently\nmoored to the shore and is never going to sea again,\nthen it isn't a vessel.\nMR. GANNON: That's true. That's because\nit's no --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Then if the Polynesian boat\nis permanently in the museum, there's a lot of objective\nevidence of that, it would not be a vessel. But if it's\nsomething they really could well take out on the sea,\nthen it is, is that right?\nMR. GANNON: It is true that the Court\nrecognized in Stewart and the Coast Guard's craft\nroutinely operated dockside policy is based upon the\npresumption that something that used to be a vessel can\ncease to be a vessel if it is semi-permanently or\nindefinitely moored. That's the phrase that the Court\nquoted in Stewart. And the Court recognized that even\nsomething that's anchored to the seabed could --\nJUSTICE BREYER: That doesn't come up here.\nThat concerns the Queen Mary being sent to Long Beach\nand used as a hotel.\nMR. GANNON: And the Queen Mary is behind\na -- is essentially behind a cofferdam. It doesn't have\nready access to open water. It's connected to shore in\nall sorts of permanent ways. We don't think that that's\nthe type of case that we have here, because nobody is\nsaying that this once was a vessel and it is now no\nlonger one just because it's tied up to the dock in the\nway that it was tied up here.\nAnd so, Justice Kennedy, we think that this\nisn't really a case about indefinite mooring as making\nthe difference. This is a case where you need to start\nwith the question of was it ever a vessel. And\nif the --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So I was right. So that\npermanent mooring is a different inquiry in your mind?\nMR. GANNON: Well, permanent mooring is\nusually going to be relevant to the question of whether\nsomething ceases to be a vessel, as it's no longer\npractically capable of being used as a means of\ntransportation. That's the way the Court discussed the\npoint in Stewart. And -- and that's true even for a\ncase like Roper, which was a former Liberty ship that\nwas towed up and down the James River.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, that's a -- that's\na somewhat easy case, because the hull, I think, was\nremoved or something was removed that made it --\nMR. GANNON: Well, there were things that\nhad been removed when it had been decommissioned\noriginally. But if the court of appeals test were used\nhere and the court were to conclude that something is a\nvessel, if it is merely capable of being towed across\nwater even to its detriment, then you can't explain the\nanswer in cases like Evansville or in Roper where --\nbecause the Evansville wharf boat was towed at least ten\ntimes, as described in pages 21 and 22 of the Court's\nopinion, and nobody was asking whether it had all\nthe office furniture and light fixtures and things like\nthat removed when it was towed at least twice a year for\nthe seven years before that suit began.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: So, Mr. Gannon, you think\nthat even at the moment that the thing is being\ntransported, and let's say that the thing has, you know,\nvarious furniture and things on it, you think even at\nthat moment under section 3, it's not a -- it might not\nbe a vessel?\nMR. GANNON: That's generally going to be\ntrue, yes. If the purpose of the structure, the\nfunction, the objective function of the structure is to\noperate, just to be stationary beside the dock, then\nit's not going to be a vessel even when it's being towed\nbehind another vessel. There may still be rules about\nhow it needs to be lit at night and things like that,\nbut --\nJUSTICE ALITO: What if it was more\nseaworthy so that it could be towed 200 miles without\nsuffering any damage, even if there are, you know, small\nwaves, let's say?\nAnd the reason why it was built that way was\nso that when the person moves the person wouldn't have\nto hire a moving company to come with a van and take out\nall the person's personal belongings and ship those\nby -- by land. This -- this is capable of moving and\nmoving all the stuff that's in it without having\nanything damaged. Would it be the same? What would be\nthe result there?\nMR. GANNON: Well, I -- I understand the\npoint. I think that, under a case like Evansville, that\nthere does seem to be a difference between relocating\nthe structure and using the structure to transport\npeople and things.\nBut under an objective function test, if it\nreally is designed to be mobile, and we look at it and\nwe say it really looks like a boat and it's designed to\nmove through water efficiently, it would probably look\ndifferent from this particular craft.\nBut if ultimate mobility is part of the\nfunction of it, then -- then the answer could well be\ndifferent.\nBut, for the most part, I think my answer is\nthe same as I was trying to give to Justice Kagan, which\nis that this is either going to be a vessel all the time\nuntil it becomes so permanently moored that it should no\nlonger be deemed a vessel.\nJUSTICE ALITO: I really just don't\nunderstand your answer. Mobility surely was a -- was a\npurpose of this because it was moved.\nMR. GANNON: Well, I --\nJUSTICE ALITO: It can be moved.\nMR. GANNON: There is a question about\npractical capability of being used and --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Okay. Well, that's\nsomething different.\nMR. GANNON: And before, you were asking\nabout the hook in the statute here. We do think that\nthe word contrivance does indicate that it's something\nthat has a function that's determinable.\nAnd there are lots of other areas in\nmaritime law where the function of a vessel is a\nrelevant question, and this is not an unanswerable\ninquiry. The court uses purpose and function when it's\ndeciding whether somebody is a Jones Act seaman --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Gannon, would you\nhave said sounds like this structure is not a vessel,\nperiod. But your bottom line in your brief is that, if\nwe disagree with the Court of Appeals, we shouldn't say\nthis contrivance is not a vessel, we should send it back\n-- for what?\nWhat finding?\nMR. GANNON: We think that the record here\nwas not really compiled with an object of answering\nthese questions, the things that we think are relevant,\nbecause the district court and the Court of Appeals\nflatly rejected any inquiry into the purpose or function\nof the vessel. And --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So what would we tell\nthem they should look into?\nMR. GANNON: That they should look into the\npurpose and function of the vessel. They should also\nconsider whether it would be damaged when it was towed.\nThat was something that petitioner tried to get. He was\nproceeding pro se in the district court, offered to\npresent evidence about --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: On the first question,\npurpose or function, what did they know that we can't\nknow by looking at this picture and listening to these\narguments?\nMR. GANNON: Well, I think that they could\nhear more about --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I mean, I would be willing\nto stipulate they are better at this than we are, but\nlet's -- let's assume.\nMR. GANNON: Well, I -- I think that\nsomebody -- if somebody -- I can't tell everything about\nthe structure. We have these pictures, and we know that\nit has a ten-inch draft, but we don't really know how --\nhow well it is that --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I want to be fair to the\nCourt of Appeals, well, now, you tell us what the\npurpose and function is.\nMR. GANNON: And I -- if --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Don't we know that?\nMR. GANNON: Well, I think that you -- in --\nthis is going to be a somewhat idiosyncratic case. I\nthink that this is an unusual structure. That's why the\nsurveyor on page J-43 of the Joint Appendix found that\nthere were no comparables for sale in the state of\nFlorida. And so I think that most cases aren't really\ngoing to -- to be like this.\nBut if I wanted to put on evidence about\nthat, I would probably compare -- decide whether this is\nmore like the floating homes that are described in the\nSeattle floating homes brief, that are really designed\njust to function in place near the shore. I think that\nthere would be more evidence about its capabilities\nwhile it was actually out on the water and things like\nthat.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel.\nMr. Frederick.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID C. FREDERICK\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. FREDERICK: Thank you Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nThe City brought this In Rem action against\nMr. Lozman's uninsured houseboat to enforce maritime\nliens. The houseboat was in violation of the wet slip\nagreement, and it posed a hazard to other vessels in the\nmarina if, because of its flimsy moorings, it came\nunmoored during a storm.\nThe houseboat was located very close to the\nnavigable channel of the Atlantic Intercoastal Waterway\nand next to a yacht-building facility next to the\nmarina. So the city faced a very real specter of being\nsued if the uninsured houseboat came unmoored and caused\ndamage.\nOur position is that the houseboat is a\nvessel under section 3 because it floats, moves, and\ncarries people or things on water, as the statutory --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Just like an inner\ntube, right?\nMR. FREDERICK: No. An inner tube actually\ndoes not --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Floats, can be\ntowed, can carry a person.\nMR.

FREDERICK: The test would be what's the\npractical capability, and a raft that has a bottom\nactually could very well be a vessel under the\nappropriate standard of practical capability.\nJUSTICE BREYER: This cup. What about the\ncup?\nMR. FREDERICK: Cup is not because a cup\ndoesn't float.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Oh, well, this is lighter\nthan you think.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No. How about a garage\ndoor?\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Take the inner tube and, you\nknow, paste a couple of pennies on the inner tube. Now\nit carries things. There are things on the inner tube,\nand it floats.\nMR. FREDERICK: Justice Kagan, I -- I think\nwe could imagine all kinds of de minimis types of\nhypotheticals that would satisfy the basic criteria.\nBut what the Court in Stewart said was practical\ncapability as viewed in a real world sense. And I'm not\naware of any case -- and they've certainly not pointed\nto anything -- that identifies anything with those kind\nof practical attributes that would be subject to\nlitigation.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, practical\ncapability viewed in a real-world sense -- and you're\nabout transportation -- you're talking about things that\nwere built for transportation, right?\nMR. FREDERICK: You're -- yes. You're --\nthat is true in the sense that one of the purposes, as\nmanifested through its physical characteristics, is the\nability to be moved across water.\nAnd just as Mr. Lozman's houseboat here was\nmoved 200 miles in the first towage after the hurricane\nwiped out every other vessel in the docks in the north\nbay marina, and he had it towed with a speed boat\n70 miles to the city of Riviera Beach, those physical\ncharacteristics and attributes were recognized by the\nCourt of Appeals when it applied the practical\ncapability test.\nAnd it said on page 15(a) of the petition\nappendix that certainly living, a domicile, is a purpose\nof a floating home, but mobility is also a purpose, and\nthen demonstrated that mobility here.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Under your definition,\nhow do you deal with Evansville?\nMR. FREDERICK: Evansville is a case with\nmany layers, but let me just start first start with the\nfact that the Court announced a practical capability\ntest in Evansville itself. That's what it applied. It\nreviewed a district court record that had found no\npractical capability on the basis of the driveways and\nthe more permanent connections to the utility system of\nthe city, and it reviewed that factual record for clear\nerror, which, of course, it didn't find, by --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What you are basically\nsaying, we reached the wrong conclusion because the\nwharf boat floated, and it regularly was moved, and\nthere was nothing to suggest that it couldn't carry\npeople or things. It happened not to because they would\nempty it, I understand, before they moved it, but it\ncould have.\nSo if it was practically capable of\nfloating, whether it was semi-tied to land or not, it\nwas released from land on somewhat of a regular basis.\nSo are you suggesting that in Stewart we change the\nEvansville rule?\nMR. FREDERICK: No. In Stewart you said\nwhat the holding of the case was, which was that it was\nnot practically capable of movement at the time that it\nsank.\nNow, I would like to just step back for a\nsecond because I think Evansville needs to be understood\nin the time in which it was decided. At that time, many\ncourts, including this one, at times, applied a snapshot\ntest, what is happening to this particular watercraft at\nthe moment in time where an admiralty tort occurs, where\nthe contract ensues, and the like.\nThis Court subsequently disavowed the\nsnapshot test; but, in Stewart, what the Court did was\nto describe Evansville and Cope as cases about not\npractically capable of movement or carriage because of\ntheir connections to the land.\nIn Evansville, the owner of the wharf boat\nalso owned the adjoining land and had control over the\ndock and built driveways so that trucks could come on\nand off, and had an eight-inch concrete lining on the\nhouseboat which are not typically -- sorry, on the wharf\nboat, which are not typically attributes one would think\nof as ordinarily for vessels.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I -- I got stopped here,\nback at Stewart. \"Practically capable of maritime\ntransport.\" Now, those are words I thought you have to\ninterpret with some degree of common sense, and the\nreason for that is because each of us can of course\nimagine all kinds of things, from Styrofoam sofas to --\nto just dozens of absurd things that have nothing to do\nwith ships or vessels and really could be used\ntheoretically to carry something on the water.\nSo what we think of is that practical\ncapability means that there must -- this must really\nhave as a function, as one of its functions -- I'd like\nto say purpose, but some people apparently don't like\nthat --\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- because it - it has some\nother implication that I don't understand. Okay.\nSo call it the function or the capacity, and\nit really does as a significant matter of carrying\nthings, and not just accoutrements like nails in its\nwalls, but -- but things from place to place to some\nsignificant degree, okay? So I've just taken the words\nof the test and through voice -- and trying to focus\nyour mind, I've said you have to do that really as a --\nit has to be some significant degree there, which this\none doesn't seem to have, all right?\nSo you see what I'm trying to do, and really\nit's a way of getting you to respond to that.\nMR. FREDERICK: I think it certainly did\nhave that. It had that capability, Justice Breyer,\nbecause it was actually moved on multiple occasions.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But it wasn't carrying\nthings.\nMR. FREDERICK: It was carrying his personal\neffects.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, that's true. And of\ncourse a Styrofoam sofa is -- is carrying the holes, or\nit's carrying the -- you know, the -- the coffee can or\nsomething that is on top. But when you have a thing\nthat carries itself, that isn't good enough.\nMR. FREDERICK: I --\nJUSTICE BREYER: It has to be something to\ndo with transporting a thing, transporting some stuff.\nMR. FREDERICK: It transported his\ncomputers; it transported his clothes. Except for the\nfact that his guns were confiscated before the marshals\ntook it --\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's what part of the\nhouse.\nMR. FREDERICK: -- it was moved, that -- no,\nthey're not part of the house. They're part of the\npersonal effects, just as someone had personal effects\nin his or her dwelling. And when the marshal towed it,\nit carried two people as part of the crew for the\ntransit between --\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. Think of what\nit's doing and compare that with the dredge that every\nday the workmen get on, they go into the middle of\nBoston Harbor, and then they start to work, and they\ndredge.\nAnd so you'd say, well, I see one of the purposes of\nthis boat is to carry those people out there.\nNow think of this one. This one is carrying\nthings, but that which it carries is just what is part\nof a normal house which has nothing to do with\ntransporting things on water.\nMR. FREDERICK: Well, actually, I think Mr.\nFisher conceded that if this had a motor and it was\ncarrying exactly the same personal effects, it would be\na vessel.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay. How do you then\ndistinguish -- I see where you're -- you're just saying\nmy distinction is not going to work, and so then I'd ask\nyou to say what one you want to come up with that will\nget rid of all the absurd examples that are lurking in\nthe back of my mind, which I will avoid -- and yet\ninclude --\n(Laughter.)\nMR. FREDERICK: I think that a vessel that\nhas practical capability, a watercraft that has\npractical capability to float, move and carry goods or\npeople, that's a vessel.\nJUSTICE BREYER: The floating sofa? The\nfloating sofa? Somebody is retired, he likes to see it\nfloat around in the water, and you know, and it carries\na cushion. I mean, really that's absurd. So -- so how\ndo you distinguish -- I gave you an absurd example. I\ndon't need to think of more.\nMR. FREDERICK: I think I've given up the\nabsurd hypos because there are no litigation on them.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Well, suppose, Mr.\nFrederick, this. Suppose we had a trial on the question\nof whether these floating homes or this floating home\nwas a vessel, and we found out that actually 99 percent\nof people who buy floating homes move it exactly once.\nThey purchase the floating home and then they move it to\nthe place where they want the home to be, and then it\nsits there. And this was just a clear evidence that,\nyou know, except if there's a hurricane or a tornado,\npeople do not move floating homes. They buy it, they\nmove it to where they want to live, and then it sits.\nIn that case, do you think the thing is a\nvessel?\nMR. FREDERICK: Yes, if it has the practical\ncapability. That's what the statute says, Justice\nKagan. It depends on if you want to rewrite the statute\nto have subjective intent --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Well, it's a statute --\nMR. FREDERICK: -- of lots of vessel owners.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: You're reading the statute\n-- you're reading the statute as if it says something\ncan be transported over water. But the statute doesn't\nsay that. It says something can be used or capable of\nbeing used as a means of transportation on water. So\nthat -- that the question is whether this thing is\ntransporting other things over water, and whether that's\nits function; and in my hypothetical it's not its\nfunction. Its function is to serve as a house. That\nhouse happens to be on water, but it's just a house.\nMR. FREDERICK: Justice Kagan, the fact that\na vessel only moves once doesn't mean that it's not a\nvessel if it has -- if it meets the attributes of the\nstatute, as explained by this Court in Stewart, of\npractical capability. The Titanic, of course, is a\nperfect example of that.\nThe fact that a person may choose mobility\nas a -- as one of the attributes and not exercise that\nattribute of course goes to subjective intent, and as\nthe Maritime Law Association's brief points out here,\nyou do not want to apply an intent standard that goes to\nwhat the owner intends to -- which function the owner\nintends to exercise, because that leads to manipulation.\nAnd the casino --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Frederick, the city's\nposition, it is whatever we want it to be. That is the\nfirst time Lozman was sued by the city. It was not\nunder admiralty jurisdiction, it was a plain old\nlandlord/tenant suit in State court, right?\nMR. FREDERICK: Yes, but there are some\nexceptions and if -- I will let you finish your\nquestion.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, well, my question\nis, is it -- is it a vessel when you want it to be, and\njust an ordinary landlord/tenant situation when you want\nit to be that way?\nMR. FREDERICK: No. I would answer that\nquestion as no.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, let's take this\nvery incident, that is he failed to comply with the\nrevised rules and he was behind in his payment of\ndockage fees. Could the city have brought that case in\nan ordinary State court for the arrears?\nMR. FREDERICK: No.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Why not?\nMR. FREDERICK: Because it's a vessel and\nthe exclusive admiralty jurisdiction of the United\nStates courts means that it has to be litigated in the\nUnited States courts.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What about --\nMR. FREDERICK: That's why in the first one,\nif I could just explain about the State court, because I\nthink that there is some misapprehension about what\nhappened.\nHis dog was not complying with the\nordinances, and he was not complying with the city\nordinances; that's why -- that's why the city brought\nthe in personam action against him in State court.\nThere was no admiralty basis there. He was still paying\nall of his dockage services and fees. It became an in\nrem action when the lien was not being discharged\nthrough his payment on the dockage fees, and the city\nhad a basis under the wet slip agreement to assert a\nmaritime lien, which is a classic admiralty action under\nFederal jurisdiction.\nSo they are very different actions. Under\nthe State court action he could still stay at the\nmarina, but he had to be on a houseboat that complied\nwith the marina's rules. He had two house boats at the\nmarina, and this one was not in compliance, and that is\nwhy the city brought action against it. It was the only\none of the 500-plus vessels and boats in this marina\nthat wasn't in compliance with the rules.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: We -- we want I suppose to\ngive the courts of appeals a test that works. I -- see\nif this is, sums up your argument, or your position.\nYou look to see the objective\ncharacteristic, the physical capacity of the -- of the\nstructure, and then you look not to purpose but to its\nobjective function: Does it carry goods under the\nstatute. And then I suppose you could under that say\nthat this is a vessel, but that this presumption is\novercome if it's permanently moored in a way the\nEvansville dredge was. Is -- is that your argument?\nMR. FREDERICK: I think that sums up in a\nnutshell what we would regard as a proper statement of\nthe law, of what this Court has already said, and that\nis that if it's got practical capability, those\npractical characteristics, Justice Kennedy, will\nmanifest itself in the functions. If somebody wants to\nbuy a domicile on land, one buys a house or a condo. If\nyou buy a floating home, that has the attribute, the\nphysical characteristics of floating, movage -- and\nmoving and carriage --\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's where - that's\nexactly -- I mean, I think that works pretty well; and\nyou think that works pretty well, but I don't agree with\nyou at the moment hypothetically. So something's wrong\nsomewhere. And what I'm thinking is that you could have\nvery odd things, you know, like an advertising sign,\nfloating advertising sign and tow it around. Is that\nfloating advertising sign a vessel? No, it doesn't\ncarry goods but it does carry, say, the eyes on the\nfigure which might move around; and then it does -- and\nJustice Kennedy said carrying goods. All right. Does\nthis structure, this houseboat have a function of\ncarrying goods? You're tempted to say yes, because his\npersonal effects are in it. I'm attempted to say no,\nbecause there is nothing special about those personal\neffects that isn't exactly similar to their being in a\nsimilar structure on land.\nThat's where I am wondering if there is a\ndistinction. That's -- do you see what I -- what's\nbothering me?\nMR. FREDERICK: Justice Breyer, there is no\nbasis, I mean, with all due respect, there is no basis\nin your cases to -- to hold that there is something\nabout transportation that makes it somehow uniquely\nnautical or maritime as opposed to --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, it's nothing --\nMR. FREDERICK: -- household effects or\nother goods or services or people that are transported\nover land. And that's why when the normal definition of\ntransportation is to convey a person or a thing from one\nplace to another, that's perfectly satisfied under the\nfacts of this case. And it is an undisputed record as\nPetitioner says, on page 27 of the cert petition, they\nask for cert here for you to decide whether Mr. Lozman's\nstate of mind about his indefinite mooring is somehow\nrelevant to the definition of a vessel. It clearly\nisn't.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I guess the problem is\nthe list of absurdities that they point to, not the\nleast of which is a dry dock, which you talk about\nwhether it's permanently moored or not, but most dry\ndocks are held in place by, you know, heavy ropes but\nyou can cut them and you can stick something on them and\nthey can float away. Under -- so how do you --\nMR. FREDERICK: I don't accept the premise\nof your argument. The --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: For the --\nMR. FREDERICK: The dry docks with which I\nam familiar are anchored to the bottom so that they can\nstay in one place and they don't carry anything, so they\ndon't meet the part of the test that requires carriage.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So what do you do with\nthe --\nMR. FREDERICK: They are simply physical\nstructures --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- trampoline and the\nother examples your adversary gave? Is a trampoline\nthat floats on water capable of moving -- it's moving\nthe trampoline.\nMR. FREDERICK: I don't think it's\npractically capable of carrying anything.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It's carrying the\nTrampoline.\nMR. FREDERICK: And again --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So is the difference\nwhether I attach something permanently or temporarily to\nthe top of the floating thing, the floating board, the\nfloating whatever?\nMR. FREDERICK: Well, it would not be\nsubject to towage. Here the houseboat had -- this is\nimportant because the houseboat under the testimony Mr.\nLozman elicited at trial had four towing cleats that\nwere welded into the structure of his houseboat so that\nit could be towed without torquing and twisting the\nhouseboat and causing it to sink. The hypotheticals\nthat the other side has suggested don't have that\nadditive feature of towing cleats that are used for the\npurpose of being able to convey the houseboat --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, your\nexample of the towing cleats highlights one of the\ndifficulties I have; one, because obviously the question\nof, well, what if they didn't have the towing cleats,\nand then what if they had the towing cleats and then\ntook them off, what if they were temporary towing\ncleats. One of the things, this is a jurisdictional\nstatute and we like jurisdictional statutes to be clear\nand easy of application. Why do you think your test is\neasier than your friend's test?\nMR. FREDERICK: Because the physical\ncharacteristics of this houseboat all point to the\nattributes of being a vessel. It floats, it moves, it\ncarries. It's got nothing to do --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's got -- it\ndoesn't have -- the thing that makes something look most\nlike a boat in my view is a raked bow. That tells you\nthat that's what they want to use it for, to move\nthrough the water. This is straight up and down.\nMR. FREDERICK: Well, Mr. Chief --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It doesn't have a --\nwhat are the things called on the side, the elevated\nsides that you'd look for in a boat.\nMR. FREDERICK: We would submit that\nCongress did not intend a you-know-it-when-you-see-it\ntest. House barges, barges have been vessels since the\ntime of Cleopatra. The fact that it is flat-bottomed\nand it floats and it moves and it carries things does\nnot make it not a vessel.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Frederick, this is\nkind of an idiosyncratic case. There are many cases I\nthink in the courts now about floating casinos. I take\nit on your definition the floating casino would be a\nvessel subject to maritime jurisdiction.\nMR. FREDERICK: Yes, unless it has a\nphysical impediment that takes it out of one of the\nthree attributes that doesn't make it a vessel. If --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: As long as the vessel\nstays in one place and the gambling goes on in one\nplace, then it may be towed to a different location, and\nit stays there. You -- you say because it is able to be\nmoved from one place to another it qualifies as a\nvessel?\nMR. FREDERICK: Yes.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Even if it's rather\npermanently moored with a, with a -- like the Intrepid\non the Hudson River --\nMR. FREDERICK: I'm not familiar --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: With about -- aircraft\ncarrier. But it's really fixed in there with regular\nwalkways and so forth. Very -- it would cause a lot of\nwork in order to move it.\nMR. FREDERICK: We suggest that the way the\ncourt should think about that problem is as a physical\nimpediment. Are physical impediments preclude its moat\nmovement or carriage or floating capacity --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Frederick, if that is\nthe case, then your test really comes down to how\nsecurely is something fastened. I mean, you have to\ndeal with Evansville's wharf boat and you have to deal\nwith Cage's dry dock, and you have to deal with all\nthese floating casinos and restaurants. And you're\nsaying that in all these cases we are supposed to look\nto is it a rope or is it a cable, how many cables, how\nquickly can it be disengaged, and that that's going to\nend up being the test that you would have us adopt which\nis how easy it is to get out of the port.\nMR. FREDERICK: I think that's a fair way to\nview it, Justice Kagan, and it's a perfectly appropriate\none. The Belle of Orleans case --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: That really does become a\njury question -- a question of fact for everything,\nright? You know, are there six cables, are there nine\ncables, what are they made of, you know, how long is it\ngoing to take to rip up the -- the I-beams, whatever?\nMR. FREDERICK: Well, I think that as a\npractical matter, this arises in only a couple of\ninstances and those are the casino boats, many of which\nwere vessels and they traversed the rivers allowing\npeople to gamble because that's how state laws required\nthem to perform. And they have since stopped trying to\nbe vessels because of state law changes that they were\nable to make. And so the question as a practical matter\nis are there physical impediments to the ability of that\nboat to -- to use the capability to move? The Star of\nIndia, which was referenced in the Belle of Orleans\ncase, was not -- was a vessel, a sailing vessel from the\n19th century. In 1926 they took it out of commission as\na sailing vessel and they towed it to San Diego, where\nit sat for 50 years tied to the dock, and for the\nbicentennial, they decided let's get the boat out and\nsail it and they sailed it for the bicentennial. The\nNinth Circuit held that's a vessel because it has the\ncapability of being used as a vessel. And the fact that\nsomething is moored for a long time, if it has the\nphysical attributes to be a vessel, it is a vessel. The\nUnited States -- the USS Constitution, the famous USS\nConstitution would be shocked to have heard Mr. Gannon's\nstatement about vessel because there are 200 Navy\nservice members who service the USS Constitution and\ntake it out periodically for sail.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Is there any problem here,\nwhich I think maybe the Coast Guard and the other people\nwho are responsible for vessels, say once we start\nthinking that everything in the house is a vessel -- I\noverstate -- we're going to have an impossible time\ndoing our job. I mean, you know, you are going to see\nsome kind of a log next to a beach somewhere and\nsomebody's going to start calling it a vessel. We've\ngot to limit this somehow to things that really are used\nas vessels.\nMR. FREDERICK: Yes --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Is that a problem, and if\nso, how would you deal with it?\nMR. FREDERICK: If it were a problem the\nCoast Guard would have signed the Solicitor General's\nbrief in this case which they have done in other cases\nin which transportation and vessel status have been\nrelevant like in Sprietsma v. Mercury Marine, United\nStates v. Locke, in which the Coast Guard --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: This is not very\ncompelling in this case because they have regulations\nthat pretty much echo what the Solicitor General is\nsaying, so it's not as if they were going to take a\ndifferent position. The Solicitor General is basically\nsaying follow the Coast Guard regulations.\nMR. FREDERICK: And the statute underlying\nthose regulations, Justice Sotomayor, is found at 46 USC\n4302, and it provides the secretary very broad\ndiscretion on what to include within the regulations and\nwhat not to. After this court decided the Stewart case,\nthe secretary suspended many regulations for dockside\nvessels until the Coast Guard could issue new\nregulations. There is a hint, there is a suggestion\nthat there might be a problem, but there is not anything\nthat is really given in practical terms.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but, I mean,\nthere is some easy things to visualize as a problem. If\nthis is a vessel, then the maid that comes on twice a\nweek is a seaman under the Jones Act, right?\nMR. FREDERICK: No. And the reason why is\nbecause as this court recognized in Stewart, the in\nnavigation requirement is something that has been used\nfor limiting the reach of Jones Act seamen in those\ncircumstances in which a vessel is taken out of\nnavigation. So I think that it would be appropriate in\na case like this where this is a classic instance of a\nmaritime lien, dockage --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry, taken out\nof navigation, but not every time it's docked, right?\nMR. FREDERICK: No. But no -- and in fact,\nI think the question of who is a Jones Act seaman is a\ndifferent test that this Court last discussed in the\nChandris case, in terms of its substantial connection to\nthe mission of the vessel. And that -- I think that the\nCourt could safely leave the Jones Act issues aside,\nbecause they bring in an entirely different regime that\nfocuses on the worker's connection to the vessel as\nopposed to the definition of vessel itself.\nThe definition of vessel itself here is, as\nJustice Scalia pointed out, part of the Dictionary Act,\nand it is something that does apply more broadly. But\nas we briefed in this case, there are two provisions\nthat take that definition and then they add an intent\nrequirement as specific language in different parts. So\nthat if that idea, function, or intent or purpose is\nsomething that is germane to that particular statutory\nfunction, than that is a question that becomes a\nquestion for jurisdiction.\nBut I'd also like to point out that both, I\nthink, the district court and the court of appeals here\nassumed that there was jurisdiction here because there\nhad not been evidence that contested the basic\nprinciples that the City brought when it profiled this\nin rem action.\nAnd because the case then moved into the\nmerits phase, the district judge here initially denied\nthe motion to dismiss for want of jurisdiction without\nprejudice. And then as the evidence came in, revisited\nthe question to provide a fuller explanation, and at\nthat time made the ruling that Mr. Lozman had not put in\nrecord evidence that affected the practical capability\nof the test.\nThe only thing Mr. Lozman argued in the\ncourt of appeals as a reason for error was that because\nhe intended to live there indefinitely, even though he\nhad no contractual or property right to do so, and he\nhad signed a wet slip agreement that provided the marina\ncomplete discretion to move his houseboat within any of\nthe slips, or to order of the houseboat to leave on 3\ndays' notice, the question of whether or not there was\nany record of evidence on practical capability got to\nthe Eleventh Circuit, and the Eleventh Circuit, in\napplying a practical capability test, said the things\nthat Mr. Lozman had argued, he didn't offer record\nevidence.\nSo, Justice Kennedy, to your point, I think\nthat with respect to the Court of Appeals and how it did\ndo its job here is an important facet of the case as it\ncomes.\nThey initially asked you in the cert\npetition, grant cert because the Fifth Circuit and the\nSeventh Circuit have applied an onerous intent test.\nThey've not defended that test. And it is abjectly\nerroneous because you can't have vessel status be so\neasily manipulated by an individual's intent. And now\nby trying to morph it into some kind of function or\nobjective purpose standard, they've essentially done\nexactly what the Eleventh Circuit said they had offered\nno evidence in the district court to try to prove.\nIf there are no further questions.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Fisher, you have 3 minutes left.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L. FISHER\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. FISHER: Thank you.\nI think Mr. Frederick's best argument that\nI've heard, and some of this Court has echoed it, is\nthat this is a vessel because it was moved around and it\ncarried his personal effects. The difficulty is that\nargument runs absolutely headlong into Evansville and\nRoper; it cannot be squared with those cases. And I\nwould be willing to rest my entire case on simply this\nCourt reading and applying those cases.\nIn Evansville, this Court dealt with\nsomething that carried around the effects of a business\noffice. In Roper, this Court dealt with something that\ncarried around grain and was far more seaworthy than the\nstructure in this case.\nBoth instances, the Court said they're not\nvessels because the function was not to carry those\nthings around, it was merely -- they were merely\nincidental relocations.\nNow -- so for that reason, the Eleventh\nCircuit simply cannot be right when it says that\nfunction is irrelevant. And the City can't be right on\nits test either. The only way the City has proposed to\ndeal with those cases is to look at how securely the\nstructure is fashioned.\nAnd Justice Kagan, you're exactly right. If\nyou want a recipe for disaster on jurisdictional\nquestions, start asking whether it's chains or ropes.\nAnd not only that, if you want something that's utterly\nmanipulable, just tell the yacht owner who has his yacht\ndown in the harbor that all he has to do is hook it up\nto the dock with chains instead of ropes and now he's\nout of maritime jurisdiction.\nSo this Court's cases for almost a century\nhave applied the exact test we're asking this Court to\napply. And even if you're not 100 percent persuaded\nthat that's what the statute is best read as doing, that\nis what we have done for over 100 years, and that is how\nmaritime law has built up and guaranteed on those -- on\nthose understandings.\nAnd it's not just the questions we've been\ntalking today -- it's employment law, tort law, all the\nrest are built on this test. And we're asking this\nCourt simply to reaffirm what it's done in the past.\nSo I think that leaves the question of, when\nyou know the Eleventh Circuit applied the wrong test and\nyou know the City's test can't be right, do you vacate\nor do you send -- or do you simply reverse? And we\nthink -- Justice Kennedy, we think that you can simply\nreverse. You have everything in the record you need,\nmost notably in the surveyor's report.\nAnd you can look at four things. Look at\nthe -- look at the materials used, the shape of the\nstructure, its equipment and the utilities. The\nmaterials used were plywood and ordinary land-based\nstructures.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That is -- what was\nused in the Higgins boats in World War II.\nMR. FISHER: I'm -- I'm not saying any of\nthese are determinative, Mr. Chief Justice, but it's a\ntotality that tells you what it is.\nAnd the next thing is the shape. Exactly as\nyou referred. This is a rectangle that sits 10 inches\nunder the water, is not meant to be moved around. Look\nat the -- look at its features. It has French doors on\nthree sides a few feet above the water line. That's not\nwhat a vessel -- not how a vessel is designed.\nAnd finally, its utilities. Again, at Joint\nAppendix 40, for example, it says this thing has no\nbatteries. It is utterly dependent on being hooked up\nto land. That's the only way it can function.\nSo if this Court does nothing else between\nnow and casting its vote and writing its opinion,\nrevisit this Court's prior cases and reassert the rule\nthat this Court has always applied.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nCounsel.\n"
