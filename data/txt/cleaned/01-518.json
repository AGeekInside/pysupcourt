        "content": "ORAL ARGUMENT OF\nMAURICE BASKIN, ESQ.\nOn behalf of the Petitioner\nLAWRENCE G. WALLACE, ESQ.\nOn behalf of the Respondents\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF\nMAURICE BASKIN, ESQ.\nOn behalf of the Petitioner\nP R O C E D I N G S\n(11:08 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: We'll hear argument\nnext in No. 01-518, the BE&K Construction Company v. the\nNational Labor Relations Board.\nMr. Baskin.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MAURICE BASKIN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. BASKIN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThis case presents an important question arising\nunder the Petition Clause of the First Amendment.\nPetitioner BE&K Construction is asking the Court to hold\nthat the First Amendment protects objectively based\nlawsuits from being declared unlawful by the National\nLabor Relations Board.\nNow, the Court has already held that the First\nAmendment does protect lawsuits from statutory sanction\nunder both the NLRA and the antitrust laws so long as the\nsuits are meritorious, meaning that they are not\nobjectively baseless. In the Bill Johnson's case, the\nCourt said -- and I quote -- it is not unlawful to pursue\na meritorious lawsuit under the National Labor Relations\nAct. In fact, the Court said it twice and specifically\ncited the Noerr-Pennington doctrine of the antitrust law.\nThen it --\nQUESTION: How do you describe the test applied\nby the board?\nMR. BASKIN: Well, the test by the board is one\nwhich says that the employer must be -- must prevail, must\nbe 100 percent prevailing in the lawsuit. As a standard\nthat's impossible for any employer to anticipate in\nadvance. No -- no employer can ever be 100 percent sure\nof prevailing.\nQUESTION: Should there be any other component?\nI mean, I think your client lost basically. So --\nMR. BASKIN: Well, the question is what was --\nQUESTION: What else should be part of the test?\nMR. BASKIN: The test is what is the -- was\nthere an objective basis for the litigation. It's not a\nwin-or-lose test, as the Court said in Professional Real\nEstate -- and I'll quote again -- it's got to be\nobjectively baseless in the sense that no reasonable\nlitigant could realistically expect success on the merits.\nQUESTION: Well, should the test from\nProfessional Real Estate automatically be carried over to\nthe Labor Relations Act?\nMR. BASKIN: Well, in this case, Your Honor, an\nanswer is yes because the Court itself has interacted with\nthe -- both of the acts. They cross reference with each\nother. Bill Johnson's referred directly to the California\nMotor Transport. Professional Real Estate referred to\nBill Johnson's as if it's one consistent whole. And it\nis.\nQUESTION: Well, but I -- I wonder if -- if the\nNational Labor Relations Board doesn't have some\ndiscretion to say that the labor situation is somewhat\ndifferent, as they apparently do, from the antitrust\nsituation.\nMR. BASKIN: Well, but the irony here is that\nthe NLRB has not -- has not interpreted its own statute.\nIt's not being deferred to here. The NLRB is interpreting\nthis Court's decision in Bill Johnson's.\nQUESTION: Which happened to say precisely what\nthe NLRB said it said.\nMR. BASKIN: Well, no, Your Honor. In Bill --\nQUESTION: If a judgment goes against the\nemployer in the State court, if it goes against him, then\nhe's had his day in court. And then the board may proceed\nto adjudicate the unfair practice claim, and then the\nemployer's suit, having been proved unmeritorious, the\nboard can take that fact into account when it decides the\nlabor law violation.\nMR. BASKIN: Three --\nQUESTION: And you've been reading three cases\nto us, so that seems to be the language that you have. I\n-- I read that as saying you lose. Period. End of the\nmatter. That's what the board decides.\nNow, I put that so you'll reply to it.\nMR. BASKIN: Yes. Three things in the phrasing\nthat you just said. First, the Court said the board may\nproceed, did not say it's an automatic result. Said may\nadjudicate the unfair labor practice, did not say it's an\nautomatic result.\nAnd then key phrase, having proved to be\nunmeritorious, what does unmeritorious mean? Well, this\nCourt has consistently said what unmeritorious means. It\nsaid so before Bill Johnson's in the Christiansburg case.\nQUESTION: Mr. Baskin, back up a bit.\nMR. BASKIN: Yes.\nQUESTION: The -- the Court in that very\nparagraph gave a definition of what it meant. So, I\nwouldn't look outside this document for what the Court\nmeant by with merit/without merit when the -- look at the\nsentence in the middle of that paragraph. It says if the\njudgment goes against the employer and the State court.\nMR. BASKIN: Yes.\nQUESTION: Judgment against you. Or if his suit\nis withdrawn or is otherwise shown to be without merit.\nOtherwise shown to be merit. I took that to mean if you\nlose, it's shown to be without merit. There may be other\nsituations in which it's shown to be without merit. So,\nit seems to me the best place to find out what the Court\nmeant merit/without merit is the very opinion that we're\nconstruing.\nMR. BASKIN: Yes, and if it were the holding of\nthe opinion, it would have greater weight. But this is\nnot the holding that we're talking -- that we're parsing\nout here. This is dicta because the essential --\nQUESTION: Well, there are two responses to the\ndicta point it seems to me. The first one is it was\ndicta, but it was dicta that preceded a remand in which\nthis issue in fact would be explored. And the second\nresponse is the -- as I understand it, the board itself\nhas followed the -- the dicta for -- I forget how many\nyears now, but consistently followed it and Congress has\ndone nothing about it. So, A, query whether it's dicta,\nand B, even if it is, isn't it the kind of dicta that at\nthis point definitely should be followed?\nMR. BASKIN: It is clearly dicta because the\nCourt stated what was the issue before it, and the sole\nissue before it in Bill Johnson's is stated at the\nbeginning of the opinion, whether the NLRB may issue a\ncease and desist order to halt the prosecution of a State\ncourt civil suit brought by an employer to retaliate\nagainst employees.\nAnd the holding of the case, which analyzes the\nFirst Amendment at great length, says that the right of\naccess to the courts is too important to be an unfair\nlabor practice. And it also defines meritorious as being\nreasonable basis, language in the Court's opinion.\nQUESTION: I think there's another element that\nyou're ignoring. I thought the board looked both at\nwhether it was a meritless lawsuit against the unions and\nwhether it was for a retaliatory purpose.\nMR. BASKIN: Yes.\nQUESTION: Isn't that the other element?\nMR. BASKIN: Yes. Both elements must be\npresent.\nQUESTION: Okay. And how do we define\nretaliatory purpose? What -- what constitutes that --\nMR. BASKIN: Well, it's --\nQUESTION: -- do you think, in the board's rule?\nMR. BASKIN: Yes. It's very -- pretty much the\nsame as the improper motivation purpose test that was in\nthe Professional Real Estate case, which also has the two-\npart test. You look at the objective basis first, and\nthen and only then if there's no objective basis, you look\nat whether there was a retaliatory motive.\nAnd how that's defined, although the Court did\nnot grant cert on that issue, we contested vigorously the\n-- the board's finding of retaliatory motivation here --\nbecause in fact the board has made it a rubber stamp.\nIt's become automatic if the case relates in any way to\nunion activity, the board finds that it's retaliatory\nmotivation.\nBut the first part of the test is an objective\none that the Court has spelled out both in Bill Johnson's\nitself and in Professional Real Estate. And to take any\n-- to take the board's standard puts employers in an\nimpossible situation. It is unworkable. Going back to\nthe question of dicta or not, you have ambiguous language\nat best because we have several different references to\nmeritorious throughout the Bill Johnson's opinion.\nQUESTION: May I just ask this, Mr. Baskin? Do\nyou think there is a distinction between an ongoing case\nand a completed case?\nMR. BASKIN: It's one mostly as to timing and\nfacts available to the board, and I think that's what the\nCourt was --\nQUESTION: But the -- in your view, the standard\nis the same. It's not that the board tries to enjoin the\nproceeding as -- as opposed to later on bringing an unfair\nlabor practice after it's over.\nMR. BASKIN: The substantive standard should be\nthe same.\nQUESTION: It should be, but --\nMR. BASKIN: Should be.\nQUESTION: -- do you think that Johnson says\nit's the same?\nMR. BASKIN: We're all here today because the\nlanguage in the tail end of the Bill Johnson's opinion is\nambiguous as to what they intended the standard to be.\nQUESTION: And at least it says there's a\ndifferent standard.\nMR. BASKIN: As to -- the -- the impact was --\nQUESTION: And your view is there should be no\ndifferent standard.\nMR. BASKIN: Correct.\nQUESTION: And that's the whole key to the case.\nMR. BASKIN: That really is the whole key to the\ncase.\nQUESTION: And why not?\nQUESTION: Mr. Baskin, is your -- is your\nargument -- in your opening remarks, you -- you referred\nonly to the First Amendment. Is -- is it -- is it a\nconstitutional argument you're making? To -- to agree\nwith you here, do I have to agree that if Congress passed\na law adopting the English rule on -- on attorney's fees,\nthat would be unconstitutional?\nMR. BASKIN: No. We are not saying that. We\nare not seeking to constitutionally -- we are asking no\nmore than that you apply this standard to the two statutes\nyou've already applied it --\nQUESTION: Which says -- so, it's a statutory\nargument.\nMR. BASKIN: No. It is a constitutional and\nstatutory argument, which is what the Court itself said in\nboth of these cases because there's a sanction involved.\nQUESTION: I don't know what you mean by a -- is\nit -- does the Constitution prohibit it or not?\nMR. BASKIN: It prohibits a statute from\nprohibiting it.\nQUESTION: The Constitution prohibits. So, your\nanswer to my question is --\nMR. BASKIN: Constitutional and statutory.\nQUESTION: You -- you cannot -- that Congress\ncould not adopt the English rule.\nMR. BASKIN: No. The difference -- here's the\nimportant difference.\nQUESTION: It would do that by statute.\nMR. BASKIN: But is there an -- a declaration of\nunlawfulness involved? There are many fee-shifting\nstatutes. We're not taking issue with mere fee-shifting,\nbut the National Labor Relations Board is saying that BE&K\nbroke the law, and that's what also happened under the\nantitrust laws. They're saying -- they're issuing a cease\nand desist order from filing so-called nonmeritorious\nlitigation.\nQUESTION: But the fact that it's triple damages\nis a little different than fee-shifting. So, one could\neasily say, when you're exposed to treble damages,\nputative damages, yes, that's a punishment. Here fee-\nshifting is the rule in most countries in the world.\nSo, what is the more here? I understand the\nmore in antitrust cases, treble damages. Here you say,\nwell, there's a finding that you have committed an unfair\nlabor practice. What are the consequences in addition to\nthat you have to pay the other side's legal fees? What\nare the adverse consequences --\nMR. BASKIN: First, the most important is the\ndeclaration that you are a law violator in and of itself.\nYou have to post a notice for your employees not only at\nthis job site but all across the country. You have your\n-- your customers become aware of it. The unions\ncertainly make sure your customers become aware of it.\nThere's the serious danger of debarment either privately\nor by governmental action.\nQUESTION: Explain that. You did say that in\nyour brief about debarment, and I didn't -- I can\nunderstand when you say someone -- someone's reputation is\naffected by being labeled a law violator. But you said\nsomething about -- about the jeopardy of debarment and I\nwasn't clear how that would work.\nMR. BASKIN: It's not meant in the legal sense\nand the Government -- we're not -- we're not talking about\nwhether the Government has to debar the company, but both\nprivate actors and many Government contracting officers\ntake the view they don't want to deal with people who have\nbeen declared to be law violators. The goodwill and\nreputation of the company is at stake.\nQUESTION: Well, in our lower case, the --\nWisconsin set out to do that on a State basis, didn't it?\nIf you violated the Labor Act, the State was not going to\ndeal with you.\nMR. BASKIN: Yes, they did. And then the\nFederal Government just last -- 2 years ago in the\nprevious administration, had come through with a set of\nrules saying that companies would be debarred if they were\nfound to have violated labor laws.\nSo, having this -- a declaration of illegality\nin place is what makes this different, Justice Scalia,\nfrom a random fee-shifting statute, and that's why we are\nnot asking you to do anything other than what you've\nalready done, which is to apply the First Amendment to two\nstatutes which you have determined have great commonality\nover the years, as each one keeps referring back to the\nother in this doctrine.\nQUESTION: What do you do with the 2 decades\nthat have elapsed -- about 2 decades -- since Justice\nWhite's opinion which has been interpreted by the board\nthe way the language most naturally reads? The one thing\nis to say when the case first came out it was ambiguous.\nBut now we have 2 decades of consistent interpretation of\nthat language by the board.\nMR. BASKIN: I regret to say it's a tribute to\nthe speed of the board's processes and the process of\ngetting this case up to this level on this issue because\nthis case alone has taken 7 years to work its way through\nthe board. When the litigation was begun in this case, it\nwas 1987. The Bill Johnson's case was fresh. There was\nconsiderable doubt as exactly -- as to exactly what it\nmeant. I should note that in the district court opinions\nthat are part of the appendix, the unions raised Bill\nJohnson's and said that it -- they were protected under\nit, citing it interchangeably with Professional Real\nEstate.\nQUESTION: They won over half their cases,\ndidn't they?\nMR. BASKIN: Excuse me?\nQUESTION: Didn't they win -- they won some 15\nout of their 29 cases.\nMR. BASKIN: Depending on how you count, they\njust barely got over 50 percent.\nQUESTION: Did you ask -- talking about the\nhistory of the case, could you tell me how did this case\nend up in the Sixth Circuit?\nMR. BASKIN: Well, in fact, by the time this\ncase got to the court of appeals, BE&K was no longer doing\nbusiness in California. The gravamen of its doing\nbusiness was in the Sixth Circuit.\nQUESTION: I see.\nMR. BASKIN: And that's why the decision was\nmade --\nQUESTION: I'd like you to address, if I can go\nback to the -- what I think was the Chief Justice's\nquestion. Your -- your basic point, I take it, assuming\nwith you, as I will, for the moment that the language is\nambiguous in Bill Johnson, is that we should treat or the\nstatute should be interpreted as treating the antitrust\nstatute and the labor statute a case brought by a\ndefendant the same way.\nAnd obvious differences, which I'd like you to\naddress, are that, one, there is a history in the labor\nlaw of employers using cases brought at law either to\nbreak unions or to win disputes. And that was one of the\nreasons why the NLRA was passed. That had nothing to do\nwith the antitrust laws. There is no such history.\nSecond, the employer -- the -- the matter is\ncommitted to an expert board in the labor area, which\napparently believes that the way to enforce the labor law,\nunlike the antitrust law, is to say the sham exception\nexists before the case is decided, but once the case is\ndecided, we're going to keep employers out of the courts\nby saying if they lose, that's the end of any immunity\nthat they get. And we will now look to what their motive\nwas in bringing this lawsuit. We have an expert board.\nWe have a different history. We have different statutes.\nMR. BASKIN: The --\nQUESTION: And now, what is your response?\nMR. BASKIN: The irony is that the Court\nconsidered those purported differences in the Bill\nJohnson's case and rejected them.\nQUESTION: All right. Obviously -- look --\nMR. BASKIN: No, no. I'm talking about the\nfirst part.\nQUESTION: I -- but I'm trying to stay away from\nBill Johnson because obviously if you're right that the\nstatute holds it, I mean, I -- all right. Go ahead.\nSorry. I didn't mean to interrupt.\nMR. BASKIN: Well, to me it's -- the interesting\nthing about this case is the Court has itself considered\nthese very questions that you're raising and you have\nanswered them, and you do not need to revisit them to --\nto come out with the conclusion that the NLRB has either\nmisinterpreted the standard or that the standard is\nunworkable.\nQUESTION: Well, but I -- I have -- I have the\nsame question that I think underlies Justice Breyer's\nconcern. You would seem to give zero weight to the\nboard's interest in stopping a purely retaliatory suit.\nThe board says, now, you have organized this clerical unit\nand if -- if you persist in your union activity, we're\ngoing to sue you for the way you've been keeping our\nbooks. We're going to sue you for malpractice, blah,\nblah, blah, blah. And so long as there's any basis for\nthe suit, they can do that in your -- or am I misstating\nyour view?\nMR. BASKIN: Well, only in one respect. It has\nto have an objective basis. We are not here defending\nsham litigation, baseless litigation.\nQUESTION: Well, I suppose there's always abuse\nof process if there's -- but if there's some basis, then\nyou can use it specifically to retaliate.\nMR. BASKIN: More than some. It must be\nreasonable basis. And yes, yes.\nQUESTION: You can specifically use it to\nretaliate.\nMR. BASKIN: The Court -- this Court has said\nthat if there is an objective basis, that means it's a\nmeritorious lawsuit. Then there may also be a motivation\nof retaliation. Weighty, countervailing considerations.\nQUESTION: But -- but we're talking -- we're\ntalking in -- in the labor context.\nMR. BASKIN: Yes.\nQUESTION: And you lose the suit. So, there's\n-- you do not -- you're not the prevailing party in the\nsuit. And you -- you lose on the merits. There's nothing\nthe board can do about it if you've done it specifically\nto retaliate and for no other purpose.\nMR. BASKIN: If it is a reasonable, meritorious\nsuit, as this Court has defined it, where the right of\naccess to a court is too important to be called an unfair\nlabor practice solely on the ground that what is sought in\nthe court is to enjoin employees from exercising a\nprotected right because of the First Amendment to the\nConstitution, the right to petition the courts with a\nmeritorious lawsuit.\nQUESTION: But the First Amendment argument goes\nby the boards once the case is over.\nMR. BASKIN: No, Your Honor, because -- for the\nsame reasons that the Court held in Professional Real\nEstate. The employer has the right not to be second\nguessed with 20/20 hindsight as long as it had a\nreasonable basis for the suit.\nQUESTION: Yes, but that ignores the fact that\nwe're not concerned solely with chilling; we're also\nconcerned with retaliation. And if we didn't have the\nretaliatory character of the lawsuit involved, I would\nthink you would have a much stronger argument as you just\nmade it. But the retaliation is there and I don't see how\nwe can accept your -- in effect, your chilling argument\nwithout ignoring the retaliatory character.\nMR. BASKIN: Because the employers are being\nchilled and, in effect, the retaliation --\nQUESTION: Well, they're being chilled in -- in\nengaging in retaliation for the exercise of statutory\nrights.\nMR. BASKIN: But there's actually less\nretaliation that's going to take place once the suit is\ncompleted. If that were the standard, then the board\nshould be instructed to intervene sooner to keep the\nemployees from having to spend more money to defend\nthemselves.\nQUESTION: And the -- the answer to that, it\nseems to me, is set out in the cases. We've got a --\nwe've got a federalism interest in letting the State\ncourts at least adjudicate their cases. So, that's the\nanswer to that objection.\nMR. BASKIN: Well, here there's even a more\ncompelling interest. You have two statutes, Federal\nstatutes, that the employer was invited to file lawsuits\nunder.\nQUESTION: All right. Let's go back then to the\n-- to the difference between the two Federal statutes.\nThe premise of Justice Breyer's question a moment ago\naccepted the ambiguity. If we are not that indulgent and\nif we read Bill Johnson's the way Justice Ginsburg read it\n-- and I will be candid to say I read it -- number one,\nthe ambiguity does not leap out at us.\nAnd number two, I'd like to go back to Justice\nGinsburg's question. Even if we assume there was\nambiguity at the beginning, we have had 20 years of board\npractice which seems to me to have dissipated any\nambiguity. What's your response to that?\nMR. BASKIN: Well, the ambiguity was in the\nopinion that led the board to take an erroneous view --\nQUESTION: That's right I believe, and the board\nhas made it very clear how the board is reading it, and\nafter 20 years, we've got a pretty clearly settled body of\nlaw, haven't we?\nMR. BASKIN: Well, a settled body of erroneous\nlaw. And is that what the Court --\nQUESTION: And we're interpreting statutes --\nthe -- the settled body is clear and Congress is\napparently quite agreeable to it.\nMR. BASKIN: Well, first, the Court has said you\ndon't defer -- that -- that you can't read anything into\ncongressional inaction, particularly when it has taken\nthis long before the board ruling really was definitive.\nAnd it has taken that long. The issue has been in doubt\nfor most of that 20-year period.\nBut the -- going beyond that, the -- the\nboard --\nQUESTION: I don't understand that. Why do you\nsay it's been in doubt for most of the 20-year period?\nMR. BASKIN: Because it's been in doubt. Cases\nlike this one have been taking a long time to wind their\nway through the process. At each step, the board said,\nwell, we think that it -- there -- it was contested, as\nthe board said --\nQUESTION: You mean it has been contested\nconstantly during that --\nMR. BASKIN: Yes.\nQUESTION: -- 20 -- 20-year period?\nMR. BASKIN: Absolutely.\nQUESTION: Has the board ever taken a different\nposition in the 20-year period?\nMR. BASKIN: There have been dissents, but no,\nthe board has generally taken a consistent view.\nQUESTION: So, the board's position has been\nclear for 20 years.\nMR. BASKIN: Yes, but the board --\nQUESTION: The board is slow. It may take the\n-- the cases may be in wending their way through.\nMR. BASKIN: But the board is not entitled to\ndeference in its interpretation of the U.S. Constitution\nor of this Court's decision. And that's all that we're\ntalking about here is the board's interpretation of the\nConstitution and this Court's opinion. It's not\ninterpreting the statute.\nQUESTION: I think we're not raising -- I think\nJustice Ginsburg's question and my question is not so much\ngeared to an issue of deference. We're -- we're trying to\n-- to get at the -- what seems to us the fact that the law\nhas become settled. It may require no deference. It may\nhave become settled because an administrative agency was\ninterpreting what you think was an ambiguous opinion of\nthis Court in the first place. But it seems to have\nbecome settled.\nAnd there is a good reason, which underlies\nultimately our -- our approach to stare decisis in\nstatutory cases, for letting settled statutory\nunderstandings stayed settled unless the legislative\nbranch wants to change them. And that's the argument\nwe're getting at, not deference.\nMR. BASKIN: Well, it is -- stare decisis is a\nform of deference, and we're talking about stare decisis\nwould apply to the Court's own opinion. Only this Court\nis required to defer to itself about its own opinion.\nYour -- and so that's why we are talking about deference,\nI would submit. At least I interpret your question as\nasking should you stick with what the board has come up\nwith. This Court has not ruled on --\nQUESTION: I'm saying that --\nMR. BASKIN: -- on Bill Johnson's since Bill\nJohnson's.\nQUESTION: I'm saying that in -- as -- as your\nown answers indicate, for 20 years there seems to have\nbeen a -- a settled practice on the part of the board\nwhich at best is not inconsistent with our opinion. Why\nshouldn't we let a settled statutory regime stay settled\nunless the legislative branch wants to change it?\nMR. BASKIN: I contest that it's a settled\nstatutory regime, that we are dealing with a First\nAmendment right, and that the board's outcome, which it\nhas taken this long to reach back to the court, is wrong\nunder the First Amendment. It has proved to be unworkable\nand it subjects employers to the impossible situation in\nfuture cases and in cases going on right now that they are\nexpected to have 100 percent certainty of the outcome.\nIndeed, the -- the board could, under this\nstandard, say that you can win a jury verdict, go -- have\nit upheld by the district court, only to be reversed by an\nappeals court, and still be found under this Court's\nstandard to be nonmeritorious and you lose. You have --\nyou have violated the law.\nQUESTION: If there's a retaliatory motive.\nMR. BASKIN: If there's a retaliatory motive.\nAnd that's all it takes. There's a retaliatory motive.\nYou go through all of that based on an attack on your\nbusinesses, which is why employers tend to file these\nlawsuits. They don't like lawyers that much, don't want\nto spend the money to do it, but they're under attack.\nBE&K was under attack in every conceivable forum.\nQUESTION: But, I mean, that's a normal problem,\nisn't it, with the labor statutes and most other statutes.\nIt forbids retaliatory behavior. Of course, you'll have\ncases where people make the wrong decision about it, where\nit's hard to predict, and so forth. But that's the\ngeneral situation.\nMR. BASKIN: Well --\nQUESTION: We're trying to carve out a -- an\nexception where you're home free from that.\nMR. BASKIN: Well, no, it's the board that's\ncarving out an exception from the basic First Amendment\nprotection that this Court has recognized already.\nQUESTION: Mr. Baskin, that -- that goes back\nevery time to how you construe this paragraph, and so if\nthe position that Justice White is making a distinction\nhere between, on the one hand, an ongoing proceeding --\nthe First Amendment says you can't stop it. Never mind\ndeference to State courts. That's another consideration\nthat weighs it to the same end, but traditionally under\nthe First Amendment, a prior restraint, stop it, has been\nwhat the Court has looked at most cautiously. Then\nJustice White tells us, but it's different once the\nadjudication is over.\nThe -- the line between prior restraint and\nsubsequent punishment goes all the way through First\nAmendment learning, and you treat this as, well,\nambiguous, but if it were clear it's that there's any\ndifference between stopping an ongoing proceeding and\nlooking at a situation after it's been adjudicated?\nMR. BASKIN: There -- there can be a difference,\nmainly the difference of having more facts, having an\noutcome in front of the board at that point. And what the\nCourt wanted to get across -- the issue in front of the\nCourt in Bill Johnson's was don't interfere with an\nongoing lawsuit. We don't know how it's going to turn\nout.\nAll right. Once it turns out, if it's without\nmerit -- meritorious -- I'd just invite the Court to look\nat each use of the word meritorious in the Bill Johnson's\nopinion. You will regrettably find some inconsistencies\nnot only internally but with other opinions of this Court\nboth before Bill Johnson's and after. You have the\nopportunity to clarify the law now in a way that is very\nstraightforward under the Professional Real Estate\nInvestors test.\nIf there are no other questions, I'd like to\nreserve the remainder of my time for rebuttal.\nQUESTION: Very well, Mr. Baskin.\nMr. Wallace, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE G. WALLACE\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. WALLACE: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and\nmay it please the Court:\nThe board and the courts of appeals have had no\ndifficulty in reading Bill Johnson's the way I think most\npeople would read this Court's opinion as comprehensively\naddressing what the board was doing with respect to the\nunfair labor practice under section 8(a)(1) of the filing\nof --\nQUESTION: Mr. Wallace.\nMR. WALLACE: -- retaliatory lawsuits.\nQUESTION: Mr. Wallace, when I ask you a\nquestion, please stop.\nMR. WALLACE: I didn't hear you. I'm sorry.\nQUESTION: Well, listen a little more closely.\nDo you disagree with Mr. Baskin's contention\nthat the word meritorious is used inconsistently in the\npart of Bill Johnson's that we're talking about?\nMR. WALLACE: I do disagree with that, and --\nand no court of appeals that has reviewed board decisions\nsince Bill Johnson's has read it that way. The Court\nquite clearly distinguished between enjoining ongoing\nlawsuits, which it said could be done only if the lawsuit\nwas baseless. Otherwise, the board has to wait until the\nlawsuit has been resolved. If the lawsuit turned out\nfavorably to the employer, then it could not be an unfair\nlabor practice. But if the lawsuit turned out to be\nunmeritorious, if the employer lost, then the board could\nconsider whether it was filed for a retaliatory purpose.\nQUESTION: It did say that, but of course, that\nwas not the situation before the Court. I mean, it -- it\nmay be the clearest dictum in the world. It may be the\ndictum closest to a holding possible, but it is still\ndictum. The Court did not have before it a case in which\nthe employer had already brought the suit and had lost.\nNow, you know, it said what would happen in that\nsituation, and you know, I think that's entitled to some\nweight. But the issue that your opponent wants to argue\nhere is whether the Court was wrong to say that.\nMR. WALLACE: I beg to differ. The Court\nspecifically noted that some of the claims of the employer\nhad already been dismissed in the State courts, and in\nfootnote 15, at the end of the -- its opinion, it said the\nboard, therefore, can use the criteria we --\nQUESTION: But those cases were not before them.\nIt said what the board can do in those cases that are not\nnow before us. As I say, it may be a dictum that is the\nvery next thing to a holding, but it is not a holding.\nThose were not cases that the Court had in front of it.\nMR. WALLACE: It -- it was a direction for how\nfurther proceedings in the case should be handled.\nQUESTION: Exactly, as many dicta are. As many\ndicta are, and we do not always observe those directions\nwhen we -- when we have the opportunity to examine the\nmatter in a -- in a more immediate context.\nMR. WALLACE: In any event, if I may turn now to\naddress the question that the Court asked the parties to\naddress in formulating the question presented here. Our\nsubmission in this case is that this Court's holding in\nProfessional Real Estate Investors interpreting the\nantitrust laws and the Court's decision in Bill Johnson's,\nincluding this -- these dicta to govern further\nproceedings interpreting the National Labor Relations Act,\nare entirely compatible with one another in light of the\nimportant differences in the purposes, processes,\nremedies, and practicalities of enforcement that were\nimplicated in the two statutory schemes at issue.\nQUESTION: Well, I -- I have one particular\ndifference in mind that I'd like you to comment on. I --\nI -- it's -- it seems to me that what is sought to be done\nhere is much worse as far as the independence of the\ncourts and the guarantee of access to the courts by -- by\nthe citizenry is concerned than what was sought to be done\nin -- in -- what case -- Professional Real Estate.\nAnd this is the difference. In Professional\nReal Estate, it would have been the courts that would have\ndecided the facts which would have imposed upon the losing\nparty attorney's fees. In this situation, it is going to\nbe the Labor Board that will decide the factual question\nof whether there was a retaliatory motive, and the courts\nwill have to defer to that factual finding if there is a\nbasis in the record, whether the courts agree with it or\nnot.\nI find it quite offensive to think that Article\nIII courts are going to be told that certain people who\nhave come to them for relief will pay a penalty for doing\nso on the basis of a retaliatory motive found not by\nArticle III courts at all but by the labor court -- but by\nthe Labor Board. In that respect, this case is much worse\nthan -- than what was going on in -- in Professional Real\nEstate.\nMR. WALLACE: Well, the board is not\ncontradicting anything found by the courts. The question\nof retaliatory motive was not at issue in the underlying\nlitigation, and the board has to wait under this Court's\ndecision in Bill Johnson's before it addresses the\nquestion of whether there's been an unfair labor\npractice --\nQUESTION: They will address it in a proceeding\nbefore the board. They will find an unfair labor practice\non the basis of their finding of a retaliatory motive.\nAnd I -- I note, by the way, as to, you know,\nhow -- how much we can trust those -- those findings -- I\nhad one of my law clerks look up how many -- how many\ntimes the board has imposed this kind of an unfair labor\npractice penalty for -- for bringing a lawsuit. Since the\nPower Systems case in '78, which is when they started this\nprocess, they have 26 decisions ordering the employer to\npay attorney's fees incurred in defending a lawsuit and 3\ndecisions in which it -- it ordered a union to do so.\nNow, is -- is there some reason that unions are not using\nlawyers as much as companies are these days?\nMR. WALLACE: Well, the -- the cases against\nunions are much less numerous to begin with because unions\nare less apt to bring lawsuits to interfere with the\nrights of employees under section 7 for concerted\nactivity. We're talking about a retaliation against\nsection 7 rights. Usually that's been the subject of\nemployer suits, but the board does apply the same test\nwhen --\nQUESTION: There were union lawsuits in this\npresent case, weren't there? Plenty of them.\nMR. WALLACE: But those were against the\nemployer, and -- and they --\nQUESTION: But suits -- suits against the\nemployer can certainly be brought to impair the -- the\nrights of the employees not to -- not to unionize.\nMR. WALLACE: That would have to be a showing a\nviolation by the union of 8(b)(4), not -- not that the\nlawsuit was an 8(a)(1) violation against the concerted\nactivities rights of employees. The employer would have\nto show that the union lawsuit violated duties that the\nunion owes, and that was resolved against the employer on\nthe merits in this case because the -- the subject of the\nlawsuits was about working conditions at the site of\nemployment, which was a legitimate union concern.\nQUESTION: Never -- never mind the 26 to 3.\nJust -- just tell me why I -- as -- as an Article III\njudge, I should not be concerned about leaving it to a\nFederal agency to make the factual finding that will\ndetermine whether somebody will be punished for bringing a\nreasonable lawsuit, although one which ultimately loses in\nFederal courts. Why shouldn't I be concerned about that?\nMR. WALLACE: Well, this isn't punishment. It's\nmake-whole relief under an administrative scheme which is\nmeant to protect employees in the exercise of their\nconcerted rights, and it involves no contradiction of any\nissue that was before the -- the court in the underlying\nlitigation which did not have occasion to address whether\nthe suit was brought for a retaliatory purpose.\nQUESTION: Mr. Wallace, Mr. Baskin told us that\nthere are punitive aspects to this that could lead to\ndebarment he said. So, it's not simply to provide for\nfee-shifting, but that there are heavy consequences.\nMR. WALLACE: Well, the -- the case to which the\nChief Justice referred earlier, Wisconsin Department of\nIndustrial Relations against Gould, was one in which this\nCourt held that Wisconsin law was preempted, and Wisconsin\ncould not refuse to make purchases, State purchases, from\ncompanies that had been found to have violated the\nNational Labor Relations Act because the whole purpose of\nthe remedy scheme under the National Labor Relations Act\nis remedial and the remedies are limited, and the idea is\nto get labor disputes behind us, not to have disruptions\nof the economy, to keep productivity going, and to keep\nthe people employed.\nQUESTION: Well, is -- is the point of this\ncolloquy whether or not this act can be called punitive or\nthis NLRB doctrine can be called punitive? I -- I had\nthought you said that it is punitive, or am I wrong?\nMaybe you think nothing -- maybe you think nothing turns\non that.\nMR. WALLACE: Well, I -- I wouldn't think that\n-- that anything would turn on it, but it is not punitive.\nThe only remedy that's granted is a make-whole remedy that\nthe costs incurred by the prevailing defendants in a suit\nbrought for an improper motive, namely to coerce those\ndefendants in the exercise of rights granted them by\nFederal statute when suit turned out --\nQUESTION: But is there any other effect by\nvirtue of the finding of the unfair labor practice?\nMR. WALLACE: Well --\nQUESTION: I mean, true in terms of money, it's\nthe fees. Is there any other effect --\nQUESTION: -- by virtue of their finding?\nMR. WALLACE: Notice is to be posted. The cease\nand desist order issues. Those -- those parts of the\nremedy were not challenged in this case.\nQUESTION: Well, let's just talk about the make-\nwhole remedy. We held in 1982 that in a private suit for\nan unfair labor practice, which provides for making whole\nthe -- the plaintiff for -- for his damages, there was no\nauthority in the court to award attorney's fees, that\nmaking whole there did not include attorney's fees. What\n-- and -- and, you know, the language was very clear about\nthe American rule and what a -- what a change it would be.\nWhy -- why should it be any different when the unfair\nlabor practice is -- is decreed by the board rather than\nin a private action?\nIt doesn't say explicitly that you can get\nattorney's fees, just as -- just as the other -- the --\nthe private action provision didn't say explicitly. It\njust said, you know, whatever damages you have. And\ndamages were not intended to include that. Why should we\nhold any differently in this situation, especially when\nthe result is to leave it to the board to decide whether\n-- whether somebody will be punished for bringing a\nmeritorious but ultimately unsuccessful suit in Federal\ncourt?\nMR. WALLACE: Well, board proceedings are much\nless burdensome than -- than court proceedings to those\nthat are issue, and the Court held in Bill Johnson's that\nthe board remedy of recompensing the defendants who\nprevailed in this suit for their costs, because the suit\nwas brought to defeat their section 7 rights, was a\npermissible remedy by the board.\nQUESTION: We held it or -- or said it. I mean,\nthat -- that's one of the disputes here, isn't it?\nMR. WALLACE: Yes. They held it in the sense of\n-- of prescribing that rule for the further proceedings to\nbe held in that very case on remand from the Court's\norder.\nQUESTION: We're just going around the dictum\npoint again. I consider it dictum, and -- and the issue\nis whether that was a wise thing to say.\nMR. WALLACE: Well, when the Court prescribes a\nrule of that nature, the United States considers itself\nbound by it in its further handling --\nQUESTION: Yes. I'm -- I'm not criticizing you\nfor arguing the point, certainly not.\nQUESTION: Mr. Wallace, I -- do you agree that\nunder the board's rule here that it does allow the board\nto find the unfair labor practice and impose the sanctions\non litigation brought by employers that is not limited to\njust shams and abuse of process?\nMR. WALLACE: That's --\nQUESTION: It does allow the imposition of these\nthings for an employer suit that could be considered\nobjectively reasonable at the time it was brought.\nMR. WALLACE: Exactly so. That -- I thought the\nCourt made it quite clear in Bill Johnson's that as long\nas the suit was an unmeritorious one, in the sense that it\ndid not prevail, the board could afford the limited remedy\nthat's available under the act.\nQUESTION: Well, does that have the necessary\neffect of at least chilling some conduct that is protected\nby the First Amendment? I mean, it seems to me it does.\nYou have to -- you would have to concede that it does.\nMR. WALLACE: But it -- it's a far less daunting\nsituation than what the Court was faced with under the\nantitrust laws in the Professional Real Estate Investors\ncase.\nQUESTION: Mr. Wallace, isn't it correct that\nthe scope of chilling is limited to those with a\nretaliatory motive?\nMR. WALLACE: Absolutely.\nQUESTION: I thought it's where the board\nfinds --\nQUESTION: -- already chilled those cases.\nQUESTION: -- to those where the board and not\nFederal courts on their own find a retaliatory motive.\nMR. WALLACE: But, of course, the board's\nfindings are subject to judicial review.\nQUESTION: For -- so long as there's substantial\nevidence, which means -- you know.\nMR. WALLACE: Correct.\nQUESTION: All right. So --\nQUESTION: In every 8(a)(1) case, the\nretaliatory motive is found by the board. That's part of\nthe statutory proceeding, isn't it?\nMR. WALLACE: That is correct.\nQUESTION: The other parts of this statutory\nproceeding do not exclude the Federal courts from their\nbusiness, do they, which this does by imposing penalties\nupon people who come to the Federal courts?\nMR. WALLACE: Well, I think this Court's make it\nquite -- this Court's decisions make it quite clear that\nunder the National Labor Relations Act, it is board rather\nthan courts that have the responsibility of ruling about\nunfair labor practices.\nQUESTION: We agree with that and the only issue\nis whether that statutory provision places within the\nboard the power to impose this particular sanction for an\nunfair labor practice, a penalty for bringing a\nmeritorious lawsuit.\nMR. WALLACE: Well, make-whole relief --\nQUESTION: Isn't the make-whole relief simply\nthat they've said, since ours is a statute which foresees\ntaking labor disputes out of the courts and putting them\ninto the board, since that's why it was passed, we're\ngoing to say a -- a loser in a Federal lawsuit that\nviolates that basic underlying purpose has to pay\nattorney's fees to the winner? Now, is there anything\nhere other than that?\nMR. WALLACE: Not -- not at all. That's -- that\nis what is at issue, and the -- the National Labor\nRelations Act authorizes the board, under this Court's\nopinion in Bill Johnson's, to afford that kind of a\nlimited remedy --\nQUESTION: Well, isn't what --\nQUESTION: Is the courts' -- is the board's\ndefinition of a unmeritorious lawsuit simply one which --\nin which the plaintiff does not get what the plaintiff\nwants. It's thrown out of court, so to speak.\nMR. WALLACE: That's approximately it, yes, Mr.\nChief Justice.\nQUESTION: How -- how would it vary? Why do you\nuse the term approximately?\nMR. WALLACE: Well, there can -- there can be\ncases in which a voluntary dismissal was taken with\nprejudice. Sometimes the question of whether it was an\nunmeritorious suit becomes a debatable question. But\nordinarily it's one, as it was in this case, in which the\ncourts have ruled against claims that the employer made.\nQUESTION: Is -- is -- I'm sorry. Is there any\nauthority? I mean, I thought, as a matter of proposition,\nmaybe there would be some authority like a -- an\nelectricity generating regulator would have said in\ncertain kinds of lawsuits, you have to have fee-shifting.\nThe SEC might say in certain kinds of lawsuits, certain\ncompanies have to pay attorney's fees. The barbers'\nregulator might say in certain union -- or certain --\ncertain instances the barbers have to pay the legal fees\nof somebody else. Is -- is there any comparable authority\nany other place that you've found?\nIt -- it doesn't seem to me an absurd\nproposition of law or of constitutional law that a\nregulator who's in charge of a particular group of\nindividuals or businesses says in particular circumstances\nthere will be fee-shifting. But maybe that's total --\nmaybe this is the only case that's ever come up.\nMR. WALLACE: Well, we -- we didn't come up with\nanalogies in which regulatory agencies do the fee-\nshifting. There are certainly many statutes that provide\nfor fee-shifting. The Fogerty case discusses a number of\nthem.\nQUESTION: But they have to be very explicit\nbecause it's such an extraordinary thing. That's what our\njurisprudence very clearly says. And here with -- with no\nmore explicitness than there was in the case in Summit\nValley, the -- the agency is assuming the power to fee-\nshift and to make the factual determination upon which the\nfee-shifting turns. I think that's extraordinary.\nMR. WALLACE: Well, there is not a reference to\nfee-shifting as such in the National Labor Relations Act,\nbut Congress did say in section 8(a)(1) that it shall be\nan unfair labor practice to an employee to interfere with,\nrestrain, or coerce employees in the exercise of the\nconcerted activity rights for mutual aid and protection\nthat are guaranteed in section 7. And this Court in Bill\nJohnson's recognized that there had been a history of the\nuse of the courts for that purpose.\nQUESTION: Mr. Wallace --\nQUESTION: In -- in a case like this, if we have\nessentially these facts, if the finding of the board was\nis that the purpose of the employer in bringing the suit\nwas because the employer's board of directors met and they\nsay, we are being hurt in the marketplace, public opinion\nis against us, we must bring these suits to protect our\nposition in the business community, I take it that is a\nretaliatory motive.\nMR. WALLACE: Well, the retaliatory motive would\nbe -- it would have to be shown that the suit was brought\nfor the purpose of coercing, discouraging, suppressing,\nrestraining the employees in the exercise of their rights.\nQUESTION: Well, but you -- you know what I'm\ntrying -- trying to get at. The -- the union is doing\nthese to weaken the employer and the employer meets and\nsays, this is hurting our business, it's hurting us in the\nmarketplace. Is that retaliatory?\nMR. WALLACE: Well, the -- the board addresses\nthat question in light of all the circumstances of the\ncase. To the extent that the suit was not baseless in law\nor fact that the employer brought --\nQUESTION: Assume -- assume that there -- it's\nnot baseless.\nMR. WALLACE: That weighs in the employer's\nfavor. There are other factors that weigh against the\nemployer. In this --\nQUESTION: But it can be retaliatory for the\nemployer to protect its business against suits by the\nunion which are brought by the union for the motive of\nweakening the employer. That's retaliatory.\nMR. WALLACE: Well, only if the employer has\nbrought suits against the union or the employees. It\ncertainly can defend against any suit --\nQUESTION: No. It's been bringing suits in\norder to stop the other suits.\nMR. WALLACE: Well --\nQUESTION: Let -- let me ask you in a related\nvein. Maybe it's an unrelated vein. Can -- could\nCongress overrule Noerr-Pennington?\nMR. WALLACE: This Court did not indicate in any\nway that it could not reexamine, modify the rules of\nNoerr-Pennington or of Professional Real Estate. The\nCourt --\nQUESTION: In other words, Noerr-Pennington\ndoesn't have a constitutional underpinning.\nMR. WALLACE: It -- it certainly construed the\nantitrust laws in light of the fact that those laws focus\nmostly on private conduct in the marketplace, not on\npetitioning for Government-imposed restraints, and that\nthere was a need in construing them not to -- to allow\nimproper chilling of the bringing of lawsuits or other\nforms of petitioning activity.\nAnd in -- in Professional Real Estate itself,\nthe procedural posture focused on the need for summary\njudgment to be available against a counterclaim for treble\ndamages under the antitrust laws in circumstances in which\nthe counterclaimant, after the underlying copyright\ninfringement suit was found to be objectively reasonable,\nwas saying, but I still need further discovery in order to\nascertain the intent and motives of the original plaintiff\nin bringing the copyright infringement suit because it's\nmy view that -- that they didn't really expect to prevail\nand that they were bringing it for anticompetitive\npurposes.\nAnd the danger that the Court was addressing\nthere was that much of the protective quality of the Noerr\ndoctrine itself could be undermined if the original\nlawsuit that supposedly is protected could be chilled by\nthe prospect of burdensome discovery and treble damages.\nQUESTION: My -- my concern -- my concern is --\nis this, is that the First Amendment has its own\ncorrective counterspeech, but what the board has done here\nis it's defined retaliatory motive so broadly that it's\ntaken away that First Amendment corrective. And that is\nitself a distortion of First Amendment principles which\nallowed the unions to bring these suits in the first\nplace, it seems to me.\nMR. WALLACE: Well, there -- there is a very\nlimited remedy available here compared to the prospect\nthat treble damages might be awarded on the basis of\nrather unpredictable findings about subjective motivation\nin bringing the lawsuit. And it -- it -- it's a remedy\nthat's been applied against a background of what this\nCourt in Bill Johnson's referred to as a -- a powerful\ntool. Powerful was the word the Court used.\nQUESTION: Mr. Wallace, is retaliatory motive --\nis that before us in this case? I mean, it may be that\nthis Court, by saying that the board -- that there was,\neven in this case, insufficient evidence of retaliatory\nmotive, but I didn't think that was the question presented\nhere.\nMR. WALLACE: I agree with you on that point,\nJustice Ginsburg.\nQUESTION: Because on that, I was going to ask\nyou, well, what is it that shows that this was in\nretaliation for violation of section 7 rights instead of\nbeing in -- in response to the union's desire simply to\nharass the employer? I think that there are very serious\nquestions about that, but my view was of this case that --\nthat wasn't before us.\nMR. WALLACE: I -- I agree with you completely.\nIn fact --\nQUESTION: I take it -- I take it the background\nof this case is that there was a finding of retaliatory\nmotive and we have to make our decision based upon the way\nthe board interprets retaliatory motive in cases such as\nthis.\nMR. WALLACE: Well, it's certainly part of the\nbackground of the case, but the Court did limit the grant\nof certiorari to whether these two decisions are\ncompatible given the differences between the two acts.\nQUESTION: And we have to defer both to the\nboard's determination of what constitutes a retaliatory\nmotive and, even more so, to the board's factual\ndetermination that retaliatory motive existed. All it\ntakes is one witness who says it existed, and that would\nconstitute substantial evidence. And if the board goes\nwith that witness, the courts have to effectively penalize\nthe company for seeking resort in the courts.\nMR. WALLACE: Well, there is seldom direct\nevidence of that kind, although occasionally there is\ndirect evidence of animus in the bringing of the suit.\nBut the board has relied on a number of factors, which\nwe've set out on page 47 of our brief, in various -- in\nvarious cases in seeing retaliatory motive. In this case\none of the more persuasive ones was that the lawsuit was\nbrought against parties that the plaintiff knew or should\nhave known did not participate in the allegedly unlawful\nconduct. They included as defendants unions that had\nnot --\nQUESTION: That's an issue that was raised by\nquestion 3 of the cert petition, and we didn't grant it.\nMR. WALLACE: That's correct. That's correct.\nThe -- the petition --\nQUESTION: But -- but --\nMR. WALLACE: -- was about the compatibility of\nthe Court's decision in Professional Real Estate with what\nwe had taken to be the Court's clear prescription of the\nlimits on the remedy of the 8(a)(1) and unfair labor\npractice in the Bill Johnson's case.\nQUESTION: Mr. Wallace, we are concerned with\nthe Bill Johnson's case, and a question has been raised\nabout where does the authority to come -- come from for\nthis fee-shifting. It does appear in the Court's opinion\nin Bill Johnson's. If a violation is found, the board may\norder the employer to reimburse the employees, whom he has\nwrongfully sued, for their attorney's fees. Where did the\nCourt come up with that fee-shifting? Was that something\nthat the board had been doing? Did the Government propose\nit? But it's right there in the Court's of opinion that\nthe proper remedy is fee-shifting.\nMR. WALLACE: Precisely so. But the board had\nbeen doing it regardless of the merits of the underlying\nlawsuit. The board had become so concerned with the use\nof the courts for retaliatory litigation that whether the\nlawsuit was meritorious or not, if it found that it was\nbrought for the purpose of defeating section 7 rights, it\nwas awarding fees. And the Court said, no, wait a minute.\nYou can't do that and you can't enjoin lawsuits that are\nnot baseless. The Court was really correcting the board\nand reining in that remedy in a way that the board has\ncomplied with.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Wallace.\nMr. Baskin, you have 4 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MAURICE BASKIN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. BASKIN: Thank you, Your Honor. I would\njust briefly like to address the question of retaliatory\nmotive, but only as I understood the Justices' questions\nto be does it suffice alone so that they -- the board can\nrightly ignore the question of the objective basis. And\n-- and the reason it does not suffice, among others, is\nperhaps looking at the 26 decisions Justice Scalia found,\nthere's only one among them where there was no finding of\nretaliatory motive and there only because it was found\nthat the action didn't relate in any way to the union\nactivity.\nQUESTION: There was only one -- one where what?\nMR. BASKIN: Where there was no finding, where\nthe board found no retaliatory motive. It found against\nthe employers 25 out of 26 times. Once it found that the\nemployer had lost the lawsuit, automatically according to\nthe board, no merit. Even though they had all the best\ncircumstances leading up to the loss, they lost. No\nmerit.\nThen the board proceeds to the retaliatory\nmotive step supposedly going to protect employers, and all\nthey say is does it relate to union activity. Well, if it\nrelates, except for one case where it didn't, boom, you\nlose. The employers lose.\nAnd what the result of that is, is that no\nemployer can go to court if any sort of protected activity\nis even arguably involved because even if you convene a\npanel of experts, as BE&K did in this case, and go as far\nas you can to make sure you are not trampling on any\nemployee rights, if you go to court, you will be found to\nhave violated the law unless you can say with 100 percent\ncertainty that you're going to win. And no one can say\nthat.\nQUESTION: I didn't know -- as long as you're\nfinished, I thought the 26 cases were 26 cases in which\nthey awarded attorney's fees.\nMR. BASKIN: No. 26 cases with attorney's fees\nplus, attorney's fees --\nQUESTION: All right. Now, I thought they\nweren't supposed to award attorney's fees or anything\nunless there was a retaliatory motive.\nMR. BASKIN: Yes. The board found retaliatory\nmotive.\nQUESTION: All right. No, but I mean, of course\nthey did. I mean, how many cases where there where people\nalleged retaliatory motive and they found the opposite?\nMR. BASKIN: In the 26 cases --\nQUESTION: No. Those are the ones where they\nwon. How many did they lose? I mean, I don't understand\nthis 26 case business. I thought the 26 cases were the\nones that they awarded it in, and I thought they were only\nsupposed to award it where it's retaliatory. So, it's\nhardly surprising it's retaliatory.\nMR. BASKIN: No. As I understood Justice\nScalia, and frankly our own research, is these are 26\ncases that reached the board where the board could have\ngone either way, and every time, except for the one, they\nfound no merit and retaliatory motive. And they did so\nalmost automatically because of their misreading of a\nprinciple. We say a misreading. But either way, it's a\nbad principle.\nQUESTION: Well, when you say the board could\nhave gone either way, you don't mean that you know the\nevidence and that, in fact, on the evidence, the board\ncould have gone either way. You simply mean that it's a\ncase in which if the evidence showed there was\nretaliation, they could award the fees, and if the\nevidence did not show retaliation, they couldn't award the\nfees. Right?\nMR. BASKIN: The 26 cases are --\nQUESTION: So, all we know is that in those\ncases, they found retaliatory motive. We don't know that\nthey're wrong.\nMR. BASKIN: Yes, that's -- that's what we know.\nThey found retaliatory motive. And the limited point that\nI'm making here at the end is that this retaliatory motive\nidea is no more -- not enough protection under the NLRA\njust as it is not enough protection -- and you've already\nfound it to be not enough protection -- under the\nantitrust laws. And that's why the Professional Real\nEstate standard is the correct standard and it's the only\none that protects employers' rights under the First\nAmendment.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:
