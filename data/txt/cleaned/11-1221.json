RUTTENBERG\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. RUTTENBERG: Mr. Chief Justice, and may\nit please the Court:\nCongress intentionally designed FEGLIA so\nthat the Federal interest ends once the insurance\nproceeds are paid out. FEGLIA was established to enable\nFederal employees to carry out their responsibilities to\ntheir families.\nAnd Congress knew that some of its employees\nwould get divorced, and it was depending upon State laws\nto help make sure that these family duties and\nobligations were carried out, because Congress doesn't\nwant to get into the -- the business of regulating the\ndivorce.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why did it make an\nexception then only for divorce decrees?\nMR. RUTTENBERG: Justice -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, there is an express\nexception in the statute that the beneficiary can be\nchanged by a decree of divorce.\nMR. RUTTENBERG: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Now, why would Congress say\nthat while at the same time believing that the\nbeneficiary can effectively be changed without a decree\nof divorce?\nMR. RUTTENBERG: Justice Scalia, because\nCongress knew that one of the main purposes behind\nFEGLIA was to help the insureds or enable the insureds\nto carry out responsibilities to their families.\nAnd that is a mechanism to help do that, but\nit wasn't -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But it's written -- but\nit's written in such precise terms, it must be\nincorporated in a divorce decree, and the decree must be\nfiled with the employee agency pre-death. What you're\nsaying is this specific exception, rightly cabined, is\ngeneralized so that in all cases, the second wife will\nprevail over the first.\nMR. RUTTENBERG: Justice Ginsburg, I believe\nthat the requirements that it get filed in -- it being a\ndivorce decree and it get filed before death, are an\nexample of Congress intending to preempt the field of\ninterference with the FEGLI plan.\nIt -- Congress did this in several\noccasions. If you wanted to do a beneficiary\ndesignation, you have to do it before -- in order for it\nto be honored, it's got to be filed before death. The\nsame thing with an assignment. An irrevocable\nassignment has to be done before death.\nThese are all examples of Congress saying we\ndon't want States interfering with the administration of\nFEGLIA plans, but I don't think it is a statement that\nCongress is saying we don't want States to regulate\ndomestic relations when it comes to FEGLI benefits.\nThe -- the intent of Congress with regard to\nFEGLI benefits needs to be gained from a review of the\nentire statute of FEGLIA.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Why should it be\ndifferent than the outcome in Wissner and Ridgway and\none -- one case that you cite quite often is the\nHisquierdo case for -- you -- you cite it for deference\nto State domestic relations law, but what was the\noutcome in that case?\nMR. RUTTENBERG: The outcome in that case\nwas the preemption prevailed in that case. I -- I was\nciting the -- the case of Hisquierdo because I think it\nvery well lays out the presumption against preemption of\nfamily law. And -- and while that presumption can be\novercome, as it was in Ridgway, and as it was in\nHisquierdo, it -- it still is there.\nAnd it's -- it's a statement that Congress\ngenerally is not looking to regulate divorce. Not that\nCongress can't do it when it wants to, but that this\nCourt normally starts its analysis assuming that\nCongress didn't intend to do that, unless they find\ndirect -- a direct enactment saying this is -- we want\nto preempt all other State laws.\nThat -- that was the -- the purpose behind\nciting Hisquierdo. But to answer your first question -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But, you know, the -- the\nexception suggests another thing besides the fact that\nit suggests that the only way the second spouse prevails\nis by a divorce decree. It also suggests that\nCongress's sole purpose -- that Congress did not have\nthe sole purpose in this statute to make it easy for the\ninsurance company that has to pay out the proceeds to\nknow whom the -- who the beneficiary will be.\nIf that were the case, there wouldn't be\nthis exception for a divorce decree, because the\ninsurance company is going to have to look to see if\nthere's a divorce decree on the books, blah, blah, blah,\nblah, blah. That obviously shows that Congress in this\nstatute not only had a concern about efficiency of\npayment, but also had a concern about who gets the\npayment, right?\nThere's no other way to explain the -- the\nexception for divorce decrees.\nMR. RUTTENBERG: Well, the exception for\ndivorce decrees I would analogize to the Rose case, when\nthis case was -- when this Court was addressing\nveterans' benefits. And in the Rose case, this Court\ndistinguished Ridgway and Wissner, because the purpose\nbehind the Veterans' Benefits Statute this Court\ndetermined was in part to take care of the veterans'\nfamilies and it looked at -- it looked at the text.\nIt looked at the Senate report that said\nthat, but it also looked at the text. And the text had\nin Rose a -- a provision which said the Veterans\nAdministration can apportion a part of those benefits\nfor the benefit of the noncustodial children. And it\nwas argued in that case that that's Congress's statement\nthat this is the only exception and further exceptions\nshouldn't be applied and Congress was trying to regulate\nthis area.\nBut this Court said that's not what Congress\nwas doing there. That was Congress showing that they\ncared about -- that those benefits were there to help\ntake care of the family members. And FEGLIA is the same\nway.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What -- what was the\nissue? What was the issue in Rose?\nMR. RUTTENBERG: In Rose, there was\nveterans' benefits and those -- he was being sued in\nState court for enforcement of child support and those\nwere his only assets.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Now, they were taking\nthem from him to support his family.\nMR. RUTTENBERG: Correct.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Which is quite something\ndifferent. This is taking it from the designated\nbeneficiary and giving it to somebody who isn't\ndesignated.\nMR. RUTTENBERG: That's correct, Your Honor.\nBut I -- I think when you look at the purpose, the\nstated purpose of FEGLIA, which is to help insureds\ncarry out their responsibilities to their families -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And you think that's the -\nthat's the purpose of this exception for divorce\ndecrees?\nMR. RUTTENBERG: I think that -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: In your experience, a man\nusually has more children or children in his second\nmarriage than he did in his first?\nMR. RUTTENBERG: No, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No, I don't think so,\neither. I -- I think if Congress was concerned about\nmoney for the kids, it would have left the money with\nthe first wife.\nMR. RUTTENBERG: I think what Congress was\ndoing is Congress was making a statement -- I don't\nthink they were trying to say they were looking at this\ndivorce law in particular. I think what Congress was\nsaying is that: We're just going to look to the States\nand let the States use their benefit and wisdom to\ndetermine which divorce laws should apply and which\nshouldn't apply.\nSo that in this case in particular, there -\nthere are benefits and detriments possibly to section D,\nbut what this Court I think would be appropriate to do\nwould to -- to pass a bright-line rule that said State\nlaws that interfere with the administration of a plan\nare preempted, but after that, after the money has been\npaid out, laws that affect the benefits are not\npreempted, and that -- that allows the States to\nbe -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: In other words, they're\npreempted, but the whole purpose of the preemption can\nbe thwarted.\nMR. RUTTENBERG: Justice Kennedy, it's not\nthe purpose of the preemption. Section D was a response\nto this Court's opinion in Egelhoff. And at first blush\nit looks like, especially with the language, that that's\nwhat the States are trying to do, trying to end run\npreemption.\nBut that -- when you look at it closely,\nthat's not what was going on. In -- in Egelhoff, this\nCourt found that Congress intended to preempt a\nWashington statute very similar to section A, but what\nCongress was preempting was a State interfering with the\nadministration of the plan. It wasn't preempting a\nState domestic relations equitable remedy designed to\nprotect the people to whom the Federal employee owed a\nduty of support.\nIt wasn't that -- that the States were not\nlistening to Congress or this Court, and they're not\nsticking their fingers in their ears going la, la, la, I\ncan't hear you. A good example of this would be if a\nState had a estimated tax payment law that said when you\nget insurance, you've got to pay 10 percent into the\ncourt or into the State, that wouldn't be preempted.\nBut if the State thereafter had a law, enacted a law\nthat said we want a withholding requirement and if that\nmoney is withheld then you don't have to do the\nestimated tax payment, well, that would clearly be\npreempted because it interferes with the administration\nof the plan. But the first law would still be fine. It\nshouldn't per se be preempted because it enacted the\nsecond law that is preempted because it's interfering\nwith the administration -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Once again, the divorce\nexemption blows away that -- that explanation, that all\nCongress is concerned about is efficient administration\nof the plan so long as the insurer will know. You know,\njust look at the -- look at the -- at the contract, the\nnamed beneficiary, pay the money to the named\nbeneficiary, and you're home free. That -- that is\nblown away by the exception for divorce decrees. The\ninsurer is going to have to check that there hasn't been\na divorce since the contract was signed, right?\nMR. RUTTENBERG: Well, they're -- they're\nnot going to have to check unless it's been properly\nfiled, but -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. They have to check\nto see if it has been properly filed, right?\nMR. RUTTENBERG: Yes, yes. But the Federal\nGovernment has no -- it -- there is no interest that the\nFederal Government would have in saying that a divorce\ndecree that was properly filed has -- should be -\nshould be honored, but one that hasn't been properly\nfiled shouldn't be. They want State laws there.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But -- but quite apart\nfrom -- from that, it -- it seems to me that under your\nproposal the Congress would actually have accepted a\nsituation where one spouse sues a former spouse. In\nother words, you have a -- that's the whole design of\nthis statute.\nWould the insurance company -- if you were\nrepresenting the insurance company, would you tell the\ninsurance company that they were completely safe in\npaying the benefits to the first spouse even if there's\ngoing to be a suit afterwards.\nMR. RUTTENBERG: Absolutely, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Or would the insurance\ncompany itself be under some liability?\nMR. RUTTENBERG: Justice Kennedy, that's\nthe -- the whole point, is that the insurance company\nisn't -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: That's the design of the\nstatute.\nMR. RUTTENBERG: That's the design of the\nstatute.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But I'm just wondering\nwhether under State law the insurance company, if it -\nif it knows this doesn't have some duty to refrain from\nmaking the payment or to put it in escrow or to\ninterplead.\nMR. RUTTENBERG: Not at all. The statute's\nspecifically written so that the former spouse becomes\npersonally liable to the widow or whoever was entitled\nto it. It's designed to make the -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And if you're representing\nthe insurance company, you wouldn't say you better\ninterplead to be on the safe side?\nMR. RUTTENBERG: I think this Court can\nestablish the -- I think they have established under the\nKennedy case that they have a duty to pay the designated\nbeneficiary. In Kennedy, with regards to ERISA and\nwhether or -- it was very clear that the insurance -\nthe plan administrator has to pay. So I think that\nthere is no concern at all for the insurance company.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Ruttenberg, how do\nyou get to this notion that administrative convenience\nis all that is involved? After all, this is an\nemployee's life insurance and the Government is saying\nto the employee: The beneficiary is your free choice;\nyou can pick anyone, your spouse, a charity; it's your\nchoice; but we want you to know that, although you make\nit and you can change it any time you want, if you don't\nchange it that will be it.\nThat -- so it's giving, the employee,\ncontrol over the proceeds of his or her life insurance.\nWhy isn't that a purpose along with administrative\nconvenience?\nMR. RUTTENBERG: I believe that the.\nPurpose of FEGLIA was -- the other main\nstated purpose was that Congress was trying to offer\nlife insurance similar to what was being offered by\nprivate companies, and they're acting as an employer in\nthis regard. And just like with private group life\ninsurance, most people think that the beneficiary\ndesignations are going to control where that money goes\nand -- and the same with FEGLIA.\nBut also, most everyone expects when they\nget divorced that their assets are going to be subject\nto State divorce law. And I'm not suggesting that\nCongress wasn't concerned with employees carrying out\ntheir responsibilities to their families. I'm\nsuggesting Congress is using the State law. Congress\ndoesn't want to be the one that makes sure that those\nresponsibilities are carried out. They're relying on\nState law and they've developed a scheme that allows\nState law to help make sure those duties are carried\nout.\nJUSTICE ALITO: If an insured, after making\na designation of a beneficiary, writes a will and leaves\nthe insurance proceeds to a different person, the\nFederal law would still, as interpreted by the State\nSupreme Court, require the money to be paid to the\ndesignated beneficiary, wouldn't it?\nMR. RUTTENBERG: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE ALITO: And what does that say about\nCongress's supposed desire to ensure that the money goes\nto the person that the insured wants it to go to?\nMR. RUTTENBERG: Well, Justice Alito, after\nthe money has been paid out in a case like that, it is\npossible that there are State laws involved that -- that\nwould allow someone to have a suit, institute a suit\nagainst who received that. But Congress doesn't want\nOPM or MetLife to have anything to do with that. They\njust want OPM and MetLife to be able to do the job of\npaying out.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, the point is if\nCongress's objective, if one of its objectives in\naddition to administrative convenience was to effectuate\nthe will of the insured, then I don't see why it would\nprovide for Federal law to override a subsequent will\nwhich directly expresses the desire of the insured.\nMR. RUTTENBERG: I don't think FEGLIA says\nthat. What it says is -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You would agree with\nthat? I assume you would agree with what Justice Alito\njust said?\nMR. RUTTENBERG: Yes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: That it has only to do\nwith administrative convenience?\nMR. RUTTENBERG: Well, I don't want to say\nthat it has only to do with that. That's one of the -\nthe -- that's the reason, though, that everything ends\nonce the benefits are paid out.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Why should this scheme be\ntreated differently than the National Service Life\nInsurance and the successor law in Wissner and Ridgway?\nThose operated the same way. They said the person who\ndesignates says who gets it and if you -- the only way\nyou can change it is to have a change of beneficiary\nform filed with your employer; if you don't do that,\nwhatever you've said is where the money goes.\nMR. RUTTENBERG: There's -- there's a -- you\nhave to compare the FEGLIA and the SGLIA to get the\nintent of Congress. You want to -- this Court should\nlook at the text of FEGLIA and it should look at the\nlegislative history, and there's five main differences I\ncan point to which suggest that Congress intended\nsomething different.\nThe first is that FEGLIA doesn't have an\nanti-attachment provision.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But the two decisions\nthat dealt with the anti-attachment, they gave that as\nan alternative ground of decision. It was quite\nseparate and discrete from saying what's on the\nbeneficiary, the designation that controls. And they\nsay, and also there's this anti-attachment.\nMR. RUTTENBERG: Absolutely, Your Honor.\nBut when it did the holding regarding the order of\nprecedence, it didn't just look at the order of\nprecedence. It looked at all of SGLIA and it looked at\nthe differing provisions, and one of the provisions I\nthink that indicates Congress's intent in SGLIA is the\nanti-attachment provision.\nSo if the second holding was not there at\nall with regards strictly to the anti-attachment\nprovision, Ridgway still would have held the way it held\nbecause it was looking at all of SGLIA.\nBut that's not the only difference. There's\nalso the divorce provision which they have in Federal\ngroup life insurance and they -- they didn't put that\ninto the servicemen's group life. They let FEGLIA\npeople assign their benefits. There's a limited express\npreemption provision in FEGLIA which they didn't feel\nwas needed in SGLIA. And when you -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: In -- in your briefs in\nthis case, you put in the assignment provision as -- as\nan afterthought. I think you did not put it in your\nmain brief. It came up only in your reply brief, and\nyou didn't put it in the appendix to your main brief.\nMR. RUTTENBERG: That's correct, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So you -- you seem to\nassign lesser importance to it.\nMR. RUTTENBERG: I do assign less importance\nto the assignment provision than I would to the -- the\nlack of an anti-attachment provision or the -- the\ndivorce provision or the express preemption provision or\neven the legislative history. But I do still think that\nit is a factor to be looked at.\nAnd in this case, again pointing to the Rose\ncase, in the Rose case, they were dealing with the same\nanti-attachment provision in Rose and even there\ndetermined that Congress did not intend that those\ndollars should be kept away from the -- the family\nmembers in that case.\nSo I would again analogize that to this\ncase, because in the Rose case, they specifically\ndistinguished those two cases on those grounds.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I keep -- I keep coming\nback to the explicit divorce provision, which says when\nthere's a divorce decree, only properly filed, it,\nwithout a change by the beneficiary, goes to the new\nwife, okay. And you're telling us that even without a\ndivorce decree, the new wife will effectively get the\nmoney so long as there is a State law that says all -\nall proceeds from insurance companies for policies\nentered into before the -- before the -- the decedent\nwas divorced will go to the new wife.\nIt seems to me that is such a -- such a\nblatant frustration of the -- not just the purpose of -\nof the very text of the divorce provision in the law,\nwhich says only if there is a decree properly filed will\nit go to the new wife. And you're saying, well, it\ndoesn't really matter so long as there's a State law\nwhich says it will go to the new wife without a -- you\nknow.\nMR. RUTTENBERG: There -- there are two -\ntwo points I'd like to make there. One, I don't think\nCongress was trying to get involved in the field of\ndivorce. I don't think Congress with that law was\nsaying all other domestic relations laws don't apply, we\nonly want to apply these laws. There's so many other\ndomestic relations laws like community property rights\nand waivers. And children even in these divorce\ndecrease can't file it, and then children would lose out\nif their parents didn't know enough to file those\nthings. So, the first point is that I don't think that\nthat's what Congress was trying to do there with that\nprovision.\nAnd the second point is that it's not a\nsuperfluous provision. If I had a divorce decree, I\nwould much rather file it with the court so that I knew\nit would get paid directly to me than have to deal with\nit after it's been paid out. So I think it is -- it\nabsolutely serves a purpose, but it doesn't serve the\npurpose of trying to -- to get -- I think Congress was\ntrying to make a statement, we want these benefits to be\nsubject to State laws, not that we want these\nbenefits -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So why not just say\nthat? If that was Congress's intent, why limit it to a\nspecific form of State borders involving divorce,\nannulment, et cetera? Why not just simply say in 80 -\n80705(e) that any court order could change the order of\nprecedence, if that was Congress's intent?\nMR. RUTTENBERG: I believe that's basically\nwhat they did, because the other type of court orders\nsuch as a waiver wouldn't make sense to put in there.\nYou -- you would not -- if I was paying attention if\nI -- if I had filed -- if I had a divorce decree that\nsaid my ex-wife waived a right to my insurance, it\ndoesn't make sense that I'd do that additional filing\nbecause that wouldn't add anything to it.\nSo Congress was saying that court orders can\n-- that direct where money goes does that. And the\nother types of laws, like community property laws or\nwaivers or this type of law, they would have to have a\nseparate section for each of them to draft it in such a\nway that it wouldn't interfere -- it would make it easy\non OPM to know where to pay the money.\nAnd I think what they were doing is they\nweren't saying any types of State laws can come in,\nbecause they didn't -- they wanted to deal with the ones\nthat were clear, that were easy for them to deal with,\nso that they -- so that OPM and MetLife knows where to\npay the money.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Ruttenberg, what\nabout the interest, which was an interest in Wissner and\nin Ridgway, of uniformity under this Federal insurance\nscheme? That is, one of the hypotheticals in the briefs\nwas: The deceased dies domiciled in Virginia. Wife No.\n1 comes from X State, not Virginia, Wife No. 2 two from\nY State, and they all have different -- different rules.\nThe employee, in the course of her career, may move\naround from here or there.\nBut if you follow the Federal law, then it's\ngoing to be the same for every employee. These are the\nrules for every employee no matter where he or she\nlives, no matter the location of the spouse. And then\nwe don't have these messy problems with choice of law.\nMR. RUTTENBERG: Congress was definitely\nconcerned with -- and -- and as, again, I keep referring\nto the Rose case because I think it worded it well -- it\nwas concerned with the uniformity of the administration\nof the policy. And they wanted OPM and MetLife to\nuniformly, no matter where anyone lived, be able to pay\nthose out.\nBut just like a private employee, people\nexpect their assets to be subject to divorce laws after\nthey're paid out. And OPM is not involved in anything\nmessy, MetLife is not involved in anything messy after\nit's paid out. They're treating them just like any\nother employee in a private company.\nAnd -- and Congress stated that the purpose,\nthe other -- there are two main purposes. The other\nmain purpose of FEGLIA was to create an insurance plan\nthat was on par with, not the special kind of insurance\nthat we're offering to servicemen. Congress with\nServicemen's Group Life took out a magic wand and said,\nwe're going to make these insurance proceeds special,\nand gave special characteristic -- characteristics to\nthe Servicemen's Group Life Insurance proceeds.\nBut they did not do that -- well, the reason they\ndid that with Servicemen's Group Life Insurance is\nbecause they wanted servicemen, no matter how much they\nmessed up their finances, to know that they could leave\nsome asset to whoever they wanted to regardless of -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why don't they just say,\nlook, if the -- if the State law says so, the -- the new\nwife gets it? Why didn't they just say that instead\nof -- you're telling me they set up this -- this sick\nsystem in which the -- the former wife or the new wife\nhas to sue the former wife to get the money that was\npaid to the former wife. I mean, my goodness. What -\nour courts are crowded with -- with suits between, you\nknow -- why -- why don't they just say, if the State law\nsays it, it goes to the new wife.\nMR. RUTTENBERG: The -- the first reason is\nbecause I don't think they wanted to try and come up\nwith every permutation of divorce law. The second\nreason, you -- you characterize this as a -- a \"sick\nlaw,\" but 48 States incorporate laws which have this\nconcept. They say: In your will, reference to your\nformer spouse are deemed -- they just haven't because\nthe nature of asset transfers in probate has developed\nover time -- not all the States have caught up; only 18\nhave.\nBut if I may reserve the rest of my time for\nrebuttal.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Johnson.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MR. STEFFEN N. JOHNSON\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. JOHNSON: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nOn two separate occasions, this Court has\nheld that order of precedence provisions like those\nfound in FEGLIA grant the insured an absolute personal\nright to, quote, \"direct that the proceeds belong to the\nnamed beneficiary and no other.\"\nIn fact, Congress enacted FEGLIA just 4\nyears after this Court's decision in Wissner, where this\nCourt held that the MISLA order of precedence was the\ncontrolling section of the Act, was forceful and clear\nin defining the scope of this Federal right, preempted\npost-distribution efforts to nullify the insured's\nchoice, quote, \"whether directed at the very money it\nreceived from the Government or an equivalent amount.\"\nAnd Ridgway, of course, extended Wissner to SGLIA, which\ncontained the very same text at issue here.\nNow, for a number of reasons we think that\nthis case is even easier than Wissner and Ridgway.\nFirst of all, we are not dealing with the generally\napplicable body of law; we are dealing with something\nthat is quite openly an attempt to do an end run on\npreemption. The only thing that triggers section D is\nbeing a former spouse and receiving the proceeds. The\nstatute doesn't make any inquiry into intent, into\nwhether there has been a tort or an independent\ncontract. It simply reallocates the proceeds. It\nsubstitutes a new beneficiary.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Of course, if the\nex-wife were in bankruptcy proceedings this money would\nnot necessarily go to her, right; it would go to the\nbankruptcy estate?\nMR. JOHNSON: It -- it might, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So -- so why is the\nState law any different -\nMR. JOHNSON: Well, Congress -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- with respect to\ndivorces?\nMR. JOHNSON: Well, one reason, Your Honor,\nis 8705(e). Congress has spoken specifically to the\nquestion of divorce in this context, and I think, as\nJustice Scalia's and Justice Sotomayor's questions\nindicate, it didn't simply say that the existence of a\ndecree or the fact of divorce would result in a change\nin who receives the proceeds. It said a very specific\ntype of divorce decree would change the result.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, my problem with this\ncase is, other than administrative convenience, I don't\nsee what purpose Congress could have thought that this\nprovision serves.\nMR. JOHNSON: Your Honor, there is certainly\nelements of administrative convenience in the statute.\nJUSTICE ALITO: What else -- what other -\nwhat other objective do you think Congress was trying to\nachieve?\nMR. JOHNSON: It was trying to provide a\nbenefit to Federal employees, and that benefit was to be\nable to provide benefits, life insurance proceeds, to\nthe person of their choice.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Why would it override the\nexpressed will of an insured in -- the express desire of\nan insured in, for example, a will that's executed after\nthe time of the assignment -\nMR. JOHNSON: In the case of -\nJUSTICE ALITO: -- and the designation of\nthe beneficiary.\nMR. JOHNSON: In the case of a will, Your\nHonor, 8705(a) makes specific provision for the filing\nof a will with the employing officer, OPM. And so\nCongress has taken account of wills and it's rejected\nthe idea of just a free-floating inquiry into intent.\nThere were -- I should add that the will language of\n8705(a) was added to the statute in 1966. There had\nbeen some lower court cases that had sort of taken this\napproach to wills contrary to the regulations that\nexisted that said the designated beneficiary provision\nshould govern. Congress rejected a free-floating\ninquiry into intent.\nJUSTICE ALITO: But why? You've got a -\nyou've got a designation of the beneficiary in 1975,\nlet's say, and then you have a will that's executed in\n2005. Why would Congress want the -- the designation of\nthe beneficiary so far in the past to override the\nexpression of the desire of the insured in the\nsubsequent will?\nMR. JOHNSON: Congress wanted a simple rule,\nand it determined that the best evidence of intent is\nthe actual naming of the beneficiary. Section D doesn't\nmake -\nJUSTICE ALITO: How can that be the best\ndesignation of intent? You have a designation long in\nthe past, then you have a will that says that: The\ninsurance proceeds I'm leaving to a different person.\nHow is the earlier designation of a beneficiary a better\nexpression of intent?\nMR. JOHNSON: Well, I think you can debate\nwhat the better policy default is, but when you have a\nlong-standing policy that says to Federal employees,\nThis is what we take account of and we give top -- top\nbilling, top priority to the naming of the\nbeneficiary -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Johnson, that -- that\nis in the OPM manual, but I think Mr. Ruttenberg pointed\nout that it's 106-some-odd pages. How are employees\ncovered by this insurance, how are they informed about\nwhat the beneficiary designation means?\nMR. JOHNSON: The simplest answer, Justice\nGinsburg, is the form itself. It's Form SF-2823. This\nform says: \"Keep your designation current. Submit a\nnew one if your intentions change, for example, due to a\nchange in family status such as marriage, divorce,\netcetera.\"\nSo it's not simply the OPM handbook. It's\nthe form itself. And this form is publicly available,\nof course, on -- on OPM's website, but also was\nsubstantially the same and contained this language at\nthe time of Warren Hillman's designation in this case.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, why do you resist -\nI'm just curious. I -- I would have thought that to\nanswer Justice Scalia you were going to say the answer\nis it isn't more accurate. If you write a will and say\nI want these proceeds now to go to my second wife, that\nis a better expression of the person's intent. But if\nyou open that door, you'll get other wills that aren't\nquite so clear, and that's the problem that Congress\nfaced.\nMR. JOHNSON: That's exactly right, Your\nHonor. And of course there is an -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Is that right?\nMR. JOHNSON: Well -- well, it is true that\nif you open the door you'll have this be problem.\nCongress wanted a clear, simple, and certain rule,\nand -- and it spoke both to the issues of wills in\n8705(a) and to the issues of divorce decrees in 8705(e).\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, that provides a\nsimple -- that provides a -- a simple rule for the\npeople who are affected by this dispute, and those are\nthe people who are -- who stand to benefit either under\nthe designation of the beneficiary or under the will.\nBut what -- why does Congress care about that? There\nare a lot of messy domestic relations issues out there\nin the States. That's what Congress was doing?\nThey said, you know, these -- that State\ndomestic relations law leads to a lot of nasty and\ndifficult disputes -- you know, Bleak House. Let's\nintervene and let's simplify this with a simple rule.\nDo you think that's what was involved here.\nMR. JOHNSON: I think that's part of what\nwas involved here. I think -- I think they wanted to\nensure uniformity for Federal employees who might work\nin different jurisdictions or move around. I think, you\nknow, you have a situation where wills are addressed in\nthe statute, divorce decrees are addressed in the\nstatute, and I would note that section D does not make\nany inquiry into intent. It's simply -- it's just an\nautomatic blunt rule that the divorce itself has the\neffect of rerouting the proceeds.\nThis Court has taken a very practical and\nrealistic approach to issues of preemption in a -- in a\nwide variety of context, just this term in the Wos case,\nwe said, the Court said, that -- that it's not simply a\nmatter of semantics. In Free v. Bland, one of this\nCourt's precedents involving U.S. savings bonds, there\nwas a dispute between the husband of the decedent, who\nhad an absolute right of survivorship under Federal laws\ngoverning the U.S. savings bond, and a son who would\nhave taken under a will, and the -- the Texas Supreme\nCourt, as the case came to it, said: We can simply\nhonor title by saying, yes, the husband does have an\nabsolute right of survivorship, but we'll order the\nhusband to reimburse the -- the estate.\nAnd this is what this Court said in\nreversing: \"Viewed realistically, the State has\nrendered the award of title meaningless. If the State\ncan frustrate the party's attempt to use the bond's\nsurvivorship provision through the simple expedient of\nrequiring the survivor to reimburse the estate, the\nState has interfered directly with the legitimate\nexercise of the power of the Federal Government.\"\nJUSTICE BREYER: If he is right, if the only\nconsideration that led Congress to make this absolute\nrule and so forth the underlying the previous holdings,\nif the only consideration were ease of administration by\nthe Federal administrator, this statute wouldn't\nundermine it. So -- so isn't that true?\nI mean, the Federal administrator writes the\ncheck to the person that's on the list. This is a\nmatter after the check gets mailed, or this doesn't\nundermine it at all; there is no problem.\nMR. JOHNSON: If the question is whether\nit's possible to comply with the mandate to pay the\nnamed beneficiary -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes. And if that were the\nonly consideration, administration, this doesn't\ninterfere with Federal administration. So in order to\nfind something to -- to interfere with, we have to\nfigure that they are trying to protect an interest like\nthe following: The person is married twice. He\nsecretly wants to leave the insurance in the name of his\nfirst wife while pretending to the second wife it was\njust an oversight.\nI mean, that's what we have to make up in\norder to -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: He's -- by the time\nthe issue comes up.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Is there anything else?\nMR. JOHNSON: In -- in many cases, Your\nHonor, the former spouse will have the care of children.\nThere are lots of reasons why one might want to leave\nbenefits to a former spouse.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, maybe we should say,\nlook, this is a statute that is absolute. There is no\ninterest. All this does is run around, without being\ntoo pejorative, it runs around the earlier cases, which\nis your basic point. It's absolute.\nMR. JOHNSON: And that would be -- and that\nwould be a short route to affirmance, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Right.\nMR. JOHNSON: This Court has spoken to\nthe -- the nature of language like this. SGLIA is\nessentially identical. Wissner in fact predates the\nadoption of FEGLIA, and so Congress had the benefit of\nthat ruling when it was deciding to enact an -- an order\nof precedence in this statute. The only real difference\nbetween the order of precedence here and the order of\nprecedence in Wissner is that the range of choice is\neven broader. Wissner -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: But I guess the question,\nMr. Johnson, is whether we just got it wrong there.\nBecause if you look at this statute, it seems -- you\nknow, if you were just doing it as a matter of first\nimpression, that what Congress wanted was a clear and\nuniform rule to allow it to pay benefits quickly and\neasily without any discussion or investigation of a\nperson's true intent.\nBut that after that, why does Congress have\nan interest any further? And if a State has a law that\nsays, really, we think the better measure of intent is\nsomething else, then we should let the States go ahead\nwith their law.\nMR. JOHNSON: It's conceivable, Your Honor,\nbut at a minimum, I think this -- this Court has said\nrepeatedly that when this Court's ruled on the meaning\nof language and -- and a similar language is adopted in\na new statute, it's given the judicial interpretation\nunless Congress says otherwise. But here -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, I guess -- I guess you\nmight -- you might respond also that, you know, it's\ncharacterized by -- by your -- your friend as a -- a\nState law having to do with -- with marriage and -- and\nso forth. Maybe.\nBut maybe it's just a State law having to do\nwith discernment of intent. And here you have a Federal\nstatute and I guess the Federal Congress's assertion of\nwhat's the best discernment of intent, in the natural\norder of things, ought to prevail over the State's\nassessment of what's -- what's the clearest expression\nof intent, right.\nI don't know why it's a family law provision\nas much as it is a provision of what the presumed intent\nof -- of a decedent is. And here the -- the Federal\nGovernment has spoken to it with respect to a Federal\nstatute, and I don't know why it isn't intruding upon\nState family law for -- for the Federal Government to -\nto assert, in its own right, intent under this statute\nis -- is determined this way.\nMR. JOHNSON: Either way, it's preemptive,\nYour Honor. If that is the purpose behind it, Congress\nhas a very different means of determining intent. And\nas the Court's repeatedly said, where you have\nconflicting means, you have preemption. But Section D\ndoesn't call for any inquiry into intent. It makes an\nassumption about intent, and then based on that\nassumption, the rule is automatic.\nSo whether it's a statute about intent, it's\npreempted, because Congress says the best evidence of\nintent is what you do on the beneficiary form; or\nwhether it's about -- about divorce, it's preempted,\nbecause Congress has spoken to when divorce will affect\nthe enjoyment of proceeds by the beneficiary.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Johnson, there are at\nleast one case where the State law would override the\nbeneficiary designation and that's obviously if the\nbeneficiary murdered the -- the insured. So how does\nthis scheme to displace the beneficiary designated in\nthe policy in the Slayer case requires State law? Is\nthat -\nMR. JOHNSON: Your Honor, I believe -- I do\nagree with the premise of your question was that the -\nwhich is that the Slayer would not be paid. The path to\nthat is, I think, as follows. I think if the Slayer\nStatute looks like a typical Slayer Statute, then it's\ngoing to speak to -- it's going to relate to life\ninsurance and the express preemption provision would\nprobably kick in and it would call for a different\nresult; it would be preempted.\nBut there's a longstanding Federal common\nlaw rule, and the lower courts addressing this situation\nhave also held that -- that that informs the Federal\nstatute here. The leading case from this Court is an\n1886 decision, National Mutual Life Insurance v.\nArmstrong, and it is such a well-established rule that I\nthink Congress can be viewed as having incorporated that\nrule under the statute by not having specifically\noverridden it.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So you get there by a\nFederal common law rule, but then who would get the\nproceeds? If the designated beneficiary is out because\nof the Federal common law that excludes a Slayer, where\nwould you go next? You'd go to State law, right?\nMR. JOHNSON: No, it would go to the order\nof precedence. So -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The next one is -- it\nwould be -\nMR. JOHNSON: It would be the widow or\nthe -- then the children and so forth, in that scenario.\nIf I may speak to Petitioner's argument\nabout the Rose v. Rose case, I think that that case is\nreally doubly inapposite. First of all, as this Court\nacknowledged in Rose, the statute there was designed to\nbenefit dependents as well as the veteran. And it\ndistinguished Wissner and Ridgway as cases involving a\nsituation where Congress wanted to give an absolute\nright to the -- the insured to ensure that they would\nenjoy the benefits.\nSecond of all, at the -- at the State law\nlevel, again, there's no guarantee that -- that the\noperation of Section D will result in the proceeds going\nto one's family. It could end up going to a perfect\nstranger under the next of kin provision. And in many\ncases, of course, the former spouse would be the one\ncaring for children. So it's really, I think, doubly\ninapposite.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: In the -- in the Wissner\ncase, there was a community property State. Do you\nknow, under the statute we're dealing with here, is\ncommunity property in those States also preempted so\nthat the -- the insured is the sole owner of the policy?\nMR. JOHNSON: I think that would be right,\nYour Honor. I mean, that is the holding of -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Because it was a specific\nprovision on that point in Wissner, and I -- or the\nCourt so read it. And I take it the same provision\napplies -- exists in this statute?\nMR. JOHNSON: Yes. The Wissner court said\nthat the order of precedence there was the controlling\nprovision of the Act, and it said the same thing again\nin Wissner concerning SGLIA's order of precedence and it\nsaid it displaces inconsistent State law. Wissner, of\ncourse, in that case, it was community property law; in\nRidgway, it was State constructive trust law.\nI would like to speak to the anti-attachment\nprovision. As Justice Ginsburg noted, that was an\nalternative holding of the Court in these earlier cases,\nand the Court referred to the order of precedence\nprovision as controlling. Rose v. Rose itself\nacknowledged that the anti-attachment provision was an\nalternative holding of the Court, and we think that that\nis sufficient to -- the order of precedence provision is\nsufficient to resolve this issue. Certainly, Congress,\nlooking at the Court's opinion in 1954 when it enacted\nFEGLIA, would have been likely to conclude that.\nIn -- in summary, Your Honors, this case is\nnot a difficult case for a finding of preemption under\nthis Court's precedence. It's really a much easier\ncase. It's not dealing with generally applicable law.\nIt's governed squarely by precedent, and the statute at\nissue here, Section D, is effectively an attempt to do\nan end run on the will of Congress.\nIf there are no further questions, I'll\ndefer to Ms. Goldenberg.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMs. Goldenberg.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF ELAINE J. GOLDENBERG,\nFOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,\nSUPPORTING RESPONDENT\nMS. GOLDENBERG: Mr. Chief Justice, and may\nit please the Court:\nSection D seeks to substitute a new\nbeneficiary in place of the one that Federal law\nmandates, and it does that through an attempted end run\naround Federal preemption. I'd like to start off by\ntalking about the purpose of the Federal law, which\nseveral of the Court's prior questions spoke to.\nThe purpose here is to get benefits to the\ndesignated beneficiary for that person's beneficial\nenjoyment. That's the purpose that the Court found in\nvery similar language in Ridgway and Wissner. And\nthat's -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, how far -- how\nfar does that go? Obviously, the benefit becomes the\nproperty of the named beneficiary, but it's not like to\nher enjoyment. She may want to spend it on something,\nbut it's going to be -- have to go through bankruptcy,\nit's going to have to go through other claims like any\nother property under State law.\nMS. GOLDENBERG: That's true, Your Honor,\nbut the designated beneficiary is benefiting in a sense\nwhen that money is used to pay that person's\nobligations. So we don't deny that because there's no\nanti-attachment provision here, the designated\nbeneficiary could be subject to a contracts judgment, a\ntort judgment, it could have to pay other outstanding\nobligations that that person has.\nBut that is extremely different than a law\nlike the one we have here that says, in effect, to the\ndesignated beneficiary, you know what, we don't really\nthink you're entitled to this money. We don't really\nthink you deserve it. We don't think you have, in\neffect, equitable title to it. We think that belongs to\nsomebody else and so we're just going to transfer the\nproceeds to that other person. That's an extremely\ndifferent situation.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, why would Congress\nwant to make sure that the money goes to the designated\nbeneficiary where there is a very clear expression of\nintent on the part of the insured that the money go\nsomeplace else.\nMS. GOLDENBERG: Well, I think there are a\nnumber of purposes served by that, and that speaks to\nthe will question that Your Honor asked earlier.\nFor one thing, it creates certainty in the\nprocess, not only for the insured, but also for the\nbeneficiary, who's not going to have to face some kind\nof long legal contest over the money that may eat up the\nproceeds in attorney's fees and costs.\nAnd that was a purpose that Congress\nspecifically articulated when it made the 1966 amendment\nto the statute.\nIt also -\nJUSTICE ALITO: These arguments seem to be\ncircular. You're saying that the -- the reason for\nmaking sure that the designated beneficiary gets the\nmoney instead of the person whom the insured has\nsubsequently and very clearly said he or she wants to\nget the money is to make sure that the designated\nbeneficiary gets the money, and gets it without any\nhassle.\nMS. GOLDENBERG: Well, it creates a clear\nand uniform set of rules that everyone can abide by.\nAnd also, I think in the case of a will, it protects the\ninsured from fraud. That was another purpose that\nCongress gave in 1966. They don't want a situation\nwhere someone is going to find a will after the fact and\nsay: Look, this shows what this person really thought.\nThe designated beneficiary form is the\nexpression of -- of the person's intent, and that's\nparticularly true here, where you have a very clear\nnetwork of rules set up by the Federal Government that\ntells insureds what they must do if they want to change\ntheir beneficiary designation, and tells them that their\nbeneficiary designation is going to -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But your -- your concern\nis there might be fraudulent wills?\nMS. GOLDENBERG: It's possible that if you\nare looking outside the designated -- the beneficiary\ndesignation form, that you may have people trying to\ncome up with some other expressions of intent. It could\nbe a will, it could be a letter, it could be other\nthings.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, it seems to me\nthat's grasping at straws.\nMS. GOLDENBERG: Well, Your Honor, that's,\nas I say, one of the purposes that Congress gave when it\npassed that amendment in 1966 that said you don't\nconduct this free-floating inquiry into the insured's\nintent. You don't ask, what would the insured have said\nif someone had asked them in the last moment of their\nlife what they had -- what would they want.\nYou look at the designated beneficiary, you\nlook at the beneficiary designation form. And as I was\nsaying, in -- in part, that's because it's so easy to\nchange. It's a one-page form. It's very simple. And\ninsureds are told over and over again: You have to keep\nyour beneficiary designation up to date; divorce\ndoesn't -\nJUSTICE ALITO: When are they told -- when\nare they told over and over again?\nMS. GOLDENBERG: Well, they -\nJUSTICE ALITO: They -- they get the form\nwhen they -- when they sign up for the life insurance,\nso they periodically get notices from OPM saying, now,\nremember, you've designated so-and-so as your\nbeneficiary, you know, annually, like in the open\nseason? Do you really want to keep this person as your\nbeneficiary?\nMS. GOLDENBERG: OPM actually does instruct\nagencies to periodically remind employees that they must\nkeep their beneficiary designations up to date.\nObviously, there is no way to know exactly what\nMr. Hillman was told here -\nJUSTICE ALITO: Nobody has told me that in\nmany years.\n(Laughter.)\nMS. GOLDENBERG: I hope it's clear at this\npoint.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but I mean, we\ndo get these cases over and over again. I mean, it is\nthe sort of thing that -- it may be very easy to do, but\nit is the sort of thing that people often overlook.\nMS. GOLDENBERG: That may be, but,\nnevertheless, Federal law sets up the rules and expects\npeople to abide by them. And what you can't have is the\nopposite rule, because that just creates tremendous\nconfusion. And I think the conflict here is very\nstarkly illustrated when you think about what somebody\nwho designated their spouse and got divorced and then\nwanted to keep that person as their beneficiary would\nhear from the Federal Government if they went and said,\nwhat should I do? I really want my ex-spouse to keep\nbeing the beneficiary. What ought I to do?\nAnd if they were to consult the FEGLIA\nhandbook, if they were to ask OPM, they would be told:\nDo nothing; that beneficiary designation is valid; it's\ngoing to remain valid until you change it yourself.\nNow, that person's intent would be overridden by section\nD, which would essentially pluck the benefits right out\nof the hand of the ex-spouse that that person meant them\nto go to and transfer them over to somebody else.\nAnd that makes essentially the focus of the\nFederal law on the designated beneficiary meaningless.\nIt makes the award of the proceeds to that person a\nmeaningless gesture. That's the language that this\nCourt used in Free v. Bland, which was a case about\nownership of Federal bonds. And that can't be what\nCongress intended. And you can't have these two\ndifferent default rules operating together and -- and\nhave a system that works.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Do you think that situation\ncomes up a lot, where an -- an insured wants to make\nsure that a former spouse gets more money than the\nspouse is entitled to under the divorce decree?\nMS. GOLDENBERG: I certainly think it's\npossible, Your Honor. I think every person is\ndifferent, every divorce is different.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, everything is\npossible. Do you think that's a common situation;\nthat's what Congress was -\nMS. GOLDENBERG: I don't know -\nJUSTICE ALITO: -- was concerned about?\nMS. GOLDENBERG: -- I don't know if I can\nspeak to how common it is, but, as we said in our brief,\nthere may be many reasons why somebody would want to\ngive their ex-spouse the insurance proceeds. And I\nthink what Congress was concerned with was effectuating\nthe intent of the insured as expressed in their\ndesignated -- in their designation form -- so that there\nwould be a clear system, a uniform system; and again, so\nthat the beneficiary would be protected against actions\nmuch like this one, that create all this confusion over\nwho is actually entitled to the proceeds, and may -- may\neat them up in -- in legal fees.\nIn addition, I'd point out that if\nPetitioner is correct, then you could have other State\nlaws that are like this one that try to rewrite the\norder of precedence. And essentially, the Federal order\nof precedence could be completely undone by State law.\nYou'd also have a situation in which Federal\nemployees attempting to figure out where their benefits\nare really going to go would have to make themselves\nfamiliar with State law. As Justice Ginsburg pointed\nout earlier, there may be serious choice of law problems\nthere. The vast majority of these employees are not\nattorneys and this is a tremendous burden to place on\nthem.\nIt's much simpler and clearer to have the\nsystem that we have under Federal law, and that's why\nthat system was set up.\nIf there are no further questions -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Ruttenberg, you have 3 minutes\nremaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DANIEL H. RUTTENBERG\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. RUTTENBERG: Thank you, Your Honor.\nFirst, a quick point about the -- the FEGLI\nhandbook. The FEGLI handbook came out in July 2008.\nWarren Hillman died in July 2008. So what the FEGLI\nhandbook said -- I don't know that it applies in this\ncase.\nBut even if it did, what it says is a\nrecitation of the Egelhoff holding. All it says is: \"A\ndivorce does not invalidate a designation that means\nyour former spouse is a beneficiary.\" It says nothing\nabout domestic relations laws not applying after that,\nand that's exactly what -- this Court found in Egelhoff.\nAnother -- another point that my friend made\nwas with regard to Servicemen's Group Life Insurance and\nthe holding in Ridgway was based on the fact that these\ninsurance proceeds belong to the designated beneficiary\nto the exclusion of all others. That was one of the\nmain purposes this Court depended upon in ruling that\nthe -- the State law was preempted.\nAnd you can't say that in this case, because\nthose proceeds can belong to -- there's express\nenactments which allow to you assign it, and allow a\nFederal -- a divorce decree to direct where those go.\nSo it can't be said in -- with FEGLIA that those\nproceeds belong to the designated beneficiary to the\nexclusion of all others.\nAnd the example that Mr. Chief Justice gave\nwith regard to bankruptcy, the -- in the case of a\nbankruptcy, that's not benefiting the designated\nbeneficiary because all their debts are being discharged\nanyways. So in that situation, it's solely benefiting\nthe creditors.\nI also wanted to address one of Justice\nScalia's comments. Justice Scalia was suggesting that\nthis is not a divorce law and is not subject to the\npreemption. But the preemption analysis with regards -\nthere were I think two reasons he suggested that. One\nwas it's a Federal act, and they applied in Ridgway,\nwhich was dealing with the Federal Act, the Servicemen's\nGroup Life Insurance, they did apply the preemption\nanalysis there. It was overcome, but they applied it.\nAnd this Court's case in Egelhoff also\nrecognized that the statute, very similar section A, the\nWashington version of section A, was a divorce/probate\ntype of law, both of which are historical police powers.\nThe -- the only other comment I would like\nto make is with regard to the Slayer statutes. Many\nState Slayer statutes are drafted with the identical\nlanguage of section D, which says if preempted then\nthere can be a State law cause of action. They're -\nthey're based on the same uniform code, and they use the\nsame language.\nAnd if there are no other questions, I just\nwould like to say what an honor it's been today and cede\nthe rest of my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
