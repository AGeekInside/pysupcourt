        "content": "(10:03 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument\nfirst today in Case 07-208, Indiana versus Edwards.\nMr. Fisher.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS M. FISHER\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. FISHER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe trial court was justified in requiring a\nhigher level of competency for self-representation in\norder to prevent the trial of Ahmad Edwards from\ndescending into a farce. Indeed, self-representation\nwhere a defendant cannot communicate coherently with the\njury or the court would defeat the very autonomy\ninterests that the Court ventured to protect in Faretta.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But why is it necessary to\nhave a special rule in order to prevent the trial from\ndescending into a farce? Why couldn't you simply apply\nthe same rule of competency that you apply for whether\nthe defendant can be tried, and then if in fact his\nself-representation begins to turn the trial into a\nfarce surely the court would have the power to prohibit\nhis further self-representation. Certainly, turning a\ntrial into a farce is a basis for the court's action;\nno?\nMR. FISHER: Well, I certainly hope so. And\nI think on the record we've got here the trial court did\nnot need to wait for that to happen. If the trial had\nbegun with Mr. Edwards representing himself with the\njury present, and the trial had then become so unwieldy\nand so farcical and such a mockery that he had -- his\nright of self-representation had to be overridden, I\nthink there would have been a problem, a possible\nproblem of taint with the jury. I think that the court\nwas justified, having seen Mr. Edwards in court --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The problem with taint\nwould be his own fault. I can't imagine that he would\nsuccess on appeal claiming he tainted the jury. And the\nadvantage of waiting is that by waiting to see if in\nfact he will turn the trial into a farce you avoid the\nrisk of depriving him of his right to represent himself,\nwhich is certainly a very important constitutional\nright. Why didn't you wait to see whether he's going to\nbe able to pull it off or not?\nMR. FISHER: I don't think that\nMr. Edwards's sort of waiver by conduct in that context\nis the only thing to consider. I think that the State's\ninterests in having a proceeding that proceeds smoothly\nwithout episodes that render the proceedings potentially\na mockery also are strong.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: As you understand the\nRespondent's position -- and perhaps the question is\nbetter addressed to the Respondent. But as you\nunderstand their position, would they accept\nJustice Scalia's formulation of what the rule ought to\nbe or the formulation that his question proposed?\nMR. FISHER: You know, it's not clear to me\nthat they would. It seems to me that their position is\nmuch more focused on the metes and bounds of what\nFaretta specifically recognized, which was requiring the\ndefendant to comply with the rules and if there is a\ndisorderly kind of behavior that would be sufficient.\nBut I don't read their position to be that someone who\nis lacking in communications skills and coherent\ncommunications skills even on the record in the trial\nwould be someone whose right of self-representation\ncould be overridden.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What would happen if\nyou started out with pro se representation and then the\ntrial turned into a farce? Start over again, but he\nwould have to accept counsel at that point?\nMR. FISHER: Well, it seems to me that we're\nin a world here where we don't really know what the\nprecise rules would be because of the lack of clarity\nfor the trial courts. So I don't want to tell you\nexactly what the Indiana courts would do, but I would\nimagine that a trial judge would be faced with a\ndecision based on how long the trial has gone on, what\nthe level of complexity of the trial is, what the level\nof farce or taint could be for the jury.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, there must be\nprecedents. I'm sure under the old rule, if I can\nrecall it the old rule, where you have a single standard\nfor both the right to be tried -- the -- the ability to\nbe tried and the right to represent yourself, there must\nhave been instances in which the person who was\nrepresenting himself was unable to cope and the trial\nwas -- was turning into a farce. There must have been\ninstances. What did they do?\nMR. FISHER: Well, I think in the cases\nwhere this happened, whether it's because the trial was\nturned into a farce or because the defendant was\nexcluded from the courtroom, as in Illinois v. Allen, I\nthink the trial often proceeds.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Proceeds, that's what I\nthought.\nMR. FISHER: But I guess what I'm suggests\nis that there is always going to be the possibility in\nterms of a discretionary judgment call, whether it's a\nsystematic rule or whether it's something up to the\ntrial judge, that the court may decide that in interest\nof fairness, that the -- you know -- all the -- all\nthat's gone on needs to be restarted, particularly if it\nhasn't gone on very far. I don't mean to suggest a rule\nin that regard. I'm suggesting --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What is your test that\nyou're going to apply ex ante? Whether he's able to\ncoherently --\nMR. FISHER: Oh, the test.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, what's the test?\nMR. FISHER: Well, the rule that we are\nsuggesting -- and again let it caution that this is not\na rule adopted by the Indiana Supreme Court yet -- is\nThat it is within the State's authority to override this\nright where the defendant cannot communicate coherently\nwith the court or the jury.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Cannot communicate\ncoherently? I sometimes -- I sometimes think that the\nlawyers cannot communicate coherently.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's really a vague test,\nisn't it?\nMR. FISHER: I don't think it's any worse in\nterms of vagueness than what we deal with in Dusky.\nNow, Dusky talks about a reasonable level of\nunderstanding and a reasonable ability to assist the\nlawyer.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Let me give you a\nconcrete illustration that was brought up by the other\nside. If you have this coherent expression test, what\nhappens to the person who has a bad speech impediment?\nOr someone who needs -- who isn't conversant in the\nEnglish language? Are they -- automatically the right\nof self representation is automatically ruled out?\nMR. FISHER: No. I think that in\ncircumstances such as those, there is another level of\nanalysis, which is whether there's some sort of\naccommodation that can be made that would allow the\nrepresentation, self-representation, to proceed by means\nof -- whether it's an interpreter or another means of\ncommunication.\nBut What we're dealing with with Ahmad\nEdwards is someone whose thought processes so\ndecompensate and become so disorganized that it's not --\nit's not a matter of having an interpreter to carry out\nhis instructions. It's a matter of having someone who\ncan actually formulate a coherent defense and\ncommunicate that to the court and to the jury.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So your standard of\ncoherent communication, you would not require the\ndefendant, for example, to understand the hearsay rule,\nor other things of that sort?\nMR. FISHER: No.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, even if you\ndon't, I mean, how is he going to effectively\nparticipate in the trial? Does he have to know, for\nexample, that he has the right and understand that he\nhas the right to cross-examine witnesses?\nMR. FISHER: We're not asking to get into\nthat kind of level of detailed knowledge. All we're\nsuggesting is that once the defendant has made the\nchoices that are forced upon him essentially by the\ntrial, i.e., the decision to represent himself and the\ndecision whether to present a defense or not, that he\ncan actually carry that out; whatever it is that he\nwants to do within the rules of the court, that he has\nthe capability of effectuating that. And that's the\nproblem Ahmad Edwards had.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But surely his total\nignorance of all of the trial rules, the hearsay rule\nand the other details of conducting a trial, is a great\ndisadvantage. But we allow him to toss that away so\nlong as he knows he's tossing it away. That the judge\ninstructs him: You're ill-advised to proceed on your\nown; you're not a lawyer; this is, you know, a\ncomplicated process; are you sure you want to represent\nyourself? And if he says yes, we say, well, you know,\nyou've brought it on yourself.\nWhy can't we say the same thing about his\nsupposed inability to communicate effectively, unless\nand until he turns the trial into a farce?\nMR. FISHER: Well, we can, but we need not,\nI think is the point. And it's because there's a world\nof difference between lack of legal knowledge and the\ninability to relay a kind of coherent message that any\nperson, lawyer or not, of ordinary kind of mental\nability, capacity, would be able to formulate. I think\nthat there are substantial doubts about whether somebody\nlike Ahmad Edwards could convey to the jury that, in\nfact, what he wants to present is, for example,\nself-defense.\nWhat we're talking about here is that he may\nbe thinking that and that may be something that Faretta\nentitles him to want to pursue on his own, but we're\nconcerned that he couldn't in front of a jury\ncommunicate that that's what he was trying to --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if he -- what\nif he wants to communicate not self-defense, but that,\nyou know, Martians did it? Is he -- and he can\ncoherently communicate that. There won't be any doubt\non the judge's part or the jury that he thinks Martians\ndid it? Would that qualify?\nMR. FISHER: Well, I think we're getting\nhopefully not into an area where there would be\nlegitimate questions about underlying Dusky competency.\nI mean, it seems to me in that circumstance you could\nhave that level of concern as well. And then, beyond\nthat, if someone is using a sort of insanity\ndemonstration in the context of the trial, it seems to\nme the court could fall back on not this rule, but on\nthe rule that there has to be a defense that's within\nthe bounds of the rules of the court.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I mean, I'm\ntrying to find some level that is above competency. I\nmean, there are people who believe in Martians, but\nabove competence to stand trial, but also that would\nstill be coherently communicated, but would show that\nit's a ridiculous defense that's not going to be\neffective in representing himself.\nMR. FISHER: Well, I do think there's a line\nthat can be drawn between a ridiculous defense that's\nwithin the bounds of sort of relevance and possibility,\nsuch as, you know, a very ill-advised self-defense\ntheory, and the idea that the Martians did it, which I\nthink raises substantial questions as to Dusky\ncompetency as well.\nNow, I think that even looking at the\nCourt's later cases after Faretta, if we look at\nMartinez and McKaskle, we see the same sense of\nbalancing that is what we're advocating here. I think\nthat McKaskle, recognizing that is a role sometimes for\nstandby counsel and that it is to be limited, is\nsomething that starts down this road. And we're not\ntalking about a rule here I think that would threaten\nthe underlying decision that Faretta protects. We're\ntalking about a rule that is simply designed to let a\ntrial court ensure that the decisions that the defendant\nmakes are going to effectuate --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Do you think -- there is\nalways a concern in these cases whether or not we're\ngoing to be creating more inefficiencies for the\njudicial system; that is to say, the trial judge was\nincorrect in ruling that the trial was becoming a farce.\nI suppose you've weighed that cost against the benefits\nof the rule. And what are the benefits of the rule,\nthat the trial is quicker, that the appeal is clearer?\nMR. FISHER: Well, I think the benefits of\nthe rule, first and foremost, is that the State has and\nthe judicial system has greater certainty that there was\na fair trial, that the adversarial process played out in\na way that gave the jury, you know, a meaningful\ndecision to make, and also that it conveys to the public\nthat this is a reliable system.\nNow, you're very right. This may introduce\ninefficiencies, and we don't know what the Indiana\nSupreme Court would make of that in its role as the\nsupervising court for the Indiana -- for the Indiana\ncourts.\nBut I think that what courts have an\nimpression of, including the Indiana Supreme Court, is\nthat they're not allowed to undertake that balance, that\nGodinez and Faretta combine to preclude that option, and\nthat's what we want the Court to clear up, to say that\nthey do have that option.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Do you think your rule\nwould create an incentive for trial judges in close\ncases to always deny self-representation? Because\ncertainly most trials proceed more efficiently and less\ntrouble for the judge if you have a lawyer there.\nMR. FISHER: Well, I think that they're --\ntrial courts are always going to be concerned about\ngoing too far and being reversed on those grounds. So\nit seems to me that the same kinds of concerns that they\ndeal with when they're making an evaluation of Dusky\ncompetency and making, you know, evaluation of whether a\nwaiver is known and voluntary, those kinds of incentives\nwould kind of be the same here in terms of not wanting\nto go too far.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What would the standard of\nreview be? I'm a reviewing court. The judge has not\nallowed this person to represent himself. What's the\nstandard of review? Abuse of discretion or what?\nMR. FISHER: I think so. I think it would\nbe something very --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Abuse of discretion?\nMR. FISHER: -- very much akin to what we\nlook at with Dusky. Whether there are factual\ndeterminations may be reviewed for clear error, but the\noverall judgment is essentially an abuse of discretion,\na deferential kind of --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But I assume if there is\nerror it would be structural error --\nMR. FISHER: Yes.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: There would be no room for\nharmless error analysis.\nMR. FISHER: I agree with that.\nJUSTICE ALITO: If the State's objective is\nto make sure that there is a reasonably fair trial or\nsomething that resembles a fair trial, isn't that going\nto result in the denial of self-representation in a\ngreat number of cases?\nMR. FISHER: Well, I think that -- we're not\nsuggesting a rule that is unlimited in that regard. The\nconcern for fair trial is something that I think in a\nlot of other Sixth Amendment contexts has some leeway,\nbut it also has limits. In the Wheat case, for example,\nwhere the Court overrode the choice of -- first choice\npaid counsel in view of conflicts of interest and the\nfairness questions those raised, I don't think the Court\nhas been terribly concerned that interest runs wild and\nthat it overrides that right.\nJUSTICE ALITO: If it is the case, as a lot\nof people believe, that it is very -- it's the rare case\nin which a lay defendant can adequately represent\nhimself or herself, then where do you draw the line?\nMR. FISHER: Well, again, I think that there\nis a qualitative, a real -- a sort of realistic line to\nbe drawn between someone who maybe has bad ideas and bad\njudgments and someone who just cannot communicate what\nthose judgments are. In other words, someone who is\nunable, particularly in an unstructured, stressful\nenvironment, to communicate what it is that their\nmessage is to the jury, to the judge --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But in either case,\nthere's a farce.\nMR. FISHER: Well, I think that there --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: A very rational highly\ncompetent person might want to make the trial a farce.\nWhy should that case be any different than where the\nperson does so because he's incompetent?\nMR. FISHER: Because I think that the -- the\nkinds of decisions that someone would make that would\nbe -- I think even if well-communicated, would\ndemonstrating a farcical trial, would threaten the Dusky\ncompetency standard. They would -- they would raise\nquestions in that regard. Now, if someone just had a\nbad notion of what it is to defend themselves and what\nidea they're trying to present to the jury, I don't\nthink, if that is communicated coherently, that that\npresents the same concerns of a farcical trial that we\nhave with Ahmad Edwards.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: The State's interests are\nthe same. If the highly competent person deliberately\nwants to make a shambles out of the proceeding, the\nState's interests are the same. Now, there are certain\noptions available. They can exclude him from the\ncourtroom or something, but --\nMR. FISHER: Well, again, I think that there\nare limits on what we're arguing, and I think that --\nthat the Wheat case demonstrates how there can be\nflexibility here in terms of pursuing these fairness\ninterests without overriding completely the\nself-representation interests -- or, I'm sorry, the\nSixth Amendment interests of a larger set of defendants.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Fisher, are you\nmaking essentially a \"we know it when we see it\"\nargument? Because you're not talking about some\nabstract notion of what would be an abuse of discretion,\nbut you have in your brief -- you have at pages 15 and\n16 -- some examples, concrete examples of this\ndefendant. And you could say when it gets to that\nlevel, you don't have to wait to see how it's going to\nplay out. If this is how this man speaks and thinks,\nhow could a jury be exposed to it? It would be\ngibberish.\nMR. FISHER: Right. And I think that you\ndon't really have an unwieldy standard here any more\nthan with respect to Dusky when you're looking at\nevaluations of statements and other things that the\ndefendant might have made.\nIf I may, I'd like to reserve the remainder\nof my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Dreeben.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,\nAS AMICUS CURIAE,\nSUPPORTING THE PETITIONER\nMR. DREEBEN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThere are instances in the trial courts,\nparticularly with respect to mentally ill defendants,\nwhere a defendant may have the degree of rational\nunderstanding to satisfy the relatively low standard of\ncompetence established in Dusky and reaffirmed\nthereafter, but not have the capability of carrying out\nthe tasks that are needed to be performed in order to\ntry a case without it degenerating into a farce.\nAnd I think, as Justice Scalia pointed out,\nit would be well within the power of the trial court at\nthe time that that occurred to terminate\nself-representation in order to further the State's\nstrong and important interest in fairness and the\nappearance of fairness.\nThe question is whether a judge can also\nmake that decision ex ante before the trial has begun\nand insist that the defendant be represented through\ncounsel.\nWe think the answer is that a State or the\nFederal Government would have a sufficient interest in\nterminating self- representation or in denying a motion\nfor self-representation --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And what's your test, the\nsame test: Inability to communicate no matter how\nidiotic? I mean this man is living in a fantasy world.\nHe understands that he's on trial, but his whole world\nis just -- he not only believes in Martians, he thinks\nwe are all Martians, or something like that.\nI mean --\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, Justice Scalia --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why pick on just the\nability to communicate? It seems to me there are a lot\nof defects that can turn the trial into a farce.\nMR. DREEBEN: We agree with that,\nJustice Scalia. And our view is that the Court should\nnot necessarily resolve this by adopting a specific test\nthat focuses on the ability to communicate, but should,\ninstead, look at whether the State has a sufficient\ninterest that would be served by denying self-\nrepresentation.\nThe defendant's lack of ability to\ncommunicate can certainly serve that interest. There\nmay be instances in which the defendant lacks the memory\nto be able to remember from day to day what happened in\nthe trial; and if you were called upon to perform all\nthe myriad tasks of trial counsel, he would break down.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Do you worry at all that if\nwe adopt a separate test for the ability to represent\nyourself, that the inevitable effect will be for the\ntest for being able to be tried to become less and less\nrigorous?\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, I think --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: After all, there's no harm\ndone so long as the person can't -- is not allowed to\nrepresent himself.\nI think there may be some value in linking\nthe two, so that -- so that the court knows that if he\nfinds the individual capable of being tried, he may have\nto begin a trial with this individual representing\nhimself.\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, Justice Scalia, I think\nthat the tests serve different purposes. The competency\nthreshold, as the Court has noted, is a minimal\nthreshold. It is designed to ferret out whether the\ndefendant has the minimal degree of rational\nunderstanding to assist his counsel and to understand\nwhat's happening.\nAnd he then, if he wants to waive counsel,\nhas to have a knowing and intelligent waiver, which\nmeans he has to understand what he's doing. But those\ninquiries don't focus on whether he, in fact, could\ncarry out the substantially more demanding task, both\nmentally and as far as the ability to communicate goes,\nof presenting a case to the jury during a trial.\nThere are many examples of mentally ill\ndefendants whose world views may be substantially skewed\nin many respects, but the competency threshold focuses\non whether they can understand the case in front of\nthem. For example, if you have a defendant who is on\ntrial for making certain specific threats against\nidentified people, he may have the ability to understand\nwhat the charge is and to assist counsel in whether he\nsaid those things and what he intended by them, even if\nhis world view in many respects is extremely skewed; he\nhas paranoid delusions; and his ability to communicate\ncoherently on his own is very diminished.\nAnd that is why the competency threshold\ndoes not fully address the very important interest that\na State has in presenting to the world that the trial is\na fair one.\nThis has both the dimension of actual\nfairness as well as perceived fairness because if the\npublic sees the spectacle of a mentally ill defendant,\nwho may well be able to cooperate with counsel and with\nthe assistance of counsel get through a trial, attempt\nto communicate to the jury on his own in a very\ndelusional way, it really casts the justice system into\ndisrepute.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: If it gets to be bad, the\ncourt can terminate it and say, you know, you can't\nrepresent yourself. We're going to bring in counsel.\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, Justice Scalia, I think\nunder existing law that could not be done if the\nRespondent's view of Faretta is adopted as an absolute\nrule.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Sure, it could be done if\nthe trial is, indeed, turning into a farce.\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, I think it depends on\nwhat you mean by \"turning into a farce.\" It is\nwell-established now that if the defendant actually\nobstructs the proceeding, stands up out of order,\ndisregards the judge's procedural rulings and in --\nviolates the decorum of the courtroom,\nself-representation can be terminated. And that, I\nthink, is an important fact that establishes that the\nFaretta right is not an absolute right. But here\nwe're talking about turning it into a farce in a\ndifferent way. For example, in Colin Ferguson's trial\nfor murder in New York, he got up, and he told the jury\nin his opening statement: I've been charged with 93\ncounts because it is the year 1993. If it were the year\n1928, I would have been charged with 28 counts.\nAnd that doesn't violate the decorum of the\nroom, but it really casts doubt on what is the State\ndoing here: Putting somebody on trial, having them\nrepresent themselves with no lawyer, when that's the\nmental ability that they have to understand what's going\non.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this question:\nDo you think the inability to speak English would be a\nfactor that the judge could take into account in making\nthis judgment?\nMR. DREEBEN: No, I don't think so,\nJustice Stevens. I think a translator could deal with a\nnon-English-speaking defendant. I think a defendant\nwith a speech impediment can be assisted in other ways.\nWe actually think that the Court could\napproach this case by looking at the most acute phase of\nthis problem, in our view and experience, which is a\ndefendant who is mentally ill. Because then you have a\nconcrete connection, particularly with serious mental\nillness, between the defendant's diagnosed state and the\nabilities and capacities that he may have when he takes\nthe floor as his own lawyer.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Could we have a rule that\neven if you are highly competent, if you make the trial\ninto a farce, you forfeit your Faretta right?\nMR. DREEBEN: Yes, you certainly could,\nJustice Kennedy. And I think that that would be an\nimportant step in the right direction.\nI think in cases where the judge has, as he\ndid in this case, a very firm foundation for\nunderstanding that this defendant could not present a\ncoherent defense to the jury and, if allowed to\nrepresent himself, would create a potential shambles --\nnot that the trial couldn't go forward in the sense\nthere would nobody courtroom decorum, but in the sense\nthat what the defendant would say to the jury would make\nno sense.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, why not just change\nthe rule about what you can do, once the trial is under\nway? You say sometimes it's not a farce. It's just\nthat this person is obviously incapable of making a\ncoherent defense. Why not wait to see?\nWhat I object to in the proposal is making\nthese judgments ex ante on the basis of -- I don't know\n-- psychological testing or past behavior or anything\nelse.\nGive it a try. The person wants to\nrepresent himself. It's his constitutional right. If,\nindeed, it turns out that this is turning into a sham,\nfine, bring in a lawyer to represent him.\nBut doing it beforehand on the basis of your\nprediction as to what the trial is going to turn into\nseems to me not to give enough respect to an\nindividual's desire to represent himself.\nMR. DREEBEN: I think to force the State to\nhave the train wreck occur, when the evidence is very\nfirm and reliable that it will occur, infringes the\nState's interests in starting the trial from the\nbeginning in a coherent and orderly way and not\nbasically subjecting the defendant to the risk of an\nunfair trial based on the defendant's own incompetence.\nAnd this record is about as good as you are\ngoing to get on that. The defendant's communications,\nwhich are in the jury -- which are in the joint appendix\nand which Justice Ginsburg has mentioned and they are\nreproduced in the Petitioner's brief, show that although\nthe psychiatrists ultimately concluded that he could\nwork with his lawyer, when you put him on his own and\nask him to articulate anything to the judge, which he\ndid in great extent, it made no sense whatsoever.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And these were\ncommunications made to the judge before the trial\nstarted?\nMR. DREEBEN: That's correct. And this\njudge had also seen the defendant firsthand during the\nfirst trial. There had been years of competency\nproceedings. With the aid of medication, the defendant\nwas brought to an extent where he was competent to\nassist his counsel. But that in no way gave him the\ncompetency to actually carry out the trial. And this\njudge, I think, did the responsible thing. Rather than\nallow the defendant to sort of allow himself to commit\nState-assisted suicide by going before a trial in a way\nthat had no capacity of producing a result that would\ntruly be regarded as fair, the judge said: I'm not\ngoing to do it; I'm going to terminate\nself-representation because I think that's in the best\ninterest of justice.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Dreeben.\nMR. DREEBEN: Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Stancil.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK T. STANCIL\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. STANCIL: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe expressed premise of the Sixth Amendment\nand of our adversarial system generally is that the\ndefense belongs to the accused and not to the State.\nThe defendant has the choice whether to exercise a\nparticular constitutional right or, as in Godinez, to\npresent no defense whatsoever. Eliminating the right of\nself-representation based on concerns about a\ndefendant's courtroom ability violates that fundamental\nprinciple. And importantly, the accused does not\nsurrender that control over his defense simply because\nthe State's judgment is that he'd be better served by\nproceeding through counsel.\nTo the contrary, a lawyer may speak for his\nclient, not because he needs counsel, but only because\nhe has consented to the representation. And the\nproposals that the State and the United States have\noffered here are fundamentally inconsistent with that\nbedrock principle of the Sixth Amendment.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you argue that\nthe State has no interest to be considered in this\ncalculus? In other words, it is solely the interest of\nthe defendant in representing himself and that the State\nhas no interest in ensuring a credible process?\nMR. STANCIL: No, Your Honor. Faretta\nexpressly contemplated that in footnote 46. The Court\nrecognized the limitations on the right of\nself-representation, to include the rules of courtroom\nprocedure, decorum, and standby counsel. Those are\nperfectly adequate and indeed, when correctly enforced,\nmore than adequate to protect against the kind\nof concern --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but an\nindividual doesn't have to know and appreciate the rules\nof courtroom procedure to be judged competent to stand\ntrial.\nMR. STANCIL: Correct. But he's held to\nthem if he makes the decision to proceed. And that's\nthe fundamental premise of this case, is that a\ndefendant who --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but that's\nsuggesting to me that you give no weight to the State\ninterest. In other words, so long as he's held to those\nrules, that's basing your determination solely on his\ninterest and no weight given to the State's interest in\nensuring that you have a trial where people are\nobserving the rules.\nMR. STANCIL: Two responses, Your Honor.\nFirst, the State's interest in fairness is -- I think\nis -- assumes the question, if you will, or begs the\nquestion, what is fair. Under the Sixth Amendment a\ntrial is fair if you have the choice whether to pursue a\ncertain right.\nSo in Godinez, for example, this Court\nconcluded that it was fundamentally fair for the\ndefendant to sit silent and to -- not to be held to any\nhigher competency determination for waiving his right to\ncounsel and proceeding pro se. This was in a capital\ncase no less. So, I think the State's concern that it\ndoesn't appear to be fair if the defendant isn't somehow\nheld to a higher standard of competency is -- is wrong.\nThe --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Can I ask the\n-- it's really the flip side of the question\nJustice Scalia asked. Why shouldn't we be concerned\nthat if you have the same standard that trial courts are\ngoing to elevate the competency showing beyond what\nreally is required?\nIn other words, if they have to have the\nsame standard, they don't want a proceeding where you've\ngot someone who -- you know, whatever the standard is --\nis not going to be as competent or reasonably\nrepresented as he would by a lawyer, so they're more\nlikely to find the person incompetent to stand trial in\nthe first place?\nThese are addressed to two different,\nentirely different questions. And rather than having a\nproblem with merging the standards which results in one\nof them being cheated, why don't we have two different\nstandards?\nMR. STANCIL: Well, I assume you're speaking\nabout competency to stand trial under Dusky?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes.\nMR. STANCIL: Well, first of all, the States\nhave that option. That's clear. So, if the States are\nconcerned about the effects of this rule, that's always\nbeen their choice. Certainly they're free to do so.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought your argument\nis it's not a choice, that there is only one standard,\neither you're competent or you're not competent? That\nis, I thought your position is competency is a unitary\nnotion and your opponent's position is, no, there are\nshades of competency.\nMR. STANCIL: Justice Ginsburg, we're\nspeaking about the competency to stand trial. And I\nthink that was judge -- the Chief Justice's question.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: When you say they have\ntheir choice, you meant they have the choice of\nelevating the standard that applies to the competency to\nstand trial if they wish?\nMR. STANCIL: Correct.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well then, why don't\nthey have the choice of elevating the standard for\nability to represent themselves in a coherent way at\ntrial?\nMR. STANCIL: Because --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's what\nunderstood Godinez to say, that you certainly don't have\nto elevate your standard, but I didn't understand it to\nsay you can't.\nMR. STANCIL: Because the Sixth Amendment\nsays once you get to the adversarial proceeding in\ncourt, the State cannot cross to the other side of the\ncourtroom and second guess the defendant's decision.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, it actually\ndoesn't say that.\nMR. STANCIL: Well, with respect, Your\nHonor, every Sixth Amendment decision that I'm aware of\ndoes not let the court, in the name of second guessing\nthe defendant, whether a decision would benefit the\ndefendant come in and say: Well, for example, you may\nnot want to take the stand in your own defense, because,\nwell, look at you; you've got unsightly tattoos that\nthis jury may find offensive. The State cannot come in\nand say: Well, this trial would be a farce if you take\nthe stand and so you're not competent to exercise that\nright.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It seems to me that\nboth sides are kind of raising these, taking the\narguments to extremes and they don't have to do that.\nIf you -- if you accept the fact that there can be a\nhigher standard than competency to stand trial, that\ndoesn't mean that the judge can say you can't make the\ndecision if you have tattoos.\nMR. STANCIL: The logic I believe is the\nsame. They say the appearance of this is so unsightly\nthat we wouldn't -- that we can't allow it to go\nforward. And I just don't think that logic has any\nplace in the Sixth Amendment.\nTo come back, if I may, to the statement in\nGodinez, in Roman III of Godinez, it doesn't mean that\nStates are free to sever competency to stand trial from\nthe right of self-representation and raise one and not\nthe other. What it says is that States are free to\nelaborate upon the standards for -- elaborate on the\nDusky standard, and it cites Medina, which is a case\nabout competency to stand trial. I think what it\ncontemplates, and quite sensibly, is if somebody comes\nin and wants to self-represent and there are indicia\nthat that's a particularly bad decision, that you may\nwant to ask more questions to determine is he Dusky\ncompetent, because that's what Dusky is about. It is\nabout decision-making.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But this is a trial judge\nwho has a very practical, immediate concern. And he's\nnot looking at Dusky, not looking at Peretz. He says:\nI have found that Mr. Edwards is able to stand trial\nwith the assistance of an attorney. I never made any\nfinding that he was -- that he was competent if he\ndidn't have that aid. I never found that he was\ncompetent to defend himself. He's competent, but only\nif he has a lawyer who is running the show.\nThat was the finding that the trial judge\nmade: That's my finding. Are you tell me to make that\nfinding I have to say that he's not competent to stand\ntrial?\nMR. STANCIL: No, Your Honor. That finding\nis the essence of his legal error. He says: You are\nDusky competent, you have the decision-making capacity\nto stand trial and in particular to exercise your other\nrights, to plead guilty, to waive a trial by jury, to\ntake the stand in your own defense. But he says:\nBecause you lack these courtroom abilities, you're not\n-- you're not competent somehow to exercise this\nadditional right.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Do you disagree with the\npoint that's made by the American Psychiatric\nAssociation that competency is not a unitary concept,\nthat a person can be competent to assist an attorney at\ntrial but not competent to make all of the decisions and\nperform in some minimally reasonable way the various\ntasks that have to be performed during the course of a\ntrial?\nMR. STANCIL: As a legal matter, yes. As a\nmedical matter, I'm in no position to challenge --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Why shouldn't the law track\nmedicine? I mean, we're not -- we're interested in a\nperson having a fair trial.\nMR. STANCIL: That might have been a fair\nargument before Godinez, where the APA and other medical\norganizations advanced this exact argument, and the\nCourt said -- and if you'll indulge me, I'd like to\nquote -- it said that: \"While it is undeniable that in\nmost criminal prosecutions defendants could be\nbetter\" -- \"could better defend with counsel's guidance\nthan by their own unskilled efforts, a criminal\ndefendant's ability to represent himself has no bearing\nupon his competence to choose self\" --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, I didn't think this\ncase has been decided by prior precedent. I thought\nthere was some opening here. Going back to what I think\nI said in Martinez and Justice Kennedy said, we were --\nI was interested in, and perhaps he was, in a few\nempirical facts, because we'd heard lots of complaints\nfrom trial judges who said this makes no sense at all.\nVery disturbed people are being deprived and end up in\nprison because they're disturbed rather than because\nthere guilty.\nNow, I wanted to know the facts. And it\nseemed to me we have a excellent, really fabulous --\nthat this has happened, and Professor Hashimoto seems to\nhave gone and written, done research, which we have in\nfront of us. As I read that research, I first learned\nthat actually the pro se defendants don't do a bad job\nof defending themselves. And by and large, they do\nsurprisingly well. And so perhaps that eliminates some\nof the concern.\nBut the other thing that it tells me is that\nthere is a small subclass of pro se defendants who may\nin fact do badly. And we have in front of us one of\nthose individuals and that, therefore, a rule which\npermitted a State to deal with this subclass of\ndisturbed people who want to represent themselves, who\ncould communicate with counsel, but can't communicate\nwith anybody else, that if we focus on that subclass and\naccept the State's argument here, interestingly enough,\nwe've gone a long way to deal with a serious practical\nproblem, and we've advanced the cause of seeing that\nindividuals have a fair trial.\nSo I'd like you to comment on that, and that\nwas my reaction after reading that study.\nMR. STANCIL: I'm not sure where to start,\nYour Honor, but if I could, I'll start with the\npractical problem.\nIt's been suggested here that there are --\nthere are no ways for trial judges to deal with trials\nthat may descend into farce, for example. I think\nthat's incorrect. Take for example the rules of\ncourtroom procedure. If a defendant stands up, a pro se\ndefendant, stands up and says something that's\nirrelevant or prejudicial or argumentative in some way\nthat violates the very strict rules of courtroom\nprocedure, the State need only stand up and say,\nobjection; objection sustained; inquiry terminated. So\nthe idea that we're going to be listening to 20 or 30\nminutes or hours of rants is I think overblown. Courts\nhave that tool.\nMoreover, there's the additional tool of\nstandby counsel. So we're not talking about a road that\nyou have -- once you're committed to you're stuck with.\nThe court --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but you're\nputting a heavy burden on the State to say, all right,\nnow -- and the prosecution -- to say, now we've got to\nlook out for what this guy is going to say, and now\nwe've got to appoint standby counsel. And I'm not sure\nhow your response deals with the guy who says: I was\nindicted for 93 counts because it's 1993. I mean, is\nthe prosecutor supposed to stand up then and say:\nObjection, that's ridiculous?\nMR. STANCIL: Well, one, certainly the\nState's rule has nothing to say about that either. I\nmean, that's a perfectly lucid communication. Two, I\nthink the answer is yes. If he -- if he makes any\nopening statement that the evidence will not support --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes, that the State\nhas to incur these extra burdens?\nMR. STANCIL: I don't think that's much more\nof a burden than they do when they're facing a defense\nlawyer.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, you've presumed in\nyour answer to Justice Breyer -- I don't know if you\nfully answered all of the questions he raised -- that\nthis defendant would immediately obey the objection.\nThat doesn't happen.\nMR. STANCIL: And that --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: They don't communicate.\nIt's two ships passing in the night or in the case of\nsome defendants about five ships passing in the night.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So -- so you're presuming\nsomething that that's -- that's just inconsistent with\nthe reality. And you answered Justice Alito's question\nto say well, it's a legal matter; if it's a medical\nmatter I don't comment. But it's a practical matter;\nit's a commonsense matter. We know what goes on, and\nwhat goes on is very costly to the State and to the\nfairness of the trial.\nMR. STANCIL: Justice Kennedy, the tool is\nright in front of the Court in Illinois versus Allen.\nIf the defendant does not obey your direction, you have\nto warn him; and if he continues in his disruptive\nbehavior or disobeying the court, you can take away his\nSixth Amendment right. In Illinois versus Allen, I\nthink it is very crucial --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Your response to that, as\nit was to me, I take it to be: Well, focusing on this\nsubclass, the judge has other ways of dealing with the\nproblem. My thought about that is, first, I don't know.\nMaybe the damage is done by that point before the jury\nor elsewhere.\nAnd my second thought is, because I'm not\ncertain about whether your answer is right or wrong, nor\nare any of us really, this is a perfect instance where\nthe States should experiment.\nMR. STANCIL: Except that, Your Honor, it\nundermines the fundamental premise of the Sixth\nAmendment, which is it's his defense. So, for\nexample --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Are there any psychiatric\nstudies that show how accurate psychiatric studies are?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. STANCIL: Well --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That -- that estimate, for\nexample, how accurately one can predict whether a\nparticular defendant will indeed be able to defend\nhimself?\nMR. STANCIL: Not to my knowledge,\nJustice Scalia.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I didn't think so.\nMR. STANCIL: I believe the APA acknowledges\nin its brief that there's not a lot of literature about\n--\nJUSTICE BREYER: There isn't on this, but of\ncourse part of the job of being a psychiatrist or a\npsychologist or a doctor is continuously to evaluate the\naccuracy of studies. So if it's a general question, I\nguess the question is of course there are.\nMR. STANCIL: But. Well -- but -- but the\npath to -- to a resolution that doesn't offend the Sixth\nAmendment is to make the record. So, for example --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But Mr. Stancil, I mean,\nyou say make the record. You said a moment ago, have\nstandby counsel who can take over. It seems to me that\nthe -- that the trouble with these proposals is that by\nthe time the record is made, if by that you mean\ncourtroom performance, or by the time standby counsel is\nrequired to take over, the damage is done.\nAnd it -- it seems to me that a trial judge\nin those situations who says, okay, I declare at this\npoint that the trial has become so farcical it cannot go\non like this, the trial judge at that point is -- has\ngot a damaged product in the part of the trial that has\nalready taken place. And the tough question, I think,\nis not whether he can simply tell standby counsel to\ntake over, but whether anyone can take over without\ndeclaring a mistrial at that point. And the cost of\nmistrial is a cost in addition to the cost that the\nState has been arguing for, that it should not be\nregarded in the public eye as the sponsor of farces.\nWhat do you say to the problem of the\nlikelihood that a mistrial is going to be the cost of\ncorrecting or switching over once the -- once the damage\nhas been proven?\nMR. STANCIL: Extraordinarily remote, for\ntwo reasons. First, I think what trial courts probably\nneed is encouragement to enforce these rules against pro\nse defendants that are -- that are at their disposal.\nSo an opinion from this Court that says, reaffirms,\nyou've got Illinois versus Allen and you don't have to\nlet it go on for 30 minutes. You can, you know, nip it\nin the bud and you've got the rules of evidence and\nrules of the procedure.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well -- suppose\nthe judge, the trial judge, says: Mr. Stancil, please\nturn to page 15 of the blue brief. I have had\nconsiderable communication with this defendant. Read\nwhat it says there. Do I have to wait for this to be\nrepeated in the courtroom? \"Listen to this case, the\nfoundations of my cause. The Criminal Rule 4. Court's\nterritory, acknowledged May 29, 2001, abandoned for the\nyoung American citizen to bring a permissive\nintervention acting as the forces to predict my future\ndisgrace by the court to motion young Americans to\ngather against crime.\"\nNow, that's not an isolated incident. This\nrecord is full of that kind of statement coming from\nthis defendant.\nMR. STANCIL: Justice Ginsburg, I'm very\nglad you brought that up, because it illustrates two\nproblems with this -- with the armchair psychiatry that\nthe State is urging here.\nFirst, this letter actually follows on the\nheels of a motion that Ahmad Edwards filed under Indiana\nRule 4(c) that says under 4(c) you have to try him\nwithin a year of charging, and I have been tried, I've\nbeen sitting in confinement.\nSo when he says \"Listen to this case, the\nfoundations of my cause, the Criminal Rule 4,\" that came\nto the judge. I bet good money the judge knew what that\nmeant. Now, there are other things around it that I\ngrant you are problematic.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, take the rest of\nthe paragraph.\nMR. STANCIL: Yes, but -- and if I may --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You have to stop. I\nmean, you have given a reason that this might make\nsense.\nMR. STANCIL: Yes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But the judge says: Does\nthat means I have to sit here and every time he makes a\nstatement like that explain to the jury what he meant?\nThen I'm becoming involved myself in a -- in a\nconsulting role, not as an impartial judge of this case\nanymore, but as a kind of a facilitator of the\ndefendant.\nMR. STANCIL: No, Your Honor. If I may, two\npoints. First, to back up a step, we have no idea,\nbecause the record is silent on this, whether when\nMr. Edwards wrote this he was continuing to take his\nmedication and receive therapy.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: What difference does it\nmake?\nMR. STANCIL: Because that's the reason --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Because the trial judge has\ngot a problem, and it doesn't matter whether he was on\nmedication or not on medication. He was saying things\nlike the things Justice Ginsburg has just read.\nMR. STANCIL: Justice Souter, this defendant\nwas rendered competent to stand trial only by\npsychiatric medication; and before taking away the right\nthat is -- that is inherent in the Sixth Amendment, the\njudge has to make a record: Is he still competent to\nstand trial or did he not take his medication this week\nand that's why, that's why he slipped into incoherence?\nIf you try to square these communications\nwith Dr. Sena's report, the report that rendered him\ncompetent to stand trial, it's irreconcilable. Dr.\nSena --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, a great -- frankly, a\ngreat deal of psychiatric testimony is irreconcilable\nwith the facts. Psychiatric testimony can be found for\neither side of any issue in cases like this.\nMR. STANCIL: If that's -- if that's the\ncase, Justice Souter, then there may be an error in the\napplication of Dusky. But -- but once you're over the\nDusky hurdle that says he's lucid enough to understand\nwhat's going on and to make the fundamental --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Stancil, can I ask\nthis question: Do you agree that at a certain point in\nthe trial it could become a farce and the judge could\ndeclare a mistrial for this reason?\nMR. STANCIL: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: If he did so, he's going\nto have a second trial. Could he decide before the\nsecond trial starts that the man has to have a lawyer or\ncould the man still demand the right to self-represent?\nHe's had to proceed -- he spoke to the one -- you know,\none mistrial. It seems to me that under your position\nhe'd have the right to a second bite at the apple.\nMR. STANCIL: No, Your Honor. There would\nbe a record in open court of his --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, you've got a record\nin open court here.\nMR. STANCIL: No, Your Honor, with respect,\nwe do not. We have inconsistent pleadings.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, assume he had a\nrecord in open court before the trial started that was\njust as persuasive as events going sour during a trial.\nMR. STANCIL: Well, again, I respectfully\nsubmit that is not this case. But if you did have it, I\nthink you still have to give him the chance, assuming\nhe's Dusky-competent and he makes this waiver knowingly\nand intelligently, to stand up in court and --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You don't just have a\nrecord in open court. You have the experience of a\ntrial in the past.\nMR. STANCIL: Correct.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's more than just the\nstuff that was on the record. You've had the experience\nof a trial.\nMR. STANCIL: As Justice Brennan's\nconcurring opinion in Illinois versus Allen explains,\nthat sort of misconduct can't --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, Allen was a\ndisruptive conduct case, where he was yelling and he was\nput out of the court.\nThat's quite different from a defendant who\npretends to comply with the order of the court and then\nrepeatedly takes everything off track time after time.\nThat was not Allen and I don't think you can cite Allen\nfor the problem that most of these cases present.\nMR. STANCIL: I respectfully disagree,\nJustice Kennedy. Something is disrespectful toward the\ncourt if it's a repeated violation of the court's\ndirection to keep it on track. And at the same time the\ndefendant is the one, I think it's not to be lost, that\nsuffers the prejudice from these concerns.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, there's a difference\nbetween disrespectful and disruptive. And the Allen\ncase was disruptive. I mean, he was shouting, he was\nyelling. Everything had to stop. That just doesn't\napply to the case we have here. It's inapplicable.\nMR. STANCIL: Well, I agree that Mr. Edwards\n-- the record is clear that he was certainly respectful\ntoward the court. But I think a far more limited\nintrusion on the Sixth Amendment would to be say, if you\ncan't -- if you can't get something out that is\ncomprehensible, that's akin to an Illinois versus Allen\ndisruption; and after a certain record, it can be\nrevoked like the Sixth Amendment right at issue in\nAllen.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Did the trial judge in\nthis case cite the findings and the observations he made\nduring the competency hearing in open court as -- for\nthe support of the ruling?\nMR. STANCIL: He referred seriatim to a list\nof reports that he had considered.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: What about the competency\nhearing that was held in open court with the defendant?\nMR. STANCIL: The -- it's my understanding\nthat the most recent, the actual hearing where he was\nrendered competent, did not have a hearing with it.\nThere was a report from Dr. Sena dated July, '04, and on\nthat basis he was -- I believe there was an\norder rendering --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this one other\nquestion: Do you think the Faretta right includes a\nright to have no standby counsel?\nMR. STANCIL: No, Your Honor. McKaskle made\nthat clear, and it was -- and in fact Faretta makes that\nclear, as well, that the State can protect its interests\nby having somebody right behind ready to stand in. And\nI think --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why do you concede that if\nthe trial is not disruptive, the mere fact that this\nfellow is making an incompetent defense or, indeed, may\nbe making no sense is justification for terminating the\ntrial? I mean, this person can plead guilty if he\nwishes and that's perfectly okay. Can he not take the\nlesser step of putting forward an incompetent defense?\nThe State is still going to have to plead --\nto prove beyond a reasonable doubt before the case goes\nto the jury that he committed the crime that he's\naccused of, beyond a reasonable doubt. And I don't know\nwhy the mere fact that his defense is incompetent or\neven is making no sense would justify -- if that's what\nhe wants to do instead of pleading guilty, that's, it\nseems to me, what the right of an individual consists\nof.\nMR. STANCIL: Justice Scalia, let me make it\nclear that -- I don't know if I've made a concession\nhere. My response was in response to Justice Kennedy's\nquestion about whether Allen is a fit here. I suggested\nand -- and I do believe that at least expanding Allen to\nencompass \"incoherence\" to mean \"disrespect\" would be a\nlesser offense than throwing the baby out with the\nbathwater.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Right.\nMR. STANCIL: But if I may just return to\nthis fundamental --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Your position is it has to\nbe disruptive. If it's not disruptive, even if he's\nmaking no sense, that's his choice, right?\nMR. STANCIL: Yes. However, to be clear,\nthe court can cut him off. So if I -- if a pro se\ndefendant stands up and says, the men from Mar -- you\nknow, in his opening argument says, the men from Mars\ntold me to do this, objection sustained. The court may\ndo it sua sponte and cut it off. Here we're talking\nabout seconds, not minutes --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Of course, one way to\ncontrol these defendants is to say: Mr. Defendant, if\nyou persist in this irrelevant line of inquiry, the\ncourt is going to consider whether or not you are\ncompetent under the Indiana standard to conduct your\nself-defense. That would get his attention.\nMR. STANCIL: It would certainly be\npreferable to what happened here, although I think it\nstill -- I think it still has the problem analytically\nof being inconsistent with the nature of the Sixth\nAmendment. But --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Stancil, I'm not sure\nthat I'm following your argument, Because if I\nunderstand your most recent answers to these questions,\nit is no longer your position that an individual who is\nnot disruptive, but merely incoherent and making the\ntrial farcical by his incoherent responses or actions --\nit is no longer your position that an individual who is\nmerely incoherent could be forced in the midst a trial,\nafter this has been demonstrated, to accept standby\ncounsel to manage the trial. And, yet a moment ago I\nthought that was one of the fail-safe devices that you\nwere arguing for.\nMR. STANCIL: I think -- let me be perfectly\nprecise. I think it has to get to the Illinois versus\nAllen point of being --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So to the disruptive point?\nMR. STANCIL: No. If I may, Your Honor,\nthis is what Illinois versus Allen says, and I think\nthis will elucidate the distinction: \"It has to be so\ndisorderly, disruptive, and disrespectful to the court\nthat his trial cannot go forward.\" So what Illinois\nversus Allen says, we can't have somebody sitting here\nthat --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Somebody who is totally\npolite to the Court, who does not scream and yell, who\ntalks only when he is allowed to talk, but talks total\nand complete nonsense, can never be replaced, in your\nview, by a standby counsel in the middle of the trial\nafter this has been shown to be the way he's acting;\nisn't that correct?\nMR. STANCIL: I believe we're dealing with\n-- two responses.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: How about \"yes\" or \"no\"?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. STANCIL: No, Your Honor. But I believe\nwe are dealing with a null set, because somebody who\ncan't say these things isn't Dusky-competent and hasn't\nmade a knowing and intelligent waiver. If he can't get\ntwo words out to the jury -- and here Mr. Edwards, if\nyou read the oral colloquy --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, now you're falling\nback on the very psychiatric evaluation in the first\npart of the trial that you disparage in the second.\nMR. STANCIL: No, Justice Kennedy. The\nDusky analysis is well settled, and there's a lot of --\nthere's a lot of research that goes into that. He was\nrendered Dusky-competent to make these decisions. But\nthe idea that there's a defendant out there who has this\nrational understanding and enough decision-making\ncapacity under Dusky to plead guilty and to waive any\nnumber of his constitutional rights is the same\ndefendant who turns and says complete gibberish to --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: In your judgment, was the\nDusky determination in this case erroneous?\nShould he have been held incompetent to\nstand trial because of the nonsensical things that\nJustice Ginsburg just read?\nMR. STANCIL: I think the record -- on the\ncurrent state of the record, yes, because his --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: He should have been found\nincompetent.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Except, as you say, we\ndon't know whether he was on his medication or not.\nMR. STANCIL: Correct. This defendant was\nrendered competent after, I think, four and a half years\nof intense -- after a finding of --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I still don't know your\n\"yes\" or \"no\" answer. Do you say he should have been\nfound incompetent or that he should have been competent\nbased on your present assessment of the record?\nMR. STANCIL: I believe it comes and goes.\nThere were times when he was and times when he was not.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Was he competent to stand\ntrial, in your view as you now understand this record?\nMR. STANCIL: At the time of trial, yes, he\nwas. He made, I think, lucid statements to the judge.\nIf I may, the judge asked him at his first trial, well,\nwhat about voir dire? He says, voir dire, that's how\nyou screen out jurors. You get ten charges apiece or\nten strikes apiece. That's perfectly correct. He is\nasked how you admit a videotape into evidence.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: There are all kinds of\nnuts who could get 90 percent on the bar exam.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Stancil, you do agree\nthat the basic precedent on which you rely, Faretta, you\nwould be -- you are asking for an extension of it\nbecause that case starts out with a defendant who is\ndescribed as literate, competent, understanding.\nMR. STANCIL: No, Justice Ginsburg. And, if\nI may explain, that selection from Faretta refers to\nwhether his waiver of counsel was knowing and\nintelligent. It does not refer to whether he is\ncompetent to exercise the right.\nTo the contrary, Faretta specifically\ncontemplates that unskilled, illiterate and those of\n-- and I quote -- \"feeble intellect\" will exercise this\nright.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And was there anything in\nthe record showing that he had, that Faretta had, mental\ndelusions, mental disease?\nMR. STANCIL: Not that I'm aware of, but in\nGodinez there was. This was a defendant who essentially\nvolunteered out of depression -- volunteered for the\ndeath penalty. He waived counsel, pled guilty, and sat\nsilent at the defense table, refusing to put on any\nmitigating evidence while the State sought the death\npenalty.\nAnd this Court held that is not\nfundamentally unfair because he had had the choice --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But the judicial posture\nthere was a little different. It was a question of what\nthe State had to do, not what the State could do.\nMR. STANCIL: Correct, Justice Ginsburg.\nBut the reasoning that the State urges here is precisely\nthe reason -- reasoning that was rejected in Godinez.\nThey said, well, he's not able enough to perform -- this\nis what the defendant said -- I'm not able enough to\nperform these tasks, so you shouldn't have let me do it.\nAnd this Court said -- again if I -- pardon for\nrepeating myself. If I may --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Finish your thought.\nMR. STANCIL: A criminal defendant's ability\nto represent himself has no bearing upon his competence\nfor self-representation.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Stancil.\nMr. Fisher, you have four minutes remaining.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Fisher, what if the\ndefendant here promised to sit silent during the trial\nas the defendant did in Godinez? Would that be -- would\nthat render everything okay?\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS M. FISHER\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. FISHER: Well, I think the defendant in\nGodinez was pleading guilty. I think here if you have a\ndefendant where it might create a different question if\nthere was some reliable that evidence that that might be\ntrue. But it would be hard to imagine that if a trial\ncourt would have to take the defendant's word for it\nentirely, that he would sit silent.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But, he could certainly sit\nsilent. Having decided to represent himself, he could,\nif he wished, just sit silent.\nMR. FISHER: I think it does present a\ndifferent situation if the defendant sits silent and\nrelies only on the reasonable doubt instruction than to\nhave a defendant who is going to present an actual\ndefense.\nHere I think you have got a defendant who,\nwhile competent at the time of trial, the day before, a\nfew days before trial wrote a letter to the court\nsaying: Dear Judge Hawkins, I want to extend the court\npower for training for this enormously wide defense to\nexercise also U.S. continent five as it becomes more\nadvanced parts differently to structure First Amendment.\nTrial to do your best old man to isolate the young boy\nin me at this.\nSo I think we have got a clear example of\nsomeone who could communicate with counsel as the Sena\nreport indicated.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Maybe he writes badly.\nMR. FISHER: Well, no. I think even in the\nstatements in open court you have got a lack of\ncoherence and lack of understanding. And counsel was\nthere, I think, to usher through some of those\nstatements that made system somewhat comprehensible.\nBut there's, I think, every reason for the court to look\nat these writings and to also fall back on what he had\nseen in open court to come to the conclusion that this\nwas somebody who couldn't be relied phenomenon\ncommunicate coherently.\nI think relying on the Allen standard is a\nmistake for the additional reason in addition to not\nspecifically covering this kind of scenario, it also\nmight then lead to circumstances where trial courts are\ntightening up the Allen standard for all defendants\nwhose wish to represent themselves.\nSo even when you don't have concerns about\nthis kind of competency, the courts are going to be in a\nposition where they look at this Court's precedent and\nsay, oh, we're supposed to enforce Allen strictly and we\nhave got a rules violation, so therefore, we have to\noverride the self-representation request. And I think\nthat that's probably not what the Court would want to do\njust to provide that as a vehicle for dealing with\ndependents such as Ahmad Edwards.\nNow, I think it is also important to bear in\nmind that -- that we can speak about fairness in trial\nand the appearance of fairness in trial and not be\nspeaking, strictly speaking about due process, about the\nDue Process Clause. And that's the point of the wheat\ncase. We don't have to think that the State's concerns\nfor fairness are limited by the Due Process Clause. We\ncan acknowledge that there are other circumstances that\ncourts -- that trial courts in states can take into\naccount when they are dealing with Sixth Amendment\nrights. And there, of course, it was the Sixth\nAmendment right --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: How fair does a trial seem\nto the public where the defendant stands up and says,\nYour Honor, I want to represent myself? I do not want\nthis attorney. I want to defend myself. And the judge\nsaid, sit down, we have a psychological evaluation of\nyou. You can't represent yourself.\nHow fair does that seem to the public?\nMR. FISHER: I think it -- I think many in\nthe public would think that that was fair. That, in\nfact, the court is taking care of a defendant in those\ncircumstances.\nNow, that is counterbalanced by the Faretta\nright. But I think courts -- State courts and State\nsystems should be in the position of taking into\nconsideration what they think appears fair in that kind\nof circumstance.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I take it standard\ncompetency principles laid down by this Court require\nthat the defendant be present and that he testify if\nrequested. And the trial judge must question that\ndefendant when competency comes up in the presence of\nthe court.\nMR. FISHER: Right. And I think there are\nopportunities, then, to be concerned about competency\nbased on psychiatric reports that could lead to a Dusky\ndetermination in addition to determination that we're\nseeking.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\n"
