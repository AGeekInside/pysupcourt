AINSA, JR.\nON BEHALF OF PETITIONER\nMR. AINSA: Mr. Chief Justice and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe Defendant, in unequivocal language of\nsection 1346, waives sovereign immunity and permits a\nrefund suit by a third party such as Petitioner. That\nconclusion that I've stated to the Court was supported\nby the holding in United States versus Williams. That\ncase, as the Court well knows, dealt with a situation in\nwhich the Government sought to recover money through a\ntax lien as opposed to a tax levy, which is the\nsituation in this case. However, there is no\nsubstantive difference between the --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And why did the court\npoint out twice in Williams that section 7426 was not\navailable?\nMR. AINSA: Justice Ginsburg, section 7426\nwas not available in the case of Mrs. Williams, but --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Because there was no\nlevy. It was only a lien.\nMR. AINSA: It was a lien case, and of\ncourse, 7426 involves a levy. But nonetheless, the\nholding that I have read in that case very definitively\ndeals with the breadth of section 1346. And the breadth\nof section 1346, according to the holding and United\nStates vs. Williams, is certainly broad enough to\nencompass a third party like Petitioner. I do not view\nthe fact that 7426 was not available to be a controlling\nissue because the question was whether or not 1346 would\npermit a third party to bring a refund action. And that\nwas the holding of the court as I read that opinion.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But when Congress\nprovides a special remedy for a particular class of\npersons, that special remedy usually excludes a more\ngeneral provision.\nMR. AINSA: Justice Ginsburg, in the case of\n7426, Congress never made that remedy expressly\nexclusive. The language is completely missing from that\nstatute. And the argument was raised in United States\nvs. Williams that if section 1346 was made available to\nthird parties, like Mrs. Williams, it would render\nmeaningless the short statute of limitations.\n1346 offers only post deprivation relief.\nsection 7426 offers both pre and post deprivation\nrelief. So the two statutes can live in harmony and can\nbe harmonized and should not be held to have preempt --\none over the other when there is no express declaration\nfrom Congress making that the case.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: The Government does cite\nthe principle that when there's a specific statutory\nscheme that controls over a more general one. It\ndoesn't cite a tax case for that, at least as I recall.\nHas that principle ever been applied in the tax code, do\nyou know?\nMR. AINSA: Justice Kennedy, I don't believe\nthat's been applied in the tax code, but I can answer\nyour question, I think, by saying this. Congress on\nmany instances has made provisions of the United States\nInternal Revenue Code exclusive. Congress knows how to\nwrite those provisions into the tax code when it wants\nto do so. In this case, it was not done.\nAnd I would also like to point out that\nafter the decision in United States vs. Williams,\nCongress amended 7426 to add a special provision. And\nin that special provision, it was made exclusive. And I\nuse that to exemplify the fact that Congress can, when\nit wants to, make a tax provision exclusive.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: In the law, we don't -- we\ncertainly don't want to deprive any statutory provision\nof its whole purpose and effect. And as I understand\nthe purpose of this especially short statute of\nlimitations, it is to enable the Government to dispose\nof the property that it has seized, and to be able to\ngive clear title to it without somebody coming back, you\nknow, many years later and saying this property should\nnot have been taken. How is that purpose served if\nindeed you can proceed under the provision that has a\nlonger statute?\nMR. AINSA: Justice Scalia, 7426 has four\ndifferent components. Two of the components are clearly\npre-deprivation type remedies. They are the ability of\na taxpayer or third party to seek an injunction to\nprohibit the Government from either selling property or\nconducting a levy. Those are clearly pre-deprivation.\nThe other two are primarily post deprivation\nremedies. And so the object that the Government was\ntrying to achieve can be achieved through looking at it\nfrom a pre-deprivation/post-deprivation analysis. I\ndon't believe that the Government's underlying purpose\nis in any way diminished when the two statutes can live\nin harmony. And without having an exclusivity provision\nexpressly stated in 7426, and given the fact that 1346\non its face plainly waives sovereign immunity for third\nparties to bring refund suits, the two statutes must be\nconstrued --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But isn't there this\ndifference between the two. One of them -- you're not\nchallenging the amount of the tax in this case, are you?\nMR. AINSA: Your Honor, I'm sorry. I didn't\nunderstand your question.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: You're not challenging the\namount of the assessed tax, are you? You're just --\nwhether they can collect it from this particular person?\nMR. AINSA: Petitioner is not challenging\nthe underlying assessment against the taxpayer.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And isn't that the basic\ndifference between the two statutes, that one of them\ndeals with a fight about how much money the taxpayer\nowes, and the other one deals with the method of\ncollection.\nMR. AINSA: 7426 clearly prevents a person\nfrom contesting the underlying assessment, whereas in\n1346, that is possible. But in this case, 1346 is broad\nenough because it uses the term collected. And just\nlike in Williams, we are not seeking to contest the\nunderlying assessment.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But it does seem to me if\nyou think of the two statutes as performing rather\nseparate functions, one primarily focused at the method\nof collection, the other the amount of tax, makes quite\ngood sense to have different statute of limitations for\nthe two, because there is an interest in the prompt\nresolution of the former issue that doesn't apply to the\nlatter.\nMR. AINSA: Justice Stevens, there is\ncertainly -- Government has demonstrated by -- or\nCongress has demonstrated by passing 7426, that there is\nan interest in a shorter statute of limitations in\ncertain cases.\nHowever, I return to my original argument\nthat if 1346 is broad enough to encompass third party\nrefund suits, and if Congress has not made 7426\nexclusive, the two statutes should be allowed to\ncoexist. This Court has held on other occasions that it\nwill not preempt statutes without a very clear\nexpression from Congress. And Congress, once again,\nknew how to do it after the Williams case.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I suppose -- tell me\nif I'm wrong, or the Government can tell me if I'm wrong\n-- but there is this difference also that in a refund\nsuit, you have to pay the money. The Government has the\nmoney before you can bring the refund suit. Am I right\nabout that?\nMR. AINSA: That is correct.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Incidentally, I'm just\ncurious, if the underlying assessment -- if you wished\nto have challenged the underlying assessment, it's for a\nmillion dollars, can you pay $100,000 and then bring the\nrefund suit in order to test the validity of the tax, or\ndo you have to pay the whole amount?\nMR. AINSA: The whole amount.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What about the\nunderlying principle that waivers of sovereign immunity\nare strictly construed. And when you have a waiver on\nthe broader statute, but shouldn't you read them\ntogether with the specific to suggest that they weren't\nwaiving sovereign immunity when a more specific statute\ngoverned, except to the extent of the provisions in that\nmore specific statute.\nMR. AINSA: Mr. Chief Justice, when I read\nthe opinion in United States vs. Williams, the Nordic\ncase was brought up by the dissent in that case, that\nthere must be an absolutely unequivocal waiver of\nsovereign immunity in order to allow a particular suit\nagainst the United States. The holding in United States\nversus Williams was that 1346 was sufficiently broad.\nAnd given that holding, and given the fact that the\nGovernment was asserting that Mrs. Williams had other\nremedies in the form of a quiet title action, a refund\naction --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The court took care to\npoint out why those were not realistic remedies. But\nhere there is a prompt and efficient remedy.\nMR. AINSA: Justice Ginsburg, there is\nanother remedy, which is certainly governed by a much\nshorter statute of limitations. But in my view, the\nequities or the facts of the case should not drive the\nconstruction of the statute, any more than it did in\nUnited States versus Williams. And if 1346 is broad\nenough to encompass a third party case in the instance\nof a lien, it is broad enough to encompass it in the\ncase of a levy. There is no functional substantive\ndifference between money taken from a -- from a third\nparty via a lien or via a levy.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, your argument is\nprobably based on the statute. I just question one\nphrase you mentioned, which was that Williams was not\ndriven by the equities. It seems to me it was wholly\ndriven by the equities.\nMR. AINSA: Justice Kennedy, as I read the\nholding in United States vs. Williams, the Court found\nthat there was an unequivocal waiver of sovereign\nimmunity in section 1346. And observed afterwards that\na person like Mrs. Williams did not have a meaningful\nremedy. I did not read that to be -- that the\nconstruction of the statute was driven by the equities.\nIt was an observation after the fact.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: It was a determination\nthat the word taxpayer encompassed someone who had, in\nfact, paid the tax. Here you don't even have that,\nbecause the tax wasn't paid directly by the EC Trust.\nThe trust deposited the money in the bank, and then the\nGovernment levied on it, as distinguished from Williams,\nwhere Mrs. Williams, in fact, wrote a check to the\nInternal Revenue Service covering her husband's tax\nliability.\nMR. AINSA: Justice Ginsburg, I believe that\nboth Mrs. Williams and the trust are in the same\nposition. Both of them paid the tax. Both were third\nparties. Neither was a taxpayer. In the case of\nWilliams, the taxpayer was her husband. In the case of\nthe trust --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, the whole case was\nabout whether she indeed qualified as a taxpayer, having\nvoluntarily paid the tax.\nMR. AINSA: In this case, the levy was an\ninvoluntary act on the part of the Government to take\nthe money from EC Trust, from the deposit that was put\nup.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes. It was an\ninvoluntary act, whereas in Williams, she stepped\nforward and paid the tax and claimed on that basis that\nshe was the taxpayer.\nMR. AINSA: Justice Ginsburg, the situation\nin Williams, however, involved the tax lien.\nMrs. Williams would not have paid the tax had the\nGovernment not asserted the tax lien and forced her to\npay the tax out of the proceeds of the house when it was\nsold. It was no more voluntary than a levy in the sense\nthat I'm talking about.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Why isn't the obvious\ndifference -- I may have missed this -- but you say, in\nthe case, a taxpayer owed some money and the Government\nvia a lien took property from a different person who\nthen had to pay the tax who then had to get rid of the\nlien and wanted it back. And in this case they did\nexactly the same thing but they did it via a levy. So\nyou say if the first could sue so could the second.\nBut the difference, the obvious difference,\nwhich maybe you have explained and I missed, is that in\nthe second case, namely this case, there is a specific\nstatute that says you have to do it with a levy in nine\nmonths, and in the other case there wasn't such a\nstatute. Why isn't that the obvious difference?\nMR. AINSA: Justice Breyer, the answer is\nbecause 1346 also permits a third party to bring a\nrefund action. It is not restricted even though there\nis a specific statute dealing with levies, 1346 was held\nto be broad enough to -- to encompass the refund action.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Encompasses a lien for a\nrefund action in the case where you took the property\nvia a lien. And you'd say -- they say, I guess, but it\ndoesn't encompass it when you take it via a levy. Why\nnot? Because of the specific, the same thing I just\nsaid. Now I want to be sure I have your whole answer to\nthat.\nMR. AINSA: My answer to that is there is no\nsubstantive distinction between a levy and a lien. And\nthat while Williams dealt with a lien, and I fully\nunderstand that, the taking by the Government was just\nas involuntary under the levy as it is with a lien. And\nonce section 1346 is deemed to be broad enough or held\nto be broad enough to encompass a refund action, it\nshould encompass an action by the levy.\nEssentially I'm arguing that the two\nstatutes can coexist together and should coexist\ntogether in the absence of a clear declaration from\nCongress that 7426 is exclusive. I can support my\nargument by the fact that after Williams, Congress did\nmake, did amend 7426 and did make a specific new remedy\nand they're exclusive. Congress could have done that at\nthe time 7426 was originally enacted in 1966 but did not\ndo so.\nJUSTICE BREYER: If your interpretation is\ncorrect then are there many such cases where the\nGovernment takes property via a levy and the person who\nwants to sue would get worried about nine months,\nbecause obviously he would think I can sue under a --\nkind of thing. It's two years. So are there still some\nwhere he would have to worry about nine months?\nMR. AINSA: No.\nJUSTICE BREYER: In other words, are -- in\nyour interpretation, does the nine-month statute become\nmeaningless?\nMR. AINSA: It, it does not become\nmeaningless because 7426 offers certain remedies that\nare clearly post deprivation such as filing for an\ninjunction to stop the levy, filing for an injunction to\nstop a foreclosure. Those are still viable under 7426\nand would fall within the nine-month period but\nessentially Congress has permitted two different\ncomplementary actions to seek a refund.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But you just -- you just\npointed to situations where one to expect action to be\ntaken promptly. You don't want to wait to, to get an\ninjunction against a levy because the Government might\nbe there and levy on the property and then you're out of\nluck. Where the incompatibility exists is post\ndeprivation, when the nine-month, the interest in having\nthese claims resolved properly is totally defeated if\nyou can get the longer statute of limitations under the\ngeneral refund statute.\nMR. AINSA: Justice Ginsburg, if I\nunderstand your question you're really talking about the\nunderlying policy of a short statute of limitations\ndriving certain types of --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: That's why the code has\nthat nine-month period instead of the two-year or in\nfact four-years because you have to go to the\nadministrative process first. The whole purpose of the\nnine-months is to get people to act quickly.\nMR. AINSA: But I can say to you that with\nsome degree, I think, of sound legal argument, that once\n1346 was found to have unequivocally waived sovereign\nimmunity for third party refund actions in the context\nof a lien it should also follow that it waived sovereign\nimmunity for levies because there is no fundamental\nlegal difference between the manner in which the money\nis extracted from the third party. There is no, the\ncore logic of the decision in United States vs. Williams\nis that money was involuntarily taken from Mrs. -- from\nMrs. Williams.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: It doesn't seem to me that\nthe fact that there is a waiver of sovereign immunity\nwith regard to levies answers the statute of limitations\nquestion. Sure, there is a waive of sovereign immunity,\nbut the question is how long does the -- how promptly do\nyou have to act?\nMR. AINSA: Justice Stevens, the -- the\nissue of the statute of limitations I believe is\ndependent upon whether or not 1346 provides for\nremaining a viable method of seeking a refund. And my\nposition is that if 1346 does provide that in the\ncontext of a levy, then you have in effect two statutory\nschemes which coexist; one is 7426 and one is 10 - uh,\n1346. It is true that they overlap in the sense that\nthere is a refund provision that could be sought under\neither one of them, but 7426 is distinctly different in\nthat it offers pre-deprivation relief that is not\noffered under 1326.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Getting back to my earlier\nquestion, if there is a million-dollar tax liability,\nand there is a levy on the bank account for $100,000, do\nyou have to pay the extra 900,000 before can you bring\nthe refund suit?\nMR. AINSA: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So that's, that's also a\ndifference.\nMR. AINSA: Yes. In this case, it wasn't a\nmillion dollars, it was $3 million and the entire amount\nwas paid in order to bring the refund suit.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What if the amount wasn't\npaid and what if your client just sat back and the, the\nassets, or let's say some real estate were, were seized\nby the Government. Would the 1346 action still lie? Or\nis it only for return of money that, that's been paid to\nsatisfy the tax?\nMR. AINSA: 1346 in my view would not apply\nto that situation, in that if property was seized and\nused to, under a tax lien, if that was seized and the\nGovernment proceeded to sell, then the third party,\nPetitioner, would have to file for an injunction to stop\nthe foreclosure sale under 7426.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And that's the, it seems to\nme the principal problem that the Government was facing\nand justified the short statute, wasn't it? That is the\nneed to get, to be able to convey clear title to this\nproperty that it has seized. But once -- once the money\nis put up, and what the Government has taken is in\neffect payment of the tax, maybe there is no harm in\nproceeding under 1346.\nMR. AINSA: Justice Scalia --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I'm helping you.\nMR. AINSA: There is no harm in proceeding\nunder 1346 once the money is paid because you're dealing\nwith a simple refund action. You're not dealing with\ntrying to stop a foreclosure suit or stop a levy.\nYou're dealing with a simple foreclosure action.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but there may\nbe situations where the Government, having levied,\ndoesn't feel the need to pursued other remedies\navailable to it. And if you then allow a challenge to\nthe levy to come in later the person they would have\nproceeded against if they didn't have the levy may have\nleft the country, may have dissipated the funds that\nthey would otherwise go after. They need to know early\non that they are barking up the wrong tree if they have\nlevied on the wrong property, and that's why you have a\nshort statute to clear that up as soon as possible.\nMR. AINSA: Mr. Chief Justice, there is\nrationale for having a short statute, but once again I\npoint out that you have two statutory schemes which\nappear to be able to be harmonized and coexist together.\n1346 constitutes or at least the language is clear and\nunequivocal in its waiver of sovereign immunity for a\nthird party who desires to collect a tax that's been\ntaken from that third party. And with that\nconstruction, it seems to me that only Congress can --\ncan deal with the question that you've just raised, if\nCongress wants to make it.\nJUSTICE BREYER: The -- the, the statute\nthat you point to talks about taking a civil action\nagainst the United States. When there has been a\nwrongful levy, is that right?\nMR. AINSA: 7426.\nJUSTICE BREYER: It doesn't say an\ninjunctive action. So I would reading it think it\nencompasses both actions for injunctions, which are\nrare, probably, and what I think is not rare at all, an\naction for damages or money back. Now your reading of\nthe statute takes that whole ordinary case, where people\nare just suing to get back some money, and it says our\nnine-month statute of limitations here is meaningless.\nAll it applies to are injunctive actions which I bet are\nfar and few between. You can tell me I'm wrong on that.\nMR. AINSA: Okay.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I won't say you've made it\nmeaningless but you have eviscerated it. Is that fair?\nMR. AINSA: Justice Breyer, it is fair. And\nit's fair for this reason, that in the Williams case the\nvery --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I mean, is my\ncharacterization fair?\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: You want to say no to that.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. AINSA: In the Williams case, the very\nsame argument was raised, that 7426 would be rendered\nmeaningless if, and other, the quiet title action and\nother actions would be rendered meanings less if 1346\nwas construed to allow Mrs. Williams to have a third\nparty action.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Why would it have? Because\nthere I think we are talking about liens and it doesn't\ncover liens, the specifics statute.\nMR. AINSA: The Government contended that\nMrs. Williams had remedies available to her, certainly\nnot a levy, because there was no levy, but the\nGovernment was contending she could have sought relief\nunder the Quiet Title Act. She could have sought relief\nby posting --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And the Government -- and\nthe opinion points out that if she had gone the quiet\ntitle route she would have lost the advantageous -- she\nwould have had to make. She could never complete a\nquiet title suit within the time that she needed to\nexecute this sale.\nMR. AINSA: Justice Ginsburg, I, I know\nyou've found that in the opinion. But at the same time\nI'm pointing out that the Government was contending that\nthe Quiet Title Act was available to Mrs. Williams, and\nalso that she could have simply put the money up. And\n-- put the money up, and the land would have been\nreleased and there was an argument over whether the\nsecretary would have discretion to turn her down. But\nthe point is there were other remedies out there, and\nthey were not deemed --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And the, and the opinion\nsuggests -- not merely suggests, determines -- that\nthose other remedies, unlike 7426 in cases where it\napplies, were ineffective. The Government raised other\nremedies and the Court said they were ineffective.\nMR. AINSA: The other remedies I understand\nwere determined to be not meaningful in the opinion of\nthe Court. But I'm pointing out that argument was\nraised and rejected. And it was rejected because,\nbecause 1346 as I understand it has a life of its own,\nso to speak, and it was construed to be an unequivocal\nwaiver of sovereign immunity. And I return to my\noriginal buoyant that if that is the case then the two\nstatutes most coexist together. Mr. Chief Justice, if\nthere are no further questions I would like to reserve\nthe remainder of my time for rebuttal.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel.\nMs. Maynard.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF DEANNE E. MAYNARD,\nON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT\nMS. MAYNARD: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court.\nWhen Congress creates a specific remedy for\na specific situation that remedy forecloses resort to a\nmore general remedy when that general remedy would\nfrustrate the purposes of the specific remedy.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Do you have a citation for\nthat as would apply to the Internal Revenue code?\nMS. MAYNARD: Yes, Your Honor. The A.S.\nKreider decision that we discuss in our brief is about\nwas whether or not the sorter statute of limitations,\nironically, in the case for refund suit, applied, rather\nthan the broad general Tucker Act statute of\nlimitations. And this Court held that the specific\ncontrolled over the general because Congress was\nentitled to provide more specifically in a particular\nsituation when the need called for it.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Was, was the more specific\nstatute there enacted after the more general statute?\nMS. MAYNARD: Both of those statutes, it's\nbeen a long time, Your Honor. I'm not, I'm not totally\n--\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The reason I ask is we --\nwe do have a principle which I think is a sound one,\nthat repeals by implication are not fatal. And what\nyou're saying is that the enactment of the more narrow\nstatute impliedly repeals the cause of action that\nexisted under 1346. Do you know if any of your cases\nthat you cite, even those outside of the Internal\nRevenue field, involve more specific statutes enacted\nafter the general statute that they supposedly limit?\nMS. MAYNARD: I'm not sure if they answer\nthat precise question, but --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I guess --\nMS. MAYNARD: -- the implied repeal analysis\nis not the proper analysis to apply here, because the\nproper principle is that the specific remedy forecloses\nresort to the more general remedy, when two things are\ntrue.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that's certainly true\nwhen the two are enacted at the same time, obviously.\nOr even when the, when the general is enacted after the\nmore specific one and does not thereby limit the more\nspecific one. But, well --\nMS. MAYNARD: In -- in this Court's case, if\nI can answer your, the principle of your question, Your\nHonor, which is that the replied repeal doctrine is not\nthe proper analysis here because the specific controls\nthe general.\nJUSTICE ALITO: If 7426 had not been\nenacted, wouldn't this case have fallen within 1346 as\ninterpreted by Williams.\nMS. MAYNARD: Well, we would certainly have\na more difficult argument here if that were the case,\nYour Honor. But Williams' specific withholding was --\ndidn't answer the question at issue here, because it\nonly held that a person who had been subjected to a\nlien, involuntarily paid it under duress, could be a\ntaxpayer within the meaning of 1346. But it didn't\nanswer the question here, which is whether or not when\nCongress has provided specifically for parties in\nPetitioner's situation and created a remedial scheme\nthat would be wholly frustrated --\nJUSTICE ALITO: What could you point to in\nthe language of 1346 that would take this case outside\nof 1346 as interpreted in Williams?\nMS. MAYNARD: That would be a difficult\nargument to make, that it doesn't fall within the\nerroneously or illegally collected tax. But that was\nthe same case in A.S. Kreider. That was the same\nlanguage in A.S. Kreider, the erroneously collected tax.\nYet the Court held that the more specific refund statute\nof limitations there applied.\nJUSTICE ALITO: But if this case would have\nfallen within 1346 as interpreted by Williams until --\nthen you must be arguing that 1346 was in part impliedly\nrepealed when 7426 was enacted.\nMS. MAYNARD: One can look at it that way,\nYour Honor. But I think if one looks at it that way\nthen I think this Court's cases in Brown and Block are\nhow you apply the implied repeal analysis when a\nspecific statute would be wholly fully frustrated by\napplication of a more general statute. And that's\nparticularly true where it's uncertain at the time\nCongress enacted the specific statute.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I don't, I don't see how\nyou can say there's frustration. Perhaps I'm missing\nsomething. It seems to me that for years the Revenue\nCode has had two basic schemes. One is you can contest\nthe liability before you pay the money. The other is\nyou pay the money and sue for refund. And one requires\nyou go to the Tax Court and the other district court and\nso forth. So these are two different schemes and here\nyou have to -- we are advised that even if there was a\nlevy for $100,000 you, couldn't contest it unless you\npaid the extra 900. So those are two very different\nschemes. Am I wrong about that?\nMS. MAYNARD: Well, they are two very\ndifferent schemes, Your Honor, and one is for the\nsituation that Petitioner faces, which is a third party\nwhose property is levied upon to collect the taxes of\nanother, and it has its own venue provisions, its own\njurisdictional provisions, its own short statute of\nlimitations. Importantly, however --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Of course, because the\nGovernment doesn't have the money. But in the refund\nsuit the Government has the money.\nMS. MAYNARD: No, no, Your Honor. In a levy\nsuit the Government often does have the property.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Often does, but not\nnecessarily, and doesn't have to have all the amount.\nMS. MAYNARD: Not -- I think, Your Honor,\nthe Flora requirement, which is a judicially\ninterpretation on the refund statute which requires you,\na taxpayer to pay all of its tax liability for a given\nyear before it can bring a refund statute challenge,\nactually supports our argument here because it shows how\ncomplicated it would be to apply that scheme when you're\ntalking about a party who doesn't owe the tax. We\nhaven't -- the Government has not assessed the tax\nagainst the trust here. It believes the trust is a\nnominee or alter ego of the taxpayer and the -- the\nwrongful levy statute has a short statute of limitations\nfor the precise reason that if we seize the property of\nthe trust the Government needs to know promptly if the\ntrust claims it's not the taxpayer's property because\nthe Government, as the Chief Justice indicated, will\ncease going after the taxpayer if it believes it has\nalready collected the tax from someone else that it\nbelieves to be holding the money for the taxpayer, which\nis different and crucially different than in a refund\nsuit, as Justice Stevens alluded to, because in a refund\nsuit where the taxpayer brings the challenge and has\npaid the tax, at the end of that suit either the\nGovernment has to pay the money back to the taxpayer in\na refund or the Government gets to keep the tax and\nthat's the end of the matter.\nIn a third party challenge, whether the\nthird party brings it pre- deprivation or\npost-deprivation, the Government's interest is knowing\nwhether or not the third party has taxpayer property or\nnot. Because if it turns out that it's not the\ntaxpayer's property the Government needs to pursue the\ntaxpayer. And Congress accounted for that not only in\n7426 by the short statute of limitations, but also for\nthe expression suspension of the Government's period of\ntime that it can pursue the taxpayer. The, the section\n7426 expressly suspends the time period during the\nrunning of a third party challenge whether that's pre or\npost deprivation.\nIn addition, the -- if I can go back to\nJustice Scalia, I would like to impress upon you why we\ndon't believe the implied repeal doctrine is applicable\nhere, and not only is it because the specific controls\nthe general when it would be wholly frustrated as it\nwould be here by both the statute of limitations\nprovision and its express suspension, but also because\nthe availability of the general remedy was uncertain at\nthe time that Congress passed -- and for the purposes of\nthe implied repeal doctrine that's the proper analysis:\nWhat did the 1966 Congress think it needed to say in\norder to make this the exclusive remedy? The state of\nthe law at the time --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Pre-Williams you're talking\nabout?\nMS. MAYNARD: Yes, in 1966, Your Honor. The\nstate of the law at the time when the Congress was\ndeciding how to write this provision, there was\ncertainly no authoritative pronouncement that, that the,\nthat third parties could bring a suit, and indeed the\nlaw that --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Why does that make your\nargument stronger? If Congress didn't think that 1346\napplied, then surely it didn't intend to repeal it.\nMS. MAYNARD: Well, the cases say it matters\nwhat the Congress saw at the time it passed the statute\nin Brown and Block. But the reason it does matter as a\nlogical matter is that the state of the law was such\nthat third parties couldn't bring a refund suit under\n1346. The actions that had been allowed, Your Honor,\nwere against the IRS officials and those were expressly\nreplaced by the statute. Congress expressly replaced\nthem in section 7426(d) and (e), which is on 12a of our,\nof our petition. So that shows that Congress did intend\nto make this the exclusive remedy.\nThe other reason why I think you can --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Did you make that argument,\ndid the Government make that argument, in Williams?\nMS. MAYNARD: Did we make the argument in\nWilliams?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, that -- that Congress\nhad enacted another statute which presumes that there is\nno cause of action under 1346?\nMS. MAYNARD: Well, the Government conceded\nin Williams that 7426 was not available to Ms. Williams\nthere because she had only been subjected to a lien, not\na levy. So the remedies the Government was pointing to\nin that case as exclusive of the 1346 remedy were the\nquiet title action and a discretionary --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but even if it wasn't\navailable to her, the fact that there was another\nstatute the whole premise for which is the\nunavailability of a remedy under 1346, it seems to me\nthat would have, that would have strengthened the\nGovernment's case in Williams.\nMS. MAYNARD: Well, we did point to the\nstatute, Your Honor, and suggest that the Congress had\nmade it available. I think the other reason why the\nimplied repeal doctrine is not the right analysis here\nis that section 7426 did not withdraw any substantive\nrights. This, the trust here is simply trying to take\nadvantage of another remedial provision, 1346, and\nrename its cause of action. They're bringing exactly\nthe same -- their complaint is substantively identical\nto the complaint they brought in their first action.\nJUSTICE BREYER: It looks like it's the same\nin the Kreider case. I can't tell, I don't know. But\nthis case was a specific statute of limitations acted\nafter the general refund statute, right?\nMS. MAYNARD: That's right, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And in the prior case it\nseems to be a specific statute that was enacted in 1926.\nI just got it out of the library. They give it to us,\nyou know, if you ask them.\nMS. MAYNARD: Bless them, Your Honor.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: And it was the 1926 code\nand it concerned 1926 income, so it must have been\nbrought, the suit, fairly close to when that was\nenacted. And the general provision was a general\njudicial code provision having to do with general\nstatute of limitations and, no, it doesn't say. It\nlooks -- I mean, it sounds as if that had been long in\nexistence.\nMS. MAYNARD: I believe it had been. It was\na Tucker Act provision. Thank you. That would be the\nanswer to your question, Justice Scalia.\nBut in direct response to the question you\nstarted with, Justice Breyer, Congress -- the general\nstatute of limitations for refund actions did already\nexist. In fact, the Government believes it's\nsignificant when Congress passed 7426, instead of\nreferring to that specific provision, it placed in the\nsame section of the code a shorter statute of\nlimitations specifically for these actions. It created\na new subsection and said 7426 actions must be brought\nwithin 9 months.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So why was it so\nhard for them to say that this is an exclusive remedy,\nas they have done in other situations?\nMS. MAYNARD: As I indicated, Your Honor, at\nthe time there was no authoritative pronouncement. If\neven --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's even all the\nmore reason for them to say. I mean. If there's\nconfusion about what remedies are available and they\nwant it to be exclusive, it's easy enough to say that.\nMS. MAYNARD: Well, the remedies that have\nbeen allowed by the courts, Your Honor -- and we\nbelieve, in the absence of any appropriate waiver -- but\nthe actions that have been allowed have been allowed\nagainst IRS officials, and Congress did expressly\nreplace those, on 12a, in 7426(d): \"No action may be\nmaintained against any officer or employee of the United\nStates.\"\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, again that\nsuggests that they know how to spell out exclusivity\nwhen they have it in mind, and they didn't do it with\nrespect to the availability of an action under 1346.\nMS. MAYNARD: That's true, Your Honor. But\nI think for purposes of trying to discern the intent of\nthe 1966 Congress one has to look at the state of the\nlaw in 1966. And there was no reason to believe and\ncertainly no authoritative pronouncement at the time\nthat 1346 covered this type of action, and I don't think\n--\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So the Williams\ndecision came like a bolt out of the blue, then?\nMS. MAYNARD: Well, that's probably how the\nGovernment viewed it, Your Honor. But certainly I don't\nthink one should ascribe for purposes of implied repeal,\nin other words to assume a presumption, by making the\nCongress prescient of what this Court was going to\ndecide in 1995. And I certainly wouldn't concede,\nalthough the Petitioner would like to argue, that\nWilliams' holding is as broad as it is. Williams was\nabout a very particular situation, a woman, as I said,\nwho had a lien placed on her, and the Court didn't\nanswer this question of whether someone who had, as\nJustice Ginsburg indicated, who had a levy placed on\nthere, could be a taxpayer within the meaning of 1346 as\nthis Court held in Williams.\nJustice Kennedy, also on your question about\nthe tax code, although we don't cite it in our brief,\nEstate of Ramani is another case in which this Court had\nin effect held that a specific provision in the tax\ncode, in this very Tax Lien Act, took priority over a\nmore general provision that had to do with the priority\nof the United States' claims. And that's Estate of\nRamani, 525 U.S. 517.\nI believe if there are no further questions,\nthe Government would ask the Court to find that 7426 is\nthe -- except I have one more thing to add. Getting\nlots of help today from all quarters.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Hungar has a\nfurther question.\nMS. MAYNARD: I beg your pardon?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Hungar has a\nfurther question.\n(Laughter.)\nMS. MAYNARD: He wants me to point out to\nthe Court that, in addition to -- it's always nice to\nhave help. In addition to the great American Federal\nSavings & Loan case, Justice Scalia, which indicated\nthat the implied repeal analysis is not appropriate when\nyou're talking about a subsequent simply remedial\nprovision that doesn't withdraw substantive rights, the\nCourt in a case authored I believe by Your Honor, Rancho\nPalos Verdes, in footnote 2 made that same point last\nterm.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I forgot about that\nfootnote.\n(Laughter.)\nMS. MAYNARD: Mr. Hungar might have\nquestioned your memory.\nIf there are no further questions, we would\nask that the Court affirm.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Ainsa, you have 5 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF FRANCIS S. AINSA, JR.,.\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. AINSA: The Government argues that A.S.\nKreider has relevance to this case and I will submit to\nthe Court that it does not. The analysis in A.S.\nKreider about a more specific statute following a\ngeneral statute controlling was based upon the peculiar\nsyntax of the statute in question. The analysis in A.S.\nKreider was that the more general statute was phrased in\nthe negative and that therefore all it did was set an\noutside time limit that Congress was free to shorten\nwith a subsequent statute. We do not have that\nsituation in this case. There was -- there is no\nsimilar analysis that you can apply to 1346 and 7426.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And both statutes in\nKreider I take it applied to the refund suit?\nMR. AINSA: Yes.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So there were two statutes\nbearing on the same remedy.\nMR. AINSA: Two statutes bearing on the same\nremedy. And I submit that the A.S. Kreider analysis is\nnot relevant here.\nThe Government ALSO relies on Brown versus\nthe General Services Administration for the proposition\nthat a very detailed, complete, balanced, structured\nstatute will control over a more general statute, and\nthe argument is of course that 7426 is that type of\nstatute. But the problem is in the Brown case we were\ndealing, the Court was dealing, with the Civil Rights\nAct and the Civil Rights Act was clearly the first piece\nof legislation that had been enacted by Congress to\nremedy Federal employment discrimination. It was a\nbrand new remedy.\nIn the case before the Court today, 7426 was\na response to a particular issue that was raised in 1966\nand that was that claimants who desired to seek redress\nfrom the Government when their property was taken were\nsuing the director. They were suing the tax collector.\nThis was just a statute to give them a remedy directly\nagainst the Government. It wasn't creating a brand new\nsituation. It was clarifying that now you could sue the\nGovernment directly as opposed to the tax collector.\nAnd in fact, the Federal Tax Lien Act prohibited suits\nagainst Government officials, as was previously the\npractice in the United States. And so it's, this issue\nof implied repeal with the shorter statute I don't\nbelieve is apropos to the situation that confronts us\nhere.\nAnd I would like to also simply conclude my\nargument with regards to the Government's contention\nthat the Government needs to know. In this particular\ncase the tax years in question were 1981 through 1984.\nThe Government did not assess the taxpayer until 1993\nand 1994, 12 years after the first tax year. The\ngovernment did not levy until 1999, which was 18 years\nafter the first tax year. During this time the\nGovernment knew, very clearly knew, what the situation\nwas in this case and for whatever reason did not take\nprompt action.\nTherefore, on behalf of the Petitioner, I\nask that you reverse and send this case back to the\ndistrict court for proceedings under the refund statute.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\n"
