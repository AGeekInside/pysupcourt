CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument
first this morning in case 05-1541, EC Term of Years
Trust vs. United States.
Mr. Ainsa.
ORAL ARGUMENT FRANCIS S. AINSA, JR.
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. AINSA: Mr. Chief Justice and may it
please the Court:
The Defendant, in unequivocal language of
section 1346, waives sovereign immunity and permits a
refund suit by a third party such as Petitioner. That
conclusion that I've stated to the Court was supported
by the holding in United States versus Williams. That
case, as the Court well knows, dealt with a situation in
which the Government sought to recover money through a
tax lien as opposed to a tax levy, which is the
situation in this case. However, there is no
substantive difference between the --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: And why did the court
point out twice in Williams that section 7426 was not
available?
MR. AINSA: Justice Ginsburg, section 7426
was not available in the case of Mrs. Williams, but --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Because there was no
levy. It was only a lien.
MR. AINSA: It was a lien case, and of
course, 7426 involves a levy. But nonetheless, the
holding that I have read in that case very definitively
deals with the breadth of section 1346. And the breadth
of section 1346, according to the holding and United
States vs. Williams, is certainly broad enough to
encompass a third party like Petitioner. I do not view
the fact that 7426 was not available to be a controlling
issue because the question was whether or not 1346 would
permit a third party to bring a refund action. And that
was the holding of the court as I read that opinion.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But when Congress
provides a special remedy for a particular class of
persons, that special remedy usually excludes a more
general provision.
MR. AINSA: Justice Ginsburg, in the case of
7426, Congress never made that remedy expressly
exclusive. The language is completely missing from that
statute. And the argument was raised in United States
vs. Williams that if section 1346 was made available to
third parties, like Mrs. Williams, it would render
meaningless the short statute of limitations.
1346 offers only post deprivation relief.
section 7426 offers both pre and post deprivation
relief. So the two statutes can live in harmony and can
be harmonized and should not be held to have preempt --
one over the other when there is no express declaration
from Congress making that the case.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: The Government does cite
the principle that when there's a specific statutory
scheme that controls over a more general one. It
doesn't cite a tax case for that, at least as I recall.
Has that principle ever been applied in the tax code, do
you know?
MR. AINSA: Justice Kennedy, I don't believe
that's been applied in the tax code, but I can answer
your question, I think, by saying this. Congress on
many instances has made provisions of the United States
Internal Revenue Code exclusive. Congress knows how to
write those provisions into the tax code when it wants
to do so. In this case, it was not done.
And I would also like to point out that
after the decision in United States vs. Williams,
Congress amended 7426 to add a special provision. And
in that special provision, it was made exclusive. And I
use that to exemplify the fact that Congress can, when
it wants to, make a tax provision exclusive.
JUSTICE SCALIA: In the law, we don't -- we
certainly don't want to deprive any statutory provision
of its whole purpose and effect. And as I understand
the purpose of this especially short statute of
limitations, it is to enable the Government to dispose
of the property that it has seized, and to be able to
give clear title to it without somebody coming back, you
know, many years later and saying this property should
not have been taken. How is that purpose served if
indeed you can proceed under the provision that has a
longer statute?
MR. AINSA: Justice Scalia, 7426 has four
different components. Two of the components are clearly
pre-deprivation type remedies. They are the ability of
a taxpayer or third party to seek an injunction to
prohibit the Government from either selling property or
conducting a levy. Those are clearly pre-deprivation.
The other two are primarily post deprivation
remedies. And so the object that the Government was
trying to achieve can be achieved through looking at it
from a pre-deprivation/post-deprivation analysis. I
don't believe that the Government's underlying purpose
is in any way diminished when the two statutes can live
in harmony. And without having an exclusivity provision
expressly stated in 7426, and given the fact that 1346
on its face plainly waives sovereign immunity for third
parties to bring refund suits, the two statutes must be
construed --
JUSTICE STEVENS: But isn't there this
difference between the two. One of them -- you're not
challenging the amount of the tax in this case, are you?
MR. AINSA: Your Honor, I'm sorry. I didn't
understand your question.
JUSTICE STEVENS: You're not challenging the
amount of the assessed tax, are you? You're just --
whether they can collect it from this particular person?
MR. AINSA: Petitioner is not challenging
the underlying assessment against the taxpayer.
JUSTICE STEVENS: And isn't that the basic
difference between the two statutes, that one of them
deals with a fight about how much money the taxpayer
owes, and the other one deals with the method of
collection.
MR. AINSA: 7426 clearly prevents a person
from contesting the underlying assessment, whereas in
1346, that is possible. But in this case, 1346 is broad
enough because it uses the term collected. And just
like in Williams, we are not seeking to contest the
underlying assessment.
JUSTICE STEVENS: But it does seem to me if
you think of the two statutes as performing rather
separate functions, one primarily focused at the method
of collection, the other the amount of tax, makes quite
good sense to have different statute of limitations for
the two, because there is an interest in the prompt
resolution of the former issue that doesn't apply to the
latter.
MR. AINSA: Justice Stevens, there is
certainly -- Government has demonstrated by -- or
Congress has demonstrated by passing 7426, that there is
an interest in a shorter statute of limitations in
certain cases.
However, I return to my original argument
that if 1346 is broad enough to encompass third party
refund suits, and if Congress has not made 7426
exclusive, the two statutes should be allowed to
coexist. This Court has held on other occasions that it
will not preempt statutes without a very clear
expression from Congress. And Congress, once again,
knew how to do it after the Williams case.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I suppose -- tell me
if I'm wrong, or the Government can tell me if I'm wrong
-- but there is this difference also that in a refund
suit, you have to pay the money. The Government has the
money before you can bring the refund suit. Am I right
about that?
MR. AINSA: That is correct.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Incidentally, I'm just
curious, if the underlying assessment -- if you wished
to have challenged the underlying assessment, it's for a
million dollars, can you pay $100,000 and then bring the
refund suit in order to test the validity of the tax, or
do you have to pay the whole amount?
MR. AINSA: The whole amount.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What about the
underlying principle that waivers of sovereign immunity
are strictly construed. And when you have a waiver on
the broader statute, but shouldn't you read them
together with the specific to suggest that they weren't
waiving sovereign immunity when a more specific statute
governed, except to the extent of the provisions in that
more specific statute.
MR. AINSA: Mr. Chief Justice, when I read
the opinion in United States vs. Williams, the Nordic
case was brought up by the dissent in that case, that
there must be an absolutely unequivocal waiver of
sovereign immunity in order to allow a particular suit
against the United States. The holding in United States
versus Williams was that 1346 was sufficiently broad.
And given that holding, and given the fact that the
Government was asserting that Mrs. Williams had other
remedies in the form of a quiet title action, a refund
action --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: The court took care to
point out why those were not realistic remedies. But
here there is a prompt and efficient remedy.
MR. AINSA: Justice Ginsburg, there is
another remedy, which is certainly governed by a much
shorter statute of limitations. But in my view, the
equities or the facts of the case should not drive the
construction of the statute, any more than it did in
United States versus Williams. And if 1346 is broad
enough to encompass a third party case in the instance
of a lien, it is broad enough to encompass it in the
case of a levy. There is no functional substantive
difference between money taken from a -- from a third
party via a lien or via a levy.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, your argument is
probably based on the statute. I just question one
phrase you mentioned, which was that Williams was not
driven by the equities. It seems to me it was wholly
driven by the equities.
MR. AINSA: Justice Kennedy, as I read the
holding in United States vs. Williams, the Court found
that there was an unequivocal waiver of sovereign
immunity in section 1346. And observed afterwards that
a person like Mrs. Williams did not have a meaningful
remedy. I did not read that to be -- that the
construction of the statute was driven by the equities.
It was an observation after the fact.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: It was a determination
that the word taxpayer encompassed someone who had, in
fact, paid the tax. Here you don't even have that,
because the tax wasn't paid directly by the EC Trust.
The trust deposited the money in the bank, and then the
Government levied on it, as distinguished from Williams,
where Mrs. Williams, in fact, wrote a check to the
Internal Revenue Service covering her husband's tax
liability.
MR. AINSA: Justice Ginsburg, I believe that
both Mrs. Williams and the trust are in the same
position. Both of them paid the tax. Both were third
parties. Neither was a taxpayer. In the case of
Williams, the taxpayer was her husband. In the case of
the trust --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, the whole case was
about whether she indeed qualified as a taxpayer, having
voluntarily paid the tax.
MR. AINSA: In this case, the levy was an
involuntary act on the part of the Government to take
the money from EC Trust, from the deposit that was put
up.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes. It was an
involuntary act, whereas in Williams, she stepped
forward and paid the tax and claimed on that basis that
she was the taxpayer.
MR. AINSA: Justice Ginsburg, the situation
in Williams, however, involved the tax lien.
Mrs. Williams would not have paid the tax had the
Government not asserted the tax lien and forced her to
pay the tax out of the proceeds of the house when it was
sold. It was no more voluntary than a levy in the sense
that I'm talking about.
JUSTICE BREYER: Why isn't the obvious
difference -- I may have missed this -- but you say, in
the case, a taxpayer owed some money and the Government
via a lien took property from a different person who
then had to pay the tax who then had to get rid of the
lien and wanted it back. And in this case they did
exactly the same thing but they did it via a levy. So
you say if the first could sue so could the second.
But the difference, the obvious difference,
which maybe you have explained and I missed, is that in
the second case, namely this case, there is a specific
statute that says you have to do it with a levy in nine
months, and in the other case there wasn't such a
statute. Why isn't that the obvious difference?
MR. AINSA: Justice Breyer, the answer is
because 1346 also permits a third party to bring a
refund action. It is not restricted even though there
is a specific statute dealing with levies, 1346 was held
to be broad enough to -- to encompass the refund action.
JUSTICE BREYER: Encompasses a lien for a
refund action in the case where you took the property
via a lien. And you'd say -- they say, I guess, but it
doesn't encompass it when you take it via a levy. Why
not? Because of the specific, the same thing I just
said. Now I want to be sure I have your whole answer to
that.
MR. AINSA: My answer to that is there is no
substantive distinction between a levy and a lien. And
that while Williams dealt with a lien, and I fully
understand that, the taking by the Government was just
as involuntary under the levy as it is with a lien. And
once section 1346 is deemed to be broad enough or held
to be broad enough to encompass a refund action, it
should encompass an action by the levy.
Essentially I'm arguing that the two
statutes can coexist together and should coexist
together in the absence of a clear declaration from
Congress that 7426 is exclusive. I can support my
argument by the fact that after Williams, Congress did
make, did amend 7426 and did make a specific new remedy
and they're exclusive. Congress could have done that at
the time 7426 was originally enacted in 1966 but did not
do so.
JUSTICE BREYER: If your interpretation is
correct then are there many such cases where the
Government takes property via a levy and the person who
wants to sue would get worried about nine months,
because obviously he would think I can sue under a --
kind of thing. It's two years. So are there still some
where he would have to worry about nine months?
MR. AINSA: No.
JUSTICE BREYER: In other words, are -- in
your interpretation, does the nine-month statute become
meaningless?
MR. AINSA: It, it does not become
meaningless because 7426 offers certain remedies that
are clearly post deprivation such as filing for an
injunction to stop the levy, filing for an injunction to
stop a foreclosure. Those are still viable under 7426
and would fall within the nine-month period but
essentially Congress has permitted two different
complementary actions to seek a refund.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you just -- you just
pointed to situations where one to expect action to be
taken promptly. You don't want to wait to, to get an
injunction against a levy because the Government might
be there and levy on the property and then you're out of
luck. Where the incompatibility exists is post
deprivation, when the nine-month, the interest in having
these claims resolved properly is totally defeated if
you can get the longer statute of limitations under the
general refund statute.
MR. AINSA: Justice Ginsburg, if I
understand your question you're really talking about the
underlying policy of a short statute of limitations
driving certain types of --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: That's why the code has
that nine-month period instead of the two-year or in
fact four-years because you have to go to the
administrative process first. The whole purpose of the
nine-months is to get people to act quickly.
MR. AINSA: But I can say to you that with
some degree, I think, of sound legal argument, that once
1346 was found to have unequivocally waived sovereign
immunity for third party refund actions in the context
of a lien it should also follow that it waived sovereign
immunity for levies because there is no fundamental
legal difference between the manner in which the money
is extracted from the third party. There is no, the
core logic of the decision in United States vs. Williams
is that money was involuntarily taken from Mrs. -- from
Mrs. Williams.
JUSTICE STEVENS: It doesn't seem to me that
the fact that there is a waiver of sovereign immunity
with regard to levies answers the statute of limitations
question. Sure, there is a waive of sovereign immunity,
but the question is how long does the -- how promptly do
you have to act?
MR. AINSA: Justice Stevens, the -- the
issue of the statute of limitations I believe is
dependent upon whether or not 1346 provides for
remaining a viable method of seeking a refund. And my
position is that if 1346 does provide that in the
context of a levy, then you have in effect two statutory
schemes which coexist; one is 7426 and one is 10 - uh,
1346. It is true that they overlap in the sense that
there is a refund provision that could be sought under
either one of them, but 7426 is distinctly different in
that it offers pre-deprivation relief that is not
offered under 1326.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Getting back to my earlier
question, if there is a million-dollar tax liability,
and there is a levy on the bank account for $100,000, do
you have to pay the extra 900,000 before can you bring
the refund suit?
MR. AINSA: Yes, Your Honor.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: So that's, that's also a
difference.
MR. AINSA: Yes. In this case, it wasn't a
million dollars, it was $3 million and the entire amount
was paid in order to bring the refund suit.
JUSTICE SCALIA: What if the amount wasn't
paid and what if your client just sat back and the, the
assets, or let's say some real estate were, were seized
by the Government. Would the 1346 action still lie? Or
is it only for return of money that, that's been paid to
satisfy the tax?
MR. AINSA: 1346 in my view would not apply
to that situation, in that if property was seized and
used to, under a tax lien, if that was seized and the
Government proceeded to sell, then the third party,
Petitioner, would have to file for an injunction to stop
the foreclosure sale under 7426.
JUSTICE SCALIA: And that's the, it seems to
me the principal problem that the Government was facing
and justified the short statute, wasn't it? That is the
need to get, to be able to convey clear title to this
property that it has seized. But once -- once the money
is put up, and what the Government has taken is in
effect payment of the tax, maybe there is no harm in
proceeding under 1346.
MR. AINSA: Justice Scalia --
JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm helping you.
MR. AINSA: There is no harm in proceeding
under 1346 once the money is paid because you're dealing
with a simple refund action. You're not dealing with
trying to stop a foreclosure suit or stop a levy.
You're dealing with a simple foreclosure action.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but there may
be situations where the Government, having levied,
doesn't feel the need to pursued other remedies
available to it. And if you then allow a challenge to
the levy to come in later the person they would have
proceeded against if they didn't have the levy may have
left the country, may have dissipated the funds that
they would otherwise go after. They need to know early
on that they are barking up the wrong tree if they have
levied on the wrong property, and that's why you have a
short statute to clear that up as soon as possible.
MR. AINSA: Mr. Chief Justice, there is
rationale for having a short statute, but once again I
point out that you have two statutory schemes which
appear to be able to be harmonized and coexist together.
1346 constitutes or at least the language is clear and
unequivocal in its waiver of sovereign immunity for a
third party who desires to collect a tax that's been
taken from that third party. And with that
construction, it seems to me that only Congress can --
can deal with the question that you've just raised, if
Congress wants to make it.
JUSTICE BREYER: The -- the, the statute
that you point to talks about taking a civil action
against the United States. When there has been a
wrongful levy, is that right?
MR. AINSA: 7426.
JUSTICE BREYER: It doesn't say an
injunctive action. So I would reading it think it
encompasses both actions for injunctions, which are
rare, probably, and what I think is not rare at all, an
action for damages or money back. Now your reading of
the statute takes that whole ordinary case, where people
are just suing to get back some money, and it says our
nine-month statute of limitations here is meaningless.
All it applies to are injunctive actions which I bet are
far and few between. You can tell me I'm wrong on that.
MR. AINSA: Okay.
JUSTICE BREYER: I won't say you've made it
meaningless but you have eviscerated it. Is that fair?
MR. AINSA: Justice Breyer, it is fair. And
it's fair for this reason, that in the Williams case the
very --
JUSTICE BREYER: I mean, is my
characterization fair?
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE BREYER: You want to say no to that.
(Laughter.)
MR. AINSA: In the Williams case, the very
same argument was raised, that 7426 would be rendered
meaningless if, and other, the quiet title action and
other actions would be rendered meanings less if 1346
was construed to allow Mrs. Williams to have a third
party action.
JUSTICE BREYER: Why would it have? Because
there I think we are talking about liens and it doesn't
cover liens, the specifics statute.
MR. AINSA: The Government contended that
Mrs. Williams had remedies available to her, certainly
not a levy, because there was no levy, but the
Government was contending she could have sought relief
under the Quiet Title Act. She could have sought relief
by posting --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: And the Government -- and
the opinion points out that if she had gone the quiet
title route she would have lost the advantageous -- she
would have had to make. She could never complete a
quiet title suit within the time that she needed to
execute this sale.
MR. AINSA: Justice Ginsburg, I, I know
you've found that in the opinion. But at the same time
I'm pointing out that the Government was contending that
the Quiet Title Act was available to Mrs. Williams, and
also that she could have simply put the money up. And
-- put the money up, and the land would have been
released and there was an argument over whether the
secretary would have discretion to turn her down. But
the point is there were other remedies out there, and
they were not deemed --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: And the, and the opinion
suggests -- not merely suggests, determines -- that
those other remedies, unlike 7426 in cases where it
applies, were ineffective. The Government raised other
remedies and the Court said they were ineffective.
MR. AINSA: The other remedies I understand
were determined to be not meaningful in the opinion of
the Court. But I'm pointing out that argument was
raised and rejected. And it was rejected because,
because 1346 as I understand it has a life of its own,
so to speak, and it was construed to be an unequivocal
waiver of sovereign immunity. And I return to my
original buoyant that if that is the case then the two
statutes most coexist together. Mr. Chief Justice, if
there are no further questions I would like to reserve
the remainder of my time for rebuttal.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel.
Ms. Maynard.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF DEANNE E. MAYNARD,
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT
MS. MAYNARD: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court.
When Congress creates a specific remedy for
a specific situation that remedy forecloses resort to a
more general remedy when that general remedy would
frustrate the purposes of the specific remedy.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Do you have a citation for
that as would apply to the Internal Revenue code?
MS. MAYNARD: Yes, Your Honor. The A.S.
Kreider decision that we discuss in our brief is about
was whether or not the sorter statute of limitations,
ironically, in the case for refund suit, applied, rather
than the broad general Tucker Act statute of
limitations. And this Court held that the specific
controlled over the general because Congress was
entitled to provide more specifically in a particular
situation when the need called for it.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Was, was the more specific
statute there enacted after the more general statute?
MS. MAYNARD: Both of those statutes, it's
been a long time, Your Honor. I'm not, I'm not totally
--
JUSTICE SCALIA: The reason I ask is we --
we do have a principle which I think is a sound one,
that repeals by implication are not fatal. And what
you're saying is that the enactment of the more narrow
statute impliedly repeals the cause of action that
existed under 1346. Do you know if any of your cases
that you cite, even those outside of the Internal
Revenue field, involve more specific statutes enacted
after the general statute that they supposedly limit?
MS. MAYNARD: I'm not sure if they answer
that precise question, but --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I guess --
MS. MAYNARD: -- the implied repeal analysis
is not the proper analysis to apply here, because the
proper principle is that the specific remedy forecloses
resort to the more general remedy, when two things are
true.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that's certainly true
when the two are enacted at the same time, obviously.
Or even when the, when the general is enacted after the
more specific one and does not thereby limit the more
specific one. But, well --
MS. MAYNARD: In -- in this Court's case, if
I can answer your, the principle of your question, Your
Honor, which is that the replied repeal doctrine is not
the proper analysis here because the specific controls
the general.
JUSTICE ALITO: If 7426 had not been
enacted, wouldn't this case have fallen within 1346 as
interpreted by Williams.
MS. MAYNARD: Well, we would certainly have
a more difficult argument here if that were the case,
Your Honor. But Williams' specific withholding was --
didn't answer the question at issue here, because it
only held that a person who had been subjected to a
lien, involuntarily paid it under duress, could be a
taxpayer within the meaning of 1346. But it didn't
answer the question here, which is whether or not when
Congress has provided specifically for parties in
Petitioner's situation and created a remedial scheme
that would be wholly frustrated --
JUSTICE ALITO: What could you point to in
the language of 1346 that would take this case outside
of 1346 as interpreted in Williams?
MS. MAYNARD: That would be a difficult
argument to make, that it doesn't fall within the
erroneously or illegally collected tax. But that was
the same case in A.S. Kreider. That was the same
language in A.S. Kreider, the erroneously collected tax.
Yet the Court held that the more specific refund statute
of limitations there applied.
JUSTICE ALITO: But if this case would have
fallen within 1346 as interpreted by Williams until --
then you must be arguing that 1346 was in part impliedly
repealed when 7426 was enacted.
MS. MAYNARD: One can look at it that way,
Your Honor. But I think if one looks at it that way
then I think this Court's cases in Brown and Block are
how you apply the implied repeal analysis when a
specific statute would be wholly fully frustrated by
application of a more general statute. And that's
particularly true where it's uncertain at the time
Congress enacted the specific statute.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: I don't, I don't see how
you can say there's frustration. Perhaps I'm missing
something. It seems to me that for years the Revenue
Code has had two basic schemes. One is you can contest
the liability before you pay the money. The other is
you pay the money and sue for refund. And one requires
you go to the Tax Court and the other district court and
so forth. So these are two different schemes and here
you have to -- we are advised that even if there was a
levy for $100,000 you, couldn't contest it unless you
paid the extra 900. So those are two very different
schemes. Am I wrong about that?
MS. MAYNARD: Well, they are two very
different schemes, Your Honor, and one is for the
situation that Petitioner faces, which is a third party
whose property is levied upon to collect the taxes of
another, and it has its own venue provisions, its own
jurisdictional provisions, its own short statute of
limitations. Importantly, however --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Of course, because the
Government doesn't have the money. But in the refund
suit the Government has the money.
MS. MAYNARD: No, no, Your Honor. In a levy
suit the Government often does have the property.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Often does, but not
necessarily, and doesn't have to have all the amount.
MS. MAYNARD: Not -- I think, Your Honor,
the Flora requirement, which is a judicially
interpretation on the refund statute which requires you,
a taxpayer to pay all of its tax liability for a given
year before it can bring a refund statute challenge,
actually supports our argument here because it shows how
complicated it would be to apply that scheme when you're
talking about a party who doesn't owe the tax. We
haven't -- the Government has not assessed the tax
against the trust here. It believes the trust is a
nominee or alter ego of the taxpayer and the -- the
wrongful levy statute has a short statute of limitations
for the precise reason that if we seize the property of
the trust the Government needs to know promptly if the
trust claims it's not the taxpayer's property because
the Government, as the Chief Justice indicated, will
cease going after the taxpayer if it believes it has
already collected the tax from someone else that it
believes to be holding the money for the taxpayer, which
is different and crucially different than in a refund
suit, as Justice Stevens alluded to, because in a refund
suit where the taxpayer brings the challenge and has
paid the tax, at the end of that suit either the
Government has to pay the money back to the taxpayer in
a refund or the Government gets to keep the tax and
that's the end of the matter.
In a third party challenge, whether the
third party brings it pre- deprivation or
post-deprivation, the Government's interest is knowing
whether or not the third party has taxpayer property or
not. Because if it turns out that it's not the
taxpayer's property the Government needs to pursue the
taxpayer. And Congress accounted for that not only in
7426 by the short statute of limitations, but also for
the expression suspension of the Government's period of
time that it can pursue the taxpayer. The, the section
7426 expressly suspends the time period during the
running of a third party challenge whether that's pre or
post deprivation.
In addition, the -- if I can go back to
Justice Scalia, I would like to impress upon you why we
don't believe the implied repeal doctrine is applicable
here, and not only is it because the specific controls
the general when it would be wholly frustrated as it
would be here by both the statute of limitations
provision and its express suspension, but also because
the availability of the general remedy was uncertain at
the time that Congress passed -- and for the purposes of
the implied repeal doctrine that's the proper analysis:
What did the 1966 Congress think it needed to say in
order to make this the exclusive remedy? The state of
the law at the time --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Pre-Williams you're talking
about?
MS. MAYNARD: Yes, in 1966, Your Honor. The
state of the law at the time when the Congress was
deciding how to write this provision, there was
certainly no authoritative pronouncement that, that the,
that third parties could bring a suit, and indeed the
law that --
JUSTICE ALITO: Why does that make your
argument stronger? If Congress didn't think that 1346
applied, then surely it didn't intend to repeal it.
MS. MAYNARD: Well, the cases say it matters
what the Congress saw at the time it passed the statute
in Brown and Block. But the reason it does matter as a
logical matter is that the state of the law was such
that third parties couldn't bring a refund suit under
1346. The actions that had been allowed, Your Honor,
were against the IRS officials and those were expressly
replaced by the statute. Congress expressly replaced
them in section 7426(d) and (e), which is on 12a of our,
of our petition. So that shows that Congress did intend
to make this the exclusive remedy.
The other reason why I think you can --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Did you make that argument,
did the Government make that argument, in Williams?
MS. MAYNARD: Did we make the argument in
Williams?
JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, that -- that Congress
had enacted another statute which presumes that there is
no cause of action under 1346?
MS. MAYNARD: Well, the Government conceded
in Williams that 7426 was not available to Ms. Williams
there because she had only been subjected to a lien, not
a levy. So the remedies the Government was pointing to
in that case as exclusive of the 1346 remedy were the
quiet title action and a discretionary --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but even if it wasn't
available to her, the fact that there was another
statute the whole premise for which is the
unavailability of a remedy under 1346, it seems to me
that would have, that would have strengthened the
Government's case in Williams.
MS. MAYNARD: Well, we did point to the
statute, Your Honor, and suggest that the Congress had
made it available. I think the other reason why the
implied repeal doctrine is not the right analysis here
is that section 7426 did not withdraw any substantive
rights. This, the trust here is simply trying to take
advantage of another remedial provision, 1346, and
rename its cause of action. They're bringing exactly
the same -- their complaint is substantively identical
to the complaint they brought in their first action.
JUSTICE BREYER: It looks like it's the same
in the Kreider case. I can't tell, I don't know. But
this case was a specific statute of limitations acted
after the general refund statute, right?
MS. MAYNARD: That's right, Your Honor.
JUSTICE BREYER: And in the prior case it
seems to be a specific statute that was enacted in 1926.
I just got it out of the library. They give it to us,
you know, if you ask them.
MS. MAYNARD: Bless them, Your Honor.
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE BREYER: And it was the 1926 code
and it concerned 1926 income, so it must have been
brought, the suit, fairly close to when that was
enacted. And the general provision was a general
judicial code provision having to do with general
statute of limitations and, no, it doesn't say. It
looks -- I mean, it sounds as if that had been long in
existence.
MS. MAYNARD: I believe it had been. It was
a Tucker Act provision. Thank you. That would be the
answer to your question, Justice Scalia.
But in direct response to the question you
started with, Justice Breyer, Congress -- the general
statute of limitations for refund actions did already
exist. In fact, the Government believes it's
significant when Congress passed 7426, instead of
referring to that specific provision, it placed in the
same section of the code a shorter statute of
limitations specifically for these actions. It created
a new subsection and said 7426 actions must be brought
within 9 months.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So why was it so
hard for them to say that this is an exclusive remedy,
as they have done in other situations?
MS. MAYNARD: As I indicated, Your Honor, at
the time there was no authoritative pronouncement. If
even --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's even all the
more reason for them to say. I mean. If there's
confusion about what remedies are available and they
want it to be exclusive, it's easy enough to say that.
MS. MAYNARD: Well, the remedies that have
been allowed by the courts, Your Honor -- and we
believe, in the absence of any appropriate waiver -- but
the actions that have been allowed have been allowed
against IRS officials, and Congress did expressly
replace those, on 12a, in 7426(d): "No action may be
maintained against any officer or employee of the United
States."
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, again that
suggests that they know how to spell out exclusivity
when they have it in mind, and they didn't do it with
respect to the availability of an action under 1346.
MS. MAYNARD: That's true, Your Honor. But
I think for purposes of trying to discern the intent of
the 1966 Congress one has to look at the state of the
law in 1966. And there was no reason to believe and
certainly no authoritative pronouncement at the time
that 1346 covered this type of action, and I don't think
--
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So the Williams
decision came like a bolt out of the blue, then?
MS. MAYNARD: Well, that's probably how the
Government viewed it, Your Honor. But certainly I don't
think one should ascribe for purposes of implied repeal,
in other words to assume a presumption, by making the
Congress prescient of what this Court was going to
decide in 1995. And I certainly wouldn't concede,
although the Petitioner would like to argue, that
Williams' holding is as broad as it is. Williams was
about a very particular situation, a woman, as I said,
who had a lien placed on her, and the Court didn't
answer this question of whether someone who had, as
Justice Ginsburg indicated, who had a levy placed on
there, could be a taxpayer within the meaning of 1346 as
this Court held in Williams.
Justice Kennedy, also on your question about
the tax code, although we don't cite it in our brief,
Estate of Ramani is another case in which this Court had
in effect held that a specific provision in the tax
code, in this very Tax Lien Act, took priority over a
more general provision that had to do with the priority
of the United States' claims. And that's Estate of
Ramani, 525 U.S. 517.
I believe if there are no further questions,
the Government would ask the Court to find that 7426 is
the -- except I have one more thing to add. Getting
lots of help today from all quarters.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Hungar has a
further question.
MS. MAYNARD: I beg your pardon?
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Hungar has a
further question.
(Laughter.)
MS. MAYNARD: He wants me to point out to
the Court that, in addition to -- it's always nice to
have help. In addition to the great American Federal
Savings & Loan case, Justice Scalia, which indicated
that the implied repeal analysis is not appropriate when
you're talking about a subsequent simply remedial
provision that doesn't withdraw substantive rights, the
Court in a case authored I believe by Your Honor, Rancho
Palos Verdes, in footnote 2 made that same point last
term.
JUSTICE SCALIA: I forgot about that
footnote.
(Laughter.)
MS. MAYNARD: Mr. Hungar might have
questioned your memory.
If there are no further questions, we would
ask that the Court affirm.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
Mr. Ainsa, you have 5 minutes remaining.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF FRANCIS S. AINSA, JR.,.
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. AINSA: The Government argues that A.S.
Kreider has relevance to this case and I will submit to
the Court that it does not. The analysis in A.S.
Kreider about a more specific statute following a
general statute controlling was based upon the peculiar
syntax of the statute in question. The analysis in A.S.
Kreider was that the more general statute was phrased in
the negative and that therefore all it did was set an
outside time limit that Congress was free to shorten
with a subsequent statute. We do not have that
situation in this case. There was -- there is no
similar analysis that you can apply to 1346 and 7426.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: And both statutes in
Kreider I take it applied to the refund suit?
MR. AINSA: Yes.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: So there were two statutes
bearing on the same remedy.
MR. AINSA: Two statutes bearing on the same
remedy. And I submit that the A.S. Kreider analysis is
not relevant here.
The Government ALSO relies on Brown versus
the General Services Administration for the proposition
that a very detailed, complete, balanced, structured
statute will control over a more general statute, and
the argument is of course that 7426 is that type of
statute. But the problem is in the Brown case we were
dealing, the Court was dealing, with the Civil Rights
Act and the Civil Rights Act was clearly the first piece
of legislation that had been enacted by Congress to
remedy Federal employment discrimination. It was a
brand new remedy.
In the case before the Court today, 7426 was
a response to a particular issue that was raised in 1966
and that was that claimants who desired to seek redress
from the Government when their property was taken were
suing the director. They were suing the tax collector.
This was just a statute to give them a remedy directly
against the Government. It wasn't creating a brand new
situation. It was clarifying that now you could sue the
Government directly as opposed to the tax collector.
And in fact, the Federal Tax Lien Act prohibited suits
against Government officials, as was previously the
practice in the United States. And so it's, this issue
of implied repeal with the shorter statute I don't
believe is apropos to the situation that confronts us
here.
And I would like to also simply conclude my
argument with regards to the Government's contention
that the Government needs to know. In this particular
case the tax years in question were 1981 through 1984.
The Government did not assess the taxpayer until 1993
and 1994, 12 years after the first tax year. The
government did not levy until 1999, which was 18 years
after the first tax year. During this time the
Government knew, very clearly knew, what the situation
was in this case and for whatever reason did not take
prompt action.
Therefore, on behalf of the Petitioner, I
ask that you reverse and send this case back to the
district court for proceedings under the refund statute.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,
Mr. Ainsa. The case is submitted.

above-entitled matter was submitted.]
