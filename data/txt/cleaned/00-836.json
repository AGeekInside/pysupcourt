Mr. Olson.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON\nON BEHALF OF PETITIONER\nMR. OLSON: And may it please the Court: Two\nweeks after the November 7 presidential election, the\nFlorida Supreme Court overturned and materially rewrote\nportions of the carefully formulated set of laws enacted\nby Florida's legislature to govern the conduct of that\nelection and the determination of controversies with\nrespect to who prevailed on November 7th. These laws have\nbeen formulated by the Florida legislature pursuant to an\nexpress delegation of authority, to wit, by the United\nStates Constitution. The election code that the Florida\nlegislature developed conformed to Title 3, Section 5 of\nthe United States Code. That provision invites states to\ndevise rules in advance of an election, to govern the\ncounting of votes and the settling of election\ncontroversy.\nQUESTION: Well, Mr. Olson, isn't Section 5 sort\nof a safe harbor provision for states, and do you think\nthat it gives some independent right of a candidate to\noverturn a Florida decision based on that section?\nMR. OLSON: We do, Justice O'Connor. It is a\nsafe harbor, but it's more than that. And Section 5 of\nTitle 3 needs to be construed in connection with the\nhistory that brought it forth --\nQUESTION: Yes. But I would have thought it was\na section designed in the case of, some election contest\nends up before the Congress, a factor that the Congress\ncan look at in resolving such a dispute. I just don't\nquite understand how it would be independently\nenforceable.\nMR. OLSON: That's why I've mentioned the\ncontext in which that section was adopted. In light of\nthe extreme controversy that was faced by this country as\na result of the 1876 election, and as this Court knows,\nthat election was very close and led to controversy,\ncontest, discord, Congress was very much concerned about\nthe possibility of that happening again, and one of the\nreasons --\nQUESTION: Yeah, but what they did was, and it's\ntypical of grant-in-aid programs, they said if you run a\nclean shop down there, we'll give you a bonus, and if you\ndon't, well, you take your chances with everybody else.\nMR. OLSON: Justice Kennedy, I submit that it is\nmuch like a compact that Congress is offering in the form\nof Section 5, yes. If you do these things, certain things\nwill happen. But among these things, what Congress wanted\nto accomplish with Section 5 was not only to provide the\nbenefit to the states, but to provide the benefit to the\nUnited States of the states accepting that implicit\nproposal.\nQUESTION: But what is there in the opinion of\nthe Supreme Court of Florida that indicates that it relied\non this Federal statute in the reasoning for its decision\nand in its judgment?\nMR. OLSON: Well, I think the fact is that it\ndid not. What it did was it disregarded the compact.\nWhen the state adopted a code of ethics, or a code of\nelection procedures to govern the election and the\ndetermination of disputes pursuant to the election, it\nbrought itself into that safe harbor and guaranteed to the\nvoters and the candidates in that state that the\ncontroversy and turmoil that infected this country after\nthe 1876 --\nQUESTION: Well, we are looking for a Federal\nissue, and I thought that you might have argued that the\nSecretary of State was instructed by the Supreme Court not\nto jeopardize the state's chances and then cited 3 U.S.C.\nSections 1 through 10. And so if the, if the state\nsupreme court relied on a Federal issue or a Federal\nbackground principle and got it wrong, then you can be\nhere.\nMR. OLSON: Well, I certainly agree that it\nmentioned those provisions. I'm simply saying that it\nblew past the important provisions of Section 5 and the\nbenefits that Section 5 gives to the states to the voters\nin that state and to the people running for office in that\nstate. That is to say that if the rules are complied\nwith, if disputes are resolved according to the rules that\nare set forth, then not only will the electors chosen by\nthe voters in that state be given conclusive effect at the\ntime they are counted by Congress but we will not have the\ncontroversy, dispute and chaos that's been taking place in\nFlorida.\nQUESTION: Mr. Olson, suppose a less, a less\ncontroversial Federal benefit scheme, let's say the scheme\nthat says states can get highway funds if, if they hold\ntheir highway speeds to a certain level, all right? And\nsuppose you have a state supreme court that in your view\nunreasonably interprets a state statute as not holding\nhighway speed to the level required in order to get the\nbenefit of that safe harbor. Would you think that that\nraises a Federal question and that you could appeal the\nstate court decision here because it deprived the state of\nthe benefit of the highway funds?\nMR. OLSON: No, I don't think so.\nQUESTION: Why is this any different?\nMR. OLSON: This is a great deal different\nbecause this is -- first of all, Article II of the\nConstitution which vests authority to establish the rules\nexclusively in the legislatures of the state, tie in with\nSection 5. Secondly, as this Court has stated --\nQUESTION: Well, let's just talk about Section\n5. I mean, the constitutional question's another one.\nWhy is Section 5 in that regard any different from the\nhighway funding?\nMR. OLSON: I think it -- I think it can't be\ndivorced from Article II of the Constitution because it's\na part of a plan for the vesting in the legislatures of a\nstate, and Section 5 implements Article II in the sense\nthat it provides a benefit not just to the state but to\nthe voters.\nQUESTION: But just talk about the statutory\nissue. I assume that if we worked long enough with\nJustice Scalia's hypothetical, we could find a case where\na court adjudicated with reference to the Federal\nprinciple and got the Federal principle wrong. Did --\nIndiana vs. Brand and that kind of thing. Did that happen\nhere?\nMR. OLSON: Well, I think that the state did not\npay, the state supreme court did not pay much attention to\nthe Federal statute. It was obviously aware of it. It\ndid get the Federal principle --\nQUESTION: Well, then there is no Federal\nconstitutional issue here.\nMR. OLSON: Well, there is a Federal--\nQUESTION: Pardon me, statutory issue.\nMR. OLSON: Well, we believe that there is,\nJustice Kennedy, because although the state recognized it,\nit blew right past it. The state legislature adopted the\ncode that the Section 5 of Article 3 of Title 3 invited it\nto do. The state supreme court, which had no right under\nthe Constitution, but I can't divorce the constitutional\nprovision from Section 5, then overturned the plan that\nthe state enacted through its legislature to make sure\nthat what happened down in Florida was not going to\nhappen. And so what the state supreme court did, knowing\nfull well that these provisions existed, overturned the\ncarefully enacted plan by Florida.\nQUESTION: Mr. Olson, do you think that Congress\nwhen it passed 3 U.S. Code, intended that there would be\nany judicial involvement? I mean, it seems to me it can\njust as easily be read as a direction to Congress, saying\nwhat we are going to do when these electoral votes are\npresented to us for counting.\nMR. OLSON: I think that it was intend --\ndirected to Congress, but it seems to me that in the\ncontext in which it was adopted and the promise that it\nafforded, that the conclusive effect would be given to the\nstate selection of electors, that is a somewhat empty\nremedy and it doesn't accomplish Congress' objectives if\nit cannot be enforced when an agency of the state\ngovernment steps in as the Florida Supreme Court did here\nand overturn the plan by which the Florida legislature\ncarefully set forth a program so that disputes could be\nresolved, and we wouldn't have the controversy, conflict\nand chaos that we submit exists today in Florida.\nQUESTION: Mr. Olson, your -- your submission is\nbased on the premise that the Florida court overturned\nsomething that the statute did not. Is it not arguable, at\nleast, that all they did was fill gaps that had not been\naddressed before?\nMR. OLSON: Justice Stevens, I don't think that\nin this case that's even remotely arguable. What the state\nsupreme court did is take a set of timetables, a set of\nprovisions that --\nQUESTION: Yes. And the first one was the\nmandatory -- is it your view still that the shall date\ncontrols in all respects?\nMR. OLSON: No. Not necessarily. But the 102\n-- there is the two provisions, Section 102.111 and\n102.112. 111 contains the shall date, 102 contains the\nmay date.\nQUESTION: Correct.\nMR. OLSON: Both of those statutes, both of\nthose provisions say that the returns must be, or shall be\nfiled by a certain deadline. The shall and the may\nprovisions simply relate to the possible remedy. We\nsubmit that under either interpretation the Secretary of\nState of Florida either must or shall ignore those\nreturns, or may set those aside in her discretion.\nQUESTION: Does that mean if there were an act\nof God that prevented the returns from being filed that\nshe would have discretion either to accept or reject the\nreturns?\nMR. OLSON: Yes, I believe --\nQUESTION: She would have the discretion?\nMR. OLSON: Yes.\nQUESTION: Would she be compelled in that event\nto accept the returns?\nMR. OLSON: I don't think so. She took the\nposition --\nQUESTION: She has the total discretion either\nto accept or reject?\nMR. OLSON: That's --\nQUESTION: Is there any circumstance in which\nshe would be compelled to accept a late return?\nMR. OLSON: I don't know of any. I haven't\nthought of any, Justice Stevens.\nQUESTION: Well, you are arguing in effect that\nit's a mandatory deadline. I wonder if you really mean\nit's mandatory.\nMR. OLSON: Well, the problem is that it's --\nwhat we are saying is that either it's mandatory, in which\ncase she could not accept them.\nQUESTION: But you don't know whether it's\nmandatory or not?\nMR. OLSON: Well, the Florida Supreme Court and\nwhat the circuit court did in that case, it said that it\nwasn't -- and we'll accept this for purposes of this\nargument that it wasn't --\nQUESTION: Yes, but one of the things that's of\ninterest to me is the extent to which you say there was a\nchange in the law. It seems to me that in order to answer\nthat question you have to know what your view of the law\nwas before this all happened.\nMR. OLSON: I think that we can answer that this\nway, is that whether it was shall ignore or may ignore.\nIt was not must accept.\nQUESTION: Under any circumstance it was not\nmust?\nMR. OLSON: No, under no circumstances was it\nmust accept. Now --\nQUESTION: Even in an act of God or fraud?\nMR. OLSON: I don't believe so, Justice Stevens.\nQUESTION: Okay.\nQUESTION: Mr. --\nQUESTION: Isn't the law in Florida like as in\nmost states, and in the Federal government, that when an\nofficial has discretion, may accept or may not accept,\nthat has to be exercised within the limits of reason?\nMR. OLSON: Yes.\nQUESTION: Well, then, isn't it possible that\nwhen the court says she must accept under certain\ncircumstances, what they mean is outside those\ncircumstances, given the circumstances here it would be\nunreasonable to refuse?\nMR. OLSON: Well, what the court did was so\nconstrain those circumstances, virtually to make them\nnonexistent.\nQUESTION: All right. So then what you're\narguing about is a determination by the state court of\nFlorida as to what the circumstances are under state law\nwhere the action of a state official would or would not be\nreasonable.\nMR. OLSON: I think that -- yes, but I think\nthat it has to be looked at in the context in which that\nwas done when the state supreme court so constrained and\nsays in its opinion shall accept these late returns until\n5 p.m. on November 26th, and in the context there was no\ndiscretion left for the Secretary of State at all.\nQUESTION: Mr. Olson, may I ask you, because\nyou've been skipping over what I thought was a key piece\nof the Florida legislation. The Florida Supreme Court\nsaid, there's the deadline, and that conflicts with\nanother provision of this law, the provision that says\nthere shall be under certain circumstances recounts, and\nthen there's a rather detailed description of the process\nthat's necessary, the time line for when you can ask the\nrecount is on the 6th day.\nMR. OLSON: Up to.\nQUESTION: Yeah, up to. And it would be\nimpossible in a populous county to in one day do what the\nstatute instructs must be done when there's a recount.\nThe Florida Supreme Court said, it's right in its opinion,\nthere's two conflicts, and the first one they mention\nstraight out on page 21A of your appendix, is that there\nhas to be a reconciliation between this, yes, there can be\nrecounts and, yes, there's a deadline. So they are trying\nto reconcile two provisions.\nMR. OLSON: The first part of the recount\nprovision to which you're referring, Justice Ginsburg,\nsays may conduct a recount. Under certain circumstances\nafter the sampling part of that process is taken, if it's\ntaken in the county canvassing board's discretion, then\nunder certain circumstances it's supposed to go forward\nwith a more fulsome process, but the legislature being\nfully aware of the recount provisions and the importance\nof -- this ties in with the protest period for the\nelection, which overlaps the recount provisions, and the\ncontest provision for the election, and the fact that all\nof this has to be done in the context of a presidential\nelection.\nUnder any other kind of election, these things\nwouldn't be nearly as important, but we have very\nimportant timetables, and as this Court has said a\npresidential election is so important to the rest of the\nnation, and there is such high Federal interest in\naccomplishing these things in the right way, what the\nFlorida legislature did is balance the protest period, the\nrecount period with the contest period, and state that\nthere shall be certain deadlines before which certain\nthings need to be done and after which, so what those two\nstatutes say is that there may be a recount, but that\nthere shall be compliance with the time deadline. It also\nsays that --\nQUESTION: But that's something that one can\ncertainly argue. My problem is, one could also argue what\nthe Florida Supreme Court said, and I do not know of any\ncase where we have impugned a state supreme court the way\nyou are doing in this case. I mean, in case after case we\nhave said we owe the highest respect to what the state\nsays, state supreme court says, is the state's law.\nMR. OLSON: This is a very unusual situation,\nJustice Ginsburg, because it is in the context of a\npresidential election, and it is in the context of Federal\nrights. This Court has, in the areas in which we've\ndescribed in our brief, undertaken to review the meaning\nand the effect that the state supreme court or state court\ndecision under certain circumstances. We submit this is\none. What the Florida Supreme --\nQUESTION: But I said, and even in the very\ncases that you cite, because I checked them, that we owe\nthe highest respect to the state court when it says what\nthe state law is.\nMR. OLSON: Yes, but then the Court has also\nsaid, then we go on to see the extent to which what the\nstate court did, as we cited in the Lindsey case, for\nexample, in the ex post facto context, we go on to see\nwhat the import of that is in connection with the Federal\nright. I would emphasize that what the Florida Supreme\nCourt did is basically essentially say, we're rewriting\nthe statute, we're changing it.\nQUESTION: Does the Secretary have any\nflexibility to accommodate the statute to the exigencies\nwas presidential election? The Secretary of State.\nMR. OLSON: The Secretary of State did. It\ndoesn't -- she doesn't much anymore because what has\nhappened -- and I would like to finish that one point,\nthat the Florida Supreme Court said we are not going to be\nbound by technical statutory requirements or what the\nsupreme court called hyper-technical statutory\nrequirements. Instead, we are going to resort to the will\nof the people, the will of the electorate, the will of the\nvoters, so to speak, and we are going to -- because we\ncan't rewrite the statute, but we are going to partially\nrewrite the statute, we are going to resort to our\nequitable powers. So what -- and among the things that\nthe court did, and there are a range of them, as I have\nindicated, they took away the discretion of the Secretary\nand instructed her to accept these manual recount returns.\nQUESTION: Mr. Olson, on the equitable powers,\nthey were doing that in setting a new deadline, and I\ndon't think you would argue the case would have been more\nacceptable if there had been no deadline?\nMR. OLSON: No, it wouldn't have been, but --\nQUESTION: And on the fight between may and\nshall, they relied on four traditional canons of statutory\nconstruction and not equity at all.\nMR. OLSON: They recited four canons of\nstatutory construction, Justice Stevens, but when they\nsaid they use those construction -- canons of statutory\nconstruction to say that the words may and shall mean\nshall not, that is not a reasonable exercise of statutory\nconstruction. I think what the -- it's relatively obvious\nthat what the supreme court did is exactly what Article --\nSection 5 of Article III intends not to happen. Change\nthe rules.\nQUESTION: I don't read their opinion that way,\nMr. Olson. It seems to me that the portion of their\nopinion dealing with statutory construction ends with a\nconclusion that the Secretary has discretion. The portion\nof the opinion employing the canons of construction does\nnot place any limits upon the Secretary's discretion.\nMR. OLSON: Well, yes, I agree with that up to a\npoint, but then it says that she must accept these returns\nthat are after the deadline.\nQUESTION: That was not on the basis of any\ncanons of statutory construction. That was on the basis\nof the state's constitution.\nMR. OLSON: That's right, but -- so there was\nboth going on, and what the court was bound and determined\nto do was to get to a consequence that the court\ndetermined was consistent with the will of the people,\nirrespective of what the statute --\nQUESTION: Mr. Olson, would you agree that when\nwe read a state court decision, we should read it in the\nlight most favorable to the integrity of the state supreme\ncourt, that if there are two possible readings, one that\nwould impute to that court injudicial behavior, lack of\nintegrity, indeed dishonesty, and the other one that would\nread the opinion to say we think this court is attempting\nto construe the state law -- it may have been wrong, we\nmight have interpreted it differently, but we are not the\narbiters, they are.\nMR. OLSON: I would like to answer that in two\nways. In the first place, I don't mean to suggest, and I\nhope my words didn't, that there was a lack of integrity\nor any dishonesty by the Florida Supreme Court. What\nwe're saying, that it was acting far outside the scope of\nits authority in connection with an exercise of power that\nis vested by the Constitution of the United States --\nQUESTION: But if it tells us -- if it tells us,\nwe see these two provisions in conflict, they need to be\nreconciled.\nMR. OLSON: But -- under almost any other\ncircumstances, yes, Justice Ginsburg, but in this context,\nin this context, we are talking about a Federal right, a\nFederal constitutional right, and the rights of individual\ncitizens under the Constitution and so therefore, this\nCourt has a grave responsibility to look --\nQUESTION: Mr. Olson, I'd like to get focused a\nlittle more on this same area. If it were purely a matter\nof state law, I suppose we normally would leave it alone\nwhere the state supreme court found it, and so you\nprobably have to persuade us there is some issue of\nFederal law here. Otherwise, why are we acting?\nMR. OLSON: Yes.\nQUESTION: And are you relying in that regard on\nTitle 2? I mean, would you like to -- Article II? Would\nyou like to characterize the Federal issue that you think\ngoverns this?\nMR. OLSON: Well, we are very definitely relying\non Article II of the Constitution. The framers of the\nConstitution debated long and hard. It was one of the\nlongest debates that took place during the formation of\nthe Constitution. Where should this power be lodged, in\nthe Federal legislature, in the state legislature, at the\nballot booth or what. The one thing that was discussed\nand rejected by virtually everyone is that the power to\nselect the manner in which electors would be appointed\nwould be in the state judiciary, and we quote -- in the\nstate judiciary. That was rejected.\nThe notion that it would be vested in the state\njudiciary was something that was rejected, and what the\nframers decided to do is to vest it in the state\nlegislature and vested that authority under Article II,\nnot just in the state, but the legislature.\nQUESTION: And the state legislature could vest\nit in the judiciary if it wanted, as I read the McPherson\ncase, and here they have done something less. The state\njudiciary said, we are going to invoke the ordinary\nelection procedures, which you know, warts and all, it\ninvolves some interpretation by the courts and contest\nproceedings, et cetera.\nMR. OLSON: Well, it is -- yes, it said that,\nJustice Kennedy. But what it did was supplant a set of\nrules elect -- enacted before the election to govern the\nelection, for a set of rules made up after the election.\nQUESTION: All right. Mr. Olson, let's assume\nthat it did that, for the sake of argument. I want to go\nback to the issue that the Chief Justice raised a little\nwhile ago, and I'd like you to comment on this line of\nreasoning. You've got Section 5. Congress in the statute\nseems to have gone to great lengths to provide what to do\nin the situation that you are describing, accepting your\nview of the case.\nSection 5, it says if you do certain things\nwithin certain times, the conclusion that you draw is\ngoing to be conclusive upon the Congress. In Section 15,\nit sets out in fact an elaborate set of contingencies\nabout what the Congress is supposed to do and can do if\nthere is a dispute as to whether a given set of procedures\nin the state have conformed to Section 5. Section 15\nrefers to regularity. It refers to legality and\nillegality. It looks to me as though at least at this\nstage of the proceedings, Congress has said if there is a\nquestion about whether this if-then provision in Section\n5, construing Article II, has been satisfied, then this is\nthe decisional tree for the Congress to follow in deciding\nwhat to do about it and in resolving challenges.\nIt looks to me as though at this stage of the\ngame, the statute has committed the determination of the\nissues that you raise and the consequences to follow from\nthem to the Congress. Why should the Court, why should\nthe Federal judiciary be interfering in what seems to be a\nvery carefully thought out scheme for determining what\nhappens if you are right?\nMR. OLSON: Because I submit that that writes\nSection 5 essentially out of existence if an agency of\nstate government, if a state legislature --\nQUESTION: No. It doesn't write it out of\nexistence. It provides in Section 15 what happens if the\nstate agency does what you say it did.\nMR. OLSON: If the state agency, if the state\nlegislature empowered by Article II of the Constitution,\ndoes what it is invited to do by Section 5, and then\nanother agency of state government, in this case the state\nsupreme court, comes along and upsets that scheme, yes,\nyou have ultimate resort to the resolution of the dispute\nunder Sections 15 of Title 3, but that's precisely --\nQUESTION: Well, you say you have ultimate\nresort. But that begs the question, that seems to be\nprecisely the resort that Congress has provided.\nMR. OLSON: Well, I'm not making myself clear, I\nthink, is that the importance of Section 5 was to invite\nthe state to do things that would avoid the chaos and the\nconflict and the controversy and the unsettled situation\nthat this country faced in 1876, and --\nQUESTION: Mr. Olson, did Section 15 exist when\nMcPherson was decided?\nMR. OLSON: I don't know, Justice Scalia. I\ndon't know the answer to that, when it was adopted. I\ncan't recall whether it was a part of the 1887 electoral\ncount statute or not. I can probably answer that in\nregard --\nQUESTION: That would make a difference,\nwouldn't it?\nMR. OLSON: Well, it seems to me it wouldn't\nmake a difference, because of this. It might -- yes, it\ncertainly might make a difference one way, but it still\nwouldn't make a difference because our concept here, and I\nthink it's quite a rational and actually the only\nexplanation for how you can put these provisions together,\nArticle II and Section 5, and Congress' desire to avoid\nthe very controversy, chaos, conflict, which even --\nQUESTION: Well, but Section 15 assumes that\nthere is controversy and chaos.\nMR. OLSON: Yes.\nQUESTION: Section 15 isn't providing for\nchallenges except in situations perhaps exactly like this\none.\nMR. OLSON: But that's what the country -- what\nessentially Section 15, although it modifies it and\nstructures it somewhat, it was still a situation that\nCongress was facing in 1876 when it was dealing with the\nHayes-Tilden election.\nQUESTION: Right.\nMR. OLSON: And by the time it got there, there\nwere dueling slates of electors that were buying -- there\nwere exchanges and a lot of things that everyone felt was\nvery destructive to the country.\nQUESTION: But Congress had to face the\nconstitutional fact that under Article II, it could not,\nor its understanding was certainly, that it could not\nmandate certain state procedures. Article II did say the\nlegislature shall decide what they are.\nMR. OLSON: Correct.\nQUESTION: So the most that Congress could do in\nproviding for a more orderly resolution of what happened\nin Hayes-Tilden was to do what it did in Section 5, and\nthat is to say if you do certain things, you can depend\nupon the results, recognizing that the state might not do\nthose things. And it then provided, or at least at the\npresent time it is provided in Article, in Section 15,\nthat if you don't do those things, there is a sequence of\nissues that can be raised to be decided by the Congress.\nIf Congress wanted this Court to get into the\nissue at this stage, it seems passing strange to me that\ndespite all the elaborateness of Section 15 there wouldn't\nhave been some mention of Federal litigation proceeding in\nthe Section 15 proceeding.\nMR. OLSON: I think that's a very important\npoint, and let me make it: That Congress did say if you\ndo these things, certain consequences will flow from it.\nFlorida did these things, and we submit that there is,\nthat the courts are here to protect the benefit of the\nbargain that Florida made when it responded to that\ninvitation, because --\nQUESTION: We have to separate your statutory\nargument from your Constitutional argument. To the extent\nthat you are relying just on the Constitution, do you\nthink that Congress could by Section 15 exclude the courts\nfrom adjudicating the constitutionality of what the state\nhas done?\nMR. OLSON: No, I don't think so.\nQUESTION: But it certainly could express its\npreference for a scheme whereby the initial litigation, if\nyou will, at this level, would take place in the Congress.\nTo acknowledge that is not to say that the issue is\njusticiable or that this Court has somehow been\nnecessarily excluded from the process for all time. It is\nsimply to say that the first line of litigation at the\nFederal level seems under the statute to be Congress, and\nnot the Court.\nQUESTION: Isn't that a fair reading of 15?\nMR. OLSON: That's not a fair reading of Section\n5, and let me answer this question, and I would like with\nthe Court's permission to reserve the time --\nQUESTION: Well, I don't think Section 5 goes to\nthe issue. The question is whether it's a fair reading of\nSection 15.\nMR. OLSON: I don't think that they can be read\nin isolation. I think that Section 5 was designed to\navoid the problem created by the controversy and the\nhaving to resolve this in Congress, which is exactly what\ndid happen in 1876, and was a very unsatisfactory\nsituation.\nQUESTION: And in 1876, Congress did not have --\nQUESTION: 1877.\nQUESTION: -- the rules with --\nQUESTION: 1877.\nQUESTION: Congress did not have the rules with\nrespect to conclusiveness that it now has under Section 5.\nMR. OLSON: That's right. And it put those\nrules with respect to conclusiveness into Section 5. The\nFlorida legislature bought into that scheme and now the\nFlorida Supreme Court, which doesn't have any\nConstitutional authority pursuant to Section 2 to do so,\nupset that scheme, deprived Florida of the benefit of\ndoing exactly what Congress wanted to have happen under\nSection 5. I would, with the Court's permission, reserve\nthe balance of my time.\nQUESTION: Very well, Mr. Olson. Mr. Klock,\nwe'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JOSEPH P. KLOCK, JR.\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS KATHERINE HARRIS,\nET AL., IN SUPPORT OF PETITIONER\nMR. KLOCK: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please\nthe Court:\nOur argument is simply addressed to issues\nhaving to do with Florida law, and the point being raised\nby the Secretary is this, that the law in the state of\nFlorida on November 7 was changed by the Supreme Court of\nFlorida's decision on November 21. The Secretary is not\ncontesting the right of the Florida Supreme Court to\nchange the law of Florida, is simply pointing, she is\nsimply pointing out, that the law did change.\nQUESTION: Does the Secretary maintain that in\nsome instances she has a discretion that a court does not\nor can a court do whatever she might do, under Florida\nlaw?\nMR. KLOCK: Under Florida law, she has certain\ndiscretion that I think a court probably does not have in\nthe protest period, Justice Kennedy, and that would be\nthat she had the discretion to decide whether or not\nreturns could be permitted after that seventh day, and\nindeed that's based on two things that we have in the\nrecord. One is an opinion that was issued by the Division\nof Elections that talks about the circumstances in which\nthe Secretary would exercise discretion, and the second is\nthe letter that the Secretary sent to the three or four\ncanvassing boards that requested an extension of time\nafter the 14th deadline had passed.\nShe sent the letter out, she said, please\nindicate to me whether or not you intend to file returns\nafter the deadline, and if you do what the reasons are.\nShe collected a set of criteria, she applied the\ncriteria, and then sent a letter back, and what she did,\nJustice Kennedy, in the case of the Division's letter, the\nopinion which, of course, is binding under Florida law on\nelections officials who receive them, she -- the Division\nhead said that there were certain circumstances such as\nacts of God, hurricanes, and that kind of thing where the\ndiscretion would be exercised. When she came up with her\nadditional reasons for considering whether or not she\nwould exercise her discretion, she indicated a number of\nthem which are also contained within the record. It's at\nthe Joint Appendix at 21, she indicated where there was a\nresult of voter fraud with a substantial --\nQUESTION: She said she would exercise her\ndiscretion. Did she say she would have to exercise her\ndiscretion in those conditions?\nMR. KLOCK: I think she would have to exercise\nher discretion.\nQUESTION: The court did compel her to?\nMR. KLOCK: Yes, sir.\nQUESTION: Do you think that was clear before\nthe opinion of the supreme court in this case?\nMR. KLOCK: Yes, sir.\nQUESTION: Let me just ask one general question\nfor your comment on whether it's a change in the law. To\nwhat extent, in your view, was the -- did the Supreme\nCourt of Florida consider itself bound by either prior\nprecedent or the constitution of the state which\npreexisted?\nMR. KLOCK: In terms of handing down its\ndecision?\nQUESTION: In terms of the particular result it\nreached in this case.\nMR. KLOCK: I believe the Supreme Court of\nFlorida was looking at its law in terms of articulating\nthe law that it wanted to have then and on a going-forward\nbasis. What it did -- and obviously since it's the chief\ncourt of the state, it has the right to do whatever it\nwishes to do with respect to Florida law only bound by\nwhatever separation of powers --\nQUESTION: Do you think they thought their\ndecision was dictated either by prior precedent or by the\nconstitution of the state?\nMR. KLOCK: Your Honor, I don't know whether\nthey thought that or not, but that's not what the opinion\nsays. As a matter of fact, the opinion is pretty clear,\nthey start out by talking about statutory construction,\nand they hinge everything on the use of the word\ninterpret, and then they sort of turn the word interpret\nto a use that it's not intended to be, but then when they\nget to the point of designing the rule of law they're\ngoing to go forward on, they don't talk about interpreting\nthe statute. They then go and base it on principles of\nequity in the Florida Constitution, and indeed what they\nend up with, Your Honor, is this statement with respect to\nthe discretion that the Secretary is left with, and that\nis this -- and it's on 35 of the Joint Appendix. \"We\nconclude that consistent with Florida's election scheme,\nthe Secretary may reject a Board's,\" that's the canvassing\nboard's, \"amended returns only if the returns are\nsubmitted so late that their inclusion will preclude a\ncandidate from contesting certification or preclude\nFlorida voters from participating fully in the Federal\nelectoral process.\"\nNow, Your Honor, there's --\nQUESTION: I understand your position is that\nwas entirely new?\nMR. KLOCK: Yes, sir.\nQUESTION: I'm just wondering, therefore your\nsubmission is that it was not dictated by the constitution\nor by prior precedent?\nMR. KLOCK: No, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: I thought you said a moment ago that\nthe court, the Florida court did rely on the Florida\nConstitution. There's a section of their opinion that's\ndevoted to that.\nMR. KLOCK: Your Honor, in devising the remedy,\nthey refer to the Florida Constitution, but the issue that\nwe're here on, as I understand it, sir, is whether or not\nthe law changed. There's no question that they have a\nright to do what they did. The only --\nQUESTION: I think perhaps another statement of\nthe issue is to what extent did the Florida Supreme Court,\nin construing this statute, rely on more general\nprovisions of the Florida Constitution which they cited in\ntheir opinion?\nMR. KLOCK: I think they did rely, in creating\nthe remedy on the Florida Constitution, I believe they\ncreated a right that had not previously been seen there,\nwhich they have a right to do, but, Mr. Chief Justice, the\nissue again is whether or not the law that they\narticulated on November 21 is different than the law that\nexisted on November 7, and how the Secretary of State, in\nexercising her discretion, was to divine the standard that\nwould be established on November 21.\nQUESTION: Your position is so long as it's\ndifferent, it violates Section 5 and therefore we have a\nright to step in?\nMR. KLOCK: Well, Justice Scalia, we have not\naddressed the Federal issues because, I mean, we're in a\nsituation where you have --\nQUESTION: Well, this is a Federal court what\nare you here for, if you're not addressing --\nMR. KLOCK: I understand that, sir. I\napologize. But we have the Secretary of State here, we\nhave the Attorney General here, and the legislature has\nfiled by amicus, and of course the state has not appeared,\nso it's a little unusual. We haven't addressed those\nissues, but to answer your question, yes, sir.\nQUESTION: Can you tell me when this petition\nwas filed here, the Secretary had not certified anybody\nthe winner, and now the Secretary has certified a winner,\nand therefore, I guess, whether we win, whether your side,\nthe side you're supporting wins or loses, it doesn't\nchange that, and I guess that's moot, but my question is,\nis there any respect in which this really makes a\ndifference, this case? How? I'm thinking, if it does\nmake a difference, numbers of vote, is that kind of thing\nright for us to decide now? How could it make a\ndifference? What's the consequence of our going one way\nor the other now in this case?\nMR. KLOCK: Your Honor, it makes an enormous\ndifference because the relief that has been requested\nwould be for the Court to determine that the law in effect\nat the time of the election was that manual recounting of\nballots would not be permitted to address voter error,\nwhich I think has been extensively --\nQUESTION: We don't have -- all -- suppose they\nwon and the relief was, suppose your side won, and the\nrelief was, fine, it should have been certified on\nNovember 14th or 18th instead of November 26th. Now,\nwhat's the consequence of that? Just that? Forgetting\nwhat the reasoning is. Is there a consequence that flows\nfrom that, that is real, adverse, you know, significant,\nconcrete that we can predict now as opposed to speculate?\nMR. KLOCK: The only immediate result would be\nthat you would have a margin that instead of being 536\nvotes would be 900-some-odd votes, and it would only be\nadded to as a result of whatever was added by the overseas\nballots.\nQUESTION: Fine. Then this case has said, we've\nsaid a claim is not ripe if it rests upon contingent\nfuture events that may not occur as anticipated or indeed\nmay not occur at all. And so what I wonder, is this in\nthis realm of speculation as to whether or not it will or\nwill not make a difference, a difference to the outcome of\nthe election.\nMR. KLOCK: It will make a difference to the\noutcome of the election because there is an ongoing\ncontest which is interrelated and is involved with the\nSupreme Court's opinion, and of course because the Supreme\nCourt of Florida, in coming up with the remedy that they\ncame up with, completely changed the period of time from a\nrelatively short period of time, seven days for a protest\nand much longer period for a contest, we now have a\nsituation where there is 19 days for the protest and 16\ndays for a contest.\nQUESTION: Well, it's too late -- it's too late\nto lengthen the time for the contest. I mean, to the\nextent that they have shortened the contest time, you\nknow, that's water over the dam right now, isn't it?\nMR. KLOCK: Yes, Justice Scalia, but the issue\nhere -- I'm sorry.\nQUESTION: Is it not the case that if the votes\nare, are as, as they have been shown to be under the\nFlorida Supreme Court's opinion, the race is much closer,\nand therefore some counties under Florida law would\nconduct recounts that otherwise would not conduct\nrecounts. Doesn't whether a recount is conducted depend\nupon how likely it is that the recount is going to change\nthe outcome?\nMR. KLOCK: Your Honor, if the law is returned\nto the point it was on November 7, there is no right to a\nmanual recount to correct voter error, and that will end\nthe litigation that currently exists in the State of\nFlorida, which were the opinions of the Secretary of\nState's Division of Elections that were issued and also\nthe state of the law as it existed at that point in time.\nThe record shows very clearly that there was no dispute\nthat there were any problems with voting machines or any\nother tabulation problems with voting machines. It was\nsimply when they went through the process of what is,\nJustice Ginsburg, a discretionary right to a manual\nrecount, not a mandatory one, when they went into that and\ndid the test, each of those canvassing boards did not find\nany problem with a mechanical problem. It was simply a\nproblem in terms of voter error.\nQUESTION: The secretary took the -- never mind.\nThank you.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Klock. Mr. Hancock,\nwe'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL F. HANCOCK\nON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT ROBERT A. BUTTERWORTH\nMR. HANCOCK: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court: In accordance with Article II of the\nUnited States Constitution, the Florida legislature has\ndirected the manner of selecting presidential electors in\nFlorida. That manner is pursuant to a popular vote that's\nimplemented pursuant to the general election laws of the\nState of Florida.\nQUESTION: I guess Article II permits the\nlegislature in general to make a choice that it could\nitself select the electors?\nMR. HANCOCK: Yes, Justice O'Connor. We agree\nwith that. In implementing the election law, each branch\nof the Florida government plays a role. For example, the\njudiciary, or the executive branch of our government has\nnot found itself bound by the technical, hypertechnical\nrequirements of the election law. An example of that is\nthat the, the executive branch has implemented a rule, not\na law, but a rule that allows absentee ballots from\noverseas military voters to be received after the 10 days\nafter the close of the polls. Under the law of the State\nof Florida, all absentee ballots have to be received by\nthe time the polls close on election day.\nQUESTION: In your brief you say, you conclude\nthat the Florida Supreme Court like, I think it's page 12,\nlike any state court, exercised its inherent equitable\npowers to remedy a threat to fundamental constitutional\nrights, and it rewrote the certification deadlines\naccording to that power, did it not?\nMR. HANCOCK: The only -- yes, Justice Kennedy.\nThe only equitable power exercised by the court was\nsetting the deadline.\nQUESTION: Isn't that such an amorphous general\nabstract standing that it can't possibly be said to be a\nlaw that was enacted and in place at the time of the\nelection?\nMR. HANCOCK: No. The laws were enacted well\nbefore the election. What happened was that in the court\n--\nQUESTION: Of course, the Constitution was there\nbefore the election, the Due Process Clause is before the\nelection, but what we are talking about is having laws of\nsufficient specificity and stability that people can rely\non them in advance and not have them changed after the\nfact. And your brief makes it very clear that they\nexercised their inequitable powers to remedy a threat to\nfundamental constitutional rights and changed the deadline\naccordingly. It seems to me that's no standard -- it's an\nenviable standard, something we might all agree with in\nthe end, but as far as the requisite specificity to\nsatisfy 3 U.S.C. Section 5, I just don't see it as there.\nMR. HANCOCK: The court had to do something,\nJustice Kennedy. It was faced with conflicts in Florida\nlaw. They had conflicting opinions from the Florida\nAttorney General as to the meaning of the law and the\nSecretary of State as to the meaning of the law. As a\nresult of --\nQUESTION: Maybe it had to do something, but did\nit comply with 3 U.S.C. Section 5?\nMR. HANCOCK: I submit, Justice Kennedy, that 3\nU.S.C. Section 5 doesn't require the state to do anything,\nit merely says --\nQUESTION: But did it comply with that part of 3\nU.S.C. Section 5 that requires that laws be enacted and in\nplace prior to the election in order to get the safe\nharbor?\nMR. HANCOCK: Yes, it did. The laws were in\nplace before the election. And those laws granted to the\njudiciary --\nQUESTION: Well, but certainly the date changed.\nThat is a dramatic change. The date for certification,\nright?\nMR. HANCOCK: Yes.\nQUESTION: And it was done by the court.\nMR. HANCOCK: Yes, it was done pursuant --\nQUESTION: And the legislature had very clearly\nsaid, you know, seven days after, that's the date, and it\njust does look like a very dramatic change made by the\nFlorida court, and I'm wondering if that is consistent in\nfact with the notion, expressed at least in Section 5, so\nthat the result would be if it did go to Congress, it\nwould be a change.\nMR. HANCOCK: The -- I agree that the date was\nimplemented pursuant to the court's equitable powers.\nOther than that, it was a routine exercise in statutory\nconstruction. The court was faced with a situation first\nof all where because of conflicting advice the counties\nhad started and then stopped conducting manual recounts\nbecause of advice from the secretary of the state which\nthe supreme court ultimately concluded to be erroneous.\nQUESTION: Yes. And that advice was -- and this\nwas really the beginning of all of the problem, her advice\nwas that the provision providing for recounts, manual\nrecounts, not requiring them but giving them as one of the\noptions, only came into play when there was some defect in\nthe, in the machinery, and it was not available for voter\nerror, that is for voters who didn't punch the cards the\nway they were supposed to. And the attorney, your office\ncame out with the opposite conclusion.\nThe secretary's brief contends that that had\nalways been the rule in Florida. Is that the case? Do\nyou know of any other elections in Florida in which\nrecounts were conducted, manual recounts, because of an\nallegation that some voters did not punch the cards the\nway they should have through their fault? No problem with\nthe machinery -- it's working fine. You know, there were\nwhat, pregnant chads, hanging chads, so forth?\nMR. HANCOCK: No, Justice --\nQUESTION: Did that ever happen --\nMR. HANCOCK: No, I'm not aware of it ever\nhappening before. But, I can say that the Supreme Court\nof Florida for 100 years has put a duty on election\nofficials to discern the intent of the voter, and while\nthe secretary of the state refers to it as voter error,\nwhen the ballot is punched, that's, under the laws of the\nState of Florida as interpreted by the supreme court, that\nvoter has cast the ballot, even if the chad did not --\nQUESTION: Is it your position that any\ninterpretation the Supreme Court of Florida makes to\nimplement the will of the people is never a new law?\nMR. HANCOCK: The supreme -- yes. I can't say\never, but I'd say that on the case before the court, all\nthat was before the court was ordinary statutory\nconstruction, which must be, the result of it whether this\nCourt would agree with it or disagree with it, must be\nrespected by this Court. That's the very foundation of\nfederalism.\nQUESTION: Mr. Hancock, are you relying on the\nFlorida Supreme Court statement at least twice in its\nopinion -- now I looked at the page to which Mr. Klock\nreferred, page 37-A, it says for the second time that\nSection, the section governing manual recounts appears to\nconflict with the sections that set a deadline, and it's\nreconciling that conflict.\nMR. HANCOCK: Yes.\nQUESTION: Whether it was wrong or right, that's\nwhat it said its mission was and that's what it did.\nMR. HANCOCK: Yes. Both in words and in\noperation, the statutes could not work together because of\nthe time for requesting manual recounts, the extent of the\njob manual recounts --\nQUESTION: What is the section that requires\nmanual recounts?\nMR. HANCOCK: It's 102. -- well, 102.166\nauthorizes manual recounts.\nQUESTION: That's different from requires.\nMR. HANCOCK: Yes, but once it starts, Justice\nScalia, once it's authorized, if the initial sample\nrecount shows an error that might effect the outcome of\nthe election --\nQUESTION: Then --\nMR. HANCOCK: The board is then required to,\namong other things, conduct a full manual recount.\nQUESTION: No, no. It's required to do one of\nthree things, one of which could be a manual recount. It\ncould decide to do one of the other two instead.\nMR. HANCOCK: Yes. The problem faced by the\ncounties --\nQUESTION: So there is really -- there is -- I\nmean, the Court says that there is a requirement for a\nmanual recount but I don't see anything in the text of the\nstatute that requires a manual recount.\nMR. HANCOCK: The statute requires that the\nelection officials attempt to discern the cause of the\nerror. Here the cause of the error was that, in these\ncounties, was that the machines were not able to read\nballots, 10,000 ballots in Palm Beach County, the machine\ndid not read as including a vote for president. That was\nthe issue so that the solution to that was not the\nmachines, even when they're operating properly would not\nread these ballots, so what was left of the county\ncanvassing boards then was to do the full manual recount,\nand the language of that statute again says they shall do\na full manual recount in those circumstances.\nQUESTION: It says that the board may authorize\nthe manual recount, it doesn't require it. If it does\nauthorize it, then it tells it how to do it and says they\nshall appoint as many counting teams as necessary,\npresumably as necessary to do it within the time limit.\nMR. HANCOCK: Yes, Justice O'Connor, but, again\nthese -- under the law these requests can be made up to\nthe time of canvassing -- that means up to six or seven\ndays -- and also the number of ballots at issue here are\nbetween 650,000 in Palm Beach County and also 900,000, up\nto 900,000 in Broward County.\nQUESTION: If that is a statutory problem, the\ncourt's resolution didn't really solve it, did it?\nBecause even with her extended time period the same\nstatutory problem exists. There still isn't enough time\nunder the extended deadlines for some of these counties\nthat have an enormous number of votes to conduct a manual\nrecount, isn't that right?\nMR. HANCOCK: Well, let me --\nQUESTION: I mean to resolve a supposed conflict\nin the statute in a manner that leaves in place the same\nproblem that existed before seems to me not a real\nresolution of the statutory problem.\nMR. HANCOCK: The supreme court tried to blend\nit all together to make it work, Justice Scalia, and again\nit came up with a solution. The Secretary of State's\nargument here is based on -- the Secretary of State\nherself recognized that she had the discretion under\nFlorida law to accept returns filed outside of that\nseven-day deadline. A breakdown of the machines, in her\nview, would justify late returns. A failure of the\nmachines to read ballots would not justify late-filed\nreturns.\nThe supreme court said that the legal standard\nshe was using was wrong. That -- we submit that that\ndecision of the supreme court is the law in the state of\nFlorida.\nQUESTION: I'm going to extend your time two\nminutes, Mr. Hancock, because you haven't had a chance to\nsay a lot yet.\nMR. HANCOCK: Well, I don't need the extension\ntime, Your Honor. If there's no other questions, I will\nstop. Thank you.\nQUESTION: Thank you. Mr. Tribe, we will hear\nfrom you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF LAURENCE H. TRIBE\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS AL GORE, JR.\nAND FLORIDA DEMOCRATIC PARTY\nMR. TRIBE: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please\nthe Court:\nI think I would want to note at the outset that\nthe alleged due process violation which keeps puffing up\nand then disappearing and has as far as I can tell not\nappeared at the state supreme court, did make one\nappearance in the reply brief here, is really not before\nthe Court, and for understandable reasons, because\nalthough it is part of the popular culture to talk about\nhow unfair it is to change the rules of the game, I think\nthat misses the point when the game is over, and when it's\nover in a kind of photo finish that leaves people unsure\nwho won, and then the question is, how do you develop\ngreat, sort of greater certainty, and a rather common\ntechnique is a recount, sometimes a manual recount,\nsometimes taking more time would be rather like looking\nmore closely at the film of a photo finish. It's nothing\nextraordinary. It's not like suddenly moving Heartbreak\nHill or adding a mile or subtracting a mile --\nQUESTION: You're seeing no important policy in\n3 U.S.C. Section 5.\nMR. TRIBE: No, no.\nQUESTION: In fact, we can change the rules\nafter -- not important -- the popular culture --\nMR. TRIBE: Certainly not, Justice Kennedy, but\nI read U.S.C. Section 5 -- that is 3 U.S.C. Section 5 not\nas a requirement that, for example, one never add\nresources to checking how a particular ballot was cast.\nIf you look at the language, I think it's really much too\ncasual to say of it that all of the laws must stay fixed\nin order to have the safe harbor apply. As I'll try to\nargue in a few minutes, that's not really a question for\nthis Court, but for the Congress, but the language of\nSection 5 is that -- and I'll just read what I think are\nthe key words, \"if a state --\"\nQUESTION: Can you tell us where you're reading\nfrom?\nMR. TRIBE: Actually, I'm just reading from a\ncopy of the U.S. Code, 3 U.S.C. Section 5, not from any --\nthe page I can identify --\nQUESTION: It's in the appendix to the\npetitioner's brief, I'm sure, isn't it?\nMR. TRIBE: Yes, although I'm afraid I don't\nhave it in front of me.\nQUESTION: Page 3A of the blue brief.\nMR. TRIBE: Thank you, Justice Souter. Page 3A\nof the blue brief, I am reliably informed.\nSo if any state --\nQUESTION: That won't get you an extra two\nminutes.\nMR. TRIBE: Well, I tried. I tried. If any\nstate shall have provided, and then it says by laws\nenacted prior to the day fixed for the appointment of the\nelectors, a fancy way of saying election day, for the\nfinal determination of any controversy or contest about\nthe appointment of electors -- and here's the key phrase,\nI think -- by judicial or other methods or procedures at\nleast six days before the time fixed for the meeting of\nthe electors, that means in our situation, December 12,\nthen the final determination shall be conclusive and\ngovern the counting in Congress.\nNow, the question for Congress, I suppose, would\nbe, although I don't see how this Court could get into\nthat question at this stage, but the question would be, is\na particular change extending a deadline for exigent\ncircumstances because a recount has been authorized, a\nchange in the judicial or methods of procedures for\nresolving the contest.\nQUESTION: Let me just ask you a moment, you say\nyou don't think the statute permits this Court to get into\nthe matter at this time. Are you suggesting there could\nbe any judicial review of a decision by the Congress to\ncount one set of electoral votes?\nMR. TRIBE: No, I don't think so, Mr. Chief\nJustice, it's just that I don't trust my own imagination\nto have exhausted all possibilities. For example, in the\ncase in, I think it was 1890, in Fitzgerald v. Green when\nthis Court held that only states can punish fraudulent\nvoting for presidential electors, it got into the act sort\nof obliquely and at an angle, and that had a bearing on\nthe question of how the presidential electoral slate might\nbe composed, but it certainly didn't get into this.\nQUESTION: No, it certainly was quite different\nfrom --\nMR. TRIBE: Very.\nQUESTION: -- this hypothetical.\nMR. TRIBE: That's certainly right.\nQUESTION: You suggest in your reply brief that\nit is not -- I think you said it's not self-evident that\nthe Florida legislature at this time has the right to\nappoint any slate of delegates because the Congress has\nset the date, and the date is the general election day.\nIf that is so, doesn't this mean that when we\ntalk -- think about justiciability, we must be very\ncareful to preserve the role of the Court. You have said\nor suggested here in your reply brief that the Florida\nlegislature now has no role. You are now suggesting that\nthis Court has no role. That means the Supreme Court of\nFlorida is it, so far as a judicial interpretation of the\nconsequences of 3 U.S.C. Section 5.\nMR. TRIBE: Well, Justice Kennedy, first of all\nI do want to be clear that in our view the question of\nwhether and when and how the Florida legislature can enter\nthe picture is in no way presented here. That paragraph\nwas intended to suggest that it's not obvious that the\nviews of some that there's no problem is right.\nSecondly, if it were the case that the Florida\nlegislature could not simply decide, well, we're tired of\nall this counting, we're moving in, and that this Court\ncannot decide whether the conditions of 3 U.S.C. Section 5\nare met, it would then remain only for Congress to make a\ndetermination and adding the Florida legislature would\nnot, after all, have added an adjudication.\nQUESTION: And my point is that puts hydraulic\npressure on your nonjusticiability argument and makes it a\nvery, very important argument and a critical argument in\nthis case.\nMR. TRIBE: Well, perhaps, Justice Kennedy, but\nI frankly can't see how it would affect the decision in\nthis case. After all, you have before you a judgment of\nthe highest court of the state. As Justice Ginsburg and\nothers have suggested, it would ordinarily be the case,\nsurely, that one would not go out of one's way to read the\njudgment as a breach of faith with the duties of trying to\nreconcile provisions that are --\nQUESTION: Well, I guess in the area, though, of\npresidential electors it could be that that court, as all\ncourts would be, have to be informed, at least, by the\nprovisions of Section 5 in reviewing the laws enacted by\nthe legislature of the state. I mean, it had to register\nsomehow with the Florida courts that that statute was\nthere and that it might be in the state's best interest\nnot to go around changing the law after the election.\nMR. TRIBE: Well, Justice O'Connor, I certainly\nagree that if the Florida Supreme Court adverted to 3\nU.S.C. Section 5, and as Justice Kennedy asked earlier,\ngot it wrong, then there would be a Federal issue for this\nCourt. Would it be, I wonder, a Federal issue --\nQUESTION: Well, is there a Federal issue if the\nCourt doesn't --\nMR. TRIBE: No. The answer is no.\nQUESTION: -- advert to that?\nMR. TRIBE: It would be nice. But remember it\nis --\nQUESTION: Because of Article II, which, after\nall, does give the legislature plenary power and must have\nwanted -- it must have wanted to have the laws in place so\nthat it wasn't -- so that Florida wouldn't risk losing its\nelectoral votes. I mean, the legislature had to want that\nby enacting laws, and perhaps the Florida court has to be\naware of the consequences to the state of changing the\nrules.\nMR. TRIBE: But, Justice O'Connor, under Article\nII, Section 1, Clause 2, the authority to regulate the\nmanner of the choice of electors is vested in the state\nlegislature. If the state legislature decides from the\nbeginning to exercise that authority by instructing the\nvarious institutions, certainly not just the courts, the\nattorney general, the secretary of state, in very\nparticular ways to exercise their roles in the process,\nwith a specific view of --\nQUESTION: Well, it certainly did by enacting\nthat date. Here is the certification date. How could it\nhave been clearer?\nMR. TRIBE: Well, I suppose it could be a\nviolation of Florida law if the enactment of that date is\nconstrued as a direction to a particular authority like\nthe secretary of state or the state's highest court to\ntake certain actions in order to get the benefit of this\nbonus, but only a violation of Federal law. I don't see\nhow you got a --\nQUESTION: What Florida law would that be?\nMR. TRIBE: Of state law. I'm sorry.\nQUESTION: Are you talking about the Florida\nConstitution?\nMR. TRIBE: Well, it might have been a violation\n--\nQUESTION: But then you run into the Blacker\ncase.\nMR. TRIBE: But it seems to me that the Federal\nquestion, which is really what brings us here, can only\narise if 3 U.S.C. Section 5 is something other than what\nMr. Olson called the indemnification of the state.\nQUESTION: It can also arise under the section\nof the Constitution that was construed in Blacker. That's\nquite independent of 3 U.S. 5.\nMR. TRIBE: That's right, if one concluded that\nFlorida had violated its duty to empower the legislature\nto take these regulatory steps.\nQUESTION: If one concluded that the Florida\nlegislature had relied on the state constitution in a way\nthat the Blacker case says it may not in construing the\nstatute.\nMR. TRIBE: I think that's possible, Mr. Chief\nJustice, but the judgment before you doesn't provide even\nan inkling, I think of proof about those matters. All we\nhave --\nQUESTION: That's what we have been arguing --\nQUESTION: As to whether it does or whether it\ndoesn't.\nMR. TRIBE: Well, I think we have been arguing\nseveral interrelated things. One of the things we have\nbeen arguing is whether one could in good faith reach the\nconclusion, novel as it was in some respects, as Justice\nO'Connor points out, that the Florida Supreme Court\nreached. Now, if the answer to that question was no,\nperhaps if there were a due process issue in this case,\nand if someone had a protectable interest that was\ninjured, that would be relevant. But the Federal question\nthat makes that relevant here would arise only if one\nforgot that 3 U.S.C. Section 5 is all carrot and no stick.\nQUESTION: No. I don't agree with you on that,\nMr. Tribe. It seems to me a Federal question arises if\nthe Florida Supreme Court in its opinion rather clearly\nsays that we are using the Florida Constitution to reach\nthe result we reach in construing the statute. I think\nBlacker is a strong argument they can't do that.\nMR. TRIBE: Well, that they can never avert to\ntheir own constitution?\nQUESTION: Well, certainly it stands for the\nproposition you couldn't do it then, in those\ncircumstances.\nMR. TRIBE: Well, what would it be, I wonder,\nabout the circumstances here that would say that in\nreconciling these provisions which at first we were told\nwere mandatory, then we were told they are not mandatory,\nthey give discretion, and now we are told that the real\nissue is simply did the court in putting a boundary on\nthat discretion, do something federally impermissible.\nWhat would it be about that sequence that would implicate\n--\nQUESTION: Well, you know, if the Supreme Court\nof Florida simply said in its opinion, look, these\nsections of the statute conflict, we've got to under our\njudicial principles resolve it one way or the other, but\n-- but it doesn't say that. It goes on to say, look, in\nthe light of the Florida Constitution and the general\nrights conferred there, we are construing it this way.\nMR. TRIBE: It seems to me that as a tiebreaker,\nas a way of shedding light on the provisions that are in\nconflict, so long as it's not done in a way that conflicts\nwith a Federal mandate, they are not violating any --\nQUESTION: Mr. Tribe, I don't -- I don't agree\nwith that. I don't -- I don't think that the Florida\nSupreme Court used the Florida Constitution as a tool of\ninterpretation of this statute. If you look at its\nopinion, it's separated into, into various sections,\nissues; IV, legal opinion of Division of Elections; V, the\napplicable law; VI, statutory ambiguity; and that's -- and\nVII, legislative intent. That's the section where they\nconstrue the statute in view of these ambiguities and so\nforth.\nThat section concludes, under this statutory\nscheme, the county canvassing boards are required to\nsubmit their returns to the department by 5 p.m. of the\nseventh day following the election. The statutes make no\nprovision for exceptions following a manual recount. If a\nboard fails to meet the deadline, the secretary is not\nrequired to ignore the county's returns, but rather is\npermitted to ignore the returns within the parameters of\nthis statutory scheme.\nSo what the statutory interpretation gives you\nis a firm termination date of December 7th and discretion\nin the secretary. The opinion continues, VIII, the right\nto vote. The text of our Florida Constitution begins with\na declaration of rights. And it goes on to say that to the\nextent the legislature may enact laws regulating the\nelectoral process, those laws are valid only if they\nimpose no \"unreasonable or unnecessary\" restraints on the\nright of suffrage contained in the Constitution. In other\nwords, I read the Florida court's opinion as quite clearly\nsaying, having determined what the legislative intent was,\nwe find that our state constitution trumps that\nlegislative intent. I don't think there is any other way\nto read it, and that is, that is a real problem, it seems\nto me, under Article II, because in fact there is no right\nof suffrage under, under Article II. There is a right of\nsuffrage in voting for the legislature but Article II\nmakes it very clear that the legislature can itself\nappoint the electors.\nMR. TRIBE: It seems to me that it's already\nbeen conceded that the legislature can delegate that\nfunction to the judiciary. And when Justice Kennedy asked\nif it can delegate the function to the judiciary, and that\nis what McPherson seems to suggest, then can it not\ndelegate something less, that is, can it not give the\njudiciary a role of the sort that it's exercising here?\nAfter all, the legislature, and this is important -- it's\nnot true in every state -- the legislature itself\nrepromulgates the Constitution every several years and\nthen it's ratified by the people.\nQUESTION: Isn't there another -- go on.\nQUESTION: No. That's all right.\nQUESTION: Isn't there another way of looking at\nwhat the Florida court did, and that was in effect to\napply the statute, the interpretative criterion, that\nwhere there is any discretion for interpretation, an\nunconstitutional result should be avoided, and because you\nhave here a statute as I understand it that regulates both\nFederal and state recounts, that much is, I think is\nclear.\nMR. TRIBE: Right.\nQUESTION: The only way to avoid an\nunconstitutional meaning of the statute so far as Florida\nlaw was concerned was to get into this constitutional\nconcern about preserving the franchise, and that because\nthe legislature intended one standard to cover both\nFederal and state recounts, it therefore is valid to\nconsider the state constitution in order to derive a\ngeneral meaning that will apply to a Federal, as well as a\nstate election. Can you look at it that way?\nMR. TRIBE: I fully accept that, Justice Souter.\nI'd supplement it with one important point. We are not\ndealing here with a decision in which within the gray area\nwhere a court could reasonably go either way, this court\nsimply said we don't care about these Federal\nconsiderations. It in particular exercised its equitable\npowers in favor of the Petitioner in order to facilitate\nmeeting the December 12 deadline while still being able to\nhave electoral contests. That December 12 deadline comes\npurely from Federal law.\nQUESTION: Can you -- can you just go back to\nyour characterization of the opinion. I think we would\nall agree that given that the legislature has to select\nthe manner, a state can't say, our Constitution selects\nthe electors. I suppose that's --\nMR. TRIBE: That's right.\nQUESTION: All right, but thinking of this\nopinion, suppose the court had said, look, we reach our\nresult based on the canons we found in Blackstone. Now,\nnobody is going to say they said Blackstone is selecting\nthe electors, right?\nMR. TRIBE: I think that makes sense.\nQUESTION: All right. Now, I suppose they said,\nwe reached this decision based on the values found in the\nConstitution. That would be like Blackstone. But suppose\nthey say, well, the legislature wants us to do X, but our\nConstitution requires us to do not X. That might be\ndifferent.\nMR. TRIBE: It might be different.\nQUESTION: Now, what is it that they have done\nhere?\nMR. TRIBE: I certainly don't think they have\ndone the third. They did not say -- I think when they\nunderscored the presence of language that Justice Scalia\nread about what's mandatory, they were simply being candid\nabout the fact that they were acting in conflict with one\npart of the statute, but the adjacent --\nQUESTION: It's in a separate section of the\nopinion, Professor Tribe, that is entitled the right to\nvote. It is after the legislative intent section and it\nsays categorically, to the extent the legislature may\nenact laws, they are invalid. And I suggest perhaps the\nreason that the court did it is that however expansive the\ndoctrine of constitutional doubt is, there is no way that\nit can make December 7 mean anything except December 7. I\nmean, they were almost constrained to use the constitution\nto override the, the firm deadline --\nMR. TRIBE: Justice Scalia --\nQUESTION: -- that was explicitly set forth in\nthe constitution.\nMR. TRIBE: Justice Scalia, both you and I think\nat one point Justice O'Connor, in pointing to the\nparticular dates that came out differently under the\napproach that this Court used from what would have emerged\nif they had looked only at 102.111 are making a mistake,\nwith all respect. It's not as though this Court\npromulgated a rule for the future about December 7th in\ncommemoration of Pearl Harbor, we say December 7 is the\nday. No. What they did was say we have to find a date\nwhich will accommodate these conflicting statutory\nprovisions and policies in light of what our constitution\ntells us, and we surely -- it would amaze, I would think\namaze this Court to see anyone saying that because an\nopinion was organized under Roman numeral headings --\nQUESTION: Professor Tribe --\nMR. TRIBE: -- in such a way that --\nQUESTION: Isn't it also true, Professor Tribe,\nthat part 8 of the opinion relies on four things -- the\nFlorida Constitution, earlier Florida decisions construing\nstatutes, an Illinois case, and a Federal case.\nMR. TRIBE: Absolutely.\nQUESTION: Not just their constitution.\nMR. TRIBE: That's right, and surely --\nQUESTION: Is it also true that the inability to\nuse Section 7 depended in the Florida Supreme Court's\nreasoning not on the existence of the constitution as the\nsole reason, but on the inability to make the December 7\ndate final and provide for the recounts within the times\nin which recounts can be called for. What I'm saying is,\ndidn't they say that the date of the 7th cannot stand, not\nbecause of the constitution alone but because there are\nother provisions in the statute that cannot be\naccommodated with sections -- with the 7 date?\nMR. TRIBE: Exactly. And I guess to take a\nbroad --\nQUESTION: They said that twice, and I think\nthat's critical if you add to that that we read a decision\nof a state court in the light most favorable to that court\nand not in the light least favorable. I suppose there\nwould be a possibility for this Court to remand for\nclarification, but if there's two readings, one that's\nquestionable, one that isn't, all of our decisions suggest\nthat we read the one --\nMR. TRIBE: Especially, I think, Justice\nGinsburg, when the odds that these conceivable Federal\nproblems are indispensable to this result, are\noverwhelmingly negative. It's not as though one cannot\nexplain the result this Court reached in the most\nconventional standard ways, and the fact that --\nQUESTION: Professor Tribe, I would feel much\nbetter about the resolution if you could give me one\nsentence in the opinion that supports the second of these\nsupposed alternative readings, that supports the\nproposition that the Florida Supreme Court was using the\nconstitutional right to vote provisions as an interpretive\ntool to determine what the statute meant. I can't find a\nsingle sentence for that.\nMR. TRIBE: Justice Scalia, I can do a little\nbetter than find a sentence. The entire structure of that\npart of the opinion, as Justice Stevens points out, would\nbe incoherent if the constitution was decisive. That is\nthe highest law in Florida. Why bother with all the rest\nif that is anything more than an interpretive guide.\nQUESTION: You would bother with it because\nhaving decided very clearly what the statute requires and\nfinding no way to get around the firm dates set, you say\nthe reason it's bad is because of the state constitution.\nThat's how it's written.\nMR. TRIBE: But, Justice Scalia --\nQUESTION: They might have tried it another way,\nbut it seems to me they didn't --\nMR. TRIBE: They also say that the provision\nthat reaches the result that conflicts with the authorized\nrecounts was written in 1951, that in 1989 they wrote a\nprovision that unmistakably created discretion, and we\nhaven't yet discussed this provision, also created the\nprovision that when the returns are filed late, it doesn't\nsay throw them away, it doesn't say give them back, it\nsays fine every member of the canvassing board $200 a day.\nThat would be a totally crazy provision. As this opinion\nunderstands, if you were not to reach a reconciliation of\nthis sort, this result was overdetermined under Florida\nlaw. It might be true that they said the constitution\nalso points this way, but there isn't a sentence in the\nopinion that suggests that without that constitutional\nargument the result would have to be different.\nQUESTION: What is the November 26th date? Is\nthat the seven day date moved or is that some kind of a\ndate that tries to reconcile the ultimate point after\nwhich the Secretary in exercising her discretion no longer\nhas to accept the late returns? Did it move the date from\nthe statute? Has it created a new date about this\ndiscretion? What is it?\nMR. TRIBE: Well, it looks to me like an\nexercise of the chancellor's foot, as it were, in this\nparticular case. When I saw the date, November 26th, I\ncouldn't come up with an algorithm or a formula that would\ngenerate it, but the court was confronted with the task of\ndrawing, as this Court has recognized, what are sometimes\ninevitably arbitrary lines; that is, it said it was not\nconsistent with the overall scheme of the statute to\nrequire these recounts, which had just begun, to\nterminate. That truly would be a promise to the ear to be\nbroken to the hope, like a munificent bequest, Justice\nJackson said --\nQUESTION: If the legislature --\nMR. TRIBE: -- in the pauper's will. Why tell\npeople the count if you won't count it?\nQUESTION: And if the legislature had jumped\ninto the breach and said this same thing, would that be a\nnew statute or new enactment under 5 U.S.C.?\nMR. TRIBE: I -- honestly, Justice Kennedy, I'm\nnot sure because the language that I quoted from 3 U.S.C.\nSection 5 focuses on the institutional dispute resolution\narrangement that is in place, and if you look at the\nlegislative history in the decade of hearings in the\nperiod after the Hayes-Tilden debacle, that history\nfocused on the importance of having a fixed tribunal which\nyou could look to rather than one cooked up at the last\nmoment, and indeed what they seem to be most afraid of was\nthe political entry of legislators and executives at the\n11th hour. There was no focus at all.\nQUESTION: But are you saying you can't tell us\nwhether they, in the hypothetical, supposed that it would\nbe a new enactment?\nMR. TRIBE: Well, there are certainly no cases\non the subject. The language gives me very little\nguidance. Since the section is addressed to Congress,\nneither my opinion about it nor the Court's opinion is\nnecessarily --\nQUESTION: You don't think you could tell us\nwhat you might advise the Congress if you were the counsel\nfor the Judiciary Committee.\nMR. TRIBE: I think I would advise the Congress\nthat it is not a new enactment, that it is an entirely\nreasonable construction of an existing enactment as to\nwhich the only alternative construction is to make it\nself-destruct, and to make it internally contradictory,\nand I honestly don't think if I were advising Congress\nthat I would say it's a new construction.\nI do think, also, that some people reasonably\ncould argue the contrary, and I guess I think that this\nlanguage should be interpreted whether by a court or by\nCongress in a way that gives some deference to the state\ngovernment and its organs, and I think any degree of\ndeference here is inconsistent with saying that there's\nbeen a Federal violation, especially when -- I want to\nremind us all about the context. Are we going to say that\nthis paragraph in this opinion says that Florida is in\nbreach of Article II of the Constitution in general? Hard\nto say. I don't think so.\nQUESTION: There should perhaps be some\ndeference, though, to the concept expressed in Article II,\nthat it is the authority of the legislature and some\nspecial concern about what the legislature may have said.\nMR. TRIBE: Yes, but if the legislature is\nentirely happy not to completely delegate this power to\nthe courts, which Article II would permit, but rather to\nallow the courts to exercise a somewhat more flexible role\nthan the one that the critic of this opinion would be\nembracing. That's within the power of the legislature of\nFlorida.\nQUESTION: Yeah, but who would have thought that\nthe legislature was leaving open the date for change by\nthe court? Who would have thought that?\nMR. TRIBE: Anyone. If you just read the\nstatute in 1989 and it says may. It says she may reject\nthe late returns.\nQUESTION: That doesn't change -- that's not the\ndate.\nMR. TRIBE: No, the date is the one from which\nthe may is measured. That is, you're supposed to get it\nin by seven days later. What if you don't? Well, if you\ndon't, she may or she may not reject them. Now, anybody\nreading that would realize that's a deadline only in a\nkind of Pickwickian sense. It's not a real deadline.\nShe's got discretion. Certainly if there's an act of God\nof the sort Justice -- was it Justice Stevens? -- asked\nabout --\nQUESTION: Yes, well, then the Secretary came in\nand argued and said, yes, her discretion was if it were an\nact of God or a machine breakdown she would exercise her\ndiscretion.\nMR. TRIBE: And it's an entirely normal exercise\nof judicial interpretation to say that this statute is not\nlimited to God and machines.\nQUESTION: Professor Tribe, can I ask you why\nyou think the Florida legislature delegated to the Florida\nSupreme Court the authority to interpose the Florida\nConstitution? I mean, I -- maybe your experience with the\nlegislative branch is different from mine, but in my\nexperience they are resigned to the intervention of the\ncourts, but have certainly never invited it.\nMR. TRIBE: Well, I have to say my experience\nparallels that --\nQUESTION: What makes you think the Florida\nlegislature affirmatively invited the Florida Supreme\nCourt?\nMR. TRIBE: The odd thing is that the system in\nFlorida involves their own repromulgation of the\nconstitution, and their scheme with respect to the\nresolution of disputes over elections draws a sharp\ndistinction between elections to their own House and\nSenate, which they won't trust the courts with as far as\nthey can throw them. Those are to be resolved exclusively\nin the House and Senate, and all others are to be resolved\nin the courts under a standard that they understandably\npreferred.\nQUESTION: They are resigned, that they are\nresigned to, but they need not be resigned to the Florida\nSupreme Court interposing itself with respect to Federal\nelections, they need not be because the Florida\nConstitution cannot affect it. And I -- I just find it\nimplausible that they really invited the Florida Supreme\nCourt to interpose the Florida Constitution between what\nthey enacted by statute and the ultimate result of the\nelection.\nMR. TRIBE: Well, I suppose if they were at all\nfar-sighted, if they looked at their own work and saw how\nself-contradictory it was, they might say we would want\nsomeone with the authority to reconcile these provisions\nto do so in the light not only of the literal language but\nof the fact that they are dealing with something very\nimportant, the franchise, that disenfranchising people,\nwhich is what this is all about, disenfranchising people\nisn't very nice.\nQUESTION: Wouldn't justice --\nMR. TRIBE: And it violates the Federal as well\nas the state Constitution.\nQUESTION: But wouldn't Justice Scalia's\nsuggestion be a stronger suggestion if they had dealt by\nthe statute only with Federal elections or only with a\npresidential election as opposed to dealing with both\nstate and Federal in the same statute?\nMR. TRIBE: Well, it's not uncommon, given the\nconvenience of having similar regulations apply on\nelection day not to bifurcate. Oregon v. Mitchell, after\nall, confronted the nation with a problem --\nQUESTION: Right. But when they -- when they\ndon't bifurcate, it's reasonable to suppose that they\nexpect their statute to be construed, number one, as one\nstatute, not as having different dates for different, for\nstate and Federal; and, number two, to be construed so far\nas the state concern arises in accordance with the state\nConstitution, and if that is so, then the result is they\nwould expect a state constitutional concern to inform\ntheir interpretation of a statute which ultimately governs\nFederal as well as state.\nMR. TRIBE: And they would recognize that when\nthe Federal election involved the presidency of the United\nStates with the special problems of the Electoral College\ndeadline, they might emerge with rather different\ndeadlines and to some extent a different approach for the\n-- to elections.\nQUESTION: But there are already different\ndeadlines for Federal elections, aren't there, because of\nthe Federal statute concerning overseas ballots?\nMR. TRIBE: Yes. That's -- that's entirely\ntrue.\nQUESTION: So that's, that's going to be\ndifferent anyway.\nMR. TRIBE: And there is an administrative order\n--\nQUESTION: But it's as a result of Federal law,\nisn't it?\nMR. TRIBE: Well, there is a consent decree\narising out of Federal law. There was the Federal general\nstatute --\nQUESTION: But it wasn't the legislature's\nchoice, it was Congress' choice that required that.\nMR. TRIBE: That's right. In 1986, there was a\ncongressional statute that already created that\ndifference.\nQUESTION: Mr. Tribe, before you finish, I would\nlike to know whether you are conceding some of the things\nyou said. Sounds like maybe you are. But the Florida\nlegislature under Article II, Section 1, could say we\ndon't want any judicial review of anything about the\nmanner in which we say electors should be appointed. Does\nthe Florida legislature have the authority to cut out\njudicial review?\nMR. TRIBE: No. No, I certainly don't think so.\nThey cut out judicial review -- even this may not be\nentirely consistent with the Florida Constitution. They\ncut out judicial review for the election of their own\nmembers in the House and Senate. I certainly don't think\nthey would have the authority to expel the Federal\njudiciary from the election of senators and\nrepresentatives.\nQUESTION: No. I mean the state judiciary. The\nstate judiciary. When it says each state shall appoint\nelectors in such manner as the legislature thereof may\ndirect.\nMay the legislature direct as to the Florida\nSupreme Court, and Florida Supreme Court we don't want you\nto review whatever we do?\nMR. TRIBE: I'm not actually clear about that,\nJustice Ginsburg. I have thought about it a lot. It\nseems to me that under Smiley v. Holm and similar cases,\nthe general principle is that the Constitution takes the\nstate government and its arrangement as it finds it, and\nthat when the legislature is identified, that really does\nnot mean the legislature in some specialized capacity, as\nwith Article V.\nNow, if that's the case and if it's therefore\nassumed that the legislature is surrounded with both\nexecutive and judicial authority, then a decision by the\nlegislature to completely exclude the judiciary from any\npossible role, the state judiciary, might be inconsistent\nwith the underlying meaning of Article II itself.\nQUESTION: Well, could the state legislature at\nleast now say in light of all this confusion, we enact a\nlaw today saying this is the way electors will be\nselected? Is that open to the legislature now?\nMR. TRIBE: I'm not sure. That's very much like\nmy inability to answer because I honestly have not reached\na conclusion that it's not presented by this case. I\ndon't know whether the legislature could do the further\nthing of naming electors, and if it doesn't do that --\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Tribe.\nMR. TRIBE: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nQUESTION: Mr. Olson, you have four minutes\nremaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. OLSON: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. May it\nplease the Court: It seems to me that it's very difficult\nto read the Florida Supreme Court decision as saying\nanything else other than the Florida Constitution in their\nview, in that court's view, is trumping everything else.\nThe second paragraph of the conclusion says because the\nright to vote is the preeminent right in the declaration\nof rights of the Florida Constitution and so forth, this\nopinion is full of language --\nQUESTION: But suppose they refer to the\ndeclaration of the rights of man, to 1789, the French\nrevolution, I mean, the right to vote is a value in the\nconstitution. Are they actually saying -- I didn't see\nit?\nMR. OLSON: They are sayihng --\nQUESTION: Or are they are saying the statute\nmeans one thing, but the statute is unconstitutional\nbecause the Constitution of Florida says the opposite. I\ndidn't see that.\nMR. OLSON: I think that the only reasonable\nfair reading of the decision is that the Florida Supreme\nCourt felt that, and it says it over and over again, that\nwe are going to be -- attempt to discern the will of the\npeople, the will of the electorate and discern, and\nenhance in whatever way we possibly can the right to vote.\nAnd because of that, these provisions of the statute which\nare very much quintessentially legislative, the timetables\nthat are involved in this statute, particularly the\nNovember 14th deadline, is a part of a composite package.\nThere is one week for a protest and certain recounts to\nthe extent that they can be done and there are four weeks\nfor contests.\nWhen the Florida Supreme Court truncated, when\nthe Florida Supreme Court expanded the protest period from\n7 days to 19 days, it necessarily limited the contest\nperiod to a shorter period of time. It changed the\ndiscretion. It allowed certain things to occur that\ncouldn't have occurred and it justifies all of those\nthings on the grounds that the Florida Supreme Court, the\nFlorida Constitution trumps those legislative concerns,\nand that's why it said we are not going to be dissuaded by\nhypertechnical statutory considerations. So the court was\ndoing what this Court said in the McPherson vs. Blacker\ncase that it cannot do, allow itself to insert itself or\nthe Florida Constitution over what is required by Article\nII, Section 1 of the Constitution.\nIt also seems to me quite evident in response to\nwhat Justice Kennedy was asking earlier, that there was\nconcern about the Federal statutory provision, the\nlanguage to which I think Justice Kennedy was referring is\non page 32-A of the appendix to the petition from the\ncourt's decision, and there is a footnote there that does\nrefer to reference to 3 U.S.C. 1 through 10, which of\ncourse includes Section 5, and it says so in conjunction\nwith the statement that the exercise of the discretion by\nthe secretary of state could not be done in such a way\nthat would preclude Florida voters from participating\nfully in the Federal electoral process. The court was\nassuming, it seems to me, that it did not, was not\nconflict -- the decision that it was rendering was not\ngoing to cause a conflict with the Federal statutory\nscheme, and it was, we submit, in error in that regard.\nSo the -- the -- to sum up with respect to this,\nthe Florida Supreme Court radically changed the\nlegislative scheme because it thought it could do so under\nthe Florida Constitution. By doing so, it acted\ninconsistently with Article II of the Constitution, and\ninconsistently with Section 5 of Title III, and it has\nbrought about precisely the circumstances that Section 5\nof Section 3, Title III, was designed to avoid.\nQUESTION: As I look in the conclusion, the\nparagraph on page 37-A, where they summarize what they\nsaid, there is nothing there about the Florida\nConstitution. It's only about the Florida election code.\nThey say they must construe the Florida election code as a\nwhole, and they point out the provisions in conflict.\nThere is not one word in that paragraph that says anything\nabout the Florida Constitution.\nMR. OLSON: The very second paragraph refers to\nthe Florida Constitution and the rights to vote. Page\n36-A of the appendix to the petition.\nCHIEF JUSTICE RHENQUIST: Thank you, Mr. Olson.\n"
