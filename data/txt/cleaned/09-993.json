As the government agrees,\nHatch-Waxman's plain text requires generic drugs to have\nthe same warnings as their brand-name equivalents, so\nState law can't require generic drugs to use different\nwarnings. After all, generics can't simultaneously\ncomply with a Federal duty to be the same and a State\nduty to be different.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that makes a\nlot of sense, but we do have our Wyeth decision that\nseems to cut the other way.\nMR. LEFKOWITZ: Well, Your Honor, the Wyeth\ndecision is premised on the fundamental conclusion that\nFederal law obligates and accommodates the brand\nmanufacturer to utilize a specific regulation, the CBE\nregulation, in order to make a warning change, in order\nto comply with its obligations under 201.57. And, as\nthe government agrees, we don't have the opportunity or\nthe authority to use a CBE regulation change.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But you have another -\nyou have another route, and that's what the government\nis telling us: That you could propose a revision of the\nlabel, and if you did that, then you would be home free.\nYou would not be subject to the State suit.\nMR. LEFKOWITZ: Justice Ginsburg, the\ngovernment agrees with us that we can't actually change\nthe label. What they say is, we could have an\nobligation, or they actually, in -- for the very first\ntime ever in their brief in this Court at the merit\nstage, said that there is a -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: No, it was in the -- at\nthe cert stage as well.\nMR. LEFKOWITZ: Well, Your Honor, I didn't\nread the cert stage as saying we had quite the same duty\nto ask the FDA, although clearly they now believe that\nwe have a duty to ask the FDA. And of course that's not\na duty that appears in any of their notice and comment\nrulemaking.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Can we call this the take\nsteps -- is this the take-steps doctrine, for purposes\nof discussion here?\nMR. LEFKOWITZ: Yes, Justice Kennedy, this\nis the take-steps.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: It's not clear to me\nwhether you say that that is preempted or just that it\nwas not well-pled. I'm not -- I'm not sure of your\nposition on that point.\nMR. LEFKOWITZ: Thank you, Justice Kennedy.\nWe maintain that a claim that under State law a generic\ncompany can be liable for not asking the FDA to make a\nlabeling change is preempted under this Court's\ndecisions both in Buckman and in ArkLa, because what\nthe -- what the Court has said is that the disclosure\nobligations between a Federal agency and a Federally\nregulated party are inherently Federal in character, and\nthis is not a subject of traditional State tort law.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Well, Mr. Lefkowitz, why\nshould -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Would the -- excuse me,\nJustice.\nWould the Federally licensed drug\nmanufacturer have a similar obligation to lobby the FDA\nfor a change?\nMR. LEFKOWITZ: No, Your Honor, and in fact\nthat was in part what was -- what came up in the\nbriefing in the Wyeth case. Wyeth initially said it\ndidn't have the obligation and couldn't use the CBE, and\nthen Ms. Levine said: Well, in that case you could have\nasked the FDA to make a change, and the Court didn't\nneed to even address that issue, because the Court found\nthat there actually was a regulation on point that gave\nthe brand manufacturer the ability to change.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But assume there hadn't\nbeen. Assume there hadn't been such a regulation. Do\nyou understand it to be the government's position that\nthe licensed drug manufacturer is not protected from\nState suits, even though it has a Federal permission to\ngive certain warnings, unless it has lobbied the FDA to\nchange those warnings?\nMR. LEFKOWITZ: Your Honor, I -- I don't see\nanything in the history, the 27-year history of\nHatch-Waxman, where the Federal government has ever said\nthat there is a legal obligation to lobby the FDA for a\nlabeling change.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Excuse me. There is a\nlegal obligation to advise the FDA when you have reports\nof adverse results that suggest the label may be wrong.\nAre you disavowing your -- your obligation to tell the\nFDA when something's wrong?\nMR. LEFKOWITZ: Absolutely not, Justice\nSotomayor.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So please describe\nwhat the difference between that obligation and the\nobligation to suggest a label change when you know it's\nbeen misbranded.\nMR. LEFKOWITZ: Under the FDA Regulation\n314.80 and 314.98, we have a myriad of disclosure\nobligations. Any time a generic learns about an adverse\nreport, it has to report it to the FDA, it has to\ninvestigate it, and if it doesn't do that then it's not\nin compliance with its Federal obligations and the FDA\nhas plenary authority to take all sorts of action.\nBut just as the Court said in the Buckman\ndecision, without dissent, when a company doesn't make\nappropriate disclosures to the FDA, even if people are\nhurt by that, even if it's -- if it causes people to be\ninjured and States might otherwise want to compensate\nthem for them, those disclosure obligations are up to\nthe FDA with its discretion to enforce. And the Court\nlooked directly to Congress in section 337.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So what's -- so what's\nthe conflict with State law, meaning you have an\nobligation to keep your label as it is, but if you also\nhave a Federal obligation to advise the FDA of\nadverse -- of adverse results and of needs for change,\nwhy can't you then comply with a duty to warn obligation\nbecause you can go to the -- to the FDA?\nMR. LEFKOWITZ: Well, first of all, there's\na little bit of a difference between reporting all of\nthe adverse events, which we clearly do, and asking the\nFDA to make a determination that the FDA has said is\nonly for the FDA to make with respect to generic\ncompanies.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Do you contest,\nMr. Lefkowitz, your ability to make that request? I\nknow that you contest your obligation to make that\nrequest, but do you think you could go to the FDA and\nmake that request and set a process in motion?\nMR. LEFKOWITZ: Your Honor, there's no\nquestion that we could certainly ask the FDA, and in\nfact if we had reason to believe that a label was not\naccurate, not strong enough, we would certainly do that.\nThe question is whether or not there's either a Federal\nobligation or a State duty to do this, and -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Well, if you could go to the\nFDA, why shouldn't we look at this suit in this way:\nThat the plaintiffs are bringing a standard failure to\nwarn claim; that you then have a preemption defense,\nthat you'll say it's impossible; and then in order to\nlitigate that preemption defense, the question will be,\nwell, if you had gone to the FDA, what would the FDA\nhave done? Would it in fact have required both brand\nnames and generics to change the label? And if it would\nhave, you would not have had -- been put in an\nimpossible position.\nMR. LEFKOWITZ: Your Honor, that is the\nprecise set of issues that this Court addressed both in\nBuckman and in ArkLa, in a situation where all we could\nhave done, and we weren't obligated to do, was ask the\nFDA. For a State to hold us liable for not asking the\nFDA is asking a State jury to put itself into the shoes\nof the FDA, to speculate how the FDA would have decided\nhypothetical issues, which ArkLa says is foreclosed in\nan area where the Federal Government, the Federal\nagency, has exclusive authority. And in Buckman, the\nCourt said that would disrupt and usurp the discretion\nof the agency to decide whether to punish and how to\npunish disclosure.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, Buckman --\nBuckman was arguably a little bit different, in that\nthere's a concern expressed in that case that\nrequiring allowing the State suit to go forward would\ncause manufacturers to basically inundate the agency\nwith proposals and warning revisions, so that there\nwould be so many things that the agency wouldn't even be\nable to process them, and they would become meaningless\nto the consumers. That doesn't seem to me to be a\nconcern in this case.\nMR. LEFKOWITZ: Well, Your Honor, the\ngovernment had articulated that proposition in the\nBuckman case and again several years later in the\nWarner-Lambert case. Obviously, they're taking a\ndifferent position here.\nBut I would submit, Your Honor, that what\nlay at the core of the Buckman decision was that the\nrelationship, the disclosures, between the Federal\nagency and its regulated party, are inherently Federal\nand States simply don't have a business trying to\nenforce those obligations, because that does take away\nfrom the authority and the discretion. And the Court\nlooked to section 337 as evidence that Congress intended\nthat violations of the FDCA be enforced by the Federal\nGovernment.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The Federal agency says\nthat these suits complement, they're not at odds with,\nthe Federal regime, because they give the manufacturers\nan incentive to come forward. Everyone is interested in\nmaking sure that only safe drugs are marketed. So, far\nfrom detracting from the Federal regime, the agency\nresponsible says, this helps us; it encourages\nmanufacturers to report.\nMR. LEFKOWITZ: Well, we know from the\ncurrent FDA database that there were over 1600 requests\nfor labeling revisions that the FDA has not acted on,\nand that's just in the aftermath of Wyeth. And there\nare far more generic manufacturers who would be burdened\nby this new obligation. But, Your Honor, I would -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Is -- is there any\nbreakdown as to how many of those requests are generic\nand how many from branded?\nMR. LEFKOWITZ: Your Honor, almost all of\nthem I would believe are from branded manufacturers,\nbecause generic manufacturers until the briefing in this\nCourt have never believed that they have any obligation\nto ask the FDA.\nIn fact, interestingly, the FDA has\naddressed what happens in the marketplace when a brand\nexits the market and the only drugs left are the 10 or\n15 generics. And what the FDA has said, and they have\npublished 52 Federal Register notices -- we cite one of\nthem in our reply brief -- they have said: In such a\nsituation, we will designate one of the generics to be\nthe leader for purposes of establishing the label, and\neveryone else has to follow.\nBut critically, what the FDA has said is:\nIn those situations, we, the FDA, will tell you when the\nlabel needs to change.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So what are you supposed to\ndo if your company happens by chance to come across a\nvery, very high correlation between people who take your\ngeneric drug and who get seriously ill?\nAnd now what you know is that nobody else\nhas really found that, but, my goodness, there you are;\nit happened that it was associated, a special group or\nsomething. What are you supposed to do?\nMR. LEFKOWITZ: Your Honor, we have an\nobligation, actually, to provide all of that information\nto the FDA. Generics, unlike brand companies, aren't\nequipped in the same way, necessarily, to evaluate\nthe -\nJUSTICE BREYER: And so are they saying that\nyou -- is it conceded in this case that you did tell the\nFDA everything you knew about that?\nMR. LEFKOWITZ: Well, no. We -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Or is that a point in\ndispute?\nMR. LEFKOWITZ: The plaintiffs allege that\nwe violated Federal disclosure obligations. Of course,\nthere's no basis for a State claim for that.\nIn fact, to -- to address Justice Ginsburg's\nquestion -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, how would it\nconflict? Suppose the State said: Here is what we\nwant; we notice that it says in the Federal law that you\nmust keep your warnings up to date, and if you find an\nassociation, you must revise your warning. Now, we\nunderstand you can't do that without FDA approval. But\nas far as our State is concerned, we think that when you\ncome across this serious problem you have to tell the\nFDA in some form or other, a reasonable form, about it.\nWould that law -- is there anything Federal that that\nlaw would conflict with?\nMR. LEFKOWITZ: I think that law, Your\nHonor, would conflict with the Buckman principles and\nthe ArkLa principles.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I thought you said you had\nto tell the FDA about it.\nMR. LEFKOWITZ: If the -- I understood\nJustice Breyer's question to be asking whether -- not\nonly did we have to tell the FDA, which we clearly do,\nbut whether we then had some additional duty to ask the\nFDA to change the warning.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. I didn't understand\nthat.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What I wonder -- see, I\nwonder if that's this case. I wonder if this case is\nwhat they're saying is: Oh, we concede you told the FDA\nevery single thing, so they were just as informed as you\nare about the risks here, but you did not add the words:\nAnd please change our -- your permission, so that we can\nchange the warning. Is that what this case is about?\nMR. LEFKOWITZ: Well, I think that's what\nthey're suggesting. But even if it were just the\nformer -\nJUSTICE BREYER: When they come up here they\nmight say this isn't just what this case is about.\nMR. LEFKOWITZ: Even if it's just the\nformer, Your Honor, even if it's just the failure to\ndisclose adverse reports -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yeah.\nMR. LEFKOWITZ: -- which we know we have an\nobligation to do, there is no history of State\nregulation of communications between Federal -- Federal\nagencies and the regulated parties. Those are not the\nkinds of parallel claims cases, like in Lohr v.\nMedtronic -\nJUSTICE BREYER: So your argument is that if\nwe run across this tremendous, really serious -- I can\nmake an imaginary as serious as you want -- really a\nserious problem, and you're saying the State has no\nright to say -- even if we purposely didn't tell\nanybody, they can't get involved because they can't get\ninvolved with our failure to tell the FDA anything\nbecause that's Federal, and we can't -- they can't get\ninvolved with our failure to try to change the warning\nbecause that's taken care of by our obligation to tell\nthem, which we didn't fulfill?\nMR. LEFKOWITZ: Justice Breyer, correct,\nbecause that's exactly -- remember, in Buckman what\nhappened was an individual was injured because the\ncompany had not accurately disclosed, in fact had misled\nthe agency about the purpose of marketing these bone\nscrews. Clearly there was a State interest in\nprotecting and providing a remedy to that consumer, a\nState interest in ensuring accurate disclosures to the\ngovernment, and in fact an allegation that had there\nbeen accurate disclosures to the government, the FDA\nwould have made a different safety and labeling\ndetermination.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So you say that if the\nclaim here is simply that you did not disclose properly,\nthat claim could be brought?\nMR. LEFKOWITZ: Not in a State court, Your\nHonor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: To disclose -- I'm\nsorry. To disclose to the FDA?\nMR. LEFKOWITZ: Correct.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: To disclose to the FDA.\nMR. LEFKOWITZ: A claim, Your Honor, of\ndisclosure to the FDA relates to the inherently Federal\nrelationship.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But you just described\nBuckman as -- as involving precisely that, failure to\ntell the FDA the purpose of the screws. You said that\nthe State -- the State suit would lie because of that\nfailure.\nMR. LEFKOWITZ: No, I said the State suit --\nI apologize. I meant to say and I thought I said the\nState suit would not lie because Buckman preempts that\ntype of lawsuit. Buckman says even in that terrible\nsituation, misleading to the FDA, failure to disclose\nwhat the FDA requires you to disclose, there is no State\ncause of action because this is a uniquely Federal area\nand States can't supplant the FDA in its enforcement\ndiscretion.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: But Mr. Lefkowitz, I think\nwhat the Respondents would say is that you are\nmischaracterizing their complaint and making it into\nsomething that it's not. Their complaint is a standard\nstate failure to warn claim. Now, you have a preemption\ndefense to that claim, and in that preemption defense\nthere's going to be questions about your disclosure\nobligations and whether the FDA would have responded in\na certain way to your disclosure obligations, but it's\nin a fundamentally different posture than the one that\nyou're suggesting.\nMR. LEFKOWITZ: Justice Kagan, I would agree\nwith you that what they pled below was a traditional\nfailure to warn. A failure to warn claim means you did\nnot warn the public in the way that we think under State\nlaw you should have. And whereas in Wyeth the Congress\nthrough the FDA has said a brand manufacturer ultimately\nis responsible for the warnings it issues and therefore\ncan change the warning and therefore can be held liable,\nwe don't have -- and the government agrees with us -- we\ndon't have any mechanism under law to change the\nwarnings. So to the extent this is a traditional\nfailure to warn claim, it has to be preempted under\nsimple Supremacy Clause principles.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Well, I agree that you don't\nhave any ability yourself to change the warning, but\nhere's what the FDA has said. The FDA has said if an\nANDA applicant -- and that's you; you're an ANDA\napplicant -- believes new safety information should be\nadded to a product's labeling, presumably because\nthey've gotten information that suggests that the\nproduct's labeling is wrong, then it should contact the\nFDA, and the FDA will determine whether the labeling for\nthe generic and listed drugs should be revised.\nMR. LEFKOWITZ: Your Honor, that is exactly\nwhat the FDA says. They point for that to a preamble in\n1992 to a rulemaking that didn't address the relevant\n201.57 regulation, a preamble that was issued without\nnotice and comment rulemaking, and a preamble that\ndoesn't actually impose a duty. It says if,\nsubjunctively, we believe that there should be a label\nchange, we should do something, we should ask the FDA.\nNot we must, not we shall.\nAnd even then it said: And the FDA will\nthen make a decision, which makes clear that this is not\na decision for State juries to make. Your Honor, the\nFDA has articulated a Federal duty today in its briefing\nin this case that is very much at odds with what it has\nspecifically said about what a generic's obligation is\nunder 201.57. In the two notice and comment rulemakings\nat issue during the relevant time period here, in 2000\nand 2006, what the FDA said very specifically was a\ngeneric's obligation under 201.57 is to use the brand\nlabel, even if the brand label isn't the most\nup-to-date.\nAnd the reason is the policy underlying\nHatch-Waxman is that brand companies do safety and\nefficacy testing; generics do sameness testing.\nGenerics are required to make copies of the drugs and by\ndefinition make copies of the labels, because it\nwouldn't make any sense to go into a drugstore to buy\nAdvil and to see 15 different generic ibuprofen and to\nhave 15 different sets of warnings.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, do you think -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Buckman was a case -- I'm\npronouncing it right, I think, Buckman -- where it was a\nbranded manufacturer, was it not?\nMR. LEFKOWITZ: It was a medical device\nmanufacturer.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: A medical device\nmanufacturer. So there it was -- it was an FDA process,\nand we said there's no State cause of action for saying\nthat the FDA process -- that's slightly different from\nsaying that you have a duty to warn the FDA. You might\nsay it's a fortiori.\nMR. LEFKOWITZ: Your Honor, I do think it's\na fortiori. Buckman involves the branded process of\ncoming on with an equivalent medical device under the\n510K process. This is actually a situation where, after\nintensive back and forth with the FDA, the brand company\ncrafts the label that the FDA approves and the generic\nis given one responsibility by Congress. The\nresponsibility is to maintain the same label as the\nbrand. That's the critical difference.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, do you think\nCongress really intended to create a market in which\nconsumers can only sue brand-named products? Because if\nthat's the case, why would anybody ever take a genetic?\nAnd why in the world would Congress create a different,\nor even the FDA, a different obligation on brand-named\nproducts or generic products to give them information\nabout labels when they know there's been a misbranding?\nWhat the government says is you start by\ninstructing a jury that there had to actually have been\ninformation that proved a misbranding. That's the first\nstep of the tort suit according to the government. So\nwhy should you or why would Congress or the FDA have\nintended to treat the two differently?\nMR. LEFKOWITZ: Justice Sotomayor, I want to\ntake both halves of your question. In 27 years of\nenforcement under Hatch-Waxman, the FDA has never once\nsaid that a generic drug that uses the brand label, as\nrequired under 505(j) of the statute is misbranded. And\nthe -- look, I understand that from the consumer's\nperspective it may not make a lot of sense. But what\nCongress specifically said is that a generic has to bear\nthe same label, and it's because they do have different\npurposes, different functions. Congress said that\nwhenever there is a brand drug on the market that no\nlonger is protected by its patent monopoly but has been\nselling for $10 or $20 a pill, we want to have generics\nselling for pennies for the pill, and they've given\nbranded and generics different obligations.\nAnd the different obligations are seen most\nclearly through the prism of the Wyeth case. The Wyeth\ncase was -- it was critical in the Wyeth case that this\nCourt found that the brand company had the ability, had\nthe obligation, to use the CBE regulations to actually\nchange the label, whereas here what the FDA has said\ntime and time again is: We'll tell a generic when the\ngeneric has to change the label, because we don't assume\nthat the generics are going to know when the label\nshould change because they don't have the same basis of\nclinical testing and results.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Lefkowitz, there's a\ncertain overlap, is there not? Some of the generics are\nmade by the same people that make the brand-name drugs,\nisn't that so?\nMR. LEFKOWITZ: That is correct, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And at least for those\npeople, they have the means.\nMR. LEFKOWITZ: Your Honor, I don't know\nwhether or not the -- the FDA or this Court would hold\ndifferently in a case where the generic at issue was an\nauthorized generic, a generic manufactured by a brand\ncompany that had, in fact, done all the clinical safety\ntesting and might have a different basis for assessing\nthe occasional adverse reports that they get.\nBut, again, the keys to understanding the -\nthe generic industry -- generics rarely even get adverse\nreports because if a doctor prescribes a drug, the\ndoctor prescribes it as the brand, and then checks off\nthe box that says a generic can be issued. If a patient\ncomes and tells him about an adverse report, the doctor\nhas no idea which generic of the 15 that might be in the\nmarket actually was dispensed, so he'll actually tell\nthe brand company. He'll report the adverse event to\nthe brand company.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, all you're\narguing is that this rule will have little practical\neffect, that there is going to be very few lawsuits that\ncould be brought against your companies because you're\njust not going to have enough information to suggest a\nlabel change.\nMR. LEFKOWITZ: Your Honor, what I'm arguing\nis that for the FDA to impose a new Federal obligation\nthat will significantly change the way generic companies\nconduct their business should go through notice and\ncomment rulemaking. It should not rely on a preamble to\na different rulemaking that didn't go through notice and\ncomment. It should not rely on briefs that are filed at\nthe merits stage, because this would totally change the\nway generics do business.\nGenerics don't have a practice -- they're\nnot even set up -- to go and figure out what label\nchanges would be appropriate. They are set up to report\nadverse events to the FDA, and what Congress has said\nand what the FDA has said is violations of those\nstatutes, violations of those regulations, are\nexclusively within the province of the Federal\ngovernment. That's what Buckman says very clearly when\nit looks at Section 337.\nIf I may, I would like to reserve my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Lefkowitz.\nMr. Bograd.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF LOUIS M. BOGRAD\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. BOGRAD: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe central issue in this case is that\nPetitioners, in the face of considerable information\nthat the warnings on their products were inadequate, did\nnothing. The generic drug companies' position is that\nthey -- no matter how much they know, no matter how\ngrave the risk, they are under no obligation to do\nanything to warn of the dangers of the products they\nsell.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, they're -- they're -\nthey're under the obligation to report to the FDA the\nfacts which establish the grave risk, right?\nMR. BOGRAD: Yes, they are, Your Honor.\nThey're obliged under -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So the argument here is\nwhether it -- it will be the FDA ultimately that\ndetermines whether there was a grave enough risk to\nmodify the -- the label or whether that call will be\nmade by -- by a State court guessing what the FDA would\nhave done, right?\nMR. BOGRAD: No, Your Honor, that's not\ncorrect. What this Court said in Wyeth v. Levine is\nthat State juries are a perfectly appropriate vehicle\nfor assessing whether warnings in the past were\nadequately given. We do -- we do not dispute that the\nissue about what language will be on a label going\nforward rests with the agency.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yeah, but -- but -- no,\nbut -- but surely you have to establish not only that\nthe generic manufacturer requested a label change, but\nthat a label change would have been approved. Otherwise\nthere's no causation. Surely -\nMR. BOGRAD: That's correct, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- that's part of your\ncase, isn't it?\nMR. BOGRAD: No, it's not, Justice Scalia.\nThe -- as Petitioners concede in the brief, under\ntraditional State law failure to warn claim, our\naffirmative case is that the warnings that were given to\nthe doctor and to the patient were inadequate, and that\nbecause adequate warnings weren't given, the patient was\ninjured.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No, but -- but their -\ntheir preemption claim is we had to give these warnings,\nand you don't contest that. They had to give the\nwarnings that they gave, unless the FDA said that the\nwarnings must be changed, so -\nMR. BOGRAD: Your Honor -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- I mean, I don't see how\nyou can hold them liable, so long as they continued to\ngive the warnings that they had to give.\nMR. BOGRAD: Your Honor -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And they could have lobbied\nthe FDA to say, you know, change the warning, but if the\nFDA said -- suppose the -- suppose they did tell the\nFDA, please modify the label, and the FDA said no.\nWould your lawsuit still proceed?\nMR. BOGRAD: No, it would not, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No.\nMR. BOGRAD: Once the FDA said no, we would\nhave clear evidence that the FDA would have rejected the\nwarning -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I would say -\nMR. BOGRAD: -- which is what this Court\nsaid in Levine is the touchstone.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: All right. You're drawing\na line between the FDA rejecting a warning and the FDA\nnot accepting the warning; is that the line you're\ndrawing?\nMR. BOGRAD: Yes, Your Honor, for purposes\nof impossibility. In order for the -- preemption is an\naffirmative defense, and for the defendants to establish\nthat it was impossible, i.e., that the duties under\nState and Federal law were in direct conflict, they have\nto show that the FDA would have rejected -\nJUSTICE BREYER: It appears also that the -\nit's Buckman, it seems to me, the relevant case, not\nWyeth, because what -- if -- you're now saying, I've\nlearned, that -- that they have a set of FDA duties;\nthey must tell the FDA every detail.\nMR. BOGRAD: Well -\nJUSTICE BREYER: That sounds awfully\nfamiliar to Buckman, where the State claim was basically\na claim of fraud on the FDA. And we said it's not up to\nthe State to -- to -- they can't bring -- have a claim\nfor fraud on the FDA. The FDA has to enforce their own\nstuff. And why isn't the same true here, that the FDA\nhas to enforce their own legal requirement to tell us\neverything you know? What's the answer to that?\nMR. BOGRAD: Well, there are two answers,\nYour Honor. First -- first, this Court's decision in\nLevine is inconsistent with that sweeping reading -\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, because Levine involves\nthe Wyeth case, right?\nMR. BOGRAD: Yes. I'm sorry, I -\nJUSTICE BREYER: No. The -- the difference\nthere is the difference that the SG points out: There\nis a broad-ranging obligation for the initial drugmaker\nto tell the FDA all kinds of things and change the\nwarnings. But here the FDA tells us they have no power\nto change their warnings. They can't, unlike Levine.\nThey have to copy the original maker. So -- I'm -- I'm\njust referring there to the whole SG brief.\nMR. BOGRAD: Your Honor, let me respond to\nthat in -- in two ways. First -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Be sure you answer, please,\nmy original question.\nMR. BOGRAD: I -- I will, Your Honor.\nThe -- to focus first on the CBE issue, one\nof the things this Court noted in Levine is that even\nunder the CBE process, the ultimate decision about\nwhether the labeling is changed rests with the FDA, not\nwith the manufacturer. The -- the fundamental issue in\nLevine was that the primary responsibility for labeling\nrested with the manufacturer, not with the agency,\nsubject to the agency's review. And we don't dispute\nthat the agency has the right to review and can reject a\nlabel.\nThe -- what was at the core and what this\nCourt cited, although the -- the number has changed in\nWyeth v. Levine, is the obligation under 21 CFR\n201.57(e), which you call 201.80(e) because they -- they\nrenumbered it -- that the label warnings shall be\nrevised as soon as there's reasonable evidence of an\nassociation of a serious hazard with the drug.\nThe government says, and the regulatory\nstructure makes clear, that that provision applies with\nfull force to generic drug manufacturers, not just to\nname-brand drug manufacturers. It is the regulatory\nimplementation of the obligation under the Federal\nmisbranding statute, 21 U.S.C. 352(f)(2) that says you\ncan't sell a drug that doesn't have adequate warnings\nabout its risks.\nSo, when you're -- when the manufacturer is\nconfronted with information that the warnings on its\ndrug are not adequate, it -- the way it -- the way it\nshould respond is by immediately going to the FDA and\nsaying to the agency: We have this new information; we\nask you, not that we want a different warning from the\nname brand, but we ask you to approve a stronger warning\non both the name-brand product and its generic\nequivalents.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But what happens -\nMR. BOGRAD: And had they done so, we would\nknow -- one of two things would have happened. Either\nthe agency would have approved the warning, stronger\nwarnings would have been given and our clients -- my\nclients likely would not have been injured; or they\nwould have said, no, we don't think there's sufficient\ninformation to justify this warning.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How long does it\ntake -- how long typically does it take the FDA to\nrespond to a request from a generic manufacturer that\nit -- it ask the branded manufacturer to change the\nlabel?\nMR. BOGRAD: Your Honor, as you just heard\nfrom Mr. Lefkowitz, generic manufacturers typically\nhaven't been fulfilling this obligation and have not\nbeen asking the agency. But the latest data from the\nagency, and this is from its -- its web site, is that\nunder -- they've been publishing performance data since\n2007, and they now say that safety labeling changes,\nwhich are the labeling changes required under FD -\nunder FDA, are processed typically in a matter of\nmonths, 94 percent within 3 months.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Are those the ones\nthat are submitted by generic manufacturers?\nMR. BOGRAD: They're -- they are -- they\ncould be ones submitted by generic manufacturers. Those\nare ones where the information that comes to the agency\ntriggers a -- a labeling revision process.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Does the -- does the -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- whether about -\nMR. BOGRAD: I'm sorry, what was that?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I was just going to\nask, does the FDA give you an up or a down, or does it\njust not take action sometimes if you submit one of\nthese requests?\nMR. BOGRAD: Your Honor, my understanding -\nthere were certainly procedures available that would\nhave required an up-or-down: The citizens petition\nprocess, for example, the supplement process, for\nexample. The -- what -- the government has represented\nthat even if the request came in a more informal form,\nthe government would nevertheless take a request for a\n-- a labeling change to reflect a serious inadequacy in\nlabel warning seriously and act on it promptly.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Just so I understand what\nyou've said, this 3-month turnaround that you mentioned,\nthey are all requests from labeled manufacturers, right?\nMR. BOGRAD: No, Your Honor, these are -\nthese are actually -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I thought you said that\ngeneric manufacturers don't make any requests.\nMR. BOGRAD: I -- they could be -- they\ncould be from name-brand companies; they could be from\nprivate citizens.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, okay.\nMR. BOGRAD: It's whenever the agency\nbecomes aware of information.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, I see.\nMR. BOGRAD: But the agency also processes\nsupplement requests, according to its web site, in 97\npercent of the cases or something, within 4 months.\nIt's not -- it's -- it is a matter of months, not -- not\nyears.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Can you, and I think\nthat this is part of what your adversary has been\ntalking about when he says we don't usually receive\nadverse incident reports; they go to the brand\nmanufacturer. So tell me what you view as your main\nobligation. This is a little bit like what Justice\nScalia was asking.\nYou come in and you say there's a drug, it\nhas an adverse effect, there should have been a warning\nabout it because look at all of this literature, look at\nall of this proof -\nMR. BOGRAD: Uh-huh.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- that this drug is, in\nfact, in some way plausibly or otherwise causing this\nincident, and the label was inadequate to tell me not to\ndo it. Is that your obligation completely? You don't\nhave an obligation to show that this particular\nmanufacturer knew that in some way?\nMR. BOGRAD: Well, under most -- under the\nlaw of most States, and this is true in both Louisiana\nand Minnesota, there is a reasonableness element in a\nfailure to warn claim, but it's -- the standard is \"knew\nor should have known,\" so that the manufacturer -\nmanufacturers are typically held to the -- to the\nknowledge of an expert in the field of the products they\nmanufacture. And here the -- our contention has been\nthat if the generic manufacturers had merely examined\nthe publicly available FDA database of adverse event\nreports, and merely paid attention to reports in the\npublished literature that had since 19 -- the early\n1990s had documented a serious association between\nlong-term use of metoclopramide and tardive dyskinesia,\nthey would have had more than sufficient information to\nsay to the agency, we need a change here.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Does a generic manufacturer\nhave to be an expert in the field in which it\nmanufactures?\nMR. BOGRAD: Under State law, yes, it does,\nYour Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What does -- what does\nbeing an expert mean?\nMR. BOGRAD: It means -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: In this context, being an\nexpert means being able to produce exactly the drug that\nhas been approved by the FDA, right? You don't have to\nbe expert in anything else?\nMR. BOGRAD: That's incorrect, Your Honor.\nThey have to be -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What else do they need?\nMR. BOGRAD: They have to remain informed of\nthe dangers posed by the products they sell. They have\nobligations -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That doesn't make them an\nexpert. I'm talking about what expertise does -- does\nthe company have to -- to possess. It surely has to\npossess the chemical expertise to produce exactly the\nproduct that the -- that the -- that has been approved\nby the FDA. What other expertise is necessary?\nMR. BOGRAD: Well, Your Honor, one of their\nobligations under Federal law is to go to the agency\nevery year and identify significant new information that\nwould affect the safety or efficacy or labeling of their\nproduct, which means they have to have the capacity to\nevaluate information that is out there, and that -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't think that'd take\nany expertise. You have people who complain, I've taken\n-- I've taken your pill, and it -- it, you know, it's\ncaused -- this is expertise? That's not what I normally\nthink of. Whereas a drug manufacturer does, indeed,\nrequire expertise, conducting tests and knowing what\nchanges will produce what results and so forth; right?\nMR. BOGRAD: No, Your Honor. In fact, in\nthis particular context we're talking about a use that\nwas never approved by the FDA. We're talking about use\nbeyond 12 weeks, which had never been evaluated. So\nthere's really no basis to assume that the name-brand\nmanufacturer here had any more expertise -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Suppose they had. Suppose\nthat -- is a generic required to file adverse incident\nreports?\nMR. BOGRAD: Yes, they are, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay. Now, imagine a\ncompany that files every adverse incident report,\ncomplies completely; period. Now, in your view does it\nhave an additional obligation?\nMR. BOGRAD: Yes, it does, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And what is that?\nMR. BOGRAD: It has an obligation under\n201.57(e) to initiate a label change -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay.\nMR. BOGRAD: -- process whenever it has\nreasonable -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Now, their argument is that\nin respect to their failure to do the first, that's\nBuckman. That is similar to Buckman.\nMR. BOGRAD: All right. If we -- we were\ntalking about -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Now. And that's what I -\nnow, as to the second, it just doesn't add anything.\nThe FDA has all that information.\nMR. BOGRAD: Oh, that's -- that's incorrect,\nJustice Breyer.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. Now, why is it?\nMR. BOGRAD: It's -- well, as this Court\nsaid in Levine, the FDA has 11,000 drugs it needs to\nmonitor and stay on top of, and it doesn't have the\nresources necessary to pay attention to every adverse\nevent report it gets and every report that is published\nin the scientific literature. The reason that\nmanufacturers bear the primary responsibility is because\nthey -- they need to trigger the FDA's focus on a\nparticular issue here. Here this information was\navailable since the mid '90s.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Your basic argument, I'm\ngetting this now, that -- I think -- is that the\nfailure is, where State law has a right to enter, is to\nrequire them to keep track of adverse incidents and\nother things in the -- and do their best to change the\nlabel, which will consist of going to the FDA, likely,\nand asking them to change.\nMR. BOGRAD: Exactly, Your Honor. Their\nobligation -- their obligation under State law is to\nprovide a warning. What they should have done, and if\nyou take -- what they should have done is go to the FDA\nand ask the FDA to approve a stronger warning. If the\nFDA had said no, they would have a preemption.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel -\nJUSTICE ALITO: Suppose a generic -- suppose\nthat the FDA issued a rule that says a generic drug\nmanufacturer has no obligation to request a change in\nlabeling. Could a generic drug manufacturer be held\nliable on a failure to warn claim on the theory that it\ncould have lobbied the FDA to change the rule that says\nthat the generic drug manufacturer has no obligation to\nask for a change in labeling?\nMR. BOGRAD: I -- I don't have an immediate\nanswer to that, Justice Alito. The -- the -- the State\n-- the -- I -- the question is whether there would be a\ndirect conflict between State and Federal law. It seems\nto me unless -- I'm sorry. Oh, that's the 5 minute\nlight.\nUnless the -\nJUSTICE ALITO: Isn't that why -- isn't that\nwhere your theory leads?\nMR. BOGRAD: My -- my theory leads to the -\nto the proposition that, unless Federal law precludes\nthem from -- from going to the process of strengthening\ntheir warning label, then the State may legitimately\nenforce its obligation to protect its citizens' health\nand safety. I think it's important in this regard -\nJUSTICE ALITO: But your theory is that they\nhave a duty to pursue an informal process that is\nnowhere provided for under the FDA rules; and so I don't\n-- so it's a duty to lobby the FDA basically to change\nthe rules, isn't that right?\nMR. BOGRAD: Justice Alito, well, as you\nknow, we disagree with the government about whether\ncertain formal processes were available. But -\nJUSTICE ALITO: Assuming that they're\ncorrect in their interpretation of their own\nregulations.\nMR. BOGRAD: But assuming -- but -- but if\nwe're talking -- but there may not be a formal process,\nbut there is a formal obligation, both under statute,\nnot to sell a misbranded drug, and under regulation, to\nrevise your labeling as soon as there's reasonable\nevidence of an association of a serious hazard with the\ndrug. And I think it's -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: What is your -- what is\nyour explanation for why Buckman isn't applicable here?\nMR. BOGRAD: Because, Your Honor, this is -\nand I should start by saying that in Buckman there was\n-- the suit was not against the manufacturer; the suit\nin Buckman was against a consultant that -- that helped\nthe manufacturer get FDA approval. There was a separate\nproduct liability action against the manufacturer that\nhad already been litigated and settled.\nThe -- Buckman said: We're not talking\nabout traditional causes of action, State law causes of\naction like in Lohr, or like in -- or as this Court\nagain said in Wyeth v. Levine; we're talking about a\ncase where the whole centrality of the claim is premised\non the relationship between the company -- or the\ndefendant and the agency.\nThis is not that case. We're -- this case\nis about the -- the duty that the company owes to my\nclients and their doctors to provide them with adequate\nwarnings. That duty, which is -- has been recognized by\nthis Court innumerable times, complements the FDA\nstatutory scheme by creating incentives for companies\nlike the Petitioners to -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, the suit was brought\nby the injured person in Buckman.\nMR. BOGRAD: But -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And it's similar in that\nrespect. And in Buckman there was a -- a formal\nrelationship which did not permit the cause of action,\nand it seems to me you could at least argue that a\nfortiori there should be no cause of action when there\nan informal relationship.\nMR. BOGRAD: I -- I'm not sure I follow the\na fortiori point in this context, Your Honor. But in\nBuckman there was no relationship whatsoever between the\nconsultant, the Buckman Company, and the injured person.\nThe Buckman Company's dealing were -- had been\nexclusively with the agency.\nThey had had no dealing whatsoever -- they\nhad not failed to warn. That's why we -- the plaintiffs\nhad created this bizarre cause of action, and it's -- we\nthink it's a wholly distinguishable case.\nI think it's important to remember, first\noff, the world in which we live today. 70 percent of\nall prescriptions are filled with generic drugs. A\nthird of generic drugs no longer have name-brand\ncompetitors at all, because the economic -- because the\nname brands have withdrawn from the market, so that -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Somebody has been appointed\nin all those cases to sort of carry the flag, right?\nMR. BOGRAD: Somebody has been appointed to\nbe the reference-listed drug. They have not been\nappointed to have obligations distinct from the other\ngeneric companies as far as updating label claims.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Don't they have a distinct\nobligation to propose labeling changes when they -- when\nthey think they're necessary?\nMR. BOGRAD: I -- Your Honor, that would be\na question better directed to Mr. Kneedler, but I don't\nbelieve -- I don't believe that there's a -- there's a\ndifference.\nAny -- we have a system today where every\nState has a drug substitution law that drives\nprescriptions to be filled with generics rather than\nname-brand products. We have a system where Medicare,\nMedicaid, and insurers force or encourage the\nsubstitution of generics through -- through price\nincentives. If generics are not responsible, in many of\nthese cases no one is responsible.\nThe -- we -- the position that the generics\nare proposing here is one in which they would be immune\nfrom liability for selling a product with inadequate\nwarnings, even though the name-brand company selling the\nsame drug with the same warnings would be liable. There\nis no suggestion anywhere in the record, Your Honor,\nanywhere in the legislative history or in the text of\nHatch-Waxman or in FDA regulations that that distinction\nwas ever contemplated by Congress, that it was ever\nsanctioned by the FDA.\nI would like to make one final point, Your\nHonor. In Bates -- and I apologize; we didn't address\nthis specifically in our briefs, because I didn't notice\nit until later -- the statutory scheme at issue in\nBates, under FIFRA, was almost identical to the -- I'm\nsorry. I see my time has expired. May I finish my\npoint, Your Honor?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You can finish your\nsentence.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Make it a long sentence,\nwith a lot of \"ands.\"\n(Laughter.)\nMR. BOGRAD: There was no CBE equivalent in\nBates in the -- under the FIFRA statutory scheme, and\nyet this Court upheld against a motion to dismiss on\npreemption grounds a failure to warn claim, admittedly\nunder an express preemption provision. This Court\nupheld a claim against a pesticide manufacturer even\nthough the pesticide manufacturer could not have changed\nits warning without prior EPA approval, exactly the same\nsituation that confronts the generics here.\nThank you, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Kneedler.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER,\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,\nSUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. KNEEDLER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe Hatch-Waxman Amendments were designed to\nfacilitate the entry of generic drugs onto the market.\nThey do not absolve a manufacturer of his\nresponsibilities after entry onto the market to maintain\nthe safety of the drug and the adequacy of -- of the\nlabel.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Kneedler, suppose\nthat I'm not sure I agree with you that there is an\nobligation of the kind that you say for a generic drug\nmanufacturer to come forward and request a label, but I\ndo think that there's an opportunity for that\nmanufacturer to come forward and ask the FDA to revise a\nlabel. If that's the way I read the law, does your\nresult follow? Do you think, then, that State law\nclaims should be able to go forward?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Yes, we do, because the\nultimate question in the preemption case is whether\nthere's a conflict. And if the -- if the manufacturer\nhas an opportunity to come to FDA, even if -- even if\nthe Court were to conclude it didn't have an obligation\nto do so, if it had the opportunity to do so and did\nnothing when -- when dramatic evidence, you know, by\nhypothesis, came to its attention, it wasn't prohibited\nfrom doing so. There was no -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I assume that the\npatient's physician has the same opportunity. Anybody\ncould go to the FDA and say this label ought to be\nchanged, right? So the -- the physician taking care of\nthis plaintiff didn't -- had the opportunity to go to\nthe FDA and didn't. Is there a cause of action against\nhim?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, the -- the FDCA does\nnot regulate the responsibilities of physicians in those\nsituations. The whole point of the labeling -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I'm not talking about what\nthe -- the FDCA regulation. We're talking about what\nState law would allow, and State law would allow a suit\nagainst the physician because he did not take advantage\nof the opportunity to go to the FDA and propose a label\nchange.\nMR. KNEEDLER: No, I think State law\nwould -- would impose an obligation on the physician to\nadequately advise the patient, but what's so different\nis, the physician relies upon the labeling. If the\nphysician has the information, the physician, on his own\ninitiative, could tell the patient or warn the patient\nabout what's going on without -- without having to go to\nFDA at all.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So if your theory of\nthe case is accepted, this is what will happen: Every\ntime a generic manufacturer gets an adverse incident\nreport, it will send that on to the FDA, and there will\nbe a boilerplate sentence at the end of it saying, We\nthink you should consider revising the labels because of\nthis, and then, under your theory, that manufacturer is\ncompletely protected from State suits?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Several things. The\nmanufacturer does, of course, have the obligation to\nfurnish the adverse event information that it receives.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Sure.\nMR. KNEEDLER: But if -- if the standard in\nregulation 57(e) is met, where there's evidence,\nreasonable evidence, of a serious hazard, it has an\nobligation -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, they're not\ngoing to take a chance. They're going to say, if you're\nthe FDA, you look at it. We're just telling you what we\nknow, and we think you ought to consider revising the\nlabel.\nMR. KNEEDLER: But they are -- they are to\npropose -- in our view, are to propose a labeling\nchange, which means that the -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay. We think you\nshould revise the label; if you agree, this is what it\nshould look like.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Yes, and we don't -- we don't\nthink it will lead to a flood of such requirements in\nthe wake of this -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Does it lead to\npreemption?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Pardon me?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Does it lead to\npreemption?\nMR. KNEEDLER: If the -- if FDA rejected the\nrequest, there would -- there would be preemption,\nbecause FDA -- it would have been submitted to the\nexpert agency, as we think is required.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right. Wouldn't\nyou -- if you were the generic company's lawyer, you\nwould advise them to do that in every case, right?\nMR. KNEEDLER: I don't think I -- I don't\nthink in every case. I think it's -- if -- but here,\nhere we have a situation where, at least according to\nthe allegations, there were published studies of\nlong-term use of this product.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, I know that's\nwhat this case is, but if -- a reasonable generic\nmanufacturer would be worried about every case, and it\nwould just add this boilerplate language at the end of\nevery letter, and as I understand your theory, they\nwould be protected.\nMR. KNEEDLER: It's not just boilerplate\nevidence at the bottom of the -- as part of a letter.\nWhat the -- what the Federal Register notice told the\nmanufacturer to do was to -- was to submit the proposal\nto FDA with supporting information. In other words,\nsuppose it's the sort of submission that would -- that\nwould be like -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That would be the -- the\nprologue -- the prologue to the rule said that, and the\nrule was never submitted for notice and comment. Is\nthat what you're relying on, that prologue?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, I -- I think, to put it\nin context, these were the regulations actually\nimplementing the Hatch-Waxman statute, and there was a\nproposal to allow the manufacturers to deviate from\nthe -- from the NDA holders' label and put their own on\nit. And the -- and FDA said, no, you can't do that, but\nwhat you should do is bring it to FDA, and FDA will\ndecide whether to change the labels for everyone.\nAnd so this was part and parcel of the\nnotice and comment rulemaking: How should -- how should\na generic manufacturer deal with a situation where it\nhas information that may deviate from the NDA\nholder's -- how should it -\nJUSTICE ALITO: Has the FDA made any\ncalculation of the economic consequences of imposing\nthis duty on generic drug manufacturers? I don't know\nwhether this is a good idea or not, but it does seem to\nme that it may significantly increase the costs for\ngeneric drug manufacturers, and therefore counteract one\nof the objectives of the statute, which was to provide\ngeneric drugs at a low cost.\nMR. KNEEDLER: To my knowledge, FDA has not\ndone an analysis. But it's important to understand the\nduty here derives from the misbranding provisions. A\ngeneric drug manufacturer is not exempt from the\nmisbranding requirements of the act, which prohibit\ndistributing a drug that does not have adequate -\nadequate warnings, and rule 57(e) requiring a\nmanufacturer to propose a warning or to make a warning\nchange if there is evidence of a serious hazard\nimplements that misbranding requirement. So this is not\nan imposition by FDA. This is an underlying requirement\nof the act.\nI would -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Am I -- am I to\nunderstand -- and I think I am understanding you. There\nis a legal obligation in the statute to report adverse\nevents. You're saying that the statute also requires\nevery manufacturer, of whatever type, to monitor the\nsafety of the drug they're selling? Is that what you're\nsaying?\nMR. KNEEDLER: State -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And if reasonable\nevidence, whether directly in their possession or in the\nmarketplace -\nMR. KNEEDLER: The -- the FDA regulations do\nnot explicitly require monitoring of literature, but -\nbut there's no conflict in State law imposing a duty to\ndo that.\nIf I -- if I may just discuss Buckman for a\nminute, because -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: How do you decide whether a\ngeneric manufacturer ought to have proposed a -- a\nlabeling change?\nMR. KNEEDLER: If the standard -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: This is a generic\nmanufacturer. He doesn't know anything about -- about\nscience. He knows how to replicate this pill exactly.\nThat's all -- that's all he really knows.\nNow, what is the test you're going to impose\nto -- to a jury to decide whether this generic\nmanufacturer ought to have -- ought to have proposed a\nlabeling change?\nMR. KNEEDLER: It's the -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Is it -- is it, well, you\nknow, if he had been as well armed scientifically as the\noriginal manufacturer of the labeled drug, he should\nhave known or, you know, does this guy who graduated\nfrom high school and can replicate a pill, should he\nhave known? What -- what's the -\nMR. KNEEDLER: It's the standard in 57(e) if\nthere's evidence of a serious hazard, we think State law\ncan impose on a generic manufacturer which is putting a\npotentially dangerous product on the market the\nobligation to -- to investigate.\nI would -- I would like to talk about\nBuckman for just a minute, please, because it's -- it's\ncome up. Buckman is fundamentally different. There was\nno independent State law duty to warn at issue in\nBuckman. It was solely a tort based on lying to the\nFDA. It is a tort that depended entirely on the\nexistence of the FDA.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And in the brief -\nand in the brief that you filed you said one of the\nconcerns is that people are going to flood the FDA with\nall these warnings and -- and whatever, and that would\ninterfere with the FDA's ability. Now you're telling\nme -- you -- you said when you started out that you\nthink it's unlikely or you don't think it's likely. In\nyour brief it said SG language you said we're not\nprepared to predict that a ruling would do this.\nSo, why is that a difference between those\ntwo cases?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, Buckman was a situation\nof a collateral attack on a decision that had actually\nbeen made by FDA. There was no independent duty --\nState law or duty to warn, no relationship between the\nperson submitting information to FDA. It was just a\nState making the tort to lie to the FDA, and you would\nhave had the State regulating nothing but the\nrelationship between the manufacturer and FDA.\nHere State law is regulating the\nrelationship between the manufacturer and -- and the\npatient through the doctor, and that's a traditional\narea of State regulation, duty to warn, and, Justice\nKagan, I think you're right, the question then is\nwhether there is an affirmative defense of -- of\npreemption, and the preemption comes in. It's very\ndifferent from Buckman in that situation.\nIt's up to the defendant to prove, it's not\nan element of the cause of action as in Buckman. It's\npart of the defense for the defendant to prove that -\nthat it is -- that the cause of action is preempted.\nAnd in our view it's not preempted if the\nstandard in 57(e) is met to propose a labeling change\nthat is an obligation that extends to all manufacturers\ngeneric or not.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but it's\nnot -- the regulation doesn't say propose a labeling\nchange. It says labeling shall be revised, and the one\nthing we know is that the generic manufacturer can't\nrevise the labeling from the branded one.\nMR. KNEEDLER: It can't revise the labeling,\nbut that doesn't mean it can do nothing. Impossibility\npreemption kicks in only when it's genuinely impossible,\nand if the manufacturer could go to FDA and propose a\nlabeling change, it is not impossible for to it do that.\nAt that point it's up to FDA and preemption would kick\nin.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Kneedler.\nMr. Lefkowitz, you have your 5 minutes\nremaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JAY P. LEFKOWITZ\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. LEFKOWITZ: Thank you.\nMr. Kneedler has basically postulated a\nsituation where we're going to have jury trials about\nwhether a Federal duty to the FDA was breached. And\nit's interesting, he says that this isn't Buckman, but\nof course, Buckman involved the same duty not to sell a\ndangerous product, and the same issue of lack of\ndisclosure to the FDA.\nNow, he says it was a collateral attack, but\nactually that was the premise of Justice Stevens'\nconcurrence, where Justice Stevens said I get to the\nsame result for a different reason. What the Court said\nwas nothing about a collateral attack.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, the difference,\nas I see it, is that they're not suing you for a failure\nto tell the FDA. They're suing you for a failure to\ntell them. It's you who are interposing a defense and\nsaying I manufacture a dangerous drug, and I have no\nobligation to monitor and ensure that the label is\naccurate.\nAnd what the government is saying, as I\nunderstand it is, no, you do. Yes, we understand you\nwant to sell more cheaply, but not at the cost of public\nhealth.\nSo what's wrong with that argument?\nMR. LEFKOWITZ: Justice Sotomayor,\nrespectfully, what's wrong with the premises, if they're\nclaiming failure to warn, it's a very simple case of\nimpossibility preemption. We couldn't warn, and the\ngovernment's brief makes clear we had no ability to\nwarn.\nWhat the government is now doing is it's\ntaking a regulation, 201.57, which doesn't say the word\n\"ask\" in it. It actually says \"revise.\" And it says\nrevise because it's a regulation written for brand\nmanufacturers that have the CBE option available to\nthem, and they are then trying to incorporate the words\n\"duty to ask\" through this brief without, as Justice\nAlito says, taking into any account through notice and\ncomment rulemaking the effect of this.\nWell, we know that there are over 1,600\nrequests for labeling revisions pending at the FDA now,\n650 of them are pending for more than 6 months. And at\nthe relevant time of this case, Your Honor, not only\nwould we have had to ask the FDA, but then the FDA would\nhave had to negotiate with the brand, because prior to\nthe FDAAA amendments, the FDA couldn't order a brand to\nchange, so we would have had to make the request, the\nFDA would have had to negotiate the brand change, and\nthen we would have had to follow.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Well, Mr. Lefkowitz, if you\nhad asked, you would be in a different situation. If\nyou had asked and the FDA had sat on it or was\nnegotiating, then you could say, look, we've done all we\ncan right now. But you're not in that situation. You,\nin fact, have not done all you can right now to change\nthe label because you never wrote that letter.\nMR. LEFKOWITZ: Your Honor, and again just\nto pick up on -- on what Chief Justice Roberts said and\nJustice Scalia said, we have done everything we are\nrequired to do, which is to provide all of the\ninformation about adverse reports that we have and all\nof the results of our investigations to the government.\nAnd if the government wants to impose a new duty through\nnotice and comment rulemaking saying, and now we have a\nduty to ask for a label change, in addition -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The government is taking\nthe position that there's no clash between the\ngovernment, the State, and Federal law. It's not saying\nthat you commit some kind of Federal offense if you\ndon't file this law. The government is saying, the\nquestion is preemption. Is there a clash between\nFederal and State law to traditional Federal warn you\nhave a preemption defense if you tell the FDA, and if\neither the FDA does nothing or tells you, no, we're not\ngoing to change the label?\nMR. LEFKOWITZ: Your Honor, Buckman makes\nvery clear that a State trying to regulate disclosure\nobligations to the Federal Government is simply off\nlimits, and in fact -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The -- the -- Buckman was\nabout, was a -- it was a very odd case to be brought\nunder State law for fraud on a Federal agency.\nMR. LEFKOWITZ: Your Honor, it was a case\nbrought by a plaintiff who was injured claiming that the\ncompany had not made proper, adequate disclosures to the\nFDA. It's the same thing here, and I just want to\npoint -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Lefkowitz, do you agree\nwith Justice Ginsburg's characterization of the\ngovernment's position? I thought the government was\nsaying that there was an obligation on the part of the\ngenerics to propose changes.\nMR. LEFKOWITZ: Absolutely. What they are\nsaying -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Otherwise, the government\nwould be saying you have an obligation to lobby, and I\ndon't think they're saying that.\nMR. LEFKOWITZ: Well, in a sense the\ngovernment is really saying we -- to lobby or to propose\nchanges is a -- is a very fine distinction. Clearly,\nwhat the government is now saying is they are reading a\nregulation that they've always interpreted as being only\napplicable to brand companies and saying now it's\napplicable to their companies and it incorporates new\nlanguage that says not just revise but ask.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Lefkowitz. Counsel, the case is submitted.\n(Whereupon, at 11:05 a.m., the case in the\nabove-entitled matter was submitted.)\n22:12 advantage 45:19 allowing 10:22 25:14 36:23 22:18 23:7 36:6\n55:8 adversary
