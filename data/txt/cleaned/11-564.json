GARRE\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. GARRE: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nIn the three prior cases in which this Court\nhas held that a dog sniff is not a search, this Court\nhas emphasized that a dog sniff is unique, both in terms\nof the manner in which information is obtained and the\nnature of the information revealed.\nAs to the latter point, this Court has\nemphasized that a drug detection dog reveals only the\npresence of contraband, and that no one has a legitimate\nexpectation of privacy in that.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I mean, that just can't be\na proposition that we can accept across the board.\nNobody under that view has an interest in contraband in\ntheir home. The question is, can you find out the\ncontraband? It's just a circular argument.\nAnd if -- and in the -- was it the Caballes\ncase that talked about that, if I have the right name?\nThat was where the contraband was visible; it was almost\nlike the smoking gun falls out. Well, of course,\nthere's no interest in the smoking gun when it falls out\nin front of you. So I just don't think that works.\nMR. GARRE: Well, Justice Kennedy, in the\nCaballes case, the contraband wasn't visible before the\ndog alerted.\nIn the home case, we're not saying that you\ndon't have a legitimate expectation of privacy in the\nhome. Of course, you do. The question is whether you\nhave a legitimate expectation --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So doesn't that mean\nthat what's in your home that's not visible to the\npublic has an expectation of privacy as well?\nMR. GARRE: Not when it comes to contraband,\nYour Honor. And we think that the Kyllo case helps --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But that -- that is\ncircular. Then why do you need a search warrant? If\nyou have no expectation of privacy in the contraband,\nwhy bother even with a search warrant?\nMR. GARRE: Because, Your Honor, when you\nhave a search warrant and you go into a home, there's\ngoing to be a lot of private information that you're\ngoing to come across, even if your expectation is\nfinding evidence of a crime.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Garre, does your\nargument mean -- you say minimally intrusive, and that\nthe dog will detect only contraband, that the police\nthen are to go into a neighborhood that's known to be a\ndrug dealing neighborhood, go into -- just go down the\nstreet, have the dog sniff in front of every door, or go\ninto an apartment building?\nIs that -- I gather that that is your\nposition.\nMR. GARRE: Your Honor, they could do that,\njust like the police could go door to door and then\nknock on the doors and hope that they will find out\nevidence of wrongdoing that way.\nBut the two responses this Court has always\npointed to is the restraint on resources and the check\nof community hostility.\nHere, the police were combatting a serious\nepidemic of grow houses, hundreds of houses each year\nthat were a scourge to the community, not only in terms\njust of the drugs that they were growing --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Suppose -- suppose the\nhouse had on the lawn, no dogs allowed?\nMR. GARRE: I think that would be different,\nYour Honor. It would be -- and that's a way in which\nthe house is different than a car. Homeowners can\nrestrict access to people who come up to their front\ndoor by putting gates or a sign out front.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that's right.\nAnd there's such a thing as what is called the curtilage\nof a house.\nAs I understand the law, the police are\nentitled to use binoculars to look into the house if --\nif the residents leave the blinds open, right?\nMR. GARRE: That's right.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But if they can't see\nclearly enough from a distance, they're not entitled to\ngo onto the curtilage of the house, inside the gate, and\nuse the binoculars from that vantage point, are they?\nMR. GARRE: They're not, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why isn't it the same thing\nwith the dog? This dog was brought right up -- right up\nto the -- to the door of the house.\nMR. GARRE: Your Honor, first of all, I\nthink that, as this case comes to the Court, the police\nwere lawfully present at the front door. That was\nestablished by the courts below, and we don't think that\nthey've challenged it here.\nThat's at least true with respect to the\npolice officer. The police officer could go up to the\nfront door and knock and detect the smell of marijuana,\njust like Officer Pedraja did.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, then we've taken an\nunrealistic case, if that has been conceded, because it\nseems to me crucial that this officer went onto the\nportion of the house that -- as to which there is\nprivacy, and -- and used a means of -- of discerning\nwhat was in the house that -- that should not have been\navailable --\nMR. GARRE: Well, I think the way you\nwould --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- in that space.\nMR. GARRE: I think the way that you would\nanswer that question, Your Honor, is, of course, there's\na curtilage that extends around the house and protects,\nin which the homeowner has a reasonable expectation of\nprivacy.\nIt's well established, we think, going back\nto the common law, that there is an implied consent for\npeople, visitors, salesmen, Girl Scouts,\ntrick-or-treaters, to come up to your house and knock on\nthe door --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, but not implied\nconsent for the policeman to come up with the dog. The\nonly purpose of the dog is to detect contraband.\nSo you can say, yes, there's an implied\ninvitation to the Girl Scout cookie seller, to the\npostman, even to the police officer, but not police\nofficer with dog, when the only reason for having the\ndog is to find out if there's contraband in the house.\nMR. GARRE: Well, Justice Ginsburg, first of\nall, I think, if the Girl Scout or the salesman or the\ntrick-or-treater brought up a dog with them, there would\nbe complied consent for that too, at least as long as\nthe dog was on a leash.\nI don't think the subjective --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: This is not any dog.\nThis is a drug detecting dog.\nMR. GARRE: No, that's right. But I don't\nthink it changes the subjective purpose of why they\nbrought the dog with them.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Why is that an implied\nconsent? That's a huge assumption. At least in the\ncities that I've lived in, you have to have a dog on a\nleash. And you don't give implied consent. If you're\nallergic to animals, you don't want dogs walking around\nat your door.\nMR. GARRE: Well, you can certainly put the\n\"No Dogs Allowed\" sign out front. And there, there\nwould not be implied consent.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No, no, no. But tell me\nwhy that you presume that there's implied consent?\nMR. GARRE: Well, we start with the\nproposition that --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Do you think homeowners\nfreely let dogs just come into their apartment? I mean,\nthere might be some homes that do.\nMR. GARRE: Well, certainly not in the\napartment, Your Honor. This search took place, the dog\nwalked up the same way that a salesman would and alerted\nat the front of the door. He didn't go in --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So we're going to treat\nit like a human being now? You're invited to knock on\nmy door because you're a dog?\nMR. GARRE: No, I think -- and certainly\nthis is true in my neighborhood, Your Honor, is\nneighbors can bring their dog up on the leash when they\nknock on your front door, and I think that's true in\nmost neighborhoods in America.\nHomeowners that don't like dogs and want\nthem off their property have a way to combat that, and\nthat's putting a fence around it to say, no dogs --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So now we tell --\nMR. GARRE: -- allowed.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- all the drug dealers,\nput up a sign that says \"No dogs.\"\nMR. GARRE: Well, they could, Your Honor.\nThere are certainly houses that have that.\nBut with respect to the question --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Isn't it fair just to\nassume that -- what's logical? I -- I let people knock\non my door because they have to say something to me. I\ndon't let a dog come up to my door -- I don't\nwilly-nilly invite it to come up to my door.\nMR. GARRE: And I think -- Your Honor, I\nthink the reason why that doesn't work here is that if\nyou ask that question with respect to the officer, I\nthink it's well settled or accepted that police officers\ncan walk up the front path, absent a sign or something,\nknock on the door --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That implied consent,\ndoes that include them coming up and -- up to your porch\nand sweeping stuff into a garbage pan?\nMR. GARRE: I don't think it would,\nYour Honor. I think that we're talking about going up\nthere, knocking on the door. The police officer cannot\njust --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Police officers can come\nthere to knock on the door, but I thought you've\nconceded that police officers can't come there to look\ninto the house with binoculars, right?\nMR. GARRE: With binoculars --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: When the purpose of the\nofficer's going there is to -- is to conduct a search,\nit's not permitted.\nMR. GARRE: If the purpose of the police\nofficer here, for example, was to walk up to the house,\nhope that they answered the door, or hope that once they\nwere up there, that they would smell the odor of\nmarijuana, as Officer Pedraja did, that would not\nconvert it into a search. There was no invasion,\nphysical invasion.\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's true, but if you're\nlooking at expectation of a reasonable homeowner,\nimagine you have a home, a long driveway. You do expect\npeople to come up and come into the house, knock on the\ndoor, maybe even with dogs. Do you expect them to sit\nthere for 5 to 15 minutes, 15 minutes, not knocking on\nthe door, doing nothing? I mean --\nMR. GARRE: Well, Your Honor --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- is that something I\nwouldn't -- would you be nervous about that?\nMR. GARRE: -- I think --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Anyone coming to your door\nand not knocking.\nMR. GARRE: I think what -- I think what\nhappened here --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Just sniffing.\nMR. GARRE: Well, I think everyone accepts\nwhen someone comes to your door, they can avail\nthemselves of their God-given senses, whether it's\nlooking into a window without binoculars,\ntaking -- breathing in and smelling the air, as Officer\nPedraja did.\nI don't think there's a constitutional\ndifference when the person has --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, there is in this sense.\nJustice Scalia just said it. He said, you do have an\nexpectation of people coming into your door, perhaps\neven with animals, perhaps even with binoculars, but not\nlooking into the house, not looking into the house from\nthe front step with the binoculars.\nNow, why is that unconstitutional? Because\nit's very unusual that someone would do that, and a\nhomeowner would resent it.\nMR. GARRE: Well, Your Honor --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Would a homeowner resent\nsomeone coming with a large animal sitting in front of\nthe front step on his property and sitting there\nsniffing for 5 to 15 minutes?\nForget the sniffing. Just talking, loud\nnoises. Is that something that you invite people to do?\nMR. GARRE: Your Honor, what I think you can\nsay there is implied consent to is a dog accompanying a\nperson on a leash walking up to the front door, taking a\nsniff in a matter of seconds, not minutes --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Ah. Is that what happened\nhere?\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Well, that's not what the\nrecord says, Mr. Garre.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I thought what happened\nhere was 5 to 15 minutes.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: I mean, the record suggests\nthat he put the dog on a very long leash, the dog goes\nback and forth, tries to figure out where the smell is\ncoming from.\nIt's not just -- you know, my first thought\nwas you go up to the door, the dog barks once, and\nthat's it. But you read the record, this dog is there\nfor some extended period of time, going back and forth\nand back and forth, trying to figure out where the\ngreatest concentration of the smell is.\nIt actually seemed, from my reading of the\nrecord, to be, you know, a lengthy and obtrusive\nprocess.\nMR. GARRE: Your Honor, I think what the\nrecord shows is, is that the dog was on the scene, i.e.,\nat the curb, walking up, going back into the car, and\nthen leaving, for a total of 5 to 10 minutes.\nWalking up to the front steps, sniffing,\nalerting and leaving is a matter of seconds or minutes.\nIt's not -- the dog isn't up there for 5 to 10 minutes.\nIt happens very quickly.\nI think in thinking about reasonable\nexpectations of privacy, it is important to keep in mind\nphysically what's happening in these houses. These\npeople are growing drugs in the houses with the aid of\nelectricity and light and heat. And they need -- they\nneed air conditioning in order to control the heat.\nAnd that air conditioning is blowing a very\nstrong odor of drugs out into the public, and the people\nknow that. They know that. We know they know that\nbecause they use mothballs, which Officer Pedraja found\nhere at the front of the house, outside of the house.\nAnd so what you're talking about, although\nwe talk about what's going on in the home, really what's\nhappening here is odor of illegal contraband is being\nblown out into the street and someone is coming up to it\nand using their God-given senses in a way that humans\nand dogs have used for centuries and detecting that.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, we've had a\nlot of -- we've had a lot of discussion about whether\nit's 5 minutes or 15 minutes or whether it's mothballs.\nI understood the issue before us to be whether or not\nunder the Fourth Amendment it is a search for a dog to\ncome up to the door and sniff, not with respect to --\nwe're not making a judgment, I thought, on the probable\ncause in light of the totality of the circumstances, but\nthe ground of decision below was this is a search when\nthe dog sniffs.\nMR. GARRE: That you need probable cause\njust for the dog to sniff. No, that's absolutely right.\nAnd the dog sniff itself clearly is not a\nphysical invasion in the same way that looking is not a\nphysical invasion under the common law. And the dog, we\nthink --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It isn't just the sniffing\nin the abstract. It's the sniffing at this point, the\nsniffing at a person's front door, right? I mean --\nMR. GARRE: Well, that's true, Your Honor,\nbut I think if it wasn't a search for the police officer\nto walk up there and sniff and report smelling live\nmarijuana, then it wasn't a search when Franky walked up\nthere and alerted to the presence of an illegal\nnarcotic.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I didn't say it\nwouldn't be a search if the police officer himself did\nthat if he went there with the intention of -- of\nsmelling at the door. He's going there to search, and\nhe shouldn't be on the curtilage to search.\nMR. GARRE: I think it's been conceded in\nthis case, at least it was below, that the officer could\nwalk up there, knock on the door, report the smell of\nmarijuana, and that that was not a search.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Garre, this is what we\nsaid in Kyllo. And I'm just going to read it. We said,\n\"We think that obtaining by sense-enhancing technology\nany information regarding the interior of the home that\ncould not otherwise have been obtained without physical\nintrusion into a constitutionally protected area\nconstitutes a search, at least where, as here, the\ntechnology in question is not in general public use.\"\nSo what part of that do you think separates\nyour case from this one? In other words, what part of\nthat language does not apply in this case?\nMR. GARRE: Well, first of all, Franky's\nnose is not technology. It's -- he's using -- he's\navailing himself of God-given senses in the way that\ndogs have helped mankind for centuries.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: So does that mean that if we\ninvented some kind of little machine called a, you know,\nsmell-o-matic and the police officer had this\nsmell-o-matic machine, and it alerted to the exact same\nthings that a dog alerts to, it alerted to a set of\ndrugs, meth and marijuana and whatever else, the police\nofficer could not come to the front door and use that\nmachine?\nMR. GARRE: Your Honor, I think the\ncontraband rationale would be the same. It would be\ndifferent in that you don't have technology in this\ncase.\nAnd I think that's an important distinction\nbecause, as we read Kyllo, the Court was very concerned\nabout advances in technology, and that's just not true\nfor a dog's nose.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: So your basic distinction is\nthe difference between like a machine and Franky.\nMR. GARRE: Well --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: That we should not\nunderstand Franky as kind of a sense-enhancing law\nenforcement technology, but we should think of him as\njust like a guy.\nMR. GARRE: Your Honor, I think that's true\nfor two reasons. One is Franky is using the same sense\nof smell that dogs have used for centuries. So this\nisn't a case where if you allow a dog to sniff today, he\nmight use x-ray vision in the future. That's not going\nto happen.\nAnd the other thing is that Franky -- that\nthe use of dogs for their sense of smell, which everyone\nagrees is extraordinary, mankind has been using them for\nlaw enforcement type purposes for centuries.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Not this -- not this\npurpose. You said centuries, but I think you recognize\nthat it wasn't until the seventies when the dogs were\nused to find culprits. But to use it in this way I\nthink it was only since the seventies.\nMR. GARRE: Well, to use it for drug\ndetection purposes, that's right. But they've -- we've\nbeen using dogs to track thieves for centuries going\nback before the founding. Scotland Yard -- Scotland\nYard used dogs to track Jack the Ripper. That's the\nsame type of way in which they are being used here.\nThe fact is today they're looking for\ndrugs in this context, but --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Garre, there's no\ndispute that dogs can smell what human beings can't; is\nthat correct? It's not that we can find a machine to\nput it on a human being to enhance their sense of\nsmells; dogs can do something human beings can't.\nMR. GARRE: They have a much better sense of\nsmell, that's right. But I think if you look at --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So you have to treat him\nlike a guy, to think that he is not like technology in\nterms of augmenting what a human being can do.\nMR. GARRE: Well --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: He's not augmenting what\na human being can do. He's substituting what a human\nbeing can do.\nMR. GARRE: He's -- the dogs, no doubt, have\nan enhanced sense of smell compared to the officer. But\nI think that's really not functionally different than\nusing an airplane to look into the house, like in\nFlorida v. Reilly. And in that sense, I think this case\nis a lot like that.\nIn Florida v. Reilly, the officers used a\nhelicopter to fly over the drug house, and they saw\nexposed marijuana. Here, you're using the drug\ndetection dog to smell the odor of marijuana that is\nbeing pumped out of the house into the street.\nAnd the people who use the house know that.\nThey know that, and we know they know that because the\nmothballs were present. Mothballs are a masking agent.\nPeople don't have a legitimate expectation\nof privacy, this Court has held, in things that they\nknowingly expose to the public, even in the home.\nThat's what the Court said in Florida v. Reilly. It's\nwhat it said in Katz itself.\nAnd I think, here, one way to resolve it is\nto say people who live in grow houses with a distinct\nodor of marijuana, who know that that is being pumped\nout into the street because of the air conditioning that\nthey need to run the grow houses, there is no invasion\nin their -- in their expectation of privacy when either\na man or a dog, when lawfully present on the property,\nuses their God-given senses to detect that.\nIf I could reserve --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMR. GARRE: Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Ms. Saharsky.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF NICOLE A. SAHARSKY,\nFOR THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,\nSUPPORTING THE PETITIONER\nMS. SAHARSKY: Mr. Chief Justice and may it\nplease the Court:\nI'd like to go right to two points that\nrespond to the Court's questions. The first is the\nquestion of whether the officer and the dog were\nlawfully in place, whether they could approach the front\ndoor, was conceded below. And, as the court -- as the\ncase comes to this Court, that is not an issue before\nthe Court. And I want to make sure that the Court\nhas --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I didn't -- I didn't\nunderstand the concession to be that the police had come\nto the door with the dog, the sole purpose of the dog\nbeing to detect contraband.\nMS. SAHARSKY: Well, let me give the Court\nspecific citations on that. The court of appeals, the\nFlorida Court of Appeals, found that the dog and the\nofficer were lawfully in place. That's JA pages 104,\n105, 112, 116 and 120.\nBefore the Florida Supreme Court at oral\nargument, Respondent conceded that there was no\nreasonable expectation of privacy in the porch, and the\nFlorida Supreme Court accepted that concession. That's\nPetition Appendix page 31, also noted by the dissent in\npages 78 to 79.\nIn the brief in opposition to cert,\nRespondent said that the police could approach the front\ndoor for a knock and talk, and made no separate argument\nabout the dog's presence there making it not lawful.\nSo as this case comes to the Court, it is\nwith the dog and the officer lawfully in place at the\nfront door, approaching the front door just like any\nGirl Scout, trick-or-treater, or anyone else could.\nAnd just to respond, Justice Ginsburg, to\nthe questions that you raised, the police officer's\npurpose in approaching the front door does not mean that\nthe officer can't come to the door. The Court has said\nin many contexts that officer purpose doesn't matter,\nand it doesn't matter if the officer is looking for a\nlost child or thinking that that --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You're agreeing with\nMr. Garre that the police could take a dog and go down\nevery house on the street, every apartment in the\nbuilding?\nMS. SAHARSKY: Well, assuming that the\npolice can lawfully be in the place that they are going\nwith the dog, which is conceded here --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: A house just like this\nhouse?\nMS. SAHARSKY: If they are approaching the\nfront door using the normal path, because the dog only\ndetects contraband, yes, they could be used in those\ncircumstances, but that's not happening.\nThere have been justices who've warned about\nthat --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, so any home, any\nhome anywhere, and we should say that that's okay, and\nwe can say it's okay because the government won't use\nit?\nMS. SAHARSKY: There are justices that have\nwarned about this for over 30 years, and these problems\nhave not come to fruition. There are restraints on\npolice resources. There's the potential for community\nhostility. If you look at the cases that have arose in\nthe courts of appeals --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: This Court has dealt with\nan item that was seized before, a piece of luggage, a\ncar. They have not dealt with the dog sniff in the\ncontext of a home that's not seized.\nMS. SAHARSKY: But in Caballes, where\nadmittedly the Court did not decide this specific issue,\nit distinguished the case of Kyllo as saying that that\nwas finding out about lawful activity in the home, and\nthat a person -- the critical distinction between Kyllo\nand the dog sniff in Caballes is that a person does not\nhave a reasonable expectation of privacy in contraband.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I just -- again, as I told\nMr. Garre, I just can't accept that as the premise for\nthe case. The argument we're having about whether there\nis a reasonable expectation in society generally,\nwhether or not the police because of limited\nresources are not going to have -- that's all fine. But\nthis idea that, oh, well, if there is contraband,\nthen all the -- all the rules go out the window, that's\njust circular, and it won't work for me, anyway.\nMS. SAHARSKY: Well, I wanted to be sure to\nrespond to that, Justice Kennedy, because I would hate\nfor the Court to have the impression that all the rules\ngo out the window. That's not the case.\nWhat we're talking about here is a\nsniff that would allow the police to go to a detached\nand neutral magistrate to say that, we have probable\ncause --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Fine --\nMS. SAHARSKY: -- to get a warrant.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- but don't ask me to\nwrite an opinion and say, oh, we're dealing with\ncontraband here, so we don't need to worry about\nexpectation of privacy. There is simply no support for\nthat because Caballes cited Jacobsen, and Jacobsen was\nwhere the contraband fell out of the package and it was\nin plain view. So that just doesn't work, at least for\nme, in this case.\nMS. SAHARSKY: Well, the reasoning in\ncontraband -- in Jacobsen, though, the Court said that\nthe rationale, the reason for its decision in Place, is\nbecause when you're talking about people's reasonable\nexpectations of privacy, they have both a subjective and\nan objective component.\nSo it's not just that you want to keep\nsomething private; it's that you need to have a\nlegitimate expectation that you can keep that private.\nAnd the Court has said over and over, in Place, in\nCaballes, in Jacobsen, that you do not have a legitimate\nexpectation with respect to contraband.\nThat doesn't mean that the --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Again, I don't think the\ncases go that far because those were cases in which the\ncontraband -- Jacobsen -- was in plain view. Everybody\nknows that it falls out of the package. At that point,\nyou don't have any --\nWhat you're saying is, oh, well, if there is\ncontraband in the house, then you have no legitimate\nexpectation of privacy. That, for me, does not work.\nMS. SAHARSKY: What we're trying to say,\nJustice Kennedy, is not that you lack any privacy\nexpectation in the home. That's why you need to get a\nwarrant before going into the home.\nAll the dog sniff allows is for the police\nto try to go to a magistrate and establish probable\ncause to get a warrant.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: That's fine. We can talk\nabout reasonable suspicion. That's all okay.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: How does what you're saying,\nMs. Saharsky, square with Karo? Because in Karo, the\nonly thing that the beeper alerted to in the home was\nthe can of ether, which was clearly an item that was\nbeing used for drug manufacture. And there was nothing\nelse other than that item, which you might not call it\ncontraband, but it was evidence of illegality, this can\nof ether. There was no thought that it was used for\nanything else. And that was the only thing that the\nbeeper alerted it to; and, yet, nonetheless, we said,\nyou know, of course that's a search.\nMS. SAHARSKY: I think that my answer\ntouches on the point that you made, which is it was not\ncontraband. The police thought that it might be\nevidence of a crime, but the Court did not say it was\ncontraband.\nAnd, actually, there was a discussion at the\noral argument, where defense counsel made very clear\nthat ether has many lawful uses. That makes it\ndifferent from what the Court considered in Place. This\ncame after the Court's decision in Place.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Well, not lawful uses in\nsomebody's house. I mean, maybe lawful uses in a\nfactory or in an operating room, but nobody has cans of\nether in their house unless they're making drugs.\nMS. SAHARSKY: Well, with respect,\nYour Honor, the defense counsel I think correctly\nsuggested in the Karo oral argument that, in fact, there\nare lawful uses in photography labs in houses and the\nlike. He actually had an expert that came to the\nsuppression hearing in that case and testified about the\nvarious lawful uses of ether in a house.\nSo I think, as the argument came to the\nCourt, the government was not making an argument that\nthat was contraband or evidence of a crime. The\ngovernment was just saying, oh, it's very limited\ninformation, because we had already -- we had already\ntracked the ether to the house, so you weren't finding\nout much.\nAnd the Court said basically what it said in\nKyllo, which is, it might not be much, but it's still\nabout lawful information, activity in the house, and\nthat's protected.\nBut in Caballes, the Court came back and\nsaid, sure, we've said Kyllo, lawful activity in the\nhouse, but your interests in protecting contraband are\ndifferent; those are not legitimate interests. And the\nCourt has said that again and again and again.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: But in Kyllo -- and I think\nthis was what Justice Kennedy was saying. In Kyllo,\nthere was already a seizure that had happened, and the\nCourt just said, this is no -- this is really no greater\nan intrusion.\nMS. SAHARSKY: Well, with respect, when we\nlook at the -- when we look at the language in these\ncases, in Caballes and the like, you know, the Court\nwasn't saying, oh, it's not a search because this has\nalready -- this had already been seized and nothing more\nwas happening. The Court said it was not a search\nbecause there is no legitimate expectation of privacy.\nAnd just to be clear, the question about\nwhether folks have a reasonable expectation of privacy\nwith respect to contraband in their house has to take\ninto account two facts: First, that we're only talking\nabout contraband; but, also, that dogs have been\nused and known for centuries for their sense of smell.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes, but I -- what I'm\ncurious about, and it's an unanswered question for me,\nis we are considering whether the dog sniff is\npermissible, so I wanted to know what a dog sniff at the\nfront door involves. And at page 96, 97, 98 of the\njoint appendix, with which you are familiar, it explains\nthat. It isn't just going up and (indicating); that's\nit. It's a process called bracketing.\nThey describe it at length. The officer,\nthe dog officer, said he was in a rush that day and it\ndidn't take more than 5 to 10 minutes. And my question\nreally is whether an ordinary homeowner expects people\nto walk down the curtilage and, with a big animal, and\nthe animal -- they don't knock. They behave in the page\n96, 97, 98 way.\nI subjectively think, well, that's pretty\nunusual behavior, whether it's a policeman or anybody\nelse. So what do you respond?\nMS. SAHARSKY: This sniff occurred very\nquickly, and it --\nJUSTICE BREYER: It was 5 to 10 minutes and\nit's 96-97.\nMS. SAHARSKY: Right. I think the 5 to 10\nminutes, like counsel said, was the whole process of --\nof bringing the dog up to the door, et cetera. The\nsniff happened very quickly. But putting that to the\nside, what the dog is doing is sniffing things that have\nbeen exposed to the public from inside the house, smells\nthat the officer himself could smell, could smell in --\nin plain smell.\nAnd the Court has said in other cases, like\nin Place, that what the dog is doing is very limited in\nscope; it happens very quickly; there is no physical\ninvasion; it's something that actually this Court has\nsaid in Florida v. Royer is something that we want\nofficers to do, because it --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Could I follow up on\nJustice Breyer's question, because it strikes me as a\nlittle confusing. Does the dog, as soon as he or she is\nat the door, sniff and sit or sniff and not sit, or does\nthe dog -- I mean, you've talked about the sniff is\nimmediate. What -- what is the 5 to 10 minutes?\nMS. SAHARSKY: The 5 to 10 minutes as I read\nthe record was the whole process. The -- the dog sniff\nI think took seconds or maybe a minute or 2 minutes --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And the whole\nprocess is -- is what?\nMS. SAHARSKY: That they were -- that they\nmet at the front gate, that they were walking up to\nthe -- to the door, that the dog did the sniff, that\nthe -- that he talked to the other officer, and then he\nwent back to his car, which was parked I think some --\nsome length of time away. So --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It doesn't take the\n5 to 10 minutes to walk to the door. So the officer\nwalks to the door, the dog sniffs right away and then?\nMS. SAHARSKY: Well, the dog sniffs. He has\nto find the strongest source of the odor. So he\nstarts sniffing right away. He sniffs around for a few\nseconds; he finds the strongest source of the odor and\nhe sits down at that place.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Where -- where in\nthe -- where in the record do I find the few seconds\npoint?\nMS. SAHARSKY: Well, I think the -- probably\nthe cites that -- that Justice Breyer gave are the cites\nthat describe it. So I'm not sure that there is\nsomething more specific than that.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMS. SAHARSKY: Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Blumberg.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF HOWARD K. BLUMBERG\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. BLUMBERG: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nPolice officers taking a narcotics detection\ndog up to the front door of a house is a Fourth\nAmendment search for two distinct and separate reasons.\nFirst, when police reveal any details inside\na home which an individual seeks to keep private, that\nis a Fourth Amendment search and that is exactly what a\nnarcotics detection dog is doing, revealing details in\nthe home the individual seeks to keep private.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: That's your first reason\nand I don't want you to be deterred from giving us the\nsecond, but if we can concentrate on that for a minute.\nThat seems to me a proposition that's\nequally unacceptable to what the government is saying,\nthat you have no interest in contraband. The police\noften, when they have ordinary conversation with people,\nwant to find out the details of what that person is\ndoing, where the person lives, what goes on in the\nhouse.\n\"Hello, have you had a nice time at the --\nat the park today? I see you're coming home with your\nchildren; is this where you live?\" This is all routine\nconversation that we always have in order to try to find\nout what people are doing, what they are like, where\nthey live. So I -- I think the statement, and you --\nyou repeated it quite accurately from what you have at\npage 16 of your brief -- just goes too far. Our\ndecisions \"establish that police action which reveals\nany detail an individual seeks to keep private is a\nsearch\" -- that is just a sweeping proposition that in\nmy view, at least, cannot be accepted in this case. I\nthink it's just too sweeping and wrong.\nMR. BLUMBERG: Justice Kennedy, I would add\na few words to the end of that statement: Anything that\nan individual seeks to keep private in the home, and\nthat's the difference. Your hypothet about\nconversation, certainly a police officer can talk to\nsomeone and ask them questions about --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, the police officer\ntalked with somebody at the police station, or walking\ndown the street about what their occupation is, do they\nwork at home. They're -- they are trying to get\ninformation. That's perfectly legitimate.\nMR. BLUMBERG: Certainly, but in that\nhypothet --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, then your broad\nstatement simply does not work.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Suppose you -- you have\nsomeone who, who has been guilty of a crime. He has --\nhe has the body. He has committed a murder and he has\nthe body in the home. He certainly wants to keep that\nprivate, right? And he foolishly and mistakenly leaves\nthe blinds open in the room where -- where the corpse is\nlying, and the policeman at a great distance has a\ntelescope and he looks through the blinds and he sees\nthe corpse. Can the police go into the home?\nMR. BLUMBERG: In that situation, the person\ninside the home has knowingly exposed what is inside the\nhome to the public.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Oh -- he hasn't knowingly.\nHe was careless.\nMR. BLUMBERG: Well, but I -- I understood\nunder your hypothetic that he knowingly left the blinds\nopen.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: He certainly wanted to keep\nit -- he wanted to keep it private.\nMR. BLUMBERG: Well, certainly; and the\ndefendant in Reilly wanted to keep the marijuana\nprivate.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you could say the\nsame thing here. They wanted to keep private the fact\nthat they were growing the marijuana, but they -- they\nused a means of suppressing the heat that made it\nimpossible to keep it private.\nMR. BLUMBERG: Well, that --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: They were careless.\nMR. BLUMBERG: I -- I don't believe there is\nanything in the record to indicate that the air\nconditioner was blowing the smell of marijuana out from\nthe house in a very strong manner. As a matter of\nfact --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: There were the mothballs.\nMR. BLUMBERG: There were mothballs there,\nand Detective Bartelt, the dog handler that was standing\nat the front door as well, testified without\ncontradiction or without hesitation he didn't smell\nanything.\nSo if -- if Mr. Garre's representation about\nan air conditioner basically blowing the smell of\nmarijuana outside the house so that anybody would smell\nit --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What were the\nmothballs there for?\nMR. BLUMBERG: The mothballs presumably were\nthere to -- to mask the smell of an odor coming from the\nhouse.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay, then --\nMR. BLUMBERG: It's manifesting an\nexpectation of privacy.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's my\nquestion. Are we talking about the expectation of\nprivacy in the marijuana or the expectation of privacy\nin the odor?\nMR. BLUMBERG: The expectation of privacy on\nthe -- in the details, what's going on inside your\nhouse.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well -- well, no,\nthat can't be right, because if you're letting smoke out\nthat -- that -- I don't know, from the burning of a body\nor something, you don't say, well, because he's trying\nto conceal that you can't rely on the smoke.\nMR. BLUMBERG: But that's knowingly\nexposing what's inside the house.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So I guess the\nquestion here is, if you appreciate the fact that the\nodor is coming out to the extent that you're going to\nput mothballs all around the house, it seems to me that\nyou -- you may have an expectation of privacy in the\nmarijuana plants, but you don't have an expectation of\nprivacy in the odor, because you're emitting it out, out\ninto the world, and it's the odor that was detected.\nMR. BLUMBERG: But assuming that's what the\nmothballs were there for, that's to keep the odor inside\nthe house, so that the public cannot find -- cannot\ndetect that odor, unless you go up there --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's like saying\nyou put the -- the drugs in a -- in a bag to protect\nthem from observation on the outside, but you use, you\nknow, a clear bag rather than a, you know, opaque one or\nsomething. You didn't -- you weren't very successful.\nAnd -- when you began you said assuming that's what the\nmothballs were there for. That is what they were there\nfor, isn't it? There is no other reason --\nMR. BLUMBERG: There's -- there is really no\nevidence in the record as to -- the only people who\ntestified at the hearing on the motion to suppress were\nthe two police officers.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, I think your first\nreason is -- is so broad, it is clearly incorrect. It's\nso broad, you ought to go on to your second reason.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes, I was going to\nask for your second, your second point.\nMR. BLUMBERG: Well, the -- when a police\nofficer takes a narcotics detection dog up to the front\ndoor of the house, that is also a Fourth Amendment\nsearch because that is a physical trespass upon the\nconstitutionally protected area of the curtilage of the\nhome.\nJUSTICE ALITO: You know, we've had hundreds\nof years of trespass cases in this country and in\nEngland. Has there -- do you have a single case\nholding that it is a trespass for a person with a dog to\nwalk up to the front door of a house?\nMR. BLUMBERG: Well, there are cases that go\nback to the -- I'm sorry, I don't have the, the\ncitations -- but there are cases in the 1700s that\nestablished that basically a dog running on to someone\nelse's property is a trespass.\nJUSTICE ALITO: That really wasn't my\nquestion, was it?\nMR. BLUMBERG: I thought your question\nwas if a dog comes on to private property --\nJUSTICE ALITO: If a dog on a leash is\nbrought up to the front door of a person's house, was\nthat a trespass at the time when the Fourth Amendment\nwas adopted?\nMR. BLUMBERG: If it was without the consent\nof the homeowner, yes, it was a trespass.\nJUSTICE ALITO: What is the case that says\nthat?\nMR. BLUMBERG: I do not have the case.\nJUSTICE ALITO: You don't have the case.\nJUSTICE BREYER: You're assuming the\nconclusion in these things. I mean, I thought since\nKatz the rule has been whether the homeowner has a\nreasonable expectation of privacy in -- which is\ninfringed or violated or interfered with when the\ngovernment acts. So it's a question of does he have\nthat reasonable expectation. So now we're back to\nexactly where we were. Your opponents say, no, there is\nno reasonable expectation of privacy --\nMR. BLUMBERG: Well --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- to protect a person with\na dog coming up to the door and going (indicating), all\nright? Now, your response to that is what?\nMR. BLUMBERG: My response to that is that\ndoes violate the resident's reasonable expectation of\nprivacy.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And then the question was,\nas Justice Alito put it, why? He says, we go back to\nthe 17th century, as far as you want, and there is no\nlaw that says there is any kind of expectation in a\nhomeowner that a person won't walk up to the dog -- to\nthe door with a dog on a leash and sniff, which, as he\nsays -- which your opponents say is what happened here.\nAnd your response to that is?\nMR. BLUMBERG: My response to that is that\nany entry onto private property in the 1700's was a\ntrespass, was the tort of trespass, unless it was with\nconsent.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What about, Mr. Blumberg,\nthe government cited many, many pages in the record, I\njust took the first one, petition -- appendix to the\npetition, 104 and 105. The court said, the officer and\nthe dog were lawfully present at the defendant's front\ndoor, and we were told that that was conceded by you a\nnumber of times.\nMR. BLUMBERG: Absolutely not,\nJustice Ginsburg. What I -- what I said in the Florida\nSupreme Court, I was given a hypothet about an officer\ncoming up by himself without the dog to knock on the\nfront door and talk to the homeowner. And I said that I\nconceded that would not be a violation of a reasonable\nexpectation of privacy, and this Court has stated as\nmuch in Kentucky v. King.\nAnd then the Court said to me, what's the\ndifference? And I said the dog. And that's exactly\nwhat I'm saying here.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Okay. So that's\nclearly -- you do concede if the police officer walks up\nto the door, smells it himself, no problem there; is\nthat right?\nMR. BLUMBERG: If the police officer is\nperform -- is knocking on the door, part of a knock and\ntalk, yes; but, if the police --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: But smells it himself, so\nthere's no problem there.\nSo the difference is the dog. So what\ndifference does the dog make?\nSuppose the dog were not doing this\nten-minute bracketing that Justice Breyer was talking\nabout. Suppose this really were a very simple\nprocedure. The dog comes up, takes a sniff, barks, sits\ndown. And, you know, to make it even more, the dog is\nnot a scary-looking dog, the dog is a Cockapoo.\nSo just like, you know, your neighbor with\nhis Cockapoo walks up to your door all the time, that's\nwhat this police officer has done. Why do you win then?\nMR. BLUMBERG: Well, whether it's a Cockapoo\nor Franky, who, from all the pictures, appears to be a\nvery cute dog, it's not what the dog looks like, it's\nwhat the dog is doing on the front porch, which is --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: The dog does what your\nneighbor's dog does.\nMR. BLUMBERG: Well, no, this dog -- the\nneighbor's dog does not search for evidence on your\nfront porch. That's the key distinction.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But, Mr. Blumberg, I think\nyou're, with respect, misguided to concede that if it\nwas just the officer alone without the dog, it would be\nperfectly okay.\nMR. BLUMBERG: I did not mean to concede\nthat, and I was going to say that.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I thought you did.\nMR. BLUMBERG: I was about to return to\nyour --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And I would assume you\nwould say that if the officer walks up there with no\nintention to knock and talk, but just walks up to the\ndoor with the intention of sniffing at the door, you\nwould consider that to be a violation, wouldn't you?\nMR. BLUMBERG: And that was the point I was\ngoing to make in response to Justice Kagan's question.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, our\nFourth Amendment cases are very clear that they don't\nturn on the subjective intent of the particular officer.\nMR. BLUMBERG: And I am not arguing that. I\nam arguing --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I thought you just\nsaid it depends on whether or not he's going up to the\ndoor to sniff or going up for something else.\nMR. BLUMBERG: It depends what the officer\ndoes at the front door, not what his state of mind is.\nIf the officer goes up to the front door and\nstarts sniffing around the cracks and crevices --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes, sure, if he's\ndown on his knees; but, what if he goes up to the front\ndoor and sniffs? I mean, he's --\nMR. BLUMBERG: That's --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- he's got to\nbreathe. I mean, how do you tell whether it's\ndifferent?\nI don't understand. He's going up to drop\noff, you know, tickets to the Policeman's Ball, and he\nsmells marijuana. What is that? Is that a violation or\nnot?\nMR. BLUMBERG: It is not because he is not\nperforming any type of search.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So it depends\non -- but if he's going up to sniff, it is a violation?\nMR. BLUMBERG: Not going up to sniff. If he\ngoes up there and does sniff --\nJUSTICE ALITO: What if he goes to --\nMR. BLUMBERG: -- and starts searching\naround, looking in the windows --\nJUSTICE ALITO: -- he goes to deliver the\ntickets, and he sniffs? He doesn't intend to sniff\nbefore he goes, but he goes the deliver the tickets, and\nhe smells the marijuana. Is that a search?\nMR. BLUMBERG: No, because he's not\nperforming any kind of search. And this Court has\nrepeatedly held that an officer --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, he doing exactly the\nsame thing. Two officers go up to two identical houses.\nOne goes up with the subjective intent to sniff. The\nother one goes up with the subjective intent to drop off\nthe tickets to the Policeman's Ball. Your answer is one\nis a search, one is not a search.\nMR. BLUMBERG: No, and I am not in any way,\nshape or form tying it to the subjective intent of the\nofficer.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: All right. Again, I think\nyou're wrong not to accept that. I think our cases\nsupport it. I think you cannot enter the protected\nportion of a home, which is called the curtilage, with\nthe intention of conducting a search, that that is not\npermitted. I think our cases establish that.\nMR. BLUMBERG: I believe the language --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And it's fine to say -- I\ndon't think it's true that the intent of the officer is\nnever relevant. It is relevant in that context.\nThe reason for the officer going onto\nprotected property, if he's going on just to knock on\nthe door to sell tickets to the Policeman's Ball, that's\nfine. If he's going on to conduct a search, that's\nsomething else.\nMR. BLUMBERG: The language in this Court's\nopinion in Jones is for the purpose of conducting a\nsearch.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Can odors be in --\nin the equivalent of plain sight, plain smell? In other\nwords, the officer goes up to drop off the Policeman's\nBall tickets, the door is open, he sees the dead body.\nThe officer goes up to sell the Policeman's Ball\ntickets, and he sees -- he smells the marijuana. Okay\nin both cases, right?\nMR. BLUMBERG: Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So this depends upon\nhow strong the odor is.\nMR. BLUMBERG: This Court's decisions\nestablish that a police officer does not have to close\nhis eyes when he goes up to the front door of a house to\ndo a knock and talk. He does not have to hold his nose\nto prevent. Anything that he naturally observes using\nhis ordinary senses when he is there for a lawful\npurpose such as a knock and talk is fine.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If the -- let's say\nit's a townhouse that goes right up to the sidewalk. If\nthe police go by with their dog intending to sniff, and\nthe dog alerts, on the sidewalk but two feet away is the\nfront door, that's okay, right?\nMR. BLUMBERG: Well, that would not be a\ntrespass. That would not be a search because a\ntrespass --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So it's okay?\nMR. BLUMBERG: No, it's not okay,\nrespectfully, because the dog would still be revealing\ndetails inside the home that the officer could not\nreveal using his or her ordinary senses. That's our\nfirst argument in this case.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, let me make\nsure I understand you. The policeman is walking down\nthe sidewalk with his dog, the dog stops and alerts.\nThat doesn't constitute sufficient probable cause to get\na search warrant to go into the townhouse. There's been\nno entry onto the property, just a policeman walking\nwith his dog.\nMR. BLUMBERG: Well, but I assume on your\nhypothet it's a policeman walking with his narcotics\ndetection dog up and down the street.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Sure.\nMR. BLUMBERG: A dog that he knows is\ntrained --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: He's walking the\ndog. He's not out searching. He's walking the K-9 dog,\nand the dog alerts on a house without any trespass. You\nthink that's still bad?\nMR. BLUMBERG: Yes. And I would submit that\nwould basically be the same thing as a police officer\nwalking up and down the street with a thermal imager\nthat's turned on.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But you do say that this is\nan easier case.\nMR. BLUMBERG: This is an easier case, of\ncourse, because the police officer in this case -- and\nnot only the facts of this case, but the question\npresented is going up to the front door of a home.\nJUSTICE ALITO: I thought the relevance of\ntechnology was that the technology that we have now was\nnot necessarily -- was not -- much of it was not\navailable at the time when the Fourth Amendment was\nadopted, so we can't tell what the -- what people in\n1791 would have thought about it.\nBut that's not true of dogs. Dogs were\naround. They have been around for 10,000 years.\nMR. BLUMBERG: Dogs were around,\nJustice Alito --\nJUSTICE ALITO: -- and they've been\nused -- and they've been used to detect scents for\n10,000 -- for thousands of years. Certainly, they were\navailable for that purpose in 1791, weren't they?\nMR. BLUMBERG: But in 1791, dogs had not\nbeen trained to detect criminal activity within a\nhouse -- not -- I'm sorry --\nJUSTICE ALITO: But they had been trained to\ntrack people, had they not?\nMR. BLUMBERG: Yes. Dogs have been tracking\npeople --\nJUSTICE ALITO: So in 1791, if someone -- if\nthe police were using -- or somebody was using a\nbloodhound to track -- someone who was suspected of a\ncrime, and the bloodhound -- and they used the\nbloodhound to track the person to the front of -- to the\nfront door of a house, would that have been regarded as\na trespass?\nMR. BLUMBERG: Yes, I believe it still would\nhave.\nJUSTICE ALITO: And what's the case that\nsays that?\nMR. BLUMBERG: Well, the -- I do not have a\ncase that says that taking a bloodhound up to the front\ndoor of a house would be a trespass. But if you analyze\nit under the definition of what a trespass is, it's an\nunlawful entry onto private property without consent of\nthe homeowner. And there is no --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Without implied consent.\nMR. BLUMBERG: Right.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Actual or implied consent.\nMR. BLUMBERG: I don't believe a homeowner,\nback in the 1700's, impliedly consented to police coming\nup to the front door of his house with a bloodhound,\neven though everybody knew they could do that.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, are there cases that\nsay that the implied consent exists only where the\nperson is coming to the door for a purpose that the\nhomeowner would approve, if the homeowner knew the\npurpose of the person coming to the door?\nMR. BLUMBERG: The specific doctrine is\nimplied consent by custom. And so you look to what is\nit customary for people to accept in terms of people\ncoming onto their property.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: How is that different from\nwhat Justice Breyer I think correctly indicated, our\ninquiry as to whether there is a reasonable expectation\nof privacy? In a way, that's circular because if we say\nthere is, then there is, if we say there isn't, then\nthere isn't.\nBut if we're looking at community values in\ngeneral, isn't it a reasonable expectation of privacy?\nMR. BLUMBERG: It's very similar. The two\ndoctrines are very similar. Whether you're saying it's\na violation of a reasonable expectation of privacy, as\nJustice Breyer --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Let me ask this. I think\nI know what your answer would be. Suppose the policemen\nhave little microphones on so they can talk into their\nradio, the microphone on their lapel. Suppose the\npoliceman goes to the homeowner and he has the\nmicrophone in his lapel on so his partner can hear the\nconversation, and they can -- the two of them talk about\nit later. They're talking to the homeowner. Is that an\nunlawful search?\nMR. BLUMBERG: If the homeowner chooses to\nengage in conversation with that officer and his\nconversation is overheard on the microphone --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: It doesn't occur to him\nthat that mike is on.\nMR. BLUMBERG: But, again, when you talk to\nthe police officer, that's a reasonable possibility.\nYou don't have -- that's not a reasonable expectation of\nprivacy, that if you talk to a police officer, that that\nmight be going out to another police officer that's in\nthe car down the street. But there's no -- a\nhomeowner does not --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But -- but maybe it is a\nreasonable expectation, maybe it isn't. I frankly think\nthat might be harder than the dog case or that you can\nmake a stronger case for a reasonable expectation of\nprivacy. If the -- if the homeowner is making a lot of\nmarijuana with -- with odors coming out, he knows that a\ndog or a person might smell it.\nMR. BLUMBERG: But, again, this particular\ncase is not -- the question presented does not hinge on\nwhether or not a normal officer could smell it, because\nthis officer, Detective -- I'm sorry -- Detective\nBartelt said he did not smell it.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: It does hinge on what is a\nreasonable expectation of privacy.\nMR. BLUMBERG: It does.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And that's what we're\ntrying to find out.\nMR. BLUMBERG: It does.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I'll look at this later,\nbut I'm rather surprised. My understanding of the case\nlaw was the Chief Justice's, and I thought what you're\nsupposed to look at is the behavior of the individual,\nthe police officer, who comes to the door or looks into\nthe house, not his subjective motive.\nNow, as we just heard, you said, and with\nsupport here, that Jones changed that, but I don't know\nwhat in Jones changed that. Jones was the case where\nthe police did in fact go to a person's car and\nphysically put something in it. That's -- something\nthat tracked. That's behavior.\nMR. BLUMBERG: Correct. But the\ndefinition --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So what is it in Jones that\nsaid what we're supposed to look at is not behavior, but\nthe subjective intent of the officer?\nMR. BLUMBERG: It's the language in Jones\nthat says one of the elements in determining whether or\nnot a physical trespass constitutes a search under the\nFourth Amendment is, is there a physical trespass, onto\na constitutionally protected area, for the purpose of\nconducting a search. Those are the three elements of\nthe --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What is the\nconstitutionally protected area in this case?\nMR. BLUMBERG: In this case, the curtilage\nof the home.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Even though it's the\nsidewalk where people -- there's an implied license for\npeople to walk up to --\nMR. BLUMBERG: Well, that was your --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I mean, it may be a search.\nI see that.\nMR. BLUMBERG: It's not a sidewalk here.\nIt's the front door.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's not the sidewalk here,\nis it? It's the front part.\nMR. BLUMBERG: No, no, it's the front door\nof the home here.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But there is an\nimplied license to walk up to the front door, right?\nMR. BLUMBERG: Only -- only to do certain\nthings.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: There's -- there's an\nimplied license to -- to go on to the curtilage for most\npeople.\nMR. BLUMBERG: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The curtilage is -- is not\nsacrosanct.\nMR. BLUMBERG: To do certain things such as\nto try to and sell Girl Scout cookies, to knock -- even\na police officer can go on to the curtilage, to knock on\nto the door -- I'm sorry -- to knock on the front door,\nto try and engage the person inside the home in a\nconversation.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could we go back to the\nconcession that was asked of you, what you conceded in\nthe Florida court or didn't? Have you conceded that the\npolice officer sans dog, if he had come up to the door\nand knocked, that that would have been permissible, that\nthat was not a search or seizure?\nMR. BLUMBERG: If what the police officer\nwas doing at the front door was a knock and talk. That\nwas the law --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Did he have -- did he\nhave a right under the facts of this case? He had been\ntold that in this house they were growing marijuana by a\nconfidential informant. Assume that's all that he had.\nWould he have had a right to walk up to the door, knock\non it, and start asking questions?\nMR. BLUMBERG: Without the dog.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Let's -- sans dog, yes.\nMR. BLUMBERG: Yes, yes. That's Kentucky v.\nKing, I believe.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. So you are\nconceding that he had license to walk onto -- or walk to\nthe door and ask questions.\nMR. BLUMBERG: A police -- there's implied\nconsent for a police officer to go up to the front door,\nknock on the door and attempt to engage the person in\nthe house in conversation if they open the door.\nJUSTICE ALITO: So why is that? Why is\nthat? If you took a poll of people and said do you\nwant -- do you want police officers who suspect you of\npossibly engaging in criminal conduct to come to your\nfront door and knock on the door so they can talk to you\nand attempt to get incriminating information out of you,\nwould most people say, yes, I consent to that?\nMR. BLUMBERG: In terms of consent? Again,\nit's implied consent by custom. And I think at this\npoint it's customary for people to expect that police\nofficers may come to your front door and knock on your\nfront door to try and talk to you. You don't have to\ntalk to them.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I guess the bottom line\nis that are you taking -- it sounds to me like you're\nsaying there's no implied consent to bring a dog on to\nmy property.\nMR. BLUMBERG: Absolutely. Absolutely. And\ncertainly not a narcotics detection dog.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You're -- Mr. Garre said\ndifferently, that there is an implied consent for your\nneighbor to bring the dog up for anyone else but a\npolice officer. Is that what you're saying? There's an\nimplied consent for anyone else or there is no implied\nconsent, period?\nMR. BLUMBERG: I think a strong argument can\nbe made that there is no implied consent for anyone to\nbring a dog up to the front door of your house, because,\nas you pointed out, a lot of people don't like -- don't\nlike dogs and -- and some people are allergic to dogs.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought you were\ntalking about a dog trained to detect contraband --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- not just any old dog.\nMR. BLUMBERG: We are, but I believe the\nhypothet was just any dog. But certainly, when it's --\nwhen it's a dog trained to detect contraband, there's no\nquestion that no one impliedly consents to that\nhappening and there's no question, as Justice Breyer\npointed out, that a homeowner has a reasonable\nexpectation of privacy that that's not going to happen.\nJUSTICE ALITO: You draw a distinction\nbetween dogs that are not drug detection dogs and\nordinary dogs. Would you draw the same distinction\nbetween a police officer who is not expert at detecting\nthe smell of methamphetamine and a police officer who is\nexpert at detecting the smell of that drug?\nMR. BLUMBERG: In terms of the right of that\nofficer to come up to the house and knock on the front\ndoor?\nJUSTICE ALITO: To knock on the front door,\nyes.\nMR. BLUMBERG: No, there -- there wouldn't\nbe any distinction to that. You impliedly consent and\nyou have no reasonable expectation of privacy that any\ntype of police officer is going to come and knock on\nyour front door and try and talk to you.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Not a police officer. If\nwe start -- policemen have to know how to behave. And\nin this area, they can behave the same way as other\npeople can behave, and we expect them to behave, even\nthough their motive differs. They're always trying to\nfind crime. That's what I thought the law was.\nI've been trying to figure out just what you\nsay, but in a slightly different form. Do people come\nup to the door with dogs? Yes. Do the dogs breathe?\nYes.\nDo in fact policemen, like other people,\ncome up and breathe? Yes. Do we expect it? Yes, we\nexpect people to come up and breathe. But do we expect\nthem to do what happened here? And at that point, I get\ninto the question: What happened here? And I'd be\ninterested in your view on that.\nMR. BLUMBERG: And -- and just to clear up\nthe factual, I don't believe that -- that what happened\nhere in terms of the use of the drug detection dog took\n5 to 15 minutes. It didn't take 5 to 15 minutes. It\ncertainly took, I would say, at least 1 or 2 minutes,\nbecause what happened -- and again, this is on 96, 97\nand 98 -- the officer goes from the street over the\ncurb, up to the front door of the house, with the dog\nbasically dragging him up to the front door of the\nhouse.\nThey go up this walkway -- and a picture of\nthe home is -- is in the appendix to the brief -- and\nthen the dog crosses the -- into the alcove, the area\nright in front of the house. And once he gets in that\narea, the dog starts violently bracketing back and\nforth, pulling on the leash. The dog handler testified\nthat the other officer had to stay back, because it was\nso violent that people could get knocked down by what's\nhappening.\nAnd for a period of time the dog goes back\nand forth, back and forth, and then at some point goes\nto the crack on the bottom of the front door, sniffs\nthat, and then the process finally stops, he sits down.\nSo that's factually what happened.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Blumberg, the\nFlorida appellate court, yes, the court of appeals, did\nsay that that the officer and the dog were lawfully\npresent. But you say you didn't make that concession.\nMR. BLUMBERG: Well, that's -- I did not\nmake that concession and -- no, I certainly did not\nconcede that, but the court found that. And that's the\npoint I wanted to make. The courts, both courts in\nFlorida, squarely addressed that issue, Justice\nGinsburg. There is a whole section in the opinion in\nthe Third District Court of Appeals saying the officer\nand the dog were lawfully present. They didn't -- that\nsection doesn't go, defense counsel concedes that issue.\nThat -- that issue -- that part of the opinion goes: We\nfind that the officer and the dog were lawfully present.\nSo it's squarely before this Court.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, don't we have to\naccept that? Don't we have to accept that as a\nstatement of Florida law?\nMR. BLUMBERG: I'm sorry. I didn't hear the\nbeginning of your --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Do we not have to accept\nthat as a statement of Florida law?\nMR. BLUMBERG: No.\nJUSTICE ALITO: No?\nMR. BLUMBERG: The issue is whether or not\nthat's a violation of the Fourth Amendment. And -- and\njust because the Third District Court of Appeal found --\nthat's -- that's what's before the Court today. That's\nwhy the issue is squarely before the Court.\nThe Third District Court of Appeal decided\nthe officer had the right to go up and be there on the\nfront porch with the dog. The Florida Supreme Court\ndisagreed. There is a passage in the decision of the\nFlorida Supreme Court that says an officer going up to\nthe door -- can go up to the door and do a knock and\ntalk, but when the officer goes up with a narcotics\ndetection dog, that is a qualitatively different matter.\nSo that issue is --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Maybe this is the\nsame question Justice Alito asked earlier, but people\nhave different senses of smell. So what if there is\nsome person who has, you know, the best sense of smell\nin the department, and they say, well, let's use him to\ngo do the knock and talks when we suspect drugs; that\nway, he may discover the odor of marijuana when other\npeople wouldn't. Is it -- is it -- is it wrong for them\nto select the person with the best sense of smell to do\nthat?\nMR. BLUMBERG: I think that would lead more\nto a determination that there was a trespass because\nthey selected the officer who had the best sense of\nsmell to go up to that door. So they weren't\nreally going up there to do a knock --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: To do a knock and\ntalk. You said knock and talks are okay.\nMR. BLUMBERG: Well, but there's -- knock\nand talks are okay; but, under your hypothet, it appears\nthat the knock and talk was -- was not really what the\nofficer was going up there for. They picked the officer\nwith the best sense of --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You're on a really\nslippery slope with that answer. There's dual motives\nin everything police officers do.\nMR. BLUMBERG: Right.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: They knock to hope the\nperson comes to the door and that they can see something\nfrom the door. They knock -- they always have a dual\nmotive. So you're suggesting what?\nMR. BLUMBERG: No.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: In terms of our rule --\nMR. BLUMBERG: I don't --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: -- that if they select\nsomebody with a sense of smell because they have gotten\na tip of drugs in a house, that we give up, in that\nsituation, the assumption that they went to investigate?\nMR. BLUMBERG: No. But the rule I'm asking\nthis Court to adopt does not rely on the subjective\nintent of the police officer. The rule I'm asking this\nCourt to adopt --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: He knocks, and he says\nto the neighbor, who are you? I've gotten a report, and\nI'm smelling drugs, so I know you have drugs in there.\nMR. BLUMBERG: That -- that would be fine.\nThat would be -- that would be plain smell in that. But\nif --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But if he smells first\nand asks the question second, that's not okay?\nMR. BLUMBERG: No, no. What's not okay is\nif he goes up there to perform a search, or if he\nconducts a search -- and, again, back to the facts of\nthis case, when a police officer goes up to the front\ndoor with a narcotics detection dog, there is no\nquestion what that officer is doing. That officer is\nperforming a search. And, therefore, if you go to\nJones, the officer and the dog have entered -- have\nphysically trespassed, because there is no consent to do\nthat, onto a constitutionally protected area, the\ncurtilage of the home, and performed a search.\nIf you just -- you follow the test set forth\nin Jones and apply it to what happened here and the\nquestion presented here, it is a trespass.\nJUSTICE ALITO: I thought the reason -- I\nthought the rationale in Jones, what Jones added, was\nthat it is a search if it was a trespass.\nMR. BLUMBERG: Yes.\nJUSTICE ALITO: And so I come back to the\nvery first question I asked you, do you have any\nauthority for the proposition that this would be a\ntrespass? Any case that says this is -- any trespass\ncase in the last five hundred years in any\nEnglish-speaking country?\nMR. BLUMBERG: I don't believe any court has\nfaced this issue as to whether or not taking a police\ndog up to the front door of a house is a trespass under\nthe common law.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMR. BLUMBERG: Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Garre, you have\nthree minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY G. GARRE\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. GARRE: Thank you, Your Honor.\nFirst, with the question of how long they\nwere at the scene, the record says that they were at the\nscene for five to ten minutes. That's -- that includes\nin the car; walking up to the door, which my friend\nconceded was a minute or two; and, then back in the car\nand leaving.\nWith respect to the bracketing, bracketing\njust means that the dog is getting excited, moving his\nhead around. This is a passive alert dog. They get a\nlittle bit excited and then sit down. It's no different\nthan what a neighbor's dog would do when they get to the\nfront door.\nSecond, with respect to state law, we do\nthink it's important. And Florida has a decision, State\nv. --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I thought what the dog\ndoes, according to the police officer's testimony, is he\ngave him a long leash so the dog would lead him to the\ndrugs. And what the dog did, I thought, according to\nwhat I read, was go past the motorcycle to make sure --\nI mean, the officer said this -- you don't know if the\ndrugs are in the motorcycle, you don't know if they're\nin the garage, you don't know where they might be. So\nthe dog is permitted to roam around until he catches the\nscent. Is that accurate?\nMR. GARRE: Yes. They're walking up the\ncommon path, and you can see it from the picture at\nthe -- appended to the brief, and then up to the front\ndoor. It's near the front door where he alerted by\nsitting down.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But the point is that\nhe's sniffing all the way around to see --\nMR. GARRE: He's sniffing; he's breathing.\nThat's right.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Yes.\nMR. GARRE: With respect to state law,\nState v. Morsman, 394 So.2d 408 at 409, this was a case\nthat came up during oral argument in the Supreme Court.\nIt says that, under Florida law, there is no reasonable\nexpectation of privacy in a porch, taking into account\nthat visitors and salesmen can come up to the front\ndoor. And I think that that's pertinent here.\nJustice Kennedy, if you don't like the\ncontraband rationale, then I hope you would consider the\nknowingly exposed to the public rationale.\nHere, the record does show that they -- drug\nhouses do vent the stuff outside. It's page A-48 of the\njoint appendix. That's in the warrant, where they talk\nabout what the air conditioning unit does to the scent\nof marijuana in the house.\nWe know that they knew about that because\nOfficer Bartelt came across the moth balls -- that's on\npage 100 of the joint appendix -- outside of the house.\nThe mothballs were outside of the house, which means --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: But I think, Mr. Garre, that\nthe --\nMR. GARRE: -- which means that they knew\nthat the odors were outside the house.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: I think, Mr. Garre, that you\nhave to concede that this is a case about police use --\ncall it a technology, call it whatever you want to call\nit -- of something that enhances what normal people can\nsense. And then the question becomes, do you have a\nreasonable expectation of privacy in, basically, people\njust having their normal senses, rather than some\ntechnique or method or technology that enhances those\nsenses?\nSo that your implied consent or expectations\nabout your neighbor might differ fundamentally, you\nknow, if the neighbor comes and knocks on your door, or\nif the neighbor brings his magnifying glass and his\nmicroscope and everything else and starts testing\neverything around it.\nYou might say, no, that's -- I'm -- I'm not\nthere for that.\nMR. GARRE: Well, and I think that gets back\nto our point that this is a dog that's been used by\nhumans for centuries by scent. And in that respect,\nit's quite different than the helicopter that was used\nfor aerial surveillance in Florida v. Reilly.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMR. GARRE: Thank you, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel.\n"
