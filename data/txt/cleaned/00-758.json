GARRE\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. GARRE: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and\nmay it please the Court:\nFor decades Federal employers and the Merit\nSystems Protection Board have engaged in the common sense\npractice of considering an employee's prior disciplinary\nrecord in deciding what punishment is appropriate for\nsubsequent misconduct. The settled practice has long been\nto do so, even when a prior disciplinary action is subject\nto a pending labor grievance, although in that context,\nthe board permits the employee to collaterally attack the\nprior actions in proceedings before it.\nIn this case, the Federal circuit --\nQUESTION: If there is a collateral attack, the\nemployee says, look, I filed a grievance and it's pending,\nwhat then is the burden of proof by the Government\nemployer?\nMR. GARRE: The Government employer bears the\nburden of proving the action by a preponderance of the\nevidence. That's the standard that's set out in the\nstatute. Now, that -- that burden of proof -- the\nevidentiary focus of the hearing is on whether the\nGovernment has proved the charges resulting in the adverse\naction. Here those charges --\nQUESTION: But what -- what is it with regard to\nthe prior offenses, if you will, that have -- for which\ngrievance procedures have been filed? How is that then\naddressed?\nMR. GARRE: Under the longstanding framework,\nwhich is established by the board's Bolling decision, the\nemployer has to prove the fact of the prior action, and he\nhas to -- and the employer has to prove that it was\npreceded by certain procedural protections: first, that\nthe employee received advance notice of the action;\nsecond, that the employee had an opportunity to respond to\nthe charges before the supervisor, as well as by a higher\nauthority within the agency; and third, that there was a\nrecord --\nQUESTION: Does that just mean somebody higher\nup the ladder in the employing agency?\nMR. GARRE: It does, and that's -- and that's\nthe same type of challenge that is framed in the early\nstages of the grievance process. It's an independent\nauthority than the supervisor.\nIn this case, the notice of removal was -- the\nproposed notice was made by the respondent's supervisor,\nbut the -- the actual notice of decision was entered by a\nlabor relations specialist who -- who was in a different\ndistrict, independent from the supervisor.\nQUESTION: Well, what if the final action, the\ndecision to terminate the services of the employee -- what\nif it had been based on the commission of some prior\nfailure as an employee and the grievance procedure had\nproceeded and it had been determined that it was invalid?\nMR. GARRE: In that circumstance, the board has\nheld that it would be inappropriate to rely on that action\nto defend the subsequent action. However, until or unless\na prior action is proved to be unreliable, there's no\nbasis for the Federal circuit's rule which presumes that\nprior disciplinary actions are unreliable and effectively\npresumes that employers act in faith when they take\nimportant disciplinary actions --\nQUESTION: What happens --\nQUESTION: There was, in fact, here three\npreceding incidents, as I recall, and a grievance was\nfiled on all of them. As to one, it had already been\ndetermined that the grievance -- that the disciplinary\naction was improper.\nMR. GARRE: That's correct. And -- and that can\nhappen, but it doesn't undermine the legitimacy of prior\nactions that have not been overturned.\nAnd in addition, the board has a reopening\nmechanism which permits employees to bring to the\nattention of the board any new evidence, including any\nevidence that a prior disciplinary action has been set\naside.\nThe grievance is not a step in the decision\nmaking of the prior disciplinary action.\nQUESTION: What about Justice O'Connor's\nexample? And let me add one thing, that the prior\ndisciplinary actions are being grieved. Now, in this\ncase, the later event leads the board to fire the person\nin light of the prior disciplinary matters. Then after\nthe person is fired, the board attorney goes to the\ngrievance person, the arbitrator, and says, there's no\nneed to continue this because the person doesn't work for\nus anymore. Now, what's supposed to happen in that\nsituation?\nMR. GARRE: Well, first of all, there's --\ngrievances can be pressed before, during, and after\nappeals before the Merit Systems Protection Board. The\nMerit Systems Protection Board, after all, has come up\nwith a practice which allows it to decide appeals before\nit, and it chooses to consider the prior disciplinary\nactions, whether or not they're -- they're subject to a\npending grievance.\nIf a grievance does proceed and it proves\nsuccessful, then the board has a procedure by which it can\nreopen an appeal and reconsider the appeal --\nQUESTION: What's the answer to my question? My\nquestion was -- should I repeat it or you have it?\nMR. GARRE: My understanding is that even when a\ngrievance is proceeding, the board would -- would proceed\nwith the processing of its appeal.\nQUESTION: My question is take the present\nsituation. Let's call it bad thing A. All right? Now,\nthey're going to fire the person because of bad thing A\nbecause there are previous disciplinary things, X, Y, and\nZ. X, Y, and Z are all in the process of being grieved.\nNow, they fire the person because of A, and then they go\nto the arbitrator who's doing X, Y, and Z, and the board\nsays, arbitrator, stop everything, cancel the proceeding,\ndon't continue because she doesn't work for us anymore. I\nwant to know how -- how we deal -- how you deal, how the\n-- how someone deals with that situation.\nMR. GARRE: I'm sorry. I misunderstood your\nquestion.\nThe board doesn't have the authority to go to an\narbitrator and tell the arbitrator to stop the proceeding.\nWhat sometimes happens is the union chooses to withdraw\ngrievances when an employee -- employee's removal has been\naffirmed by the board. That's a decision that the Civil\nService Reform Act and the collective bargaining agreement\nleave to the prerogative of the union. The union's\ndecision to withdraw a grievance, after an employee has\nbeen removed, provides no more basis for --\nQUESTION: So, your answer is, to my\nhypothetical, it can't happen.\nMR. GARRE: The board can't go to an arbitrator\nand tell him to stop.\nQUESTION: Well, can the -- what about the\nemployer? Can the postal department say, well, you know,\nshe's not an employee here anyway, you don't need to\ncontinue this? Or is it -- you -- you leave me with the\nimpression, rightly or wrongly, that this -- that this is\njust at the option of the union.\nMR. GARRE: It's --\nQUESTION: The union can proceed if it wants or\ndoesn't have to proceed.\nMR. GARRE: That's a matter covered by the\ncollective bargaining arrangement. The Civil Service\nReform Act provides for the creation of a negotiated\ngrievance procedure. The union and the employer have\nreached a memorandum of understanding, under which once,\nin this case, in the -- in the collective bargaining\narrangement in this case governing Postal Service\nemployees, once an employee is removed for disciplinary\nreasons, the union typically withdraws the grievances.\nWhen the employee is not removed for disciplinary reasons,\nthe union chooses to press the grievances. Those are\nmatters covered by the collective bargaining agreement,\nand they provide no basis for upholding the Federal\ncircuit rule which creates a categorical rule that\nemployers can't --\nQUESTION: Well, but -- but what we're trying to\nestablish -- and I think you would have to concede -- that\nthere are some instances in which once the employee is\nterminated, the grievance proceedings as to other matters\nmust stop.\nMR. GARRE: That can happen and it happens\nbecause of --\nQUESTION: And it -- and it's not just because\nit's the option of the union other than what the union\nagreed to in the collective bargaining agreement.\nMR. GARRE: The arrangement is the -- the\ngrievances are withdrawn by the union or they're withdrawn\nunder the arrangement that's been worked out under the\ncollective bargaining agreement.\nQUESTION: Suppose there's --\nQUESTION: Of course, that --\nQUESTION: -- the collective bargaining\nagreement is silent. Can the employer agency say, this\nemployee is no longer with us and therefore you should\nterminate? And the arbitrator could then do it?\nMR. GARRE: That -- that would be a decision\nleft to the arbitrator under the framework of the\nnegotiated grievance. It can happen.\nQUESTION: All right. Then once again, if it's\ncovered by the collective bargaining agreement, there's no\nchoice in the matter, the grievance is stopped. If it's\nnot covered by the collective bargaining agreement, it may\nstill be stopped at the option of the arbitrator, and\nthere's nothing the employee can do about it. Now, this\nmay not be fatal to your case, but if this happens, I\nthink we should confront it. And Justice Breyer --\nQUESTION: Mr. Garre, I assume that this would\nhappen. Does the ability of the union to terminate a\ngrievance exist even if the employee is fired the first\ntime? When event X occurs, the employer says, this is\nserious enough, you're fired after a proper hearing. It's\nup to the union whether to grieve that or not, isn't it?\nMR. GARRE: That's right.\nQUESTION: And the union could say, you know, I\nthink you deserved it and -- and we're not going to\nproceed any further.\nMR. GARRE: That's correct. The -- the act\nleaves to the --\nQUESTION: So, this injustice is not an -- if --\nif that -- if that's what it is, is not an injustice\npeculiar to this arrangement. It -- it's a necessary\neffect of leaving the prosecution of the grievance up to\nthe union.\nMR. GARRE: That's right. And -- and the act\ndoes leave the prosecution of the -- of the grievance up\nto the union and --\nQUESTION: Mr. Garre?\nMR. GARRE: -- through the arbitration.\nQUESTION: In civil litigation generally, when\nthere -- when there's a proceeding that's dependent on a\nprior proceeding that's on appeal, the standard operating\nprocedure is for the second proceeding to be held at\nabeyance pending the appeal of the first. Now, if we\nfollowed that model, then we could say, yes, the employer\ncould take the disciplinary step, but while that's being\nchallenged, the MSPB must hold its case in abeyance until\nthe grievance goes through the process.\nNow, why isn't that solution, which applies in\ncivil litigation generally, applicable here?\nMR. GARRE: It's -- it's very problematic. But\nfirst of all, the general rule applied by the Federal\ncourts in the collateral estoppel effect is the fact that\na prior case is on appeal doesn't prevent a court from\ngiving the underlying case collateral estoppel effect.\nBut --\nQUESTION: It doesn't -- doesn't prevent it, but\nit is the standard proceeding to hold the second one in\nabeyance.\nMR. GARRE: But --\nQUESTION: So that you don't have the -- the\nanomaly of giving effect to a judgment that has been\noverturned.\nMR. GARRE: There are several problems with the\nabeyance rule adopted by the Federal circuit, which is\nessentially the narrow rule which is hypothesized by\nrespondent.\nFirst and most fundamentally, the Civil Service\nReform Act limits the Federal circuit's scope of review to\nwhether a legal ruling of the board is arbitrary,\ncapricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise contrary\nto law. So, it's not enough for the Federal circuit to\ncome up with a rule that it thinks is fair or makes more\nsense. It has to come up with a rule which it thinks is\ncompelled by a provision of law. And the Federal circuit\ndid not cite any provision.\nSecondly, as a policy matter, the abeyance rule\nis very problematic. The abeyance rule, first of all,\nwould frustrate Congress' intent to streamline the\nadministrative appeals process --\nQUESTION: Why -- why, if the agency action goes\ninto effect immediately? What I'm presenting to you is\nthe -- the thing goes through the agency. The agency says\nyou're out, and the person is out. So, you have the\nefficiency concern.\nIf, as, and when the prior grievances are\noverturned so that the MSPB would no longer have those to\nrely on, then the remedy could be reinstatement with back\npay. But that example, if that's how the Federal circuit\ndecision works, meets your efficiency concern. In the\ninterim, the employee is out.\nMR. GARRE: Well, first of all, although the\nemployee is placed in a non-duty/non-pay status when she's\nremoved by the agency, she continues to fill a permanent\nslot on the agency's rolls, and if the abeyance rule is\ngoing to require agencies to keep the employee in that\nposition for months, if not years, on end, that's\nproblematic from the employer's perspective.\nSecond and more generally, the abeyance --\nQUESTION: Well, if that's -- would you explain\nthat if to me? Two, why would the -- why if the firing is\n-- is okay, at least until it's overturned, why couldn't\nthe -- the agency fill the vacancy?\nMR. GARRE: The -- the employee is placed --\nunder the practice followed by the Postal Service and I\nbelieve other employers as well, the employee occupies the\nfull-time slot, and until her removal is affirmed by the\nboard, she continues to fill that slot. Now, the employee\ncan replace her position with -- with temporary workers,\nbut nevertheless, from the employer's standpoint, he's\nprevented -- the employer is prevented from filling that\n-- that full-time slot.\nThe abeyance rule creates other problems. It --\nit leaves the most important disciplinary decisions,\nincluding a removal and -- hanging limbo for months, if\nnot years, on end.\nQUESTION: Well, when you speak of months --\nMR. GARRE: It also --\nQUESTION: May I just ask you to get into this\nproblem of months and years? The months and years problem\nI -- I understand is simply a function of what you claim\nto be the slow pace of arbitration. It may take months\nand years to do it. But if the arbitration, in effect, is\na creature of the collective bargaining agreement, why\nisn't it open to the Government and the -- the union\nsimply to come up with a streamlined arbitration procedure\nso instead of taking months and years, it's going to take\na month?\nMR. GARRE: I think they have tried, but the\nfact is that in the Postal Service, there's currently\n126,000 grievances pending in that process, backlogged.\nAnd the fact is that grievances are taking as long as\nyears, not in every case, but certainly in many cases,\nthey're taking years to be processed through arbitration.\nAnd this is the situation --\nQUESTION: Well, I guess we need more\narbitrators.\nMR. GARRE: Well, this is the situation that\nexists, and the board isn't required to hold its appeals\nin abeyance while that procedure is played out.\nQUESTION: No, but my -- my -- I guess my point\nis that you say this is the situation that exists. There\nare a number of reasons why it exists, but -- but one of\nthe responsible parties, it seems to me, is your client,\nis the Government. And why -- why isn't it the\nGovernment's responsibility, along with the union, to come\nup with a grievance procedure, whether it calls for more\narbitrators or different procedural rules? I have no\nidea, but why isn't it the -- the responsibility of the\nparties to come up with a procedure that's not going to\ntake years?\nMR. GARRE: Well, first of all, the inherent\ninformality of the grievance and arbitration process is\nalways going to invite delay. That's not new to this\ncase.\nAnd second of all --\nQUESTION: Well, litigation invites delay. But\nif a judge takes charge of a case, the delay is reduced,\nand the case moves forward expeditiously. Why not in\narbitration?\nMR. GARRE: Well, that hasn't happened, and I\ndon't think it's unique to the Postal Service arbitration\ncontext.\nThere are also mechanisms in place, as this\nCourt recognized in the Cornelius case, which can address\nthat, and that's that either side can file an unfair labor\npractice charge. Either side can seek to compel\narbitration. Either side can file a grievances.\nQUESTION: Mr. Garre, do you think that for\npurposes of either collateral estoppel or for purposes of\nwhether a criminal court can use a prior conviction in\ndeciding the sentence -- do you think it's accurate to\nanalogize the grievance procedure as a prior case pending\non appeal? Or would you rather characterize it as a\ncollateral attack --\nMR. GARRE: I think it's --\nQUESTION: -- upon final action by the employer?\nMR. GARRE: I think it's the latter. I think\nthat the grievance is a collateral proceeding. It's not\n-- it's not an appeal in itself. It's -- it's a\ncollateral proceeding --\nQUESTION: And -- and what happens to collateral\nattacks when you have a final criminal conviction and\nthere is a collateral attack on that criminal conviction,\nalthough the conviction itself is final? When a\nsentencing court has that conviction before it, does it\nnot use that conviction?\nMR. GARRE: Absolutely. In fact, I think the\nsentencing guidelines direct the court to take that\ninto --\nQUESTION: And if the collateral attack is later\nsuccessful, what is -- what is the remedy for the person\nwho's been convicted?\nMR. GARRE: Then they can bring it to the\nattention of the court and ask for relief.\nQUESTION: To reopen -- to reopen the\nproceeding.\nMR. GARRE: That's correct. And that -- and\nthat --\nQUESTION: What should we do here? We have a\ncase here where, as I understand it, there were three\nprior complaints by the employer that resulted in some\nform of disciplinary action. Grievances were filed in all\nthree. With the discharge proceeding, the employee then\nappealed to the board. And before the board acted, one of\nthe grievances pertaining to the first infraction was\nfound in the employee's favor.\nNow, what should we do? It's been remanded, as\nI understand it, now by the court of appeals to the board.\nDoes it need to be? Because the termination relied in\npart on all three of these things.\nMR. GARRE: Well, we think that this Court\nshould decide the question presented, reverse the decision\nbelow, and remand for further proceedings, allow the\nFederal circuit --\nQUESTION: What happened to the other two\ngrievances filed?\nMR. GARRE: The other two grievances were\nwithdrawn by the union when the board affirmed the -- the\nremoval. The union has -- has tried to reassert those,\nand the Postal Service's position is that this Court ought\nto decide this case, and then we can consider what should\nhappen there.\nNow, this Court should decide the question\npresented, and it can remand for further proceedings.\nThis -- the Federal circuit --\nQUESTION: Why is the remand necessary? What --\nif we agree with -- with you on the merits, what -- what\nremains to be decided by the Federal circuit?\nMR. GARRE: The -- the issue that -- that\nremains open is the question of what effect the grievance\nthat has been set aside should have on the board's\ndecision affirming the removal.\nNow, we think that an argument could be made\nthat the Federal circuit could affirm since the respondent\ndid not bring that grievance to the attention of the\nFederal -- to the Merit Systems Protection Board, although\nshe indisputably could have, and she raised it for the\nfirst time in the Federal circuit. But we don't think\nthat this Court needs to address --\nQUESTION: You say if we reverse on the question\npresented, we should leave it to the Federal circuit to\ndecide whether to direct reopening of the proceedings or\nto affirm the MSPB?\nMR. GARRE: We -- we -- that's what we would ask\nthis Court to do.\nWe're concerned about the Federal circuit's\ncategorical rule that Federal employers and the Merit\nSystems Protection Board can't consider these prior\ndisciplinary actions, engage in what is, for public\nemployers and private employers, a time-honored management\npractice --\nQUESTION: There's a disagreement between you\nand the respondent, is there not, about whether the\nagency, the Postal Service, is bound or whether it's only\nthe MSPB. I -- I think that you say the Federal circuit\nhas said nobody can take account of these prior\ninfractions. And the respondent says, the MSPB can't but\nthe employing agency can.\nMR. GARRE: We -- we think that the fairest\nreading of the court of appeals decision, as it applies\nboth to Federal employers and the Merit Systems Protection\nBoard, the holding of the court is unqualified. It says\nthat consideration may not be given to these prior actions\nas long as there are grievances. The remand order of the\ncourt indicates that the court of appeals viewed that rule\nas limiting the -- the prior actions that the agency could\nconsider in this case based on whether or not they're\nsubject to further proceedings.\nQUESTION: Okay. Their -- their point on that\nparticularly is -- the particular point I think on this is\nthat the Federal circuit really just said the -- the MSPB.\nAnd normally by the time something gets to the MSPB, all\nthe prior grievances will be resolved because that takes a\nvery long time to get there. And then if the occasional\ncase comes up where it wasn't resolved, the MSPB can just\npostpone deciding it, I guess, during which time the\nemployee is out of work. So, there's no harm done through\nthat narrow interpretation of the circuit.\nWhat's your response to that?\nMR. GARRE: Well, first of all, we don't -- we\ndon't think that's the fairest interpretation of the court\nof appeals decision. But even assuming this Court were to\nadopt that interpretation, there are several problems with\nthe Federal circuit's abeyance -- with respondent's\nabeyance rule.\nThe first is -- is that it frustrates Congress'\nintent to streamline the administrative appeals process.\nCongress placed a duty upon the Merit Systems Protection\nBoard to expedite its proceedings to the extent\npracticable because one of the factors that led to the\nenactment of the Civil Service Reform Act in 1978 was the\nconcern that the overly elaborate procedural protections\nwhich had developed under the prior Civil Service regime\nhad -- had prevented employers from taking the most\neffective disciplinary measures because of concerns that\nthings would be subjected to drawn-out appeals. Employers\nsimply weren't taking the most effective disciplinary\naction. That's one of the problems --\nQUESTION: Mr. Garre, does the Government\nacknowledge that the MSPB can determine that it is\narbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of discretion for the\nagency to decline to reopen a proceeding after a grievance\nhas gone forward and has found one of the convictions on\nwhich the dismissal is based to have been invalid?\nMR. GARRE: The -- the board's regulations\npermit the board to reopen any case at any time to\nreconsider it in light of a grievance which may have\nproved successful. And our position is that employees\nhave the opportunity to request --\nQUESTION: Excuse me. The board's regulations\npermit that?\nMR. GARRE: Yes.\nQUESTION: Is it a matter of the board's right?\nDoesn't the board have to find that the agency action, in\nrefusing to reopen, is arbitrary, capricious, or an abuse\nof discretion? I mean, the board can say when it will\nreopen it's own cases, but -- but the board can't tell the\nagency when the agency must reopen its cases, can it,\nunless the failure to reopen is arbitrary or capricious?\nMR. GARRE: No. That's correct. That's\ncorrect. I'm -- I'm sorry. I thought you were asking\nabout the board's reopening rule.\nQUESTION: I'm not talking about the board's\nreopening. I'm talking about ultimate success in the\ngrievance and then -- then the employee comes back to the\nagency and says, look, you -- you goofed. I really wasn't\nguilty of that. Would you reopen it? And the agency says\nno.\nMR. GARRE: Well, certainly in that --\nQUESTION: Can the board find that to be an\nabuse of discretion?\nMR. GARRE: That's -- the typical practice is\nthat the employee will go to the board and say, reopen my\nappeal because this grievance has proved successful. If\nthe employee went to the employer first and asked it to\nreconsider it, then I suppose the employee could appeal\nfrom another decision, if there were another decision, on\nthe discipline. But the more common practice is for the\nemployee to go to the Merit Systems Protection Board and\nsay, reopen my case because of this subsequent action.\nSo, typically --\nQUESTION: And that's the MSPB rule, that if --\nif while the MSPB thing is still going on, one of the\ngrievances -- the MSPB, if the person hasn't been fired,\nwill reconsider. So, the employee is instructed to go to\nthe MSPB, not back to the employing agency.\nMR. GARRE: The employee may do that, and the\nboard may do that. And the reopening procedure is\navailable under the board's regulations at any time.\nQUESTION: But it's discretionary, isn't it?\nThe board doesn't have to reopen if it doesn't want to.\nMR. GARRE: It is discretionary, and that's\nreally no different than any other reopening procedure\nwhich would exist to enable a court or other body to\nreconsider something in light of subsequent evidence.\nThe -- the respondent's basic position and the\nFederal circuit's basic position is predicated on the\nnotion that prior disciplinary actions are unreliable and\nthat Federal employers act in bad faith when they impose\ndiscipline. And we respectfully take issue with that.\nQUESTION: Also on the proposition that they are\nnot final in -- in the sense that -- that a -- a judicial\ndetermination is final. It seems to me that's -- that's\nimportant to the -- to the analysis.\nMR. GARRE: We think that they are final.\nThey're preceded by the procedural protections set out in\nthe act, and they're final enough to warrant the\nimposition of discipline in a minor case. If they're\nfinal enough to warrant the imposition of discipline,\nthey're final enough to warrant collateral effect in\nappeal before the board. And here we're talking about the\nminor actions.\nQUESTION: I don't want to consume your rebuttal\ntime, but there's one question that still hasn't been\nanswered for me.\nOn remand, what would your position be as to the\ntwo unadjudicated grievances?\nMR. GARRE: We think that the board can take\nthose into account under the Bolling framework, which\nallows the board to consider the prior disciplinary\nactions under a procedural framework which looks to the\nprocedural protections provided in those proceedings and\nthen considers whether those actions --\nQUESTION: What would your position be before\nthe Postal Service as to the union's request to reopen\nthose?\nMR. GARRE: To reopen the?\nQUESTION: Those -- or to continue those --\nthose pretermitted grievance proceedings.\nMR. GARRE: Those arbitrations could go forward.\nAgain, there's nothing that --\nQUESTION: And you have no objection to those\ngoing forward?\nMR. GARRE: The --\nQUESTION: I thought -- I thought the union was\nwanting to go forward, and the Postal Service didn't.\nMR. GARRE: Under the memorandum that's in\nplace, if the respondent's removal were affirmed by the\nboard, then under the memorandum in place, the union's\npractice is to withdraw those agreements under the\ncollective bargaining arrangement. That could be\nrenegotiated or reconsidered, but that's the practice in\nplace, and that's something that the act permits the\nparties to agree to under the negotiated grievance\nframework.\nQUESTION: Mr. Garre, apropos of the remand, you\nmentioned that the respondent had not brought to the\nboard's attention the fact that the arbitrator had ordered\nthe first disciplinary action vacated. Did the Government\nhave any responsibility to bring that to the attention of\nthe board?\nMR. GARRE: Ordinarily we would bring that to\nthe attention of the board. It was not brought to the\nattention of the board in this case because different\nparties were -- were governing the different proceedings.\nBut the fact is, is that it was not brought to the\nattention of the board. It could have been brought to the\nattention of the board and still could be today.\nIf there are no further questions --\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Garre.\nMr. Brands, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF HENK BRANDS\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. BRANDS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nWhat I would like to do is I would like to start\nby responding to Mr. Garre's suggestion that our proposed\nrule may be a good idea but is not required by the\nstatute. We think it most certainly is, and this also\npicks up on a question from Justice O'Connor.\n5 U.S.C., section 7701(c)(1)(B), which is copied\nat page 51 in the appendix to the petition, provides that\nthe decision of the agency shall be sustained -- and that\nis by the MSPB -- only if the agency's decision is\nsupported by a preponderance of the evidence. That\nprovision calls for de novo review in the MSPB, in which\nthe agency bears the burden of proof to prove -- of proof\nby a preponderance of the evidence.\nAnd it's important to understand that that\napplies not only to the conduct charged in the particular\ncharge before the MSPB -- here, for example, the conduct\ncharged to have taken place on September 13, 1997 -- but\nalso to aggravating facts to which the agency points in\nsupport of its choice of punishment. The MSPB --\nQUESTION: You're talking now about review\nbefore the MSPB, not before the Federal circuit. Is that\ncorrect?\nMR. BRANDS: That is correct, Mr. Chief Justice.\nThe MSPB has held that whenever the agency comes before\nthe MSPB and relies on aggravating facts, not necessarily\nthe particular charge before the MSPB, but other things,\nfor example, the employee is simply not very good or\nsomething like that, that has to be proven as well by --\nby a preponderance de novo in the MSPB. That was held in\nDouglas v. Veterans Administration in 1981, a seminal\ndecision in 1981, with which I do not --\nQUESTION: You mean even if a grievance is not\npending, the board would have to review the prior\ndisciplinary action to be sure that that was supported by\na preponderance of the evidence? Surely it doesn't mean\nthat.\nMR. BRANDS: Well, Justice Scalia, I think that\nthe burden of proof is always the same. The statute\nsays --\nQUESTION: Yes, but the burden of proof is this\nemployee has been convicted of prior disciplinary\nviolations in the past.\nMR. BRANDS: And --\nQUESTION: Q.E.D., proven.\nMR. BRANDS: Certainly when --\nQUESTION: You're saying that's not enough. The\n-- the board has to inquire as to whether that prior\nconviction, even if it was not grieved, was a valid one.\nMR. BRANDS: No, Justice Scalia, we're not\nsaying that. In the situation you posit, namely where\nthere was a past disciplinary action which either was not\ntaken to the board or which became final after it was\ntaken to the board -- in that situation it may well be\nreasonable to assume that the prior is supported by a\npreponderance of the evidence. And in fact, if it was\ntaken to the board or to an arbitrator and the arbitration\nhas become final, then one would think that ordinarily it\nwould become collateral estoppel. But that is not --\nQUESTION: Isn't that same presumption still\nvalid even though the -- the action is being grieved?\nMR. BRANDS: Well, two things --\nQUESTION: It's not as though it were unilateral\nemployer action without a hearing and procedural\nguarantees. There's a whole -- you know, a whole series\nof procedures that the employer has -- the Federal\nemployer has to go through, and -- and when those\nprocedures are followed, there is a judgment by the\nemployer.\nMR. BRANDS: That is certainly --\nQUESTION: And I gather that judgment is final\nuntil -- what you're grieving is employer action, and --\nand that action is final until a grievance overturns it.\nMR. BRANDS: Justice Scalia, I think that the\nanalogy that the Government would like to draw is to an\nagency action that is subject to section 706 review under\nthe APA, but that is not the right analogy, we\nrespectfully submit.\nThe right analogy would be to on-the-record\nadjudication under section 554 and 556 of the APA, the\nsituation where an agency simply levels charges. If you\ndon't do anything about them, those charges will become\nfinal, but if you put the agency to the burden of -- of\nproof, then you become the defendant in -- in the MSPB.\nYou -- you have the ability to put the Government to the\nburden of -- of proof.\nFor example, in Jackson v. Veterans\nAdministration, a Federal circuit decision of 1985, the --\nthe Federal circuit described it as follows: by seeking\nreview, an employee places the agency in the position of a\nplaintiff who has the burden of proof, who must come\nforward with evidence to establish the fact of misconduct,\nand the ultimate burden of persuasion is on the\nGovernment.\nQUESTION: Well, what we're reviewing here, Mr.\nBrands, is not the Merit Systems Protection Board's\naction, but the action of the Federal circuit. And I\nthink it's agreed that the board decision before it must\nstand unless it's arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of\ndiscretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\nMR. BRANDS: Right.\nQUESTION: As I understand it, the Federal\ncircuit here said this was not in accordance with law.\nAnd I was puzzled at that because they didn't seem to\npoint to any law.\nMR. BRANDS: Well, that is true, and perhaps the\nbrevity of the -- of the discussion by the court of\nappeals can be explained on the ground of the fact that\nthe Government did not respond to any of respondent's\narguments in the court of appeals.\nBut the basic answer here is that what is not in\naccordance with law about how the MSPB treats prior\ndisciplinary actions is that it disregards -- it\narbitrarily disregards the burden of proof.\nQUESTION: Well, but you -- you say it's not in\naccordance with law, and then in the same sentence, you\nsay it arbitrarily disregards the burden of proof. Now, I\nwould think those are two separate things under that\nstatutory language. If it's contrary to law, I think you\nhave to point to some provision of law --\nMR. BRANDS: And that's --\nQUESTION: -- which I don't think the Federal\ncircuit did.\nBut you also say it's -- it's arbitrary. And\nwhy -- why -- the Federal circuit didn't say that.\nMR. BRANDS: That is correct, but nevertheless,\nits judgment, we think, is -- is right on the money.\nWe think that there are two things wrong with\nthe way the MSPB does -- does -- treats prior disciplinary\nactions. One is it ignores the statutory burden of proof\nstandard, section 7701(c)(1)(B). Secondly --\nQUESTION: Now, that's -- that's the standard\nyou say governs the Merit Systems Protection Board?\nMR. BRANDS: That is correct. Whenever the --\nwhenever an agency comes before the MSPB, it cannot say\nyou have to defer to what we did because there was a\nhearing and because there was notice and so on and so --\nQUESTION: But that wasn't the basis for the\nFederal circuit's decision here.\nMR. BRANDS: We think it actually was, Your\nHonor, because under --\nQUESTION: Where -- where do you find that?\nMR. BRANDS: We find that at the petition\nappendix 7a where the court of appeals said that its rule\nis necessary because the foundation of the board -- of the\nMSPB's Douglas analysis would otherwise be compromised.\nThat may be a little telegraphic, but what the court of\nappeals meant by that is --\nQUESTION: Telescopic.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. BRANDS: And again, we would -- we would\nsuggest that the telegraphic nature of that may -- may\nalso be blamed on the Government's conduct of the\nlitigation in the court of appeals.\nQUESTION: Well, why -- why should it be blamed\non the Government?\nMR. BRANDS: Well, let -- let me just explain\nreal quick what we think that the court of appeals meant\nby that. The court of appeals meant to say this. Under\nDouglas v. Veterans Administration, the MSPB in any given\ncase will conduct a -- an inquiry to ensure that the\npenalty fits the crime, so to speak. It will make sure\nthat the punishment is not disproportional, is not\nunreasonable, and so on and so forth.\nIn the course of that, it is well established,\nalso under Douglas, the -- the agency may point to\naggravating facts. It may, for example, say this is not a\ngood employee or, as in this case, the employee has a\nprior disciplinary record. It may do that, but in\nDouglas, the MSPB held those facts must be supported by a\npreponderance of the evidence.\nQUESTION: I thought you already conceded in --\nin response to an earlier question of mine that -- that\nthe -- that the board does not have to establish by a\npreponderance of the evidence the accuracy of any prior\ndisciplinary conviction.\nMR. BRANDS: I don't think I said that, Your\nHonor.\nQUESTION: I thought you did. If you didn't,\nthen --\nMR. BRANDS: I would -- I would draw a\ndistinction --\nQUESTION: -- then why isn't it true? Suppose\nthere had been no grievance. Is it possible that the\nboard has to go back and decide whether the prior\ndisciplinary conviction was supported by a preponderance\nof the evidence?\nMR. BRANDS: Well, the -- the statutory burden,\nof course, always applies. The burden is on the agency.\nQUESTION: So, your answer is yes.\nMR. BRANDS: No, it's not necessarily yes. I\nwould -- I would distinguish between three factual\nscenarios.\nOne, the situation where a punishment is imposed\nand it simply becomes final because the employee never\ngrieves it or never goes to the MSPB. If it then comes up\nin a later case before the MSPB, I think it is certainly\nreasonable for the agency to say, here are the documents\nthat show that this employee was -- was disciplined. She\nor he never grieved it or never took it before the MSPB,\nand therefore, I have sustained my burden of proving --\nQUESTION: But it's not up to he or she. It's\nup to the union.\nMR. BRANDS: No, that's actually not entirely\ntrue. In a case like this, where a major penalty is at\nissue, the employee actually can take it to the MSPB and\nhas the right to do that.\nQUESTION: But still that isn't this case. We\ncould disagree with you and you'd still have a second\nargument I take it. If we disagree with you on that, do\nyou lose the case? No, because this -- in this case we\nhave a grievance that was not fully determined.\nMR. BRANDS: That's -- that's precisely correct,\nYour Honor. We have in this particular case --\nQUESTION: And -- and frankly, I have trouble\nwith the proposition you just stated, but this case is\nwith -- with an unadjudicated grievance or a grievance\nthat had not been fully determined.\nMR. BRANDS: Precisely. That's exactly correct.\nAnd --\nQUESTION: Well, Mr. Brands, as I understand it,\nthe board, MSPB, applies its so-called Bolling rule.\nThat is a case that the board itself decided, I guess.\nNow, if the board finds the factors in the Bolling case\nsatisfied is that enough to meet the statute?\nMR. BRANDS: We -- we don't think it is enough\nin a situation like this situation where the prior is\nbeing grieved, and here's why.\nQUESTION: Did you challenge the Bolling rule?\nIs that something we've been asked to review here?\nMR. BRANDS: Well, the Bolling rule is squarely\nbefore the Court. The Government relies on it, and what\nwe're saying is that the Federal circuit held essentially\nthat the Bolling rule is not right. It's not so much the\nBolling rule that is wrong --\nQUESTION: But do you assert that if -- if the\nboard applies its Bolling standard, that is not enough to\nsatisfy the statutory burden of proof?\nMR. BRANDS: We think it is enough in a\nsituation where the prior has become final on its own\nsteam. We think it is not enough in a situation where the\nprior is still being grieved, and here is why.\nIf the prior is being grieved, the Government's\ndecision does not get any deference. It -- the Government\nalways bears the burden.\nQUESTION: Well, but if you view the prior\ndisciplinary action taken by the employer as final,\nsubject only to some kind of collateral attack in a\ngrievance procedure, then it is final unless, at the end\nof the day, the grievance procedure is successful.\nMR. BRANDS: That is not how we would\ncharacterize it. Justice -- Your Honor, this morning the\nword collateral estoppel was first mentioned by Mr. Garre,\nand that is remarkable because --\nQUESTION: I think not collateral estoppel.\nViewing it -- the grievance as a collateral attack --\nMR. BRANDS: Well, we --\nQUESTION: -- on an otherwise final action.\nMR. BRANDS: We would not view it as a\ncollateral attack. What happens if -- you either go to an\narbitrator or to the MSPB, if you place the Government in\nthe position of being a plaintiff who has the burden of\nproof, who has the burden of proving de novo that what it\nalleges actually happens. It is interesting that the\nGovernment is -- is now saying that collateral attack\nsomehow applies to the agency's decision, and Justice\nGinsburg asked --\nQUESTION: Mr. Brands, it wasn't the Government.\nIt was Justice Scalia who said this is not comparable to\nan appeal for my suggestion that you would hold the second\nproceeding in abeyance would apply. It is not an appeal.\nMR. BRANDS: Very well.\nQUESTION: I'm -- I'm guilty.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: And unrepentant.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: But why did -- but when you answer\nthe question, would you tell us why it would make any\ndifference whether it is -- whether there's the collateral\nproceeding going on, whether there's a direct attack going\non? Why isn't there a presumption of regularity that\nattends the Government's action until it is, in fact,\noverturned as a result of the arbitration process?\nMR. BRANDS: We think there's no presumption of\nregularity because when the action comes before the board\nor before an arbitrator itself, it is not entitled to any\npresumption of regularity.\nQUESTION: That's for purposes of the\narbitration proceeding. But for purposes outside the\narbitration proceeding itself, why isn't there a\npresumption of regularity until it is overturned and\nvacated?\nMR. BRANDS: Simply for this reason, Justice --\nJustice Souter. Whenever the Government comes before the\nboard and points to aggravating circumstances, it must\nprove those by a preponderance of the evidence.\nQUESTION: But that's the -- but I mean, that\ngets us back to the question we keep going back and forth\non. Do they have to prove the fact of the determination\nthat there was in fact some prior infraction or do they\nhave to prove the existence of the infraction in substance\njust as if they were proving it as part of the current\ncharge? And it seems odd to me to say that they would\nhave to prove it just as much as if it were part of the\ncurrent charge.\nMR. BRANDS: Well, I would -- I would\ndistinguish between three situations. If it has been\nadjudicated and has become final before an arbitrator,\nthen collateral estoppel will apply. If, however, it is\nbeing challenged, collateral estoppel should not apply.\nIt is hornbook law that collateral estoppel does not apply\nwhen a decision --\nQUESTION: Well, I'm not saying that collateral\nestoppel applies. The -- the -- you know, the employee\nmay be able to attack it. I'm simply saying that if it is\n-- it is not somehow shown to be invalid affirmatively,\nwhy shouldn't a presumption of regularity attach. And I\nthink you're saying that no presumption of regularity\nattaches, that the Government has the burden as an initial\nmatter.\nMR. BRANDS: That is correct, although that\nburden will be very easy to discharge in a case where a\nprior has already become final or, for that matter, where\na prior was never attacked.\nQUESTION: Okay. And you're saying the reason\nit isn't easy, when it is attacked, is that there is no\npresumption of regularity.\nMR. BRANDS: There is --\nQUESTION: And I want to know there should be no\npresumption of regularity.\nMR. BRANDS: Presumption of regularity are\napplied to a Government action that itself is entitled to\ndeference when it is reviewed by a court. The kind of\nGovernment action that we're talking about --\nQUESTION: But that's my question. Is it\nentitled to enough deference so that all you have to do is\nprove the fact of the Government action, that being\nsufficient, unless it is affirmatively shown that the\nGovernment action was wrong or invalid? That's the\nquestion.\nMR. BRANDS: The Government action, if it is\ntaken to the MSPB, is not entitled to any deference at all\nbecause the Government bears the burden of proving de novo\nthat what happened actually occurred. Therefore, if\nthere's no deference -- if the Government is not entitled\nto --\nQUESTION: Then -- then what you're saying is\nthat the -- that the aggravating fact is subject to\nexactly the same burden of proof that the specific\ninstance of -- of later conduct is -- is subject to, the\n-- the instance that gets us before the board on appeal\nanyway.\nMR. BRANDS: That's precisely correct, although\nas I said, in two situations that is a burden of proof\nthat should be very easy to discharge.\nQUESTION: Yes, and I understand.\nMR. BRANDS: It's only in that third situation.\nAnd note that the Government cannot rely on collateral\nestoppel in that situation because it is well established\n-- it's hornbook law -- that -- that when something is\nreviewed de novo, it is not subject to collateral review.\nFor example, Wright and Miller say that in section 4433.\nQUESTION: Well, but if -- if you're talking\nabout judicial proceedings, I don't think those rules\nwould necessarily carry over to this sort of rather low\nlevel administrative proceeding.\nMR. BRANDS: Your Honor, far be it for me, of\ncourse, to -- to argue that collateral estoppel should\napply, but the MSPB, for example, has applied collateral\nestoppel to prior final arbitral orders, and we don't\nnecessarily see anything wrong with that. And we think\nthat if the Government later comes before the MSPB and\npoints to a prior that was upheld by an arbitrator, it\nthereby -- it thereby discharges its burden of proving\nthat the prior conduct actually happens. We don't think\nthat in a situation where that prior is being reviewed de\nnovo it makes sense to simply assume that the conduct\ncharged in that prior disciplinary action actually\noccurred.\nQUESTION: Well, but to say that the prior is\nreviewed de novo, I'm not sure that that is an entirely\naccurate statement because it was a prior that was left\nunchallenged, I take it, at the time.\nMR. BRANDS: No, Your Honor. All three priors\nhere were, in fact, under review at the time that the\nGovernment pointed to them as -- as --\nQUESTION: So, your statement then is limited to\nthe sort of prior which is under review.\nMR. BRANDS: That's -- that's precisely correct.\nWe're not saying that the Government, when -- when\ncharging an employee with misconduct, may not point to\nthat prior, but when it comes before the MSPB, it must\ndischarge its burden of proof.\nQUESTION: What is --\nQUESTION: What -- what if the employer says\nthere is a prior here, as well as the current conduct,\nthat has never been grieved, never been challenged?\nMR. BRANDS: Well, in that situation, it would\nordinarily be reasonable for the Government to argue and\nthe MSPB to -- to agree that it's reasonable to assume\nthat a preponderance of the evidence exists in such a\nsituation because if the -- if the employee thought that a\npreponderance did not exist, then he or she would probably\nhave taken it to the MSPB or to an arbitrator.\nQUESTION: The board has to assume that. But as\nI understand your case, the agency itself doesn't.\nMR. BRANDS: Well, the agency is not -- is not\n-- the question of whether or not the agency may simply\nlevel a charge is not subject to this burden of proof.\nThis burden of proof applies before the MSPB.\nQUESTION: Do you know of any other situation in\nwhich the -- the review of agency action is conducted on a\nbasis more demanding than the agency action itself?\nMR. BRANDS: Your Honor --\nQUESTION: That is to say, if the agency ignored\nthe fact that -- that a grievance was pending, you assert\nthat would have been entirely lawful. The agency could\nsay, I don't care if a grievance is pending. He's been\nconvicted. On the basis of that, you're fired. And\nthat's perfectly okay, you say, for the agency to do.\nMR. BRANDS: Well, that --\nQUESTION: But then when it's on appeal to the\nMerit Systems Protection Board, you say the Merit Systems\nProtection Board can reverse the agency because at that\nstage, suddenly the fact of the prior disciplinary action\nis not determinative. That's -- it's very strange. I\ndon't know any other instance in administrative law where\nwhat the agency does is right, but on appeal it's wrong.\nMR. BRANDS: I would not characterize it as an\nappeal. It's -- it's different from that. It is much\nmore like when, for example, the FTC or the SEC staff\ncharges a defendant with misconduct, it has to prove that\nto an administrative judge. When the administrative judge\nhears the case, the burden rests on the agency to prove\nthat by a preponderance. However, when the --\nQUESTION: But -- but -- go on.\nMR. BRANDS: When the agency levels its charges,\nbrings its charges in the first place, it does not have to\nworry, do we -- can we sustain the burden of proof. It\ncan simply say we think there's probable cause of\nmisconduct here. It is much more like a prosecutor who\ncharges misconduct.\nQUESTION: Well, of course, it has to worry\nabout the burden of proof. It's arbitrary, capricious, or\ncontrary to law if it isn't supported by the evidence.\nMR. BRANDS: I don't think so, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: And what you're asserting is that\nthis evidence is -- is good evidence before the agency,\nthe mere fact of the prior disciplinary action, but it\nsuddenly becomes bad evidence before the Merit Systems\nProtection Board.\nMR. BRANDS: Well, it's not bad evidence. It's\nsimply that before the MSPB, the -- the Government agency\nhas to prove his case by a preponderance. Now, at the\ntime that it charges, presumably the agency thinks that\nthose priors are good even though they're being grieved,\notherwise it wouldn't have imposed them in the first\nplace. But that doesn't mean that it doesn't have the\nburden of proving by a preponderance when it comes in the\nMSPB.\nQUESTION: Mr. Brands?\nQUESTION: Throughout the -- the proceedings\nbefore the Merit Systems Protection Board, in the initial\ndecision of the administrator, the petitioner is referred\nto -- the respondent is referred to as the appellant. I\nmean, certainly the Merit Systems Protection Board thought\nit was an appeal.\nMR. BRANDS: Well, Your Honor, it -- that is\ntrue. It is termed an appellant, but again, what -- what\nJackson v. Veterans Administration, a Federal circuit case\nfrom 1985, says about that is that the employee, while\ndenominated the appellant, has the advantageous\nevidentiary position of a defendant. So, it is much\nlike --\nQUESTION: Where did the Federal circuit get\nthat from?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. BRANDS: That is simply because before the\nFederal -- before the MSPB, the burden is on the\nGovernment agency to prove its charges and review is de\nnovo. The burden of proof is on the Government.\nQUESTION: Where is -- where is section 7701(b)\nin the material before us in the briefs?\nMR. BRANDS: It's in the appendix to the\npetition, page 51, and we refer to it in our -- our claim\nrested on the -- on this burden of proving --\nQUESTION: Well, in your opinion, a woman who\nworks for an agency is late for the 20th time. 19 priors\nare under grievance. Her boss, fed up, says, you're\nfired. All right? Now, what's supposed to happen?\nMR. BRANDS: The Government can fire her.\nThere's no question about that. However, if those priors\nare all being grieved in those grievance proceedings, the\nGovernment will have to prove its case.\nQUESTION: All right. Now, that -- that -- of\ncourse, then the -- as I read the Federal circuit, it says\njust what you say. We hold that as a matter of a law,\nconsideration may not be given to prior disciplinary\nactions that are the subject of ongoing proceedings\nchallenging their merits. So, what you're saying is they\ncan't use those.\nMR. BRANDS: The Government --\nQUESTION: The Government cannot use them.\nMR. BRANDS: No, I'm not saying that. The\nGovernment agency is entitled to rely on them. The\nGovernment agency is allowed to say, you were late today.\nBy itself, that would not be enough to fire you. However,\nyou did it 19 times before, and because you did it 19\ntimes before, we're firing you today. We know that your\n19 priors are still being grieved, but we think that all\nof those 19 are good.\nQUESTION: Right.\nMR. BRANDS: Now, however, when that removal\ncomes to the MSPB, in the ordinary case, those 19 priors\nwill have become final. Either they will have been\nsustained or they will have been overturned by an\narbitrator or by the MSPB.\nIn the very unusual situation, the white\nelephant that we have here, the case where somehow the\nMSPB proceeding goes faster than the prior grievances, in\nthat very unusual situation, we have a problem. What we\nhave there is that the Government would have to prove its\ncase by a -- by a preponderance, but those priors are\nstill -- have not become final yet.\nQUESTION: All right. So, the -- the opposite\nside is that would be a reasonable approach. The agency\nsays, we have another reasonable approach. Our reasonable\napproach is that we -- we just let them take account of\nthe fact that they've already been -- you know, they're\nalready finished, the 19, but the individual can ask us to\nsee if they're supported or clearly erroneous.\nMR. BRANDS: What we think is --\nQUESTION: That's Bolling. So -- so, that's\ntheir approach. So, why is yours more reasonable? Theirs\n-- they see yours as reasonable. They say we have a\ndifferent one.\nMR. BRANDS: It's not a question of\nreasonableness, Your Honor. We think it's a question of\nwhat the statute says.\nQUESTION: Well, yes, but that -- that statute\nseems to be talking about cross referencing B. It seems\nto be talking about this proceeding. There has to be a\npreponderance of evidence in this proceeding. And so, the\nissue is not resolved by the statute. It's up for grabs.\nI mean --\nMR. BRANDS: Your Honor --\nQUESTION: -- the question is, is this piece of\npaper, which says you were convicted 19 times before --\nthere are 19 pieces of paper, okay -- whether that counts\nas evidence towards the preponderance to support what they\ndid now. And you could make the argument either way.\nMR. BRANDS: Respectfully, Your Honor, that is\nnot how the MSPB itself has interpreted section\n7701(c)(1)(B). It reads that the burden of proof as\napplying not only to the particular charge before the\nboard, here case number 4. It reads it also as applying\nto any aggravating circumstance, and in our view, it\ncouldn't really be any other way.\nQUESTION: Well, now, Mr. Brands, we're\nreviewing the Federal circuit's decision here, not the\nMSPB's decision. Now, did the Federal circuit incorporate\nthat, the view you're expressing --\nMR. BRANDS: Yes.\nQUESTION: -- now, into its opinion?\nMR. BRANDS: Yes, it did, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Whereabouts?\nMR. BRANDS: And this is what I was referring to\nwhen I was referring to that phrase on page 7 of the\nappendix to the petition. It said, the Douglas analysis\nwould otherwise be compromised. And here's what it meant\nby that.\nQUESTION: Well, how can you tell --\nMR. BRANDS: The Douglas --\nQUESTION: How can you tell that one cryptic\nphrase -- how can you tell that's what it meant by that?\nMR. BRANDS: Well, it actually said it twice,\nYour Honor. But the reason why we believe that's what it\nsaid is the Douglas analysis means that the MSPB in any\ngiven case must ensure that there is a fit between the\npunishment and the crime. And the way it does that is it\nlooks at the gravity of the particular offense, but it\nalso looks at other aggravating circumstances. That\nanalysis would be undermined, would be nullified if the\nGovernment could simply come in and say, we got this one\nlittle charge, and then we have these 19 others. Now,\nthese 19 others have never been proven, but you have to\ntake them as a given and you can only review them for\nclear error even though --\nQUESTION: They have been proven. I mean,\nthat's the fallacy in that. There was a proceeding before\nthe board in which the board adjudicator found that they\nhad been proven.\nMR. BRANDS: That's actually not correct, Your\nHonor. What -- what happens in a disciplinary action is\nthat the Government -- a supervisor will simply charge the\nmisconduct, and then from there, it goes through these\ngrievance steps that are simply nothing other than another\nsupervisor saying, yes, it looks right to us. And\nfinally, it will go to an arbitrator, and that is the\nfirst place where the Government is actually put to its\nburden of proving its charges by a preponderance.\nQUESTION: Is that right? I mean --\nMR. BRANDS: Oh, absolutely. These priors have\nnever gone --\nQUESTION: The agency adjudicator can say, well,\nit wasn't proven, but you know, I think we ought to put\nthis on your record anyway.\nMR. BRANDS: Well, the agency adjudicator --\nQUESTION: Surely the agency has to find, by a\npreponderance of the evidence, that the employee was\nguilty of the alleged infraction.\nMR. BRANDS: But the question is whether --\nwhether there's any reason for the MSPB to defer to that,\nand we submit no. And here's why. If that action itself\nwere appealed to the MSPB, that action itself would not be\nentitled to any deference. It's sort of like a prosecutor\n-- prosecutor coming before a trial court. Nobody would\nargue that somehow the jury, or -- or in a bench trial,\nthe trial court, is supposed to defer to the prosecutor.\nAnd we think that just -- just that those charges have\nbeen leveled in the past rather than now before the agency\n-- before the MSPB doesn't mean that any more deference --\nQUESTION: But what we're talking --\nQUESTION: If you really believe that --\nQUESTION: What we're talking about here is --\nQUESTION: If you really believe that, then --\nQUESTION: -- sentencing.\nQUESTION: -- then you should say that even when\nthere is no grievance, the board should not take account\nof the prior -- of the prior disciplinary conviction. If\nyou really believe that --\nMR. BRANDS: Well, respectfully --\nQUESTION: -- you would say even if it's not\nbeing grieved.\nMR. BRANDS: Justice Scalia, I -- I wouldn't --\nI wouldn't put it right that way or precisely that way. I\nwould think that the burden of proving that the prior\nconduct, the misconduct, happened is still upon the\nagency. However, it is very easy to prove it because\nordinarily what the Government will simply be able to do\nis say, look, we have here a piece of paper that said she\ndid it and she never went to the MSPB or to an arbitrator.\nSo, therefore, she probably did it. If in that\nsituation --\nQUESTION: Mr. Brands, before you finish, I'd\nlike you to answer the Government's assertion that your\nneat solution, which is, agency, you can fire this person,\nbut MSPB must abide the grievance. And then if the\ngrievances are successful from the employee's point of\nview, there would be reinstatement, back pay, I take it,\nall that.\nMr. Garre told us that the Government is stuck\nbecause it can't fill that slot in the meantime because\nthe employee may come back. How do you answer that?\nMR. BRANDS: Well, it's an argument that's\nraised for the first time today here at the lectern. But\nI -- I don't think that that is -- that -- that doesn't\njustify saying, well, in that case, we're going to say to\nthe Government, you don't have -- you don't have to meet\nyour burden of proof. The burden, of course, is --\nQUESTION: But it does -- it does weaken your\nargument that the Government serves its purpose. It can\nfire this person. It can replace the person. And then at\nthe end of the day, if the grievances are overturned, that\nperson simply gets reinstated.\nMR. BRANDS: Well, I don't think it quite\nweakens our argument, Your Honor, because we're talking\nabout letter carriers in this particular case, for\nexample. It's not as though the particular route that was\npreviously served by Maria Gregory is not -- is not\ngetting mail at this moment. What happens, of course, is\nthat other letter carriers are -- are put to work on that\nroute, and things march along just fine, which I assume is\nwhy the --\nQUESTION: Were the briefs correct in telling us\nthere are 126,000 pending grievances in the postal system?\nMR. BRANDS: The short answer is no, if the\nallegation is that those are disciplinary grievances.\nThere are 126,000 cases pending, but the vast majority of\nthose are contract grievances and not disciplinary\ngrievances. Disciplinary grievances march through the\nprocess in about a year or less, as in fact happened in --\nin the two cases to which the -- the Government points in\n-- in that footnote 3 in its reply brief.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Brands.\nMr. Garre, you have 2 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY G. GARRE\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. GARRE: The Federal circuit ruling in this\ncase is not based in any way on the burden of proof\napplied in board proceedings. And respondent didn't even\nargue before the board that the -- that the board was\napplying the wrong burden of proof in challenging or\nconsidering her prior actions.\nRespondent's reliance on the Douglas case is a\nlittle bit odd because that case was followed by the\nBolling case and scores of other precedents which\nestablished the framework by which the Merit Systems\nProtection Board considers prior disciplinary actions,\neven when they're subject to grievance. The board allows\n-- it requires the employer to prove the fact of the prior\naction, and then it -- it allows the employee -- in\naddition to the fact of the prior action, that certain\nprocedural protections were present. And then it allows\nthe employee an opportunity to collaterally attack that\naction.\nThat -- that comports with the employer's burden\nof proof under the statute. It's supported by decades of\nadministrative practice, and the Federal circuit had\nabsolutely no basis for invalidating that practice without\nciting to any provision of -- of law or anything else.\nNow, to follow up on a question by Justice\nKennedy, I want to make clear that we would not object to\nthe continuance of the grievance. The employers would not\nobject if this Court reverses the decision below.\nIf there are no further questions.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr. Garre.\n"
