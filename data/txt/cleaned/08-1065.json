McGhee.\nMr. Sanders?\nORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN SANDERS\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. SANDERS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nIf a prosecutor's absolute immunity in\njudicial proceedings means anything, it means that a\nprosecutor may not be sued because a trial has ended in\na conviction, Yet that is exactly what happened in this\ncase.\nLower courts may not fashion exceptions to\nthe immunity this -- this Court provided in Imbler by\npurporting to relocate a due process injury from the\ntrial to an earlier investigation.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Your -- your case here is\na polite way of telling us we wasted our time in\nBuckley v. Fitzsimmons.\nMR. SANDERS: Your Honor --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I mean, we were just\nspinning our wheels in that case?\nMR. SANDERS: Your Honor, I don't believe so\nat all. I think that this case presents exactly the\nquestion that Buckley reserved, and that is whether the\nfabrication of evidence by a prosecutor in and of\nitself, without regard to its use in some way, states a\nconstitutional cause of action.\nIn this case, the use at trial, obviously,\nwas absolutely immunized under Imbler and many of this\nother -- this Court's other precedents. Despite\nrespondent's best efforts to argue that there was some\nsort of due process violation caused by the fabrication\nitself, without regard to its use in some way, there\nsimply is no support for that.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Does that mean that, even\nif we were dealing with police officers who did what the\nprosecutors were alleged to have done at the\ninvestigation stage, no prosecutor, only police\ninvestigators, the fact that a trial and a conviction\nhad occurred would mean that the police officers were\nnot liable, either?\nMR. SANDERS: Your Honor, the fact that a\ntrial and conviction had occurred could mean that the\npolice officers were liable because of the due process\nviolation at the trial, but in footnote 5 of Buckley,\nthis Court was very clear and insisted that there is no\ndisjunction between observing that a prosecutor, like a\npolice officer, has only qualified immunity during the\ninvestigation while, at the same time, insisting that\nthat does not affect the fact that the prosecutor has\nabsolute --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Take two cases. One is\nJustice Ginsburg's case, a police officer fabricates the\nevidence, dupes the prosecuting attorney, or -- or\ndoesn't fully disclose. Case two, a prosecutor does the\nsame thing and gives it to a fellow prosecutor.\nSame -- should the analysis be precisely the\nsame?\nMR. SANDERS: Your Honor, it should be the\nsame if the prosecutor in the second case that you\nhypothesize had nothing to do with the later\nprosecution. In other words, if we could view that\nprosecutor simply as an ordinary citizen, simply as a\ncomplaining witness, as analogous to a police officer,\nSo there's no argument in this case that simply, by\nvirtue of being a prosecutor, a prosecutor has absolute\nimmunity.\nThe courts below wrongfully abrogated trial\nimmunity because trial is the only place where the\ninjury of conviction and subsequent incarceration could\nhave taken place. Without reference to that specific\ninjury, there is simply no other injury. The --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I'm not sure that I fully\ngrasp your answer to my first question and to Justice\nKennedy's, that is, yes or no, if everything that\nhappened was alleged to have happened, but it was done\nby a police officer or a different prosecutor,\nnonetheless, the trial went on, the fabricated evidence\nwas introduced, without any participation by the actual\nprosecutor in that fabrication, does a conviction --\ndoes the -- do the police officers or the prosecutors\nthat was not involved in the trial get absolute -- are\nthey -- are they no more liable, not because they have\nabsolute immunity, but because the trial and conviction\nat which the evidence was used overtakes what liability\nthey might have had, absent the trial?\nIs that your position?\nMR. SANDERS: Your Honor, our position is --\nI believe I would agree with you. Our position is there\nis no liability for the initial fabrication. As the\nUnited States explains in its brief, for a police\nofficer to be held liable in those circumstances, it\nwould need to be under some sort of malicious\nprosecution theory that would depend on the actual\nconviction and the use of the evidence at trial.\nBut the use of the evidence at trial is the\ninjury itself, and that is exclusively a prosecutorial\nact, only a prosecutor could --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You're not answering the\nquestion clearly. Are both the prosecutor, in Justice\nGinsburg's hypothetical, and the policeman liable?\nCan't you answer that? Yes or no.\nMR. SANDERS: Yes. This Court --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Good. That's what I\nthought your answer was.\nMR. SANDERS: Yes. The police officer --\nlikely, this Court has never -- never addressed the\nissue. The police officer would likely be liable\nbecause the police officer would have no immunity for\nthe use of the evidence.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, she's more concerned\nabout the prosecutor, and the prosecutor, also, would be\ntreated just like a police officer?\nMR. SANDERS: If the prosecutor performed no\nprosecutorial function, that's correct.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: In the case?\nMR. SANDERS: That's correct, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But only if the --\nonly if the evidence is presented at trial?\nMR. SANDERS: But only if the evidence is\npresented at trial because that's the only way the\nevidence can provide injury and so --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So the -- so the law is\nthe more deeply you're involved in the wrong, the more\nlikely you are to be immune? That's a strange\nproposition.\nMR. SANDERS: Your Honor, I think it's not\nthe more deeply you are involved, it's whether you are\nin the unique position of a prosecutor to cause injury\nby use of the evidence at trial. That is exclusively a\nprosecutorial function.\nThe function test of -- of Buckley goes to\nwhat function someone is performing, but only the\nprosecutor can ever perform the function of actually\nusing the evidence.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But it's strange to say\nyou can have a prosecutor, who wasn't involved in the\ntrial, would have liability, but as long as the\nprosecutor, in effect, turns the investigatory stage\nmaterial over to himself, rather than to another\nprosecutor, then there's absolute immunity.\nMR. SANDERS: Your Honor, that is correct,\nbut I think the Court, more than 80 years ago, when it\nsummarily affirmed Yaselli v. Goff from the Second\nCircuit, spoke to this question.\nIn that case, the Court said -- affirmed the\nSecond Circuit in its view that, if a prosecutor\ncannot -- if a prosecutor has absolute immunity for\nacting maliciously at trial, that immunity cannot be\ncircumvented --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: No, but the -- the\nquestion is not at trial, nothing about trial. It's the\npretrial conduct.\nMR. SANDERS: The -- the odd thing about --\nif we are taking out reference to the trial itself, then\nthere simply can be no claim. Respondents urge a new\nfreestanding right, separate and apart from the due\nprocess trial right, yet at the same time --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But you said that\nthere -- that there would be liability, as long as it\nwasn't the same person involved in the investigation and\nthe trial. Even though there had been a trial, you\nsay -- you answered Justice Scalia, that those people\nseparated from the trial would be liable, even though\nthere was a trial, and it's at issue.\nMR. SANDERS: Your Honor, looking to the\ncommon law, the rationale for that would be a form of\nmalicious prosecution, but as you observed in your\nconcurrence in Albright, asserting malicious prosecution\nagainst a prosecutor would be anomalous because it's the\nprosecutor who is exclusively responsible for causing\nthe kind of injury.\nIf a police officer or a nonprosecuting\nprosecutor simply fabricates the evidence, as Chief\nJudge Easterbrook of the Seventh Circuit said, there can\nbe no cause of action.\nIt is the exclusive function of a prosecutor\nin a case who uses the evidence who can cause the\ninjury, and although --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But that makes no sense\nbecause, if you go down that road, then what you're\nsaying is that neither the -- neither a police officer\nor a different prosecutor who fabricated evidence could\nbe liable, either, because the only person who causes\nthe deprivation is the prosecutor who uses the false\nevidence at trial.\nMR. SANDERS: Your Honor, this Court has not\nspoken to that question, but as you stated, that would\nbe the rationale of the restatement actually. The\nrestatement says, if there is no deception of the\nprosecutor, then it is the prosecutor's willful and free\nwill use of the evidence at trial.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Now, the Second Circuit\nin its decision, Judge Newman, looked at it and said\nthere are two causes to the injury here. One is the\nfabrication, joint tortfeasors. There are two people\nwho can cause any injury and the prosecutor who actually\nputs the evidence in at trial. That's how you hold\npolice officers and different prosecutors liable because\nthey are assisting in the violation that is occurring.\nMR. SANDERS: Uh-hmm.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Why doesn't that theory\nfit the same prosecutor who commits two different acts?\nMR. SANDERS: Your Honor, I think --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: One commits the direct\nviolation, and the other act, the investigatory act,\ncontributes to it, leads to it as a joint activity with\nit.\nMR. SANDERS: Your Honor, I believe the\nanalysis is not that it -- because it leads to the\ninjury itself. The tort of wrongful conviction based on\nuse of false evidence at trial has only one element\nunder this Court's precedents in Pyle and Mooney and\nHysler and Rochin. That element is the prosecutor's use\nof the evidence at trial. But simply because that act\nis absolutely immune is not to say that someone else\nwho's responsible for --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You're confusing -- the\nconstitutional injury is the deprivation of liberty.\nThat's the injury.\nMR. SANDERS: That's correct.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What causes that injury\nis not an element of the crime. It is -- the question\nis have you proven the violation, have you proven the\ninjury.\nMR. SANDERS: Well --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So why does the use\ndefine the scope of the injury?\nMR. SANDERS: Because that is the way a\nprosecutor would be held liable. The cause of action\nagainst a prosecutor, even though he would be absolutely\nimmune, would be the prosecutor's knowing or even\nunknowing use of the false evidence at trial. But in\nthis case, Respondents ask for a free-standing due\nprocess right that would somehow at the same time\nprotect the interest against wrongful conviction at\ntrial. That simply can't be. This Court's decision --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What about the view that\nJudge Fairchild expressed very simply. He said if this\nfabrication had not occurred, there never would have\nbeen any trial.\nMR. SANDERS: Your Honor, as we discussed in\nour opening brief in this case, I think that Judge\nFairchild's reasoning is classic malicious prosecution\nreasoning. That is, that it's the false evidence that\nimpelled the prosecution. But again, this Court has\nbeen absolutely clear that a malicious prosecution\ntheory cannot be asserted against a prosecutor because a\nprosecutor can initiate willfully and maliciously a\nwrongful prosecution based on good evidence, bad\nevidence, or no evidence at all.\nIt's simply untenable to say -- and this\nCourt's decision last term in Van de Kamp made clear\nthat where the injury comes at trial, where that is the\ninterest protected against, that you can somehow\nabrogate immunity and continue with a case based on that\nkind of claim based on a claim of an earlier due process\nright --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Was there no injury in\nthe period before? Let's leave out the trial for a\nmoment. There was a deprivation of liberty during the\ninvestigatory stage.\nMR. SANDERS: Your Honor, I think any\nearlier deprivation of liberty would be covered by the\nFourth Amendment. The Fourth Amendment is not\nimplicated in the question presented here. It has not\nbeen briefed. Surely there would be an interest against\nwrongful seizure or, since this -- these arrests were\npursuant to legal process, against a form of malicious\nprosecution. But again, that would be a Fourth\nAmendment theory and it could not be asserted if it is\nmalicious prosecution against a prosecutor.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Would you clear up one\nthing for me I really don't quite understand. You do\nagree that if the police officers did this there would\nbe liability?\nMR. SANDERS: Your Honor, this Court has not\naddressed that issue. That is the view of some of the\ncircuits and the Restatement.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Are you assuming that to\nbe correct or are you disputing that?\nMR. SANDERS: We're assuming that to be\ncorrect, but if I --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But if that's true, why\ndoesn't the trial immunize the police officers because\nthey didn't cause the trial? Well, they were in the\nbackground in the same sense that these prosecutors are.\nBut why would the police officers be liable?\nMR. SANDERS: A police officer would never\nget immunity at trial because --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Not to get immunity, but\nwhy is he liable? Why is he liable? Because the injury\nwas caused by the trial, if I understand your theory.\nMR. SANDERS: The theory of the common law\non malicious prosecution would be that the police\nofficer is liable because his fabrication of evidence\nimpelled the proceeding, caused the proceeding .\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But it was not a malicious\nprosecution. The prosecution -- the prosecutors acted\nin good faith all the way through, so there is no\nmalicious prosecution. So what is the basis for\nliability against the police officers?\nMR. SANDERS: The basis for liability\nprecisely against the police officer would be the\nviolation of the due process right to a fair trial,\nWrongful conviction on the basis of the introduction --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Why doesn't the theory\napply to the facts of this case also?\nMR. SANDERS: This theory wouldn't apply to\nthe facts of this case because in this case the\nprosecutors made the decision independently to initiate\nthe prosecution. It's undisputed that they did that in\ntheir capacity as prosecutors. They -- the police\nofficers' act could not cause injury but for the\nimmunized act of a prosecutor beginning the prosecution\nand conducting the trial.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: This investigation by the\nprosecutor could not have caused injury but for the\nimmunized act of going forward with the trial.\nMR. SANDERS: But, Your Honor, I think --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: What's the difference?\nMR. SANDERS: I think that that reasoning\nwould be to what this Court affirmed in Yaselli and what\nthis Court has said -- and which the Court has\nrepeatedly cited favorably, and that is -- and it would\nalso run up against the concerns that Justice Kennedy\nindicated in his concurrence in Buckley, which this --\nthe majority in Buckley also disputed and said there is\nno disjunction between qualified immunity for a\nprosecutor during an investigation but absolute immunity\nfor the act of setting the prosecution in motion.\nThe Court was absolutely clear in footnote 5\nof Buckley that there was no disjunction, and as this\nCourt has indicated in Malley v. Briggs and other cases,\nanything other than absolute immunity for a prosecutor\nwould impair the -- would impair the performance of a\ncentral actor in the judicial process.\nWith the Court's permission, I'll reserve\nthe balance of my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Katyal.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF NEAL K. KATYAL\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,\nAS AMICUS CURIAE,\nSUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS\nMR. KATYAL: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice\nand may it please the Court:\nThis Court's decision in Buckley v.\nFitzsimmons the question presented today, which is\nwhether a cause of action exists against prosecutors\nalleged to have fabricated evidence. Respondents'\nanswer to this question asks this Court to announce for\nfirst time ever that there is a free-standing due\nprocess right not to be framed. That theory would\nuntether due process from the right to a fair trial,\nwhich is the process a defendant is due before being\ndeprived of liberty.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Why do we need that theory?\nI mean, why not just say what Newman said and the others\nsaid? There is no free-standing right. There is just a\nright not to convict a person with made-up evidence, and\nof course a prosecutor insofar as he's involved in the\nprosecutorial stage is absolutely immune. But if he's\ninvolved in the investigatorial stage of that event,\nwell, then he's not immune absolutely. That's a policy\ndecision. That has nothing to do with free-standing\nrights.\nMR. KATYAL: Respondents' primary submission\nbefore this Court is not that argument. They don't rest\n--\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. Then I'm making\nthat argument.\nMR. KATYAL: Right, and with respect to that\nI think we have several, several responses. The first\nis that this Court has rejected that kind of mere\nforeseeability analysis in the context of section 1983.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Mere foreseeability. You\ncan fill in those boundaries, Toffler, not Toffler, as\nyou wish. But the basic theory isn't a problem because,\nafter all, we're just drawing a line somewhere within\nthe stage of an ongoing tort on the basis of policy, and\nBuckley suggests such a line. I don't see a conceptual\nproblem there, is my problem. Maybe there are practical\nproblems, but I don't see a conceptual one.\nMR. KATYAL: I think there are practical and\nconceptual problems, which is why Buckley reserved\nprecisely this question in footnote 5, and here's the\nbasic policy or conceptual concern. Our point is that\nif a section 1983 defendant is absolutely immune for the\nconstitutional wrong, then you can't read back in time;\na plaintiff can't look back in time and isolate some\nother acts as to which they are nonimmune and thereby --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I interrupt you right\nthere. I would say they are not absolutely immune for\nthe whole constitutional offense. That's the line I'm\ntrying to draw.\nMR. KATYAL: And, Justice Breyer, I'm saying\nto do that requires you to read the due process\nviolation as occurring sometime before the trial, and\nthen we're back to the free-standing rationale and the\nopening up of the due process clause to something this\nCourt has never, ever accepted.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So I agree with you on\nthat. I agree with you. I won't do it. I'll take it\nas one tort. Began before the investigation stage, ends\nwith conviction. One tort. Now, within that tort we\ndraw a line and we draw a line based on policy purposes\nas to when the prosecutor is absolutely or qualifiedly\nimmune, and where that line comes is Buckley,\napproximately. Okay?\nNow, I don't see a conceptual problem with\nthat and I'm having a hard time finding a practical\nproblem.\nMR. KATYAL: The conceptual problem is that\nthis Court has been explicit that section 1983 is not\nthe font of tort law. Rather, you need to isolate a\nconstitutional violation. Here, the constitutional\nviolation is the due process clause. That violation\nbegins, as this Court's decisions in Napue and Pyle say,\nwhen the fabricated evidence is introduced at trial in\norder to secure a conviction.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And how do you get the\npoliceman who has fabricated the evidence?\nMR. KATYAL: Because the policeman\nessentially induces the prosecution at an earlier point\nof time and acts through the innocent agent, the\nprosecutor, that introduction of evidence at trial is\nnot something as to which the policeman has any sort of\nabsolute immunity. And so in Justice Breyer's example\nof a prosecutor introducing evidence, that is something\nas to which the prosecutor is absolutely immune. That\nis where the constitutional violation begins.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: What if a prosecutor knows\nthat it's fabricated evidence? The police officer\nfabricates the evidence and says: Mr. Prosecutor, it's\na very bad man; I fabricated the evidence. The\nprosecutor introduces it. What result there?\nSee, your footnote 6 presumes that the\nprosecutor doesn't know.\nMR. KATYAL: Right.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose he knows?\nMR. KATYAL: And if the prosecutor does\nknow, we don't think that there is a Fifth Amendment due\nprocess violation.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Against the policeman?\nMR. KATYAL: Against -- against the\npoliceman in that circumstance, because the --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Again, the more aggravated\nthe tort, the greater the immunity.\nMR. KATYAL: And I agree that that seems a\nlittle odd --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: You're basically saying\nthat you cannot aid and abet someone who is immune, and\nthat's just not the law.\nMR. KATYAL: No, what I'm saying and what\nthis Court's decisions have said is that absolute\nimmunity doesn't exist to protect bad apples. It\nreflects a larger interest in protecting judicial\ninformation coming into the judicial process. And if\nprosecutors have to worry at trial that every act they\nundertake will somehow open up the door to liability,\nthen they will flinch in the performance of their duties\nand not introduce that evidence. And that is the\ndistinction between the police officer, who is liable,\nand the prosecutor, who is -- who is absolutely immune.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: A prosecutor is not\ngoing to flinch when he suspects evidence is perjured or\nfabricated? Do you really want to send a message to\npolice officers that they should not merely flinch but\nstop if they have reason to believe that evidence is\nfabricated?\nMR. KATYAL: Justice Sotomayor, we\nabsolutely want to send that message. The worry is that\nallegations of wrongdoing, as this Court has recognized\nin Imbler and Van de Kamp, can -- can supersede that.\nAnd just to give you --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Am I right that none of\nthe -- neither of the two prosecutors in this case were\nsanctioned in any way for their conduct?\nMR. KATYAL: I believe that is correct, and\nI also believe that no ethics complaints were ever\nbrought. That is, rather the Respondents went into\nFederal court seeking money damages instead of ethics\nviolations and the like.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But you have no reason\nto dispute the numerous studies we were provided that\nshow that as a matter of routine prosecutors are not\nsanctioned for improper prosecutorial conduct in the\ninvestigatory stage, are you?\nMR. KATYAL: Well, I do think that there is\na debate in the briefs before this Court, including the\nbrief by 12,400 or so prosecutors that takes the reverse\nview. But be that as it may, I think that is a question\nfor the legislature.\nThis Court has said repeatedly that those\nethics and disciplinary violations are -- are a\nsuccessful deterrent, and there is others as well that\nthis Court has pointed to that may be available,\nincluding counsel's liability.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, you can't have it\nboth ways and say this is a policy we should take into\naccount and then when Justice Sotomayor asks you a\nquestion, say: Oh, well, that's for the legislature. I\nmean, you're -- it seems to me you're trying to have it\nboth ways.\nMR. KATYAL: Well, with respect to a cause\nof action and whether the principles of absolute\nimmunity apply to this, I think this Court has already\nrecognized several times that the overriding interest is\nprotecting the judicial process and not letting\ninformation be chilled and not come in.\nTo give you a couple of data points, there\nwere 14.4 million arrests in the year 2006 and 1.1,\napproximately, million felony convictions. Respondents'\ntheory would allow prosecutors in any of those\ncircumstances to be sued for an alleged fabrication of\nevidence, and that's something that could be -- that's\nsomething that's not that hard to envision, since\ncriminal evidence, unlike civil evidence, is messy. It\noften involves cooperation agreements, leniency\nagreements and the like, and for that reason it's very\nnatural, and this Court has recognized that in Imbler,\nfor the defendant in a criminal case to say: Well, I'm\ngoing to blame the prosecutor; they fabricated evidence,\nthey made this story up; and -- and then seek civil\nliability.\nAnd what this Court has said repeatedly is\nthat the societal interest suffers. And that is why\nit's not about, Justice Kennedy, protecting the bad\napple and someone who exacerbates the harm by carrying\nthe fabricated evidence through trial. Rather, what\nthis Court's absolute immunity decisions consistently\nreflect is the principle that when someone is\nintroducing evidence at trial, you don't want to chill\nthem in the performance of their duties in any way\nthrough the rubric of civil liability.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I don't understand why at\nthe time of introducing the evidence, the policy\nconcerns that you've described arise, because we were\ncriticizing what he did before he introduced the\nevidence.\nMR. KATYAL: When -- when the evidence is\nintroduced and it's the prosecutor himself who developed\nthat evidence, maybe through flipping a witness or\nsomething like that, that --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Right, and he would know\nwhether or not it was fabricated.\nMR. KATYAL: Well, he would know whether or\nnot it's fabricated, but the question is whether he\nwould know that he could insulate himself from an\nallegation of wrongdoing. And Respondents' theory,\nwhich allows the due process clause to be some sort of\nfree-standing right, would permit those suits even at\nthe earliest stages of an investigation and permit\nstrike suits even before the criminal process is\nunderway.\nAnd that, I think, is a fundamental point,\nwhich is this Court, no court has, ever really accepted\nthe notion that prosecutors can be liable, that there is\na cause of action for --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But haven't we said that\nduring the investigating stage their conduct is subject\nto different rules than during the trial?\nMR. KATYAL: For purposes of absolute\nimmunity, and we agree with that. So, for example,\nJustice Stevens, in your Fourth Amendment decision in\n1975 on the Seventh Circuit, we agree there is liability\nwhen a prosecutor is, for example, conducting a raid or\nsomething like that. There the constitutional violation\nis complete before the trial, and whatever the\nprosecutor does at trial --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I just don't see the -- I\ndon't to see if I can understand the reason why the time\nin which the violation is completed, namely after the\ntrial, goes to the question of whether there is\nliability for pretrial conduct.\nMR. KATYAL: Well, we think there is no\nliability for pretrial conduct, and so long as you agree\nwith me that the due process clause violation begins\nonly at the trial --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: It was completed at the\ntrial, but it began when the -- the phony investigation\nstarted.\nMR. KATYAL: The -- the text of the due\nprocess clause says the deprivation of life, liberty,\nproperty with -- under due process of law, and due\nprocess under this Court's decisions is what happens at\ntrial, not before.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.\nKatyal.\nMr. Clement.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. CLEMENT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nAs I listen to Petitioners, I hear two\narguments to why there ought to be liability for the\nprosecutor -- rather, for the police officer and not the\nprosecutor, and both of those are arguments this Court\nhas already heard and rejected.\nOn the immunity issue, the argument\nPetitioners make seems to distill to the proposition\nthat as long as you're suing a prosecutor for injuries\ninflicted at trial, the prosecutor ought to have\nabsolute immunity.\nNow, that's not a crazy theory of immunity.\nIt's exactly the theory of immunity that the Seventh\nCircuit adopted in the Buckley decision and this Court\nreversed, unanimously as to the press conference and by\na majority opinion with respect to pretrial\ninvestigatory conduct involving fabrication. If that\nsounds familiar, it should. That's the conduct that's\nat issue here.\nSo the absolute immunity issue in this case\nwas decided in Buckley. Now --\nJUSTICE ALITO: When the issue, when the --\nthe claim is based on the evaluation of the truthfulness\nof a witness who eventually testifies at trial, where's\nthe line to be drawn between the investigative stage and\nthe prosecutorial stage?\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, I think, Justice Alito,\nthe place to draw the line is the place this Court drew\nthe line in Buckley, which is probable cause. And\nbefore probable cause, when prosecutors are engaging in\ninvestigatory functions, I don't think we want them\nshaping the witness for trial. I think we want them\ntrying to figure out who actually committed this crime\nand who would we have probable cause to perhaps initiate\nprocess against.\nJUSTICE ALITO: What concerns me about your\nargument is the -- is a real fear that it will\neviscerate Imbler. Now, maybe you can convince me that\nit will not have that effect, but as the Solicitor\nGeneral argued at the end of his argument, a very -- in\nthe typical criminal case, the witnesses are not\nJohn Q. Public with -- who have never engaged in any\nwrongful activity.\nA typical witness is -- well, let's take the\ncase of the prosecution of a -- a white -- of the CEO of\na huge corporation for insider trading or some other\nwhite-collar violation. And the chief witness against\nthis person is, let's say, the CFO of this company, who\nwhen initially questioned by law enforcement officials\nand investigatory officials, made -- made statements\ndenying any participation in any wrongdoing, but\neventually changed his story and testifies against the\nCEO at trial in exchange for consideration in a plea\ndeal.\nNow, your argument, in a case like that --\nor you could change the facts, make it an organized\ncrime case, make it a prosecution of a drug kingpin\nwho's testifying -- the witness against him is a\nlower-ranking person in the organization who has a\ncriminal record, maybe has previously committed perjury,\nhas made numerous false statements, is subject to\nimpeachment. In all of those cases a claim could be\nbrought against the prosecutor.\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, Justice Alito, let me\ntry to answer it this way, which is you mentioned both\norganized crime cases and insider trading cases. Well,\nI think if there is any circuit in which those kind of\nclaims are going to be brought it's probably the Second\nCircuit. The Second Circuit has lived with this rule\nsince the year 2000 and the Zahrey decision that's\nalready been mentioned. There has not been a floodgate\nopening, there's not been a torrent of these claims.\nThere's been a trickle. They remain very hard to\nallege, and the allegations here --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, I mean, that might be\ntrue as an empirical matter, but I don't understand why\nit would be hard to allege.\nMR. CLEMENT: What would you --\nJUSTICE ALITO: What would you have to\nallege to get by Iqbal or to get by summary judgment?\nYou allege that the testimony at trial was false and\nthat the prosecutor knew that it was false. And in\nsupport of that you have prior inconsistent statements\nby the witness, and you may have the evidence that was\nintroduced by the defense at trial that is inconsistent\nwith that. You have a triable issue.\nMR. CLEMENT: I don't --\nJUSTICE ALITO: You certainly get by\n12(b)(6).\nMR. CLEMENT: As I hear your hypothetical, I\ndon't think so, because the thing that's missing is the\nallegation that the prosecutors fabricated that\nevidence. This isn't a case about coaching a witness.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but what --\nwhat if there's an acquittal? Then you have at least a\njury not believing the evidence, and that also is strong\nsupport for at least supporting an allegation. He\nfabricated it; nobody believed it when it was presented\nat trial.\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, two things, Your Honor.\nOne is obviously without the fabrication allegations\nthat take place during the investigatory stage, you\nwould be protected by Imbler.\nNow, in the acquittal situations, this Court\ndoesn't have a case directly on point. But if I read\nthe Hartman decision, for example, Hartman v. Moore,\nand apply it to this context, I assume that in the\ncontext of an acquittal if you tried to bring a claim\nlike this, this Court would interpret through the common\nlaw the -- a malicious prosecution type element that you\nwould have to satisfy.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Why is it difficult to\nallege fabrication? The -- the allegation is that at\npoint A this witness denied that the defendant did\nanything wrong, and then at point B the defendant told\nan entirely different story after having received from\nthe government a plea deal that promises no prosecution\nand entry into the witness protection program or\nsomething like that. That certainly is sufficient\nevidence to -- of fabrication, is it not?\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, Justice Alito, let me\nsay this. First of all, you are going to have to\npinpoint those kind of allegations pre-probable cause,\nwhich is not going to be the case in a lot of cases.\nSecond of all, I mean, this Court --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't know what you mean\nby that.\nMR. CLEMENT: In -- in the typical case,\nif -- if the witness perhaps in the first instance comes\nup with one testimony and later comes up in -- with a\ndifferent story later, the question for purposes of\nabsolute immunity is going to be, did all of the conduct\nthat you're alleging, the fabrication, did all of it\ntake place before probable cause attached? And in a lot\nof cases prosecutors don't even get involved until after\nprobable cause, until after there have been arrests,\nsomething like that. And in those cases --\nJUSTICE ALITO: That's an entirely false\npicture of the way any sophisticated prosecution is\nhandled today, completely false. You want -- the\nprosecutor may not know whether there's probable cause\nuntil the prosecutor interviews the witness.\nMR. CLEMENT: And, again --\nJUSTICE ALITO: And so then you have to go\nback and determine whether there was -- if there wasn't\nprobable cause before the interview, then there is\nliability. But if there was probable cause before the\ninterview, then there isn't liability.\nMR. CLEMENT: I think if I understand your\nhypothetical, the question would actually be whether\nthere was probable cause before the re-interview,\nbecause if at the point --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Before the re-interview,\nbecause the prosecutor doesn't want to take the case to\nthe grand jury before looking this witness in the eye\nand seeing whether this -- this guy who's got a lot of\nimpeachment baggage is -- is a -- is a credible witness.\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, two things, Justice\nAlito. First of all, if you have all -- if you had the\ninterview and the re-interview before probable cause and\nyou have the allegations that it was done for the avowed\npurpose of depriving the person of their liberty, then\nyou would, I think, apply Iqbal, and you would ask under\nall the circumstances of that case whether it's a\nplausible allegation.\nAnd this Court is obviously in a better\nposition than I am to say how it would apply Iqbal in\nthose kind of cases. But what I can tell you is that\nfor nearly a decade the Second Circuit has had this\nrule. Now, the Second Circuit is the circuit that\nbrought you Iqbal. So for that same decade they did not\nhave the rule of Iqbal, and yet they didn't have a\ntorrent of these claims.\nSo, I think going forward, if you recognize\nthese claims --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How -- how do you --\nI mean, we hear that type of argument every time,\nbecause there is usually a circuit conflict here, and\nyou look at one circuit and say the world hasn't fallen.\nBut you have no idea how many of these claims are\nasserted and dismissed at an early stage or -- or\nwhatever.\nYou're saying, what, that there haven't been\nmany Second Circuit opinions on this question?\nMR. CLEMENT: I think if you look at\nreported, both unpublished and published Second Circuit\ndecisions at the district court level and the court of\nappeals level, you would find very few cases that even\ncite Zahrey. I think it's something like maybe 17 I\nthink is what we found.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you think there\nwill be -- do you think there will be more if we agree\nwith your theory?\nMR. CLEMENT: In the Second Circuit? I\ndon't think so. I think it will be the same number in\nthe Second Circuit.\nNow, in the Seventh Circuit that has lived\nwith the Buckley remand rule, I suppose there will now\nbe a couple of dozen cases there. But I do think it's\nrevealing that the circuit that has certainly the kind\nof cases that Justice Alito was dealing with, has not\nhad a flood of these cases. As far as I'm aware, the\nU.S. attorney's offices in that circuit have not had to\nrework the way they do business in those circuits, and I\ndo think that these are claims that are going to be\ndifficult to allege.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but it's also\nyou don't really know, right? In other words, we're\nconcerned about the chilling effect on the prosecutors.\nWe don't know what the impact of the Second Circuit's\ndecision has been on the prosecutors.\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, Your Honor, we don't\nknow for sure. We don't know either way, because either\nway this Court is going to adopt a clear rule. What I\ncan say is at least I'm pointing to empirical evidence\nin a circuit that has lived with this rule for a decade.\nThat seems to me a better empirical basis to go on than\nabsolutely nothing.\nBut let me give you another example, which\nis this Court a couple of years ago decided a decision\ncalled Hartman v. Moore. Hartman v. Moore sort of\nrecognized that there was a tort called, I think,\nretaliatory inducement to prosecute.\nNow, in footnote 8 this Court recognized\nthat actually you could sue a prosecutor for retaliatory\ninducement to prosecute if you focused on the\ninvestigatory activities. That's exactly the same basic\ntheory we have here, which is you focus on the\ninvestigatory activities of a prosecutor and say that\nthere is a valid 1983 claim.\nNow, again, to my knowledge there have not\nbeen a flood of Hartman claims brought against\nprosecutors. I think --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What -- what is the\nbasis for the 1983 claim without the submission at\ntrial?\nMR. CLEMENT: Without the submission at\ntrial -- I mean, it would depend, I suppose, on the\ncircumstances. You could have, certainly, a Fourth\nAmendment --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, you know I'm\nnot talking about the Fourth Amendment violation, which\nis complete whether there's a trial or not.\nMR. CLEMENT: Well -- and then maybe I just\nneed a concrete hypothetical. Let's say -- let's say --\nlet me -- let me provide one. Suppose that there was\nthis -- the prosecutor put on this fabricated evidence\nat trial, and then the -- the whole case sort of\nunraveled because the system actually worked the way\nit's supposed to. On cross-examination the witness\ncracked and it became clear that there was this\nconspiracy to use perjured evidence.\nNow, at that point -- I mean, I suppose the\ngovernment's theory would be because you never deprived\nthe person of their liberty, the knowing use by the\nprosecutor of perjured testimony at trial does not\nviolate the due process clause.\nBut I hope that's not the rule. I mean, I\nhope that in a Mooney case, if you bring the -- make a\nMooney violation against somebody who is actually\nguilty, so you knowingly use perjured testimony against\nsomebody that's -- that's guilty, so if you did a\nharmless error analysis, you would say, well, the use of\nthe perjured testimony really didn't deprive the person\nof their liberty because they were otherwise --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: What's -- what's -- what's\nyour best authority for the proposition that there's\nliability in the case the Chief Justice put? What's\nyour best case?\nMR. CLEMENT: I -- I -- I'm not sure I have\na best case for that, Justice Kennedy. I mean, let\nme -- let me give you what I think is a very good case\nthat illustrates a similar principle, but I -- I will --\nI will be candid that I think this is an extrapolation\nfrom Mooney, but a very sort of clear extrapolation from\nMooney.\nMy best case in some ways I think is Malley,\nbecause their proposition seems to be that -- this is\nthe other argument you have heard and rejected -- is\nthat if there's an absolutely immune act in the causal\nchain, then that somehow means that there is no\nviolation.\nThink about who was sued in the Malley. It\nwas the police officers. What did the police officers\ndo? They procured an invalid arrest warrant. Now, did\ntheir actions independent of the absolute immune act of\nthe magistrate injure the plaintiffs? No. Without the\nmagistrate issuing the warrant, there was no arrest,\nthere's no search, there's no injury to the plaintiffs.\nSo we allow in our system somebody to bring\na constitutional tort claim, even though there's an\nabsolutely immune act in the causal chain.\nThe lower court in Malley actually accepted\nexactly this argument, that if you have any absolutely\nimmune act in the causal chain that breaks it off. This\nCourt rejected it and was frankly fairly dismissive,\ndismissed it in the footnote, footnote 7 of the opinion.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: You will have to refresh\nmy memory. Wasn't that a Fourth Amendment violation\nultimately?\nMR. CLEMENT: It was a Fourth Amendment\nviolation.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So that -- so that's\nnot --\nMR. CLEMENT: No, I think it illustrates the\nprinciple, which is you don't have to have a completed\nconstitutional violation in your 1983 action. I mean,\nMalley illustrates that principle, but so does the text\nof -- of section 1983, frankly. Section 1983 doesn't\nforce you to have a completed constitutional violation.\nIt provides liability if you subject someone to a\nconstitutional violation or cause them to be subjected\nto a constitutional violation.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The difference here is that\nthe -- the absolutely immune act which follows the --\nthe unlawful act is -- is an absolutely immune act by\nthe very actor who performed the earlier act that --\nthat you say induces liability. And so the argument is,\nwhat's the use of giving him liability later on if -- if\nyou can simply drag him into litigation by -- by\nalleging that he at an earlier stage committed a\nviolation?\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, the --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's the difference. I\nmean, to me that's the -- the crux of this, that it is\nthe same actor who has absolute liability whom you're\ntrying to get on the basis of -- of earlier action.\nMR. CLEMENT: Well --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: That's the reason the rule\nseems perverse.\nMR. CLEMENT: What's that?\nJUSTICE STEVENS: That's the very reason the\nrule they're arguing for seems perverse.\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, I would ask -- I would\nask both of you to go back and read two things, and I\nwould particularly like Justice Scalia to go back and\nread your separate opinion in Burns. Because in Burns\nyou confronted just this issue. You conceptualized what\nhappens at the warrant stage as a variant of malicious\nprosecution and you said: Now, could a prosecutor, sort\nof as kind of a complaining witness in that context,\nprocure a warrant that they were subsequently involved\nin? And you said: I don't see any reason why not. I\nthink you got it right there.\nThe other thing I would ask you to look at\nis footnote 8 of the Hartman v. Moore decision, because\nthere you were dealing with a retaliatory prosecution\nclaim. Now, the Court's opinion was very careful to\nsay, you know, it's really not a retaliation -- a\nretaliatory prosecution claim; what it is is a\nretaliatory inducement to prosecute case.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If you cannot rely\non anything that goes on at the trial to establish the\ndue process violation, what do you rely on to establish\nthe violation?\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, Mr. Chief Justice --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I guess the question\nis where is it complete, or do you say it doesn't have\nto be a complete violation?\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, I guess what I would do,\nMr. Chief Justice, is try to take issue with your\npremise, which is that we can't advert to the absolute\nimmune act at all. Of course we can. I mean, this\nisn't --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, let's say that\nyou -- let's say that you can't because we read Imbler\nas conferring absolute immunity on what goes on at the\ntrial. And if you can't advert to that, you don't have\na constitutional violation, right?\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, I would still say we do,\nbut please let me try to take one more crack at the\npremise, which is Imbler is not a use immunity case and\nthis Court has rejected the proposition that just\nbecause you're absolutely immune for an act there's no\nevidentiary use of that in going after conduct that was\nearlier in the causal chain.\nThis Court specifically confronted that in a\ncase called Dennis v. Sparks that was with, you know,\nthe granddaddy of them all, judicial immunity, and said\neven the judge's actions could be proved up as part of a\ntort action. So there is no use immunity for --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Against -- against\nthe judge?\nMR. CLEMENT: It wasn't against the judge,\nbut I -- but with all due respect, I don't think that\nmatters. And I also think --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's the\ndistinction here in this case, isn't it?\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, but -- but it's a\ndistinction without a difference. It's a distinction\nthis Court confronted in -- in Hartman in footnote 8.\nIt's a distinction Justice Scalia confronted. And also,\nthe consequences of accepting their view is to really\nturn all of your absolute immunity cases into a fool's\nerrand.\nI mean, think about Kalina. I mean, the\nsupporting affidavit wasn't the thing that inflicted\ninjury. Now, the thing that inflicted injury were the\ntwo documents that the supporting affidavit supported,\nthe warrant and the information. Now, it would have\nmade no sense for this Court to say, well, there is only\nqualified immunity for the supporting affidavit, so\nlet's send this back to the lower court, if you couldn't\neven get into evidence the fact that there was an\ninformation or a warrant.\nSo too in the Malley case, of course you\ncan use -- now it's a different -- it's a different\nperson. In Kalina -- Kalina, it's the same person.\nOr take a look at Burns, for example. In\nBurns the prosecutor's advice to the police officer,\nthat's not what injured the plaintiff in that case. It\nwas the warrant that was eventually procured.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: In terms of the\nchilling impact on the prosecutor, what difference does\nit make whether it's at trial or pretrial for use at\ntrial?\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, I think it makes all the\ndifference in the world in the sense that if -- if they\nknow that everything they do at trial is going to be\nprotected, those functions, which is the basis of this\nCourt's functional approach to absolute immunity, are\ngoing to be protected. Now, if they're going to be --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But it won't be protected.\nThey won't have that assurance, because when they --\nwhen they produce evidence at trial, oh, yeah, I guess\nthe production at trial will be protected, but you're --\nyou're telling us that they can go back and say, ah, but\nyou got that evidence in a bad manner, and therefore we\ncan sue you, not for introducing it at trial, but for\nfabricating it before trial.\nI -- I don't see that there is much of a\ndifference as far as the deterrent effect upon the\nprosecutor is concerned.\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, I think there is going\nto be an effect on the deterrent effect on the\nprosecutor pretrial, which is they will be procured. I\nmean, think about the contrary incentive you're --\nyou're creating. Suppose you're a prosecutor. You've\nparticipated in the misconduct before trial. You now\nhave the decision to make: Okay, I was -- I was\ncomplicit in the fabrication of this perjured evidence;\nshould I put it on into evidence? Well, let's see. If\nI don't put it on into evidence and I come clean now,\nI'm actually liable for the arrest and all the pretrial\ndetention. If I actually introduce it into evidence\nnow, I'm scot-free.\nJUSTICE BREYER: There's a different\ntendency, which I would say this is a slight fluke, what\nyou're describing. I'm more worried about what Justice\nAlito brought up, that, other things being equal, I\nthink it's probably a good thing to get prosecutors\ninvolved in the questioning process. That -- that has a\nkind of check on the police.\nAnd the concern I'd have is that the --this\nwill discourage the prosecutors from becoming involved\nin the witness -- witness questioning process, at least\nnot before the police are well on the way. And that is\na very negative incentive, I would think.\nSo what is your most pro-prosecutorial rule\nthat you could live with that will in fact minimize the\nrisk of that kind of disincentive? Now, are you just\ngoing to say, well, Buckley?\nMR. CLEMENT: Well --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Or is there something -- I\nmean, I can see Buckley with the, you know, probable\ncause. It turns on and off as you're talking to the\nwitness. First what he says, you have the probable\ncause; then you don't; then you do; then you don't. I\nmean, I -- I'm not -- I just want you to give your best\nthought to this problem and tell me what is the most\nsafe rule that will allow you to win your case?\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, Justice Breyer, I mean,\nI would say that there is no reason for this Court to\ndisturb the line it drew in Buckley. Now I could,\nbecause of this case --\nJUSTICE BREYER: We have amicus briefs here\nthat give us a lot of reason. They say -- they say it's\nvery discouraging to, you know, AUSAs or DAs going in\nand talking to the witnesses with the police.\nMR. CLEMENT: Well --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And they say they do it in\nChicago, I think. In other places, they do it a lot.\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, I mean, another thing\npresumably, Justice Breyer, you want to encourage is\nhaving the police officers come to the prosecutors and\nget legal advice about what they're doing. And this\nCourt squarely confronted that question in Burns and\nsaid the advice-giving function, which is a function\nonly a prosecutor, only a lawyer anyways, can perform --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, could you answer\nJustice Breyer's question, which I -- I think raises a\n-- a critical point in terms of Justice Alito's examples\nof talking to the witness. Why isn't that at some\npoint -- I think in Buckley, the \"judicial phase.\" Why\nis this the judicial phase?\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, Justice Kennedy, let me\nrespond. Let me say why I don't think I can really\nimprove on the probable cause line. I mean, in this\ncase, the police officers and the prosecutors were\ninvolved in this from the get-go.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: No, but probable cause\ndoesn't work because you have -- you have probable cause\nonce you fabricate the evidence.\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, I think --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: That's circular.\nMR. CLEMENT: No, I don't think so. I think\nfor the purposes of evaluating when there's probable\ncause, you have to eliminate the fabricated evidence,\nand so I think that you evaluate probable cause, but\nhere's why I think it's the right line, Because think\nabout the prosecutor's special function.\nIf you don't have probable cause to arrest\nany individual for a crime, then the function the police\nofficers ought to be performing is one of a\ntruth-seeking function and that is a classic police\ninvestigatory function.\nNow, the moment they have probable cause,\nI'm willing to listen to the argument that at that point\nthey shift roles, and at that point they're not looking\nat the evidence the way the police officer is, just to\nfind out whodunit; but they're looking at it to say,\nwell I have a job to do, I have to put a case on, and,\nyou know, this person says what they say, and, you know,\nthere's some problems with that and the jury's not going\nto believe that, so let me talk to him some more.\nThat's why I think the probable cause line\nis not only administrable, but it makes sense in this\ncontext.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose the prosecutor\nisn't sure there's probable cause and he calls -- calls\nin the accountant, the CFO, and really doesn't begin to\nbelieve his story, so he starts probing and finally he\ngets the CFO to change his story with the plea -- plea\nbargain. Would that be part of the judicial process?\nOr is that still clearly investigatory?\nMR. CLEMENT: I think at the point -- if the\ninterview begins and he doesn't think he has probable\ncause, I think that that --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, he's trying to find\nout. That's what --\nMR. CLEMENT: Of course he is trying to find\nout. But he's -- but he's not trying to find out if\nthere's probable cause necessarily to identify a\nparticular suspect. What he's trying to do, is there\nprobable cause to arrest anyone? And that's exactly the\nquestion a police officer asks every single day.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, also, you're making\nme more worried because I think, if 85 percent of all\nthe defendants -- or 90 percent plead guilty, it might\nbe a highly desirable thing to get prosecutors involved\nin the truth-discovering process, I mean, so that they\ndon't just see themselves as the job of -- well, we're\ngoing to take somebody, put them in jail.\nMaybe -- maybe that's a reason for pushing\nit back a little bit, this -- this line.\nMR. CLEMENT: Well -- you know, I'm not sure\nwhat the logical place to push it back any further is,\nand I think -- you know --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Where have you got it now?\nYou've got it as when there is probable cause for\nbelieving that someone has committed a crime?\nMR. CLEMENT: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Someone? So it's\nsomeone -- needn't be the particular person they\neventually indict?\nMR. CLEMENT: That's right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Uh-huh.\nMR. CLEMENT: And let me say this, Justice\nBreyer, I mean, I know you don't want to talk about\nBurns, but I'd like to, just for a second, because I\nthink it's a very similar policy concern.\nAs a policy matter, sure, we want\nprosecutors to get -- to give advice to police officers,\nbut qualified immunity is not insignificant protection,\nand think about that, I mean, the incentives you're\ncreating for the same anomaly that the Court recognized\nin Buckley. The incentive would really --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, we thought it\nwas -- I'm sorry. Why don't you finish your answer?\nMR. CLEMENT: I just wanted to say the\nincentive would really be perverse. Under Burns, if the\npolice -- if the police officer comes to the prosecutor\nand says -- you know, we want to fabricate evidence to\nframe it, can we do it? And the prosecutor says, yes,\nyou can do that, go ahead; there's qualified immunity.\nNow, if the prosecutor says, go ahead and\nlet me help, there would somehow be absolute immunity.\nI mean, that is really an anomalous result, that it's\nthe n anomaly that caused this Court in Buckley to draw\nthe line at probable cause.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I was going to\nsuggest in response to your point that -- you know,\nqualified immunity is really significant. Of course, it\nis, but we've recognized, in a number of contexts, in\nthe judicial area, for example, that it's -- it's not\nenough.\nWe have also recognized that in the\nprosecutorial area, and trying to draw the line where\nyou do -- I think this was one of the points Justice\nAlito was making, is that, sometimes, you're\ninvestigating and preparing your case at the same time.\nYou don't just sit back and say, I'm -- I'm\njust going to look and see what I can find. You have\nparticular areas. The prosecution requires you to show\nfour things, So you are looking at those four things.\nYou are preparing your case, and you're investigating.\nMR. CLEMENT: And, again, the Court\naddressed exactly this Court in the -- exactly that\nissue in the Buckley decision and said, sure -- you\nknow, from -- with the benefit of hindsight, you can\nsort of retrospectively look and make anything in the\ninvestigatory stage part of -- and part and parcel of\nthe prosecution.\nAnd I don't think that was something that\nthis Court saw as a reason not to draw a clean line\nthat's consistent with the functional approach. It's\nconsistent, not just with Buckley, but with Burns and\nwith Kalina and with a whole host of this Court's\ndecisions.\nJUSTICE ALITO: In -- in answer to Justice\nBreyer's question, would -- would it be a -- would it be\npractical and conceptually correct to draw the line at\nthe stage at which the prosecutor is interviewing\nwitnesses to evaluate credibility?\nSo, at that stage, the prosecutorial\nfunction has begun and absolute immunity would kick in.\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, if I could add, I mean,\nI suppose I might be able --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Not on whether there is\nprobable cause because probable cause is -- is\nevanescent. It comes, and it goes. It is -- it is --\nit is inextricably intertwined with what the prosecutor\nis doing in questioning the witness.\nMR. CLEMENT: And let me say this: If I\ncould add a couple of words, I think we could probably\nlive with that line, which is, if the prosecutor is\ninterviewing those witnesses with an eye towards\ncredibility for use at trial, I mean, that's a line\nthat, I think, would be, I think, probably pretty\nconsistent with probable cause, but something that we\ncould live with, but --\nJUSTICE ALITO: But with a line toward\ninvestigating credibility for use at a trial, which\nis -- which is, at that point, foreordained, but, if the\nevaluation is being done for the purpose of determining\nwhether there should be a trial, then, no. That's your\nanswer?\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, I mean, I worry that\nwords are being put in my mouth. I would say that, if\nthe prosecutor is interviewing the witness for the\npurpose of judging their credibility at trial, then\nthat's something for which you may be able to sort of\ntweak the line on Buckley and say that's covered.\nI actually think it won't make any\ndifference because I think that should only be happening\nafter probable cause. If I could --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, your approach,\nthen, encourages prosecutors to be trigger happy.\nThey're prosecuting right now because they know, then,\nthat everything else, they have absolute immunity, so --\nyou know, shoot first and ask questions later.\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, shoot first -- you mean\ngo to an impartial magistrate and try to get somebody\narrested or --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, just begin the\nformulation. I'm -- I'm starting to prosecute this\nperson, rather than saying, let's look, let's\ninvestigate, let's interview, and then decide who we're\ngoing to prosecute.\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, I suppose --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: In Justice Alito's\nhypothetical, you've got a CFO, you can -- you know,\nyou've probably got probable cause to go after him as\nwell, but you want to begin interviewing him, to see if\nhe's going to flip in your case against the CEO.\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, if you have probable\ncause, then I think you're on the other side of the\nBuckley line, and that's an objective determination, and\nI think --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you've got --\nyou've got to make that decision early in the process,\nrather than later.\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, I think it's -- I'm not\nsure it's a decision you have to make. I think it's\nactually something that would be evaluated objectively\nafter the fact, and I think the way that this Court\nshould approach this case is neither of the parties\nbefore you have asked this Court to overturn Buckley.\nI wouldn't do it under those circumstances,\nbut, of course, it's worth adding that, if you were\ngoing to overturn Buckley, then the place to probably\nstart would be to go back to first principles, and if\nyou're going to go back to first principles, then what\nyou're going to find is that there was no common law\nsupport at all for absolute immunity.\nAnd I wouldn't think that this Court was\nparticularly interested in coming up with implied\nimmunities that aren't in the statute and had no basis\nat the common law, and that's why I think some of the\nJustices that have looked at this as an original matter\nhave tended to be quite reluctant in recognizing\nabsolute immunity because it lacks support in the text\nand it lacks support at the common law.\nSo we're -- we're happy with the lines that\nthis Court has already drawn. But if the Court's going\nto go back to first principles, well, let's go back to\nfirst principles and look at -- the at the statute\nCongress passed in 1871.\nThat statute did not provide any immunities,\nand I do think, as we say in the brief, this is a case\nwhere it's important not to lose the forest for the\ntrees because this is a statute was passed -- passed in\n1871. This is one of the great civil rights statutes.\nIs it really plausible to think that the\nCongress that passed this statute didn't want to provide\na remedy in the circumstances before the Court today? I\nthink it's clear, from this Court's cases -- there may\nnot be a case that lines up all the dots exactly, but I\nthink it's clear, from this Court's cases, that the\npolice officer that engages in this misconduct has\ncommitted a grave, grave constitutional violation and\nought to be liable.\nI think the prosecutor who engages in the\npretrial misconduct and then doesn't participate in the\ntrial is just as liable as that police officer, and I\ncan't think of a single reason why the only reason a\nprosecutor would get absolute immunity is, if they not\nonly participated in the pretrial misconduct, but\ncompleted the scheme by committing further misconduct at\ntrial.\nFor all those reasons, we think the Court\nshould affirm. Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Clement.\nMr. Sanders, you have five -- five minutes\nremaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN SANDERS\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. SANDERS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nWe have four main points.\nBeginning with the Second Circuit's decision\nin Zahrey and subsequent cases in the Second Circuit,\nhave significantly cut back on the meaning of Zahrey.\nThe Wray decision, which we discussed in our reply\nbrief, the Gonzalez decision, which we discussed in our\nopening brief, have not allowed for this kind of\ncontinuous liability for a prosecutor.\nThey have made very clear, particularly the\nGonzalez decision, that when it is a prosecutor's\nactions before a judge advocating on behalf of the\nState, that are responsible for a deprivation of\nliberty, in that situation, absolute immunity applies.\nI think it's important to understand the\nconsequences --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What -- what does that\nprove? What does that prove? I don't understand why\nyou bring that up because it shows that the fact that\nthere aren't many cases, only 17 in the -- in the Second\nCircuit, it doesn't mean anything because the Second\nCircuit is not applying as liberal a rule as your\nopponent suggests.\nIs that --\nMR. SANDERS: No, Your Honor. I think it's\nto -- I think it's to say that the Zahrey decision has\nnot had the kind of impact and has not been applied in a\nway that respondents are asking for it to be applied.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes. That's -- that's just\nwhat I said, and, therefore -- and had it been applied\nthat way, there would have been more than 17 cases in\nthe Second Circuit.\nMR. SANDERS: I'm not sure I understand the\nquestion.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Okay.\nMR. SANDERS: The -- I think it's important\nto understand the consequences of affirming the courts\nbelow, either on the basis of the Zahrey theory or on\nthe freestanding due process theory offered by\nrespondents.\nIt would work a radical change in the law of\nimmunity because it would mean that far more wrongful\nconviction claims against prosecutors would go forward\nunder only qualified immunity.\nThat is the inevitable consequence of\naffirming the courts below in this case. These cases\nare not difficult, as Justice Alito said, to plead,\nparticularly because, in most of these sorts of cases,\nmost of the discovery will have been done during the\npost-conviction review process.\nAnd so there will be plenty of -- plenty of\ngrounds for a plaintiff to allege a plausible violation\nduring the investigative process and survive a motion to\ndismiss or survive summary judgment, even if,\nultimately, that comes to nothing, the consequence would\nbe to hold prosecutors to inconsistent standards of\nliability, qualified immunity or absolute immunity,\nbased simply on the allegations in a complaint,\nsomething this Court has specifically said is -- is not\nappropriate and should not be --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I want, before you're\nfinished, to get a clear picture of your view of the\ndimensions of the claim because you rely heavily on the\ntrial part. Everything proceeds as it was alleged to\nhave proceeded in this case, except that just before the\ntrial begins, Harris comes forward and said it was all a\npack of lies, and so there is no trial.\nMR. SANDERS: Uh-huh.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Is anyone in this picture\nliable? The defendants have been incarcerated for some\ntime, but when it blows up, they're let out. No trial,\nbut everything else, the same.\nMR. SANDERS: Your Honor, I believe there\nwould be no due process liability. There might be two\nindependent grounds for liability under some Fourth\nAmendment malicious prosecution theory, which is not at\nissue in this case, and possibly under State law\nremedies, as Justice Kennedy and Justice Thomas\nindicated in their concurrence in Albright, we do not go\nto the Federal constitution's Due Process Clause unless\nwe're sure that the plaintiffs have exhausted their\npossible remedies under State law. In this case, Iowa\nState law provides a cause of action for malicious\nprosecution.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You said -- I think your\nposition is that due process begins when trial is\nunderway, and before that due process doesn't enter the\npicture?\nMR. SANDERS: Your Honor, I believe that\nthis Court's decisions make clear that due process\napplies to the judicial process; that is, the filing of\ncharges and the later conduct of the prosecuting --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, but what about the\npretrial detention? Isn't that a deprivation of\nliberty?\nMR. SANDERS: Your Honor, it would be, but\nthat would be Fourth Amendment territory.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Why would it be Fourth\nAmendment? Why isn't it Fourteenth Amendment right on\nthe nose? They're deprived of liberty without due\nprocess of law.\nMR. SANDERS: Your Honor, this Court --\nseven justices in this Court's decision in Albright\nagreed that there was no due process cause of action for\nthe wrongful institution of criminal proceedings, that\nin that case there may be some sort of Fourth Amendment\nclaim. There may be some sort of State law claim under\nParrot v. Taylor, but I have not --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But that case talked about\nthe institution of prosecution, not the deprivation of\nliberty during pretrial detention, which is a different\nmatter.\nMR. SANDERS: Your Honor, I believe the\nCourt's Fourth Amendment jurisprudence would still\nindicate that that is a concern of the Fourth Amendment,\nnot the Due Process Clause, and that pursuant to Paul v.\nDavis and Parrot v. Taylor, there may indeed be some\nsort of State law cause of action for defamation or loss\nof status, but that there is no support for a Federal\ndue process claim.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel.\n"
