        "content": "(10:04 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument\nthis morning in Case 06-984, Medellin v. Texas.\nMr. Donovan.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD F. DONOVAN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. DONOVAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe President and the Senate entered into\nthree treaties, the Optional Protocol, the UN Charter,\nand the ICJ Statute, by which the United States agreed\nthat it would comply with the ICJ's decision in any case\nto which it was a party. We now have such a decision,\nand the President of the United States has determined\nthat the United States should comply.\nTexas, however, tells this Court that it\nshould tell the world that the framers left us a\nConstitution in which neither this Court nor the\nPresident nor maybe even Congress could ensure that the\nUnited States kept the promise that its elected\nrepresentatives made to its treaty partners. Texas's\nposition is directly contrary to the constitutional\ndesign.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's not such an\noutrageous proposition. You'd certainly acknowledge\nthat the President and the Senate could not enter into a\ntreaty that required the States to do something that was\nunconstitutional.\nMR. DONOVAN: Yes. The Constitution --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So there would be the\nsituation that presents the shocking situation you've\njust described. There is a treaty, but nonetheless it\ncannot be enforced domestically.\nMR. DONOVAN: There would be constitutional\n-- there might be affirmative constitutional constraints\non the enforcement of a treaty, but there are none here.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Who would enforce\nthose constraints? The thing that concerns me about\nyour position is that it seems to leave no role for this\nCourt in interpreting treaties as a matter of Federal\nlaw.\nSuppose, for example, that the International\nCourt of Justice determined in this case its judgment\nwas the same, but they added: As a matter of\ndeterrence, we think the officers who failed to give\nconsular warning should each be sentenced to 5 years in\njail. That's the ICJ determination. Would this Court\nhave a role in reviewing that judgment?\nMR. DONOVAN: This Court would have a role\nin reviewing that judgment, and here's -- here's the\nquestion. This Court has an obligation, has the\nauthority, to say what the law is. In this case the\nobligation is, in fact, to comply with the judgment,\nitself.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Even if we determine\n--\nMR. DONOVAN: And if that obligation --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Even if we\ndetermine, even if we determine that that judgment is\nbased on a legal error?\nMR. DONOVAN: The question -- that's the\nbasis of submitting a dispute to a third-party\ndispute-resolution mechanism, yes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So if the ICJ\ndetermined that the officers should each go to jail for\n5 years, we would have no basis for reviewing that\njudgment?\nMR. DONOVAN: Wel, that would be -- well,\nthat would be a -- raise a separate obstacle. If I may\nanswer the questions in turn, first --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Does the ICJ ever issue a\njudgment of that character? It issues a judgment\nbetween two nations, two or more nations, and it is\ninstructs the United States to do something. I'm not\naware of any -- any decision of the ICJ that says what a\nsentence should be for a particular individual.\nMR. DONOVAN: That is correct. The ICJ\ndecides disputes between nations, but those disputes may\ninvolve the nations' obligation as to specific\nindividuals. In this case --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I'm still interested\nin the answer to the Chief Justice's hypothetical.\nMR. DONOVAN: Well, as I say, there are two\n--\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose the court acts\nbeyond, clearly beyond, its jurisdiction?\nMR. DONOVAN: Well, it's -- with respect,\nthere's no suggestion here that the court has acted\nbeyond its jurisdiction. Indeed, the President has\ndetermined otherwise.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Could you answer the\nhypothetical, please.\nMR. DONOVAN: But if the court, itself -- if\nthe ICJ, itself, made a determination as to a dispute\nthat is within its jurisdiction and that imposes an\nobligation that is within this Court's provenance to\nenforce, that is, that it determines the rights\nattributable -- enforceable within a court of justice,\nthis Court would be enforcing the obligation to comply.\nIt wouldn't -- the fact that it diverged\nfrom the court's own interpretation, for example, here\nin Sanchez-Llamas, is not relevant to the treaty\nobligation that this Court is exercising --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry. I'm\nstill looking for an answer to the hypothetical. What\nwould be the basis for this Court's reviewing the ICJ's\ndetermination that officers should go to jail for 5\nyears?\nMR. DONOVAN: Because in that situation that\nmay be beyond the Court's -- the executive power of the\nCourt. What the Court would be doing is determining\nthe rights attributable to --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The Court doesn't\nhave executive power. It has judicial power. It's\nalready exercised that judicial power in Sanchez-Llamas\nin determing the meaning of this treaty.\nAnd I understood your position to be that we\nhave no authority to construe the treaty in this case\nbecause a judgment was issued by the International Court\nof Justice.\nMR. DONOVAN: The -- the question here is\nthat the --the Court would be exercising its judicial\nauthority to construe the United States's obligation to\ncomply with the judgment. The nature of that\nobligation, itself, could be one that would be\nenforceable, in this Court's words, \"in a court of\njustice;\" and that's the nature of this obligation. Mr.\nMedellin gets a review and reconsideration.\nIn the Chief Justice's hypothetical, that\nmay well be an obligation that would be enforceable by\nother actors that would -- which would not be directly\nenforceable in a court as here.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I thought --\nMR. DONOVAN: It depends on the nature of --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I thought the question --\nand I apologize if I'm not paraphrasing it because I\nhave my own. This has arisen frequently. Brussels has\na treaty, and that treaty binds all the member nations,\nand supreme courts of various nations have come up\nagainst this problem:\nWhat would happen if the Brussels court or\nthe EU court insists under the treaty that we do\nsomething that violates our own Constitution? I think\nthis is an example of that. And the answer typically\nhas been: Well, we'd follow our own Constitution, at\nleast if it was a violation, what the EU said, of\nfundamental human rights or destroyed some basic\nstructural part of our Constitution.\nAnd the question that I would have is,\ndoesn't that kind of approach -- not exactly but that\nkind of approach -- satisfy whatever problem there is in\nthis respect here?\nMR. DONOVAN: If there were -- if an ICJ --\nJUSTICE BREYER: If the ICJ were to do\nsomething which it had never done, like, say, put\neverybody in jail for 50 years -- I don't know that\nthere is such a thing -- but suppose they did, if they\ndid, I guess that might violate something basic in our\nConstitution, in which case we wouldn't enforce it.\nMR. DONOVAN: That's right and --\nJUSTICE BREYER: If we took that approach --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Now --\nMR. DONOVAN: If there --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Just to get back,\nyou're conceding, I take it, whether the ICJ has done\nsomething like this before or not -- and we can debate\nwhether what they've done in this case is precisely that\n-- there is a role for this Court in determining whether\nor not a judgment of the ICJ should be enforced.\nMR. DONOVAN: There is surely because it's\nthis Court that would be enforcing the obligation to\ncomply. And just as a treaty cannot contravene an --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Just enforcing the\nobligation to comply or, as we have in this case,\ndetermining the legal basis for the ICJ determination?\nMR. DONOVAN: There are -- there are two\ndifferent obligations here: There is an obligation\nunder the Vienna Convention itself, and this Court has\ndetermined the dispositive effect of that obligation of\na matter of U.S. law. But there's a different\nobligation. The President and the Senate agree to go to\na third party, to go to the International Court of\nJustice, to resolve disputes. The very premise of that\nobligation is that we might disagree with the\ndetermination -- with the interpretation of the treaty,\nand we agreed in that circumstance to comply with the --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose in this case the\nPresident did the opposite -- the same facts only the\nPresident said to Texas, do not comply with this\njudgment.\nMR. DONOVAN: Well, it -- that would -- it\nwould be inconsistent with this Court's duty and\nobligation to comply, to enforce a treaty that the --\nthat the --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So then the President's --\nMR. DONOVAN: If the --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- determination is not\nconclusive.\nMR. DONOVAN: Well, the President's\ndetermination -- what the President has determined here\nis to enforce the treaty. He --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: My hypothetical is he's\ncoming out the other way. He says don't follow this\njudgment. And you say he can't do that.\nMR. DONOVAN: If --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And I -- I think that\nthat's not -- not consistent with your earlier position.\nMR. DONOVAN: Oh, if the President here --\nthe -- if there's an obligation here to comply and, in\nthe words this Court, it's \"an obligation of a nature to\nbe enforced in a court of justice,\" and here the\nobligation imposed by the ICJ and the Avena judgment is\nan -- is an obligation --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Isn't the obligation --\nMR. DONOVAN: -- which essentially --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Isn't the obligation that\nthe United States undertook when it signed the UN\nCharter the obligation to undertake to comply with ICJ\njudgments in accordance with its own constitutional\nprocesses, not necessarily that any ICJ decision would\nbe regarded by any court in this country as binding\nFederal law?\nMR. DONOVAN: Well, it would be -- that --\nthat's exactly right. What the -- what the ICJ -- what\nU.S. did is undertake to comply. So the question is,\nwhat is the nature of the obligation imposed?\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: If you had a --\nMR. DONOVAN: It might have obligations --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: If you had a treaty on\nthe recognition and enforcement of judgments, mutual\nrecognition and enforcement, then we would enforce the\njudgment that we agreed to enforce by treaty. We\nwouldn't look behind it to see if we agreed with it on\nthe merits.\nAre you saying that this undertaking, this\nagreement to submit to the compulsory jurisdiction of\nthe ICJ gives the judgment in the particular case,\nalthough not precedential effect, the counterpart to\nfull faith and credit?\nMR. DONOVAN: That's exactly the effect of\nthe judgment.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's self-enforcing. I\nthought you --\nMR. DONOVAN: It's --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I thought you -- you think\nthis treaty is self-enforcing. You don't really need\nthe President's order here.\nMR. DONOVAN: Well, if the -- whether or not\nthe treaty obligation is self-executing or\nself-enforcing goes to the nature of the obligation. If\nthe ICJ said -- if a treaty or an ICJ judgment said, go\npass a statute, that's obviously directed to Congress.\nIf it said cease hostilities, that's directed to the\nPresident. But as this Court has said, when a treaty\nor, by extension, a treaty obligation to comply with a\njudgment is --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I --\nMR. DONOVAN: -- of a nature to be enforced\n--\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May ask this question? I\ndon't think you've answered the Chief Justice's original\nhypothetical. It's easy, of course; they cannot compel\nus to violate our Constitution by a judgment of their\nkind. But what about the hypothetical that they said\nthe sentence for this man should be 5 years, not just\nthere be an investigation to see if he's been\nprejudiced. Would we have to follow that judgment?\nMR. DONOVAN: Well, in that situation, if it\nwas a judgment rendered in a case to which we had --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: In this very case.\nMR. DONOVAN: That would be --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: This very case. Supposing\nthey had said the judgment is that Medellin should spend\n5 years in jail and no more. Would we have to honor\nthat judgment?\nMR. DONOVAN: In the first instance, yes,\nthe Court would honor that judgment as an obligation to\ncomply. But remember that there are --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Then it becomes --\nMR. DONOVAN: -- some constraints that --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Then it becomes a penal\njudgment, and I thought the rule was that no country\nforces -- enforces another country's penal judgment.\nMR. DONOVAN: Well, that would depend on the\n-- if -- how you construed the obligation to comply.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But if we say --\nMR. DONOVAN: In this case, we have --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- this man goes to jail\nfor 5 years, it seems to me that's a penal judgment.\nMR. DONOVAN: If that was the nature of the\ndispute that the United -- that is, of course, not the\nnature of the dispute that the United States --\nJUSTICE ALITO: What if they say --\nMR. DONOVAN: But if he --\nJUSTICE ALITO: -- he goes to jail for no\ntime at all? They say that the remedy for these\nviolations, in order to deter future violations, should\nbe that the charges should be dismissed and any future\nprosecution should be barred. Would that be\nautomatically binding?\nMR. DONOVAN: Well, the question is, is it\nbinding in the first instance because the -- there's an\nobligation to comply? That doesn't say anything about,\nfor example, Congress's ability to repudiate that\nobligation to comply, just like it has the obligation --\nthe authority as a last-in-time rule, pursuant to the\nlast-in-time rule, to repudiate any treaty obligation.\nBut the framers wanted treaties to be enforced in the\nfirst instance when they were susceptible of judicial\nenforcement, and if the ICJ renders a judgment pursuant\nto our treaty obligation to submit disputes, that is of\na nature to be judicially enforced, then the Court --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is the answer to --\nMR. DONOVAN: -- would be exercising --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is the answer to\neither my or Justice Stevens's hypothetical then, yes,\nwe do have to enforce an ICJ judgment of that sort?\nMR. DONOVAN: You would enforce an ICJ\njudgment that did in fact -- that was of a nature to be\nenforced in -- in a judicial proceeding.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: This is not of a nature to\nbe enforced in a judicial proceeding in Texas. Texas\nhas procedural rules that disable the Texas court from\ncomplying with the ICJ judgment here. Are you telling\nme that the ICJ judgment empowers either Federal or\nState courts to do things which -- which their laws do\nnot permit them to do?\nMR. DONOVAN: If the -- both the President's\ndetermination and the Article 94 obligation which result\nin the Avena judgment are Federal law. The President's\ndetermination pursuant to his State court authority and\nArticle II authority and the -- and the Avena judgment\npursuant to the treaty --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And -- and do you know of\nany other Federal law that -- that interferes in the --\nin the procedures of State criminal courts, directs them\nas to what -- what procedures they have to have?\nMR. DONOVAN: The Court has -- when there's\na Federal procedural rule that preempts a State\nprocedural rule, the Court allows that to preempt as a\nFederal rule all the time.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Really?\nMR. DONOVAN: That's a function of --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Where? I don't know what\nyou're talking about unless you're talking about\nconstitutional requirements. Of course, those are\nbinding on the States. But you're saying that the\nFederal Government can prescribe State court procedures\nand authorize State courts to do things which -- which\nthe State government does not authorize them to do?\nMR. DONOVAN: The Federal Government can\nprescribe rules of decision that preempt Federal rules\nand require the cases that other -- that would not\notherwise be heard to be heard. That's --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, you're -- you're --\nas I understand it, in order for you to prevail on that\npoint, the only -- the only conclusion that has to be\ndrawn, as I understand it, is that the Texas courts have\nsubject matter jurisdiction of this kind of -- of order,\nand that the bar that Texas is asserting is simply, in\neffect, a procedural bar; and, therefore, in order for\nthis Federal rule to preempt the State bar is not to\ngive the State courts jurisdiction they don't have, but\nto remove a bar to the exercise of their jurisdiction\nthat State law, absent preemption, would impose; is that\ncorrect?\nMR. DONOVAN: That's correct. That's right.\nIt removes a bar by preempting that bar.\nJUSTICE ALITO: You just --\nMR. DONOVAN: If I may --\nJUSTICE ALITO: You just said that the Avena\ndecision is Federal law. How is the -- how is the Avena\ndecision itself a Federal law?\nMR. DONOVAN: Well, the Avena decision --\nJUSTICE ALITO: It's not a statute. It's\nnot the Constitution. It's not a statute. It's not\nitself a treaty.\nMR. DONOVAN: The Avena decision has the\nforce of Federal law, either by virture of the treaty\nobligation to comply with it under Article 94-1, or the\nPresident's determination under his Article II authority\nto require -- to determine that the United States should\ncomply. And by either one of those vehicles, in effect\nthe judgment becomes the --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You didn't mention the --\nMR. DONOVAN: -- the instrument by which it\nmust be complied with.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You didn't mention the\nOptional Protocol which is -- is where the United States\ngave its promise. It voluntarily accepted this\njurisdiction. It didn't have to.\nMR. DONOVAN: Well, that's right. It's the\ncombined force of the Optional Protocol and the UN\nCharter and ICJ statute.\nAnd if I may reserve the rest of my --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, why don't --\nwhy don't you take 5 extra minutes? And we'll give you\nyour rebuttal time.\nIf the Avena judgment is binding as Federal\nlaw, is it your position, though, that the -- this Court\nhas no authority to review the content of that Federal\nlaw -- the judgment? Our choice is simply enforce it?\nMR. DONOVAN: The relevant Federal law here\nis the Federal law that says that the United States will\ncomply pursuant to its voluntary choice to submit\nthese -- this --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So we have no --\nMR. DONOVAN: I'm sorry -- to the ICJ.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We have no authority\nto review the judgment itself, even though the judgment\nwill have the effect as Federal law of preempting the\nState law in this instance?\nMR. DONOVAN: Well, you are in effect\napplying Federal law in the form of the obligation to\ncomply. That's different than applying the Vienna\nConvention --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Excuse me, but your\nposition is not that we are applying the obligation to\ncomply, because we interpreted that in Sanchez-Llamas\nand came to the exact same conclusion as the ICG here.\nWhat you're saying is it's different here because the\noperative law is the judgment.\nMR. DONOVAN: The operative -- it's\ndifferent because on the one hand, in Sanchez-Llamoas,\nthis Court was interpreting the underlying obligation\nunder the treaty. That is, the immediately applicable\ninstrument. But, as with respect to any judgment, a\ncourt's -- and this Court has affirmed with respect to\ninternational adjudications, that it will enforce an\ninternational adjudication.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Can this court interpret\nthe meaning of the Avena judgment if it's ambiguous?\nFor instance, it said that a number of Mexico nationals\nhave not received a hearing. It didn't say all of them.\nAnd I have a problem, incidentally, because I think\nMedellin did receive all the hearing that he's entitled\nto under the judgment anyway.\nCan we interpret the judgment in that\nrespect if it's ambiguous, not clear?\nMR. DONOVAN: Wel, in this case, the court\nwould be -- a court applying the Avena judgment either\nby virtue of the Optional Protocol in 94-1 and the\nPresident's determination would be in effect applying\nFederal law. We think the judgments --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Can we interpret the\njudgment?\nMR. DONOVAN: Well, to the extent necessary\nto apply Federal law in the form of a judgment --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And can the President\ndisplace our authority to do that?\nMR. DONOVAN: The President would not\ndisplace the Court's authority to interpret a judgment,\nno. What the President has said is that the judgment\nshall be enforced. That's an independent source of\nFederal law under his Article II --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So if he determines\nthat the judgment should not be enforced and this Court\ndetermines, based on our construction of the treaty and\nthe judgment that it should be enforced, which\ndetermination controls?\nMR. DONOVAN: This Court -- to the extent\nthat this is Federal law, this Court has the ultimate\nauthority to determine whether or not it should be\ncomplied with. And this Court -- the framers have made\ntreaties supreme Federal law specification so they could\nbe judicially enforceable.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, if we have the\nauthority to determine whether the treaty should be\ncomplied with in the face of a presidential\ndetermination, why don't we have the independent\nauthority to determine whether or not it should be\ncomplied with at a matter of Federal law without regard\nto the President's determination?\nMR. DONOVAN: You have two separate and\nindependent sources of authority here. Without the\nPresident's determination, this Court pursuant to the\nmandate in the Supremacy Clause would apply the treaty\nobligation to comply with the judgment because the\nnature of the judgment is such to be enforced in a court\nof justice. In this instance, you have an entirely\nindependent source of authority because the President in\nthe exercise of his Article II authority has determined\nthat it's in the paramount interest of the United States\nto comply. That becomes a second object.\nOf course, it would be a judicial function\nto interpret the -- interpret those obligations,\ninterpret what the President meant. But in this case\nit's crystal clear. The Avena judgment is mandatory and\nprospective. The President is determined that it be\nenforced, and that would be the result even had the\nPresident not acted pursuant to the mandate of the\nSupremacy Clause, which makes treatise enforceable\nFederal law.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Donovan. We'll give you 5 minutes for your\nrebuttal.\nGeneral Clement.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF GEN. PAUL D. CLEMENT.\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES AS\nAMICUS CURIAE SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may\nit please the Court:\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You don't agree with the\nlast statement.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: I don't think I do agree\nwith that and there's a couple of the issues here where\nwe take a slightly different take. Obviously we feel\nthe President's determination here that we will comply\nwith the Avena judgment is a critical element in why\nthere's an enforceable obligation --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: We would have no --\naccording to you, we would have no obligation to enforce\nthis judgment but for the President's action?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: That's correct, Justice\nScalia. Now, obviously, Mr. Donovan and his clients\ncould get here and ask you to enforce the judgment of it\nown force without the President's determination and that\nwould ultimately be a question for this Court. We of\ncourse --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: We could decide to go back,\ntoo. But would we have any authority to do it?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: I hope that you wouldn't\nand we would be up here saying don't, because if you\nlook at Article 94 of the UN Charter as a whole, it has\ntwo components and I think it makes clear why the\nPresident's intervening role here is important. 94-1\nsays that we undertake to comply with our obligations,\nwith our obligations to comply with the judgment. But\n94-2 says what happens when a country doesn't do that.\nIt's a matter for the Security Council. And that, of\ncourse, I think necessarily implies that countries do\nretain the option to put themselves out of compliance\nwith an International Court of Justice judgment.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But that would take an\naction by somebody in the country.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Exactly, Justice Ginsburg,\nand I think that --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Here that hasn't -- that\nhasn't happened. 94 would never be triggered because we\nhaven't said we're breaking our promise, we're not going\nto comply.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Absolutely, and that's why\nwe're supporting Mr. Donovan.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Wait a minute. In order to\nget it to the Security Council, you have to take some\naffirmative action not to comply? It's just not enough\nsimply not to comply?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Whether it's an omission\nor a commission I don't think is the point, Justice\nScalia. My point --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I thought that was tte\npoint of Justice Ginsburg's comment, that there had been\nno decision not to comply. Don't you need an\naffirmative decision to comply?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: I didn't take that to mean\n--\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: If you don't -- if you\ndon't comply, you don't comply. But we -- certainly not\n-- in that situation here, the President said the United\nStates agreed that it would submit to the binding\njurisdiction for one case only, and we are bound by that\njudgment and I'm going to enforce it.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: I agree, i think the\nomission-commission --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I know you agree, but it\ndepends on whether it's up to the President to make that\ncall. Usually when we have treaties that are not self-\nenforcing the judgment of whether that international law\nobligation shall be made domestic law is a judgment for\nthe Congress.\nCongress passes a law to enforce the treaty,\nand you're telling us that, well, we don't need the\nCongress; the President can make a domestic law by\nwriting a memo to his attorney general.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, Justice Scalia, let\nme take that in turn. Let me just first close the\ndiscussion of what happened here by saying the reason I\nthink the commission-omission distinction doesn't have\nmuch purchase here is because the President did make a\ndetermination that we would comply. And I think if you\nask the question who makes the determination as to\nwhether we're going to default on our international law\nobligations or comply, especially vis-a-vis the UN, the\nanswer to that question is quite clear: It's the\nPresident, and Congress has acquiesced in that with the\nUN Participation act at 22 U.S.C. 287.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if the\nPresident had said, we're going to comply with this\njudgment, but in a different way than the ICJ\ndetermined. We're going to comply by examining in each\ncase whether there's already been a determination of\nprejudice, and if there has then there's no further\nreview, but if there hasn't then there'll be further\nreview. Would that be binding as a matter of Federal\nlaw?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: It depends exactly what\nform that would take. I think part of the problem --\nI'm stumbling with that question --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's the same as a\nmemorandum just like -- it's a memorandum just like the\none we have here.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: And what does it suggest\nthat is supposed to be done with tne end product of that\ndetermination?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It says that if there\nhas already been -- the State courts are to determine if\nthere's already been a determination of prejudice in the\ncase, and if there has there's to be no further review.\nBut if they determine there hasn't, there is to be\nfurther review. That's different than the ICJ's\njudgment, which suggests there should be a new\ndetermination in every case.\nIs that -- does that have the same status as\nthe memorandum here?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: I would say that it\nwouldn't -- I would say that it wouldn't, as you\nsuggest, not fully comply and not fully discharge with\nour obligation.\nBut the extent to which we did and purported\nto be doing that under compliance with the judgment, it\nwould have the same force as providing the rule of\ndecision, which, to get back to Justice Scalia's\nquestion, especially in a context like this, is not so\nunprecedented. It is not materially different from when\nthe President supplies the rule of decision in the\npre-FSIA practice by making a determination, binding on\nthe courts State and Federal, that somebody has\nsovereign immunity.\nJUSTICE ALITO: If we agree with you, would\nthe effect be that the President can take any treaty\nthat is ratified on the understanding that it's not\nself-executing and execute the treaty and give it force\nunder domestic law?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: No, Justice Alito, I don't\nthink the theory would sweep that broadly, and I think\nthat --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, why would it not?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, first of all,\nthere's obviously a limiting principle in our theory,\nwhich is to say that the President can't take any action\npursuant to this which is inconsistent with other\nconstitutional obligations.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But he can -- he can\ntake action that's inconsistent with the determination\nof Federal law by this Court?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: No, Mr. Chief Justice, I\ndon't think that's true.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I thought we\ndetermined in Sanchez-Llamas that the treaty did not\nmean what the ICJ said it means in this case.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: That's exactly right as to\nthe Vienna Convention. But this case raises a question,\nnot about the proper interpretation of the Vienna\nConvention, because as you remember we were four-square\nwith this Court on its interpretation of the Vienna\nConvention in Sanchez-Llamas. The relevant treaties\nhere the Optional Protocol and the UN Charter, and the\nquestion here is not the force of -- of the Avena\njudgment as precedent --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you doubt that\nthe judgment here is based on a determination of the\nVienna Convention that's exactly the opposite of what we\ndetermined last year?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: No doubt at all, Mr. Chief\nJustice. And we think with respect to anyone but the 51\nindividuals that are covered by the judgment that of\ncourse this Court has the final word on the\ninterpretation of the Vienna Convention.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: They were not\nparties to it. What do you mean, \"covered by the\njudgment?\" Is this some -- some new kind of new kind of\njurisdiction? If you're named in a suit by somebody\nelse, you somehow acquire rights under that suit? I\ndon't know of any such principle.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Justice Scalia --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: These people were not\nparties to the -- the countries were parties to the\njudgment.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Of course the countries\nwere parties, but these 51 individuals' claims were\nspecifically adjudicated. Why were they specifically\nadjudicate? Because they were effectively -- the claims\nwere espoused by the Mexican Government. That system --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: General, can we just\nclarify something which I think is important? Justice\nScalia suggested that this wasn't self-executing. The\nState Department with respect to the Vienna Convention\nitself told Congress very clearly: You don't have to do\nanything; this is self-executing. And then the protocol\nsays: We the United States agree to accept the\njurisdiction of the ICJ in a certain class of cases.\nAnd Congress ratified that, too. So I don't think that\nself-executing has anything to do with this case.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, Justice Ginsburg, I\nthink that reflects that self-executing is one of those\nwords that people use to cover a lot of different\nmeanings; and I think in its most correct sense, you're\nright to say that the Vienna Convention is\nself-executing.\nSo there didn't have to be legislation\nbefore Texas and its local officials were obligated to\nprovide notice in this case; and of course, it's their\ndefault on that treat obligation by the State and local\nofficials that has us in this predicament in the first\nplace.\nNow, there's another meaning of\n\"self-executing\", or maybe it's a misuse of the term, to\nsay whether it gives rise to individually enforceable\nrights in court without more. And we do take the\nposition that if the President had done nothing, and\ncertainly if the President had said we're not going to\ncomply, we're going to respond to this ICJ judgment the\nway we did with the Nicaragua judgment, we don't think\nthat this judgment would be enforceable as of its own\nterms.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But in Nicaragua the\nUnited States took the position from day 1 that the ICJ\nhad no jurisdiction over the case. So the absence of\njurisdiction is always an exception to the obligation,\neven within the United States, to give full faith and\ncredit. If the court had no jurisdiction, another State\ndoesn't have to give full faith and credit. But if it\ndoes have jurisdiction, then the obligation kicks in.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: That's absolutely right,\nand that gets back to the basic principle of reviewing\nforeign judgments; and it's not that this Court is\ndisabled from its judicial role. It's just the judicial\nrole here is not a straight-up question of the\ninterpretation of the Vienna Convention. It's a\nquestion of what effect to give the judgment that's been\neffectively validated by the executive branch. And\nthere's two things --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: You're arguing it's just\nthe normal choice of law problem, that even though the\njudgment's clearly wrong on the matter of international\nlaw, if the court had judgment -- had jurisdiction to\nenter the judgment, we must treat it as binding?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: That's -- that's right,\nJustice Stevens. As Justice Ginsburg put it --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: That's provided that we\nregard these individuals as though they're tantamount to\nthe parties to the judgment itself.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: I think that's right, and\ncertainly our obligation under that judgment as the\nexecutive branch sees it is to these 51 individuals as\ntheir claims have been espoused by --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose the President had\nreached the contrary conclusion, a hypothetical we put\nearlier. Supposed the President had told Texas, do not\nfollow this judgment?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Then I'd be on that side\nof the podium, Your Honor. I mean, we would take the\nposition that the President's authority here is, in his\nview of this, is a necessary step; and that seems to be\n--\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I agree that we should\ngive that determination great weight, but that's\nsomething quite different from saying that he can\ndisplace the authority of this Court on that issue of\nlaw.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Oh, but the -- the\nPresident can't displace the role of this Court. It's\njust that the role of this Court in a situation where\nthere's been a judgment and the executive branch has\nviewed that judgment as something we should comply with,\nthen the role of this Court is limited to deciding\nwhether there was jurisdiction to issue that judgment in\nthe first place; and then the secondary role of this\nCourt would to be to say, does the rule of law embodied\nby that judgment violate the Constitution. And that's\nwhy the answer to the Chief Justice's original\nhypothetical, about a sentence to 5 years for guards\nthat had no notice -- that's a different case.\nBut here there's no colorable argument that\nthe -- that the judgment here and what's embodied in it\nlies outside the power of the Federal Government as a\nwhole to adjudicate and to put as an obligation on the\nStates.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Chief Justice, may I\nask a further - may I ask a further question?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Let me try one other\nvariation to make sure that I understand your argument.\nWhat if the President of the United States had said this\njudgment, the Avena judgment, will not be enforced, and\nthis Court interpreted the Avena judgment as binding, as\nproviding a rule of decision and a rule of decision\nwhich was entitled to respect by Texas?\nWould this Court's authority to make that\ndeclaration and issue a judgment to that effect be\ndisplaced by the President's determination that it would\nnot be that the Avena judgment would not be enforced?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Of course not, Justice\nSouter. That would just be like cases that\nunfortunately happen, where we would take a position\nthat the judgment on its own is not binding and you\nwould reject that position and that would be the law of\nthe land.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: We don't suggest that we\nwouldn't comply with a judgment of this Court, accepting\nMr. Donovan's first theory that the President's role\nhere is unimportant.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So --\nGENERAL CLEMENT: -- but we do think, we\nstick to our view that the President's role here makes\nthis an easier case and is in our view dispositive.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But it does follow then\nfrom what you've said that if we take exactly the\nposition that I outlined in my hypo, we could avoid the\nentire question of presidential authority.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: You could. I think\nanother route, of course, that would be available to you\nis to simply say: Here we have a judgment and we have\nthe President effectively espousing the judgment, and in\nthose cases we don't have to worry about what would\nhappen if we didn't have one or the other.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: That's in effect a judicial\nversion of one of the variants in Justice Jackson's hypo\nin the Steel case --\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Exactly.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: He's talking about the\nPresident and Congress; we're talking about the\nPresident and the Court.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Right.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The President espousing the\njudgment -- Texas takes the position that this\nmemorandum has -- has no legal effect; it's a memorandum\nfrom the President to the -- to his attorney general.\nIt's not a directive to the States. In fact, it even\nrefers to pursuant to the principles of comity, which\nsuggests, you know, do it if you want to be cooperative,\ndon't do it if you don't want to be cooperative.\nWhat is your response to that? And would it\nbe enough if the President simply wrote a memorandum to\nhimself saying that, I think this is the way that the --\nthat the judgment of the ICJ should be enforced? He\ndoesn't have to tell Texas. He can just tell his\nattorney general?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, Justice Scalia, I\nthink there's two questions there. I'd like to try to\nanswer them both. One is, what degree of formality is\nrequired? And we would say that if you look to\nhistorical practice, this is not something where you a\nneed a high degree of formality. So look to the\nexecutive agreement that this case -- this Court gave\nits positive effect to in Belmont and Pink. It was an\nexchange of diplomatic letters, nothing more. Look to\nthe executive determination that this Court give\ndispositive effect to, dismissed the lawsuit completely\nin Ex Parte Peru. It was a letter from the\nundersecretary of state to the attorney general.\nGoing back to the very beginnings of the\nnation, look at the extradition of Thomas Nash. What\nwas the form of the President's determination we would\nextradite him? A letter from the secretary of state to\nJudge Bee in South Carolina.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: In none of those\ncases were we talking about a determination contrary to\na legal determination by this Court concerning the scope\nof powers under the treaty.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, with respect --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And in Nash he was being\nheld under Federal custody. So Nash is just\ninapplicable here.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, I don't think Nash\nis inapplicable, Justice Kennedy; I think it is on all\nfours.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Of course, Nash is just a\nwonderful speech by Marshall anyway; it's not an\nopinion.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: But it is a wonderful\nspeech, and I really do think you should take a look at\nthat speech. If you want to find it, it's actually\nappended to volume 18 of the U.S. Reports. And I think\nyou should look at that speech before rejecting our\nposition here, because it really is on all fours in that\nthere you had a treaty obligation duly approved by the\nSenate, and there was a question: Do we need an act of\nCongress before the executive can extradite somebody?\nAnd Marshall I think put the law exactly right in that\ncase when he said: Sure, Congress can make a\ndetermination and if it does, that's the end of matter;\nbut absent the congressional determination, the\nPresident has the authority to extradite Nash.\nNow, that's a situation where somebody's\npersonal liberty was at stake. So I would say that in\nsome respects it's a fortiori that in this case what's\nat issue is simply recognizing that there's binding\nFederal law here, that I think if the Texas court had\nrecognized that it was binding Federal law, it would\nhave applied under their own State procedural default\nlaw.\nNow, just to finish up, and then I will sit\ndown, there's a second part of your question, Justice\nScalia, which was addressed to what does the reference\nto comity mean. Obviously, from the very beginning in\nthis case we have taken the position in this Court that\nthe President's memorandum directs the State courts, in\nits words, to give effect to the Avena judgment -- not\ndecide whether you want to give it effect based on your\nState law of comity, but give effect to the judgment.\nI think if you actually look at the law of\ncomity, one of the things that it talks about is comity\nis really what the courts should do in the absence of a\ncontrolling view from one of the political branches.\nHere the President has made clear, it's clear to me what\nthe answer is applying comity, which would be to give\neffect to the judgment.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, General.\nMr. Cruz, by my count we'll give you an\nextra 10 minutes.\nORAL ARGUMENT of R. TED CRUZ,\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. CRUZ: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe entirety of the United States's argument\nis predicated on the idea that the President's\ntwo-paragraph memorandum is in and of itself binding\nFederal law.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, that's the -- that's\nthe argument, but your brother the Solicitor General has\nconceded that if we take the position in this case that\nthere is a -- a rule of decision that should be\nrespected in this Court and, hence, the subject of a\njudgment to Texas that, among other things, would\nsuspend Texas's procedural bar law -- that that would\nobviate the question of presidential power.\nMR. CRUZ: There's no doubt, if the Court\ndecided it on the ground that Avena was a binding\njudgment, the President's order would be unnecessary.\nI would note the United States strenuously\ndisagrees with that proposition. And, indeed, the\nUnited States explicitly disclaims these treaties as the\nsource of his authority; in fact, expressly agrees with\nthis Court's decision in Sanchez-Llamas.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Maybe you could spend a\nminute explaining that, because, as I read the\nConstitution, it says all treaties made, or which shall\nbe made, under the authority of the United States shall\nbe the supreme law of the land, and the judges in every\nState -- I guess it means including Texas --\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- shall be bound thereby,\nanything in the constitution or laws of any State to the\ncontrary notwithstanding.\nNow, as I understand it, the United States\nentered into a treaty. That treaty said we will follow\nthe interpretations and the judgments of the\nInternational Court of Justice in respect to the Vienna\nConvention.\nAnd that Court did make a judgment in that\nrespect, in respect to this client, and it said: Our\njudgment is that Texas, or someone in the United States,\nmust redo the procedural hearing simply to see whether,\nin deciding whether there's prejudice or whether there's\na procedural default, full account is taken of the\nimportance of the Vienna rights. That's what we're\ntalking about.\nIt's a judgment of the court. The United\nStates has promised to follow that judgment of the\ncourt. The Constitution says, since it promised by\ntreaty, that is the law; and the law binds the States.\nThat may be simple-minded, but I'd like to\nhear what the answer to that, rather, chain of logic is\n-- chain of law.\nMR. CRUZ: Certainly, Justice Breyer.\nTexas, of course, does not dispute that the\nConstitution, laws, and treaties are the supreme law of\nthe land. And Texas statutes must give way to any of\nthese three.\nThe President's memorandum is none of those\nthree.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I was not talking --\nMR. CRUZ: And, with respect --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- about the President's\nmemorandum at the moment. And to be -- to disclose\nfully what I'm thinking, I'm thinking that maybe if a\npresident disagreed in such a thing, some kind of a\nquestion -- I'm not sure what -- would be presented.\nBut whatever \"what,\" I don't worry about\nthat \"what\" here, because the President, too, agrees.\nMR. CRUZ: Justice Breyer, the -- the answer\nto your question is the Avena decision is not a judgment\nin the sense we recognize judgment in U.S. courts for\nsix separate reasons.\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, forget whether we\nrecognize it this way as a judgment. I'm saying we\npromised in the treaty to follow that thing. Call it\nwhatever name you want. We promised to follow that\nthing, which I have in front of me -- excerpts of which\n-- called an Avena something. And we know what that\nsays. I'm just looking to see what they call it. They\ncall it -- well, you tell me what they call it. They\ncall it -- it is not called the word \"judgment.\" It's\ncalled: \"The appropriate reparation in this case\nconsists of the obligation of the United States to\" --\nand then they listed it.\nSo I take it we have promised to carry out\nthat obligation by treaty.\nMR. CRUZ: Except that when the Senate\nratified the Optional Protocol, it made clear that the\nOptional Protocol was not self-executing. Indeed, a\npoint Mr. Donovan made in his argument --\nJUSTICE BREYER: What are the words that the\nSenate said? Because, when you say \"self-executing,\"\nthe easiest way for me to understand that is the\nConstitution means what it says.\nBut there happened to be a few instances\nwhere the nature of the obligation or the intent of the\nparty makes it very difficult to enforce it as a binding\njudgment of a court. That is not this case.\nMR. CRUZ: This -- this Court has made clear\nfor 200 years the Senate can ratify a treaty and yet\nleave it not self-executing in the sense that it is not\nenforceable in U.S. domestic courts.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Oh, and so if they did\nthat, now, will you quote the words or give me the\nreference where the Senate said: Although we entered\ninto this and although we ratify it, we're not going to\ndo it --\nMR. CRUZ: Well --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- unless you --\nMR. CRUZ: The text of the treaty, itself,\nis the first place to look. The text of Article 94 of\nthe UN Charter provides that the remedy is that the\nparty may have recourse to the Security Council.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: That's after there's a\nbreach, but we -- let's stick to the protocol, the\nOptional Protocol -- optional. The protocol says:\nWe accept the compulsory jurisdiction of the\nICJ. \"Jurisdiction\" means power. We agree that in\ncases of this character, Vienna Convention violation\ncases, we submit to the jurisdiction of X tribunal, the\nICJ.\nWhat is there that needs execution about\nthat? Congress said yes, the United States, the\nExecutive Branch of the United States decides that it's\na good idea to submit to the -- to the jurisdiction of\nthe ICJ. We ratify that.\nAnd I don't see anything left for Congress\nto do. It said the United States can submit to the\njurisdiction of the ICJ.\nMR. CRUZ: \"Jurisdiction\" in that sense is\nnot \"jurisdiction\" in the sense of a U.S. court.\nRather, it is an international obligation that is to be\nresolved through political and diplomatic avenues. And\nthe best example of that --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It just means we agree that\nthe case can go before the court.\nMR. CRUZ: Exactly.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And we will be a party\nbefore the court. Isn't there some doubt whether the --\nthe Senate and the President, together, can -- can take\naway from this Court the power and responsibility to\ndecide what the treaty obligations of the United States\nare?\nMR. CRUZ: Justice Scalia, I --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Isn't there some problem\nthere?\nMR. CRUZ: I would go further than some\ndoubt, and I would say that if the treaty purported to\ngive the authority to make binding adujudications of\nFederal law to any tribunal other than this Court, that\nit would violate Article III of the Constitution.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Fine. Then, are you\nsaying there are -- there are 112, I believe, treaties\nin which we've entered into promises that we're going to\nfollow what an international tribunal said. Somebody\nlooked up, I saw on the Internet, that at this moment\nthere are approximately 116 regulatory entities in the\nworld where we've entered, or others have entered into,\nregimes, where there are various adjudicatory tribunals\nof different kinds, mostly commercial, that bind us.\nAnd is your view: All of these thousands,\nperhaps, or hundreds, anyway, of treaties are unlawful,\nand that our promises are not enforceable, because\nthere's a constitutional question?\nMR. CRUZ: There are hundreds of treaty\nobligations that this nation is committed to that are\nnot self-executing, that don't immediately have force --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No. No. I'm thinking that\nare self- executing. I'm thinking that there are --\nlike WTO, NAFTA. We can go down a long list of\ninstances where the United States has promised to follow\nthe decisions of tribunals that are not Article III\ncourts and to put them into effect at once.\nMR. CRUZ: If -- if --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And I wonder, without\nfurther ado, now, are you saying that all those are\nunconstitutional?\nMR. CRUZ: In -- in those instances --\nJUSTICE BREYER: \"Yes\" or \"no\"? I'd\nappreciate a \"yes\" or \"no\" answer.\nMR. CRUZ: No. No, we are not saying that.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay.\nMR. CRUZ: In those instances, the bodies in\nquestion are not making definitive interpretations of\nwhat Federal law is. The best illustration of this is\nthe example Mr. Donovan used in his opening argument\nwhere he said, if the ICJ said to the United States\ncease hostilities, that would be directed to the\nPresident.\nNow, under Mr. Donovan's argument, that's a\nclear directive. The United States is bound by treaty,\nand apparently the Federal courts could order the\nPresident to cease hostilities if that was the\ninstruction of the ICJ.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I'm sorry. What I don't\nunderstand about this is that I thought that the ICJ in\nthis case interpreted the treaty. That's not Federal\nlaw. That's the treaty. And it said that the treaty --\nMR. CRUZ: The treaty is Federal law,\nJustice Breyer.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Oh, then I don't understand\nyou because the WTO interprets a treaty. It interprets\na treaty that binds the United States, just like the ICJ\nis interpreting a treaty that binds the United States.\nSo what's the difference?\nMR. CRUZ: The nature of this treaty,\nevery -- every position -- the United States State\nDepartment at the time it was introduced, the Senate,\nand every member of the Senate who discussed it,\nunderstood that the decisions of the ICJ would not have\nbinding effect in U.S. courts. And that is identical to\nthe understanding of every single nation --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And what you are saying --\nand this has been the law --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask a question,\nplease?\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Go ahead.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: It's critical to me to\nunderstand the effect of the judgment, and you said\nthere are six reasons why it's not an ordinary judgment.\nI really would like to hear what those reasons are\nwithout interruption from all of my colleagues.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. CRUZ: I would be happy to provide\nthose, Justice Stevens. The first reason is because the\nOptional Protocol is not self-executing, so it does not\nhave force in United States courts.\nThe second reason is, if it was a binding\njudgment, that would violate Article III. It would give\nto a tribunal other than this Court the authority to\ndetermine Federal law.\nThe third reason is in Sanchez-Llamas a\nmajority of this Court rejected this argument and\nprovided explicitly, quote, \"nothing in the structure or\npurpose of the ICJ suggests that its interpretations\nwere intended to be conclusive on our courts.\nThe fourth reason is the parties in Avena\nwere the United States and Mexico. Neither is a party\nto this proceeding. The argument as to why it is\nbinding in this case is that Texas is vicariously part\nof the United States. That was equally true of Oregon\nin Sanchez-Llamas. In both cases, there's one State who\nis in some sense one of the parties.\nThe fifth reason is the Breard case was in\nmany senses equally a judgment, in that you had the ICJ\nissuing an order to this Court concerning Breard,\nconcerning his specific case, to stop his execution, and\nthis Court concluded that that could not trump U.S. law.\nAnd the sixth and final reason that it is\nnot a judgment is to treat it as a binding judgment\nwould be to cut out the President's authority not to\ncomply. Everyone agrees, for example in the Nicaragua\ncase, that the President retains the authority to say\nno, we're not going to comply.\nWhich is why the entire purpose of this\nadjudication is not to resolve something finally in a\ncourt of law, but it is rather a diplomatic measure,\nmuch as -- much like when the United States sued Iran\nduring the hostage crisis. We didn't believe the\nAyatollah was going to listen to the ICJ and suddenly\nlet the hostages go. We didn't -- we didn't expect that\nIranian courts would give force to it, but it was\nhelpful diplomatically to bring it to that tribunal to\nthen put international pressure. That --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Then this is consistent\nwith what you've been explaining to Justice Breyer in\nyour answer, that for 200 years we have had some\ntreaties that are very important, but they're not\nself-executing; their violation may put us in violation\nof international law; but it is for us to determine how\nwe are going to comply with the international\nobligation; and there is no obligation on the part of\nthe State to comply with that law because it's not\nself-executing.\nMR. CRUZ: Justice Kennedy, that is exactly\ncorrect.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: At some point I think in\nthe course of your argument, we may get back to whether\nthe Vienna Convention itself is or is not\nself-executing. I think the Solicitor General was\ncorrect in saying that that's a difficult word. I think\nit is self-executing in that the State has to comply\nwith it.\nI'm not sure that it is self-executing in\nthat the State has to accept whatever procedural\nframework the foreign national demands.\nMR. CRUZ: I would agree with the\ncharacterization you suggest, which is that the Vienna\nConvention was self-executing in the sense that it\ndidn't require legislation to go into effect, but it was\nnot self-executing in the sense that it provided\njudicially cognizable rights.\nBut let me add a caveat to that, which is in\nboth Breard and Sanchez-Llamas, this Court assumed the\nVienna Convention created individual rights, and\nalthough Texas maintains that it did not create\nindividual rights and the United States maintains that\nit did not create individual rights, we don't have to\nwin on that proposition to prevail in this case. Even\nassuming it created individual rights in this case,\nMedellin defaulted on that claim and this Court held\nwith Sanchez-Llamas that procedural default is\nconsistent with the treaty.\nAnd the real question here in this case,\nparticularly with respect to the President's order, is\nwhether the Optional Protocol is self-executing, the\ndecision of the Avena court, or, as a subsequent matter,\nwhether the President has some sort of independent\nauthority to make Federal law.\nAnd in this respect --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, I still -- I would\nlike to get back to that Optional Protocol. It -- was\nit submission to jurisdiction? My understanding is that\nany two parties that can agree, can have a formed\nselection clause, can agree that we accept the authority\nof this tribunal, and then it follows from that that if\nyou accept their authority to adjudicate, you are bound\nto follow its decisions. And that that seems to be\nunderstood in the world community because, is it not so\nthat even though there are cases like Nicaragua and\nIran, most ICJ judgments are indeed complied with by the\nnations that agree to submit to the jurisdiction of that\ntribunal?\nMR. CRUZ: Justice Ginsburg, that is correct\nas a political and diplomatic matter, but in my judgment\nit speaks volumes that of the 166 nations that signed on\nto the Vienna Convention and of the 50 nations that\nsigned on to the Optional Protocol, zero -- not a single\nnation -- treats ICJ judgments as binding in their\ndomestic courts.\nWhat Petitioners are arguing here is for an\ninterpretation of this treaty that no other nation\ngives. And in fact, if I found myself in the nation of\nMexico and arrested without consular notification, I\ncould not raise this claim in Mexico. The Mexican\ncourts would not treat it as a defense to my criminal\nprosecution.\nAnd so --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Do you have a case that\nsays that? A Mexican case that says that?\nMR. CRUZ: I do not have a case that says\nthat, but neither Petitioner nor their many amici have\nbeen able to point to a single instance.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Maybe it hasn't come up.\nMR. CRUZ: Given that these treaties are\nfour decades old, that that speaks volumes that no -- no\nnation has accorded binding force to ICJ --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Maybe these other nations\nhave an inquisitorial system where an investigating\njudge collects a dossier and the fact is noted in the\ndossier and the investigating judge and the prosecution\ngive it such weight as it's entitled to.\nMR. CRUZ: Justice --\nJUSTICE BREYER: You know that doesn't\nhappen?\nMR. CRUZ: Justice Breyer, I -- I think you\ncould well be right, but I think that also speaks to the\npeculiar nature of this. Procedural default only --\nJUSTICE BREYER: In an --\nMR. CRUZ: -- matters in system like the\nUnited States' where habeas allows a second bite at the\napple. Most other countries don't allow criminal\ndefendants to relitigate criminal matters, in which case\nprocedural default matters. The other countries simply\ndeny it altogether.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Of course it matters. But\nthe -- of course it matters. That's why when I read the\n-- the ICJ opinion, I read it as saying that they're not\ntelling you to set aside a procedural default rule.\nWhat they've asked you to do is to provide, by means of\nthe United States' own choosing, review and\nreconsideration of the convictions and sentences by\ntaking account of the violation of rights.\nAnd throughout they ask -- when you decided\nwhether the person was really prejudiced, when you\ndecided whether there had been forfeiture of the rights,\nat that time, did you ask yourself that the reason he\nmight not have raised them was because he knew nothing\nabout them and his lawyer knew nothing about them,\nbecause nobody ever told either about them? In which\ncase there might be a causal connection.\nAs I read it, the ICJ left all that up to\nyou but just asked you, please, look at it again having\nread our opinion and keeping this in mind.\nMR. CRUZ: But the ICJ's decision -- I think\nyour question goes back to Justice Ginsburg's question\nabout the effect of an ICJ decision.\nThe legal -- legal adviser to the State\nDepartment told the Senate, when it was ratifying the UN\nCharter, that decisions of the ICJ are \"a moral\nobligation\" and there is \"no provision\" for the\nenforcement of such decisions. And one fascinating\nexample of this is the entire debate over the Connally\nAmendment. One can look in the entire course of\nlegislative history, and it's an argument back and forth\nabout whether it is wise to require the United States to\ncast a veto in the Security Council over an attempt to\nenforce an ICJ. And not a single senator of the entire\nU.S. Senate suggested the proposition that ICJ decisions\nmight be independently enforceable. Nobody discussing\nthat understood it that way.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Once again, there is a\nconstitutional problem, is there not, if they are\nautomatically enforceable?\nMR. CRUZ: Absolutely.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That is conferring upon the\nICJ the responsibility to decide the meaning of a United\nStates treaty which is United States law.\nMR. CRUZ: And --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I'm rather jealous of that\npower.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I think it belongs in this\nCourt. And when you have a non-self-executing treaty,\nthere is no problem.\nIt becomes U.S. law when the Senate and the\nHouse pass a law which the president -- it doesn't\nbecome U.S. law because the President writes a\nmemorandum to his Attorney General, but it does become\nU.S. law when a law is enacted.\nMR. CRUZ: And that --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That solves the\nconstitutional problem, but in the situation we're\ntalking about here, I don't know on what basis we can\nallow some international court to decide what is the\nresponsibility of this Court, which is the meaning of\nthe United States law.\nMR. CRUZ: Justice Scalia, that's absolutely\ncorrect.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And how does the WTO\ndiffer?\nMR. CRUZ: The imperative --\nJUSTICE BREYER: How does the WTO and NAFTA\nand all our trade agreements differ?\nMR. CRUZ: The WTO and NAFTA -- I mean NAFTA\nis not a treaty. It's a congressional agreement, but it\nis also adjudicating specific factual questions that\ndeal with the application of facts to a particular\ncircumstance. It's not interpreting the treaty and\npurporting to bind the United States on this is what the\nunderlying Federal law means.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And the United States\napparently accepts the verdict of those --\nMR. CRUZ: Right. Right. And it could\nchoose not to.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: You have three different\nthings that you have to tell us about today: That the\nPresident's authority, the effect of the ICJ, and -- and\nthe Avena judgment, and ultimately, the force of the\nVienna Convention itself.\nAnd the only question I have that I need\nyour help with is as to the last, and I hope that it\ndoesn't interrupt the train of your argument.\nI think the ICJ -- pardon me, the Vienna\nConvention is self-executing, in that it requires the\nStates to conform to the consular notification\nprovision.\nMR. CRUZ: And we don't disagree with that.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose you have a judge\nwho has control over a defendant who's being held in\ncustody pending trial, and the defendant says I want to\nsee my -- my foreign counsel. The judge says no. Can\nyou mandate that -- assuming State procedures allow him\nin, couldn't you mandate that judge to require him to\nallow the notification to take place?\nMR. CRUZ: The consequence of the argument\nthat it doesn't create individual rights would mean that\nthat individual defendant could not raise it in that --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: You see where I'm going?\nMR. CRUZ: Yes.\nAnd so in that circumstance, it would mean,\nif a judge declined to comply with that obligation, the\nindividual defendant would not have an appealable legal\nerror.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: If I thought he did, would\nI still have to rule against you?\nMR. CRUZ: No, not at all. In fact, just as\nthis Court did in Breard and Sanchez-Llamas, it assumes\nthat the Vienna Convention created individual rights.\nAnd so we don't need to prevail on that to reach the\nidentical outcome. Because even assuming we are\nincorrect concerning individual rights, the\nSanchez-Llamas holding is that procedural default\nrespects those rights just as fully as it respects\nconstitutional rights.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Could I make a distinction\nbetween failing to let him see the counsel at all in my\nhypothetical and a demand that the procedural framework\nbe altered? Isn't there a distinction between those two\ncases, do you think?\nMR. CRUZ: I think that's right. I think\nalso in your hypothetical, your hypothetical assumes a -\na deliberate violation of the law which no one suggests\nhere rather than inadvertence. And inadvertence\ncomplied with, as you suggested earlier, no prejudice\nwhatever so. And there has -- both the Federal and\nState courts that looked at this concluded that there\nwas no even arguable prejudice from the violation.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Cruz --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Cruz, could I go back\nto your discussion of whether this is a judgment or not?\nIt seems to me some of your reasons actually go to\nwhether the -- whether it was a correct interpretation\nof the treaty. And if it were a judgment, would you\nagree that this Court would have to accept it, even if\nthis Court disagreed with its legal analysis?\nMR. CRUZ: Justice Stevens, I would not,\nbecause I do not believe consistent with Article III\nthis Court's authority can be given away by treaty.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: How is it given away to a\ntreaty if it just says one State court must honor a\njudgment of a sister State even if it thinks it's dead\nwrong? Is it giving away its judicial authority by\nobeying the Full Faith and Credit Clause?\nMR. CRUZ: That is provided by the\nConstitution. And in this instance, giving any other\nentity, the authority to make a conclusive determination\nof Federal law, that goes to the heart of the Article\nIII power.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Are you saying that even\n--\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Even if it was agreed by\ntreaty to give it conclusive effect?\nMR. CRUZ: If the Senate agreed that this\nwas self-executing, then you would have the height of\nthe Presidency and Congress working together. But even\nin that situation, I would submit as a matter of\nseparation of powers, they could not give this Court's\nessential role, under Marbury, to say what the law is to\nanother body.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Then we couldn't have a\ntreaty with another country on the mutual recognition\nand enforcement of judgment, because the other country\nmight get it wrong, we might disagree with its\ninterpretation of the law, and, therefore, unlike the\nrest of the world, the United States can't get the\nadvantage of a reciprocal guarantee that our judgments\nwill be respected, and in turn we will respect your\njudgment.\nMR. CRUZ: In enforcing foreign judgments,\nthe foreign court is not purporting to make a definitive\ndetermination of U.S. law.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: It may be that if the\ncase turns on a question of U.S. law, and we may think,\nas many think about the ICJ, that they got that question\nwrong. Still, it's always been if you don't look behind\nthe judgment. You say in the next case I'm certainly\nnot going to apply that wrong interpretation. But here\nI'm bound by a judgment.\nAnd that's why I questioned your use -- your\nheavy use of Sanchez-Llamas. I agreed with the court in\nthat case because it was a question of interpretation.\nWe don't have to agree with the ICJ. We were not faced\nwith a decision, a binding adjudication, which we accept\nfor that case only. So there's a difference between\nSanchez-Llamas and this case that you appear not to\nrecognize in your brief.\nMR. CRUZ: Justice Ginsburg, it has been the\nconsistent position of the United States for over four\ndecades from the day this treaty was ratified that the\nOptional Protocol was not self-executing, was not\nenforceable in U.S. courts. So it is not a judgment\nthat has -- were this Court to treat it as -- as a\njudgment, it would be making that treaty self-executing.\nAnd the power to transform a non- --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought you said\nthat -- oh, you said that this is a matter of goodwill\nor that most ICJ judgments -- ICJ judgments, they're not\nbinding but people comply -- nations comply with them as\na matter of goodwill?\nMR. CRUZ: Justice Ginsburg, that's exactly\ncorrect. And the President had a number of\nconstitutional means at his disposal to comply, had he\nchosen. The -- but --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What could -- other\nthan -- I mean, the most logical place to have this go\non is the court that rendered the judgment. It's always\nbetter for the court that rendered the judgment than\nsome foreign court or another State court.\nSo what else could the President do? The\nICJ did say U.S., as a matter of your own choosing. And\nthe President chose the most logical forum, but what\nelse could he have done?\nMR. CRUZ: There are three avenues that the\nPresident could have chosen that would have been\nconstitutional. The first of which he could have gone\nto Congress and proposed a statute amending the AEDPA to\nallow Federal habeas review.\nThe second is he could have negotiated a\ntreaty, submitted it --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Let's start with the\nfirst one. Why should this case be in Federal court?\nIt's a state judgment that's in question.\nMR. CRUZ: This Court has made clear that\nthe Federal Government cannot expand the jurisdiction of\nthe State courts. There is a State --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But you can have the\nFederal court overseeing the State court and telling the\nState what to do? That seems to me practically much\nmore of an encroachment on State authority than to say,\nState courts, you do it.\nMR. CRUZ: Well, and --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- or to say Federal\ncourts, you do it.\nMR. CRUZ: A corollary --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: A lot of people think\nthat's exactly right, that really we expanded Federal\nhabeas jurisdiction quite improperly. But it happens\nevery day, doesn't it?\nMR. CRUZ: It does. And a corollary to this\nis if Congress could pass a statute creating a Federal\nright to review, and that Federal right to review under\nthe principles of Testa versus Katt would have to be\nrespected in the State court.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Who would be doing the\nreview?\nMR. CRUZ: Well, if it were a Federal right\nto review, under Testa versus Katt, both the State and\nFederal courts would give review. Interestingly enough,\nif it were a new Federal right, it would clear the\njurisdictional bar because the Texas jurisdictional bar\nallows an exception for a new law. So if Congress\npassed a new law that would be jurisdiction to raise --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: A law passed by Congress\nsaying Texas dispense with your procedural bar rules?\nMR. CRUZ: A law passed by Congress saying\nin order to give effect to the Avena judgments the 51\nMexican nationals at issue shall be entitled to review\nand reconsideration of whether there was prejudice from\nthe denial of the Vienna Convention. That law would be\nrespected equally.\nI would suggest that Testa versus Katt,\nwhich Petitioner uses, is a case which powerfully\nsupports Texas, because the principle of Testa versus\nKatt was there is one Federal law that must be applied\nequally in Federal courts and State courts. And the\nState courts are not at liberty to ignore Federal law.\nThis is a very curious assertion of\npresidential power. Because the presidential power is\nnot directed at the Federal courts. It is directed at\nthe State courts,and the State courts alone. And I\nwould submit is the only instance I'm aware of, of a\nFederal mandate that falls only on the states, singles\nout the states, and commandeers those judges.\nIn over 200 years of our nation's history\nI'm not aware of any other directive from the President\ndirectly to the State courts and State judges.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So what's absent in your\nview is Congress. You say that all of this could have\nbeen done --\nMR. CRUZ: Absolutely --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- and Texas could have\nbeen ordered, but the President doesn't have the\nauthority to do it just on the basis of the ICJ,\nMR. CRUZ: And Justice Ginsburg, I think a\npowerful parallel is the decision of this Court last\nnear in Hamdan. In Hamdan the President was at the\nheight of his war powers authority. And nonetheless,\nthis Court concluded that he could not act contrary to\nthe will of Congress.\nHere his interests are far less than\nprosecuting war, and yet he is asserting the authority\nto go it alone, despite a consistent stream of\ncongressional disapproval, both in ratifying these\ntreaties and saying they're not self-executing and also\nin passing the AEDPA.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The not self-executing in\nthe position of the State Department, wasn't there -- in\nthe parallel proceedings in Oklahoma, wasn't there a\nletter from the current -- the then current legal\nadviser telling Oklahoma that this is a judgment that's\nbinding on all courts in the United States, State and\nFederal, and that the President has directed Oklahoma to\ncomply? I think that was sent both to the governor and\nthe other officials.\nMR. CRUZ: This letter was sent out to all\naffected States, but it is -- the United States is quite\ncandid in what they are doing. The department to its\ncredit describes it as \"unprecedented,\" and it goes\nfurther, if I may read a portion of page 5 of the memo,\nor memo page 6, rather: The President's memorandum is\nsufficient to create a binding legal rule.\nThe department is not hiding what they're\narguing. They're not arguing the treaties require it.\nThey're not arguing any statutes requiring it. They're\nsaying a two-paragraph memorandum from the President to\na member of the cabinet is binding Federal law.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Which -- which letter are\nyou quoting? Are you quoting --\nMR. CRUZ: I'm quoting the United States'\nbrief in this proceeding, page 6 of the brief. On page\n5 it also describes the President's power as\n\"establishing binding rules of decisions that preempt\ncontrary State law.\"\nIf that is correct, there is no reason why\nthe President could not have directed his memorandum to\nthe Federal district courts or even to this Court, and\nthat is an extraordinarily broad power to be asserted on\nbehalf of the executive.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Cruz, you have\nfrequently emphasized the non-self-executing character\nof the optional protocol.\nIs there any rule, any positive rule in\nexistence today either of international law or domestic\nlaw that precludes this Court from being the\nimplementing authority as opposed to the executive or\nthe executive and the Senate?\nMR. CRUZ: This Court has the final\nauthority to determine what Federal law is, and so if\nthis Court determines that that's what the treaty\nrequires, then that be federal law. Now I would suggest\nthat would require overruling --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: These treaties including\nthe optional protocol.\nMR. CRUZ: In my judgment, if the Court\nreached that conclusion it would be error. But --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I think you misunderstood.\nI thought he was asking whether if it is -- assuming it\nis not self-executing, this Court can execute it.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: That's right. Yeah.\nMR. CRUZ: In my judgment it would be wholly\nillegitimate for the Court to do so.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Why?\nMR. CRUZ: Because --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: What's the rule -- what is\nthe positive rule of international and domestic law that\nprecludes it?\nMR. CRUZ: The rule is a constitutional\nrule, that the President makes treaties the Senate\nadvises and consents. And the limitation --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: They've made the treaty.\nWe have got the optional protocol. Whatever the\noptional protocol means is Federal law.\nMR. CRUZ: The limitations the Senate put on\nare it as much a part of the treaty as the treaty\nitself, and the consequences --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But you're -- my point is,\nmy -- I'm accepting as premise of the question the\nlimitation which you assert, i.e., non-self-executing;\nand my question is, may the execution, if you will, be\nmade by this Court? Is there an independent rule that\nprecludes this Court from that role?\nMR. CRUZ: If this Court did so, in my\njudgment it would be usurping the role of Congress. All\nright? Because the essence of the decision --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I don't mean to be\ndisrespectful of your judgment but what do you base it\non -- tradition?\nMR. CRUZ: The essence of the decision by\nthe Senate to say something is non-self-executing is to\nsay if something in this treaty is going to change U.S.\ndomestic law, you have to come back to us.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: You're saying by -- by\nnon-self-executing, they mean you have to come back to\nus? The terms --\nMR. CRUZ: That's exactly what it means. If\nyou want to change U.S. law, come to Congress.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: They mean it does not\nautomatically become part of United States law.\nMR. CRUZ: Indeed.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And it follows from that,\nthat you have to change United States law?\nMR. CRUZ: Exactly.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And it is not the function\nof this Court to change United States law.\nMR. CRUZ: That's precisely correct.\nJUSTICE BREYER: If you assume it is\nself-executing, just for one second, I'd like to find\nout -- you said that the President was unreasonable in a\nsense of saying Texas do that over again --\nI assume the reason he asked Texas to have\nthe hearing is because the ICJ knew -- and I guess maybe\nhe knew -- that the only hearing they'd had on this\nsubject -- as far as I can see; I looked at it, there\ndidn't seem to be any evidence in respect to their\nfinding that there was no prejudice. They said well, he\nhad a lawyer, but that lawyer later got into quite a lot\nof trouble, I think.\nMR. CRUZ: He had two lawyers.\nJUSTICE BREYER: He had two lawyers. One\ngot into trouble, and the other didn't?\nMR. CRUZ: And they vigorously defended him.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay, they vigorously\ndefended him.\nMR. CRUZ: The only argument --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Fine. Fine. My point is\nthere's no evidence of that.\nMR. CRUZ: With respect, Justice Breyer,\nthere actually is.\nJUSTICE BREYER: There is? In the first\nhabeas hearing?\nMR. CRUZ: The evidence there is --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I read the whole thing.\nMR. CRUZ: In our appendix there is an\naffidavit from the Mexican Consulate. Once the Mexican\nConsulate started assisting Medellin, they prepared an\naffidavit, and the affidavit said if we had been\ncontacted, we would have told you not to confess; and we\nwould have told you to get a lawyer. The problem with\nthat is Medellin confessed within about three hours of\nbeing arrested, and even the ICJ in Avena said that\nnotification had to occur within 72 hours.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What I'm thinking of is the\nevidence at the first habeas hearing that led the\ndistrict judge to reach his conclusion that there was no\nprejudice and that the procedural default was not\nexcused -- it's in that hearing that I didn't see what\nthat finding was based on; and I suppose the reason that\nthe President wanted Texas to do it is it would be\neasiest for Texas to go back to that.\nMR. CRUZ: Justice Breyer -- it was part of\nthe State court record, and it was the basis for saying\nthere was no prejudice.\nJUSTICE BREYER: It was in the first\nhearing.\nMR. CRUZ: I believe it was. And it's\nincluded in our appendix four.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So you think there was no\nreason for the ICJ to ask the President --\nMR. CRUZ: It is difficult to explain.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Was the basis for\nthe determination of no prejudice the fact that the\nPetitioner in this case had received full Miranda\nwarnings, which went beyond what the consulate was going\nto tell him?\nMR. CRUZ: That is completely correct, and\nhe waived those in writing.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And he had lived in this\ncountry for how long?\nMR. CRUZ: Practically his entire life.\nWrote and read English and was educated in American\npublic schools.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And what did happen to the\nlawyers Texas gave him?\nMR. CRUZ: Both of them vigorously defended\nhim, and in Medellin we devoted several pages of our\nbrief to going through in considerable detail the many\nmotions they filed. It was a vigorous defense, and yet\nthey failed to raise this particular --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And so they have -- the\nTexas Court of Criminal Appeals didn't adopt a simple\nsolution of the case, to say He got all the protection;\nthat there's no prejudice and therefore there's no\ntreaty violation.\nMR. CRUZ: The Texas Court of Criminal\nAppeals didn't have it as option to say, it would have\nbeen easier, one might say, to just go along. The\nPresident is asking you to do this, make the whole thing\ngo away; just go along. The problem is the Texas Court\nof Criminal Appeals had a statute, and a statute that\ndivested of jurisdiction unless there is new Federal\nlaw.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, but that statute\nreally would not have divested -- if I understand he\nTexas law correctly -- if you did agree -- which you\ndon't, I know -- that there was a preexisting Federal\nobligation to honor judgments of the ICJ, then under\nTesta v Katt principle and Howlett opinion and others,\nthe Texas court would have had jurisdiction.\nMR. CRUZ: Although that holding would be, I\nwould suggest, in considerable tension if not directly\ncontrary to Sanchez-Llamas.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, but Sanchez-Llamas\ndoesn't deal with the judgment. And It says a separate\nFederal obligation --\nMR. CRUZ: Oregon is as much a part of the\nUnited States as Texas.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Then I think the Texas --\nthere would be jurisdiction in the Texas court to\nentertain this claim. I think you -- you agree with\nthat?\nMR. CRUZ: I do not, because it has to be a\nnew claim, and if this were a judgment, the judgment --\nPLAINTIFF'S CO-COUNSEL: It would be a new\nclaim based on a new judgment which was after Sanchez --\nthe Chief Justice's opinion in that case.\nMR. CRUZ: Let me point out one consequence\nof -- of the President's assertion of authority.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, I'm -- you just\n-- for -- putting the President's assertion to one side,\nit seems to me if you did agree -- and I know you\nvigorously don't -- that there were a pre-existing\nFederal obligation -- an obligation of the United States\nto respect the judgment of the ICJ, which is -- which we\nthink is wrong as a matter of international law; we have\npreviously construed the treaties to the contrary -- but\nif there were an independent obligation to expect --\nFederal obligation -- respect that judgment, it seems to\nme that that obligation could be enforced in Federal\ncourt.\nMR. CRUZ: I don't disagree with that,\nJustice Stevens.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: You don't.\nMR. CRUZ: If -- although I disagree with\nthe premise.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yes.\nMR. CRUZ: But if the premise were true, I\ndon't disagree with the conclusion.\nThe statute allows jurisdiction where there\nis a new legal basis that was not previously\navailability. The only two potential sources of that\nare Avena, which we submit is a non-self-executing\ninternational law obligation, or the President's order;\nand, in fact, it is worth underscoring if the United\nStates' theory is correct, there's no reason why the\nPresident needed to wait for a decision from the ICJ.\nIf the President has the authority to take a\nnon-self-executive international law treaty and order it\nto be implemented and set aside any State law to the\ncontrary --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, there is. We have\ninterpreted the law, and we have said as far as what\nArticle 36 means, we disagree with the ICJ.\nMR. CRUZ: I agree with you, Justice\nGinsburg, but the United States does not. The United\nStates believes that the President has the authority to\nmake decisions and to implement treaties -- an\nindependent authority to create new binding law, even\nthough the obligation is not self-executing.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: How many parties to\nAvena -- there were 51 -- are being held in the State of\nTexas?\nMR. CRUZ: There are 51. There were 15 in\nthe State of Texas. There are now 14 because 1 was\nunder the age of 18, so is now off of death row; 51 in 9\nStates across the country.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And Oklahoma has taken\nthe opposite position, and they -- they did give the\nreview and reconsideration?\nMR. CRUZ: That's correct.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And has any other State\nacted?\nMR. CRUZ: Not that we're aware of, no.\nThere have -- the 51 -- my understanding is it's down to\n44. For various reasons these individuals are not on\ndeath row but, other than Oklahoma, not related to the\nAvena decision.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, the fact that\nthey're on -- on death row isn't at all significant\nbecause the judgment of the ICJ purports to vacate the\nconvictions as well; isn't that correct?\nMR. CRUZ: That's exactly right; and, in\nfact, in Paragraph 34 of Avena it asserted the authority\nto annul U.S. criminal convictions. So some of the\nhypotheticals coming from bench, under the ICJ --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought the ICJ flatly\nrefused Mexican -- Mexico said ICJ annulled the\njudgment. The ICJ said no, and it didn't vacate it,\neither. It just said that it did a reconsideration to\nsee whether there was prejudice.\nMR. CRUZ: Justice Ginsburg, you're correct\nthey did not order the annulment. But in paragraph 34\nthey asserted they could order the annulment. They\nsimply were choosing --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm looking at page\n--\nMR. CRUZ: -- not to in this case.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm looking at page\n186. They require review and reconsideration of the\nconviction and sentence.\nMR. CRUZ: That's correct. So it is not\njust the sentence; and, in fact, they, despite the fact\nthat their statute does not allow them to have precedent\nin any other cases, they said in paragraph 151:\nThe fact that the Court's ruling concerned\nonly Mexican nationals cannot be taken to imply the\nconclusion reached in the present judgment do not apply\nto other foreign nationals finding themselves in\nsituations. They were in an unprecedented act recording\nthe authority to bind U. S. Courts in a way, to the best\nof my knowledge, no --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Their very own statute,\nthe statute setting up the ICJ, makes it clear that is\nnot the case. They can issue a binding judgment in the\nparticular case. It has no precedential effect for\nother cases, not even within the ICJ.\nMR. CRUZ: But they can issue a decision\nthat can be enforced by the Security Council. And had\nthey issued --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Has that ever happened?\nMR. CRUZ: It has gone -- for example, in\nthe Nicaragua case, there was an effort to take it to\nthe Security Council there.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And the U.S. exercised\nits veto.\nMR. CRUZ: Correct. And that's part of a\ndiplomatic treaty, where it's between nations is -- is\nthat it is not binding in the sense that the domestic\ncourts will enforce it.\nIndeed, if the ICJ had asserted the power it\nclaimed to annul U.S. convictions, under the U.S.'s\ntheory the President presumably could have issued an\norder effectively pardoning State prisoners despite the\nfact that the Constitution limits its pardon authority\nto Federal crimes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Cruz.\nMr. Donovan, you have five minutes.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT BY DONALD F. DONOVAN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. DONOVAN: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nFirst, there is nothing in the ratification\nhistory that suggests that Avena made any assumptions\nabout whether or not the Optional Protocol would be\nself-executing. The Connally Amendment went to the\ncompulsory jurisdiction of the ICJ, and the discussion\nto which Texas has referred is entirely about the\ninternational ramifications.\nIn fact, the Senate specifically declined to\napply the Connally Amendment to the Optional Protocol.\nSo that gets to the question that we have been\ndiscussing here, which is:\nWhat is the scope of the enforceability of\nan ICJ judgment? There are obviously constraints to\nthat. One is illustrated by the Chief Justice's\nhypothetical. That is, there are affirmative\nconstraints in the Constitution, itself.\nThe second is illustrated by a point I made,\nbut Mr. Cruz misunderstood, which is that the nature of\nthe obligation emanating from the judgment is directed\nat a constitutional branch such as the obligation to\nenforce an active statute. Obviously, that is not\nenforceable in court.\nIf the nature of the obligation is to cease\nhostilities, that is obviously directed to the President\nand is not enforceable in court. And that's illustrated\nby the Nicaragua case in which the ICJ issued a\njudgment. Congress passed a statute that said it wasn't\ngoing to comply; and the President said he wasn't going\nto comply.\nThat, in turn, applies to the third\nconstraint, which is the political constraint, itself.\nThe Nicaragua case illustrates that if the ICJ issues a\njudgment that the United States does not want to comply\nwith, Congress can pass a statute to say we repudiate\nthe obligation.\nSo the obligations that we are talking about\nhere in which the ICJ judgment would be enforceable by\nan individual fall squarely in the class of cases that\nthis Court has decided for two centuries where an\nindividual has a right conferred by the statute.\nAnd he walked into a court, and he asked\nthat court to enforce that right, and he invokes that\nright in -- as in the Caffa core case, the Roucher case,\ncases going back to the founding.\nAnd this Court has said when the right is of\na nature to be enforced in a court of justice, this\nCourt will enforce it. And that is all Mr. Medellin is\nasserting here: The right to enforce a right that is\neminently suitable for judicial enforcement because it\ngoes to the judicial process, itself.\nThe second point with respect to Article\nIII: It cannot be the case that this Court can never\nenforce -- gives away its Article III authority when\nsomebody else enforces a judgment. We know from the\nComegys and the Abba cases that we have cited that the\nCourt has in fact said that when the U.S. submits a case\nto international adjudication that international\nadjudication is binding and it's not reexaminable in a\nU.S. court.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I read the Comegys\ncase, however you say it, to be for the exact opposite\nproposition. There they were saying, this is an\ninternational arbitration, there's no reason to go\nbehind it.\nBut the question of whether or not that\narbitration is binding in the bankruptcy proceeding that\nwas at issue there was very much one for the U.S.\nSupreme Court to make.\nMR. DONOVAN: But that's because that was\nnot part of what the court had actually decided, or\nrather that the international adjudication had actually\ndecided. You think about, if the proposition is that\nnobody else but an Article III court can decide a\nFederal question, this Court could not have decided\nMitsubishi. In Mitsubishi the Court sent Federal\nstatute antitrust claims to an arbitration panel in\nTokyo and said that the result would be everyone\nforcible so long as the panel actually took cognizance\nof the claim and actually decided it.\nThis Court if it evaluated the claim that\nMr. Medellin is entitled to review and reconsideration\nas a result of the treaty obligation under 94-1 and the\nPresident's determination that that treaty obligation\nwill be given effect, this Court would be performing a\nsupremely judicial function, that is it would be\ninterpreting and applying Federal law in the form of a\nstatute, which is exactly what the Supremacy Clause\nrequests the Court to do.\nWith respect to --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Put precisely, it would be\nmaking it Federal law and then applying it. If you\nassume it's not self-executing, somebody has to make it\nto domestic law. Now, Congress can obviously do it by\npassing a law.\nBut you're saying the Court can do it, can\nmake it dmestic law and then enforce it.\nMR. DONOVAN: That assumes thatit is not\nself-executing, yes. But the whole question here is --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, yes, ys.\nMR. DONOVAN: -- when we're talking about\nself-executing here we're saying what branch is the\nobligation directed to. And what the Court has said\ntime and time again is when the obligation is of a\nnature to be enforced in a court of justice it is\ndirected to the judicial authority.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Then what you are saying if\nI understand you is that Justice Scalia was wrong when\nhe said that would be making it Federal law. I think\nyou were saying that would be a -- the branch that was\nresponsible for determining how to execute, i.e., to\napply, Federal law. Is that your point?\nMR. DONOVAN: That's exactly right. The\nthing that makes the treaty Federal law is not the\nCourt; it's the Supremacy Clause, which makes it supreme\nFederal law.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What is the\nauthority -- I get back to where I started. I\nunderstood you to concede that we would have authority\nto construe the judgment if it provided, for example,\nfor a punitive sanction against the officers. What is\nthe basis under your theory for that authority?\nMR. DONOVAN: Well, it's settled that a\ntreaty cannot contravene an affirmative constitutional\nobligation. There would be -- if there was -- if the\nICJ --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But it can -- it can\ncontravene our interpretation of the treaty as a matter\nof Federal law.\nMR. DONOVAN: There are two different treaty\nobligations. There's a treaty obligation under the\nVienna Convention, which this court has now\ndispositively interpreted, and there's a treaty\nobligation to comply. And it's the very nature of an\nobligation to put a dispute to a third party that you\nmay not agree with the result, and that does not in any\nway compromise this Court's Article III authority to\nrest that judgment on an obligation committed to by the\npolitical branches, three treaties ratified by the\nPresident and Senate that said when this country commits\nitself to do something we're going to do it. Now we\nhave the President of the United States saying that it's\nin the paramount interests of the United States for\npurposes of enforcing --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do we have the\nauthority to interpret the judgment of the ICJ?\nMR. DONOVAN: The courts in enforcing that\njudgment would. Of course that would be part of the\njudicial enterprise. The applicable instrument is now\nthe Avena judgment, pursuant to the treaties and the\nPresident's determination, independent sources. In\napplying that judgment, there may well be interpretive\nquestions because the Avena judgment lays down standards\nand requires obligations and that would be part of the\njudicial enterprise.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So we have the\nauthority to interpret it, we have the authority to\nconstrue whether it's carry to the Constitution, but we\ndo not the authority to consider whether it's consistent\nwith Federal law?\nMR. DONOVAN: That's right, because that's\nthe very nature of enforcing a judgment: You do not\nre-examine the merits. You take the judgment and you\nenforce the judgment. And it's the judicial enterprise\nto construe what that -- it may be a question about\nconstruing that -- what that instrument requires, what\nthat judgment requires. But it's the judicial function\nin enforcing that judgment that calls upon this Article\n-- the Court's Article III authority, and does not in\nany way compromise it, which in turn goes to the\nquestion about what the judgment requires. It requires\nprospective review and reconsideration. The Texas court\ndidn't suggest that Mr. Medellin had received review and\nreconsideration. The ICJ made it clear that it had to\nbe prospective, and one of the fundamental reasons for\nthat is because the judgment says that the treaty rights\nhave to be determined on it own. Mr. Medellin is\nentitled to show that the violation of the treaty\nstanding on its own two feet and not filtered through a\nconstitutional right affected -- that he is entitled to\nshow prejudicie.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Donovan.\nMR. DONOVAN: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The case is\nsubmitted.\n(Whereupon, at 11:30 a.m., the case in the\nabove-entitled matter was submitted.)\n87:7 adjudications 78:8
