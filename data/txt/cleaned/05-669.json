LAMKEN\nON BEHALF OF PETITIONER\nMR. LAMKEN: Thank you, Justice Stevens, and may\nit please the Court:\nSection 2415(a) established a limitations period\nfor every action for money damages by the Government which\nis founded on any contract. That provision, by its terms,\napplies to every contract action, every adversary\nadjudication seeking monetary compensation for breach,\nwhether pursued before a court or an agency.\nThe contention that every action encompasses\nonly civil actions or judicial actions is incorrect for\nthree reasons. First, it is inconsistent with the broad\nlanguage that Congress used. It is inconsistent with the\nstatutory structure, in that it renders another provision,\nthe exception for administrative offset, totally\nsuperfluous. It also creates an irrationality in the\nhierarchy of the Government's claims. Finally, it robs\nSection 2415(a) of its intended effect.\nTurning to the text, Congress\nand agencies regularly use the term \"action\" to refer to\nadversary adjudications before administrative agencies and\nbefore the judiciary. The term --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: What --\nMR. LAMKEN: -- denotes --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: May I ask you, on that point --\nI understand what you're saying, and I've looked at your\nauthority, but, right in the provision itself, there is a\nverbal distinction made between actions for money damages,\nand what, at the end of the provision, they refer to as\n\"administrative proceedings\" in providing for the 1-year\nsupplementary rule. Doesn't the statute, in effect, say,\n\"We don't mean, by 'action,' what we would possibly --\nwhat possibly might be included as an administrative\nproceeding\"? If they had wanted an administrative\nproceeding to be a subset of the actions for money\ndamages, wouldn't it have been sensible for Congress to\nsay in -- to refer, instead of to \"administrative\nproceedings,\" to \"administrative actions\"?\nMR. LAMKEN: Well, in fact, the -- it refers to\n\"administrative proceedings required by contract or law.\"\nAnd that clause applies in the particular circumstance\nwhere a law or a contract requires some sort of\nadministrative proceeding as a condition precedent to the\naction for money damages. So, if you can bring your\nmoney-damages action without any prior administrative\nproceeding, regardless of where you bring --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I think your point has to be\nthat there are administrative proceedings that are not\nactions.\nMR. LAMKEN: That is absolutely correct.\nNonadversarial administrative proceedings would,\nthemselves, not be actions.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Right.\nMR. LAMKEN: And they also wouldn't be money-\ndamages actions. So, the distinction the statute draws is\nnot between money-damages actions in court and money-\ndamages actions before agencies; it's before money-damages\nactions, wherever brought, and the administrative\nproceedings that have to be brought as a condition\nprecedent.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You contend that what commenced\nthe action here was the order demanding payment.\nMR. LAMKEN: That is correct. That is the --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's a very weird\ncommencement of an action, where what then follows is what\nis referred to as an \"appeal,\" within the agency.\nMR. LAMKEN: For historical reasons, the\ndenominations are quite strange, but for Grisa, quoted --\non subsections 1702 and 1724, quoted on pages 5 and 6 of\nour reply brief, specifically state that the order to pay\ncommences the proceedings. And so, since that is the --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Which says that?\nMR. LAMKEN: It's on page 5-6 of our brief.\nIt's Section 1702 of our --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What page of your brief?\nMR. LAMKEN: 5 and 6 of the reply brief.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Of the reply.\nMR. LAMKEN: Yes. And it's 13 U.S.C. 1724, and\nit talks -- or it defines the \"demand\" as the order to\npay. And then, the definitional provisions, in turn --\nwhen they're talking about what commences the action, it\nsays that the order to pay \"commences\" the action. And so\n--\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I'm not finding it. Where is\nit, again?\nMR. LAMKEN: Page 6 of the reply, Your Honor,\nvery top. The citation says \"13 U.S.C. 1724(b), emphasis\nadded.\" It defines \"demand\" to include an order to pay\nissued by the Secretary. And, in the next line down, we\nsay, \"For Grisa thus recognizes that the so-call order to\npay, far from concluding the action, in fact, commences\nit,\" because the statute of limitations prepared -- uses\nthe word \"commenced\" to describe what the action -- the\norder to pay does.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why is -- why doesn't it make\nmuch more sense -- as I understand the proceeding, this\norder doesn't come out of the blue. As required, there\nhas to be a letter to the -- to the payee saying, \"We\nthink -- we think you owe so much money.\" He is allowed\nto respond, right?\nMR. LAMKEN: That --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And then, after considering the\nresponse, the order issues. Now, I would consider that a\n-- you know, an -- that sounds to me like a complaint and\nan opportunity to respond to it. And then, finally, the\nfirst decision of the agency, which is then appealed --\nand CFR provides for an -- what he calls an appeal. And\nit seems to me the final opinion of the agency is the\nopinion on the appeal.\nMR. LAMKEN: In fact, that process, which isn't\neven mentioned in the regulations, doesn't have any legal\noperative effect. It's more like a demand letter. If the\nlessee doesn't respond to the letter, he doesn't waive any\nof his rights. If the Government fails to include a claim\nin its demand letter, in the -- well, in the audit letter\n-- it doesn't waive any of its rights. The --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it doesn't --\nMR. LAMKEN: -- first document --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- waive it, but it can't issue\nthe order without having issued the letter first, giving --\nMR. LAMKEN: I --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- giving the party an\nopportunity to say why this amount isn't owed.\nMR. LAMKEN: Well, in fact, there's nothing in\nthe regulations -- and I think the Solicitor General would\nconcede -- that actually requires this informal process.\nIt happens to be typically done. And the SG uses the word\n\"typically\" in the brief. But there's nothing that\nrequires it. And if you don't respond, there are no\nconsequences to failure to respond.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Is there anything that requires\nthe order?\nMR. LAMKEN: The -- anything that requires the\nSecretary to proceed by order?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes.\nMR. LAMKEN: That is the Secretary's traditional\nway of doing things --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well --\nMR. LAMKEN: -- yes, but --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So, you could say the same for\nthe other.\nMR. LAMKEN: Oh, but it -- but there is no\nliability if the order fails to issue. The order, if it\nwere the first salvo, you still would be required to\nrespond. And so, your failure to respond is very much a\ndefault. The failure to respond to the letter, the audit\nletter, has no legal operative effect --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You don't -- you don't -- but\nyou don't respond to the order; you take an appeal from\nthe order.\nMR. LAMKEN: That's correct. You file a --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It seems to me crazy to call\nthat order a complaint. I -- even if I grant your other\nargument, that an administrative proceeding can be\ncommenced by a complaint -- or that the term \"complaint\"\ncan apply to administrative proceedings, I don't think\nthat what you've hung your hat on here -- namely, the\norder -- seems to me to fit that description.\nMR. LAMKEN: Well, Justice Scalia, it is the\nfirst document, which is recognized in the regulations,\nwhich provides the lessor of the notice of claims against\nit, the first one that's required by the regulations in\norder to commence the proceedings.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: You mean --\nMR. LAMKEN: It's recognized --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- the regulations don't refer\nto the initial letter?\nMR. LAMKEN: No. They don't -- the regulations\ndon't require this informal process. It's typically done\n--\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So, they literally could start,\nabsolutely out of the blue, by issuing the order?\nMR. LAMKEN: I think that's correct. That is\nthe way that it could be done. There's an informal\nprocess that's typically followed; but you could ignore\nit, and there's no legal operative effect. So, that --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I doubt whether --\nMR. LAMKEN: -- informal process --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- that would --\nMR. LAMKEN: -- can't be a complaint.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I doubt whether that would\nconform with the Administrative Procedure Act. I mean,\neither -- even at the first level of agency decision --\nMR. LAMKEN: Well --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- it seems to me you have to\ngive the individual an opportunity to reply.\nMR. LAMKEN: Well, that is perhaps why the\nagency tries this -- to do the informal process. But, in\nfact, it does not have legal operative effect. There --\nyou could completely ignore that initial demand letter,\nand say, \"Sorry, Agency, I'm not responding.\" The agency\nthen files its order. And that's the first time you must\nregister your defenses, upon failure or forfeiture --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Of course you can ignore it.\nThat doesn't prove anything. You could ignore an agency\ncomplaint, too --\nMR. LAMKEN: Right.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- I mean, a formal complaint,\nin which case you'll be found liable. What does --\nMR. LAMKEN: That's the --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- the fact that you don't have\nto respond have to do with anything?\nMR. LAMKEN: The legal consequences. It's\nexactly right, Justice Scalia. If you don't respond to\nthe demand letter, there are no legal consequences. If\nyou don't respond to the letter by filing what's called an\n\"appeal,\" you lose. And so, it's just like a complaint;\nyou default if you fail to raise your defenses at that\npoint. In addition, Section 2415 --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And it's also, I assume, true\nthat the demand letter would not toll a statute.\nMR. LAMKEN: No, we don't believe a demand\nletter would toll a statute, because it's not required by\n--\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you --\nMR. LAMKEN: -- by law.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- you'd win in this case even\nif it did. I don't think that the difference between the\ninitial letter giving you an opportunity to reply, and the\n-- what you call the \"complaint,\" the order -- that time\nperiod doesn't put you out of -- out of the permissible\nperiod.\nMR. LAMKEN: Oh, I certainly hope --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Right.\nMR. LAMKEN: -- hope not.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes.\nMR. LAMKEN: But, in fact, Section 2415(f),\nwhich is on page 4 and 5 of the appendix to our brief,\nmakes it clear that whether something is denominated a\ncomplaint or not does not determine whether or not it's\ncovered by the limitations period. 2415(f) is an\nexception for counterclaims and offsets by the Government\nwhere a private party brings an action against the\nGovernment. But counterclaims and offsets typically\naren't brought by complaint; they're brought in the\nanswer, they're submitted in the answer. Therefore,\nwhether it's denominated an \"order,\" an \"answer,\" or\nsomething else, doesn't control whether or not 2415\napplies. 2415 applies to any action for money damages\nfounded on a contract, however you might denominate the\ninitial filing which commences the proceedings. In --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Lamken, the point has\nbeen made that there are many indications that what\nCongress had in mind was ordinary civil action in a court.\nIn addition to finding this provision solely in title 28,\nthe judiciary code, and not in title 5, there's also, if\nyou read the following provision, 2416, time for\ncommencing actions brought by the United States. And then\nit tells us the tolling periods. And, in doing that, it\nrefers twice to the \"defendant,\" which is a term that's\nused in civil proceedings, not administrative proceedings.\nMR. LAMKEN: Well, starting at 28 U.S.C., why\nit's there, it, in fact, applies both to administrative\nagency actions and actions in courts. And sometimes in 28\nU.S.C. there are provisions that apply to both. The\nFederal Tort Claims Act, for example, is in 28 U.S.C., and\nit has a provision for administrative adjustment of claims.\nPeople must file their claims before an agency first, and\nthen the agency can do administrative adjustment. That's\nentirely separate from the attorney general's ability to\ncompromise the claim once it's filed in court.\nSection -- title 5 also contains things that\napply to courts and agencies -- the right to judicial\nreview of agency actions, the waiver of immunity that's\nnecessary for those -- in addition to standards that\ngovern judicial review of agency actions. Those were all\nin title 5, but they actually apply to courts. These --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, 2415(a), (i), we -- you,\nyou cannot possibly say that that only applies to judicial\nactions, can you?\nMR. LAMKEN: Oh, no. That's --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes.\nMR. LAMKEN: -- actually completely --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And that's in --\nMR. LAMKEN: -- superfluous.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- and that's in title 28.\nMR. LAMKEN: And that's in -- yes, that's in\ntitle 28, as well.\nAnd with respect to the term \"defendants,\"\nJustice Ginsburg, Congress has often used the term\n\"defendants\" even in the context of administrative\nactions. The Stockyard and Packers Act of 1921 -- it's in\n7 U.S.C. 210 -- actually talks about a complaint against a\ndefendant for damages, all adjudicated before the\nSecretary of Agriculture, and that was 85 years ago. It\nseems a little late in the day now to debate whether one\ncan be a defendant, the person who defends before an\nagency, as well as the defendant --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: It's not the typical term\nused in agency proceedings to designate the responding\nparty.\nMR. LAMKEN: Well, you can talk about the\n\"responding party,\" or the \"defendant,\" but the term\n\"defendant\" is sufficiently broad to include one who\ndefends or denies, and that would be a term -- and it's\nbeen used in the past, as long as 85 years ago -- to\ndiscuss the person who might be liable for damages in --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And the content --\nMR. LAMKEN: -- an adversary --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- the content of the tolling\nprovision, as well, seems geared -- seems geared to a\ncivil lawsuit. It talks about a person being outside the\nUnited States; therefore, they wouldn't be amenable to\nservice of process.\nMR. LAMKEN: That's certainly right. These are\nall things that would apply, we would expect, both to\na civil action in court and an administrative-agency\naction, as well. They may work better for one or\nthe other in different particular circumstances, but they\nare all sufficiently broad that they can be used in both\ncircumstances. And the one the Government, in the\nadministrative context, would be most interested in would\nbe subsection C. When the Government just doesn't know\nthe facts, or the Government reasonably couldn't know the\nfacts, it gets an exception, just tolling, until it\nreasonably could have known of the fact. And that's just\nas applicable in an action before an agency as it would be\nin an action before a court.\nIn addition, the Government's contrary\nconstruction renders an entire provision superfluous. And\nthat is the one that Justice Scalia mentioned, Section\n2415(i), which is an exception for administrative offsets.\nThat exception for administrative offsets would do no work\nat all if --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: That wasn't part of the\noriginal statute, was it?\nMR. LAMKEN: No, that was added about 16 years\nlater, Your Honor. And it was added, but it clarifies the\nscope of the statute. And, as this Court admitted in --\npointed out in cases like Fausto and LaFranca, the later\namendment to a statute can clarify its meaning; and,\nindeed, statutes are ordinarily read, once amended, as if\nthey existed in their amended form from the offset.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought that (i) was added\nbecause it's -- for a very specific reason, that there was\na debate between the Department of Justice and -- I forgot\nthe other agency --\nMR. LAMKEN: The Comptroller, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- yes -- about whether an\noffset would be subject to the time limit.\nMR. LAMKEN: That's exactly right. And Congress\nresolved that debate by providing an exception for\nadministrative offsets, and no other exception for any --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What --\nMR. LAMKEN: -- sort of administrative\nproceeding. And that raises the strong inference that, in\nfact, this applies to administrative proceedings, and it\nsimply doesn't apply to administrative offsets, because\nthey're an exception.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: They could have said -- if the\nother interpretation of 2415(a), as not applying to\nadministrative proceedings, were correct, they could have\nsaid the provisions of this section do not apply to\nadministrative proceedings --\nMR. LAMKEN: That's --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- which would have -- which\nwould have handled the offset --\nMR. LAMKEN: Yes. It would have --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- but would have been well\nbeyond the offset. And the fact --\nMR. LAMKEN: That's exactly right.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- that they only focus on the\noffset certainly suggests that when you're not talking\nabout offset, it does apply to administrative proceedings.\nMR. LAMKEN: I could not have said it better,\nand I will not attempt to. In fact, in addition, it\nraises another anomaly in the statute, the Government's\ncontrary construction. And that is, it creates sort of an\nirrationality in the hierarchy of claims for the\nGovernment. Offensive judicial actions to extract money\nfrom private individuals must be brought within 6 years.\nAdministrative offsets for the Government to try and avoid\npaying money, those must be brought within 10 years, under\nthe administrative offset provision that was enacted\ntogether with the exception in (i). However, offensive\nadministrative actions to extract money may be brought in\nperpetuity, forever. It simply strains credulity to\nbelieve that Congress, at the same time it was saying the\nGovernment has only 10 years to assert administrative\noffsets to avoid paying money, instead intended\nadministrative agencies to be able to extract money on\nthat very same claim --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I can believe that they do --\nMR. LAMKEN: -- in perpetuity.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- I can -- I can believe that\nthey do that.\n[Laughter.]\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But --\nMR. LAMKEN: Well, Justice --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: By mistake. But I would not\nassume a mistake unless it's very clear.\nMR. LAMKEN: I think that's exactly right,\nJustice Scalia. And that's, again, going back to Fausto,\nwhere there is a sensible hierarchy of claims, or a\nsensible hierarchy of preferences. The Court doesn't\nordinarily presume that Congress put in a structure that\ndoesn't respect that ordinary hierarchy. And the\nGovernment's construction here is inconsistent with the\nordinary hierarchy which allows the Government to avoid\nmaking payment on more favorable terms; then the\nGovernment gets to go in and forcibly extract money from\nprivate individuals.\nFinally, the Government's construction also\nundermines the intended effect of the statute. The effect\nof statute -- the purpose of statutes of limitations --\nand this one, in particular -- is to provide repose -- to\nallow the individual to know that he will no longer\nconfront Government claims, to dispose of his documents,\nand also to encourage the Government to be diligent in\npursuing its claims. None of those purposes are achieved,\nall of those purposes are defeated, if -- once the statute\nof limitations period expires --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Mr. Lamken --\nMR. LAMKEN: Yes.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- could we go back to Section\n(i) for a second more? Is it also possible to say that\nthere was this disagreement between the Department of\nJustice and the Comptroller General, and Congress decided\nthat the Comptroller General was right? And, if that's\ntrue, should we not accept the Comptroller General's\nreading of the entire statute?\nMR. LAMKEN: Well, if Congress had decided the\nComptroller General is right, and had done that in\nsubsection (i), it would have written subsection (i) the\nway Justice Scalia proposed, which is to say this doesn't\napply to administrative claims at all. What it did is, it\nsaid, \"Ooh, this appears to apply to administrative claims\nand the Comptroller thinks these administrative offsets are\nimportant, so we will give a special statute of\nlimitations period in 31 U.S.C. for those, and exempt them\nfrom the more general statute of limitations period in\nsection 28 U.S.C. 2415.\" So, I don't believe that it\nshould be read that way. Is it frivolous to suggest that\nthat's the reading? No, the Government --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Does the --\nMR. LAMKEN: -- got it's --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- legislative history tell us\nhow detailed the congressional examination of the\nparticular issue was?\nMR. LAMKEN: Well, indeed, the legislative\nhistory mentions -- and there is a battle of letters\nbetween --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: That's about all --\nMR. LAMKEN: -- the Office of Legal Counsel and\nthe Comptroller on this issue. And Congress actually\nstepped into the fray and created an exception. But it\ncreated a limited exception --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Okay.\nMR. LAMKEN: -- an exception that applies only\nto one context, and that's administrative offsets. And\nthat certainly raises a very strong inference that, where\nthere isn't such an exception, the statute applies to\nadministrative proceedings, more generally.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Isn't the most likely answer\nthat they just -- they saw a small problem, and they\nrendered a decision on the small problem, and they didn't\nthink about it any further than that?\nMR. LAMKEN: Well, I have a hard time\npsychoanalyzing Congress, because it's sort of a corporate\nbody, and I can't tell what Member of Member of Congress\nis saying what. But when the Court of these statutes, it\ngenerally reads them -- and it, in fact, avoids, whenever\npossible, superfluity. And if this provision applies to\nadministrative proceedings from the outset, subsection (i)\nis superfluous, it's -- does no work whatsoever. And so,\nthe -- when Congress amended this statute, it certainly\nclarified that, where there is no exception, this statute\napplies to actions filed in administrative proceedings.\nIf there are no further questions, I'll reserve\nthe remainder of my time for rebuttal.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you.\nMr. Joseffer.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF DARYL JOSEFFER\nON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT\nMR. JOSEFFER: Justice Stevens, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe presumption is that the Government is not\nbound by a statute of limitations. And, when read as a\nwhole, Section 2415(a) does not overcome that presumption,\nbut instead makes clear that it applies only to suits in\ncourt. There are several reasons for that. First, the\nordinary meanings of all of the key statutory terms refer\nto suits in court. Second, the statute expressly\ndistinguishes between administrative proceedings and\nactions. Third the statute's located in the judicial\ncode. Fourth, the committee reports, for those who are\ninclined to consider them, strongly support the statute's\nordinary meaning. And, fifth, even if some administrative\nproceedings were governed by Section 2415(a), these would\nnot, because they do not involve a complaint.\nNow, on the first of those points, the term\n\"action\" ordinarily refers to the pursuit of a right in\ncourt, which just is why, just 7 years ago, in West v.\nGibson, every member of this Court agreed that the term\n\"action\" often refers only to suits in court, and not to\nadministrative proceedings.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It often does. It often does.\nBut it does not, universally. And there are a number of\ninstances cited by the Petitioner that -- where this Court\nand -- and statutes use the term in context where it\nclearly applies to administrative proceedings.\nMR. JOSEFFER: Well --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So, the question is, How -- you\nknow, how absurd is it not to read it to apply to\nadministrative proceedings in this case? And I find it\npretty absurd, because you assume, if you read that it\nway, that there is effectively no statute of limitations\nwhatever for the Government in these cases.\nMR. JOSEFFER: Well, the structure of the law\nhere is that in those instances where Congress does\nauthorize administrative recovery, it ordinarily provides\na context-specific administrative limitations period, such\nas in the Contract Disputes Act, which governs almost all\nof the contract claims the Government can pursue\nadministratively. Congress specifically enacted a 6-year\nlimitations period for the submission of a claim to a\ncontracting officer.\nIn this unique context, however, Congress had\nvery good reasons for not applying a limitations period\nuntil it prospectively enacted a partial one in 1996. The\nreason is that what Congress found here, in context of\nmineral leasing, based on the findings of an independent\ncommission, was that the companies were historically on an\nhonors system and had abused that by underpaying royalties\nof up to half a billion dollars annually. So, what\nCongress directed the agency to do is to audit all current\nand past lease accounts. One of the committee reports\nsaid to focus on old accounts, because this was a Congress\nthat was not concerned with repose, but with getting some\nof those vast underpayments back from the companies.\nNow, when we fast-forward to 1996 --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Wait.\nMR. JOSEFFER: -- at that point --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. And this was the\nCongress that enacted what?\nMR. JOSEFFER: No, I -- agreed. What I'm\nreferring to now is the Congress that enacted the mineral\nleasing provisions.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Oh.\nMR. JOSEFFER: -- which is not a good --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Which is not what we're talking\nabout here.\nMR. JOSEFFER: No, but -- well, we are, because\nthe structure of the law here is that Section 2415(a), as\nwe see it, governs court suits. And that works, because,\nwhen Congress authorizes administrative recovery, it\nalmost always provides a specific -- context-specific\nadministrative limitations period.\nAlso, when Congress was telling the agency to\nfocus on old accounts, it certainly wasn't thinking that a\nstatute of limitations applied to that, and the agency, in\nthat contemporary context, did not understand that there\nwas a limitations period, either, because the orders that\nissued in the aftermath of the 1982 Act went back 7, 8, 9,\nsometimes more, years than that.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: As late as 1978, the Justice\nDepartment didn't think that way, did it?\nMR. JOSEFFER: No, the Justice Department--\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The opinion of the Office of\nLegal Counsel, in '78, was exactly what the Petitioner\nhere would urge.\nMR. JOSEFFER: No, the OLC opinion was limited,\nby both its terms and its reasoning, to administrative\noffsets, not to administrative adjudications. And if I\ncould explain that, an administrative offset occurs in the\nsituation -- this is what OLC was looking at -- where the\nGovernment, by statute, owed retirement benefits to a\nperson, and, because it thought that person owed it money,\nwhat the Government did was to unilaterally reduce the\nretirement benefits. What OLC opined is that that is a --\nnothing more than a prejudgment attachment. And OLC\nthought that if the Government is time-barred from\nobtaining a judgment, it should be time-barred from\nobtaining a prejudgment attachment.\nAn administrative adjudication is significantly\ndifferent, because it does provide an actual judgment.\nSo, there are a couple of important points from that.\nFirst is that the dispute between OLC and the\nComptroller General was limited by its terms to\nadministrative offsets, although, Justice Stevens, the\nComptroller General did opine beyond that, that the\nstatute specifically applies only to suits in court. But\nthe actual dispute was as to administrative offsets. So,\nwhen Congress addressed that specific dispute, as Justice\nAlito pointed out, it resolved only that specific dispute.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But -- excuse me -- how could\nOLC possibly think that it applied to administrative\noffsets if it didn't apply to administrative proceedings?\nI mean, it was a contradiction of the proposition, which\nyou're urging here, which is that this statute applies\nonly to judicial proceedings. I mean, that's the point.\nWhether they spoke just to offsets or not, the position\ntaken by the Justice Department was that this statute\nrelates to administrative proceedings.\nMR. JOSEFFER: No, the position of OLC was\nlimited to administrative offsets, and it did not -- the\nimportant thing is, OLC opinion did not interpret the\nstatutory term \"action,\" or, frankly, any other statutory\nterm. Instead, it had a theory, which was probably wrong,\nthat administrative offsets are unique because they are\nprejudgment attachment devices. That's the dispute that\nwent to Congress, and that's the dispute that Congress\nactually resolved.\nAnd, in any event, going forward --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, on that theory, then,\nthere was -- there was no time issue with respect to the\nright to offset, then, in the OLC's position.\nMR. JOSEFFER: No, the OLC's view is that if the\nGovernment was time-barred from obtaining a judgment under\nSection 2415(a), then it would be time-barred from\nobtaining a prejudgment attachment.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, but I thought your -- in\nanswer to Justice Scalia, you said what was essential to\nthe -- to OLC's position was that the offset is like a\nprejudgment attachment, and, in effect, it's an attachment\nwithout process. If that's the case, then timing should\nhave nothing to do with it. Conversely, as Justice Scalia\nsaid, if timing does have something to do with it, timing\npresumably derives from this provision; this provision,\ntherefore, must have been assumed to apply to\nadministrative proceedings.\nSo, either there's no time question with respect\nto the offsets, or, if there is a time question with\nrespect to the offsets, it implies an OLC position that\nthis provision applies to administrative proceedings.\nMR. JOSEFFER: Well --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: What's wrong with that logic?\nMR. JOSEFFER: I think what's wrong with the\nlogic is what was wrong with the logic of the OLC opinion.\nWe don't mean to defend the --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: You put me --\nMR. JOSEFFER: -- reasoning of the OLC opinion --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- in good company, but --\nMR. JOSEFFER: -- but what OLC really did say --\nand Comptroller General and Congress promptly disagreed --\nwas that -- it didn't see a problem -- OLC didn't see a\nproblem with procedurally imposing an administrative\noffset. What it saw a problem with was, it thought if an\n-- a judgment would be time-barred, then a prejudgment\nattachment should be time-barred, as well. I mean, that\nwas the reasoning of the --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, but if it was --\nMR. JOSEFFER: -- OLC opinion, which --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- a prejudgment --\nMR. JOSEFFER: -- I agree was --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: It was a prejudgment attachment\nin aid of what could be accomplished administratively by,\nultimately, an administrative judgment.\nMR. JOSEFFER: No, the -- I guess it was another\npoint. The OLC opinion was -- arose in the context where\na judgment could be obtained at all only in court.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Do we have --\nMR. JOSEFFER: In the context of --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- that opinion, by the way?\nBoth sides cited it. The -- is it -- it was unpublished.\nMR JOSEFFER: It was unpublished, and --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Does anybody give it to us?\nMR. JOSEFFER: Petitioners offered to lodge it\nwith the Court--\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, I know they did offer, but\nnobody did it.\nMR. JOSEFFER: I'll -- we'll do it this\nafternoon.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Good. I would like that.\nMR. JOSEFFER: The point's just -- the OLC\nreasoning was admittedly somewhat odd, but that was the\ncontext in which Congress was responding to. And, going\nforward, it is not surplusage, because the issue still\narises. If the Government could pursue its suit only in\ncourt, it would be time-barred from pursuing a suit in\ncourt. The question would then still arise, under the OLC\nopinion, unless it had been overruled, whether the\nGovernment could, nonetheless, obtain a prejudgment\nattachment, even though it cannot obtain judgment. That's\nall that Congress was looking at there. And, as this\nCourt's recognized in cases like O'Gilvie and Vonn, when\nCongress amends a statue to resolve a specific dispute,\noftentimes its amendments should be read as doing no more\nthan that.\nWe -- I agree, though, that terms -- to get back\nto the beginning of this discussion -- terms do not always\nhave their ordinary meanings, but they presumptively do,\nespecially when a statute must be strictly construed. And\nhere, the context confirms that \"action\" does have its\nordinary meaning, for several reasons.\nFirst, the ordinary meanings of the other key\nstatutory terms, such as \"right of action,\" \"complaint,\"\nand \"defendant,\" as Justice Ginsberg pointed out, all\nordinarily refer to aspects of suits in court. A \"right\nof action\" is the right to bring a suit in court; a\n\"defendant\" is the person defending in court ordinarily;\nand a \"complaint\" is the document that initiates\nproceedings by stating a claim that's seeking relief in a\ncivil action, which is a suit in court. Especially when\nthose terms are used together, this Court recognized, in\nUnexcelled Chemical, that a reference to commencing a\naction by filing a complaint ordinarily refers to filing a\nsuit in court, not a pleading before an administrative\nagency. The statute then goes on to expressly juxtapose\nan action against an administrative proceeding by saying\nthat the time to file an action does not run until after\nthe administrative proceedings have concluded, which\ncertainly gives weight to the point that the action is --\nan administrative proceeding is not an action.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Would the -- at the time that\n4515 -- is that the --\nMR. JOSEFFER: It's 2415.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: 20- -- I'm sorry. At the time\nthat was enacted, were there any limitations in other\nstatutes on the commencement of administrative\nproceedings?\nMR. JOSEFFER: The ones that we have found were\n-- I'm not 100-percent sure, but the ones that we -- that\nwe have found and cited in our brief do appear to be\nenacted after that time. I think the reason is that -- I\nmean, historically, administrative -- obviously, court\nsuits have been around a lot longer than administrative\nadjudications. And, as Congress has authorized\nadministrative adjudications, it's dealt with them on a\ncase-by-case basis. And every time that it enacted a\ncontext-specific administrative adjudications period since\n1966 -- in theory, it could have just done an\nacross-the-board one for all agency adjudications, but,\ninstead, it's chosen to deal with the context-specific; in\npart, because of the great variety of administrative\nprocedure.\nI mean, as this case illustrates, a statute of\nlimitations that governs a complaint in an action is just\nnot going to work in a lot of administrative contexts.\nHere, there's no complaint. An \"order\" is a legally\nbinding order. It doesn't seek relief, it imposes it.\nAnd unless it is both appealed and stayed pending appeal\n--\nJUSTICE SCALIA: How about the initial letter\nthat, in the agency practice, precedes the order? I\ngather there's a letter to the --\nMR. JOSEFFER: Right. There's -- there are\nbasically three steps here. First, there's an audit.\nThen, if the audit reveals an apparent discrepancy, the\nagency or a State with delegate authority would send an\nissue letter requesting an explanation.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: An issue letter.\nMR. JOSEFFER: Yes. It's called an \"issue\nletter.\" And then would basically request an explanation\nof the apparent discrepancy. And then, if the agency then\ndecides, after consideration of the audit and the issue\nletter, that it's appropriate to issue an order to pay it,\nwill do so. It --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Sounds to me like a complaint,\na response --\nMR. JOSEFFER: An issue letter?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- and an adjudication. I\nmean, you know --\nMR. JOSEFFER: I don't know whether you mean the\naudit --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- \"We think you owe this.\"\nMR. JOSEFFER: -- or the issue letter, but\neither way --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The response comes back, \"I\ndon't think we owe it, and here's why.\" And then there's\na ruling, \"You do owe it.\" And that's the order. And\nthen you can appeal it. And the CFR refers to it as an\nappeal.\nMR. JOSEFFER: Yes. Well, there are a few\nthings. First, on the -- with respect to the issue letter\n-- I mean, a complaint, functionally, is a document that\ninitiates proceedings, stating it -- by stating the claim\nfor relief, is seeking relief in a civil action. With\nrespect to the second of those, an issue letter does not\n-- is not an allegation of wrongdoing, and it does not\nseek relief; it seeks information so that the agency can\ndetermine whether or not an apparent discrepancy raised by\nan audit is, in fact, a discrepancy. But there's --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It does not --\nMR. JOSEFFER: -- no claim.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- assert that there's a\ndiscrepancy?\nMR. JOSEFFER: Well, what it -- what it asserts\nis that, \"We've done an audit, and the audit has raised\nthe following issues\" -- that's why it's called an \"issue\nletter\" -- \"Please provide an explanation.\" And it -- so,\nat that point, the agency has not decided yet whether it\nis, in fact, asserting a claim. It's not -- and it's not\nrequesting relief, which a complaint definitely does. All\nit's requesting is information to help the agency assess\nthe issue.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Do we have an example of issue\nletters anywhere? That's not in the materials either, is\nit? In the --\nMR. JOSEFFER: No, in fact, it's not even -- in\nfact, it's not even in the administrative record --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Right.\nMR. JOSEFFER: -- which is one of the reasons\nit's not in the issue --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Do we know --\nMR. JOSEFFER: -- record of the case --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- what time lapse --\nMR. JOSEFFER: -- which also reflects that it's\nnot a formal complaint, or it would be in the record.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Do we know, in this case, what\ntime lapse there was between the issue letter and the\norder?\nMR. JOSEFFER: I don't think it was more than a\nyear or two.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But --\nMR. JOSEFFER: And there was --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- would that -- if you took\nthe issue letter as the day, wouldn't all of the -- all of\nthe Government's claims be timely? Because we're only\ntalking about part of the claim, anyway, as I understand\nit. Is that correct?\nMR. JOSEFFER: Here, I think if you ran --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't think so. I tried to\nfigure that out. I think --\nMR. JOSEFFER: Yes, if it ran from the --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I think --\nMR. JOSEFFER: -- if it ran from the issue\nletter --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Okay.\nMR. JOSEFFER: -- I think there would still be\nabout a year in dispute here.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: There would be some in dispute.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Going forward, if we --\nMR. JOSEFFER: But --\nJUSTICE ALITO: -- if we agree with your\nposition, the result will be that there will be a 7-year\nlimitations period for oil and gas leases, but, for Indian\nclaims and for minerals, there'll be no statute of\nlimitations?\nMR. JOSEFFER: Yes, and the reason is that\nthat's what Congress chose to do. I mean, in the\nprospective 1996 Act, it --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Did they --\nMR. JOSEFFER: -- enacted the limitations --\nJUSTICE ALITO: When they enacted the 7-year\nlimitation period, did they explain why they would treat\nthose two situations so differently?\nMR. JOSEFFER: No, there's no explanation. As a\npractical matter, though, the prospective 1996 legislation\ngoverns a wide variety of aspects of the -- of the\nrelationship between the Federal Government and the\nlessees. And, on balance, that package was pretty\nfavorable to the oil companies, and I think Congress\nprobably just decided not to -- to apply that to itself,\nbut not to the Indians.\nGetting back to the order, though, it's not only\nthat --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: How do you defend against a\nclaim for, you know, stuff that went on a hundred years\nago?\nMR. JOSEFFER: Well, as a --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I -- I'm really very reluctant\nto -- unless there is no possible other reading of the\nstatute, to think that that's -- that that's what the law\nprovides, that the Government can show up a hundred years\nlater, and say, \"Oh, by the way, you owe all this money.\"\nMR. JOSEFFER: Well, first off, until --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The company says \"Gee, I -- you\nknow, I don't have records from a hundred years ago.\"\nMR. JOSEFFER: Right. Well, there are a few\npoints, both legal and practical. On the legal, until\n1966 that absolutely was the law, because historically no\nlimitations period ever applies against the Government.\nAnd that's the reason for the strict construction canon,\nthat the statute applies here only if it clearly applies,\nand thereby bars the Government from forcing the law in\nthe public interest.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Say that again. Until 1966,\nthere were no statute of limitations against any\nGovernment suits?\nMR. JOSEFFER: Not contract. I mean, the\nhistoric rule is that the Government is not bound by\nstatutes of limitations, because what it's doing is\nenforcing the law in the public interest. Now, in 1966,\nCongress enacted Section 2415(a) so that there would\nprospectively be a contract limitations period. But it's\nstrictly construed, because of the historical backdrop and\nthe importance of enforcing the law in the public\ninterest. So that's why we do have a strict construction\ncanon here. As a --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: He didn't apply against the\nGovernment either.\nMR. JOSEFFER: For the same reason laches is\nnever applied against the Government.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So, there's no limit at all,\nand you concede that that's the case. So, the Government\ncould go back on these royalties as long as it likes.\nMR. JOSEFFER: Well, as an abstract theoretical\nmatter, the Government could reach back many, many\ndecades. As a practical matter, though, that's never\nhappened that we've gone back, say, 50 or 100 years\nand there are practical reasons for that. First is that\nthe agency does not have enough resources to audit --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, there's a case involving\nthe Oneida Indians, that went back quite a ways --\nMR. JOSEFFER: That's true. It's -- I meant in\nthe --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- 200 years --\nMR. JOSEFFER: -- leasing context here.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes.\nMR. JOSEFFER: I didn't mean in the leasing\ncontext here. But in the leasing context, one -- there\nare a couple of important points. One is that the\nGovernment does not have enough resources to audit all of\nthe current accounts in all of the years, which is one of\nthe reasons that we need to be able to go back farther\nwhen we catch the violation. As a -- but as\na result, the notion that we're going to pull auditing\nresources off of today to do a frolicking detour into 50\nyears ago, there's a reason that's never happened.\nIn addition, the farther we try to go back, the\ngreater the proof problems, because oftentimes only the\ncompanies have the information that shows what royalties\nthey would owe, and if they lawfully destroy those records\nafter 6 years, it makes it even harder for us to try to go\nback, because of proof problems.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's another indication. Why\nwould you allow them to destroy those records after 6\nyears if you -- if you thought -- if you thought that\nthere was no statute of limitations to claims for these\nthings? I mean, that's just another inconsistency that --\nin the statutory scheme that's created.\nMR. JOSEFFER: Well, no, the --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You say, \"You can destroy your\nrecords after 6 years.\" Well, why? It doesn't make any\nsense.\nMR. JOSEFFER: Well, first, it's optional, not\nmandatory. If they want to keep them, they --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes.\nMR. JOSEFFER: -- certainly can. But there's no\n-- and, as a practical matter -- I mean, because the\nGovernment bears the initial burden of going forward, if\nthe company destroys the sources of proof, that's, on\nbalance, going to be in its favor. But, in addition,\nthere's not a strict congruence between the 6-year\nperiods, because, first, the companies only have to keep\nrecords for 6 years, but, in some circumstances, the\nSecretary can require they be kept for longer. In\naddition, sometimes the statute of limitations, because of\ntolling, is much longer than 6 years; and so, the lawful\ndestruction of records would still leave absence-of-proof\nissues in situations where the statute might, because of\ntolling, be much longer. So, there's not a strict\ncongruence.\nThere is also no indication that Congress\nenacted the 6-year records-retention policy because it was\nthinking about a 6-year limitations period. There's never\nbeen any linkage between the two.\nIf I could briefly cover, then, also -- I mean,\nin addition to all the textual points, this is also\nlocated in the judicial code. And, although it's true\nthat a couple stray provisions in the judicial code apply\nto administrative proceedings, they say that expressly.\nEvery time the word \"action\" is used in the judicial code\n-- and Petitioners identified no examples -- every time\nthe word \"action\" is used in the judicial code, it refers\nto a suit in court, and only a suit in court.\nWhen a provision of the judicial code applies to\nsomething else, it will say so. For example, 28 U.S. Code\n2462, which is a statute of limitations for penalty\nproceedings, refers to an \"action, suit, or proceeding.\"\nThe Federal Tort Claims Act is very clear that what\nit's talking about is submitting something to an agency.\nSo, if Congress was going to legislate against\nthe backdrop of a strict construction canon with terms\nthat ordinarily refer to suits in court, and put the\nprovision in the judicial code, I mean, that just is a\ntotally irrational way of expressing intent, especially\nclear -- especially a clear intent, when it's trying to\ngovern administrative proceedings.\nThe committee reports also strongly confirm\nthat, because they not only say that the statute defines\nthe time limitation for bringing an action in the U.S.\ncourts, and not only use court terminology from front to\nback, they also say, like the statute, that they're aware\nof the administrative proceedings, but what they're saying\nis that the time to bring an action in the courts does not\nexpire until after the conclusion of those proceedings.\nThe committee has explained that the reason for\nthat provision was the great number and variety of\nadministrative proceedings. So, in other words, Congress\nwas saying, \"There's a great variety of administrative\nprocedure. We're just not going to deal with that here.\nWe're taking it off the table by saying this limitations\nperiod does not expire until a year after those\nadministrative proceedings, whatever they might be, have\nexpired.\"\nThere's also some relevance in the fact that\nthis legislation was proposed by the Justice Department as\npart of an overall package of reforms that would govern\nthe civil litigation that the Department was handling in\nthe courts. It was then referred to the Judiciary\nCommittees, not to the House Government Reform Committees\nthat might consider administrative procedure matters, and,\nas I mentioned before, was enacted as part of the judicial\ncode.\nFrom start to finish, this legislation has never\nhad anything to do with anything other than court suits,\nwhich is why Congress has expressly provided for\ncontext-specific administrative systems -- limitations\nperiods -- which make sense in the context of the relevant\nadministrative procedures.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, except when you -- when\nyou say \"this legislation,\" you limit it to the body of\n2415(a) and you leave out (i), which -- -- or I guess it's\n\"one.\" Is it? Little -- or --\nMR. JOSEFFER: It's (i). It is (i).\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's (i). I mean, that clearly\ndoes apply to administrative proceedings. And I could\nunderstand the argument that Congress was just making\nthings doubly clear -- okay? -- that (a) does not apply to\nadministrative proceedings. I could understand that\nargument if the way (i) was written is, \"The provisions of\nthis section shall not apply to administrative\nproceedings.\" And then I would say, \"You know, oh, well,\nthat was always the case, and this is just making it\nclear.\"\nIt doesn't say that. It says that -- the only\nadministrative proceeding that they cut out of it is these\noffsets.\nMR. JOSEFFER: I think the reason is that --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And, you know, the normal rule\nis inclusio unius, exclusio alterius. I would -- it\nmeans, to me, when I read the statute as a whole -- and\nthat's the way I read statutes, I don't ask whether this\nsection was adopted this year, and the other section was\nadopted next year -- I don't do it bite by bite; you look\nat the whole text -- and, when you read all this stuff\ntogether, it seems to me that the import of (i) is that\nadministrative proceedings, despite the fact that \"action\"\nis not a very common word to use for them, are covered.\nMR. JOSEFFER: I mean, it's -- there's no doubt\nthe statute should be read as a whole. But, as this Court\nhas explained in cases like the O'Gilvie and Vonn cases\ncited in our brief, when a court's trying to make sense of\na statute read as a whole, oftentimes it will find that\nwhen Congress faces a specific dispute and amends a\nstatute to resolve that specific dispute, that's all it\nresolves, and there's no reason to draw further negative\ninference, especially here, as the Court of Appeals\npointed out, where a strict construction canon applies.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's the best thing you have\ngoing for you, really, the strict construction canon.\nMR. JOSEFFER: Well, because -- I mean, and it\nis an important point, that the statute applies only if it\nclearly applies by its terms. And it seems to me, the\nbest that Petitioners can do is to say that some of the\nstatutory terms, in isolation, are ambiguous. But that --\nall that means, as I said, is that, under the strict\nconstruction canon, we would prevail. And even if the\nstatute governs some administrative proceedings, but not\nothers, it would not govern these, for the reason I gave\nearlier, which is that there's no complaint here. We\ntalked, before, about the ways in which an order is not a\ncomplaint. It's another important point, though, that in\norder not only -- it is -- not only does it not begin the\nproceedings, it normally ends them, because appeals are\nonly taken about a quarter of the time. And in some\nlimited circumstances there's not even a right of appeal,\nif the Assistant Secretary issued the order. So --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What if I didn't think the\norder was a complaint, but I thought the initial letter\nwas a complaint? Would the Petitioner lose? Because they\nnever made that argument.\nMR. JOSEFFER: Correct. It's -- the only\nargument they've ever made --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes.\nMR. JOSEFFER: -- is that an \"order\" is a\ncomplaint. So, they haven't preserved the point.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Because you're --\nMR. JOSEFFER: But --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- you made the point that\nthe issue letter is just raising the issues, and it's not\ncharging, as a complaint would allege, \"You owe us,\" but\nthis is, \"Maybe you owe us.\"\nMR. JOSEFFER: Correct. There's no -- in an\nissue letter, there's no claim for relief, just a claim\nfor the request for information, and there's no allegation\nof wrongdoing. So, it's just not a complaint in those\nways. Also, it doesn't -- it's not really fair to say\nthat it begins proceedings, because it comes between an\naudit and an order to pay. So it doesn't -- and plus,\nit's, of course, not filed in a civil action. And, in\nthat respect, it doesn't satisfy any of the -- any of the\nelements of the -- of the ordinary definition of\n\"complaints.\"\nJUSTICE ALITO: Are you saying that this doesn't\napply to any administrative proceeding, or just those that\nare structured like this one, where you don't have\nanything that's labeled a \"complaint\"?\nMR. JOSEFFER: We -- well, our primary\nsubmission is that it does not apply to any administrative\nproceedings, for the reason -- reasons I've given, that\nthe ordinary meanings of all of the key statutory terms\nare for suits in court. A \"complaint\" itself is\nordinarily defined to be --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Even if you have an\nadministrative proceeding which is called a \"complaint\"?\nYou know, I mean -- and some are, I think.\nMR. JOSEFFER: There are -- there are some\ncontexts in administrative procedure in which the word\n\"complaint\" is used.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And that would not be covered\nby 2415(a).\nMR. JOSEFFER: Because it's not filed in an\n\"action,\" which refers to a suit in court, following\noccurral of a right of action, which refers to the right\nto bring suit in court, in a statute which then juxtaposes\nthe terms \"action\" against \"administrative proceedings\" --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And let's assume all those\nterms are used in the agency procedure. They're talking\nabout \"action,\" \"right of action.\" All those terms are\nused in the agency's procedural rules. Would they then\ncome under this thing?\nMR. JOSEFFER: No.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I think you have to say no --\nMR. JOSEFFER: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- because, otherwise, it would\nbe up to the agency, just by renaming their things, to\ncome in or out, right?\nMR. JOSEFFER: Well, and it's a much more --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes.\nMR. JOSEFFER: -- fundamental point than that,\ntoo, is that what Congress was doing here was, when using\nthese terms in their ordinary sense, to lay out an across-\nthe-board rule that applies to suits in court.\nAnd, finally, one thing I should also emphasize\nis that what we have in this context is a comprehensive\nadministrative scheme. Petitioners like to say that,\n\"Well, we could just as easily be in court.\" There's a\nreason that no administrative royalty proceeding has ever\nbeen brought by the Government in a court. And that's,\nfirst, that Congress directed the agency to establish a\ncomprehensive auditing and collection system, and then\ngave the agency administrative authority to enforce its\nadministrative orders. The only way the agency could\nadminister thousands of leases with something like $9\nbillion in royalties every year is to do this in an\nefficient administrative manner.\nCongress has not only authorized that, and\nratified it, it has strengthened that scheme and told the\nagency, as I said, in 1982, to go back and look at old\nleases, precisely because Congress knew that is a\nstandalone administrative scheme, and it's never provided\nthe administrative limitations period for the standalone\nadministrative scheme.\nIf there are no more questions --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you, Mr. Joseffer.\nMr. Lamken, as I understand it, you have about\n11 minutes left. You don't have to use them all.\n[Laughter.]\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY A. LAMKEN\nON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS\nMR. LAMKEN: I will endeavor not to. Thank you,\nJustice Stevens.\nI wanted to start with the ordinary meaning of\nthe term \"action.\" I was somewhat bemused by the\nGovernment's insistence that had -- the term \"action\" in\nWest versus Gibson was construed -- it must mean an action\nbefore a court, and has that as its ordinary meaning.\nThe Solicitor General's own position in West\nversus Gibson, on page 25 and -6 of its brief was,\n\"Section 1981(a) does not, however, define the term\n'action' as being limited to judicial proceedings. The\nstatutory language, read in context, suggests that no such\nlimitation was intended.\"\nPage 6 of the Government's reply, \"The term\n'action,' in Section 1981, can reasonably be construed as\nencompassing both administrative and judicial\nproceedings.\"\nThe term \"action\" is a term that's used for\nadversary adjudicative proceedings, whether those are in\ncourt or before an agency. It is not limited to\nadministrative agency proceedings, as the Government\nitself recognized in West versus Gibson.\nThere are more general terms here. There's also\n\"complaint,\" there's also \"defendant.\" There's a number\nof those. But those general terms are also the terms of\nadversary adjudication. And Congress uses them, as far\nback as 1921, for adversary adjudications before agencies.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Lamken, have you had any\nsecond thoughts about your position that it's the order,\nrather than the issue letter, that we should look at?\nMR. LAMKEN: Well, in fact -- no. But the --\nthe answer is that we didn't -- no issue was engaged as to\nwhat was the functional equivalent of the complaint below.\nThat raised -- was raised for the first time by the\nSolicitor General in its merits brief, saying, \"No, no,\nno, there's actually some stuff that comes before the\norder.\"\nBut if -- I would encourage the Court to look at\nthe definitions in FOGRSFA, 1724 and 1702(A), which tell\nyou what, under -- in Congress's view, commences the\nproceedings here. And, in Congress's view, what commences\nthe proceedings, what triggers the new statute of\nlimitations and stops it from running, is the order to\npay, which Congress defines as a \"demand.\"\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that's true. That's\ntrue. But the provision you're arguing that you come\nunder does talk about a complaint.\nMR. LAMKEN: That's --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And that's what -- you know,\nthat's what starts the 6 years running. And it's -- seems\nto me odd to call something a \"complaint\" which is, in\nfact, an order. They're not complaining about anything;\nthey're saying, \"Pay the money.\"\nMR. LAMKEN: Actually, Justice Scalia --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You know, usually a complaint,\nyou're -- you make your point, and say, \"What do you say?\nWhat's your answer?\"\nMR. LAMKEN: Well --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And this is an order. \"You're\n-- boom, \"Pay.\"\nMR. LAMKEN: It certainly has a hybrid quality,\nJustice Scalia. And it's not a hybrid quality that the\nindustry particularly likes. But it is the first time\nthat the Government asserts its state -- its claims as to\nwhat's wrong, in a binding legally operative document,\nwhere the failure to respond results in default. It has\nthat function as complaint. It is the first salvo in\nofficial, formal administrative proceedings.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that's only true if you\nconsider an appeal to be the response. And that's rather\nweird, that --\nMR. LAMKEN: It is --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- that the response to a\ncomplaint is an appeal.\nMR. LAMKEN: The language that has been used,\nand -- as a result of very odd historical anomalies and\nattempts to introduce a sense of due process to these\nproceedings over time -- is odd, and it is awkward. But\nit's clear that when Congress wrote the scope of this\nstatute, it said it applies to \"every action for money\ndamages by the Government which is founded in contract.\"\nIt doesn't say \"actions that are begun by complaint.\"\nNow, the complaint is what Congress assumes will\nstop the provision from running. And there is always, in\nan adversary adjudication, some document that functions\nlike a complaint, that provides the defendant the notice\nof what the claims are against it, and to which failure to\nrespond will result in default.\nWe believe that the most likely thing to be the\ncomplaint here is, the thing that provided us with notice,\nis that -- \"Boys, you've got to respond; otherwise, you're\nin trouble\" -- was the order to pay. And Congress came to\nthat same conclusion when it enacted -- when it enacted\nFOGRSFA and established a 7-year statute of limitations\nprovision. But if we lose 2 years of the claim, and only\nget 1 because it is the agency letter, in the Court's\nview, well, that's fine, but there's some document here\nthat started these agency proceedings, and it is that\ndocument which is a complaint.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Could you get us -- we're going\nto have supplemental material filed, the OLC opinion.\nCould you -- could you get us a -- you know, a sample of\nan agency letter? Or, if you can't, maybe the Government\ncan?\nMR. LAMKEN: Yes, I -- that's true. And in\nterms of the OLC letter, we offered to lodge it in our\nbrief. Unfortunately, by the Court's rules, we're not\nallowed to lodge it, unless the Court specifically\nrequests it. And so, that's why it's not there. But we\nwill get that to you, or the Government will get it to\nyou, as soon as possible.\nThe actual agency letter, in this case, isn't in\nthe administrative record. And it turns out that we\nhaven't been able to find it, and the Government hasn't\nbeen able to find it. And so, it's a letter. It's a\ndemand letter, but it is a letter, and that -- the order\nto pay is actually the opening salvo in these proceedings.\nAnd again, what opens the proceedings in -- the Justice\nDepartment regulations and other regulations --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I suggest --\nMR. LAMKEN: -- to try to define --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- this, Mr. Lamken, that when\nthe -- when the filing is made giving us the OLC opinion,\nyou include a -- an example of such a letter?\nMR. LAMKEN: Yes. Yes. Of course.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And so, we'll get a notion of\nwhat it looks like.\nMR. LAMKEN: Right. It may have to be from some\nother proceeding; it wouldn't necessarily be from this\ncase.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Your position is, this would\napply to the universe of administrative proceedings. Now,\nthis particular lease arrangement is taken care of by an\nexpress statute of limitations. So, what we're talking\nabout, for the future -- what would change under your\ninterpretation? Not gas leases, because -- there's a 7-\nyear limitation for both administrative orders to pay and\n--\nMR. LAMKEN: Right.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- court actions.\nMR. LAMKEN: Right. It would be all leases on\nIndian lands. It would be all leases which involve\nminerals other than oil and gas, whether it be coal, gold,\nsilver, anything like that. It would also be all claims\nbefore September -- all production before September of\n1996. That introduces something of an oddity, if one\naccepts the Government's position. It would be that, for\nall claims going forward from September of 1996, the\nGovernment has 7 years, but, for the prior 200 years,\nthose claims persist in perpetuity. When Section 2415(a)\nitself was enacted, Congress avoided precisely that result\nby deeming all prior claims to have accrued on the date\nthe statute of limitations was enacted. And the very fact\nthat Congress didn't do that here is evidence that\nCongress -- to the extent it has anything to do with it at\nall -- is evidence that Congress, in fact, understood that\nthere already was a statute of limitations applicable.\nAnd, in fact --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What --\nMR. LAMKEN: -- it also --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What other areas would we be\nmessing up by finding for you? I mean, here, you know, if\nwe don't find that this administrative action is covered\nby this statute of limitations, there's no statute of\nlimitations. But there may -- there are other -- may be\nother areas covered by this text -- namely, a suit by the\nUnited States -- founded upon any contract expressly or\nimplied in law or in fact, where there is some kind of a\nstatute of limitations.\nMR. LAMKEN: Right. There are -- there are some\ncontexts in which there already is a separate\nadministrative regime which would have its own statute of\nlimitations. The Contract Disputes Act, as the Government\npoints out, is one of those.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And that would prevail over\nthis --\nMR. LAMKEN: Yes, because the --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- because it's more --\nMR. LAMKEN: -- Contract Disputes --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- specific.\nMR. LAMKEN: -- Act has an exception at the\nfront and says \"notwithstanding 2415.\" It's its own\nanimal to itself. And there is a clause at the front of\n2415 that says \"except as otherwise provided by Congress.\"\nAnd so, Congress often takes exceptions. And when it\nmodified the Mineral Leasing Act of 1996, that was an\nexception to the 2415 regime. So, Congress knows how to\nconduct specialized situations and take things outside of\n2415 when it needs to. But it enacted Section 2415 as a\ncatchall for all of those situations where Congress hadn't\nmanaged to anticipate the circumstances. And the\nGovernment's premise of the whole provision is that\nCongress botched it. Congress provided a catchall that\ncatches judicial actions, but leaves the Government free,\nin perpetuity, to persist -- to proceed on precisely the\nsame claims for precisely the same relief, plus interest.\nAnd, because interest is calculated at a relatively high\nrate, that makes those old claims much, much more valuable\nthan the relatively more recent claims. And it seems\nimplausible to think that Congress enacted a catchall\nlimitations period with a loophole so large that it\ndeprives the statute of limitations period of effect\nalmost entirely.\nFinally, I'd like to say, one moment about the\nstatute -- the canon of strict construction. And that is\nthat it doesn't always require the court to narrow\notherwise broad statutory language, particularly where\ndoing so would have the effect of rendering another\nprovision -- here, subsection (i) is superfluous --\nintroducing anomalies into the statutory structure and\ndepriving the statute of its intended effect, as the\nBowers case we cite in our reply brief on page 16 makes\nclear. And Bowers case was virtually on point. It\nwas the case where the -- it was a statute of limitations\nthat could have applied to administrative agency actions,\nor it could not have. And the Court declined to accept a\nnarrowing construction proffered by the Government under\nstatute of strict construction because it would have\nrendered one of the provisions -- one for consent\nproceedings -- superfluous, because it would have resulted\nin anomaly, and because it would have undermined the\npremise of repose which undergirded the statute of\nlimitations in that case. Precisely the same things are\ntrue here. And, for those reasons, the Court should reach\nprecisely the same result.\nIf there are no further questions, thank you\nvery much.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you, Mr. Lamken.\nThe case is taken -- is
