BLATT\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMS. BLATT: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may\nit please the Court:\nCustoms officials have the responsibility to\nprotect the Nation's borders against the entry of dangerous\nor unwanted items. Consistent with that fundamental and\nsovereign necessity, customs officials have historically had\nthe power to open containers and conduct a thorough search\nof items without a warrant, probable cause, or any\nparticularized suspicion.\nQUESTION: Well, now in this case, I suppose the\nGovernment did have reasonable suspicion.\nMS. BLATT: That's correct, but we did not rely on\nit and the evidence was suppressed on -- based on the Ninth\nCircuit's rule that a gas tank cannot be removed and opened\nwithout reasonable suspicion.\nQUESTION: Can you make us, i.e., I'm not saying\nthis pejoratively, but can this Court be required to decide\nwhat might be a hypothetical question, it seems to me, the\ndog barked and therefore they had grounds for thinking their\nwere drugs in the gas tank, and he kicked the gas tank and\nit was hollow, and no one disputes those facts. But you\nwant to decide -- us to decide this case, as does the other\nside, as if those facts didn't exist. It sounds to me like\na hypothetical question, almost in the direction of an\nadvisory opinion. What would we have decided if those facts\ndidn't exist? But they do. So how does that work?\nMS. BLATT: Well, I don't think it's an advisory\nopinion in that the evidence has been suppressed. But,\nJustice Breyer, let me directly answer your question on why\nthe case is here. In 2002, the Ninth Circuit held that the\nConstitution is violated if customs officials remove and\nopen a gas tank without reasonable suspicion, and in that\ncase there was reasonable suspicion, making the case very\ndifficult to challenge.\nThe Government legitimately wanted to challenge\nthe case in a -- in a -- in a case where the officers\nactions could not be subject to a potential Bivens liability\nfor violating the clearly established law of the Ninth\nCircuit. At the same time, customs officials viewed the\nNinth Circuit's decision as posing an immediate and present\ndanger to their ability to protect the border, and they\nthought it imperative to try to challenge a -- bring up a\ncase that challenged that rule as soon as possible.\nSo two weeks after the Ninth Circuit's decision\nwas decided, respondent drove across -- drove across the\nborder with a gas tank full of 80 pounds of marijuana, and\nthe Government, we think legitimately, told the district\ncourt, and there was no secret at any time in this case,\nincluding at the petition stage, that we were not going to\nput on evidence that there was reasonable suspicion, even\nthough the dog alerting and the solid-sounding tap of the\ngas tank, we could have established or presumably could have\nestablished that that was reasonable suspicion.\nAnd both the district court and the Ninth Circuit\nsummarily affirmed the -- suppressed it and then affirmed\nthe suppression, because there was not reasonable suspicion,\nand that's why this case is here.\nthis case as a threat to their ability to deter and detect\nsmuggling at a container that is relatively large and that\nis commonly used -- in fact, it is the most common container\nused along the Mexican border -\nQUESTION: Can we go back to your -\nMS. BLATT: -- to conceal contraband.\nQUESTION: You gave a Bivens justification for what\nis extraordinary. I mean, it's not a violation of article 3\nfor us to decide it on your basis, but still, this Court\ndeals with concrete cases with actual facts and not with\nabstract questions. So is it -- is it your notion -- is it\ncorrect that what the Ninth Circuit says becomes clearly\nestablished law so that an officer would genuinely be -- be\nsubject to Bivens liability when this Court hasn't addressed\nthe question?\nMS. BLATT: No, but we didn't want to have to tell\nthe men and women who were in charge of enforcing the border\nthat they should be subject to a potential suit, at least\nbeing named in their personal capacity in a lawsuit. It\nseemed more appropriate from our perspective to try to bring\na case as soon as possible where we think we could have\nproven reasonable suspicion, but it squarely fit within the\nNinth Circuit's rule that reasonable suspicion was required.\nQUESTION: I suppose you could also say it's a\nquestion of resources.\nto put on witnesses, get officers up from the border, have\nthem sit in court, go through the motion to suppress, so\nthat you have a very real interest simply in expediting\ntrial procedures by taking the course you did. I don't know\nif that helps you on this article 3 problem or -\nMS. BLATT: It -- it helps to explain why we\nthought there was a paramount interest in getting the case\nas soon as possible. We didn't want to divert resources\naway from the border into having to prove our reasonable\nsuspicion. In fact, there's already been serious fallout in\nterms of trying to prove reasonable suspicion when we search\ngas tanks, because the Ninth Circuit has said that all of\nour discovery on how we train our dogs has to be produced,\nand this is extremely sensitive information.\nQUESTION: This is a -- I wasn't doubting the\nGovernment's motive here. I think you have excellent\nmotive, though maybe Bivens, maybe it was a little\noverconcerned about the Bivens, maybe it wasn't. But what\nI'm interested in is the law. That is, this isn't the first\ncase where this has happened, not necessarily involving the\nGovernment, and I'm not sure how the law's supposed to work.\nParties come in and they say, we would like you to\ndecide this issue. I'm sure they would. But in order to\nget to that issue, we have to assume out of the case certain\nfacts that everyone agrees are there.\nMS. BLATT: Well, that -\nQUESTION: Have you ever looked this up? Are there\nany -- have you come across this kind of a problem?\nMS. BLATT: I think it's -- it's clearly an -- as\nJustice Ginsburg said, it's not an article 3 problem. Let\nme say, Justice Breyer, there's no finding that there was\nreasonable suspicion, nor do we put on any evidence that\nwould have permitted that.\nQUESTION: No, all there is, is there happens to\nbe, I think, in the record, undisputed facts that the dog\nbarked and that they kicked the gas tank and it was hollow.\nQUESTION: Well, I -- wait a minute -\nQUESTION: Anyway -\nQUESTION: I think the kick of the gas tank or the\ntapping showed it was full, not hollow.\nQUESTION: Full, whatever, whatever, whatever -\nQUESTION: Am I right?\nMS. BLATT: Yes, it was -\nQUESTION: Showed -- showed whatever it wasn't\nsupposed to show.\nQUESTION: Exactly. And I think the dog doesn't\nbark, he just alerts. Is that right?\nQUESTION: All right.\nMS. BLATT: That's right. But let me just say as a\n--\nQUESTION: I know we have an agreement on that.\nMS. BLATT: -- as a prudential matter -\nQUESTION: Are we sure that there was reasonable\nsuspicion?\nMS. BLATT: No, there's no -\nQUESTION: Or is it just possible that there was -\nthat there reasonable suspicion?\nMS. BLATT: There's no finding, Justice Scalia. It\nis our position that we could have put on proof that this\nconstituted reasonable suspicion by putting the dog's\nhandler on and the agent explaining what a -- what a solid-\nsounding tap means. We didn't do that, so there's no\nfinding, but let me just say -\nQUESTION: But the Ninth Circuit would require\nevidence of the training of the particular dog and so forth?\nMS. BLATT: Well, at least that the defense is\ntitled to discovery on that so that the -- the handler. But\nlet me just say, Justice Breyer, as a prudential matter, I\nthink that that is a legitimate concern at the petition\nstage when we petitioned, and there was no secret that we\nintentionally brought this case for the purpose of having it\nreviewed. But the case has been briefed, there's no\nquestion about standing, and we think it's appropriate to\nreach the issue. Twenty-five percent of all drug seizures\nalong the Mexican border are hidden in gas tanks, that we've\nnot only found marijuana, cocain, heroin, currency,\nmethamphetamine, there have weapons and ammunition -\nQUESTION: Does it matter how -- how much you have\nto take apart of a car to make a search? Does that enter\ninto the ultimate resolution in the Government's view or do\nwe look at how easy it is to remove a gas tank and look at\nit? Does that matter?\nMS. BLATT: Well, it might matter, but it certainly\ndoesn't matter where the -- the compartment or container in\nquestion is designed to be removed and put back together by\nmechanics. A gas tank removal is something that can be done\nwithin a reasonable time and that -\nQUESTION: How much time does it take?\nMS. BLATT: Well, in this case, once the -\nQUESTION: To take it off and put it back?\nMS. BLATT: Well, in this case it took under a half\nan hour, but, Justice O'Connor, I want to stress that in\nother cases, depending on the type of car, it might take an\nhour or two hours, and the last thing we want is our customs\nofficial to be on a Fourth Amendment stopwatch and telling\nthe mechanic to rush. So they need -\nQUESTION: On the 25 percent figure, you say 25\npercent of all seizures from vehicles? Does that include 25\npercent of seizures where you search the person or?\nMS. BLATT: No, it's 20 -\nQUESTION: What's -- the 25 percent is a percentage\nof what?\nMS. BLATT: Twenty-five percent of narcotics\nseizures in terms of amount of seizures along land borders.\nThat doesn't include seaports -\nQUESTION: Oh, 25 percent in terms of quantity?\nMS. BLATT: In terms of number of seizures. It\ndoesn't necessarily mean how much volume, but it's a lot,\ngiven that the gas tank is one of the largest containers.\nQUESTION: But included in that base is seizures\nfrom the person where somebody has it in their pocket and so\nforth?\nMS. BLATT: Yes, that's correct, but -\nQUESTION: Well, the gas tank here had 80 pounds in\nit, didn't it?\nMS. BLATT: Eighty pounds of marijuana with five\ngallons of gas, and that's an enormous amount, and this\ncould have been another -- another -- other dangerous items,\nit doesn't have to be just marijuana. And they have seen it\nall. At the same time, someone does not store personal\neffects in their gas tank. It's just a repository for fuel.\nAnd this involved far less of an intrusion on privacy\ninterest than the type of searches that can happen and do\nhappen at the border, such as the traveler's baggage and the\npassenger compartments in the vehicle.\nQUESTION: May I ask of you if the Government has\nprocedures in place for the cases in which inadvertently\nthey damage the car or -- or maybe the thing might blow up\non some occasion or something like that? What -- what's\nremedy does the citizen or the maybe an alien or the citizen\nhave in that situation?\nMS. BLATT: Any time there's damage to any types of\nproperty at the border, the person is handed a claims form,\nwhich is processed through customs, first under the Federal\nTort Claims Act. Now, there's an exemption for claims\narising out of the tension of properties by customs under 28\nU.S.C. 2680(c), but assuming that happens, customs can pay,\nand does pay, up to $1,000 under the Small Claims Act, under\n31 U.S.C. 3723. And Justice Stevens, there's another\nstatute, a customs-specific statute, 19 U.S.C. 1630, that\nwould permit customs to pay up to $50,000, but the\nrestriction is for -- it has to be for non-commercial\nproperties, so that would be personal property that customs\ndamage. So there's -\nQUESTION: I would think there are a lot of cases,\nrepair bills are getting pretty expensive now, where $1,000\nwouldn't cover it, the damage to a car.\nMS. BLATT: Well, that may be, Your Honor, but this\ncase doesn't involve claim of damage and -\nQUESTION: No, I just -- but it's -- it's sort of\nin the background as we're asking whether it's reasonable in\nthe -- in the -- in an ultimate sense, and I just -- that's\none of the things that I'm concerned about is -\nMS. BLATT: Well, sure, a gas tank is about $100,\n$200 item, and it's conceivable that any search can result\nin damage. Now, respondent has never claimed -\nQUESTION: You mean to repair it or to replace it?\nMS. BLATT: Well, you're right. You could have -\nyou could have -\nQUESTION: When you say $100, to reconnect it,\nit's about $100?\nMS. BLATT: That's right. You would -- no, the\nitem itself probably costs under $200, but you would have\nlabor costs.\nQUESTION: Well, that's not true. I recently had\nto get one, and it's quite expensive, I can tell you.\n(Laughter.)\nMS. BLATT: Well, depending on the car, the ones\nI've seen have been under $200, but you would have\nassociated labor costs and maybe other parts. But the basic\npoint is that this is a container, it's a paradigmatic type\nof item that can be opened up by the -- at the border\nwithout any particularized suspicion. And -\nQUESTION: Ms. -- Ms. Blatt, may I just go back\nbefore you go on with your argument to follow up on Justice\nStevens' question? You spoke of the $50,000 limit as being\nfor damage or, I guess, destruction of non-commercial\nproperty. Does -- does the non-commercial mean, as I would\nassume it would mean, that a truck or lorry that is driven\nas a -- as a carrier would not be covered, damage to that\nwould not be covered by the $50,000 coverage?\nMS. BLATT: That's right. And property is -\nQUESTION: So if the -- if the -- if the truck, I\nmean, if the commercial truck catches fire as a result\nbecause there's a spark in the gas tank and everything goes\nup in flames, in effect there's no redress?\nMS. BLATT: Well, I don't know too many commercial\nimporters that don't have insurance that would cover damage\nby customs, but the important thing is -\nQUESTION: No, but the customs isn't going to pay\nfor it.\nMS. BLATT: Customs is not going to pay for that.\nQUESTION: But this would happen in a -\nMS. BLATT: But -\nQUESTION: -- reasonable search too, wouldn't it?\nMS. BLATT: Excuse me?\nQUESTION: I'm -- this would happen in a search\nwhere there is probable cause as well, it could happen,\ncouldn't it? When there's -- when there's reasonable\nsuspicion, the same thing could happen, couldn't it? And\nyou also wouldn't have to pay for the truck?\nMS. BLATT: Well, that -- that's absolutely true,\nbut -\nQUESTION: Right, and you would also -\nQUESTION: And that would -- and that would not\nrender what was otherwise a reasonable search unreasonable,\nwould it?\nMS. BLATT: It would depend. As long -- assuming\nthey're acting reasonably in carrying out the search, it's\nstill reasonable and -\nQUESTION: The mere fact that there's no\ncompensation for actual damage, accidental damage to -- to\nthe truck would not render the reasonable search\nunreasonable if there were suspicion, right?\nMS. BLATT: That's correct.\nQUESTION: And the reason -\nQUESTION: So why should it do it here?\nMS. BLATT: There have been thousands of\ndisassemblies at the border -\nQUESTION: But isn't -- isn't the point that in -\nin the -- in the hypothetical that Justice Scalia puts, with\nthe probable cause, we start with the assumption that the\noffices are in there acting reasonably. The question in\nthis case is posed by Justice Stevens' question. Would the\npotential for damage -- is it reasonable to go in there in\nthe first place without probable cause? So that is a\ndifferent issue, isn't it?\nMS. BLATT: Well, no, I think it's reasonable to\nsearch property at the border by virtue of the fact it's at\nthe border, and given the Government's overriding interest\nand the person's reduced expectations. But Justice Souter,\nthere has been no known or reported instance of this\nhypothetical risk materializing at the border with respect\nto a customs search.\nQUESTION: Ms. Blatt, you mentioned, you started to\ngive a number, 1,000 searches, fuel tank searches, and then\nyou gave a number earlier about how many gas tanks turned\nout to have contraband or something. Do you know what\npercentage of those gas tanks were -- was there disassembly\nand what percentage were done by a less intrusive means by\nthe dog and the tapping on the fuel tank?\nMS. BLATT: Well, all gas tank seizures, which\nthere have been thousands, have to be done by removal and\ndisassembly of the tank. There are, you could call them\nsearches, because that's what they are, of gas tanks that\ndon't involve removal and disassembly, if you use\nsophisticated equipment such as density busters and X-rays.\nBut all these seizures that are occurring at the border, in\norder to get to the drugs, you have to unscrew the bolts\nthat are holding the tank to the undercarriage of the\nvehicle and remove the tank and open it up.\nQUESTION: Is the practice then to just go straight\nto that procedure and skip the dog and the tapping, or do\nthey go through the whole thing?\nMS. BLATT: Well, they have dogs at all the major\nports of entry, but the dogs don't always alert, so I\nwouldn't say it's necessarily skipping, but the dog may not\nalert. They also at some of the facilities have what are\nknown as fiber optic scopes, which are extremely\nsophisticated and effective equipment. Unfortunately, 75\npercent or higher of all tanks have, in the filler tube,\nhave an anti-siphoning valve that blocks the entry of the\nscope into the tank, but they will try that if they have it.\nIt's not always available. It's an extremely expensive\npiece of equipment. It costs $16,000 per unit. But if they\nhave that, presumably they try that first, and if it's\nblocked, then they put the car up on a lift and unscrew the\nmetal bolts that are holding them that -- to the metal\nstraps that are holding the tank and they'll remove the\ntank. And then from there on it's pretty straightforward on\nhow to open up the tank.\nQUESTION: But if we -- if you prevail in this case\nand they don't have to do that, they can just say it's good\nenough to go right to the disassembly and we don't have to\nbother with dogs and maintaining dogs and anything else?\nMS. BLATT: Yeah, that's right. Our position is\nwhere the procedure imposes only a modest intrusion on\ninterests protected by the Fourth Amendment, the officers\ndon't have to exhaust every least intrusive method.\nQUESTION: Obviously that would be the result if we\nwere to support the Government's view here, and I think\nwe're interested in knowing how often people's gas tanks\nwould be disassembled if the Government's view prevails\nhere. How many times percentage-wise would people crossing\na land border expect to have their gas tank removed if the\nGovernment prevails here?\nMS. BLATT: It's -- it's -\nQUESTION: I mean, let's say 1,000 cars cross the\nborder point in an hour. What percentage of those will have\ntheir gas tanks removed?\nMS. BLATT: Not very many, Justice O'Connor. Let\nme give you these statistics. There have been 120 million\nvehicles that passed through this country's borders last\nyear, and over the last four years, four years, there have\nbeen 8,000 gas tank disassemblies.\nQUESTION: Yeah, but you didn't have this rule\nestablished that you didn't need reasonable suspicion. What\nwe're asking you to speculate on is if the Government\nprevails and we say, fine, you can take the gas tank off,\nyou don't have to have any degree of reasonable suspicion.\nThen how many will there be?\nMS. BLATT: Exactly the same. It has always been\nthe rule up until the Ninth Circuit that we could take apart\na gas tank without reasonable suspicion. Customs officials\n--\nQUESTION: Have any of the other circuits followed\nthe Ninth Circuit's -- other circuits have that -- which\nhave land borders?\nMS. BLATT: No, no, they've always been able to\ntake apart a gas tank on something less than reasonable\nsuspicion. But Justice O'Connor, it is true that as a\npractical matter customs does not take the time or energy to\ntake -- to call the mechanic, pay for the mechanic to take\napart the gas tank unless their suspicions are focused on\nthe gas tank, and it will usually be because of the dog\nalerts, or the more common situation is it -- that they're\njust not sure whether that gas tank has been altered. Maybe\na bolt looks different than another bolt or it looks like\nit's been unscrewed, and it may be the person had their gas\ntank worked on, but they're just not sure, they have some\nconcern about the person's travel plan story and so they -\nthey want to go ahead and make sure the gas tank's not\ncontaining contraband.\nQUESTION: Suppose -- suppose you prevail. Are\nthere any regulations or -- or procedures under which you'll\nkeep statistics and data, so that say over -- suppose you\nprevail, then over the next five years we can -- we can look\nback and see that there have been 10,000 searches and\ncontraband has been discovered only 5 percent of the time or\nsomething?\nMS. BLATT: Yes, they keep statistics on seizures\nof narcotics and what are known as positive and negative\nseizures. And in the last four years of the 8,000 gas tank\nseizures that have happened, 85 to 90 percent of those have\nbeen what are known as positive hits or there's been a\npresence of contraband, and so 10 to 15 percent of those\nhave been so-called negative searches where the tank is\nreassembled and the motorist sent on their way, and I -- we\nwould expect that those statistics to continue, that they\nhave limited resources and they conduct a search when they\nthink it's appropriate and necessary.\nQUESTION: But you don't know of the 8,000 what\npercent were without any suspicion?\nMS. BLATT: No, but there's never been any kind of\nrequirement. I -- I think we can -\nQUESTION: All right. So -\nMS. BLATT: -- confidently say their suspicions\nwere focused on the gas tank, whether or not that that would\nhave convinced a court that it was reasonable under -\nQUESTION: Yeah, I see.\nMS. BLATT: -- this Court's definition I think is\nunclear.\nQUESTION: Are there any rules or administrative\nprocedures in the customs that would say -- that would apply\nin respect to suspicionless searches of gas tanks? For\nexample, random searches, do it once a month or here's -- we\nhave a random program or we check up to see how it's going\nor -- are there -- are -- is it just each customs agent for\nhimself when -- if you win, is it each customs agent for\nhimself with no check whatsoever?\nMS. BLATT: No, well --\nQUESTION: Or are there internal administrative\nchecks that would be a kind of substitute for a judicial\ncheck?\nMS. BLATT: There are extensive training of customs\nofficials -\nQUESTION: But what does it say -\nMS. BLATT: -- about how to go about searching a\ncar, where to look, where -- where smugglers typically hide\ntheir drugs, and what type of evidence they may leave\nbehind, and that's what the agent is looking for. The\nagents are also trained though, Justice Breyer, to rely on\ntheir experience and intuition and hunches, and over time\nborder officials gather extensive experience about what\nthey're looking for.\nQUESTION: When -\nMS. BLATT: They also can consult with a supervisor\nif they have a question about whether a search should\nactually be done.\nQUESTION: So, for example, you have a customs\nagent whose experience leads him to believe that parents\nwith small children are more likely to be smuggling heroin.\nNow, this would be an odd customs agent. Is there anything\nin the system that would discover that this is the person\nwho's doing all the suspicionless checks and something's\ngone wrong here, so there's -- do you see what I'm looking\nfor?\nMS. BLATT: Well, his -\nQUESTION: I'm looking for some way of -\nMS. BLATT: -- supervisor would be aware of the\nsearch, but with a 85 to 90 percent success rate, that\npossibility seems rather remote.\nQUESTION: But then you have the suspicion searches\nin that 85 percent. I'm trying to figure out if we have\neach customs agent for himself to conduct whatever\nsuspicionless searches he wants, and you have a few of the,\nperhaps in every organization there are a few unusual ones\nwho cause some problems, are there any internal checks\nwithin the system, because you're going to not have a\njudicial check? I wonder if there are any administrative\nways.\nMS. BLATT: There may be checks where people can\nfile complaints, I don't know. But the same officer could\nbe instructing that the spare tire compartment be taken\napart or that a tire be taken out or that every scrap of\nluggage can be taken off or that the person could empty\ntheir wallets, their shoes, their purses, their clothing,\nand put the person to a considerable inconvenience.\nBut a gas tank is not a container, Your Honor,\nthat there's some sort of heightened expectation of privacy.\nIt stores fuel.\nQUESTION: So assume that if there's any de facto\ncheck, there's more likely a check on the gas tank than\nthere is on emptying your wallet and taking your shoes off\nand everything else, namely the expense that it causes to\nthe customs service in time -- in terms of the time of its\nagents, and I suppose you have to pay these mechanics that\ncome and do it.\nMS. BLATT: Yeah, it's about -- cost runs about a\ncost of $90 to $140 per visit, but Justice Scalia, there are\nalso, very consistent with your point, hundreds of cars in a\nlane that this inspector has to get through, and they always\nare concerned about moving through the legitimate traffic\nand legitimate trade. They want to get people in, they want\nto get people past the border. At the same time, they're\nextremely concerned about what's in -- what people might be\nconcealing in their vehicles, and a vehicle is an extremely\nlarge container and a gas tank is a relatively large\ncontainer, and given that it is 25 percent of all drug\nseizures have been hidden in the gas tank, they have an\nessential interest in being able to not only detect it when\nthey think it might be there, but also deter it.\nIt has been customs' experience over many, many\nyears that smugglers are looking to exploit any weakness\nalong our border security efforts, and they will readily\nplace their drugs where they're least likely to be detected.\nQUESTION: Does that mean, for example, that you\ncould rip out all the upholstery because you can hide drugs\ninside the upholstery?\nMS. BLATT: Well, ripping out the upholstery would\nfirst present a question of what kind of intrusion there is\non -- under the Fourth Amendment or an interest protected on\nthe Fourth Amendment, and there may be a significant\ndeprivation of a property interest. Now, we would probably\ncontend that we could rip whatever upholstery was reasonably\nnecessary to conduct the search.\nQUESTION: I thought -- I thought you would, and\nmaybe I'm recalling your brief incorrectly, but I thought\nyou -- you made a distinction between the kind of intrusive\nbodily search like a strip search and said that's the only\none where you would need reasonable suspicion. All others,\nall that involve only property and not the person, the rule\nshould be at the border, anything goes, no reasonable\nsuspicion required. Is that the position the Government is\ntaking?\nMS. BLATT: There's a small nuanced caveat to that.\nWe think we can search property without suspicion and use\nwhatever force is reasonably necessary. At the same time,\nJustice Ginsburg, the Constitution still applies with\nrespect to the property and the search has to be carried out\nin a reasonable manner, and if someone took a giant axe and\nstarting whacking away at leather upholstery, that would\nvery well constitute an unreasonable search.\nBut this case doesn't involve a claim of damage\nand respondent has never said that he was deprived of a\nsignificant possessory interest in his gas tank. Rather,\nwhat happened, it was taken apart and it could have been\neasily put back together.\nQUESTION: But your -- your answer to my question\nabout property is, as long as you're not wantonly\ndestructive, you can -- any -- anything that's in the car as\ndistinguished from a person?\nMS. BLATT: That's our -- that would be our\nposition, but I'm saying it also involves a very distinct\nfactor, and that is that there's a deprivation of a\nsignificant property interest if the item is going to be\nobliterated or its value going to be destroyed, and that's\nnot the contention made in this case or the type of\ndeprivation of a privacy -- of property interests you would\nhave with a gas tank. But sure, if you took a vase and\nsmashed it when you could have looked in it, or let me just\nsay if you wanted to open up the trunk -\nQUESTION: Well, but not just on the -- the -- if\nyou smash it unnecessarily, but suppose the only way to get\nbehind the fabric in say a seat cushion or something like\nthat is to cut it open. It -- does your policy apply to\nthat situation too?\nMS. BLATT: Well -\nQUESTION: Because I don't suppose you have a\nseamstress who sews up the seat right away.\nMS. BLATT: Right. Well, we would look at first\nwhat the type of deprivation is, and if it's a teeny little\ntear that can be easily repaired, maybe there's not a\nsignificant deprivation.\nQUESTION: But suppose it's something that cannot\nbe repaired.\nMS. BLATT: Let's -\nQUESTION: You have to cut up a seat -- a seat\ncushion. What -- what do you do?\nMS. BLATT: Let's suppose that there's a\nsignificant deprivation. It would at least be reasonable\nfor the court to look at what kinds of alternatives were\navailable to the Government. As a practical matter, Justice\nStevens, we -- customs officials have long, skinny metal\nprobes which are like needles that they use to search\nupholstery, so if it's fabric you wouldn't even see it going\nin and out. If it's leather, you probably are going to get\na tiny hole. Now, whether that would constitute a\nsignificant deprivation -\nQUESTION: I see.\nMS. BLATT: -- might turn on the facts and\ncircumstances, but these are wonderful pieces of equipment\nthat customs officials use all the time to look inside\nplaces that are hard to see, and they use them exactly on\nseats.\nBut to be sure, Justice Stevens, customs gets\ncomplaints about upholstery. They let a dog into a car and\nthe dog scratches the upholstery or the agent's going in\nthere and searching and he steps on something.\nThese kinds of things happen at the border and\ncustoms have to -- have a job to do and they've got to use\nwhatever force is reasonably necessary. But I think these\ncases are separate because they involve some arguably\nsignificant deprivation of the owner's possessory interest\nin that piece of property.\ntorn, the value's gone down.\nBut the Ninth Circuit applies a rule that doesn't\nlet customs officials open up a container even where they\ncan put it back without damaging the tank, and so we think\nthat case is quite distinct.\nMr. Chief Justice, I'd like to reserve the balance\nof my time.\nQUESTION: Very well, Ms. Blatt.\nMr. Hubachek. Am I pronouncing your name\ncorrectly?\nMR. HUBACHEK: Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF STEVEN F. HUBACHEK\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. HUBACHEK: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please\nthe Court:\nThe Court's decision in Montoya established that\nfor a search other than the routine border search,\nreasonable suspicion was required.\nQUESTION: Well, Mr. -- Mr. Hubachek, Montoya\ndiscussed that in the context of a search of the person. It\n-- it said we reserve judgment on whether a strip search of\nhis body --- it was talking about people, not gas tanks.\nMR. HUBACHEK: Absolutely, Mr. Chief Justice, but\nfour courts of appeals have unanimously applied the analysis\nin Montoya to searches of property or effects under the\nFourth Amendment. The Ninth Circuit's decision in Molina-\nTarazon is consistent with those cases in that it applied\nthe Montoya paradigm to the search of the gas tank and the\nseizure of the gas tank.\nQUESTION: Well, would you say that a ship coming\nin at a port in our country from elsewhere cannot be\nsearched thoroughly without reasonable suspicion?\nMR. HUBACHEK: A ship could be searched thoroughly\nwithout reasonable suspicion. I -- but -\nQUESTION: But a land vehicle coming from, for\nexample, Mexico at the land border crossing cannot be?\nMR. HUBACHEK: Well, I -- the distinction that I\nwould draw would be the point -\nQUESTION: What is the difference?\nMR. HUBACHEK: -- of disassembly. I don't think\nthat you can disassemble conveyances that come to the\nborder.\nQUESTION: You think that if the ship came in that\nthe gas tank could be removed and examined for presence of\nillegal goods?\nMR. HUBACHEK: I -- I don't think that it would be\nreasonable to disassemble a ship either, particularly in\nlight of all of the various methods that are available. I\ndon't think it's supported historically either. You know,\nthe initial statutes that the Solicitor General cited in the\nbrief don't support any sort of disassembly of conveyances,\nthe -- particularly the 1790 statute. What it talks about\nis allowing customs officials on board to look around, to\nmark items, to take records and so on and so forth, and then\nwhen items are being passed through customs, then the\ncustoms officer -\nQUESTION: But in today's world, the figures, the\nstatistics are staggering about how many narcotics are\nbrought into our country by way of the use of gas tanks. I\nmean, that's an incredibly large figure.\nMR. HUBACHEK: And I certainly would --\nQUESTION: And -- and what are we supposed to do\nabout that?\nMR. HUBACHEK: Well, Justice O'Connor, I think that\nwhat we're supposed to do about it is to use the methods\nthat are tried and true by the customs service itself. If\nthe customs service itself wants to move away from\ndismantling-type searches into searches that involve the use\nof the -- their technology -\nQUESTION: Well, they have to dismantle to get into\na gas tank where it -- the opening will not permit the entry\nof a -- the little looking device.\nMR. HUBACHEK: Well, sometimes -- maybe in the\nbrief I was too excited by all this technology that's\navailable, but I think that sometimes it's important to\nstart back at the initial things. Molina-Tarazon, for\ninstance, the case that developed this rule, found\nreasonable suspicion based upon mud spatterings on the\nbottom of the tank. Carreon, the Tenth Circuit decision,\nfound reasonable suspicion in large part based upon the fact\nthat certain bolts were shiny. So -\nQUESTION: Mr. Hubachek, now you say, you give the\nimpression that all courts of appeals have agreed with the\nNinth Circuit. Ms. Blatt gave the impression, at least to\nme, that the Ninth Circuit was alone on this. What is the\nstate of decisions, say in the Fifth Circuit, which has so\nmuch land border like the Ninth Circuit?\nMR. HUBACHEK: Mr. Chief Justice, no court but the\nNinth Circuit has addressed this specific issue here, the\ndismantling of gas tanks. The Fifth Circuit, though, has\nheld -\nQUESTION: Is it not done along the Texas border?\nMR. HUBACHEK: I'm sure it is done, but there just\nhasn't been a case that has arisen.\nQUESTION: But there hasn't been a reported case\nwhere it was challenged?\nMR. HUBACHEK: That's correct. But however, the\nFifth Circuit has decided that intrusive searches of\nproperty are subject to the Montoya analysis and that\nreasonable suspicion is required in a drilling case called\nRivas. And in that case, you know, they used a drill to\ndrill into the vehicle.\nQUESTION: Is -- is it the -- you -- you described\nthe search as intrusive, but as I understand it, your\nobjection is not to the intrusion, your objection is to the\ndisassembly.\nMR. HUBACHEK: Yeah, yes, that's correct.\nQUESTION: So -- so the -- the -- I -- I assume\nyour objection rests on either or both of these grounds,\neither the value of the property, which is either lessened\nor placed at risk, or the inconvenience to the driver and\npassenger while the -- while the intrusion or the\ndisassembly goes on. Which is it?\nMR. HUBACHEK: I would say it's both of those and I\nthink that the -- of course, the Court's Soldal decision\nestablishes that a meaningful interference, even if there's\nno privacy interest at all, still implicates the Fourth\nAmendment. But certainly there are issues with respect to\nvalue. If my gas tank has been dis -\nQUESTION: All right, you know, what is the issue\non value? They'll put it back together again, there's\napparently no record that -- that these things blow up all\nthe time.\nMR. HUBACHEK: Well -\nQUESTION: So -- so what is the -- the property\nconcern?\nMR. HUBACHEK: Well, I think that there a number of\nconcerns. Number one, do -- if I resell the car, do I have\nto disclose that the gas -- the fuel system was\ndisassembled? I mean, what if I have a warranty? Does that\nexclude things from a repair by the warranty because it's\nbeen worked on by someone who's not authorized by Ford or\nwhatever company owns the car? Are there issues with\nemissions? You know, this is a 1987 vehicle that we're\ntalking about and the systems are much more complicated now.\nI just read yesterday a regulation indicating if you have a\n.04 gap, you have to have a sensor that can determine if you\nhave that much leakage, .04 inches, that you have to have a\nsensor that determines that kind of leakage. Would it\nviolate the terms of your lease to have some unauthorized\nperson or some person you don't know about to go ahead and\ndisassemble -\nQUESTION: Your -- your clients weren't worried\nabout all that apparently. I mean, I don't think 60 pounds\nof cocaine was good for the gas tank either, was it?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. HUBACHEK: No, I'm sure that it's not, and\ncertainly you'd have to -\nQUESTION: Is that -- is that the only kind of -- I\nmean, I take it you concede there's no privacy interest\nhere?\nMR. HUBACHEK: Well, I -\nQUESTION: And -- is that right?\nMR. HUBACHEK: It -- it certainly is -- is not a\ntremendous privacy interest.\nQUESTION: Well, is there any?\nQUESTION: Well, all right. So there's no privacy\ninterest and all there is is an interest that you don't want\nthe Government hurting your property, which is conceivable\nin an interest. But on the other hand, they say no privacy\ninterest, conceivable the Government will hurt your\nproperty. Every day of the week we deal with government\npeople might hurt our property. And on the other side, 25\npercent of all the drugs that come into the United States\noutside -- by land, come in in gas tanks, so this is an\noverwhelming interest for letting you do it. After all,\nthey search your suitcases, they search my pockets, they\nsearch every piece of luggage, they -- they search anything\nyou're bringing in, and it's not an unusual thing at a\nborder.\nSo -- so, how -- how do you respond to this strong\ninterest on their side and no privacy interest and very\nlittle property damage risk on the other side?\nMR. HUBACHEK: Well, I don't agree that there's\nvery little property damage risk based on the -- the other\nthings that I've just mentioned. Plus there's also the\nissue of the security of the individual, which was focused\non in Molina-Tarazon, you know, what confidence do you have\nthat this crucial system in your vehicle is going to be\nreliable when it's been taken apart -\nQUESTION: Well, presumably the person filling the\ngas tank with drugs had to disassemble the tank to put the\ndrugs in there, so apparently willing to take that risk -\nMR. HUBACHEK: But -\nQUESTION: -- but not willing to let the customs\nservice do the same thing?\nMR. HUBACHEK: Right. Well, people who smuggle\ndrugs in gas tanks are willing to take a lot of risks, but\nthe average traveler who comes to the border and is faced\nwith the possibility of random disassembly of their gas tank\nis not going to be willing to take those risks.\nQUESTION: Well, how -- how often does that happen\nthat an innocent person has his gas tank person random -\nrandomly disassembled?\nMR. HUBACHEK: Well, there's -- one of the\nweaknesses of this record is -- is that although the customs\nservice claims that it's important for them to be able to do\nrandom disassemblies, they haven't established any sort of\nprogram under which they do random disassemblies, but there\nwere several hundred gas tank disassemblies in which there\nwere no drugs found.\nQUESTION: Well, we were told that 15 percent or 20\npercent of the time nothing is found, 80 or 85 percent\nsomething is. That -- that's my understanding of the\nGovernment's submission.\nMR. HUBACHEK: Right. And I think that that\nsupports the notion that when they act upon suspicion and\ntheir experiences, we've heard detail this morning that they\ncan be effective. That doesn't mean though that it's\nessential to have the ability randomly to disassemble based\nupon those suspicions.\nQUESTION: They're not talking about randomly.\nThey're -- they're talking about -- I -- I think -- I think\nMs. Blatt said hunches. I mean, there, you know, there -\nthere are just some intuitions that agents get that may not\nrise to the level of what a court may acknowledge is an\narticulable suspicion, and they shouldn't -- they shouldn't\nhave to worry about whether they have to prove that or not.\nI -- do you really think they're going to do it when -- when\nthere's no reason whatever to do it?\nMR. HUBACHEK: Well, that -- that's the problem\nwith absolute discretion. Any -- any officer across the\nUnited States can make the rules for that particular day.\nBut I think that it's important to bear in mind that these\nhunches have, you know, there are many -\nQUESTION: But we're talking about border searches\nwith customs officials who are trained and they have limited\nbudgets. Why do they want to pay the cost of having a\nmechanic disassemble an engine unless they have a good\nreason for doing it? I mean, it's inconceivable to me that\nthey try to run up the number just to run up the number.\nIt's too expensive. They don't have that kind of money.\nMR. HUBACHEK: Well, I think that any seizures that\nthe Court has required there actually be founded suspicion\nare troublesome for the officers. I mean, if they pull\npeople over randomly, that's time that's taken away from\nother activities that they could be undertaking, so there's\nalways a natural disinclination to do that. But that\ndoesn't change the fact that this Court has repeatedly in -\nQUESTION: But -- but not as easily observed and\nnot as easily recorded by supervisors. I mean, it seems to\nme if you have an agent who repeatedly has a -- cars backing\nup at the -- at the gate that -- that he's controlling, and\nwho repeatedly comes up empty on -- on gas tank searches,\nthat fellow's not going to be there very long. I mean, it,\nit's easy to observe somebody who's abusing the system, it\nseems to me.\nMR. HUBACHEK: Well, again, I think that it's\nimportant though that officers not be able to act\narbitrarily across the United States.\nnecessarily going to be limited to one officer so that we'll\nalways be able to weed them out.\nQUESTION: In -- in your answer to Justice Souter's\nquestion a few minutes ago, you said that not only was the\nproperty interest important, but the inconvenience was a -\nwas a factor, and I don't know that we've ever said much\nabout that that would -- would support it. Certainly\nthere's going to be some inconvenience any time you cross a\nborder, and this thing, if it takes half an hour, is that\nreally a Fourth Amendment factor?\nMR. HUBACHEK: Well, I -- I think it's a factor,\nbut I don't think it's as important as the other factors\nwe've talked about, the potential diminution in value, the\nlack of security upon the -- the individual who's driving\naway in a vehicle that's been altered by unknown\nindividuals, and the fact that, you know, that -\nQUESTION: When you -- when you -- once you -- you\n-- the -- the trunk is fair game, any luggage is fair game,\nfancy Gucci shoes might be fair game, it seems to me that\nthe fuel tank, if we're looking at it from the point of view\nof the -- the -- how much damage there might be or the cost,\nis -- is a lesser thing than personal items, and also that\nthe privacy interest is much stronger in what we already say\ncan be done without suspicion.\nMR. HUBACHEK: I -- I agree that the suspicion -\nthat the privacy interest in the gas tank is not as high as\nthe other items that you've mentioned. However, it still is\ntrue that when you put your Gucci shoes on, you're planning\nto take them off, so if an officer takes them off to look at\nthem, that's not a problem. If they open up your luggage,\nyour luggage is expected to be opened, and in fact, 1461\nrequires that you furnish an opportunity to open up that\nluggage. But no one expects that their gas tank when they\nbuy a new car to a tremendous expense that they put their\nfamily in, no one expects that that part of their vehicle is\ngoing to be open like they know that their luggage is.\nQUESTION: One other question is whether it is\nunreasonable to -- to require them to expect it if they're\nrunning their car back and forth across the border? I mean\n--\nMR. HUBACHEK: Well, I -- don't think that it's -\nQUESTION: What -- why is it wrong? What -- what\ntest do you -- do you urge as to -- as to when -- when a\nsearch by border agents cannot be done? What -- what is the\ncriteria?\nMR. HUBACHEK: I think when it involves disassembly\nof property and -\nQUESTION: Anything that involves disassembly. So\n-- so what about taking the cap off of a -- off of a bottle\nthat's there. Is that -- is that disassembly?\nMR. HUBACHEK: Well, I think the cap off the bottle\nis similar to the luggage. You would just open up the cap\nand that -- that's what's expected to happen, but no one -\nQUESTION: What if the bottle's sealed? I mean,\nyou know, it's -- it's -- it's a sealed bottle?\nMR. HUBACHEK: I -- I guess -\nQUESTION: You have to break the seal.\nMR. HUBACHEK: That could result, I mean, that may\nbe necessary -\nQUESTION: That can't be done?\nMR. HUBACHEK: That may -- it may be situations\nwhere that shouldn't be done without -\nQUESTION: Suppose it's the same as a -- suppose\nthere's a terrorism problem and -\nQUESTION: Wow.\nQUESTION: -- they say that we want to search every\nfifteenth truck that comes in, there might be anthrax or\nbombs or whatever and we want to give the agents the power\nto look thoroughly into these big trucks even without\nsuspicion. Now were you saying the Fourth Amendment would\nstop that?\nMR. HUBACHEK: If we're talking about a specific\nthreat, where there is, you know, a specific -\nQUESTION: No, no, non-specific threat, it's the\npresent situation. The Government simply says, we're\nworried about our borders, they're not secure, and we want\nto look at the trucks, that we want the -- the customs\nagents to be able to look at trucks that are coming in.\nThey may have dangerous items on -- in -- on board, and we\nwant them to look whenever they want. It's at the border,\njust like your purse, just like your valise, just like your\nbag. Now, what -- what's your view of -- is your case the\nsame, different, or what do you think of that case?\nMR. HUBACHEK: I -- I think -- I don't think that\n- that suspicionless searches under those circumstances\nwould be reasonable because there's not been any showing\nthat random searches or disassemblies of gas tanks would be\nat all effective. In Delaware v. Prouse, this Court\ndisapproved the process of pulling over people randomly to\ncheck registrations, both because it was not demonstrated to\nbe effective, but also because it was not demonstrated to\nhave any sort of deterrent effect.\nQUESTION: All right, so in your view,\nsuspicionless searches of trucks, whether for bombs,\nanthrax, weapons, or drugs all stand or fall together?\nMR. HUBACHEK: Well, I think that -- I think that\nthere -- at least with the every 15 cars, there would be\nmore of a deterrent because then they would know that every\nfifteenth car is being searched, but there is no program in\nplace now, there was nothing offered below, in fact, there\nwas no evidence offered below -\nQUESTION: That's a different question. My\nquestion was, do they stand or fall together?\nMR. HUBACHEK: Right. I -- I think that the -\nthat our case is stronger than your hypothetical.\nQUESTION: Delaware against Prouse had nothing to\ndo with the border. I mean, that was on a highway -- inland\nhighway in Delaware. The Fourth Amendment has always been\nmuch relaxed at the border.\nMR. HUBACHEK: No, I -- I agree with that, Mr.\nChief Justice, but my point from Delaware v. Prouse is that\nin -- in examining a random program, the Court looked to two\nthings. It looked to whether or not it was demonstrated to\nbe effective. It's not demonstrated to be effective here.\nAnd it also looked to whether or not there was going to be a\ndeterrent effect from it, and there was no -\nQUESTION: But -- but you just can't transplant a\ncase involving a car on a highway inland to the border.\nMR. HUBACHEK: No, I understand. My point is -- is\nthat the empirical evidence was important in the Delaware v.\nProuse case, and that's how this Court distinguished it in\nSitz, which is a case that the Solicitor General cited in\nsupport of the notion that the Court shouldn't look to other\nalternatives.\nQUESTION: What -- what do you do about United\nStates v. Ross when -- when you're urging your -- your -\nyour disassembly point?\nMR. HUBACHEK: Well -\nQUESTION: Now that -- that was a case involving a\nborder search statute, not -- not the one at issue here, to\nbe sure, but nonetheless what we said, to quote it, is\ncertainly Congress intended custom officers to open shipping\ncontainers when necessary and not merely to examine the\nexterior of cartons or boxes in which smuggled goods might\nbe concealed. During virtually the entire history of our\ncountry, whether contraband was transported in a horse-drawn\ncarriage, a 1921 roadster, or a modern automobile, it was\nbeen assumed that a lawful search of a vehicle would include\nsearch of any container that might include the object of the\n-- of the search.\nMR. HUBACHEK: Well, I -- I think that -\nQUESTION: Now, why isn't that applicable here?\nMR. HUBACHEK: I think that it -- actually, it's\nconsistent with our position, because the statutes that Ross\nwas talking about were the statutes from 1789 and 1790 that\nI was referring to earlier, and what they allowed was the\ncustoms officers to go on board the ships to mark things and\nto make their records and so on and so forth, and then the\npackages would then be opened by the customs officer, and\nthe first Congress thought this was a very significant act,\nbecause not only did they require the customs officer to\nopen up the packages, but they had to have two reputable\nwitnesses, merchants outside the customs service, to observe\nthose. So that was a very significant event.\nBut nothing in those statutes allowed disassembly\nof vessels. It, in fact, it did authorize -\nQUESTION: Well, now, your -- your -- your position\nis -- is -- is any container, you're not just talking about\ngas tank, you say nothing can be disassembled. So if I have\nsome gizmo that is assembled and is not meant to be opened\nagain, you say if I bring that across the border the customs\nagent can't look into it.\nMR. HUBACHEK: Well, they can look into it with all\nof the -- the various abilities that they have. If they\nhave -\nQUESTION: They can't open it.\nMR. HUBACHEK: If they have reasonable -\nQUESTION: They can't -- they can't open it.\nMR. HUBACHEK: If they have reasonable suspicion,\nthey can.\nQUESTION: No, but without reasonable suspicion.\nI'm -\nMR. HUBACHEK: No, I don't think they can open up\nthe gizmo without reasonable suspicion, but they still have\nall of the abilities they have to bring to bear on that, all\nthe -- the experience, all of their technology, all of their\nability to examine things.\nQUESTION: I think I -- I -- I lost what you were\nsaying when you started referring to the gizmo. If -- if I\nbring in -- if I buy a valuable statue in Europe and I have\nit elaborately crated so it won't be hurt in transport, when\nit gets to New York, can they open the crate to see what's\ninside?\nMR. HUBACHEK: Yes, they can, and that would be\nconsistent with the 1790 statute, which said that you could\nopen up the packages.\nQUESTION: All right. So the difference between\nthe crate and the gas tank is, I take it, your concern that\nafter they've put the gas tank back together, there may be\nsome risk that it won't function or that the emissions\nsystem will be affected? I mean, is that where you draw the\nline between the crate and the tank?\nMR. HUBACHEK: Well, I think that the -- the line\nthat I'm drawing is -- is the line that was drawn by the\nfirst Congress when they said that you can open up packages\nand they didn't provide any additional authority on board\nthe vessels -\nQUESTION: Well -\nMR. HUBACHEK: -- to disassemble -\nQUESTION: Yeah, but you're -- you're arguing a\nconstitutional restriction here. Your -- your argument is\nnot that Congress has not provided the authority. Your\nargument is Congress can't provide the authority. So what,\nit seems to me what Justice Souter is asking is, if Congress\ncan provide the authority to uncrate the statue, what\nconstitutional prohibition is there to uncrating the gas\ntank?\nMR. HUBACHEK: Well, of course, in their brief, the\nSolicitor Generals argued that that statute is -- does go\nalong with the constitutional protection, so I think that\nthe fact that the same Congress that passed the Fourth\nAmendment had this narrow view of what you can open,\npackages with the two witnesses there. And they were also\nobligated if there was -\nQUESTION: No, but, I mean, we -- we didn't have\nthis problem in 1790 or 1799, and the question is, what is\nthe difference in principle for constitutional purposes\nbetween opening up, disassembling my crate, and\ndisassembling the gas tank? And the only thing that I can\nthink of is, based on what you've said so far, is the\nconcern that maybe the gas tank won't work or I'll have to\ndisclose it to a subsequent purchaser, or the emissions\nsystem will be hurt. Do you have anything else to\ndistinguish in principle between the -- the uncrating and\nthe opening of the tank?\nMR. HUBACHEK: Well -- well, yes. There's also the\nnotion of the -- that was relied upon in Molina-Tarazon, the\nsecurity of the individual who's in the vehicle, and there's\nalso the -\nQUESTION: Well, the security is -- is the -- is\nthe concern that maybe the tank won't work or -- or are you\nsaying maybe -- maybe the -- it'll blow up? Is that what\nyou mean by the security?\nMR. HUBACHEK: Right, yeah.\nQUESTION: Okay. Well, the individual, I assume,\nis not in the car when they take the tank out, so we're\ntalking simply about property damage. When they uncrate the\nstatue, they might knock the hand off, but they can still\nuncrate the statue. What -- anything else in principle\nbetween the two situations?\nMR. HUBACHEK: Well, I think that crates are\nintended to be open. If, you know, you packed it carefully\nand ultimately you intend to unpack it, so you intend to\npack the -- the crate. I don't think it's reasonable though\nto disassemble a valuable piece of property that has safety\nimplications -\nQUESTION: So it depends on my intention?\nMR. HUBACHEK: Well, I think what -\nQUESTION: I intend the crate to be opened, but\nwhen I buy a gas tank I don't intend it to be opened?\nMR. HUBACHEK: Right. I think that that's --\nthat's -- if there's -\nQUESTION: But that's not the expectation of\nprivacy test.\nMR. HUBACHEK: No, I think it's -- it's the\nproperty -\nQUESTION: So this is a new test, I take it?\nMR. HUBACHEK: No. Soldal establishes that even if\nthere is no invasion of privacy, there is still a Fourth\nAmendment intrusion if there's a seizure of property. This\nis a meaningful interference with the -- your enjoyment of\nthe possession of your property.\nQUESTION: No, but the distinction between the two\ncases, I take it, now is the intent of the owner of the\nproperty that is disassembled. In the one case, the owner\nultimately intends the crate to be opened up. In the other\ncase, he does not intend the gas tank to be opened up. Is,\nis that it?\nMR. HUBACHEK: Well, I don't think it's a\nsubjective test. I think it would be -- we're talking about\nreasonableness under the Fourth Amendment and -\nQUESTION: Well, if that -- it can't be that he\ndoesn't -- well, expected to be opened up. If it's -- if\nit's a container where things can be carried, one of the\nthings that the Government said in its brief is that if\nluggage is free and then this will become the container of\nchoice, and we know that in a very high percentage there\nhave found drugs there. So it is a container, we know it's\nbeen used as a container. Why should it not be treated like\nany other container?\nMR. HUBACHEK: Well, I think it's different from\nany other container because it's part of a vehicle that was\nnever expected or intended by its designers to be taken\napart in this manner. But I would also say that there's\nbeen 15 years of history in which, you know, courts of\nappeals have applied Montoya to searches of property. If\nsmugglers were changing their patterns in response to those\ndecisions, this -- the Tenth Circuit rendered its decision\n15 years ago, the Fifth Circuit rendered its decision 5\nyears ago. The Government offered no evidence below that\nthere have been changes in smuggling patterns based upon\nthose courts' decisions applying a reasonable suspicion\nstandard.\nQUESTION: Yeah, but those -- those cases it didn't\ninvolve gas tanks, if I understand correctly.\nMR. HUBACHEK: That's -- that's correct. They\ndidn't involve gas tanks, but they involved vehicles, and\nbasically the theory was is that if smugglers -\nQUESTION: May I -- may I ask you a hypothetical?\nSupposing Congress passed a statute specifically authorizing\ngas tank searches and providing in the statute that after\nthe search shall be conducted, the -- there will be two\npeople on hand, one, Mr. Goodwrench, and one Mr. Value\nAppraiser, and they would have to give a good certificate,\nboth of them have to give a certificate that the value of\nthe car has not been impaired by what has been happened, and\nif it has, the amount of value will be reimbursed\nimmediately by the Government to the owner. Would that be a\nconstitutional statute?\nMR. HUBACHEK: Well, I think that, you know, since\nultimately we're talking about reasonableness, that would\naddress some of the objections that I've made today, but I\nstill think -\nQUESTION: Would it -- would it cure enough of them\nto be constitutional is the question?\nMR. HUBACHEK: I don't -- I don't think that it\nwould, because I still think that that's beyond what the\nFirst Congress envisioned and that's a -- our best guide to\nwhat the Fourth Amendment was intended to mean. They didn't\nauthorize the disassembly of the ships that were coming into\nport. They didn't say that, you know, if you took two ship\nbuilders on board. What they said was, you can take apart\nthe packages, things that are intended to be opened, but you\nhave to have two witnesses, and if it turns out that there's\nnothing in there, you have to -- the customs officer would\nhave to pay -\nQUESTION: My hypo gave you your two witnesses.\nMR. HUBACHEK: I -- I understand, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: If 85 percent of the people with the gas\ntanks that were searched have the contraband, what you're\nasking us to do is to protect the expectation of the other\n15 percent. I -- I suppose that's the rule, but it -- when\nthe percentages get these high, it -- it seems to me to put\nthe exclusionary rule somewhat into question with reference\nto the border. Suppose it was 95 percent. Do we still have\nto protect the 5 percent of the people? I mean, I guess\nthat's the law.\nMR. HUBACHEK: Well, Justice Kennedy, there's no\nshowing that adopting the rule that we're asking for would\nhave any effect on the effect -- effectiveness of the border\nsearches. There's no evidence offered below that, you know,\nthe -- if you deprive them of the ability to do random\nsearches that there will be even one more person who would\nget through. So I think that if they -\nQUESTION: Well, that works the other way around as\nwell.\nMR. HUBACHEK: Well, that's true, but it would\nstill vest the absolute discretion across the border for any\ncustoms inspector for no reason at all to disassemble\nvaluable property. That's inconsistent with the history of\nthe Fourth Amendment, it's inconsistent with the Nation's\nearliest statutes, it's even inconsistent with section 1461,\nwhich applies directly to entries from contiguous countries,\nand that -\nQUESTION: Well, for -- for no reason at all they\ncan -- they can conduct searches of -- of the person, right,\nwithout any suspicion? That's okay.\nMR. HUBACHEK: That's correct.\nQUESTION: The Gucci shoes and everything else.\nBut somehow when you -- when you reach this -- this magical,\nwhat, disassembly of a vehicle, that that has some special\nconstitutional status. I -- I find that quite implausible.\nMR. HUBACHEK: Well, Justice Scalia, I think that\nthe importance is, is that it is very -- we're asking for a\nstandard that's -- comports with what was adopted in 1789\nand 1790, and the 1461 statute that's currently applicable\ntalks about allowing the customs inspectors to look inside\nthe vehicle by providing a key, not by providing a lift or\nproviding tools, but by providing a key. That's what's\nreasonable, that's what's routine, that's what's should be\nprotected by the Fourth Amendment.\nQUESTION: Do you -- do you question the -- the\nGovernment gave an example, I think from fiscal year 2003.\nThey said 300 fuel tanks were disassembled and put back\nalong the southern border without incident, that is, no\nexplosion and no malfunction in the vehicles for the\ntravels.\nMR. HUBACHEK: I don't have any additional\ninformation about those. I mean, I don't know if that\nviolated those individuals' leases, whether they felt a lack\nof security as was discussed in the Molina-Tarazon case,\nwhether their warranties were any way affected, they simply\ndon't have any information.\nQUESTION: But it would be a graver concern than a\nwarranty if the vehicle might blow up after. And -- but\nthere doesn't seem to be any evidence of that, that there's\na high risk that that would occur.\nMR. HUBACHEK: Well, there's no risk -- apparently\nthere's no evidence of anything blowing up, but that doesn't\nmean that individuals' security was implicated as they drove\naway from the border knowing that their valuable property\nhad been altered by unknown government functionaries.\nIf the Court has no further questions, I'll\nsubmit.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Hubachek. Ms. Blatt, you\nhave three minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF LISA S. BLATT\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMS. BLATT: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Justice\nKennedy, you asked about the 25 percent figure, and in the\nappendix to the petition at 12a, that 25 percent figure\nrelates to vehicle drug seizures, so what customs meant by\nseizures was from the vehicle. That wouldn't include stuff\nfound in someone's pockets.\nJustice Breyer, you asked about how we track\nsearches. There's apparently a nationwide computer tracking\nsystem where customs tracks all of their searches, both\npositive and negative, and when there's a positive report\nsearch, it's called a seizure. When there's a negative,\nit's called an incident report, and the agent is in fact\nrequired to document what his reasons were -- were for\nconducting the search, and the supervisor must read that,\nand if there was a problem developing about improper use of\nhis resources at the border, the agent would be either\ntrained or disciplined.\nQUESTION: Are those public documents?\nMS. BLATT: I would doubt it. I don't know,\nJustice Kennedy, but given that it includes the reasons for\nconducting the search, but I -- I just don't know. I know\nit's called the TECS, but I don't know whether that's public\nor not.\nQUESTION: Is it public that such a thing exists?\nIs there -\nMS. BLATT: I've just made it public.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: But -- but -- I mean besides your word\nfor it. I trust you implicitly, but I'd like to be able to\ncite something other than you.\n(Laughter.)\nMS. BLATT: I -- I'd have to go -\nQUESTION: Okay.\nMS. BLATT: -- on the Internet or something like\nthat, Justice Scalia.\nQUESTION: I don't want to cut you off if you had\nsomething else to say.\nMS. BLATT: No, that was --\nQUESTION: I just want -- I do think it's correct\nthough, is it not, that what really we're asked to decide is\nwhether you have the power to make random searches? I know\nthat they're costly and unlikely, but I think it -- it's --\nit's not unlikely in today's world that you might decide you\nwant to search every one-hundredth vehicle or ever twenty-\nfifth vehicle to let the world know that even if they hire\nRonald Coleman they might get searched. That is correct,\nisn't it?\nMS. BLATT: That's correct, Justice Stevens, and\nit's quite conceivable if the country ever went on a red\nalert that the commissioner of customs might say, or if\nthere was some vague intelligence about smuggling in pick-up\ntrucks, they might want to do very extensive searches of\npick-up trucks. Now whether they'll actually ever come to\nthat I hope not, but yet, this -- the -- the border power -\nthe power to conduct a border search is one without any\nparticularized suspicion.\nThank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Ms. Blatt.\n"
