WAXMAN: Justice Stevens, and may it please\nthe Court:\nIn Hernandez v. New York, this Court explained\nthat there are exceptional cases in which the totality of\nevidence surrounding jury selection is so strong that a\nfinding of no discrimination is simply too incredible to\nbe accepted by this Court. This is that exceptional case,\na case in which even on collateral review, the sheer\nweight of the mutually reinforcing evidence renders\nobjectively unreasonable the State court's conclusion that\nrace did not motivate even one of the prosecution's\nperemptory strikes.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Do we have to find that the\nstrike of at least one African American prospective juror\nwas race-based for you to prevail?\nMR. WAXMAN: I believe so. You have to find,\nJustice O'Connor, that race was the but-for factor or the\ntipping factor, not the only factor, but the but-for\nfactor for at least one to come within the four corners of\nBatson.\nNow, I could argue I think, if I needed to in\nthis case, that the jury shuffle evidence alone, which is\nan unexplained, blatantly race-based means of racially\nexcluding jurors from the venire, comes within Batson, the\nBatson proscription itself, or I could argue that case\ntoo.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Were there any -- were there\nany State decisions, or Federal court decisions for that\nmatter, justifying the shuffle on the grounds of -- I\ndon't know -- professional class versus working class or\nsomething like that?\nMR. WAXMAN: The State has in its brief in this\ncase, on this trip to the Court -- the State has cited the\nCourt to one other case in which the Court of Criminal\nAppeals acknowledged the State's justification in that\ncase, that it shuffled because there was a member of the\nprobation office in the front row that they didn't want to\nembarrass and that jurors in the front had tended more to\nhave ties than jurors in the back. That is -- that was\nnever claimed in this case. We have, from the very --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Were there -- were there any\nState court cases said that -- or even in that case you're\nreferring to -- that the shuffle usually is race-based?\nMR. WAXMAN: You know, I can't -- the case is\ncalled Ladd v. State. There is -- there's some -- now\nsome reasonably substantial Law Review commentary in the\nState of Texas. I cited the Court to -- to one in the\nHouston Law Review or the Houston Bar Review when I was\nhere last time, and there has since been one in the St.\nMary's Law Review that says this is a procedure that is\nused to discriminate on the basis of visual preference.\nAnd what's particularly interesting about it in\nthis case is there was a contemporaneous objection in week\n2 and week 3 and week 4 that the State was doing this\nbased on race, and the State offered no defense at the\ntime. It offered no defense in the subsequent Batson\nhearing. It had no explanation before the magistrate, the\ndistrict judge, the Fifth Circuit, in this Court or below,\nand now in this Court this time it says, well, there's\nthis other case in which the reason given was that we\ndidn't want to embarrass the probation officer and we\ndidn't -- and we had people who had ties in the front row.\nThere is no evidence whatsoever in the record that would\njustify those excuses here.\nAnd the evidence in the -- the only evidence in\nthe record that seems to me compels the conclusion that\nthis was done for the deliberate purpose of minimizing the\nnumber of African Americans on the jury. And it was done\nby prosecutors, each of whom -- there were two prosecutors\nin this case, each of whom was found to have violated\nBatson in criminal -- other criminal trials\ncontemporaneous with this one. And --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And the -- and the Fifth\nCircuit's answer to the jury shuffle was, well, the\ndefense shuffled more times, as I --\nMR. WAXMAN: The Fifth --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- as I recall.\nMR. WAXMAN: The -- the Fifth Circuit said that\nwe -- that they shuffled twice and we shuffled five times.\nNow, that is both factually wrong and legally irrelevant.\nThey shuffled three times and they tried to shuffle a four\ntimes -- a fourth time because, the Court will perhaps\nrecall -- this was discussed in the Court's last opinion\n-- because they waived in the fourth week. The defense\nshuffled -- the defense then shuffled and they tried to\ncome in and back -- back and shuffle again when a number\nof African Americans were advanced in the order.\nThere -- under this Court's Batson\njurisprudence, the proscription against using peremptory\nstrikes for a racial purpose or a gender-based purpose is\nproscribed to the defense, as well as the prosecution, but\nthere -- the one doesn't excuse the other, and there has\nnever been a claim, nor is there a factual predicate laid\nin this case for a claim, that Mr. Miller-El's trial\nlawyers were doing the same. Even if it were true, it\nwould not justify what they did.\nNow --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: If -- if we find or if there\nis a finding that the -- that the attempted shuffle on\nthis fifth try was race-based, does that win your case,\neven though the shuffle didn't take place?\nMR. WAXMAN: Well, it was the --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I mean, does it show the\nnecessary animus so that it carries through the whole\ncase?\nMR. WAXMAN: I think, if I needed to -- I mean,\nwe -- we've argued that the shuffle, just like the race\ncoding of the cards in the pre-Batson era, the disparate\nquestioning on minimum punishment and the graphic script,\nall reinforce what we think the record shows with respect\nto each of the six peremptory strikes that we challenge\nBut if we didn't have that, Justice Kennedy, I\nwould be here arguing that if I could show a single strike\nthat was made for the purpose of eliminating African\nAmericans from being considered for jury service, that\nthat ought to come within this Court's proscription of\nBatson. Now, we haven't made that freestanding claim\nbecause I don't think we need that freestanding claim.\nThe jury shuffle is a practice that exists only\nin the State of Texas and, to my understanding, has ever\nexisted only in the State of Texas. So it's a -- it's a\nvery peculiar phenomenon, but I think I could make the\nargument that, look, even if there weren't any of these\nsix -- let's say they shuffled it so successfully that no\nAfrican Americans came up. There simply were no African\nAmericans out of the 108 who were questioned. It seems to\nme that that in and of itself would violate at least a\ngenerous reading of Batson.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Waxman, we really have to\nexamine your -- you know, your allegations, I suppose, one\nat a time. It makes it a very complicated case.\nThe -- the State's response to -- to your\nargument that two of -- of the State's attorneys involved\nin this case had been found to have made racially based\nstrikes in the past -- the State's response to that is\nthat that was not part of the evidence presented in State\ncourt, and therefore, it -- it is not a proper\nconsideration in reviewing the State court decision. What\n-- what is your response to that?\nMR. WAXMAN: I think that's wrong. I think it's\nwrong, first of all, because those two cases had been\ndecided by the Court of Criminal Appeals at the time it\nconsidered the Batson claim in this case.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Was it brought to the attention\nof the court?\nMR. WAXMAN: I -- I am not sure. I don't have\nthe -- neither the transcript nor the briefs are available\nfor that argument. But it's -- the court -- they are\njudicial decisions of that court. The Court can take\njudicial notice of them and they are evidence.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, my. You mean anything out\nthere that -- that a court could take judicial notice of\ncan be -- can be charged to the court? My goodness, no.\nI think it was the burden of the -- of the defendant\nchallenging the -- the strikes to bring -- bring that to\nthe attention of the court. My goodness.\nMR. WAXMAN: Even -- I understand your argument.\nI can't tell you for sure -- and I don't believe anybody\ncan -- whether those cases were or weren't argued before\nthe Texas Court of Criminal Appeals because my\nunderstanding is -- I don't -- I have not seen the briefs\nthat were filed in the Batson appeal, and I don't have the\ntranscript of the argument.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Were -- were both of the cases\ncases of the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals?\nMR. WAXMAN: Yes, yes.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Decided by the court -- the\nTexas Court of Criminal Appeals.\nMR. WAXMAN: Yes. The -- the very same court.\nAnd in any event --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, now, Nelson -- there's\nMacaluso?\nMR. WAXMAN: Macaluso.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Macaluso and Nelson. Nelson\nwasn't involved in the jury selection in this case, was\nhe? He came in --\nMR. WAXMAN: He certainly was.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I thought he came in after --\nafter the jury had been selected.\nMR. WAXMAN: No. That was Mr. Kinne had the\nchickenpox, so the jury was -- the -- the voir dire took\nplace. Mr. Macaluso and Mr. Nelson alternated the voir\ndire examination in the case, and those were the two\nprosecutors, Mr. Macaluso in the other Miller-El -- in the\nChambers case and Mr. Nelson in Mrs. Miller-El's case.\nAnd interestingly, what the Texas Court of\nCriminal Appeals said with respect to Mr. Macaluso in the\nChambers case is not only that he removed five out of five\nAfrican Americans for reasons that violate Batson, but the\nTexas Court of Criminal Appeals also noted that he was\nusing the same minimum punishment ploy that he used in\nthis case in order to disqualify African American jurors.\nHe -- the court actually goes and says, you know, with\nthree of these people, the State tried to disqualify them\nby asking them an open-ended question about what they\nthought the minimum punishment should be even though\nthat's usually what the defense is concerned about.\nPrecisely what happened in this case.\nNow, I'm not suggesting, Justice Scalia, that\nour case depends upon the -- this 404(b) evidence or not,\nand I think it's quite --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, that's the problem.\nWe've got to go through each one of them one by one.\nMR. WAXMAN: Well, I --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And -- and I'm -- you know, I\ndon't remember the names of people involved in -- in prior\ncases in this Court. I -- I -- you know, if we said --\nMR. WAXMAN: Justice --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- you had this same officer\nbefore you, my goodness, I -- I wouldn't remember it.\nMR. WAXMAN: Justice Scalia, a -- first of all,\nthese -- each of these cases was tried within months of\nMr. Miller-El's case, and a finding by a -- the State's\nhighest court that a prosecutor has engaged in\nintentional, deliberate, race discrimination in the\nselection of a jury I respectfully submit -- I certainly\nhope is not the kind of everyday finding that is easily\nforgotten.\nBut in any event, you -- yes. You have to go\nthrough all of the evidence in the case, and what the\nevidence in the case shows is that, first of all, as this\nCourt observed the last time it was here, the State's\nproper race-neutral rationales for striking African\nAmerican jurors pertains just as well to white jurors who\nwere not challenged and who did serve.\nIt's -- you also have to look at the race-coding\nof the cards, race-coding that was done by prosecutors\nwhom this Court observed last time were trained in an\noffice culture suffused with bias against African\nAmericans in jury selection.\nAnd you also have to look at, with respect, the\nremarkable disparity in the way in which African American\nand white venire members were questioned, both with\nrespect to minimum punishment --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I --\nMR. WAXMAN: -- and with respect to the graphic\nscript.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask on the minimum\npunishment ploy? Did that ever work in this case or did\nany of -- of the trial judges ever grant a -- a challenge\nfor cause on the basis of the use of the minimum\npunishment ploy?\nMR. WAXMAN: Well, I can't speak to other cases.\nBut what's truly remarkable about this case -- I\nmean, there are many things that are truly remarkable\nabout this case -- the State not only used this minimum\npunishment ploy with 90 -- 7 out of 8 of the African\nAmericans, as opposed to only 2 out of 36 of the whites,\nbut it actually tried to remove 2 of the African Americans\nin this case: Rand and Kennedy. It submitted them for\ncause based on their answers to those questions. And then\ninterestingly, when that was denied and the State had to\njustify its -- to provide its race-neutral reasons for\nstriking them, it didn't even mention it.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Their response --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But you -- you haven't really\nanswered my question yet.\nMR. WAXMAN: Oh, I'm sorry.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Does any -- did any Texas\ntrial judge, to your knowledge, ever fall for this ploy,\never grant him a -- a challenge for cause based on answers\nto the minimum punishment harangue?\nMR. WAXMAN: I -- I would defer to Ms. Bunn\nabout that because I don't know about other cases, but --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I didn't see any in this case.\nMR. WAXMAN: Well, what happened in this case\nwas there was an effort to rehabilitate. The trial judge\nactually became quite energetic in trying to explain to\nthe juror that, well, it's 5 years and you're not saying\nthat you couldn't possibly consider 5 years. But -- and\nthat was true with respect to white jurors as well as\nAfrican American jurors.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The respondent's reply to this\n-- this minimal punishment argument is that in fact the --\nthe two white prospective jurors who had -- who had\nexpressed antagonism towards the death penalty were\nsubjected to the same questioning, and that the seven out\nof eight black prospective jurors were seven who had\nexpressed antagonism to the death penalty. Now, is that\nnot true?\nMR. WAXMAN: I think that if I -- I believe that\nwith respect to minimum punishment, as opposed to the\ngraphic script, what the State is saying is last time we\nsaid there were 10 whites and 10 blacks who expressed\nhesitation. And this Court observed that, well, yes, but\nonly two of the whites got it. Now, they filed a brief\nthat says, well, the other eight were all either struck\nfor cause or by consent. Now, that's -- that fails for at\nleast two reasons.\nOne, they identified 10. In this Court and\nbelow, we identified 19 jurors who absolutely expressed\nhesitation about the death penalty, and they have still\nnot accounted for them. Number one.\nNumber two, with respect to the eight who they\nhave accounted for in their brief, the fact that at the\nvery end of voir dire, they were struck for cause, or\nthere was an agreement at the end of voir dire to remove\nthem hardly provides a reason not to give the minimum\npunishment ploy to jurors who fit the categorization that\nthe State has described.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, we have to go through\neach one of them and see if the degree of hostility\nexpressed by the white jurors was the same as the degree\nof hostility expressed by the black jurors. And in fact,\nthe degree of hostility by the black jurors was quite\nhigh.\nMR. WAXMAN: Well --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: One said I really don't believe\nin it. I support it only in extreme cases, such as those\ninvolving mass killings or mutilation. And another one --\nanother one said, well, right now maybe I do, but who\nknows later?\nMR. WAXMAN: I --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Now, if -- if there happens to\nbe a different attitude towards the death penalty among\nthe black jurors than there is among the white jurors, you\ncannot fault the -- the attorneys for -- for striking more\nof the black jurors.\nMR. WAXMAN: Justice Scalia, in the context of\nall of this other evidence, which is the context in which\nyou need to weigh it and determine whether we have\nsatisfied the stringent standard for review that applies,\nI respectfully submit that if you go through the -- the\nvoir dire questioning of Mr. Fields and Mr. Warren and Mr.\nRand and the others that we've mentioned, and compare it,\neven leaving aside all of the other evidence,\ncontemporaneous evidence, of race discrimination in the\njury selection in this case, I think you will have to come\nto the conclusion that race was a but-for factor in these\ncases.\nIn Mr. Fields -- we've -- we've mentioned him in\nour -- we've described him at length in our brief. This\nis a man whom -- I mean, forget the -- the State on its\nquestionnaire at the time, on page 14 of the joint\nlodging, wrote, quote, no reservations against the death\npenalty.\nMr. Rand, who we've compared and -- and your\nconcurring opinion, Justice Scalia, the last time it was\nhere said, well, yes, Rand and Mazza are very close, but\nit's a high burden you have to -- you have to overcome\nhere. It's a burden we can overcome here not only because\nof all of this other evidence, but because of what the\nState wrote on the questionnaire when Mr. Rand was being\nexamined, page 30 of the joint lodging. This is the\nState's notes, Quote: \"could be enforced depending on the\ncircumstances -- Murder/robbery, type of offense -- Think\nproper for death penalty -- Yes, I can serve.\" This is a --\nthis is a venireman who said that if he were Governor, he\nwould set the minimum punishment for murder at 99 years.\nMr. Fields was --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, now, wait. He also said\n-- when asked whether he could vote to impose the death\npenalty, he said, right now I say I can, but tomorrow I\nmight not.\nMR. WAXMAN: He said --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Do you think that's a strong --\nMR. WAXMAN: I'm -- I'm not sure whether that's\nRand or Warren, but I'm saying that if you compare Mr.\nRand who thought that the death penalty might be\napplicable for all murder, who repeatedly -- in our reply\nbrief, we include the -- the recitation -- repeatedly said\nover and over and over and over again that he would answer\nthe three questions yes, depending on the evidence,\nwithout any regard for his view about the death penalty,\nwho testified that -- I'm not saying that this is somebody\nwhom, if this were a case in which there was nothing in\nthis -- we were just before this Court saying there's Rand\nand Mazza or there's Rand and Hearn and that's enough to\nsatisfy our burden, I would be up here arguing it but it\nwould be a much more difficult argument. Here, those --\nthat comparison has to be taken in the context of not one,\nnot two, but six jurors who are similarly situated who\nwere treated to this questioning by people who engaged in\nracially disparate shuffling, racially disparate\nquestioning --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, that's the question.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: We have to deal with each of\nthe six one by one, and -- and they have arguments with\nrespect to each of them. I don't care what Rand said.\nThose things that you said sounded very good. But if he\nfinishes it off by saying, right now I say that, but\ntomorrow I might not --\nMR. WAXMAN: Well, I --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- that doesn't strike me --\nand that -- that's what respondent says Rand said, not --\nnot one of the other ones. And you have to go down each\nof the other six, and they have a response for each one.\nMR. WAXMAN: And if this --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, and -- and, you know, a\nbuckshot attack on it has to be examined pellet by pellet.\nMR. WAXMAN: Justice -- let me -- let me switch\nyour metaphor a little. The problem with the State's\napproach to this case -- and it was the problem that -- of\nthe Fifth Circuit's analysis -- is it is pointillistic.\nIt is an analysis. It's like walking up close to a Seurat\npainting and looking at each dot and saying, well, it's\nred, but that might not necessarily be the handbag. Yes,\nyou have -- I mean, he had to paint with the dots, but as\na reviewing court, you need to step back and look at this\nand ask yourself, with respect to, for example, Mr.\nFields, who said not only would he have no hesitation\nabout putting the death penalty in place, but he actually\ntestified that he thought that in capital cases, the State\nwas God's embodiment on earth.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose that you have 10 white\njurors and 10 black jurors. The 10 black jurors are all\nquestioned much more extensively by the State, and in each\nof those cases, there is a plausible reason for excusing.\nA relative was -- served time and so forth. Violation?\nMR. WAXMAN: All in and of itself? I would say\ndefinitely not. I -- I mean --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So -- so then you admit that\nyou have to go one by one. I had thought you would --\nwould have said that if the black jurors are questioned in\na different way and more intensively, that alone suffices\neven though the questioning in each case disclosed the\nbasis, plausible, non-racial basis --\nMR. WAXMAN: No, I would give --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- for excusing them.\nMR. WAXMAN: I would give you a different\nanswer, Justice Kennedy, if it's the jury shuffle because\nthere's no plausible explanation available on the evidence\nin this case. If there is a plausible explanation for\ndisparate questioning, which there is not in the\nstatistics in this case, I wouldn't be arguing that that\nin and of itself, leaving aside individual, you know,\nside-by-side juror comparisons, would suffice.\nBut here, we have, in addition to the disparate\nquestioning that is not susceptible to a race-neutral\nexplanation -- we have things like the prosecutor's own\nnotations in the -- in the questionnaires.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Waxman, you were dealing\nwith Fields, and the answer in Fields' case that the\nprosecution gives is he had a strong feeling about\nrehabilitation, and so he was -- he thought that everyone\ncould be rehabilitated -- rehabilitated. So that shows he --\nhe wasn't like others who didn't entertain those doubts\nabout rehabilitation.\nMR. WAXMAN: Yes, Justice -- Justice Ginsburg.\nHe -- he expressed an opinion that he thought that people\ncould be rehabilitated, not as strong as those opinions by\njuror -- white Juror Hearn and white Juror Duke who sat.\nBut in Fields' case, he was absolutely unequivocal -- I'm\n-- I'm referring the Court to page 185 of the joint\nappendix -- absolutely unequivocal that the ability or\npropensity for rehabilitation would not affect his\nwillingness to -- to put in the death penalty. I believe\nin the dissenting and concurring opinions in this case\nlast time with respect to Mr. Fields, it was pointed out\nthat he was a supporter of the death penalty who could put\nin the death penalty.\nAnd what's interesting about Fields is if you\nlook at the transcript pages where the prosecutor\njustifies the strike, on page 197 of the joint appendix,\nthe prosecutor says, well, he was -- he -- he -- I -- he\n-- he said something about rehabilitation, and it goes on.\nAnd then two pages later -- they have a discussion about\nsomething -- a discussion about which questionnaires will\nor won't go into evidence. Two pages later, Mr. Nelson\ncomes in and says, oh, yes, and he also had a brother who\nhad had some involvement with law enforcement. Well, to\nsay that that's an afterthought is really saying\nsomething. He wasn't questioned about it, as -- as\nneither were -- by the State, as neither were any of the\nfour white jurors who sat who had family members who had\nbeen arrested or prosecuted. They didn't even ask these\nquestions.\nMay I reserve the balance of my --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Was there any evidence that\nthe jury cards in this -- in the actual trial were marked\nor noted on the basis of race?\nMR. WAXMAN: Oh, absolutely.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Where do we find that\nevidence?\nMR. WAXMAN: The -- the juror cards are in the\njoint lodging beginning on page 82, and every single card\nlists the gender and race, even the cards as to jurors\nthat they never questioned. So we know that these were\nnotations that were placed on the cards by the prosecutors\nat the time the venires were called.\nAnd the interesting thing about these is it's\nnot just race and gender, it's were they fat, did they\nhave a beard, did they have a mustache. If you map up\nwhat's noted on these cards with the Sparling training\nmanual that said don't take minorities, don't take Jews,\ndon't take women, don't take fat people -- people who have\nmustaches and beards don't make good jurors. It's --\nthese prosecutors were not only trained by that manual,\nthey learned their lesson very well.\nMay --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: All of those things are okay,\nright, except the race one.\nMR. WAXMAN: Well, I --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, maybe their right about\nbeards and mustaches.\nMR. WAXMAN: We know that --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't know. If they're\nright, good for them. Right? You -- you -- they ought to\nstrike them.\nMR. WAXMAN: I -- we're not here -- if this were\ngender or race, this Court has said that can't be the but-\nfor reason. Mustaches, overweight, you know, go with God.\nMay I -- may I reserve the balance of my time?\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, by all means.\nMR. WAXMAN: Thank you.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Ms. Bunn.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF GENA BUNN\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMS. BUNN: Justice Stevens, and may it please\nthe Court:\nThe big picture. The majority of African\nAmericans summoned for jury duty in this case were either\nopposed to the death penalty generally or unwilling to\nimpose it, while the majority of white jurors had no\nqualms about the death penalty. Striking prospective\njurors based on their case-related views which, after the\nfact, correlate with race is not unconstitutional.\nEssentially, though Miller-El has presented this\ncase as one of disparate treatment, it is actually one of\ndisparate impact. I will discuss first --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Would -- would the statement\nthat you gave -- let's assume there was a -- a working\npremise that blacks were more -- were less inclined to\nimpose the death penalty. Would that alone justify more\nintensive questioning of every black juror?\nMS. BUNN: No, Your Honor, it would not. And\nthe record in this case actually does not support that\nthat -- does not support a proposition that black jurors\nwere questioned differently. Most significantly, the\nminimum -- the questioning on the graphic script. Of the\nsix challenged jurors in this case, only two received the\ngraphic -- graphic script at the outset of their voir\ndire, Carrol Boggess and -- and Wayman Kennedy, both of\nwhom had answered the questions in their juror\nquestionnaire indicating ambiguity regarding their views\non the death penalty regarding their support for the death\npenalty. This fact --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Now -- now, as I understand it,\nthis case was here before. We all read this and we went\nthrough it, and as a result of that, I -- if I read the\nopinion -- not the dissent, but the majority opinion --\nand it might be in my interest if people followed dissents\nmore, but I think the law is we follow the majority\nopinion.\nSo when I read the majority opinion, I read,\nnumber one, there was history in this county, at least 7\nyears earlier though, where they actually had a booklet\nwhich said let's keep all the African Americans out,\nhere's how you do it.\nThen you had jury shuffling, which were two\ninstances. In one of them, there are like 40 people. In\nmy mind, you know, we have rows. In row 1 there are four\nblack jurors and six white; row 2, three black and seven\nwhite; row 3, two black and in the last row one black, and\nthe prosecution says, hey, let's shuffle it. All right?\nAnd the other time he did it, the only other time -- it\nwasn't quite that bad -- the same idea.\nThen the third thing that comes up is you find\ninstances here -- not everyone, absolutely right -- but\ninstances where black people who seemed really for the\ndeath penalty, say, like Mr. Fields manages to get knocked\noff, but Mrs. Mazza who seems quite uncertain is kept on.\nAnd then we have this disparate questioning that\nyou're about to mention where it just turns out that\nalmost every black is given this really -- you know, bring\nthem in a gurney, put -- put -- you know, real graphic\ndescription of the death penalty, and white people who\nalso expressed hesitation aren't. Okay?\nSo on the basis of that, the majority writes\nthere is, indeed, a strong suspicion here that this was\ndiscrimination. So I want to ask you -- and if I were to\nwrite something like that -- I didn't write the words, but\nI would mean, well, I think that's what it is unless\nthere's something later on that comes out to the contrary.\nSo I'm asking you what was to the contrary. What came out\nin this Fifth Circuit that we didn't have in front of us\nthe last time?\nMS. BUNN: Your Honor, the first time before\nthis Court, the issue was whether, based on a threshold\nexamination of the record --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I know that was the issue, but\nI'm saying if I read the opinion to say -- now, maybe\nyou'll tell me I shouldn't. We should just go back and\nredo what we did. But I'm reading the opinion to say,\nwell, unless something changes here, this is bad. It's\ndiscriminatory. Now, you can tell me, one, I'm wrong to\nread the opinion that way. I got that argument. But I\nwant to be sure that that's what's in front of me. So I\nwant to know is there something different in the Fifth\nCircuit that wasn't here the first time.\nMS. BUNN: Your Honor, I believe the most -- the\nmost important difference in the review of this Court the\nlast time and the review of this -- of the Court this time\nis that the Court did take a big-picture look at all of\nthe pieces of evidence, but at this point, as the court of\nappeals did and as this -- as this Court must do now, it\nmust go, as Justice Scalia mentioned, juror by juror, the\njurors who were challenged. Miller-El --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: We only speak to the issues\nbefore us, don't we? And the issue before us last time\nwas not the issue before us here. It was simply whether\nthere was enough evidence to require the issuance of a\nCOA. Isn't that right?\nMS. BUNN: That is correct.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Right. That's why I asked.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And that's a good deal\ndifferent. Whatever the majority might have said about\nother issues, it certainly was not binding on the court of\nappeals, was it?\nMS. BUNN: No, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I hate to say this --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So that must be a different\nquestion --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- to my colleagues, but I'm\nvery much interested in hearing what Ms. Bunn has to say.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- because that wasn't the one\nI asked. The one I wanted answered was the question of I\nunderstand that point, which we could say it was\ndefinitely not definite the last time. I'm asking you --\nit's a serious question -- as whether there was something\nnew or different that came up when the Fifth Circuit wrote\nthis. Now, I gathered from your answer, it might be yes,\nand if the answer is yes, I want you to say what it is\nbecause I'm interested.\nMS. BUNN: Yes, Your Honor, there was additional\nanalysis, particularly of the six jurors Miller-El claims\nwere discriminated against, which this Court did not\nreview the first -- in its first opinion specifically.\nAnd a review of Miller-El's purposeful discrimination\nclaim must focus on these six jurors.\nAnd given the -- the views expressed by these\nsix veniremen, it is no surprise that prosecutors struck\nthem. Each venire member peremptorily struck by the State\nhad voiced views unfavorable to the State but were not\nsubject to a challenge for cause. These reasons are race-\nneutral, case-related, and supported by the record, in\nfact, supported by the very words that the jurors uttered.\nCarrol Boggess indicated that her beliefs -- on\nthe questionnaire indicated her beliefs would impair --\nwould impair her ability to impose the death penalty as a\njuror. She referred to her -- an execution as a murder\nduring her voir dire and other comments evincing hesitance\nregarding her ability to impose the death penalty.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask you this? There are\ntwo questions just generally. One, I'm curious about the\nanswer to my question to -- to Mr. Waxman. Did the\nminimum punishment ploy ever work? Did it ever succeed in\ngetting a challenge for cause granted?\nMS. BUNN: Your Honor, there are other cases\nthat I'm aware of in Texas where the State did challenge\njurors on this basis. Whether there was any questioning\n-- any difference in questioning, I don't know. It's not\napparent from the records.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But have -- and the challenges\nwere granted?\nMS. BUNN: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Of course, none of them were\ngranted in this case. Is that right?\nMS. BUNN: That's correct.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: So it -- it was true that this\nwas -- was a ploy adopted for the purpose of trying to\nmake it unnecessary to use a -- a peremptory challenge.\nMS. BUNN: Yes, Your Honor. Yes, Your Honor,\nthat is right.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And do you defend that\npractice?\nMS. BUNN: Yes, if it is a legitimate tactic,\nrecognized -- as an attorney, if there is a -- some means\nthat is available to use so that you do not have to use a\nperemptory strike --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: If you -- if you can get the\nvenire person to make a mistake in his answer, then you --\nyou get -- get him off easy.\nMS. BUNN: That's what -- that's what voir dire\nis all about, and the defense counsel did it in many\noccasions --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And suppose -- suppose you\nhave a system in which that attempt to find cause is\napplied much more rigorously to black prospective jurors\nthan to white prospective jurors.\nMS. BUNN: If it's not -- the record shows that\nthere's no difference in the views expressed by the\njurors, yes. In this case that --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: No. The -- the white jurors\ndon't express the views at all because they're not\nquestioned intensively, so you don't know if there's cause\nfor them or not. But the black jurors are questioned\nintensively, and you find cause or -- or a -- a race-\nneutral reason for the dismissal. Is there a Batson\nviolation in -- in that instance?\nMS. BUNN: No, Your Honor, not a Batson\nviolation. Now, whether it's evidence of -- of --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So -- so you say that in any\ncase you can question black jurors more intensively than\nwhite jurors and still succeed in excusing them if the\nresult of that voir dire shows some race-neutral basis.\nMS. BUNN: Your Honor, if the questioning itself\nresults in the views that are the basis of the strike,\nthat would present a problem. That is not the case here,\nhowever, where the -- the disparate questioning on minimum\nsentencing, for instance, was based on the views that were\nexpressed.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose -- suppose you have a\nmanual of -- from the district attorney's office that says\nall black jurors shall be questioned more intensively than\nwhite jurors.\nMS. BUNN: That would certainly be evidence that\nblack jurors and white jurors were treated differently.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You're saying that that is not\nwhat happened here.\nMS. BUNN: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It was on the basis of the\nquestionnaires expressing hostility to the death penalty\nthat more intensive questioning was given to some people\nthan to others, and that the mere fact that a larger\nnumber of those people was black is not a violation.\nMS. BUNN: Yes, Your Honor, that is correct.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So the hypothetical, assuming\nthat you -- you just have blacks and whites with no\ndifference in -- in what they -- in what they had said on\nthe questionnaire, is a hypothetical that you say does not\nexist in this case.\nMS. BUNN: Yes.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, but you don't know what\nthe questionnaire showed as to most of the white venire\npersons, do you?\nMS. BUNN: No, we don't, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And how many white venire\npersons were there?\nMS. BUNN: 48.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: 48. And how many were given\nthis questioning? Two?\nMS. BUNN: On the graphic script?\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yes.\nMS. BUNN: Two -- three.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And so are we to assume that\nall 46 of the other white venire persons were as tough on\nthe death penalty as you'd like everybody to be?\nMS. BUNN: No, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: We just don't know about those\nother 46, do we?\nMS. BUNN: We do not know. We do not --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But is it not a reasonable\ninference that some of them might have expressed doubt\nabout the death penalty?\nMS. BUNN: That is -- we do not know. There --\neven though we do not know --\nJUSTICE BREYER: You don't know. If you don't\nknow, you -- there's an excellent way to know. Somebody\nsays, you know, Mr. Prosecutor, you gave this terribly\ngraphic script to all the black people and you really\ndidn't give it to hardly any of the white people. Now,\nit's also possible -- possible -- that the reason he\ndidn't was because from the answer to their\nquestionnaires, which we've not seen, you didn't need to.\nThat's possible. But if that were the case, wouldn't he\nhave said to the judge, Judge, that's why I did it. I\ndidn't ask them because I read the questionnaires.\nWouldn't that be what you would do or any prosecutor would\ndo if that were the reason?\nMS. BUNN: Yes, Your Honor, I would.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And did the prosecutor ever do\nthat here?\nMS. BUNN: No, but significantly in this case,\nthe arguments regarding disparate questioning were never\nraised until Federal habeas corpus proceedings. They were\nnot raised at trial when the jury questionnaires still\nexisted.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Did the prosecutor not -- was\nhe there?\nMS. BUNN: No, Your Honor. He was not --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No. And did -- was anyone\nthere who had ever talked to the prosecutors?\nMS. BUNN: The prosecutors were contacted during\nthat period, but the questionnaires --\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. So could then --\nMS. BUNN: -- no longer existed at that point.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But couldn't you have asked the\nprosecutors if that was the reason?\nMS. BUNN: 20 -- 15 years after a case is\ntried --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I mean, what are we supposed to\ndo? I mean, what you've done is say -- of course, I could\nthink of reasons that could have been their reason, but\nunless there's some reason for thinking that was their\nreason --\nMS. BUNN: Well, Your Honor, in this case, the\n-- the inmate Miller-El has the burden. He had the burden\nin the trial court. He had the burden to prove purposeful\ndiscrimination, and he could have put -- he did put the\nquestionnaires of the 10 challenged jurors in the record.\nHe did not --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, on -- on that point,\nthis is not exactly like McDonnell Douglas, Burdine where\nyou have some prima facie case, the person was equally\nqualified, but was of a different gender than the one that\ngot the job, and then the -- you go back to square one.\nHere, the prima facie case is immensely powerful\nbecause of the culture of discrimination in the manuals\nand so forth, and that -- that, it seems to me, stays in\nthis case.\nMS. BUNN: Your Honor, this evidence, however\ncompelling a picture it draws of past injustice, simply\ncannot trump the State court's finding of no purposeful\ndiscrimination. It does not address --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, don't we at some point\nhave to have some reason to believe that the evidence of\npast practices become irrelevant? And if we -- if that is\nso, do we have any such evidence here?\nMS. BUNN: There -- there was evidence in the\nSwain hearing, and that -- in fact, the cross examination\nby the prosecutors did indicate that practices that were\nin the past had been -- had been vitiated, at least closer\nto the time of trial. But regardless of that --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: These are the same two\nprosecutors who in other cases had been found, in effect,\nguilty of -- of racial discrimination and the same two\nprosecutors who were calling for the shuffle in these\ncases. Is it plausible to think that there had been this\nchange of heart?\nMS. BUNN: Even assuming the evidence, the\nhistorical evidence -- assuming its relevance, as the\nFifth Circuit did --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, I mean, I -- I am\nassuming it is relevant, and I am asking the question, is\nthere a reasonable basis to think that these particular\nindividuals, engaging in the practice that they\ndemonstrably engaged in, had had a change in heart in this\ncase?\nMS. BUNN: Yes, Your Honor. The record in this\ncase indicates that -- for instance, with the use of\ngraphic script questioning, the -- of the six -- again, of\nthe six challenged jurors, four did not receive the\ngraphic script at the outset of voir dire.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Is that why they engaged in the\nshuffle twice --\nMS. BUNN: Your Honor --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- on -- on a record that shows\nthere were black jurors down front each time they engaged\nin it?\nMS. BUNN: The record shows that of 5 weeks of\nvoir dire, the State requested shuffles three times. Two\nof those times, the defense counsel put on the record that\nthere were a greater number of African American jurors in\nthe front of the panel. They --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And -- and that evidence was\nnot refuted. It was not denied, as I understand it.\nMS. BUNN: Your Honor, there was no response\nfrom the prosecutors. There was no objection made, no\nspecific objection made as to -- as to the State's\nexercise of a jury shuffle. But in this case to ask this\n-- what -- what Miller-El is asking this Court is to\nassume that the only discernible trait that could have\nbeen the basis for the State's exercise of a jury shuffle\nis race, and that is not -- that is not the case.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: The -- I -- I don't think\nthat's his argument at all. He is not arguing that there\nmight not be other bases for making challenges or making\nperemptory strikes. What he is saying is those challenges\nexist for lots and lots of jurors. And what in fact there\nis is very strong circumstantial evidence that what tipped\nthe prosecutors to make the peremptory challenges here --\nwhat he was referring to earlier in this argument as the\nbut-for cause was racial. He's not saying nothing else\ncould have been involved. He was saying race tipped it.\nAnd it's the circumstantial evidence, among other things,\nthat indicates that race does.\nAnd that's the reason for my question. Is there\nsome reason to believe that there had been a change of\nheart on the issue of race so that his argument is\nunsound?\nMS. BUNN: Your Honor, again, Miller-El's claim\nof purposeful discrimination must focus on these six\njurors, and in answer to your question, a review of these\nsix jurors does show that these strikes were not based on\nrace. This was not the tipping --\nJUSTICE BREYER: You think they're based, for\nexample, on capital punishment. But now, let me give you\ntwo of them, and this is why -- this is actually why I get\nsomewhat concerned about this.\nHere is the answer of the white woman who served\non the jury about capital punishment. Could you put\nMiller-El to death? Mrs. Mazza: It's difficult. I've\nhad 2 days to think about it, and given my religious\nupbringing, et cetera, going on for a few sentences, I\nthink I could. She serves on the jury. Okay?\nHere's Mr. Fields who is black and whom they got\noff. What I think, according to the Old Testament, people\nwere killed if they violated His law. In its extended\nservice, the State represents Him. I feel the State is\nGod's extended person. In other words, the State\nrepresents God in today's time. Therefore, if the State\nexacts death, that's what it should be. Okay?\nThat's the man they feel has the qualm, and the\nwoman I told you who was white they feel has no qualm.\nNow, I look at that, and I say, you know, I\nmean, my goodness, it's pretty hard to see how you get\nyourself in that frame of mind.\nMS. BUNN: Your Honor, the -- that was not the\nprosecutor's argument at trial and it's -- it is not our\nposition now that --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No. I know. They then said\nthat oh, you see, Mr. Fields was -- is it a woman or a\nman? I'm not sure. Yes, he's a man I think. He -- he's\nkept off, the black man, because of his views on\nrehabilitation. So I looked up what those views were, and\nthat consists of his saying -- my -- my interpretation --\nwell, I think any person, if he really believes in God,\nreally believes in God, could be rehabilitated. At which\npoint the prosecutor says to him, well, suppose you came\nto the conclusion that Miller-El really was touched by\nGod, could you put him to death? Answer: Yes. Why?\nBecause, well, it seems to me my job here is to follow the\nlaw.\nThat's the man whom they think they are -- they\nare kicking off because of his views of possibly not\napplying the death penalty, and the other woman, who is\nwhite, they keep on. Now, I think that's the whole story\nthere. There was also the brother who was a drug -- who\nwas the drug -- you know, he had had drug convictions, but\nthat's scarcely mentioned. So -- so I look at those two\npeople and I think, gee, put that in context. My\ngoodness.\nWhat -- what's your response to that?\nMS. BUNN: Your Honor, as to Juror Billy Jean\nFields, he did not express qualms about the death penalty\nin general, but he did state that it was his belief that\nno one -- no one -- no matter their background or what\nthey've done, is beyond rehabilitation. Everyone can be\nrehabilitated. And this was a view regarding\nrehabilitation that no one, white or black, had expressed.\nIt was a unique view, and in this case where jurors are\nasked to -- to -- the question, is this person going to be\na continuing threat to society, is -- is something that's\ngoing to go into their punishment inquiry. And if this\nperson is one who the prosecutor believed could tend -- if\nthere's a repentant criminal defendant on the stand who\ntestifies, that they would tend to believe that person and\nanswer the question no.\nAnd -- and again, this was not the only basis\nfor the State's strike as well. The fact that his brother\nhad been prosecuted in Dallas County numerous times, the\nsame prosecuting authority, contemporaneous with the\ntrial, numerous occasions, had served time, and contrary\nto Miller-El's assertions, the State did question Mr.\nFields on this issue during voir dire, and it was a basis\nfor the strike. There --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Ms. Bunn, before you finish,\nthere -- there are two pieces of this I hope you can give\nme an answer to. The race-coding. Is there any neutral\nreason for that? And when was that stopped, if it was?\nMS. BUNN: I -- I don't -- I don't have any\ninformation. There's no information on -- in the record\nabout exercising it in other cases, and I just -- I just\ndon't know.\nBut the first part of the question, there could\n-- as Mr. Waxman mentioned, there -- there were other\nvisual cues noted on the cards. Attorneys, especially --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Is it not a fair inference\nthat each of the cues noted on the cards was something\nthat the prosecutors thought relevant to whether or not to\nchallenge the juror? And if so, is it not -- does -- is\nthat not uncontradicted evidence that the race of the\nvenire person was a factor in the decision?\nMS. BUNN: Not necessarily. I mean, there were\nother -- there was other --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, why else would it be\nnoted?\nMS. BUNN: There was -- just to familiarize an\nattorney getting ready for voir dire of an extensive\nnumber of people --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Is -- is there any --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Maybe the prosecutors didn't\nwant to come up with an all-white jury for fear it would\nbe challenged.\nMS. BUNN: That's certainly --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: That may be, but is it not --\nis it not clear that this is one of the factors that was\nused to decide whether or not to exercise a challenge,\njust as the beard and the other things that are mentioned\nin the -- in the manual were?\nMS. BUNN: No, Your Honor. The fact that it was\nnoted on the race -- on the -- on the juror card does --\ndoes not necessarily indicate that. Again, it could be a\ncue for a -- a litigant preparing for voir dire.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, were the -- were the\ncues on the card similar to the instructions in the\nmanual?\nMS. BUNN: There were some that could -- that\nwould correlate, but there were others that aren't noted\non the juror cards --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Can you quantify the\ncorrelation or lack of correlation for me?\nMS. BUNN: The -- for instance, occupations were\n-- or addresses -- perhaps not occupations, but I know\naddresses were -- were noted. There could have been other\nthings at that point that were not noted. There was a lot\n-- information available at that point, whether visual or\nfrom the juror information cards.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I had asked you if they were\nstill race- and gender-coded. You hadn't gotten to that\npart of the question. These cards were race-coded and for\nother things too. Right now in the State, do the\nprosecutors code cards -- cards for race and gender?\nMS. BUNN: I do not know. I do not --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The other question I had, are\nthese two prosecutors the same ones who were involved in\nother cases where it was determined that they had used\ntactics that violated Batson? Were those cases\ncontemporaneous with Miller-El's or were they earlier in\ntime?\nMS. BUNN: The record indicates that Prosecutor\nMacaluso was involved in jury selection in the Chambers\ncase, and that case was tried shortly -- I believe it was\nlate 1985 when Chambers was tried.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Wasn't that 2 months?\nMS. BUNN: 2 months? This was March, so it\nwould have been probably 4 or 5 months, within a year\ncertainly.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Is it -- is it unlawful to take\nsex into account in jury selection?\nMS. BUNN: Yes. Yes, Your Honor, it is. That's\ncertainly not alleged in this case. The jury actually\nconsisted of seven women.\nBut again, to -- the -- the race-coding issue --\nas far as whether it's exercised now, I mean, I wouldn't\nbe particularly surprised if it were. A conscientious\nlitigant -- it's really necessary to keep track of the\nrace of prospective jurors, as Justice Scalia noted, to be\ncertain that you don't run afoul of Batson. But --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Is -- is that true with respect\nto weight and mustaches and things like that?\nMS. BUNN: That -- that doesn't --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: They were -- they were making\nnotations of things like that, as I understand it, and\nthey didn't have to worry about Batson there. But there\ndoes seem to be a correlation with the manual.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And Batson hadn't been decided\nyet.\nMS. BUNN: Yes, that's true. I was referring to\nJustice Ginsburg's question about the -- the practice,\nwhether it continues.\nBut again, regarding its use in this case, I\nwould -- I would say that it -- it's not -- does not\nnecessarily lead to the conclusion that it was noted\nbasically to treat African American venire members\ndifferently because the record actually --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But I -- I don't -- I mean, I'd\njust like to go back to my question. I don't know why\nelse? It's true if -- if all they noted, if they had been\nprescient and had said, you know, Swain is going to give\nway to Batson and we're going to note Batson issues, you'd\nhave an argument. But they were noting a lot of non-\nBatson issues too, and the one common characteristic of\nthe Batson issues and the non-Batson issues were they were\nall correlated to a manual that says keep these people off\nthe jury. And -- and isn't that a sound train of\nreasoning that that's what they were trying to do?\nMS. BUNN: Your Honor, the -- the notations,\nthough, correlate as well to simply visual cues that a\nlitigant will use just simply to familiarize himself with\nthe panel.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: The manual had said there are\ncertain visual cues that indicate jurors you don't want on\nthe jury. You don't want black jurors. You don't want\nwomen jurors. You don't want Jewish jurors. You don't\nwant fat ones. You don't want bearded ones. And these\nare the things that they were noting. Isn't the\nreasonable inference that that's what they were noting\nthem for?\nMS. BUNN: Your Honor, there are other\nexplainable reasons, there are other plausible reasons for\nnoting those things. But even that aside, again, we must\nlook at these six jurors and they all expressed views\nunfavorable to the State. And Miller-El has failed to\nidentify a similarly situated white juror.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What about the Fifth Circuit\nsaid that comparing Rand's testimony -- that that was in\nline with Mazza's. The Fifth Circuit seems to recognize\nthat those two were closely comparable.\nMS. BUNN: Justice Ginsburg, they recognized, as\nJustice Scalia had in his concurring opinion, that that\nwas basically as close as it got. But at most, Mazza\nacknowledged that the decision whether to impose a death\nsentence would be difficult, not an easy one, kind of\nhard, but she simultaneously stated that it was a decision\nthat she believed that she could make. She never\nquestioned her ability to assess a death sentence in an\nappropriate case. She merely acknowledged that it was a\ndecision that she would not take lightly. She also had\nserved on another criminal jury in the last couple of\nyears, a jury which had returned a guilty verdict.\nIn contrast, Rand explicitly questioned his\nability to assess a death sentence in any case. When\nasked whether he could impose the death penalty, he told\nprosecutors right now I say I can, but tomorrow I might\nnot. He declined to describe himself as someone who\nbelieves in the death penalty and can serve as a jury --\njuror and assess the death penalty if warranted, stating\nthat he was probably in between the first two categories\ndescribed by the prosecutor.\nNotably, Mr. Waxman referred to the prosecutors'\nnotes on the questionnaires. What he didn't mention was\nalso noted on the -- by the State at -- at the joint\nlodging, page 30, is that Juror Rand had referred to the\ndeath penalty as a touchy subject and that he had\ndescribed himself as a person falling somewhere in between\nthe two categories described by the prosecutor, the first\nbeing someone who believes in the death penalty and can\nassess it, the second being someone who believes in the\ndeath penalty generally but cannot personally assess it as\na juror. So the State did take note of the -- of the\nexpressions of ambivalence by Rand during his voir dire.\nJuror Mazza, again, never expressed this level\nof ambivalence. These are not similarly situated jurors.\nAnd the same is true of Miller-El's attempted\ncomparison of Rand and -- and Juror Sandra Hearn. She\nexpressed hesitance on assessing the death penalty in a\nvery particular circumstance, the -- a first offense, and\ncertainly this is not the case here. On the other hand,\nRand had questioned his ability to assess a death penalty\nin any case and, against Hearn's State-friendly views, led\nto a defense challenge that was overruled. And the fact\nthat the defense vehemently objected to her on direct\nappeal is further evidence that she's not similarly\nsituated.\nUnder Batson, Miller-El has the ultimate burden\nof proving purposeful discrimination. He has failed to\nsatisfy that burden, and the State trial judge found that\nprosecutors in this case did not act with a discriminatory\npurpose. As this Court acknowledged in its earlier\nopinion, Miller-El is not entitled to habeas relief unless\nhe can -- he can show that the State court's rejection of\nhis Batson claim was objectively unreasonable. He must\nproduce clear and convincing evidence and he has failed to\ndo that.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you, Ms. -- Ms. Bunn.\nMr. Waxman, you have about 3 minutes left.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. WAXMAN: I have just three points.\nThe Fifth Circuit had precisely the same record\nbefore it that this Court had and the State submitted very\nnearly precisely the same brief that it presented to the\nFifth Circuit the time before.\nDisparate questioning on the minimum punishment\nploy was objected to by the defense during the voir dire\nand it was acknowledged. If you look at the Batson\nargument, it's either Mr. Macaluso or Mr. Nelson said some\nof the jurors were questioned disparately, but -- and they\ngave the explanation that it had to do with views on the\ndeath penalty. So it was before the State courts.\nNow, on the graphic script, which is the\ndisparate questioning that Ms. Bunn has focused the\nCourt's attention on, the State now says, okay, we can't\nspeculate about what we don't know about the\nquestionnaires. Let's just look at the questionnaires\nthat we do know about. Justice Stevens, it is -- you are\nquite right that that tells you nothing about the dozens\nof other white jurors whose questionnaires we don't have,\nbut we don't need to indulge in that speculation in this\ncase because what we know from the questionnaire answers\nthat we have is that every black who expressed anything\nthat could be called hesitation on their juror\nquestionnaire, including just not filling in either\nquestion -- answering question 56 or 58, got it. Five\nwhites who expressed hesitation did not. That is Juror\nMazza, Juror Hearn, Juror Duke, Ms. Girard, who testified\nthat she didn't -- who acknowledged in her voir dire that\nshe hadn't filled out one of those questions which got\nsimilarly situated African American jurors the graphic\nscript, and Juror Whaley who -- or Venireman Whaley who\ntestified that her questionnaire expressed great\nhesitation about the death penalty.\nAnd what we also know is that the three jurors\nwho got the graphic script, Troy Woods, the black juror;\nMr. Gutierrez, the Hispanic juror; and Marie Sztybel, the\nonly Jewish juror.\nIf the Court has no further questions.\n"
