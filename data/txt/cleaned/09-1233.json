PHILLIPS\nON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS\nMR. PHILLIPS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nWhat this Court has under review today is an\nextraordinary and unprecedented order issued by a three\njudge district court requiring the release of between\n36,000 and 45,000 inmates, currently incarcerated in the\nCalifornia penal system, within a 2-year period.\nThe order in this particular case is made\nparticularly remarkable because it strikes me that at a\nminimum it is extraordinarily premature. That -- it may\ncome at some point in this process that an order,\nprobably substantially smaller in scope than this one,\nmay become appropriate. But if this is supposed to be\nan order or remedy of last resort, and what the district\ncourt has done here is leapfrogged a series of steps\nthat should have been taken ahead of going this\nparticular route.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: One case, Mr. Phillips,\nis pending for 20 years; is that not so?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Yes, that's correct, Justice\nGinsburg.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So it seems to me -- and\nthere were something like 70 orders from the district\ncourt, the single-judge district court in that case.\nMR. PHILLIPS: That's absolutely true,\nJustice Ginsburg.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And no -- no change. So\nhow much longer do we have to wait? Another 20 years?\nLonger than that?\nMR. PHILLIPS: No, Justice Ginsburg. I\nthink, obviously, the length of time you have to wait in\nsome ways depends on what the state of the remedial\nphase is in the particular case. And in this case and\nin recognition, frankly, of the substantial problems\nthat were inherent in the -- in the penal system as it\nexisted during the 1990s and up until the early 2000s, a\nreceiver was appointed, specifically in the Plata class,\nbut there was also connections between the receiver and\nthe special master even in the Coleman class before the\nthree-judge panel was convened.\nAnd under those circumstances and given the\nextraordinary powers that the receiver had been\naccorded, what should have -- the most logical course,\nif this is supposed to be a remedy of last resort, was\nto allow the receiver an opportunity to implement the\nextraordinary powers that were conferred upon him, and\nthen see -- because if it turns out that we aren't\nmaking progress -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Excuse me. Could you\ntell me -- from your briefs, I just haven't understood\nwhat the alternative steps are. The court below talked\nabout some proposals like construction and said the\nlegislature has struck them down. There's -- the fiscal\ncrisis has gotten worse, so construction is really not\nan option. I don't see how you wait for an option that\ndoesn't exist. They talked about hiring more staff, but\nthe conclusion was that even if you maximize the staff,\nyou don't have the facilities to add more staff, which\nis what you need to cure the constitutional violation.\nSo tell me what specific steps outside of\nthis order should have been given time to be\nimplemented, because the receiver has basically said:\nI've tried, and the small progress we made has been\nreversed because the population just keeps growing, so\nwe can never get ahead of the problem.\nMR. PHILLIPS: The -- the -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So slow down from the\nrhetoric and give me concrete -\nMR. PHILLIPS: Sure.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- details about what\nthe least restricted means would have been, other than\nto say, throw it back to a receiver and special master\nwho are saying we don't have a solution outside\nof reducing overcrowding.\nMR. PHILLIPS: I don't think that's a fair\ncharacterization of what the receiver said. The\nreceiver said that, at any population, he would in fact\nget you to the point -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Oh, counsel, that was\none statement years ago. If that's all you're relying\non -\nMR. PHILLIPS: No, no. That's not all I'm\nrelying on. All I'm suggesting -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That may be your weakest\nargument. Tell me -- give me concrete steps that are\nleast -- less restrictive.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, if you -- all you have\nto do is look at what the receiver has done over the\ncourse of the period of time since his appointment, and\nparticularly when the second receiver was put in place.\nFirst of all, A.B. 900 has been enacted. There is\nsignificant construction. There has been ground broken.\nThere are substantial facilities in place.\nSecond, the receiver has had extraordinary\nsuccess in the hiring process. They are -- we are at\nclose to 90 percent -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Is there in fact less\novercrowding? Because I thought that the -- what this\ncase was all about was the receiver has said, the\nspecial master has said, we can't make any progress at\nall until there are fewer people; we have no place to\nput clinics.\nThe first step, not the last step, but given\nthe -- given what we're dealing with here, the essential\nfirst step is that we have fewer people so there is more\nroom for these health facilities, more room for staff to\noperate.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Justice Ginsburg, the\nfundamental issue in this case seems to me as -- what is\nthe real cause of the constitutional violation here?\nAnd the real cause of the constitutional violation here\nhas always been the culture of disregard for the inmate.\nWhat the receiver was put in place for, the reason he\nwas appointed, and properly so -- this was with the\nState's consent; this is not over our objection -- was\nto change that fundamental culture and to provide, one,\nconstruction, to provide increased numbers, to\nprovide -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, but you can't -- you\ncan't provide construction when the State doesn't supply\nthe money for it.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Except that since the\nAugust 8th, 2008, period of time, you know, literally\nhundreds of millions of dollars have gone to\nconstruction specifically and more than $4 billion have\nbeen spent on the provision of health care in this\nparticular system. And a great deal of that is because\nof the receiver.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Then if you -- then if\nthere -- if there are these great changes in\ncircumstances so that now they -- medical care can be\nadministered in something approaching a decent way, you\ncould go back to the single-judge district court and\nsay: I'm moving under 60(b). Circumstances have\nchanged; it's no longer the case that it's impossible to\nrender decent health care.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Justice Ginsburg, I don't\nthink we could get that relief from the single-judge\ndistrict court, unless you're asking me to actually seek\nto remove the entirety of the claim. I mean, the order\nthat says that we have to get to 137.5 percent of the\ndesign, the design capacity, within 2 years is a\nthree-judge district court decision.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So you go back to that\npanel because it invited you to. It said if\ncircumstances change, come back.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right, but that will always\nbe the case, Justice Sotomayor. The fundamental\nquestion here is: Congress shifted dramatically the\napproach that you're supposed to take as a court of\nequity in this context. This is supposed to be a matter\nof last resort, which would mean that you would give the\nreceiver a full opportunity to do what the receiver -\nJUSTICE BREYER: The receiver said the best\nstatement that seemed to me to summarize it. It's in\nhis brief on page 9. He has about two paragraphs. And\nas you read that two paragraphs, it sounds as if\novercrowding is a big, big cause of this problem, which\nis horrendous, which if you think it's accurately\ndescribed in the mental case in the first page, two\nparagraphs -- now, if that's a fair description from the\nrecord, it's a horrendous problem.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well -\nJUSTICE BREYER: What the receiver says is\novercrowding is a big cause of it. And then he says: I\nthink we've discovered you actually can provide care,\nand certainly our plan and turnaround plan believes we\ncan provide constitutional levels of care no matter what\nthe population is.\nSo then you look to the care and turnaround\nplan and it says spend $8 billion building more\nbuildings. And then the legislature rejected it. Okay?\nMR. PHILLIPS: And then -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Now, there we are. More\ntime; what's supposed to happen?\nMR. PHILLIPS: No, but, Justice Breyer, the\nlegislature also approved a smaller but nevertheless\nmultibillion-dollar construction program.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes, it was 2.31 or\nsomething like that.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, I -- I mean, they\napproved -\nJUSTICE BREYER: And did they approve the\n2.3 -- is that in place, 2.35? Did they approve that?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Yes, they did approve that -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay. So he said: We need\n8 -\nMR. PHILLIPS: -- and that money is being\nspent.\nJUSTICE BREYER: We need 8, and they\napproved 2.35.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right, and the receiver -\nJUSTICE BREYER: And is there any evidence\nhere that suggests that 2.35 is sufficient to cure the\nconstitutional violation?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, I don't know whether it\nwill get you there or not.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So I take it from your\nanswer the answer is no, there is no evidence.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, there is the evidence\nthat the receiver asked for contempt for not getting the\n8 billion and withdrew that motion. So, obviously,\nthere is some sense in which the receiver is reasonably\nsatisfied with 2.35 billion as an opening gambit.\nBut, again, all of this goes to what is, at\nleast from my perspective, the fundamental question the\ncourt should have evaluated in the first instance, which\nis: Are we ready yet to give up hope at this point?\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, what he says -- what\nthe receiver says about the 2.35, that it is a\nsignificant step farther. It is certainly better than\nno construction at all. However, that is not equivalent\nto a conclusion that that current compromise will result\nin sustainable constitutional health care at current\npopulation density levels.\nThat's what he said about it. So -- so we\nhave his views, and I'm back to my question: What else\nis supposed to happen?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, there's -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Which was your question\ninitially.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Justice Breyer, when the\nreceiver says that -- now remember, he says at current\npopulation levels. He doesn't suggest, and his brief is\nvery clear, that it doesn't urge this Court to affirm\nthe particular order in this case.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Mr. Phillips -\nMR. PHILLIPS: Can I -\nJUSTICE ALITO: Yes.\nMR. PHILLIPS: -- just finish this?\nAnd the reality is that the population\nlevels have dropped pretty significantly since August,\nsince the trial in this particular case. And given the\nactions by the legislature in A.B. 18 and the actions of\nthe legislatures in A.B. 900, there are both a lot of\nexpenditures on the table and substantial reductions in\nthe population size. And so, therefore, even under the\nreceiver's -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What -- do we have\ninformation about that substantial reduction? I mean,\nin this record, it just seems to be that it's -- no\nmatter how many efforts have been made, the population\ngoes up. And now you say that the population has gone\ndown. From what point in time and how much has it gone\ndown?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, it's down to around, as\nI understand it, about 147,000 from a high of around 165\nto 170,000, and it has dropped, as we know, because\nthere has been a change in the good time credits. There\nhas been a significant number of transfers. I mean,\nthat was the purpose of the governor's proclamation\ndeclaring an emergency.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So it's possible that\nwithin the 2-year period, you're going to hit the mark\nif you -- that's what the lower court's -\nMR. PHILLIPS: I think it unlikely.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's what the\nthree-judge panel said, which is: If you implement most\nof the proposals being made, you are likely to hit the\nmark. So what you're saying is you're going to do it.\nAnd if you don't, they invited you to come back and -\nyou really don't think that if you hit 140 percentage,\nthat the court is going to order an immediate release of\nthe 2.5 percent over the limit it set? It's going to\nask you: What have you put into place to reach that\nlevel over what additional period of time?\nMR. PHILLIPS: I mean, there's a core sort\nof federalism answer and then a basic sort of factual\npoint to be made here. Let me make the second one\nfirst, and then I want to come back to the -- what you\nmay regard as rhetorical, but nevertheless I think\nimportant, which is that when we made our initial\nproposal to the three-judge court suggesting what we\nthought would be a reasonable reduction within a\nreasonable period of time, it was met with both a motion\nfor contempt and summary rejection out of hand,\nnotwithstanding that there was improvement at the\ntime -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So what are we fighting\nabout? Are we fighting about that the plan was wrong,\nor are we fighting about that you're angry that you were\ntold to do it in 2 years -- in 22 years, as opposed to\ndo it in 25 years? Is that -- is that what you're\nobjecting to?\nMR. PHILLIPS: No. I think the -- no, this\ngoes to the federalism point.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Can -- can you do it in\n5 years?\nMR. PHILLIPS: I don't know. I -- you know,\nif -- if balancing all of the policies that the State\nhas to take into account, can it get there and is that\nin the best interest of the State of California? If it\nis, yes, then we can get there.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, the best interest\nof the State of California, isn't it to deliver adequate\nconstitutional care to the people that it incarcerates?\nThat's a constitutional obligation.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Absolutely. And California\nrecognizes that.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So when are you going to\nget to that? When are you going to avoid the needless\ndeaths that were reported in this record? When are you\ngoing to avoid or get around people sitting in their\nfeces for days in a dazed state? When are you going to\nget to a point where you're going to deliver care that\nis going to be adequate?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But don't be rhetorical.\nMR. PHILLIPS: I'll do my best. Thank you,\nYour Honor.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. PHILLIPS: I mean, first of all, let's\n-- you know, if you look at the receiver's 2009 death\nreview which came out in September 2010, it specifically\nsays that there has been a significant downward trend\nover the past 4 years. The suicides -- the 25 suicides\nin '09 were 66 percent of the average for the preceding\n3 years, and the 9 homicides were 60 percent of the\naverage. There have been significant improvements.\nAnd the more important point in response to\nyour specific question, Justice Sotomayor, is that the\nrecord in this case was cut off in August of 2008, and\nso what we have are -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Of course, but the problem\nI have with that, Mr. Phillips, is that at some point\nthe court has to say: You've been given enough time;\nthe constitutional violation still persists, as the\nState itself acknowledges.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, I'm not sure we've\nstated that.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Overcrowding is the\nprincipal -- overcrowding is the principal cause, as\nexperts have testified, and it's now time for a remedy.\nThe court can't -- has to at some point\nfocus on the remedy, and that's what it did, and that,\nit seemed to me, was a perfectly reasonable decision.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Justice Kennedy, I agree with\neverything you say except -- and I even agree with the\nlast statement, because, you know, you needed a\nsignificant remedy. There's no question about it. But\nyou got a significant remedy when the receiver was\nappointed in 2005 and implemented a program in 2006. I\nmean, our -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: How much time do you think\nthe receiver needed? I mean, how much time did -\nshould the court have given the receiver to develop his\nplan and to try to implement his plan?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, there's no -- Justice\nKagan, there's no specific time frame. I mean,\nobviously, we believe that we are entitled to a\nreasonable opportunity to comply with the receiver's\norders and to bring ourselves ultimately into compliance\nwith the Constitution, and -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, at some point the\nState itself said that if it had, I think, 7 years, it\ncould get down to 137.5 and didn't seem to object to\nthat.\nMR. PHILLIPS: No, that's --\nJustice Kennedy, you know, given all of the other\nconstraints, et cetera -- again, there's a fundamental\ndifference between what you do under the hammer of a\ndistrict court order, which is what we have under these\ncircumstances, and what the State will do. That said,\nthe State is absolutely committed.\nI mean, the -- again, to go back to what is\nthe root cause of the constitutional violation, it's not\novercrowding. I mean, when California violated the\nconstitutional rights of the mentally ill in the 1990s,\nthe prisons weren't crowded. It was because there was a\nfundamental lack of attentiveness to medical care under\nthose circumstances. And that's unfortunate, to be\nsure. More than that.\nBut that was the reason. To go back to your\npoint, Justice Kennedy, that's why the receiver, which\nis an extraordinary remedy. To confer upon a private\nindividual the entire authority to run the California\nDepartment of Corrections, not just simply a facility or\nanything like that, but the entire Department of\nCorrections' medical and -- medical health provision, is\nincredible.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But I thought that\nofficer himself said: I can't do this without as a\nfirst step reducing the population; nothing else is\ngoing to work until we reduce the population to the\npoint where there is room for clinics, room for medical\npersonnel to operate. I mean, that was the view of the\ndistrict judge, the special master in one case, the\nreceiver in the other case.\nEverybody -- they all agreed reducing the\npopulation is not going to cure it, not going to make\neverything perfect, but without doing that as a first\nstep, nothing -- there will be no cure.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, Justice Ginsburg, even\nif you accept that, and I don't think that's precisely\nhow I would interpret what the receiver said under these\ncircumstances anyway, but even if you accept that, the\nidea of a 137-1/2 percent design cap that has to be\nimplemented within fewer than 2 years is a remedy that's\nneither necessary nor sufficient. It is not aimed at\nthe specific class. It doesn't remedy the specific\nFederal rights as required by the Prisoners Litigation\nReform Act.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I don't get the class\nthing, because what -- you can't have a remedy just\nlimited to the class. The class wants to have clinics.\nThey want to have personnel who function someplace\noutside of a broom closet. So you can't deal with this\nproblem by just dealing with the mentally ill and the\npeople with medical problems. You have to provide space\nfor facilities.\nMR. PHILLIPS: I think, Justice Ginsburg,\nthe -- the fundamental point here is that it may\neventually be that you have to get to that stage, but if\nyou look at the receiver's reports since August 2008,\nwhich consistently analyzed this issue, and they say:\nAnd we have been able successfully to bring in very\nqualified personnel, and we have significantly larger\nnumbers; we know there is construction in place; it may\nnot be as substantial as what I originally proposed; it\nis nevertheless very significant.\nAnd -- and Congress was very explicit that\nthe remedy of a prisoner release order should be the\nremedy of last resort.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What would I look at to\nfind this? It's a big record. What I did was I -- it\nrefers to on-line evidence, and I went and looked at the\npictures, and the pictures are pretty horrendous to me.\nAnd I would say page 10 of the religious group's brief,\nfor example, shows you one of them.\nAnd what they're saying is, it's -- it's\nobvious. Just look at it. You cannot have mental\nhealth facilities that will stop people from killing\nthemselves and you cannot have medical facilities that\nwill stop staph and tubercular infection in conditions\nlike this. And then you look at them.\nNow, you've looked at them. I've looked at\nthem. And what is the answer to that? There's nothing\nin here that -- the special master said $8 billion is\nthe answer.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well -\nJUSTICE BREYER: And they haven't come\nclose. So how can I -- or you if you were in my\nposition -- what would you say in an opinion that says\nthat these three judges who have 200 pages of\nfindings -- what would you say to -- as an answer to\nwhat I just said?\nMR. PHILLIPS: I would say that the\nPrisoners Litigation Reform Act has a series of very\nspecific requirements that the Federal court has to\ncomply with, and that in deciding to go to a three-judge\ndistrict court in the first instance, you have to\nexamine the orders that are in place and whether those\norders have had a reasonable time within which to\noperate. And -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes, but the State -- the\nState did not claim that either order in either case has\nsucceeded in achieving a remedy. You've never claimed\nthat.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, it depends on what you\nmean by -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And -- and just if I could\nhave your attention for a moment. I have this problem\nwith the case: Overcrowding is, of course, always the\ncause. If I'm running a hotel -- if I'm looking at a\nhighway system, I need highways, what's the number of\ncars? If the problem is bad service in a hotel, well,\nit's the number of employees per -- per guest. I mean,\nthat's fairly simple.\nNow, I recognize, of course, that Congress\nhas -- had imposed a special duty on us. But I think it\nmeans that overcrowding must not be ordered unless that\nis the only efficacious remedy in -- in a permissible\nperiod of time. And it seems to me there is massive\nexpert testimony to support that proposition on the part\nof -- of the prisoners.\nMR. PHILLIPS: I -- I mean, it seems to me\nthat, first of all, I'm not sure that's consistent with\nthe language. It's the primary cause of the\nconstitutional violation, not the primary impediment to\nthe implementation of a specific remedy. So I think\nthat's still a difficult and open question as to how to\nproceed.\nBut it still strikes me that the sequence\nthat Congress envisions and the one that would make the\nmost sense and ultimately the one that hopefully would\naccommodate both the plaintiffs' interests and the\nState's interests, and the Department of Corrections'\ninterests, is to allow the receiver to stay on a course\nthat candidly I think will in fact get you there.\nI mean, again, one of the real flaws in this\ncase, Justice Kennedy, is nobody doubts for a moment\nthat there have been very significant violations of\nconstitutional rights years gone by and, indeed, a\nfailure on the mental health side ultimately to get you\n-- get to the point where we are in fact providing a\nsignificant remedy.\nThe reality is, is that in the course of the\nlast 3 to 4 years under the guidance of the -- of the\nreceiver, who coordinates with the special master on the\nmental health side and does it with the cooperation of\nthe State of California, there have been significant -\nthere has been significant movement in the right\ndirection.\nAnd if the court had not jumped the gun and\nsaid, look, we're not going to -- we're not going to let\nthat part play itself out, we are going to leap ahead\nand go to a three-judge court and go to the prisons -\nto the prisoner release order, this process would have\nplayed itself out and we wouldn't be here -\nJUSTICE ALITO: All this talk about what the\nreceiver may think can be done seems a little bit\nperplexing to me, because the receiver did not testify\nbefore the three-judge court; isn't that correct?\nMR. PHILLIPS: That -- that is true, Justice\nAlito.\nJUSTICE ALITO: You were not allowed to\nquestion him.\nMR. PHILLIPS: We were not allowed to -\nJUSTICE ALITO: And now he has submitted\nwhat is styled an amicus brief where he doesn't address\nissues of law. He explains his views about -- he tries\nto explain prior statements and supplement those prior\nstatements. Is that proper?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, you know, I'm a\nlong-time believer that amicus briefs are pretty much\nopen season in terms of anything you want to present on\nthem. But I mean, obviously, I -- I -\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, is that true? Can -\nMR. PHILLIPS: Clearly a better system is\none in which we could -\nJUSTICE ALITO: Can a witness testify -- can\na witness submit an amicus brief that consists of an\naffidavit?\nMR. PHILLIPS: No, Your Honor, that's\nobviously not appropriate, and one of the things we've\ncomplained about -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought the -- the -\nthat brief was filed because the -- there were -- in\nyour presentations, there were representations about the\nspecial master, and he filed that brief to say: You\nmust understand this in context; I was making a speech\nat the club.\nSo he wanted to put in context what you had\nused. You had quoted his statements.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, to be sure, although,\ncandidly, we had -- we had referred to some of those\nsame statements even in the jurisdictional statement in\nthis litigation. This has been part of the case for\nquite some time.\nSo I -- I don't know what motivated the\nspecial master to file an out-of-time brief -- or I\nmean, the receiver to file an out-of-time brief. But I\nunderstand -- you know, we didn't object to it so long\nas the Court was of a mind to hear from the receiver.\nBut I do think the most important part of\nthat, though, to keep in mind in this context is the\nreceiver didn't ask for this Court to affirm. The\nreceiver simply clarified certain statements that had\nbeen made and tried to say, as Justice Alito described,\nput them into some kind of context. And that's -- and\nthat's fine, and we obviously don't have any quarrel\nwith -- with that particular presentation.\nBut I do think to say that the receiver has\ninsisted that he cannot get to a constitutionally\npermissible result without the order that has been\nimposed in this particular case is -- is simply not\nconsistent with either the record and certainly not\nconsistent with that amicus brief.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but the experts\ntestified to that effect.\nMR. PHILLIPS: I mean, experts made the -\ncertainly reached that specific conclusion. But this\nCourt has recognized -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And the strike force and\nthe governor's -- governor's commission reached the\nsame conclusion.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: The strike team, I think\nthey called them.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right. But, again, it seems\nto me that there is a very, very, very big difference\nbetween what do you need to accomplish in order to\nremedy whatever -- whatever the constitutional violation\nis, recognizing in the first instance that the biggest\nelement of an Eighth Amendment violation is the\ndeliberate indifference prong, which absolutely seems to\nme to have been completely eliminated by the conduct of\nthe State over the course of the last 3 to 4 years.\nThere is no evidence to support -\nJUSTICE BREYER: What specifically will\nhappen? I mean, at the moment, you know, we could go\nthrough -- we have all these briefs. I mean, there are\nall these experts, all the reports. Everybody is saying\nyou need to spend the money. And we have -- if you\nreally want to cure the constitutional violation, we\nhave the legislature rejecting 8 billion but 2, which -\n2.35, and so -- and nothing, and a void, and give us\nmore time.\nI mean, I read the newspaper. It doesn't\nseem to me California has been voting a lot of money for\nnew programs. The -- the -- what is it -- what is it\nspecifically that would happen that would cure this\nproblem were we to say -- I mean, a big human rights\nproblem -- what would we say -- what would happen if we\nwere to say, no, this panel's wrong? What would happen\nthat would cure the problem?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, it depends I suppose on\nsome ways on how you -\nJUSTICE BREYER: A constitutional problem\nwhich the State itself admits -\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- is constitutional, a\nState with a governor who has said publicly that there's\nthis tremendous safety and health problem in the\nprisons. What -- what would happen?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, if the Court were to\nconclude that the three-judge panel shouldn't have been\nconvened, that would be one outcome. If the Court\nconcludes that it was appropriate to convene it, but\n137-1/2 percent is not narrowly tailored, it would be a\ndifferent one. Either way, it will go back, obviously,\nto a court of equity. The receiver is in place. The\nreceiver has a comprehensive plan in place which he is\nimplementing as we speak.\nI mean, you know, one of the things that -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: That's one piece of it.\nYou said something about the 2.35 million. They didn't\ncome up with the 8 million, but they did come up with\n2.35 billion. And then I'm just looking at this brief\nfor the receiver, and there's a footnote, page 11,\nfootnote 3, that says: No, that money isn't there; it's\ndependent upon several approvals that have not yet been\nsecured, and such approvals ultimately may not be\nforthcoming.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, I mean, 400 million of\nit has already been spent. The rest of it has already\nbeen earmarked for this particular purpose, and there is\n-- and the expectation from the State of California is\nthat money is -- is going forward. Construction is, as\nwe speak, under way. And the one thing we do know is\nthat -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But not the -\nMR. PHILLIPS: -- every time the receiver\nasks for a check he gets one.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Not the 2.35 -\nMR. PHILLIPS: I'm sorry.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I mean, I think you did\nsay earlier that this was a done deal, 2.35 billion.\nBut this is a note telling us it's not so.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, the receiver is saying\nit's not etched in stone. I understand that. But our\nassumption and our expectation and our belief is that\nthat money is going to be used for construction. There\nare projects that are finished, there are projects that\nare under way, and there are project that are scheduled\nto begin within the next 6 weeks, all of which will be\nfunded out of that $2.35 billion.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: On one project, the joint\nlegislative budget committee said, no, we're not going\nto give you money for that.\nMR. PHILLIPS: They asked for additional\ninformation, to be sure. But the expectation, again,\nfrom the governor, both this governor and the\ngovernor-elect, is that that money will ultimately be\napproved and that that facility would be built. And\nwe're moving along very rapidly to get that construction\nunder way, because we're talking about enormous\nfacilities under these particular circumstances, Justice\nGinsburg.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Phillips, my trouble\nlistening to you is that it seems as though you're\nasking us to re-find facts. You know, you have these\njudges who have been involved in these cases since the\nbeginning, for 20 years in the Plata case, who thought:\nWe've done everything we can, the receiver has done\neverything he can; this just isn't going anywhere and it\nwon't go anywhere until we can address this root cause\nof the problem.\nAnd that was the view of the judges who had\nbeen closest to the cases from the beginning and the\nview of the three-judge court generally. So how can we\nreach a result essentially without, you know, re-finding\nthe facts that they've been dealing with for 20 years?\nMR. PHILLIPS: The -- there -- the\nfundamental problem with the fact-finding in this -\nwell, there are actually two fundamental problems.\nFirst of all, remember that the receiver gets appointed,\nand then 3 months later you get a motion for a\nthree-judge court. The three-judge court convenes\nitself before the receiver has even finalized the\ncomprehensive plan to bring everybody into compliance in\nthe first instance.\nSo the reality is that's -- that's the\nfundamental legal error I'm asking this Court to\ncorrect. But even if you get beyond that and you're\nlooking at the primary cause analysis, it seems to me\nthat's -- that's at most -- at best, a mixed question of\nlaw and fact, and it's the kind of standard that this\nCourt ought to analyze to determine in the first\ninstance and on an independent review whether or not the\novercrowding is, quote, \"the primary cause of the\nviolation.\"\nAnd what makes that inquiry particularly\nappropriate for this Court, as opposed to simply\nslavishly adhering -- deferring to the district court in\nthis circumstance, is that the district court\narbitrarily cut off the record in August of '08 and\nthere have been enormous developments since then. And\nthere were enormous developments -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Can you explain me\nsomething about that? It was confusing in the briefs,\nMr. Phillips. I thought that the State had said: We\ndon't want the plaintiffs to tour these facilities\nanymore. We don't want to have discovery go beyond -\nwhat was it -- some date in 2008.\nI thought that it was the State that was\nurging: We don't need any more discovery, we don't want\nany more inspection tours.\nSo how could -- how could the plaintiffs\nsubmit more than they did when the State said it's\nenough, 2008 should be the cutoff?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, there's a huge\ndifference between not allowing formal tours and all of\nthe rigamarole that goes with that, which is what the\nState specifically objected to. But what the State\nwanted to do and what the intervenors on our side in\neven greater vehemence wanted to do was to bring forward\nevidence that proved that in the interim period of time\nthere have been, in fact, significant improvements.\nAs I sit here today, Justice Kennedy, you\nsaid it's conceded that we're -- that we're in\nconstitutional violation. It is conceded that we have\nbeen in constitutional violation. I don't know whether\ntoday we are in violation.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But then don't you have\nthe burden? If -- if you have -- you concede that you\nhave been in constitutional violation, then it seems to\nme you have the burden of showing that's no longer the\ncase. That's generally so in -- in -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, did you -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry. Could\nyou answer Justice Ginsburg's question first?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Yes. Justice Ginsburg, I\nunderstand what the ordinary rule would be in a -- of a\ncourt of equity dealing with a constitutional violation.\nBut we're talking about an order entered under the\nPrisoners Litigation Reform Act, and it's quite clear,\nthe statute couldn't be any plainer, that it shifts the\nburden significantly onto the plaintiff when you are\ngoing to go for a remedy as extreme as insisting that\nsomewhere between potentially 36,000 and 45,000 inmates\nbe released within a -- within a 2-year period of time.\nAgain, if you go back, you know, the\nreceiver has not -- at the time that all of this took\nplace, the receiver had been appointed. The receiver\nhad devised a plan. The receiver is currently spending\nan enormous amount of money, $4 billion on health care,\nto get -- to get the system moving in the right\ndirection, with the right attitude, in order to bring\nourselves without question into constitutional\ncompliance. The truth is we haven't really had an\nassessment of where we are in the constitutional\ncompliance spectrum.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, maybe -- you're\ntalking about one of the cases, but the other one -- and\nit's the newer one, instituted in 2001. But what about\nthe one that started out in 1990?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Coleman is obviously a\nmuch -- a much more serious problem. I don't doubt\nthat. But it seems -- and if the Court were to conclude\nultimately that Coleman ought to go back for another\nanalysis based on the problems there, I could understand\nthat. And it would be a very different prisoner release\norder under those circumstances because then you'd have\nto take out all of the evidence with respect to Plata\nand let that play out.\nBut even that, it seems to me, would be a\nmistake under these circumstances where the special\nmaster and the receiver have been in a sense joined at\nthe hip in a variety of ways. And it only makes sense,\nbecause the -- the receiver is controlling the provision\nof medical care in the CDCR and the special master is\ntaking care of or trying to promote a very small slice\nof that.\nSo in the scheme of things, as you might\nexpect, the receiver consistently gets the ultimate\nauthority to make the decisions to help provide the kind\nof resources, both in quality and quantity and staff and\nconstruction and access to health care.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, this issue\nabout evidence -- did you proffer to the judge anywhere\nin this record what the additional evidence it was that\nyou wanted to show? I know that the decrease in\nsuicides happened post-trial, so you couldn't have\nproffered that pretrial.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But you run the prisons.\nI presume that you could have yourself without discovery\nset forth a proffer for the court that says: We had a\nwait time between diagnosis and treatment that was\n60 days, 90 days, 120 days in the past, and we've\nreduced that down now to 2 weeks or whatever the reality\nis.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Why don't you -- you\nkeep saying we were blocked.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Because the district court -\nbecause the district court could not have been plainer.\nAnd when the intervenor's counsel stood up in the\nopening statement and said, I want to start talking\nabout the beneficial changes and where the status is\ntoday as opposed to where it was way back when, the\nthree-judge court, or at least one member of the\nthree-judge court said: We have been as clear as we can\nbe that we are not entertaining any evidence on that\npoint.\nSo the notion of coming forward with a\nproffer, while technically it might have been -- is\nclearly a futile act, and we had already annoyed the\njudges on our side by even making reference to it. So I\ndon't think it's an appropriate response to say that we\nshould have put forward more, because the truth is we\nwould have -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Except that the district\ncourt invited you to proffer that evidence that went to\nthe appropriateness of the remedy. So you didn't have\nto proffer it -- it viewed you as saying, we're no\nlonger violating, constitutionally violating the Eighth\nAmendment. Instead, it said: We'll take whatever you\nhave to proffer to show that the remedy is\ninappropriate.\nMR. PHILLIPS: All right. But Justice\nSotomayor, there is, to my mind at least, a complete\ndisconnect by saying, I'm not going to tell you exactly\nwhere the constitutional violation is today, we're not\ngoing to get into that, we're just going to assume\nthere's a constitutional violation; now prove to me that\nthe remedy -- you know, what remedy will or will not\nwork under those circumstances. It seems to me the\nexact opposite is the way to do it. You determine where\nthe constitutional violation is -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: When does -- well, we'll\nget back to Justice Kennedy's -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, I see your\ntime is about to expire.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Specter.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD SPECTER\nON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES\nMR. SPECTER: Thank you. Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nFor 20 years, the overcrowding crisis has\ncaused prisoners suffering from psychosis and\nlife-threatening illnesses to languish in their cells\nbecause treatment facilities have no room for them.\nPrisoners are committing suicide at a rate twice the\nnational average, and more than two-thirds of those\nsuicides are preventable. The absence of -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Are you talking about\ncurrent figures or past? Tell us the date of the\nfigures.\nMR. SPECTER: Sure. That's from the trial\ncourt's opinion, Your Honor. That's from the record.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's what I thought.\nHow do you address your adversary's point -\nMR. SPECTER: Yes, ma'am.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- that the adequacy of\na remedy can't be measured unless you measure the state\nof the situation at the time the remedy is imposed?\nMR. SPECTER: Well, I think, Your Honor,\nthere was massive amounts of evidence about the\nconstitutional violations that existed at the time that\nthe remedy was imposed. And if we -- I can point to the\njurisdictional statement 1 appendix, page 30a, the court\nsaid: \"Nonetheless, as we describe below, fundamental\nunconstitutional deficiencies caused primarily by\novercrowding continue to exist and\" -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: They didn't take any\nevidence on the point, I thought.\nMR. SPECTER: No, Your Honor. I'm sorry,\nthat's not correct, with all respect. They took massive\namounts of evidence up to the day of trial about all the\nconditions as they relate to the remedy. And those\nconditions were -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could you give us the\nrecord -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Current conditions?\nMR. SPECTER: -- current -- current as of\nthe time of the trial.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What was -- what was your\nfriend talking about when he said that they rejected any\neffort to show the current situation?\nMR. SPECTER: Well, my friend and I have a\ndisagreement, but I think Justice Sotomayor accurately\ncaptured it. What the three-judge panel said is: Look,\nwe're not going to -- you can't -- this isn't the place\nfor you to come in and say everything's fine, it's -\neverything's constitutional.\nWhat the three-judge court did say is: We\nwill consider -- and they did, in fact, consider -- all\nthe evidence from the State. They had experts from the\nState, two of the prisons, in August of 2008. Those\nexperts wrote reports, they testified, and they've\ntestified about the conditions current. And one of\nthem from the mental health side said -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: This was in 2008.\nMR. SPECTER: And that was the time of the\ntrial, Your Honor. There were -- the discovery -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: They had a -- they had a\ncutoff date of some 2 months before the trial -\nMR. SPECTER: In August, and the trial\nstarted in November.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And that was a -- and -\nbut before that point, the experts that were -- had\ntestified were aware of the conditions that existed.\nMR. SPECTER: Exactly, Your Honor. And -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And when was the remedy\nimposed?\nMR. SPECTER: The remedy -- well, the final\norder came -- well, the close of evidence was in\nDecember of 2008.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That was in the -- in the\none-judge court, in the district court, wasn't it?\nMR. SPECTER: No, no. In the three-judge\ncourt -- the three-judge court closed evidence in\nDecember of 2008. We then argued the case after the\npost-trial briefing in February of 2009. Then the court\ncame out with the tentative decision about 20 days\nlater, and then in August of 2009, it issued the\n183-page opinion and the order that's at issue here.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Did -- I'm sorry.\nLet me just keep track here.\nThe evidence was cut off when in 2008?\nMR. SPECTER: The trial closed in December\nof 2008, after all the parties had submitted all their\nevidence.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: All right. So -\nMR. SPECTER: Then there was post-trial\nbriefing for a month. Then we had argument in\nFebruary of that year. And then a few weeks later, they\nissued a brief summary of their conclusions in an\nattempt to get the State and the parties to settle the\ncase.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You -- you don't\ndispute the statement I have -- it's in the response of\nthe intervenors -- that between October 2006 and October\n2010, the population of the adult facilities declined by\n14,832 inmates?\nMR. SPECTER: Well, I -- I agree with my\nfriend Mr. Phillips that the population has declined by\nabout 10,000 prisoners. Most of that decline has been\ndue to a transfer to out-of-State prisons, and, true,\nthere's some -- some amount of it has been as a result\nof the marginal increase in good time credits, which the\nState elected to pursue on its own.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: What about the argument\nthat there was evidence that should have been admitted\nbut that was not, with reference to new construction?\nMR. SPECTER: Well, I don't -- there was no\nevidence that wasn't -- that was offered that wasn't\nconsidered by the three-judge panel, Your Honor. They\nconsidered all the evidence. Their 183-page opinion is\nscrupulous in considering all the evidence, both that\nsupported the order and they distinguished the evidence\nand, in fact, made credibility determinations based on\nthe evidence that -- that was contrary. But -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel -\nMR. SPECTER: Yes. I'm sorry.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Can you explain what the\nconnection is between the 137.5 percent figure and the\nconstitutional violations relating to the provision of\nmedical care in general and treatment for -- for mental\nillness?\nMy understanding of the 137.5 percent figure\nis that that has to do with the total number of\nprisoners in the -- in the system in relation to design\ncapacity; isn't that right?\nMR. SPECTER: That's correct, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Now, what does the ruling -\nthat doesn't speak to the number of personnel who are\navailable in the system to attend to medical needs or\nmental illness. It doesn't speak to the extent of the\nfacilities that are available for those purposes. It\nseems to be -- there seems to be a disconnect between\nthose two. Could you explain why that is narrowly\ntailored?\nMR. SPECTER: Yes, Your Honor. There was -\nthe court made findings that 137.5 percent was the\nmaximum number of prisoners that -- of the capacity, of\nthe design capacity of the prison, that the prison could\nhave that would enable the State to provide -- to have\nall those things that you just mentioned -- staffing,\nfacilities, medication management -- be effective and\nreach the actual prisoners who are ill, seriously ill.\nJUSTICE ALITO: See, that's what I don't\nunderstand. You can have a -- could you not have a\nprison where the cells are somewhat crowded -- and 137.5\npercent of design capacity is not -\nMR. SPECTER: Right.\nJUSTICE ALITO: -- is not unconstitutional\nin itself, is it?\nMR. SPECTER: No, it remedies -\nJUSTICE ALITO: You could have -\nMR. SPECTER: It's a remedy, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Or you could have a prison\nwhere the -- the cells themselves are crowded, and yet\nthere are other facilities available for medical care\nand plenty of staff to attend to those things. So\nwhat's the connection?\nMR. SPECTER: Well, that's -- that's -- and\nyou're right. If there were -- if the cells were\ncrowded but the prison had all the other facilities\navailable, then there might not be a problem. You have\nto -- well, I hope you can understand that in this case,\nthe prisons were built to double-cell the prisoners, but\nthey weren't built to provide 200 percent of health care\nneeds. So as soon as they started to double-cell these\nprisoners, they could meet their literal housing needs\nin the space of the cell, but they couldn't meet the\nneeds of their health care.\nAnd that's why, Your Honor, the\n137.5 percent figure is reasonable, because the Court\nwent almost a third overcrowding above what all the\nexperts recommended.\nJUSTICE ALITO: But why order the release of\naround 40,000 prisoners, many of whom, perhaps the great\nmajority of whom, are not going to be within a class in\neither of these lawsuits? Why order the release of all\nthose people, rather than ordering the provision of the\nconstruction of facilities for medical care, facilities\nto treat mental illness, hiring of staff to treat mental\nillness? Why not go directly to the problem rather than\naddress what seems to be a different issue altogether?\nMR. SPECTER: Well, I have two responses to\nthat, and they're both a little separate.\nThe first point: It's important to\nunderstand that this is not a release order. It's a\npopulation-crowding reduction order. The court is not\nordering the State to throw open the gates of its doors\nand release people. They can reduce crowding through\nmore transfers to out of State. To your construction\npoint, if the State so chooses, it can construct new\nfacilities to increase the capacity. And the\nthree-judge panel said if you increase the capacity, you\ncan increase the population.\nThe point about -\nJUSTICE ALITO: If all they do is to build\nmore cells, they're not going to address the problem.\nSo I -\nMR. SPECTER: Exactly. So that goes to the\nsecond part of your question, which is: Why don't they\ntry other things, like ordering the prisons to hire more\ndoctors, ordering better medication management, all of\nthose kinds of things? And the answer to that is in the\nappendix to the Appellee's Coleman brief, which lists 70\ndiscrete orders which the Coleman court, single-judge\nColeman court, tried over a period of 15 years, which\nhave proven singularly to be ineffective. And that's\nwhy the court analyzed all those things; the trial court\nanalyzed all these things, and it made a finding of fact\nthat based on the statements by the special master, by\nthe receiver's reports, and by the general state of the\nhorrendous conditions which we have in these prisons,\nthat those discrete orders would not solve the problem.\nAnd given the level of harm -\nJUSTICE ALITO: I -- I still don't get it.\nYou're saying that they were ordered to do a variety of\nthings that directly address the problem and they didn't\ncomply. So as a -\nMR. SPECTER: No.\nJUSTICE ALITO: In order to -- in order to\nprovide some kind of a remedy, we're going to order\nsomething else that doesn't address the problem -\nMR. SPECTER: No, that -\nJUSTICE ALITO: -- that these lawsuits aim\nat addressing.\nMR. SPECTER: No, Your Honor. To the\ncontrary, Justice Alito, we -- I think the court\nbelieves based on the facts that it found that this\nwould be an effective remedy. All of the testimony that\nthey heard from experts from Texas, from Pennsylvania,\nfrom Washington State -- all of whom had suffered, had\ndealt with crowding in their prison systems, have said\nthat when you reduce the crowding, that's the critical\nthing that you have to do now, because unless you reduce\nthe crowding, nothing else is going to work. And the\ncourt found that that was exactly true.\nNothing else over 20 years in one case and\nover 8 years in another case has worked. And -- and\nall -- as Justice Kennedy said, massive amounts of\nevidence show that the primary reason it hasn't worked\nis one singular word, overcrowding; and when you reduce\novercrowding, the prison will be able to operate and\nwill be able to provide those services that it can't\nprovide now, so the doctors will have room to be able to\nwork, which they don't have now.\nThere will be less prisoners, so officers\nwill be able to take them from one place to another to\nget treatment. There won't be so many lockdowns, which\ninhibit care.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel -\nJUSTICE ALITO: That's a very indirect way\nof addressing the problem, and it has collateral\nconsequences. If -- if I were a citizen of California,\nI would be concerned about the release of 40,000\nprisoners. And I don't care what you term it, a prison\nrelease order or whatever the -\nMR. SPECTER: Crowding -\nJUSTICE ALITO: -- terminology you used was.\nIf 40,000 prisoners are going to be released, do you\nreally believe that if you were to come back here 2\nyears after that, you would be able to say they\nhaven't -- they haven't contributed to an increase in\ncrime -\nMR. SPECTER: Well -\nJUSTICE ALITO: -- in the State of\nCalifornia? In the -- in the amicus brief that was\nsubmitted by a number of States, there is an extended\ndiscussion of the effect of one prisoner release order\nwith which I am familiar, and that was in Philadelphia;\nand after a period of time they tallied up what the cost\nof that was, the number of murders, the number of rapes,\nthe number of armed robberies, the number of assaults.\nYou don't -- that's not going to happen in California?\nMR. SPECTER: Your Honor, this trial court\nfound, based on 50 pages of its opinion, based on expert\ntestimony not only from our experts but from the State's\nexperts, from the intervenors' experts, they all came to\nthe unanimous conclusion that there are methods that -\nby which you can reduce crowding which will not increase\ncrime and that are safe.\nThe Secretary of the Department of\nCorrections who was the secretary at the time of trial\nso testified that he was in favor, for example, of\nincreasing prisoners' good time credits. That's one way\nto reduce crowding.\nAnd, moreover, there was statistical\nevidence saying -- looking at all the other States that\nhad reduced their prison population over a period of\nabout 15 years, and they all came to the same\nconclusion, all of those studies came to the same\nconclusion, which is there's no -- there is no increase\nin the crime rate. In -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But that's not what\n-- that is not what the three-judge district court\ndetermined. The Prisoner Litigation Reform Act requires\nthat court to give substantial weight to adverse impact\non public safety.\nMR. SPECTER: Yes. Yes, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And when -- and then\nit said to the State, look, you come up with a plan that\ngets you to 137.5 in 2 years.\nMR. SPECTER: Yes, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The State did -\nMR. SPECTER: Yes, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- and the State did\nnot say -- emphatically did not say this is not going to\nhave an adverse impact on public safety.\nMR. SPECTER: Right, but the -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If you follow the\ndouble negative there. But -- and what the district\ncourt said -- it didn't examine that. It said, well,\nwe're sure the State's not going to do anything that has\nan adverse impact on public safety. I'm looking at page\n4a of the jurisdictional statement.\nMR. SPECTER: Right. I know it.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It said -- and so it\ndid not make those determinations, but the PLRA requires\nit to determine that what it's ordering -- or at least\ngive substantial weight to the public safety issue. So\nisn't that a basis for overturning the remedy that's\nimposed here?\nMR. SPECTER: I would respectfully disagree\nwith that, and I'll tell you why -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I thought you would.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. SPECTER: At least it's respectful.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. SPECTER: I'll tell you why I think\nthat. The court examined all of the methods that are\ncommonly used and that the governor himself has proposed\nto reduce crowding. The governor himself wanted to\nreduce the prison population by 37,000. That was in one\nof his legislative enactments, and the secretary of\ncorrections testified that those proposals were safe.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Did he want to do it\nwithin the 2-year period the district court ordered?\nMR. SPECTER: Yes, Your Honor, he did. He\nsubmitted legislation to the legislature for that, and\nthe legislature wouldn't -- wouldn't take it. And the\ngovernor actually said, reacting to that, after a riot\nat Chino which was partly -- at one of the -- Chino is a\nprison in California -- a riot; he said, and the quote:\n\"And the politicians in Sacramento have swept the\nproblem under the rug.\"\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right. Right. No,\nmy -- my question is specifically with respect -\nMR. SPECTER: And I'll get to that.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- to the 2-year\nplan -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- and I'd like an\nanswer to that -\nMR. SPECTER: Yes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- because I look at\nthis record; I don't see that the district court did\nwhat was required by the Act with respect to the plan\nthat it's ordering.\nMR. SPECTER: Right.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It just simply said,\noh, we're sure -- I'm sure the State wouldn't do\nanything to hurt public safety -- after telling the\nState you've got to give me a plan in 2 years that gets\nto 137.5.\nMR. SPECTER: Right. Well, I think all of\nthe -- it didn't -- it didn't analyze the plan, because\nthe court was trying -- well, there was no plan.\nThe court, what they -- what the court did\nwas it said, we want to give the State the maximum\nflexibility, for comity reasons, to determine how best\nto remedy the constitutional violations.\nNow, on cert, then they said -- they also\nsaid that we're sure the State can do it in a safe way,\nbut it's not our job -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, they said\nwe're sure, because -- but -\nMR. SPECTER: Because there are methods -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- because we\ntrust -- I'm just quoting from 4a -\nMR. SPECTER: Yes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: \"We trust that the\nState will comply with its duty to ensure public safety\nas it implements the constitutionally required\nreduction.\"\nThe State is saying it cannot meet the 137.5\nin 2 years without an adverse impact on public safety.\nMR. SPECTER: Right. And the -- that's the\nState's position -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right.\nMR. SPECTER: -- and had been the State's\nposition all along. The court's findings that a\npopulation reduction of this magnitude were clear, and\nthey're not shown to be clearly erroneous here. They -\nthe court said point blank that we're -- we're -- we -\nit's our finding that the State can reduce the\npopulation to its current levels -- from its current\nlevels to 137.5 safely. They made that finding -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, didn't\nthe court -\nMR. SPECTER: -- and it has not been shown\nto be clearly erroneous. So they didn't have to look at\nparticulars. In an effort to give the State the maximum\nflexibility, they wanted to allow the State to choose\nthe methods that it wanted. If the State -- if the\ncourt had ordered -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, what do you mean they\ncan do it?\nMR. SPECTER: I'm sorry.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Of course, they could do it\nsafely if they built, you know, umpteen new prisons, but\nthat -\nMR. SPECTER: But they can also do it\nsafely -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But that's -- you know,\nthat's pie in the sky. That's not going to happen.\nMR. SPECTER: No, it isn't, Your Honor,\nbecause they can also do it safely by good time credits.\nThey can do it safely -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What -- doesn't good time\ncredits let -- let people out who would not otherwise be\nout?\nMR. SPECTER: Just a -- you know, the -- the\nevidence was at trial, and the court's finding about\nthat evidence was, and the State officials so testified,\nthat giving prisoners good time credits is not a threat\nto public safety.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, didn't -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Why wouldn't it have been\nthe better course, for the State -- excuse me -- for the\ncourt to say, you know, the State said it can do this in\n5 years -\nMR. SPECTER: Right.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: -- without any public safety\nproblem? So why don't we let them take those 5 years?\nMR. SPECTER: Because, Your Honor, as\nJustice Ginsburg and others have been saying before, the\nconstitutional violations have been ongoing for\n20 years. We're dealing here with cases of life and\ndeath and serious injury. And after all these years, in\n-- when they -- when they heard the evidence that said\nthat population could be -- and they made the findings\nwhich the State doesn't argue are clearly erroneous -\nwhen they made those findings, that it could be reduced\nsafely, they had an obligation to provide a remedy that\nwould provide constitutionally adequate care in the\nsafest manner possible -- in the quickest manner\npossible.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I think -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I think Justice\nSotomayor has been patient.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I have several\nquestions, but I'm -- I'm not sure why you have not been\nresponding to Justice -- to the Chief Justice. Didn't\nthe district court discuss different safe ways -\nMR. SPECTER: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- of reducing the\npopulation -\nMR. SPECTER: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- and said we're not\nimposing them because we want the State to do -- to\nchoose among them?\nMR. SPECTER: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: As I've looked at the\nState's final plan, I thought that they had in fact not\nonly accepted all of the recommendations, but they added\na couple of additional remedies that the court had not\nsuggested.\nMR. SPECTER: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Is it a fair statement\nthat the district -- that the three-judge panel was\nsaying, if you do these things -- that's their\nfinding -- you can do it without affecting public\nsafety? Wasn't that what they were saying?\nMR. SPECTER: Yes, Your Honor. If I didn't\nmake that clear, I meant to.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but I thought\nthe -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The second and more\nimportant question is going back to something that\nJustice Scalia asked you, which was: You made the\nstatement that no one was stopped from proffering\nevidence about prison conditions -\nMR. SPECTER: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- up till 2 months\nbefore the trial. So what evidence was excluded?\nMR. SPECTER: Nothing. Nothing.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What point is the other\nside making that they were excluded from making?\nMR. SPECTER: Well, as we said in our\nbriefs, Your Honor, there was no evidence that was\nexcluded, and, in fact, the State's witnesses testified\nabout conditions, some of the conditions current as of\nthe day of the -- of the testimony. So it was very\ncurrent, and nothing was excluded. That way, even if\nthe court made a ruling which was error, which we don't\nbelieve it was, there was absolutely no prejudice.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What is -- what is the\nnumber? I mean, I -- I was puzzled by the same thing\nthat Justice Sotomayor was. I read, on page 253 of the\nappendix, a conclusion where the district court said it\nis our conclusion that they can reduce this by how many\npeople? What is it -- 30,000? It's a lot.\nMR. SPECTER: Thirty-five thousand.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Thirty-five thousand. That\nthis could be done safely.\nMR. SPECTER: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Preceding page, whatever\nthat was -- I have it -- it was 253.\nMR. SPECTER: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: There are about six pages\nwhere they summarize evidence from all kinds of\ncriminologists that say, for example, there are 17,000\ntechnical parole violators that are being sent to prison\nwho haven't committed additional crimes, and they could\nperhaps be released from some of the time that they're\nspending in prison. Then they go on to this good time,\nwhich would, I guess, lead to people who are 50 years\nold or 60 years old who have been in prison for 40 years\nwould be released at age 55 instead of age 75. I guess\nthere's some category there.\nMR. SPECTER: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Then they had several other\nthings. Okay. Now, what are some facts about that?\nMR. SPECTER: There was also -- and there\nwas also testimony that the Department of Corrections\nwas using a risk assessment instrument to identify the\nlow-risk prisoners. So -\nJUSTICE ALITO: Isn't it true that one of\nthe main programs that they were -- that was cited as\nproviding a safeguard is evidence-based rehabilitation\nprograms?\nMR. SPECTER: Yes, Your Honor. All the -\nall the witnesses from the State, the intervenors, the\nlocal witnesses, our experts -- they all found that\nthose would help reduce crime and that they would be\nmost effective if used in the community, but they would\nbe effective also if they were implemented -\nJUSTICE ALITO: What's the general record of\nthe success of rehabilitation efforts?\nMR. SPECTER: Well, different -- you can't\nsay generally because different programs have different\nrecords. But do we -\nJUSTICE ALITO: What did Congress think when\nit enacted the -- the Sentencing Reform Act?\nMR. SPECTER: I don't know, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I have this question, and\nthis goes just to remedy.\nMR. SPECTER: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I recognize the district\ncourt has to be given considerable discretion.\nIt shows the 137.5 figure because it's\nhalfway between 145 and 130.\nMR. SPECTER: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I think that certainly the\nPrison Litigation Reform Act means that you have to, if\nyou -- if there's going to be a release order, it must\nbe releasing the minimum amount -\nMR. SPECTER: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- that will effect the\npurposes of the remedy order. There was substantial\nexpert opinion that 145 -- 145 percent would be\nsufficient. Isn't -- doesn't the evidence indicate to\nyou that at least 145 ought to be the beginning point,\nnot 137.5?\nMR. SPECTER: Well, I -- I -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: That there was no -- and I\nunderstand -\nMR. SPECTER: May I make this -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: There were more -- correct\nme if I'm wrong -- there were more experts that\ntestified that 145 would work than there were that 130\nwas necessary.\nMR. SPECTER: No, I -- I respectfully\ndisagree with the record, Your Honor. The 145 figure\ncame from a report by the former governor, Deukmejian,\nand a group that he organized, and they said that they\ncould operate a crowded system at 145 percent of\ncapacity. And that figure was high, the district court\nfound, because it didn't take into account health care\nneeds.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And -\nMR. SPECTER: It didn't take into account\nhealth care needs, which is the issue here. And our\nexperts testified that, because it didn't take into\naccount health care needs, 130 percent was the -- was\nthe better number. It's the number that the strike team\nhad thought of, the -- the administration's own strike\nteam. It is the number that these professional experts\nbelieved would be sufficient to remedy the population.\nAnd back to my answer to Justice Alito's\nquestion is the health care facilities themselves were\nbuilt to provide services to only 100 percent of -\nhealth care services to only 100 percent of the\nprisoners. So -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But the experts -\nMR. SPECTER: -- 137 -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: The experts that -- who\nwere testifying were quite aware of the fact that\novercrowding related to the constitutional violations.\nThat was their whole theory.\nMR. SPECTER: Yes.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And any number of them\nsuggested that 145 would be sufficient.\nMR. SPECTER: I think there might have been\nonly one; one expert suggested 145. Most of -- I think\nmost -- the majority of the experts suggested 130. The\ncourt found -- and it has not been challenged here as\nclearly erroneous -- that the weight of the evidence\nwent to 130. They wanted to do what you're saying,\nwhich was minimize the intrusion, maximize the\npopulation. So to -- even though they -- the court had\nample basis to issue an order saying it should be 130,\nthey said in an abundance of caution and to give -- to\ngive the State the benefit of the doubt and to make\nsure, we're going to bump it up an extra 7.5 percent.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I see no evidence in the\nrecord that the State -- that the -- pardon me -- that\nyour clients said that 145 wouldn't work.\nMR. SPECTER: I think -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Maybe you can\nanswer.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Did the expert who\ngave -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Maybe you can\nanswer, counsel, please.\nMR. SPECTER: Thank you. My recollection of\nthe testimony was that our experts said it had to be -\nget down to 130 in order for the other remedies to be\neffective, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The expert who gave the\n145?\nMR. SPECTER: Pardon me.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The expert who gave the\n145 -\nMR. SPECTER: There was no expert -- well,\nthere was one expert who said maybe in the best of\ncircumstances it could get to 145. All the others\ntalked about 130 percent.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Let's go to the one who\nhas used the 145 figure.\nMR. SPECTER: He was a psychologist, Your\nHonor.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: He was a what?\nMR. SPECTER: He was -- he was a\npsychologist who has expertise in prison health care.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And did he say that at\n145 you could deliver health care safely?\nMR. SPECTER: He was equivocal on that\npoint. He thought -- he said that at the outer reaches\nit might be true.\nBut I want to emphasize that the district\ncourt has allowed the State to come back in at any time\nto modify its order and to modify this percentage point\nif the circumstances changed. So, since the -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Specter, there -\nthere has been at least two significant changes. One is\nthe good time credit. The California legislature did\npass the law that upped the good time credits and also\naddressing the probationers and the parolees -\nMR. SPECTER: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- and the technical\nviolators to divert them from the system. Do you have\nany information about what effect that legislation that\nwas passed January?\nMR. SPECTER: It was passed, I think, last\nyear. I think it went into effect in July of last year,\nI believe, if that's what -- what you're referring to.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So, do we -- do we know\nat all what effect it has had?\nMR. SPECTER: It has had a marginal effect\non reducing the population. There have been no reports\nthat it has led to an increase in crime.\nBut to get back to my earlier point and your\npoint, Justice Kennedy, about the -- the remedy and that\nit should be the least intrusive possible. This order\nis set to take effect over a 2-year period, and during\nthat 2-year period, if Mr. Phillips is correct that the\nconditions are constitutional and that they can deliver\nservices at 145 percent, then the State is free to come\nin and make a motion to -- to bring those changed\ncircumstances to the court. And, if anything, this\ncourt has been incredibly sensitive to the -- to the\nneeds and desires of the State, and it -- it was\nextremely reluctant to enter this order in the first\nplace, and it would -- and it would bend over backwards\nto give the State discretion while attempting to -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I -- I don't see a finding\nby the three-judge court that 145, is it, would not be\nan efficacious remedy. I know that it -\nMR. SPECTER: Yes.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I know that it would for\n137.\nMR. SPECTER: Yes, Your Honor. I don't\nthink -- I don't think it's explicitly said 145, but I\nthink it discussed the 145 figure in the context of the\n-- of the fact that it didn't provide for health care\nservices. So it discounted that a little bit and went\ndown about 7 percent. But it came close to that figure,\nI believe.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Can I ask you a\nhypothetical question that I know is not your case? But\nlet's say you had the district court entering an order\nsaying you have to bring it down to 137.5 in 2 years.\nThat will, as a practical matter, result in the release\nof 40,000 prisoners. The State comes back and makes a\nshowing supported by experts saying, look, if you give\nus 4 years, we can reach the figure without releasing\nany prisoners.\nDo you think it would violate the Prison\nLitigation Reform Act for the district court to say:\nNo, I want this done in 2 years, not 4 years, and we'll\njust have to deal with the fact there are going to be\n40,000 prisoners out on the streets.\nMR. SPECTER: Well, the Prison Litigation\nReform Act requires the court to give substantial weight\nto -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right.\nMR. SPECTER: -- the public safety\nimplications of its decision. So, under those\ncircumstances, it's -- under those hypothetical\ncircumstances, there's always the possibility that, in\nthose cases, the degree of public safety problems might\noutweigh the harm.\nThat -- as you said, that's not this case.\nThey found that we could do it. And they -- the\nthree-judge panel found that the State could reduce the\npopulation safely. And there was no suggestion in -- in\nthe record that this 2- or 4-year period would make that\nmuch of a difference.\nYou have to put the 40,000 or 35,000 figure\nin context. California releases 120,000 prisoners every\nyear on parole. That's a lot of prisoners. And the\nfindings of the district courts are, even when\nCalifornia increases the number of parolees in the\ncommunities, that doesn't increase the crime rate.\nJUSTICE ALITO: What's the recidivism -\nwhat is the recidivism rate for those parolees?\nMR. SPECTER: Well, it depends on the risk\nof the parolees. The high-risk ones -\nJUSTICE ALITO: In general, what is the\nrecidivism rate?\nMR. SPECTER: Well, overall, the risk is\naround 70 percent, but if you -- for low-risk prisoners,\nthe risk is 17 percent who re-violate, and -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry. I\ncouldn't -- what was the first -\nMR. SPECTER: The first number, when you\ntake all parolees, all together, it's 70 percent.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Seven-zero?\nMR. SPECTER: Seven-zero, because -- within\n3 years. That's what -- the situation we have now, and\nthat's the situation that the governor, the secretary,\nthe court described as a failure. With parole reform,\nyou could reduce that number in many ways, and the court\ndescribed how you could do that. But for the low-risk\nprisoners -\nJUSTICE ALITO: But for the -- for the\nlow-risk prisoners, it's 17 percent?\nMR. SPECTER: Seventeen percent, and\nCalifornia has a risk-assessment instrument which the\ncourt found could be used to make sure that what\nhappened in Philadelphia doesn't happen again. If I\nunderstand it -\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, I understood that of\nthe low-risk -- if only the low-risk people are\nreleased, around 3,000 of them are going to commit\nanother crime.\nMR. SPECTER: They -- but they don't have to\nbe released. First, I want to make sure I emphasize the\npoint that this is a crowding-reduction measure. You\ndon't have to release 35,000 prisoners.\nJUSTICE ALITO: They -- they don't have to\nbe released if you can build enough cells -\nMR. SPECTER: Or you can divert, or you can\nimprove the parole system so that parole violators don't\ncommit so many crimes, if you offer rehabilitation\nalternatives, if you provide a number of -- diversion\ninto the community. There are a number of other options\nshort of releasing prisoners.\nAnd the 70 percent figure includes the -\nJUSTICE ALITO: The 17 percent figure -- and\nthe 17 percent figure goes to exactly my concern. This\nis going to have -- it seems likely this is going to\nhave an effect on public safety. And the experts can\ntestify to whatever they want, but you know what? If\nthis order goes into effect, we will see.\nMR. SPECTER: But the -\nJUSTICE ALITO: We will see, and the people\nof California will see: Are there more crimes or are\nthere not?\nMR. SPECTER: Well, based on the experience\nin other jurisdictions, the court found we wouldn't.\nAnd I want to just -- I want to clarify one\npoint, Your Honor: The 70 percent figure includes -\ndoesn't always include crimes. It includes lots of\ntechnical parole violators, people who have missed their\nappointments, for example. So it's not as grave as some\nof the figures that are -- been thrown by the -- by the\nother side.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Is there any likelihood -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Is -- is there any other\ncase where the prison reduction has been done under the\nPLRA, or is this the first -- the first one?\nMR. SPECTER: It's the first one to reach\nthis Court, obviously. There have been a few others\nthat have been resolved by consent, as I understand it,\nor not appealed, but just a few.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Is there any evidence on --\nI -- I see their suggestions that the technical parole\nviolators go elsewhere -\nMR. SPECTER: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- that the elderly and\ninfirm prisoners -\nMR. SPECTER: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- some of them be\nreleased.\nMR. SPECTER: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: The good time credits for\nolder people would have effect, be increased, and also,\nhalfway houses and other kinds of prison facilities\nwhich used to be called less -- less physically\nrestrictive punishments, or taking the money you save\nand building new prisons. Okay, that seems to be the\ngamut.\nIs there any evidence, statistically or\notherwise -- because it used to be that States did rely\non halfway houses, that relied upon -- they relied upon\ncertain camps -- prison camps -\nMR. SPECTER: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- for example, and some of\nthem were pretty tough. And there were a whole range of\nwhat used to be called intermediate punishments.\nMR. SPECTER: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. Is there any\nstatistical evidence on the part -- on the point that is\n-- that Justice Alito raised -\nMR. SPECTER: Yes, Your Honor, there's -\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- as to whether these did\nor did not result in higher crime rates?\nMR. SPECTER: Well, the evidence was, and\nthe court found -- and, again, it's not clear error -\nthat these programs were not -- were more effective than\nprison in reducing recidivism, and they were less\nexpensive. And -- and that's part of the reason why the\nthree-judge panel concluded that a reduction in the\nprison population wouldn't increase crime.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, one of the\nthing that concerns me about this type of institutional\nreform litigation -\nMR. SPECTER: Yes, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- is that the State\nis responsible for a lot of different things.\nMR. SPECTER: Yes, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And what happens\nwhen you have this case, another district court ordering\nthe State to take action with respect to environmental\ndamage, another court saying, well, you've got to spend\nthis much more on education for disabled, another court\nsaying you've got to spend this much more on something\nelse? How does the State sort out its obligations?\nDoes it say -\nMR. SPECTER: We would prefer -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- well, I'll spend\nmore money to build prisons, but I'll violate this other\ndistrict court order saying I have to spend more money\nto build water treatment plants?\nMR. SPECTER: Well, Your Honor, in this\nparticular case -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I know you like your\nparticular case -\n(Laughter.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- and you want the\nState to say this is where I'm going to put my money.\nMR. SPECTER: No, we're not -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But the point is\nit's a budget prioritization that the State has to go\nthrough -\nMR. SPECTER: Right.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- every day, and\nnow it's being transferred from the State legislature to\nFederal district courts throughout the State.\nMR. SPECTER: Well, I believe the Federal\ncourts have an obligation to enforce the Constitution\nand the laws of the United States.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, no. I believe\nthat as well, counsel.\n(Laughter.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What I'm saying is\nthat you have conflicting orders from different district\ncourts telling them you've got to comply with the\nConstitution by spending 8 billion here; and another\ncourt saying, I've got another constitutional problem of\nmy own, and you've got to spend 8 billion over there.\nWhat is the State supposed to do in that situation?\nMR. SPECTER: Well, my simple answer to your\nquestion, Your Honor -- and I don't mean to be\nflippant -- but they're -- they have an obligation to\nfollow the Federal law, constitutional law and other\nlaws. And if they're not, then the Federal court has an\nobligation to impose a remedy.\nIn this particular case, the State has a\nchoice. It can either incarcerate 140,000 prisoners in\na system built for 80,000, or it can incarcerate a -- a\nlesser number. If it chooses to incarcerate 148,000\nprisoners in a space built for 80, it's going to incur\ncertain obligations. And we believe, as I said in\nanswer to Justice Breyer's question, the State could\nchoose to use less restrictive punishments, alternative\npunishments, get a better bang for their buck, have more\npublic safety.\nBut that's -- if we -- if the court imposed\nthat kind of a rule, then the State would be here saying\nit's -- it's violating comity provisions and making\npolicy choices for the State which it shouldn't. I\nbelieve in this case, the court gave the State the\nmaximum degree of flexibility to make all the policy\nchoices surrounding -- surrounding the incarceration of\nthese prisoners. You just -- the Constitution prevents\nthe State from incarcerating somebody and then not\nproviding them the basic medical care they need to\nescape from the prison and not die before their sentence\nis out. And that's what we have here.\nThank you.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: If you take the State's\nconcession that it can meet a goal in 5 years and the\nFederal court order is 2 years, we're talking about 3\nyears. Is there any indication of how fast the State's\nremedy would click in? Are we talking maybe about a\n5 percent differential for the last 3 years, or -\nMR. SPECTER: Well, there are a lot of\nthings the State can do quickly. For instance, it can\nreform its parole system; it cannot re-incarcerate\ntechnical parole violators. It can -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: No, no. I'm saying,\nassuming -\nMR. SPECTER: Yes.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Compare what the State\nconcedes that it will do with what the court has ordered\nit to do.\nMR. SPECTER: The State -- well, I just want\nto remind you that the governor proposed to the\nlegislature that he reduce the prison population; he\nsaid it could be done safely by the same amount, roughly\n37,000 prisoners, in 2 years. So what the court found\nwas basically what the governor had believed was safe.\nThe 5-year -- the 5-year period is longer,\nand the 5-year period is longer because it takes time to\nconstruct the facilities that the -- that the State\nwants to construct. I believe that's the major\ndifference between the two remedies. But the other\nmethods -- the good time credits, parole reform,\ndiversion -- those can be implemented very quickly, and\nthose substantial reductions can be accomplished safely\nin that amount of time.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So should the court have\nsaid 2 years for everything but construction? Wouldn't\nthat have been a more narrowly tailored remedy?\nMR. SPECTER: Well, the State -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Except that they -\nMR. SPECTER: Well, I was -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- there was going to be\nno construction adequate, because there was no money.\nMR. SPECTER: Right. And the State has -\nhas not really put up the money to construct those new\nprisons. This case has been ongoing since 2006, and\nthey've hardly constructed anything. Even if it was a\nmore narrow remedy, the court found that construction\nwouldn't be a viable alternative.\nMy time is up.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Phillips, you have 3 minutes left.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS\nON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS\nMR. PHILLIPS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nJust a few points. First of all, with\nrespect to the state of the record and what was\nproffered and what was not proffered, if you look at the\njoint appendix at 2085, there's a specific proffer that\nis made by the intervenors in that context -- or I\nmean -- I'm sorry. There's a specific proffer made by\nthe State of the -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sorry. What page\nwas that?\nMR. PHILLIPS: 2085. That's volume 6 of the\n-- and it is at that point where the plaintiffs, the\nintervening plaintiffs say we'd like to put on evidence\nof constitutional violations. And Judge Karlton says:\nTwice this court has said we will not receive that\nevidence. You've made a clear -- as clear a record as\nyou can; please don't waste our time.\nAnd then later, at 2338, which is again in\nvolume 6, where we enter Mr. Dezember, who is the\nassistant secretary of CDCR in charge of health care, he\nspecifically said -- I've read the -- I've read the\nDezember declaration, and it will not be received to the\nextent that it says the State is in compliance.\nSo we've made our efforts -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sorry -\nMR. PHILLIPS: -- and we were rebuffed.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I don't know what the\ndeclaration said. Is the actual declaration in the\nrecord somewhere?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Yes, I believe the actual\ndeclaration is in the record, Justice Sotomayor.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Phillips, sorry, but on\na -- on a different subject. Does the State stand by\nits representation that it can do this without any\npublic safety impact in 5 years?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Yes. I mean, we made that\nsubmission to the court, and we -- we believe that we\ncould comply with it. That said -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: That remains true -\nMR. PHILLIPS: We -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: -- notwithstanding budget -\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, it's -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: -- economic differences,\nbudget differences?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Look, I mean, the plaintiffs'\ncounsel talks about all of the things that you can do,\nand if you -- if you look at 70a of the -- the\njurisdictional statement appendix, it specifically says\nthere's a line; above the line we can implement, and\nthat will get you about 16,000 inmates, and below the\nline you need legislation in order to implement these\nthings. But the reality is that anytime you say you're\ngoing to release 30,000 inmates in a very compressed\nperiod of time, I guarantee you that there's going to be\nmore crime and people are going to die on the streets of\nCalifornia. I mean that -- there's no way out of that\nparticular box.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: But if there were 5 years,\nyou think you could do it without any public safety\nimpact in the way that you told the court you could?\nMR. PHILLIPS: I think so, but I'm still\nconcerned, because the district court in this specific\nsays -- said: We have not evaluated the -- the safety\nimpact of each of the State's -- of the elements of the\nState's proposed plan.\nAnd it seems to me they had an obligation to\ndo that.\nThe other point I want to make with respect\nto Justice Kennedy's question is that there is not a\nshred of evidence that 137.5 makes any sense whatsoever.\nThat is a pulled-out-of-the-air number. Theirs was\naspirational. None of that is based on what is the\nconstitutional violation that exists at the time you\nadopt that particular percentage.\nAnd it seems to me that's the entire problem\nwith this -- this exercise, which is to say we're going\nto fix this across the board, rather than what would\nmake much more sense, which is to evaluate these matters\nfacility by facility, to evaluate these matters on the\nbasis of the various elements discrete elements of how\nyou can reduce the prison population, and to do it in -\nin conjunction with a receiver who is in place who can\nhelp to implement this in a very systemic way and that\nwill get us to where we want to get to.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So why didn't you give\nthe court that as your plan? The court gave you\nabsolute discretion to implement the plan that you\nwanted; it said we don't want to do facility by\nfacility, because we want you to figure out where you\nneed to implement.\nSo, your plan didn't do that; why? Either\nin your 5-year plan or in your 2-year plan.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Because the district court's\norder said you're going to have to reach 137.5 percent\nin 2 years, period. That's the categorical rule. And\nthe first time we went in to suggest something above\n137.5, Judge Henderson said: I'm not hearing that.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Phillips, Mr. Specter.\n"
