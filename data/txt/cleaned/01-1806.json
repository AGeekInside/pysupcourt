HUSZAGH\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. HUSZAGH: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nIt cannot be true that charitable solicitors are\nfree to commit fraud just because they are charitable\nsolicitors. Under long-established common law fraud\nprinciples, it is unquestionably fraudulent to induce\nsomeone to make a gift of money by saying it will be used\nfor a specific charitable purpose when, in fact, only a\nnominal amount goes to that purpose and the solicitor\nkeeps the vast majority. The First Amendment does not --\nQUESTION: What about --\nMR. HUSZAGH: -- displace these principles.\nQUESTION: What about 25 percent going to the\ncharitable purpose?\nMR. HUSZAGH: 25 percent may or may not be a\nmisrepresentation, depending upon what the public was told\nabout the ultimate purpose of --\nQUESTION: The public's told, you know, I'm --\nI'm soliciting for X charity, would you -- would you give\nmoney, please, for X charity --\nMR. HUSZAGH: If the public --\nQUESTION: -- to help children in Cambodia.\nMR. HUSZAGH: Well --\nQUESTION: 25 percent of the money actually goes\nto that purpose, 25 percent.\nMR. HUSZAGH: If the public reasonably\nunderstands that significantly more than that amount goes\nto that purpose --\nQUESTION: I -- I --\nMR. HUSZAGH: -- then it would be a\nmisrepresentation to rely upon --\nQUESTION: What do we --\nMR. HUSZAGH: -- that assumption --\nQUESTION: -- public opinion poll as to whether\nthe public reasonably understood it was going to be more\nthan 25 percent?\nMR. HUSZAGH: Assumptions form a fundamental\npart of human communication, assumptions about the meaning\nof language, assumptions -- assumptions about events and\nconditions. If somebody were to say that they were\nsoliciting money to -- for -- for the family of people who\ndied on September 11, and the people they were referring\nto were their parents who died of natural causes in\nTopeka, Kansas, on September 11 of 1995, that's a\nmisrepresentation, because people are entitled to make a\nreasonable --\nQUESTION: Sure.\nMR. HUSZAGH: -- assumption about what that\nlanguage means.\nQUESTION: That was misleading, but it is not\nmisleading to say, I'm going to -- this money is going to\ngo to this charitable cause when, in fact, you acknowledge\nmany charities have to pay substantial amounts,\nsubstantial percentages in order to, in order to get\norganizations to solicit for them, and who -- who is to\nsay that the 25 percent is too much. I've no idea whether\nit is.\nMR. HUSZAGH: I think that --\nQUESTION: You're just going to give that to a\njury and leave the fundraising to be liable criminally or\nnot, depending upon whether this jury thinks that\n25 percent is too little to go, or -- I -- I just -- I'm\nnot comfortable with that at all.\nMR. HUSZAGH: I -- I think the Court needs to\ndistinguish between two different types of circumstances.\nOne is the fact that there may be legitimate reasons why a\ncharity could have expenses above a certain level. It\ncould be that they're an unpopular charity. It could be\nthat it's a charity that's small, or has recently started\nup, but those are the types of reasons that the Court used\nto invalidate laws that declared expenses above a certain\nthreshold to -- to establish that the charity was a sham\nentirely. Those don't negate --\nQUESTION: It would still be a misrepresentation\neven if they had good reasons for -- for giving the\nfundraiser 90 percent of the money.\nMR. HUSZAGH: And --\nQUESTION: It would still be a\nmisrepresentation, wouldn't it?\nMR. HUSZAGH: And that's my point, that the\nFirst Amendment should not displace that principle where\nmisrepresentations are determined based upon whether the\ndefendant made a material misrepresentation of fact, and\nit's -- i is no different from --\nQUESTION: Well, would this prosecution have\nbeen brought if the fee, if the amount given to the\ncharity had been more substantial?\nMR. HUSZAGH: There's a substantial likelihood,\nor there's less likelihood that such a prosecution would\nbought, been brought, because --\nQUESTION: How would anyone know when the\nAttorney General would be likely to charge them?\nMR. HUSZAGH: I think really the ultimate\nquestion is not whether they're going to know whether the\nAttorney General is going to bring the case, but whether\nthey've committed fraud. Ultimately, the Attorney General\nis not going to prosecute every case of fraud that exists,\nand --\nQUESTION: Is -- is there an intent requirement,\nan intent to defraud requirement under the Illinois law?\nMR. HUSZAGH: As to what we've alleged for\ncommon law fraud, yes, there is, and we've made that\nallegation as -- with respect to all of the statutory\nantifraud counts as well, and to the extent that there is\na concern about the uncertainty as to whether a specific\nstatement may be a misrepresentation, depending upon the\ninability to predict exactly what the public may know,\nthen certainly there's no such objection if the defendant,\nit can be proved knew that they were creating a false\nimpression.\nQUESTION: But one of your affidavits says that\none of the solicitees expressly asked and was told that\n90 percent or more goes to the vets. Now, certainly\nthat's a classic misrepresentation, is it not?\nMR. HUSZAGH: Yes, it is, but our position goes\nfurther, which is that there is no constitutional value in\nintentional half-truths or artificial, contrived ways of\nstating something that may be literally true --\nQUESTION: No, but the concern that we have is\nthat there's no -- there is no way to predict in advance\nwhat is going to be treated or what is going to be found\nas the half-truth.\nLet me put the question to you this way. Leave\nto the side the moment the particular cases that in --\nthat you include among -- among those you have brought in\nwhich at least the allegation is that a very specific\nmisrepresentation was made, no labor cost, 90 percent goes\nto the -- to the -- the objects of the charity. Put them\naside, and consider only the cases in which no\nrepresentation is made beyond the fact that we are\ncollecting money for this charity, and no representation\nis made about the amount of money that's going to go for\noverhead and the amount that's actually going to get to\nthe charitable donees.\nI don't see where any charitable fundraiser\ncould in advance draw a line and say, I don't have to\ndisclose anything under risk of being prosecuted. I would\nsuppose that any charitable fundraiser, if you win this\ncase, would say, there's only one way I can cover myself,\nand that is to disclose the percentages when I make the --\nthe solicitation. Otherwise, I'm vulnerable to a\nprosecution. If that is the way the charitable\nfundraisers are going to be forced to operate, then, in\nfact, we have totally undercut the precedent that says you\ncan't require that disclosure, so my question is, how can\nwe, how could we sanction a system on your theory that\nwould be fair, without, in practical terms, whether we say\nit or not, requiring the very disclosure that we have said\npreviously need not be required?\nMR. HUSZAGH: I would agree that if that were\nthe conclusion as to what would occur in -- in -- if the\nlaw that we advocate were permitted, then the Court would\neffectively be forced to reevaluate the validity of its\nprecedents, and we are not --\nQUESTION: And maybe we should. I'm not saying\none way or the other there, but --\nMR. HUSZAGH:\nthe Court to do so, but it is our -- our premise that\nthe -- that that conclusion does not necessarily follow,\nand it has not been established in this case.\nUltimately, these speakers know how much is\ngoing to be used for various purposes, or they certainly\nhave the ability to know that, and they are the masters of\ntheir own speech, and to suggest that they have no ability\nto know what the public is going to believe, or be led to\nbelieve when they make specific representations about\nseeking money for charity I think is somewhat unrealistic.\nQUESTION: Okay, let's assume that it's\nunrealistic in this particular case. 85/15, okay, let's\nassume you win. 65/35, 60/40, 55/45 -- it's those cases\nthat we've got to worry about.\nMR. HUSZAGH: But I think that the -- the\nquestion then becomes whether the Court should displace\ncommon law fraud principles, which already provide a\nmeasure of breathing room for that type of uncertainty.\nUltimately --\nQUESTION: I suppose the breathing room is that\nthere has to be a false statement, a misrepresentation,\nlet's assume with knowledge of its falsity, which is\nrelied upon by the -- by the listener, that there's\nsome -- has to be damage and so forth. Is that what\nyou -- what do you tell the jury, what a reasonable person\nwould believe?\nMR. HUSZAGH: No. It is important for the jury\nto decide what, in fact, the donating public did believe\nas to how much was going to be used for the purposes\ndescribed, that this is not some normative imposition by\nthe Government as to what's reasonable. This is an\nadjudicatory process to determine what the understanding\nof the public was, and ultimately --\nQUESTION: What would the instruction, though,\nto the jury be under the Illinois law? What must the\nState prove here?\nMR. HUSZAGH: The State would have to prove that\nthere were a material misrepresentation of fact, leaving\naside for a moment the intent requirement. The material\nmisrepresentation of fact includes three elements which\nprovide the defendant with a breathing space for some of\nthe uncertainties that the Court seems to be sensitive to.\nFirst, the assertion must be factual, not some type of\nrepresentation like, this charity is a humdinger that\ncan't be disproved in a court of law.\nThe interpretation, the meaning to that statement has\nto be a reasonable one, which is an objective requirement\nsubject to supervision by the courts, so if somebody\nbelieved that 150 percent of every donation was going to\ngo to charity, that is objectively unreasonable, and the\nCourt would eliminate that.\nQUESTION: Well, what -- what you say would be\nvery impressive and would eliminate my problems if you\nwere willing to go further and say, whenever you say, I'm\nraising money for Vietnamese orphans, oh, 100 percent of\nthe money you collect is understood by the public to be\ngoing to Vietnamese orphans, but you're not willing to say\nthat.\nMR. HUSZAGH: No, because that's not reasonable.\nIt's not reasonable --\nQUESTION: Because that's not reasonable.\nMR. HUSZAGH: It's not reasonable for the public\nto assume --\nQUESTION: 25 percent.\nMR. HUSZAGH: The -- there is no --\nQUESTION: So -- so the --\nQUESTION: So it has a reasonable understanding.\nQUESTION: -- what does -- what does the judge\ninstruct the jury? Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, if\nyou think it's reasonable to send -- or -- or what? No,\nno, it wouldn't be whether it's reasonable. It's what you\nthink the average person would have thought, right?\nMR. HUSZAGH: It's what the Government proves\nthat the donating public understood based upon what they\nwere told, what they were reasonably led to believe. That\nmay include their background assumptions about how much\nnormally goes to fundraising costs or other administrative\noverhead, and that can depend upon the nature of the\ncharity, as well as the statements made by the defendants.\nThe other elements, to finish my answer to\nJustice O'Connor's and Justice Kennedy's questions, is\nthat there is in addition a materiality requirement. It\nis not enough that the statement be technically false,\nlike a difference between 95 percent and 93 percent. The\ndifference has to be material, and that again provides\nthat certain falsity will go unprohibited because the\nmateriality requirement already gives a buffer zone.\nQUESTION: Look at all -- think of all of the --\nof the green, dark green briefs. Those briefs are filled\nwith examples of instances where the telemarketer kept a\nlarge, maybe 90, maybe 100 percent, which seem perfectly\nlegitimate. For example, it's a start-up campaign, and at\nthe beginning they have to keep up more, keep more. For\nexample, it's an educational campaign, and what the\ncharity thinks is, we want to spend this money so people\nwill have heard our name, or will examine themselves for\npossible breast cancer, or whatever.\nOr, it could even be the Nature Conservancy,\nwhere for accounting reasons the money that's going to\npurchase land is not treated as if it were an expense on\nbehalf of the charity, so they're filled with examples.\nMR. HUSZAGH: Well --\nNow, suppose in your case the defendant proved\nthat he was within one of those examples. Would you then\nsay, if the jury believes that, that you should win, or\nthe defendant, and the reason I ask is that I think most\npeople feel, and the relevance of your case is that the\nmoney is going to help the charity, indeed, most of it,\nand what they will have shown is that the money did go to\nhelp the charity, but in this instance, helping the\ncharity was consistent with the telemarketer keeping a\nvery large percentage, so could you explain how, in your\nview, the law works with all those examples in the dark\ngreen briefs?\nMR. HUSZAGH: I -- I think there are two basic\nanswers to your question, Justice Breyer, and one is that\nthe reasonableness of the manner in which the expenditures\nare made is not a proper subject of the Government's\npaternalistic bureaucratic oversight to second-guess that\njudgment, and I think the Court made that clear both in\nMunson and more specifically in Riley, and we are not\narguing that the -- whether the -- the plaintiff's fraud\nclaim for actual specific misrepresentations turns -- they\nwill win or lose, depending upon whether there is some\nreasonableness element to the manner of the\nexpenditures --\nQUESTION: No, well, if you're saying that they\nlose, the telemarketer, even if all the money is being\nused to help the charity, then I agree with the thrust of\nthe questions that have gone before.\nMR. HUSZAGH: Well --\nQUESTION: I don't see how you can possibly\nprosecute people for fraud where there is no fraud --\nMR. HUSZAGH: But that leads to --\nQUESTION: -- and -- and that would seem to me a\ncase where there is no fraud.\nMR. HUSZAGH: That leads to the second point\nthat I was going to make.\nQUESTION: And it's a charity, too, so there's a\nFirst Amendment right.\nMR. HUSZAGH: And I don't dispute that, but --\nQUESTION: Why -- why is there no fraud, just\nbecause the charge is reasonable? Fraud exists if you\nhave represented to the public something, whether the\nsomething you've represented is reasonable or unreasonable\nor not. If the public is unaware that 95 percent is a\nperfectly reasonable charge for this kind of fundraising,\nand the public therefore believes, given what you've said,\nI'm raising money for Vietnamese orphans, that at least\n50 percent of that is going to go to Vietnam, then it\nseems to me you have a fraud case.\nMR. HUSZAGH: That is my answer to the second\npart of Justice Breyer's question.\nQUESTION: All right. In other words, you\nintend to convict people -- you intend to convict them,\nand this may be one of them. You intend to convict the\nNature Conservancy because 98 percent of its revenue is --\nis accounted for as -- as telemarketing expense, where in\nreality, they're buying land with that.\nMR. HUSZAGH: No, I --\nQUESTION: Or you intend to convict the -- the\norganization that is simply trying to inform women about\nthe importance of self-examination for cancer. Is that\nthe answer?\nMR. HUSZAGH: No, it is not.\nQUESTION: Okay, then -- then why don't you\nelaborate on your answer.\nMR. HUSZAGH: Let me deal with the Nature\nConservancy first. I think that's an example in which the\npublic who gives money to the Nature Conservancy\nunderstands realistically that their money is going to be\nused for the purpose of buying land, and to suggest in\nsome artificial sense by a prosecutor that no, really they\nthought it was going to be used in an accounting format to\nbe treated as -- as an expense as opposed to a capital\nacquisition establishes fraud is -- is simply unrealistic.\nThe other example again focuses upon the\nspecific nature of the representation made, and there --\nthere is a wide variety of differences, but if the\nrepresentation is made that the money is going to be used\nto feed hungry orphans in Vietnam, it does not somehow\nbecome, per se, nonfraudulent if, in fact, those funds are\nbeing used to -- to get out the word about the plight of\nVietnam veterans, which is different, and materially\ndifferent from what the representation was to the donors.\nI think that is our basic --\nQUESTION: Counsel, let me ask you this. Is --\nis the State taking the position that there is a material\nmisrepresentation of fact here because the amount given to\nthe charity was a trifling amount?\nMR. HUSZAGH: It -- yes, because it was a\ntrifling amount --\nQUESTION: Is that -- is that how you bill the\nmaterial misrepresentation?\nMR. HUSZAGH: Well, materiality doesn't always\nhave to rise to the level that there will only be a\ntrifling amount that would go to the charity, but there\nwas a significant --\nQUESTION: But in this case?\nMR. HUSZAGH: Yes.\nQUESTION: And your -- the respondent's brief\nsays, well, the Governor had a charity ball, and just\n17 percent --\nMR. HUSZAGH: Well, I -- I don't --\nQUESTION: -- was kept and no prosecution.\nMR. HUSZAGH: I'd rather not use my time to try\nand explain the misleading --\nQUESTION: Uh-huh.\nMR. HUSZAGH: -- impression given by that\nexample.\nLet me just say that the facts of that case are\ndramatically different than were represented, and the --\nthe argument that there has been any impermissible\nselective prosecution in this case based upon some type of\ndiscriminatory element that would violate the Equal\nProtection Clause, there's nothing in the record to that.\nIf there were such a case, the Court has said that there\nis a reserved ability to do so. What I would --\nQUESTION: Do you want to reserve the balance of\nmy time, Mr. Huszagh?\nMR. HUSZAGH: Yes, I would. Thank you,\nMr. Chief Justice.\nQUESTION: Mr. Clement, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,\nSUPPORTING THE PETITIONER\nMR. CLEMENT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThis Court has repeatedly reaffirmed the\nGovernment's authority to protect the public from fraud,\neven though virtually every representation involves\nspeech.\nIndeed, while striking down broad prophylactic\nlaws, every time this Court has addressed the issue of\ncharitable solicitation, it has reaffirmed the\nconstitutional viability of individual fraud actions.\nNow, part of the reason that this Court has\ndistinguished between individual fraud actions and broad\nprophylactic rules is that an individual fraud action can\nbring into bear the entire context of a misrepresentation.\nThe difficulty with a statute like that before the Court\nin Riley was that it necessarily focused on a single\nfactor, fundraising costs, and didn't take into account\nwhat was told to individual donors or anything else, and\nthen categorically --\nQUESTION: But isn't that essentially,\nMr. Clement, what is happening here? That is, these\nare -- to the extent that these are telephone calls, and\nsay, like you to contribute to Vietnam, and this money's\ngoing to be spent on veterans, and that's the extent of\nit, it seems that the Illinois Attorney General is\nmeasuring the decision whether to bring a fraud claim by\nthe percent that goes to the charity in comparison to\nthis -- this portion that goes to the fundraiser.\nMR. CLEMENT: I think that the fundraising costs\nare part of the analysis of the fraud action, but I\nwouldn't have read Riley as making that factor wholly\nimmaterial, and I think the important thing is that in the\ncalls in this case, they weren't just saying, we're here\nto raise money for Vietnam vets. The record suggests that\nthere was an emphasis on particular charitable services.\nWe're raising money for food baskets. We're raising money\nto help veterans here in DuPage County.\nQUESTION: Well, that's fine. I mean, those\nspecific misrepresentations that turned out to be false,\nand some of them said 90 percent is going to go there,\nthose are no problems. The ones we're concerned with are\nthe -- the fraud allegations that are sustained simply on\nthe basis of the fact this money is going to go to this\ncause and, in fact, only 15 percent of it is going to that\ncause.\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, two responses, Your Honor.\nFirst of all, since there are these specific\nmisrepresentations in this case, that alone is a reason to\nreverse the decision, because the Illinois Supreme Court\nseemed to be laboring under the misimpression that those\ncases were wholly off-limits because the fundraising\npercentage --\nQUESTION: We do have to write an opinion\nthough, you know.\nMR. CLEMENT: Absolutely.\nQUESTION: Okay.\nMR. CLEMENT: So let me bring you to the second\npart of the question, which is, I think there are problems\nwhen you have a situation where the only thing that is\nsaid is, we're here to raise money for charity, but I\nthink in reality, you have to give -- you have to trust\njuries in common law fraud actions a little bit to take\ninto account the broad nature of the representations that\nare made. The -- the virtue of a fraud action as opposed\nto a broad prophylactic rule is that a fraud action can\ntake into account the entire mosaic of the representations\nthat are made, and there's no need to focus on one\nparticular tile and see whether it's literally true or\nliterally false.\nQUESTION: Would you be able to show to the jury\nhow reasonable it is for this particular fundraiser to --\nto retain 85 percent?\nMR. CLEMENT: I -- I think so.\nQUESTION: Why?\nMR. CLEMENT: If every --\nQUESTION: Why? What does that have to do with\nwhat the effect of the representation was upon the public?\nMR. CLEMENT: Because there are other elements\nof a common law fraud action. You also have to show\nmateriality, and reasonable reliance. If every single\nperson raised --\nQUESTION: How does that go to materiality?\nHow does it go to reasonable reliance?\nMR. CLEMENT: Because if every single person\nraising money has had these astronomical fundraising\ncosts, which of course is not true, but if that were true,\nthen a -- an individual donor who recognized that might\nwell not have any reasonable reliance on the\nrepresentations that money is going to charity, because\nno -- no charity, apparently, can get any money to the\nactual services that money is being raised, but that's not\ntrue.\nA very important element of common law fraud\nthat I think can provide sufficient protection to\nlegitimate charities is the intent to deceive, and the\nintent to deceive I think is going to make a big\ndifference, because if you have a legitimate charity\nthat's asked by a donor what percentage of the money goes\nto the specific service that you're raising money for,\nlet's say, food baskets, and that charity responds and\nprovides forthcoming information, then I don't see how the\nprosecution or plaintiff can ever show an intent to\ndeceive.\nOn the other hand --\nQUESTION: Okay, but let's take -- let's take\nthe cases, leaving aside the specific misrepresentations\nhere, let's take the case that we've got. 15 percent is\ngoing. I take it you believe that on the basis of that,\na -- a jury could infer that there was an intent to\ndeceive, from the silence?\nMR. CLEMENT: I -- I think that's right, but\nI -- I would say --\nQUESTION: Okay.\nMR. CLEMENT: -- that part of the evidence I'd\nlike to put before the jury on intent to deceive --\nQUESTION: May I ask --\nMR. CLEMENT: -- is when a donor asks that\nquestion --\nQUESTION: But the donor --\nQUESTION: This is not a jury trial, is it?\nIsn't this an equity proceeding? Everybody's talking\nabout the jury all the way through, but I think it's a --\nQUESTION: A fraud action for damages is a\njury --\nQUESTION: I thought it was a proceeding in --\nbefore -- in Chancery in this case.\nMR. CLEMENT: I'm reliably informed that this\nparticular proceeding would go as a bench trial, which I\nthink would provide even further protection for free\nspeech.\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. CLEMENT: I think that -- my answer is in\nterms of the jury because I do think that the -- the\ndecision that this Court announces is going to affect jury\ntrials as well, but what I'm saying is, I'd like to get\nbefore the jury the fact that when these particular\nfundraisers were asked the question, well, where does the\nmoney go, at least the record suggests that they flatly\nmisrepresented where the money --\nQUESTION: You -- you bet, and that's -- that's\nwhat you've got in this case, but as Justice Scalia said,\nwe've got to write the opinion, and -- and if we consider\nthe case in which there were not these quite specific\nmisrepresentations, all you've got is silence about the\npercentage, and a statement that the object of the charity\nis Vietnamese orphans or whatever it may be, it seems to\nme that when you start getting below the 85/25, you get\ninto an area in which the -- the result is a dice throw,\nand if that is the case, the only way the charitable\nfundraiser can protect himself, with the greatest good\nfaith in the world, is to disclose the percentage, and if\nthat's what we are going to require in fact, then we\nbetter face the fact that we're going to have to retreat\nfrom -- from what we've already held.\nWhat's your answer to that?\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, I would say first that we\nwouldn't have any objection if you wanted to retreat from\nwhat you said in Riley.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: You wouldn't mind.\nMR. CLEMENT: But -- but --\nQUESTION: But isn't that what -- that's what\nwe've got to do, isn't it?\nMR. CLEMENT: No, that is not what you have to\ndo, and I think the important thing is the type of hypo of\njust all they do is call up and say, I'm here to raise\nmoney for charity, what that hypothetical tends to do is\nforce the analysis into the single variable analysis\nthat's reflected in broad prophylactic rules, and the\nanswer in these cases, and I think what the opinion should\nsuggest, is that the context does matter terribly, so to\ntake some of the questions --\nQUESTION: Okay --\nMR. CLEMENT:\nI could, when he's worried about the start-up charity,\nwell, if a start-up charity says, hi, we're a start-up\ncharity, but we are trying to raise money for a new cause,\nand here's what we hope to do with the money, that's very\ndifferent than if a start-up charity picks up the phone\nand says, we're a start-up charity, and we're going -- if\nyou give us money, we're going to help this particular\nchild in this foreign country.\nI mean, if a start-up charity avoids fraudulent\nstatements, then that's going to have a reasonable effect\non the mind of the donor, and the donor's going to\nrecognize that, okay, a) start-up charities may have\nhigher cost, but more importantly, the representation that\nI received was not that you were going to provide food\nbaskets in DuPage County, but that you hoped to provide\nspecial services that weren't being provided currently by\nany extant charity, and I think that context can make all\nthe difference.\nAnd there are many elements of common law fraud\nactions. You have to show knowledge of falsity, intent to\ndeceive, materiality, and reasonable reliance. In\nIllinois, as is typical, you have to show those factors by\nclear and convincing evidence. All of that is going to\nprovide substantial breathing room for First Amendment\nvalues.\nIndeed, much of this Court's jurisprudence in\nthe libel and defamation area has been a process of taking\nthe requirements of the common law for fraud, which were\nmuch more onerous, and superimposing them on the law of\nlibel and defamation, where things like falsity was\npresumed, and damages could be presumed, upon a showing of\ndefamation, and I think if you put it in that context,\nthat all of the safeguards that this Court has carefully\nconstructed over the years in the libel and defamation\ncontext are in place to protect the -- the First Amendment\nrights and provide breathing room, then I think that the\nidea that the sky is falling is really mistaken in these\ncases.\nAnd I think to the contrary, if this Court were\nto suggest in a case where the reality is that not just\n85 percent is going to the professional fundraiser, but\nfully 97 percent is going to something other than program\nservices, because VietNow only spends 20 percent of the\nmoney they receive on program services, if this were --\nCourt were to suggest in this case that there's not a\nfraud action, then it really will be open season for\ncharitable solicitation fraud.\nAnd I think this Court has been particularly\nconcerned about broad prophylactic rules in the First\nAmendment area.\ncritically in its prior restraint doctrine, and that --\nthat instinct is reflected in Schaumburg, Munson, and\nRiley, but at the same time, there's a corollary\nprinciple, which specific instances of fraud can be\nprosecuted by the Government, and that instinct is also\nreflected in Munson, Schaumburg, and Riley, and there's\nsimply nothing in the First Amendment that suggests that\ncharitable solicitation fraud need go unpunished, and with\nrespect, I think what the Illinois Supreme Court did here\nin creating a broad prophylactic immunity for charitable\nsolicitation from the law of fraud is just as unjustified\nas the broad prophylactic rules limiting charitable\nsolicitation that this Court struck down in Schaumburg,\nMunson, and Riley.\nIf there are no further questions --\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Clement.\nMr. Copilevitz, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF M. ERROL COPILEVITZ\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. COPILEVITZ: Mr. Chief Justice, members of\nthe Court:\nWhat charities spend or pay for fundraising,\nwhether based upon a percentage or otherwise, are a\nmeasure of the charity's judgment about how much to invest\nin persuasion, a fully protected activity and it cannot be\nsecond-guessed. The First Amendment guarantees the right\nof unpopular organizations to zealously pursue their\ncauses.\nThe petitioner comes to this Court having pled\none case, but having argued another case. The\npetitioner's denial of any intent to impose a cost\nlimitation on charitable appeals, and the petitioner's\nclaim that its only purpose is to combat fraud, is simply\nnot supported in this record. What is clear is that the\npetitioner's claim is focused exclusively on the amount of\nthe respondents' fee.\nQUESTION: Well now, I don't read the record\nquite that way, Mr. Copilevitz. The affidavit that I\nmentioned earlier on page 169, where the -- the woman said\nthat she specifically asked the question and was told\n90 percent or more goes to the vets, that strikes me as a\nstraight common law fraud action. Are you saying that\nthat -- that the State is prohibited by the First\nAmendment from prosecuting that case?\nMR. COPILEVITZ: No, I'm not, Your Honor. What\nI'm saying is that if that violation had been pled in this\ncase, we would have a different result at the Illinois\nSupreme Court. Paragraph 74, at page 104 of the appendix,\nis the paragraph that incorporates these affidavits, and\nthe allegation is simply that if the fee of the fundraiser\nhad been disclosed, they would not have made\ncontributions.\nThe Illinois Supreme Court specifically found,\nas did the Illinois appellate court and the trial court,\nthat there were no affirmative misstatements made. In\norder for the petitioner's case to be sustained, it has to\nhave two legs. We know that cost alone is not an\nindication of fraud, so it has to have some other positive\nstatement.\nQUESTION: Well, what if --\nQUESTION: Why -- why is it that if -- if we\nassume that the donors would not have given the money had\nthis statement been made, that that is not a large part of\nshowing a misrepresentation, I mean, I assume people\nwouldn't buy automobiles or toasters if they knew that the\nmanufacturer was getting 95 percent of -- of the cost and\nthere was -- only 5 percent went into raw materials, so\nthere's always some problems here, but let's suppose that\n95 percent, 100 percent of the donors would not have given\nthe money if they had known the facts. Isn't that the\nbeginnings, at least, of a misrepresentation?\nMR. COPILEVITZ: Well, you're dealing with the\nlesser of two evils. High undisclosed fundraising costs\nare a lesser evil than compelling a point of solicitation\ndisclosure of information that is inaccurate, that this\nCourt has held is not material, and risk creating for\nsmaller --\nQUESTION: Well, why isn't it material if -- if\nthe money would not have been given had the -- had the\nfact been disclosed?\nMR. COPILEVITZ: The percentage doesn't --\nQUESTION: That doesn't -- isn't that another\nway of saying the person is acting under a misimpression?\nMR. COPILEVITZ: No, because the whole concept\nis built on the only return the nonprofit received is the\nnet dollars, and as this Court recognized in Riley, there\nis a wide range of values that the organization receives\nfrom the appeal itself.\nQUESTION: Mr. Copilevitz, it seems to me you\nhave to respond to Justice Kennedy, no, that it doesn't\nconstitute fraud simply to refuse to tell somebody\nsomething which, if he knew, he would not have made the\ncontribution. I mean, perhaps someone would not have made\nthe contribution if they knew what an inefficient charity\nthis particular charity was, or knew that, you know, for\nthe past several years there had been a lot of\norganizational problems. Does the person have to come out\nwith all this upon pain of being guilty of fraud?\nMR. COPILEVITZ: No.\nQUESTION:\nsomeone everything which, if he knew, would make a\ndifference. That doesn't constitute fraud.\nMR. COPILEVITZ: I agree.\nQUESTION: But if you ask a question and you\ngive a false answer, the two examples were given -- I was\nstruck by another -- one of the affidavits' comments.\nThis is the one at joint appendix 1 -- 182. The receipt\nsays it's tax deductible, and now the donor asks, on being\ntold that only 20 percent went to the charity, is it?\nMR. COPILEVITZ: Is it tax deductible? Yes.\nQUESTION: Is the 100 percent tax deductible\nwhen 80 percent goes to the fundraiser?\nMR. COPILEVITZ: That presume -- the answer to\nyour question is yes. The organization receives a benefit\nbeyond the net dollars. The purpose of the organization,\nand if you look at the appendix, Article 5 of the articles\nof incorporation at joint appendix 16 says that one of the\nprimary purposes of this organization is to increase the\ncommunity awareness of the problems faced by Vietnam\nveterans. The contract that my client had with the\nVietnam veterans incorporated a part of that. It\nincorporated a magazine. It incorporated an 800 number.\nIt incorporated distributing information.\nThe difference between the 15 cents on the\ndollar that was received and the fee is value that this\norganization received, so certainly the entire amount of\nany contribution is tax deductible, and it's not fair or\nproper to say that the organization received no benefit\nother than the dollars.\nQUESTION: May I ask a question that's not\nentirely hypothetical? Suppose Congress, trying to get a\nhandle on fundraising operations that are really operating\nto line the pockets of the fundraiser, rather than for the\nbenefit of the charity, would say, if more than 40 percent\nof what is collected goes to the fundraiser, then the\ndonor will get a tax deduction only for the amount that\nactually goes to the charity.\nIn other words, taking your theory, up to\n40 percent, but saying if the fundraiser gets more than\n40 percent, then the donor will not get a deduction for\neverything the donor gave, but only for the part that went\nto the charity, would that be -- would that violate the\nFirst Amendment?\nMR. COPILEVITZ: Yes. An organization like\nMothers Against Drunk Driving exists to advocate a change\nof attitude. They could well enter into a contract that\nsays, every cent you raise I am giving to you to call that\nmany more people in order to -- to deliver our message, in\nwhich case they would have 100 percent cost of fundraising\nunder the approach of the petitioner in this case, and\nthey would be justified, and your gifts to that\norganization would be fully deductible, as they should be,\nand they have the First Amendment right to spend what they\nbelieve --\nQUESTION: I'm -- I'm sorry, I don't -- that may\nbe the purpose of the organization, so that's for the\ncharitable purpose, to spread the word about drunk\ndriving, but the example that I gave you is, the\nfundraiser says, you're not a very appealing charity. If\nyou want us to raise money for you, we're going to charge\na great deal, and you get -- you'll get something, where\nif you were doing it on your own, you'd get nothing. In\nthat kind of case, not the example of MADD, where the word\nabout drunk driving is being spread, but just, the\neconomics of it is that the fundraiser takes 80 percent.\nMR. COPILEVITZ: You presume that the contract\nis made at arm's length in the marketplace. Unpopular\ncharities have the same right to have their message\ncirculated as does a popular organization.\nQUESTION: Well, I -- I presume that just as\nsome charities pay too much for fundraisers, some of them\nmay pay too much for their corporate offices. They may\nenter into exorbitant leases that they could have gotten\nfor half of that had they been better negotiators. Surely\nwe wouldn't reduce the tax deduction because some of those\nexpenses were unreasonable. It seems to me that's simply\nthe way the tax deduction works. If it's an expense of\nthe charity, it's an expense of the charity.\nMR. COPILEVITZ: And the charity may have all\nmanners of expense that may be relevant to one donor but\nnot be relevant to another.\nQUESTION: Mr. Copilevitz, a moment ago you said\nthat in the opinion of the Supreme Court of Illinois there\nwas a statement that the defendants had made no\naffirmative representation. I had not read the opinion\nthat way. Could you either locate it during your\nargument, or if you can't, file a statement afterwards\ntelling us on what page of the petition for writ of\ncertiorari that -- that statement appears?\nMR. COPILEVITZ: It appears in page 348 of the\nopinion, and I quote: Further, VietNow has never\nexpressed dissatisfaction with the fundraising services\nprovided by the defendants, and there is no allegation\nthat defendants made affirmative misstatements to\npotential donors.\nQUESTION: What about the allegation in\nparagraph 63, from 1987 through the present, in conducting\ntheir charitable solicitations, the donors made\nrepresentations which induced the donors to contribute\nfunds for charitable purposes by representing that the\nfunds they contributed would go to charitable purposes.\nNow, that doesn't say what the particular representations\nwere, but they had a lot of affidavits attached which did.\nMR. COPILEVITZ: But the affidavits were\ninherently unreliable. They're -- the --\nQUESTION: No, no, I'm saying, in terms of\nwhether there is an allegation in the complaint.\nMR. COPILEVITZ: It's not -- those -- those\naffidavits are incorporated for the sole purpose of\ndemonstrating that there was not a disclosure of the fee\npaid. If those affidavits were true and correct, each one\nof them would have supported an independent action in\nviolation of a specific statute in the Illinois Charitable\nAssociation Act --\nQUESTION: I'm not understanding.\nQUESTION: No.\nQUESTION: I thought that the question is simply\nwhether they've alleged that there were specific\naffirmative representations, and the status, I gather from\nthe SG's brief and what I've just read, is that they\nallege there were representations, and then they attached\naffidavits which have in them, and there's a footnote in\nthe SG's brief that list the affidavits, statements as to\nparticular affirmative representations, and -- and\ntherefore, I want to know is that, if that issue isn't in\nthe case, fine, but -- but I'm somewhat puzzled as to why\nit isn't.\nMR. COPILEVITZ: It's not in the case. There\nare no allegations -- those would have constituted\nviolations of specific sections of the statute.\nQUESTION: But --\nMR. COPILEVITZ: There was no allegation in the\ncomplaint. The only place they're found are in the\naffidavits which are incorporated as a reference that the\nfee was not disclosed and, had it been, they would not\nhave given it.\nQUESTION: Yes, but the --\nMR. COPILEVITZ: That's the sole purpose of it.\nQUESTION: The Supreme Court of Illinois didn't\ngo off on the ground that there was a separate statute\nregulating solicitation, and that therefore you couldn't\nhave a common law fraud action in Illinois.\nMR. COPILEVITZ: I'm not sure I understand the\nChief Justice's question.\nQUESTION: Well, I -- I thought you were\nsuggesting that these allegations would have been a -- a\nviolation of a specific statute governing fraud, governing\ncharitable solicitation, but the Supreme Court of Illinois\ndidn't say that because there's a statute governing\nsolicitation you could not bring a common law fraud action\nin this case. What they said was that the First Amendment\nprohibits you from doing it, as I understood their\nopinion.\nMR. COPILEVITZ: Yes, sir. What they said is\nthat the only allegation was that the fees were excessive\nand they weren't disclosed, that there was no allegation\nof any affirmative misrepresentation. They did not say\nthat an action couldn't be brought for fraud if there was\nan affirmative misrepresentation.\nQUESTION: This case --\nQUESTION: But I took the --\nQUESTION: This is -- this case -- something you\nsaid I thought was not quite right. This case went off on\na motion to dismiss, so there was no trial. There was no\nfindings of anything and, given the liberality of\ncomplaint amendments, even if you're right that they\ndidn't make those allegations, they surely could, so one\nthing is to say, I thought your position was, no matter\nwhat they said in the complaint, this kind of operation\nmust be allowed to go on, not simply that they -- they --\nthere's a defect in pleadings here, but no claim could be\nstated, not that these -- these pleadings didn't state a\nclaim.\nMR. COPILEVITZ: Well, maybe I'm not clear,\nthen.\nalone, and the failure to disclose those costs, consistent\nwith Schaumburg, Munson, and Riley, are not an indication\nof fraud in and of themselves. The State needed two legs\nto stand on.\nThey might have had the high fundraising costs,\nbut they needed some form of misrepresentation connected\nwith the use of the money, and what the Illinois Supreme\nCourt found, what the appellate court found, and what the\ntrial court found on the motion to dismiss, that the\nsecond leg did not exist, and therefore, the claim could\nnot stand, because to do so would have been contrary to\nthis Court's holdings --\nQUESTION: And --\nQUESTION: Well, why wouldn't --\nQUESTION: And supporting your, what you're\nsaying, the question presented gives us the naked question\nif the 85 percent is enough. There -- there's nothing in\nthe question presented that talks about these fringe\nissues. You're -- you're dead right on that.\nMR. COPILEVITZ: Thank you.\nQUESTION: Well, why can't -- why -- why isn't\nit appropriate for us to say that the affidavits can\nfunction for First Amendment purposes like a bill of\nparticulars, and that the Illinois Supreme Court ought to\nconsider that, and if, under Illinois practice, they could\nfunction as a bill of particulars, then there's nothing in\nour First Amendment jurisprudence that prohibits the\nprosecution.\nThat leaves open the broader question, but in\nthis particular case, why wouldn't that at least be an\nappropriate response for this Court to make with respect\nto the affidavits?\nMR. COPILEVITZ: Those violations of the statute\nare certainly subject to prosecution. That's not the case\nthat was brought by the State of Illinois. They amended\nthe complaint two times.\nQUESTION: No, I realize that that's not the way\nit was originally brought. All I'm saying is, isn't it\nappropriate for us to say, if -- if we otherwise believe\nit, that the affidavits can function consistently with the\nFirst Amendment, consistently with our First Amendment\ncases as a bill of particulars --\nMR. COPILEVITZ: The --\nQUESTION: -- and -- and when you get to that\nparticular level, it's okay to prosecute?\nMR. COPILEVITZ: The Illinois Supreme Court\nfound as a matter of law that those affidavits were not\npart of the complaint, and this Court certainly has the\nauthority to --\nQUESTION:\nprocedure you can't do that, is what you're saying.\nMR. COPILEVITZ: That's what the Illinois\nSupreme Court found --\nQUESTION: I -- I see.\nMR. COPILEVITZ: -- as a matter of law.\nQUESTION: And they said that in this opinion,\ntoo?\nMR. COPILEVITZ: It's the quote that I just\nread, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Could you give me --\nQUESTION: It's all there, isn't it?\nQUESTION: Give me the citation in the\npetition -- the petition for writ of certiorari. If you\ncan't find it now, file it with -- file it with the Clerk\nlater.\nMR. COPILEVITZ: Yes, sir.\nQUESTION: Could I ask you, taking it just as\nyou want to present it, fine, and I think -- I'm -- I'm\nconvinced that there are a lot of instances in which\nsomebody keeping 85 percent of the money would be\nperfectly consistent with a charitable purpose, but there\nmay also be quite a lot of instances where keeping\n85 percent of the money serves no charitable purpose, and\nreally, it isn't much of a charity, and there the public\nis deceived.\nNow, is there anything wrong with prosecuting\nthat kind of charity, and if it turns out to be the first\ninstead of the second, you could raise the claim later,\nafter the prosecution, or during the trial, that we don't\nknow what'll happen in such a circumstance?\nMR. COPILEVITZ: Well, my reservation in\nanswering the question yes is, again, you are focused\nsimply on the value of the net dollars that are received.\nQUESTION: That -- that's correct. That's\nexactly my question. I understand that there are\ncircumstances where that fact, that virtually all the\nmoney goes to the telemarketer and little to the charity,\nis absolutely justified in terms of charitable purpose,\nbut my question, which I'm repeating, is, there may be\nmany, many, many instances where it isn't, and so what's\nwrong with prosecuting those people for fraud?\nMR. COPILEVITZ: Well, I would -- I would refer\nto the decision of Judge Posner in the UCC case, where we\nhad virtually that very set of facts, and the Solicitor\nfor the Internal Revenue Service proposed that, in dealing\nwith how would we know, the notice issue and the standard,\nis there would be a case-by-case analysis, and it would\nevolve, and Judge Posner, I believe correctly determined\nthat that's no standard at all, and if there's no\nstandard, we're back to the lesser evil.\nQUESTION: Oh, no, there's a perfectly good\nstandard, that if you're going to keep 85 percent of the\nmoney, you better have documents showing that you're doing\nit for a good, charitable reason, that's all, and the\npeople who will be prosecuted are the people that can't\nshow that. Now --\nMR. COPILEVITZ: Well --\nQUESTION: Now, I'm not saying that's a\nconstitutional standard. I'm not saying it's a State law\nstandard. I don't know what standard it would be. I want\nto get your answer.\nMR. COPILEVITZ: I don't believe that you can\nmeasure the worth of an organization based upon its\nfinancial efficiency.\nQUESTION: Would -- would you say that the State\nof Illinois or any State could require charities every 6\nmonths to report the percentage of money going to\ntelemarketers and the percentage going to the ultimate\nbeneficiaries in -- in direct payments and file this every\n6 months?\nMR. COPILEVITZ: Yes, sir, and there are some\nStates that do require that.\nQUESTION: I assume that the State Attorney\nGeneral or the State Secretary of State can, indeed, close\ndown charities which are being used as -- as private\nmoney-making ventures. Aren't -- aren't -- isn't\nthat possible?\nMR. COPILEVITZ: There is statutory -- yes, Your\nHonor, there's statutory authority --\nQUESTION: Not -- not through a fraud action,\nbut through investigating the books of the charity.\nMR. COPILEVITZ: Yes, sir, and under section --\nQUESTION: The thing I don't understand, though,\nis the difference between good charities and bad charities\ndoesn't seem to me to have a particle to do with the\nquestion of whether the State was a -- was a\nmisrepresentation or not. You can get 85 percent from a\ngood charity, and 85 percent from a bad charity and keep\nit, but the statement to the public is equally misleading\nin either case. I mean, maybe that's not enough, but\nmaybe it is.\nMR. COPILEVITZ: Well --\nQUESTION: I don't see how the character of the\ncharity has any bearing on the -- on the kind of --\nwhether there's fraud or not.\nMR. COPILEVITZ: I would agree, and I would\npoint to the petitioner's reply brief at the footnote\nreferring to the brief that was filed by Disabled American\nVeterans, explaining the problem of donor acquisition\nmailings, that it can cost $1 or more to acquire $1, and\nthat that should be something that the petitioner should\ngive deference to, and in footnote 13 of the petitioner's\nreply, they took exactly the opposite position and said\nthe fact that it was donor acquisition mailings, trying to\nacquire new donors, was not a reason to set aside the\nprinciples that they've enunciated in their complaint.\nQUESTION: Let make -- let's make an assumption\nthat 95 percent of the donors in the case of your client's\ncharity would not have given the money had they known of\nthe amount being kept by the telemarketers. Is there\nanything the State can do to protect the people of -- of\nthe State from having -- from parting with their money\nunder those circumstances?\nMR. COPILEVITZ: Yes, sir. The State of\nIllinois has a series of -- of disclosure requirements.\nThey're content-based, neutral disclosures. You must,\nbefore you ask for a donation in Illinois, if you're a\ncompensated professional fundraiser, disclose your\nprofessional status.\nYou must also disclose that you can obtain\ncopies of financial records for the organization from the\nOffice of the Attorney General.\nYou must also answer, if asked, what your fee\nis. You must disclose it.\nYou must disclose, if asked, what portion of the\nmonies will go to the charitable organization.\nYou must disclose the primary purpose of, the\ncharitable purpose of the organization.\nThe State of Illinois can publish reports, the\nState of Illinois maintains a web site. There are 800\nnumbers. There are -- there is a requirement that, prior\nto anyone parting with consideration, in the mail piece\nthat is sent, when you are sitting in the privacy of your\nown home, having made simply a pledge in the mail, in\nwriting, there is a disclosure that you can obtain copies\nof the financial information. There is a disclosure --\nQUESTION: You can -- you said many times you\ncan ask, you can obtain. It seems that, then, the\nsophisticated person is protected, the sophisticated\nperson will ask, but the person who isn't, who doesn't\nknow, I mean, your -- your position is, it's okay, if\nasked, must tell, but if doesn't ask, then it's against\nthe First Amendment to require a statement of how much\ngoes to the fundraising?\nMR. COPILEVITZ: Yes, Your Honor, because it's\nthe breathing space of New York Times versus Sullivan and\nRiley and Schaumburg and Munson that we require. It's the\nlesser of two evils. A compelled point of solicitation\ndisclosure will disproportionately adversely affect\nsmaller, newer, and less popular charities.\nQUESTION: And disproportionately affect donors\nwho are unsophisticated, because those are the ones, by\nand large, that don't ask.\nMR. COPILEVITZ: I would point to the concurring\nopinion written by Justice Scalia in the Riley case that\nthe -- that it's the normal presumption of people to\nbelieve that someone is being compensated. They know when\nthey get something in the mail that you had to pay for the\nstamps, you had to pay for the printing.\nYou have in Illinois a step further, the\ndisclosure of the professional status and the information\nbefore you part with any consideration how you can obtain\nall the information if cost --\nQUESTION: Is it -- is it --\nMR. COPILEVITZ: Excuse me.\nQUESTION: In looking at this picture of this\nfundraiser, one of the things that was alleged, it seemed\nto me, is odd. It said that the fundraiser does not give\nthe names of the donor to the charity, to VietNow. In\nother words, the fundraiser keeps the donor list itself,\nand it seems if it were in business to collect for the\ncharity, rather than in business to collect for itself, it\nwould surely give the charity the -- the names of the\ndonors.\nMR. COPILEVITZ:\nand I would suggest that that's something Illinois could\naddress. There are State laws in New Hampshire and\nArkansas that I can recall off the top of my head that\nspecifically require as a condition of a contract that the\nlist and the names be made available.\nThere is nothing in this record to refer to the\nfact that this contract wasn't entered into at arm's\nlength and, in fact, the Attorney General's web site cites\nthe percentage of this contract as being the common amount\nthat professional fundraisers routinely charge, and as the\nCourt addressed in Riley, that the State's paternalistic\ninstinct in protecting attorneys --\nQUESTION: Can we go over that again? That this\nis the common amount that fundraisers usually charge,\n80 percent?\nMR. COPILEVITZ: It can be. That -- it's on the\nweb site of the Attorney General, that professional\nfundraiser fees generally run between 80 and 90 percent.\nThere's also footnoted in the brief a reference\nto a report that was done that veterans groups are among\nthe lowest receiving organizations because of the nature\nof their appeal, and Nation-wide averaged 17 percent, and\nin this case they allege 15 percent, but the reality is\nsomething different than that. Because of the magazines\nthat were published in the last contract they got $20,000\nin addition to their percentage. If no phone call had\nbeen made, they would have received 100 percent of the\nmoney.\nThey got the benefit of a Nationwide 800 number.\nThey got the benefit of 2,200 magazines. They got the\nopportunity to talk to nine of --\nQUESTION: You're arguing that it's a good\ncharity, and I'll -- I'll -- we'll assume that for\npurposes of the decision, that they're -- they're perfect,\nbut it still seems to me --\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: -- you've raised the suggestion that\nmaybe we should use the New York Times standard, and if\nthat were the case, would it not be arguable that your\npeople knowingly made these statements with the\nunderstanding they would believe that they were literally\ntrue, and that there was not an over -- you know, that\nthe -- that the charity was going to get a larger amount\nof the money.\nMR. COPILEVITZ: Well, Your Honor --\nQUESTION: It seems to me the New York Times\nstandard might cut against you, in other words.\nMR. COPILEVITZ: Well, it -- it's for me in the\nbreathing space concept, but what they allege is, in the\ncomplaint is that they raised money for the charitable\npurpose. What they don't allege is that no money went to\nthe charitable purpose.\nIt's a question of degrees. Again, we come back\ndown to what portion of the gross dollar in hard dollars\nwent to the program purpose.\nWhat we can't --\nQUESTION: No, the question is how -- how true\nwas the statement? What is the reasonable understanding\nof the person who listened to this solicitation? I think\neverybody sort of agrees that if they knew the facts, they\nwouldn't have given the money and, as Justice Kennedy\nsuggests, therefore they were misled, and then the New\nYork Times standard suggests to me that you knew they\nwould be misled, because you say it in your own brief.\nMR. COPILEVITZ: No, they would -- there was a\nvalue -- the -- one of the primary program services was to\nraise the awareness of the plight of the Vietnam veteran\nand, as a result of a phone call, 9 out of 10 people\ncalled do not make a contribution, but the organization\ngot the benefit of every one of those conversations, and\nmaybe next year or next month they got a bequest, or they\ngot a donation of a car, or they acquired a donor by\ndirect mail. They're only focusing on one campaign. They\ndon't look at every campaign.\nIn the footnote in the DAV, referring to them,\nthey did not limit themselves. It can be campaign-by-\ncampaign.\nQUESTION: Well, that's an argument that the\n85 percent is an incorrect figure. That's -- then I think\nthe case that's presented by the -- the certiorari\nposition is, assume that 85 percent is the correct figure,\nthen, is it -- you know, is it fraud?\nMR. COPILEVITZ: No, sir.\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. COPILEVITZ: Thank you.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Copilevitz.\nMr. Huszagh, you have 3 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD S. HUSZAGH\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. HUSZAGH: I'd like to first correct two\nclarifications in the record. In fact, the Illinois\nSupreme Court never said that the affidavit should not\nproperly be treated as part of the complaint. They refer\nto the affidavits, but our allegations stand on their own\nwithout the need for those affidavits, which would simply\nbe an elaboration of the types of misrepresentations made\nto donors.\nA second, the web site that the Illinois\nAttorney General keeps does not hold up 90 percent kept by\nfundraisers as the ordinary and usual thing that's\nregularly practiced in this area. They indicate that as\nanother one of several egregious examples that people\nshould be warned against, but that is not the only weapon\nthey should have in their arsenal against actual fraud.\nThis case is not a claim based upon a mere\nnondisclosure of a high fee. It is a claim based upon a\nparticular instance of actual deception based upon\nstatements made to donors that constitute\nmisrepresentations under the common law of fraud, not\nexplicit misstatements as the Illinois Supreme Court said,\nor affirmative misstatements, not explicit lies, but\nmisrepresentations in the form of half-truths, and we ask\nthis Court not to hold that half-truths are\nconstitutionally protected. I think the Court said as\nmuch in Milkovich and the Masson cases, and no different\nrule is warranted here. There is that semantic\ndistinction.\nLet me point out, however, that the key\nallegation in this complaint, in the body of the text at\njoint appendix page 9, paragraph 34, says that the effect\nof representations that were made was that people were\ntold that a significant amount of each dollar donated\nwould be paid over to VietNow, and the defendants knew\nthat was false because 15 cents or less of each dollar\nwould be given to VietNow for its purposes.\nThe allegation is that people were told that\ntheir money was going to be paid to VietNow and used to\nbuy food baskets, to provide job training for veterans.\nThat is an actual representation. Whether it constitutes\na misrepresentation turns upon whether it reasonably led\npeople to believe something that was false, and we ask the\nCourt to continue to uphold those principles in this\ncontext.\nThere is no plausible claim that in this case\nwhat these defendants are alleged to have done is beyond\nthe State's power to prohibit by a properly drafted law,\nthat these circumstances are egregious, and there is also\nno possible claim that -- that any law invoked here cannot\nbe applied against anybody.\nThe fallback position of the defendants in this\ncase is that the Court should take the draconian step of\nsaying that unless there is an explicit misrepresentation\nof fact, not an implied one, that there should be blanket\nimmunity for charitable fundraisers to lead people to\nbelieve that their money is going to be used for specific\npurposes and have no liability if that is one percent\ntrue. That is not something that's justified by the First\nAmendment.\nThey have conjured up dire scenarios about all\nsorts of charities disappearing from the landscape simply\nby the type of examples that they have given for a\nchilling effect. There is nothing in the record to show\nthat, and there is nothing in common experience to show\nthat, but what they're asking the Court is to say no, it's\nnot enough for as-applied claims of that variety to be\nbrought in other cases, but that there should be no\nprosecution ever. The State is categorically prohibited\nfrom bringing a fraud claim in such circumstances. That\nis not a value that the First Amendment supports.\nThe First Amendment value that's most important\nhere is the donor's right to be able to make informed\ndecisions.\nI see the light's on.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you,\n"
