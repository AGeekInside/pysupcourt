Am I pronouncing your name\ncorrectly?\nORAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW J. HARAKAS\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. HARAKAS: Yes, Your Honor.\nMr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:\nOver 70 years ago, the drafters of the Warsaw\nConvention created a treaty which set forth the\ncircumstances under which air carrier liability should be\ncreated in the event of passenger injury or death. The\nlegal regime they created recognized there's circumstances\nwhere the passenger should be entitled to a cause of\naction, but it also expressly recognized the need to limit\nthat liability and set forth certain conditions when that\nlimited liability would apply. Article 17 of the Warsaw\nConvention creates a presumption of liability but only\nwhen three conditions precedent are satisfied.\nOne, there has to be an accident in which the\npassenger suffers a bodily injury or dies and the accident\ntook place on board the aircraft or during the course of\nembarking or disembarking.\nThe issue before the Court here today -- we're\ndealing with the accident condition precedent. Was that\nsatisfied in this case?\nOf course, the -- the Court in Saks in 1985\nspecifically addressed the issue of what is an accident,\nand the Court defined an accident as an unusual and\nunexpected event that's external to the passenger.\nOf a particular importance to this case is where\nthe Court declined to extend the accident and encompass an\ninjury that results from the passenger's own internal\ncondition and -- and in response to the normal and\nexpected operations of the aircraft.\nThus, until recently, the courts have held that\ninjuries arising out of the passenger's preexisting\nmedical conditions do not satisfy the accident condition\nprecedent even if there were allegations of air carrier\nnegligence.\nQUESTION: I take it you don't take the position\nthat -- that, let's say, any death resulting in part as a\nresult of one, but not the only, cause of the preexisting\nconditions is thereby excluded from the -- the class of\nliability.\nMR. HARAKAS: I think you have -- Justice --\nQUESTION: Every -- in other words, having a\nheart condition does not immunize Olympic Airlines against\nliability if somebody dies of a heart attack per se.\nYou're not taking that position.\nMR. HARAKAS: Our position is that if somebody\nis on board an aircraft and they die of a heart attack,\nthat is -- that is not an -- that's a -- the passenger's\nown internal reaction and it just happened to be -- the\npassengers happened to be on board the aircraft.\nQUESTION: Sure, if -- if they're simply sitting\nin the seat and nothing unusual happens and they have a\nheart attack and die, sure, there's no liability. But if\nthere are other conditions -- and the argument here is\nthat there are other conditions -- and the heart attack\nwas merely a contributing cause -- it was a condition upon\nwhich those other conditions acted -- that does not -- the\nexistence of the heart condition does not immunize Olympic\nAirlines against liability. That's -- I don't think\nthat's your argument, is it?\nMR. HARAKAS: Well, no. What the argument is --\nand in this case here, you have to look to what is the\ninjury-producing event? The injury-producing event\nhere --\nQUESTION: And -- and they say the injury-\nproducing event is -- or one of the -- the analyses is the\nunexpected refusal of the airline personnel to allow this\nindividual to get moved into a smoke-free zone. And that\nunusual and unexpected event, combined with the smoke and\nthe heart condition, caused the death. But it was the\nunexpected refusal to remove from a smoke zone that is the\nunexpected event or occurrence that is the accident. What\nis your answer to that?\nMR. HARAKAS: I respectfully disagree with the\ncharacterization, which was adopted by the court below, in\nthat in this case you have to -- you -- you can't just\nsimply look to the fact that you had the flight attendant\nsaying we're not going to move you. He was assigned a\nnon-smoking seat. He --\nQUESTION: He was assigned a non-smoking seat\nwhich happened to be in a zone with smoke.\nMR. HARAKAS: Well, in -- on board any aircraft,\nwhen smoking is allowed, you have ambient cigarette smoke\nthroughout the aircraft, and in this case you have to look\nto -- it can't be disputed that this passenger reacted to\nthe cigarette smoke and the injury-producing event\nindirect --\nQUESTION: But less in -- less in row 15 than in\nrow 48.\nMR. HARAKAS: That's -- that's correct, Justice\nGinsburg. However, when you have -- when you -- in any\naircraft when you -- when they used to allow smoking on\nthe aircraft, as at this time, you could be 10 rows away\nand you would still be exposed to that ambient cigarette\nsmoke.\nBut the point we have to look to is with respect\nto the Warsaw Convention is what type of liability did\nthey want to create. You know, when we get into issues of\nstraying away from the direct cause -- because when we\nlook to almost every single Warsaw Convention accident\ncase, the focus has always been on what is that direct\ninjury-producing event. When we start inserting common\nlaw concepts of --\nQUESTION: Well, you say direct, are -- are you\ntrying to make the -- the act omission distinction?\nMR. HARAKAS: Well, the act and -- in one\nrespect, but -- but in the broader sense, you have to look\nto is what has always been the event the courts have\nlooked to, what did the drafters intend the event -- the\n-- the cause to be? It's not -- I don't think it's proper\nto inject full-blown common law notions of proximate\ncausation.\nQUESTION: No -- no one is -- no one is making\nthe common -- I don't think is making the common law\nargument here. They're saying it was unexpected as a\nmatter of fact that somebody who wanted a -- a smokeless\nseat, who found there was smoke in the area of the seat\nand who was asked to be moved, would be refused by the\nairline. That is the unexpected event.\nMR. HARAKAS: But -- but that's what courts have\ndone after the Supreme Court's decision here by the Court\nin Tseng because at that time, before Tseng, courts used\nto find that it didn't matter whether you had allegations\nof true negligence because we do have to look to --\nQUESTION: The -- the point is the allegations\nare not of negligence, which is a legal and normative\nconclusion.\nMR. HARAKAS: Yes.\nQUESTION: The allegation is simply, as a matter\nof fact, it is not to be expected that a stewardess would\nstand there and say, no, you can't move him. Whether it\nwas negligent or not negligent, it simply was unexpected\nas a matter of fact, and they're saying that satisfies the\nunexpected event.\nMR. HARAKAS: I -- I disagree. I don't think\nthat satisfies the unexpected event.\nQUESTION: Well, it could and it is different\nfrom ordinary negligence. I mean, it is conceivable at\nleast that to have an airline stewardess say no when the\npolicy of the airline and the standard generally is to the\ncontrary and to say, no, I will not consider moving you\neven though there were seats further away from the smoke\norigin.\nMR. HARAKAS: I don't believe in the -- for\npurposes of the article 17 accident analysis, you -- you\n-- your -- you should or should be allowed or it's proper\nto go beyond looking to asking what is that injury-\nproducing event.\nIn this instance here, we have to remember too\nthat, yes, there were three requests to be moved.\nHowever, the passenger himself never asked to be moved.\nIt was always through his wife. He was a doctor. He knew\nhis own condition. I mean, we can all get into the whole\nreasonableness issue, but what happened --\nQUESTION: Which -- which is a matter of\ndefense.\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. HARAKAS: Yes, it's a matter of defense.\nQUESTION: But Justice O'Connor's question and\nmy question is -- is the question that goes to whether you\nget into court to defend. And you're -- you're giving us\na -- an argument that, in effect, we weren't negligent.\nMR. HARAKAS: No.\nQUESTION: But our questions were wasn't it\nunexpected in fact that somebody would be in the position\nthat this passenger was in.\nMR. HARAKAS: I don't -- well, I think that's\nwhere the courts below and where you get -- where you can\ncross the lines and confuse the concepts of negligence and\ncausation in this case because here you could say was it\nunusual, unexpected for a -- for a -- when a passenger\nmakes a request to be moved. In a certain sense, yes, you\ncould say that it was -- it could unusual, unexpected, but\nI think you have to come back to is but is that the\ninjury-producing event. And that's what the courts look\nto.\nQUESTION: Were there other seats available in\nthe economy section?\nMR. HARAKAS: There were other seats available,\nChief Justice.\nQUESTION: In the economy section?\nMR. HARAKAS: In the economy seat section. I\nthink when you -- it was very difficult to determine\nbecause the plane was -- there were approximately 11\nseats. Some of those 11 seats were in the smoking\nsection, but the --\nQUESTION: And in addition, there were the no-\nrevenue people who could have been asked to leave.\nMR. HARAKAS: There were the non-revenue people,\nbut when you look to the record, the only way you could\ndetermine the non-revenue people -- in fact, we had to\nsubmit post-trial submissions after the trial to -- for\nsomebody to testify to interpret the codes that were on\nthe passenger manifest to determine who were revenue and\nwho were non-revenue.\nQUESTION: This doesn't have anything to do with\nthe case, does it?\nMR. HARAKAS: No, it doesn't, Your Honor. It\ndoesn't have --\nQUESTION: So what are we talking about it for?\nI mean, it -- it -- the issue before us is not negligence.\nMR. HARAKAS: It's not --\nQUESTION: The issue before us is whether it was\nan accident.\nMR. HARAKAS: Exactly. It is whether it was an\naccident.\nQUESTION: May I ask this question? I know you\ndidn't argue about negligence, but you do seem to draw a\ndistinction between affirmative conduct on the one hand\nand failure to act on the other hand. And my question to\nyou is, supposing that without asking the stewardess, the\npassenger had gotten into a -- a non-smoking seat seven or\neight rows ahead of where he was sitting and then was\nordered to return to his seat. Would that have been an\naccident?\nMR. HARAKAS: Under the circumstances, no, I\ndon't think under -- for purposes of the Warsaw\nConvention, that would have been an accident.\nQUESTION: That would have been.\nMR. HARAKAS: It would not have been an\naccident.\nQUESTION: It would not have been.\nMR. HARAKAS: Because again, the injury --\nQUESTION: So then -- then you don't rely on a\ndistinction for the action and non-action.\nMR. HARAKAS: Well, because -- well, I do rely\non the distinction between action and non-action because\nyou could have an omission which in and of itself cannot\nbe an accident. I -- I really gave a lot of thought to\nthis. I looked at the cases and I could never find a pure\nomission being an accident. A omission can result in an\naccident.\nQUESTION: Well, why is this a pure omission?\nIt seems to me she misrepresented that the plane was full\ntwice when that wasn't true. That doesn't sound like an\nomission to me. She told the wife to sit down. She --\nwell, how do you treat that she was supposed to report\nsuch incidents to her supervisor and she didn't do that?\nMR. HARAKAS: The -- the bottom line of the\nallegations here were that the -- the flight attendant\nshould have taken action to move Mr. -- Dr. Hanson to\nanother seat, and failure to do so would be --\nQUESTION: And part of what -- part of what she\nhad --\nMR. HARAKAS: -- in itself an omission.\nQUESTION: Part of the picture is things that\nshe affirmatively did do, and part are things she didn't\ndo. And I don't understand that the law makes a\ndistinction between doing what one should not have done or\nnot doing what one should have done.\nMR. HARAKAS: Generally in -- under negligence\nlaw -- under negligence law a negligence can be an act or\nomission. But here, when you're looking to the treaty of\nan accident defined as an unusual, unexpected event or\nhappening, you basically have a non-event, something that\ndid not happen. You -- you see that I think in the --\nQUESTION: Yes, but you -- you say you wouldn't\ndraw the distinction I suggested. So assume the case was\nthe other way around, that the stewardess told him to get\nback to his seat. Now, why would that not be an accident?\nMR. HARAKAS: Because at that point, when he got\nback to his seat, he would be back to his normal assigned\nnon-smoking seat. While in close proximity to the smoking\nsection, again, you have to see that smoke on a smoking\naircraft, a known smoking aircraft, nobody -- you know,\nthere was no surprise here when he got on board on this\naircraft that there was a -- there was going to be smoke\non this aircraft -- is not an unusual, unexpected event.\nQUESTION: But I want to be sure I understand\nyour position. If the stewardess had gone to the captain\nof the plane and said, we've got a guy in the back seat\nwho said he's going to die because he can't stand smoke,\nhe wants to sit in the front seat, and he's grabbed a seat\nup there, should I order him back to the old seat, and the\ncaptain says, yes, send him back, would that be an\naccident?\nMR. HARAKAS: Under the Warsaw Convention, I\ndon't think it would be an accident, and here's why. It\n-- these are extreme examples that -- with respect to that\nwhere -- the passenger in this case -- don't forget too,\nthe flight attendant did give the option to this passenger\nto move. He could have taken self-help to remedy the\nsituation, but he opted not to. But in those type of\nsituations, you have instances where they're very extreme\nexamples, but -- and the convention doesn't necessarily\nprovide a remedy for all those types of situations.\nQUESTION: I -- I take it -- I take it you think\n-- is it Abramson in the Third Circuit where they -- the\n-- the passenger can't lie -- lie down.\nMR. HARAKAS: Exactly, Justice Kennedy.\nQUESTION: You take the position that case is\nwrong?\nMR. HARAKAS: No. That -- that position -- that\ncase is -- is 100 percent correct and it's very analogous\nto our case because in the Abramson --\nQUESTION: That's -- that's -- it seems to me\nthere's an accident in that case.\nMR. HARAKAS: In that case, the -- the court of\nappeals found there was not an accident.\nQUESTION: I understand, but it seems to me that\nthere is.\nMR. HARAKAS: Well, Abramson followed the --\nalmost the exact criteria set forth by the Court in Saks.\nWas it an unusual, unexpected event? And they found that\nbeing seated in an aircraft seat -- you're assigned an\naircraft seat -- is not -- and sustaining an injury due to\nyour own internal reaction was not an accident because\nthey, again, focused on what was the precise factual event\nthat led to the injury.\nQUESTION: Of course, there it seems to me that\nthe -- the internal cause is -- is much greater than it --\nit is here.\nLet -- let's -- can we take the case on the\nassumption -- I think we must take the case on the\nassumption, based on the -- on the findings of the\ndistrict court, that if they had moved the passenger, the\nevent would not have occurred.\nMR. HARAKAS: We have to --\nQUESTION: Now --\nMR. HARAKAS: Yes. We have to take --\nQUESTION: -- if we take the case on that\nassumption, it's -- it seems to me it's got to be an\naccident.\nMR. HARAKAS: I disagree, Justice Kennedy,\nbecause again, I -- I just come back to when I was looking\nat all the cases and looking at the treaty and the text of\nthe convention, you always do have to look to the injury-\nproducing event because the text of the treaty says an\naccident which causes the damage. And I think it does\ncome down to showing what is the direct event.\nI think when you look at the Krys case, I think\nthe Court -- the Eleventh Circuit in Krys clearly set\nforth, I think, a very workable standard. They say let's\nlook at the -- we ask let's look at the precise event. We\nlook at what were the precise events that caused this\ninjury, not the actions of the air carrier that they could\nhave taken to avert that injury.\nQUESTION: But was it determined here that the\npassenger died from smoke exposure?\nMR. HARAKAS: There was at the -- there was a --\na legal finding that it was the smoke that killed the\npassenger even though --\nQUESTION: And do we take the case on that\nunderstanding?\nMR. HARAKAS: You would have to take the case on\nthe understanding because we didn't raise the factual\nissue that he would have died from the food poisoning.\nQUESTION: And is it the case that there would\nhave been seats possibly available more removed from the\nsmoke so that it wouldn't have been as heavy an exposure\nto smoke?\nMR. HARAKAS: I don't -- I don't think there was\nany evidence to establish the concentrations of the\ncigarette smoke. There were seats that were further\nremoved, but then you come down to, again, factual issues\nor determinations as to, well, how far do you remove the\npassenger. Is three further rows further ahead, five rows\nfurther ahead enough?\nQUESTION: But here there was a total refusal\nto --\nMR. HARAKAS: There was a -- well, there was\na --\nQUESTION: -- to provide any help.\nMR. HARAKAS: There was a refusal to -- there\nwas a refusal to move him because the flight attendant\nbelieved the flight was full, and it was, other than the\n10 seats. But the -- the flight attendant did give this\npassenger the option to reseat himself.\nQUESTION: Well, you -- you say you have to\nconsider just very precisely what caused the injury. What\nis your view here of what caused the injury?\nMR. HARAKAS: What caused the injury was his\nexposure to the cigarette smoke under the facts of this\ncase and on the findings. And then we have to determine\nwas cigarette smoke in that area, ambient cigarette smoke,\nunusual, unexpected, and even the lower court found that\ncigarette smoke on a smoking aircraft is not an unusual,\nunexpected event.\nQUESTION: When you say the -- the airline gave\nthe passenger the option to reseat himself, wasn't it the\noption to -- to request another passenger to change seats\nwith him?\nMR. HARAKAS: To change seats with him.\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. HARAKAS: Or he could have -- what the -- or\nhe could have moved through the cabin to see if he could\nlocate an empty seat.\nBut mind you, the flight attendant never had any\ndirect communications with Dr. Hanson. It was always\nthrough his wife. There were two requests made to move on\ninitial boarding.\nQUESTION: Well, but does that make -- does that\nmake any difference in -- in this case, the fact that his\nwife was speaking for him?\nMR. HARAKAS: No. I mean, it would have made a\ndifference in the lower court as to the issue of\nreasonableness and things like that, but for purpose of\nthe legal issue before the Court, no, it doesn't make a\ndifference because, again, when you look at -- when you\nlook at all the various cases, when you come through Krys,\nAbramson, and the other pre-Tseng cases -- and I draw that\ndistinction before Tseng -- the courts universally had\nheld that a passenger's injury arising out of his own\ninternal reaction to the conditions on the aircraft is not\nan accident.\nAnd when you look to the history of the\nconvention itself, here the lower courts, in effect --\nwhile we say they didn't use negligence, they, in effect,\nimported concepts of negligence, reasonableness,\nreasonable alternatives, things like that, those types of\nconcepts.\nQUESTION: How about other courts? I mean, we\ndo look to see what our treaty partners do in this area.\nThe two other courts that were cited in the brief that\naddressed this question seem to agree with the decision of\nthe Ninth Circuit in this case.\nMR. HARAKAS: Yes. Yes, Justice Ginsburg. The\none court was an Australian court in Povi, a lower court\ncase, which that case has been appealed and argued on\nappeal. And that case -- that was in the DVT context. I\nthink that court suffered from the same fundamental errors\nthat the courts here below did in viewing what the --\nQUESTION: What about the court of appeals in\nEngland --\nMR. HARAKAS: -- that --\nQUESTION: -- that disagreed on the -- on the --\nwhatever that --\nMR. HARAKAS: Yes, the DVT litigation.\nQUESTION: Disagreed on that, but did say, went\nout of its way to say, it thought that this case was the\nright way to go about it.\nMR. HARAKAS: Well, the -- on the DVT litigation\ncase, the court found that -- he disagreed with the\nreasoning of the lower courts, but he said that he could\ncertainly understand the result. But he was, again,\nfocusing in on the facts because if you applied the --\nQUESTION: Well, that's surely dictum anyway. I\nmean --\nMR. HARAKAS: Yes, well --\nQUESTION: -- the dictum in that case that --\nthat he thought that this case came out right below. We\nwouldn't even -- we wouldn't even give dispositive effect\nto our own dictum much less to the dictum of a court of\nappeals in England.\nMR. HARAKAS: You're -- you're right, Justice\nScalia. It was dicta. And what happened was in that\ncase, I think he had a misperception of the facts at the\nend of the day, and if you applied the rationale that he\nused for his opinion in dismissing those cases, the facts\nof this case would inevitably lead to the dismissal of\nthis case and a finding of no accident.\nQUESTION: I don't think so, having read his\ndecision and the other members of the court of appeals.\nQUESTION: What was Lord Phillips'\nmisperception?\nMR. HARAKAS: As to the enforced exposure to the\ncigarette smoke because -- because the passenger here was\ngiven the option to relocate, and he could have relocated\nhimself.\nQUESTION: The option being -- the option being\nthe one that was mentioned a moment ago. Your husband can\nget up and try to get somebody else to move?\nMR. HARAKAS: Switch or find another -- one of\nthe available empty seats. Because then you also have to\nremember, again, I -- well, I don't want to get into\nthe --\nQUESTION: She -- she said positively there are\nno empty seats. The -- the option that was given to the\nwife was that you go ask another passenger to switch\nseats.\nMR. HARAKAS: Sure, because -- because at the\ntime, you know, there were only 11 empty seats, and she\nsaid that the plane is full. And that -- and that's at\nthe time of boarding as well, in the middle of boarding.\nIt's a flight that had been delayed for 3 hours.\nEverybody is coming on board the plane.\nQUESTION: But by the time the second and third\ninquiries were asked, it should have been evident that\nthere were empty seats.\nMR. HARAKAS: Well, the -- the second inquiry\nwas just before -- shortly before takeoff on -- on a\nflight delayed for 3 hours, and they're trying to take\noff, and she says, I can't help you right now. And one\nthing -- and then the third one was shortly after takeoff.\nQUESTION: Well, but the -- I wouldn't think\nthey allowed smoking before takeoff.\nMR. HARAKAS: No, they did not allow smoking\nbefore takeoff. It wasn't until the third incident\nshortly after takeoff when smoking was allowed, and then\nshe said, can you please move my husband now? And the\nrequest was denied.\nBut I think with -- with respect to the whole\naccident inquiry issue here, we also have to look to, when\nyou start bringing in the definition of what is an\naccident, when you start equating with issues of\nnegligence and common law, I think we go astray and go\ncontrary to what the drafters intended as to what the\nCourt here in Tseng held, that you don't -- accident is\nnot a common law concept. It's a self-contained --\nQUESTION: If Tseng had held nothing on this\npoint, in fact, it -- it said that the Second Circuit's\nconclusion that that wasn't an accident was doubtful. In\nTseng, it was an academic question. What barred her from\ngetting recovery under the treaty was she didn't suffer\nfrom a physical injury or from a psychological injury with\n-- with physical manifestations. She didn't die and she\ndidn't have the kind of injury that would qualify. Tseng\n-- I think you are quite wrong in saying that that\ndecision passed on the concept of accident.\nMR. HARAKAS: No. I agree with you, Justice\nGinsburg. I may have misspoke because you're absolutely\nright. There was only that one footnote that -- where the\nCourt did express concern as to whether the court in the\nSecond Circuit flexibly applied the Tseng decision. But I\nwas talking about the -- what I meant was the broader\ncontext of Tseng with respect to importation or allowing a\nparallel state cause of action in light of the exclusivity\nof the convention and the uniformity principles set forth\nin the convention.\nAnd if you start importing concepts of\nnegligence back into the convention -- because, in effect,\nwhat the courts are doing below is they're saying, fine,\nwe can't go to State law, but what we'll do is we'll --\nwe'll define an accident to make it equivalent to a\nnegligence cause of action. So there's really no\ndifference. What the courts are doing is nullifying the\nexclusivity holding by equating any act of negligence as\nan accident.\nQUESTION: But are -- are you saying here that\nthe court of appeals really wrote an opinion about -- in\nnegligence and saying that's an accident?\nMR. HARAKAS: When you read the -- the language\nof the court of appeals, it's -- it's pure negligence\nlanguage.\nQUESTION: But -- but it seems to me whatever\nyou think about what the flight attendant did, it -- it\ncan't be classed as negligence here. It was a refusal to\ndo something.\nMR. HARAKAS: It was a refusal. It was a -- it\nwas a -- in my view, it was an omission, and I think at --\nwhen you take omissions and put it in the context of what\nis -- is that an unusual, unexpected event, that an\nomission cannot in and of itself be the accident.\nQUESTION: I don't know if we really have to get\ninto the act versus omission question here because this\nwas more than that. It was a refusal to take action in\nthe face of an alleged severe medical problem and in -- in\ncontravention to the rules of the airline at the time. So\nyou could characterize this, I think, as some kind of\npositive action, in effect.\nMR. HARAKAS: Well, I -- when I think of an\nevent, I think of some type of positive action, and in\nthis instance, when -- when I look at a refusal to do\nsomething, I look at it as -- as an omission.\nBut even if you did look at it as a positive\nevent here, Justice O'Connor, I think you -- although --\neverything leads us back to trying to identify was the\nevent that caused the injury here unusual, unexpected.\nAnd that -- there's only one injury-producing event. For\nexample, let's say nobody asked the airline in this case\nto move Dr. Hanson. There was no request made, and he\nremained in his non-smoking seat.\nQUESTION: No request made? I thought the wife\nmade a request.\nMR. HARAKAS: I'm sorry.\nQUESTION: Excuse me.\nMR. HARAKAS: A hypothetical.\nQUESTION: Oh.\nMR. HARAKAS: Let's assume no request had been\nmade, and he would have remained in that same non-smoking\nseat and he would have died because of the exposure to the\nambient cigarette smoke, according to plaintiffs' theory.\nWhat would be the injury-producing event there? What\ncaused that death? His internal reaction to the cigarette\nsmoke, the normal -- which was normal and expected.\nNow, the fact that they asked -- somebody asked\nfor him to be moved doesn't change the injury-producing\nevent. The injury-producing event is the same. It's the\nexposure to the cigarette smoke.\nQUESTION: Well, but of course, the exposure\nmight have been substantially reduced if the passenger had\nbeen able to get seated in an area further removed from\nthe active smokers.\nMR. HARAKAS: There -- he still would have had\n-- there still would have been ambient cigarette smoke\nthroughout the cabin, as we all well know.\nQUESTION: Well, suppose there were five rows of\nempty seats in front and a -- a stewardess -- and there\nare stewardesses like this sometimes that we don't people\nwandering around the plane. We're serving food. You must\nsit down in your seat. A different case?\nMR. HARAKAS: No, not a different case because\nyou are assigned to your assigned seat, and again, it's\none of those extreme examples that if I believed there\nwere five empty rows here, he probably would have gotten\nup and found it himself. But in that case, I don't feel\nthere would be a different case because, again, I -- I\nfocus in on this injury-producing event here, and the\ninjury-producing event is the exposure to cigarette smoke\nwhich was normal and expected.\nQUESTION: So your -- your submission is if the\nairline requires you to sit in the no-smoking seat for no\nparticularly good reason, there's still no accident.\nMR. HARAKAS: Oh, I -- I disagree on that one\nbecause if they required you to sit in a non-smoking seat\nand you had --\nQUESTION: Well, that was my hypothetical.\nMR. HARAKAS: Okay. If they -- if you -- if\nthey require you to sit in a smoking section?\nQUESTION: No. One -- just one -- one row\nahead.\nMR. HARAKAS: There would be no difference in\nthe situation from this -- from our scenario. There still\nwould not be an accident. He was assigned a non-smoking\nseat and you -- again, you look to was his own internal\nreaction here to the normal and expected operation of the\naircraft.\nAnd I think when -- when you look at the\nconvention, the structure of the convention, and what they\nhad in mind by the term accident, you have to -- you can\nonly come back to that one basic conclusion, that you look\nto what is that injury-producing event.\nI'd like just to reserve the remaining -- my\ntime for rebuttal if there are no further questions.\nQUESTION: Very well, Mr. Harakas.\nMr. Farr, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF H. BARTOW FARR, III\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. FARR: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please\nthe Court:\nThere are basically two reasons why we think\nthat article 17 imposes liability when an airline\nknowingly leaves a passenger in medical jeopardy without\ntaking basic measures to alleviate the harm.\nFirst, because that kind of action violates\nnormal industry safety practices and thus, under Saks --\nQUESTION: Well, that's the question. Is it an\naccident? You assume it. You say that kind of accident.\nWell, I think that's the issue. Is it an accident?\nMR. FARR: I'm sorry if I said that kind of -- I\nmeant to say that kind of action under Saks is contrary to\n-- to the normal industry safety practices.\nQUESTION: Let me ask about Saks. It's -- it\nseems to me that the fallacy in the argument that -- that\nyou -- you run and that the Government runs is that it\naccepts the language of Saks as the totality of what is\nnecessary to be an accident.\nNow, Saks involved a fellow who had some problem\nwith his ear which was -- caused him harm because of the\nnormal depressor -- pressurization of the -- of the\ncockpit. And in denying relief under the -- under the\nconvention, the Court says, no, that wasn't an accident\nbecause the cockpits are pressurized all the time, and if\nit -- it has -- to be an accident, it has to be an\nunexpected or unusual event or happening. Okay.\nSaks was not saying that that is a sufficient\ncondition to be an accident. It was just saying that that\nis a necessary condition.\nNow, let me -- let me give -- give you a\nhypothetical and you tell me why -- why this would be an\naccident. It seems to me the hypothetical closely\nparallels what happened here.\nA man hurls himself into the sea intending to\ncommit suicide. There is right nearby to where he hurled\nhimself into the sea a dock with 30 people on it and 30\nlife preservers at their feet, and not a single one of\nthem picks up the life preserver and throws it to the\ndrowning man. I don't know why. Maybe they're 30\nlibertarians who think people should be able to kill\nthemselves. Whatever.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: Certainly -- certainly an unexpected\nand unusual event. Who would imagine that with 30 life\npreservers within reach of the man, nobody would throw\none.\nNow, would anybody in his right mind say that\nthis man died because of an accident? Of course, not.\nUnexpected and unanticipated is a -- a necessary condition\nfor -- for saying that something was caused by an\naccident, but it's surely not a sufficient condition.\nAnd it seems to me what happened in this plane\nis exactly like that. It is an event after the person was\nendangered. I -- I don't think that this person died\nbecause of an accident. It just doesn't make it. And\nthat's the language of the convention, not Saks.\nMR. FARR: Well, Justice Scalia, it seems to me\nthat -- that the point that you're making, which in one\nsense I think is a correct one, is that the language of --\nof article 17, if one looks at it in purely colloquial\nterms, may not exactly correspond with the definition in\nSaks. But the language in article 17 isn't used -- the\nterm accident isn't used purely in the colloquial sense.\nWhat we know from the context of the convention as a whole\nand the liability system as a whole and from Saks is that\nsometimes it actually captures less than the colloquial\nsense of the term accident, sometimes it's more.\nFor example, the mere fact that somebody has a\nheart attack typically would be, in the colloquial sense,\nthought of as an accident. But we've learned from Saks\nthat it is not itself going to be considered the accident\nbecause of the context of article 17 and the -- the\nlanguage about accidents causing death or bodily injury.\nBy the same token, the deliberate refusal to\nhelp somebody, as the Chief Justice pointed out in his --\nhis earlier question I think, is -- is normally, in\ncolloquial terms, not thought of as an accident. It's not\ninadvertent. It's deliberate. But we know under article\n17 that deliberate conduct can, in fact, be an accident.\nIf a flight attendant strikes a passenger in the face or\nthrows coffee on the passenger in a fit of rage, that is\nan accident for purposes of article 17.\nQUESTION: I'm willing to say that negligent\nconduct such as occurred here can be an accident. Of\ncourse, it can. If -- if the flight attendant spills some\nhot liquid on the passenger causing the passenger to be\nscalded, of course, that -- that's an accident.\nMR. FARR: Well, Justice Scalia --\nQUESTION: That fits the normal -- the normal\nconcept of accident.\nMR. FARR: Of course, but -- but --\nQUESTION: What happened here does not fit the\nnormal description of accident.\nMR. FARR: But my example is not a -- an\naccidental spilling. I'm -- I'm actually talking about it\njust to try to get at the colloquial sense, which I think\nis what disturbs you, that -- that if -- if in fact the --\nthe flight attendant purposely throws the coffee on the\npassenger, just become irritated with the passenger, that\nwould not normally be thought of as an accident, if you're\nasking people around the coffee shop whether there's been\nan accident.\nBut in terms of article 17, it is an accident\nbecause we know article 17 covers instances of willful\nmisconduct. Article 17 is the gateway by which you get to\nany liability, and willful misconduct includes certainly\nthe kinds of -- of things that I'm talking about,\ndeliberate conduct.\nQUESTION: Can this be said to be that kind of\nconduct where it's contrary to the policy of the airline?\nMR. FARR: Yes, it can, Justice O'Connor. I\nmean, one of the things that's a little bit curious in --\nin tying the two questions together with Justice Scalia's\nquestion, this is a -- this is an incident which in fact\nis to some extent intentional.\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. FARR: I mean, the -- it was not inadvertent\nthat -- that the passenger was left in his seat. For\nexample, just -- just to take a different, slightly\nchanged analogy, if in fact the passenger had -- had asked\nto be moved in -- out of the vicinity of the smoke, and\nthe flight attendant had said, let me wait until everybody\nis seated, I'll come back and get you in half an hour, and\nshe forgot to do that, that would actually in colloquial\nterms seem more like an accident. Somehow negligently she\nforgot to come back. But in fact, in this particular\ncase, she was asked three times and knowing in fact what\nshe was doing, she said, no, I'm not going to move you.\nQUESTION: What if she -- what if she'd been\nasked to move him, and she said I'll be back, and then\nanother passenger gets very ill and she has to take care\nof him right away, and then the facts are the same.\nAccident there?\nMR. FARR: The question then I think -- the --\nthe proper way to answer that, Justice Kennedy, is to look\nat what would happen in the normal flight under the normal\ncircumstances. Obviously, under the circumstances we had\nhere, it's unusual and unexpected that she didn't move\nhim. If in fact the reason was that there was some other\nenormous problem on the plane and all of the flight\nattendants had to deal with that particular problem, then\nit seems to me the -- the action here would not be unusual\nand unexpected.\nQUESTION: Well, that's --\nQUESTION: Your -- you stated in your opening\nthat the airline's conduct here was contrary to industry\npolicy, and I think Justice O'Connor premised an earlier\nquestion on saying it was against the policy of -- of this\nparticular airline. Spell that out a little, will you?\nWhat was the policy of -- of the airline and why did this\naction violate it?\nMR. FARR: The policy of the airline and the\npolicy generally, because I think they're in this case the\nsame --\nQUESTION: They're the same.\nMR. FARR: -- was when a passenger requests a\nmove for medical reasons, that the policy is to\naccommodate that request if it's possible to do so. And\nit was possible here because there were empty seats in the\ncoach cabin, so we don't have to get into the complicated\nquestions of whether you have to move someone to first\nclass or to -- to alleviate the problem.\nQUESTION: Would -- would it have been any more\nor less of an accident if that practice had not prevailed\nin the industry?\nMR. FARR: I think it's possible that it would.\nI mean, I -- our position is not that essentially the\nindustry can give itself immunity by lowering its\nstandards so much that -- that acts that -- that clearly\nare unusual, but nonetheless within the -- the industry\nstandard are -- are immune from liability. But I think\nthe general idea is in trying to evaluate things that\naren't obviously accidents, we have to have some sort of\nbenchmark to judge whether what's happened is unusual.\nThe natural place is to look -- is -- is at the industry\npractice. And if in fact what they've done is consistent\nwith industry practice, I would think in the usual case\ncertainly that would suggest there hasn't been an unusual\nevent.\nQUESTION: Well, but it was unusual here.\nMR. FARR: Absolutely.\nQUESTION: So why isn't this an accident in the\nsame sense that having an attendant throw hot coffee on a\npassenger would be?\nMR. FARR: It is.\nQUESTION: Supposing the airline's defense to\nthrowing hot coffee on the passenger said our stewardesses\ndo that all the time.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: There's unexpected about it.\nMR. FARR: I mean, the -- the fact is as I say,\nthat I don't think that necessarily having a very low\nstandard in the company itself or in the industry will, in\nfact, give you immunity, although I have to say I think\nthat in fact that's an unlikely thing to happen because\nwhen we talk about the Warsaw Convention, there's a\nnatural --\nQUESTION: Mr. Farr, can I interrupt for a\nsecond? It seems to me that in the question of whether\nyou move a passenger or not, you could have a situation\nwhich for security reasons, as they have around\nWashington, every passenger must remain in his or her --\nher seat for 500 miles or 30 minutes or so, and refusal to\nmove during that period could not possibly be an accident.\nMR. FARR: That's correct, Justice Stevens. I\nthink -- but -- but the analysis would be the same. I\nmean, one of the instructions that Saks gives, I think\ncorrectly, is that you have to look at all the\ncircumstances. What is unusual or unexpected under\ncertain circumstances would not be unusual or expected --\nunexpected under other circumstances like the one --\nQUESTION: What -- what role does fault play?\nIt -- it seemed to me, as I was reading the Ninth Circuit\nopinion in Saks, that negligence is probably not a\nrequisite. I don't know if that makes it necessary for us\nto send it back. Suppose we think that's true. Would we\nsend it back to the court of appeals and say, no, no,\nnegligence is -- is not the standard, go ahead and find\nfault on their -- or whether or not there's an accident\nunder some other standard?\nMR. FARR: Justice Kennedy, I -- I don't think\nthat's necessary. I mean, what the Ninth Circuit\nbasically said was this is an unusual or unexpected event\nunder Saks because it violates industry policies, industry\nstandards, the company policy, and particularly given the\nnature of the request. If the Ninth Circuit had stopped\nthere, it seems to me that their decision would be\nabsolutely correct.\nQUESTION: Well, it didn't. It went on and got\na bunch of negligence language in there.\nMR. FARR: Well, it's the following sentence\nthat obviously raises at least some questions. And I\nshould say I'm not sure that -- that language in itself\nshould be as troubling as it perhaps appears to some\nbecause the -- the situations that -- that the court\ndescribes there very often will be, it seems to me,\nunusual or unexpected situations.\nBut nonetheless, it seems to me that -- that\nfollowing the adage that the Court sits to review\njudgments and not opinions, that the Court can simply say,\nas we -- we suggest would be sufficient, that you do have\nan unusual and unexpected event when you fail to help a\npassenger in violation of the standard industry practice.\nNow, if the standard industry practice would be\nnot to help a passenger under certain circumstances and\nthe claim is still made that it's unusual or unexpected,\none would need another benchmark for reference, but the\nCourt doesn't need to reach that in this case.\nNow, I would like to -- to also point out that\nin -- in -- when we're talking about the language of -- of\narticle 17, while I think it's -- it's proper to -- to\nfocus on the language itself and discuss it in -- in the\ncontext of Saks, that it's also I think proper to look at\nthe context of the convention as a whole and whether, in\nfact, competing interpretations of the term accident would\nlead to absurd consequences.\nHere I think if in fact the definition or the\napplication of the definition that Olympic tries to -- to\nurge on the Court is accepted, that one is going to find\nthat -- that this convention, which is intended to be the\nexclusive means of remedy for passengers who suffer death\nor bodily injury on an international flight, is -- is\ngoing to have essentially a hole in it where it doesn't\ncover situations even, as in this case, whether it's\nwillful misconduct by the airline crew that causes the\ninjury.\nAnd the focus that -- you know, in terms of\nwhether that is a reasonable understanding to attribute to\nthe parties to the convention under the circumstances, it\nseems to me when you -- when you say a positive act would\nbe an accident, an omission that would cause an accident\nwould be -- you know, would -- would involve an accident,\nbut there's liability whatsoever for situations in which\nthe -- the conduct itself is the contributing factor, the\nfailure to do something is the -- is a strong contributing\nfactor, doesn't really make any reasonable sense as a\nconstruction, and particularly because one of the things\nthat the -- the parties must have understood is that\nduring the time that the passenger is -- is covered by\narticle 17, if you will, from the time of embarkation to\nthe time of disembarkation, the passenger is largely in\nthe control of the airline. The airline determines where\nthe passenger sits. So the passenger's opportunities to\nengage in self-help are greatly reduced.\nAnd in that situation, the idea that the -- that\nthe parties thought that airlines could simply say we have\npassengers on our plane who need our help for medical\nreasons, and we're not going to provide any help\nwhatsoever and that either causes greater injury -- causes\ninjury in the first place, causes greater injury, or in an\nunhappy case like this one, actually causes a death, their\ntheory would say there's still no liability. And it would\nseem to me you would need a very, very clear indication\nfrom the text, which doesn't exist here, to reach that\nresult.\nQUESTION: Well, what if someone suffered, say,\na heart attack on the plane and it was 3 hours from its\ndestination and the doctor there said, you know, you've\nreally got to -- in -- in order to avoid this guy probably\ndying, you're going to have to land somewhere en route?\nNow, would an airline be obligated to do that in order to\navoid this sort of accident?\nMR. FARR: It depends on the circumstances, but\nI think the general industry practice would be, in fact,\nthat an airline would be -- would -- would normally divert\nto a nearer airport in fact to -- to save the -- the\npassenger from death or from much more severe injury.\nThat in a sense is the Krys case, the Eleventh\nCircuit case, that Olympic says is in conflict with the\ndecision in this case. That was a case in which the\nEleventh Circuit said, well, the -- the failure to divert,\nwhich it -- it was agreed would -- would have made a\nsignificant difference to the passenger's health, was not\nunusual because the plane just did the normal thing. It\njust flew to its regular destination. But the problem\nwith Krys is that if you look at all the circumstances, as\nSaks says, it's not the normal thing just to fly on to\nyour intended destination when a passenger has had a heart\nattack and the medical indication --\nQUESTION: Well, then -- then you're saying\nbasically it depends on airline practice whether something\nis expected or unexpected and whether it's the normal\npractice.\nMR. FARR: In this context. I mean, obviously,\nsometimes it's -- it's -- if -- if the context is the --\nthe failure to help a passenger in -- in medical distress,\nthen it seems to me that the usual practice of -- of the\nairline or the industry in general is -- is the proper\nbenchmark, at least initially, for determining whether\nsomething is usual or unusual.\nNow, obviously, there are other kinds of\naccidents, crashes and hijackings and all, where -- where\ncommon knowledge tells you what happened is unusual, but\nwhere common knowledge doesn't necessarily tell you the\nanswer, then it does seem that reference to industry\nstandards is a useful benchmark.\nQUESTION: Would you comment on the distinction\nbetween an event and an accident?\nMR. FARR: Well, the event is under -- under\nSaks -- I mean, the difference is that an accident has to\nbe an unusual event, that not every event is an accident.\nYou have to demonstrate that it's unusual, and -- and much\nof what we've talked about this morning, obviously, is --\nis why this would be unusual by reference to industry\nstandards. But an event, if one looks at a dictionary\ndefinition, is simply something that happened on the\nplane.\nQUESTION: I think it would affect the liability\nfor loss of baggage and so forth. That's triggered by an\nevent, as I understand it.\nMR. FARR: That's correct. It is now. It was\nat one time triggered by an occurrence, and under the 1999\nMontreal Convention it's triggered by an event. Yes.\nQUESTION: Do you think the Abramson case in the\nThird Circuit was properly decided?\nMR. FARR: I don't -- I am not sure the result\nwas wrong. I don't think the approach was correct. I\nthink the court should have asked what the usual industry\npractice would have been in that case, and if the usual\nindustry practice would have been to make an accommodation\nalong the lines that -- that the passenger requested, then\nI think that might have well have been an accident. I\nthink it's a -- it's a difficult question as to whether\nthat would have been true because that particular\npassenger needed to be moved into first class, needed two\nfirst class seats, and in fact part of the solution was he\nwas perhaps going to introduce self-induced vomiting as a\ncure, which obviously would affect other passengers in the\ncabin. So, you know, on the facts, one ultimately might\nhave said -- the -- the judgment that was made there\nactually comported with -- with the usual industry\nstandards. However, we don't know the answer because the\nThird Circuit didn't ask the right question.\nQUESTION: But you do think the Eleventh Circuit\nKrys case was wrong in both reasoning and result.\nMR. FARR: Well, Krys -- we have an additional\npiece of information because the court went on to decide\nthe case. This was pre Tseng. So it actually decided the\ncase as a common law negligence case, and when it did so,\nit found that what the airline had done by not diverting\nin that particular case was a violation of industry\nstandards. So in that case I think what should have\nhappened in Krys is that the court should have made that\ninquiry as part of the Warsaw Convention analysis, and if\nit had done so in fact, it would have limited the recovery\nin Krys, which was many millions of dollars, to the limits\nof the Warsaw Convention, supplemented by the agreements.\nIf the Court has no further questions, thank\nyou.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Farr.\nMs. McDowell, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF BARBARA B. McDOWELL\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,\nAS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS\nMS. McDOWELL: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nA flight attendant's refusal to assist an ill\npassenger can amount to an accident within the meaning of\nthe Warsaw Convention. The analysis focuses on whether\nsuch conduct is, objectively speaking, unusual or\nunexpected, taking into account the ordinary practices in\nthe industry and other indicia of what would be expected\nin the circumstances.\nAt a minimum it's reasonable to construe the\nconvention's term accident, as the United States construes\nit, to encompass the aberrant conduct of the flight crew,\nand this Court has ordinarily accorded weight to the\nUnited States' reasonable construction of treaties to\nwhich it is a party.\nOur reading of the term accident comports with\nthe text structure and purposes of the convention. The\nterm is a broad and inclusive one. It's not confined to\ncrashes or explosions or equipment failures. As the Court\nrecognized in Saks, it can encompass a wide array of\nunusual and unexpected events external to the passenger\npotentially --\nQUESTION: Ms. McDowell --\nMS. McDOWELL: Yes.\nQUESTION: -- assuming that it could have\nhappened somehow in an airline context, would you say that\nJustice Scalia's hypothetical was an accident?\nMS. McDOWELL: I think that a failure of an\nairline employee to come to the assistance of a passenger\ncan, indeed, be an accident. One must recall that even\nunder the common law, common carriers such as airlines\nhave been understood to have special obligations toward\ntheir passengers, not expansive obligations to act as\nphysicians to them, but to provide reasonable first aid\nuntil they reach the destination. So I think that -- that\nthis particular context is -- is quite different from the\ncontext when one is dealing with just a bystander.\nAnd I think under the common law as well, there\nhave been other situations that might well be viewed as\naccidents that involved omissions when one is under a duty\nto act.\nQUESTION: Okay. Let's say it wasn't a\nbystander. Let's say that, you know, they were -- they\nwere relatives. They're the parents of -- of the person\nwho jumped. You still wouldn't call that an accident,\nwould you? Does it have anything to do with -- with\nwhether there's a duty or not? Some States do impose a\nduty on -- on bystanders, by the way, and let's assume\nthat happens in a State where there is a duty.\nMS. McDOWELL: Well, I think the inquiry here --\nQUESTION: You still wouldn't call it an\naccident, I don't think. I mean, nobody would use the\nEnglish language that way.\nMS. McDOWELL: Well, I think here under the\nWarsaw Convention, the term accident has been understood\nto refer to an unusual, unexpected event.\nQUESTION: Okay. But wouldn't you -- Warsaw\nConvention or not, wouldn't you call it an accident if the\nbystanders had put up an advertisement saying, swim with\nus for $500, and then they stood there?\nMS. McDOWELL: Yes, that would -- that would\nseem to be an accident.\nQUESTION: That would get a little closer to our\nsituation, wouldn't it? And that --\nMS. McDOWELL: Yes, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: -- and that might well be an\naccident.\nMS. McDOWELL: Other circumstances -- medical\nmalpractice cases, for example, might be those where an\nomission of some sort, because the doctor is under a duty\nto act, could be viewed as an accident. For example, a\nfailure to diagnose or to treat a particular medical\ncondition until it's too late, if that was negligent,\ncould be an accident.\nQUESTION: Would -- would you say that we ought\nto write the opinion so that if there is negligence, that\nis evidence that normal airline practices were not being\nfollowed, and that's an accident? So that negligence is\nimportant to the analysis, not necessary, but it -- it can\nbe helpful.\nMS. McDOWELL: We would say that --\nQUESTION: Or -- or should we write the opinion\nwithout talking about negligence?\nMS. McDOWELL: We would say that the test is\nobjective reasonableness which connotes some of the same\nconcepts as negligence does in the common law.\nQUESTION: Well, how does -- how does that\ndiffer from -- from the common law at all? If you say\nobjective reasonableness, you're really just changing\naccident into common law negligence, aren't you?\nMS. McDOWELL: Well, not in all circumstances\nbecause negligence isn't a necessary condition for an\naccident to occur. An accident could be an act of God and\nan event that did not involve negligence.\nIn this particular case, yes, the inquiry into\ndue care and the inquiry into an -- whether an accident\nhas occurred are quite similar, but they're still focused\non a different question. The accident inquiry asks\nwhether something unusual or unexpected has happened, and\nthe due care inquiry under article 20 asks whether the\nairline has acted with due care.\nQUESTION: Well, negligence is a proxy for the\nfact that normal airline operating rules were not being\nfollowed.\nMS. McDOWELL: Correct. Now, there may be\nisolated instances where although ordinary practices were\nbeing followed, those practices were so deficient that,\nnonetheless, an accident might be found. Normally,\nhowever, I think that -- that airlines' practices are to\ntreat passengers reasonably. So I think that asking the\nreasonableness question would be the same as -- as seeing\nwhether there was a deviation from standard policies and\npractices.\nIn construing the --\nQUESTION: You know, I think there may be a\npublic policy reason for construing accident contrary to\nits normal meaning to embrace in this context intentional\nacts whether by the airline employees or by pirates or --\nor terrorists or anybody else. But I don't -- I -- there\n-- there's a problem in my mind about interpreting it to\n-- to embrace especially negligent omissions. It seems to\nme that's so far away from the normal meaning of accident\nthat I don't -- I don't see the justification for doing it\nespecially where it converts the convention into\nessentially what it was not intended to be, liability for\nnegligence. That --\nMS. McDOWELL: Well, of course, in this case we\ndon't have a mere negligent omission. We have what the\ndistrict court found to be willful misconduct. We also\nfound -- this case also involves a -- a refusal to act, a\nseries of refusals to act, and -- and provision of\nmisinformation about whether the flight was completely\nfull or not. So it's -- it's difficult to characterize\nthis particular case --\nQUESTION: No, the misinformation didn't bear\nany causality. I mean, the -- the -- what caused the\ninjury here was -- was not the misrepresentation about the\nother seats. It was simply the failure to move the person\nto another seat, and that is totally an -- an omission, it\nseems to me.\nMS. McDOWELL: I don't think it's properly\ncharacterized as an omission when there were three\nincreasingly desperate requests to reseat the passenger\nand the flight attendant responded on each occasion --\nQUESTION: I take it back. Three -- three\nomissions.\nMS. McDOWELL: I think that this sort of case\ncan be contrasted, for example, from a -- a simple failure\nto warn case where the question is whether an airline\nshould have warned about a particular medical condition\nthat a passenger might have in response to ordinary\nflight. This seems to involve much more. Certainly Lord\nPhillips in the English court of appeals thought that this\ncase involved much more than -- than just a failure to\nact.\nThe drafters of the Warsaw Convention certainly\ndidn't intend that airlines would be insurers for any harm\nthat befell a passenger during flight. They did intend,\nhowever, that airlines would be held liable when their own\nfault caused a passenger's death or bodily injury.\nIndeed, they eliminated the caps on damages in cases when\nthat fault rose to the level of willful misconduct. This\nwould seem doubtful that the drafters intended simply by\ntheir choice of the term accident to exempt airlines\nentirely from liability in cases where passengers died or\nsuffered bodily injury because of the airline's fault,\nincluding willful misconduct in this case.\nQUESTION: Well, is airline's fault even\nrequired? Supposing that before the plane took off, there\nwas a big fire in the area and smoke filled the -- filled\nthe aircraft while it was on the runway and then he died\nfrom that smoke, would that be an accident?\nMS. McDOWELL: It could well be an accident,\nYour Honor. It might not be an accident for which\nliability would -- would be properly --\nQUESTION: Why wouldn't it be?\nQUESTION: There's going to be an accident\nwithin the meaning of the convention is what I'm asking\nyou.\nMS. McDOWELL: Yes, it probably would.\nQUESTION: So then the smoke doesn't have -- the\n-- the -- whatever the accidental cause is, it doesn't\nhave to be fault of the airline.\nMS. McDOWELL: That's correct because the\nairlines have the opportunity under article 20 of the\nconvention to come back and say that we cannot be held\nresponsible for this accident because we did not act\nnegligently.\nThe understanding --\nQUESTION: I thought they had to show more than\nthat. I thought they had to show that they did everything\npossible to prevent -- to prevent the --\nMS. McDOWELL: Well, the term in the treaty is\nall necessary measures.\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMS. McDOWELL: But it's been construed to mean\nall reasonable measures. So it's essentially been\nunderstood as a -- a due care defense. And that's\nreinforced in the Montreal Convention, the new convention\nthat has just come into force, that -- that uses the term\nnegligence in its own words.\nThe understanding that the accident requirement\ncan be satisfied in cases like this one serves the\nconvention's purpose of balancing the interests of air\ncarriers and passengers. Such cases do not pose a threat\nof particularly expansive liability to airlines. Cases\nsuch as this one where air carriers do something that is\nunusual and unexpected and thereby cause a passenger's\ndeath or bodily injury can be expected to remain\nrelatively few under the convention, as they are under\nU.S. domestic law. Imposing liability, meanwhile, enables\npassengers and their families to receive some measure of\ncompensation for their injuries and provides appropriate\nincentives for airline supervision and -- and training of\ntheir personnel.\nFor all of these reasons, we'd ask the judgment\nof the court of appeals be affirmed.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Ms. McDowell.\nMr. Harakas, you have 3 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW J. HARAKAS\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. HARAKAS: Mr. Chief Justice, I think when\nyou -- when you look at the arguments that were made both\nby the respondents and the Solicitor General, it all comes\nback to the issue of negligence, wanting to equate an\naccident with negligence.\nThe Warsaw Convention wasn't an all-encompassing\ntreaty. There were certain holes left in the convention\nwhere there wasn't going to be recovery. For example, if\nthere's no bodily injury, there's no recovery under the\nWarsaw Convention, as set forth by the Floyd decision, no\nmatter, let's say, how egregious the air carrier's conduct\nmay have been. It set forth certain things, and the\nconvention wanted to define the liability based on the --\nby using that term accident not making reference to\nvarious common law notions.\nI think one of the problems that we're seeing is\nthat confusing what is the accident -- and that's why I\nalways come back to the injury-producing event. In the\nhijacking situation, for example, the accident there isn't\nthe failure of the airline to conduct proper screening and\nallowing the hijackers to come on board the aircraft. The\naccident is those hijackers get on the -- on the airplane\nand they injure a passenger. And that -- the injury\nitself is the accident. Just like in the smoke example,\nif there was a fire someplace and the cabin filled up with\nsmoke, the smoke itself injuring the passenger is the\naccident. Why the smoke got there is completely\nirrelevant.\nSo when you -- when you start injecting the\nwhole concepts of negligence, I think you upset the whole\nbalance of the convention, and -- and one of the principal\ngoals of the convention was to have a uniformity and to\nlimit the liability of the carrier. In fact, the Montreal\nConvention of 1999, which just -- which just entered into\nforce last week here in the United States, retained the\nterm accident. The issue of whether the carrier should be\nliable for the state of the health of the passenger has\nalways been a very special and unique issue in the context\nof the convention's history. Post-ratification conduct\nfrom 1945 all the way through the -- all the way to the --\nthe Montreal Convention of 1999, the contracting states\nwere very careful and very reluctant to make the carriers\nliable for injuries arising out of their -- out of the\nstate of health of the passenger.\nAnd the -- with respect to the policy arguments\nwhere they say -- where the respondents and Solicitor\nGeneral say that the -- there are certainly policy reasons\nshould be considered in weighing in favor of the\npassengers in this instance, I think when you look to --\nyou have to apply the strict terms of the convention. And\neach time this Court has been confronted with similar\npolicy arguments, they have been rejected. In Saks, the\n-- the passenger was left without a remedy because they\ncouldn't -- because the passenger couldn't satisfy the --\nthe accident condition precedent. The same thing in\nFloyd. There they couldn't satisfy the bodily injury\nrequirement. And in Tseng, where the -- there was no\nremedy allowed under State law when they couldn't satisfy\nthe accident or the bodily injury conditions precedent.\nFocusing on what the injury-producing event and\nwhether that event is unusual, unexpected, and external to\nthe passenger -- thank you, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr.\nHarakas.\n"
