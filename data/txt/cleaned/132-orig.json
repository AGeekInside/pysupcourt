North Carolina.\nMr. Phillips.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS\nON BEHALF OF THE PLAINTIFFS\nMR. PHILLIPS: Thank you, Mr. Chief\nJustice, and may it please the Court:\nNorth Carolina breached the Southeast\nCompact in this case. Whether you examine it from\nthe perspective of the sanctions that were imposed by\nthe Commission, or whether you evaluate it from the\nperspective of the repeated statements by the\nexecutives of the Commission that there had been a\nmaterial breach and a repudiation, or whether you\nexamine it from the perspective of the undisputed\nrecord that was collected by the Special Master, the\nconclusion, it seems to me, is inescapable that what\nNorth Carolina did here by taking no action between\nDecember 1997 and July of 1996 simply does not\nfulfill the responsibilities that they had -- that\nNorth Carolina had assumed, and therefore the only\nissue should be: What is the appropriate remedy for\nthis extraordinary breach?\nTo go to the specific record, just to be\nclear about this, the Special Master says at page 10\nof his report: \"The parties do not dispute that\nNorth Carolina did not take additional steps to\npursue a license for a waste facility during that\nperiod.\" Our undisputed statement of facts is that\nNorth Carolina took no further steps to license\nbetween 1997 and 1999.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Phillips, the point\nthat North Carolina makes is it would be throwing\naway the taxpayers' money to no purpose. That is,\nwhat is the point of continuing to pursue a license\nwhen North Carolina does not have the funding to\ncontinue the process and to open the disposal\nfacility?\nSo North Carolina's point of view is: What\ndoes it mean to continue to seek the license when\nthey are not going to have the money to get to the\nend of the line?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right. Well, North Carolina\nassumed the responsibility more than a decade prior\nto that time to take all appropriate steps in order\nto provide for licensing and for construction of a\nfacility. \"Appropriate steps\" in that context has to\nmean something more than simply doing nothing,\ndeclaring categorically that you are going to\nrepudiate the agreement, and attempting to extort\nfrom the compact and its Commission additional monies\nthat it is absolutely clear that the Commission has\nno responsibility to North Carolina to pay.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But the --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But how much -- how much\ndid the Commission give before this? It just did\nthat out of the goodness of its heart?\nMR. PHILLIPS: No, it did it with -- with\nthe approval of the other States in the compact, for\nthe purpose of promoting the ultimate objective of\nthe -- of the contract --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And -- and I think that\none of the best indications of what -- what a\ncontract means is the manner in which the parties act\nunder the contract, and that suggests to me that it\nwas never contemplated that North Carolina alone\nwould foot the bill for -- for obtaining this\nlicense.\nMR. PHILLIPS: The language of the -- of\nthe compact itself, Justice Scalia, is quite plain.\nIt's clear that the Commission has no responsibility\nto create -- to pay for the creation of this -- of\nthis facility. That was clear from day one.\nNorth Carolina, not only in its legislation\nauthorizing its authority, but also its governor\nrepeatedly saying, we understand that we have a\nresponsibility to create this facility, that --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: At what cost?\nMR. PHILLIPS: At whatever cost --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What the Special Master\nsaid was, I believe, that there was never an\nobligation to do it at all costs. They didn't have\nto bankrupt their treasury to do this; is that\ncorrect?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Do you accept that as a\nworking proposition?\nMR. PHILLIPS: I would say that the -- that\nthe State of North Carolina would have -- have a\ndefense of impossibility if they could argue that\ngoing down this path would have bankrupted North\nCarolina.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, I think there was\ncertainly a significant amount of evidence that the\ncost of completing this project was way above any\nreasonable expectation of the parties at the time of\ncontracting, correct?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Yes, but the -- but the\npayment of $80 million by the Commission was way\nabove what any of the parties expected at the\nbeginning of the process as well.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What -- what do you\nbelieve the evidence shows with respect to the\nreasonable cost of completing this project?\nMR. PHILLIPS: I think it was reasonable to\nassume that the construction of the facility itself\nwould have cost an additional $75 million.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And about a -- an\nadditional 34,000 to get the license?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Probably 34 million to\ncomplete the license.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So -- I'm sorry. I\nmisspoke. So over $100 million?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right, but the -- the --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: An amount equal to what\nthey had already -- everybody had already put in?\nMR. PHILLIPS: To be sure, but the -- but\nthe --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And about how many\ntimes greater than the initial estimates?\nMR. PHILLIPS: I don't know that there were\nany initial estimates, at least that I recall.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I thought it was about\n20 or 30 million dollars was initially estimated to\n- to do this project.\nMR. PHILLIPS: I doubt that that would have\nincluded the full construction.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I -- I'm only going\nthrough these to try to get a sense from you of at\nwhat point did North Carolina have a right to claim\nimpossibility? You are saying that --\nMR. PHILLIPS: Yes. I mean, I think North\nCarolina -- first of all, North Carolina never did\nassert a right of impossibility.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, it did by saying,\nwe can't complete this project.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, it said it wouldn't\ncomplete this project. It imposed upon us and\nunilaterally imposed upon the other States to the\ncompact the obligation to fund, an obligation none of\nthem had -- had assumed under the contract.\nTo be sure, they had provided moneys to\nNorth Carolina with the expectation that North\nCarolina would use those moneys ultimately to build a\nproject. But the reality is in 1997, in December,\nNorth Carolina unilaterally declared that they were\nnot going to complete the project and that they were\ngoing to take no actions further -- in furtherance --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So your argument is then\nthat they acted 2 years too late. When they gave\nnotice that they were not able to go forward, but\nthey were going to keep this thing going, so if the\nfunds should somehow become available, they would\nhave the -- they would have things still in place.\nThey wouldn't have terminated the effort.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right. Yes, Justice\nGinsburg. Our argument is that -- you know, whether\n-- you know --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So if they had done\neverything the same --\nMR. PHILLIPS: I think there's an open\nquestion of whether the withdrawal in '97 would have\nbeen in good faith or not. That would be a separate\nissue. But there is no question that the one thing\nthat a contracting party does not have the right to\ndo is to unilaterally decide to repudiate the\nagreement, get the benefit of the agreement --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But they told you what\n- it was totally up-front. They said: Look, we\ncan't go forward with this. We haven't got the\nmoney. We'll let everything sit, to see if someone\nwill come up with the money.\nThat's -- it's -- you paint a picture of\nrepudiating the contract, when North Carolina gave\nnotice in '97 that it would have to fold if it didn't\nget the money.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right, and -- and the\nquestion then, obviously, that -- the legal issue\nthat that presents is whether or not a party to a\ncontract who is not entitled to expect the other\nparticipants to the agreement to pay any more money\nor in fact any money whatsoever has the authority\nessentially to attempt to extort that money while\ncontinuing to gain the benefits of the contract for\nan additional year and a half; at that point, then\nthey -- then they withdraw.\nWe can debate about whether the withdrawal\nwas in good faith or not. But the bottom line is\nthere is no substantial difference between the\nrepudiation and the complete disregard of the\ncontractual obligations.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What were the benefits\nthat North Carolina was getting by paying whatever it\nwas -- 400-odd thousand dollars -- to keep it going\nfor another 2 years?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, the benefits of being\na part of the compact is all of the powers that the\nCommission had to deal with other compacts in terms\nof how to license -- not how to license, but how to\ndispose of waste. They got all of the benefits of\nbeing a part of a compact during the entirety of that\nperiod. So, you know, it was not in their interest\nto repudiate this agreement or to withdraw from it\nuntil they got to the point where they were -- where\nthey recognized that they were about to be sanctioned\nfor their failure to comply with their\nresponsibilities.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Were there any benefits to\nthe contract at all until -- unless and until there\nwas a waste facility constructed?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, there were huge\nbenefits, Justice Scalia.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What?\nMR. PHILLIPS: The Barnwell facility in\nSouth Carolina was disposing of waste and was only\ngoing to take wastes from the compact States in the\nSoutheast Compact. So North Carolina had -- had\nample access to that South Carolina facility that, if\nit had never joined the compact, it never would have\nhad available to it.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: At what point did South\nCarolina withdraw?\nMR. PHILLIPS: In 1995, Justice Ginsburg.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And so they -- by 1997,\nthey didn't have any access to Barnwell anymore.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right, but they still had\nthe benefit of the compact's -- the Commission's\nauthority to negotiate on behalf of the member States\ndeals with other compacts for the disposal in those\nfacilities which you otherwise don't have the benefit\nof.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It sounds to me pretty\nhypothetical. And I find it difficult to believe\nthat there is an obligation to commit money and a\nliability for failure to do so in a compact which\nsays that the State can withdraw at any time. You\ntalk about good faith withdrawal. What would be bad\nfaith withdrawal? North Carolina simply says: It's\nno longer worth our trouble.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, this would be bad\nfaith withdrawal.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Where the State assumes --\naccepts $80 million, goes down a path, is not\nentitled to any of that money or to any other money,\nand then unilaterally withdraws --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Did it misspend that\nmoney? Are you saying the money was misspent?\nMR. PHILLIPS: That's an open issue at this\npoint. We haven't analyzed that. That's part of\nwhat I think what would be involved with the last\nthree counts of the -- of the complaint. We don't\nknow exactly whether that money was properly spent or\nnot.\nBut -- but either way, I think it is\nimportant to recognize that, even if it were not,\nquote \"misspent\", at the end of the day which entity\nhas the benefit of the $80 million? Is it the six\nmembers of the compact today? No. It's North\nCarolina.\nIf the -- if the Federal Government were to\ndeclare tomorrow, in response to some terrorist\nproblem, that on-site storage of low-level nuclear\nwaste is no longer permissible and that those wastes\nhave got to be disposed of somewhere other -- in some\nother kind of a facility, the State that is -- other\nthan Texas, which is about to start one up, but the\nState that's clearly in the best position to do that\ntoday is North Carolina. Why? Because they have got\na $134 million jump on everybody, $80 million the\nbenefit of which was conferred by the Commission and\nthe compact and the sister States that were a part of\n--\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But, Mr. Phillips, I\nreally don't quite understand a part of your\nargument. I'm not sure what happened to the $80\nmillion, and I guess you aren't, either. And if in\nfact -- and maybe it was -- they had in good faith\nused that money to try and complete the facility and\nthen decided it's just not worth it, would you still\nbe entitled to get the 80 million back?\nMR. PHILLIPS: I -- I think if -- it would\nbe a tougher case if they had taken the 80 million\nand come to the conclusion of this and there was a\nfinding by the State authorities that this facility\nsimply cannot be built consistent with health and\nsafety. I think that would be an argument that we\nare not entitled to the money back.\nBut what I think you are not entitled to\ndo, as North Carolina, is to decide unilaterally that\nmore money should be paid, which is not provided for\nunder the agreement, and insist on that as a\ncondition of fulfilling any of its responsibilities\nunder the agreement.\nJUSTICE ALITO: What is your position --\nwhat do you say that the States contemplated\nregarding the financing of these -- of these\nprojects? That the State that was unfortunate enough\nto be selected as the second State would have to pay\nthe full cost, even if it was $200 million, and then\nwould -- how long would it take for that State to get\nthat money back? Would it have to wait until, you\nknow, 80, 100 years later to get the benefit of some\nother State having to finance a project?\nMR. PHILLIPS: No. I mean, well, the\nworking assumption is that the facilities would be in\noperation for 20 years. And the reality, Justice\nAlito, is that once you have one of these facilities\nbuilt, given that there are not very many of them and\nthey are and would be a monopoly within the compact\nregion, you have virtually limited -- unlimited\nauthority to dictate whatever price you want to\nrequire for taking on the disposal. And if you look\nat the sites that exist -- it was true in Barnwell;\nit's certainly true in Utah and in Washington -- I\nmean, those are licenses to print money, essentially,\nat this point. And the expectation --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But in -- but in the --\nMR. PHILLIPS: I'm sorry.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- case of this compact\nand the other ones, as I -- do I understand\ncorrectly, Mr. Phillips, that none of these -- none\nof these compacts that were negotiated around the\nsame time, none of them yielded a disposal -- an\noperative disposal facility?\nMR. PHILLIPS: None so far. Texas I think\nis as -- is as far along in its process as -- as\nanyone, and it's -- and it's part of a compact. But\nyou know, obviously there is a \"not in my backyard\"\nmentality here. But the -- at the end of the day,\nthe fundamental question remains, you know, what --\nwho bears the responsibility?\nNorth Carolina -- it wasn't as though North\nCarolina was the unfortunate recipient of this\nparticular decision and then said, you know, we don't\nwant to do this, we can't pay for this, there's no\nway we can accomplish this. North Carolina, after\nhaving been designated as the host State,\naffirmatively passed legislation accepting that\nresponsibility and committing the State to actually\nproviding for a facility.\nNow, Justice Stevens, I agree, if it had\nturned out that as a matter of public health and\nsafety -- that's the big bugaboo here -- if that had\nbeen an obstacle, or maybe, Justice Sotomayor, if the\nexpense had been so far out of the range of what's\nconceivable, maybe there's an impossibility element\nto it. But the --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could I interrupt just\na moment?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Of course.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Let's assume they\nhadn't taken the 80 million. Let's assume they had\nsunk all of that money themselves --\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- and they looked and\nsaid: It's going to take us another 120 million to\ncomplete this; we just can't. What in the compact\nstopped them from withdrawing? Because the only\nprovision I see in the contract about withdrawing is\nthe one that says once the facility is completed --\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- you have to keep --\nyou have to give notice, four-year notice.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right. The only thing --\nthere is nothing express in the contract, in the\ncompact, that would prevent them from doing that. I\ndo think there is an implied duty of good faith. But\nin the situation you pose, Your Honor, I don't think\nthere's any question that they acted in good faith.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Right, okay. So\nassuming they are acting in good faith, I still don't\nquite understand what the difference is except the\nfact that they took what you've described in other\ncounts as an unjust enrichment. You got us to give\nyou some money to help you along in this project.\nBut the situation hasn't changed. We can't spend\nmore money. We certainly can't spend the amount of\nmoney it will take to complete this project. I'm not\nsure what turns that into bad faith, other than your\nclaim that they --\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, other than -- other\nthan the fact that to say \"We can't\" strikes me as\nutterly implausible. To say \"We don't want to\"\nstrikes me as much more arguable.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, but the\nhypothetical I gave you before you described as good\nfaith: Just too much money.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right. But the problem was\n--\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What turns it into bad\nfaith?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, I think the problem --\nwhat turns it into bad faith is taking the 80\nmillion, consistently committing to going forward\nwith it, and then walking away right before you are\ngoing to get sanctioned for failure to comply with\nthe -- with the agreement. I think those are the\nelements that make it --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Do you have any precedent\nfrom this Court for reading into a contract between\nStates an obligation of good faith?\nMR. PHILLIPS: I don't have any -- any\ndecision of this Court. I do have an opinion by the\nD.C. Circuit some years ago that says that every\ncontract carries with it an implied duty of good\nfaith and fair dealing. You may remember that\nopinion.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Then how do you -- what is\n-- is that absolutely necessary? Any party State may\nwithdraw from the compact by enacting a law repealing\nthe compact. That sentence seems to me your toughest\npoint because that's what they did. They simply\nwithdrew.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Now, where in the contract\nis it something that says -- I mean, maybe that was\nfoolish, to put that in there, but they did put it\nin. And so how do you deal with that sentence, which\nis one that Justice Scalia brought up in his --\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, the only -- the only\nargument we have with respect to that -- and it's\nimportant to recognize, we don't have to win this\nissue in order to win the breach of contract claim in\nthis particular case.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well -- all right. Well,\ngo ahead, explain.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, because there's\nmassive repudiation long before the -- the question\nstill is, what do you do with 1997 to 1999? Before\nthey withdraw, they have repudiated the agreement.\nThey have breached it totally. The very essence of\nthe agreement was lost once North Carolina refused to\ntake any steps, much less appropriate steps.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Is there in this implicit\nthat the State of North Carolina, prior to their\nwithdrawal, while they are still acting, will\nappropriate reasonable amounts of money for this?\nMR. PHILLIPS: And take -- well, what they\nare supposed to do is take appropriate steps to\nlicense, which means --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Do appropriate steps\ninclude --\nMR. PHILLIPS: -- continue to do what's\nnecessary to get a license.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- do they -- does this --\nif we have a lend-lease agreement entered into a\ntreaty and absolutely ratified, I suppose that if\nCongress decides not to lend and won't appropriate\nthe money to do it, we are in breach of the treaty.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And I assume if there is a\nsimilar agreement here and North Carolina's\nlegislature doesn't appropriate any money for\nwhatever internal reasons, North Carolina is in\nbreach of the treaty.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Do I understand this\ncorrectly?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Yes, that's absolutely\nright, Justice Breyer.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Is there any authority for\nthe proposition that when a legislature does not\nappropriate the money that the executive of a State\nhas committed to another State, that State is in\nbreach, irrespective of whose fault it is within the\nState?\nMR. PHILLIPS: I don't know that there is\nspecific authority for that proposition. But,\nJustice Breyer, it seems to me what you describe\nthere is exquisitely close to what this -- what this\nCourt resolved in Mobil Oil Exploration, where\nCongress passed a statute saying that the\nadministrative side would not be permitted to go\nforward, and this Court said that action constituted\na repudiation of the underlying obligation, even\nthough it was far from clear that there would ever be\nany exploration or production of oil on this -- on\nthe outer continental shelf sites that were in there.\nThis Court said that when -- that if an\nobligor will commit a breach that would of itself\ngive the obligee a claim for damages for total\nbreach, so that it so substantially impairs the value\nof the contract, and the government said it would\nbreak or did break an important contractual promise,\nimpairing the value of the contract, then the\ngovernment must give the companies back the money.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay. So this case then\nboils down to, am I correct, in the years prior to\ntheir withdrawal, did they take the steps,\nappropriate steps, that this contract obliges them to\nmake?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Yes, I think that's a fair\n-\nJUSTICE BREYER: And you say they did not?\nMR. PHILLIPS: But we have other arguments,\nobviously, but then -- but on the breach --\nJUSTICE BREYER: But that's -- but if you\nwin on that one, you win.\nMR. PHILLIPS: -- we should win. In my\njudgment, that's -- the conduct of North Carolina\nbetween 1997 and 1999 is exactly the same conduct\nthat the United States entered into in Mobil\nExploration.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And the state of the\nfinding of the Commission in respect to that precise\npoint, and it's called -- what is it called? The\n\"Impact Commission\"? Do we have the same thing in\nmind, the Commission? Is that what it's called?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Yes, it's a --\nJUSTICE BREYER: They have -- they are the\nones who are the judge, it says.\nMR. PHILLIPS: I believe that they are the\nsole judge, yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. That's what it\nsays.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Article 7(C).\nJUSTICE BREYER: The findings in respect to\nthat specific 2-year point are what, and where are\nthey in the record?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Okay. That's in the -- that\nwill be in the sanctions order that's in the\nappendix, so that -- in the record. I think it's\naround page 400. I will get that for you, Justice\nBreyer.\nBut the specific finding is that North\nCarolina had a duty to go forward and -- and stopped\ncompletely. It repudiated.\nIn addition to that, when North Carolina\nannounced that it was shutting down the project and\nthat it was not going forward, that it was just going\nto run out and wait and hope, frankly, that\nadditional funding would come forward, the -- the\ncompact -- the director of the compact specifically\nwrote to the governor twice, saying: These are acts\nin repudiation and in violation of the agreement; it\nis your responsibility.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But they also -- you\nsaid -- you said in your brief that the -- in 1997,\nthe Commission came forward with some kind of\nadditional funding proposal, which North Carolina\ncame down -- turned down.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Refused, right.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What -- what was that?\nMR. PHILLIPS: The basic proposal -- the\ndraft memorandum of understanding would have -- would\nhave led to the Commission providing, I think, about\n$21 million, and the generators in the Southeast\nStates providing a loan to North Carolina of an\nadditional -- I think it was $13 million. And that\ngets you the $34 million -- comes from -- for the --\nfor the finalized elements of getting a license put\nin place. So we had -- you know, we thought we had\nin place an offer to fund. I mean, that's what makes\nNorth Carolina --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Why did -- why did North\nCarolina turn it down?\nMR. PHILLIPS: You might want to ask Mr.\nDellinger that question. They didn't -- they didn't\nprovide us with any explanation for why they didn't\n- why they turned that down.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But you say there was a\npackage, that there was a -- an offer in place where\nthe Commission would pay X and the generators would\nkick in an additional amount as well.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right. And that would have\nbeen a loan for the future.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And that was -- that --\neverybody had signed -- everybody who was part of\nthat offer had signed onto it?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right. Everybody on our\nside had agreed to that, including the -- the other\nmembers of the compact.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why did they agree to it?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Because the --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Once again, they are just\ntender-hearted? I mean, even though North Carolina\nhad an obligation to fund all of it? They just come\nforward and say: Yes, extort us. I mean, I --\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, you know, when you --\nwhen you've got the power to extort, you know, the\ntemptation to go down that path, Justice Scalia, is\nobviously pretty strong. And the reason they did it\nwas --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I suggest it's not the\npower to extort; it's the power to withdraw. And\nthat power to withdraw suggests that there is no\nabsolute obligation to come up with the funding. The\ntwo seem to me so -- so inconsistent with -- with one\nanother.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, the difficulty --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So long as you can\nwithdraw at any time --\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right. But remember, you\nare talking now also about the Commission and the\nother compact States having sunk $80 million in the\ninvestment to get this site up and running. So we've\n-- I mean, we've already got $80 million in the hole.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Would your position\nbe the -- be the same if it were $20 million?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Yes, our position would be\nexactly the same.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So whatever the\nCommission contributed? In other words, it doesn't\nhave to be enough to trigger an obligation on the\npart of North Carolina to move forward. I assume\nthere is some level where you would say, you know,\nthey took their chances, and it didn't work out -- as\nopposed to they obviously committed in light of the\nmoney they accepted.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, I think the answer to\nyour question is -- you know, of course, is: What's\nthe appropriate remedy for the particular breach in\nany given case? In this context, if we were talking\nabout a couple thousand dollars --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, I don't think\nso. I think it's a question of whether there's a\nbreach. I would say that if you gave them $1\nmillion, you should not view that as: Well, we've\nsupported your efforts; you are committed to do this,\nno matter how much it costs, because we have given\nyou $1 million.\nIt seems to me at some point the amount\nbecomes pertinent in assessing whether you have a\nclaim.\nMR. PHILLIPS: But I -- well, I think the\nultimate question is still: What is the obligation?\nAnd Justice Breyer identified it, I think, quite\nprecisely. And again, this is only with respect to\ncount 2 in that breach claim.\nBut our argument there is that they had a\nresponsibility from December 1997 until July of 1999\nto take appropriate steps. And they massively\nrepudiated that obligation and repudiated the\nentirety of --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: My -- my problem\nremains --\nMR. PHILLIPS: -- of the contract.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- with that answer, is\nthat you earlier said that they could -- forgetting\nif they didn't take any money -- under the terms of\nthis compact -- and Justice Scalia has been noting\nthis repeatedly -- have withdrawn at any time because\nthey didn't want to sink any more money into this\nproject; is that correct?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Yes. Subject to what I\nwould think was a duty of good faith, they could have\ndone that. But they didn't do that.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, let's put aside\nthat duty of good faith --\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- because with that\nduty of good faith, you're suggesting that merely\nbecause they took a million -- that's what the Chief\nJustice is asking you -- or 80 million, that that\nsomehow converted or changed the express terms of the\ncontract and bound them in some way to find funding\nthat they chose not to. That -- that's really the\nargument I'm hearing you make.\nMR. PHILLIPS: No, I think it's more subtle\nthan that, Justice Sotomayor. I mean, my point is\nthey always had an obligation to take appropriate\nsteps to get licensed. That was an obligation that\nlasted until they withdrew. And from -- from\nDecember 1997 on, they refused to take any steps\ntoward getting a license. And we don't know today\nwhether something could have happened in that year\nand a half that might have changed the entire dynamic\nof this and allowed it to in fact be completed in a\nway that all of the parties would have been satisfied\nwith.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: May I ask you just one\nquestion on the sovereign immunity issue?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Of course.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Is there any factual\ndevelopment that needs to occur before the Special\nMaster to address the legal questions that have been\npresented? And I see the legal questions as whether\nor not, in fact, the claim belongs to the Commission\nor to the States for the $80 million and the $10\nmillion in lost revenue.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Is there any factual\ndevelopment that needs to occur, or is that a pure\nlegal question based on the arguments that are\ncontained in the briefs before us?\nMR. PHILLIPS: I think it's a pure legal\nargument. I think we have put forward everything\nbefore the Special Master that we think is relevant\nfor the -- for a disposition of that --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: What is there in the\nrecord that shows that the claims of the States are\nidentical to the claim the Commission is asserting,\nwhich was the -- which was the instance in the\nArizona-California case?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right. The bill of\ncomplaint itself doesn't distinguish between claims\nbased on any particular party. They list the parties\nand they list the claims, and there is no effort to\nmix and match as between them. In terms --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: It seems to me that it's\nthe obligation of the Commission to show that there\nis an absolute parallel between the claims. And I\njust don't see where I can infer from the record or\nconclude that that is the case. And if -- and if\nthat is not so, then the Commission is not like the\nIndian tribes in the Arizona case.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, I would think at a\nminimum we are very much like the private oil\ncompanies in the Maryland v. Louisiana case, in any\nevent, where, you know, the claims were out there; it\nwas far from clear exactly how those claims were\ngoing to play out in one way or another. And this\nCourt didn't sit down and say: We have to sort that\nout ahead of going forward with the litigation. What\nthe Court said was: These all look to be pretty\nclose and there's no basis on which to assume that\nthey are doing more -- that they are asking for more,\nand therefore there's no Eleventh Amendment problem.\nAnd, of course, remember the Special Master\nhas held open the possibility that if for some reason\nthe claims of the Commission were to deviate from the\nclaims of -- of any of the compact States, which as\nfar as I can tell to this point they have -- they\nhave not deviated one iota, then the Special Master\nwould allow North Carolina to revisit -- to renew its\nmotion at that point.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But isn't there an\nobligation before we exercise original jurisdiction\nto ensure that there is at least a potential viable\nclaim by the States that they have a cause of action?\nI mean, that then becomes a legal question. Is the\ncompact -- is the Commission an agent?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Do the States own these\nrevenues?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You are suggesting that\n--\nMR. PHILLIPS: But that -- it seems to me,\nJustice Sotomayor, what you are doing there is\ncollapsing the question on the merits into the\njurisdictional issue of --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But we do that all the\ntime, for example, with -- with sovereign immunity.\nWe --\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: We tell district courts\nwhen there is a sovereign immunity issue, do the --\nwhatever discovery you need on the question, but\naddress it, because it's jurisdictional.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right. Although --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: There has to be a basis\nfor the claim.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right. Although this --\nthis Court has also recognized in Georgia v. United\nStates, for instance, that if -- if there are clearly\nclaims that exist, that are legitimately litigable,\nnotwithstanding the Eleventh Amendment, and there may\nbe some question about others, that the Court\nnevertheless should go forward and figure out --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm not -- I'm not --\nMR. PHILLIPS: -- which ones work and which\nones don't.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I don't question that\nthe States may have some legitimate claims. The\nquestion is do they have legitimate claims to what\nthe Commission is seeking. I think that's the\nquestion.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right. And I think the\nanswer to that is -- just as the Special Master said,\nit's premature to try to judge that until we get to a\npoint in the litigation where it becomes clear that\nthere is some departure between what the States are\ndoing and what the Commission is doing.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I am conscious of\nyour white light, but it does seem to me --\nMR. PHILLIPS: I get --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- that the Commission is\n-- is asking for the money for itself.\nMR. PHILLIPS: No, the Commission is asking\nfor the money on behalf of the -- of the compact\nStates, and the compact States are asking for the\nmoney on their own behalf. I do think it's an easier\nvehicle for the Court to be able to provide a remedy\nby giving money under these circumstances.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.\nPhillips.\nMr. Kneedler.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES\nAS AMICUS CURIAE,\nIN SUPPORT OF NEITHER PARTY\nMR. KNEEDLER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may\nit please the Court:\nThe United States has participated in this\ncase both, at the Court's invitation, at the motion\nfor leave to file stage and then before the Special\nMaster, primarily on the issues that were addressed\nin the Special Master's preliminary report, which go\nto questions of the assertion of Eleventh Amendment\nimmunity in original actions as well as the structure\nof the compact and the compact's power to assess\nmonetary sanctions itself.\nToday we make two principal arguments:\none, that the Court should deny North Carolina's\nmotion to dismiss the Commission as a party,\nrejecting at this time or for the time being the\nassertion of Eleventh Amendment immunity; and second,\nthat the Court should deny the claim that the\nCommission has the power itself to impose monetary\nsanctions under article 7(F).\nThat's not to say that the States party may\nnot seek monetary relief, appropriate monetary\nrelief, themselves in an original action in this\nCourt. It's only to say that the compact Commission\nis not a forum established by the compact itself,\nwhich is not only a compact between the States, but\nan Act of Congress, to do that.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Can I ask you, what is\nthe policy advantage of the rule you are proposing\nwith respect to the first question, the joinder of\nthe Commission in this original action, of us\nproceeding to answer substantive questions about the\ninterpretation of the compact, et cetera, without\naddressing initially the right of the Commission to\nbring this action as an original action at all?\nIt seems to be putting the cart before the\nhorse, or -- because I'm not sure why we should be\nreaching the merits, deciding the merits, before\nidentifying which are the parties and what claims\nthey have before us.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, I -- I, think, as Mr.\nPhillips suggested, this Court's decision in -- in\nthe United States v. Georgia establishes the Court is\nnot required to, and in some circumstances it -- it\nmay be possible to dispose of the case on -- on the\nmerits because the plaintiff States in this case I\nthink undoubtedly have a cause --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But this one won't.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, the plaintiff States\nundoubtedly have a cause of action for breach of the\ncompact. They are parties to the compact, and as\nparties to the compact, they can bring an action\nwhether or not the Commission is properly before --\nbefore the Court. And the question of whether the --\nNorth Carolina violated the compact therefore can be\nadjudicated solely on the basis of -- of the\nplaintiff States' claim, without having to reach the\nquestion of -- of whether the Commission could\nproperly be made a party.\nIf this Court were to agree with the\nSpecial Master that there was no violation of the\ncompact, then the question of whether the Commission\ncould be -- could also bring that claim and what --\nwhat remedy there might be for that, either to the\nStates or to the Commission, would never have to be\n- to be reached. So there is, I think, some\nefficiency with -- with respect to that.\nBut on the Eleventh Amendment question --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Do we have -- Mr.\nKneedler --\nMR. KNEEDLER: I'm sorry.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Kneedler, do we have\nany decision that deals with the standing of a\ncommission to sue a State in its own right? Or this\nis a novel question?\nMR. KNEEDLER: This is -- this is a novel\nquestion as -- as far as I -- as far as I am aware.\nAnd -- and that may be one reason why the Court would\nprefer not to specifically address the question. But\nI -- but I do think on the -- on the basic principles\nof Eleventh Amendment immunity, that this Court's\ndecision in Arizona v. California, at least at this\nstage of the case, is dispositive. Because there the\nCourt concluded that the States -- because the United\nStates had intervened, they had no assertion of\nEleventh Amendment immunity with respect to the\nsubject matter of the dispute. As the Court put it,\nthe tribes are not bringing any new claims or issues\nbefore the Court, and therefore the judicial power of\nthis Court would not be enlarged and the State's\nsovereign immunity would not be compromised by the\nIndian tribes' participation in the case.\nWe think that's an important principle, at\nleast with respect to Indian tribes, who this Court\nrecognized in Arizona --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But here the Commission\nis seeking sums for itself. What assurance do we\nhave that the Commission, if it received the money,\nwould give it back to the States exactly in the ratio\nthe States demand it?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, I -- I don't think the\nCourt --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I -- I think it's their\nobligation to show the complete parallel between --\nbetween the claims, and that that has not been done.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, two things about that.\nIn Maryland v. Louisiana, which was a suit brought by\na number of States to challenge a -- a Louisiana tax\non Commerce Clause grounds, that case went forward on\nthe suit of the -- of those States, but the natural\ngas companies who paid the tax were permitted to\nintervene, and the Court did that, notwithstanding\nthe Eleventh Amendment. Surely, the claim of the\nStates parens patriae was not identical to the claims\nof the individual natural gas companies to get a\nrefund on their own behalf, but the Court nonetheless\nallowed them to intervene, and the Court's judgment\nin this case awarded -- required the State of\nLouisiana to make refunds to -- to all taxpayers.\nSo I -- I don't think -- especially in an\noriginal action where the State has a certain parens\npatriae responsibility, I don't think that the claims\nhave to be identical in the precise way that they\nwere in -- in Arizona v. California.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Kneedler, can I ask\nyou sort of a basic question about the Eleventh\nAmendment argument? You -- you framed it entirely in\nterms of the Eleventh Amendment, but is there not\nalso a common law immunity that the States can plead\nagainst non-sovereigns?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Yes, although I -- I think\n- I think -- I don't know whether this falls within\nthe precise terms of the Eleventh Amendment. It\nwould depend on whether the compact Commission is\nregarded as a citizen of another State, which I think\nit would not be. But, yes, it would be the -- the\nprinciple recognized in Alden. But I -- the\nprinciples that I am describing here I think would\napply equally to that immunity, as they would to the\nother --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Why is it -- to go back to\nthe word \"sanctions,\" when I read the word\n\"sanctions\" in the law, the thing that comes to my\nmind first and foremost is the money, like a fine;\nand sort of second, imprisonment. But paying a fine,\nthat -- that seems to me the most primitive and basic\nsanction of anything. And -- and why -- and\nparticularly, if you say the fine was limited to\ngiving back money you previously took.\nSo, why wouldn't you read this clause here\nwhich says \"including\" -- and then it doesn't mention\nmoney, but it includes some other things, and you say\nwell, sure, they include the other things because the\nword \"sanction\" doesn't automatically call to mind\nthose other things, but it does automatically call to\nmind a fine.\nMR. KNEEDLER: There -- there are several\npoints that I think are important to bear in mind\nwith this. I think this Court has always recognized\nthat monetary liability on the part of a State is\ndistinct from prospective relief, and I think the\nCourt should not lightly assume that States have\nagreed to have a nonjudicial forum, like a --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Now, are we supposed to --\nare we supposed to treat compacts among States as if\nwe are dealing with those who want to impose\nobligations on the States?\nMR. KNEEDLER: No, but --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Here, aren't we trying to\nsay what obligations did the States themselves want\nto impose on themselves?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Yes, and as we point out in\npages 26 and 27 of our -- of our brief, there were\nthree -- it's actually four compacts that were\nadopted or approved in the very same Act of Congress\nwhich specifically provide for monetary sanctions --\nor monetary -- monetary remedies, which shows that\nthe compacting parties knew how to do it when they\nwanted to.\nBut beyond that, I think it's important to\nlook at the overall structure of article 7, where the\nsanctions power appears. First of all, article 7(F),\nwhich is on page 19a of the blue brief, refers to any\nparty State which fails to comply, et cetera, \"may be\nsubject to sanctions, including suspension of rights\nunder the compact and revocation.\"\nThose are all forward-looking sanctions.\nBut -- but I think what really reinforces that is if\nyou look at the title of article 7, which is on page\n17a, it says -- it deals with eligible parties,\nwithdrawal, revocation, entry into force, and\ntermination. Article 7 is all about membership in\nthe -- in the Commission. The Commission's powers,\nby contrast, are set out in article 4 of the -- of\nthe compact. There are enumerated powers there and,\nfor example, article 4(E)(11), on page 11a -- the\nonly enumerated power with respect to sanctions\nthere, at the bottom of 11a, is to revoke the\nmembership of a party State in accordance with\narticle 7(F).\nOne would think, if there -- if there was\nan extraordinary power to grant monetary sanctions,\nthat it would have appeared in the enumerated powers,\nand in fact, in the one compact adopted at the same\ntime that provides for imposition of fines, it\nactually appears in the enumerated powers portion of\nthe relevant compact, not in the membership.\nAnd, Justice Breyer, you asked about\nsection -- article 7(C), with respect to the power of\nthe Commission to be the judge of -- of certain\nmatters. I think it's pretty clear that what that's\ndriving at is the Commission being the judge of the\nqualifications of the -- of the States and the\nmembers of the Commission appointed by the States to\nparticipate.\nIt's like the power of any legislative\nbody, the power of Congress to determine the\nqualifications of someone who's about -- who has been\nvoted in, should that person be seated. I think\narticle 7(C) is directed at that, not at some power\nof --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, it adds -- it adds\n- it starts \"Qualifications.\" It says it's the judge\nof qualification and it's the judge of their\ncompliance with the conditions and requirements of\nthis compact.\nMR. KNEEDLER: But if you continue -- \"And\nthe laws\" --\nJUSTICE BREYER: \"And the laws of the\nStates relating to the enactment of the compact.\"\nMR. KNEEDLER: Right, but -- but -- the --\nthe laws of the parties -- if I may finish?\n\"The laws of the parties State,\" the final\nphrase relating to the enactment of the compact, I\nthink would modify the qualifications -- compliance\nwith the conditions and requirements of the compact\nwith respect to membership.\nAgain, I think that comes from the first\npart of article 7(C), but I think it's -- it's the\noverall thrust of article 7 that it deals with\nmembership.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.\nKneedler.\nMr. Dellinger.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF WALTER DELLINGER\nON BEHALF OF THE DEFENDANT\nMR. DELLINGER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may\nit please the Court:\nI think I should begin with a simple\nquestion that my grandson asked me, which is why did\nNorth Carolina quit? Which I think sheds light on\nwhat its obligations were and what the understanding\nwas.\nThis is a compact. It is not based upon a\ncoercive model. You could have one, where States --\nall the States are required to remain in the compact,\nwithdrawal is a nullity, the Commission can enforce\nfinancial sanctions, and the compact members waive\nsovereign immunity and can be sued in Federal court.\nThis compact is based on a consensual\nmodel, where it -- each -- each State can withdraw,\nand therefore the compact has to be in the rough\nfinancial interest of each of the States at any point\nin time, which is what --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You took -- you\ntook $80 million, and they got nothing for it. That\nwould be a question your grandson might ask.\n(Laughter.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What did you do\nwith the $80 million?\nMR. DELLINGER: The $80 million came from\n- not the State -- the statement that the States gave\nNorth Carolina $80 million and North Carolina has\nkept it and didn't give it back is a shorthand that\nis misleading in every single respect.\nThe funds, of course, didn't come from the\nStates. They contributed $25,000 apiece. It came\nfrom charges on generators from all over the country.\nThe funds went to the authority established under\nNorth Carolina law and could only be used for the\npurposes of the Low-Level Waste Authority, and indeed\nthey all were used for the purposes of the Low-Level\nWaste Authority.\nThe master assumes that -- that all --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How did that help the\nother compacting States, giving them the $80 million\nand North Carolina walking away?\nMR. DELLINGER: Well, Justice Sotomayor, no\none was helped by this process or the process of the\nother compacts, none of which resulted in a -- in a\nfacility. But what North Carolina did was to carry\nout its responsibilities to take appropriate steps\nand, as I will show in a moment, fully in accord with\nthe understanding of the Commission and North\nCarolina, that they would be -- it would be jointly\nfinanced, even though the Commission had no legal\nobligation. But the key reason --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm hard-pressed to\nunderstand where that comes from. Under the terms of\nthe contract -- the compact, the compact expressly\nsays that none of the contracting States have any\nliabilities with respect to this --\nMR. DELLINGER: That is correct, and it\nsays that the Commission does not have any legal\nobligation --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Exactly.\nMR. DELLINGER: -- under the compact to\nfund it, either. But it was because this is a\nconsensual compact and because of the right to\nwithdrawal, as the master noted, it would have been\nsurprising if a facility were constructed without\nsignificant assistance from the States that were not\nthe host State because of the right to withdraw, and\nthat indeed was recognized from the very beginning.\nFor example, in 1996, when the -- the\nchairman of the Commission was hoping to speed up the\ncompletion, the chairman noted that the opening of a\nnew regional facility in North Carolina would ensure\na source of revenues for site development in the\nthird host State.\nIndeed, it's not surprising that, from the\nbeginning of the compact, the Commission provided a\nsubstantial amount of the funding because North\nCarolina could have withdrawn at any point. And the\nCommission repeatedly recognized that it was, quote,\n\"necessary and appropriate and reasonable and\nequitable\" for the Commission to contribute to this.\nMr. Phillips cites the North Carolina\nlegislation -- the North Carolina legislation, which\nnotes that, among the Commission's -- the authority's\ncorporate powers, when it sets up the authority or\nthe financing -- but the North Carolina legislation,\nas the Commission expressly recognized and cited in\nproviding the money, provides that North Carolina may\naccept funds from its general assembly. The North\nCarolina authority may accept funds from the North\nCarolina general assembly, from the Commission\ncompact, from other States, from the Federal\nGovernment, or from generators. And they begin to\nsay it's necessary and appropriate.\nAt every step, they -- the Commission says\nthat in -- in February of '88, October of '89,\nSeptember of '92, November of '92, \"reasonable and\nequitable to provide this funding,\" and of course it\nmakes sense, given the consensual nature of the\ncompact.\nSo, what happened? Why did North Carolina\nquit? What happened was, because of the right to\nwithdraw, South Carolina withdrew in 1995. When\nSouth Carolina withdrew, this of course deprived the\nCommission of a ready source of funding from the fees\nthat were being paid to the facility in Barnwell,\nSouth Carolina.\nBut much -- or of equal significance is the\nfact that South Carolina, having withdrawn, no longer\nhad to comply with the compact requirement, that\nSouth Carolina ceased operating a facility on\nDecember 31, 1992.\nWhy was that important? Because the\ncompact creates, as Mr. Phillips noted, something\nlike a monopoly within the region, and when you are\nfinancing the facility you know, if you are the\nfinancing authority, that you will have a captive\nmarket --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay. I see. So --\nMR. DELLINGER: Unless -- unless States can\nwithdraw.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So I was thinking of this,\nis: What we have are a group of States, each of whom\nfeels it's necessary to build a cholera plant. And\nthey know that the cholera plant will be hated by\neverybody in their State, but it's necessary. So\nthey each say: We'll undertake it, okay? But the\ndeal is you do, too. Now, that's their basic deal.\nI don't know that they ever would have\nentered into this as part of the basic deal that\nState A depends for 4 years on State B doing it, but\nwhen it's State A's turn, they run away. Well,\nthat's the deal. They can run away. But in\naddition, take $80 million? Okay. That's where we\nare back with the Chief's question.\nNow, I don't know whether it is an\nappropriate step or not an appropriate step to keep\nthe 80 million as well as running away. But it seems\nto me that we have an arbitrator that was supposed to\ndecide whether it was or whether it wasn't, and they\nsaid it was an appropriate step. They foresaw you\nwould take the 80 million, never give it back, at\nleast.\nBut the Commission thinks it isn't. And\nthe arbitrator paid no attention whatsoever to the\nCommission. And what the Commission says in the\nlanguage that I quoted is that the Commission is the\njudge of the members' compliance with the\nrequirements of this contract. So when I read that,\nI think: Surely, he should have paid some attention\nto the fact that the Commission thought that what was\nkeeping the 80 million was not an appropriate step.\nNow, there we are. That's my question.\nAnd the only answer I've heard so far is, if I read\nthe rest of the sentence, it talks about laws of\nStates relating to the enactment of this contract --\ncompact. And I don't know that you read \"enactment\"\nso narrowly to refer to laws that talked about how\nyou adopt it. There might be a whole lot of laws. I\nguess you pay attention to all of them. So I don't\nsee what the last phrase has to do with it. But\nanyway, that's my basic question in the case.\nMR. DELLINGER: All right. I'll -- I'll\nanswer them in reverse order: The keeping the 80\nmillion and the Commission's judgment about that.\nTheir argument is either that, you know, the\nCommission is somehow the sole judge of these issues\nor that there's some -- that you should treat a State\nas something like a regulated industry under an\nagency model. And they -- and they point to 7(C), or\nat least the part of 7(C) that they leave in their\nquote, as establishing that. And what I think Mr.\nKneedler was attempting to say when his time ran out\nis that, if you just read 7(C), it's about\nmembership.\n7(C) is in a five-provision sequence: (A),\n(B), (C), (D), and (E). (A) lists the initial State\nmembers; (B) says how other States can become\nmembers; (D) provides that the first three States\nwhich enact and pay their fees will bring the compact\ninto existence. And (E) states that members of other\ncompacts are not eligible for membership.\nThen (C), in the middle, says that each\nState shall be declared a party State upon payment of\nthe fees and enactment, and the Commission is the\njudge of the qualifications of the party States and\nof its members and their compliance with the\nconditions and requirements of the compact -- and if\nI may go \"dot, dot, dot\" -- relating to the enactment\nof this compact.\nNow, that phrase \"relating to the\nenactment\" might refer just to the preceding phrase\nabout laws of the party States. But Mr. Kneedler and\nI both read it more naturally in the context of the\nCommission as judge, that this is about how you judge\nwho's a member. It is, in that sense, like the House\nof Representatives provision they quote, except it\ndoesn't say \"sole judge.\"\nJUSTICE BREYER: So, in your opinion, the\nCommission is not the judge of anything other than\nmembership?\nMR. DELLINGER: Not with --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So, therefore, the six\npages or so of this compact that has to do with a lot\nof detailed issues that might appear before the\nCommission -- it is not the judge of whether there is\ncompliance with those issues --\nMR. DELLINGER: With respect to -- with\nrespect to --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- because this concerns\nonly membership?\nMR. DELLINGER: With respect to parties to\nthe compact, the Commission, of course, has to\ninterpret the compact when it engages in its sanction\nauthority. If it's going to sanction a State that is\nblocking the transmit of other States, it has to\ninterpret what it is applying.\nI think what the -- counsel is arguing that\nit was entitled to some special deference, and what\nthe master is saying is: Given the right to\nwithdraw, why should North Carolina -- why should it\nbe allowed any deference over a determination by the\nState that's not a party to the compact? It was not\nrequired to -- not a party to -- at that point, to\nthe compact.\nNow, I do want to answer your question\nabout North Carolina keeping the money, because this\nis important. Where --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Before you get to that --\nMR. DELLINGER: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: While we are on 7(C), I'm\nnot clear on how you are reading that last section.\nIs the last phrase -- \"relating to the enactment of\nthis compact\" -- is it your position that that phrase\nis joined not only with the immediately preceding\nwords -- \"the laws of the party States\" relating to\nthe enactment of this compact -- but that it also\nrefers back to compliance with the conditions and\nrequirements of this compact relating to the\nenactment of this compact?\nMR. DELLINGER: Yes, I am. And that's not\ngrammatically compelled; it is permitted.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It certainly isn't\ngrammatically compelled, but does it make any sense?\nMR. DELLINGER: Yes, it does.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Conditions and\nrequirements relating to the enactment of the\ncompact?\nMR. DELLINGER: Yes. This is about -- it's\nnot very beautifully done, but it's about the\nCommission judging who becomes a member. In (A),\n(B), (C), (D), and (E), and as Mr. Kneedler noted, in\nthe other compacts that were based on a model, this\n- the seventh article is all about eligibility for\nmembership. The powers and sanctions and parts are\nelsewhere in the compact.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Are you relying on the\ncaption to article 7 -- \"Eligible Parties;\nWithdrawal; Revocation; Entry into Force;\nTermination\"? The caption to article 7?\nMR. DELLINGER: Yes. And it's -- it's also\ncaptions about that subject.\nBut if I may return to the question of\nwho's got the money: The $80 million coming from\nfees generated by users around the country went\nthrough the Commission to the authority. It was set\nup in a special separate account just for the\npurposes of the authority. All of the funds were\nexpended over this process of a massive amount of\nstudies that were done. Not a penny of it could ever\nbe spent by the North Carolina General Assembly for\nany purposes whatsoever.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Dellinger, what of\n- what of Mr. Phillips's argument that that $80\nmillion gave North Carolina a leg up, should there\never be any revival of the development of a disposal\nfacility; North Carolina is much better situated than\nanyone else to do this, because they have already\nsunk $80,000 into pursuing a license?\nMR. DELLINGER: Well, it has been 10 or 12\nyears since this occurred, Justice Ginsburg, and\nthere has been no effort and no plan in North\nCarolina to build a facility, and to begin the\nlicensing process anew. Some of the information they\n-- the authority retained, which would be of use to\nthe Commission anywhere, whether there is any site\nspecific information that would still be good 15 or\n20 years out, I think is just pure speculation.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Take a hypothetical case\nwhere North Carolina did have a real advantage and\nthey used the money to create a facility, would that\nbear on the unjust enrichment claim or even the\nsanctions claim?\nMR. DELLINGER: Yes. It might well bear on\nthe unjust enrichment, if there was, you know, an\nenrichment. What happened here is that the North\nCarolina General Assembly appropriated money that\nwent to the authority. Properly considered, North\nCarolina -- the Commission provided money to the\nauthority. The North Carolina General Assembly\nprovided money for the authority. All the funds were\nspent. The only State that contributed money to this\nprocess was North Carolina, and North Carolina\ncontributed $34 million.\nNow, why did they -- I think one of the\nmost useful documents we have is in the --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I just want -- you said\nthe only State that contributed money to the\nCommission was North Carolina? I just want to make\nsure I heard that right.\nMR. DELLINGER: Every State contributed\n$25,000 --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: That's it?\nMR. DELLINGER: -- to sign up.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Right.\nMR. DELLINGER: But aside from that, North\nCarolina General Assembly appropriated $34 million to\nthe North Carolina authority, the -- the waste\ndisposal authority. They were the only State to do\nso.\nSo 80 million had come from the fees\ngenerated at Barnwell, 34 million from North\nCarolina, and the -- what happened was -- once South\nCarolina withdrew from the compact, was liberated\nfrom this obligation to close, was announcing that it\nwas now going to continue and is open to the world,\nthey had a cost advantage and a location advantage\nover North Carolina.\nSo in -- in 1996, the joint supplemental\nfact brief at -- appendix at page 143, is where the\nhead of the North Carolina authority writes to the\nhead of the Commission and notes that, with the\nwithdrawal of South Carolina and their decision to\ncontinue the operation at Barnwell, the financing\noptions have been substantially changed.\nUnder the current compact, any State can\nwithdraw up until the North Carolina facility becomes\noperational. With an available alternative disposal\nfacility now in South Carolina, there is no assurance\nto potential bondholders or financiers that there\nwill be a revenue stream from which to repay any\nindebtedness. Therefore, the authority is in a\nposition where the intended vehicles for financing\nare no longer possible.\nOne possibility is to modify the compact to\npreclude withdrawal from the compact, once the\nlicense is issued for the North Carolina facility,\nand that would -- such an amendment would allow --\nfuture use of the facility would be assured, and\nrevenue financing could be considered.\nIt was not practical to submit that to all\nseven of the other -- all seven legislatures and to\nCongress, but the other problem is it would not have\n-- its -- its passage would, by no means, have been\nassured. The States, at that moment, could either\nstay in or go.\nSo North Carolina is faced, after South\nCarolina's withdrawal, with the prospect of advancing\n-- trying to advance bonds for another, at minimum,\n$75 million for construction costs, which would bring\nthe whole project up to 223 million, close to a\nquarter of a billion dollars, and with now a South\nCarolina facility that is closer to every State in\nthe compact, except Virginia, and where, because it\nwas built in 1981, it has a competitive cost\nadvantage.\nSo why is Georgia going to stay in the\ncompact, when it has what may be a -- a less costly\nand less distant alternative in going to Barnwell,\nSouth Carolina?\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, why -- why would\nanyone stay in the contract? I take it that your\npoint, which is an awfully good one, is that this\ncompact was designed, like others, to solve a\npolitical problem.\nIt's necessary for the country to store\nlow-level radioactive waste, necessary for health and\nsafety, but because of the politics and people's\nunderstanding, incomplete, no one wants it, and so,\nnow, the States have formed a series of compacts.\nAnd we are told, in an amicus brief, that,\nif this compact is interpreted to allow one State to\ntake advantage of another State's having done so for\nyears and then run away and keep $80 million to boot,\nit will be impossible for many other States to resist\nthat same route.\nAnd that will be the end of compacts\nthrough the United States, and what we will have is\nlow-level waste without storage. That's argument,\nroughly, that's made in an amicus brief in this case,\nand I would like to know your opinion.\nMR. DELLINGER: My response to that is that\nthe amicus' suggestion that a decision for North\nCarolina would impair the very useful mechanism of\ninterstate compacts has it exactly backwards.\nStates establishing compacts remain\nentirely free to include or add provisions limiting\nthe right to withdraw; permitting the imposition of\nsanctions, including financial sanctions; imposing\nthose on States that are no longer members; defining\nwhether the limits will be a million dollars or a\nhundred million for what they will impose -- or no\nlimits at all; and, as the Central Compact did,\nrequiring a waiver of sovereign immunity so that\nthese judgments can be enforced in Federal court.\nAll that's possible.\nBut a decision in -- whether or not you\ndecide for North Carolina, if that's what you want in\na compact, you can have that compact, and nothing in\na decision for North Carolina would change that.\nA decision in favor of North Carolina\nwould, in fact, benefit the compacting process\nbecause it would provide assurances to State\nlegislators that you can pick up a copy of the\nproposed compact and read it and know that that is\nthe extent of the liabilities to which you are\nimposing your -- exposing your State, and that is the\nlimit of the obligations you are taking on to --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: In this case -- in this\ncase, how did it come about that the right to\nwithdraw any time until the second plant was\noperable, was that -- that was North Carolina's\nproposal after it was designated to be the site?\nMR. DELLINGER: Justice Ginsburg, the\noriginal compact had no limits whatsoever on\nwithdrawal, and when North Carolina was chosen as the\nsite, it proposed, as a necessary condition to its\nnot -- not withdrawing, that the compact be admitted\nto add a provision, 7(H), which would say that after\n-- 30 days after the second facility becomes\noperational, no State may withdraw without the\nconsent of all the other States.\nSo North -- North Carolina added a\nlimitation on the -- at their behest, a limitation on\nthe right to withdraw. When South Carolina pulled\nout, it was clear that that limitation on the right\nto withdrawal wasn't good enough because it meant\nthat States could withdraw at any time up until the\nnew facility became operational, in which case it was\ngoing to be too late.\nIf they pulled out then and went to -- to\nBarnwell, that made it unbondable because there's no\nguarantee -- what made it possible to contemplate\nfinancing this by bonds and by other financing\nmechanisms was the insurance of a market and the\nright to withdraw --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, why didn't you\nwithdraw? I mean, all this is very good. You had\nthat absolute right to withdraw, but you didn't\nwithdraw in -- when was it -- '97. You went on for 2\nyears, still as a member of the compact and still\nsubject to obligations under the compact. How could\nit be said that you were taking all appropriate\nsteps? What is the language -- all --\nMR. DELLINGER: Yes. Appropriate steps --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes.\nMR. DELLINGER: -- to ensure that a license\nis held and obtained.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You took no steps at all.\nYou took zero steps.\nMR. DELLINGER: North --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why didn't you withdraw?\nMR. DELLINGER: Because North Carolina\nhoped that -- and no longer spending 2 million a\nyear, it spent half a million to get -- to keep the\nauthority going, North Carolina kept open the\npossibility that there would be some possible\nfinancing that might allow this project to be\ncompleted.\nThey did not, as Mr. Phillips suggested, I\nthink in error -- they did not have access by staying\nin the compact to the facility at Barnwell, South\nCarolina. South Carolina was -- would close that to\nNorth Carolina, so -- so --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: They had no benefit from\nthe compact for those 2 years?\nMR. DELLINGER: But the steps North\nCarolina took for those last 19 months were exactly\nthe steps that were appropriate. Because they did\nnot have an obligation to fund this at whatever cost\nand because they were willing -- North Carolina's\nwillingness to continue the same ratio of funding\nthat had been a part of the process for the preceding\n8 years was not going to provide the sums necessary\nto complete it, it would have been a waste and a\nsquandering of the money of North Carolina's\ntaxpayers and the Commission to take any steps that\nrequired the expenditure --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you are not arguing\nimpossibility, though. I mean, the other side --\nMR. DELLINGER: No, Justice Scalia. I'm\nnot arguing that it's impossible. What -- what I'm\narguing is that, if North Carolina had continued the\nlevel of funding, about $3 million a year, on -- on\naverage, North Carolina had been contributing; the\nCommission, an average of $7 million had been -- if\nNorth Carolina had contributed that and some -- it\nwould not have come close -- after the withdrawal of\nSouth Carolina, it would not have come close to\nproviding the funds needed to complete the facility.\nTherefore, any funds expended would have\nbeen wasteful and inappropriate.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Dellinger, your\nbrief makes -- I think the reply brief made some\nreference to North Carolina's attempting to get\nfunding from another source after Barnwell -- the\nrevenues from Barnwell were no longer available to\nit.\nI think, in -- in your reply brief, you\nmake some reference to an effort on North Carolina's\npart to get -- what -- what was that effort?\nMR. DELLINGER: Well, the document I cited,\nDecember 13, '96, begins to set out some of the\nproposals. One proposal, for example, was to ask\ngenerators -- major generators to take an equity\nposition in the authority, that the North Carolina\nGeneral Assembly would continue its funding at the\nsame rate it had. Till the last day, North Carolina\nwas willing to spend at that rate.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But what -- what -- you\njust said -- I may not have misunderstood, but I\nthought you said, in response to Justice Scalia,\nthat, during 1997 and '98, when he said why didn't\nyou take appropriate steps, that you said you didn't\ndo anything, and that was the appropriate step; is\nthat right? If you -- if you said that --\nMR. DELLINGER: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: If I heard you correctly.\nAll right. But then it shows in the -- in the\nSpecial Master's report that, during that time, you\nreceived from the Commission funds over $7 million.\nSo you may not have done anything, but you did take\n$7 million at that time from other people. And so\nthey are saying, fine, if you didn't take any\nanything, didn't do anything, and that was the\nappropriate step, why isn't it the appropriate step\nnow to give us the 7 million back?\nMR. DELLINGER: Justice Breyer, there is a\n-- I -- there is a disconnect between when funds are\nexpended and when they are paid into. There is some\ndeficit financing, so that the Commission's payment\nin 1998 would have been to provide for expenditures\nthat occurred earlier. So there was no -- there was\n-- and there's no suggestion that there is any money\nleft over. And -- and, how can I put it? North\nCarolina doesn't -- never had that money. It went to\nthe authority in a separate and dedicated fund that\ncould only be used for the authority's purposes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Did North Carolina\ncontinue to fund the authority during this interim\nperiod?\nMR. DELLINGER: Yes, North Carolina spent\nhalf a million dollars a year to fund the authority\nfor the remaining 19 months.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So it didn't do nothing\nduring this period?\nMR. DELLINGER: That's correct. And let me\nread you --\nJUSTICE BREYER: You say -- well -- in\nother words, North Carolina's money in '97 and '98,\nwhich was $4 million, went to pay for current\nexpenditures during North -- during that year,\n'97/'98, but the Commission's money, which amounted\nto $7 million in that time, was not spent on current\nthings? It was rather a payment for things done in\nthe past?\nThis sounds not -- I'm not -- I mean,\nthat's possible, but I just don't recall anything\nthat suggests that.\nMR. DELLINGER: North Carolina's 2 million\nalso would have been paid for past -- there was not\n$2 million spent on activities in 1998. That's --\nthat's the payment of prior bills. There's -- these\n--\nJUSTICE BREYER: So the whole formula --\nMR. DELLINGER: These funds are coming into\nthe -- coming into the authority.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- and the whole --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You have the authority\nstill in existence, right?\nMR. DELLINGER: Right.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Don't they have any\nemployees?\nMR. DELLINGER: Yes, they do. That's --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So somebody has to be\nkeeping the authority alive, right? Who did that?\nMR. DELLINGER: The admission of -- the\nauthority with funds from -- that had come from the\nCommission and from the North Carolina General\nAssembly. Here's the actual --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So -- wait, wait, wait.\nYou said all the Commission funds were for prior\nexpenditures.\nMR. DELLINGER: Well, not necessarily.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Oh.\nMR. DELLINGER: That is to say -- there was\nnot $6 million expended during that period. There's\nnot an exact match-up between that list of when\npayments were made and when expenditures were made.\nBut the record showed that North Carolina spent about\n-- I believe about -- the authority spent about half\na million dollars those last 19 months.\nNow, here's the -- here's the actual\nadmission that North Carolina, quote, \"did nothing.\"\nParagraph -- this is at the Plaintiffs' appendix 460.\nThe admission request was: Admit that North Carolina\ntook no further steps after December 19th to ensure\nthat an application for a license was filed.\nResponse: It is admitted that the\nauthority was deprived of funding upon notification\nfrom the Commission in or around 1997 that the\nCommission was terminating its transmittal to the\nauthority of portions of funds derived from fees and\nsurcharges imposed on generators. It is further\nadmitted that the authority had justifiably relied --\nthe North Carolina authority -- on the continued\nprovision of these funds in light of the Commission's\nprevious words and actions. For this reason, the\nauthority did not thereafter take -- thereafter take\nadditional steps to site --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What about the offer --\nwhat about the offer that Mr. Phillips brought up,\nsaid Commission was ready to pay another $21 million,\nand there was going to be loans from the generators?\nMR. DELLINGER: That proposal, first of\nall, left a significant shortfall, as the master\nfound. Even with that proposal, which North Carolina\nthought there were some legal problems with whether\nit would be -- that loans from private generators\nwould allow bonding of the remaining financing -- the\nmaster says it was still a substantial gap left, even\nif North Carolina continued to pay the same amount of\nmoney.\nSo, with North Carolina willing to continue\nto pay at the same rate it had for the previous 8\nyears, and the Commission unwilling or unable to do\nso, it meant that that level of expenditure by North\nCarolina would be a worthless expenditure of its\ntaxpayers' money and the Commission's money.\nThe Commission's position seems to be that\nthey should have taken steps just for the sake of\ntaking steps, like building half a bridge to nowhere,\nwhen you know that there's no financing in sight.\nThey could have withdrawn on December 19th, and they\ntook exactly the steps that were appropriate, which\nis not to spend money that is futile and wasteful.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could I ask you a\nquestion? Is all of this money that has been spent\nor was spent up until 1999 -- has it been washed\naway? Meaning -- and this may be what remains for\nthe unjust enrichment claims, but is there any value\nleft to what occurred?\nMR. DELLINGER: I don't know that there is,\nJustice Sotomayor. I would not assume there is any\n- any value.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: There's no facility --\nMR. DELLINGER: There's no -- as far as I\nknow, there's no value to North Carolina. There's no\n-- in that sense. The -- of the quasi-contract\nclaims.\nCould I turn, if I could, to the\nparticipation of the Commission, which we think\nraises a -- a substantial constitutional question?\nThis is actually, and should be, a very\nsimple question. States, either at common law or\nconstitutionally -- for these purposes, it doesn't\nmatter which side of the fence you are on in Alden.\nStates have a right not to be subject to suit by\nparties that aren't the United States or a sister\nState, absent a valid abrogation.\nThe Commission is neither. It's not a\nState, and that should be pure and simply the answer\nto the question. The issues are whether somehow\nthere should be an exception for a compact. It\nshould be treated like a State and allowed to sue;\nor, even if it's treated like any other private\nlitigant, there is some kind of same-claims exception\n-- in fact, there is one case, Arizona, only, which\nreally addresses this point -- there should be a\nsame-claims exception.\nFirst of all, with respect to whether the\ncompact ought to be able to sue as if it were a\nState, I think that's resolved -- and this Court,\nwhen it rejected a compact suit in number 131 -- of\n- the Commission suit, might have thought the same --\nby the Hess case. It says that compacts cannot claim\nsovereign immunity. If they don't have the dignity\nor status to claim sovereign immunity, they surely\nought not be able to affirmatively pierce the\nsovereign immunity of something that is undoubtedly a\nState. They are not --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But that was in -- Hess\ncame up in a different posture. It wasn't -- I think\n-- it was an attempt to sue the authority, wasn't it?\nMR. DELLINGER: That is -- that is correct.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So I don't think that\nthey are at all comparable. This is a case of does\nthe -- does the authority have standing or -- to\nbring the claim.\nMR. DELLINGER: You could distinguish them\n-- but -- distinguish the two situations. But that\nwould cut in favor of this situation. You might\nthink that a compact has the right to sue as if it\nwere a State, another State, a State, and still think\nthat -- you might think it had sovereign immunity,\nbut not that it could bring a suit against a State.\nBut you certainly wouldn't think that if it's not\neven entitled to invoke sovereign immunity on its own\nbehalf, that it ought to be able to bring it.\nBut no matter. There's no good argument.\nWith or without Hess, there is no good argument for\ntreating a compact as if it were a State. That is a\nslippery road --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Why -- why not? I mean,\nif it's totally a creature of States -- that's all\nit's -- there's no other shareholders, nobody in the\npicture, just -- they are all States that create it?\nMR. DELLINGER: The States do not control\nthis private -- this separate entity.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: They create it, though.\nThey -- the States create the --\nMR. DELLINGER: The States created it. It\nis run by a group of commissioners, two from each\nState, who vote individually and are not bound. For\nexample, the representatives from Georgia and\nMississippi on the Commission voted to bring this\nlitigation against North Carolina. The States of\nGeorgia and Mississippi did not decide to join. They\n-- they voted differently from where their States\nare.\nAnd -- and one of the things about the --\nthe Commission doesn't have the same constraints that\na State has. The attorney general of Alabama might\nthink long and hard before submitting an onerous\ndocument discovery request on a sister State and\nmaking that kind of scorched-earth litigation a\npractice. Something that's not a State doesn't have\nthose constraints.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose -- suppose we\nthink that the same State -- or the same-claim rule\napplies, and that if the Commission is asserting the\nsame claim as the State, that then it can sue.\nSuppose that's the rule. Are these the same claims?\nMR. DELLINGER: They are -- first of all,\nthey are not the same claims. The States who gave\n$25,000 are trying to claim that the Commission\neither is their agent or that they can bring a suit\nthat restitution ought to be made to the Commission,\nthat is a -- the short answer is those are different\nroutes. They are not the same claims, but --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: How can -- how could\nthey not be, Mr. Dellinger? There's only one\ncomplaint, and that complaint is on behalf of all the\nPlaintiffs, not --\nMR. DELLINGER: Yes. But you would have\nthe same last line of a complaint if 1 million people\njoined the State who brought an antitrust suit\nagainst another State. It is simply that -- award\nthe Plaintiffs such damages as this Court deems just\nand proper.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But there's no discrete\nclaim made by the Commission as distinguished from\nSouth Carolina.\nMR. DELLINGER: Yes, the Commission is\nmaking a straight-up restitution claim, which, as the\n-- the entity that provided the funds, it does not.\nBut let me say why I think the separate and\n-- even if the claims were identical, we don't know,\nat this point, that they will wind up being\nidentical, and States shouldn't have to litigate\nuntil we find out.\nThe master just says it's not necessarily\nthe case that they will wind up being identical. Mr.\nPhillips says -- counsel for the Plaintiffs said they\nwould not concede that they would not, at the end of\nthe day, forgo any claim on behalf of the -- of the\nStates that the Commission didn't have.\nBut, most importantly, there is Alden.\nAlden makes this a civil case because Alden says that\nprivate suits against non-consenting States present\nthe indignity of subjecting a State to the coercive\nprocesses of judicial tribunals.\nIf you allow another party in that's not a\nState, you are subjecting a State to all of the\ndiscovery, all of the different theories, all of the\ndepositions, all of the document requests. A sister\nState may, in its attorney general's office, think\ntwice about doing that. A private litigant will not.\nSo I think this case is that -- I believe\nif you didn't want to overrule Arizona, you could say\nit's a case where the United States brought a case in\nits role as trustee for the Indian tribes and the\ntribes themselves were allowed to intervene, and they\nwere, therefore, virtually one and the same party.\nAnd you wouldn't need to overrule it. I don't think,\nif it stands for any broader principle, it can\nsurvive Alden v. Maine.\nNow, if the Commission is out, then we\nthink there is -- and if you agree that there was no\nbreach of contract, then I think the Court should\ndirect the dismissal of the quasi-contract claims\nbecause only the States will be left as a party.\nAnd those claims -- quasi-contract claims\nof restitution, it's -- they are claims that are\ngoverned by the subject matter of the compact between\nthe States, and as to parties to the compact, there\ncan't be any such claims, and I think that should be\nthe end of it.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.\nDellinger.\nMr. Phillips, have you 10 minutes.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS\nON BEHALF OF THE PLAINTIFFS\nMR. PHILLIPS: Thank you, Mr. Chief\nJustice.\nI would like to respond to a number of the\npoints that have been made. It seems to me the most\nfundamental one that Mr. Dellinger relies upon is the\nnotion that this $80 million was not the money of the\ncompact States, and he -- he keeps saying that\nrepeatedly -- you know, based solely on the fact that\nthe money doesn't come through the treasury of the\nStates.\nBut he ignores, on 12A, article 4(H)(2)(b),\nwhich says, with respect to the levying of the\nspecial fees or surcharges, which was the basis upon\nwhich the entirety of the $80 million comes, that\nthis must represent the financial commitments of all\nparty States to the Commission.\nIt was the understanding that, in\nexercising the authority to levy these amounts of\nmoney in order to generate this, that that was the\nStates' money, all of the States' money, and\nultimately, if this Court would have determined that\nthe money --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That provision just\nsays the States don't have to give anything more than\nthat, that that's what satisfies whatever obligations\nthey may or may have. But where does it say that\nmoney belongs to them?\nMR. PHILLIPS: It says each State hosting\n- you know, \"shall annually levy surcharges.\" The\ntotal of those surcharges represent the financial\ncommitments of all of the party States to the\nCommission. That seems to me to say that it is the\ncommitment of the party States that's -- that's being\nprovided for in that context.\nIt's not the money of the Commission. It's\nnot the money of the generators. It's the money of\nthe compact States that's being used for whatever\npurpose is necessary in order to fulfill the overall\nobjectives of the compact. In this context, it was\nused to ask North Carolina to go forward to site a\nfacility.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Wait. I don't -- I don't\nunderstand that.\nMR. PHILLIPS: I'm sorry.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It never passes through\nthe States, and this provision just waves a magic\nwand and says that it represents the financial\ncommitments of all party States to the Commission.\nWhat proportion from each State? Do we know?\nMR. PHILLIPS: We don't know, and we\nwouldn't -- and the truth is, at the end --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I think all this means is\nthat that is the only financial commitment that the\nStates are obliged to -- to make.\nMR. PHILLIPS: I think there's no question\nthat it -- that it can be read as -- as saying that,\nwhich, of course, then tells you, if it's not the\nCommission's responsibility and it's not the States'\nresponsibility, then it was clearly, from the outset\nand has always been, North Carolina's.\nBut I think it goes beyond that, Justice\nScalia. I think it actually tells you, as an\nagreement among all of the party States to this\ncompact, that this is the money of the States, and\nultimately --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It can't be the money of\nthe States if you can't say how much of it belongs to\neach State.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Oh, no. You --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That just doesn't make any\nsense.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, there would be a way\nto allocate it. It seems to me that maybe -- that\neither the Commission, based on the vote of the\nparties -- the party States, could either allocate it\nback on a pro rata basis, or they can do it on the\nbasis of the percentage of the -- of the waste that\nwas used in any particular fund.\nThere's no specific provision on that, but\nit seems to me that doesn't detract, Justice Scalia,\nfrom the fundamental point that what the compact\nmembers agreed upon was that this money would be the\nmoney of all of the States. And, therefore, we can't\nkeep it as a Commission.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But the money that's --\nbut the money that is talked about in that section,\nas I read it, that's money that would be generated\nafter the facility was completed.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right, South Carolina, in\nthis particular context. The -- immediately, it\nwould be South Carolina, and ultimately, then --\nassuming North Carolina or another State were to site\na facility, then, from there on, that money would\ncontinue to be their commitment.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: So you're saying the\nmoney generated by the South Carolina facility was\nthe money of the compact members?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Yes.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And that was the money\nthat was given to North Carolina?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right, because the compact\nagreed among themselves, as part of this agreement,\nthat the -- that they would have authority to impose\nthose surcharges on the generators, as they brought\nthe money in.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But then -- but\nthose States couldn't take the money. They couldn't\nsay, I want my share?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, I think they could\nhave, actually.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You are saying it\nwas their money, but they had no access to it.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, no, but I -- through\ntheir membership, they certainly did. If the States\nagreed to disband the compact and the -- the\nCommission disappears and there's $80 million in the\npot, that money's going somewhere. It's not staying\nin -- it may get paid for legal fees, but other than\nthat --\nJUSTICE BREYER: How does it work? I mean,\nhow does it work? The-- there's a -- there's a plant\nin South Carolina, and a truck comes up filled with\nradioactive waste out of Georgia.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And they go to a booth,\nand now they are charged something. And is the fee\nand special surcharge, which this refers to, the\ntotal charge?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Total charge. And what\ndoes that amount to, primarily? Do we have any idea\non a typical --\nMR. PHILLIPS: You mean, in terms as a\npercentage off the -- off the normal charges?\nJUSTICE BREYER: No -- well, I don't know\nhow they did it. But, anyway, there's a charge. Say\nit's $1,000, or maybe it's $10,000.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Yes, that would be a bit\nhigh.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So -- so the truck company\nhas to pay $10,000 to the authority.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right, the generator does.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And they are saying here\nthat that $10,000 represents --\nMR. PHILLIPS: Represents the commitment of\nthe States.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- the financial\ncommitment of all party States to the Commission.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right. And all that's\nsaying is that that money, even though that -- I\nmean, the alternative way to do it, obviously --\nJUSTICE BREYER: That money might -- seems\nto come from a private company.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: It comes from a private\ncompany. It goes to the -- it goes to the Commission\n-- it goes to South Carolina --\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right, and then it comes to\nthe Commission --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- and they give it to the\nCommission.\nMR. PHILLIPS: -- and the Commission then\nused it in this context. But that's the basic point,\nJustice Breyer. If they didn't have this provision,\nyou would -- you might assume it was the generators'\nmoney or somebody else's money.\nThe whole point of this provision was to\nsay these moneys, which can only be levied because of\nthe compact and the Commission's authority, remain\nthe responsibility of the States and, ultimately, to\nmy mind at least, would clearly go back to them.\nJustice Breyer, I wanted to answer your\nquestion with respect to findings of breach. January\n'98, there is -- the joint supplemental appendix,\npage 55, makes the -- is the Commission sanction\norder, and April '99 -- and, again, at appendix 323\nand appendix 412 -- those are specific findings by\nthe Commission that there have been breaches.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could I just understand\n-- and I don't know if I am missing something -- your\ntheory that this belongs to the States relies\nexclusively on either an agency or an ownership\ntheory as alternatives?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, I mean --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: There's nothing else\nthat would make it --\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, I'm relying on this\nprovision of the compact that says it is the --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's -- that's -- if\nwe disagree with that --\nMR. PHILLIPS: Then we have an agency\ntheory as well.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. And then we\nhave to address that. Is there any other theory that\nwould give the States the right to make the claims\nthe Commission is making?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, I mean, yes --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: For the return of the\n$80 million.\nMR. PHILLIPS: I -- I think that the Court\n-- yes, I think the Court would still have the\nauthority, even in dealing with what is the\nappropriate rule of restitution, because we are too\nfar away from that at this stage. We're not -- we're\nnot there.\nBut I think, if the Court finds that North\nCarolina breached the compact, it ought to try to\nfind a reasonable way to remedy that particular\nproblem, even if the technical standards didn't\napply.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: If we don't do that,\nwhat are you left with?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, no, Justice Sotomayor,\nyou do do that. I mean, when the Court in Kansas v.\nColorado was trying --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I already posed a\nhypothetical. Don't -- if we don't, what is left of\nthis case?\nMR. PHILLIPS: It seems to me the Court\nstill has the authority, in deciding what is the\nappropriate standard of restitution in a problem as\nunique as this one, to do what it did in Kansas v.\nColorado, which is to say: How do we measure the\ndamages to this party? Let's look at what the injury\nwas to the farmers who were completely unrelated to\nit. They clearly wouldn't -- they weren't parties to\nthat litigation, and the Court said that's a\nperfectly legitimate way to figure out the right\ndamages. So I think we would still have an argument\nthat you -- that the Court would have the authority\nto grant that form of restitution under these\ncircumstances.\nMr. Dellinger spent a lot of time on what\nstrikes me as sort of a complete fantasy with respect\nto the funding situation that North Carolina faced.\nYou know, once South Carolina left, to be sure, we\nlost the ability to take money and help North\nCarolina. But the notion that North Carolina, if it\nhad completed this facility, was not going to have a\nlicense to print money in the -- in going forward and\nthat funding wouldn't have been available back in\nthose days is not in the record. And, frankly, it's\ncompletely counterintuitive, because they have a\nmonopoly. That's what the compact specifically\nprovides for them, is the monopoly to be able to\ncontrol the fees that -- on these particular wastes.\nYes, Your Honor?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The ability to withdraw\nterminates upon completion of the facility?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Yes. Six months afterwards.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Six months afterwards. So\nthe -- the facility's completed. It's clear they are\ngoing to have to -- they are going to be charging\nmore than South Carolina, which is a lower cost\nfacility, having been in existence for longer. Why\nwouldn't everybody get out?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Because the risk that South\nCarolina is going to pull up stakes and stop because\nit's been making that noise from the beginning --\nthat was the reason for the crisis. Washington and\nSouth Carolina said: We're not going to take every\nother -- every other State's waste, and we are\ngetting out of this business. So the risk you would\ntake in jumping out in the six months is that you\nthen find out at the back end you have no place to\ndispose of your waste.\nSo the reality is, they had -- all of the\nincentives to go forward existed as much in 1997 as\nthey did in 1995, as they did in 1999. The only\nthing that's fundamental here is they had a\nresponsibility not just to do what was appropriate;\nit was to do what was appropriate to get a license,\nand that's what they never did. They walked away.\nThey took no action. Trying to negotiate funding in\nthe abstract doesn't have anything to do with moving\nforward to get a license. On that score, the\nauthority shut down and closed.\nJustice Sotomayor, you asked: Is there any\nbenefit that remains? Well, the reality is, geology\nstudies and hydrology studies that get done, those\nthings don't change for a billion years. So every\none of those studies that was done is going to be\njust as valid today 12 years later, although I do\nthink the right way to analyze this is not in terms\nof 12 years later, but what would have happened at\nthe time.\nI thank Your Honors.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel.\n"
