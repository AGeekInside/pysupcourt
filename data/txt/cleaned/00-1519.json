        "content": "(10:12 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: We'll hear argument\nfirst this morning in No. 00-1519, United States against\nRalph Arvizu.\nMr. Schlick.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF AUSTIN C. SCHLICK\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. SCHLICK: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nSince Terry, this Court has held repeatedly that\nreasonable suspicion analysis requires a common sense\nevaluation of the totality of the circumstances. The\ndecision below is fundamentally inconsistent with that\nrule because it requires law enforcement officers to\ndisregard potentially relevant facts when determining\nwhether investigative stop is warranted.\nThis Court's decisions in Cortez and Sokolow are\nespecially clear in rejecting attempts to put categories\nof facts off limits. In Cortez, the Court held that a\nvehicle's route, the timing of its trip, and its capacity\nfor carrying illegal aliens together established\nreasonable suspicion, notwithstanding that each of those\nfacts independently might be consistent with innocent\ntravel.\nIn Sokolow, the Court rejected a rule that would\nhave limited officers' ability to consider the personal\ncharacteristics of suspected drug smugglers. The Court\nheld that that sort of rule adds to the difficulty of\napplying the reasonable suspicion standard. It does not\nease it. And the Court further confirmed that innocent\nfacts, facts consistent with innocent travel, in\nthemselves may together establish reasonable suspicion.\nIn this case, the Ninth Circuit attempted to\nestablish a rule that would bar categorically\nconsideration of certain facts that the court deemed\ninnocent. That -- that rule presents two fundamental\nproblems.\nThe first is that it doesn't accommodate the\nsubtleties of real world encounters. For every\ncategorical rule, there would have to be exceptions and\nsubrules, and even if law enforcement officers could be\nasked to master those, they would still then have to\nanticipate new situations, and those rules could not\nprovide guidance when --\nQUESTION: Mr. Schlick, you said this is an area\nin which one can use one's common sense, and I thought\nthat what the Ninth Circuit was telling us was that some\nitems in that list under all circumstances wouldn't cast\nsuspicion. And one was -- had a certain familiar ring\nwith me that when you see a police car, you slow down.\nThis wasn't a car that came to a screeching halt or was\ntrying to dodge it, and then it just slowed down. And\nisn't that a most natural reaction?\nMR. SCHLICK: The problem, Justice Ginsburg, was\nthat the Ninth Circuit didn't admit of situations in which\ndeceleration might be relevant. For example, in the\nFifth Circuit's Villalobos case, which we cited in our\nbrief, the law enforcement officer pulled in front of the\nvehicle that was suspected. The vehicle then slowed to\ndrop back away from the law enforcement officer vehicle,\nand the Border Patrol officer in that case deemed that\nsuspicious, that it appeared that the vehicle had changed\nits speed in order to increase its distance from the\nlaw --\nQUESTION: But they weren't talking about that\ncase. They were talking about this case. And I thought\nwhat they were saying was that there was nothing\nsuspicious about the slowdown here, and if that's all that\nyou have, it won't do.\nMR. SCHLICK: Justice Ginsburg, we read the\ncourt of appeals opinion as attempting to establish\ncategorical rules. On page 12a of the petition appendix,\nthe court says, we attempt here to describe and clearly\ndelimit the extent to which certain factors may be\nconsidered by law enforcement officers in making stops\nsuch as the stop here. On the same page, slowing down\nafter spotting a law enforcement vehicle is an entirely\nnormal response that is in no way indicative of criminal\nactivity. That -- that appears not to have made a -- the\npossibility that deceleration may in some context be\nsuspicious.\nAnd indeed, in the Ninth Circuit's Sigmond-\nBallesteros case, decided after this case, the Ninth\nCircuit interpreted its decision in this case as holding\nthat only certain factors may be considered by law\nenforcement officers when making stops. And it's -- it's\nthat categorical rule that is inconsistent with the\ntotality of the circumstances test.\nQUESTION: I suppose it would be suspicious if\n-- if you're on a highway that has not only a maximum\nspeed but a minimum speed, and -- and the car slows down\n20 miles below the minimum when it -- when it sees a\npolice officer. That -- that wouldn't be a normal\nreaction, would it?\nMR. SCHLICK: No. No, it would not.\nQUESTION: And -- and do you think it's a normal\nreaction always to slow down when one sees a police -- a\npolice car even if you happen to be going 10 miles below\nthe speed limit already?\nMR. SCHLICK: It may depend on the particular\narea, and that's -- that may be a question on which you\nwould look to the law enforcement officer's experience and\nexpertise.\nQUESTION: I don't do it. Maybe you do it. But\nif I'm 10 miles under the speed limit already, I -- I\ndon't immediately slow down when I see a police car. I\ndon't know why you are willing to accept that as a -- as\nan image of reality that everybody slows down when you see\na police car. If you're -- if you're going over the speed\nlimit, I assume you do.\nMR. SCHLICK: I think your intuition accords\nwith common experience and the holdings of most courts.\nQUESTION: There was a concrete record here of\nwhat this driver was doing, and he wasn't going 10 miles\nan hour. He was going a -- a normal speed.\nMR. SCHLICK: Justice Ginsburg, on page 57 of\nthe joint appendix, Agent Stoddard testified that the\nextreme deceleration in this case, from about 50 to 55\nmiles per hour down to about 25 or 30 miles per hour, was\nnot normal and did set respondent's vehicle apart from\nordinary traffic on those roads.\nQUESTION: What was the speed limit on the\nroads?\nMR. SCHLICK: Between 25 miles per hour and 35\nmiles per hour, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: And that's what he slowed down to.\nQUESTION: That was an established speed limit?\nMR. SCHLICK: Yes, Your Honor. In -- in the\njoint appendix, there are photographs which show speed\nlimit signs, and it's 35 miles per hour down near the\nsouthern portion of the roads, 25 in the northern portion.\nQUESTION: What -- what was the portion where --\nwhere he slowed down? I mean, it was 25 to 35? No. It\nwas either 25 or 35. What was it, do you know?\nMR. SCHLICK: I -- I don't know for sure. I --\nI would guess it was 25, but I don't know for sure.\nQUESTION: But that's what he slowed down to.\nSo, he had been going above the speed limit.\nQUESTION: That sounds a lot more reasonable\nthen. I mean, gee, if you don't slow down to the speed\nlimit when you see a police car, you're in big trouble.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. SCHLICK: Again, Agent Stoddard testified\nthat that sort of deceleration, that speed, was not common\nin the area, and it --\nQUESTION: You mean they just keep zipping along\nat 50 despite seeing a police car. What part of the\ncountry is this anyway?\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: It's Arizona.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: What was the nature of the road? Was\n-- was it a regularly paved road?\nMR. SCHLICK: No, Mr. Chief Justice. The road\non which respondent was apprehended was a dirt road. It\nwas a road that Agent Stoddard testified is used primarily\nby the local ranchers and by Forest Service vehicles and\nby the Border Patrol itself. It's -- it's not an improved\nhighway. And it was extremely unusual, Agent Stoddard\nbelieved, for a vehicle, a minivan, to be on these roads,\nand it was a notorious smuggling route.\nQUESTION: Is this one on exhibit 5 of the joint\nappendix, or have I got the wrong road there? Exhibit 5\nis Kuykendall Cutoff Road and Rucker Canyon Road.\nMR. SCHLICK: Yes, Justice Kennedy. The -- the\nphotographs at the back of the joint appendix depict the\nroute. They -- they moved from the southerly portion of\nthe route up, as you get back to the later pages, toward\nthe northern portion. Exhibit 24, for instance, is the\nintersection of Kuykendall Road and Rucker Canyon Road,\nwhich is very close to where the apprehension occurred.\nThe maps in the joint appendix on pages 155 and\n157 show the area at issue. And you can see the first of\nthose maps on page 155 shows the route beginning at the\nbottom of the page in the center, Leslie Canyon Road.\nRespondent then -- and that's -- that's paved for about 10\nmiles, about the first 10 miles near Douglas.\nRespondent traveled north on that road and then\nat the T intersection you see approximately in the middle\nof the page, by which point the -- the roads become\nunpaved, headed right, away from the Border Patrol\ncheckpoint, away from the highway, which would take you\nnorth, through the dirt road, proceeded up Rucker Canyon\nRoad, about three-quarters of the way up the page. That's\nan important intersection.\nQUESTION: Well, he turned left rather than\nright, didn't he?\nMR. SCHLICK: I'm sorry. Turned -- turned right\nat the intersection, at that T intersection where Leslie\nCanyon Road jogs right, then stayed on Leslie Canyon Road,\ntook a left on Rucker Canyon. And that was a critical\nturn.\nHad he gone right, he would have been going\ntowards the only recreation areas in the vicinity. And\nthat might have explained the presence of cargo in his --\nin his minivan. Agent Stoddard could see that there\nappeared to be cargo on the floor of the van. But he\ninstead turned left, away from the only -- the local\nrecreation area and on a route that, if he then took --\ntook a right onto Kuykendall Road, which is -- which is\nagain almost in the center of the page near the top\nbetween numbers 2 and 3 -- if he took that right on\nKuykendall Road, then he would be circumventing the Border\nPatrol checkpoint which is indicated by number 1 on the\nleft-hand margin of the page.\nQUESTION: The idea that he would eventually go\nnorth on Kuykendall and then take -- go west to rejoin 191\nnorth of the checkpoint.\nMR. SCHLICK: That -- that's right, and then\nhead up to I-10, which would allow him to go to Tucson --\nTucson or Phoenix, for example. And it was that route\nwhich Agent Stoddard testified is a notorious smuggling\nroute, very rarely used by anyone except ranchers and\nForest Service personnel --\nQUESTION: Although it is a route that could\nhave been used by people going up to the Chiricahuas.\nMR. SCHLICK: It's -- it's possible, Your Honor,\nbut --\nQUESTION: From Douglas.\nMR. SCHLICK: -- the district court addressed\nthat possibility on page 22a of the petition appendix and\nsaid that that would require a 40 or 50 mile trip over\nunimproved dirt roads. The most logical way to go is to\ntake I-191 straight up I-181 and then across to Chiricahua\nNational Monument.\nThat's particularly significant in this case\nbecause the registration of the minivan was to a block\nthat was just two blocks from I-191 in Douglas, and that\nmakes it all the more inexplicable that a -- a vehicle\nthat should know the roads would go out of its way to\nLeslie Canyon Road, rather than just going two blocks,\npicking up the highway and heading straight north. You\nknow, that's -- that's the route that you would take if it\nwere a long distance trip.\nI said that the cargo couldn't be explained by\nthe recreation area, because it had already passed the\nturn on Rucker Canyon Road. Nor could it be explained by\na long distance trip because the highway is the road that\nyou would take if you were headed on -- on a long distance\nwith children with suitcases or overnight bags.\nQUESTION: Mr. Schlick, could I come back to the\n-- to the slowing -- slowing up? I'm not quite sure what\nthe -- what the Government's objection to the court's\nopinion is. I -- I would tend to think that -- that it is\ntrue, in the circumstances of this case, that if somebody\nis barreling along at 50, sees a police car, and slows\ndown to 25, that is not at all suspicious. Indeed, I -- I\nmight consider it suspicious if he continued barreling\nalong at 50.\nSo, you know, if your argument is that in the\ncircumstances of this case, the slowing down was\nsuspicious, I -- I don't think I agree with you. On the\nother hand, it is the case that the court of appeals\nseemed to have -- seems to say that slowing down can never\nbe suspicious.\nNow, which of the two are -- are you objecting\nto? Do you really think that -- I mean, that there was\nproper suspicion in this case simply because the person\nslowed down to the speed limit when he saw the police car?\nMR. SCHLICK: In this case, Justice Scalia, the\ndeceleration is -- is not a factor on which the case would\nturn. There were other indications of nervousness which\nI'd like to discuss in a moment.\nQUESTION: Okay. So, as to that factor, your --\nyour -- really your only objection is you can't be as\ncategorical as the court of appeals put the point.\nMR. SCHLICK: That's -- that's exactly right.\nWe think it's a good example of the error of the court of\nappeals' approach.\nBut in this case, even looking at the factor of\nnervousness, there were other indications. After\ndecelerating, respondent drove past the Border Patrol\nvehicle and stared rigidly straight ahead, without looking\nat or acknowledging Agent Stoddard, which --\nQUESTION: May I ask this question? At the very\npage of the opinion that you call our attention to, the\ncourt of appeals said, in reaching our conclusion, we find\nthat some of the factors on which the district court\nrelied are neither relevant nor appropriate to a\nreasonable suspicious -- suspicion analysis in this case.\nAnd are you agreeing with Justice Scalia that the slowing\ndown in this case was not relevant?\nMR. SCHLICK: Justice Stevens, we would say that\nit had some relevance. It was -- it was not a\nparticularly important factor, but it had some relevance.\nThe -- the court of appeals I think --\nQUESTION: Do you think the court of appeals\nerred in saying that in this case it had no relevance?\nMR. SCHLICK: Yes, Justice Stevens.\nQUESTION: I see.\nQUESTION: And what about -- what about, you\nknow, not -- not waving to the police car as you go by? I\ndon't know when I -- if I were ever exceeding the speed\nlimit and saw --\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: -- and saw a police car, it seems to\nme I would slow down and -- and try to give the impression\nthat I wasn't slowing down because I saw the police car.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: I mean, you know, you don't hit the\nbrake and wave at the police officer.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: So, why is that a suspicious factor?\nI don't see why in the circumstances of this case that's a\nsuspicious factor either.\nMR. SCHLICK: Agent Stoddard's testimony was\nthat both respondent and his front-seat adult passenger\nstared straight ahead. The respondent gripped the wheel\nvery tightly in -- in a position that Agent Stoddard\ndeemed characteristic of someone who simply wants to melt\ninto their vehicle if possible, and --\nQUESTION: Or maybe somebody who had been going\n50 miles an hour in a 25-mile-an-hour zone.\nMR. SCHLICK: Again, Agent Stoddard's testimony\nwas -- was that respondent's behavior was -- was very\nunusual.\nAnd after he saw those -- those and began to\nfollow the minivan, there was another indication of\nnervousness, which was at the intersection of Rucker\nCanyon Road and Kuykendall Road. Respondent turned on his\nblinker, well ahead of the intersection, then turned it\noff, drove towards the intersection, and just before the\nintersection, made a sharp turn and turned on his blinker\nagain, which again indicated uncertainty or nervousness,\nwhich supported the inference that he was unusually\ndistracted by the presence of the Border Patrol vehicle.\nQUESTION: What's the testimony as to the amount\nof use this particular route got? How many cars a day,\nanything about how many cars a day or an hour came over\nit?\nMR. SCHLICK: The testimony, Mr. Chief Justice,\nwas that this road -- the sensor hits on -- the Border\nPatrol maintains sensors along Leslie Canyon Road and\nRucker Canyon Road, and that the first sensor on Leslie\nCanyon Road, which responded to northbound traffic, was\ntriggered about once every 2 hours.\nQUESTION: So, that would mean one car every 2\nhours?\nMR. SCHLICK: Correct. And -- and that's\ndirectly relevant to the expected response. When you're\nin an area where one car travels approximately every 2\nhours, you're more likely to acknowledge perhaps a\nfriendly wave -- another vehicle. This road was extremely\nremote, and again, most of the traffic was local vehicles\nfrom -- from the ranches, and the minivan was a vehicle\nwhich was not only unusual by type for this road, because\nit was not a four-wheel drive vehicle, but also had the\ncapability of carrying a large amount of concealed cargo,\nwhich made it well-suited to smuggling activity. This\nCourt noted in Brignoni-Ponce that that is a factor that\nis potentially relevant when determining whether\ninvestigative stop is warranted in the border context.\nThe -- the second problem with the court of\nappeals approach, in addition to the fact that it can't\ncomprehend the subtleties the real world encounters, is\nthat it's unrealistic to ask officers to put out of their\nminds facts that they see before them and believe to be\nrelevant. Even if officers could do that, they would then\nbe left to speculate about the hypothetical import of the\nimagined set of facts, and that's going to --\nQUESTION: One -- one of the things the Ninth\nCircuit said is just looking at this laundry list and just\nto throw everything in and mix it all up and say it's\nsuspicious that the driver didn't look at the police\nofficer or didn't wave, but it's equally suspicious that\nthe children did wave. So, one characterization of that\nwas damned if you do, damned if you don't. If you wave,\nthat's no good, and if you don't wave, that's no good.\nAnd I think that the -- the Ninth Circuit can't be faulted\nfor saying it's not good enough just to list everything\nthat happened and say it's -- everything the officer could\nperceive and say it was all relevant. Some of it is\nrelevant and some of it isn't.\nWhy would, for example, the children -- how old\nwere the children, by the way?\nMR. SCHLICK: 12, 10, and 7.\nQUESTION: And the children were waving in the\nback, and something was to be inferred from that?\nMR. SCHLICK: They weren't simply waving, Your\nHonor. Without turning toward the Border Patrol\nvehicle --\nQUESTION: They were waving forward.\nMR. SCHLICK: Correct.\nQUESTION: And -- and the car -- the police --\nthe Border Patrol car was behind them.\nMR. SCHLICK: Correct. It may be expected that\na Border Patrol agent would have some experience with\nchildren's reaction to him in his vehicle. And in this\ncase he said he -- he hadn't seen anything like this. It\nwent on for about 4 or 5 minutes. It was methodical. The\nchildren waved together, facing forward without -- without\nfacing Agent Stoddard.\nWith respect to the damned if you do/damned if\nyou don't argument, waving or not waving, the court of\nappeals ignored the fact that -- Agent Stoddard's\ntestimony was that he deemed it suspicious that when the\nBorder Patrol vehicle was stopped and respondent drove\npast, respondent didn't acknowledge him at all. After\nthat, he turned and began to follow respondent's vehicle,\nand it was only at that point that the children began\ntheir odd waving. So, it's a reasonable inference that\nhaving failed in his effort to avoid the -- the Border\nPatrol officer's attention, respondent then went to plan\nB, which was we'll attempt to -- to look like a family on\n-- on an outing, and one way of -- of perhaps deflecting\nthe agent's suspicion is to have the children wave. But\nthat resulted, from Agent Stoddard's perspective, in a --\na very odd circumstance, and that's the exactly the sort\nof situation that the reasonable suspicion analysis --\nQUESTION: To -- to what extent, Mr. Schlick, do\nthree judges, say, sitting in San Francisco or Los Angeles\nor nine Justices sitting here -- do we defer to the\njudgment in these matters of a Border Patrol agent on the\nscene?\nMR. SCHLICK: Ornelas, among other cases,\naddressed that, Your Honor, and -- and held that it's\nappropriate to give due weight to the expertise and\nexperience of law enforcement officers and local judges.\nAnd in this case, both Agent Stoddard and -- and the trial\njudge deemed this route to be unusual, to be associated\nwith smuggling. It deemed -- the trial judge deemed the\nfactors that I've enumerated to be significant in the\ncontext of what was going on out there, and I believe\nthose are the trial judge's words. We have to look at\nthis in the context of what was going on out there.\nThe cargo, for example. He considered the\npossibility that it might just be camping supplies, but he\nsaid that would be -- that would be a possible inference\nwere it not for all the other indications of illegality.\nSo, he -- he correctly undertook to analyze the facts --\nQUESTION: May I ask this question? I got the\nimpression, in reading the officer's testimony, what he\nreally did is once he checked and found where the car came\nfrom, where it was registered in a high drug area, that's\nwhat triggered his decision to stop the vehicle. And my\nquestion to you is supposing all he knew was the very\nunusual circumstances of a family driving in an area\nthat's mostly driven through by ranchers and -- and not\nfamilies. That fact, the rare amount of traffic on the\nroad, and the -- and the location from which the car\noriginated, would that be enough in your view?\nMR. SCHLICK: If you --\nQUESTION: -- put aside all these rather unusual\nthings like waving and slowing down and so forth. Would\nthose three facts be enough in your view to justify the\nstop?\nMR. SCHLICK: As -- as I understand your\nquestion, no, I don't think they would be. But when you\nstart adding factors such as missing the turnoff to the\nrecreation areas, such as carrying the concealed cargo --\nQUESTION: Well, missing the turnoff is part of\nthe location, as I say. The unusual location of the\nvehicle at the time of the stop. Is that -- and the fact\nit was not the normal. You normally see ranchers or -- or\nBorder Patrol people. You don't normally see families out\nthere. That's a -- that's a road that is not usually\nused. Is the -- I'm just wondering if the rarity of the\n-- of the general scene plus the fact that they did --\nthat the officer did check and find that this vehicle was\nregistered in the -- in the area known for drug smuggling,\nwas that enough? I think you said no.\nMR. SCHLICK: Is -- in your hypothetical,\nJustice Stevens, is the fact that it was a minivan?\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. SCHLICK: Yes, yes. If you knew that it was\na minivan, which was out of character, suited to carrying\naliens, and knew that the route had been taken, that last\nturn onto Kuykendall Road, north so that the minivan would\nnot approach the checkpoint, then yes, there would be\nreasonable suspicion.\nQUESTION: In other words, you're saying -- what\nyou're saying I think is that even if the Ninth Circuit\nwere correct in disregarding the waving and the slowing\ndown and the failure to wave once, you'd still have a\nreasonable suspicion.\nMR. SCHLICK: Yes, Justice Stevens. It would be\nour position that even if you consider only the three\nfactors that the court of appeals considered categorically\nin the analysis -- that would be the route, the fact that\nit was a minivan, and the time. The time was when the\nBorder Patrol was likely to have stepped down its\nsurveillance. The court of appeals held if you considered\nthose factors, there was no reasonable suspicion. We\nwould disagree and say even if you only consider those\nfactors, there was reasonable suspicion. But the\nappropriate analysis is to consider all the factors\ncollectively, and then clearly there were grounds for the\nstop.\nIf the Court has no further questions --\nQUESTION: I have another question, if -- if you\nhave the time.\nThis checkpoint is about 30 miles north of the\nborder. Was there also a checkpoint in the --in the town\nfrom which the car originated? I'm just a little puzzled\nat what the -- at the setup here, why there's the\ncheckpoint 30 miles from the border, and whether or not\nthere was one closer to the border.\nMR. SCHLICK: There -- there's a border\ninspection station in -- in Douglas, but the Court\nexplained in Martinez-Fuerte the -- the criteria the\nBorder Patrol uses to establish its fixed checkpoints, and\nI think those criteria continue to hold true today. One\nof them is that the checkpoint should be outside, about 25\nmiles from the border, because 25 miles is the zone in\nwhich a border crossing card allows an alien to travel.\nSo, you would -- so, you would be stopping aliens who were\n-- who were legally there because of their border crossing\ncard.\nAlso, you want your checkpoint to be somewhat\nremote from -- from the population center. Douglas is a\ntown of about 15,000 people. And you want your -- your\ncheckpoint to capture traffic which is heading north, away\nfrom the border, rather than just local traffic within\nthat area.\nQUESTION: And then the other question I had is\nabout the sensors. There were two sensors triggered in\nthis case, as I understand the record. Are there -- are\nthe sensors spotted purely in order to identify every\nvehicle that uses this particular road that this -- this\nman used?\nMR. SCHLICK: The sensors are magnetic sensors\nwhich are directional. So, they don't pick up southbound\ntravel, which would -- which would not be consistent with\nsmuggling away from the border. They do pick up all\nnorthbound traffic. So, it would pick local --\nQUESTION: Well, they picked up not only the\nnorthbound, but also the fact that he turned right the\nfirst time. No, left the first time. He passed the\nRucker Canyon Road.\nMR. SCHLICK: Yes. In this case there were two\nsensors. One was before Rucker Canyon Road. When that\nsensor was triggered, Agent Stoddard began to drive\ntowards respondent to -- to check out the sensor hit. And\nthen a second sensor was triggered after respondent turned\nleft on Rucker Canyon Road and away from the national\nforest.\nQUESTION: Away from the recreational area.\nMR. SCHLICK: That's right.\nQUESTION: Yes.\nQUESTION: Very well, Mr. Schlick.\nMs. Brambl, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF VICTORIA A. BRAMBL\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMS. BRAMBL: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nI wanted to respond to the question that you\nasked, Mr. Chief Justice, about who should we give due\nweight to and who is going to know better, the officer in\nthe field, the district court, or the court of appeals.\nAnd certainly the decision in Ornelas v. United States\ndoes instruct us that we give weight -- we review for\nclear error the -- the factual findings that the district\ncourt made. However, inferences from those findings that\nthe district court makes and -- and that the officer makes\nare reviewed. They're reviewed giving due weight to\nthose. That is not as strict or rigorous as the standard\nas for clear error.\nAnd then finally, Ornelas -- that decision\nreally wanted and instructed the courts -- the courts of\nappeal to issue opinions that were instructive to firm up\nthe precedent and to offer guidance to everybody, to\nofficers in the field, to litigants, to district courts.\nAnd really, the Ninth Circuit in this case -- they handle\nthe lion's share, over two-thirds of -- or approximately\ntwo-thirds of the border stop cases come from the Ninth\nCircuit. They also have developed experience. They've\ndeveloped both practical experience in seeing these cases\nover and over again and seeing neutral and rote factors\noffered over and over again that really don't have any\nweight. And they're instructing through this opinion and\nseveral other opinions that they've issued over the last\n20 or 30 years --\nQUESTION: All those -- that type of opinion\nseems to me contrary to our opinion in Sokolow where we\nsaid you just can't categorize these kind of factors and\nsay that this kind of thing is never useful and something\nelse is always useful.\nMS. BRAMBL: I think that all the parties agree\nthat the totality cannot have categorical rules because --\nQUESTION: Well, then certainly you -- you must\n-- you're not defending then some parts of the Ninth\nCircuit opinion. Is that correct?\nMS. BRAMBL: I think that some of the language\nthat the Ninth Circuit used was inartful in that it made\nit sound -- if you take one sentence out of the whole\nopinion, it would make it sound like they were creating\ncategorical rules. But when you read everything, the\nwhole opinion, in the context, they do cite all of the\ncases this Court has decided: Sokolow, Terry, Cortez,\nBrignoni-Ponce, Wardlow. They say that they consider\neverything.\nBut then they go through factor by factor. And\nI do defend the way they went about that, separating out\nthe factors and discussing them because it seems that that\nwould be the only orderly way to go about the analysis,\nand the only way to -- to offer an opinion that really\ndoes give some instruction and guidance.\nQUESTION: How -- how is that? I was quite\ndisturbed actually by the opinion because I thought there\nwere five or six Supreme Court cases that say this is just\nthe kind of opinion you should not write. So, then I -- I\nwent through it, and it says, for example, one of the\nfactors, the fact the minivan slowed, is prohibited by our\nprecedent. Well, my own common sense reaction would be it\nall depends. If he was going 40 miles an hour and slowed\nto 10 in -- in 2 seconds, I'd say, why in the middle of\nthe desert did he feel compelled to slow so much? I -- I\nsuspect people don't give tickets in Arizona for driving\n50 miles in the middle of the desert. Maybe they do, but\nit doesn't say that. I think it would depend.\nHe says that the fact that a van is registered\nto an address in a block notorious for smuggling is of no\nsignificance and may not be given any weight.\nThen there are four or five others which are\nlisted where the second factor is of questionable value.\nThe failure -- he has five of them there, which say our\nprecedent says you give no weight.\nNow, I just don't see how to square that either\nwith Ornelas, Sokolow, or five other precedents of this\nCourt, as well as with common sense, because it seems to\nme it would all depend.\nMS. BRAMBL: Well, I certainly agree that --\nthat there may be circumstances in which where you live or\nslowing down could be. With respect to the first one,\nwhere they do say squarely prohibited by our precedent,\nthey go ahead and -- and then relate instances where\nslowing down -- where they do find that this is\nsuspicious. Just merely the act of slowing down they have\ndetermined, using common sense and -- and I think a lot of\nthe comments this morning illustrate that if maybe not a\nuniversal reaction, it's so common to slow down when you\nsee a law enforcement officer, that it's meaningless.\nQUESTION: Maybe -- maybe we really don't know\nenough to say that. I -- I was engaging in that\nconversation with the Government's counsel. But -- but in\npoint of fact, I'm not sure what the reaction is, as -- as\nJustice Breyer puts it, out in the middle of the desert.\nFor one thing, I don't know whether -- whether\nBorder Patrol officers can give speeding tickets. For\nanother thing, I don't know whether it's generally known\nthat Border Patrol officers cannot give speeding tickets.\nAnd therefore, I don't know whether it's, indeed, quite\ncommon out in the middle of the -- of the vast desert of\nArizona for people to go barreling along at 50 miles an\nhour past a Border Patrol agent and ordinarily to wave and\nsay hi.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: These are all matters that I'm sure\nthe Border Patrol agent was aware of, and perhaps the\ndistrict court. I'm less certain that the court of\nappeals out in San Francisco was -- was aware of all of\nthose things. Why shouldn't I give the Border Patrol\nagent and the district court the benefit of the doubt?\nMS. BRAMBL: Well, the agent -- like so many of\nthe factors in this case, the agent didn't really tie down\nor tie into his experience why slowing down would be\npredictive or indicative of not just speeding but of\ncriminal activity such as alien or drug smuggling, which\nwas the reason that he was out there.\nQUESTION: Well, he said, people, when they see\nmy Border Patrol car, normally don't slow down. He\ncertainly said that, and he found that to be unusual.\nNow, why -- why should I think that that is false?\nMS. BRAMBL: Well --\nQUESTION: Do you know, as a matter of fact,\nwhether Border Patrol agents give speeding tickets?\nMS. BRAMBL: I think that that's an open\nquestion.\nQUESTION: It's an open question whether they\ngive speeding tickets?\nMS. BRAMBL: But I believe that generally --\nQUESTION: Don't they have other things to do?\nMS. BRAMBL: They do have other things to do. I\nbelieve that if driving would be characterized as\ndangerous where maybe the public was in jeopardy, that\nthey would be authorized to make a stop, but just because\nsomeone is speeding or violating an Arizona traffic law, I\ndon't believe that they would make such a stop.\nBut I wanted to point out that the Ninth Circuit\nopinion went on, after they said that this factor was\nsquarely prohibited, to say the kinds of ways that slowing\ndown or a deceleration would be indicative of reasonable\nsuspicion or would -- would have some weight. And they\ncharacterized that as evasive driving where -- where\nperhaps the Border Patrol is seen and then there's an act\nof evasion as well as deceleration.\nQUESTION: Ms. Brambl, the -- the district court\nruled for the Government in this case, and the Ninth\nCircuit reversed. And I don't see that in the district\ncourt's opinion, which the court of appeals was -- was\nreviewing, that same laundry list that appears in the\nNinth Circuit's decision. So, what I don't understand is\nif you just take the district court's opinion, what did\nthe district court rely on that could be questionable?\nThe district judge did not rely on the children waving, as\nI recall.\nMS. BRAMBL: Well, the district court judge did\nrefer to that, but what's -- what the -- the court of\nappeals picked up on, which the district court didn't, was\nall of the inferences that -- and subjective beliefs that\nthis waving entailed because it wasn't just -- the\nchildren were facing forward and waving forward. So, it\nwas a big leap that they were even waving at the agent to\nbegin with and an even bigger leap that the agent made\nthat they were coached to do so, presumably by the driver\nor the adult passengers. And that's what the Ninth\nCircuit seized on.\nAnd another big deficiency with this is how does\nwaving or waving in a mechanical, odd way, as the district\ncourt found -- how would that be tied in to criminal\nbehavior? And the record doesn't indicate how.\nQUESTION: How do we know from the record what\nkind of wave it was? What -- what he says in his\ntestimony is they kind of stuck their hands up and began\nwaving to me like this. Well, I'm sorry.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: There we are. Okay?\nNow, the person who saw that was the district\njudge, and the way it was characterized by the policeman\nis it wasn't in a normal pattern. It looked like they\nwere instructed to do so. And without being able to see\nwhat he did, it's a little tough for me. And -- and so, I\ndon't know. What the courts both say is it doesn't add\nmuch.\nThe odd thing about the court of appeals opinion\nis it seems to suggest, because it doesn't prove the case,\nit's not relevant. Now, I -- I mean, what's the response\nto that?\nMS. BRAMBL: Well, I think that -- that goes to\nthe heart of the issue presented by this case, which is\nwhat can the court of appeals exclude as factors, even if\nthey do it on a case-by-case basis. Can they look at\nfactors and just say, you know what, this is so marginally\nrelevant or completely weightless that we're not going to\n-- to count it in the equation? And although I don't\ndefend this --\nQUESTION: But it does seem as though the Ninth\nCircuit was trying to suggest that no other court could\nconsider it in the calculus either in the future and --\nand was making some kind of effort to develop some more\nrigid guidelines than we've seen in the past.\nLet me tell you what concerns me very frankly.\nWe live in a perhaps more dangerous age today than we did\nwhen this event took place. And are we going to back off\nfrom totality of the circumstances in an era when it may\nbecome very important to us to have that as the overall\ntest? And I'm concerned that the Ninth Circuit opinion\nseemed to be a little more rigid than our precedents\nrequire or that common sense would dictate today.\nMS. BRAMBL: Well, I certainly agree that\ntotality and reasonableness has to remain flexible, and\nthat given the times that we live in, that perhaps\nadjustments are going to be made. Thankfully this case I\ndon't know presents the -- the specter of that.\nAnd it -- it seems that what the Ninth Circuit\ntried to do in this case was to really provide some\nmeaningful guidance. They could have just listed the\nfactors in a very straight forward way without any\ndiscussion and just said, you know what? We add all these\ntogether and there's no reasonable suspicion. And we\nprobably wouldn't be here today. However, what they tried\nto do I think is to provide some guidance for everybody\nbecause when we get these cases as --\nQUESTION: When we have said that the test is\ntotality of the circumstances, the amount of guidance that\ncan be provided by -- by a court is -- is somewhat\nlimited.\nMS. BRAMBL: It is but there's a surprising\nrepetition of factors. This Court in --\nQUESTION: A surprising repetition of factors by\nthe Ninth Circuit.\nMS. BRAMBL: Well -- well, even this Court in\nOrnelas recognized that certain fact patterns were\nsimilar, such as Sokolow and Royer and a few others, that\nreally -- given how fact-specific they are, there really\nis, especially when you start looking in border areas\nwhere -- for instance, there are a number of stops where\nthere are checkpoints and -- and people claiming that\nperhaps these people are on the road for checkpoint\nevasion purposes.\nQUESTION: Yes, but -- but you know, checkpoints\nvary too. The checkpoint north of San Diego is -- is in a\nheavily populated area where things may be quite different\nthan out here in the Sulphur Springs Valley where there\naren't very many people.\nMS. BRAMBL: Well, sure. It seems that -- that\nif you look through, for instance, just Ninth Circuit\nopinions, or if you go over to Fifth Circuit and Tenth\nCircuit, but also look at the -- the border areas, you do\nsee surprising number of repetition, even though perhaps\nsome are in very urbanized areas and some are in rural\nareas.\nQUESTION: Well, that's -- that's true. The\nofficers are -- are trained to tell the district court,\nthe finder of fact, all of the factors that entered into\ntheir judgment. It seems to me, though, a fair reading, a\nnecessary reading of the Ninth Circuit's opinion, that we\nnow have seven factors that every officer in the Ninth\nCircuit must memorize and not rely on. And I just don't\nsee how that's consistent with the ability of the police\nto perform their work or consistent at all with our\nopinions. And as the court -- as the Government has told\nus, the Ninth Circuit itself has construed this opinion in\nsubsequent cases precisely that way.\nMS. BRAMBL: Well, the Ninth Circuit, even since\nthis opinion, still examines all of the factors. They\nstill look at the totality even in the Sigmond-Ballesteros\ncase that the Government cited in its briefs. However --\nQUESTION: You have a point that's a serious\npoint I think. The first time I see a case where the\npoliceman testifies I -- I stopped this individual because\nhe looked nervous as he came away from the airplane down\nto the baggage counter, and he looked both ways, and then\nthere was sweat on his upper lip and he walked around the\nbaggage thing, and then, looking around, went over to his\nsuitcase -- the first time you see that, you think, well,\nthat makes sense to me. But when you see exactly the same\nthing 15 times, you begin to wonder. Now, that I guess is\nyour point.\nMS. BRAMBL: Well, it -- well, it is.\nQUESTION: Okay. Now, what do we do about that?\nI had thought that the way to deal with it is -- totality\nof the circumstances is the way to deal with it, not\nhaving rigid rules that say you can never consider whether\nhis -- he was sweating or wasn't sweating. In other\nwords, I don't see how a rigid rule helps. It puts too\nmany cases on one -- it gets the wrong cases. It doesn't\ndraw a sensible line.\nNow, what's your view of that? I see your\nproblem. I want to know the solution.\nMS. BRAMBL: Well, I think that the solution is\nto allow courts like the Ninth Circuit and other circuits\nto say, look, we see the same thing time and time again,\nand it really has very little or no meaning. Officers, we\nwant you to tell us why this factor is suspicious. It's\nnot going to be enough anymore to come in and just say, he\nlooked nervous, he slowed down. And --\nQUESTION: But that -- and I -- I think your --\nyour point is -- is well taken as far as you go, but it\nseems to me that that's not going to help the Ninth\nCircuit opinion here because what you're saying is don't\nrely on highly general factors which are so general that\nwe really, in the abstract, don't know where they point.\nBe more specific. Give us facts not conclusions. But\nthat's not -- that's not what the Ninth Circuit said. The\nNinth Circuit, in effect, said, well, we're -- we're\nsimply going to exclude certain categories of fact.\nMS. BRAMBL: Well, as I said, the language the\nNinth Circuit used could have been a lot more clear and a\nlot more artful.\nQUESTION: Well, it might have said what you\nsaid, but it didn't say what you said. I mean, isn't that\nso?\nMS. BRAMBL: Well, they did say frequently, and\nin effect, when there was a rehearing in this case, they\namended the opinion to add under the circumstances of this\ncase and in this case on many, many times.\nQUESTION: Maybe not often enough.\n(Laughter.)\nMS. BRAMBL: It would have helped.\nQUESTION: Because -- because initially the\nopinion did read categorically we don't consider slowing\ndown, we don't consider kids waving, and then they threw\nin a lot of under the circumstances in this case, not in\n-- in every instance, but in a number of cases. That's --\nthe amendment seems at odds with what the original opinion\nwas, which seemed to be saying we have three categories\nhere: never relevant, sometimes relevant, always relevant.\nMS. BRAMBL: And I think you're right. They --\nI wouldn't say that they were categorical in excluding,\nbut they -- they certainly did seem to suggest that --\nthat certain factors were not relevant, and they did add\nin this case. And basically if someone comes into court\nwith the exact same factor and they're not able to show\nwhy that's relevant or probative in this case, why this\nfactor isn't neutral and does have an inference of\ncriminal activity, then that factor, if you follow the --\nthe other courts follow the Ninth Circuit's opinion it's\ngoing to -- it's going to be excluded. It's not going to\nbe considered as relevant or probative.\nI think that that is the kind of guidance that\nthe circuits should be offering.\nQUESTION: Well, one thing that the circuit\ndidn't do and it did puzzle me was when I read the\ndistrict court's opinion, I thought the district court was\nsaying, yes, I could go along with they're in a recreation\narea. But when it came to a certain point and they made a\nturn, it made no sense at all because if that's where they\nwere going to go, they should have gotten right on the\nhighway. That seemed to be unanswered, that. Why wasn't\n-- the -- the Ninth Circuit didn't deal with that as\nprecisely as the district court did.\nMS. BRAMBL: That's true, but the Ninth Circuit\ndid point out -- and if you look at the map that's on --\non page 157 of the joint appendix -- that's the map that\nwe submitted in connection with this case and that the\ndistrict and the -- the Ninth Circuit considered -- it\nshows that -- it's got a lot more detail, as far as a lot\nof the destinations. And when the Government said that\nreally there weren't any destinations beyond Rucker\nCanyon, beyond where the stop occurred --\nQUESTION: Where you turn onto Kuykendall?\nMS. BRAMBL: Yes. Once you turn onto that road\nand you keep going, you can see to the east there's a\nnumber of campgrounds, a number of areas, including --\nQUESTION: The Chiricahua?\nMS. BRAMBL: Yes.\nQUESTION: Yes, but to go from Douglas to\nChiricahua National Monument would be -- would be\nextremely odd to go the route this minivan took. You'd go\nup -- up 191 and cut over above the checkpoint.\nMS. BRAMBL: Well, the van was appropriate for\nthat road and the conditions, and I would point out that\nwhen the agent had --\nQUESTION: Well, if it's appropriate, if it's --\nit's also appropriate to go on a paved highway, I take it.\nMS. BRAMBL: Well, sure, but --\nQUESTION: I mean, why would you go up this\nvery winding road to a place that you can get to much more\nquickly by going up a paved highway?\nMS. BRAMBL: It might be a -- a matter of\npreference and -- and taste. But these areas are\nbeautiful and --\nQUESTION: Well, you know, all of these factors\n-- as Justice Breyer suggested, we're not saying that they\nwould prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt or that they\nwould amount to probable cause. But all we're talking\nabout is reasonable suspicion.\nMS. BRAMBL: But it isn't suspicious for a\nfamily from Douglas to use a road that leads right from\nDouglas, that start out -- that starts out 10 miles paved,\nto go through a beautiful area up to perhaps Chiricahua\nMonument or some of the areas along there on the --\nQUESTION: Yes. You can't -- it's obviously\nnothing criminal. But what -- what did the respondent\nsay, that he was going to meet somebody there?\nMS. BRAMBL: That's correct.\nQUESTION: What's -- how does that tie in with\ngoing to a recreational area?\nMS. BRAMBL: Well -- well, it really doesn't\nbecause we know that he was involved in illegal activity,\nbut that's the hindsight of what the officer found after\nthe stop. And the -- the --\nQUESTION: Would you comment on a -- on a phase\nof the case that keeps puzzling me? The -- the sensors on\nthe road. It must be that the -- that there was some\nsuspicion on every vehicle that went up here because I\nguess the first sensor that was triggered caused the\nofficer to -- to go over and take a look at the vehicle,\nand that happened rarely enough, so you make a special\nexamination of every vehicle that trips the sensor. And\nthen if they trip the second sensor, that's -- they're\ndoubly suspicious. And how -- how relevant is that in the\nwhole picture?\nMS. BRAMBL: Well -- well, I think what's\nimportant to recognize is that when you look at the maps,\nthere aren't too many roads that lead anywhere from\nDouglas because it's right on the border. So, there's the\nmain road, the paved one, that the district court that Mr.\nArvizu should have taken, and then there's this dirt road,\nthe unpaved one, which is quite well-maintained, and they\nhave sensors on that to catch all the cars that avoid the\ncheckpoint.\nBut my point is that every road that leads away\nfrom the border is suspicious to some degree and can be\nlabeled that way. It happened to be --\nQUESTION: It is particularly suspicious if\nthere's a much more rapid route available, rapid and\ncomfortable. If you got three kids in the car, you\ngenerally don't want a bumpy road.\nMS. BRAMBL: Well, they were going 50 to 55\nmiles per hour.\nQUESTION: I know.\nMS. BRAMBL: And there was no testimony that the\ncar was flying -- the van was flying all over the place,\nwhich -- which tells me -- and the pictures bear it out --\nis that this wasn't -- it was a dirt road and it was in a\n-- a fairly isolated area, not full of houses and -- and\nwhatnot. But this was a decent road.\nQUESTION: It's not only an isolated area, but\nthe testimony was that the people who normally used the\nroad were locals, ranchers or others, that it was not a\nroad frequently traveled by families.\nMS. BRAMBL: However, the -- that was the\ntestimony by the Border Patrol agent.\nQUESTION: Right.\nMS. BRAMBL: The investigator from our office\ntestified that this road was used and enjoyed by all kinds\nof families. The Chiricahuas are a beautiful area.\nThere are a number of areas within them that -- that are\nvisited by people from all over, and because they're\nbasically in the -- in the residents of Douglas' back\nyard, people from Douglas frequent that area. So, we\ndon't have a record as to how many sensor hits turn out to\nbe smugglers, how many turn out to be ranchers, and how\nmany turn out to be people from Douglas visiting the area.\nQUESTION: But we do have a record that suggests\nthat every time somebody trips the sensor, they go out and\ntake a look at them.\nMS. BRAMBL: That's true.\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMS. BRAMBL: And -- and it would be a shame if\n-- if every family on a road like that or on that road in\na minivan on a holiday would be subject to heightened\nscrutiny just because this happens to be a road where\nsmugglers sometimes use it. And --\nQUESTION: Is there any indication there ever\nhas been such a family? I mean, I imagine if there were\nan innocent family that happened to accidentally come from\nan area where there is a lot of smuggling, that doesn't --\nyou know, not everybody is a smuggler in such an area.\nThey drive with their family just for recreation 50 miles\nout of the way. Their children wave oddly.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: They screech to a halt, and there\nthey were, stopped. I -- I guess they would be sort of\noutraged and there might be some publicity about it. Has\nthere been such a --\nMS. BRAMBL: Well, one of the problems with --\nwith Fourth Amendment issues is that the vast majority of\ninnocent people that are protected by the Fourth Amendment\noften remain silent when they are subjected to arbitrary\nor -- or random stops.\nQUESTION: I'd feel much more sympathetic to --\nto that person than -- than I would to your client whose\n-- whose argument essentially is, yes, I was indeed a\nsmuggler, but -- and he suspected me to be a smuggler and\nhe turned out to be right. But the suspicion was not\naccurate. I don't understand that. Should we give any\nweight to the fact that he turned out to be right? Does\nthat -- does that have any bearing on whether the\nsuspicion was reasonable or not?\nMS. BRAMBL: It doesn't. In fact, if we had\nthat kind of test, then we would have no way to litigate\nreasonable suspicion issues because the only way we get to\ncourt --\nQUESTION: I'm not saying it's conclusive. I'm\njust saying, you know, I'm -- I'm more inclined to find\nthat the Border Patrol agent who stops a smuggler had a\nreasonable suspicion than I am to find that a Border\nPatrol agent who stops a -- a happy family out on outing\nhad a reasonable suspicion.\nMS. BRAMBL: Well, the problem is there weren't\nreally any factors or --\nQUESTION: How would one know about the stops of\nsomeone who is a perfectly law-abiding citizen? Nobody is\npressing charges against them. Quite the contrary. And\nvery few of them would bother with a Bivens action given\nthe qualified immunity. So, we don't hear from those\npeople. And I thought the whole idea of the Fourth\nAmendment, frankly, is that you have to protect the crooks\nbecause if you don't protect them, then the innocent, the\nlaw-abiding people will lose their protection.\nMS. BRAMBL: That's exactly right. The -- the\nFourth Amendment protects all of the law-abiding people,\nand it seems like Terry struck a balance. You -- you can\nstop people when you have reasonable suspicion, but that's\nthe floor below which you cannot go because otherwise\nyou're casting in a large universe of -- of innocent, law-\nabiding citizens who are going to be stopped. And they're\nthe people that we're concerned about in this litigation.\nAnd obviously our client is not a sympathetic\nfigure because he was doing something wrong. But all of\nthe objective factors that were available to the agent\npointed not to a smuggler running dope or aliens, but\ninstead to a family that was on an outing on a -- a lovely\nday on a -- a very scenic area.\nAll of the factors that the Ninth Circuit found\nhad some level of suspicion, the fact that it was a\nminivan, the fact that it was a road that could be used by\nsmugglers and could be used to avoid the sensor, and the\nfact that it was 45 minutes before a Border Patrol shift\nchange -- all those are really just the setting. When you\nget to the individualized factors that were listed, those\nfactors are the ones that fall short.\nQUESTION: Well, but just before the shift\nchange is an individualized factor.\nMS. BRAMBL: Well --\nQUESTION: I mean, we're not saying that anytime\nsomeone comes along this road it's suspicious. We're\nsaying it's suspicious just before the shift change.\nMS. BRAMBL: Well, it's certainly 45 minutes\nbefore a shift change when perhaps, depending on where the\nagents are out in the field, some of them may be returning\nback. But it -- it would seem inappropriate to say,\nfamilies, you better find out when Border Patrol shift\nchanges are because otherwise you won't -- you travel on\nthese roads, you're going to get stopped. And --\nQUESTION: Would you explain to me the\nsignificance of the shift change? I frankly didn't quite\nunderstand.\nMS. BRAMBL: Well, the Border Patrol claims that\nsmugglers, in general, are aware of when they change\nshifts and --\nQUESTION: But what difference would it make --\ndoes that make?\nMS. BRAMBL: Well, the thought is that smugglers\nwould then think they're getting by because all of the\nagents are at the -- at the station. The truth of it is,\nwe see this factor so often throughout the -- the\npublished cases, that it seems a strategy, if it is one,\nthat does not work because --\nQUESTION: But the idea would be that the Border\nPatrol agents were all at the checkpoint and wouldn't be\nout in the field to -- to be able to follow up on any\ninformation from the sensor.\nMS. BRAMBL: That's exactly right.\nQUESTION: But I still don't understand because\nthat would be at the moment of the change. 20 minutes\nahead of time some will be coming in, and 20 minutes after\nsome will be going out. They're still within -- within\ntime to react to a sensor, which they did.\nMS. BRAMBL: Well, sure.\nQUESTION: It still really puzzles.\nMS. BRAMBL: And that's the point we were able\nto make in the -- in the record that the -- the court of\nappeals reviewed, which is that when -- exactly when shift\nchange would occur and when the agent --\nQUESTION: Thank you, Ms. Brambl.\nMS. BRAMBL: Thank you.\nQUESTION: Mr. Schlick, you have 5 minutes left.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF AUSTIN C. SCHLICK\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. SCHLICK: Mr. Chief Justice, unless the\nCourt has further questions, we submit that the judgment\nof the court of appeals should be reversed.\nQUESTION: Tell me. Explain to me again why the\nshift change is so significant.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. SCHLICK: Certainly, Justice Stevens. The\n-- the testimony was that agents who are out in the field\nwill, as the 3:00 p.m. shift change approached, head back\nto --\nQUESTION: Right.\nMR. SCHLICK: -- the checkpoint on I-191. That\ndrive would take perhaps 45 minutes, perhaps a half hour,\nperhaps as much as an hour, depending on where they were.\nSo, during that period, a Border Patrol agent who was,\nlet's say, stationed on Leslie Canyon Road, supervising\nthe road, would be driving back.\nQUESTION: He'd be driving back, but at the same\ntime the sensors are working. If the sensor is triggered,\nthey tell him -- they say, turn around and go back, which\nis what happened to this guy. I just don't understand it.\nMR. SCHLICK: That's true. And Justice Stevens,\nyou may be thinking more clearly than smugglers. What\nsmugglers see is the absence of Border Patrol vehicles,\nand they take that as an indication that --\nQUESTION: Does the record tell us whether it\nwas generally known that there were sensors on this road?\nMR. SCHLICK: The record does not. It does not\nreveal that, no, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: I had the feeling it might be a\ndifferent case if they just put a sign up saying,\nstrangers in this area are subject to stop if they're not\n-- you know, if they're not local people. We got sensors\nthat will catch you. But if they gave them notice, I\nwonder if it would be a different case.\nMR. SCHLICK: Certainly, Justice Stevens, the\nsmugglers are well aware of the location of the checkpoint\nand the route to -- to evade it.\nQUESTION: But not of the sensors you think.\nMR. SCHLICK: I -- I can't answer that question.\nThe record doesn't reveal.\nQUESTION: Are there -- is there anything in the\nrecord that suggests at all, or anywhere, that there are\nother -- there are families, that sometimes people do use\nthis for picnics? They like sightseeing. They want to go\nup there on this old dirt road. Is there any -- any\nevidence on that at all?\nMR. SCHLICK: The record does include evidence\nthat the recreation areas off of Rucker Canyon Road -- if\nrespondent --\nQUESTION: Well, that's one of them, but there's\none further to the north. So, somebody who likes driving\non old dirt roads, as some people do, might take their\nfamily, drive up there, going further to the north. So, I\nwonder what the state of the -- any evidence at all in\nthere that -- that families who are not smugglers do use\nthis road once a week, once a day, once a month.\nAnything?\nMR. SCHLICK: No, Justice Breyer. The -- the\ntestimony was that that recreation area to the north\nexisted. There was no testimony that any particular\nnumber of -- of families do, in fact, use these roads.\nThe testimony to the contrary was that ranchers and Forest\nService personnel and the Border Patrol itself used these\nroads. The district court's finding on page 24a of the\npetition appendix was that this route was not a logical\nroute to get up to the Chiricahua National Monument.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr.\nSchlick.\n"
