SPILLARS\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMS. SPILLARS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nWhile this Court has laid out a framework\nfor reviewing prosecutors' closing arguments, the\nfairness standard established in Donnelly and Darden is\nby its nature a very general standard. Under this\nCourt's interpretation of AEDPA, the State court should\ntherefore be provided more leeway in reaching outcomes.\nNevertheless, the Eighth Circuit afforded no deference\nto the Missouri Supreme Court's decision. Instead, its\nimproperly substituted its own evaluation for the\ncomments, looking at each of them in isolation and\nwithout considering the totality of the proceedings.\nThat decision was wrong not only because the\ncourt of appeals failed to properly afford deference to\nthe State court, but because when viewed within the\nentire proceedings the prosecutor's closing arguments\ndid not deprive the Respondent of a fair trial.\nApplying AEDPA correctly, the Missouri\nSupreme Court decision was well within reason given,\none, the nonspecific standard of fundamental fairness\nand the fact that this Court has never applied that\nstandard to a penalty phase closing argument; and, two,\nbecause, considering the record in the entire\nproceedings of this case, the Respondent was not\ndeprived of fundamental fairness.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, we didn't --\nhaven't applied it to a penalty phase closing argument,\nbut we've certainly applied the general standard to the\npenalty phase.\nMS. SPILLARS: That's correct, Your Honor.\nAnd it's certainly is not our argument that it would not\napply to the penalty phase. However, there simply may\nbe other considerations, because the fundamental\nfairness standard essentially answers the question, did\nthe jury base their verdict on the evidence or did they\nbase it improperly on the prosecutor's comments.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask one sort of\npreliminary question. Supposing the prosecutor\nmisstated the law in his closing argument. Would that\nbe reviewable in this Court under AEDPA?\nMS. SPILLARS: I think it certainly could\nbe. In Brown versus Payton there was certainly a\nconcern about the --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Do you think his argument\nhere contained any misstatements of the law?\nMS. SPILLARS: No, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: You don't.\nMS. SPILLARS: To help answer the question,\nthough, in that context, Donnelly and Darden set down\nsome general considerations that, while not exclusive,\nhelp provide the post and beams of the fundamental\nfairness standard. So even assuming that all of the\nstatements were improper, those considerations when\napplied to this case show that the trial was not\nrendered unfair because of the prosecutor's argument.\nFirst, none of the comments misstated the evidence nor\ndid they misstate the law.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, just on your\nassumption, to make your hypothetical clear, you, you\nwant us to assume that three or four times at least he\nviolated a constitutional standard?\nMS. SPILLARS: No, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I just want to know what\narguendo assumption you are making.\nMS. SPILLARS: The assumption is that under\nthe first tier in Donnelly and Darden that the\nstatements were improper in the sense that within the\ncontext of the multi-factor kind of considerations,\nwhether or not they were improper, because obviously --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I mean, they'd be improper\nbecause they -- they were based on an emotional appeal\nthat's improper?\nMS. SPILLARS: It could be improper in the\nsense that it was a misstatement of evidence. I don't\nknow that impropriety would include necessarily\nemotional appeal. I mean, the Constitution does not\nrequire a trial devoid of emotion. However, impropriety\nunder Donnelly and Darden was the first tier of the\nmulti-tier kind of Fundamental fairness test. So even\nassuming that that first tier, that the statements were\nimproper, they still did not rise to the level of\nfundamental unfairness.\nSecondly, none of the individual comments\nimplicated the defendant's rights under the Fifth or\nSixth Amendment, nor were they of the very specific kind\nof comments that this Court has found to violate the\nEighth Amendment under Caldwell.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Don't you think the\nargument based on the General Patton analogy told the\njurors they had a duty to do what he suggested?\nMS. SPILLARS: No, Your Honor. I would\ndisagree.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: What is the relevance of\nthat argument otherwise?\nMS. SPILLARS: I would not -- it was not\nparticularly relevant. It was probably an inartful\nattempt to imply or tell the jury that it was a\ndifficult decision that they had ahead of them, one that\nthey might --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Do you think if he said in\nso many words, you have a duty to return the death\npenalty, that would have been a misstatement of the law?\nMS. SPILLARS: Yes, a duty to return the\ndeath penalty, which certainly is a misstatement of the\nlaw.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And you don't think this\ncould be so interpreted? You don't think you could\ninterpret that, that passage, that way?\nMS. SPILLARS: No, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: That passage was in the\ncontext of other statements in which I think it's fair\nto say that he analogized the role of the juror to the\nrole of a soldier who has to have the courage and the\nduty to kill.\nMS. SPILLARS: I think a reasonable\ninterpretation of those statements could be that the\nduty was to make the decision whether or not to impose\nthe death penalty.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Wait. Why is it improper\nfor, for the prosecution to argue that, given the facts\nof this case, given the aggravating factors and the lack\nof mitigating factors, the brutality of the crime, the\nonly sensible decision for you ladies and gentlemen of\nthe jury is the death penalty? That's an improper\nargument? Doesn't that amount to saying you have a duty\nto come back with the death penalty? Why can't the\nprosecution argue that?\nMS. SPILLARS: It's certainly not improper\nto make statements based on inferences from the\nevidence.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, do you think the\nPatton argument has anything to do with the evidence? I\nmean, the Patton argument -- correct me if I'm wrong,\nbut I thought the argument that referred to General\nPatton was an argument that, number one, talked about\nhis addressing the troops before battle. And he was\ntelling the troops that unfortunately it is sometimes\ntheir duty to kill. And he said: Go out there and do\nyour duty, which I assume any reasonable listener would\nsay, go out there and kill.\nIf a prosecutor, as in this case, tells that\nstory and uses that analogy, it seems to me that the\nargument is not an argument based on evidence, but an\nargument based upon the situation, the situation of the\njurors vis a vis a capital defendant.\nAnd I would suppose that the reasonable\ninference from the argument is that they have a duty to\ngo out there to kill, to impose the death penalty. That\ndoes not sound to me like an argument based upon the\nevidence specific to this defendant and specific to this\ncase.\nNow, am I wrong?\nMS. SPILLARS: No, Your Honor. It certainly\nwas not a statement on the evidence in sense of was it a\ndiscussion of the facts in the case. However, based on\nthe totality of the entire proceedings, it's clear that\nthat statement did not render the entire trial unfair\nbecause --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't understand your\nconcession. Surely, the prosecutor was not telling this\njury that in all capital cases you have to come in with\na death verdict. Surely, although he didn't explicitly\nmention the evidence, the underlying premise of his\nargument was sometimes when you have a case this bad,\nyou have to do your duty. Nobody likes to kill, but\njust as soldiers sometimes have to do that if that's\ntheir duty, so also jurors, if you really believe that\nthe evidence is so one-sided in favor of the penalty\nthat the State is asking for, it's your duty to bring\nthe death verdict. I don't see anything wrong with\nthat.\nMS. SPILLARS: And Your Honor, to the extent\nthat I would certainly agree that those arguments based\non the strength of the case were not necessarily --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I suppose your concession\nabout the duty is based on Chief Justice Stone's opinion\nin Viereck, isn't it?\nMS. SPILLARS: Well, in the sense that\nViereck was not directly --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Which did involve the very\nword \"duty.\"\nMS. SPILLARS: I'm sorry?\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Chief justice Stone's\nopinion in Viereck talked about telling the jury that\nthey have a duty and condemned that. That's probably\nwhy you made the concession, I think.\nMS. SPILLARS: I think the concession is\nimportant to get beyond the statements in isolation,\nbecause --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: It's not just in\nisolation. Didn't this prosecutor constantly say this\ncase is not about Weaver, this case is larger than\nWeaver. I think several times in the closing the jurors\nwere told: Think big, think the large picture, don't\nthink about this individual.\nMS. SPILLARS: Yes. However, the jury was\nalso told that it was their discretion to spare his life\nat appendix 275.\nJUSTICE BREYER: It is -- I agree with you,\nI agree with you that we should look at the whole\npicture. When I look at the whole picture -- I've\nactually got a little chart that my law clerk prepared.\nAnd what he did, he went through this and looked at a\ncase called Newlon and it was the same prosecutor. And\nthe prosecutor was told in that case just what he\nshouldn't do. And now if we look what he did in this\ncase and look what he did in that case and look at the\nlaw, the whole thing, not just little bits, it looks\nlike he did an awful lot of what he wasn't supposed to\ndo.\nYou're not supposed to give an argument that\nvouches as the U.S. attorney that I think that this is\nwhat you should do. So in Newlon he says: I'm talking\nto you as prosecuting attorney of the county, the top\nlaw enforcement officer. And here he says: I'm the top\nlaw enforcement officer and I decide in which cases we\nhave the death penalty and not. Worse than Newlon, I\nwould say.\nThen what you're not supposed to do is\nyou're not supposed to tell them they're like soldiers.\nI mean, there's Supreme Court cases that say, don't tell\nthem you're like a soldier doing duty. At least that's\nwhat all these prosecutors -- a case called Byron versus\nthe United States. So in Newlon what he says is: I\nwant to impress on you, this is a war and it's\njustifiable to kill in war. Here he says: As in the\nmovie \"Patton\" and in the movie George Patton is talking\nto his troops because they're going out in battle like\nthe soldiers. And then he says: And when you're a\nsoldier, you know what to do when you put your hand in a\npile of goo that a moment before was your best friend's\nface; you'll know what to do; and last July this\ndefendant's face was a pile of goo.\nOkay, there we are. I mean, that sounds\npretty emotional. It sounds like a soldier does his\nduty and you're doing it.\nAnd then another thing you're not supposed\nto do is you're not supposed to tell them it's their\nduty to the community. And this is just filled with\ninstances where you hardly even know that there's a\nperson called Weaver because he says: What you have to\ndo here is send a message to the drug lords, send a\nmessage --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Who said he was not\nsupposed to do these things?\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, there's a brief --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry, counsel.\nMaybe, counsel, if you could answer that question?\nMS. SPILLARS: In Newlon, Your Honor, it was\na due process case which the same prosecutor tried, and\nit was an Eighth Circuit case. And in that --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And is that the law here?\nMS. SPILLARS: No, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: It's not? Why did they\nfile -- is this brief wrong, then, the brief of the\nformer prosecutors giving the propositions that I just\nstated and have the Supreme Court case next to each one?\nAre they wrong, those prosecutors?\nMS. SPILLARS: To the extent that Newlon\nsets out those arguments, no, that's not incorrect.\nThose arguments were made in Newlon. However, for two\nreasons Newlon is distinguishable. In this case there\nwere curative instructions given to the jury. In Newlon\nthere were no objections made. So in this case, when\nthe prosecutor made the statement, for example, that,\nI'm the top law enforcement officer, there was an\nobjection and there was a curative instruction. So it\nwas not --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Was there with the Patton\nand the goo?\nMS. SPILLARS: There was not an objection --\nthere was an objection to the Patton, but it was\noverruled.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Was there a curative\ninstruction?\nMS. SPILLARS: No, there was not.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, I'm looking\nat the quote, the statement, the reference to Patton,\nand I have to say I don't read it as imposing a duty.\nIt says what the prosecutor says is that sometimes\nyou've got to kill and sometimes you've got to risk\ndeath because it's right. His point is that at some\npoint, at some times, you have to impose death because\nit's right, not because it's your duty as a soldier.\nNow, where is the reference to you have this\nduty as a soldier in the prosecutor's statements?\nMS. SPILLARS: There is none, Your Honor.\nAnd a reasonable interpretation of that comment is that\nhe was imparting to the jury the duty to make the\ndecision, not necessarily to impose the death penalty.\nJUSTICE BREYER: In Viereck the words were:\n\"This is war, harsh, cruel, murderous war.\" And the\nprosecutor went on to analogize the jury's duties to the\nduties of soldiers and he said: Do your duty. Do you\nthink that's a lot different than this case?\nMS. SPILLARS: Well, I would distinguish\nViereck on two grounds. One, it was not directly a due\nprocess case as this case is raised, because it was\nraised under this Court's supervisory powers. Secondly,\nin this case there was -- out of the eight separate\ncomments that the Eighth Circuit found improper, only\nthree of them were actually objected to, two of which\nwere sustained and curative instructions were given.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But you just -- that's a\nbit inconsistent with your point that Newlon is\ndistinguishable because there were no objections at all\nand that was the reason for the court saying this goes\ntoo far to the prosecutor. But now you say when there\nare objections --\nMS. SPILLARS: In Newlon the jury was never\ntold to disregard the statements. In our case the jury\nwas told to disregard the statements.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Certain statements.\nThere are were many objections made here that were\noverruled.\nMS. SPILLARS: Correct. There were 12\nobjections made total. Interestingly, though, the\ndefense attorney did not raise objections to the\nmajority of the comments that the Eighth Circuit found\nimproper. Now, while that's not dispositive, I think\nthat the defense attorney is certainly in the best\nposition to judge whether or not a comment prejudices\nhis client.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: To that extent the two\ncases were the same because in Newlon there were no\nobjections either.\nMS. SPILLARS: No objections at all. There\nwere no objections at all. In our case there were 12\nobjections, so clearly the defense attorney was on the\nmark and was listening for prejudicial comments from the\nprosecutor. Of the eight comments that the Eighth\nCircuit found objectionable in this case, only three of\nthem were objected to.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Do you think --\nMR. SPILLARS: So assuming that the defense\nattorney was -- I'm sorry.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: There were two cases\ncited as involving the same prosecutor? Was it Shurn\nalso?\nMS. SPILLARS: Correct.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And that there was a\nsignificant overlap in the three charges in the three\ncases. The prosecutor had been told in two of them, you\nwent too far. In this one, just in terms of what the\nprosecutor said in the closing argument, is this less\noffensive or would you say they're all on a par?\nMS. SPILLARS: I would actually -- if you\ncompare the three arguments side by side, the\nprosecutor's statements were tempered in this case. The\ndecision -- when he tried this case, it was\napproximately five weeks after the district court in\nNewlon had come down with the decision.\nAnd there are statements that he made in\nNewlon and Shurn that were not in this case. For\nexample, in Newlon he said this is the worst case ever\nand in Shurn he said the same thing. He did he not say\nthat in this case. So I think from -- if you do a side\nby side comparison, his statements were actually\ntempered.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Could you tell us -- as\nyou know, AEDPA has the decisions of settled precedents\nof the Supreme Court and there's the Supreme Court\nstandard, a very general standard that we can get from\nDarden and Donnelly, although we didn't reverse there.\nI take it that the counsel for the\nRespondent is going to say: Well, this is a Federal\nstandard, but the Eighth Circuit is entitled to apply\nthe specificity and the application that it's given to\nthis, so the Eighth Circuit's entitled to rely on its\ncases in reversing.\nDo you agree with that?\nMS. SPILLARS: No, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I assume that's what\nthey're going to tell us.\nMS. SPILLARS: No, Your Honor, I would not\nagree.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Why.\nMS. SPILLARS: Clearly, it's not established\nlaw by this Court, and this Court has not specifically\noutlined the kind of post and beam that would result in\na reversal in a penalty phase Closing argument.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It says that in the text,\ndoesn't it, \"clearly established by the Supreme Court\"?\nIs that not in the text of the statute?\nMS. SPILLARS: Correct, yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So those things that are\nimproper for a prosecutor to make in summing up in the\nguilt phase, are they then proper to say, exactly those\nthings, in a sentencing phase with capital -- with --\nyou know, capital sentencing?\nMS. SPILLARS: Is it the same, the same\narguments in the --\nJUSTICE BREYER: There are a number of cases\nin this Court that say what a prosecutor can't say,\nguilt phase. All of them happen to be guilt phase, I\nguess. You can't, you know, vouch. You can't use too\nmuch emotion. You have to focus on what the defendant\ndid, not on what somebody else did. I mean, there are a\nnumber of things.\nNow, do those -- is it fair or not fair to\nsay that those precedents apply in the capital\nsentencing phase, too?\nMS. SPILLARS: I think it is fair to say\nthat. But it is also fair to say that there may be\nother considerations that apply in the penalty phase\nthat don't necessarily apply in the guilt phase.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask you this\nquestion about your position: We are trying to find\ncases that clearly establish law by decisions of this\nCourt. Do you include in that group of cases, cases\nsuch as Berger against the United States, and Viereck\nagainst the United States, which were direct review of\nFederal cases in which they say there was a denial of\nthe fair trial, but they're not setting aside State\ncases?\nWould it be proper for the Court of Appeals\nto rely on those cases?\nMS. SPILLARS: No. And this is why.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Even though those cases\nsay in so many words it deprives you of a fair trial.\nMS. SPILLARS: No. Because of the very\nspecific nature of the supervisory powers in those\ncases, I don't believe that in the larger context, the\nfinal standards, that we can say that those directly\napply.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If those direct\nFederal cases were interpreting the constitutional\nprovisions directly, they would count as established\nlaw?\nMS. SPILLARS: Certainly, yes, Your Honor.\nThere was also no mechanism in this case for\nthe jury to apply any of the improper remarks to their\ndeliberations because they were properly instructed.\nInstructions which we presume that they followed. In\nthis case, the court read the instructions to the jury\nbefore closing arguments, and a copy was also given to\nthe jury to deliberate with.\nFour of those instructions, numbers 21, 28,\n26, and 27, told the jury in various forms that it was\ntheir duty, and theirs alone, to render a verdict. The\njury was also told in instructions 23, 24, and 26 that\nit was -- that their decision must be within the\nconfines of the evidence.\nAnd thirdly, within the specific process\nlaid out for finding ways -- mitigating and aggravating\ncircumstances. And finally, the last instruction that\nthe jury heard before closing arguments was that closing\narguments were not evidence.\nIt is counterintuitive to assume that the\njury disregarded those instructions as a whole and\ninstead improperly relied on the prosecutor's closing\nargument when they declined to find the one aggravating\ncircumstance that the prosecutor spoke most about.\nAt appendix 285 is the part of the closing\nargument where the prosecutor discussed the aggravating\ncircumstances. He argued to the jury that all four\napplied, but spent most time speaking about number one,\nwhich was that he had killed for money.\nHowever, the jury did not find aggravator\nnumber 1. So the very aggravator that the prosecutor\nargued most about to the jury, they did not find.\nIt's more reasonable to conclude that the\njury made its decision based on the strength of the\nevidence and the strong evidence in support of the death\npenalty.\nHaving rejected the misidentification\ndefense, the jury necessarily found that the respondent\nwas the passenger who had returned to the woods to shoot\nthe victim several more times.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I go back to my\nquestion? Because there's a legal question here about\nwhat law we can look to under AEDPA. And actually, of\ncourse, it is a question of whether AEDPA applies, I\nsuppose. Because actually, wasn't this habeas petition\nfiled two days before AEDPA was -- there's a footnote in\nthe red brief that says -- raises that question.\nMS. SPILLARS: There was a habeas petition\nfiled prior to AEDPA, but it was dismissed and he did\nnot appeal from that. This was filed after AEDPA.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: That was a slip on the\nDistrict Court's part, wasn't it? I mean, that original\npetition that was dismissed because he had filed a cert\npetition to this Court should not have been dismissed,\nit should have been held, in which case the petition\nwould have been timely and would not have been trumped\nby an AEDPA variant.\nMS. SPILLARS: However, Your Honor, he did\nnot appeal from that.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, didn't he seek a\nCOA?\nMS. SPILLARS: Yes, he did. However, he did\nnot appeal --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: This is a pro se prisoner.\nHe gets his -- all the claims are exhausted, it's\ndismissed. And he seeks a COA on that point.\nMS. SPILLARS: However, the parties have --\nthe respondent has not asserted that argument, that\nAEDPA does not apply in this case. And for good reason,\nbecause --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Certainly didn't say it in\nthe brief in opposition. And we might not well have\ntaken the case had that point been raised in the BIL.\nMS. SPILLARS: That's correct, Your Honor.\nFinally, given the overwhelming evidence --\nit supported a finding that the respondent had carried\nout an execution style murder for the purpose of\nsilencing a witness. I'll preserve --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this question\nbefore you sit down? In the Viereck opinion, Chief\nJustice Stone reversed in that case. And one of the\nreasons was the prosecutor indulged in an appeal wholly\nirrelevant to any facts or issues in the case, the\npurpose and effect of which could only have been to\narouse passion and prejudice. That's part of our\nFederal law. Is that law applicable in this case, do\nyou think?\nMS. SPILLARS: Not directly, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, it is either\ndirectly -- it's either yes or no.\nMS. SPILLARS: I think certainly this Court\ncan use --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: That rule can be ignored\nby State prosecutors?\nMS. SPILLARS: Certainly not ignored, Your\nHonor. But in the context of fundamental fairness, as\nto whether or not that case applies, I would argue that\nit does not directly apply.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You have a much more\nlimited point, as I understand it. Your more limited\npoint is simply that this is not clearly established law\npronounced by the Supreme Court.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, it is --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: In this area of\nconstitutional violation.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, the question, I\nsuppose, is whether that is a constitutional rule. It\nis established by the Supreme Court of the United\nStates, an opinion written by Chief Justice Stone a good\nmany years ago. But you're argument is it is not\napplicable to State prosecutors, as I understand it.\nMS. SPILLARS: Not necessarily not\napplicable to State prosecutors. However, in the\ncontext of fundamental fairness, does it establish a\nclear -- a rule in the sense of those kinds of\nstatements will render a trial fundamentally --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Why would it be applicable\nto State prosecutors if it is not a rule. I don't\nunderstand that. Is it applicable to a State prosecutor\nor not? If a state prosecutor asked you for your\nadvice, is this opinion applicable. And you tell him\nyes or no.\nMS. SPILLARS: Certainly, it is something\nthat State prosecutors should follow in the sense of\nwhat they should say and what they should not say.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But they must follow\nbecause it's the law, right?\nMS. SPILLARS: Under the -- it is not the\nlaw in the sense of fundamental fairness. It is\ncertainly an indication of what --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, where did Chief\nJustice Stone get it from?\nMS. SPILLARS: I'm sorry?\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Where did Chief Justice\nStone get it from? Just because of our supervisory\npower? I mean, if it's just Federal supervisory power,\nthen I think you could tell the counsel, he doesn't have\nto follow it, it's due process.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You can't have it both\nways, counsel. I mean, you're really losing me here.\nEither it is our supervisory power and therefore the\nStates don't have to follow it, or it is more than our\nsupervisory power and the States do have to follow it.\nI don't know that there's any way to straddle that.\nMS. SPILLARS: Well, I would argue that in\nthose cases, it is a supervisory power case. And so to\nthat extent, it's not applicable to this particular\ncase.\nI'll reserve.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Blume?\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN H. BLUME\nON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT\nMR. BLUME: Mr. Chief Justice, may it please\nthe Court:\nAs the former prosecutor's brief makes\nclear, George \"Buzz\" Westfall's penalty phase closing\nargument in Mr. Weaver's case contained a number of\nimproper and mutually reinforcing statements which\nexploited the authority of his office, analogized the\njury's duties to that of soldiers in war time, injected\nextraneous matters into the proceedings, and appealed to\nthe jurors' passions and prejudice.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, I think they\noverstated the significance of Viereck. Isn't Viereck\n-- does Viereck stand, do you think, for a per se rule\nthat a prosecutor in a closing argument may never\nmention the word soldier? Isn't that a much more\nlimited -- much more limited holding?\nThis was a prosecution during World War II\nof individuals for failing to register as agents of Nazi\nGermany, and the prosecutor said in the guilt phase --\nand it wasn't a capital case obviously, in the guilt\nphase of closing argument, that just as our soldiers who\nare fighting the Japanese on the Bataan Peninsula are\ndoing their duty for the country, you have a duty to\nreturn a guilty verdict against these individuals.\nNow, isn't that very different from saying\nthat in a capital -- at the capital phase of the trial,\nyou have a duty to consider something that's very\nunpleasant, and it's unpleasant in the same way that\nwhat soldiers have to do in war time is different?\nIsn't that very different?\nMR. BLUME: I think the historical context\nis different, but this was set up in this case by\ninforming the jurors that we were involved in a war, in\na war on drugs in society. And then he uses the same\nstory, analogizing jurors' responsibilities to that of\nsoldiers in a war. I think it is also important to put\nthat comment in the context in which it occurred. Not\nonly in the broader context and the repeated -- the\nprosecutor repeatedly leveraging the power of his office\nbehind this, but this came right on the heels of him\nsaying, I'm the top law enforcement officer in this\ncounty. I decide in which cases we seek the death\npenalty.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That was objected to\nand the objection was sustained, correct?\nMR. BLUME: It was objected to, and the\nobjection was sustained. That doesn't mean that\ncomment --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And a curative instruction\ngiven.\nMR. BLUME: I agree with that. But that\ndoesn't mean it's irrelevant for the due process\ntotality of circumstances analysis. And then he\nproceeds from there directly in to the Patton analogy,\nand I think if you read that analogy in context, he is\ntelling them you're soldiers in a war, you have a duty\nto kill, I'm like Patton, I'm telling you it's your duty\nto kill, go kill.\nIf you read that logically --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Which in that case,\nAEDPA says we look to clearly established law by our\nU.S. Supreme Court decisions. Which is the clearest\nU.S. Supreme Court decision that was violated here?\nMR. BLUME: The decision that was violated\nwas the rule of Darden, Donnelly, and Romano, which is\nthat --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, pick which one\ndo you think is the most directly applicable.\nMR. BLUME: Well, I think Darden established\nthe rule. This Court applied it to the penalty phase in\nRomano, and thus the Darden rule that if a prosecutor's\ncomments, the totality --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's not Romano.\nRomano was an introduction of evidence case, right?\nMR. BLUME: Yes, but logically, if you have\nestablished a rule for closing arguments, you\nestablished it, you then say it is applicable to the\npenalty phase for the admission of evidence, it would be\ncompletely illogical to say it didn't govern penalty\nphase closing arguments.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: My point is simply\nthe level of generality at which the guiding principles\nwere articulated, which helps when you're applying it,\nbut in determining -- it is the point Judge Bowman in\ndissent that when you don't have a case that's close,\nthat you have more leeway in terms of the deference to\nthe Court, because it's not a clearly established\nprecedent of the Supreme Court.\nYes, there are the Jenner cases that\nestablish the general principles, but the question is\nhow clearly those were contravened before you can say it\nviolated clearly established law.\nMR. BLUME: That is what this Court's\ndecisions say, Chief Justice Roberts. I think I want to\nmake clear that we have two different positions on that.\nThe first is that any State court decision finding this\nargument in its totality based on what happened and\nbased on the weight of the evidence in this case that\nsaid that didn't render the proceedings fundamentally\nunfair would be an unreasonable application of Darden\nand Donnelly.\nBut in addition to that, the Missouri\nSupreme Court in this case said the decision was\nunreasonable because it failed to consider significant\nportions of Mr. Weaver's challenge to this argument. It\ndid the analysis under a State law abuse of discretion\nstandard, and it refused to consider or failed to\nconsider several components of his claim.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What do you mean, how do\nyou it failed to consider? I mean, is there an\nobligation to respond to every single point that's made?\nMR. BLUME: Well --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Did they refuse to accept\nargument on those points?\nMR. BLUME: No. But they -- on the first\npoint, did they refuse to -- did they fail to consider a\nnumber of the challenges like the Patton analogy, that's\nclear. He raised that in his brief. He said this was\nsomething I'm complaining about. They did not consider\nit. He raised the point about --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: If they did consider it,\nyou mean they did not respond to that argument in their\nopinion.\nMR. BLUME: They did not refer to it in\ntheir opinion.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You don't know for sure\nthat they didn't consider it. I mean, it may be\nargument to them. How could they not have considered\nit? They must have not considered it important, but\nthat's a different --\nMR. BLUME: He also raised the point about\nthis is bigger than William Weaver. And that was\nimproper. And when the State court cited what he said,\nthey chose to ellipses that out, and didn't even put in\n--\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, why is that improper?\nIs it improper at the penalty phase for a prosecutor to\nrefer to the concept of deterrence, which by definition\nis bigger than the individual whose sentence is being\nconsidered?\nMR. BLUME: I don't think this can properly\nbe considered a deterrence argument. When you say over\nand over, this is far more important than William\nWeaver, this goes way beyond William Weaver, this is\nbigger than William Weaver, this doesn't just pertain to\nWilliam Weaver, then you add that in with the number of\ncomments about you need to give this person the death\npenalty --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, could a prosecutor\nsay, one of the factors you must take into account when\nyou begin to deliberate is the deterrent purpose of the\ndeath penalty? Deterrence is one of the reasons we have\nthe death penalty.\nMR. BLUME: Uh-huh.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: To teach us. Can he say\nthat?\nMR. BLUME: I think he could say that.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So then now we have the\nprinciple that you can talk about deterrence. Now it is\njust the way in which he talked about deterrence?\nMR. BLUME: No, my point is I don't believe\nthis is really a deterrence argument. Deterrence is not\na substitute for moral culpability. We allow the\ndeterrent function of the death penalty as a\njustification for it, but you couldn't give the death\npenalty to somebody who didn't deserve it under the\nState's scheme, in order to further deterrence.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: As I recall, he didn't just\nsay it is bigger than Weaver. He went on to discuss,\nyou know, the drug gangs. And he says, they're not\ngoing to be affected by the threat of going to prison.\nThey will be affected by the threat of dying.\nIt seemed to me he tied it very, very\nclosely into deterrence. And if you say that deterrence\nis okay for him to refer to, I don't know how there's\nanything left to your argument about his saying it's\nbigger than Weaver.\nMR. BLUME: I think the import of this\nargument is you should give the person the death penalty\neven if you're not sure he deserves it in order to\nfurther the deterrent function of the death penalty.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, but you're -- you're\nsaying look, he can make a general statement that we\nhave a death penalty in part for its deterrent function,\nbut he cannot make the argument that you ought to apply\nthe death penalty in this case solely for deterrent\nreasons, i.e., reasons unanchored in the culpability of\nthis particular defendant.\nMR. BLUME: That's correct. Not because,\nwhat this statement did. Especially --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Where? Where? Where?\nWhere? Where does it say that? Where does it say never\nmind the facts? Let's, let's give this guy the death\npenalty as a Napoleon said, \"Por encourage les autres.\"\nYou know, he said it didn't matter which, whether the\ngeneral was guilty of, of cowardice or not; it would\nhelp to encourage the others to execute him. Where is\nthere anything like that argument here? I don't see it.\nMR. BLUME: I think that us the logical\ninference from the six or seven times he says -- in\nvariety of -- he says this is bigger than William\nWeaver. The one thing you've got to understand is this\nis far more important than William Weaver; this is, goes\nway beyond William Weaver; this does not pertain just to\nWilliam Weaver. He says that on six or eight occasions.\nAnd I think you could interpret that -- the logical\ninterpretation --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: If you let a person who is\nas guilty as William Weaver go, you're affecting not\njust William Weaver, you're affecting the whole war on\ndrugs, you're affecting the -- what's wrong with that?\nI -- I fail to see any indication here that\nhe's telling the jury never mind the facts. Never mind\nhow -- you know -- how horrible you think the crime was.\nNever mind all of the instructions that the judge gives\nyou about aggravating factors and mitigating factors.\nForget all of that. Kill William Weaver because it's\nbigger than him.\nI -- I just don't -- I just don't see the\nargument.\nMR. BLUME: Of course, he does actually say\nkill him now at another point in there. But I think if\nyou take those comments, you also look at those in the\ncontext of where he goes on and on about the\nconsequences; you need to send a message to the drug\ndealers, that's a huge theme --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: What do you think, go on\nand on -- suppose he'd mentioned deterrence six times?\nMR. BLUME: I think as long as it is a\nblanket sort of statement, that one purpose of the death\npenalty is deterrence, that would probably be consistent\nwith this Court's decisions.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Right.\nMR. BLUME: That's not what is happening\nhere, Justice Kennedy, especially when it is tied in to\nthat, to send a message and then he also goes on to talk\nabout the consequences. If you don't sentence this\nperson to death, then the animals will reign in the\njungle and we can't have that in a civilized society and\nthere's no point in having jurors, the dope peddlers\nprevail. You put all that together, he is telling these\npeople as the prosecutor in this county. If you don't\ngive this person the death penalty there will be all\nthese adverse social consequences.\nAnd you wrap all this up; there is no\nconscientious prosecute who could possibly believe that\nthese statements were proper. No.\nThis argument is an outlier; it is beyond\nthe bounds; it contains essentially improper comments in\nvirtually every category that this Court --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So Judge -- Judge\nBowman would be an unreasonable prosecutor? He\ndissented; he thought these were not unreasonable on the\nbasis of on clearly established law.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought Judge Bowman\nsaid were it not for AEDPA this case might come out --\nin his view this case might have come out differently.\nMR. BLUME: Judge Bowman --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The standard is\nunreasonable in light of clearly established law.\nMR. BLUME: Judge Bowman did say that. But\nI believe the essence of his dissent was that, I think\nthat he made the mistake which the Petitioners made in\nthe cert petition, and he thought that there was no\nclearly established Federal law. A point which is\nessentially conceded at this point in the proceedings.\nI wanted to --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well no, he\nspecifically recognized there was nothing on all fours\nand that there these other generally applicable\ndecisions and he thought the state courts had broad -- a\nbroader range when there was no decision on all fours.\nMR. BLUME: Well, if I'm -- I'm sorry --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm reading at the\nbottom of page 820 in the petition appendix.\nMR. BLUME: Well, if I'm wrong about that,\nI'm wrong. But even -- I don't think it is also under\nJustice O'Connor's opinion in williams versus Taylor,\nyou don't have to, this doesn't works at the level of\nsaying well, any one judge is unreasonable. The point\nis, it's an objective standard, not is this judge, you\nknow, somehow out of touch here?\nAnd I think -- so -- I wanted to make one\npoint before I forge about it, to correct one thing that\nPetitioner said. Mr. Weaver filed this prior to the\nact. It was dismissed. He did request counsel and a\nCOA. He did appeal this in the Eighth Circuit in his\nfirst appeal.\nHe appealed the improper dismissal of his\npetition. The district court initially granted the writ\non Batson grounds. He appealed the fact that it should\nbe -- his case should not be subject to the act --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: You have this only in a\nfootnote in your reply brief. It wasn't raised in the\nBIO.\nMR. BLUME: It was not raised in the BIO. I\ndid not represent Mr. Weaver at that time. But I\nthought it was my obligation as an officer of the court\nto raise this at the earliest possible opportunity.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Can I ask you, where -- one\nof the passages that I thought went a little far where\nis he says to the jury, the one thing you've have got to\ninto your head; this is far more important than William\nWeaver. This case goes far beyond William Weaver. This\ntouches all the dope peddlers and the murderers in the\nworld. That's the message you have to send. It just\ndoesn't pertain to William Weaver. It pertains to all\nof us, the community. The message -- there are street,\net cetera.\nOkay. Now. That struck me, as you argue\nthis is rather extreme. Its seems to be removing the\nattention of the jury from William Weaver and saying you\nhave a duty to send this man for other reasons. Now --\nto execute him.\nBut where do I find in the U.S. reports the\ncase or statement that then says this is the kind of\nargument the prosecutor cannot make?\nMR. BLUME: Okay. Let me -- I want to back\nup, and I want to take on the premise of the question.\nWhich may be a mistake, but I think in determining, the\nfirst part of the Donnelly/Darden standard is you look\nat what the prosecutor argued and whether it was\nimproper.\nI don't believe you have to have a United\nStates Supreme Court case directly on point for\neverything the prosecutor said on that. There are\ndecisions from this Court on a number of things he said.\nThere are also other touchstones, for example, the\nstandards on criminal justice which regulate what\nprosecutors can say.\nThen the way I understand this clearly\nestablished Federal law to work, is you take what the\nprosecutor said, you examine that in light of what\nhappened, what defense counsel did, what the trial judge\ndid, and the weight of the overall evidence.\nAnd if you believe that the prosecutor's\narguments rendered the proceedings fundamentally unfair,\nthen there's a violation of the due process clause. I\ndon't think I have -- you have to show that there's some\nSupreme Court case directly on point going to each\nparticular comment.\nJUSTICE BREYER: You were talking --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Even -- even the Supreme\nCourt cases going to the other points, they didn't --\ndid any of them involve a separate penalty phase? They\nwere all just in the guilt, guilt phase of a non-capital\ncase, weren't they?\nMR. BLUME: Well --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So that, so that when the\nprosecutor was urging particular action, he was urging\nthe jury to find a person guilty. He was not just\nurging them what penalty is better or worse. He was\nsaying for these reasons you should find the individual\nguilty.\nThat's quite different it seems to me from\nthe situation in which guilt has already been\nestablished. The trial's done. This person is guilty,\nand the only thing they're arguing about is what the\npenalty ought to be. I'm not sure that you can\nanalogize, you know, from the one situation to the other\nin determining what kind of argument is proper. Because\nin the former situation when the -- if the prosecutor\nsays this is not just about this defendant, it's about\nthe whole society, he's urging the jury to find the\nperson guilty. I mean -- and that's crazy. You don't\nfind the person guilty in order to stop drug\ntrafficking.\nBut you do impose a heavier penalty in order\nto do that. So I just don't, don't see the analogy from\nthe Supreme Court cases you have.\nMR. BLUME: Well, I think that, I don't see\nany reason why a principle which this Court has\nrepeatedly reaffirmed that a prosecutor is not supposed\nto leverage his opinion and the prestige of his office\nbehind a particular outcome, would apply any less at the\npenalty phase of a capital trial than at the guilt phase\nof a capital trial.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's different. Look --\nit could -- could -- would defense counsel be able to\nargue during the guilt phase of the trial, in an\nordinary trial where there's no separate phase, \"ladies\nand gentlemen of the jury, this person has a large\nfamily that's dependent on him; he's a miserable wretch.\nYou shouldn't find him guilt. Is there no mercy in your\nheart?\"\nWould he be allowed to argue that? Of\ncourse not. Can he argue it in a guilt phase? Of\ncourse he can. And it seems to me in determining what\narguments the prosecution can make you have to be guided\nby what arguments the defense can make.\nThe defense can surely come in and say\nladies and gentlemen of the jury, you're being called\nupon to kill somebody. Do you realize what a -- what a\ndifficult, overwhelming thing that is?\nAnd then you say the prosecution can't come\nin and say ladies and gentlemen, sometimes if you do\nyour duty, you have to kill. This is the law here. If\nyou find the facts this way, that's your duty.\nI -- I -- I think you're, you're taking hard\ncases very much out of context by applying cases that\nrelate to the guilt phase, to a very special procedure\nthat we've set up in capital cases which is called the\nguilt -- uh, the penalty phase.\nMR. BLUME: Well, I disagree with that, and\nto this extent. Can a lawyer in a capital case argue at\nthe sentencing phase of the capital trial you should not\nsentence this person to death because they've had a hard\nlife? Yes. Of course you can. And why can you do\nthat? Because according to this Court's cases, that\ngoes directly to the individual's moral culpability and\nwhether they deserve the death penalty.\nThe problem with many of the arguments which\nwere made in this case is they are fundamentally\ninconsistent with the individual's moral blameworthiness\nand they can the jury to impose the death penalty in\norder to stop larger issues, to stop crime, to protect\nsociety.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: To -- to send a\nmessage?\nMR. BLUME: To send a message. And if you\ndon't send a message, chaos will prevail and the animals\nwill reign in the jungle.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What the defense\nlawyer said to the jury in his closing was if you vote\nfor life, you are sending a message. He said if you\nvote for life, you are still doing your duty.\nMR. BLUME: Yes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How was that\nmessage -- a different message, I guess, but he can\nsay send a message, but the prosecutor can't?\nMR. BLUME: No. I think the important -- by\nthe time defense counsel said that, the prosecutor in\nhis opening statement had already made the send a\nmessage statement about five times. She was trying in\nthat one limited instance to tackle that and say well,\nokay, if you give him life that's a message, too.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So if the prosecution had\nnot opened the door, that would have been improper? You\noverrule -- the judge said counsel, you can't argue\nabout sending a message for life?\nMR. BLUME: I think that would have been\ncompletely within the trial court's discretion.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: You -- you think the trial\ncourt could tell the defense counsel that the defense\ncounsel cannot argue to the jury, ladies and gentlemen\nthere is nothing more precious than life and that's what\nwe're asking you to decide here and we want you to\nassert the values of this community that we value life?\nYou can't say that?\nMR. BLUME: Maybe. But I think that what\nshe -- but what she's saying here, though, is directly\nresponsive. And that is also a factor which this Court\nhas noted in its decisions.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Suppose that you said\nexplicitly, the prosecutor -- which he didn't say -- but\nyou're arguing basically, it is a fair, sort of an\nimplication, suppose he said there are a lot of drug\ndealers around, and he's one of them. And this\nsentencing phase isn't about just -- just isn't about\nWilliam Weaver. It is about sending a message to the\nothers.\nAnd if you execute him, even if you think he\nshouldn't be executed, you don't think he ever should\nbe, but, you see, others will think that this is a\nmessage. So do it just to give a message. Even if you\nthink he never did it. No matter what you think of him,\nyou think he's the best person in the world. Still\nexecute him just to send a message.\nNow would that violate the Constitution?\nMR. BLUME: Of course.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes. Of course. What case\nin the Supreme Court would you look to to show it did?\nMR. BLUME: I think it would -- there you\nwould easily just look to this Court's Eighth Amendment\ndecisions which say --\nJUSTICE BREYER: You don't find any one\nwhere anybody ever had an argument like that.\nMR. BLUME: Right. It wouldn't be an -- but\nit would be inconsistent with the fundamental\nprinciples --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Ah. Ah. So you are saying\nwe should look not just to -- if we try to look for\nexact, identical arguments maybe we'll get into that\nproblem? Of having to uphold things we all know -- or\nis that right? Or what?\nMR. BLUME: Well, I think, you know, at some\npoint, right, you can say well, you don't have a case on\npoint because no one has said anything so outrageous.\nIf a prosecutor went up and said look, ladies and\ngentlemen, the judge is going to tell you about\naggravating and mitigating circumstances; forget all\nthat baloney, go in there, you know, put all that out of\nyour brain, and give him death. I don't think there\nwould be any question --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The question has been\nswitched here, Counsel. The question before us is not\nwhether it was wrong, even if you answer there's plenty\nof Supreme Court precedent, even though none on these\nparticular facts, to convince me that he shouldn't have\nsaid it.\nThat's not the question before us. The\nquestion before us is whether it violates fundamental\nunfairness, whether it's wrong to such an extent that it\ninvalidates the whole prosecution and -- and sentence.\nThat's quite a different question. I can\nacknowledge, yeah, the prosecutor, you know, shouldn't\ndo it. But that doesn't lead me to the, automatically\nto the conclusion that the Supreme Court jurisprudence\nshows that this so violates fundamental unfairness that\nthe, that the verdict has to be set aside.\nMR. BLUME: Well, let me tackle that\nhead-on. There were a number of improper comments made\nin this case. Most, many of them -- a number of them\nwere objected to and the objection was overruled. Some\nof them were not objected to. The only instructions\nthey got were two curative instructions on two points\nand a general evidence, not arguments, instruction.\nSo nothing was really done in the context to\nameliorate the presence of these comments. And despite\nwhat the Petitioner says, this was not a strong case for\ndeath. The evidence of guilt was circumstantial and\nhotly contested. Even the prosecutor in his penalty\nphase acknowledged, look, he might be innocent, but kill\nhim anyway. The State presented no additional evidence\nin aggravation of punishment. Mr. Weaver had no prior\nrecord other than a misdemeanor conviction.\nThere was substantial mitigating evidence\npresented regarding his character, his good deeds, and\nother things he had done in the community and his\nadaptability to confinement.\nThis was not a strong case for death.\nSo you take these comments, which were --\nthey're trying to contrast -- this argument is worse\nthan Newlon in most respects. It was made five weeks\nafter he was told that this argument rendered another\ntrial fundamentally unfair.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Your recital was not\na complete picture of the case. This was an\nassassination of a witness in a Federal drug\nprosecution, with how many shots to the head?\nMR. BLUME: I believe there were six.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Six. And the jury\ndetermined unanimously beyond a reasonable doubt that\nthis was the guy who did it. So you do have to look at\nthe penalty phase in the context of those facts.\nMR. BLUME: I agree. But to say that -- and\nthey found -- and I'm not suggesting that that's not\npart of the totality of the proceedings.\nBut there's one significant point there that\nalso I think needs to be taken into account. He was a\nwitness, but he was also a drug dealer and involved in\nthe drug trade and was a straw purchaser for these Shurn\nfamilies. And in many instances --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, serve him right? I\nmean, is that --\nMR. BLUME: I'm not suggesting it serves him\nright. I'm suggesting that whether juries impose death\noften depends in part as well on the moral\nblameworthiness or how they perceived the victim. This\nwas not like witness, an innocent witness. This was\nsomebody who was involved in that. And that normally\nmakes it more difficult for the prosecution to obtain a\ndeath sentence.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What do you -- what\nshould a prosecutor's closing -- penalty phase argument\nlook like? What are the sorts of things that he should\nbe talking about?\nMR. BLUME: I think in general they stick to\nthe evidence. They can argue that the nature and\nseverity of the crime itself warrants the ultimate\npunishment and focus on -- the focus of the penalty\nphase is supposed to be on the individual's moral\nculpability and whether they deserve the death penalty\nbased on what they did. This argument, most of this\nargument I believe, as Justice Breyer suggested, it went\non for pages and there was no mention really in any\nsubstance of William Weaver and what he had done.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Do you think moral\nculpability is the only factor that can be mentioned? I\nthought you said earlier it was okay for the prosecutor\nto refer to deterrence.\nMR. BLUME: I don't think it's the only\nfactor, but I was responding to the question of what\nshould a prosecutor do and in fact what most\nprosecutors do in most cases.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Can a prosecutor say that\nkilling a witness is something that needs to be deterred\nand therefore it's important, it's appropriate to impose\nthe death penalty here in order to send a message of\ndeterrence? Is that improper?\nMR. BLUME: I think something probably like\nthat would be. But this -- again, this went way beyond\nthat.\nThe other thing that you have to look at\nhere is that then he goes on to say, and if you don't\ngive him death chaos will reign, society will fall\napart, there's no point in having a death penalty, and\nthe animals will reign in the jungle and you can't that\nhave that in a civilized society.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Is part of moral\nculpability that you take moral instruction from thieves\nmurderers on the street, as opposed to those higher\nstandards for which society seeks to aspire? Is that\nmoral culpability?\nMR. BLUME: I'm sorry. I'm not sure --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Is it moral culpability\nfor you to take as an example for your behavior the\ncriminal population?\nMR. BLUME: I still -- I'm not trying to be\nthick.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: You're talking about moral\nculpability. Is it part of your moral culpability that\nyou take your values, your instructions, your behavior\nfrom criminals, as opposed to people who uphold the law\nin society? Is that part of moral culpability?\nMR. BLUME: It might be part of the picture\nof what this person is like.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well then, isn't it\nrelevant what's happening on the streets, etcetera?\nMR. BLUME: I don't think it's proper to say\nif you don't give this person death then all these other\nthings which are bad for society are going to happen.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Of course, the\ndefense argument was not focused on Weaver either. The\ndefense counsel said it was a vote for life, fight for\nit. Always fight for life, always, always. The\nargument by the defense wasn't -- and it's hard for me\nto imagine in a penalty phase how the arguments wouldn't\nextend beyond the particular individuals.\nMR. BLUME: But there's beyond and there's\nway beyond and there's beyond the pale. And I think if\nyou look at all these things that were said in this case\n-- I have read hundreds of these arguments -- no\nconscientious prosecutor could have thought that this\nwas appropriate.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: How do you answer the\nargument, fight for life, always fight for life? How do\nyou answer that argument, except by saying: Ladies and\ngentlemen, sometimes, sometimes it's your duty to vote\nfor death? How else would you answer that argument?\nMR. BLUME: You could answer it that, look\nat what this person did. You look at his crime. We\nhave the death penalty in this State. In some cases\nit's appropriate. It's appropriate in this case. It's\nnot appropriate to say: I'm the prosecutor, I decide in\nwhich cases we seek death.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Blume, before your\ntime is up, I want to ask you one other question. I'm\nstill troubled about whether AEDPA applies. And was it\nargued in any court below? Was the question actually\nruled on after an adversarial presentation as to whether\nAEDPA applies or does not apply? As I understand it, it\neither does or it doesn't and it doesn't matter whether\nit was argued. But was it discussed in any of the lower\ncourt decisions?\nMR. BLUME: You're talking about on the\nbasis that he filed before the act?\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Two days before the act.\nMR. BLUME: He filed before the act. The\ndistrict court dismissed and said, believing erroneously\n--\nJUSTICE STEVENS: No, I mean in this\nproceeding.\nMR. BLUME: It was argued in his initial\nhabeas. It was appealed to the Eighth Circuit, because\nthe Eighth Circuit initially granted the writ on Batson\ngrounds. So he appealed it at that point and the Eighth\nCircuit said, basically with very little analysis,\ndetermined that AEDPA applied because he had to refile\nafter the act and AEDPA applied to petitions filed after\nthe act.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And was that this habeas?\nThen he filed a subsequent habeas or what?\nMR. BLUME: It was the same habeas\nproceeding. It was a continuation of the same. It was\nthen remanded back to the district court. The district\ncourt granted the writ on this ground and then it went\nup on appeal. I don't think he would have been under\nany obligation to appeal it again, having sort of gotten\na ruling on that in the same habeas proceeding.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: If the Eighth Circuit had\nhad Lawrence in front it, it would have ruled\ndifferently? Or should it have ruled differently, in\nrespect to Lawrence?\nMR. BLUME: I believe that -- I'm sorry, I\ndidn't mean to interrupt.\nI believe Lawrence makes clear that the\ndistrict court made a fundamental mistake in law in\ndismissing his petition and should not be --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Under Lawrence the Eighth\nCircuit would have been wrong?\nMR. BLUME: Yes.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And if Lawrence had gone\nthe other way, then it also -- then it would be right.\nIn other words, whether AEDPA applies really is a\nfunction of our decision in Lawrence?\nMR. BLUME: Yes. Lawrence made clear what I\nthink should have probably been clear beforehand, that\nyou didn't have to seek cert to this Court in order to\nexhaust a petition, but that was the basis of the\ndistrict court's ruling.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Blume.\nMs. Spillars, you have four minutes\nremaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREA K. SPILLARS\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMS. SPILLARS: Thank you, Your Honor.\nI would like to address two points. First,\nit is not clearly established that deterrence arguments\nin closing arguments are improper, and for good reason,\nparticularly because of the strength of this -- the\nevidence in this case and the fact that the Respondent\nhad killed a Federal witness execution-style. To that\nextent, as I understand the Respondent's argument, the\ndeterrence rises or falls on however the prosecutor has\nprefaced his deterrence argument, if he says certain\nwords to mitigate the deterrence argument. However,\ntrials don't operate in terms of specific words that\nmust be pre-spoken before an argument can be valid.\nSecondly, in response to Justice Kennedy's\nquestion previously, I would advise that prosecutors\nshould not use some arguments, not necessarily the\ndeterrence argument, but not that in every instance they\nmust not use those arguments. This Court's supervisory\nrole in those kinds of cases allows this Court to turn\nshould's into must's for Federal prosecutors, but that\nis not the case here.\nSecond -- thirdly, the Viereck case is in a\nhistorical context which we don't have here, and the\nMissouri Supreme Court did consider the penalty phase\narguments. At page 237 of the appendix the court\nspecifically said: \"We have reviewed the penalty phase\narguments.\"\nAnd then at page 235, the Missouri Supreme\nCourt distinguishes Newlon and says that they do not\nrise to the level of the statements made in Newlon. So\nto that extent the Missouri State court was not an\nunreasonable application of this Court's precedents and\ndeference should afforded to that State court decision.\nFor that reason we would ask that this case be reversed.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
