CLEMENT\nON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Thank you, Mr. Chief\nJustice, and may it please the Court:\nThe Solomon Amendment conditions the Federal\nfunding of educational institutions on receiving\nsomething that any donor would expect, the opportunity\nto recruit students educated at the funded\ninstitutions. That opportunity allows the military a\nfair shot at recruiting the best and the brightest for\nthe military's critical and vital mission.\nThe Federal Government does not insist on any\npredetermined level of access; rather, it simply asks\nwhat other employers receive. Likewise, the recipient\nschools remain free to criticize the military and its\npolicies, and, of course, they remain free to decline\nFederal funds altogether. As a result of these\ncircumstances, the Solomon Amendment comports with both\nthe Constitution and with common sense.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: When you say that it asks\nwhat other employers receive, but these institutions, I\ngather, would not allow other employers, who have the\nsame policy against the hiring of homosexuals, to\ninterview at their institutions. So, you're receiving\nwhat other employers in the same situation would\nreceive.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, I think, Justice\nScalia, that you have to look at the -- I think, the\nstatute in two steps. One is, I think it's quite clear\nthat it gives the military a right to gain access to\ncampus as a condition, that it has -- that they have to\ngain access to campus in order to perform their\nmilitary recruitment.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Yes, but it says -- I\nthought it says that the military must have equal\naccess with any other employer. Now, every other\nemployer is subject to the same policy, presumably, of\nthe law school.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, with respect, Justice\nO'Connor, I think there's several points to be made in\nresponse to that. First of all, I think the Solomon\nAmendment itself is a recognition that the military is\nnot like any other employer for purposes of its policy\nand its treatments of homosexuals. And I think that,\nunlike any other employer, the military's policy is a\nresult of a congressional mandate. And --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, that's fine, but you\nwere the one that made the argument that they want the\nsame access as other employers. That's --\nGENERAL CLEMENT: And what --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- when you -- I just --\nGENERAL CLEMENT: -- what I would say --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- want to make sure what\nthe calculus is, at the outset.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, and Justice Kennedy,\nI think the point I would say is, in terms of gaining\naccess to campus, we want to gain access at a level,\nand under circumstances, that perhaps some other\nemployer would be excluded. Well, once access is\ngained, then the question arose under the prior version\nof the statute, all right, if access is gained, what\nlevel of access suffices? And on that second-order\nquestion of what level of access suffices, then you\nlook to what is provided to any other employer. And\nso, that's why, when I say that we don't ask for any\npredetermined level, we don't ask for seven meetings a\nyear, we don't ask for entrance into the public-address\nsystem or the e-mail system. We simply say, \"Once you\nlet us on campus, just give us, and extend to us, an\nopportunity to recruit on the same terms as others.\"\nAnd that obviously reflects the commonsense judgment\nthat the military is competing for the same pool of\nstudents that the other employers are competing for.\nJUSTICE BREYER: The constitutional argument,\nI guess, is, \"Does the Constitution require access --\nis -- does it permit a statute which says you have to\ngive access to the military, when you wouldn't give\naccess to any other employer?\"\nGENERAL CLEMENT: That's exactly right,\nJustice Breyer.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. Now --\nGENERAL CLEMENT: And, of course, we take the\n--\nJUSTICE BREYER: So, then what you're saying,\nit --\nGENERAL CLEMENT: -- position that --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- and then what's the\nanswer to that question, \"Does the Constitution\" -- how\ndoes the -- what's the answer?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: I think there's -- I mean,\nthere's -- the Constitution is -- has no difficulty\nwith such a statute. It is this statute. As I say,\nthere's -- if you want to think about it being\npreferential entry into campus, and then, at that\npoint, equal access on terms of the -- the terms that\nare extended -- however you want to think about it,\nthough, there's no difficult constitutional question\nhere.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, your argument --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No, but it seems me you've\ngot us off galloping in the wrong direction. The\nstatute doesn't require simply giving the same access\nthat you give to other employers. It requires much\nmore than that. It requires that they -- it prohibits,\nor cuts off, funds if an institution either prohibits\nor, in effect, prevents the Secretary of a military\ndepartment from gaining access to campuses for purposes\nof military recruiting in a manner that is at least\nequal in quality and scope to the access to campuses\nand to students that is provided to any other employer.\nSo, it seems to me that the statute demands more than\nsimply you give the same access as all other employers.\nIf you allow any other employer, you have to give it\nto the military in the same manner.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: I think that's right,\nJustice Scalia. I'm -- and I'm sorry if I got us off\non the wrong foot.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: General --\nGENERAL CLEMENT: I think there is this\ndebate --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes, but it is an important\nquestion, because the -- there is an amicus brief that\nsays, \"Go read the statute.\" And, really, the statute\nwas not about homosexuals in the military, it was a\nstatute about universities in Vietnam not letting\nmilitary people on campus. So, in the -- at the heart\nof the statute was a matter which was unique to the\nmilitary. Now, this is a matter that isn't unique to\nthe military. So, why not interpret the statute in the\nway that the amicus brief suggests in order to avoid a\ndifficult constitutional question?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, a couple of points,\nJustice Breyer. I don't think there is a difficult\nconstitutional question to be avoided here, and I'll\nget back to that whenever I can.\nAs to the statutory-interpretation question\nitself, I think that in -- the proper frame of\nreference here is probably not the original 1969\nversion of this, which conditioned only NASA's fund.\nThe original starting point is probably about 1996,\nwhen the first version of the modern Solomon Amendment\nwas introduced. And there have been a couple of\niterations of it, but I think one important reference\npoint is the version that was in force at the start of\nthis litigation, and that's actually reproduced at page\n88(a) of the petition appendix in the District Court\nopinion. And if you look at that against 88(a) of the\npetition appendix, there would be no question that what\nis at stake here is access to the campus, and the\namicus argument that's being raised is not even\navailable; because the statute at that point is, I\nthink, in fairness, materially identical, except for\nthat last clause, which says \"in a manner equal in\nscope to -- in character to that of any other\ninstitution.\" So, it's clear that when this litigation\nstarts, there's no argument available to the amicus\nthat the statute effectively accomplishes nothing.\nNow, what happens under this version of the\nstatute is, a second-order question arises. Okay, the\n-- in order to comply with the Solomon Amendment,\nuniversities have to give access, they have to allow\nthe military to gain entry and gain access to the\nstudents in the terms of the then-extant statute. The\n--\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I interrupt with one --\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Sure.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- brief question? Would\nthat be true if the university didn't allow any access\nwhatsoever to any employer?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: As a regulatory matter, the\nmilitary took the position that if they simply barred\naccess to --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: No --\nGENERAL CLEMENT: -- anybody --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- not the regulatory\nmatter. The statute.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: I think you could read the\nstatute either way on that question, Justice Stevens.\nThey interpreted it to say that there was no equal --\nthere is no obligation to give entry if no employer was\non campus at that time.\nThe other thing they interpreted in the\nstatute as a regulatory matter, though, was this\nsecond-order question of, \"All right, if they get some\naccess, is unequal access enough?\" And as a regulatory\nmatter, they said, \"No. We need access that is equal\nin character and scope to that provided to any other\nemployer.\" And then what Congress did in the iteration\nof the statute that's at issue here, which is\nreproduced starting at page 185(a) of the petition\nappendix is they effectively codified and ratified that\nregulatory interpretation by adding the phrase \"in a\nmanner that is at least as equal in quality and scope\nto the access to campuses and to other students that is\nto -- provided to any other employer.\"\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: General --\nGENERAL CLEMENT: But I think --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- Clement, do I\nunderstand, with respect to that brief that offered a\nstatutory interpretation to avoid a constitutional\nquestion, your answer is, that would be an unreasonable\ninterpretation of the statute that we now have? And if\nwe're talking about a predecessor statute in 1968, from\nthe Vietnam days, that -- this would have been a highly\nacademic question, because there weren't any such\npolicies in any law schools with respect to recruiting.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: No, that's true, Justice\nGinsburg. That's why I said, in response to Justice\nBreyer, that I think that the proper point to start to\nfocus on is the -- these -- is the 1994 Solomon\nAmendment. And, at that point, there is a question\nabout this policy. At that point, the American\nAssociation of Law Schools does have its recruiting\npolicies beginning in place, and I think the provision\nhas been amended a number of times in the years since\n1994. There have been changes in the scope of the\nfunding that's covered. First, student-aid funds were\nput in, then they were taken out. And then, this is\nthe most recent iteration of the provision.\nThere's no question that what's at issue here\nis more than just the Vietnam-era concerns about ROTC\npresence on statute, because that's addressed in a\ndifferent subsection of the statute. That's addressed\nin 10 U.S.C. 983(a). So this provision, 10 90- -- 10\nU.S.C. 983(b) is specifically addressed at the problem\nof access to campuses for recruiting. And, I think,\nespecially when you read the statute in light of the\nrelevant history of the prior administrative\ninterpretation, and that being codified and ratified by\nCongress, it's very clear that this phrase \"in a manner\nthat is at least equal in quality and scope to the\naccess provided to any other employer,\" is just that,\nit's a regulation of the manner of access, once access\nis granted. And it addresses this difficult question\nof, If you allow some entry and access onto campus,\nwhat level of access is sufficient? And so, I think\nthat --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What does Title X of the\nUnited States Code deal with?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: It deals with the military.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why do you chose to defend\nthis principally on the basis of the Spending Clause,\nand not on the basis of what it -- what it was, seemed\nto me, enacted in order to achieve, and that is the\ncongressional power to raise and support armies.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, Justice Scalia, I\nthink the statute is clearly supported under both\nprovisions, under the spending authority and the\nArticle I authority to raise and support armies. I\nthink, in answering your question, we tended to focus\non the fact that it was a spending condition, because\nwe thought, under this Court's precedence, that made it\nan even more straightforward case. We certainly think\nit would be constitutional, even if it were a direct\nimposition, and we certainly think the fact that this\nis an exercise of Congress's undoubted authority to\nraise and support an army, is relevant to the\nconstitutional analysis.\nAnd if I could move over to the\nconstitutional question and address that for a minute,\nI think one of the arguments that's raised on the other\nside is that there's an interference with associational\ninterests in this case, and I think there are other\nstatutes that, frankly, have much more of an\ninterference with a university's associational\ninterest. I mean, Title VII, for example, regulates\nwho can be members of the university. And I raise that\nalso because another provision in Title -- in terms of\nthis same area of the military, requires that there not\nbe discrimination against veterans in hiring and\nemployment. And you could easily see that a university\ncould take their position to its logical conclusion and\nsay, \"In order to show just how much we don't like the\nmilitary's policy, we're not only going to not let\nmilitary recruiters on campus, but we are going to not\nhire former military people, veterans, and we're not\ngoing to admit them to our classes.\" Now, who's in the\nclassroom, and who's a member of the university --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: That would --\nGENERAL CLEMENT: -- seems --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- be rather farfetched.\nThe pitch that's being made is an equality pitch, that\nwe are teaching our students equality, the equal\nstature of all people. So, I think that your example\ndoes not fit --\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, with respect, Justice\nGinsburg, I'm not sure I understand why not. It's the\nsame idea. In order to teach equality, that there\nshould be no discrimination against homosexuals, we're\ngoing to exclude, (a), military recruiters, and, while\nwe're at it, the former military, as well, because they\nvoluntarily joined the forces knowing that they had a\ndiscriminatory practice. It's no stretch of the\nimagination to think that the principle that's being\narticulated by Respondents, would stretch well beyond\nsimply a direct antidiscrimination motive.\nFor example, NYU -- this is in the joint appendix,\nat page 153 -- NYU, for 3 years, had a policy of\nexcluding recruiters from the State of Colorado, simply\nbecause Colorado had passed Amendment II, which this\nCourt dealt with in the Romer case. And so, it's not a\nmatter of saying that, \"Well, you know, the only think\nthat's at issue here is excluding employers that are,\nthemselves, discriminatory.\" The free-speech interests\nthat are articulated on the other side, would extend to\nany basis for criticizing the military, whether it was\nnot liking the war in Iraq, the war in Afghanistan, or\nthe discriminatory hiring policies.\nI also think, with respect to the issue of\ndiscrimination, it's worth pointing out here that\nthere's more than one way to understand whether or not\nthe military's policy is discriminatory. Certainly\nrespondents are entitled to view it as being\ndiscriminatory. But the Congress that mandates this\nsame policy towards homosexuals, I think, is equally\nentitled to look at it and say, \"No, there's no\ndiscrimination going on here, because you have to take\ninto account the special role of the military.\"\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay, but even if you do\nthat, you're still left, it seems to me, with the\nproblem -- whether you characterize the problem as\ndiscriminatory and antidiscriminatory university policy\nor not, you're still left with a speech problem that\nthey raise, that, in effect, you are forcing them, in\neffect, to underwrite your speech, up to a point, and\nyou are forcing them to change their own message.\nYou're forcing them into hypocrisy, in one alternative.\nAnd those arguments don't depend upon the -- sort of,\nthe discriminatory character of what may be at stake.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: I think that's exactly\nright Justice Souter, and I think those arguments would\nbe the same even if what was going on here was a\nconcern about the military's other policies. You would\nstill have a concern that the military is being forced\nonto campus to make its own speech, and you would still\nhave the concern that that interferes with the message\n--\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So, discrimination --\nGENERAL CLEMENT: -- the university --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- or no discrimination,\nyou've got a speech issue that you're going to address.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: I agree. I mean, I think,\nultimately, that cuts in our favor, because it shows\nthat the other side's position is not limited to this\nnarrow context, but is a much broader first-amendment\nclaim.\nNow, turning to that first-amendment claim, I\nthink what's wrong with that claim is several things.\nI think, with respect to what the military itself\nwants, it simply does not want a -- primarily a speech\nactivity to take place, it wants access for recruiting,\nwhich is a traditional commercial enterprise, it is an\nactivity that is something that is regulated by Title\nVII in other Federal statutes. Sure, there may be some\nincidental speech involved in that, but primarily it is\nan instrumental activity designed to get --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It happens, in this case, to\nbe specifically authorized by the Constitution.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: It does, indeed, Justice\nScalia, and I think, though -- I mean, there is this\nsense in which we certainly concede that there maybe\nsome incidental speech involved; certainly,\nmilitary recruiters are engaged in speech. I'm --\nwe're not sure that's really the relevant speech. But\neven the university itself --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, but you're making a --\nif I understand what you're saying, you are making a\nkind of O'Brien argument that the -- that the burden on\nspeech, whatever it may be, is an incidental burden to\nsomething else. Well, that -- I think we have to draw\nthis line between recruiting, on the one hand, which is\nwhat the military wants to do, and the Solomon\nAmendment, on the other hand. As I understand it, the\nSolomon Amendment is directed, or is responsive,\nentirely to positions taken by law schools on, among\nother things, first-amendment expressive grounds, so\nthat if we are going to address the Solomon Amendment,\nI think we are addressing an exclusively first-\namendment-speech expression issue.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, Justice Souter, I\nguess -- I'm inferring that you're drawing that\nconclusion from some of the statements of some of the\nfloor sponsors about their purposes enacting the\nSolomon Amendment. I mean, if you look at the text of\nthe Act alone --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I don't --\nGENERAL CLEMENT: -- I don't think --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- know of any other reason\nfor the Solomon Amendment.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, I think the reason\nfor the Solomon Amendment is to ensure that military\nrecruiters, in fact, have an equal opportunity to\nrecruit the same pool of individuals that all the other\nemployers are trying --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But --\nGENERAL CLEMENT: -- to recruit.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But they're -- but the\nSolomon Amendment, in order to accomplish that, is\naddressed to a particular expressive problem which\noccurs for the military -- and for the law schools, for\nthat matter -- in law-school recruiting. So, it seems\nto me that -- for -- I mean, my only point is that the\nSolomon Amendment seems to have one objective.\nWhereas, the \"don't burn your draft-card rule,\" in\nO'Brien, had two -- or had a -- let's say, had a\nprimarily nonspeech objective with an incidental-speech\nburden. Here, the sole objective, in the real world,\nseems to be an expressive objective.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, if by -- \"the\nexpressive objective\" you're talking about is the\nmilitary's own recruiting, I guess --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, this express --\nGENERAL CLEMENT: -- I agree with you.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but the expressive\nobjective is, the law schools are taking a position on\nfirst-amendment grounds. That position is interfering\nwith military recruitment. No question about it. I\ndon't know how much, but I will assume that there is no\nquestion about it. The Solomon Amendment is addressed\nsolely, as I understand it, at the expressive\nactivities which have, as you say, this interference.\nIts sole objective is expressive.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: No, I would disagree,\nJustice Souter. If the -- if the law schools were\ndenying access to military recruiters, for any reason,\nbe it a first-amendment reason that they'd say it's a\nfirst-amendment reason, or just because they couldn't\nbe bothered, the Solomon Amendment would be written\nexactly the same way, which would say, \"Look, the\nmilitary has an opportunity to get onto campus, and,\nonce it gets there, it ought to get the same basic\nopportunities as other employers.\"\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You cannot convert a law\ninto a law directed at the first -- at first-amendment\nrights, can you, by simply saying, \"The reason I am\ndisobeying it is to express -- whatever, disaffection\nwith the war, my objection to homosexuality, or\nanything else -- or to homosexual discrimination -- or\nanything else\"? Does that convert it to a law directed\nagainst the first amendment?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Absolutely not, Justice\nScalia. And I would go further and say it's also not a\nproblem, if, in the real world, the conduct that\nCongress sought to regulate was, in fact, in practice,\ngenerated by first-amendment concerns. I think that\ndescribes O'Brien.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, in --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, let me ask another\nquestion that may shed a little light on it. Does the\nSolomon Amendment pose any restrictions on the extent\nto which the law schools can distance themselves from\nthe military's views? Can there be signs up at every\nrecruitment office, saying, \"Our law school doesn't\nagree with any discrimination against gays\"? I mean,\ncan they come forward with their position on this in\nevery recruitment office without violation of the\namendment?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Yes, they can, Justice\nO'Connor. I think they would be, in fairness -- I want\nto be clear -- I think there might be a line where\nthere would be -- the recruitment office could conduct\nitself in a way that would effectively deny access.\nBut I think, with that caveat, there is --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But --\nGENERAL CLEMENT: -- nothing in the Act that\nprevents the universities --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Let me ask you --\nGENERAL CLEMENT: -- from disclaiming --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- this question, to follow\nup on Justice O'Connor's thought. Can -- are you\nsaying that the school can engage in speech expressing\nits views about the military policies, can it engage in\nsymbolic speech by affording access, which is equal in\nall functional requirements, but yet sends a message\nthat they are really disagreeing with what's going on\nby, say -- let a law school say, \"Well, for -- most\nemployers will let you use the regular law-school\nplacement facilities, but, for the military, we will\nrequire you use the college facilities to send a\nmessage that we disapprove, if the college facility is\nequally of -- good, as a matter of functioning\"?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, Justice Stevens, I\nwould say, to the -- I think, the main thrust of your\nquestion, no, which is to say that if what you have in\nmind is really forcing them to go to the undergraduate\ncampus, I think the military would take the position\nthat that's not equal in scope. Now, if there's a way,\nthough --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But is it not equal because\nof the message it sends or because it denies the\nopportunity to recruit as effectively?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: It's the latter, Justice\nStevens, and only the latter --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: What if I had an example\nwhere they were equal -- equally effective as\nrecruitment avenues. Could they -- could they make the\nmilitary take one that was equally effective, but it\nsent a message, \"Well, we really don't like what you're\ndoing\"?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: I mean, my own --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Sort of like a\nseparate-but-equal.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yes.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, I mean --\n[Laughter].\nGENERAL CLEMENT: -- I guess I'm -- I'm\nresisting a little bit just because I'm not -- I think\nit would depend on the --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: So, the --\nGENERAL CLEMENT: -- hypothetical.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- the point I'm trying to\nmake is, Does your agreement, that you can engage in\nspeech by posting banners or handing a note, apply to\nsymbolic speech --\nGENERAL CLEMENT: It could --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- the kind of conduct that\nis symbolic speech?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: It could apply to some\nsymbolic speech, I believe. It's just -- I'm having\ntrouble, because, in a practical matter, if you look at\nthe record here, I think it's telling. If you look, at\njoint appendix, at pages 215 and 219, describes the\nreal situation at Boston College. And they want to say\nthat, \"Well, it's not really much of an imposition on\nthe military, because all you have to do is get the\nrecruiting list from the reserve desk at the law\nlibrary, and then go to\" --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: No, that's a functional --\nGENERAL CLEMENT: -- the main campus, which\nis a mile and a half away.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But the --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: That's a functional\ndifference.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- the resistance to any\nstatute, I assume, could be justified as symbolic\nspeech.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, and I think -- I\nmean, I'm -- I think that some resistance by some parts\nof the university might be fine. I think if the\nrecruiting office -- this is the caveat I tried to give\nJustice O'Connor -- if the recruiting office engages in\nconduct that effectively negates the access that\nthey're providing, then I think you would have a\ndifferent situation.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: General Clement, can you\nbe affirmative now? Because we have an example, from\nJustice Stevens, which is the Yale example. The -- it\nwas the main campus, instead of the law school. What -\n- the recruiter is there. He's in the same room that\nother recruiters use. What can the law faculty do to\ndisassociate itself from -- to say that, \"We don't\ntolerate discrimination of any kind\"? What can the law\nschool do, concretely, while the recruiter is in the\nroom?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: I mean, concretely, they\ncould put signs on the bulletin board next to the door,\nthey could engage in speech, they could help organize\nstudent protests. I would draw the line, though, at\nsaying that they have to go to the undergraduate\ncampus, because I think, as a practical matter --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: You mean, they could\norganize a student protest at the hiring interview\nrooms, so that everybody jeers when the applicant comes\nin the door and the school could organize that?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: The school could --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: As -- when it's --\nGENERAL CLEMENT: -- organize --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- when it's, say, a job\nfair, and all the employers are there, but then they\njeer just the -- and the school organizes a line\njeering the -- both the recruiters and the applicants,\nthat's equal access?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: I think that would be equal\naccess. I think you have to draw a practical line --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm surprised that --\nGENERAL CLEMENT: -- here between --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- you think that --\nGENERAL CLEMENT: -- between access and\nallowing the speech, but I think it -- you have to be -\n-\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You're not going to be an\nArmy recruiter, are you?\n[Laughter.]\nGENERAL CLEMENT: I don't think the military\nand the Army recruiters -- and I -- and I won't be one\nof them -- but I think the Army recruiters are not\nworried about being confronted with speech, they're\nworried about actually not being allowed onto the same\nlaw schools --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: They're worried about having\nstudents driven off. And if you have jeering and\npicketing, do you really think that that fulfills the\npurposes of this amendment?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: I don't know if it would\nfulfill every purpose, but I think the amendment has to\naccommodate the first-amendment --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: You think if you --\nGENERAL CLEMENT: -- interests at --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- have jeering --\nGENERAL CLEMENT: -- a university.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- jeering and picketing if\na black person came to recruit and people didn't -- and\na school faculty didn't like blacks?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, I think that would --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I think that that's an\nextraordinary position you're taking.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, but, Justice Kennedy,\nI think you have to distinguish what the Constitution\nwould allow the Government to do and what this statute\ndoes, which is to say -- I mean, what you have in mind\nis a --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: We're talking --\nGENERAL CLEMENT: -- race example --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- about the practical\nmeaning of \"equal access.\"\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Right, but in -- the\npractical meaning has to turn on the statute at issue.\nAnd Title VI, for example, in the race context,\nforbids all discrimination because of race. And so,\nsome of the conduct that you have in mind may well\nviolate that statute. And if Congress wants to write a\ndifferent statute that provides more rights to the\nmilitary, we would be here defending it as valid first-\namendment legislation. But this statute gives, not a\nright to be free of any discrimination, but a right to\nequal access. And we think that the right way to frame\nthat inquiry is say, \"Access, yes, but be respectful of\nspeech.\"\nAnd the last thing I would say, if I could\nreserve the rest of my time for rebuttal, is simply\nthat it's worth remembering that the recruiting office\nis not the heart of first-amendment activity on campus.\nAnd if the recruiting office acts in a way that\nensures access, and the rest of the university engages\nin speech, that's a common sense way to accommodate the\ninterest of the military recruiters and the first\namendment.\nIf I may reserve.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, General.\nMr. Rosenkranz, we'll hear now from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF E. JOSHUA ROSENKRANZ\nON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Thank you, Your Honor. Mr.\nChief Justice, and may it please the Court:\nThis case is not about whether military\nrecruiters will be barred at the campus gates.\nCongress had a law on the books that guaranteed entry\nto campus, but that was not what Congress really\nwanted. So, it passed a new law. What Congress really\nwants is to squelch even the most symbolic elements of\nthe law schools' resistance to disseminating the\nmilitary's message, which is why it gave us the current\nversion of the statute. The current version isolates\nfor regulation the most communicative aspects of the\nlaw schools' resistance. The law schools --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, that's --\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: -- -- are saying --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry, but the\nmost communicative aspect is saying what you think\nabout a particular policy. This is conduct, denying\naccess to the military recruiters.\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, this is a\nrefusal to disseminate the messages of the military\nrecruiters. It is a refusal to send e-mails, post\nbulletins, and make arrangements for mutual exchange of\nideas. It is \"conduct\" only in the sense that they are\nmoving molecules, but it's speech that they are being\nforced to engage in. And I have to emphasize, this\ncase is not about entry. The Solomon Amendment does\nnot require schools to give entry to military\nrecruiters, it requires them to give entry to a\nrecruiter only if they provide entry to some --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, no that --\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: -- other employer.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, if you had a\npolicy that, \"We're going to deny any employer that\nuses tanks,\" do you think that would pass muster under\nthe Solomon Amendment?\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Well, Your Honor, for a\npacifist religious institution, absolutely.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What about Yale Law\nSchool?\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: No, because it has no\nmorally-based, conscious-driven reason for refusing to\ndisseminate that message.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, where do you find that?\nIn -- it has to be a morally-based, conscience-driven\n--\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Well, Your Honor --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I thought we were talking\nabout freedom of speech, not the religion clauses.\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Well, Your Honor, what I'm\nsaying is, under the -- under this Court's\njurisprudence in the first amendment, it's actually\nrelevant whether the reason for refusing to disseminate\nthe message lies at the heart of the first amendment.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, is -- what about\nHurley? Is there something deeply moral or conscience-\ndriven about the position to exclude the gay-rights\ncontingent in the parade, in Hurley?\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Well, Your Honor, it was\ncertainly a reason that they gave, and it was based\nupon a political view of the legitimacy of\nhomosexuality.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So, you're --\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: But I hasten to add, I'm not\narguing that that is a required element of a compelled-\nspeech claim. I'm simply arguing that when someone has\na reason for resisting disseminating a message, that\nsituates it further -- closer to the heart of the first\namendment. Congress came back, after it --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well --\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: -- had a --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Excuse me, that -- I\nunderstand that, so far as the associational claim may\ngo. But so far as the speech claims may go, I don't\nunderstand it.\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, I --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I can say, or refuse to say,\nanything I want to, for any reason I want to, however\nbad that reason, however nonmoral that reason is. And\nI don't see how, in the speech -- on the speech claims,\nwe get into moral basis at all.\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, I accept that as\na proposition of the compelled-speech doctrine,\nabsolutely. And what I'm trying to point out is that\nin this case what Congress has done is to engage in the\nmost viewpoint-oriented regulation of speech. The\nreason Congress does not -- the reason Congress is\ninsisting that the law schools disseminate the\nrecruiting messages is because of the message of the\nlaw --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But it doesn't --\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: -- schools themselves --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- it doesn't insist\n--\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: -- in providing --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It doesn't insist\nthat you do anything. It says that, \"If you want our\nmoney, you have to let our recruiters on campus.\"\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Yes, Your Honor, and, under\nthe doctrine of unconstitutional conditions, the\nanalysis is exactly the same.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Under -- what about\nSouth Dakota against Dole? South Dakota had a\nconstitutional right, under the twenty-first amendment,\nto set whatever drinking age it wanted, and yet we\nupheld the Spending Clause condition that if they\naccepted Federal funds, they had to set their drinking\nage at 21.\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Yes, Your Honor. And in\nsubsequent cases -- and, in fact, in Dole itself --\nthis Court pointed out that all bets are off when there\nis a superseding constitutional right. Here, we're\ntalking about the Bill of Rights and the first\namendment. I mean, Rosenberger and Rust --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: There's the right to\n-- in the Constitution, to raise a military.\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Well, that is a Government\ninterest, for sure. All Government interests --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: What --\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: -- can be --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: What you're --\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: -- traced --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: What you're arguing is that\nwhat is, for all intents and purposes, \"conduct\" can be\ninfused by the school, at its option, with a first-\namendment quality. Yet your argument would allow\nschools to exclude anybody in uniform from a cafeteria.\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Absolutely not, Your Honor,\nbecause --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Why not?\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: -- because --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: What's the point?\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: -- what the law schools are\nengaging in --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: It's an express -- it's an\n-- it's solely for an expressive purpose.\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, there's a\ndifference between refusing to abide by a universally\napplicable regulation of conduct, on the one hand, and\nthe Solomon on -- Amendment, on the other hand, which\nis refusing to assist the dissemination of a message.\nRecruiting is all about speech. Yes --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What do you --\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: -- it has --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What do you do about the --\nabout the cases where we have required colleges to\nallow some student activities to put forward their\nviews on campus, when other student activities are\nallowed to do that? It seems to me that that flatly\ncontradicts the proposition that when you compel an\ninstitution to permit somebody else to speak, you are\nviolating that institution's first-amendment rights.\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Well, Your Honor, that is\nfor public schools, and public schools are subject to\nthe first-amendment rights of those who want to enter\ntheir forum. But there is a critical difference\nbetween that forum, Your Honor, which the schools\nopened up to everyone, and the forums in career\nservices, which the schools filter on the basis of one\nvery important --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, but, Mr. Rosenkranz,\nisn't the -- I thought the distinction was that in\ndetermining the forum for recruiting, the university is\nspeaking. The university isn't creating a forum from a\nlot -- for a lot of third parties; it's speaking,\nitself. And I understand the essence of your claim to\nbe that its speech is being affected, either by being\nmixed with something it doesn't want to say or by\nbeing, in effect, forced to support it doesn't --\nsomething it does not want to say.\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, it's important\nto keep in mind that there are two messages going on\nhere, and they are clashing. There is the military's\nmessage, which the schools are interpreting as, \"Uncle\nSam does not want you,\" and there is the school's\nmessage, which is, \"We do not abet those who\ndiscriminate. That is immoral.\" And --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And you would take, Mr.\nRosenkranz, that same position. If this was not\nspecial to law faculties -- I mean, we're told that the\nrecruiters could go to the main campus; most of these\nplaces, the restriction is limited to the law\nfaculties. Suppose it was universitywide policy that\nwe do not give equal access to military recruiters. I\nthink your argument says it doesn't matter if it's\nspecial to the law school or the whole university. Do\nI understand it correctly?\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Yes, Your Honor. If the\nuniversity had such a policy, then the university would\nbe able to enforce it. But I hasten to add --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And so for members --\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: -- the university --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- for medical schools, we\ncan't get medical schools for our Armed Forces --\nchaplains, the same way, because it -- schoolteachers\nwho teach on military bases -- in order to make the\npoint.\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, at this point,\nand for some --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And that's --\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: -- several --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- that's all for an\nexpressive reason.\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Justice Kennedy, for several\ndecades, law schools have had these policies and\napplied them to career-services offices. No other\nschools within the --\nJUSTICE BREYER: But that isn't --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: But --\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: -- universities.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- that isn't relevant.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: But the Government takes\nthe position that the law school is entirely free to\nconvey its message to everyone who comes.\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Yes, Justice O'Connor, and -\n-\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: So, how is the message\naffected --\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Well --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- in that environment?\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: -- let me answer in two\nparts. First, of course, under the compelled-speech\ncases, the ability to protest the forced message is\nnever a cure for compelled-speech violation, but --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But --\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: -- what's going on --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry, but, on\ncompelled speech, nobody thinks that these -- law\nschool is speaking through those employers who come\nonto its campus for recruitment. Everybody knows that\nthose are the employers. Nobody thinks the law school\nbelieves everything that the employers are doing or\nsaying.\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: That's correct, Your Honor,\nbut, again, endorsement is also not an element of\ncompelled-speech claim. But let me -- let me bring\nthose two questions together on a factual point. The\nlaw schools are disseminating a message that they\nbelieve it is immoral to abet discrimination. When --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: But --\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: -- they --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- they can say that to\nevery student who enters the room.\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: And when they do it, Your\nHonor, the answer of the students is, \"We don't believe\nyou. We read your message as being that there are two\ntiers. There's a\" --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Oh, there are --\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: -- \"double standard\" --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- students --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The reason they don't\nbelieve you is because you're willing to take the\nmoney. What you're saying is, \"This is a message\" --\n[Laughter.]\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- \"we believe in\nstrongly, but we don't believe in it, to the tune of\n$100 million.\"\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: That's right, Your Honor.\nAnd the problem with this Solomon Amendment is that the\nunconstitutional-conditions doctrine says that you\ncan't put a private speaker to that crisis of\nconscience.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I just be sure I have\none thing straight? The content of the compelled\nspeech, as I understand it, is you're aiding in the\nrecruitment of the Armed Forces, right?\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: That's correct --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And so, it --\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: -- Your Honor.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- would still have been\ncompelled speech if, 25 years ago, Congress passed a\nstatute saying, \"University, you must allow our people\non campus to recruit,\" and they some -- for some\nreason, didn't want to help. But that would have been\na violation of the first amendment of the school if\nthere were no other debate, just they didn't want the\nArmy on because they had to provide facilities that\nwould aid recruitment.\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Yes, Your Honor. If it was\n-- certainly, if it was against their conscience to do\nso --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: So that it would have\nviolated the first amendment during World War II when\nthe -- whenever they are trying to raise an army, if\nthey had compelled an unwilling university to provide\nrecruitment facilities to the military.\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Well, yes, Your Honor,\nunless there is a compelling need. And the difficulty\nwith the Solomon Amendment --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, that be compelled\nspeech, though, in your view. That's the kind of\nspeech we're talking about, anything that helps the\nmilitary raise an army.\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Anything that -- not\nanything that helps the military raise an army; any\ncommunication that a school is required to engage in.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So, why isn't --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Isn't that the point? I\nmean, your point is not that -- as I understand, that,\nfor any reason, if the -- if the university, for any\nreason, during World War II, had excluded recruiters,\nand there had been the equivalent of the Solomon\nAmendment, that there would have been a first-amendment\nproblem. As I -- is -- maybe I don't understand your\nargument, but I thought your argument was, or is, that\nif they do it for some purpose of conscience, which\nimplies a message -- e.g., if it is a pacifist college\n-- there would be a first-amendment problem. But if\nthey're doing it simply because space is short and they\nwould rather provide one more biology classroom, there\nwouldn't be a first-amendment problem, World War II or\ntoday, would there?\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: That is absolutely right --\ncorrect, Justice Souter, which is why I answered your\nvery early question with --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So, you --\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: -- an answer that is --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- are saying that --\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: -- by conscience --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- that every time somebody\ngives as his reason for violating a law that he wants\nto send a message that he disagrees with that law --\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: No, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- that raises a first-\namendment question.\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: No, Your Honor. Every time\n--\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well --\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: -- someone says that as a\nreason for refusing to host a message of an unwelcome\nmessenger, that's a compelled-speech violation.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So, in fact, to be clear,\nyou also think schools that are angry at the military\nbecause they're too favorable to gays in the military,\nthey have the same right.\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Absolutely, Your --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay.\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: -- Honor, because --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And also the same right Bob\nJones University, because they disapprove of social\nmixing of the races?\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: If -- to answer the first\nhypothetical first, if that's a matter of conscience,\nabsolutely --\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right, so --\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: -- if we're talking --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- so, what -- and there are\na lot of people in the country, they may -- there's\nfew, anyway -- may not believe in either affirmative\naction, they may not believe in -- they may not believe\nin diversity, they may not -- they may even believe in\nracial segregation, for all I know. I hope there are\nnot too many --\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- but there might, and\nthose people all have the same right.\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Well, they have the same\nfirst-amendment right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes, okay. So, if that --\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: But --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- if that's the case, then\nof course it's going to be pretty tough --\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: But, Your Honor, the --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- for the military to get\npeople on campus. And I just wonder, if that's an\nimportant need, why you don't have here what I'd say is\nnormal in the first-amendment area, that the remedy for\nspeech you don't like, is not less speech, it is more\nspeech.\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, the problem with\nthe Solomon Amendment is that the Government is\ndemanding absolute parity. We have a statute before us\nthat demands exactly the same services, without regard\nto whether the military actually needs them. In order\nfor Congress to justify the parity requirement, which\nis the only statute before this Court, Congress has to\nstate a need. It has to say why it needs what --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Here's a need. How about\nthis? We have said in our opinions -- and I am quoting\nfrom Rostker versus Goldberg -- \"Judicial deference is\nat its apogee when legislative action under the\ncongressional authority to raise and support armies and\nmake rules and regulations for their governance is\nchallenged.\" And that's precisely what we have here.\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, this Court\ndefers to Congress, in matters of the military, when\nthe military or the Congress is especially expert and\nthis Court is especially naive. This Court has never\ndeferred to a congressional statute about military when\n--\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't think it has to do\nwith expertise. I think it has to do with immense\nnational importance.\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, it has to do\nwith expertise, as well. That's precisely what this\nCourt --\nJUSTICE BREYER: But I would --\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: -- said in Rostker.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- I would like the answer\nto my question, because I'm thinking, as you correctly\nsay, if you have that right, so do all the worse\nsegregationists you can imagine, et cetera.\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: And the --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And here -- yes, and here\nthere is a need of some kind to get the military in.\nAnd what the Government in this statute asks you --\nbecause I, personally, couldn't find anything in the\nrecord that finds that student who thinks, by letting\nthe military person in, that that school, which\nbasically is completely against the military in this\narea, suddenly becomes for it. And I haven't even\nfound in the record an instance where there was a\nrecruiter who told people that they couldn't join the\nmilitary if they were gay.\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Well --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So, we have not a tremendous\ndemonstration there of a need on the university side.\nAnd my question was, What's wrong with the Government\nsaying, \"University, you disapprove of what we do. The\nremedy for such a situation is not less speech, it is\nmore speech.\"\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, the --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Go and explain it.\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: -- the direct answer to that\nlast question is that all bets are off when what the\nGovernment is doing is compelling the speech of a\nprivate actor, because the Government is not allowed --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Does it compel the speech\nof a private actor when the Government says, \"Colleges\nand Universities, you are not going to get Federal\nmoney if you discriminate on grounds of race or gender.\nAnd we don't care what your private attitude may be,\nwe will refuse to contract, we will debar you from\nfuture contracts, if you don't -- not only say, 'We\nwon't discriminate,' but have an affirmative action\nplan.\" You know that is not hypothetical. This was\nthe U.S. policy in the early '70s.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Yes, Your Honor. I\nunderstand the hypothetical, at least -- especially as\nto the first half, which links to Justice Breyer's\nearlier question. There is an enormous difference,\nunder this Court's jurisprudence, between\nantidiscrimination laws and the sort of law we have\nhere, the Solomon Amendment. And the difference is,\nthe Government -- it is both on the need side and on\nthe infringement side. On the need side, the\nGovernment has a compelling interest that is different\nfrom just regulating the conduct. The compelling\ninterest that the Government has is a completely\nseparate interest in seeing to it that not a penny of\nFederal money ever goes to support an institution that\ntaxpayers would not be in a position to go to. That's\nBob Jones and Norwood.\nAnd, on the infringement side, this Court has\nsaid, that the act of discriminating against\nindividuals is entitled to no first-amendment\nprotection, regardless of whether there's a first-\namendment right at stake. And I should add, also, that\nthe vast majority of schools that are subject to Title\nVI or to Title IX have no such expression that is at\nstake. They are not articulating a message, \"We really\nneed to discriminate on the basis of race or on the\nbasis of gender.\"\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Rosenkranz, could you\ntell me which elements of your argument rest upon\ncompelled actual speech and which rest upon compelled\nsymbolic speech? Because the latter, I have to tell\nyou, I'm not very fond of. What compelled actual\nspeech is imposed on the -- you mentioned something\nabout e-mails, they have to send e-mails to say where\nthe recruiter will be located --\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Well --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- is that the compelled\nspeech you're worried about?\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: It is -- Your Honor, it is\nthe forced hosting of a messenger-based decision --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that's symbolic\nspeech. I'm talking about actual speech. What\nexpression is the university -- real, you know, words -\n- words -- is the --\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Well, but --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- university --\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: -- with the --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- compelled to utter by\nthis legislation?\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Under the parity\nrequirement, what the university is compelled to do is\nsit down with the employers and help counsel them on\nwhat their students are interested in and how best to\nshape the message. The Third Circuit went out of its\nway to point out that, and the National Association for\nLaw Placement brief is very compelling on that. They\nalso have to disseminate literature, post bulletins on\nbulletin boards, help the recruiter -- or, excuse me,\nthe law firm develop cocktail parties --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No, I suppose when you --\nwhen the police knock at the door and say, you know, \"I\nhave a warrant,\" I suppose somebody has to say, \"Come\nin.\" Is that compelled speech? Does that --\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: No, Your Honor, there are --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Does that -- does that raise\na first-amendment problem?\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: It does not. And there are\nmany circumstances in which words are used that are\nincidental to an action. These are not words used that\nare incidental to the action.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: What's happening here is\nthe perspective employers, the recruiters, are\nproposing a commercial transaction. And it seems to me\nquite a simple matter for the law schools to have a\ndisclaimer on all of their e-mails and advertisements\nthat say, \"The law school does not approve -- and, in\nfact, disapproves -- of the policies of some of the\nemployers who you will meet.\"\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: That's the end of it.\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: -- no matter what the\nGovernment does, it cannot convert the career-services\nenterprise into a value-neutral proposition. For the law\nschool, from its perspective, it's especially value-\ndriven. Yes, the --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Do law schools have an\ninterest in the Constitution that other people don't?\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, I'm not claiming\nany exceptionalism for the law schools. The AAUP brief\ndoes --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: All right. Well, I --\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: -- a brilliant job --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- I suppose, under your\nview, law schools really shouldn't permit firms -- law\nfirms on campus if those firms, say, oppose -- take\nlitigation positions opposing gay marriage.\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, as Dale points\nout, it's up to the private institution to decide what\nits metrics --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: That's --\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: -- are going to be.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: That's your position. Your\nposition is, the schools could, and probably should, do\nthat to make their message known.\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: My position, Your Honor, is\nthat the schools are entitled to make their own\njudgments about what messages they will disseminate.\nAnd even --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Dale is -- Dale --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Even with reference to\ncommercial -- proposed commercial transactions?\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Yes, Your Honor. But, I\nwould hasten to add, that is not what recruiters are\ndoing. It is no more commercial than what United Foods\nwas doing in an -- advertising, saying -- or resisting\nthe message, \"Mushrooms are good.\"\nJUSTICE BREYER: Do you agree with the\nGovernment, that the statute, as fairly interpreted, is\nviolated when a school which uniformly applies to all\nemployers the rule, \"You can't come in if you have the\ndiscrimination against hiring gay people\"?\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: You agree that it is\nviolated.\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Yes, Your Honor. The\nstatute focuses on the manner of providing access; and\nthe manner of providing access is through the career-\nservices --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Would you require any\naccommodation -- I mean, you have said, \"It's up to the\nfaculty to choose which causes to assist\" -- I think\nyou put it that way, or one of the amici did -- \"and\nwhich to resist.\" And you've already told me that this\nhappens to be the law school, could be the whole\nuniversity. Could the law faculty, or the university,\ntake the position, \"We're not going to -- we don't like\nyour message, and we are not going to let you have any\nof our facilities. We're not going give you the room\non the main campus. Just a total bar\"?\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, we're certainly\nnot advancing that position here. The Solomon\nAmendment requires no such thing. The Solomon\nAmendment does not require that schools give entry to\nmilitary personnel.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: No, but a school --\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: It says you must do it only\nif the other guy does it.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- a school, as a matter\nof its own policy says, \"We don't like discrimination,\nand we're not going to give discriminators access to\nany of our facilities, period.\"\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, are -- you're\nasking me what I would be arguing for my clients if\nthey were actually making --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I'm asking --\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: -- taking that position?\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- you, Is there any\nobligation, since you've said there is a compelling\nState interest -- compelling Government interest in\nrecruiting, is there some obligation to accommodate, or\ncould the faculty just say, \"We choose the causes that\nwe assist and the ones we resist\"?\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: And that is as to entry to\ncampus, Your Honor? You're --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes.\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: -- asking if -- we are not\npressing this point to the Court. If the Court is\nasking what my opinion would be if I --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I'm asking --\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: -- were a judge --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- is the -- if it\nlogically follows, from your position, about \"choosing\nthe causes we resist and the ones that we assist.\"\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, if I were\nadvancing that argument, it would be, this is a\nviewpoint-discriminatory statute which is subject to\nstrict scrutiny. The Government is advancing a single\nmessage, and, even when the first-amendment rights that\nare at stake are minimal under this Court's opinion in\nR.A.V., strict scrutiny would apply. The Government\nhas never come forward which a shred of evidence that\nit actually needs to be on campus, as opposed to\ndirectly off campus, or as opposed to publishing\nnotices in student publications, or advertizing. But -\n-\nJUSTICE STEVENS: When you --\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: -- we are not advancing --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- were talking about --\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: -- that argument.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- the government's\nmessage, the message is, \"Join the Army.\" Is that\nright?\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Yes, Your Honor. The\nmessage is, \"Join the Army.\" What the schools hear is\n--\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And that's a viewpoint-\ndiscriminatory message.\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: No, I'm sorry. The\nviewpoint discrimination, Your Honor, is in the\ncongressional statute that says, \"We will force you to\nhost a single speaker with a single message,\" just as\nin Pacific Gas --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: The single message is,\n\"Join the Army.\"\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: I'm sorry, Justice Stevens,\nI didn't --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: The single message is,\n\"Join the Army.\"\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: The single message is, \"Join\nthe Army,\" that is correct. And the Government is\npromoting only that one message. But this --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I thought your argument was,\nthe single message is, \"Join the Army, but not if\nyou're gay.\"\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Yes, Your Honor --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And --\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: -- that is --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- which leads me to the\nquestion, in response to your answer to Justice\nGinsburg a moment ago, in your view is the compelling\ninterest on the part of the Government recruitment or\nthe refusal to accept gays?\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: The compelling interest on\nthe Government's side is the recruitment interest.\nWe're not arguing that the Government has a compelling\ninterest in excluding anyone. That's precisely why --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, but, are you --\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: -- the law --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- are you saying that the\nGovernment -- that the only compelling-interest\nargument that the Government can raise here is the\ndiscriminatory argument? Since nobody denies that, if\nthe Government were recruiting without the\ndiscrimination, that there would -- there would --\nthere would be no problem with it. Everyone would\nagree with -- that that was a compelling --\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Well --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- interest. But, I thought\nyour argument on compelling interest was that the only\ncompelling interest that the Government can assert is\nthe discriminatory interest.\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: No, Your Honor, what I'm\nsaying is, if the Government wants to assert a need, it\nhas to identify the need. It has to say, \"We need more\nthan contact information. We need more than a room --\nentry to campus -- a room on campus, a posting on a\nbulletin board. We need everything.\"\nThe story of the Solomon Amendment, Your\nHonor, is the story of private institutions trying\ndesperately to accommodate the Government's need, even\nin light of their own moral scruples.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, the speech is on their\nside. The Government just says, \"Let our recruiters\nin.\" So, why isn't it sort of like, \"Pay the property\ntax\"? \"I don't want to. I hate the government.\"\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Well, Your Honor --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- \"I'm withholding the\nmoney because I want to express my message.\"\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: The speech is on both sides,\nbecause the schools are being forced to host the\nGovernment's message. The --\nJUSTICE BREYER: The message is, \"Join the\nArmy.\" The --\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: The message --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- message of the property\ntax is, \"Pay the -- pay for the\" --\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: The message --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- \"Government's expenses.\"\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: The message that the schools\nare hearing is, \"Join the Army, but not if you're gay.\"\nAnd the schools have been trying desperately to\naccommodate the Government, up until the point where\nCongress says, \"We don't actually want any of those\nthings. We want them only if you supply them to\nsomeone else. We want them only if you have viewpoint-\nbased reason that you don't want to give it to us.\"\nThere's some reason in the law school's conscience, or\nthe academic institution's conscience, that it wants to\ntreat this category of employers differently from any\nother. Congress's --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And you -- and you're\nperfectly free to do that if you don't take the money.\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, Congress, here,\nis imposing a sanction, which this Court has treated as\nexactly the same as a penalty. When --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Suppose that a law-school\nfaculty could decide that it does not favor a\nparticular war, and use that as the basis for excluding\nrecruiters, \"By allowing this recruiter to come on\ncampus, you are making me speak, in effect, to our\nstudents, saying, 'Join the Army and fight the war that\nwe're now engaged in.'\"\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, again, we're\nnot --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: \"And I don't want to do\nthat.\" Now --\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: We are not talking about --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- what would be the\ndifference?\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: -- coming on campus. We are\ntalking about affirmative assistance to the highest\ndegree --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, okay --\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: -- in disseminating the --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- fine. I'm saying the\nsame thing.\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: The answer is yes, Your --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But I'm saying --\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: -- Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- you would say that the\nsame situation would apply if the university faculty\ndoes not favor the particular war that the United\nStates is --\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- engaged in, and,\ntherefore, obstructs the effort to raise --\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- an army --\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: -- it's very --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- by not allowing them to\ncome on campus.\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: It is very important to\ndistinguish obstruction from refusal to subsidize,\nwhich, at the Government's instance, this Court has\nbeen doing for 30 years, both --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's obstruction when you\nrefuse to give them what you give what you give\neverybody else.\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: It is refusal to treat them\nthe same as everyone else, because they are not the\nsame as everyone else in the law schools' estimation.\nAnd the Government --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- fighting a war.\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Well, the Government has to\nidentify precisely what its need is, why it needs Yale\ncollege personnel rather than Yale -- excuse me -- why\nit needs Yale law-school personnel rather than Yale\ncollege personnel --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask you --\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: -- to make the appointments.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- this question, with that\nvery point in mind? Does it necessarily follow, if\nthere are occasional applications of this statute that\nmight be invalid, that the whole Solomon Amendment\nneeds to be struck down?\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, the -- this is\nnot about application of the statute in one\ncircumstance. The whole statute has to be struck down,\nbecause the Government is demanding absolute parity and\nthere's no way for this Court to rewrite the statute.\nWe don't know whether Congress would go back and go to\nthe entry requirement, just bear entry, to entry-plus,\nor to a parity requirement, which is -- which it has\nnow shifted to. So, there is simply no way to know\nexactly how Congress would rewrite the statute. But\nthis is, at its heart, an as-applied challenge. It's\nabout law schools with nondiscrimination policies.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you --\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Thank you --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- Counsel.\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: -- Your Honors.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: General Clement, you\nhave 4 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT\nON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Thank you, Mr. Chief\nJustice. I'd like to make just a few points in\nrebuttal.\nFirst of all, in starting with the compelled-\nspeech problem, there are only two kinds of speech that\nare at issue here. First, there is the compelled\nspeech of the military recruiters. And no one thinks\nthat that speech is being misattributed to the schools.\nEven in the secondary-school context, in Mergens, this\nCourt understood that secondary students could\ndistinguish between the school's message and that of\nschool groups.\nNow, the second piece of speech that's at\nissue is that of the university, when they incidentally\nsend an e-mail around telling the students where the\nmilitary recruiters are going to be on a certain day.\nAnd certainly in the context of recruiting, that kind\nof incidental speech does not implicate any compelled-\nspeech doctrine. In the Title VII context, for\nexample, if an employer says that there's a job\nopening, and says that to a white applicant, it has to\nsay the same thing to an African-American applicant.\nNobody would think that that other -- saying that to\nthe African-American applicant, which is, of course,\ncompelled speech by Title VII, violates the\nConstitution.\nI would also say, just as the last point on\ncompelled speech, that it's something of a stranger in\na strange land in the context of this case, since we\nare talking about a funding condition, not a\ncompulsion.\nSecond, let me move to the argument that the\nRespondents have about trying to distinguish this case\nfrom Justice Stevens' World War II hypothetical. And,\nas I understand it, it boils down to the argument that\nthe way that the legislature was reacting here to this\nproblem and observing what it observed on campus\nsomehow implicates different constitutional issues,\ndifferent first-amendment issues. And I think the\nO'Brien case stands as an obstacle to that argument.\nIn that case, if you look at it, the argument was\nexactly the same. There already was a prohibition that\nrequired you to have your draft card with you.\nCongress then passed a second statute that prohibited\nburning your draft card.\nNow, what did the Representatives say about\nthat? Well, Representative Bray, of Indiana, said that\nthis was an effort to get at \"communist stooges and\nbeatniks.\" Now, this Court did not strike the statute\ndown on that basis. It looked at the text of the\nstatute and upheld the statute as a reasonable statute.\nLet me also, then, move to what you could\ncall the \"Bob Jones problem.\" And I think you have to\nhave be cautious about interpreting this statute in\napplying a rule and having it come back in the context\nof other statutes that even the law schools like, like\nTitle VI and Title IX. I don't think it's enough to\nsimply say that race is going to be different. For one\nthing, Federal statutes also prohibit, as a condition\non funding, universitywide discrimination on the basis\nof disability and on the basis of age. Now, those\naren't things that trigger heightened scrutiny, and I\nthink one has to be worried about converting this rule\nin this case to something that's going to threaten\nthose statutes.\nThis Court, in Hishon, for example, made the\npoint that all discrimination can be recharacterized as\nsomebody simply saying -- exercising their\nassociational rights, \"I don't want to associate with\nyou, because you're female,\" in Hishon. You have to be\nleery of that kind of recharacterization.\nThe last point I would make is that there's\nsimply no limit on Respondent's argument in this case.\nI don't think their matter of conscious limitation is\ngoing to be enforceable by the courts. And, beyond\nthat, I think, even in this case, there is more at\nissue here than just the military's policy on\nhomosexuals. If you look at the original statement of\nthe American Association of Law Schools -- which is in\nthe joint appendix at 246 and 249 -- they were\nconcerned, first and foremost, about the military's\npolicies on homosexuals, but also about the\ndiscrimination in sex, on what kind of combat roles\nthat women could have, what they call career-advancing\npositions. So, even if Congress changed \"don't ask,\ndon't tell\" tomorrow, the -- presumably, the law\nschools would still be here protesting the military's\nposition on gender, or perhaps the war in Iraq, or\nperhaps the war in Afghanistan.\nAnd the last point in showing there is no\nlimits on their position is, as Justice Kennedy pointed\nout, any conduct can be imbued with communicative force\njust by saying, \"We're opposed to this, and, therefore,\nwe're going to engage in this conduct.\" That's simply\nnot enough to generate a significant first-amendment\ninterest.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, General.\n"
