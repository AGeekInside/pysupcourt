OLSON\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nGENERAL OLSON: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nAll three branches of our National Government\nhave repeatedly determined that pornography causes\nsubstantial, incalculable damage to our children, that\nassisting parents in protecting children from that damage\nis a compelling national interest, and that pornography is\nwidely available and readily accessible to our children on\nthe Internet.\nThe Child Online Protection Act is Congress'\nresponse to that urgent national problem. It was drafted\nafter testimony, hearings, and findings in direct response\nto explicit and detailed guidance in this Court's 1993\nReno v. ACLU decision explaining how to solve the problem\nof Internet pornography in a constitutional manner.\nCOPA directly responds to several of the Court's\nexplicit suggestions in its 1997 Reno v. ACLU decision.\nIn the first place, Congress gave explicit, substantive\nmeaning to the terms, harmful to minor, utilizing\nstandards developed over several decades by this Court\ndescribing what would be prohibited in the terms used by\nthis Court in the context of minors. I will not get into\nthe specifics of that, because those are before the Court,\nand the Court is quite familiar with them.\nThe Court also added, however, in response to\nthis Court's explicit suggestion, the third prong of the\nso-called Ginsberg-Miller test, that the material taken as\na whole would have to lack serious literary, artistic,\npolitical, or scientific value for minors, an objective\nstandard developed by this Court to protect the producers\nof communications. Congress limited the statute to\ncommercial pornographers at this Court's suggestion, those\nwhose trade or business, in an effort to produce profits,\nare engaged regularly in the production of explicit sexual\nmaterial for profit.\nQUESTION: In your view, is the provision that\nit has to be objectionable to minors, is that a national\nstandard?\nGENERAL OLSON: Well, as -- the reference to\ncommunity standards in the statute is in the first and\nsecond and prongs of a three-part test. This Court has\nintroduced that community standard provision to protect\nthe communicator from individualized determinations by\njurors, and from particularly sensitive, or particularly\ninsensitive communities.\nThe Court has explained again and again that it\nis an average standard. It is an adult approach to what\nmight be prohibited from the standpoint of damage to\nminors. The Court has repeatedly said that it might be --\nit doesn't refer to any specific geographic limitation.\nIn fact, in the Hamling case and in the Jenkins case\ndecided by this Court several years ago, the Court made it\nclear that the community standards prong does not have to\napply to any specific community.\nQUESTION: But Mr. Olson, isn't the problem with\nthat argument that the definition also refers to the\naverage person, so it's working average in by a separate\nprovision. If that is where the average comes in, then\ndoesn't the reference to community have to mean something\ngeographical if it's going to mean anything at all?\nGENERAL OLSON: Well, this Court has repeatedly\nsaid -- for example, in the Hamling case the Court was\nlooking at a geographic standard that covered the entire\nState of California. The Court said in Hamling and\nJenkins that the standard doesn't have to have any\nspecific geographic limitation.\nQUESTION: But did it -- did that -- and I just\ndon't remember this. Were we dealing there with a statute\nthat separately referred to kind of an average person\nstandard? Because the problem that I have here is, if you\nsay, well, it's -- what it's trying to get at is a norm,\nit's already built the norm in on a different textual\nbasis, and therefore if it's already built that into the\ndefinition, and it then additionally speaks of community\nstandard, then that's where I have the problem, so in the\ncase that you refer to, was the definition the same? Did\nit have the two prongs?\nGENERAL OLSON: Well, yes, because the Court was\nin that case applying the two -- the other two prongs that\nthis Court --\nQUESTION: No, no, but I mean, did it have the\naverage person provision in the definition?\nGENERAL OLSON: It wasn't in the definition in\nthe statute itself. It was what this Court read into --\nQUESTION: Okay. Well, now we've got it in the\nstatute itself, so in effect I guess you're saying the\nreference to community standard, or the reference to\naverage, one or the other, is essentially redundant in the\ndefinition.\nGENERAL OLSON: Well, it may be, but what the\nCongress was attempting to do was to develop and put into\nthe statute the protections which this Court over the\nyears have said are very important to protect the\ncommunicator.\nQUESTION: You're saying it's a belt and\nsuspenders definition.\nGENERAL OLSON: Well, what this Court has\ndecided is that something to prevent jurors from\ndeciding -- imposing their own individual standards, or\nimposing the least sensitive standards of the community,\nor the most sensitive standards of the community.\nQUESTION: General Olson, there's one thing that\nyou -- some new thing comes up in your brief. We go from\nMiller, where there was a geographical base, and I know\nyou said that the Internet is not geographical base, but\nyou use a term that, what is harmful to minors is\nreasonably constant across the United States. Now, is\nthat reasonably constant something looser than, say, the\nserious value as a limitation on what would qualify as\nharmful to minors?\nGENERAL OLSON: Well, there is two parts to\nthat. The serious value standard is an objective standard\nthat this Court and other courts are entitled to examine\nclosely, and have examined closely to make sure that there\naren't any aberrational prosecutions or limits imposed.\nWith respect to the community standards, what\nthe Congress was attempting to do was to make sure that\npeople didn't impose individual limitations with respect\nto how they were judging the material with respect to the\nother two prongs of the statute. I hope I have answered\nyour question, but --\nQUESTION: Well, the words that I used, they\ninvoke Miller, so it sounds like Congress didn't write any\nword formula that was any different, but you say\nsomething -- it's not --\nGENERAL OLSON: That was a finding, so to speak,\nby the House committee that there is not with respect --\nyears have changed since the Miller and the Hamling case.\nWe're now in an era of national television, national\nmedia -- some of those standards were articulated at a\ntime when the community of the United States was much more\nisolated and insular in various different parts. We are\nnow talking about a national media, national television,\nnational communication, the Internet reaching millions and\nmillions of households.\nWhat Congress felt, that there would not be\nsubstantial variation between what the average adult would\nfeel would be harmful to minors under the very specific,\nitemized, detailed standards, prong 1, prong 2, and then\nwith the value-added prong 3 --\nQUESTION: What was the basis for thinking that\nthe harmful to minors would be reasonably constant to a\ngreater extent than what is obscene?\nGENERAL OLSON: Well, the House report that\nspecifically talked about that did not explain. I should\nhasten to -- did not explain what the individual elected\nMembers of Congress were thinking when they came to those\nconclusions. I think it's a reasonable thing to conclude,\nis that Members of Congress are reflecting the judgments\nthat they develop as a result of running for office and\nbeing in a national legislature.\nThat's exactly what we expect Congress to do,\nand what Congress did in this case was apply those\nstandards, and those instincts, and those judgments in a\nway in which it was in every conscientious way attempting\nto comply with the instruction that came from this Court\nin Reno v. ACLU as to how to do it.\nQUESTION: Well, I think it's a difficult\nquestion. I don't know what the rule ought to be, but if\nyou have a trial in State A, say a western State,\nCalifornia, can you bring in an expert from New York and\nfrom five other States, experts to tell the jury what the\ncommunity standard is there, or does the trial judge rule\nthat irrelevant?\nGENERAL OLSON: Well, the courts have permitted\nexpert testimony with respect to that, but there's a great\ndeal of supervision that the trial courts and the\nappellate courts impose with respect to that to make sure\nthat these definitions are being applied in a\nnonaberrational --\nQUESTION: In your view, how does it work? I\nhave a California jury. Is it proper, or is it necessary\nfor that jury to consider what the standards are in other\nparts of the country before it returns its verdict?\nGENERAL OLSON: I would submit, Justice Kennedy,\nthat yes, that would be possible. The Hamling instruction\nI think is instructive. The Hamling instruction was the\nstandards generally held throughout this country\nconcerning sex, and matters pertaining to sex, the average\nconscience of the time, the present critical point in the\ncompromise between candor and shame at which the community\nmay have arrived at here and now.\nIn other words, that standard -- and the\ndefendant in that case argued to this Court that that is a\nnational standard which this Court in Miller said was not\nrequired as a matter of the First Amendment.\nInterestingly, in Hamling, the defendants in\nthat case argued just as the plaintiffs in this case do,\nthat a national standard is both required and would be\nprohibited. In other words, they want to have it both\nways.\nQUESTION: They want to have it neither way.\nGENERAL OLSON: They want to have it neither\nway. Either way, it would be unconstitutional, and this\nCourt has specifically addressed that by saying that it --\nthat jurors are allowed to draw from their experience,\nwhich necessarily comes from the community in which they\nreside, but that Congress felt in this case that there\nwould be relatively constant standards throughout the\ncountry. This is a facial challenge.\nQUESTION: Well, when you say relative --\nGENERAL OLSON: There's no evidence --\nQUESTION: You say relatively. I'd like you to\nbe specific. That is, would it satisfy you if this Court\nsaid, when it says the words, average person applying\ncontemporary community standards, we instruct the jury\nthat the word community means the United States taken as a\nwhole?\nGENERAL OLSON: I think that this Court has said\nthat that is not a requirement of the First Amendment, but\nfrom the --\nQUESTION: I know. I'm not saying it's a\nrequirement --\nGENERAL OLSON: Yes, sir.\nQUESTION: -- of the First Amendment. Suppose,\nhaving read the legislative history, I came to the\nconclusion that that, in light of all the constitutional\ndifficulties, is just what Congress had in mind, and\ntherefore I wrote in the opinion, community means the\nentire audience at which this is aimed, likely the entire\nUnited States.\nGENERAL OLSON: I --\nQUESTION: Now, if those words were in the\nopinion, would you consider that you had won this case?\nGENERAL OLSON: I think I would, Justice Breyer,\nand I think --\nQUESTION: So that satisfies you.\nGENERAL OLSON: And I think that would be a --\nthe statute is readily -- to use the words of this Court,\nthe statute is readily susceptible to the narrowing\nconstruction, if that's how you would regard that, or a\nleveling construction. I --\nQUESTION: Now, would you tell me what the\ndifference is between the construction that Justice Breyer\nhas suggested and the result of your argument that the\nthird prong, the value prong, is in fact an objective\nprong and hence a national -- I assume it's a national\nstandard. It's an objective prong, and therefore that in\neffect eliminates -- as I understand your argument, the\napplication of that prong eliminates a lot of the\nidiosyncracy that might conceivably come in under a strict\ngeographic standard.\nIs there a difference between the construction\nJustice Breyer is suggesting and the result that we would\nget if we accepted your argument about the effect of the\nthird prong?\nGENERAL OLSON: I don't think so. I think that\nwhat Justice Breyer is suggesting is a jury instruction or\na judicial construction which would apply to prongs 1 and\n2, and that what you're saying is absolutely correct also,\nwe submit, that that is precisely what this Court has said\nthat third prong is there for. I should --\nQUESTION: Oh, I wasn't necessarily saying it.\nI was saying that I think you're saying it.\nGENERAL OLSON: Well then, I agree with your\nconstruction of what I'm saying.\nQUESTION: Of you, okay.\n(Laughter.)\nGENERAL OLSON: I think it's a very important\npoint to make, that the Court has said that that is\nanother way in which we protect the speaker from\naberrational, highly --\nQUESTION: Well, but aren't you then saying to\nus that Congress, when it used the word community, really\nmeant to say national?\nQUESTION: Yes.\nQUESTION: Yes.\nGENERAL OLSON: Well, I suspect, Justice\nStevens, that the people who assisted the Members of\nCongress in drafting the statute read this Court's\ndecisions, as there's every indication in the two\ncommittee reports and in the hearings that were taken,\nthat the Court was attempting in every way to live up to\nthe standards of this Court. This Court was saying that\nthe First Amendment does not require a national standard\nwith respect to community standards, but this Court has\nnot been entirely --\nQUESTION: I think you're answering my question\nby saying yes.\nGENERAL OLSON: Well, what I think -- no, I\ndon't necessarily think that the Court -- that the\nCongress was intending to impose a national standard,\nbecause this Court had said that it wasn't required under\nthe First Amendment, and that the community standards did\nnot have to be judged by any particular geographical area.\nQUESTION: I'm not trying to find out what the\nConstitution requires or what our cases might have\nrequired. I'm just asking you what you think the word\ncommunity means, as used in this section of the statute.\nGENERAL OLSON: Well, I think what Congress was\nattempting to do was come as close as possible to adopting\nwhat this Court had said in the context of obscenity.\nNow, I should hasten to say that to the extent\nthat the Third Circuit felt that the community standards\nmakes it unconstitutional in the context of the Internet,\nthat -- those community standards are -- this statute\nprohibits obscene material on the Internet, too, and\ncommunity standards don't work for material which is\nharmful to minors. They don't work probably for\nobscenity, either.\nQUESTION: I don't know where we are here --\nQUESTION: Do you think it's possible for a\nNorth Carolina jury to sit in judgment of a particular\npornographic transmission and decide whether this would\noffend the standards of Las Vegas and New York City? I\nmean, doesn't any jury necessarily apply the standards of\nits own community? Aren't we really talking about an\nimaginary distinction here?\nGENERAL OLSON: Well, yes, Justice --\nQUESTION: Let's assume that you instruct the\njury, jury, you must apply a national standard. What does\nsomeone who's been raised his whole life in North Carolina\nknow about Las Vegas?\nGENERAL OLSON: Well, I would submit that the\njudge would instruct the jury, and the judge examining the\ndecision of the jury afterwards in appellate courts would\ndo exactly what this Court has said.\nAs long as the juror is attempting to apply his\njudgment or her judgment with respect to adult\nperceptions, based upon all the input that the juror may\nhave with respect to what is generally harmful to\nminors -- the dilemma that this has caused, causes here,\nboth for Congress and here in this Court, is that we want\non the one hand to make sure that idiosyncratic judgments\nare not being imposed on the transmitter of information.\nOn the other hand, we don't want such wide variations that\nthere would be difference in community --\nQUESTION: I suppose a defendant could call an\nexpert witness in the case in North Carolina and say that\nin New York this is fine. I don't know how much attention\na North Carolina jury would pay to that.\nGENERAL OLSON: I think the defendants can put\non expert testimony with respect to what general standards\nare, to use the phrase in Hamling, country-wide. Now, I\nshould say --\nQUESTION: But then the trial judge must\ninstruct the jury, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, this\nis a national standard, and that's consistent with what\nJustice Breyer suggested to you, that we might consider in\nputting in the opinion, so it's a national standard.\nGENERAL OLSON: I'm not objecting to that. If\nthat is the readily accessible --\nQUESTION: I think we're asking what the\nCourt -- which the Congress wanted. Now, I can sympathize\nwith the Congress when they're not exactly clear on what\nthis Court's decisions mean, but we need to know how it\nought to apply to this case in the context of the\nInternet. The Internet would be very different than a\nlocal bookstore.\nGENERAL OLSON: I think that is a reasonable\nsolution to the problem, and is consistent with what\nCongress was saying.\nCongress was also aware that this Court has said\nover and over again that the same material may be judged\ndifferently by different juries from place to place, and\nthat that is not a constitutional impediment. This Court\nhas also said --\nQUESTION: General Olson, in this context, if\nyou could -- I didn't get a clear answer to my question.\nMaybe I'll put it this way. Is there greater judicial\ncontrol, either by the trial judge or the appellate judge,\nwith respect to the serious value standard than there is\nwith respect to the national standard for community --\nGENERAL OLSON: Yes. That's what this Court has\nsaid again and again, and we of course accept that, and\nthat is -- Congress accepted that as well.\nQUESTION: And is your point, then, we first\ntake out that category. If it's serious value, it's out.\nGENERAL OLSON: Yes.\nQUESTION: And it's only when it doesn't have\nserious value, then you get into the question of\nnational --\nGENERAL OLSON: Yes, that's right, but remember\nthat -- it seems important to emphasize that these\ndefinitions are highly specific with respect to the\nmaterial which is prohibited. It's not just saying to\njurors -- the obscenity statute doesn't have any of these\nlimitations in it.\n18 U.S.C. 466 just talks in very, very general\nterms, so what Congress was trying to do here is be much\nmore specific than the obscenity statute, which this Court\nhas accepted for 30 or 40 years by importing these kinds\nof definitions into it. What Congress felt it was doing\nresponsively was not only defining what was prohibited\nvery specifically, but then incorporating those specific\nstandards, just as you suggest, Justice Ginsburg.\nThe other thing that this Court has said is that\nthose who are choosing a medium to make available to\nchildren material which is harmful to children, over which\nthe person who is disseminating that information, those\nwho wantonly decide to pollute the stream from which we\nall drink have a responsibility to take the minimal steps\nnecessary to reduce the harm that's being caused by\nputting that material into the stream.\nWhat we have as a result of this are substantive\nstandards that Congress developed based upon the teachings\nof this Court with respect to obscenity, applying those\nstandards to minors, as this Court suggested is\nappropriate and a part of a compelling national interest\nin the Ginsberg case, the Ferber case, and Sable case, and\nother cases where the Court has suggested that something\nhas to be done, and is entirely appropriate to be done\nwith respect to minors.\nAnd then the third thing that Congress did was\nadopt a solution to the problem which is consistent with\nwhat 48 or so States have in these blinder laws, magazine\nracks displays, the books, materials that this Court\nconsidered in the American Booksellers case with respect\nto what would be permissible to prevent children from\nseeing damaging materials in bookstores.\nNow, that is -- so what we have as a result of\nCOPA, Congress listening to this Court, lowering the age\nto 16 and under, making it apply to commercial speech and\nnoncommercial speech, returning parental control, adopting\na device that this Court has considered in the Sable case\nand considered in this case. The language of this Court's\ndecision in Reno v. ACLU said that the age verification\nsystem is technologically and economically feasible, is\nalready in use, and would provide a defense to those\ncommercial purveyors of pornography, so Congress listened\nto that, adopted that system, put into place for the\nInternet the same standard that already exists in the 48-\nState blinder laws with respect to access of minors to\nthese materials, so --\nQUESTION: Did Congress take account in any of\nthis -- I mean, one objection that's raised is, it's all\nfutile, because you're just giving competitors from\nabroad -- they will come in and fill the gap if U.S.\nproviders are not available. You're not going to be\nsaving children. You'll just be getting it from outside\nthe U.S.\nGENERAL OLSON: Well, the Congress did\nexplicitly consider that. COPA applied to material in\ninterstate or foreign commerce. The Government will\nprosecute where it can material that comes in from abroad\nwhere it's capable of doing it, but Congress also\nrecognized that it would not -- was not going to allow the\nperfect to be the enemy of the good. It was going to deal\nwith those problems, or those portions of the problem that\nit could address.\nNow, we understand and we have acknowledged that\nit may well be that there are circumstances under which\nthese limitations can be avoided. There may be certain\nforeign purveyors that Government are not able to track\ndown or obtain jurisdiction over, but what Congress was\ntrying to do is deal with as much of the problem as it\ncould in as constitutional a manner as possible.\nQUESTION: And maybe Congress wouldn't mind even\nif the child pornography industry flourished, at least\ndrive it overseas. That wouldn't exactly be a bad result,\nwould it --\nGENERAL OLSON: Well --\nQUESTION: -- in Congress' mind?\nGENERAL OLSON: Well, I think -- and the Court\nconsidered a case earlier this year of the damage that\nthat industry does, earlier this term. Yes, there's two\nparts to that, Justice Scalia, the damage of the industry,\nthe domestic industry itself is incalculable, but the\ndamage to the recipient, to the children, are also\nincalculable, so that might address part of the problem,\nbut Congress in this --\nQUESTION: But here, at least from the exhibits\nthat you gave us, it doesn't seem that this material --\nthere are no virtual children, no real children. This is\nadult stuff, at least.\nGENERAL OLSON: Yes. We're not talking about\nthat aspect of the issue that you're considering in that\nother case, but what I was simply trying to address is\nJustice Scalia's question, that this is a major problem.\nWe understand from the legislative history that explicit,\nadult material, not just on the Internet, is an $8 billion\nindustry. According to what Congress decided in this\ncase, there are 28,000 sexually explicit commercial\npornography sites on the Internet.\nThis is readily accessible to children. It is\nalmost -- anyone with any experience with the Internet\nwill tell you that children can find it readily, and find\nit as long as they can type and read they will find it,\nand will find it by accident, and once they find it by\naccident -- the House committee points out that if you\ntype in the words, White House, www.whitehouse.com, you\nwill find offensive, explicit pornography, and it's very\nhard to get rid of.\nQUESTION: And much of it you say -- if I\nunderstand you correctly, you -- this law doesn't touch --\nI mean, I was impressed at that set of exhibits. You\nsingled out three that you said would not be excluded as a\nmatter of law.\nGENERAL OLSON: Possibly.\nQUESTION: Oh. So you're saying maybe the\nothers --\nGENERAL OLSON: Well, one of the ones that we\nwere concerned about is a series of very explicit\npictures, and I think the Court knows which ones I'm\ntalking about. We -- I went and did some additional\nresearch on that. That is -- that are photographs of an\nart exhibit, and one art gallery that was several years\nago that is a small portion of a large compilation.\nJustice Ginsburg, I think that -- I don't know how that\nwould come out when all of the evidence came in with\nrespect to that.\nThose photographs were pulled out of context and\nput in the exhibits. That's why this material has to be\nlooked at as a whole, under these specific standards.\nI'd like to reserve the remaining part of my\ntime for rebuttal, except to say that this is a facial\nchallenge, and we are dealing with the possibility of\nstriking down or not allowing the enforcement of a statute\nwhich we -- this Court and Congress and the executive\nbranch is a necessary, narrowly tailored, carefully\ncrafted solution to a desperate problem.\nQUESTION: Thank you, General Olson.\nMs. Beeson, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF ANN E. BEESON\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMS. BEESON: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nCOPA, just like the Communications Decency Act,\nmakes it a crime to communicate protected speech to adults\non the World Wide Web. The Government, as Justice\nGinsburg just noted, has now conceded that COPA applies to\nmuch more than commercial pornographers. They say in\ntheir reply brief that under COPA they can prosecute a\npopular online magazine, Salon Magazine, one of our\nclients, and the leading fine art vendor on the web for\nproviding a few items that are deemed harmful to minors on\ntheir web site.\nThe affirmative defenses in COPA --\nQUESTION: Excuse me. If they're providing\nthose items, and if those items are pornographic, then\nthey are commercially in the pornography business. What\ndifference does it make that they do other business as\nwell?\nMS. BEESON: Justice --\nQUESTION: I don't see why Salon or any other\ncommercial operator should be immune by saying, well, you\nknow, all of my business isn't pornography, just a little\nbit.\nMS. BEESON: Justice Scalia, whether or not we\ntalk about them as commercial pornographers, the fact is,\nthe speech they communicate, which even the Government I\ndon't think would label them commercial pornographers in\nthe sense that we imagine, first of all, two of the three\nexhibits are not pictures at all. They're written text.\nThey're stories, and the point is that all of this speech,\nby definition, all of the speech targeted by this law is\nby definition protected for adults.\nThis statute would make it a crime for speakers\nto make that information available, and the defenses\nsimply do not solve the problems. They're the same two\ndefenses that were in the first statute. There's no\nchange at all, credit cards or adult access codes.\nQUESTION: Can you think of an example of\nsomething that would have serious literary, artistic,\npolitical, or scientific value for an adult, but it would\nnot have it for a 17-year-old?\nMS. BEESON: Yes, Your Honor. I think that --\nQUESTION: You can?\nMS. BEESON: I think that all --\nQUESTION: I've had trouble.\nQUESTION: 16-year-old.\nMS. BEESON: I think that all of our client's\nexhibits are precisely that sort of material, and that, of\ncourse --\nQUESTION: You think -- I looked at some of the\nexhibits, and I think 17-year-olds are pretty\nsophisticated, and I don't understand why they wouldn't\nhave, Salon Magazine, the same kind of value for a 17-\nyear-old that they have for a 21-year-old.\nMS. BEESON: Your Honor, the --\nQUESTION: It's 16, actually, isn't it? We're\ntalking about 16 years old.\nMS. BEESON: Yes, I think it is 16, in fact.\nQUESTION: All right, 16 -- 16.\nMS. BEESON: There are --\nQUESTION: There are even quite mature 16-year-\nolds who know about --\n(Laughter.)\nMS. BEESON: There are many communities in this\ncountry --\nQUESTION: That's, I think, the question in the\ncase, correct. You're saying in some communities --\nsorry, I didn't --\nMS. BEESON: I'm saying -- perhaps in even most\ncommunities that believe that providing any information\nabout experiencing sexual pleasure, about sex toys, to\nteenagers, is sinful and is definitely harmful, and --\nQUESTION: That's probably so, but I mean, what\nJustice Breyer is addressing and what I was concerned with\nwith Mr. Olson was his argument that the third prong, the\nvalue prong, in effect, sort of sands off the rough edges,\nand it gets the -- in practical terms it gets the\ncommunity peculiarity out of it, and is that -- obviously\nyou don't agree with it. Why is he wrong in that?\nMS. BEESON: Your Honor, first of all, I think\nbecause all of the millions of speakers, including our\nclients on the web, they are the ones that have to\nunderstand this law, and as Mitch Pepper, who runs a\nSexual Health Network which provides specific information\nabout how to experience sexual pleasure to disabled\npersons, testified, I think very strongly, based on my\ninterpretation of the words in this statute, even with the\nserious value prong, that value prong is value for minors,\nand he has to believe, as he testified, that discussion of\nmasturbation, oral sex, anal sex, descriptive positioning,\nall of that can be construed as pandering to the prurient\ninterest of minors.\nThose are the -- these are the speakers who are\ngoing to be subjected to criminal prosecution under this\nlaw, and let me clear, our clients don't ever want to come\nbefore a jury. That's the problem, of course. They --\nQUESTION: Oh, but the particular issue is\nreally not the third prong. That's not before us, I take\nit. The issue before us is the question of community\nstandards, and so does it satisfy you if the Court were to\nsay -- or, say I wrote an opinion. I'm just thinking of\nmyself -- write an opinion that says, the word community\nstandards does not mean individual localities. It does\nmean the Nation.\nMS. BEESON: Absolutely not, Your Honor, for two\nreasons which I want to explain. First of all, under\neither standard this statute is unconstitutional, and that\nis clear, and that is because of the very strong deterrent\neffect it has on adult speech. Through all of these\nspeakers who are targeted under this law, they really have\nonly two choices, and just to give one example --\nQUESTION: That was true in Hamling, too. There\nwas considerable deterrence, just because you didn't\nknow -- if you sent stuff Nation-wide, you didn't know\nwhere you might be prosecuted.\nMS. BEESON: Mr. Chief Justice, there's a very\nreal distinction here, and that is that Hamling was about\nthe obscenity standard and this is about the harmful-to-\nminors standard, and my point is that --\nQUESTION: Just a minute. Will you explain why\nyou think that's a distinction?\nMS. BEESON: Because by definition all of the\nmaterial targeted by the statute is protected speech for\nadults. Adults have the right to access it, even though\nchildren don't. In the obscenity context, obviously, even\nadults don't have the right to access the material.\nQUESTION: No, that's true, but you run --\npeople in Hamling ran the same risk. They may have\nthought their stuff would not be found to be subject to\nthe community standard, but a jury might find otherwise,\nso that's just what you're complaining about.\nMS. BEESON: Well, the range of speech, however,\nof course, protected speech that is limited by the -- by\nany harmful-to-minors display statute. It's just by\ndefinition greater, again because the entire category of\nspeech is protected for adults. It's not like you're just\narguing about the margin of what is obscene for everyone.\nQUESTION: Well, in obscenity cases, whether it\nwas obscenity or not depended upon the community\nstandards, so you were really taking your chance when you\npublished something nationally you were subject to the\nleast -- highest common denominator of obscenity. Why\nshould it be any different for pornography than it is with\nobscenity? It seems to me that Hamling and the other\ncases establish that it is no violation of the First\nAmendment to subject a publisher to differing standards\nthroughout the country. If we did it for obscenity, I\ndon't know why we cannot do it for pornography.\nMS. BEESON: Again, most importantly, Your\nHonor, under any standard -- under any standard, COPA is\nunconstitutional --\nQUESTION: Okay --\nMS. BEESON: -- because it would deter such a\ngreat amount of adults from accessing --\nQUESTION: But going back to Justice Breyer's\nquestion, if we construed the statute the way he has\nsuggested, isn't it clear that we would have to vacate the\njudgment in this case and send it back? We're not here to\nmake a final judgment on the statute. We're reviewing the\ninjunction, and if we construed it his way, we would have\nto vacate, wouldn't we?\nMS. BEESON: Your Honor, I don't believe so,\nbecause we have a very strong record here, which again the\nThird Circuit explicitly affirmed the findings of fact by\nthe district court that show that adults are going to be\ndeterred by this law, and that is because what the law\nrequires is that you put screens in front of all of the\nmaterial that again is protected to adults, and by\ndefinition, if you're Different Light Bookstore, which is\none of our clients --\nQUESTION: But that's not a community standards\nproblem.\nMS. BEESON: It's a -- Your Honor, it's a\nburden-on-speech problem.\nQUESTION: Yes, but I --\nQUESTION: It may be a burden on speech, but\nlook at the question we took.\nQUESTION: I'm trying to get you to ask --\nanswer one specific question, and I'll try once more, all\nright.\nThe question in front of us, presented is\nwhether the court of appeals properly barred enforcement\non First Amendment grounds because the statute relies on\ncommunity standards to identify material that is harmful\nto minors. That's the question before us. You have 17\nreasons why this statute is unconstitutional. I'd like\nyou, for the purpose of this question, to forget about\nthose 17 reasons. I want to know if, in respect to this\none reason, that the community standards -- that's what's\nin the question -- if we were to say the word community\nmeans national, then would you concede -- would you say\nyou've won, or you've lost, or --\nMS. BEESON: Yes.\nQUESTION: That -- how does that affect the\ncase, to answer that question nationally?\nMS. BEESON: Yes, and our answer is that even\nunder a national standard this law clearly violates the\nFirst Amendment.\nQUESTION: I know that, but is the right thing\nto do, then, for us to say, court of appeals, you were\nwrong about the meaning of the word, community standards.\nIt is a national standard. There may be other things\nwrong with this statute, in which case, go and consider\nthem, but this isn't one of them.\nMS. BEESON: Your Honor, we -- again, if that\nwere the course that you decided to take, we do not think\nthat the appropriate thing would be to vacate the\ninjunction, but whether to leave the injunction in place,\nand then --\nQUESTION: Not vacating the injunction, vacate\nthe order of the court of appeals and say, you consider\nthese other points.\nMS. BEESON: Again, Your Honor, I don't think\nthat that would be a helpful or useful exercise in this\ncase, because of both the strong facts we're working on\nand also just to talk about the problem of the national\nstandard which, of course, was referred to when Mr. Olson\nwas speaking.\nYou know, as the Court said in Miller, a\nnational standard would be an exercise in futility. Will\njurors have to decide base on their own sense of community\nstandards whether or not something is patently offensive\nand prurient?\nQUESTION: But why is it okay for obscenity but\nnot okay here for -- not for -- I'm putting it too\nfavorably. It isn't okay for obscenity. It is okay for\ntaking your chance on whether what you publish is obscene.\nMS. BEESON: And the --\nQUESTION: But it's not okay for taking your\nchance on whether what you publish is pornographic and\nharmful to minors. Why should there be any difference\nbetween the two?\nMS. BEESON: Well, for one reason of course, one\nof the crucial distinctions here is the nature of the\nInternet, and that is one of the arguments that the Third\nCircuit discussed. It is very distinct from handling in\nSable in the sense that this is not a situation where\npeople who put their speech up on the web have any way of\nlimiting their speech to only certain communities.\nQUESTION: But you're only talking about\ncommercial speech, something that people are going to have\nto pay to see.\nMS. BEESON: Justice O'Connor, the Congress very\nexplicitly wrote the definition of commercial speech in\nthis statute so broadly that it applies to much more than\npeople who primarily communicate what is termed commercial\npornography.\nThat was the point before. They explicitly said\nthat anyone who includes any material that is harmful to\nminors is covered by the law, and again, according to the\nconcession in the Government's reply brief, if you're\nartnet.com, one of the leading fine art vendors, and you\nhave a series of Andre Serano photographs on your site,\nyou can be prosecuted, and also, of course, this is not\nmaterial that is for sale.\nThere is no requirement that you're actually\nselling the material. It's only that you intend to make a\nprofit. As the district court found, the vast majority of\ncontent on the web is available for free to users.\nQUESTION: Well, Hamling didn't rely at all, the\nopinion in Hamling, on the fact that the people could\nchoose where to circulate. I mean, they in effect said,\nyou do it at your own risk.\nMS. BEESON: Your Honor, I think that's a very\ndifferent conclusion to reach when you're talking about an\nenvironment in which you can control where you send the\nmaterial. If you're a regular magazine distributor, you\nknow where you're sending your magazines. On the web --\nQUESTION: Do you mean --\nMS. BEESON: -- if you want to communicate\nlocally, you can't.\nQUESTION: You mean, we would have to make this\nexception even for obscenity, even for out-and-out stuff\nthat's so far beyond that it's not even just pornography.\nYou would say we could not allow community standards to be\napplied --\nMS. BEESON: Your Honor --\nQUESTION: -- on the web, for obscenity.\nMS. BEESON: We think that that is a very\ndifferent question, and that is not a necessary conclusion\nfor the reason that I said before and that is because, by\ndefinition, a national standard for what is displayed as\nharmful to minors on the web would impact far more\nprotected speech than a national standard for obscenity,\nwhich is by definition unprotected for adults as well as\nminors, and to put it another way, no adult has the right\nto materials that are obscene in even the most tolerant\ncommunity.\nQUESTION: It seems --\nMS. BEESON: All adults have the right to\nmaterials.\nQUESTION: -- the issue is how\nunconstitutionally unfair it is to the publisher,\nregardless of how many publishers are covered. You're\nsaying it's okay to do this for obscenity but somehow not\nfor pornography. It seems to me if subjecting you to a\nrisk Nation-wide is an unconstitutional thing, you're\ngoing to go to jail just the same, whether you're going to\njail for pornography or obscenity.\nMS. BEESON: We are saying --\nQUESTION: If we cannot use community standards\nfor this, I don't see why we can use it for obscenity.\nMS. BEESON: We, of course, don't think you need\nto even reach that question, but to the extent that you\ndo, again, I think that it is quite a different question\nbecause of the amount of protected speech that is\nimpacted. It's just not -- it is not so clear that\nunder -- with obscenity a national standard would be\nnearly as problematic as it would when you're talking\nabout making available materials which are clearly, by\ndefinition, protected for adults to receive.\nWhat COPA does is to prevent speakers from doing\nthat, and requires them to make this unwelcome choice,\nwhich is, you either set up costly screens that the record\nshows are going to drive away your users, or you self-\nsensor, and if you're a Different Light Bookstore, or you\nare the Sexual Health Network, or you're the artnet, a\nfine art vendor, it's only rational, and of course they\ntestified to this, you are going to self-censure, because\nthat was the only option that will ensure that you're not\nprosecuted.\nQUESTION: But what about the Government's\nposition that of all the exhibits that are at least in the\nrecord presented to us, there's only three that they say,\neven as a matter of law, might be subject to prosecution,\nso they're giving you a clean bill of health on all these\nothers, and they say it's really a very narrow category,\nnot the broad category that you're describing.\nMS. BEESON: Justice Ginsburg, in fact that\nconcession in the reply brief makes us more nervous than\never, and that is because the Government has changed their\nmind. They very clearly argued at the district court that\nour clients, none of our clients even had standing to\nraise the constitutionality of this action because they\nwere so clearly protected.\nNow, suddenly, here we are before the Supreme\nCourt, and they say, oh, no, we changed our minds, some of\nthem can be prosecuted. That very much implies that they\ncould change their mind again in the future --\nQUESTION: Ms. Beeson --\nMS. BEESON: -- and in fact the speech is\nindistinguishable from many other exhibits that are in the\njoint appendix before you.\nQUESTION: Ms. Beeson, let's talk about artnet.\nDo you really think that when artnet puts out the Andre\nSerano photographs, do you think it expects to avoid being\nheld under this statute because of 6(a), that it would\nhope that the average person applying contemporary\ncommunity standards would find this material as a whole\nnot designed to appeal to or pander to the prurient\ninterest, or do you rather think that artnet's protection\nwould surely be sought under (c), namely, that the\nmaterial taken as a whole possesses serious literary,\nartistic, political, or scientific value? Isn't that\ntheir real protection?\nMS. BEESON: Your Honor, they really do not\nbelieve it is their protection, and that again is because\nit says, serious value for minors, and that, of course, is\none of the primary distinctions between this category and\nobscenity. There are many people who would think that the\nfine art --\nQUESTION: The national standard -- I guess I\nhave to go back to that, but I didn't get an answer.\nRight now, your clients could worry that they would be\nprosecuted under the Miller standard, and the only\ndifference is minors, and so I find it very hard to think\nof an artistic work that one would say has serious value\nto a 21-year-old but not to a 16-year-old. That, to me,\nseems impossible.\nNow, you give me an example of such a thing.\nMS. BEESON: Well, Your Honor, the Government\nitself is saying that art --\nQUESTION: That's their opinion. I'm asking for\nyour opinion.\nMS. BEESON: I'm sorry, Your Honor, but they're\nthe ones that are going to prosecute my clients.\nQUESTION: That may be, but the very fact that\nyour clients could be prosecuted does not mean they win\nthis case, because after all, they might be prosecuted\nunder Miller, too, and everyone agrees that that's the\nlaw, so I'm asking you for your opinion, if you can find\nan example of a work of art that would have serious value\nfor a 21-year-old but not for a minor, and I'm telling you\nI can't think of one, and the reason that I ask you is,\nI'd like you to try to think of one.\nMS. BEESON: Your Honor, with respect, we\nbelieve that all of the exhibits that we have put in, the\nartistic ones and the literary works, the column, the nude\nartworks by several clients, all of these could be\ntargeted under the statute, and again, what the effect,\nthe First Amendment effect of the statute is whether or\nnot our clients legitimately feel like they have to self-\ncensure under this law as compared to the obscenity law.\nThey don't believe that their works are obscene.\nThey know that some communities will find them harmful to\nminors, and for that reason what they are going to do is,\nthey're going to self-censure, and what it's going to\neffectively do is have COPA driving a certain category of\nspeech protected for adults from the marketplace of ideas\nthat is the web.\nQUESTION: Are you saying that you have to give\nsome effect to Congress' words? It didn't say serious\nvalue, period. It said, to minors, and that's different\nfrom serious value that we're accustomed to dealing with\nin the obscenity area, so for the Court to say, well,\nCongress just used those words, they didn't mean anything.\nThat's I suppose what you're saying is of concern.\nMS. BEESON: Yes, Your Honor, and the history of\nthe harmful-to-minors definition, that is one of the\nprimary points. The point is that even though people\nmight think that artistic words that are explicit, and you\nknow, references to homosexuality that are explicit, have\nvalue for adults, many, if not most communities find that\nthat same material does not have value for minors.\nAnd again, to address your question, too,\nJustice Breyer, about the 16-year-old or the 17-year-old,\nthere is nothing in this statute that defines minor as the\n16-year-old. The Government has been, again, pushing an\ninterpretation of that statute.\nQUESTION: But I thought you might -- I mean, I\nthought that the word, for example, for minors comes out\nof cases that permit the Government to require certain\nmagazines to be placed in certain places in the\nbookstores, or in the retail shops, with brown covers, so\nperhaps there's some experience, since we have worked with\nthe words, for minors, of something that has to be done\nunder that law, but doesn't fall within Miller.\nI mean, I just wanted to get your views on it.\nMS. BEESON: Yes, absolutely. I think there\nhaven't been that many cases on the books because, again,\nthose statutes are much easier to comply with, and that's\nwhat the courts have found, but even in those cases the\ncourt has looked very carefully at whether or not there\nwas a significant deterrence effect on adults, and in the\nblinder rack cases, none of which dealt with the unique\nnature of the online medium, in which, as our records\nshowed, up to 75 percent of users would be deterred from\naccessing speech that had a screen in front of it. Now,\nthat is the finding of the district court.\nThe blinder rack cases didn't deal with that\nkind of situation. None of them would require adults to\ndisclose their identity, or to register before obtaining\nthe access to protected speech, and there is certainly no\nrecord of the strong deterrence, and importantly, in those\ncases there was no record of an equally effective\nalternative, and that is something that I really think we\nneed to get to, because here the district court\nspecifically found that there was an alternative that was\nequally effective, and that is the use of blocking\nsoftware, user-based blocking programs, and in fact --\nQUESTION: But you're saying that it -- you're\nsaying, which was an issue last time around, it's up to\nthe parent, Government can do nothing. The blocking, I\ntake it, is something that the parent would buy and\ninstall. The question is whether Government can do\nanything, and I think your answer is no.\nMS. BEESON: Your Honor, we believe that\nCongress did two things already that we're not challenging\nhere. First of all, it established a study commission to\nlook into other options for protecting children, and after\nthe statute was enacted, that same study commission,\nCongress -- and so I don't think, with respect to Mr.\nOlson, that he's correct that all three branches of\nGovernment are on the same wavelength here. I think that\nwe have some difference, and that is, Congress' own\ncommission has now concluded also, which is equal to the\ndistrict court's findings, that user-based blocking\nsoftware is actually more effective than credit card and\nadult access code screening.\nJust to remind the Court also that the Court\nspecifically found that the Government didn't prove the\nlast time around, in Reno v. ACLU, that those screening\ntechniques, credit card and adult access codes, will\nactually prevent minors from accessing the content. The\nsame is true here. There's no evidence that those are\nactually effective, whereas the district court\nspecifically found user-based alternatives are effective,\nand then Congress' own commission concluded the same\nthing.\nQUESTION: Well, of course, all this goes to\nthese other aspects of the statute. As I understand where\nwe are in the argument, the court of appeals decided for\nreasons that I think we cannot criticize on this record\nthat it's going to sustain this injunction based on the\ncommunity standards problem, and we're asking you, if the\ncommunity standard is national, doesn't that solve that\nproblem, and I'm coming away from this argument with the\nimpression that you're saying, well, I'm not going to\nbother to help you on that, because there are so many\nother things in the statute I want to talk about.\nMS. BEESON: Yes, I'm sorry.\nQUESTION: But that doesn't help me answer this\nquestion.\nMS. BEESON: Right, and I don't mean to leave\nthat impression. I -- what I'm saying clearly is that we\nbelieve that even if you were to read a national standard,\nit would be unconstitutional, because the real effect\nwould be precisely the same as the local community\nstandards interpretation is, and that is, the least\ntolerant community would get to set the standards for\neveryone on the web, since web speakers have no way to\ndetermine where their audience is.\nQUESTION: But is it not true that --\nQUESTION: Then you're saying that a national\nstandard can't be enforced with any jury.\nMS. BEESON: I don't think that it can, because\nagain jurors are going to have to enforce that. You're\ngoing to have to have still a jury decide what is patently\noffensive and prurient, and I think they're going to do\nthat naturally based on where they're physically located,\nin their own community.\nQUESTION: Then you're -- and I don't mean this\ndismissively, but I think we have to accept this. You're\nsaying there in fact is no way to regulate this.\nMS. BEESON: Your Honor, I'm saying that there\nisn't any way to make it a crime to display material\nharmful to minors on the web.\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMS. BEESON: That is our position, and again,\nthat we believe is very consistent with many other\nstatutes that have recently been struck down by the Court.\nJust last term in the Playboy case, in, you know,\nobviously the Reno v. ACLU case, the Denver Area case, I\nmean, in the last 20 years I count at least six statutes,\nsome of which weren't even criminal statutes like this\none, which I think has an even stronger potential for\nchilling speech, that were struck down because of the\nburden on adult speech.\nQUESTION: No, but I'm not -- again, I'm not\nasking you the global question.\nMS. BEESON: I understand.\nQUESTION: I'm just asking you the question that\ngoes to the specific issue that we took for review, and\nthat is the legitimacy of basing an injunction, or\nsustaining the district court's injunction on the\ncommunity standards portion of the statute, and my\nquestion to you is simply, I take it you're saying that\nthere is no way to write a standard into the statute, call\nit community, call it national, call it some third thing\nthat you dream up, that will ever suffice\nconstitutionally.\nForgetting the rest of the statute, forgetting\nthe rest of the problem, just on the touchstone of the\nstandard, there's no way to do it, and I think your answer\nis no, there is no way to do it.\nMS. BEESON: There is no way to do it, and\nagain, I do want to be clear that I think that we can\ndivorce the rest of the language of the statute, even\naside from the deterrence issues, and what I mean by that\nis, because the statute was written so broadly as to cover\nanybody who had even just one image, for example, because\nthe statute was written to include not just images but\ntext, I think, you know, I think those problems still\nremain even just looking at the textual language, even if\nyou're focusing just on the community standard versus the\nnational standard, and that's another reason why we don't\nthink that fixing that problem is enough to save the\nstatute.\nQUESTION: May I ask another sort of general\nquestion? Do you think there's any way in which Congress\ncan deal with the problem of what they call teasers, which\neveryone would agree would violate the standard here, and\nwould also not have serious artistic value?\nMS. BEESON: Your Honor, one way they could do\nthat, of course, is through more vigorous prosecution of\nobscenity and child pornography, which again --\nQUESTION: No, no, I'm assuming nonobscene --\nMS. BEESON: Nonobscene.\nQUESTION: -- but clearly pornographic teasers.\nMS. BEESON: Well, I mean, I of course don't\nwant to be the one to rewrite the statute, but I do think,\nas I suggested before, that if they --\nQUESTION: But I'm asking if it's your position\nthat that's beyond the power of Congress to control.\nMS. BEESON: I think that a statute that did\njust apply, for example, to web sites who were actually\nselling things already -- this one isn't limited to\nthat -- and secondly, web sites who the predominant\nportion of their site was actually harmful to minors.\nThat would certainly be closer to just addressing teasers\nthan this statute is.\nQUESTION: You still haven't answered my\nquestion. My question is whether it's beyond the power of\nCongress to control the teaser problem.\nMS. BEESON: Justice Stevens, my answer is that\nI think if they wrote a statute -- are you asking me\nwhether I think that statute would be unconstitutional\nalso, because of course, I have to argue yes, it would be,\nbut it would certainly be -- you don't have to believe me\non that.\n(Laughter.)\nMS. BEESON: Obviously, and you know, just to be\nclear --\nQUESTION: Just on this one, right?\nMS. BEESON: -- that would be -- that's what I\nmean. That's a very different statute than this one. It\nwould be one narrowly tailored to the --\nQUESTION: No, but one of the things we have to\nbe concerned with is, there is a genuine problem that\nCongress is trying to address, and if your position is you\njust forget about it, that you've got to live with the\nproblem, that's quite a different position than if you\nthink, well, there's a less restrictive alternative that\nwould accomplish what the Congress is trying to do, and\nyou're suggesting to me there isn't a less restrictive\nalternative.\nMS. BEESON: Well, the less restrictive\nalternative for actually protecting children is the user-\nbased mechanisms, and that again, the -- Congress itself\nfound to be actually more effective at protecting\nchildren.\nJust to refer to the exhibits that were put in\nby the Government, every single one of those sites that\naddress the teaser problem, all of those were blocked by\nall of the major --\nQUESTION: What would Congress do, pass a law\nrequiring parents at their own expense to impose user-\nbased screening?\nMS. BEESON: Your Honor, we certainly believe\nthat the Federal Government could --\nQUESTION: I mean, that's not a solution. That\nis not a solution within the power of Congress.\nMS. BEESON: No, and we don't think it needs to\nbe, because we think, of course, the ultimate decision\nought to be resting on parents, where it always has, to\nmake a decision as to whether they --\nQUESTION: You're saying, in answer to Justice\nStevens, in your capacity as a lawyer, that whatever\nstatute Congress came up with, you would believe in that\ncapacity was unconstitutional. You're not prepared to say\nthat there's any statute that is constitutional. I'm\nasking about what you think, not what I think.\nMS. BEESON: We are not prepared to say that any\nstatute which significantly burdens adult speech is\nconstitutional, and I think that is very consistent with\nthe opinions of this Court, as in the Playboy case and the\nDenver Area case.\nIn sum, I just want to say that the web provides\naccess, as we all know, to more speech by more speakers\nthan any other communications medium in history. COPA\nthreatens to transform this dynamic medium into one that\nis fit only for children. We believe the preliminary\ninjunction should be affirmed.\nQUESTION: Let me ask you a modification to my\nquestion. Do you think it would be within the power of\nCongress to require everyone who is in this area of\nspeech, which is protected as to adults but maybe not as\nto minors, to put a XX on their material that goes onto\nthe web site so that the software could pick up that XX\nmore effectively?\nMS. BEESON: Your Honor, the problem with that\nwould be, of course, without some kind of mechanism that\nthen allowed parents to --\nQUESTION: No, that's right, but then that would\nsimplify the problem of buying -- of setting up software\nthat could screen out this stuff.\nMS. BEESON: I think that it might have some\ncompelled speech concerns, especially, again, where you're\ntalking about a medium where you have these individuals --\njust because it's commercial businesses doesn't mean\nthere's a big -- you know, a lot of employees to make\nthese determinations. We have clients who are single\nindividuals who are working out of their home. I think\nthey're just not going to be able to do that. What\nthey're much more likely to do instead is to self-censor,\nso I'm not sure that that would be a solution.\nWe believe that a much better solution -- and\nCongress agreed with us. The Justice Department itself\nwrote a letter to Congress before this law was passed\nsaying that they think that upholding this statute would\ndivert valuable resources away from the more important\nissues of prosecuting the child pornographers.\nQUESTION: Ms. Beeson, last time we had a\ncolloquy with the Government on this subject, and they\nwere candid to say, we're not trying simply to maximize\nparents' choices. We think Government, qua Government has\na concern for the children, so even if you have parents\nwho don't care at all what their kids see, the Government\nhas an interest in seeing that children -- and your point\nabout the effectiveness of a blocking device doesn't go to\nthat at all. The Government's saying, we have an\nindependent interest, and we can do something.\nMS. BEESON: Yes, I do believe that that issue\ncame up in the Playboy case last term, and the Court, you\nknow, did rule that again voluntary -- we can't assume,\nespecially without a record to the contrary, that parents\nare going to fail to act.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Ms. Beeson.\nMS. BEESON: Thank you.\nQUESTION: Mr. Olson, you have 4 minutes\nremaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nGENERAL OLSON: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nJustice Ginsburg, this Court has specifically\nsaid and held in the Ginsberg case that the Government\ndoes have a responsibility, and this Court has repeatedly\nsaid there's a compelling national interest in addressing\nthat responsibility. It is not just helping the parents.\nIt's an independent, as this Court put it in the Ginsberg\ncase, independent responsibility to do something to\nprevent damage, which everybody agrees is damage to\nchildren.\nWhat we're hearing from the plaintiffs in this\ncase is the same sky is falling defense that everything\npossible is going to be precluded and taken away from\nadults, and that some of the same parties were making in\nthe American Booksellers case, and this Court sent that\nback to Virginia and asked the Virginia court to examine\nwhether all of these publications and materials were going\nto be covered by the statute, and it turned out that none\nof them were, and then the case wended its way back to the\nFourth Circuit, and it resolved itself in these statutes\nthat were used, that Congress uses as an analogy, the\nblinder statute.\nNow, what our opponents say now is that this\nblinder statute applied to the Internet is somehow\nintrusive, expensive, intolerable, burdensome. But when\nyou go into a bookstore to look behind the rack, you have\nto do that in person. Sometimes, if it's a 7-11 or one of\nthese convenience stores, it may be on a camera.\nIn the Internet, you have to identify yourself\nwith a credit card, which many people do anyway. These\nscreens already exist, as Justice Stevens' questions focus\non. It is the teasers that are in front of the screen\nthat Congress was attempting to get at, so in many cases\nthese screens already exist. There's a privacy provision\nbuilt into the statute that prevents the adult\nidentification services from sharing the information as to\nthe identity of the person using it.\nI would submit, or the Government would submit\nit's quite obvious that this is less intrusive. As this\nCourt said in Reno v. ACLU, the system already exists, and\nit's already in use, so what -- and the definitions -- oh,\nand the other point that several of the questions have\nfocused on is if community standards are not permissible\non the Internet, which is what I understand our opponent's\nposition to be, those go out the window with respect to\nobscenity, because those are the same standards that this\nCourt developed.\nNow, what will happen then, as a result of\naffirming the Third Circuit's decision, is that all of the\nobscene material which is now behind the screen will be in\nfront of the screen, and all these children will now not\njust be seeing the teasers, but the effect of the Third\nCircuit decision is that they will be seeing everything\nthat anybody, any of the commercial pornographers want to\nput on the Internet.\nNow, the definition of commercial, that is the\nsame definition. Congress understands what those words\nmean. It made it clear that it was talking about people\nthat are in the business of making a profit as a regular\ntrade or business in dealing with the provision of\nmaterial which is sexually explicit, and damaging to\nminors.\nIt's a definition that already exists, that this\nCourt is quite familiar with. It's in 18 U.S.C. 1466, the\nobscenity statute. The same definition of commercial is\nin that statute that Congress adopted for this statute.\nFinally, with respect to the national standards\npoint, I don't think Congress intended to adopt a national\nstandard. I think what they were trying to do is develop\na standard based upon what this Court said in Hamling, and\nspecifically in Jenkins, which was decided the same day as\nHamling. The jury instructions need not specify what\ncommunity, and so forth. I won't repeat the whole\ndefinition there, that the definition of community\nstandards does not have to be geographically limited.\nCongress suggested that there wasn't going to be\nmuch variation. They didn't -- Congress didn't feel that\nthere would be much variation anyway, and this Court has\nsaid there can be some variations from place to place and\ntime to time --\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, General\nOlson.\nGENERAL OLSON: -- and if you're in that\nbusiness you're taking your chances.\n"
