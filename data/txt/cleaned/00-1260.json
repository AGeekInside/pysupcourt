STEWART\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. STEWART: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nIn May 1998, respondent was convicted of a\nmisdemeanor drug offense in a California court and was\nplaced on 3 years' probation. One term of his probation\nrequired respondent to submit to searches of his person or\nproperty, quote, with or without a search warrant, warrant\nof arrest or reasonable cause by any probation officer or\nlaw enforcement officer. The acknowledgement signed by\nrespondent stated: I have received a copy, read, and\nunderstand the above terms and conditions of probation and\nagree to abide by same.\nThe Supreme Court of California has long held\nthat such an acknowledgement is a voluntary and\nenforceable consent to future searches because, under\nCalifornia law, a defendant may not be compelled to accept\nprobation, but may insist instead on serving the term of\nconfinement that is authorized by law.\nLess than a week after respondent was placed on\nprobation, State police came to suspect that he was\ninvolved in an act of vandalism against electric and\ntelecommunications facilities that caused approximately\n$1.5 million in damage. Relying on the search condition,\npolice searched respondent's residence and found evidence\nimplicating him in the crime.\nRespondent was subsequently indicted in Federal\ncourt on charges of conspiracy to commit arson and being a\nfelon in possession of ammunition.\nQUESTION: Now, Mr. -- may I ask this question?\nThe actual search was conducted by State officers, as I\nunderstand it.\nMR. STEWART: That's correct.\nQUESTION: Do you think the consent would have\napplied equally to Federal officers?\nMR. STEWART: It would have. By its terms, it\nsaid any probation officer or law enforcement officer.\nI'm not aware of any cases in the California system in\nwhich the search condition has actually been invoked by a\nFederal officer, but I think it would apply by its terms\nto such searches.\nQUESTION: What about a law enforcement officer\nfrom Nevada?\nMR. STEWART: I -- I think that's correct. It's\nunlikely that such a search would occur because presumably\none of the terms of probation would be that the -- the\nrespondent would be required to remain within the State of\nCalifornia, and it's -- it's unlikely that he would be\nsearched in California by Nevada officers. But I think if\n-- if such an unlikely scenario unfolded --\nQUESTION: Well, it could be on the basis of a\npreexisting criminal situation. I mean, he might have\ncommitted a crime in Nevada 2 years ago.\nMR. STEWART: That's correct. It could have\nhappened.\nQUESTION: But what do you think? Would it\napply to a Nevada officer as well, do you think?\nMR. STEWART: I think it would. The consent\nwould apply by its terms because it refers, without\nqualification, to any law enforcement officer.\nQUESTION: Well, I assume that -- doesn't that\nreasonably mean a law enforcement officer who has\nauthority?\nMR. STEWART: I mean, there might be some\nindependent basis for objecting to the presence of the --\nthe officer from outside the State, but I -- I don't think\nthat the consent would fail to extend to --\nQUESTION: Well, not -- I mean, if you have\nconsent, I assume it could be, you know, a law enforcement\nofficer from Afghanistan.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. STEWART: Well, the -- the Supreme Court --\nQUESTION: Don't you think the consent is\nreasonably understood to be limited to a law enforcement\nofficer who has authority under the applicable law of the\njurisdiction?\nMR. STEWART: I think the -- I think that may be\nright --\nQUESTION: Which would include a Federal\nofficer --\nMR. STEWART: And it might include --\nQUESTION: -- but not -- not an Afghan officer.\nMR. STEWART: Well, it might -- it might include\na Nevada officer, and if -- if under the circumstances\nJustice Stevens posits, there were actually authority for\na Nevada officer to -- to be on the premises.\nIn any event --\nQUESTION: Well, but isn't -- doesn't your\nargument have an even narrower consequence? Because part\nof your argument, which I -- I want to go into, rests upon\nthe fact that if he didn't consent, the State could --\ncould commit him, could put him -- put him in the house of\ncorrection. And you're saying, well, a person, in effect,\ncan consent to bargain his way out of that more -- more\nserious imposition, but that suggests that the only thing\nthat he's freely consenting to is the avoidance of\nsomething that the State could do to him. The Federal\nGovernment couldn't do it to him. Nevada couldn't to him,\nand Afghanistan couldn't do it to him. So, doesn't --\ndoesn't that suggest that the only thing that he's\nconsenting to is what he has to consent to, and that is to\nlet California people search him so he doesn't have to go\nbehind bars now?\nMR. STEWART: Well, the Supreme Court of\nCalifornia has construed the consent to -- not to apply to\nsearches that are conducted for purposes of harassment or\nin an unreasonable manner.\nQUESTION: Well, but what about my -- what about\nmy question? If -- if there is significance in the -- in\nyour argument, and I take it there is. If there is\nsignificance in the fact that California can put him\nbehind bars if he doesn't agree, doesn't it follow that\nhis consent is likewise limited, i.e., limited to agreeing\nto let officers of the State that could put him behind\nbars search him?\nMR. STEWART: No. I don't -- I don't think that\nfollows. That is, the reason that California insists in\nmany cases upon a waiver of Fourth Amendment rights as a\ncondition of release on probation is that it wants to\nensure that there will be no unnecessary barriers to\nmonitoring the individual's compliance with the terms of\nhis probation.\nQUESTION: That is to say monitoring by\nCalifornia.\nMR. STEWART: Well, it wouldn't -- it would\nextend beyond monitoring by California, because one of the\nterms of probation is that the individual avoid violations\nof any criminal law. That is, the individual would be in\nviolation of his probation if he violated --\nQUESTION: Well, sure, I -- I understand that,\nbut it's California that monitors California probationers,\nisn't it? It's not -- it's not Federal probation officers\nand it's not Nevada probation officers.\nMR. STEWART: Certainly California has the\nprimary interest in ensuring that California probationers\ncomply with the terms of their probation, but -- but it\nwould be a violation of the California probation for\nrespondent or another probationer to violate Federal law.\nQUESTION: Oh, I -- I realize that, but I'm just\nsaying -- well, let me -- let me put the question to you\nblankly. What is the significance for your argument in\nthe fact that California could commit him? Is -- is --\nare you implicitly making the argument that because\nCalifornia could commit him, California could do something\nlesser than committing him; i.e., it could let him out\nsubject to a limitation on Fourth Amendment rights? Is --\nis that your argument?\nMR. STEWART: We're not making that argument all\nthe way because there would be some possible --\nQUESTION: Because if you made that argument all\nthe way there would be no significance in the -- in the\nagreement, would there?\nMR. STEWART: To take an example of --\nQUESTION: Would -- would there? If that were\nyour argument, we would need an agreement.\nMR. STEWART: I think that's right.\nQUESTION: Okay, so that's not your argument.\nMR. STEWART: And to take an --\nQUESTION: What then is the significance of the\npower of California to commit him?\nMR. STEWART: I think the significance is that\nthis is -- that the defining characteristic of\nprobationers is that they have recently been convicted of\ncriminal offenses, and the premise of the institution of\nprobation, as the Court said in Griffin, is that a\nprobationer is more likely than the average citizen to\nviolate the law. And one possible way of dealing,\nobviously, with people who've recently been convicted of\ncrimes is to incarcerate them to minimize the -- the\nlikelihood that they will commit future criminal offenses.\nQUESTION: All right. Doesn't it boil down then\nto saying that the significance of the conviction is\nsimply that it presents the occasion for this agreement\nand that it's the agreement that is really what is\nsignificant here?\nMR. STEWART: I mean, it --\nQUESTION: Everything stands or falls on the\nfact that there's an agreement. Isn't that what your\nposition boils down to?\nMR. STEWART: Well, everything stands or falls\non the fact that there is a conviction. That is, it -- we\nthink it would be the case that even if --\nQUESTION: Well, if there were no conviction,\nthere would be no occasion for the agreement. They\nwouldn't be there. They wouldn't be standing in court.\nBut once there is a conviction and the occasion\nhas presented itself, I don't see what in your argument\ngoes beyond the significance of the agreement itself.\nMR. STEWART: We would say that even if there\nhad been no agreement -- that is, even if it were the case\nunder California law, as it is under Federal law, that an\nindividual who has no legal right to -- that an individual\nhas no legal right to refuse probation, even if probation\nwere a sentence that were imposed upon the defendant\nwithout his consent -- we -- we would still argue that the\nsearch condition is a reasonable term of probation.\nQUESTION: Okay. But in that case, you would be\nsaying that because California had power to deal with him\nat that point, it had power, in effect, to limit his\nFourth Amendment rights.\nMR. STEWART: Let me give an example of --\nQUESTION: No, but isn't -- isn't that what\nyou're saying?\nMR. STEWART: That is almost what I'm saying,\nbut let -- let me give an --\nQUESTION: But there's no -- I mean, there's no\ngeneral rule across the board that I know of that because\nsomeone has been convicted, the State, in effect, can --\ncan limit bill of rights entitlements as a general rule.\nMR. STEWART: Let me give an example of why\nit's --\nQUESTION: Is -- am I right on that?\nMR. STEWART: I think that's right, and let me\ngive an example of why we're not going quite all the way\nand why we think you're correct.\nFor instance, this Court held in Bell v.\nWolfish, which is not cited in our brief, but it's in 441\nU.S., that prison officials may preclude inmates from\nreceiving hard cover books from persons other than\nbooksellers or bookstores. And the rationale for that\nrestriction was that hard cover books could be used to\nsmuggle contraband into the institution. We think it's\nvery unlikely that the State could impose a similar\nrestriction on probationers because once an individual is\nallowed to circulate in the community, the likelihood that\nhis receipt of hard cover books will add a meaningful\nincrement of danger that he will possess contraband would\nbe pretty insignificant.\nQUESTION: Right. It's the specific\nrelationship between the State and the prisoner at that\ntime that governs, in effect, what the State can do to --\nto limit rights.\nMR. STEWART: That's correct.\nQUESTION: So, the same rule would apply in the\nState as -- as probationary supervisor vis-a-vis\nprobationer. Right?\nMR. STEWART: That -- that is correct. Our --\nQUESTION: And doesn't it follow from that then\nthat the State's right to limit is itself limited by the\nState's interest in supervising probation, as distinct\nfrom the State's interest as a general enforcer of the\ncriminal law?\nMR. STEWART: I think it's correct that the\nState has an interest. I wouldn't quite put it as the\nState has an interest in supervising probation. The State\nhas an interest in seeing to it that adequate measures are\ntaken to ensure that a probationer doesn't violate the\nterms of his conditional release.\nAnd if -- if one of the dangers that the State\nfears, when a probationer is released into the community,\nis that he may commit Federal crimes as -- in addition to\nState crimes, it may reasonably choose to subject him, in\neffect, to increased monitoring by Federal officials by\nsaying that he will have no right to demand the judicial\nwarrant even as to searches by -- by those officials. So,\nwe think that the -- a term of release like that is\nreasonably related to the purposes and conditions --\nQUESTION: Okay. Does that -- does that mean\nthen, at this point in the argument, that you're relying\non the State's power as -- as the -- as the State vis-a-\nvis a convict for your position rather than the convict's\nagreement for your position?\nMR. STEWART: We -- we are relying on both. We\nare saying --\nQUESTION: But what does it -- I mean, if -- if\nyour last argument is sound, what does the agreement add?\nMR. STEWART: I mean, the agreement provides an\nadditional check, an additional means of assurance that\nthe conditions of probation are not unduly onerous. The\nfact --\nQUESTION: Isn't the -- isn't the agreement, if\nyou're going to talk about it in realistic terms, simply\nnotice? This is not something that the prisoner can\nnegotiate. This is a package deal. This is what\nprobation is. If you're on probation, these are the\nconditions. So, doesn't that -- that agreement -- the\nword agreement seems to me not quite right to describe a\nsituation where the defendant really has no choice. This\nis probation. This is the package that comes with\nprobation and that's it.\nMR. STEWART: We would --\nQUESTION: Well, doesn't the prisoner have the\npower to say, no, I don't want probation? Usually that\nextends much longer than a jail term. I'd rather go to\njail. I know when I used to sentence criminal defendants,\nmany times they'd make that choice. They'd say I'd rather\ntake a short jail sentence and get the government out of\nmy business than to accept a longer probation term on\nthese conditions. Don't they make a choice sometimes?\nMR. STEWART: It happens rarely but it does\nhappen. And it is an agreement. That is, the individual\nadmittedly is faced with two options --\nQUESTION: All right. What about the person for\nwhom there is no jail term? And I think you conceded\nthere is a category where probation is the only\npunishment.\nMR. STEWART: No. Probation may be the only\npunishment that is actually imposed in a particular case,\nbut we -- we certainly don't concede in this case that the\nindividual had no choice. The individual could have\ninsisted upon --\nQUESTION: But you're -- you're asking for a\nrule across the board. And so, I'm asking you, what about\nthe category of case for which the prescribed punishment\nis probation? Period.\nMR. STEWART: It's -- you're -- you're correct.\nIn the Federal system, for instance, where an individual\ndoesn't have the choice to refuse probation, it may be\nthat a condition of this sort would still be upheld. We\nwould argue that it would, but it could not be on a\nconsent theory. We would agree with you on that.\nAnd to return to Justice O'Connor's point --\nQUESTION: Was this a case where the defendant\nhad to be placed on probation? Was there not a jail term\nthat could have been imposed here?\nMR. STEWART: There -- there was a jail term.\nThe statute provided for up to a year in prison or up to 3\nyears' probation, and the individual was placed on\nprobation for a period of 3 years.\nAnd this Court has often recognized, in the\ncontext of plea bargaining --\nQUESTION: Can I just -- excuse me. Just one --\nis it not true, though, that the Wisconsin -- the -- the\n-- California could have insisted on the 3-year probation?\nMR. STEWART: Yes.\nQUESTION: Okay.\nMR. STEWART: I'm sorry. No, it couldn't have\ninsisted on the 3-year probation. That is, if the -- if\nthe --\nQUESTION: Is -- is that possible in California\nthat --\nMR. STEWART: No.\nQUESTION: -- a person could be placed on\nprobation without a willingness to be placed on probation?\nIs there no choice given to the person convicted?\nMR. STEWART: No. No. In California, the\nindividual could insist on imprisonment. He couldn't\ninsist on probation. That is, if the judge had wanted to\nsentence him to prison, he couldn't have said, no, I'll\ntake the 3-year probationary term instead. But he could\ninsist on imprisonment and could refuse to be placed on\nprobation.\nAnd as the Court has often recognized in the\nplea bargaining context, often defendants will plead\nguilty because they're faced with unattractive options.\nQUESTION: The relevance of this is -- escapes\nme slightly because I -- I wonder what -- I mean, you may\nhave plenty of power to impose the condition you want.\nThat's a different issue. But as far as consenting is\nconcerned, don't people get searched in prison?\nMR. STEWART: Yes.\nQUESTION: Okay. And don't they get searched\nout of prison under this?\nMR. STEWART: Yes.\nQUESTION: Then what's his choice in respect to\nsearch?\nMR. STEWART: Well, his choice -- I mean, he --\nthe likelihood is that as a practical matter, he will have\nmore privacy when on probation than -- than when he is in\n-- than if he were in prison. But you're right. As a\nlegal matter, he is subject to searches without any\nrequirement of individualized --\nQUESTION: To say he consents to search without\nhis consent is like saying I consent to being a human\nbeing.\nMR. STEWART: No. I mean, to take -- to take\nthe example of -- of plea bargaining, if an individual\npleads guilty to a criminal offense --\nQUESTION: Yes, I grant you he concedes -- he\ncan choose whether to be in prison or out of prison.\nMR. STEWART: But in the --\nQUESTION: He can't choose whether to be\nsearched or not be searched.\nMR. STEWART: That's correct. But in the plea\nbargaining context, if an individual pleads guilty to an\noffense because his understanding is he'll be sentenced to\n10 years in prison and he does it because he thinks that\nif he goes to trial, he'll be sentenced to 20 years in\nprison, I mean, you could say in a sense that either way\nhe's going to be placed in prison, so what's the choice?\nBut the Court has recognized that to be a meaningful\nchoice. The fact that the options are unattractive\ndoesn't negate the volitional element.\nQUESTION: If he's in prison, can the police\nthen go to his premises? Suppose he had been put in jail\nand not let out because they suspected that he had done\nsomething much more serious. And then the law enforcement\nofficer goes into his house, no warrant, finds all the\nsame damning material. Could -- could that be done\nwithout a warrant when the man is not there?\nMR. STEWART: No. No, unless some other\nexception to the warrant requirement applied.\nQUESTION: So, if he were in jail, that's the\nway he would have of protecting his house against entry\nwithout a warrant.\nMR. STEWART: I mean -- and, you know, to look\nat it that way, you could say that probation is\ndisadvantageous because, as Justice O'Connor pointed out,\nit may extend for a longer period of time. The point here\nis not that the individual, in choosing probation, doesn't\ngive up anything that he might have had had he chosen\nprison. The point is that each of the options has both\nattractive and unattractive features and the individual\nhas the choice --\nQUESTION: Mr. Stewart, can I ask you this\nquestion? I really want to understand the Government's\nposition. It seems to me -- maybe they don't do it. I\nthought they did, but a State could have a -- a law that\nsays if you violate this statute, your punishment shall be\n60 days in jail and a year of probation. They could do\nthat, and that's the only -- only alternative so that\nthere is no element of consent whatsoever on the part of\nthe defendant, but the statute provides you have to\nsubject to it. And would your argument apply equally to\nthat case and to this case?\nMR. STEWART: No, it would not. That is, we --\nwe would still take the position that such a term was\nreasonable, but it would be a pure special needs case. We\nwould not -- if the individual had no choice but to be\nplaced on probation, there would not be a consent theory\navailable to us.\nQUESTION: If we follow your suggested line of\ndecision and say that this was a consented-to search, can\nwe write the opinion without citing Griffin?\nMR. STEWART: I -- I assume that you would cite\nGriffin, but I don't think that there is anything in our\nposition that is inconsistent with Griffin. That is --\nQUESTION: We don't need Griffin under your\nview.\nMR. STEWART: That's correct. We -- I think the\npart of Griffin that is particularly helpful to us is the\nfirst part of Griffin that explained why supervision and\nmonitoring of probationers is a State interest distinct\nfrom enforcement of the criminal law.\nQUESTION: But Griffin was not a consent case.\nMR. STEWART: That's correct. There was no\nallegation in Griffin that the individual had a right to\nrefuse probation. And I think even in the circumstances\npresented in Griffin where the individual was placed on\nprobation without his choice, the Court was careful not to\nsuggest that the features of the constitutional -- the\nfeatures of the Wisconsin scheme were necessarily\nconstitutional prerequisites to a valid process. In\nparticular, in footnote 2 of the Griffin opinion, the\nCourt noted that the test for restrictions within the\nprison is whether they are reasonably related to a\nlegitimate penological objective.\nQUESTION: Do we say that the consent has to be\nfor a search that is substantially related to the purposes\nof the probation; i.e., the hypothetical probation for 3\nyears but you give up your Fourth Amendment rights for\nlife?\nMR. STEWART: I mean, I think -- yes, I think we\nwould say that for the -- for the consent to be valid, the\nindividual's waiver of rights needs to bear some\nreasonable relationship to the fact that he's on\nprobation. For instance, we've said in our brief that the\nState presumably could not condition release on probation\non an individual's agreement to refrain from criticizing\nthe Government or to refrain from engaging in religious\nworship.\nQUESTION: Once you --\nQUESTION: Is that an unconstitutional\nconditions analysis?\nMR. STEWART: I think that's correct, that the\n-- the Court has said that ordinarily even when the\nGovernment has discretion to grant or withhold a benefit\nentirely, it may not grant it on a relinquishment of\nconstitutional rights that bears no reasonable\nrelationship to the program at issue. So, because a\nprobationer's criticism of the Government would impair no\nlegitimate Government interests, would cause no damage\ndistinct from any other individual's criticism of the\nGovernment, the strong inference would be that a State\nthat imposed that condition was simply trying to stifle\ndissent and was attempting to use the probation condition\nas a hook.\nQUESTION: Once you say that, I don't see what\nis to be gained by drawing the -- the big distinction that\nyou attempt to draw between consent and nonconsent. Once\nyou've -- once you've made that -- that line that it has\nto be related to the Government's not just penological\ninterest, because it's certainly a punishment not to be\nable to criticize the Government -- I guess one of the\npunishments of being in prison, for example, is -- is the\ninability to have sexual relationships with -- with your\nspouse. But I -- I assume you would say that the\nGovernment could not sentence you to 5 years in prison\nplus another 5 years for no sexual relationships with your\nspouse. Right?\nMR. STEWART: Right.\nQUESTION: So, somehow the -- the -- it can't be\na punishment. What is attached after the prison term has\nto be related to assuring the safety of the society from\nthe individual, which this search condition would. But\nonce you say that it has to be connected that way, what do\nyou gain by saying there has to be consent?\nMR. STEWART: Well, I think the consent --\nQUESTION: I mean, consent or no consent, if\nit's -- if it's connected up in that way, why isn't it\nvalid?\nMR. STEWART: I mean, we have -- we have said --\nI mean, I've said today that we would be here defending\nthe condition even if it were imposed on a defendant who\nhad no option to refuse probation. So, we would agree\nthat the -- the existence of consent is not in our view\noutcome determinative. However, the -- the fact that the\nindividual has the choice whether to accept probation or\nto insist on incarceration does provide an additional\ncheck, an additional assurance that the condition is not\nunduly onerous.\nQUESTION: The constitutional rights he can give\nup are related to the purpose of the enforcement. So,\ncould you require him to give up his Miranda rights?\nAnd my next question would be, could you require\nhim to give up his right to be free from coerced\nconfession by brutal torture?\nMR. STEWART: No. I mean, there would be --\nthere would be no interest --\nQUESTION: Well, you get -- you get information\nout of people sometimes by applying the screw. I mean,\nthere's a Government interest there and I don't -- what\nis --\nMR. STEWART: I don't -- I don't think the --\nthe legitimacy of using those particular methods to\nattempt to solve as yet unanticipated crimes would vary\ndepending on whether the individual is a probationer or\nnot.\nQUESTION: Can you consent to torture? Can you\nconsent to the elimination of your Miranda rights?\nWouldn't it -- wouldn't it suffice for your case to say\nthat the State can take away any of the constitutional\nrights related to the -- the probationary nature of the --\nof -- of the punishment? Any of those rights that a\nperson can waive?\nMR. STEWART: I think that's probably at least,\nif not exactly, the --\nQUESTION: I don't think you can waive your\nrights to torture.\nQUESTION: But you can certainly waive your\nright to Miranda, and you could waive your right to save\nquestioning for 3 days in a -- in a cell. Everything\nisn't torture.\nMR. STEWART: Well, you can -- you can waive the\nrights that are explained to you in the -- in the Miranda\ncolloquy. That's a different thing from saying you can\nwaive your right to be informed of -- of those rights.\nAnd to further elucidate what to us is the\nsignificance of consent, if the terms of probation under\nCalifornia law were much more severe -- for instance, if\nthe probationary period were 15 years rather than 3 or if\none of the conditions of probation was that an individual\nhad video cameras mounted in his residence so he could be\nobserved at all times -- at a certain point, you'd get to\na situation where lots of probationers would decide that\nincarceration is better than this.\nQUESTION: May I ask another question? To what\nextent is the waiver of Fourth Amendment rights total in\nyour view? Could he, for example -- could you say he's\nwaived his right to every 6-hour body cavity searches, for\nexample, something very extreme and intrusive searches?\nMR. STEWART: I mean, he -- he doesn't under\nCalifornia law. That is, the California Supreme Court has\ninterpreted the consent condition as not applying to\nsearches conducted in an arbitrary or unreasonable manner\nor for purposes of harassment. And there is a statute in\nthe California penal code governing the situations under\nwhich strip searches may be conducted.\nQUESTION: Do you think that statute is\nconstitutionally compelled?\nMR. STEWART: I mean, there -- there may be rare\nsituations in which an individual's consent -- blanket\nconsent to searches could be enforced with --\nQUESTION: In other words, he can waive his\nright to be free from unreasonable searches, but not from\nvery unreasonable searches.\nMR. STEWART: I mean, certainly the -- the type\nof -- there -- there would have to be some justification\nfor performing the search based on the fact that he was a\nprobationer, but again --\nQUESTION: I'll look at the laws. I had thought\nthat under California law, for a second drug offense or a\nthird drug offense, you can get lifetime probation. So,\nwould you say -- let's say for a second offense, assuming\nyou could have probation for 20 years or a lifetime, the\nFourth Amendment right could be surrendered for that long?\nMR. STEWART: I mean, I think if it were for a\nthird offense, I think yes. I think the State could\nlegitimately make the judgment that a person who has three\ntimes been convicted of drug offenses was, for the rest of\nhis life, meaningfully more likely to violate the criminal\nlaw than the average citizen.\nIf you talked about another type of extreme\nexample -- for instance, upon conviction for a traffic\nviolation, you'll be placed on lifetime probation under\nwhich you can be searched at any time -- I think it would\nbe probably be irrational for the State to say simply\nbecause you were convicted of a traffic violation, we will\nregard you 20 years down the road as being more likely\nthan the average citizen to violate the law.\nBut the -- the point I was making about the --\nthe potential terms of probation becoming more onerous, if\nwe got to a situation where because the conditions of\nprobation were especially harsh, large numbers of\nprobationers decided that incarceration is better than\nthis, then the -- an individual defendant's right to\nchoose between the two alternatives would have obvious\nsignificance. It would provide an obvious degree of -- of\ncomfort that the -- that what was being placed upon him,\nif he chose probation, was not unconstitutionally onerous.\nQUESTION: How long back does the consent or the\nnotice apply? Suppose the law enforcement officer is\ninvestigating a crime that occurred before the defendant\nwas apprehended on the charge for which the sentence is\nprobation. So, here the last act of vandalism occurred\nafter the probation sentence. Suppose all the vandalism\nacts had occurred before he was picked up for drug\npossession.\nMR. STEWART: I think the consent would apply,\nby its terms, to that situation, and it would be\nconstitutional.\nQUESTION: And then you couldn't have the\npurpose, well, we want to see that from the day he's put\non probation, he's not living a life of crime. This would\nhave been before. So, it would be hard to connect it with\na probation purpose.\nMR. STEWART: I agree that the link between the\nsearch that you describe and the -- the monitoring of\ncompliance with the conditions of probation would be more\ntenuous. In this case, as you point out, the -- the\nsearch was intended to and did produce evidence of a crime\nthat was committed after the individual was placed on\nprobation.\nIf I may, I'd like to reserve the remainder of\nmy time.\nQUESTION: Very well, Mr. Stewart.\nMs. Fox, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF HILARY A. FOX\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMS. FOX: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please\nthe Court:\nRespondent's argument has two major points.\nFirst, on the facts of this case, the Government has\nfailed to establish that there was an effective consent to\nsearch. But second, even if the Government could\nestablish consent, California's blanket search condition,\nwhich purports to permit searches at any time of the day\nor night, by any law enforcement officer, for any reason\nor no reason, is unenforceable.\nWith regard to the first issue, the basis for\nthe consent argument here is a one-page probation order.\nMr. Knights' signature appears on the order beneath a two-\nline advisement of rights. The -- the first line advises\nhim that, should he satisfactorily complete probation, he\nmay ask to have his conviction set aside, and the second\nsentence confirms that he has received, read, and\nunderstood the terms and conditions of probation and\nagrees to abide by same. Beneath that is a line for\ndefendant's signature, acknowledgement of receipt.\nAs Justice Ginsburg suggested earlier, this is a\nnotice provision. This is not an effective consent.\nMoreover --\nQUESTION: Well, does it -- does it say? Does\nit use the term consent?\nMS. FOX: No, Your Honor, I don't believe it\ndoes.\nQUESTION: Is it somewhere in the record?\nMS. FOX: Yes. It's at page 50 of the joint\nappendix, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Thank you.\nQUESTION: I don't even think he agrees to them.\nHe agrees to abide by them. He agrees to abide by the\nconditions.\nMS. FOX: Exactly, agrees to abide by same,\nmeaning the conditions.\nQUESTION: Well, that's certainly an agreement.\nWhether you'd call it consent or not, it's an agreement.\nMS. FOX: It does say agree, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Well, I'm not saying it just says\nthat. If he signs it, it is an agreement, is it not?\nMS. FOX: Well, Your Honor, I'm -- I'm not sure\nthat's an accurate way to characterize it, in that with\nthis probation order, we don't know when or where Mr.\nKnights signed it. There's no evidence.\nQUESTION: Well, does it make a difference?\nMS. FOX: Well, I think, Your Honor, it does in\nterms of was this an order of the court -- it's called a\nprobation order -- that was imposed on him.\nQUESTION: But -- but he -- he has signed his\nname saying he agrees to abide by it. Isn't that the\ncase?\nMS. FOX: That's correct, Your Honor. That's\nwhy I was going to refer then to the Bumper case, which I\nthink is very instructive as to whether this type of\nagreement is an enforceable consent. In Bumper v. North\nCarolina, of course, Mrs. Bumper did agree to -- consent\nto a search of her house, but that's because she thought\nthat the searching officers had lawful authority to search\nher house. So, the Court concluded that her consent under\nthose circumstances was nothing more than acquiescence to\na show of lawful authority.\nIn this case --\nQUESTION: When, in fact, the lawful -- the\nauthority was not lawful.\nMS. FOX: Exactly. And our argument here, Your\nHonor, is that the probation order with form conditions,\none box checked being a search condition, sets forth a\nblanket search condition that is not constitutional and\nnot enforceable, but that Mr. Knights, in agreeing to it,\nwould have had no way of knowing --\nQUESTION: Well, in Bumpers, the premise for\nlawful authority was established without reference to the\nargument at hand. Here you're assuming -- you're assuming\nthe premise.\nMS. FOX: That's correct, Your Honor. In fact,\nit's my second point.\nQUESTION: So that Bumpers doesn't work.\nMS. FOX: Well, I -- I think it does if you --\nof course, you then accept the second point which is was\nthis blanket search authority constitutional. My position\nis that under Griffin, clearly it's not. An easy way to\nunderstand that is that this condition is not limited by\nits terms to probationary searches in that it --\nQUESTION: Well, but Griffin is a special needs\ncase and you might argue that this is -- has -- that if we\nhave a special needs dichotomy, we have to expand somewhat\nthe holding of -- of Griffin. But Griffin, I don't think,\ndiscussed consent. As I understand it, it as not a\nconsent case. Here it's a consent case.\nMS. FOX: Yes, Your Honor. What -- what the\nGovernment, I believe, conceded is that even if they don't\nrely on Griffin, they do have to -- have to acknowledge\nsome or find some rational relationship between the\ncondition and the needs of the probation. And here,\nCalifornia in the Supreme Court has construed this\ncondition in the Woods case, which I cited in my brief, to\nauthorize searches targeted at third parties who are not\non probation.\nQUESTION: We wouldn't have to -- we wouldn't\nhave to accept that, would we?\nMS. FOX: Well, I believe, Your Honor, under\nGriffin the Court would look to --\nQUESTION: I mean, can't we say that's totally\nwrong or say that this has nothing to do with this case?\nWhat about -- what about leaving that out?\nMS. FOX: You could, Your Honor. I was only\ngoing to say that -- that we usually look to California\nlaw to fix the meaning of the --\nQUESTION: No, no. That's the meaning. Fine,\nokay. Does this involve such a search?\nMS. FOX: No, it doesn't.\nQUESTION: Okay. So, we could say, applied to\nsuch a search, it's unconstitutional. What about this\ncase?\nMS. FOX: In this case --\nQUESTION: And suppose I say you're right about\nconsent. Consent has nothing to do with it, that this is\na punishment. One of the objectives of punishment is what\nused to be called incapacitation, what's now called\nspecific deterrence. Many think that's the main purpose\nof punishment, to incapacitate this person. We\nincapacitate him in prison and we do it, in part, by\nsearching him randomly. What about a halfway house? What\nabout home confinement? What about probation where he is\nat home? Why would we not have the same kind of\nincapacitation there that we have in prison, indeed, a\nless severe form?\nMS. FOX: Well, Your Honor, the -- Your Honor's\nargument suggests somewhat the greater versus the\nlesser --\nQUESTION: No, it doesn't.\nMS. FOX: -- argument that was raised earlier.\nQUESTION: Nothing to do with greater versus\nlesser. I'll take greater/greater.\nWhen people are in prison, they are\nincapacitated from committing further crime. That's the\npurpose of punishment, a major purpose. So, why can't a\nState say, I am going to punish you for, in part, the same\npurpose, to incapacitate you while you are being punished,\nand I will do the same thing we do in prison in respect to\nthat? What we do in respect to that in prison is we\nsearch you randomly. When you are in the halfway house,\nyou will be searched randomly. When you are confined to\nyour house, you will be searched randomly. When you are\non probation, you will be searched randomly.\nNow, my question is, why in each of those\ninstances can the State not do the same thing?\nMS. FOX: Because, Your Honor, the rationale for\nthe limitation of prisoners' Fourth Amendment rights --\nand they would apply also to individuals at halfway houses\n-- is not that we take away rights as a punishment.\nRather, what the Court has held is that recognition of a\nprivacy right in a cell is incompatible with the unique\nneeds --\nQUESTION: I -- I thought -- then you're saying\nwe should -- if I were to tell you in my experience, which\nis somewhat in this area -- I've had experience -- that\none of the purposes of punishment is incapacitation, and\nyou're saying that we couldn't have a punishment that\nwould be designed to do that by searching -- by searching\npeople's cells randomly to be sure that they're not\ncommitting crimes in -- in a prison in order to make sure\n-- I mean, I -- I had thought -- I'm not positive, but I\nhad thought that that was an important purpose.\nMS. FOX: Yes, it is a purpose of punishment,\nYour Honor.\nWhat I'm, I think, relying on in part is that in\nGriffin this Court has previously held that probationers\ndo have Fourth Amendment rights, and that a probationer's\nhome, like anyone else's, is protected by the Fourth\nAmendment.\nQUESTION: I'm not sure the Government has even\nargued what Justice Breyer is suggesting, namely that I --\nit follows from what he's suggesting that you could have\n-- you could sentence somebody to nothing but the\nincapacitation of forfeiting their Fourth Amendment\nrights. That is, I sentence to you 10 years of, you know,\nwarrantless searches and seizures.\nQUESTION: That actually isn't my question.\nQUESTION: Well --\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: My question is designed to show you\n-- to suggest that there is a purpose in searches that is\nrelated to a basic aim of punishment.\nMS. FOX: Certainly, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: And so my -- my point is to suggest\nto you to ask -- answer me as to why that same purpose\ndoesn't apply when, in fact, the person is on probation.\nI may have overstated the case. I obviously misled\nJustice Scalia.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: And so, I will confine, not overstate\nso that you can answer.\nMS. FOX: Your Honor, my answer would be that\nany sentence imposed must be imposed within constitutional\nlimitations, and in this case, I think Griffin is an\nessential case because Griffin helps us see what are the\nconstitutional limitations on probationers' Fourth\nAmendment rights. Obviously, the Fourth Amendment would\ndictate that police searches have -- be based upon a\nwarrant, issued upon probable cause, and Griffin, like TLO\nagainst New Jersey, and the other special needs cases\nissued since, recognized that there is a limited class of\ncases in which special needs, beyond the normal needs of\ngeneral law enforcement, make the warrant and probable\ncause requirements impractical. And what I would say is\nthat for a general law enforcement search, the Fourth\nAmendment tells us that a warrant and probable cause are\nnot impractical by definition.\nSo, what we have in the probation context is a\nspecial need of probation supervision, a dual need that --\nthat includes both the monitoring and protection of the\ncommunity, which is the Government's main focus, but in\naddition, rehabilitation. And I submit to you that if it\nwere only that single focus of protecting the community,\nit would not be a special need beyond the general needs of\nlaw enforcement.\nQUESTION: Are you saying, in effect, yes,\nJustice Breyer, you -- the Government could have a -- a\nregime of probation in which they subject you to random\nsearches, but what the Government cannot do is have a\nregime of probation in which you are subjected to\nnonrandom searches, searches conducted not in supervision\nof probationers, but searches conducted in the\ninvestigation of specific crimes, and in the later case,\nthe -- the Government ought to follow normal Fourth\nAmendment standards? Is that, in effect, your answer?\nMS. FOX: Well, no, not quite, Your Honor,\nbecause I don't believe that the Court should or would\ndispense with the reasonable suspicion requirement in this\nsituation. There are, of course, very cases --\nQUESTION: Okay, add that to his hypo: random\nsearches with reasonable suspicion. You would then say,\nsure, you can have a regime like that. But this is not a\ncase that involves the -- the exercise of that kind of\npower because in this case, you weren't having random\nsearches for probation supervision based on -- on\nreasonable suspicion. You were having a full-blown law\nenforcement kind of search, and you should have gotten a\nFourth Amendment warrant. Is that --\nMS. FOX: I believe that's -- that is correct.\nQUESTION: Good because that's exactly where I\nam. That's better -- that's exactly where I am. But then\nif that's so, how do you distinguish this particular case?\nQUESTION: Yes. Why wasn't there reasonable\nsuspicion?\nMS. FOX: You may have gotten ahead of me.\n(Laughter.)\nMS. FOX: The -- first, the district court found\nreasonable suspicion and we disputed that, but that's the\ndistrict court's factual finding. That alone, at least\nunder Griffin, is not enough to make it a valid special\nneeds search. This was a police investigatory search as\npart of a 2-year investigation conducted without a\nwarrant, without probable cause.\nSo, for -- for it to be a proper probationary\nsearch under Griffin, we believe it would have to satisfy\nother requirements. First, it would have to be, Griffin\nsuggests, done at the direction of or with the advice of a\nprobation officer to show that the search was, in fact,\nsomehow related to the programmatic purpose of probation\nsupervision. And --\nQUESTION: Well, that -- that's part of my\nproblem with your argument. Why isn't it part of the\nprogrammatic purpose of probation to ensure that, A, he\ndoesn't use drugs, and B, he doesn't violate other laws?\nMS. FOX: For this reason, Your Honor. In\nGriffin, when it talked about the importance of deterrence\nand -- and searches to ensure that the probationer is\ncompliant, the Court undertook a balancing of the degree\nof intrusion and the importance of the need. And central\nto the first factor, the degree of intrusion, was that the\nsearch was only being performed by a probation officer.\nThe balancing turned out to be constitutional because it\nwas not a police officer conducting a police search.\nQUESTION: Well, Griffin upheld a search by a\nprobation officer. I really don't think it answered all\nthese questions. I don't think it answered this question.\nAnd it is a concern to me that the whole thrust\nof releasing someone on probation after a conviction of a\nserious crime is to try to prevent that person from\ncommitting other crimes, to try to encourage the person to\nlead a law-abiding life for a sufficient period of time\nthat he can be totally released at the end of the day with\nsafety to the public. And so, this is terribly important\nthat you provide a deterrent to people not to commit\nfurther crimes, and that is exactly what this probation\nterm is all about. Why isn't that eminently reasonable?\nMS. FOX: Your Honor, three reasons. The first\nis --\nQUESTION: And this very case, this person was\nfound to have all kinds of indications of having been\nplanning and perhaps having committed a number of very\nserious offenses while on probation.\nMS. FOX: Your Honor, now I remember two of the\nreasons. The first is that this probation was imposed on\n-- on my client after a conviction for a misdemeanor, and\nthe Government's arguments, and the amici arguments in\nparticular, rely tremendously on the recidivism rates for\nfelony offenders and felony probationers and fail to point\nout that in fact the recidivism rate for misdemeanant\nprobationers is substantially lower. So, I think the --\nthe magnitude of the threat that's been suggested to the\nCourt has not been borne out by the facts.\nQUESTION: Are you suggesting then we draw a\nline depending upon how serious the offense is? If you\ndon't commit a serious offense, but if you -- however, at\nsome probation you could attach this condition and other\nprobation you couldn't?\nMS. FOX: Your Honor, this condition -- I -- no.\nAnd I'll get to that in a minute. I don't believe it\nwould ever be -- I can't imagine when it would be an\nappropriate condition in light of the underpinnings of the\nFourth Amendment and our Constitution abhorrence for a\nregime of unfettered search discretion. And I think\nthat's what I'd like to get with Justice O'Connor.\nBut I do think that the magnitude of the threat,\nthe Court said in Edmonds, is never determinative --\nQUESTION: Well, then -- then one would never\nknow. A police officer would never know how a court was\ngoing to react to a search on reasonable suspicion like\nthis. He -- he would have to evaluate for himself how\nserious the offense was versus all the other balancing?\nMS. FOX: No, absolutely not, Your Honor. The\n-- the decision making would come at the time that the\ncourt imposed sentence. Now, because what I was going to\nget to with Justice O'Connor is that, you know,\nfundamentally the Fourth Amendment was, as the Court is\nwell aware, adopted for many reasons, but primarily in\nreaction to a system of general warrants, writs of\nassistance, in which petty officials could invade\ncitizens' homes at will. That unfettered search --\nQUESTION: Citizens who had not been convicted\nof crimes and who had not been placed on probation.\nMS. FOX: Yes.\nQUESTION: This person is in a different status.\nMS. FOX: Yes, and it's only because he's a\nprobationer that he can be searched without a warrant at\nall. Were he not a probationer, of course, he couldn't be\nsearched by anyone, let alone a probation officer.\nBut to get back to the Justice's question, oh,\nit's not for the officer in the field to determine. The\npoint is that the court, in imposing sentence -- and the\nFirst Circuit has gone into this in the Gianetta case,\nwhich we cite -- has -- Gianetta suggested that where you\nhave a State that has failed to establish any kind of\nregulatory scheme, such as the Wisconsin scheme, that\nwould limit the search discretion and indicate when\nsearches were appropriate, then in that case, a judge\ncould still impose a search condition, but it would be\nappropriate for the judge to make some kind of factual\nfindings --\nQUESTION: But -- but I take it then a judge's\nfinding wouldn't be conclusive necessarily. It could be\nattacked collaterally as not having been part of a system\nor having been an erroneous application of the system?\nMS. FOX: No, I -- I think what the judge would\n-- would do, in addition to making findings, is to impose\na --\nQUESTION: Well, but I'm talking --\nMS. FOX: -- narrowly tailored search condition.\nQUESTION: Yes, but I'm talking to you about a\nsituation where the judge says, you know, perhaps not\nconsistently with the system, but he says, in this\nparticular case, this person is subject to search on\nreasonable suspicion. And the -- the judge says that,\nrecognizing that he has to balance perhaps the seriousness\nof the offense, and he says, I balance it this way.\nNow, when the person is searched and that\nevidence is sought to be admitted at his trial, can the\norder of the judge be collaterally attacked by saying that\nthis judge just didn't reach the right balance in this\ncase?\nMS. FOX: Well, yes, Your Honor, though I don't\nmean to suggest, in fact, that a condition that simply\nrequired reasonable suspicion and did not ensure that it\nwas going to be probationary searches, would be\nconstitutional because the exception that we're talking\nwith here, to the Fourth Amendment, is a special needs\nexception. And that -- that's what Griffin relied on.\nAnd you only get to a special needs exception if the\nsearches that are being conducted are special need\nsearches.\nQUESTION: Well, Griffin relied on that but did\nnot say that there's -- that's the only condition. It --\nit said the Wisconsin Supreme Court had -- had adopted a\n-- a different principle, and we said -- we begin the\nopinion, we think the Wisconsin Supreme Court correctly\nconcluded that this warrantless search could not violate\nthe Fourth Amendment. To reach that result, however, we\nfind it unnecessary to embrace a new principle of law, as\nthe Wisconsin court evidently did, that any search of a\nprobationer's home by a -- satisfy the Fourth Amendment.\nWe just didn't -- didn't consider whether we needed that\nnew principle of law and maybe that new principle of law\nis at issue in this case.\nMS. FOX: Well, two answers to that, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: So, I mean, don't -- don't -- I don't\nthink Griffin precludes us from --\nMS. FOX: No, it doesn't. However, I would\npoint out first that Griffin, even the -- the Wisconsin\nSupreme Court was only talking about searches by probation\nofficers. So, the issue --\nQUESTION: Why -- why does that -- I mean,\nwhat's bothering me from a policy perspective is there are\na whole range of punishments called intermediate\npunishments, which perhaps should be encouraged, and they\ninclude things like boot camp -- not boot camps, but\nhalfway houses, home confinement, night and weekend\nconfinement, and probation. That's one of them. And so,\nwhy is it unreasonable for the State to say we want to\nencourage this kind of thing, but part of it has to be\ncheckups on people to make certain that they're not\ncommitting crimes? And the condition that you have\nchecked here in the -- in the form is simply one of those\nconditions that would help encourage, and indeed make more\nsensible, this kind of range of intermediate punishments.\nMS. FOX: Well, Your Honor, as we point out in\nour brief, the -- the intermediate sanction programs,\nwhich have been implemented, I hope effectively, across\nthis country by different States that are cited by amicus\n-- several of the amici -- not a single program relies on\nrandom searches by police. It is simply not a component\nof an effective intensive supervision program, let alone a\nregular probation system, in any State.\nQUESTION: I thought there were some other\nStates, in addition to California, that had as a condition\nof probation that you -- your premises can be searched to\ndetermine whether you are continuing -- whether you are\nengaged in crime. I did not think California was alone in\nthat respect.\nMS. FOX: Your Honor, apart from California, I'm\naware only of Virginia as having approved a blanket search\ncondition such as this with no limitations for\nindividualized suspicion and no limitation to the\nprobation officer. Many States permit probation officers,\nas part of their duties, to conduct home searches.\nQUESTION: Well, if we put individual suspicion\n-- there was reasonable suspicion in this case. If you\nadmit that one of the purposes of probation is to monitor\nthe person to make sure that they are now off their\nbottle, they're no longer committing crimes, if that's a\npurpose of probation, then why isn't this an entirely\nreasonable condition to say we have to check up on you to\nsee that you're not engaging in crime anymore?\nMS. FOX: Because it's disproportionate.\nBecause what this condition purports to do, even if we --\nif we put back a reasonable suspicion requirement, it\nstill gives police unfettered discretion, randomly,\narbitrarily, as often as they want, for no reason or any\nreason to go into, as they did in this case, Mr. Knights'\nhome --\nQUESTION: Well, but counsel for the Government\nrepresents to us that the State of California says that\nthis cannot be used for harassment.\nMS. FOX: They do say that, Your Honor, although\nthere's not a single --\nQUESTION: That's their argument. So, it's not\n-- so, it is not completely arbitrary.\nMS. FOX: Yes. I -- I'm not sure whether\narbitrary and harassing are the same, in that if there's\nno requirement of individualized suspicion, then it would\nseem to me that there's certainly a broad range of --\nQUESTION: And there was -- there was reasonable\nsuspicion here.\nMS. FOX: Yes, yes. I understand that in our\ncase.\nQUESTION: I mean, we just don't have the\nextreme here. And -- and with the help of hindsight, it\nlooked like an eminently reasonable search, for goodness\nsakes.\nMS. FOX: Well, Your Honor, looking again at the\nfacts of our particular case, that officer, Detective\nHancock, had over 12 hours during which he prepared to do\nthis search. So, it's clearly not a search that had\nexigent circumstances attached to it. It's also not a\nsearch for which he couldn't have gotten a warrant. In\nhis own view, Detective Hancock believed he could have\ngotten a warrant, and in fact, he --\nQUESTION: Well, that's a perfectly good\nargument against searching someone who's not on probation,\nbut it doesn't deal with your case to say they could have\ngotten a warrant and it wasn't exigent circumstances.\nMS. FOX: Right. I guess what I was thinking is\nit shows that -- that expanding the Griffin probation\nsearch condition, special needs doctrine, is not necessary\nto enable Detective Hancock to search because he could\nhave searched a different way. If the Court is\nconsidering going beyond Griffin and endowing police\nwith --\nQUESTION: Well, you say -- you say going beyond\nGriffin, I mean, Griffin described the Wisconsin system at\nsome length, but I don't think, as Justice Scalia\nsuggested, that we implied that every single facet of the\nWisconsin system was necessary to its constitutionality.\nMS. FOX: Certainly not, Your Honor, and I --\nand I have not sought to represent that. But what Griffin\n-- if Griffin means anything, what it does mean is that\nthere is some line between a probationary search and a\nnonprobationary, general search. Otherwise --\nQUESTION: Griffin means Wisconsin can do what\nWisconsin was doing. That's what it means.\nMS. FOX: Yes. But it's not a one-line opinion\nthat says --\nQUESTION: And it's very hard to take a case\nthat the defendant loses -- where there's a Fourth\nAmendment claim that he loses and say, aha, but in the\nnext case, he'll win because the court confined itself to\nthe situation before it.\nMS. FOX: That's -- that's correct, Your Honor.\nBut I -- I believe the Griffin analysis, in going through\nfirst considering who conducts the search, second,\nconsidering the presence or absence of reasonable\nsuspicion, and then third, concluding that it's conducted\nin conformance with the regulatory scheme that itself\nlimits discretion and is therefore constitutional --\nQUESTION: That's because we were not interested\nin -- in contemplating the creation of any new\nconstitutional law. We said this can all be fit into\nprior constitutional law on -- on the basis of the special\nneeds doctrine. But we didn't intimate that if the\nspecial needs doctrine did not apply, the thing was\nnecessarily unconstitutional. We didn't intimate that at\nall. We just were not interested in going any further\nthan we had to.\nQUESTION: May I ask you one question that I've\nbeen pondering about during the argument and don't know\nwhat the answer is? Do you think it would be\nunconstitutional for a State legislature to decide that we\ndon't want to put drug offenders in prison anymore, but we\ndo want to impose on them, in haec verba, condition 9 of\nthe probation order here and that -- and pass a statute\nand say all drug offenders who are convicted of possession\nof illegal drugs shall have to submit to that provision?\nMS. FOX: Your Honor, I think it's a close\nquestion. The -- the Court might well uphold it, although\nI might argue against it, for this reason. The condition\npermits random drug searches.\nQUESTION: Correct.\nMS. FOX: Now, that's clearly, I think,\nconstitutional if they were conducted by the probation\ndepartment. There's no reasonable suspicion requirement,\nbut in various cases, this Court has repeatedly held that\ndetection of drug abuse may be a situation in which we\ndispense with individualized suspicion because it's\ndifficult to detect always signs of inebriation. This\ncondition does appear to require an individual to submit\nto police searches. So --\nQUESTION: Right, but it seems to me that's less\nintrusive than going to jail.\nMS. FOX: It's -- well, again, I would never use\nless intrusive than jail as a standard of assessing the\nconstitutionality of a probation condition because\ncertainly a condition that the defendant pay money to the\nopposing party or the district attorney would be less\nonerous than jail, but doesn't answer whether it's\nconstitutional. So, the Fourth Amendment analysis that\nthis Court --\nQUESTION: Well, it does in a way because what\nthe -- the net result of a criminal conviction is a loss\nof liberty, and the question is which liberties can you be\ndeprived of and so forth. So, there's a definite\nrelationship.\nMS. FOX: All right.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: And you're saying that you can lose\nyour liberty by going to jail, but you can't lose this\nlesser liberty. I know every lesser included argument\ndoesn't prevail, but I don't -- I'm not at all sure why\nthis one doesn't.\nMS. FOX: It might. It would be, again, a\ndifferent case. It would be an interesting case. But it\nmay be again that the intrusion on privacy required of\nurine testing or that you'd lose as a result of urine\ntesting is minimal compared to the kind of invasion of\nprivacy we're talking about here.\nQUESTION: I don't see why it's magic that --\nthat a probation officer has to do it. I mean, there are\ncertain objectives that -- that the probation officer has\nin common with the law enforcement officer, and -- and one\nof them is to prevent individuals from committing\nadditional crimes. And what difference does it make\nwhether it's a probation officer or a law enforcement\nofficer that is pursuing that purpose?\nMS. FOX: Your Honor --\nQUESTION: What about a State that doesn't have\nprobation officers? You mean States have to have\nprobation officers? Suppose -- suppose they just say we\ndon't feel any need for special probation officers.\nMS. FOX: Well, this I think is the important\ndistinction between probation and police, and it's a two-\npart answer.\nFirst, under Scott, this Court has recognized\nthat police have different objectives than probation\nofficers. And so to the extent that we're talking about a\n-- to an extent, we are talking about a special needs\nprogrammatic exception. Certainly when the search is\nconducted by a probation officer, under Scott, the Court\nwill presume that the probation officer has a probationary\nobjective; whereas, again under Scott, a police search\ndoes not have as its goal ascertaining compliance with\nprobation or parole conditions. And the Court has\nrecognized that in determining that the exclusionary rule\nwouldn't apply to parole revocation proceedings.\nBut second, in Edmonds, the Court indicated that\nthe fact that a general law enforcement search, as a\nsecondary matter, furthers special needs -- in that case\nhighway safety -- does not bring the search scheme within\nthe special needs exception because a secondary,\nincidental furtherance of a special need doesn't change\nthe fundamental character at the programmatic level of the\nsearch.\nThat's why police searches that are conducted\npursuant to this condition are so problematic because, of\ncourse, as a secondary matter, they ensure compliance with\nprobation conditions, but the primary objective of a\npolice search, as -- as it was the objective this search\nin this case, is to investigate crime. And under the\nFourth Amendment, we've already decided as a society that\nthe hurdles of requiring a warrant and requiring probable\ncause are acceptable costs to impose on the police when\nthey're engaged in general law enforcement. That's why\nthis condition is unconstitutional.\nThe Government's consent argument that we\nstarted with doesn't save it for the reasons that I\nsuggested earlier.\nQUESTION: You said something in your brief\nabout the unconstitutional conditions doctrine rarely\napplies in Fourth Amendment cases. Now, you did say that,\ndidn't you?\nMS. FOX: That's my understanding, yes, Your\nHonor.\nQUESTION: And why do you think that's so?\nMS. FOX: I think the special needs balancing is\nthe unconstitutional doctrines -- unconstitutional\nconditions doctrine in the Fourth Amendment situation.\nIt's -- it's virtually an identical balancing, and I think\nthis Court, in assessing Fourth Amendment issues, again\nand again has returned to the special needs balancing,\nwhich is particular to the privacy interests and the State\nneeds that the Court faces when resolving a Fourth\nAmendment case. So, when you look at unconstitutional\nconditions, I think it's achieving the same end by\nrequiring a central nexus and then, most importantly,\nlooking at proportionality. I think that's what -- I'm\nsorry, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Ms. Fox.\nMr. Stewart, you have 2 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOM L. STEWART\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. STEWART: The State of California has\nrepresented in its amicus brief that the State has a\nlittle over 67,000 police officers and a little over 7,000\nprobation officers within the State. And in light of that\nfact, California has, by conditioning probation on consent\nto search by any probation officer or law enforcement\nofficer -- the State has, in effect, attempted to enlist\nits police officers in the administration of the probation\nprogram.\nThe core message that this -- excuse me -- that\nthis consent term sends to police officers within the\nState is, if you suspect that a known probationer is in\nviolation of the most fundamental term of his release --\nnamely, he's committing future crimes -- you may conduct a\nsearch that is designed to confirm or dispel that\nsuspicion --\nQUESTION: Or even you don't suspect.\nMR. STEWART: Or -- or even you don't suspect.\nBut -- but --\nQUESTION: But, I mean, that -- that's the\nproblem.\nMR. STEWART: I think it's probably more likely\nthat a probation officer would conduct a truly\nsuspicionless search, a search with no individualized\nsuspicion whatever, than that a police officer would do\nso. A probation officer might decide to conduct spot\nchecks of his charges even if there were no reason to\nbelieve that a particular individual was violating the\nlaw. A police officer would be less likely to regard that\nas an effective use of his resources and -- and the\ndepartment's resources.\nBut -- but the point here is that when a State\npolice officer conducts a search intended to confirm or\ndispel the suspicion that a probationer is engaged in new\ncriminal activity, he is contributing directly and\nprecisely to the realization of a core probation purpose.\nI have nothing further.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr.\nStewart.\n"
