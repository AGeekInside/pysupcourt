        "content": "(10:08 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: We'll hear argument\nfirst this morning in No. 02-1609, the City of Littleton\nv. Z.J. Gifts.\nMr. Nathan.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF J. ANDREW NATHAN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. NATHAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThis case presents the narrow issue of the\njudicial review appropriate for a license denial under\nLittleton's ordinance where clear, objective standards\nguide the city's quick and guaranteed decision to grant or\ndeny a license and render that decision subject to\neffective review in the courts.\nAs FW/PBS has made clear, none of the three\nrisks the Court has articulated to justify the\nextraordinary remedy of a mandated judicial deadline exist\nhere. Those risks are: the government will err in line\ndrawing between protected and unprotected speech; self\ncensorship stemming from a censored decision that speech\nis not protected; and foot-dragging when the government is\nthe plaintiff seeking to vindicate its decision to censor.\nInstead, where the decision to grant or deny a\nlicense for expressive activity is bounded by valid time,\nplace, and manner considerations, this Court has held that\ncertiorari review is appropriate. That is because the\nalleged risk here that the city clerk will violate the\nordinance when it requires a granting of a license is not\na risk that flows from the language of the licensing\nstandards at all, but rather a refusal to apply those\nobjective standards. In short -\nQUESTION: Mr. Nathan, would you explain to me\nhow this generally operates with adult shops? In the -\nin the film context, the film can't be shown. These were\nin the old days when they had censor boards. So there was\na great impetus to have quick action.\nBut here, I take it that the business was up and\nrunning and it was the city that said you need a license.\nAnd my question is, do these questions -- does the\nbusiness start first and the city come in and say you need\na license, or do -- does the entrepreneur wait until -\nand -- and apply for a license before starting up in\nbusiness?\nMR. NATHAN: Typically the latter, Your Honor.\nThe entrepreneur would apply for a license and, assuming\nit is granted, would then start the business.\nQUESTION: So this is an atypical case where the\nbusiness was running and the city came in and said, you\nneed a license?\nMR. NATHAN: This is a case where a business\nstarted and filed litigation at the same time as it\nstarted against the city in Federal court.\nQUESTION: I suppose the city could have sought\nto enjoin the operation of the business until it got the\nlicense. It didn't in this case, I take it, but they\ncould have.\nMR. NATHAN: The city -- yes, Your Honor. The\ncity did do that.\nQUESTION: The Freedman case seemed to require\nprompt judicial determination, didn't it?\nMR. NATHAN: Yes, it did, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: And it's your position that the\nsubsequent case involving PBS changed that standard?\nMR. NATHAN: In the licensing context, a\nrequirement of a prompt judicial decision we believe is\nunnecessary and that's what FW/PBS held.\nQUESTION: Well, that surprises me to hear. I\ndidn't know that's what we had done.\nMR. NATHAN: Well, the decision mentioned the\navailability of judicial review as the second Freedman\nstandard.\nQUESTION: What -- what about the proposal some\nof the States have made whereby a provisional license\ncould be given pending the eventual judicial\ndetermination?\nMR. NATHAN: The problem with the provisional\nlicense is twofold. First, it would allow the secondary\neffects that the licensing ordinance seeks to prevent\nwhile the provisional license is granted. And second, it\nwould allow the business to drag its feet in court,\nwhereas a business that needs a license has every\nincentive to pursue that.\nQUESTION: Well, if -- if there's a danger of\ndelay in litigation that -- that both parties fear -- and\napparently you feared -- isn't that all the more reason\nthat before you have a license which restricts the\npublication of allegedly lawful speech, that you should\nhave a -- a system for prompt judicial determination?\nMR. NATHAN: But where you have an ordinance,\nYour Honor, that does not deal directly with speech, has\nseparate objective licensing standards that do not have\nanything to do with speech, the government does not bear\nthe burden of going to court first. But more importantly,\nthe court should be able to determine if -- readily from a\nrecord that's created by the administrative process as to\nwhether or not the decision to deny the license is a\nsubterfuge to deny speech. And in that case, what happens\nis -- is that a mandated judicial remedy would require\ncourts to determine even those cases where the business is\nnot claiming that there's a First Amendment reason for the\ndenial. They're just claiming that the denial is\nincorrect.\nQUESTION: Well, I -- I -- you could -- if we're\nsitting here drafting a model ordinance, which is of\ncourse part of the problem that I'm presented with so far\nas the respondents are concerned, but if you're -- if\nwe're trying to envisage a model ordinance, just account\nfor that contingency, saying our prompt judicial\ndetermination procedure applies only if there's a First\nAmendment claim.\nMR. NATHAN: But I guess the question goes back\nto whether or not the risks justify imposing a mandated\njudicial deadline.\nQUESTION: How serious is the burden? There are\nnow a few circuits that have said that prompt judicial\nresolution, not merely access, is required. I think it's\nthe Fourth, Sixth, and Ninth. What has been the\nresolution there? What have cities done?\nMR. NATHAN: Well, cities have been groping for\na solution to that question. In Colorado, we would have a\nseparation of powers issue. It's very difficult to\nengraft in Littleton's ordinance a requirement that courts\nthat it does not control rule within a set period of time.\nSome of the cities have attempted to pass legislation.\nSome have attempted to create their own court systems.\nNone of those is guaranteed to work and none of them are,\nwe believe, mandated by the risks entailed.\nQUESTION: Do any of the courts which have said\nthat prompt disposition, rather than just access -- have\nthey gone on to say that prompt appellate disposition,\nbecause presumably you can appeal from the ruling of -- of\na superior court or a trial court, that that also is\nrequired?\nMR. NATHAN: I do not believe they have held\nthat, Your Honor. But I don't think that it is clear as\nto exactly how that is to be done.\nQUESTION: Because ordinarily, even if you get a\nprompt disposition in the trial court, you can wait, you\nknow, a good year before you get a disposition on appeal.\nMR. NATHAN: Yes, that's true, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Has -- has anyone suggested that your\n-- I don't know the -- the merits of this separation of\npowers problem that you raise, but has anyone suggested\nthat the answer to that may simply be not to try to\ndirectly control the courts to come down with a decision\nafter X days or weeks or whatnot, but simply have a kind\nof circuit breaker provision that if they don't, the\nlicense will be deemed to be granted?\nMR. NATHAN: Well, I -- I think that that's in\nthe nature of a provisional license which would be that\nafter -\nQUESTION: It could be provision. It could be\npermanent. If -- if the -- if the State doesn't want to\nmove fast, you would get the license in the meantime, or\n-- or perhaps get it permanently. But that would avoid\nseparation of powers.\nMR. NATHAN: But it would also create the\nsecondary risk by having an unqualified applicant, since\nthat is what we're talking about in the standards that\nwe're -\nQUESTION: Well, but we -- we don't know.\nThat's -- that's the whole point. We don't know whether\nthe applicant is qualified. That's why you're in court.\nAnd the -- the way, in effect, I -- to -- it seems to me\nto ensure your interest is simply to -- to have an\nencouragement to a prompt disposition. And if the\nmachinery of the State cannot somehow pull itself together\nto give the prompt disposition, then I don't know what\nyou've got to complain about.\nMR. NATHAN: But this Court has always presumed\nthe State courts will honor their obligations to review\nthese types of cases and determine if there are First\nAmendment issues.\nQUESTION: Oh, I'm sure the State courts will,\nbut I've come from a State court and I -- I know what -\nwhat caseloads are. And unless there is an inducement to\nmove quickly, the -- the State courts, you know, may have\nobligations to other litigants and -- and not move as fast\nas the -- as the First Amendment would call for.\nMR. NATHAN: But that's why in -- in Colorado\nthe rule 106 gives the court the ability to in its\ndiscretion, determine if accelerating the case is\nnecessary. And -\nQUESTION: In -- in which case then, if there\nwere this kind of circuit breaker provision, the -- the\ncourts would -- would have every procedural basis for\nhonoring it.\nMR. NATHAN: But, of course, if the city doesn't\nbear the burden of going to court and it's the business\nthat goes to court, it would then have every incentive to\nmove as slowly as possible because it would automatically\nget a license even if it weren't -\nQUESTION: I just didn't -- would have every\nincentive to? I just didn't hear.\nMR. NATHAN: Move slowly because it would\nautomatically get a license if a certain period of time\nwent by even if it weren't qualified under the objective\nstandards of the ordinance.\nQUESTION: But it would have to have filed its\nappeal.\nMR. NATHAN: It would have to have filed its\nappeal, but it would have every incentive not to ask that\nthat -\nQUESTION: Then -- then simply have your circuit\nbreaker saying if there's going to be an appeal, file the\nappeal within X days.\nMR. NATHAN: And -\nQUESTION: I mean, these are simply things that\nStates can provide by -- by law, it seems to me, without\nany great difficulty.\nMR. NATHAN: That's true, and I guess the\nquestion is -- is whether the risks entailed require that\nthey be imposed on the cities who have these types of\nlicensing ordinances. And we would seek to prevent the\nsecondary effects that this Court -\nQUESTION: Well, if -- if you take the position\nthat in fact the State should move promptly here, what is\nthe State going to lose by, in effect, a fail-safe\nrequirement that it must? On your theory, it's not going\nto be doing anything more than it ought to do in the first\nplace. So -- so we would -- we would be providing, on\nyour theory, for the outlier case. So what would be the\n-- what would be the reason for complaint here?\nMR. NATHAN: Just that when the plaintiff goes\nto court, the business goes to court, it would have every\nincentive to -- to try to go as slowly as possible,\nwhereas the incentive should be, if it wants a quick\ndecision, for it to move to expedite, to -- to brief\nquickly and to argue quickly and ask the court for an\nexpedited decision, and if one is not availing, to go up\nand ask the appellate court, under our rule 21 of the\nColorado Appellate Rules, to order the court to rule\nquickly.\nQUESTION: Mr. Nathan, I gather that a -- I\ngathered from your brief that your -- your principal\npoint, or at least a principal point in this case, is your\ncontention that this case is different from censorship\ncases where the judgment is left to a -- a board with -\nwith no standards as to whether a particular movie can be\nshown or not. There immediate review is necessary. Your\nclaim here is that the matters that are determined by the\nadministrative organ are not matters of censorship, but\nrather quite discernible, physical, and practical points.\nWhat -- what specifically was the basis for\nturning down the -- the license here?\nMR. NATHAN: Well, there's never been an\napplication for the license in this case.\nQUESTION: I see. Well, what -- what would have\nbeen -- what would have been the issues if the application\nhad been filed?\nMR. NATHAN: In point of fact, except for the -\nits location -- it's in an improper zone and it's within\n500 feet of a church and day care center -- Z.J. probably\nwould have been granted the license, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: But they say they're not an adult\nbusiness, and that's the preliminary characterization. I\nmean, they -- they don't have a license. They didn't\napply for one because they said, we don't need a license.\nWe're not that kind of business.\nMR. NATHAN: But, Your Honor, that issue was\nlitigated fully in the district court and the district\ncourt held that not only were they an adult business, but\nthat their arguments to the contrary were essentially\nfrivolous. Now, it took some doing, in terms of discovery\nwhere we had to provide photographs, videotapes, layouts,\nan accountant's determination of the amount of adult\nmaterials, but the district court ruled on that issue and\nfound that they were unquestionably an adult business and\neven cautioned counsel about rule 11 in their claim that\nthey weren't.\nQUESTION: This is the Federal district court.\nMR. NATHAN: Yes, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Is -- is there no court, municipal\nlevel court, in Colorado as there was in Baltimore? I\nmean, the -- the reaction of Maryland to the Freedman case\nwas to set up a proceeding in the Baltimore City court,\nand it had explicit time lines. And then it provided for\nan expedited appeal to the Maryland Court of Appeals.\nSo why -- I -- I thought that the FW/PBS case\nsaid, we're -- we're not going to follow -- the -- the\ngovernment has to go into court because it isn't like\ncensorship. But the other two apply. So why don't you\njust -- why isn't that the solution, the one that was\nadopted in Freedman for -- for the proceedings in court?\nMR. NATHAN: Well, there's a serious question in\nthe issues before the Colorado Supreme Court now as to\nwhether a municipal court can handle a 106 review or\nwhether it has to be a district court from the State. But\nagain, if you eliminate the -- what has been called the\nthird Freedman requirement of requiring the government to\ngo to court, then since it -- the -- the business is the\ncaptain of that litigation, there's no reason to force the\ngovernment to mandate a decision within a set period of\ntime.\nQUESTION: Do you concede that the second\nFreedman requirement demands that judicial review -- or\nthat -- that a judicial determination be concluded?\nMR. NATHAN: I do not, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: I thought that that's the whole issue\nhere, whether it's enough that you can promptly begin a\nsuit or whether, in fact, what -- what Freedman requires\nis that a suit has to be raced through to termination in\nthese cases.\nMR. NATHAN: Yes, Your Honor. And our position\nis -- is that the elimination of a third requirement makes\nit more rational to have the second requirement be prompt\naccess and -- and effective access to the courts which -\nQUESTION: But everyone who complains about\nadministrative action, adverse administrative action, has\na right to promptly open the door. So that, if you read\nit to just to say access, then it essentially does\nnothing.\nMR. NATHAN: In this case, however, and in many\nothers, when you have clear objective standards, a quick\nexit from the administrative process, a record of the\nreasons for the denial, then access to the court is\nmeaningful because a court can readily determine if\nthere's a subterfuge to suppress speech through the\nlicensing mechanism.\nQUESTION: And I suppose that interpreting the\nsecond requirement that way does prevent the\nadministrative agency from delaying matters by simply\ndelaying the issuance of its opinion.\nMR. NATHAN: Exactly, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: May I ask this general question? I\nunderstand the standards are different, but just in terms\nof the procedure, if I applied for a license to run a dry\ncleaning establishment, would I have a different\nprocedural set of hurdles than this litigant does?\nMR. NATHAN: The -- the licensing requirements\nin this case involve adult businesses.\nQUESTION: Right.\nMR. NATHAN: And so I'm not sure what sort of -\nQUESTION: I know the standards are different to\nqualify for it, but I'm just wondering if you're denied\nthe -- the license, are you treated any differently than\nif I had applied for -- to get into some entirely\ndifferent business?\nMR. NATHAN: I don't believe so, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: There's one curious feature in this\nand maybe you could explain it to me. Apparently this\nbusiness was denied a sales tax license and yet they were\nin business.\nMR. NATHAN: They didn't apply for a sales tax\nlicense until 8 months after they opened, and by that\ntime, because they had initiated litigation in the Federal\ndistrict court, we had already determined that they were\nclearly an adult business and therefore they were denied\nthe sales tax license because they were in an improper\nlocation, which is the only reason -\nQUESTION: Can -- can a business start up and -\na retail business without such a license?\nMR. NATHAN: No. That's why they were cited in\ncourt.\nI'd like to reserve, if there are no further\nquestions of me -\nQUESTION: Very well, Mr. Nathan.\nMr. Cole, well hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF DOUGLAS R. COLE\nON BEHALF OF OHIO, ET AL.,\nAS AMICI CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER\nMR. COLE: Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the\nCourt:\nIt is neither necessary nor appropriate to\nrequire licensing schemes like Littleton's to provide\nprompt judicial determination. It's not necessary\nbecause, as this Court's cases demonstrate, the type of\njudicial review required in licensing schemes must be\ncorrelated to the First Amendment concerns that the\nordinances present. The First Amendment risks here are\nfar less than the risks of freewheeling censorship that\nwere at issue in Freedman and its progeny. The ordinance\nhere does not license speech. It licenses businesses.\nThus, prompt access is sufficient.\nIn fact, it would be inappropriate to impose a\njudicial deadline requirement for at least three reasons.\nFirst, it would impede State and local efforts\nto control secondary effects.\nSecond, it would offend notions of comity and\nfederalism by assuming that State judges will ignore their\nconstitutional obligations to be sensitive to the First\nAmendment.\nAnd finally, it would require local officials to\nimpose time limits on those over whom they have no\ncontrol. Excuse me.\nThus, both constitutionally and\njurisprudentially, prompt access to meaningful review is\nall that the Constitution requires.\nThe Freedman decision was motivated by two\nconcerns, neither of which is present here. There's\nneither the -- the problem of unbridled discretion, nor a\nrisk of self-censorship. Unbridled discretion occurs only\nin two situations where you have either the possibility of\nadministrative delay or standardless discretion. And as\nthis Court has recognized in a number of cases, the\nlatter, standardless discretion, presents unique\nchallenges for judicial review. It makes sense in that\ncontext to require some type of judicial deadline because\nessentially meaningful judicial review on an expedited\nbasis is impossible if there's no standard to give any\nindication as to why the administrative decision was made.\nQUESTION: I -- I suppose that if we're\nconcerned, as I -- as I think the courts are concerned,\nabout protecting First Amendment rights, one thing we\ncould do is just say that if there's any apparent delay in\ndetermination, the United States district courts under\n1983 are free to -- are free to intervene at once.\nMR. COLE: And -- and, Your Honor, if -\nQUESTION: I'm not sure if that helps you or if\nit helps the respondent.\nMR. COLE: Well, 1983 is, of course, always\navailable as a vehicle for someone that's asserting that\ntheir constitutional rights have been violated.\nQUESTION: Well, except that I -- I would think\nthe municipalities and the States would raise questions\nabout deferring to the State courts for determination of\nState law issues and so forth.\nMR. COLE: Abstention doctrines, Younger\nabstention, for instance, might come to play. Here the\ncourt -- or I'm sorry -- the city waived any abstention\nargument in order to allow the 1983 case to proceed.\nPotentially it could have, notwithstanding the abstention\nargument, but of course, there would be the issue of\nabstention which is one reason why prompt access to some\ntype of State remedy is so important in -- in the case if\n1983 is not an effective vehicle.\nQUESTION: Of course, I guess we'd have to have\neither a statute, such as the statute that requires\nFederal district courts to expedite criminal cases. I'm\nnot sure a Federal district court can both take the case\nand also bump it up to the top of its docket. Can they do\nthat, leaving -- leaving behind people who have been\nwaiting several years to be heard? I don't know that that\nwill work without a Federal statute.\nMR. COLE: Well, and I guess at -- at core, it\ndoesn't matter whether you go to the Federal court under\n1983 or to State court. Presumably the sensitivity of the\njudge to the First Amendment concerns in both cases would\nbe the same and their willingness to move it to the front\nof the docket would be the same.\nWe look -- I mean, this Court has definitely in\nthe past shown that where State courts are not\nsufficiently sensitive to First Amendment concerns, for\ninstance, in the Skokie case, the Court demonstrated that\nit could fashion tools to handle what it felt was undue\ndelay in the court system.\nQUESTION: But we've also held that Federal\ncourts are -- should be very loathe to intervene in\nongoing State proceedings. Wait till the State proceeding\nis over and then you can go to Federal court.\nMR. COLE: Absolutely, and in the Skokie case,\nit came up through the State court system and directly\ninto this Court rather than via a district court model.\nBut -- but the point is as long as you have prompt access,\nyou're going to get access to a judicial official who is\ngoing to be sensitive to First Amendment concerns and, if\nnecessary, has all the traditional tools of equity\navailable to provide immediate relief, TRO's, PI's.\nQUESTION: What -- what does prompt access mean\nas opposed to relaxed access? I -- I just don't\nunderstand the content of prompt access if -- if access is\ngetting into court. That's easy. You file a complaint.\nMR. COLE: Well, you need -- under State\nsystems, most State systems have some form of requirement\nthat -- that the court knows that the administrative\nprocess is over so it knows it doesn't have to defer to\nthe administrative process anymore. So by having a clear\nexit, as well as a -- a vehicle that's either prescribed\nby rule or by statute so everybody knows the appropriate\nvehicle and there aren't any questions about the\njurisdiction of the court to hear the matter, as well as a\nrecord that -- that they can use to make a -- a prompt\nreview when it gets before them, we would contend that\nthat meets what this Court was talking about with respect\nto the second prong in FW/PBS.\nQUESTION: Does the local ordinance provide a\nlimit, time limit, for the administrative proceeding?\nMR. COLE: Absolute, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: What is -- what is that?\nMR. COLE: I believe, as it's currently drafted,\nit is up to about 40 days, but it could be even quicker\nthan that. I say up to. There are certain periods of\ntime within which the applicant can act within the next 10\ndays, and so if they act within the first day, then that\nwould shorten the time frame even further.\nQUESTION: Do you think those administrative\nrequirements are -- are mandated under the Constitution\nwhen First Amendment issues are -- are present?\nMR. COLE: A prompt administrative decision,\nyes, Your Honor. I believe that -- that comes from\nFW/PBS, as -- as well as to the -- I mean, FW/PBS's\ninterpretation of Freedman in the context of content\nneutral licensing schemes.\nQUESTION: Well, why would you go that step\nunless you're being -- you just think you're forced to\nunder our decision? Why would you go that step and -- but\n-- but then moot the whole thing out by having a -- an -\na protracted judicial process? What -- what sense does\nthat make?\nMR. COLE: Well, Your Honor, there's been no\nshowing here that there would be a protracted judicial\nprocess. The --\nQUESTION: No, no, but I -- I asked you if -- if\nyou concede that there is a requirement of expedition at\nthe administrative process -- at -- at the administrative\nlevel, it then seems to me that it also follows there has\nto be one at the judicial level.\nMR. COLE: Well, Your Honor, the -- the question\nbefore the Court today, though, is what does Littleton's\nor a town like Littleton's licensing scheme need to\nprovide. There may be some independent constitutional\nobligations on State court judges to act promptly with\nrespect to First Amendment concerns, but the question is,\ndoes that need to appear in the text of Littleton's\nordinance?\nQUESTION: Do you concede that there are such\nobligations?\nMR. COLE: I concede that -- that courts have an\nobligation under cases like Skokie to be sensitive to the\ntime concerns that are presented by First Amendment\nissues. I don't know that there's any -\nQUESTION: Mr. Cole, do you know whether there\nare any license -- city licensing schemes that say if the\n-- in the administrative proceeding it's determined that\nthe license should issue and it is the city that's\nappealing, that then it has to be expedited? On the other\nhand, if in the administrative proceedings, it's\ndetermined the license should not issue, then there the\nburden would be on the appellant applicant for the license\nto go forward.\nMR. COLE: I'm not aware of any such city\nordinances. The California statute, which was passed as a\nresult of the Ninth Circuit decision, I believe allows\neither the city or the applicant to proceed to court,\nwhatever the licensing decision is. Either the Tennessee\nor the -- I believe it's the California one. But -- but\nI'm not aware of any city ordinances that do that.\nThe -- Z.J. Gifts relies heavily at page 18 of\ntheir brief on a quote from Southeastern that says a free\nsociety prefers to punish the few who abuse rights of\nspeech after they break the law rather than throttle them\nand all others beforehand. To me, that puts a real point\non the difference between the prior restraints that were\nat issue in Freedman and Southeastern and cases like that\nand the situation here. That assumes we need to do some\nsort of sorting, bad speech and good speech, and we want\nto know should we do the sorting beforehand or after, and\nthe Court says, not surprisingly, let's them talk and then\nwe'll punish the ones who utter things that are not\nprotected by the First Amendment.\nHere there's no need to engage in that kind of\nsorting. Any adult business has the prospect for creating\nthe secondary effects that this Court has recognized in\nRenton and Young and -- so it's not a matter of sorting\nthem. It's a matter of if you're an adult business, you\nneed a license and that license might include requirements\nlike where you can locate within the city.\nQUESTION: Well, it is a matter of sorting them\nto the extent you have to figure out what's an adult\nbusiness. Now, you -- you say that that issue is not in\nthis case. Maybe we don't decide very much if that issue\nis not in this case. Why isn't that -\nMR. COLE: Well, Your Honor, I -\nQUESTION: -- a sorting type issue? You claim\nyou're not an adult business, in which case you're not\neven subject to this ordinance.\nMR. COLE: Well, but if you're not subject to\nthis ordinance, you're not going to be seeking judicial\nreview under this ordinance, and you'll do what -- what\nZ.J. Gifts did here, which is bring a facial challenge\nunder the First Amendment before you've even subjected\nyourself to the licensing scheme. One would assume that\nthe judicial review that we require to be part of the\nlicensing scheme would be to deal with those cases that\ncome up through the licensing scheme and to which the\njudicial review would then apply.\nIf the -- if the question is it's ex ante, does\nit even apply to me, that will be litigated in a different\nforum than what we're talking about here.\nQUESTION: All of which is true unless the -\nthe city chooses to do, as it did not do here, and that is\nto enjoin the operation of the business in the absence of\nthe license.\nMR. COLE: Well, and it -- if they -- if they\nseek to enjoin the business at that point, then you're\nright. They could raise the constitutional defense\npresumably that they would have. And at that point\nthen -\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Cole.\nMR. COLE: Thank you, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Mr. Gross, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL W. GROSS\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. GROSS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please\nthe Court:\nThe core policy in Freedman, recognized in this\nCourt's decision in FW/PBS, is that a decision to issue a\nlicense to present -- protect the expression must be made\nwithin a brief, specified period of time because undue\ndelay results in the unconstitutional suppression of\nprotected speech.\nQUESTION: But Freedman was actual censorship\nand this is not that.\nMR. GROSS: That's correct, Your Honor. This\ndoesn't involve a single film. This involves a\ndetermination by the licensing officer, in this case\nespecially, of the content of an entire business.\nQUESTION: Well, are you saying that the -- the\nclaims of the owner here are just as urgent under the\nFirst Amendment as in Freedman? Because certainly PBS\nsuggested they weren't.\nMR. GROSS: FW/PBS did relax the third Freedman\nsafeguard. There's no question about that. However, I\nthink in the Court's analysis of -- when the Court\nundertook that direction, the Court indicated that the\nlicense is the key to obtaining and maintaining a\nbusiness. And that's why the -- the -- why there's every\nincentive for a business to move forward with judicial\nreview in the -\nQUESTION: Has there -- has there ever been any\nproceeding here at all to determine what the issues are?\nMR. GROSS: There's been a lot of proceedings in\nthis case, Your Honor, as Mr. Nathan indicated.\nQUESTION: But -- but they're all on a challenge\nto the overall constitutionality of the -- of the city\nordinance?\nMR. GROSS: That's not entirely accurate, Your\nHonor. There -- there was a nuisance case filed in the\nState court, in the Arapahoe County District Court, and\nthe city in fact got an order enjoining the operation of\nits business. It was brought on the basis of zoning\nviolation, sales tax violation, and sexual business\nviolation.\nQUESTION: Is it -- is it operating now, the\nbusiness?\nMR. GROSS: The -- the business is operating\nnow. That order -\nQUESTION: On what basis?\nMR. GROSS: Well -\nQUESTION: I mean, happened to -- to -\nMR. GROSS: With regard to that State court\ncase, there was an order enjoining the -- the operation of\nthe business entered in September of 2001. The business\nmade a motion for a stay, pending appeal. That motion was\ndenied on December 27th of that year. There was a\ncontempt hearing. The business was moved to be held in\ncontempt. At the contempt hearing, the trial judge in the\nState court, for the first time hearing the case -- he\nfound that the business was not in contempt of court. In\nfact, the Federal court determined in the light most\nfavorable to the -- to the bookstore that 33 percent of\nthe business was allocated towards regulated adult items.\nThe district court and State court, once he saw what was\ngoing on, there's testimony that 18 percent of the\nbusiness was devoted to adult material, and the State\ndistrict court made a determination that the business was\nnot in contempt. In fact, the injunction order in State\ncourt was later reversed in the State court of appeals in\nFebruary of last year. And so at the current time, there\nis no injunction order against the business. The business\nis operating.\nQUESTION: It -- it seems to me that it's just\nmuch simpler for us to acknowledge, for the system to\nacknowledge that there's a strong First Amendment interest\nhere, so expedition is important, rather than write some\nmodel ordinance. You can go to Federal -- if -- if the\nState isn't complying with that rule, go to the Federal\ncourt.\nMR. GROSS: And -- and there was a facial\nchallenge filed at the time the business was opened back\nin August of 1999. They went to Federal court first. The\nState did seek its remedies as a State court nuisance\naction and tried to shut down the business and was\nunsuccessful ultimately.\nQUESTION: I'm just not sure why that isn't\nadequate if a Federal judge thinks that the -- the city -\nthat the State system is delaying matters and that speech\nis at risk, the Federal court could issue an injunction.\nWhy should we write a model ordinance up here?\nMR. GROSS: Well, the Federal courts are -- I\nthink, as indicated before, there are some issues of\nabstention, comity, and so forth, and those issues have\ncome up quite a bit, especially if there's pending State\ncourt proceedings. Here the -- the State did go to State\ncourt. The -- you can always go to Federal court to\nvindicate your First Amendment rights. And in -- that's\nwhat we -- what the business chose to do in this case on\nthe facial challenge. I think once the case gets started,\nonce you apply for a license and your license is denied,\nyou really need to go through the State court process.\nQUESTION: Well, but -- what -- what is the\nproblem in the case? I mean, I -- I had thought, perhaps\nnaively, that the reason that one opinion used the word\njudicial access, prompt judicial access, and the other\nopinion used the word, prompt judicial decision, is that\nthere really isn't any difference between the two. Once\nyou have prompt judicial access, the courts have loads of\ndevices to give you a prompt decision. And if you feel\nthe decision isn't prompt enough, well, you can ask the\nappellate court to make sure you get your quick decision.\nWhat's the problem?\nMR. GROSS: Well, I think Freedman said prompt\njudicial review means prompt judicial determination. I\nthink the courts may have discretion to fashion the\nremedy, but again, getting the case under the State court\ndockets, getting -\nQUESTION: Once you say that, the courts have\ndiscretion to fashion the remedy, that's the end of it,\nisn't it? Of course, you get into court and then it's up\nto the judge, and if in fact the judge, as I just said,\ndelays unreasonably, you like any other litigant have a\nhost of judicial remedies. So what is it? How do you win\nthis case once you agree to what I just said?\nMR. GROSS: Well, the core policy behind\nFreedman -- it was enunciated in FW/PBS -- is that delay\ncould -- results in unconstitutional suppression of\nspeech. And in fact -\nQUESTION: We're all against delay. I mean, I\njust don't -- I mean, everybody is against delay. And my\nquestion is what is it that you want in that respect that\nyou haven't had.\nMR. GROSS: Well, in this case there was an\nerroneous deprivation of constitutional rights. There\nwas -\nQUESTION: You mean you have not had -- you've\nhad unreasonable delay.\nMR. GROSS: Yes, and -\nQUESTION: Aren't -- isn't your client running\nhis bookstore?\nMR. GROSS: The -- the client -\nQUESTION: Then what's the delay?\nMR. GROSS: The client -- there -- there's no\ninjunction order entered in this case. The delay is that\non its face that the -- the ordinance needs to provide for\nprompt judicial review.\nQUESTION: Oh, that's a different matter. You\nthink it isn't enough, the ordinary remedies. You want\nthe ordinance to say in words judicial -- prompt judicial\nreview. That's contrary, I think, to what you just said.\nQUESTION: Well, I thought it does say prompt\njudicial review in the sense of access.\nQUESTION: Yes. Right.\nQUESTION: What doesn't it say?\nMR. GROSS: It provides -- rule -- it provides\nfor judicial review under rule 106 of the Colorado Rules\nof Civil Procedure. That process involves judicial review\nof the record, 90 days for the record, briefing schedules,\n30 days for each side, 15 days -\nQUESTION: You don't like the briefing schedule.\nIs that it?\nMR. GROSS: Well, the -- the period of time it\ntakes -- it's a very long time. It -- generally judicial\nreview -- it's an appellate -- appeal to the district\ncourt. It takes at least a year.\nQUESTION: Well, a municipal -- a municipality\nin most States can't prescribe the procedures in a State\n-- in a State court.\nMR. GROSS: That -- that is correct, Your Honor.\nCalifornia -- the legislature did enact a statute, as\nreferred to by the State of Ohio that -\nQUESTION: It's -- it's not even clear that the\nlegislature can do it in some States. Indeed, you know, I\n-- I think there are limits to what a legislature can tell\na court. I think it can't tell a court to pump out a\ndecision in 10 days. You think it -- you think it can do\nthat?\nMR. GROSS: I think it can -- it can -- it\ndepends on the court -- on a State -\nQUESTION: Why would you think under the\nConstitution that an adult bookstore has to have something\nwritten into an ordinance which -- it's entitled to a fast\ndecision. I agree with you about that. But why does it\nhave to have it written in an ordinance when a person\nwho's put in prison arbitrarily who also should have a\nvery speedy decision is required to rely on ordinary court\nprocesses to get that speedy decision?\nMR. GROSS: Well, under the First Amendment -\nand this is not a -- this is not directly on Freedman,\ncensorship of a single item. However, decisions of\nadministrative officials -- certainly administrative\nofficials are subject to much greater pressures to censor.\nQUESTION: Yes, but the administrative\nprocedures the city provides here all have these prompt\ndeadlines. You -- and -- and your business did not apply\nfor that. It just opened its doors apparently.\nMR. GROSS: It went to court. It did file a\nFederal case. It did open its doors. The city has been\nvery -\nQUESTION: And the business knew, when it did\nthat, that it was omitting the city review altogether,\nalthough it had been available very promptly. So I -\nit's hard to get a focus on what -- how -- how your client\nhas been hurt.\nMR. GROSS: The city -- well, the city indicated\nbefore the business opened its doors that it perceived it\nto be an adult business before they even opened their\ndoors. They said, we've heard you're coming to town and\nwe think you're adult business. And so that -- and then\nthe city did deny a sales tax license on the basis that it\nwas an adult business. They won't define what that means.\nThey won't put any -- any indication what those terms\nactually mean.\nQUESTION: Well, this -- this goes maybe over\nthe same ground, but let's assume that in the -- in a\ncircuit court in -- in -- say, in the Tenth Circuit, it's\nrecognized that licensing restrictions that apply and -\nand permit requirements that apply to First Amendment\nmaterials are most sensitive. And the -- and the courts\nof the circuit, both the district court and the court of\nappeals, are -- are very faithful in -- in implementing -\nin implementing that rule. Why do we have to have an\nordinance? Go to the Federal court and say speech is\nbeing chilled, speech is being suppressed, there's\nunreasonable delay. The court says, I agree.\nMR. GROSS: I -- I guess -\nQUESTION: End of case.\nMR. GROSS: We'd have to wait an unreasonable\nperiod of time to initiate that case. I think 37\nPhotographs talks about the 60-day judicial review.\nQUESTION: No. The whole -- no. The whole\npremise of my question -- maybe you're going to tell me\nit's hypothetical. The whole premise is the Federal\ncourts are open to hear claims of unreasonable delay that\n-- that chills the expression of speech.\nMR. GROSS: The Federal courts are open to that.\nI -- I would agree with that. Certainly if there are\nState court proceedings pending, there may be issues of\nabstention that we talked about before.\nQUESTION: Mr. Gross, can I ask you sort of a -\na basic question that I haven't really thought through?\nShould there be a different time schedule for the person\nwho wants to operate just an ordinary bookstore that just\nsells textbooks for schools and -- and trade books, on the\none hand, and an adult bookstore on the other hand? Would\none of them be entitled to more prompt review of his\nlicense application than the other?\nMR. GROSS: I -- I would -- yes, Your Honor. I\nthink under FW/PBS, the Court indicated that there was an\nadditional burden placed upon adult bookstores and that\nFreedman had to be complied with.\nQUESTION: So you think the Constitution\ncommands more prompt treatment of an application by an\nadult bookstore than by an ordinary bookstore.\nMR. GROSS: I -- I think it -- there's -- you\nget into the issue of -- of some kind of content -\ncorrelated content based restriction. It may be based\nupon non-content based factors.\nQUESTION: Do you need a license to open an\nordinary bookstore in Littleton?\nMR. GROSS: No, you don't, not a special\nlicense. You need a sales tax license.\nQUESTION: Well, there are other restrictions.\nYou -- I'm sure you can't open it in the middle of a\nresidential neighborhood, can you?\nMR. GROSS: A commercial business you can't\nopen. I mean -\nQUESTION: But you don't -\nQUESTION: Anywhere?\nQUESTION: You don't need a license.\nQUESTION: There's no zoning?\nMR. GROSS: There's an adult zoning provision\nin -\nQUESTION: Well, there's not just an adult\nzoning. I assume there's a commercial zone.\nMR. GROSS: Commercial zoning. That's correct.\nQUESTION: Well, so -- so they can't open it\nanywhere. They have to go through a procedure.\nMR. GROSS: They have -- they have to go through\nthe commercial -- yes, be approved for a commercial zone\nand if this -\nQUESTION: But what -- what is the commercial\nother than if they -- if they're going to set it up in a\nplace where you can have businesses -- in other words,\nthere isn't the same license requirement for these two\nbusinesses. There's a special licensing requirement for\nadult bookstores because of their secondary effects.\nMR. GROSS: Yes.\nQUESTION: What do you mean a special licensing?\nYou mean there are special zoning requirements? What else\nbesides special zoning requirements? I assume there are\nspecial zoning requirements for -- I don't know -- sulfur\nfactories and -- and, you know, all sorts of things.\nMR. GROSS: Certainly, and slaughterhouses.\nThere's commercial -\nQUESTION: For slaughterhouses, sure. Sure,\nthere are.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. GROSS: -- commercial zones, and there are\n-- and there are residential zones.\nQUESTION: Right.\nMR. GROSS: Certainly. And -\nQUESTION: Right, so I mean, this is just the\ncity has decided that it doesn't -- and -- and we said\nit's perfectly reasonable for the city to say that, that\n-- that we don't want too many of these and we want them\nin certain areas.\nMR. GROSS: And -- and that was -\nQUESTION: And it can say that about\nslaughterhouses.\nMR. GROSS: Certainly, and about adult\nbookstores. And -- and, in fact, there was challenge to\nthe adult zoning in this case and the Tenth Circuit upheld\nthe adult zoning, and these bookstores are limited to less\nthan 1 percent of the area of the City of Littleton.\nThis -\nQUESTION: Is this bookstore now operating in a\nplace where it isn't permitted to be under the Littleton\nordinance?\nMR. GROSS: It's -- the location -- yes. It's\noperating its -- if the city says it's an adult bookstore,\nit's in an improper zone. If it's not an adult\nbookstore -\nQUESTION: And -\nQUESTION: It's -- I didn't hear you.\nMR. GROSS: If -- if the bookstore is determined\nto be an adult bookstore, it's in an improper zone. If it\nis not an adult bookstore, it is in a proper zone. It's\nin a location which was formally occupied by a fast food\nrestaurant on a highly -\nQUESTION: And you take the position that if you\njust sell 18 percent of the merchandise is adult, then it\ndoesn't qualify? I don't understand.\nMR. GROSS: That -- that was what the Arapahoe\nCounty District Court ruled. We -- we were trying to\nascertain what the term, substantially significant, means.\nThe city refuses to provide any definitive determination\nof what that means. So we had to go to court, and that's\nwhat the court determined in that particular case.\nQUESTION: Now, what I don't understand is you\n-- you are concerned about the -- the efficacy of judicial\nreview. You picked your forum. You picked the Federal\ncourt rather than the State court.\nMR. GROSS: Yes.\nQUESTION: You got a review of that ordinance,\nevery piece of it, for constitutionality. I don't\nunderstand what complaint you have now about judicial\nreview, having had judicial review in the Federal court\nand having had the Federal court uphold most of this\nordinance. So you've -- you've had judicial review. How\n-- how -- how are you a proper complainant about what\naccess you might have had in the State courts if you chose\nto go there?\nMR. GROSS: Well, we -- we brought the facial\nchallenge in the -- in the Federal court. There is -- and\nthere is continuing injury in this case. The -- the\nbusiness has been cited with 2,620 violations of the\nlicensing ordinance. And in the event the Court -- the\nlaw is declared unconstitutional, those -- those\nviolations would go away. Each carries a $1,000 fine. So\nthere's potentially $2 million in fines.\nQUESTION: But you -- the -- the\nunconstitutional area left is this prompt judicial review,\nbut you've already had judicial review. That's why I\ndon't understand what is your current complaint.\nMR. GROSS: The current complaint is it's -- we\nbrought the facial challenge on the basis that it doesn't\ncomply with FW/PBS and Freedman. And there was -\nQUESTION: You think somebody else might not get\nprompt judicial review and that's enough to strike down\nthe ordinance. Right? That's what the facial challenge\nis all about.\nMR. GROSS: Well, it's -- yes, Your Honor. I\nmean, this -\nQUESTION: Your real complaint -- your real\ncomplaint is we granted certiorari. Isn't that the -\n(Laughter.)\nMR. GROSS: Well, we -- we would -- we would be\nhappy to live with the Tenth Circuit order, for sure.\nQUESTION: I have to confess to another problem.\nAs I understand part of your argument, you're contending\nyou're not an adult bookstore, an adult establishment,\naren't you?\nMR. GROSS: That's correct.\nQUESTION: So you're contending you don't have\nchallenge -- standing to challenge the ordinance.\nMR. GROSS: Well, the city says we do.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. GROSS: But we do have -- there is an injury\nin fact in this case because the city has initiated 2,620\nlicense violations, up to $2 million in fines in a\nmunicipal court. That -- that's a real injury. And, I\nmean, this isn't the case like or Pap's or like Waukesha.\nQUESTION: Maybe that's because you decided to\ngo into business without getting a license, which might\nhave been a fairly reckless thing to do, I would think.\nMR. GROSS: Well, we went to Federal court and\nthe -- the city, you know, did pursue their claims in\nState court.\nCertainly, I mean, the -- the business can't be\nfaulted for -- too much for being a business. I mean, in\nthe Waukesha case and in the Pap's case, those businesses\nwere out of business. I mean -\nQUESTION: Is -- is what you're saying that\nthere is a reliance interest on the part of these\nbusinesses? They should know that there is a -- an\nefficient licensing procedure with judicial review so they\ncan factor into their costs of -- of doing business\nwhether or not they can afford, say, 3 months of expedited\nlitigation and that this is a -- a First Amendment\ninterest.\nMR. GROSS: That's correct, Your Honor. The -\nwith regard to a -- an ongoing business, as opposed to an\nindividual work of art, getting the license is key -- is\nkey to the -- to the ability to maintain a business. And\nso an investor, an entrepreneur, trying to start a\nbusiness, hire employees, get a location, supply\ninventory, needs an assurance that there will be a\ndecision within a specific period of time by a court.\nThis is not your run-of-the-mill administrative\ndecision. This -- this involves the First Amendment issue\nbased upon content of the speech, based upon this\nordinance that is focused upon one class of businesses\nthat -\nQUESTION: If -- if the States know that the -\nthat the penalty they suffer for not doing that is having\nto submit themselves to Federal court litigation where the\nFederal courts really sweep abstention aside and so forth\nbecause of the urgency, I guess that's maybe the decision\nthat States should make.\nMR. GROSS: Well, I think the States -- they\nneed to -- it's our position they need to expedite the\njudicial review, and -- and the provisional license\ndoesn't really solve the problem.\nI would note that the municipal court -- the\nmunicipalities do have the ability to -- to enact laws, to\nhave review in the municipal court. In fact, last week I\njust went through a process where there's a requirement\nthat review occur within 75 days of the administrative\ndecision. That was in Aurora, Colorado. And that\nordinance is attached to our response for the petition for\nrehearing in the Tenth Circuit.\nQUESTION: You are content with the review in\nmunicipal court?\nMR. GROSS: No. Well, it depends on how it\ncomes out.\nQUESTION: No, I don't think so.\nMR. GROSS: But -- but certainly --\n(Laughter.)\nMR. GROSS: And we're -- we may well prevail in\nthat case, but certainly we have a right to an appeal. In\nthis case, we prevailed on the appeal in the court of -\nState court of appeals and the Tenth Circuit on this\nissue.\nQUESTION: If the -- if the municipal court was\ngood enough in Freedman, where you had a real censorship\nproblem, why shouldn't it be adequate, entirely adequate,\nfor adult bookstores?\nMR. GROSS: It may well be, Your Honor. I think\nthe -- you know, in that -- there may -- it may be -- it\nmay well be adequate if there's an independent judicial\nofficer as opposed to a -- a licensor, you know, going\nback to the Printing Act of 1662, a licensor of speech of\na bookseller. And here the definition of adult bookstore\nis -- is really dim and uncertain. We don't know what it\nmeans.\nQUESTION: Yes, but -- but we're not talking\nabout censorship. I mean, we're not talking about a\nlicensor who says you can sell this book or you can't sell\nit.\nMR. GROSS: We're not talking about a licensor\nthat talks a specific book. We -\nQUESTION: Is a -- when you talk about a\nmunicipal court, do you mean the municipal court, say, of\nthe City of Littleton or a municipal court created by the\nState of Colorado?\nMR. GROSS: This would be the City of Littleton\nmunicipal court or the City of Aurora is the one I was\nreferring to before.\nQUESTION: Would -- would you explain one\npuzzling thing? Mr. Nathan told us that the district\ncourt said, of course, they're an adult bookstore. That's\nso clear. On that basic characterization whether you are\nor are not adult business, the Federal court, according to\nMr. Nathan, said you were an adult business. Is that over\nand done with now so what you're left with is you are an\nadult business and you have to get a license?\nMR. GROSS: On that day? I mean, that was the\nFederal court's decision. The Tenth Circuit did affirm\nthe decision, in little bit less harsh terms than the\ndistrict court, but certainly the decision was affirmed.\nThat is the final determination in this part of the case.\nThe business -\nQUESTION: And yet, you're still operating in a\nplace where you can't be if you are an adult business.\nMR. GROSS: Well, in response to that court\norder, the business has changed its operation quite a bit.\nThis is not a -- a theater. This is not an arcade. This\nis not a cabaret with live entertainment. This is a store\nthat has a certain percentage of its stock and trade in\nregulated adult material. It reduced that number. It\ncreated a separate section. It's tried to comply with the\ncity. It is willing to comply even further as long as -\nQUESTION: But that issue is not before us and\nisn't open. That's been decided, hasn't it?\nMR. GROSS: Yes, yes.\nQUESTION: So we can take this case and decide\nit on the basis this -- that it is an adult bookstore\nwe're talking about -\nMR. GROSS: Yes.\nQUESTION: -- that must get a license.\nMR. GROSS: Yes.\nQUESTION: So we don't have to get tangled up in\nthis other business, do we?\nMR. GROSS: No, we don't. The Court does not.\nI would note that, however, the -- the city says\nthat there's no discretion in this case, that it's purely\na ministerial decision. And to the extent that there's\ninherent vagueness in the definition of substantial and\nsignificant, it indicates that a licensing official can,\nin fact, exercise judgment and exercise some discretion -\nQUESTION: But that issue is not here.\nMR. GROSS: That -- that's -- it's correct. I'm\njust -\nQUESTION: I thought we were just -- I thought\nwe took the case to decide whether the requirement for\nprompt judicial review means prompt judicial decision at\nthe end of the day or just prompt access to the review.\nMR. GROSS: And that -\nQUESTION: There's a split of authority on that\npoint.\nMR. GROSS: Yes. And that is -\nQUESTION: And that's what we took the case to\ndecide.\nMR. GROSS: Yes.\nQUESTION: Not whether there's substantial\ndiscretion or not.\nMR. GROSS: No. No, that's -- I'm just trying\nto counter their argument, but certainly it really doesn't\nmatter if there's discretion of not. It's our position\nthat even if there's not discretion, there needs to be a\nprompt judicial determination.\nThe licensors are subject to many pressures.\nThey're -- they're humans. It's a human situation and as\nthe Tenth Circuit recognized, these businesses are very\nunpopular. These businesses can be subject to a -- the\ndiscretion in -- in the decision. And there needs to be a\nprompt -\nQUESTION: I'm not -- I'm not sure whether that\n-- that helps or hurts your case. What -- what I find\nreally peculiar is that if, you know, some homeowner has\nanother child, need -- needs to put in a new bedroom in\nthe home, that person has to go through the normal zoning\nprocedures and get -- you know, get -- get approval from\nthe -- from the electrician licensing board and everything\nelse and then go through judicial review. Likewise, if a\nnew hospital seeks to locate, they -- they have to go\nthrough zoning and all the other approvals and then\nthrough normal judicial review.\nAnd -- and what you're arguing is that somehow\nadult bookstores are -- are so significant to the -- to\nthe life of the community, because of the First Amendment,\nthat -- that we have to give them special treatment. You\nknow, I -- I have to wait 2 years before I can put in my\nbedroom, but the adult bookstore goes right to the head of\nthe line. That seems to be very strange. And if -- if\nthat's where we've arrived at, we -- we ought to retrace\nour steps perhaps.\nMR. GROSS: Well, I would -- those are laws of\ngeneral application, and certainly an adult bookstore, if\nit went through the normal process, would have to go\nthrough the same process as any other bookstore or any\nother commercial business or -- or the residential person\nadding addition.\nIn this case they've created a special burden\nupon adult bookstores. The city -- if the adult bookstore\nopens or any bookstore opens and doesn't follow along with\nthese -- with these particular -\nQUESTION: But the -- the only burden is as to\nlocation, is it not?\nMR. GROSS: There's additional burdens in terms\nof licensing fees, inspections, applications. There's\nadditional burdens for hours of operation, for -- cabarets\nand arcades have additional restrictions, regulations that\ndon't apply to this store.\nQUESTION: But those -- those really don't raise\nFirst Amendment concerns, do they, the fact that you might\nbe limited in your hours, you couldn't go past 2:00 p.m.\n-- 2:00 a.m.?\nMR. GROSS: Arguably they -- they raise First\nAmendment concerns in terms of time, place, and manner\narguments, and I think there may -- there's a case out of\nthe Ninth Circuit. It may be before this Court on a cert\npetition with regard to an hours operation. But they\narguably raise that there are additional burdens. Just\nlike in FW/PBS, there was an additional burden placed upon\nthese stores on -- by virtue of the content of the\nmaterial that is sold and distributed from the bookstore.\nNow, there's been many proceedings in State\ncourt in this case and that's -- that's what we've talked\nabout. The court -- in fact, there was an injunction\nissued and the State has the power to enforce laws of\nhealth, safety, and welfare against the bookstore.\nQUESTION: How about the sales tax? You're\nstill operating without a sales tax license, but you're\nselling things.\nMR. GROSS: We -- we have worked out an\nagreement with the city where they do pay the sales tax.\nThey did not grant the license, but we have managed to\nresolve that issue. The store has been collecting sales\ntax and has been paying the sales tax.\nBut the city -- and at the current time, the\ncity has not moved to follow up on their -- their nuisance\ncase in State court to enjoin for not having a sales tax\nlicense. Of course, that -- that is based upon the -\nwhether the definition of a store is adult or not adult.\nBut the city retains the power to -- to enforce the law\nthrough nuisance cases, just like any other case, in time\n-- with regard to health, safety, and welfare of\nbusinesses.\nQUESTION: Not enforce the licensing law.\nEnforce the secondary -- go after the secondary effects\nnuisance laws.\nMR. GROSS: They could enforce those too. The\nlicense -- the zoning law would be a secondary effects\nlaw, and there -- and at this point there is no injunction\nin State court. The city is not proceeding on that case\nat this point, in which there's an injunction issued based\nupon the State court order -- excuse me -- the Federal\ncourt order. That injunction was reversed on appeal in\nthe State court. There's been litigation on all different\nfronts in this case, in State court, district court,\nmunicipal court, as well as the Federal court. Of course,\nwe're here on the Federal case.\nQUESTION: It sounds like you've got a lot of\naccess.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. GROSS: We -- it's -- you can file a\nlawsuit. I mean, there's -- certainly you can -- you have\na right to file a lawsuit everywhere you can, and we've -\nwe've -- there has been lawsuits filed by both the city.\nAnd the city had access on the -- on the injunction case.\nThere was a stay denied, in fact, after -- after the\ninjunction was issued. I mean, this business has been\nfighting to stay open. It's been fighting and has stayed\n-- in fact, stayed open unlike the case in Waukesha and\nPap's, you know.\nI mean, it's clear municipalities have taken\nevery opportunity to try to regulate these businesses, try\nto put in every obstruction possible with regard to\ngetting these businesses to -- to be closed down.\nNow, the issue -- the answer to the question\nbefore this Court is that the essential constitutional\nrequirement -- and that was identified in -- in the FW/PBS\ncase as an essential requirement -- is that prompt\njudicial determine does actually mean prompt judicial -\ndoes mean prompt judicial determination without an\nactual -\nQUESTION: It didn't say it in -- it said prompt\njudicial review, whatever that meant.\nMR. GROSS: That's correct, based upon Freedman.\nAnd if -- if we take it back to Freedman, you read\nFreedman and Freedman does -- did provide a right of\naccess, a right of appeal and talked about judicial review\ninterchangeably with prompt judicial determination,\ndisposition, and so forth.\nNow, without an actual judicial disposition, the\nadministrative officials will have the power to shut down\nan entire business, not simply a single work of art, but\nit will be an entire business. If there's an error -- if\nthere's an error with regard to -- to what is -- what the\nlicensing official says, that's why prompt judicial review\nis so important in this case. The erroneous deprivation\nof the speech rights will -- will cause irreparable\ninjury, and that's the core policy behind the Freedman\ncase.\nNow, in the absence of prompt judicial review,\nthe -- the status quo will be silenced. In this case, the\nbookstore went to court and get -- got the access, but -\nand the trial court will be understandably reluctant to\nalter the status quo of silence. And that is essentially\nthe default position of any trial court. So without an\nexplicit statement from this court with regard to the\nsecond prong of Freedman, it's not -- I think it's\ndifficult to assume that a State court with its heavy\ndocket will actually provide a prompt decision.\nQUESTION: Is there any experience in that\nregard? This ordinance has been on the books for a time.\nHave the State courts been dragging their heels?\nMR. GROSS: Well, yes, this law was enacted in\n1993. It's been amended many times. In this case, the\nState nuisance action was filed in January of 2000, and\nthe district court issued its order in September of 2001,\nand that order was reversed in February of 2003. That's\nthe normal course of -- of events in the State court\nlitigation. The city did not move for a preliminary\ninjunction. They did move for contempt. It took a few\nmonths to get the contempt heard, and once the contempt\nwas heard, it came out in favor of the bookstore. So\nthat's -- that's the experience in this case.\nThis is the only adult business that's ever\nexisted in the City of Littleton. There's never been one\nbefore. There were apparently a couple of massage parlors\nabout 10 years ago. And the city has put -\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Gross.\nMr. Nathan, you have 2 minutes remaining.\nMR. NATHAN: Unless there are any questions, I\nhave -- I feel no need for rebuttal. Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr. Nathan.\n"
