        "content": "(11:06 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument\nnext in Jones versus Bock, and Williams versus Overton.\nMr. Andre.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JEAN-CLAUDE ANDRE\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. ANDRE: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nIn these three cases, each of the three\npetitioners filed administrative grievances with the\nMichigan Department of Corrections. The Michigan\nDepartment of Corrections conducted investigations and\nissued final decisions on the merits of petitioner's\ngrievances. Nevertheless, a year and a half later, each\nof the petitioner's complaints was thrown out of federal\ncourt without leave to amend because petitioners failed\nto satisfy on of the Sixth Circuit's judge-made\ncorollaries to the PLRA's exhaustion requirement. None\nof those three corollaries find any meaningful support\nin the Federal Rules of Procedure, in fact they\ncontradict the federal rules. Nor do they find any\nsupport in administrative law or habeas law, the two\nareas of law to which this Court looks for guidance in\ninterpreting administrative litigation and format.\nFinally, the overwhelming majority of the circuits that\nhave considered these questions have rejected them all.\nI'd like to begin with the heightened\npleading rule that the Sixth District applied here. The\nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure require a plaintiff to\nsimply provide a short claim statement of the basis on\nwhich his or her claim will lie. The Federal Rules of\nCivil Procedure do enumerate certain kinds of\nallegations that a plaintiff must plead with\nspecificity, those are enumerated in Federal Rule of\nCivil Procedure 9(c), but exhaustion is not one of them.\nAccordingly --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose the district court\nfinds that in its experience, 80 percent of the claims\nare ones that are unexhausted, just assume that. And\nthe district court said, the only way I can figure out\nthe good 20 percent from the 80 percent that are going\nto ultimately be dismissed is to have a motion for a\nmore definite, an order for a more definite statement,\nbecause I'll do it sua sponte under 12(e), I think. Can\nthe district court do that?\nMR. GRANT: I think that would be correct,\nand that would be consistent with the Court's habeas\njurisprudence.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: The court could ask for a\npleading which set forth the facts of exhaustion?\nMR. ANDRE: I believe that's true.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Then why isn't this --\nthis is just the same if the court has said, you know,\nin order to make our screening function efficient, we\njust have to know about exhaustion.\nMR. ANDRE: Well, first of all, when\nCongress created the various screening provisions in the\nPLRA, it noticeably omitted exhaustion. It clearly had\nexhaustion in mind when it enacted the PLRA. The term\n\"exhaustion\" appears in 42 U.S.C. 1997 --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: How about, what, if you\nconcede the district court could do it in individual\ncases or in most cases, why can't the Sixth Circuit do\nit? That's my question.\nMR. ANDRE: Well, what sets the Sixth\nCircuit's rule apart from I think the hypothetical you\npropose, and also from this Court's habeas jurisprudence\nis that in both of those scenarios the plaintiff, the\nprisoner, is given a chance to respond. In the Sixth\nCircuit, if they don't they don't satisfy the heightened\npleading rule at the minute that they file their initial\ncomplaint, they are out. There is no leave to amend,\nand that's what happened in this case.\nIn Petitioner Jones' case, he filed the\ncomplaint and he actually did allege that he exhausted\nhis administrative remedies. He said: I exhausted my\nadministrative remedies, I filed my step one grievance\non this date, I received a denial on that date, and he\nwent down the list through all three steps.\nJUSTICE ALITO: The briefs point out that a\nnumber of district courts have form complaints that are\noften used in these cases and that these forms call on\nthe prisoner-plaintiff to address the issue of\nexhaustion. Now, do you think there's something wrong\nwith those forms, and if a prisoner fills out the form\nand reveals in filling it out that a claim was not\nexhausted, is it improper for the district court at the\nscreening stage to dismiss the case?\nMR. ANDRE: With respect to the form, I\ndon't think that the form is improper, but I think it\nwould be improper for a court to dismiss the prisoner's\ncase if the prisoner failed to fill out the section of\nthe form that asks him about exhaustion because\nexhaustion is an affirmative defense in both\nadministrative law and habeas, and there's no indication\nin this statute that Congress --\nJUSTICE ALITO: If it's an affirmative\ndefense, then why is it -- why is it proper for a\ndistrict court, for a district court, to have a form\nthat calls on the plaintiff to negate the affirmative\ndefense?\nMR. ANDRE: I think the district court can\nask the plaintiff pretty much whatever the district\ncourt likes. But whether the district court could,\ncould dismiss a case for failure to comply, failure to\nrespond to that question, that's another matter.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, we know under\nthe statue they can dismiss a case because it's\nfrivolous, right?\nMR. ANDRE: Absolutely.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Regardless of the\nsubstance of the claim on the merits, if you know that\nyou've just ignored the exhaustion requirement isn't\nthat a frivolous claim?\nMR. ANDRE: We would certainly concede that\nif it is clear on the face of the complaint that a\nprisoner has not exhausted his or her administrative\nremedies then that claim can be dismissed. I guess the\nway it would operate -- and I haven't seen a case like\nthis -- but it would be where a prisoner says, I didn't\nexhaust my administrative remedies and I have no excuse\nfor failing to do so, but please, district court, please\ntake mercy on me. And in that situation the district\ncourt could say, there's absolutely no way you can\npossibly prevail on the merits, so your claim --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Probably the reason they do\nthis is that there are lots and lots of claims by\nprisoners in Federal courts that are hard to decipher.\nThey don't know what it's about. They don't want to put\nthe defendant to the burden of coming in in every single\ncomplaint when it's quite a good probability it's about\nnothing. That's the kind of reasoning that would lead\nto a rule like this. So -- and then you have the\nstatute and the statute says indeed there's a special\npower here to dismiss if it's frivolous or it doesn't\nstate a claim or malicious.\nSo why isn't this just an exercise of the\nSixth Circuit's or a court's ordinary subsidiary\nrulemaking powers? They're trying to figure out how to\nmanage their docket.\nMR. ANDRE: The problem is that it conflicts\nwith Federal Rule of Civil Procedure Rule 8. And as\nthis Court this repeatedly said, including as recently\nas last term in Hill v. McDonough, the Court will not\nimpose a heightened pleading requirement absent an\namendment to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So your point would be that\nthey can do this if we amend the Federal Rules. If it's\na problem take it to the Rules Committee?\nMR. ANDRE: I think that's correct. I think\nthat's correct, but if it --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: If we amended the rules\nthat way, in effect it would no longer be an affirmative\ndefense. I mean, by definition an affirmative defense\ngets raised by the defendant and so on, so if we amended\nthe Federal Rules in practical terms it would be like\nadding an element to the claim.\nMR. ANDRE: Right. Or if the Court were to\nadd PLRA exhaustion to the Rule 9(c).\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But Rule 8 and the\nnormal rules weren't addressed to the unusual situation\nunder the PLRA where the district court has an\naffirmative obligation screen on its own before the\ndefendant even gets involved. So if in fact, just to\nfollow on Justice Kennedy's hypothetical, 80 percent of\nthe cases have this exhaustion problem, why isn't this a\nreasonable means of facilitating the screening\nobligation?\nMR. ANDRE: It may be a reasonable means,\nbut that doesn't necessarily mean that it's permissible,\nbecause Congress had exhaustion in mind when it enacted\nthe PLRA and noticeably absent from all the PLRA\nscreening provisions is the term \"exhaustion.\"\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but you just\ntold me earlier that if it was a case in which\nexhaustion is required and not done that would be a\nfrivolous claim, and the statute does refer to frivolous\nclaims. So the district court or the Sixth Circuit has\njust said, we know that in a large number of cases they\nare going to be frivolous because they have ignored the\nexhaustion requirement, and we just want to try to find\nout which those cases are to fulfill the screening\nobligation, which takes this out of the normal Rule 8\ntype of case.\nMR. ANDRE: Right, I think I understand. I\nthink it goes back still to the fact that there's not a\nclear Congressional expression to take these cases out\nof the Federal Rules. In Califano v. Yamasaki we\nbelieve is instructive on that point. In in that case\nthe Secretary of the Department of Health Education and\nWelfare had argued that Section 205(g) of the Social\nSecurity Act, which used the term \"individual,\" somehow\ntook those, those judicial review procedures, out of the\noperation of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23. This\nCourt said: No, we cannot read the word \"individual\" as\nsuch a clear expression. It may have been Congress's\npolicy to have individual claims be addressed one by\none, but you have to find that clear expression in the\nstatute and that clear expression is not here.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, what about 1997(e) and\n(g), which prohibits, seems to prohibit a case from\ngetting beyond the complaint, not even to the answer\nunless the district court finds that the plaintiff has a\nreasonable opportunity to prevail on the merits.\nDoesn't this clearly take this out of the normal\npleading procedures?\nMR. ANDRE: I don't think so, Justice Alito.\nWe have exhaustively researched that language, the\nreasonable opportunity to prevail on the merits 1997(g),\nand the only courts that construe that language are\ncourts construing 1997(e) and (g), and they have\nuniversally found that that provision simply summarizes\nthe other screening provisions' terms, so, frivolous,\nmalicious, fails to state a claim, or seeks -- from an\nimmune defendant. And we can't really think of what,\nwhat else Congress would have had in mind because while\nit's like the preliminary injunction standard it makes\nno sense that Congress wanted a prisoner to satisfy a\npreliminary injunction standard before requiring prison\nofficials to respond.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Would your answer be\ndifferent if amendment were allowed? I mean isn't the\nproblem in substance here, and I don't mean to dismiss\nyour arguments from the rules, but leaving the argument\nfrom the text of the rules aside, it wouldn't be a real\nproblem here in substance if the circuit bar allowed\namendment, would it?\nMR. ANDRE: I think if the circuit were to,\nSixth Circuit were to allow amendment it would certainly\nmitigate the situation. It's our position that the\nscreening provisions can't overrule Federal Rule of\nProcedure 15 either, but the problem we see with even\ndoing away with the no amendment rule, but keeping in\nplace the heightened pleading rule, is that we are\ntalking about prisoners. Prisoners who don't have a lot\nof access to materials. They may have -- legal\nmaterials. They may have great difficulty holding on to\ntheir, their formally filed grievances.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Andre, didn't you\nhave in one of that's cases that the exhaustion was\nspelled out by the defendant, there was a complaint that\nalleged exhaustion, generally but not in all detail.\nThen the answer attached every piece of paper that came\nup at all three levels of the grievance procedure, and\nthen the plaintiff said oh, that's a good idea, I'm\ngoing to copy all those documents and make them my own.\nAnd nonetheless, that case was dismissed for failure to\nallege exhaustion in sufficient detail although the\nrecord made it plain that there had been exhaustion.\nThe rule that you are opposing would operate that way.\nIf you don't allege exhaustion in detail, it doesn't\nmatter that the deficiency has been made up by the\nanswer. You go out. Wasn't that the decision in one of\nthese cases?\nMR. GRANT: Yes. That was in Petitioner\nJones's case, and that -- Petitioner Jones's case is a\ngreat example of how the heightened pleading rule and\nthe no amendment rule work together to result in a\nprisoner being unable to cure any problem with his or\nher initial complaint.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You talk about the\nlack of statutory direction on the first two points but\nthere is a very explicit statute on the third question.\nIt says no action shall be brought until administrative\nremedies are exhausted. And yet you say the action\nshould be allowed to be brought even if there are\nunexhausted claims in the complaint.\nMR. ANDRE: Well, I -- we concede that an\naction that contains unexhausted claims or a mixed\naction shouldn't have been brought in the first place,\nbut it's there. And the question then becomes what to\ndo about it. And the language no action shall be\nbrought; it's very common in administrative exhaustion\nschemes, the Americans with Disabilities Act uses almost\nidentical language, the Immigration Nationality Act uses\nvery similar language, Title VII --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: This is a very\ndifferent statutory scheme. This is designed to address\nthe problem of an overwhelming number of frivolous\ncomplaints that result in the fact that meritorious\ncomplaints can be overlooked. We've got a haystack in a\nneedle problem here. And if you allow the action to\ncontinue, that doesn't do anything to reduce the number\nof filing of claims that as you say should not have been\nbrought.\nMR. ANDRE: I guess I should be clear at the\noutset that we are by no means advocating that a\nprisoner can shoe horn in unexhausted claims with\nexhausted claims. So the unexhausted claims must go.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well right, but you\nprovide under your approach no incentive for the\nprisoner to leave those claims out. Instead what, a\nscreening function turns into an editing function. The\ndistrict court is supposed to just excise out the\nunexhausted ones but allow the exhausted ones to\ncontinue.\nMR. ANDRE: Well, it's been our experience\nand from reading the case law it appears that prisoners\ndon't intentionally try to shoe horn in unexhausted\nclaims with their exhausted claims. It's typically\nbased on innocent mistake, a simple failure to\nunderstand either the particular circuit within which\nthey are housed, a difficulty in understanding that\ncircuit's exhaustion law, difficulty in understanding\nthe prison grievance procedures that they attempted to\ncomply with, and perhaps even being further confused by\nthe fact that prison grievance administrators seem to\napply prison grievance regulations, I don't want to say\nin an ad hoc manner, but inconsistently. And so when\nthey bring these complaints that are mixed they actually\nare intending to bring a fully exhausted complaint but\nthen after a little built of judicial review, it becomes\nclear that they didn't exhaust.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Why does it hurt if you\ndismiss the whole thing? They could just refile.\nMR. ANDRE: Well, it hurts for a couple of\nreasons. Well -- and -- it hurts under the Sixth\nCircuit's rule because they did not allow prisoners to\namend. So --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No. No. What would happen\nis you just dismiss the complaint.\nSo -- I guess again the reason they have\nthese things is they get a certain number of complaints,\nthey have no idea what it sys, to tell you the truth,\nthey don't know what the claim is, they don't understand\nit, there are a lot of things written here; the person\nwasn't represented; it's hard to make out. And for, the\njudge thinks I have to go through all these papers; I\nhave to figure out if there is something here that was\nexhausted, we know something happened; it was something\nexhausted -- so the simplest thing is just dismiss it.\nNow the prisoner can always refile it with\nthe parts that he has to now figure out were exhausted.\nNow is -- and it doesn't hurt because, just refile it.\nMR. ANDRE: It doesn't hurt if the --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Is that true? Or what\nhappens?\nMR. ANDRE: Well, I guess there is two\ndifferent versions of the total exhaustion rule as it's\ntermed. There is the Eighth Circuit's rule with is with\nleave to amend. So the complaint is dismissed, and\nprisoner can file a new complaint without the\nunexhausted claims.\nThen there is the Sixth Circuit's rule,\nwhich is the most draconian of all the versions. And\nthat says the entire action is dismissed, prisoner must\ninstitute a new action.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Why is that draconian?\nMR. ANDRE: It's draconian because by the\ntime the prisoner refiles his or her action there could\nbe a statute of limitations problem. The prisoner may\nnot be able to bring those claims any more. In fact the\nFifth Circuit in --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Does he have to file a new\nfiling fee?\nMR. ANDRE: Not in the Sixth Circuit\nanymore, and not in the Fourth Circuit.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How many prisoners\npay the filing fee in the first place?\nMR. ANDRE: I believe they all do. If they\nqualify --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: They are not\nentitled to IFP status?\nMR. ANDRE: If they get IFP status, all that\nmeans -- well, first of all, they only get to do that\nthree times. Or to have three actions dismissed before\nthey lose their IP status.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is that a draconian\nrule, do you think? You have to have three actions\ndismissed before you have to pay the filing fee?\nMR. ANDRE: No, no, no. I mean -- but\nthat's not really at issue in this case. But even if\nthey qualify for IFP status they still have to pay the\n$350 filing fee. It's just taken out in installments.\nAnd so for a prisoner who makes $2.50 a day or $2.50 a\nweek it -- it is costly for them to --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I guess this is\nprobably not a question for you, but a question for your\nfriend on the other side. You can ask, why does it\nhurt? You can also ask why does it help? What good\ndoes it do to bounce the whole thing back when you're\njust going to have them filed again?\nMR. ANDRE: I think that's exactly right,\nJustice Scalia.\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, well, the reason it\nwould hurt is because it's difficult for the judge to go\nthough this complaint that he can't quite make sense out\nof. And it puts the burden of the prisoner to go\nthrough and figure out what he really wants to say.\nThat's why -- that's why it's easier for the judge just\nto dismiss it than to go through many, what could be\nmany pages with a fine-toothed comb trying to figure out\nif there is anything here that was exhausted.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And the other\nincentive is if you adopt your rule, the incentive on\nthe prisoner is to put in every possible claim, even if\nit is not exhausted because maybe it will get through,\nmaybe it won't. And if it doesn't get through, no harm.\nHe doesn't even have to pay another $50.\nMR. ANDRE: But I think at least, at least\nunder that scenario, the district court still only has\nto take one look at the case and then it can move\nforward, it deletes the unexhausted claims. So from a\njudicial efficiency standpoint I think the Ortiz V.\nMcBride rule out of the Second Circuit, which is the\nrule that we are advocating, is -- is the cleanest\napproach. It takes the choice away from the prisoner;\nit puts the choice with the district court, and it\nallows the district court to delete off any unexhausted\nclaims. And in most instances --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Is there any argument that\nif the state does not insist on exhaustion or plead\nexhaustion, that it just drops out of the case? If the\nstate resolves the case on the merits even though there\nis no exhaustion, can the Federal court hear it, that\nthere is general agreement about that?\nMR. ANDRE: I think there is. The circuit\n-- the four circuits that we know were unanimous that\nPLRA exhaustion is not jurisdictional, and in Woodford\nwe know this Court confirmed that. And so to the extent\nthat the PLRA exhaustion is an affirmative defense, then\nit would operate like other exhaustion schemes in\nadministrative -- administrative law, and habeas, where\nit is waivable by the other side.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: If -- if we accept your\nfirst two arguments, then if there is no heightened\npleading rule and you don't have to name the specific\ndefendants in the administrative grievance that you end\nup naming in the complaint, if you prevail on both of\nthose, then isn't the third question, have you, what\nhappens when you haven't properly exhausted, is really\nnot alive anymore in this case, because you will have\nproperly exhausted. So why should the Court go on to\nanswer what would happen if you hadn't properly\nexhausted?\nMR. GRANT: Respectfully, Justice Ginsburg,\nit's unfortunately more complicated than that. If the\nfirst question in the Jones case, the ID pleading rule\nquestion, is resolved in favor of Petitioner Jones, then\ntotal exhaustion is a live issue. Because the Sixth\nCircuit as an alternative holding justified the\ndismissal of Jones's complaint on the total exhaustion\nground. And I guess on the other side if the Court were\nto resolve the identifying the defendant's issue against\nPetitioner --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But the Sixth Circuit\nobviously would have been wrong; if he has totally\nexhausted; they have, gave that as a no alternative\ngrounds, but if they are wrong on the first one and he\nhas exhausted. That's the end of it.\nMR. GRANT: The Sixth Circuit -- and it's\nnot really clear from this opinion, because it's an\nunpublished opinion, but the Sixth Circuit appears to\nhave adopted the magistrate judge's finding which is\nbased on respondent's motion to dismiss that Jones\nsubstantively, for lack of a better word, didn't exhaust\nall of his claims, so -- I'm sorry. I'm not being\nclear.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: That was the case where\nthe, where the defendant estate, wasn't that the case\nwhere they put in all the papers from the administrative\nrecord?\nMR. ANDRE: Yes. But they also argued that\nJones failed to exhaust his administrative remedies on\neverything but his First Amendment retaliation claim.\nOr what they termed his negative work --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, but they were wrong\nabout that. If, if there was exhaustion in the case,\nand if there is no rule that you must name everything\nthe defendant that you end up suing, if those two are\nestablished, again wouldn't we be dealing with a moot\nquestion? Moot in this case?\nMR. ANDRE: I don't think so, Justice\nGinsburg. I think in order for the total exhaustion\nissue to be moot, the heightened pleading requirement\nwould have to be resolved against Petitioner Jones, and\nthe naming the defendants issue would have to be\nresolved in favor of Williams and Walton. I charted out\non a matrix and verified it a couple of times.\nTurning to the naming issue if I could,\nsince we haven't addressed that, the Prison Litigation\nReform Act simply sets a floor of how much specificity a\nprisoner must provide in his or her grievance. It does\nnot require what the Sixth Circuit held here which is\nthat as a matter of Federal statutory law a prisoner\nmust have identified every individual who he or she\nlater sues in Federal court. This is a kind of endemic,\nor flows logically from the Court's decision in Woodford\nV. Ngo. Woodford v. Ngo says that prisoners must comply\nwith grievance procedures.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You would have no problem,\nI assume, if the state simply requires that you name the\nindividuals?\nMR. ANDRE: I guess broadly speaking no; in\ncertain cases yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: To the extent possible, I\nsuppose.\nMR. ANDRE: Right. Exactly. If -- in\nMichigan they have a --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Then, then there would not\nbe exhaustion unless he had named the individuals.\nMR. ANDRE: I believe that's correct. I\nmean, although I guess --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So we may not be, may not\nbe litigating about a whole lot here.\nMR. ANDRE: No, right. I think really the\nquestion is an X or not X question. It's does the PLRA\nas a matter of statutory law required individuals to be\nnamed in the underlying grievances, and the PLRA is\nentirely silent on that question, and this Court's\ndecision in Sims v. Apfel lends further lends further\nsupport to the proposition that a Federal court cannot\ngo beyond what the particular administrative agency's\nrules require. I realize that was a plurality decision\nbut I think the petitioners win under either the\nplurality opinion or under Justice O'Connor's\nconcurrence. And so yes, Justice Scalia we agree with\nyou that it's simply an X or Y question that down the\nroad perhaps the Court could address the scenario where\na prison system amends its rules to require individual\ndefendants to be named and then perhaps a prisoner can't\ncomply with that based on the short previous filing\ndeadlines, and then there is a question of whether the\nadministrative remedies were actually ever available to\nthat particular prisoner.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And you have in one of\nthese cases, the person has said: I didn't know who was\nthe person who said I couldn't have the operation until\nthe prison identified him.\nMR. ANDRE: That's correct. I believe\nyou're referring to either the Williams or the Walker --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes. So even if you had\na rule, a reasonable rule, that named the people that\nyou know, if you have it, that would not encompass\nsomeone? In two of these cases, the defendants -- the\nplaintiff, the prisoner, said, I didn't know who those\nguys were until they were identified.\nMR. ANDRE: Right. And to that extent the\nprison grievance system worked, because the prisoners\nprovided as much detail as they possibly could and then\nthe prison grievance system went out, conducted its\ninvestigation, broadened the universe of relevant facts,\nand then made a determination. They happened to\ndetermine that grievances were not meritorious.\nObviously, petitioners disagree with that assessment.\nThat's why they sued in Federal court.\nBut the prison grievance system worked. To\nborrow from the Third Circuit's decision in Spur v.\nGillis, a cooperative ethos between inmate and jailer\nwas achieved, because so long as the prisoner provides\nsufficient information for the grievance system to go\nout and answer any unresolved questions and so long as\nthe prison grievance system avails itself of that\nopportunity then the claim is exhausted.\nIf there are no further questions, I'd like\nto save the rest of my time for rebuttal.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Andre.\nMs. Olivieri.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF LINDA M. OLIVIERI\nON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS\nMS. OLIVIERI: Mr. Chief Justice and may it\nplease the Court:\nCongress enacted the Prison Litigation\nReform Act to deal with the flood of prisoner litigation\nthat was coming into the Federal courts, obscuring the\ntreatment for meritorious claims brought by all\nlitigants. The purpose of the act was to unburden the\ncourts from dealing with this flood of litigation that\nlargely was without merit. The purposes for the act\nwere to increase the quality of the litigation, decrease\nthe quantity of the litigation, allow the states to\naddress first the issues that the prisoners have\nproblems with and to develop an administrative record to\nfacilitate judicial screening. And all of this would\nresult in increased judicial resources for all\nlitigation that has potential merit.\nThe invigorated exhaustion requirement does\nrequire total exhaustion. The statute, the words of the\nstatute itself confirm this. The statute states: \"No\naction shall be brought until\" --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask you, what is a\ntypical administrative record that is developed in these\nproceedings? There's never a transcript, is there?\nMS. OLIVIERI: I've never seen a transcript.\nTypically it's one sheet of paper. The inmate states\nwhat the problem is, states what he did to try to\nresolve the problem before filing a grievance. And then\nthere's space at the bottom for response. Frequently\nthe response is right on that page. Sometimes the\nresponse indicates \"See attached.\" If there's a\nlengthier response there may be a separate page.\nSimilarly, if the prisoner can't put all of\nhis --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Is there normally a\nstatement of reasons for the denial of relief or are\nthey just denied in many cases?\nMS. OLIVIERI: For the most part they\nattempt to address the issue.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Are the opinions a page or\ntwo or just a sentence or two? What is typical?\nMS. OLIVIERI: Typically they are --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I'm just wondering how,\nhow much help that will give the judge later on in\nprocessing the case.\nMS. OLIVIERI: In the last 12 months there\nhave been 13,000 grievances processed by the Michigan\nDepartment of Corrections at the third step, and that's\nfor people who appeal all the way through to the third\nstep. So there are many more than that before that.\nSome of the responses can be very detailed. They can go\non for a full page typewritten single spaced. Some of\nthe responses --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: How many of the 13,000 are\nof that variety?\nMS. OLIVIERI: I haven't read all 13,000,\nbut typically the response would be about a half a dozen\nlines.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I see. And the other\nquestion: Of the 13,000 grievances, how many did result\nin litigation?\nMS. OLIVIERI: Last -- in the last year that\nended June 30th, 12 months, we had approximately 200\ncases.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: 200 out of 13,000?\nMS. OLIVIERI: Correct. In the previous\nyears we had somewhat fewer, so it's sort of going up.\nBut you know, it's between 160, 180, 200. This year\nwe're on that same pace, approximately 200.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Can you explain what the\ndisincentive or other reasons for there being just 200\nlawsuits out of the 13,000?\nMS. OLIVIERI: These 200 are ones that we\nwere served with. That doesn't include the ones that\nmay have been screened out by the courts and we were\nnever served with them.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I see.\nMS. OLIVIERI: This only includes ones where\na defendant was actually served with process.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Basically, I mean you've\nheard the question and so forth. It seems to me that my\nquestions and certainly others were based on certain\nempirical premises that might be true, might not be\ntrue. So why isn't this a question for the Rules\nCommittee? Why not go to the Rules Committee if this\nreally is a burden and so forth, rather than doing\nsomething unusual, which is to make exhaustion something\nother than an affirmative defense, to dismiss the whole\ncomplaint, which appear to be rules that reached\ndraconian results in a few cases anyway.\nMS. OLIVIERI: When it's a dismissal without\nprejudice, it's improper to characterize it as\ndraconian.\nJUSTICE BREYER: It could be, because the\nstatute of limitations could have run. So it depends.\nSometimes it is, sometimes it isn't. But my basic\nquestion here, isn't this a matter for the Rules\nCommittees rather than for the Sixth Circuit to go off\non its own?\nMS. OLIVIERI: This Court in Neitzke versus\nWilliams took a look at the previous version of the in\nforma pauperis statute and that statute allowed sua\nsponte dismissals for only two reasons, frivolous and\nmalicious cases. Under that, in that opinion, the Court\nindicated that when it's a sua sponte review for those\ntwo issues you don't get the benefit of the adversary\nprocess that's embodied in the Federal Rules of Civil\nProcedure. Congress, recognizing that even in Neitzke\nthe Court indicated that the Federal courts were being\nflooded with prison litigation, much of it meritless,\nexpanded the categories that are now subject to sua\nsponte dismissal, and those include suing someone who is\nimmune from liability or failing to state a claim.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But that doesn't include\nfailure to exhaust.\nMS. OLIVIERI: It didn't specifically\ninclude failure to exhaust.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And if you follow the\nnormal rule, that that's an affirmative defense, then,\nthen the burden would be on the prison to do just what\nit did in the Jones case. Why, why would we say, depart\nfrom the normal rule that makes exhaustion an\naffirmative defense when we know that the party best\nequipped to provide the information about exhaustion is\nthe prison, as the Jones case showed so well? They, the\nprison, had all of the grievances. They had all of the\nresponses and they presented that to the court. So the\nprisoner is less well equipped to attach those papers\nthan the prison is, so why isn't it not only traditional\nto have exhaustion as an affirmative defense, but makes\nthe most sense because the one most likely to have the\ninformation is the prison?\nMS. OLIVIERI: Congress dealt with that in\n1997e(g), the waiver of reply provision, which confirmed\nwhat the 1997e(c) dismissal provision provides. This is\nall a screening situation for the Federal district\ncourts, designed to move these cases that have been\nproven largely meritless quickly through the system\nrather than bogging the courts down --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: If Congress meant to\nreverse the ordinary burden on pleading exhaustion, why\ndidn't it put that in? It was expanding the categories\nand it included failure to state a claim, which had not\nbeen there before, and it included if you sue somebody\nwho has got immunity. But it didn't include exhaustion,\nso why should we read that in?\nMS. OLIVIERI: Well, exhaustion is the very\nfirst provision and it's --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: It's not in the\nscreening. It doesn't say you screen out for failure to\nexhaust.\nMS. OLIVIERI: It's not specifically there,\nbut the exhaustion provision is a precursor. It's a\nprecondition. You can't even get into court until\nyou've exhausted because it says no action shall be\nbrought.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But there are other\nprovisions than \"no action shall be brought.\" Take a\nstatute of limitations that reads \"No action shall be\nbrought after two years\" or something like that. There\nis no action shall be brought. Does that make it no\nlonger an affirmative defense?\nMS. OLIVIERI: The courts have interpreted\nstatutes of limitations consistently to be in the\ncategory of an affirmative defense. The problem with\nthat is this statute, the PLRA, is the new regime for\nprison litigation, not for all the litigation across the\nboard. And in the waiver of reply, the Congress\nspecifically took the defendant out of the equation,\nrequiring the court to determine whether or not the case\nhas been exhausted, whether or not the plaintiff has\nfailed to state a claim and the other criteria that are\nall in that --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, all the criteria\nare there, but failure to exhaust is not.\nMS. OLIVIERI: Not specifically, but failure\nto exhaust could be construed as a --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But last time -- and you\nsaid before the statute was there were only frivolous\nand malicious. And the court says, we can see from the\nface of this complaint that it fails to state a claim,\ntoo bad it's not a ground for automatic dismissal. So\nCongress said, yes, it should be, and put that one in.\nMS. OLIVIERI: Congress put the screening\nprovision as number one, where you cannot even bring a\ncase to court unless you have exhausted administrative\nremedies. So it's unimaginable that that would not be a\nground for sua sponte dismissal when you can't even\nbring your case until you've exhausted.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Miss Olivieri, you also\nrely on the \"no action shall be brought\" language to\njustify dismissal of the entire action, all claims, even\nthough only some of them have not been exhausted. Do\nyou have any, even a single example of the many other\ninstances where that language is used in the Federal\nstatutes? And there are many of them. Do you know any\nother case where it's been interpreted that way, so that\nclaims that are perfectly valid will not be retained,\nbut rather the whole action will be dismissed?\nMS. OLIVIERI: Habeas corpus is another\nsituation where there is a provision that says no relief\nshall be granted, no writ shall be granted, absent\nexhaustion of -- exhaustion of state court remedies.\nThere in the habeas situation, it is a little bit\ndifferent than in the PLRA -- pardon me -- because there\nis a stay in abeyance provision in habeas --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Right.\nMS. OLIVIERI: -- which was in the statute\nbefore Congress passed the PLRA, and Congress actually\ntook out the stay in abeyance provision.\nIt all serves the purpose that Congress\nintended, which was to allow the courts to quickly\nscreen these cases. If you look at e(a)(C)(1) --\n(C)(2), they give the court many options for doing what\nis most judicially prudent in that particular case to\npreserve resources.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What is the basis in the\nhabeas context for dismissing the entire habeas\napplication despite the fact that some of the claims\nhave been exhausted? Is there any statutory basis for\nthat or is it just, just judicial efficiency?\nMS. OLIVIERI: There is -- I believe it's\nunder the exhaustion requirement. The court has the\noption of dismissing the entire action -- actually, I\nbelieve there the petitioner gets the option, do they\nwant to proceed on the exhausted claims or do they want\nto drop out the unexhausted claims.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And that's not -- the\nstatute doesn't settle that. Our decisions settle that,\nright? So why should we deal with that, the two, any\ndifferently? It's not as though Congress wrote the\nstatute differently. We said you can't proceed with\nunexhausted claims, so you have a choice. Either you go\nout of the Federal court and exhaust everything -- or\neven you don't have to go out; you could use the stay in\nabeyance -- or you just lob off the unexhausted claims,\nstay in the Federal court on the ones that you have\nexhausted.\nThat's all made up by this Court. So why\nshould the Court react differently in the PLRA than it\ndid? Why should it fill those gaps differently than it\ndid in habeas?\nMS. OLIVIERI: I think because Congress did\nrevoke the stay in abeyance provision in the PLRA.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But your answer was it\nshouldn't, I think. I think she's making your argument\nfor you.\nMS. OLIVIERI: Pardon me?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I think she is saying that\nwe should treat this area the same way we treat habeas,\nso that the whole case should be dismissed rather than\njust the individual claims, which is what I think you\nwant; isn't it?\nMS. OLIVIERI: Yes, that is my argument,\nyes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. Well, don't fight\nit.\nMS. OLIVIERI: Okay. I was suggesting that\nin habeas it is the prisoner's option to say --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I was suggesting that in\nhabeas it is the prisoner's option to say I don't want\nthe whole case dismissed. I will amend my petition so\nthat the court will have, will retain the exhausted\nclaims. You are saying not like habeas, I don't want it\nto be like habeas, because if it were like habeas, the\nprisoner would have the option to stay in the federal\ncourt as long as he lopped off the unexhausted claims.\nYou don't want it. You don't want it to be like habeas?\nMS. OLIVIERI: I don't want the prisoner to\nbe allowed to choose to lop off the unexhausted claims,\nthat is true, or to amend, to delete them, because then\nthere is absolutely no incentive for the prisoner to\nimprove the quality of the litigation by stopping and\nthinking, being careful to exhaust all his claims, and\nbeing careful to plead only claims that are exhaustive.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The same arguments apply in\nhabeas, don't they?\nMS. OLIVIERI: But in habeas you have the\nstay and abeyance provision that was specifically\nremoved --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Not if you had your way.\nMS. OLIVIERI: Remove -- well --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I think you're making an\nargument that it would preclude that too.\nMS. OLIVIERI: Right.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So it seems to me that if\nwe accept your response to Justice Ginsburg, we've got\nto go back and to the extent that we can do anything\nabout it, we'd better toughen up habeas so that these\nthings get thrown out more readily.\nMS. OLIVIERI: Habeas does deal with a\nperson's liberty whereas the PLRA is simply dealing with\npeople basically for the most part trying to get some\nsort of relief, either injunctive or monetary relief,\nthat does not deal with their basic freedom. So in that\nrespect --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: One reason to\nrequire total exhaustion is because, I would assume the\nprisoner may get sufficient relief if the claims are\nexhausted, that he doesn't feel the need to go forward\nwith litigation. But I guess that's only true if the\nexhausted claims are still alive, and how many, when\nwe're talking about unexhausted claims, are those\ntypically claims that are not going to be available or\nare they claims that may generate relief once there is\nexhaustion?\nMS. OLIVIERI: It could be -- I mean, it's\nobviously both. I mean, there are claims that are\npartially exhausted when the inmate files the lawsuit.\nHe may finish exhausting and get the relief that he's\nlooking for without ever pursuing the case in federal\ncourt.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And then sometimes it's\nimpossible to complete the exhaustion. I assume in some\ncases that the time limit for the last appeal will have\nexpired, right?\nMS. OLIVIERI: That can also be the case,\nand under Woodford versus Ngo, now that they have to do\nproper exhaustion, there will be more of those cases\nwhere it probably, there wouldn't be anything left to do\nafter it's dismissed except for the plaintiff to be the\none to go through the maybe 20 claimed complaints and\ncall out the claims that are not exhausted, rather than\nputting that burden on the court, which is contrary to\nCongress's purpose, to streamline this system.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask you about,\nthere's another question you haven't really touched on\nyet, the requirement that the prisoner name every\ndefendant that he intends to sue in the exhausting, in\nthe internal procedure. I'd just like a little help on\njust exactly what happens. The prisoner doesn't get the\nkind of medical care he thinks he's entitled to, and he\nonly knows it because either the low level person says\nno, the doctors said you can't have it. And he brings a\nproceeding, an informal administrative proceeding, and\nthey deny relief. And then later on when he wants to\nsue, his lawyer happens to find out the name of the\ndoctor who was involved, and there are several levels of\nauthority making the decision. Does he have to start\nall over again to name those people, or what does he do?\nMS. OLIVIERI: Medical care is -- well, for\none thing, prisoners do have counselors, and so if\nthey're not sure who is responsible for something,\nthat's one of the things that they're supposed to do is\ntalk to their counselor to find out. You know, I'm\nhaving this problem, I'm not getting surgery, why am I\nnot getting surgery, who do I talk to, who do I complain\nto. So that's one way to resolve the problem.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And what if he does talk\nto the prison guard and the guard says I don't know, I\ndon't know who's responsible for that decision, that's\nin the warden's office, or something like that. What\nis the prisoner supposed to do?\nMS. OLIVIERI: If the prisoner makes inquiry\nand just simply can't find out who it is, then he should\nstate that in his grievance and indicate that somebody\nin the medical department is denying me the surgery.\nYou know, I talked to Dr. So and So, he's recommended\nthat I get it, somebody is saying no, I haven't been\nable to find out who that is. And likely during the\ngrievance process, he will find out who it is, because\none of the responses will probably say that.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: What if he doesn't? One\nof his grievances is nobody told me. Is he out of luck\nthere? And I think there may well be situations in\nwhich prisoners don't have complete access to all the\nfacts that go into a decision denying them medical care,\nfor example, or say a prisoner has a religious problem\nand can't get the diet he wants, or something like that.\nBut before he can sue, under your view if I understand\nit, he has to find out so he can name the people in his\nadministrative complaint.\nMS. OLIVIERI: He has to make a good faith\nattempt to find out. And if he really, you know, if he\nsays I've asked my counselor, he is not able to provide\nme with that information, then he will get a response on\nthe grievance.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What is the purpose of\nthat requirement? As long as he has made known in the\nadministrative proceeding what his problem it, and they\nhave had a chance to investigate it and determine\nwhether it has merit or not, why should he have to name\nthe individuals who made the decision in order, before\nhe can sue them when he later finds out who they are?\nMS. OLIVIERI: That goes back to 1997e(g),\nthe waiver of reply, where it says that no defendant can\nbe made to respond to the complaint unless the court can\ncertify that the prisoner has a reasonable opportunity\nto prevail on the merits. It talks about defendants\nthere. Also, you get a case like Mr. --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, no, it's standard\nlaw of agency. It doesn't make any difference. The\nprisoner is denied his rights. As Justice Stevens said,\nthere may be three or four different people who\nconcurred. Do your rules say that if he can't find out\nwith reasonable efforts that he doesn't need to, or does\nthe Sixth Circuit rules say that the delegation of the\nnames is not required?\nMS. OLIVIERI: The Sixth Circuit rule\nbasically says name or identify. And for instance, here\nwith respect to Mr. Jones, he didn't name the\nclassification director. He used the title. Nobody had\nanything negative to say about that. We know you're\ntalking about the classification director. It's\nMr. Morrison. We've only got one, not a problem. The\nSixth Circuit rule is basically name or identify, so if\nyou're going to identify --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Why is it that the Sixth\nCircuit rule requires the identification, for complete\nexhaustion requires the identification to be made at the\nfirst stage?\nMS. OLIVIERI: The Sixth Circuit rule does\nrequire that.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So to make sure I\nunderstand this, in a case, let's say at stage one he\nnames Dr. X. And for whatever reason in the course of\nthe response perhaps, he learned that not only was Dr. X\ninvolved but Dr. Y was involved in that decision. So if\nhe is denied relief at stage two, he says X and Y, and\nhe identifies X and why all the way through. He gets\nnothing satisfactory to him, so he goes in to Federal\ncourt. Is it correct that under the Sixth Circuit rule\nthey would say you have not completely exhausted because\nat stage one you did not mention Y? Is that correct?\nMS. OLIVIERI: The Sixth Circuit probably\nwould say that that he would be out of luck with respect\nto Y.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: What justification is there\nfor that? I mean, for two stages through the prison\nadministrative process, Y has been identified. The\nprison has taken action on the merits on the assumption\nthat Y is in fact at least an allegedly responsible\nparty. What reason is there in a Federal court to say\nthat the exhaustion is incomplete because he didn't\nmention Y back at stage one?\nMS. OLIVIERI: The Sixth Circuit adopted\nthat rule probably in a case like the Walton case here,\nwhere Mr. Walton had a problem with his slot restriction\nand said, you know, Deputy Warden Bobo put this\nrestriction on me. It goes through the grievance\nprocess and they say Bobo didn't put that on you, Gearin\nput it on you. That's at step one. They give that\nresponse. He goes then into court after exhausting two\nor three steps, still saying, you know, they're\ndiscriminating against me based on race with the slot\nrestrictions.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yeah, but that wasn't my\nhypo. As I understand it, in that case he keeps going\nafter Bobo, period. And in my case at stage two, having\nlearned something, he identifies Y. And I -- so I don't\nsee the justification, what is the justification?\nMS. OLIVIERI: I think I was probably giving\ntoo much explanation, but I think from my understanding\nof how this should operate, he is all right in that case\nto sue Mr. Gearin, who actually did put the slot\nrestriction on him, and he had the wrong name at step\none. No problem. We got the right name at step two or,\nexcuse me, at the end of step one. And he pursues it?\nI think he's got a good claim against Mr. Gearin. The\nSixth Circuit may not think that's true.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: In my case, you said you\nunderstood that the Sixth Circuit would say that\nalthough he identified X and Y in stage two and at stage\nthree, and there had been merit for adjudication at\nthose stages, understanding who the named respondents\nwere, the Sixth Circuit would nonetheless say you had\nfailed to exhaust because back at stage A you mentioned\nX but not Y. What is the justification, if that is\nstill your answer, what could the justification for that\nbe?\nMS. OLIVIERI: I don't think the Sixth\nCircuit had that type of case in front of them when they\nissued --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But that apparently, if I\nunderstand your answer, is what the result would be.\nAnd is there -- and I don't want to, you know, make it\nhard for you. I think you're having a hard time finding\na justification for that result and I certainly can't\nfind one. Can you think of any?\nMS. OLIVIERI: I'm saying there is none.\nI'm saying he's got a good claim against Mr. Gearin.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, how about Y in my\nexample?\nMS. OLIVIERI: Pardon me?\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Does he have a good claim\nagainst Y?\nMS. OLIVIERI: Y?\nJUSTICE SOUTER: In the Federal court in my\nhypo --\nMS. OLIVIERI: Okay. He named X, and now -\nJUSTICE BREYER: I think Y is Mr. Gearin.\nMS. OLIVIERI: Y is Mr. Gearin, yes.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.\nMS. OLIVIERI: So he's got a claim against\nY.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Even though the Sixth\nCircuit would throw it out for failure to exhaust.\nMS. OLIVIERI: I disagree with the Sixth\nCircuit on that, but I don't disagree with the Sixth\nCircuit in that when he actually got to court, he sued\nfour other people who were never mentioned in any\ngrievance by anybody.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: How about Jones, who\nreally did not know who was the doctor who said no\nsurgery? He didn't know and then the prison told him.\nAnd he comes to the court, he says thanks, prison, for\ntelling me, and so he names that person in his\ncomplaint. The Sixth Circuit said that's no good, he\ndidn't put it in his initial complaint. He had only 15\ndays to find out and he didn't find out.\nMS. OLIVIERI: I'm agreeing with you that\nthe Sixth Circuit, both that the Sixth Circuit would say\nthat that won't fly, and that in fact it should fly.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So Jones did properly\nexhaust, then, if you just made that confession, then\nJones properly exhausted?\nMS. OLIVIERI: Jones properly exhausted\nagainst the doctor who actually denied the medical\ntreatment, denied the surgery. Yes. But Jones never\nserved, unfortunately, that particular doctor,\nDr. Cranstall.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, you've\nmentioned in your brief that there has been a change in\nthe Michigan grievance policy with respect to naming\nindividuals. What is the consequence of that change for\nour ability to address that claim?\nMS. OLIVIERI: It will, it will be the same\nbasic philosophy that I've been stating here. I mean,\nit's going to be a name or identify. Tell us who you've\ngot a problem with. Don't tell us you have a problem\nwith one person and then go into court and sue six other\npeople who may be the people who actually responded to\nthe grievance, because MDOC didn't know that you had a\nproblem with this person.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I thought one of the\nobjections to the Sixth Circuit rule from your friend\nwas that this requirement of naming the individuals came\nout of thin air. And now we have that requirement\narticulated in the grievance policy. Does that make a\ndifference?\nMS. OLIVIERI: It does make a difference in\nproper exhaustion.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: It's not an absolute\npolicy, though. It isn't that if you haven't named him\nin the first administrative step, you can't name him in\nthe complaint. That's not Michigan's new policy.\nMS. OLIVIERI: Michigan doesn't say you have\nto name him at the first step. It says when you file\nyour grievance, you know, name --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Isn't there an exception\nwhen you couldn't find out?\nMS. OLIVIERI: And if they say they can't\nfind out, and they've made reasonable inquiry, you know,\nthere's somebody at the top of the chain of the medical,\nthat's understandable that they may not know, because\nthey may have never seen Dr. Pramstaller.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Did the Sixth\nCircuit have the current Michigan policy before them\nwhen they made their decision?\nMS. OLIVIERI: Not on these three cases, no.\nIt was the previous policy which indicated that the\ninmate had to be as specific, basically be as specific\nas possible, something along those lines.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I take it from your answer\nto Justice Ginsburg that back in my Dr. X, Dr. Y case,\nunder the new policy if they got to stage 2 and Y was\nidentified, that Michigan would process the complaint?\nMS. OLIVIERI: We would process the\ngrievance, absolutely.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: The grievance.\nMS. OLIVIER: Yes. Yes. Finally, I would\nask the Court to keep in mind that the entire purpose of\nthe Prison Litigation Reform Act is to relieve the\ncourts of the burden and the screening process that's\nset in place by this statute allows the Court many\noptions.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Now you say the primary\npurpose is to relieve the courts of the burden rather\nthan determine whether there is merits to the\ngrievances?\nMS. OLIVIERI: The, the purpose of the\nPrison Litigation Reform Act was to relieve --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Was to reduce the volume\nof litigation, period?\nMS. OLIVIERI: To reduce the volume to\nprovide more --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Wasn't there any interest\nin determining whether the complaints have merit? I\nmean, I think you must be interested in getting rid of\n11,000 complaints and reducing them down to 200. I\nwould think that's more important than saving the court\nsome time. There must be, you must have some interest\nin determining whether the complaints have merit.\nMS. OLIVIERI: Well, we do have an interest.\nWe respond to every one of those in three steps, and we\nnever end up in litigation for the most part so the\ngrievance process works totally outside of what\nlitigation goes on. It does resolve complaints. But\nthe Prison Litigation Reform Act allows the court to\neither --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But these rules that are\nchallenged here are primarily to benefit the courts, not\nthe profits-- the process.\nMS. OLIVIERI: They are to, to benefit the\ncourts by taking resources that had previously been\nspent on meritless cases and spending those instead on\ncases with merit, to efficiently screen these cases so\nthat the courts are not spending a lot of time asking us\nfor responses and so forth. If it's a failure to state\na claim the case can be dismissed right, there all\nwithout prejudice. There is nothing draconian here.\nThey can be rebrought.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel.\nMS. OLIVIERI: Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Andre, you have\nfive minute remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JEAN-CLAUDE ANDRE,\nON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS\nMR. ANDRE: Justice Ginsburg, you asked\nearlier about who is better equipped to plead and show\nexhaustion. It's certainly our position that the\nMichigan Department of Corrections or prison grievance\nadministrators are absolutely better equipped to do so.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How is that? The\nprisoner is the one who presumably knows best whether or\nnot he filed a grievance or not.\nMR. ANDRE: The prisoner may know best\nwhether or not he or she filed a grievance and whether\nor not he appealed. The prisoner may not know precise\ndates on which he or she did so or have copies of the\ngrievances anymore. This really kind of brings the\nheightened pleading rule, not just whether it's just\naffirmative defense or a general pleading rule, to the\nfore. Prisoners are prisoners. They get moved around,\nthey get put in administrative segregation; they are\nsubject to repeat searches; they have great difficulty\nin maintaining possession of their belongings. On the\nother hand the Michigan Department of Corrections keeps\ncopies of all the grievances, denials and appeals.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: This seems to me to\nbe a stretch to say that the prison, which has how many\nprisoners under their jurisdiction, is in a better\nposition to know in individual cases, an individual\nprisoner, what this prisoner did or didn't do with\nrespect to the grievance process. Surely the prisoner\nis in the best position. He knows what he did or at\nleast what he is going to allege.\nMR. ANDRE: He may be able to aver generally\nbut with specificity there are many cases in which he\nwon't be able to. But the Michigan Department of\nCorrections' policy directive makes clear that it has to\nmaintain these records for future FOIA requests, and in\nmany institutions it has to track them in a computer.\nAnd as Justice Ginsburg pointed out, in the Jones case,\nthey were quite able to bring forward the proof of\nexhaustion that would satisfy, that would have satisfied\nthe court that Jones had exhausted his administrative\nremedies.\nJones gets, just got thrown out of court,\nessentially, in a game of \"gotcha,\" because he hadn't\nattached his complaint in the first instance. I think\nmost importantly, from a judicial efficiency standpoint,\nmaking exhaustion an affirmative defense makes sense.\nThat means that the lawyers in the state attorney's\ngeneral, in the state, in the office of the state's\nattorneys general, are going to be able to put forward\nthe best arguments as to why a claim is or is not\nexhausted.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It requires, it requires\nresponse in all the cases, and as this subsection G\nindicates, part of the purpose of the act was to\neliminate the necessity of responding to frivolous\ncomplaints. Why -- why, you know, you have to go\nthrough the requesting a response from the government,\nwhen in fact there is nothing to this complaint because\nthere has never been any exhaustion.\nMR. ANDRE: But to go back to Justice\nGinsburg's point earlier Congress could have included\nunexhausted claims among those types of claims that the\ncourt could screen out and dismiss or among those claims\nfor which a court could --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's a different\nargument. But I mean, don't tell me that it isn't more\nefficient to have the prisoner say at the outset whether\nit's exhausted or not. It certainly is.\nMR. ANDRE: Or again, it may be more\nefficient to have them aver generally, but as far as\nhaving a prisoner comply with a heightened pleading\nrequirement, we don't think that that makes sense. We\nare talking, again we are talking about prisoners here.\nJUSTICE ALITO: If it's an affirmative\ndefense doesn't that mean that the prisoner is going to\nhave to file, and the individuals defendants are going\nto have to file an answer in every case and assert all\nof their defenses?\nMR. ANDRE: Either --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Just respond, even if there\nis nonfrivolous, nonexhaustion argument that can be\nmade, they are going to have to go through all of that\nin every instance?\nMS. OLIVIERI: They would have to file an\nanswer and motion to dismiss raising whatever\naffirmative defense they want to raise, but at least it\ngives them a choice and gives them the opportunity to\nframe this argument as opposed to putting it on, putting\nthat burden on the court. Moreover if the court were to\nadopt respondents' reading of the screening provisions,\nthose screening provisions would swallow up every single\naffirmative defense enumerated in the Federal rules, and\nalso those not enumerated.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: With respect, with\nrespect to the naming of the individuals, is that claim\nmoot because of the change in the policy?\nMR. ANDRE: Oh, not at all. I mean, I can't\nsee how, how respondents could argue that --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I thought your main\nargument before was they invented this requirement\nwithout any basis, but now it's an actual requirement in\nthe grievance procedure.\nMR. ANDRE: Right, but it wasn't when these\nclaims were decided. And that's where I think Sims v.\nApfel comes into play. Under Justice Thomas' plurality\nopinion, the key is looking at kind of the nature of the\nproceedings and if it's informal and accusatorial as\nopposed to adversarial, then a court cannot impose a\nrequirement beyond that which the agency itself required\nat the time that the claims were before the agency.\nUnder Justice O'Connor's concurrence, she\nwas concerned about fair notice, and certainly here in\nthese cases petitioners Williams and Walton didn't have\nfair notice that a year and a half later the State of\nMichigan, after going through the entire grievance\nprocedure and never relying on their failure to be\nsufficiently specific, can then come into Federal court\nand say, aha --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Future prisoners now\ndo have fair notice because the grievance procedure says\nname the individuals, dates, names, places, names of all\nthose all involved.\nMR. ANDRE: Yes, they would, they would.\nAnd again, there would certainly be constraints to too\nrigid enforcement of that particular provision.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Is the no leeway built\ninto the rule itself, that if you don't know --\nMR. ANDRE: I'm sorry. I didn't --\nJUSTICE GINSBERG: Isn't there -- the\ncurrent rule, isn't there some leeway for cases where\nthe prisoner simply doesn't know the names?\nMR. ANDRE: I'm not aware of any, Justice\nGinsburg.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
