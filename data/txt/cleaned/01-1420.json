        "content": "(11:02 a.m.)\nJUSTICE STEVENS: We will hear argument in No.\n01-1420, Washington State Department of Social Services\nagainst the Guardianship Estate of Daniel Keffeler.\nGeneral -- is it Gregoire or Gregory?\nORAL ARGUMENT OF CHRISTINE O. GREGOIRE\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMS. GREGOIRE: Gregoire.\nQUESTION: Gregoire. Thank you.\nMS. GREGOIRE: Justice Stevens, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe question presented in this case is whether a\nrepresentative payee, appointed by the commissioner of\nSocial Security, violates the anti-alienation provision of\n42 U.S.C., section 407(a), when it uses Social Security\nbenefits to pay for the beneficiary's current maintenance.\nThe plain text of section 407(a) answers this\nquestion, and the answer is no.\nSection 407(a) provides that benefits are not\nsubject to execution, levy, attachment, garnishment, or\nother legal process. The department here does not use\ncompulsory legal process to obtain benefits. Instead, the\ndepartment is appointed representative payee by the\ncommissioner, pursuant to 42 U.S.C., section 405(j), and\nas payee, the department is under the supervision of the\ncommissioner and uses the benefits to pay for the current\nmaintenance of the beneficiary in accordance with the\nSocial Security regulations.\nIn short, when looking at the statutes as a\nwhole, 407(a) does not prohibit that which is expressly\nauthorized by 405(j). The purpose of 407(a) is to ensure\nthat Social Security benefits are available to pay the\nbeneficiary's current maintenance by preventing creditors\nfrom taking those benefits. Legal process, as referenced\nin 407(a), is the means by which a court, agency, or\nofficial authorized by -- by law compels compliance with\nits demands. It is compulsory legal process.\nHere there is no legal process. The\nrepresentative payee here stands in the shoes of the\nbeneficiary, sharing in the cost of care, consistent with\nthe Social Security regulations.\nQUESTION: Can a set-off ever be legal process?\nSuppose there were a tax indebtedness by the beneficiary.\nCould the State just under -- assuming that its set-off\nprinciples allowed it, could the State simply take some of\nthe beneficiary's money from the Social Security and set\nit off against the tax debt?\nMS. GREGOIRE: If -- the violation of 407(a)\ncomes in -- comes into play when there's a legal process\nthat actually attaches to those Social Security benefits.\nQUESTION: So you would say there's no 407\nviolation in that event.\nMS. GREGOIRE: Correct.\nQUESTION: Although I presume there would be a\ncause of action against the State for -- for not behaving\nproperly as the -- what -- what is the -- the --\nMS. GREGOIRE: Representative payee?\nQUESTION: As the representative payee within\nthat --\nMS. GREGOIRE: I believe that's true, Justice\nScalia. The questions that have been presented here by --\nby the respondents are 405(j) questions as to whether the\nrepresentative payee acted accordingly within their\npurview.\nSecurity regulations. In this particular instance, the\ndepartment is duly recognized as a representative payee\nsubject to supervision, having to submit constant reports\nand annual reports and accounting system, and there are\naudits that have been performed on the department. It is\nacting in accordance with 405(j) as rep payee.\nQUESTION: And why -- why is 405(j) not at issue\nhere?\nMS. GREGOIRE: Well --\nQUESTION: Because those points are raised, of\ncourse, in the -- in your opponent's brief.\nMS. GREGOIRE: Yes, Your Honor, but if you -- if\nyou look at the complaint in this particular case by -- by\nthe respondent, if you look at the certification of the\nclass that's present here, if you look at the holding\nbelow, in every instance the question presented is whether\na representative payee duly appointed can use the benefits\nfor the cost of care of the beneficiary. We think the\nplain text of 407(a) says the answer is there is no\nviolation whatsoever.\nQUESTION: General Gregoire, I'd like to just\nfind out if -- let's say we accept your argument this is\nnot a 407 case, and then the question is put, but there\nare alleged misappropriations here. For example, there's\nsome suggestion of double dipping and there's some other\nthings which may or may not be right. I don't know that\nthere is such a thing as a right of any individual to go\nafter the representative payee. I thought that was\nsomething within the Social Security regs. I thought I\nheard you say, oh, yes, but that's not a 407 claim. That\nwould be a 405 claim. And I was not aware that there is\nsuch a thing apart from the administrative process. Is\nthere some right to sue eventually in court under 405?\nMS. GREGOIRE: What the Social Security Act\nprovides is one of two things. It can be done by the\ncommissioner by the removal of the representative payee if\nthey have violated. It can be done by a court. But the\nremedy, if -- even if done by a court, is back to the\ncommissioner to remove the representative payee and\nappoint one that would act in -- in accordance with the\nregulations.\nHere, while there are allegations --\nQUESTION: And who -- who can invoke the court's\nassistance? The --\nMS. GREGOIRE: An individual, the -- the\nbeneficiary could.\nQUESTION: The beneficiary can?\nMS. GREGOIRE: Yes.\nBut here, all of those allegations, one, are not\ncontained within the holding below, but most importantly,\nthere is no record to find any violation of 405(j) in this\ncase whatsoever. To the contrary. The department here\nhas acted absolutely consistent with the Social --\nQUESTION: May I ask you this question related\nto that? Do you agree with the position asserted in the\ndissent, with the State court?\nMS. GREGOIRE: We -- we do not, Your Honor. We\nbelieve the -- the dissent is wrong on -- on two bases.\nOne, the -- the court below suggested that there was some\nuse of -- of benefits for past debt --\nQUESTION: Right.\nMS. GREGOIRE: -- when in fact there -- that is\nnot the case here and there is no finding to that effect\nby the lower court.\nQUESTION: No finding. Were there allegations\nto that effect?\nMS. GREGOIRE: Only after the -- the remand\nand -- and the supplemental brief that was submitted in\nthe State supreme court.\nBut there -- in this particular case, what\nhappens, by way of clarification, is when the State of\nWashington gets a lump sum check for an individual whose\nSSI, Social Security Title XVI application has been\npending, they will then use that check to pay current\nmaintenance for those months for which the child was\ndeemed eligible for SSI and was receiving foster care up\nto a maximum of 6 months. That is considered current\nmaintenance, not past maintenance. We think the -- the\nconcurring opinion was confused by that.\nSecondly, the concurring opinion says, you --\nQUESTION: Excuse me. Why -- why do you say it\nis considered current and not past? You -- you just\ndecide 6 months is a reasonable currency criterion?\nMS. GREGOIRE: No.\nQUESTION: Or is it a regulation or what?\nMS. GREGOIRE: It is. It is, Your Honor.\nJustice Scalia, what the Social Security regulations put\nin place with respect to Title XVI benefits, SSI, that\nanything beyond 6 months by Social Security itself is put\ninto an account and allowed to accumulate interest. It\ncannot be used for the current maintenance of the child.\nAnd the second basis -- Justice Stevens, the\nsecond basis that we think was wrong in -- in the\nconcurring opinion is where she finds that you have to\nlook at the extras for the child first, over and above\ncurrent maintenance, and that we submit to you is in --\ncontrary to the Federal regulations themselves, 20 C.F.R.\n404.2040, which expressly provides that you look first to\nthe current maintenance. That's the very purpose behind\nboth Title II and Title XVI, first to the current\nmaintenance, and then you guess -- within the broad\ndiscretion accorded a representative payee, you may look\nto see if there are extras to which those monies could be\nspent.\nHere, the Department of Social and Health\nServices uses the benefits for both, and the record\nverifies that.\nBut let me bring to the Court's attention what\nwe're talking about here. We're talking about children\nwho arrive in the State's custody through a juvenile court\nproceeding, having been abandoned, abused, or neglected.\nThey are subject to the jurisdiction of the juvenile\ncourt, and then those children are assessed by an\nindividual service plan as to what their needs are. And\nwhat happens when that assessment takes place is their\nneeds are being met by the department.\nIn fact, the average payment for foster care for\na SSI child is $1,776. The average amount that an SSI\nbenefit would be is something short of $500. And the base\nfoster care amount is something short of $500. The fact\nis the special needs of these children are being met so\ntheir lives can be turned around, they can go back out and\nbe productive members of society --\nQUESTION: Well, I -- I think we're all\ninterested in the needs of the children.\nIn some cases, though, I take it that the --\nthat the Social Security payments are being applied to\nreimburse the State for something the child would get for\nfree anyway.\nMS. GREGOIRE: We don't submit, Your Honor -- we\nthink that's wrong. The fact that these children are --\nare getting foster care doesn't mean it's free. In fact,\nthe expectation of both Social Security --\nQUESTION: Well, I mean free in the sense that\nthe State would pay for it anyway.\nMS. GREGOIRE: Your Honor, there is an\nexpectation in State law and an expectation in the Social\nSecurity Act that -- that what this money is to be used\nfor is the current maintenance of the child. What would\nbe the difference if we were to submit that it's free in\nthe home of a parent? A parent surely -- and under\nWashington State law -- absolutely is obligated to pay for\nthe child's care and maintenance. Are we then to suggest\nthat anytime a child in the home of a parent gets SSA or\nSSI, it can't be used for current maintenance because the\nparent has to use their own funds for that purpose?\nQUESTION: Well, but we're talking about the --\nthe State has a certain -- has assumed a certain\nobligation and made certain payments. And in the event\nthe representative payee is someone other than the State,\nthe State is going to pay -- pay those benefits and -- and\nthe SSI will be available for other purposes. So it's --\nit's not necessarily always in the best interest for the\nchild.\nMS. GREGOIRE: But, Justice Kennedy, that would\nbe -- that would be the case with a parent. A parent is\nobligated to pay for the current maintenance of the child.\nDoes that mean they can never use their SSA or SSI benefit\nfor the child for the current maintenance of the child?\nWe think not. Consistent with the very purpose of the\nSocial Security Act, is -- these monies are to ensure that\nthat child gets a minimum income to pay for their current\nmaintenance. The State shouldn't be treated any different\nhere than a parent would be treated.\nQUESTION: General Gregoire, can I ask you about\nthe person who started all this? As I understand it, the\n-- the grandmother that the State was trying to displace\nas representative payee refused to pay anything for the\nchild's current maintenance. She was putting it away in a\nkitty for the child's college education. And I suppose\nher theory was the State is going to pick up the tab\nanyway, so I think the best use for these Social Security\nbenefits is to put them in a bank account so one day he\ncan go to college.\nIs -- and I understand there were two attempts\nto replace her because she was not spending the money on\ncurrent maintenance.\nWhen the -- when the social service agency is\nnot the representative payee but a relative who doesn't\nhave custody is, is there any means of getting those\nSocial Security benefits used for the current maintenance?\nMS. GREGOIRE: Not by legal process, Justice\nGinsburg, which was a lesson learned by the grandmother,\nWanda Pierce, in this case. The department wrongfully\nattempted to get at the Social Security benefits by legal\nprocess. That's why there is no appeal of the specific\nDanny Keffeler case.\nQUESTION: Why is it wrong? I mean, this money\nis there to pay for the child's care and maintenance. If\nthe grandmother won't pay it, why couldn't the State go to\nHHS and say, appoint us?\nMS. GREGOIRE: Well, you --\nQUESTION: Why wouldn't they do it?\nMS. GREGOIRE: You could. The issue is a 405(j)\nissue. The issue is whether that person should be paying\nfor the current maintenance of the child.\nQUESTION: Why shouldn't they?\nMS. GREGOIRE: They should. But what happened\nin this particular case is Washington State has a specific\nstatutory provision that says if the child has a guardian,\nthe State cannot go in there and then ask to be\nrepresentative payee. So there's a violation of State\nlaw.\nQUESTION: Oh, I see. So there's a\nparticular -- a particular State law --\nMS. GREGOIRE: Correct.\nQUESTION: -- that stopped that.\nMS. GREGOIRE: Correct.\nQUESTION: Okay. So --\nQUESTION: Is that the basis on which the ALJ\nruled? I thought that was within the Social Security\nstructure.\nMS. GREGOIRE: The ALJ in the case of Danny\nKeffeler said that there was no finding that she had\nwrongfully used the benefits, but went on to suggest at\nthe end that the State hadn't done anything like submit a\nbill to her showing an expectation that she was\nresponsible to provide for the benefit and care of this\nchild.\nQUESTION: But that wasn't under State law, was\nit? That was -- that was a Federal --\nMS. GREGOIRE: That's correct, Justice Ginsburg.\nThe point being --\nQUESTION: Then that's what creates the problem\nbecause if you have a State law and the grandmother just\nsays, no, I'm not going to pay this money, which I would\nhave thought was earmarked for that purpose, pretty much,\nand they won't do it, and then you say, okay, appoint us,\nand the State says, no, we -- we cannot appoint ourselves,\nand then you say to the grandmother, well, pay us, well,\nthen you really are a creditor in respect to that.\nMS. GREGOIRE: Well -- and specifically what\nhappened in the case of Danny Keffeler, when the State\nattempted legal process against Wanda Pierce, that was\nwrong. That was a violation of 407(a) --\nQUESTION: And you're in an anomalous situation,\naren't you? I mean, here -- here you have -- if you -- if\nyou -- you're a creditor in respect to the grandmother who\nwon't pay. I -- I don't quite see how to work it out.\nThere's going to be an anomaly no matter what you do.\nYou're a creditor in respect to the grandmother, so you\ncan't force the parents to pay. And you can't go and ask\nHHS to appoint you because of the State law. And then\nthere you are in those instances where you did manage to\nget yourself appointed, and you're now trying to reach a\ndifferent result than would be there in the other cases.\nMS. GREGOIRE: But Justice Breyer, the remedy is\nthe State could go to the Social Security Administration\nand ask them to consider an alternative representative\npayee for the child in this case because Wanda Pierce was\nnot providing for the current maintenance of the child as\nwe believe she should.\nWe believe --\nQUESTION: And she might have if she had to care\nfor the child. If she -- if the representative payee --\nif the child is in the custody of the representative\npayee, then the representative payee has to pay for the\nchild.\nMS. GREGOIRE: Under State law, we believe the\nrepresentative payee should pay for the current\nmaintenance of the child whether in the custody of that\nindividual or not. The remedy, however, is not by legal\nprocess 407(a), but the remedy is 405(j) process by going\nto the Social Security Administration and asking --\nQUESTION: Which gives it -- there's no role for\nthe State court in that.\nMS. GREGOIRE: Correct.\nQUESTION: In that 405(j) process. It's all\nFederal.\nMS. GREGOIRE: That's correct.\nAnd with that --\nQUESTION: And under 405(j), when you go to the\nSocial Security Administration, its options are what?\nMS. GREGOIRE: To remove that individual as a\nrepresentative payee and appoint another.\nQUESTION: Put you in.\nMS. GREGOIRE: If -- unless we have a State law,\nas I indicated in the specific case of Danny Keffeler,\nwould not allow us because she was named guardian. That's\ncorrect, Your Honor.\nWith that, I would like to reserve my remaining\ntime for rebuttal.\nQUESTION: Very well. Thank you.\nMs. Millett.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF PATRICIA A. MILLETT\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES\nAS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS\nMS. MILLETT: Justice Stevens, and may it please\nthe Court:\nThere is no question that the use of Social\nSecurity benefits to pay for current maintenance needs by\na beneficiary or by a parent as representative payee is\npermitted under the Social Security Act. There is no\nreason that the identical use of funds would suddenly\nbecome a prohibited alienation of Social Security benefits\njust because it's done by a State as representative payee.\nThe anti-alienation provision of the Social Security Act\nprohibits the use of judicial processes or similar\ncoercive processes to divert funds away from meeting the\nneeds of a beneficiary.\nor the purpose of the anti-alienation provision that\nsupports the Washington Supreme Court's conclusion that it\nprohibits particular types of payments and expenditures of\nfunds that the representative payee provision of the\nstatute specifically permits.\nAnd that is because -- it's very important to\nunderstand that when a State serves as a representative\npayee, it does not receive funds, and it does not spend\nfunds as an interposing claimant or creditor. Instead,\nunder the Social Security program, it steps into the shoes\nof the beneficiary. It cannot act unilaterally. It has\nto be appointed by the commissioner and, once appointed,\nmust act pursuant to the commissioner's direction,\nsupervision, and control.\nQUESTION: Is -- is the issue of whether there\nwas compliance with section 405(j) properly before us, do\nyou think?\nMS. MILLETT: No, it is not, Justice O'Connor.\nThe question presented is limited to the violation of the\nanti-alienation provision 407(a). The complaint in this\ncase is limited to 407(a). If you look at the joint\nappendix, page 118, specifically the -- the claim for\nrelief, the aforesaid actions violate 42 U.S.C. 407, no\nallegation of violating 405. And there would be no basis,\nI don't think, for the class action.\nallegations were based on this general rule of the 407\nviolation. If there's particular allegations of misuse in\nparticular cases for particular children, that would be a\nmisuse claim. It should first be brought to the Social\nSecurity Administration.\nQUESTION: Do -- do beneficiaries of SSI funds\nhave a Federal right that they can enforce through a\nsection 1983 action to have the representative payee act\nin their best interests?\nMS. MILLETT: What they would do is bring --\nbring a complaint. If you're -- if you're a beneficiary\nand you're dissatisfied with the way your payee is\nspending your money --\nQUESTION: Right.\nMS. MILLETT: -- then you can bring a complaint\nwith the Social Security --\nQUESTION: Would there be alternatively some\nlawsuit open --\nMS. MILLETT: They -- I think --\nQUESTION: -- under 1983?\nMS. MILLETT: I'm not sure whether under 1983,\nbut you could bring certainly a State law conversion out\n-- suit against someone if you thought that they were\nmisapplying your funds. And -- and I assume you're\ntalking about 1983 because we're talking about the State\nas --\nQUESTION: Right.\nMS. MILLETT: -- payee, but the vast majority of\nrepresentative payees are private individuals.\nQUESTION: Does -- does the State have any set-\noff rights that private entities don't? Suppose a private\nperson were the representative payee. Do they have the\nsame sort of set-off rights for other debts as the State\ndoes?\nMS. MILLETT: Neither -- make sure I understand\nwhat you're talking about by set-off. But neither private\nnor State officials would have the right to set off money\nagainst -- on -- on their own unilaterally to --\nQUESTION: Well, I'm just talking about 407 now.\nI'm just talking about 407. Because the attorney general\nindicated that the State could, so far as 407 is\nconcerned, set off a tax debt.\nMS. MILLETT: I didn't understand that to be her\n-- her response. But if -- but, first of all, you have to\nask how you come into possession. To undertake an offset,\nyou somehow have to be in possession of the Social\nSecurity check, and the State and private people would not\ncome into possession of that check unless they're\nappointed as a representative payee.\nQUESTION:\nquestion is whether -- what I'm trying to explore is\nwhether the State has some special advantages that other\nrepresentative payees might not in the area of being -- of\nbeing allowed to make certain set-offs to take certain\nfunds. Because if that's so, then it sounds more like\nlegal process. That was the --\nMS. MILLETT: I'm sorry. I misunderstood your\nquestion. I didn't know that they had been appointed\nrepresentative payee.\nOnce you are a representative payee, the State\nand a private payee are in the same position in that when\nit comes to reimbursing yourself for past debts, as\nopposed to meeting current maintenance needs, the -- you\n-- you are subject to the Social Security Administration's\nrules. They have specific POMS and regulations on payment\nof past debts and --\nQUESTION: In other words, the State of\nWashington is not relying here on any special statutory\nauthority for set-offs that's applicable only to a State.\nMS. MILLETT: No, it is not.\nWhat's important to understand here -- and I\nthink one of the premises for respondents' position is\nsome confusion about the difference between current\nmaintenance and past debts. Past debts are defined both\nin a POMS, the -- the interpretive manual done by the\nSocial Security Administration, but also in the\nregulations on page 216 of the petition appendix,\n402.2040(d), when it talks about claims of creditors to be\npaid by a representative payee. It -- the limitation is\non claims that arise prior to the first month for which\nyou become entitled to benefits. That's what a past debt\nis. It would be reimbursed by a payee.\nAny debts that arise after you start receiving\nbenefits are current maintenance costs. So if I get a\nbenefit check for January but for administrative reasons\nthe State does not pay my bills for that month until\nMarch, that's not a reimbursement. That is payment of\ncurrent maintenance by the January check for January\ncosts.\nQUESTION: May I -- may I ask you a question\nabout mechanics here? Just the facts are a little hard\nfor me to understand at times. As I understand it, many\nof these children are in foster homes and the foster\nparents are paid by the State. Is the State agency that\npays the foster parents the same agency that receives the\nFederal check?\nMS. MILLETT: Yes, it is. There are two\ndifferent units within -- it's the department -- in\nWashington, it's the Department of Social and Human\nServices that --\nQUESTION: And the second question I had --\nthere's a lot of discussion in the briefs about something\ncalled sweeping, which I don't understand. Would you tell\nme what it is?\nMS. MILLETT: Well, I'm afraid it may have\ndifferent meanings depending on whom you ask the question\nto. But as -- as it's discussed by the Court here, the --\nour understanding is that it -- it is this confusion about\nreimbursement and current maintenance. What Washington\nwas doing was it would get a check in May that would be a\nlump sum payment for February, March, April, and May. And\nit would go back and apply February's -- the -- the\npercentage of that lump sum check that was for February to\nthe February expenses, March to the March expenses. That\nis the account sweeping that's talked about in the Court\nhere and that's all that the record talks about.\nThat is not impermissible. That is, under our\nview, the use of -- use of this -- proper use of these\nbenefits for current maintenance. The fact that for\naccounting reasons it happens 4 months later doesn't\nchange anything.\nNow --\nQUESTION: What if it happens --\nQUESTION: What if it happens 7 months --\nQUESTION:\nQUESTION: -- 7 months --\nQUESTION: Yes. Is there a 6-month cutoff on\nthat?\nMS. MILLETT: With respect to the SSI, the Title\nXVI benefits, there is -- there was after October 1996,\nand that's why there's some confusion because this case\nspanned that bridge. But as of October --\nQUESTION: It's a little complicated, doesn't\nit?\nMS. MILLETT: There's a lot of complicated\nthings here.\nBut the -- but -- but for that reason, the fact\nthe commissioner has been administering this program and\nthe representative payee's program since it started in\n1939 and it has recognized and endorsed the practice of\nall 50 States having foster care agencies doing this as\nnot violating the anti-alienation provision is, I think,\nvery important to keep in mind and that adopting the\ndefinition of anti-alienation provision, using that to\npolice allegations of misuse under the representative\npayee system would be very confounding and confusing to\nthe system.\nQUESTION: May I ask you one question I asked\nthe attorney general too? Do you also disagree with the\nanalysis in the dissenting opinion?\nMS. MILLETT: Yes, for -- for two reasons.\nQUESTION: The same reasons she gave.\nMS. MILLETT: Well, yes, I think it has again\nthe confusion about past reimbursements which could still\nbe for current maintenance and the payment of past debts.\nBut the other thing that the Washington Supreme\nCourt's concurring dissenting opinion did was it said you\ncould -- you could pay for maintenance, but first you have\nto pay for special needs. That gets it exactly upside\ndown.\nThe -- there's much concern here about the best\ninterest -- the best interest test here, but the best\ninterest is a regulatory test designed to implement the\npurpose of these benefits. And the purpose of these\nbenefits in the case of Danny Keffeler, Title II benefits,\nis just to replace the income stream of the lost parent.\nThat parent is legally obliged to pay child support to the\nState of Washington. All Washington is doing is what his\nmother would have been legally obligated to do under --\nunder State law with that same income. So it's consistent\nwith the purpose of these benefits to use them for what\nthey're doing. The SSI benefits are minimum income,\nestablish a minimum floor. All that Washington has said\nis when the Federal Government --\nQUESTION:\nstatutory restriction on what the -- when the money comes\nfrom the Federal Government that does not apply when the\nmoney comes from the family.\nMS. MILLETT: On?\nQUESTION: 407.\nMS. MILLETT: That's right. But it's important\n-- it's important to understand the limited role of 407.\nIt said you can't come get these benefits, but it doesn't\nmean that -- that debts and obligations to pay can't arise\nand that you can't enforce, against the parents who may\nhave other income, child support through other mechanisms.\nYou just can't come after, through a legal process, the\nSocial Security benefits.\nThank you, Justice Stevens.\nQUESTION: Thank you very much.\nMs. Roseborough.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF TERESA W. ROSEBOROUGH\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMS. ROSEBOROUGH: Justice Stevens, and may it\nplease the Court:\nI think the Court's questions have hit on the\nkey issues here, and I'd like to point out what I believe\nto be the errors in the State of Washington and the United\nStates' analysis in this case.\nI agree with Ms. Millett that the Social\nSecurity benefits that the State receives as\nrepresentative payee on behalf of these children indeed\nbelong to the children. And in its role as representative\npayee, the State essentially steps into their shoes to use\nthe benefits to serve their best interests.\nThe regulation-mandated transfer from a State\ntrust fund account, which is the account in which the\nState deposits the children's funds when they are\nreceived, to the State treasury occurs in the State of\nWashington because of the operation of the State statute\nand two regulations, one superseding the other, that\nmandate that the State shall use those benefits to\nreimburse its previously advanced costs of care.\nThere's a singular exception in the regulations\nthat permits a State to advance costs of care to a Social\nSecurity disability recipient and then later seek\nreimbursement out of the paid disability benefits for that\ncare, and that is found at 42 U.S.C., section 1383(g)(1).\nThat provision specifically provides an exception to the\noperation of section 407(a), and provides that where\nappropriate agreements are in place between the State and\nthe commissioner of Social Security and between the State\nand the individual, that a State may advance costs of care\nin the period between the application for benefits and the\ndate on which benefits are received and then seek\nreimbursement out of the Social Security funds for that\nperiod of interim assistance.\nApart from that exception, the use of Social\nSecurity benefits to reimburse previously advanced costs\nof care or public assistance is the payment of a debt\nwithin the meaning of the Social Security regulations.\nQUESTION: Ms. Roseborough, I want to make sure\nthat I understand what you're saying because it seems to\nme you're telling us the Social -- the food and shelter\nand clothing must be provided to the child today and\ntomorrow and the next day. So the State is paying for\nthat immediately, directly. The Social Security check for\nthat month comes in a little later. It comes in a month\nlater. If I understand what you're saying correctly, when\nthe State takes the check which it gets in March for\nservices rendered in January, it cannot use the -- that\ncheck to pay itself back for services it rendered in -- in\nJanuary. Is that what you're saying?\nMS. ROSEBOROUGH: Yes, Your Honor. It cannot\nuse that check to pay itself back for services rendered in\nMarch or January without complying with the Social\nSecurity rules and regulations applicable to the authority\nto pay a debt.\nQUESTION: Why isn't the same thing true of the\nguardian who's been appointed the -- the designated\nbeneficiary? When a guardian gets money, the -- the\nguardian reimburses himself for past expenses. Is that\nalso the payment of a past debt?\nMS. ROSEBOROUGH: It absolutely would be the\npayment of a debt -- past debt, and it would be subject to\nthe same restrictions.\nQUESTION: Why isn't the same thing when you\nhave an EZ pass if you go through the tolls? One of the\nkids buys an EZ pass and unfortunately it shows up on his\ncredit card a month later.\nMS. ROSEBOROUGH: Then the representative payee,\nhaving in its possession funds belonging to that child,\nmakes a determination whether or not that is a debt that\nshould be paid in the best interest of the child or not.\nQUESTION: But if they had to put up a deposit,\nfor example, the State couldn't pay for the EZ pass.\nMS. ROSEBOROUGH: The State could pay for it if\nthey had, in their possession, Social Security benefits\nthat made that an appropriate expenditure of the funds.\nQUESTION: In their possession. And let's skip\nEZ pass and go back to a parent who has custody of her\nchild.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: A parent has custody of her child.\nShe pays for that child's food, clothing, and shelter in\nJanuary. She gets the check from Social Security in\nMarch. So you're telling me that she cannot use that\nMarch check to reimburse herself for money that she spent\nin January.\nMS. ROSEBOROUGH: Whether or not the parent\ncould use this child's Social Security benefit check to\npay herself for having advanced care to the child in\nJanuary is wholly dependent on whether or not that\nreimbursement would be in the best interest of the child\nat the time the benefits are received.\nMs. Gregoire and the Government misunderstand\nthe regulations. They cite to 2040 --\nQUESTION: No. I just would like to know if --\nif -- as I see it, the State agency is identically\nsituated with the parent. They're both providing food,\nclothing, and shelter now, and they will get the Federal\ncheck for that food, clothing, and shelter 2 months later,\nat least a month later. And if you're saying that then it\n-- they both -- the parent, the social agency -- they are\ndebtors -- creditors. They're both creditors because they\nprovided the service already?\nMS. ROSEBOROUGH: If they -- if they are using\nthe -- the obligation under the Social Security laws is\nnot to use the month's benefits --\nQUESTION:\nMS. ROSEBOROUGH: -- in the -- for the month for\nwhich they are paid.\nQUESTION: The mother gets the check in March.\nMS. ROSEBOROUGH: Then she must --\nQUESTION: And she cannot use that for services\nthat she has or food, clothing and shelter she has bought\nfor the child in January.\nMS. ROSEBOROUGH: She has to make a\ndetermination in March at the time she receives the\nbenefits as to what expenditure of benefits is in the best\ninterest of the child. Let's say in the interim between\nthe use of the funds in January to -- to pay for whatever\nitems were paid for in January, the child has suffered\nsome event in February or March that requires the\nexpenditure of those benefits or the child needs a\ncommunication device or a prothesis --\nQUESTION: Or that -- or that she wants the\nchild to go to university. Why -- why would it not always\nbe in the best of the interest of the child not to pay\nback his parents and put it into a -- a trust account for\nfuture education? It would always be in the -- in the\nbetter interest of the child than paying off the past debt\nto the parent.\nMS. ROSEBOROUGH: And that's why the Social\nSecurity regulations impose stringent guidelines on\nrepresentative payees that want to use benefits to pay\nback for things that happened in the past.\nQUESTION: No, but your theory, it seems to me,\nis there's a choice here, when you apply the best interest\ntest, between a child with a full stomach and no trust\nfund and a child with a full stomach and a trust fund.\nAnd you're saying the trust fund always wins. The parent\ncannot pay back because it's always in the child's best\ninterest to have the trust fund as well as the full\nstomach. Isn't that what you're saying?\nMS. ROSEBOROUGH: Not necessarily. In fact, the\nSocial Security regulations point out that in the case of\na -- of a family unit, that is dependent on the Social\nSecurity benefits of the children in that unit, that they\n-- those benefits can be used to promote the stability of\nthe family. And it may be -- well be --\nQUESTION: I don't know -- I'm not quite sure\nhow stability works into this, but let's -- let's forget\nthe exceptional case for the moment. Save for that\nexceptional case, aren't you saying full stomach plus\ntrust fund always wins under the best interest test?\nMS. ROSEBOROUGH: If the child has a full\nstomach and if the --\nQUESTION: Right. That's the -- that's the\nhypothesis:\nnot. Best interest says, put the money in the trust fund.\nIsn't that your position?\nMS. ROSEBOROUGH: Absolutely true.\nQUESTION: Does it bother you that the Social --\nQUESTION: How would you square that --\nQUESTION: Go ahead.\nQUESTION: -- know how you square that position\nwith a statute that seems aimed at giving children this\nmoney so they can pay for room and board and meet their\nbasic subsistence.\nMS. ROSEBOROUGH: The question is when do you\napply the test of current maintenance and using the\nbenefits at the time they are received to provide directly\nfor the care of the child which is the obligation under\nthe Social Security regulations, and when are the\nregulations with respect to the payment of past debts\ninvoked.\nNow, Ms. Gregoire argues -- excuse me -- General\nGregoire argues that it's not invoked for 6 months, and\nshe is relying on the provisions of the code related to\ncertain lump sum benefits that provide additional\nprotection to those benefits. Solicitor Millett says the\nsame thing relying on section 24(d). But they are\nmistaken that -- one illustration of their mistake is\nfound in the Social Security Administration's audit of\nContra County, California, where the OIG found that that\ncounty was using Social Security benefits to reimburse\nitself for care provided before the benefits were actually\nreceived --\nQUESTION: You've lost me a long time ago\nbecause I have a sort of basic question. It seems to me\nif a mother or somebody in the family who is the recipient\nof this extra money coming in from the SSI can use it, has\nthe right to use it to pay a bill that the child ran up\nfor some food or from shelter or, for that matter, EZ pass\nor tuition -- and I -- I gather they have at least the\nright to do that if they want to pay those bills.\nMS. ROSEBOROUGH: Not if they want to. They\nhave the right --\nQUESTION: They think it's the right thing to\ndo, and so they -- yes, they think it's --\nMS. ROSEBOROUGH: They think it's in the best\ninterest of the child.\nQUESTION: Well, all right. Let's -- let's\nimagine that doing what you think is right for the child\nis in the child's best interest. And therefore you do the\nright thing which is to pay the bills for food, shelter,\ntuition, and whatever that the child ran up. Now,\nassuming that that's okay, why can't the State do exactly\nthe same thing?\nMS. ROSEBOROUGH: The State can do exactly the\nsame thing as long as it applies the same test. As long\nas it looks at whether or not the use of the benefits to\nreimburse the debt is the --\nQUESTION: Okay. Now I got your point.\nMS. ROSEBOROUGH: -- that is the best interest\nof the child.\nQUESTION: Your point is neither the one nor the\nother can pay -- has the right under the statute or under\nthe -- to pay these past debts for food, for example.\nAnd now my question would be they're the agency.\nThey know what Congress had in mind. A naive reading\nwould say Congress had in mind pay these bills for food\nand shelter, but they know it. They're the experts. They\nknow their own regs, and they come in and tell you your\nreading of this is totally wrong. Of course, Congress\nwanted guardians, whether they're States or not States, to\npay bills for food and shelter for this child who has no\nparents. All right. Now, they say, of course, they\nwanted that. There's nothing in the statute that says\nclearly to the contrary. So they win. Now, what's your\nresponse?\nMS. ROSEBOROUGH: One, the Social Security\nAdministration has consistently, prior to its pleadings in\nthis case at least, made the exact same demarcation that\nwe are arguing here. The Social Security Administration\nhas said that once a benefit payment is received, you look\nbackwards at every debt that occurred prior to that date\nand judge whether or not that debt can be paid on the\nbasis of whether or not the current and foreseeable needs\nof the beneficiary have been met and whether or not it's\nin the best interest of the beneficiary to pay that debt.\nAs to going forward --\nQUESTION: Well, doesn't -- doesn't the statute\nbasically leave it to the commissioner to -- to evaluate\nwhether a representative payee is acting in the best\ninterest of the child?\nMS. ROSEBOROUGH: It does ask the --\nQUESTION: And we have a representative of that\ncommissioner here before us today saying that under the\nstatutory and regulatory scheme, that payments such as\nthese for foster care are in the best interests of the\nchild. Why should we strain to find otherwise --\nMS. ROSEBOROUGH: Because the --\nQUESTION: -- and -- and upset what's going on\nall across the country? I think your position is\ntroubling for that reason.\nMS. ROSEBOROUGH: If I may first respond that\nfactually it's not true that this is what's going on\nthroughout the country.\nthat we know about, through cases that have occurred in\nthe various States, illustrate that they take very\ndifferent or use very different procedures with respect to\nthe funds. And we only know of Washington that has a\nprocess that compels the State administrator to ignore\ntheir obligation to evaluate the best interests of the\nchild at the time the benefit is received and instead make\na determination that all of the benefits should be used to\npay past debts to reimburse public assistance that was\nexpended without regard to the eligibility of the child\nfor Social Security benefits.\nQUESTION: Well, the representative can be --\nthe representative can be removed if the representative is\nmisappropriating funds or misusing the representative's\nposition at responsibility. But that has nothing to do\nwith -- with the legal process provisions of 407.\nMS. ROSEBOROUGH: It has to do with that in this\nsense. The State argues that section 407(a) doesn't apply\nto it because it is acting properly as a representative\npayee. We contend -- and I think we demonstrate in our\nbrief, and the State supreme court in fact held -- that\nWashington was not acting as a properly regulated\nrepresentative payee within the meaning of section 405(j).\nQUESTION: But that we're -- we're told by the\nGovernment is none of the State court's business. I asked\nthat question expressly to find out whether in the\nGovernment's view 405 is something that any State court\ncould enforce, and the answer was no. 405 is for -- if --\nif you think the representative payee is not acting\nproperly, you go complain to the Social Security\nAdministration, and it's entirely a Federal law, not any\nState court that interferes with the representative\npayee's control.\nMS. ROSEBOROUGH: I -- I believe that her\nresponse was that you could bring a State law action, for\nexample, for conversion against the representative payee\nthat failed to administer benefits in accordance with the\nSocial Security Act. Those Social Security regulations\nthemselves provide that you cannot sue the administration\nfor a representative payee's failure to use the benefits\nproperly, but that you may be able to sue the\nrepresentative payee themselves.\nQUESTION: But -- but your answer to my 407\nquestion talked about 405. I don't -- I don't understand\nthat.\nMS. ROSEBOROUGH: 407(a) clearly prevents a\nState from using legal process like the administrative\nregulations here to collect for past expenditures.\nQUESTION: Okay. Why -- why is this -- why is\nthis legal process?\nMS. ROSEBOROUGH: It's legal process --\nQUESTION: Why is it -- why is it something that\nany representative payee, whether they're a State entity\nor not, could not do?\nMS. ROSEBOROUGH: Because Washington is not\nmaking an evaluation that the payment of the debt to\nitself is in the best interest of the child. What it is\ndoing is acting pursuant to the compulsion of a regulatory\nscheme that requires that the first use of the benefits be\nto reimburse itself. The Social Security regulations do\nnot state that the use of the benefits to pay current\nmaintenance --\nQUESTION: But that's an odd term of the use\nlegal process, unless you're saying any set-off is legal\nprocess.\nMS. ROSEBOROUGH: A set-off --\nQUESTION: Suppose a private entity just sets\noff an earlier debt against current funds. That's --\nthat's not legal process in the ordinary sense of the\nterm. It's a set-off.\nMS. ROSEBOROUGH: That would be depending on\nwhether they were doing so by operational law or because\nof their own volition. Here the State is clearly acting\nunder what it contended below at least was the volition or\nthe -- the obligation of law.\ngave it the right to secure or require the use of these\nSocial Security benefits to pay a specific obligation,\nthat specific obligation being the debt to the State that\narose when the State advanced funds for the child's care.\nQUESTION: Well, you're saying that anytime the\nlaw provides for action or provides that action will be\nlawful, that taking that action involves resort to legal\nprocess. Is that your definition?\nMS. ROSEBOROUGH: I'm saying that anytime the\nlaw allows or permits the securing of Social Security\nbenefits to the payment of a specific obligation, that\nthat is legal process or the application of legal process\nto those benefits in violation of section 407(a).\nQUESTION: But the reasonable word in there I\nthink is securing. All the State is doing is taking from\nthis account and putting into that account. And -- and I\nthink all the State is doing is saying, under the law,\nwe're able to do that. The law says we can do that, or at\nleast it doesn't say we can't. And I think you're saying\nthat whenever the State claims legal authority, it is\nusing legal process within this statute. Is -- is that --\nisn't that your position?\nMS. ROSEBOROUGH: No. My position is that --\nQUESTION: Then I still haven't gotten it.\nMS. ROSEBOROUGH:\nacts to transfer the benefits from the trust fund to the\nState treasury coffers, it does so by presenting a bill,\nin essence, a statement of account or a statement of\nexpenditures, to the trust fund unit reflecting the past\nexpenditures of the State on behalf of that child.\nEssentially it's saying, I have advanced monies for the\ncare of this child and I now want to be paid back out of\nthe child's trust fund unit. Fair enough. But the\nobligation of the State, wearing its hat as representative\npayee of the child, is to make a determination at that\npoint whether that repayment would be in the best interest\nof the child.\nQUESTION: Yes, but you have to go -- go on and\nsay what that -- why that's legal process. If the\ngrandmother does it, you would also have to say it is\nlegal process under your view because it's authorized by\nthe common law, I suppose, of the State or maybe by a\nstatutory law. Suppose you have a statute that says a\ncreditor can set off against an earlier debt money that\nthe creditor receives. That's not legal process in any --\nin any usual sense of the term.\nMS. ROSEBOROUGH: Absolutely it would be, the\nlatter thing that you said, that if a State allowed -- if\na State statute allowed a set-off against a Social\nSecurity benefit to pay a past debt, that would be a\nviolation of section 407(a). In fact, Federal law\nprovides that even if the United States itself seeks to\nset off a debt like past due taxes against Social Security\nbenefits, that it has to have a specifically set out in\nthe statutes exception to section 407(a), and that in fact\nis what exists. There's a statute that says by express\nreference to section 407(a) as required by section 407(b)\nthat the United States may set off past due taxes against\nSocial Security benefits.\nAbsent that statutory authorization or exception\nto section 407(a), a set-off compelled by law or\nauthorized by law would be within the ambit of legal\nprocess or an application of legal process to benefits\nprohibited by section 407(a).\nQUESTION: Would -- would you say the same thing\nif the State were simply funding the -- the cost of food\nand clothing for the current month and on -- on Wednesday\nit -- it paid a bill for groceries and on Thursday it\npresented this document that allowed the transfer from the\ntrust fund to the -- to the State's account? That too\nwould be legal process?\nMS. ROSEBOROUGH: That -- if it was doing so --\nQUESTION: So the only way the State could do it\nthen, I take it on your theory, is to use the money to pay\nin advance of its own expenditure a -- a fund from which\nit then could draw under its separate hat to pay the\ngroceries.\nMS. ROSEBOROUGH: The presentation of the\ngrocery bill to the representative payee for payment may\n-- and -- and the payment that comes as a result of that,\nmay not -- may or may not be legal process depending on\nwhat it is that authorizes that transaction and whether or\nnot --\nQUESTION: Well, it -- it paid the grocery bill\non Wednesday, and Thursday it says, we're going to\ntransfer the money to pay the grocery bill. That's\nprocess on -- on your theory, isn't it?\nMS. ROSEBOROUGH: No, not necessarily.\nQUESTION: What's the difference between\nWednesday and Thursday and February and March?\nMS. ROSEBOROUGH: Under my theory, it's clearly\na reimbursement. And as a reimbursement, it then falls\nunder the regulations with respect to reimbursements.\nQUESTION: Why isn't it a reimbursement between\nFebruary and March?\nMS. ROSEBOROUGH: It is absolutely a\nreimbursement. That's exactly what we claim.\nQUESTION: Then -- then if -- if there's legal\nprocess for the February/March transfer, there's legal\nprocess for the Wednesday/Thursday transfer.\nMS. ROSEBOROUGH: It's the Wednesday/Thursday\nprocess in the hands of a private representative payee not\nacting under compulsion of law.\nQUESTION: I'm -- I'm talking about the State.\nMS. ROSEBOROUGH: There's two --\nQUESTION: I'm talking about what we've got\nhere.\nMS. ROSEBOROUGH: Acting --\nQUESTION: It's legal process when -- when we --\nwhen we buy the groceries Wednesday and we make the\ntransfer Thursday. Right?\nMS. ROSEBOROUGH: Then -- but the State of\nWashington is doing that because it is compelled by\nstatutes and regulations that mandate that it shall use\nthose benefits to reimburse the foster care costs. If it\nwas not operating -- if it was making a choice --\nQUESTION: That's true --\nMS. ROSEBOROUGH: -- on Thursday --\nQUESTION: That's true in either instance, isn't\nit?\nMS. ROSEBOROUGH: Not --\nQUESTION: I mean, that's -- that's a wash, as\nbetween February and March and Wednesday and Thursday.\nMS. ROSEBOROUGH: That is a wash.\nQUESTION: Okay.\nMS. ROSEBOROUGH: So the question is in both\ninstances on Thursday or a month later, is the use of\nthese benefits to pay for that which has been provided in\nthe past in the best interest of the child.\nQUESTION: Okay. Then it's --\nMS. ROSEBOROUGH: That --\nQUESTION: -- then it's -- that's why I -- I\ntried to lead to the conclusion -- let me try it again --\nthat the only way on your analysis to avoid the\nimplication of legal process would be to set aside funds\nreceived from the Social Security Administration in\nadvance for payment for future groceries. Is that\ncorrect?\nMS. ROSEBOROUGH: That would be the only way to\navoid a reimbursement scenario, would be to use the Social\nSecurity benefits first to pay for those things that the\nchild needs. That would -- that would avoid the\nregulations respecting past debts and reimbursement.\nQUESTION: So you would have no case if you take\nthe Social Security check that you receive in February for\nJanuary to cover the January period instead of reimbursing\nthe State for what it supplied in January. It takes that\ncheck and puts in the account and says, now, this will\ncover the March food, clothing, and shelter. That would\nbe all right, and you wouldn't have any 407 --\nMS. ROSEBOROUGH: And that appears to be what\nmany States do. For example, it appears from the brief --\nQUESTION: Even though the check was supposed to\nbe for January and not for April.\nMS. ROSEBOROUGH: The check is -- the\neligibility of the check, if it's an SSA check, is\ndetermined by the child survivorship through January. So\nthat's why it's paid at the end of January. A disability\ncheck, however, is paid at the beginning of the month for\nwhich it is intended to be used.\nQUESTION: So what all this -- so what all this\nlitigation will have achieved is just to compel the States\nto use the current checks that they get for next month\ninstead of for last month. You -- you get maybe a 3-\nmonth ride. I mean, I guess they -- they lose 3 months'\nworth. But so long as they re-gear up their system so\nthey're paying for next month, all of this will go away.\nMS. ROSEBOROUGH: They will avoid violation --\navoid encroaching or violating section 407(a) --\nQUESTION: Does that make a lot of sense?\nMS. ROSEBOROUGH: It does make a lot of sense\nbecause the problems in Washington's administration with\naccounts, we think, with double dipping, with use of the\nbenefits to pay administrative and programmatic costs\ninstead of to pay for items, food, clothing, shelter, and\nspecial needs of the child, could not occur in a system\nwhere the Federal benefits were used in the first instance\nto pay for those things.\nMoreover, in Washington --\nQUESTION: But why -- why --\nMS. ROSEBOROUGH: -- the average payment to a\ndisabled child is less than the guaranteed minimum under\nFederal law so that this child would at least be assured\nof the use of the full amount of the Federal benefit to\nwhich they are entitled without set-off by the State. The\nState could add to it but it cannot, as Washington does,\nsubtract from it.\nQUESTION: Instead of --\nQUESTION: Is it not true that -- that in the\noverwhelming number of cases, the Federal benefit is not\nnearly enough to cover the care of the child, that the --\nthe average SSI payment doesn't make it to cover the\nmonthly needs?\nMS. ROSEBOROUGH: Nor does the payment that the\nState makes under its foster care program. In the -- in\nthe case -- in the specific case of the State of\nWashington, the guaranteed minimum payment under Federal\nSocial Security law to an SSI-eligible child averages $715\na month. The State of Washington pays the -- a stipend to\nthe household of that child of some $300 to $400 a month\ndepending on the age of the child. That means --\nQUESTION: But now if we -- if we had the new\nsystem now where you take the January check and you pay\nfor March or April with it, then the other things that\nyou're complaining about, the double dipping, what you\nallege -- and they may say, no, it's not happening -- the\nproper forum to determine that would be the Social\nSecurity Administration. Wouldn't it be?\nMS. ROSEBOROUGH: In this case, the claim was\nbrought under State law against the State of Washington\nfor using the benefits in a way that was inconsistent with\nSocial Security law. The State of Washington offered\nas -- by way of defense, that it was complying with\nsection 405(j) and that section 407(a) did not apply to\nit. But the State law claims for conversion and misuse of\nthe benefits remain and are not dependent on -- they're\ndependent on establishing, as we have, that the State was\nmisusing the benefits, but they're not dependent on the\navailability of a direct remedy under the Social Security\nrules.\nMoreover, section --\nQUESTION: There's one -- one question that I'd\nlike you to ask because it's really troubling me more than\nanything else here. We have a brief from the Children's\nDefense Fund that says most of these children don't have a\nWanda Pierce. They have no one but the State. They have\nno one to make out an application to Social Security\nAdministration. Were not the State agency operating the\nway it is operating, there simply would be no benefits, no\nSocial Security, no -- no SSI. There would be that much\nless available for the care of all these children in the\nsystem.\nMS. ROSEBOROUGH: This is exactly true that what\nthe State of Washington is doing is using the Federal\nfunds that are intended for the individual benefit of\ndisabled children and children who are SSA recipients to\nfund the general foster care system.\nQUESTION: I asked you to answer that question.\nIs -- what the Children's Defense Fund is saying is that\nbecause Washington is doing what it is doing -- and it is\ndoing it because it's going to get -- it's going to get\nthe Federal Government to pay, as these benefits were\ndesigned to pay, for the food, clothing, and shelter of\nthe child -- that there would be no one to do this and\nthere would be less money in the entire system. And\nthat's the question I asked you to answer, not another\nquestion.\nMS. ROSEBOROUGH: We believe that States will\ncontinue to serve as representative payees even if they're\ncompelled to administer the benefits in a way that is\nconsistent with the Social Security rules.\nQUESTION: What's the basis for that belief?\nMS. ROSEBOROUGH: The basis for that belief is\nthat the State receives enormous benefit from having\navailable to itself the Federal benefits and being able to\nexpend those benefits in the best interest of the child\nand to pay for those things that come within the defined\nneeds of the disabled children. It has no reason to give\nup that money. And we don't ask it to. What we do ask it\nto do is to administer those funds properly under the\nSocial Security Act and to make a determination, before it\nuses those funds to fill the State treasury, whether or\nnot or what use of the funds would be in the best interest\nof the child. That's exactly what the Social Security\nAdministration has consistently required of representative\npayees.\nIn this case where a State had -- where a child\nhas already received public assistance, which is in part\nState and in part federally funded, for a State to use\nanother Federal benefit that the child receives to\nreimburse the expenditures not only of the State dollars\nbut also of the Federal dollars that were provided to the\nState under that program for the use of the child is an\nabuse of the representative payee system. It is a -- and\nis a disservice to the disabled child.\nSocial Security disability benefits were\nintended to provide for the special needs of the disabled\nchild, to assist them in the transition to adulthood, and\nto provide them some relief from the burdens of their\ndisability. In the State's concept, as it would use those\nfunds, without any heed to the best interests of the\nchild, no dollar of Social Security benefits received by a\ndisabled child before they reach their 18th birthday would\nbe available to meet those special needs because the State\nof Washington refuses to acknowledge an obligation under\nthe Social Security laws to determine what expenditure is\nor is not in the best interest of the child.\n2040(d) does not provide that a -- any payment\nof a benefit is current maintenance if -- as long as it\nwas for food, clothing, or shelter. It makes a clear\ndemarcation between -- and the example in the regulation\nmakes clear -- between benefits that are used at the time\nthey are received to provide for care and benefits that\nare sought to be used for care that was provided before\nthat. We simply ask that the Court apply the generally\napplicable Social Security benefit regulations to the\nState of Washington's use of the funds for reimbursement.\nIf there are no further questions.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Ms. Roseborough.\nGeneral Gregoire, you have 4 minutes.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CHRISTINE O. GREGOIRE\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMS. GREGOIRE: Where is the legal process in\nthis case? There is in fact none. The only thing that's\nbeing suggested is reimbursement is the legal process. In\nthe case of Title II benefits, an individual is eligible\nin January. Social Security doesn't pay until February.\nThat has to be construed as reimbursement. Counsel's\ninterpretation would then turn the entire program on its\near. The fact of the matter is that is not legal process.\nIt's what --\nQUESTION: Your definition of legal process is a\nprocess that requires judicial involvement?\nMS. GREGOIRE: Judicial, quasi-judicial. If an\nindividual has the authority by law and -- who goes out\nand -- and actually implements something that takes the\nbenefits, but it's more than reimbursement as we have --\nQUESTION: Well, that's what your adversary has\n-- has stated, that this is pursuant to authority of the\nlaw. That's why it's legal process.\nMS. GREGOIRE: We would submit, Justice Kennedy,\nif you look at Bennett and Philpott, what this Court found\nin both those cases was legal process was actual in the\none case in implementation of a lawsuit; in the other\ncase, the actual attachment.\nWe have nothing of that nature here. We have a\nsimple -- in answer to your question about is the State\nasking for special rights, to the contrary. The State is\nsimply asking not to be disadvantaged, to be treated no\ndifferent than any other representative payee which was\nyour holding in Philpott. So the fact of the matter is\nhere we're simply asking to do that which any parent would\ndo in fulfilling his or her responsibilities in caring for\na child.\nLet me also, if I can, turn to the -- the Social\nSecurity reimbursement idea of -- of using it in the best\ninterests of the child. What counsel has suggested is the\nonly thing that's in the best interests of the child is\nextras. The State of Washington pays thousands of dollars\nfor these children because they come with psychiatric\nkinds of needs. We are not paying the minimum. We are,\nin fact, paying significant amounts of money.\nIn the case of one of our randomly selected\nchildren, Nacole Blimka, in one month, over $2,000.\nIn the case of another randomly selected child,\nDenita Smith, in one month, over $3,000. And yes, we held\nthe benefits, got no reimbursement whatsoever, to help\nDenita Smith be reunited with her parent so that her\nparent could set up a home, pay for the food and the\nclothing and shelter that was necessary for that child.\nThe fact of the matter is the State of\nWashington does exercise discretion which is accorded it,\nbroad discretion in the best interests of the child. She\nwould simply ask you only extras are in the best interest.\nWe would submit supplying food, clothing, shelter is\nalways in the best interests of the child and that is what\nSocial Security suggests.\nShe indicates that her complaint suggests that\nthere is some State law claims. To the contrary. The\ncomplaint all the way along has suggested a 407 violation.\nShe further suggests that R.C.W. 74.13.060, the\nstatute in question here, is mandatory. To the contrary,\nit is not. It allows the State discretion to use Social\nSecurity benefits for the special needs of a child and to\nreimburse the State which is precisely what occurs in this\nparticular instance.\nI ask you to return to the question presented.\nIs there a violation of 407(a) in this case because a duly\ndesignated representative payee, supervised by the Social\nSecurity Administration, is using the monies for the\ncurrent maintenance of the child. The plain reading of\n407(a) to that question is no.\nWith that, we would ask you, respectfully, to\nreverse the decision of the Washington State Supreme\nCourt. Thank you.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you, General Gregoire.\n"
