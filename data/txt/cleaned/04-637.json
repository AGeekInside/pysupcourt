        "content": "(10:06 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: We'll hear argument\nnow in Margaret Bradshaw v. John David Stumpf.\nMr. Cole.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF DOUGLAS R. COLE\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. COLE: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please\nthe Court:\nJohn Stumpf pleaded guilty to the aggravated\nmurder of Mary Jane Stout. The evidence shows he is, in\nfact, guilty of that crime. The court below, nonetheless,\nvacated his conviction on habeas review citing two\ngrounds. Its reasoning on each directly conflicts with\nthis Court's opinions and significantly undermines the\nfinality of the hundreds of thousands of State court\ncriminal convictions based on pleas.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Counsel, I -- I think he was\ngiven the death sentence. Is that right?\nMR. COLE: That is correct, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: At the end of the day.\nAnd there was a separate sentencing hearing?\nMR. COLE: There was a separate mitigation\nhearing under Ohio law, yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: And was it argued at that\nhearing by the State that Stumpf was the triggerman?\nMR. COLE: Your Honor, the State said that they\n-- they thought there was evidence to support that. They\nsaid, I don't believe it's necessary for this court to\nconclude he was the actual shooter, and that's in the\njoint appendix at 186. So the death penalty is\nappropriate --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: But it was argued.\nMR. COLE: The court -- or I'm sorry. The\nprosecutor argued that there was sufficient evidence to\nshow it.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: And was there evidence at the\nrecent habeas hearing that at least one of the sentencers\nrelied on the fact that the judge thought Stumpf was the\ntriggerman and the murderer?\nMR. COLE: Your Honor, after -- at the time of\nthe original sentencing hearing there was no other\nevidence, this new evidence of which he complaining --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Right.\nMR. COLE: -- didn't exist.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Right.\nMR. COLE: When it came into being, he then\nmoved to vacate his sentence at the State --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Right.\nMR. COLE: -- court. And the judge there from\nthe original panel --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Yes.\nMR. COLE: -- one of the judges said, it may\nhave made a difference. Of course, they had before them a\nmotion to vacate the -- the sentence at that time, and\nthey denied that motion. So apparently it didn't make a\ndifference to that judge.\nTwo other Ohio courts have independently\nreweighed all of the evidence and found that the death\nsentence was appropriate.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, I guess my concern\nactually is more with the sentencing proceeding here, in\nlight of what's happened, than with the guilty plea. And\nI suppose it's possible that that stands, but conceivably\nhe's entitled to a hearing on the sentencing aspect.\nMR. COLE: I -- I guess that would be\nconceivable, Your Honor, although I note that there's only\none due process claim he's making. He's making one form\nof constitutional error claim predicated on the Due\nProcess Clause, and if there was no due process violation\nwith respect to his conviction, which is the claim that he\nwas pressing before the Sixth Circuit, there's similarly\nno due process violation with respect to his sentence.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Why --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Do you think he has waived\nany due process claim insofar as it applies to the\nsentencing? Do you think that's waived? Is that clear?\nMR. COLE: No, Your Honor, I wouldn't say that.\nIn his Sixth Circuit briefs, he does -- in a section\nthat's entitled I hereby challenge my conviction, he does\nalso note in that section that he's got some concerns\nabout his sentencing hearing. So I don't know that he's\nwaived that. But I don't believe that there's a valid due\nprocess claim that he has with regard to either his\nconviction or his sentence.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Why do you argue that if there\nis no due process violation with respect to the actual\nplea, there is, therefore, no due process violation with\nrespect to the sentence?\nMR. COLE: Well, because his theory, Justice\nSouter, is the same with regard to both. He says this --\nthe use of this --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but we -- we may say the\ntheory really is -- is not sufficiently relevant with\nrespect to the plea but that it is with respect to the\nsentence.\nMR. COLE: That's conceivable, Your Honor. We\nunderstand that the -- we understood the Sixth Circuit\nopinion to be directed toward his conviction. So the --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I -- I -- no question about\nthat.\nMR. COLE: -- the thrust of our arguments before\nthis Court were directed towards the conviction. The\nother side then raised, oh, the State has waived their\nclaim about the sentencing, and -- and we were just\nmaking --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No.\nMR. COLE: -- clear that, A, we haven't, but B,\nin any event, the due process theory sounds the same in\nboth. And so if there's not a due process problem, with\nrespect to these arguably inconsistent theories, then\nthere's not a due process problem with respect to his\nsentence either. He hasn't brought any other set of\nfacts --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No. I -- I understand that.\nMay I go back just to one factual issue before\nwe go on and forget it? You -- you stated, in response to\nJustice O'Connor, that the State argued in -- in the\nStumpf case that there was sufficient evidence to find\nthat he was the triggerman. Did the State stop there and\nsay, in effect, we don't care whether you find him the\ntriggerman or not? We're just telling you there's enough\nevidence. I -- I assumed the State went on to say there\nis enough and you ought to find that he is the triggerman.\nMR. COLE: Well, Your Honor, referring to page\n187 and 188 of the joint appendix, he says, given those\ncircumstances, although we believe the evidence does prove\nhe was the shooter of Mary Jane Stout, legally,\ntechnically, I don't believe it makes any difference when\nyou have two people acting in concert for the joint and\nunlawful purpose of committing an aggravated robbery and\n-- and murder results.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Did -- did the prosecutor ever\nsay he was the triggerman? The evidence supports it and\n-- and that's the conclusion that ought to be drawn: he\nwas the triggerman.\nMR. COLE: He said there's ample evidence from\nwhich the court could conclude --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But did he take the second step\nand say there's ample evidence and he was, in fact, the\ntriggerman and you should so find, or in so many words?\nMR. COLE: In so many words, Your Honor, in\nconnection with the mitigation phase, in -- in connection\nwith the factual basis hearing even, he put on the\nevidence saying, you know, Mr. Stumpf says he wasn't the\nshooter and gives a lot of reasons to discount that\nevidence. So he's arguing that in fact Mr. Stumpf was the\nshooter. I think it's a fair implication if he doesn't\nsay the express words, but it's a fair implication.\nOf course, at that time, there was absolutely no\nevidence to the contrary. Mr. Wesley had not yet been\nextradited from Texas. He hadn't even made this alleged\nstatement to Mr. Eastman.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, the -- the evidence was\nStumpf -- Stumpf himself who said Wesley was the\ntriggerman with respect to Mrs. Stout.\nBut I wanted to ask you a question about -- that\n-- it relates to the sentencing part and it follows up\nJustice O'Connor's question. The -- the -- you -- as --\nif I understood you right, you said, well, there was a\nmotion that came before two of the three judges that were\npart of the guilty plea and the sentencing. This was a\nplea, so no jury trial. It was three judges. One of them\nhad died. The -- the two who remained -- one of them\nsaid, but if we had not been satisfied that Stumpf was, in\nfact, the triggerman, and we were satisfied that he was,\nin fact, an aider or abetter, that may very well have had\nan effect on the court's determination whether the death\npenalty should follow. I'm not saying it would, but it's\npossible. And then you said, but then he went ahead and\nvoted to deny the motion.\nMR. COLE: To vacate the sentence, yes, Your\nHonor.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes. But there's no\nexplanation at all. The only expression that we have from\nthat judge is -- he said, well, it's conceivable, although\nit wouldn't affect guilt, we would have come out with a\ndifferent sentence, and then going from that statement to\nnothing, just a denial without explanation. You -- you\nwant us to infer from that silent denial that the judge\nmust have resolved his own difficulty and decided it\nwouldn't make any difference on the sentence.\nMR. COLE: Well, A, I think that's an inference\nthat's supported by the fact that he voted to deny the\nmotion, but B, in any event, there's been an independent\nreweighing of all of the evidence in the Ohio intermediate\nappellate court and that court said that -- very\nspecifically said, even if we didn't believe he was the\nprincipal -- or principal offender, the actual shooter --\nwe do believe that. But even if we didn't, the death\nsentence here would be appropriate. And this Court noted\nin Clemons that an independent reweighing by an appellate\ncourt of the evidentiary record can be sufficient to\nsecure -- or to --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But it would be appropriate\nbecause the statute permits it. But the decision-maker\nhas three choices. And if the evidence had come in that\nWesley was the triggerman, maybe the -- this panel of\njudges would have done what the jury did in Wesley's case,\nthat is, it's the same crime, but not give the death\npenalty for it.\nMR. COLE: Well, Justice -- Justice Ginsburg,\nthe -- the evidence wasn't available at the time of the\noriginal sentence. So the failure to have that part of\nthe record at the time of the original sentencing hearing,\nof course, can't violate due process.\nAnd then the question would be, did something\nthat happened later violate due process? But I just don't\nthink it can be the case that anytime new evidence comes\nup that might cause a judge to say, boy, if we'd have had\nthat evidence before when we -- when we reached the\nsentencing decision, we might have reached a different\nresult --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, what -- what is the rule\nif there are two successive -- there are successive trials\nwith different defendants and there can only be one\nshooter and in each trial it's found that the defendant is\nthe shooter? What should be the rule, or does the -- does\nthe second person get the advantage? Does the State have\nto begin all over again with both? Or -- or does the\nState have no obligation to correct either?\nMR. COLE: Well, Justice Kennedy, I -- I think\nit depends, at least in part, on what role that finding\nplayed. If those two verdicts each had as an essential\ncomponent this fact, this person is the shooter and this\nperson is the shooter, so that the verdicts are\nnecessarily inconsistent so that we know the State has\nactually got someone in jail they're punishing that's\ninnocent, we would concede there may be a substantive due\nprocess right of the -- against the State because the\nState at that point --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: By whom? By whom? By which\none of the two?\nMR. COLE: Your Honor, I -- I think that's a\ngreat question.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Do we flip a coin?\nMR. COLE: Well, I -- I think the point is\nprobably both would have some kind of claim in that I\ndon't think the State can pursue and convict two people on\nnecessarily inconsistent theories because at that --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why -- why is that? I mean, it\nseems to me due process requires that there be enough\nevidence to -- for a jury to find beyond a reasonable\ndoubt that -- that the person was the shooter. And if in\n-- if there is, indeed, in both cases enough such\nevidence, it seems to me there is no denial of due\nprocess, and that the usual manner of accommodating for\nthat apparent injustice is -- is for the Governor to grant\nclemency to one of the two, have him figure out which one\nof the two wasn't the shooter, or to apply for -- for\nreopening of the -- of the -- of one of cases. But I\ndon't know that there is automatically a due process\nviolation which allows one or the other of the cases --\nproper convictions. Each one is fully proper. I don't\nknow that there's a due process violation that allows one\nof them to be set aside.\nMR. COLE: And I don't know that there is\neither, Your Honor. We'd be willing to concede that for\npurposes of this argument because even if there is, it\ndoesn't apply here --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Due -- due process doesn't mean\nperfection. It doesn't mean that each jury has to always\nreach the right result.\nMR. COLE: I -- I agree with that, Your Honor,\nand I hate to argue against my position, so I -- I do this\ngently. But at the same time, the court has noted and --\nand one of the old saws of American law is -- is it's\nbetter one guilty person should go free than that one\ninnocent person should be punished. And if the State\nknows, as a matter of fact, that it secured two\nconvictions for a crime that only one committed, the State\nknows at that point that it's punishing at least one\ninnocent person and that might violate --\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: When -- when did this\nnew evidence come to light?\nMR. COLE: The new evidence came to light some 6\nmonths after his plea was entered and after the sentence\nwas announced.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Did the other guy\nconfess to a -- kind of a jailhouse snitch?\nMR. COLE: To -- to a jailhouse informant, yes,\nYour Honor. And the prosecutor put that evidence on at\ntrial, at Wesley's trial, but it's interesting to note\nwhat he did with that evidence at Wesley's trial. He put\nit on but then in closing very expressly noted that while\nthere's been this evidence, even if you don't believe he's\nthe principal offender, you can still find him guilty of\naggravated murder.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But it is the case that he\nargued that -- that you should find him guilty because he\nwas the triggerman. I mean, that was an alternative\nargument. So the -- I mean, I think what's the -- the\nconcern following Justice Kennedy's question, the concern\nthat I have is not with the -- the guilt or innocence as\nsuch here. It's with the sentencing. And as -- it seems\nto me fair to say that as the record stands now, the State\nhas made two arguments: one that Stumpf was the\ntriggerman, one that Wesley was the triggerman. It has to\nbe the case that one of those arguments, if accepted,\nwould lead to a false result.\nAnd the question -- I think the due process\nquestion is whether the State can pursue those\ninconsistent arguments, even if it starts out innocently\ndoing it, but can it pursue two inconsistent arguments\nknowing that in one case the argument must be for a false\nresult, without there being any kind of -- of process to\ncorrect the State's inconsistent positions? What -- I\nmean, what's your response to that?\nMR. COLE: Well, Your Honor, first, I -- I don't\nthink they're -- he was without process. Mr. Stumpf had\nabundant process within the State system. He got all the\nevidence --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Oh, he could -- he could get\ninto court, but as I understand it, there was no\nrecognition here that there is -- that there is in fact\nsomething wrong with the two inconsistent -- or the two\narguments of the State, each of which, if accepted, will\nnecessarily result in one false conclusion.\nMR. COLE: Well, Your Honor, the -- again, the\nintermediate appellate court independently reweighed this\nevidence and concluded that even if we conclude that Mr.\nStumpf is not the shooter, even if that's our -- our\nconclusion -- it isn't, but even were we to conclude that,\nthe death penalty would still be appropriate here. So\nthere's been an independent reweighing of the evidence\nminus the mitigating evidence or minus the --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Maybe -- maybe that's enough.\nLet me, with respect to that, just ask you one final\nquestion. And I'm assuming the -- the answer, but I want\nto be sure.\nI assume that at the point of this intermediate\ncourt's reweighing, the intermediate court was aware of\nthe -- the evidence of -- of -- the hearsay evidence of\nWesley's confession and was aware that the State argued in\nthe second case that Wesley was the triggerman. Am I\ncorrect?\nMR. COLE: Yes, Your Honor. He -- the\nprosecutor, in fact, stipulated to the admissibility of\nthe Eastman and the Wesley evidence from Wesley's trial\nback into the Stumpf proceeding in the original trial\ncourt before the two judges -- the two of the three judges\nthat were remaining at that point, and then --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And -- and I take it also --\nMR. COLE: That was part of the record on\nappeal.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- stipulated or represented or\nadmitted, whatever, that in fact the State had argued in\nthe second case that Wesley was the triggerman.\nMR. COLE: I believe so, Your Honor. The\nindictment in Wesley's case included a specification that\nhe was the principal offender, so at the very least, the\nindictment would --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Because of being -- because of\nbeing the triggerman.\nMR. COLE: The only way to be the principal\noffender under that specification is to be the triggerman.\nSo that -- that's clear from the face of the indictment in\n-- in Wesley's case that the State had argued that.\nNow, the jury, importantly in Wesley's case,\nfound that he should be acquitted on that aggravating\ncircumstance. It's not an element of the crime, but it's\none of the aggravating circumstances that the State could\nrely on in seeking the death penalty in Wesley's case, and\nthe jury specifically rejected that aggravating\ncircumstance and -- and found that the State had not\nproved it beyond a reasonable doubt.\nThroughout the -- throughout the appellate\nprocess, with regard to the sentence, the State's attorney\nargued that, yes, there's evidence in the record from\nwhich you could conclude that he's the actual shooter, but\nin any event, it doesn't matter. And the -- the State's\nattorney was correct in that, as a matter of Ohio law,\naiders and abetters can both be found guilty of aggravated\nmurder under Ohio law and are subject to the death\npenalty.\nThe two -- the two aggravating circumstances --\nI'm sorry. The one aggravating circumstance that remained\nafter the plea deal turned merely on the reason why Mrs.\nStout had been put to death. It did not turn at all on\nwho was the person who put her to death. So as an\naccomplice, aider, and abetter, with liability for the\naggravated murder, he was also subject to the death\npenalty under that --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But, General Cole, isn't there\na distinction between eligibility for the death penalty\nand actually making the decision to impose the death\npenalty? And it's perfectly clear -- you're dead right,\nof course. He's eligible under either theory. But is it\nnot likely that the sentencer would be more likely to\nsentence the defendant to death if the sentencer thought\nhe had been the actual shooter?\nMR. COLE: I -- I think it's definitely a fact\nthat the court weighs, although here we have evidence that\nat least one Ohio court took that possibility into account\nand said even in light of that fact --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Right.\nMR. COLE: -- we still conclude that the death\nsentence is appropriate. So I don't know that we can say\nthat in this case it in any way would change the outcome.\nIn fact, the record --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, and the original\nsentencer might -- might not have done the same thing. We\ndon't really know that.\nMR. COLE: Well, this did go back in front of\nthe two -- two of the three original sentencers and they\ndeclined to allow him to vacate his sentence. The\nintermediate appellate court then independently reweighed\nand expressly said, whether he's the shooter or not, he's\neligible for the death sentence. So there have been a\nnumber of Ohio judges that have --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: As I understand the facts, even\nif he hadn't shot the wife to death, which was what the\nprosecution was for, he had tried to kill the husband,\nshooting him twice in the head?\nMR. COLE: Twice at the head from essentially\npoint-blank range, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: From point-blank range.\nMR. COLE: Right.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And then there was some\ndiscussion that the -- that the lying, seriously wounded\nhusband heard between the two perpetrators, and then there\nwas shooting of the wife. Whether he pulled the trigger\nor not, could that possibly make a difference? He did\npull the trigger trying to kill the husband. Is it\ndifficult to -- to think that -- that he willingly allowed\nhis -- his cohort to do the same to the wife? I -- I\ncan't imagine it would make any difference.\nMR. COLE: Your Honor, we agree and that\ncertainly falls well within the -- the range of\nculpability that this Court set out in Tyson as --\nJUSTICE BREYER: There's no doubt that they\ncould have -- the trier of fact could have reached the\nsame conclusion. But I guess the problem is that when you\ngo back to reopen the evidence the second time and the\njudges are sitting there, someone might have thought,\nwell, the husband didn't die, and we don't know if he\nactually pulled the trigger on the wife. And we're trying\nto guess what those judges would have done if they thought\nthat. I don't know. It could be that people don't want\nto impose capital punishment without thinking I know that\nthis person has killed somebody, and if that's so, they\nwouldn't have reached the same conclusion.\nNow, I guess that's the problem because at that\ntime on reopening, the State told that panel of judges\npretty clearly by implication that the State thought that\nthe evidence did support Stumpf having pulled the trigger,\neven though at that point the State knew and indeed\nreferred to the statement to -- you know, the confession\nand all the things in the second trial.\nNow, what do you think about that problem?\nMR. COLE: Well, first, Your Honor, I don't\nthink we have to guess what the judges would do because\nthe judges did what they did. They denied the motion to\nvacate and then --\nJUSTICE BREYER: They denied it, but as I read\nwhat the Ohio court said after the denial, I thought it\ndid probably rest upon their determination that Stumpf had\npulled the trigger.\nMR. COLE: And certainly the intermediate --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Did you think that?\nMR. COLE: Well, the intermediate appellate\ncourt expressly said that its determination did not turn\non who had pulled the trigger, that they would have\nreached the same conclusion independent of who pulled the\ntrigger.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But the panel -- the panel\nthat didn't reopen -- there was no reopening because they\ndenied the motion. But they didn't say one way or\nanother.\nJUSTICE BREYER: It's the Supreme Court of Ohio\nthat then I think I got my impression from, and of course,\nthey don't know either.\nMR. COLE: Well --\nJUSTICE BREYER: The fact is we don't know what\nthat original panel thought.\nMR. COLE: That's --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, it isn't that -- isn't\none of the answers to Justice Breyer's questions that you\n-- you never know exactly what a fact finder would do.\nWhat you have to deal with are reasonable likelihoods and\nreasonable possibilities.\nMR. COLE: That's --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And when -- and when you have\nsomeone who shoots the first person and is obviously\nattempting to kill him, and then there's an apparent\ndiscussion -- not -- not 100 percent clear that those were\nthe two voices. It's pretty clear because there were only\ntwo other people there. So we talk about reasonable\nlikelihoods, don't we?\nMR. COLE: I would think that's --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Absolutely right. Of course,\nthat's right. But we can't be sure what they would have\ndone, and because we can't be sure what they would have\ndone, I guess it might well have made a difference that\nthe State told that panel we think Stumpf pulled the trigger.\nMR. COLE: But --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And that's what gives rise to\nthe problem in the case.\nMR. COLE: But, Justice Breyer, I think it --\nit's always going to be the case that after a sentence is\nannounced, there's the possibility that new evidence might\ncome up that would cause us to say we can't know for sure\nwhat this panel would have done with that new evidence.\nAnd so there needs to be --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- the State say when it comes\nto the panel, the reopening panel, we'll tell you\nsomething. We think, indeed, that's what we argued, that\nthe State -- in the last case we argued that Stumpf didn't\npull the trigger, that the balance of evidence is against\nthat, but nonetheless, he should be sentenced to death.\nThat would make your position absolutely consistent with\nwhat you argued in that second trial with Mr. --\nMR. COLE: Mr. Wesley.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Mr. Wesley.\nMR. COLE: But, Your Honor, I'm not sure that\nthat would have been the State's position. I don't\nbelieve after the Wesley trial, that the balance of the\nevidence necessarily showed that Wesley was the shooter\nversus Stumpf. That was one person's testimony.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes. Now, the -- the jury in\nthe Wesley trial rejected that position.\nMR. COLE: They did, Your Honor, and Mr. Wesley\n-- it isn't as though all the new evidence is in Mr.\nStumpf's favor. Mr. Wesley, the only other eyewitness\nwho's testified, came and sat on the witness stand and\nsaid, yes, Mr. Stumpf pulled the trigger. At the end of\nthe day, the only two people who know exactly who pulled\nthe trigger are Mr. Wesley and Mr. Stumpf, and they have\nevery reason to point their finger at the other person.\nSo if that's --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay, but wait. Who did the --\nwho was the last person the State pointed its finger at?\nYou -- you told me in -- in response to earlier questions\nthat when the case back before the two remaining members\nof the panel, that in fact the State brought the -- called\nto their attention the fact that Wesley had confessed and\n-- and it was -- it was clear one way or another that --\nthat they had argued in Wesley's trial that he was the\ntriggerman.\nWhen they -- at that point when they are back\nbefore the two remaining members of the panel in Stumpf's\ncase, did the State say we now go back to our original\nposition that Stumpf was the triggerman and Wesley wasn't,\nor did they say we think -- we think Wesley is the\ntriggerman and Stumpf wasn't? Or did the State simply\nstand there agnostic?\nMR. COLE: The State -- and I would encourage\nthe Court to look at the State's response to that motion,\nwhich is in joint appendix at 126. But what the State\nsays on 126 is -- essentially there's a lot of agnosticism\nin the response. It says, look, there's this new\nevidence. We don't know. It seems like from this record\nyou could conclude that Stumpf was the shooter, but then\nthe State says even deleting that finding, even if you\ndon't agree with us, or even if you don't agree that's the\ncase, because the State isn't really saying this is our\nposition anymore, even if you delete that finding, there's\nstill sufficient evidence here to support a death penalty\nagainst Mr. Stumpf.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Could -- could I get one fact?\nWesley didn't confess or we don't know that he confessed.\nHe -- he said he wasn't the shooter at trial, didn't he?\nMR. COLE: That's correct, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But what was introduced was --\nwas the testimony of one of his jailhouse companions who\nsaid that Wesley had told him that he was the shooter. So\nwho was the shooter was -- was as much an issue in\nWesley's trial as it was in Stumpf's trial, wasn't it?\nMR. COLE: As the court expressly -- or as -- as\nthe State expressly noted in its closing in that case --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, but the State's position\nwas that the jailhouse informant had told the truth,\nwasn't it?\nMR. COLE: In closing --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: At the trial.\nMR. COLE: In -- in closing at that trial, Your\nHonor, the -- the prosecutor was relatively agnostic,\nfrankly. He said, look, you could conclude --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: He at least put in the\nevidence.\nMR. COLE: He -- he put in the evidence, and\nthen he said, look, from this evidence you could conclude\nthat Wesley was the shooter. You could also --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Normally you don't put in\nevidence unless you think it will support a proposition\nthat you -- that you're in favor of.\nMR. COLE: Well, and Your Honor, I -- I think if\nhe could show Wesley was the shooter, that would, of\ncourse, support a conviction against Wesley, but he\nrecognized that the jury didn't necessarily need to\nbelieve that, and in fact, he wasn't relying on that in\norder to secure the conviction.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: May I ask you one final\nquestion? As a matter of due process, why shouldn't the\nState -- after learning of the supposed admission in\nWesley, after taking Wesley's position, why shouldn't the\nState, when it gets back to the Stumpf case before the\nremaining two members of the panel, have to fish or cut\nbait on a position and say we think he's the triggerman\nand we want you to affirm on that basis, or we don't think\nhe was the triggerman because we've taken this other\nposition? Why can the State, as a matter of due process,\nstand there agnostic?\nMR. COLE: Because, Your Honor, the State is not\nthe fact finder. The judge is the fact finder. The State\nneeds to put the evidence in and allow counsel for the\ndefendant, counsel for the State to argue positions, and\nlet the fact finder make the ultimate determination.\nWith the Court's permission, I'd like to reserve\nthe rest of my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Very well, Mr. Cole.\nMr. Freedman, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF ALAN M. FREEDMAN\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. FREEDMAN: In light of the questioning, I'd\nlike to indicate what exactly was argued below and what\nwas the rulings. In -- in the first Stumpf trial, they --\nthey argued that there was, quote/unquote, ample evidence\nto point --\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Who is they?\nMR. FREEDMAN: The prosecutors. I'm sorry. Mr.\nChief Justice, and may it please the Court:\nThe prosecutors argued that there was ample\nevidence, quote/unquote, pointed --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Freedman, it wasn't a\ntrial. It was a -- it was a plea hearing.\nMR. FREEDMAN: That's correct, but there was --\nbut -- but in Ohio there's a requirement to have an actual\nprove-up of the aggravating factor itself. And they\nargued that there was ample evidence, quote/unquote,\npointed to Stumpf as the killer, and that's in joint\nappendix 186 to 187. Ultimately they -- and they urged\nthat he was the shooter.\nThen when the Wesley trial took place, at the\ntrial they did the same thing. They used the same terms,\nquote/unquote, ample evidence that Wesley was the shooter.\nThey urged a finding that Wesley was -- was the shooter.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I -- I thought the prosecutor\nin closing in the Wesley trial said, it could have been\nStumpf, but it doesn't make any difference.\nMR. FREEDMAN: They --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought they argued both?\nMR. FREEDMAN: That -- they really didn't argue\nboth. They -- they -- effect -- that was the throwaway\nargument. They came in there -- what -- what I think is\ncritical in both trials and later on in the proceedings is\nwhat they were urging, what they were recommending the --\nto the jury.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but it's at the bottom\nof page 187. We're on this same point. Given these\ncircumstances --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What -- what page is that?\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: 187 like the -- of the joint\nappendix. Given these circumstances, although we believe\nthe evidence does prove he was the shooter, I don't\nbelieve it makes any difference when you have two people\nacting in concert for the joint and unlawful purpose of\ncommitting an aggravating robbery. That's at the top of\n188.\nMR. FREEDMAN: But the -- but they urged. They\nrecommended. They didn't come in and say -- and\nthroughout this proceeding -- we don't know who the\nshooter is. We don't care who the shooter is. They both\ndeserve the death penalty. They -- they were -- the\nprosecutors were aware that the -- the death penalty is\nwhat stirs the pot here, and so they were urging somebody\nto be the shooter to get the death penalty. If this\nwasn't a death penalty case, I don't think they -- it\nwould have mattered who killed who. And so they were\nurging --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I think there's quite a\ndifference in -- in case A where you say our position is\nthat Stumpf was the shooter, pure and simple. That's it.\nIn case B, they say we think Stumpf was the shooter.\nWe're not 100 percent sure, but he should get the death\npenalty. The alternative is before the sentencer and the\nsentencer can make that determination.\nMR. FREEDMAN: But -- but they took the position\nof actually urging, making a recommendation. I -- I don't\nthink there would be a due process violation if they said,\nwe don't know. They didn't take that. They -- they urged\na position, and I think that's the key factor when the --\nin this case.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What -- what was the due\nprocess violation here? You're talking about due process\nin the second trial, in --\nMR. FREEDMAN: The due process violation, Your\nHonor, would be --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Was in the first trial?\nMR. FREEDMAN: No, of course, it wasn't in\nthe first trial.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But that's the trial that\nyou're trying to get set aside here.\nMR. FREEDMAN: We submit that the due process\nerror is at the motion to vacate. At that time, again,\nafter taking the position that Wesley was the shooter,\nthey came back and urged that -- that Stumpf was the\nshooter, that the record was ample enough to support\nStumpf being the shooter --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it was. They're --\nthey're just -- they're just arguing that the evidence we\nintroduced supported the jury verdict. What -- what is\nwrong with arguing that? There's --\nMR. FREEDMAN: Because they've taken\ninconsistent positions. The -- the violation here is in\nthe positions itself, not in necessarily the results.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Not -- not if they said in the\nsecond trial it doesn't matter whether he's the shooter.\nMR. FREEDMAN: I think they did more than it\ndidn't -- it just didn't matter. I think they urged the\nposition. It would -- I mean, a lot of the cases in the\nlower courts have made that distinction when the -- when\nthe State comes in and says, we don't know what happens.\nWe can't tell you who the shooter is or not, and we don't\ncare who the shooter is.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose the State had said on\nmotion for resentencing in Stumpf's trial, Your Honor, we\ntook the position that Wesley was the shooter in Wesley's\ntrial. The jury disbelieved that. We accept the jury's\nverdict. Our position now is that -- that Stumpf was the\nshooter. We've learned from the jury verdict in the\nWesley trial. We've had 12 people. They heard the\nevidence. We'll accept that. Any difference in that case\nand what we have here?\nMR. FREEDMAN: It's different, but that's not\nwhat happened. It's different if they've taken -- if\nthey've taken the position --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: It -- it would -- in the case\nI put, would your argument be the same, and if so, why?\nMR. FREEDMAN: I -- I put it that it's not the\nsame because they -- first of all, in reality, that's not\nwhat they did. But let's talk in terms of the\nhypothetical that -- that you've asked me. It is that you\nhave to also look at what actually happened in the Wesley\ntrial to determine due process for Stumpf because Wesley\n-- what happened in this case through the whole circular\nreasoning, Wesley didn't get the death penalty here\nbecause they were informed that Stumpf pled guilty, was\nfound to be the principal offender, and was sentenced to\ndeath. Now --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: That was introduced by\nWesley, not by the prosecution.\nMR. FREEDMAN: That's correct. The prosecution\nin the Wesley trial originally did not want the -- the\njury to hear at all what happened in Stumpf's trial. They\nwanted to argue the complete -- that -- that Stumpf's\nverdict was not even -- should be informed. The sentence\nof death shouldn't be informed or the sentence of death.\nAnd in fact, that's when they started to throw in a little\nbit of the alternative theory after that evidence did\nsubsequently get in. The record shows that they\noriginally did not get it in and they allowed the defense\ncounsel -- prevented defense from getting -- in the Wesley\ntrial from getting in the evidence of the Stumpf trial.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Freedman, you're trying\nto read back now into what apparently you recognize is --\nis not a flawed initial sentencing hearing.\nMR. FREEDMAN: That's correct.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And it might be more\npersuasive if the trier were a jury when the motion to\nvacate is made, but these are judges whose business it is\nto preside over these kinds of cases. They presided over\nthat first hearing and now the same prosecutor -- was the\nsame prosecutor in both?\nMR. FREEDMAN: That's correct, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Comes back to them and says,\njudges, don't vacate the sentence that you yourself\nentered. It's -- given that we're dealing with\nsophisticated judges, the same panel in both episodes,\nit's a little hard to -- to see where the due process\nviolation is.\nMR. FREEDMAN: The due process violation is that\nat the minimum, assuming that -- that a weighing is even\nappropriate here, they never weighed it, and clearly any\nindication that there was a waiver -- a -- a weighing of\nwhether Mr. Stumpf would be put to death as an aider and\nabetter. They never took Eastman's testimony as true and\n-- and the prosecution's position as true, and then\nultimately said it would make no difference.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, they didn't have to take\nit as true. As I understand it, when they went back\nbefore the -- the two original judges on the motion to\nvacate, they didn't have to take the -- the testimony\nabout the jailhouse admission as true, and they didn't\nhave to take the State's position at the Wesley trial as\ntrue. It was evidence. It was before them. They were in\n-- they were required to consider it.\nBut as I understand it, the State at that point\nessentially was -- was agnostic. The State said, you\nknow, this is what happened, this is what we said, this is\nwhat the jury did in the second trial, but regardless of\nhow you determine -- of -- of any determination about\ntriggerman, this man Stumpf still deserves death, so don't\nvacate the sentence.\nAnd -- and there was nothing I guess -- number\none, there doesn't seem to be at that point a -- a problem\nwith the State taking inconsistent positions, i.e., with\nits position in -- in the -- in the Wesley case, and there\ndoesn't seem to be any -- any lack of candor. There may\nbe a -- a lack of initiative on the State's part to fish\nor cut bait, but there's no lack of candor. So where does\nthe due process violation come at that point?\nMR. FREEDMAN: We submit the due process\nviolation comes at the time of the motion to vacate. We\nurge -- we're urging that they've not take an agnostic\nposition as prosecutors. They're -- they're urging again\nsaying the -- the evidence is ample to support that --\nthat Stumpf was -- was the shooter.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But it -- I mean, that -- that\nstatement is true, I take it.\nMR. FREEDMAN: But -- but they're also urging a\nposition. The State at some point should take a position\non what the evidence is. At that position -- at that\npoint, after urging that Mr. Wesley is the shooter, they\n-- were they untrue? Were they -- I mean, the prosecutors\nat that point maybe then -- if they were believing that --\nthat Eastman was testifying truthfully, why wouldn't they\nnow believe that he was testifying truthfully now in the\nmotion to vacate?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, because it seems to me\nthey -- they would have two arguments. One is even if he\nwasn't the shooter, you -- you should -- you would have\nimposed the death penalty anyway, but argument number two\nis, wait a minute. You know, yes, we -- we don't know who\nthe shooter is but there's a -- there was no violation of\ndue process here. There was plenty of evidence for you to\nfind that he was the shooter. That evidence is still\nthere. Do you expect them to throw away that argument? I\nmean, it's -- it's very true and it goes to whether this\nconviction and sentence deserve to be set aside.\nMR. FREEDMAN: We -- we proffer to the Court\nthat they shouldn't be taking inconsistent positions as to\n-- in a death penalty case in the sentencing --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What should -- what -- was\nWesley then denied due process? Because at the time of\nStumpf's initial plea hearing, Eastman hadn't appeared and\nthere was only Stumpf's testimony that he was not the\ntriggerman and the prosecutor's evidence that he was.\nThen we get to Wesley, and Eastman shows up.\nThe prosecutors have already taken the position that\nStumpf was the triggerman. Is Wesley denied due process\nbecause they're taking inconsistent positions at his\ntrial?\nMR. FREEDMAN: I -- I don't believe that Wesley\nwas denied due process. They discovered the evidence\nafterwards and ultimately at that trial they had -- the\nWesley jury had the opportunity to hear what happened in\nthe Stumpf trial, and they were able to weigh that case\nalong with the evidence of the Stumpf finding and sentence\nof death and the finding that he was the principal\noffender. That's something we submit has not happened in\nthis death penalty case.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, do you concede that the\nevidence presented in the Stumpf proceeding was sufficient\nto support a finding of guilt as an aider and abetter?\nWas there enough evidence that the fact finder could so\nfind?\nMR. FREEDMAN: Without the Wesley evidence, I --\nI -- at the initial trial, I certainly would concede that.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Right, right.\nMR. FREEDMAN: As -- as to -- as to whether the\nevidence that you learn from the Wesley trial -- that's a\nmuch closer question because the -- the aggravating factor\nin this case --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: She asked as aider or abetter,\nnot as shooter.\nMR. FREEDMAN: Okay, all right. I'm just --\nthat's correct.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: And as to that, it seems to\nme the guilty plea can stand and the only question that,\nit seems to me, I would have would be with the sentencing,\nand I'm not sure that has to be overturned.\nMR. FREEDMAN: Well --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: So it would help to focus on\nthat.\nMR. FREEDMAN: I --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Did you address, on behalf of\nStumpf, some allegation that he has to be resentenced?\nMR. FREEDMAN: That's correct, and that's what\nthe Sixth Circuit --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Is that still before us?\nMR. FREEDMAN: That -- that is correct.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Or has that been subsumed\nsomehow?\nMR. FREEDMAN: No. That's before you. In fact,\nthere's a -- there's a question of whether they even\nchallenge that. But clearly, that the sentence by the\nSixth -- the sentence was challenged by the Sixth Circuit\nand found to be defective and a violation of due -- of due\nprocess, and that's in the cert --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I thought a State appellate\ncourt had effectively reweighed and effectively\nresentenced, saying that this additional evidence would,\nin our view, have made no difference. And we -- we allow\nthat to happen all the time. We speculate as to what the\n-- what the sentencer would have done had an invalid\nfactor not been there. I mean, when -- when a -- an\naggravating factor is -- is invalidated, the State supreme\ncourt can determine, you know, whether the same sentence\nof death would have been imposed even without that\naggravating factor. Why is this any different?\nMR. FREEDMAN: Well -- well, I'd like to ask --\nanswer that in two ways. First, the -- we would submit\nthat a reweighing isn't necessary. This is not like\nvacating an aggravating factor. This is determining a\nconstitutional error of due process.\nBut let's assume for the moment that reweighing\nis -- is adequate. There was no reweighing, proper\nreweighing, in either the appellate court or the Ohio\nSupreme Court.\nThe -- the appellate court, which is the\nintermediate court in Ohio, came out and said both Wesley\nand Stumpf were principal slayers as if they were both\nshooters. And the whole opinion is hinged on the\nassumption that Mr. Stumpf pled guilty to being the\nshooter. If you -- I mean, that's -- we submit that's\njust a fair reading of the opinion.\nAnd also, if you go to their main opinion, which\nis the final opinion, which this Court reviews, the Ohio\nSupreme Court -- they did the same circular reasoning.\nUltimately they said he pled guilty. He was the shooter,\nand therefore, Eastman's testimony will have little weight\nas hearsay to -- to vacate the death sentence. They never\nindependently weighed the case saying, let's take Eastman\nas true, let's look at this case as an aider and\nabetter --\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: What is your best\ncase, Mr. Freedman, for the idea that an inconsistency,\nsuch as you say was present here, is a violation of due\nprocess?\nMR. FREEDMAN: The best case we cite in our\nbrief is Green v. Georgia.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Which one?\nMR. FREEDMAN: Green v. Georgia where they came\nin with inconsistent positions.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Freedman, you've -- you've\nargued just a second ago that both of the appellate courts\ndecided the case or went through so-called reweighing on a\nfalse premise that he had pleaded guilty to being the\nshooter. Let me go back to the -- to the two remaining\nmembers of the original trial panel. I take it they did\nnot make that -- in your judgment that error.\nMR. FREEDMAN: In all candor, I don't know.\nThere's no finding. They simply said denied.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yes.\nLet me -- let me ask you what your position\nwould be if a hypothetical Justice Kennedy suggested\nearlier in the argument were true. What if the State had\ngone back at the -- at the hearing before the original two\nin response to the motion to vacate and had said, we did\nargue in the Wesley case that he was the triggerman? The\njury rejected that argument. They found that -- that he\nwas not. We've -- we've learned from -- from our own\nexperience and -- and we now no longer think that -- that\nthe evidence from the jailhouse informant should be\naccepted. We're back to the position that we took in the\n-- at the Stumpf sentencing hearing originally, that --\nthat he was the triggerman. If the State had taken that\nposition, would you have a due process claim?\nMR. FREEDMAN: On -- on this -- on this record,\nwe would have a due process claim for twofold. We submit\nthat the -- that the error is in the attempt not\nnecessarily the success, and particularly in the --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I'm -- I'm not getting it.\nWhat do you mean?\nMR. FREEDMAN: I mean -- I mean, it's -- it's\nthat they honestly believed that Wesley -- that in the\nWesley trial, that Eastman testified truthfully. They\nbelieved that.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, can't they -- can't they\nprofit from the jury's verdict?\nMR. FREEDMAN: Perhaps, but not in this\nparticular case because what the jury weighed in Wesley\nwas not only Eastman's testimony, they weighed the fact\nthat Stumpf pled guilty, was found to be the principal\noffender, and was sentenced to death. That's a -- I mean,\nthat's going to lead to -- I -- I -- maybe I'm off base\nhere, but that's going to lead a jury to come out in a\nconclusion to find Wesley the aider and abetter and not --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: The jury simply decided they\ndidn't want to sentence two people to death for the same\noffense.\nMR. FREEDMAN: Right. I mean, they already had\nthe principal offender. They already had somebody\nsentenced to death for it.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Can I ask you a procedural\nquestion here? When I read the -- the Ohio Supreme Court\nopinion, my impression of their due process part of it is\nthat they found a violation because of the inconsistency\nbetween the Wesley trial and the Stumpf sentencing\nproceeding. When you started to talk to Justice Scalia,\nyou agreed that couldn't be right. Rather, you said there\nis an inconsistency between what the prosecutor said at\nthe Wesley trial and what the prosecutor said when Stumpf\nmade his motion to vacate.\nNow, if that's so, I'm not sure that the Ohio\nSupreme Court or the lower courts have addressed that\nquestion to determine whether they really were\ninconsistent, and if so, what or why or what difference it\nmade. But I haven't read the record thoroughly, and my\nimpression might be wrong. So I'd appreciate your telling\nme what are the facts there.\nMR. FREEDMAN: They -- they argued generally in\n-- in the record, and it was -- it was somewhat cryptic.\nThey argued that it was unfair --\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. Who is they?\nMR. FREEDMAN: I'm sorry. I apologize. The --\nthe defense counsel.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I'm not interested in what\ndefense counsel did or did not say. I'm interested in\nwhat the Ohio courts did or did not say.\nMR. FREEDMAN: Thank you.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And my point there is my -- do\nI repeat it or do you have it?\nMR. FREEDMAN: I have it now, yes.\nThe -- the Ohio -- the Ohio Supreme Court simply\n-- simply used -- simply used some sort of circular\nreasoning. They -- they hung to the position that Stumpf\nwas the shooter, and then after that --\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. Let's go to the\ncircuit court of appeals. When I read the decision of the\ncircuit court of appeals in the due -- what -- what am I\nreading, which is -- this is in the Sixth Circuit Court of\nAppeals.\nMR. FREEDMAN: Okay.\nJUSTICE BREYER: They went on both grounds,\nfirst the confession -- sorry -- the guilty plea, and\nsecond, the inconsistency. Now, there I thought that the\nSixth Circuit Court of Appeals was -- now, I think I\nmisspoke because I think that's where I see the problem.\nMR. FREEDMAN: Okay.\nJUSTICE BREYER: You understand what the problem\nis or shall I --\nMR. FREEDMAN: Yes, I see it. You want to know\nsomewhere in the Sixth Circuit opinion?\nJUSTICE BREYER: The Sixth Circuit seemed to be\naddressing the inconsistency between the sentencing\nproceeding of Stumpf and the Wesley trial. Well, you say\nthe inconsistency we should focus upon is between the\nWesley trial and the motion to vacate. And I think you're\nright about that because I can't imagine the other being a\nproblem.\nMR. FREEDMAN: I -- I -- maybe I should clarify.\nI -- I think that you have to compare the Wesley trial\nwith the Stumpf trial.\nJUSTICE BREYER: It's relevant in terms of\nevidence, but I think you're asking us to say that there\nis a due process violation because of the inconsistency\nbetween what the prosecutor said at the Wesley trial and\nwhat the prosecutor said when Stumpf made his motion to\nvacate. Am I right?\nMR. FREEDMAN: That's correct.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. I'm asking you if\nthe Sixth Circuit or the Ohio courts has addressed that\nquestion.\nMR. FREEDMAN: I'm uncertain. I -- I think they\ndid it in a generic fashion.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So I read this. You can't\npoint to anything in which they have addressed that\nquestion. My quick reading of it -- I couldn't find\nanything in which they addressed that question. And if\nthat's so, what should we do?\nMR. FREEDMAN: Well, as an -- as an alternative,\nthe Court could remand back to have the Sixth Circuit --\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Did you raise that\nargument before the Sixth Circuit, the one that you're\nmaking now?\nMR. FREEDMAN: With absolute certainty, Mr.\nChief Justice, yes, because they asked the same questions.\nThey asked where did the error occur, and that the line of\nthe questionings were almost -- on that point was\nidentical. They asked questions where did the error come,\nand of course, it wasn't in the first trial. The error\noccurred at the motion to vacate.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What if -- what if Wesley comes\nin with a -- with a motion to vacate now and -- and he\npoints to the inconsistency with the -- with the Stumpf\ntrial? Would he also be entitled to get his sentence\nvacated because of the same inconsistency that you're\npointing out?\nMR. FREEDMAN: Well, he certainly wouldn't have\nthe death sentence. That was -- is solely as to the guilt\npart of the case, Justice Scalia?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes.\nMR. FREEDMAN: He might. He might because the\n-- the -- I mean --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So a jury, having found both of\nthem guilty beyond a reasonable doubt and possibly on a\nbasis that -- or not a jury but the judges and possibly on\na basis that has nothing to do with whether they were the\nshooter, you think both of them are entitled to have the\ndeath sentence vacated. I think that's extraordinary.\nMR. FREEDMAN: Well, in all due respect, only\none has the sentence --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Which one? I mean, doesn't\nWesley have just as much of a complaint as your client\ndoes?\nMR. FREEDMAN: Not -- not as to the death -- not\nas to -- not as to the death sentence, no.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why?\nMR. FREEDMAN: Why? One, he didn't -- let's\nassume arguendo that he received the death sentence. He\nhad an opportunity --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: I thought Wesley didn't\nreceive a death sentence.\nMR. FREEDMAN: No, he did not. That's what --\nbut you --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No. That's -- that's my\nmistake.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. He didn't receive the --\nthe death penalty. What would his argument be with\nrespect to guilt or innocence? It seems to me that the\nissue only goes to penalty.\nMR. FREEDMAN: There's still an issue out there\nbecause this is killing a witness. As -- he would have a\ntougher role. I don't think Wesley would -- would have\nmuch of a chance. The -- the version of Mr. Stumpf's\nfacts, whether it's a difficult row to hoe is that he --\nhe drops the gun. That was one of the -- and -- and\nshortly leaves the scene after that. So that he --\nthere's no intent, notwithstanding Justice Scalia's\nposition that you -- attempt to shoot Mr. Stout, that he's\nautomatically -- the specific intent is inferred. But\nit's not absolutely clear, leaving the scene, that the\nintent could be inferred to kill another witness.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But that's Stumpf's case.\nMR. FREEDMAN: Yes, that's correct.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yes. So I mean --\nMR. FREEDMAN: So I'm saying that he would\nnot --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I don't see where Wesley --\nMR. FREEDMAN: No, Wesley would not have --\nWesley would not have that scenario under --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So -- so Wesley would have\nneither a -- a due process claim with respect to sentence\nnor with respect to guilt.\nMR. FREEDMAN: That's correct. That's correct.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But now your -- your part\nabout the guilt, the Sixth Circuit agreed with you because\nit vacated not only the sentence, but the conviction. And\nwhat is your argument that the conviction is infirm?\nMR. FREEDMAN: And -- and what they -- they\ndeduced from that is that the -- the evidence of the\nWesley trial -- their position is that -- and the position\nthat -- that the prosecutor took and the evidence that\nEastman took, that there would be no specific intent as to\nthe killing of -- of Mary Jane Stout inferred from the\nshooting of Norman Stout because he dropped the gun. I\nmean, you don't -- but there's no -- in -- in Ohio a plan\nis required. There's no foreseeability or reckless\ndisregard for the death -- for the eligibility for the\ndeath penalty. It's one of the few States.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I -- I thought the -- the\nspecific intent element would be satisfied if -- if they,\nby plan, went to the scene with -- with deadly weapons.\nMR. FREEDMAN: I believe under Ohio law that\nthat's not correct. I mean, it's one of the few States.\nAnd I believe even the cases that are cited by the State\nwould infer that.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought the State argued\nthat knowledge -- that there's this plan, and they had a\ncommon design to rob. Is that right? And then the State\nsaid that common design plus knowledge that an inherently\ndangerous instrument would be employed to perpetuate the\nfelony or that the felony and its manner of accomplishment\nwould be reasonably likely to produce death. That's what\nthe State argued was the law of Ohio.\nMR. FREEDMAN: But I -- I believe that they\nneeded a plan for -- for the killing of a witness. They\nneeded that plan at the time for killing the witness.\nIt's not enough just to plan the robbery for the specific\nintent.\nAnd -- and they -- in the Wesley trial, I want\nto refer you to page --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Did -- did any judge say\nthat, any judge on the Sixth Circuit say that that was the\nOhio law?\nMR. FREEDMAN: I believe so. That's my reading\nof the Sixth Circuit opinion. They said that there was an\nelement of -- of intent that was -- I believe that's the\n-- the way I interpret the holding.\nI would like to refer you just to page 295 of\nthe joint appendix, even the last sentence or so in the\nfirst paragraph. They imply that in the Wesley trial,\ntalking about the same scenario, that there's not\nnecessarily a plan coming in to kill the witnesses. There\nwould have to be a plan while they're in the house. And\n-- and the scenario of Mr. Stumpf dropping the gun I\nbelieve is arguably that there's no specific intent.\nI -- I would just like to sum up and indicate\nthat -- that the State argued in both cases urging the\ndeath of two individuals based on killing the same person,\nand ultimately there was not adequate review in Mr.\nStumpf's case indicating that he would have gotten the\ndeath penalty notwithstanding Eastman's testimony,\nnotwithstanding their position that he would have gotten\nthe death penalty as an aider and abetter, which is a\nrather rare circumstance not only in Ohio but also in this\ncountry.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr.\nFreedman.\nMr. Cole, you have 3 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DOUGLAS R. COLE\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. COLE: Justice Ginsburg, to respond to your\nquestion, under Ohio law you do not need to -- to plan to\nkill the witness in order to have specific intent for\naggravated murder. I would refer the Court to the In re\nWashington and State v. Scott cases that we cite in our\nbrief that say that participation in an aggravated robbery\nwhere that's going to be done through force or violence or\nin a manner reasonably likely to result in death is\nsufficient to support a -- an intent -- a -- an inference\nof specific intent. So there's -- there's no need to find\nthat they planned to kill the witnesses.\nIf -- if I heard Mr. Freedman correctly, he\nadmitted that Wesley would not have a due process argument\nhere because he said the fact finders were apprised of Mr.\nStumpf's proceedings. Well, exactly the same is true in\nMr. Stumpf's case. As soon as that testimony became\navailable, as soon as Mr. -- as the prosecutor had\nknowledge of Mr. Eastman's testimony, that testimony was\nthen placed back in the record for further proceedings in\nthe Stumpf matter. The prosecutor made arguments, but I\ndon't think that the Due Process Clause requires --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: You -- you mean at the hearing\non the motion to vacate.\nMR. COLE: Hearing on the motion to vacate and\nfurther appellate review.\nI don't think the Due Process Clause requires\nthe State to admit the ultimate truth of everything that\nMr. Eastman testified to at that other trial. The\nquestion was did they have a good faith basis for putting\nhim on, and they did. And did they have a good faith\nbasis then for arguing that notwithstanding what he said,\nthat the conviction and the sentence in Mr. Stumpf's case\nwere appropriate? And I believe the record supports that\nthey did have a good faith basis for making that argument.\nIf we look at the arguments they made, they were\narguments in the nature of, look, there's this evidence in\nthe record. You may believe it, you may not. Either way,\nMr. Stumpf is correctly eligible for the death sentence\nunder Ohio law and that sentence is appropriate. And the\ncourts found, based on that argument, that Mr. Stumpf had\nappropriately been sentenced to death.\nThis Court has noted that the principal function\nof habeas is to assure that no man has been incarcerated\nunder a procedure which creates an impermissibly large\nrisk that an innocent person will be convicted. Well, we\ndon't have that risk here. Stumpf has knowingly and\nvoluntarily pled guilty, removing any risk about that.\nAnd if we look to this sentencing hearing, there's no risk\nthat he received an impermissibly large sentence because\nthe prosecutor made the evidence available, and Stumpf's\ncounsel used that evidence and argued it, and the court\nsimply rejected it.\nIf the Court has no further questions, I'll\nstop. Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr. Cole.\n"
