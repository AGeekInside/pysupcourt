KOCH\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. KOCH: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nMr. Watson's receipt of a firearm in\nexchange for drugs does not constitute the use of that\nfirearm as the word \"use\" is employed by 18 U.S.C.\nSection 924(c)(1) for two principal reasons. First,\napplying the plain and ordinary meaning of the word\n\"use,\" the receipt of a thing is not the use of that\nthing. There is no grammatically proper way to say that\nsomeone uses a firearm when all that person does is\nreceive it.\nSecond, treating receipt as use under the\nstatute conflicts with this Court's decision in Bailey\nv. United States, which held that use requires active\nemployment. And I'll address those two points in turn.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Would you address first\nwhether receipt of the gun constitutes possession of the\ngun?\nMR. KOCH: Yes, ma'am. I believe receipt\ndoes constitute possession. However, of course,\npossession standing alone under this Court's decision in\nBailey does not constitute use.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But under the statute as\namended, possession is also indictable.\nMR. KOCH: Possession in furtherance of the\noffense is -- is -- would be indictable. That -- that\nwas not charged in this particular case. And I would\nsuggest that the -- that the circumstances of this case\nmight not call that into -- into play simply because his\npossession really was -- was incidental, and it was\nfollowing the conclusion of the drug transaction.\nSo I think -- I question whether the\npossession in furtherance would necessarily apply here.\nOf course, it was not charged.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I'm not sure.\nI have the same question as Justice Ginsburg. It seems\nto me, absent some precedents which narrows this\ndefinition, that that would have been the way to charge\nyour client. That's not what was charged; that's not\nthe indictment; that's not what you're arguing. So I\nguess the question is more appropriate for the\ngovernment.\nBut, if, following Justice Ginsburg's\nquestion, this covers it, and it seems to me that it\ndoes, then we're not arguing about very much.\nMR. KOCH: I understand, Your Honor. My\nonly point, again, would be, that recognizing that \"in\nfurtherance,\" at least by the authors of that language,\nwould suggest it to mean something more than \"in\nrelation to,.\" I think the question could legitimately\nbe asked in a -- in a transaction like this, where the\npossession basically is what he was attempting to\nachieve and did, in fact, achieve, but after the -- at\nthe end transaction.\nI don't -- I can't answer whether or not,\nultimately, that would be -- deemed to be in furtherance\nor not.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Koch, let's say\nthat the parties to the transaction are concerned about\navoiding exposure under the money-laundering statute,\nand so they got together and said: All right, we are\ngoing to have this deal. What can we use besides money?\nAnd they say: Well, let's use guns, or let's use a gun.\nAnd the seller of the drugs says: Okay. I'm willing to\nuse that.\nIsn't he using the gun in furtherance of the\ntransaction?\nMR. KOCH: I don't believe that the -- that,\ngiven what the -- what this Court has said in Bailey,\nthat that would constitute active employment still. The\n--\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's being actively\nemployed as the consideration in the sale.\nMR. KOCH: However, the -- from the\nstandpoint --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's not being shot,\nbut it's still being employed.\nMR. KOCH: Yes, sir. From the standpoint of\nthe -- of the seller -- from the standpoint of the drug\nseller, who's ultimately still doing nothing more with\nrespect to the gun, I think the focus has to be on what\nare his activities? He hasn't even come into possession\nof it in the example that Your Honor has given.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But I think it would\nbe a natural, grammatical construction to say he's\nwilling to use the gun for the consideration.\nMR. KOCH: Your Honor, I'm not certain that\nwe would -- that we -- that it could be held in the\nabsence even there of even possession -- whether or not\nthat would be enough to constitute the use. That would\nbe the first question that would occur to me. The --\ncertainly grammatically, and dealing, of course, with\nthe facts of this case, grammatically the question on\nthe table is: When interpreting 18 U.S.C. Section\n924(c)(1) giving it, as this Court held in Smith, its\nplain and ordinary meaning, the example that was used by\nthe D.C. Circuit in United States v. Stewart, I thought,\nwas appropriate, where -- the coffee shop example, where\nyou have the -- the individual buying the coffee, and\nyou have the cashier.\nThe -- the customer doesn't -- the customer\ncomes in and pays with the dollar. The cashier accepts\nthe dollar, but the cafeteria isn't using the dollar by\nreceiving it as payment. It's just receiving it.\nLikewise, the customer isn't using the coffee through\nthe act of receiving it. He's getting it.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, if we look at this\ntransaction, a guns-for-drugs transaction, is there --\ncan you think of any good reason why Congress would want\nto prescribe a 5-year penalty for the person who hands\nover the gun, but not any penalty for the person who\nreceives the gun and hands over the drugs?\nMR. KOCH: I do think that there are\ndistinctions between the two conducts, sir. First of\nall, certainly the person that -- that has the gun and\nis bringing it into that transaction I would suggest, as\na practical matter presents a different type of risk.\nHe's got the gun. He's in control of it. He's going to\ndecide when and if to hand it over and in what condition\nit would be when he hands it over, or not to hand it\nover at all. So that the --\nJUSTICE ALITO: And so that the -- the risk\nis Congress was worried that somebody would go to a\ntransaction like this with a gun originally intending to\ntrade it for drugs and then when one person gets there,\na person decides to shoot somebody with the gun?\nMR. KOCK: I think --\nJUSTICE ALITO: And that's why they would\npenalize one side of this transaction and not the other?\nMR. KOCH: Well, assuming of course it would\n-- in Smith the Court held that that is a use within the\nterm of the statute. I think that the -- looking at --\nthis does not do violence to this Court's decision in\nBailey. There still has to be some active employment.\nThe person on the drug end of the transaction is --\nreally has nothing to do with the gun, doesn't even\npossess the gun, which -- before the other party decides\nto hand it over.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: In Smith, the Court said\nthat the reason that selling the gun in exchange for\ndrugs -- what was dangerous about that was the potential\nfor instantly converting the gun from currency to a\ncannon. But here isn't that even all the more of\nconcern because one who receives the gun can instantly\nturn it around and shoot the drug seller?\nMR. KOCH: He could if the gun was handed\nover in a condition -- first of all, there -- were there\nbullets or not? That's going to be up to, at the first\ninstance, whether he brings them or not, the gun seller.\nThe gun seller can decide whether to hand it over --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But it's the same on both\nsides. It seems to me in both cases there is a risk of\nusing the gun. The one who comes in with the gun can\nuse it; the one who receives the gun can use it.\nMR. KOCH: I will -- I will grant Your Honor\nthere's obviously risk presented by the presence of the\ngun potentially by either party. I would suggest that,\nas between the two parties, the fellow that shows up\nwith the gun who's going to decide when and if to hand\nit over and in what condition, cocked, uncocked, loaded\nor unloaded, et cetera, is in somewhat more control.\nAll that being said, one still gets back to\nthe central point, which is, regardless of Congress's\npurpose or desires here, they still chose words that had\nfairly common meanings, in this case \"use.\" And very --\nit's grammatically impossible, I'd suggest, in the\nstraightforward transaction and trade situation to\nsuggest that the guy that's receiving the gun is using\nit by receiving it, any more than the cashier is using\nthe dollar that I pay for the cup of coffee with.\nJUSTICE ALITO: If the person who hands over\nthe gun is not a government agent or informant, is there\nany doubt that the person who hands over the drugs can\nbe charged with using the -- the gun under 18 U.S.C.\nSection 2(b)? He causes -- the person who hands over\nthe gun, to do something that is a crime.\nMR. KOCH: I do think that there -- that's\nan issue that's been raised. I -- I question whether,\nwhen the underlying offense itself is the transaction\nand these are the only two parties, whether or not\naiding and abetting liability would be intended to\nextend that far, any more than it would be, for example,\nto a drug purchaser being charged with aiding and\nabetting the distribution of drugs.\nCertainly, given the severe penalties\ninvolved, I -- I'm a little uncomfortable with that\nbeing a usage of that statute or usage of the aiding and\nabetting statute. I also would point out that the\noverwhelming majority of these cases do involve police\ninformants, practically all of them.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, you're relying on the\nlanguage of 924. If you look at the language of 2(b),\nis there any doubt that this situation would fall\nsquarely under it? \"Whoever willfully causes an act to\nbe done which if directly performed by him would be an\noffense against the United States is punishable as a\nprincipal.\"\nMR. KOCH: That is what that statute says,\nsir. There is some jurisprudence, and I'm -- it may be\nolder in nature -- that deals with two parties to a\ntransaction and whether or not aiding and abetting\nliability can be used, again going back to my drug\npurchaser situation. And I question whether or not the\n-- the aiding and abetting statute can be used. It\nwould basically, in the drug context, read out the\npossession statute. Every drug buyer could be charged\nwith distribution as a principal under Section 2. The\n-- again, of course that's not charged here, and I've\nnot -- I've not seen cases where that has been charged.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Subsection (b) is\nnot charged in the indictment?\nMR. KOCH: 18 U.S.C. Section 2 was what I\nunderstood the question to be, Judge. I apologize.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No. But that was\nnot charged in the indictment?\nMR. KOCH: No, sir.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Section 2(b)?\nMR. KOCH: It was not.\nNow, the -- the government's brief concedes\nit would not be natural to say that the customer in my\nexample with the coffee used the coffee. Unless we're\nprepared to discard that standard usage of words and\nsacrifice it for the purpose that we believe Congress\nintended, then I think that the analysis really does\nstop there if one's reading the language of the statute\nand applying it.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Koch, but the\ngovernment answers that, a dollar for coffee, by saying\nit depends what question you ask. So if you ask was the\ncoffee part of a beverage transaction, the answer would\nbe of course yes.\nMR. KOCH: One of the problems --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: This is a gun\ntransaction.\nMR. KOCH: Yes, ma'am. One of the problems\nI think that that raises that I see in different\ncontexts with this is the different ways that the word\n\"use\" is used in an active or passive context. One\nmight see two people to that transaction and ask, is a\ndollar being used in that transaction? And I think that\nwe would all fairly say yes. But the focus in 924(c) is\non that defendant: Did he use it? Just in the coffee\nshop example, did the cashier use the dollar? Or in my\nexample, did Mr. Watson use the firearm? And I think\nthat that's -- that's the question that needs to be\nasked and when that question is asked in that format,\nthen the answer I suggest is no.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I don't remember whether\nyou ask in your brief as an alternative argument for the\noverruling of Smith.\nMR. KOCH: I did not raise that in the\nbriefs, no, ma'am.\nWith regards to Bailey, which I think\nanswers to a great extent some of the questions\npresented here, Bailey of course held that 924(c)(1)\nrequires evidence sufficient to show an active\nemployment of the firearm by the defendant. Mr. Watson\nhere did not actively employ the firearm. Bailey\nnarrowed the category of uses that fell within the\nstatute. To quote Bailey, it said \"It's undeniable the\nactive employment reading of use restricts the scope of\n924(c)(1).\" That's the jewel of that case. Bailey held\nthat use requires active employment, not only in general\nbut by the defendant.\nMore importantly perhaps to this case,\nBailey held that possession alone is not use, and here\nMr. Watson was trying to achieve possession, but -- and\nultimately when he did get possession, he had it\ninstantaneously. So looking at it from a temporal\nstandpoint, first he receives the gun. Before that\npoint he doesn't have possession, so he doesn't even\nrise to the level of Bailey. After that point, all he\ndid was possess it for an instant, still not enough, I'd\nsuggest, to qualify as active employment or use under\nBailey, the most recent definition that we have\navailable.\nThere's an argument presented by the\ngovernment that feeds off of Smith's use of 924(d) which\nI wanted to mention briefly. The -- and that is the --\nthe importation of the definition of the term \"use\" from\n924(d), the forfeiture provision of the statute, into\n924(c).\nIn Smith, the Court held that there were\npredicate offenses for 924(d) in which the only way that\nthe weapon could be used was in a non-weapon use, which\nis what the Court was concerned about in the Smith case,\nand therefore the Court found, looking at those\npredicate offenses that had non-weapon uses only, that\ntherefore the term \"use\" as it's employed in 924(d) must\ninclude non-weapon use. That logic, however -- and\nthat's the argument made by the government -- that\ndoesn't translate into the situation we have here. It's\naddressed, by the way, on page 9 of our reply brief in\nsome detail. I'll talk about it briefly.\nFirst of all, 924(d) is a forfeiture\nprovision and the focus there necessarily is on the\nfirearm, not on the defendant. The language in 924(d)\nis, quote, \"any firearm or ammunition intended to be\nused in one of the predicate offenses.\" That's compared\nwith 924(c), which states \"any person who during and in\nrelation to a drug trafficking crime uses or carries a\nfirearm.\"\nSo you have firearm intended to be used on\nthe one hand, versus a person who uses a firearm. One\nmight say perhaps that in this transaction a firearm was\nused, but not -- that's a different thing from saying\nthat Mr. Watson used the firearm. It's a passive versus\nactive formulation.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: It has to be used by\nsomebody, some human, and the human in this case is\nMr. Watson.\nMR. KOCH: Well, ma'am, I think under Smith\nthe human that's using the firearm in the transaction is\nactually the person that came with the firearm to use it\nto purchase drugs. And as -- as Smith said that that\nwas definitely a use, it wasn't even really contested in\nSmith. And so I -- and I'm not contesting for this case\nobviously that that person that showed up with the gun\nis using the gun to get drugs.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. It wasn't\ncontested in Smith?\nMR. KOCH: I beg your pardon, Judge. I\nmeant that the Court, in its holding -- I recognize that\nit was contested. In its holding, the Court said that\nit tended to focus more on the question of whether or\nnot a nonweapon use would -- would be required. But\nthe -- certainly as between the two parties in this\ntransaction, the guy that shows up with the gun trying\nto use it to get drugs is certainly making use of it in\na way that, that recipient is not.\nThe -- in, in Smith, the Court reached the\nopinion it did about the meaning of the term \"use\" only\nbecause there were, there were predicate offenses in\nwhich the only uses available were nonweapons uses. By\ncontrast, here the predicate offenses that are suggested\nto import this definition of \"use,\" there aren't any\npredicate offenses in which the only way to commit the\noffense is through receipt.\nI'll grant you that there are predicate\noffenses in which receipt is one of the ways in which\nthe offense can be committed, but it's not the only way.\nAnd so that logical step can't be made, as it arguably\ncould have been in Smith.\nAnd finally, unlike the situation in Smith,\nhere we know that the predicate offenses can't be\ninterpreted --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. Go back over\nthat.\nMR. KOCH: Yes, sir.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why couldn't it have been\nsaid in Smith that -- that trading it for drugs was not\nthe only way in which the offense could have been\ncommitted? Couldn't the same thing have been said in\nSmith?\nMR. KOCH: In Smith the argument, as I took\nit from the opinion, Justice, was that the -- when one\nlooked at, at the predicates, there were several which\nhad, according to the opinion, only nonweapon uses. So\nif, if it's used or intended to be used in committing\none of those offenses and one looks at those offenses\nand there's only nonweapon uses, then so the argument\ngoes, that means nonweapon uses are part of use.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So the issue in Smith was\nweapon versus nonweapon, and that's not what you're\narguing here?\nMR. KOCH: That's correct, sir.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The issue here is use\nversus nonuse, active employment versus passive receipt?\nMR. KOCH: Yes, sir.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Why isn't it -- why isn't\nyour argument more directly that the issue here is -- is\nnonweapon use by A versus nonweapon use by B? You\nrepresent B and you say B wasn't the one who used it in\na nonweapon sense?\nMR. KOCH: I agree that certainly Mr. Watson\ndidn't use it in any weapons sense. So if there is a\nuse at all, it would be in a nonweapon sense.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And if you are right,\nthat's the end of the case.\nMR. KOCH: I understand, Your Honor. I\nunderstand what you're saying. I believe you're right.\nThat is another way. It's not -- it's not the direction\nthat we went, but that makes sense.\nThe -- what we focused on was use or not at\nthe first instance. And Smith having decided that in\nthat case use and defining it broadly to include a\nnonweapon use here, we're getting to the point where\nthere's no use at all in the first place.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But you're not -- as you\nsaid before, you're not arguing for the overruling of\nSmith, and therefore, you concede that the other party\nto the transaction used the gun.\nMR. KOCH: Yes, sir.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: In a nonweapon sense.\nMR. KOCH: Yes, sir.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I think you are making his\nargument. I think you're -- you're too humble, the\nargument you're making.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: It's really not a bad one.\nI mean, you don't --\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But -- but what you're\nsaying is that all Watson did was to receive the gun.\nBut he agreed to accept the gun as payment.\nMR. KOCH: Yes.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: It seems to me that in\nthat sense he used a gun. It wasn't his gun yet, but he\nagreed that if the gun would be brought to the scene of\nthe transaction, that he would accept receipt of it.\nMR. KOCH: I would suggest, sir, that the\nagreement couldn't rise to the, to the level of active\nemployment as that term is used in Bailey. In other\nwords, at that point all he has done is make a statement\nthat he'll accept something if it's offered. Whereas in\nBailey --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: He says, you get a gun,\nyou put it in your car, you come to my house, you bring\nthat gun with you, and I will give you drugs. I think\nin a sense he's using the gun. It's through the, the\nactions of another that he is doing it to be sure.\nMR. KOCH: We -- I would take the position\nthat he certainly, in a situation like that where he is,\nhe is not possessing the gun, he is expressing his\nintentions or desires with respect to it. But he is not\nin a position to do anything more than that. I don't\nthink that that fits within the definition of \"use.\" I\ndon't think that if I say that, that I'd like to buy\nyour house and if you'll sell it to me, that I'm using\nthe house.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Perhaps. But it seems to\nme to unduly constrict the case to say that all he did\nwas receive it. He did more than that. He agreed in\nadvance.\nMR. KOCH: It is correct that when he --\nthat although he initially wanted to ask how much the\ngun was --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: He agreed to let the other\nparty to the transaction use a gun to pay for the drugs,\nthe other party to make the use of the gun.\nMR. KOCH: Factually what happened was that\nhe wanted to buy a gun. And then the police officer,\nthe undercover people said, well, instead of giving\nmoney, we'll take drugs for it, which of course, brought\nus within the statute. That's the factual, particular\nfactual circumstances here.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What do you have besides\nthe linguistic argument? I mean, when I start out, I\ncan't think of a reason why Congress wouldn't want to\npenalize the buyer, not the seller. We are dealing with\na statute that does catch your client, if they had only\ncharged him with the right part. But no one in his\nright mind would ever rely on a ruling in your favor to\nactually engage in such a transaction, since it would\nviolate the statute in 15 different ways. I exaggerate,\nbut you see the point.\nSo you have a linguistic argument which\npeople are -- you're right, I think, in saying it's\nawkward but not impossible. And, therefore, awkward but\nnot impossible; we create an anomaly in the law. I\ncan't think of a reason why to do it. So what else do\nyou have?\nMR. KOCH: Bailey. I have this Court's\ndecision in Bailey, Your Honor, namely there that it\ncan't just be a use. Even if we were to go ahead and\nhold our mouths and make that awkward formation and say\nwhat he did was a use, it's still not rising to the\nlevel as Bailey interpreted the term of active\nemployment.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And, of course, you could\nsay the same thing about Bailey, I suppose. You know,\nWhat was there in Bailey except -- what was the term,\nlinguistic -- nothing but a linguistic decision.\nMR. KOCH: I guess ultimately --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Bailey doesn't make any\nmore sense either from a policy standpoint.\nMR. KOCH: I do think --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: We sometimes we rely on\nlinguistics, don't we?\nMR. KOCH: Yes, sir.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And sometimes we try to --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And sometimes the words of\nthe statute.\nMR. KOCH: I do think --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I don't want to put you in\na whipsaw here.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: Sometimes policy seems\nrelevant, too, to figure out what Congress wanted.\nBut let me go back to the question I had,\nwhich is do you want to us overturn Smith? Are you\nasking that, because I could understand it more easily\nif you said, look, both sides of the transaction should\nbe treated alike, but they should be both outside the\nword \"use.\"\nMR. KOCH: I do not believe it's necessary\nfor this Court to overrule Smith in order to rule for\nthe Petitioner here, because of -- because of the\ndifferences, first of all linguistically; and secondly\nbecause of the reliance on Bailey.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And in answer to my\nquestion, you said you were not urging the overruling of\nSmith?\nMR. KOCH: That's correct. That being said,\nI think that there is, there are arguments that can be\npresented, they were presented in Smith, as to whether\none could take one position or the other. But it\ndoesn't, it doesn't do violence to Smith to hold for the\nPetitioner here.\nUltimately, when you look at the Bailey\ndecision and at the facts of Bailey, and there you have\npeople riding around with guns in the trunk of their\ncar, and that's held not to be a use within the statute.\nWell, here Watson didn't even do that. He\nnever had the guns in the first place going into the\ntransaction. So it seems to me if Bailey --\nJUSTICE BREYER: But he receives the gun and\nit could have been loaded. And if it was loaded, you\nreceive a loaded gun, and you're there and you give the\nmoney for the gun and you have the gun and somebody\ncomes up, maybe you'll shoot him. I mean, that seems\nlike a risk.\nMR. KOCH: Under Bailey, however, if all he\ndid was receive the gun, hold it in his hand, Bailey\nsays that's not enough, that's not a use. And, of\ncourse, those are the facts of this case.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose he received the\ngun, loaded it and said, well, now, let's renegotiate\nthis transaction?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. KOCH: As Bailey -- as Bailey thought\nvery clearly, if he then takes the gun and uses it to\ncommunicate a threat to the other party, then he is\nmaking a use. He is now actively employing it, in this\ncase, as a threatening item.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But he doesn't brandish\nit. He just, he puts it in his pocket and he says:\nLet's renegotiate this. What result? Could the\ngovernment charge him?\nMR. KOCH: Your Honor, I believe if the jury\nwas to find in that factual scenario that that was --\nthat he was, in fact, silently making reference to the\ngun, then I think that gets you within Bailey. There's\nall kinds of things Mr. Watson could do beyond what the\nfacts of this case are that would turn it, what he did,\ninto active employment and use. But merely getting it\nand putting it -- and holding it, which are the facts in\nthis record, doesn't -- doesn't rise to the level of use\nunder Bailey.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I thought Bailey involved a\nguy, he had the gun in a locked thing in the trunk of\nhis car, which is a little different from holding it in\nyour hand.\nMR. KOCH: There were -- there were actually\ntwo, two different fact patterns in the consolidated.\nOne had a gun that was locked up in another room, the\nother one had guns in the trunk, with expert testimony\nbeing that that was the typical method of drug dealers\nto protect their drugs and things.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: If he has a gun in his\nhand he is certainly carrying it.\nMR. KOCH: He did have the gun in his hand\nthen he would be carrying it under Muscarello and the\nother cases. That's correct. Yes, ma'am.\nRecognizing again I just would point out\nthat whatever condition Mr. Watson had the gun in and --\nin this record that's unloaded -- was the choice, not of\nMr. Watson but of the people that brought him the gun.\nIn this clip fed gun it was up to him whether you give\nhim a clip or not, without which the gun is useless,\nwhich in this case was the choice of the police officers\nas to how they were going to hand it to him.\nMR. KOCH: I have no other -- nothing else,\nunless there's any questions.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Koch.\nMs. Maynard.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF DEANNE E. MAYNARD\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMS. MAYNARD: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nPetitioner used the firearm by accepting it\nin exchange for his drugs. In doing so Petitioner used\nit during and in relation to a drug trafficking crime.\nAlthough the situation in Smith was different, the\nprinciple of Smith is that use of a firearm as an item\nof trade or commerce -- specifically used as the medium\nof exchange -- is a use falling within the meaning of\nSection 924(C).\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But that does not answer\nthe question use by whom. As I understand it, we are\nnot really arguing about whether the gun was used in the\ntransaction; we are arguing about whether the defendant\nwas the one who used it.\nMS. MAYNARD: And the Petitioner did use it\nhere, Your Honor. In agreeing to take it in exchange\nfor a certain amount of his drugs --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but I mean, the\nproblem you, it seems to me you've got that you can't\ntotally paper over is that that's not usually the way we\ntalk. I mean, if I buy a car, and pay money for it, I\ndo not use the car in the transaction. It's what I have\nafter the transaction is complete; and you, you got that\nkind of linguistic problem here, it seems to me.\nMS. MAYNARD: If you buy the car, then you\nhave used the car as an item of trade or commerce during\nor in relation to that commercial transaction. We don't\nusually talk that way but we do -- and one can --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's enough to say we don't\nusually talk that way.\nMS. MAYNARD: I don't think so, Your Honor.\nAs long as --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's the end of it. We\ndon't talk that way. We don't say use a car when you\nbuy a car.\nMS. MAYNARD: Well here, Your Honor, it's\nimportant to put it into statutory context, of course,\nand the statutory context asks whether or not one has\nused the firearm during or in relation to a drug\ntrafficking crime, here a drug transaction. And I do --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: It adds an additional\nelement you have to prove but it doesn't answer the\nlinguistic point.\nMS. MAYNARD: I think one can employ use in\na natural way to mean receipt in the way that Petitioner\nused the firearm here. The subway system uses tokens.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: If you're on the other\nside of the transaction, it's perfectly natural to say I\nused the gun for the transaction. What is the converse\nsentence? I used the gun --\nMS. MAYNARD: I used the gun as a medium of\nexchange to sell my drugs. Just in the same way that --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I didn't use the gun as a\nmedium of exchange. I accepted the gun as a medium of\nexchange. He didn't use it until he got it.\nMS. MAYNARD: I believe in any barter\ntransaction, Your Honor, in particular, where one side\nhas said as they negotiate it out, I will sell you this\namount of drugs for this particular firearm, then both\nhave used the gun as the medium of exchange --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So if you have --\nsorry.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But you don't have the\nsimple sentence. I used the gun to pay for the drugs --\nthat's easy, but you don't have a simple countervailing\nsentence.\nMS. MAYNARD: I --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I suppose you could say we\nused the gun in order to complete the drug transaction.\nMS. MAYNARD: And -- and the drug dealer\nused the gun as the medium of exchange to complete his\ndrug sale, and I do think we do sometimes use \"use\" in\nthat way, Justice Stevens. The subway system uses\ntokens. The metro system.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, let's say --\nlet's say you have a duel, and each person in the duel\nneeds to have a weapon. One person has a gun; the other\nperson has the sword. Would you say the person with the\nsword is using the gun in the duel?\nMS. MAYNARD: Well in a --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Because you can't\nhave a duel without both people having weapons.\nMS. MAYNARD: You would have certainly\nused --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You wouldn't say\nthat the person --\nMS. MAYNARD: -- the sword as weapon. There\nis no exchange there, Your Honor. Here it's crucial,\nbecause you have during your relation to a drug\ntrafficking crime, which here is the drug exchange, just\nlike in Smith.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Each person in the\ndrug exchange brings to the table what they've got. The\none has the drugs; the other brings the gun. That\ndoesn't mean that the person with the drugs is using the\ngun.\nMS. MAYNARD: If he agrees to trade his\ndrugs for the gun as the currency to close the drug\ntransaction, I believe he has used the gun in the way\nthat we normally use the word.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But the only way you can\nmake that argument is to define the crime as consisting\nof the agreement as opposed to the consummated\ntransaction.\nMS. MAYNARD: No. I think the -- I think\nthe crime is the taking of the firearm in exchange for\nthe drugs.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, I thought you said a\nminute ago that he was using it because he agreed to\naccept it.\nMS. MAYNARD: I think one could make the\nargument, Justice Souter, that an agreement alone is a\nuse once, one agrees to use the gun as the medium of\nexchange to sell one's drugs. The Government is not\npressing that point here today and we don't, and the\nCourt need not go that far because here Petitioner did\nreceive the drugs, and the reason that possibly the\nagreement line goes too far is the rationale of this\nCourt's decision in Smith where the Court pointed out\nthat someone who makes a material misstatement in order\nto acquire a gun is clearly not using the gun, but the\nCourt gave examples of receipt offenses in, in the\nforfeiture provisions in Section 924(D) where receipt of\na firearm is a use under the statute.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why -- why wouldn't making\na material misstatement in order to obtain a gun\nconstitute a use of the gun -- as much as it, the\nreceipt of the gun constitutes a use of the gun here?\nWhat's the difference between the two situations?\nMS. MAYNARD: I think one could make the\nargument, Your Honor, as I said, that making material\nstatement. I'm saying the Court in Smith --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Not if you believe Smith.\nMS. MAYNARD: I beg your pardon.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Not if you believe Smith.\nMS. MAYNARD: Because -- and that's why the\nGovernment is drawing the line today at actual receipt,\nand that's - that's all that's involved in this case.\nThe actual taking of the firearm where then you have all\nthe dangers present with which Congress was concerned,\nwhich is --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yes but Justice Breyer\nmade the very persuasive argument that it doesn't make\nsense to treat both sides of the transaction exactly the\nsame; but isn't it the fact that in many drug\ntransactions the buyer is not treated the same way as\nthe seller? It's a crime to sell poison drugs but it\nmay not be a crime to buy the poison drugs.\nMS. MAYNARD: Well, there are two points in\nresponse to that, Your Honor. One is that if the buyer\nof drugs buys the distribution quantity, then we do\noften treat the buyer as a distributor under the\ndistribution statute.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But generally speaking\nbuyers and sellers are not always treated alike in the\ncriminal law, are they?\nMS. MAYNARD: When Congress -- no that's\ncorrect, Your Honor; but in those cases where Congress\nuses words, like it does in the distribution statute,\nthat clearly targets one side or other of the\ntransaction. But here what the Court is interpreting is\nthe much broader word, \"use,\" and we know from Section\n924(D)'s forfeiture provisions that Congress employed\nthe word use broadly in Section 924(d) and used it to\ninclude receipt crimes; and Smith cites several examples\nof receipt crimes that Smith believed was a use,\nincluding unlicensed receipt of a firearm from out of\nState, receipt of a stolen firearm and receipt of a\nfirearm with an intent to commit a felony; and in\ncontext Congress clearly did use \"use\" broadly in\nSection 924(D). If -- if in response to their argument\nin Ponce, their argument about (D)(1), the forfeiture\nprovisions in (D)(1) and D 3, I do think those\nprovisions strongly support the Government's argument\nhere.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why? There's -- they refer\nto crimes in which there has been a receipt but there\nhas also been a conveyance. Why do you focus on the\nreceiver rather than the conveyer?\nMS. MAYNARD: Because our reading, Justice\nScalia, gives full effect to the provisions that\nCongress has carefully chosen to place in (D)(3) and the\nPetitioner's reading does not.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What are they?\nMS. MAYNARD: And if I could explain it. In\n(D)(1) -- it's on page 8a of our brief, (D)(1)-- in\n924(D)(1) Congress provided two principal ways in which\nthe Government can forfeit firearms. The first is if an\noffense is completed, the Government can forfeit a\nfirearm that is involved in or used in that offense.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Involved in -- that\nbroadens that enormously, doesn't it?\nMS. MAYNARD: Yes it does, Your Honor; but\nthat actually strengthens my point.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It cuts the other\nway. Congress knows how to say involved in if it wants\nto reach that broadly, and it didn't do it under the\nprovision in which -- pursuant to which Mr. Watson was\nindicted.\nMS. MAYNARD: Well yes, Your Honor, but if\nyou allow me to continue on, further on in (D)(1)\nCongress used a narrow subset of crimes some of which\ninclude receipt crimes where it only used the word use\nand that's the logic to this Court's decision in Smith\nand it applies equally here. Further down in (D)(1)\nCongress allowed the Government to forfeit firearms\nintended to be used in certain very specific listed\ncrimes, and in other words to forfeit the firearms\nbefore the -- the crime actually is committed. Some of\nthose crimes include -- receipt crimes -- include the\nvery receipt crimes listed by this Court in Smith' and\nso given that Congress believed that the firearms\nintended to be used in purely receipt crimes were\nultimately going to be used by the receipt, Congress\nemployed the term here very broadly including to receipt\nof a firearm.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It could be -- it could\nhave -- it is intended to be used, not necessarily. As\n-- as your opponent pointed out, this section does not\nfocus on the individual. It focuses on the firearm,\nsimply for -- for confiscation of the firearm. And,\ntherefore, it suffices if either side intended it to be\nused. It doesn't have to be the recipient who intended\nit to be used even though it's a receipt crime. It was\nintended to be used by the other side. Wouldn't that\nmake sense?\nMS. MAYNARD: I think if you were to\ninterpret (d)(3) in that way, Your Honor, you would do\ngreat violence to what Congress intended. If I can\npoint you to page 10-A of our brief in -- it's (d)(3)\nthat sets forth very particularly the crimes that\nCongress thought the government should be able to\nforfeit firearms before the crime occurs.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What page is that?\nMS. MAYNARD: It's on the government's gray\nbrief, 10-A. In (e) of 922 -- this is 924. I'm sorry,\n924(d)(3)(E ). It includes any offense described in\nsection -- and it lists several examples including\n922(n). And 922(n) is set forth in the government's\nbrief on page 2-A, which makes it a crime for someone\nunder felony indictment to ship, transport, or receive a\nfirearm.\nNow, under Petitioner's reading they would\nsay: Well, that's fine. That still has meaning. Under\nour reading of \"use,\" the government can forfeit\nfirearms that the person under felony indictment intends\nto ship or transport, but cannot forfeit firearms that\nthe --\nJUSTICE BREYER: This is what -- this is\nwhat is bothering me about your side of this case. I\nstart thinking this is a total fluke. Normally, you\nwould charge him under \"possession in furtherance of,\"\nwhich you didn't for reasons I don't know. Or he would\nbe an accessory, which he isn't here because the other\nside was a government agent. So we've got a fluke.\nNow, if I accept your linguistic approach, I\ndon't know what I'm getting into. Imagine an artillery\nteam. One loads the ammunition; the other pulls the\ntrigger. We say the team used the ammunition, but the\nguy who pulled the trigger by himself didn't.\nThink of a baseball team. The pitcher\ndoesn't use the bat, but the team does.\nNow, if I take your linguistic approach,\nwhere am I in respect to other statutes? But if I deny\nyour linguistic approach on the ground that it's\nunnatural to say \"use\" of the -- the individual used it,\nall I've done is create a fluke case because it will\nnever come up again.\nMS. MAYNARD: I don't think that it's --\nseveral responses, Your Honor. I don't think it's\nunnatural to use \"use\" to mean \"receipt\" when you're\ntalking about using something as a medium of exchange\nduring and in relation to a drug trafficking crime.\nBecause, as I said before, company stores use script.\nAmerican stores use dollars. French stores use euros.\nWe can use the word \"use\" and then have to wait --\nJUSTICE BREYER: But those are all examples\nthat I used the gun to pay for the item. You don't use\nthe word \"use\" when you're the seller. It doesn't fit.\nMS. MAYNARD: No, Your Honor. I disagree.\nI think when a company store uses script, that means it\naccepts script as money from the company employees.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So if Congress\npasses a statute saying anyone who uses a gun in a crime\nof violence gets an additional sentence, the person who\nis shot is using the gun in a crime of violence?\nMS. MAYNARD: You wouldn't have to go that\nfar here, Your Honor, because the \"use\" here is use as a\nmedium of exchange. So the court need go no further.\nAnd that's another response to Justice Breyer. The\nCourt need go no further than it did in Smith, which you\n-- it doesn't have to -- we have much more than receipt\nsimpliciter here, Justice Breyer. We have the\nnegotiated transaction where he received the firearms as\nthe medium of exchange.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So is that a\nnecessary element of the offense: That the transaction\nbe negotiated in advance?\nMS. MAYNARD: No, Your Honor, if you take it\nas the medium of exchange to sell your drugs. He\ndoesn't dispute that he engaged in a drug trafficking\ncrime, and he doesn't dispute that he took the gun as\nthe currency to close that drug deal, and that is a use\nwithin the meaning -- within a natural meaning of \"use,\"\nif it is used as currency.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Are you saying that the\nparties are viewed collectively so that in Justice\nBreyer's example the pitcher and the batter used a ball\nand a bat. Is that your position? And in this case the\nseller and the buyer used drugs and a gun.\nMS. MAYNARD: In any bartering exchange,\nJustice Kennedy --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, does that fit with\nthe words of the statute, any person who --\nMS. MAYNARD: Any person --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Even though it's a\ncollective enterprise, you can still focus on one of the\nparties and prevail. Is that your position?\nMS. MAYNARD: Well, imagine -- imagine a\nstatute that made it a crime to use United States\ncurrency during and in relation to a drug trafficking\ncrime. A drug dealer who sold his drugs for cash would\nsurely be in violation of that statute.\nThis is no different. The Court has already\nheld that using the firearm as currency is a violation\nof the statute.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I don't think -- I\ndon't see how your hypothetical advances the argument.\nI mean, I don't necessarily agree that someone who sells\ndrugs for currency is using the currency in the\ntransaction. They are accepting it. It is what they\nwant. That's not the same as using it.\nMS. MAYNARD: No, Your Honor. I think they\nare using it as the medium of exchange, which I think\neven under the sentence rationale in Smith -- such as --\nsuch as statutes, if you would say: Well, what's the\nnormally intended use of United States currency? And\nthat would be as the medium of exchange, and both\nparties would be --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's what\nweakens your hypothetical. It's not the normal use of\na gun as a medium of exchange.\nMS. MAYNARD: Yes, but the Court has already\nheld that using a gun as the medium of exchange falls\nwithin the statute.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: May I ask --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It held that the\nperson who does use the gun, which is the natural,\ngrammatical construction, uses the firearm. That's\nquite a bit different than the question of whether\nsomeone who receives it as the consideration is using\nthe firearm.\nMS. MAYNARD: I think the rationale\nnecessary to the holding in Smith, Your Honor, was that\nuse of a gun as an item of trade or commerce,\nspecifically as the medium of exchange, is the \"use.\"\nAnd, in fact, Smith refers several times to an earlier\nD.C. Circuit decision in Harris, a per curiam, a public\nper curiam, in which two members of this Court were on\nthe panel, that involved this very fact pattern, where\nthe -- the --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, but the argument in\nJustice O'Connor's opinion was largely linguistic. The\nnatural use of the word \"use\" is to say: I used it to\npay for the gun -- I used it to pay for the drugs,\nrather. But you don't have a countervailing sentence\nthat fits into anything in her opinion, and you haven't\nreally answered his reliance on the -- on the other\ncase, which requires active use.\nMS. MAYNARD: I think in -- in Bailey, Your\nHonor, the Court required a use that makes the gun an\noperative factor, a use that changes the circumstances\nwhere both parties are aware the gun is being used.\nThis is a far cry from Bailey. This is not\nlocked-up weapons where only one party is aware of their\nexistence to protect the store of drugs. This gun was\nfront and center, part and parcel, of the drug\ntransaction. It was --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: It was -- Watson\npossessed the gun, would you agree with that, in\nfurtherance of the transaction? Would you say that this\ncase fits the statute, as amended, so it could have been\ncharged as possession?\nMS. MAYNARD: Yes, Your Honor. That's the\ngovernment's position.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Why was it -- why wasn't\npossession charged here?\nMS. MAYNARD: I do not know the specific\ncircumstances of the charging decision here, Justice\nGinsburg, but in the Fifth Circuit the law was already\nclear that this was a use. And, indeed, when Congress\namended the statute post Bailey to expand this Court's\nunderstanding of the meaning of \"use,\" there was no need\nto address this particular fact pattern because most of\nthe circuits had been --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But the prosecution would\ncertainly want to assure the success of the argument;\nand if this is clearly possession, why wasn't possession\ncharged? And does the Department of Justice give any\nguidance to prosecutors since the 1988 amendment on what\nto charge in these situations?\nMS. MAYNARD: I don't know the answer to\nthat, Your Honor. I don't know the answer to either of\nthose questions, but I do know that we argued in our\nopposition to the cert petition that this question\ndoesn't have much going-forward significance because of\nthat new amendment.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Maybe they were doubtful\nabout whether the \"possession\" thing applies here. I\ndon't know. Possesses a firearm in furtherance of the\ncrime -- I mean, the crime has been completed by the\ntime the -- the person who is receiving the gun has\npossession of it.\nMS. MAYNARD: I think it's part and parcel\n--\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's hard to say it's in\nfurtherance of the crime when the crime is over once he\ngets it. His possession is not in furtherance of the\ncrime, it seems to me. It's the other person's\npossession that's in furtherance of the crime. He\npossesses it so he can turn it over, which is the crime.\nBut I mean I'm just not all that sure that you have a\nhundred percent easy case on the possession point.\nMS. MAYNARD: Well, the Petitioner agreed\nwith you on that, Your Honor, but four circuits have\nagreed with the government. On the going-forward basis,\nwe think we do have a good argument. Here, and in your\nhypothetical, imagine the situation where the gun is\nturned over first, and then the payment -- and then the\ndrugs are traded. It would certainly seem that you\npossessed it in furtherance there.\nI think it is possession in furtherance in\n-- in -- because it is the sine qua non of drug\ntransactions. It's the very part and parcel of drug\ntransactions. But it does -- this case does matter to\nthe government because the government has prosecuted\npeeople properly, it thinks, under the \"use\" prong of\nthe statute. Those people are -- currently stand\nconvicted; and, as experience proves post-Bailey, if\nthis Court were to rule against the government here,\nthat could have an effect on those people's current\nincarceration.\nIf I could get back to my 922(d) point, just\nto finish up, which is that --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I just -- I\ndon't understand the significance of the argument you\njust made. Are you saying that because some people\nmight be let out of prison if we correctly construed the\nstatute, we should read it your way?\nMS. MAYNARD: No, Your Honor. Of course if\nthe Court feels that these people are properly\nconvicted, then, you know, they can pursue whatever\nremedies they may have.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So what was your\npoint referring to the people who were convicted under\nthis statute --under this construction of the statute?\nMS. MAYNARD: That it -- that it is of\nongoing importance to the government, even though as a\nprospective matter the government may be able to charge\nthis conduct under possession and furtherance.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I thought the\nargument you made earlier was that this may not be of\nparticular ongoing significance because of the\namendment.\nMS. MAYNARD: Right, Your Honor. From now\non, the government could charge, if you rule against us\nin this case, we believe we can charge this conduct\nunder possession and furtherance. However, my point is\n-- is that we nevertheless care about the result in this\ncase. We believe that people in this situation have\nused a firearm as a medium of exchange during and in\nrelation to a drug trafficking crime and stand properly\nconvicted. It was only to make the point that the\ngovernment does have an interest in how the Court rules\nin this case and that it's not meaningless to us which\nprong applies here.\nBack to the 922(d)(4) point, the -- under\nPetitioner's reading, it would mean that the government\ncan't forfeit firearms in a situation like someone under\nfelony indictment ships or transports -- intends to ship\nor transform a firearm. Under Petitioner's reading the\nGovernment can forfeit that because they consider that\nto be active verbs, but under -- if the person under\nfelony indictment simply intends to receive a firearm,\nthe government would have to wait until that person\nreceives the firearm in order to be able to forfeit it,\nand that is -- I suggest that no rational Congress would\nhave meant that by referring to the provision.\nThey do point to -- well, if there -- if\nthere are no further questions, the government believes\nthat this crime,this -- that the use of the gun in this\nmanner is a crime, that there's no reason to believe\nthat Congress would have wanted the defendant in Smith\nto stand convicted of this crime but to leave the drug\ndealer who ends up with the gun not with the punishment\nfor this crime.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Something just occurred to\nme. When you distinguish the case,our unanimous\nopinion requiring active use, you said, well, that --\nthat gun was in the trunk of a car so -- what if this\ngun had been in the trunk of the car also and the guy\nsaid, well, it's now -- that's your gun?\nMS. MAYNARD: Whose trunk is it in, Your\nHonor?\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, they just\ntransferred ownership in exchange for drugs with -- by\ntransferring title to a gun that was located in the --\nin the trunk of a car.\nMS. MAYNARD: If he has constructive\npossession of it, Justice Stevens, and he's -- I believe\nhe would have received it and that would be sufficient.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: So it -- it was not\nsufficient in -- in Bailey in any case, but it would be\nsufficient here because it played a role in the\ntransaction?\nMS. MAYNARD: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you.\nMS. MAYNARD: But -- I mean Bailey makes\nexamples to things that would involve an active\nemployment including reference to a gun that -- if the\nreference to a gun changes the circumstances of the\nunderlying offense.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But -- but Smith, in\nSmith, Justice O'Connor used the illustration turning\ncurrency into a cannon. You can't do that very well if\nthe gun is in a car, in a locked trunk in a car on the\nstreet. You can't turn the currency, the gun, into a\ncannon.\nMS. MAYNARD: That's true, Justice Ginsburg,\nand if the Court wanted to limit it to \"use\" means that\nyou've actually taken possession of it because that --\nthat's all the government is defending here. That's\nwhat happened in this case. That's what happens in most\nof the cases.\nI -- I would also like to say in response to\ntheir point about the government sting, that if you look\nat the cases in the courts of appeals, there are many\ncases where -- that indicate these kinds of trades do\nhappen in the real world absent government involvement.\nFor example, in the First Circuit's decision in Cotto,\nwhich is currently pending before the Court, the -- the\nperson who ultimately came -- became the confidential\ninformant -- before that the drug deal her sold to her\ndrugs for guns on 20 separate occasions. So this does\ngo on --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Is -- is there any reason\nin such a case, if you lost this case, in the future\ncould you not just charge, as Justice Alito said, that\nthey're a principal in the possession by the seller?\nMS. MAYNARD: We -- we believe --\nJUSTICE BREYER: If the government is not\ninvolved? And if the government's involved on the other\nside, I guess you'd have to charge an attempt.\nMS. MAYNARD: There is no attempt offense\nunder Section 924(c), Justice Breyer. You can use a gun\nduring and in relation to an attempted drug crime, but\nyou can't attempt to use a gun.\nThe -- the government believes it could, on\na going-forward basis, charge possession -- oh, you're\nasking me about whether we could charge aiding and\nabetting going forward. The -- the Seventh Ccircuit has\nsuggested in Dick that that would be open to the\ngovernment to charge. I think that -- and potentially,\neven though it wasn't in the indictment here, it could\nbe read into the indictment. But there are two possible\nissues: One that my colleague has pointed out, which is\nin some cases where Congress has criminalized one side\nof the transaction but not the other. And so that might\nbe the situation here. The Court --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And so your -- your\npractical argument then is that there has been\nconsiderable reliance on your interpretation to the\nextent that many people have been convicted under it.\nHow many?\nMS. MAYNARD: That I don't know, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: About? About? Have any\nrough idea?\nMS. MAYNARD: I don't know, Your Honor, but\nthere are six circuits on our side of the conflict and\n-- so it -- it -- I don't know.\nIf there are no further questions --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMs. Maynard. Mr. Koch, you have 4 minute remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARBUMENT BY KARL KOCH\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. KOCH: Thank you, Your Honor.\nAs -- as I indicated before I don't think\nthat it's necessary to overrule Smith to rule for the\nPetitioner, but if -- if consistency on both sides of\nthe transaction is desired and certainly something has\nto go, I would suggest it ought to be Smith because\notherwise you're stuck with Bailey and with what I\nsuggest are settled principles of statutory\nconstruction. The -- I think Smith takes -- takes it\nabout as far as it could go, and you're having to make\n-- you have to make a number of linguistic compromises\nto get to the Smith result to begin with.\nThe -- with regard to the -- the charging as\npossession or furtherance or not, again it's not before\nus, it's not part of this case I would suggest that\nMr. Watson possessed this firearm as a consequence of a\ndrug transaction rather than in furtherance of a drug\ntransaction.\nI do think, and it's obvious from other\nstatutes in the neighborhood, that Congress certainly\nknows how to say \"receive\" and \"accept\" and words of\nthat nature, if it was its intent to -- to make the\nreceipt of a weapon or bring that within the ambit of\nthis -- of this particular statute.\nI don't think it's enough to say, as my\nopponent does, use as a medium of exchange if it's a\ncrime for example to use a forged instrument. The guy\nwho accepts it doesn't use it, I don't think by any\nreasonable interpretation. So I think that that -- that\nreally stretches this farther than it should go.\nLastly, I would point out, and again this is\nin our brief around page 9, with respect to this 924(d)\nargument, one of the predicate offenses that's used in\n924(d) is 922(j), which includes language \"it shall be\nunlawful for any person to receive, possess, conceal,\nstore, barter, sell, or dispose of\" et cetera. Well,\n\"possess\" is there in 922(j), yet we know from Bailey\nthat \"possess\" in and of itself can't be a use. And\nthat's just one of the reasons why that argument\nunfortunately falls apart when one is trying to import\nthose definitions of use into this statute.\nI have nothing further.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Koch.\n"
