KNEEDLER\nON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS IN 03-1164\nMR. KNEEDLER: Justice Stevens, and may it\nplease the Court:\nCongress enacted the Beef Promotion and Research\nAct in 1985 in the midst of a serious depression in the\nbeef industry. The beef industry found itself unable to\nrespond to that situation through the promotion of its\nproducts. Congress responded to that situation by\nestablishing a government program of promotion, research,\nand consumer information. In the Beef Act, Congress\nprescribed the central message for advertising under the\nAct, Congress established a government body, the Beef\nBoard, to administer and implement the program, and it\nplaced the program under the control of a Cabinet officer,\nthe Secretary of Agriculture.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Mr. Kneedler, will you tell\nus how this case differs, if it does, from what was before\nthe Court in United Foods? What meaningful distinctions\ndo you find?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, the important distinction\nis that the two grounds that -- on which we are defending\nthe statute here were not addressed in United Foods. In\nparticular, the government speech argument, that what I've\njust said goes to, that the Court specifically did not\naddress because it had not --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: We've never addressed that in\n--\nMR. KNEEDLER: In none of these cases, and --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- in these cases --\nMR. KNEEDLER: Right.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- have we?\nMR. KNEEDLER: The Court has not. And we think\nthat that is -- the critical point about this -- about\nthis case and these programs, these are government --\nthese are programs of government speech. As I said,\nCongress, itself, prescribed the central message.\nCongress established the government board, all of whose\nmembers are appointed by the Secretary, to administer it.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Does it remain government\nspeech even if you don't say, \"This is your government\nspeaking\"?\nMR. KNEEDLER: It --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: If you say, you know,\n\"America's cattlemen are speaking,\" is it government\nspeech?\nMR. KNEEDLER: It does -- for purposes of this\nCourt's government speech doctrine, it does. And I think\n--\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why is that? I mean --\nMR. KNEEDLER: And the Court -- the Court's\ndecision in Rust, I think, is the best illustration of\nthat.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but Rust did not -- Rust\nwas not a case in which the doctor was saying, \"This is my\npersonal opinion, not the government's.\" And here, as\nJustice Scalia pointed out, there is an affirmative effort\nto say, \"This is -- this is paid for by\" whatever it's\ncalled, the cattlemen's group or the beef group, which\naffirmatively indicates that it's not government speech.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, it -- all those statements\nsay -- and there are advertisements in the record that say\nthat the advertising is funded by America's beef\nproducers, which is, of course, accurate, because they --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, it's accurate --\nMR. KNEEDLER: -- they pay for it.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- but it also contains the\nimplication that who -- he who pays is the person whose\nspeech is being broadcasted.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, but, again, in Rust, the\ndoctor who spoke -- I think the patient who went to see\nthe doctor for counseling would have -- would have assumed\nor believed that the doctor was -- in the immediate\nencounter, that the doctor was speaking, and yet the\nCourt, in its subsequent cases, has regarded Rust as a\nsituation of government speech.\nBut the important point about what you've just\nasked is that any concerns about the tag line in the\nadvertising does not go to the constitutionality of the\nstatute or the beef order. Neither the Act nor the order\nrequires that in the advertising. And if the Court was to\nperceive that as a problem, the right remedy would not be\nto invalidate the Act, but to, instead, provide that there\nshould be some different identification --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but some people --\nMR. KNEEDLER: -- on the advertising, itself.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- may be more resistant to an\n-- to an ad that says, \"Your government wants to eat --\nwants you to eat more meat,\" than they are to an ad which\nsay, \"The meat producers would like you to eat more meat.\"\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, I -- and I think in Rust,\nsome people would have been resistant to the idea that\nyour government wants you to engage in family planning,\nbut what the -- what the Court said about Rust was that\nthe government had established a program with a central\nmessage about counseling. That was then carried out by\nprivate individuals. Here, this case is much stronger\nthan Rust.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but if you -- if you say\nthe Act can be -- say, because this is just an as-applied\nchallenge, you're asking us to assume that we can put on a\nlabel that's not true, \"This message is brought to you by\nyour friendly Department of Agriculture.\" That isn't\naccurate.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, it would be accurate --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And you're having us save the\nstatute by just putting a label on it that isn't accurate.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, they're -- I'm sure that a\nlabel could be devised that would -- that would be\naccurate. The -- first of all, they are approved --\nspecifically approved by the Department of Agriculture.\nThe -- certainly, the Act and regulations provide that the\nSecretary must approve every contract, every project for\nadvertising. And, beyond that, the USDA approves all\nadvertising, all copy --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But, Mr. Kneedler --\nMR. KNEEDLER: -- that is actually to be used,\nso there is specific approval by the Secretary.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But there is -- there's\nanother tape put out by the government, on meat, and that\n-- what is the government speech? Usually, the government\nhas a position, and is presenting it. Here, we have\nAmerica beef producers has a label on -- \"Eat meat.\" But\nif you went to the Surgeon General, probably that message\nwould be \"Eat meat moderately.\" So what is the government\nspeech? I don't know another case involving a claim of\ngovernment speech where the message that you are saying is\nthe government's is not the message that the government is\nputting out when it's dealing with its concern for public\nhealth.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, the government, in the\nconcern -- in situations where it may be concerned about\npublic health, doesn't say, \"Don't eat meat.\" It -- there\nmay be nutritional standards. And USDA does have\nnutritional standards that it advises people to adhere to.\nBut what the government is doing here is facilitating a\nsituation, facilitating promotion of a commodity.\nThere is a structural defect in a market like --\na market for a fungible commodity, and I think it's\nimportant to understand what Congress was responding to\nhere. When you have a fungible commodity, when you have a\nlot of small producers, no one of those producers has an\nincentive to advertise --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Kneedler, is meat\nfungible? Or -- I think there are some steak houses that\nmight disagree with that.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, there are -- there are --\nthere are, to be sure, different cuts of meat, but the --\nbut the basic --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I mean, even quality of meat\nwithin the -- some is tougher than others.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: It's not like milk or wheat.\nMR. KNEEDLER: But Congress could reasonably\ndetermine, under this statute, that there are -- that\nthere are -- that beef has many things in common, that it\nis a generic problem -- or generic food or generic\ncommodity, and the industry --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: At some level, it certainly\nis, I suppose. But, just as in wheat or corn, there are\ndifferent brands and different qualities. But I suppose\nit's still fungible, in a broad sense.\nMR. KNEEDLER: It is fungible in --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: May I ask you whether, in\ndeciding the government's speech doctrine, is it the\nSecretary's formal right to control, as set out in the\nstatute, that we look to, or do we look to the Secretary's\nactual record of oversight and participation?\nMR. KNEEDLER: We think the -- we think the\nformal legal control is sufficient. And it -- the\nSecretary has the responsibility to approve -- under the\nstatute -- to approve budgets, to approve contracts, and\nto approve projects. And USDA does, in fact, go beyond\nthat and determine whether particular advertisements will\nbe -- will be issued. But we think it's only necessary to\nlook what the statute requires. But the testimony in this\ncase shows that, in any event, USDA is extensively\ninvolved in the development of the advertising under this\nstatute, by extensive consultations with the Operating\nCommittee and the Beef Board in the development of the\nproject. So there -- this is an integrated effort within\nthe Department of Agriculture.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Is it at all possible to do\nhere what has been done in the union cases, where -- I\nmean, it's pretty hard for me to believe that there aren't\n-- that meat -- that cattle growers don't, by and large,\nlike beef. I mean, maybe they have a ideological\nobjection to people eating beef, but I doubt it. They\nprobably object to some content. So can you segregate\nthat? I mean, in the union cases, the bar cases, they try\nto segregate where there really is an ideological\nobjection from the cases where really all that the\nobjector wants is not to pay the money. And so they work\nout a system. You know, you pay so much for your dues\nanyway, you just don't pay that pro rata amount, where you\nreally have an ideological objection.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, I think that --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Is it possible to work that\nout?\nMR. KNEEDLER: What has -- what has been\nproposed by the -- by the Respondents in this case, of\ncourse, is to make it voluntary, so that people --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes, but, I mean, if you make\nit --\nMR. KNEEDLER: -- can opt out.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- totally voluntary, what\nyou're going to discover is, all of a sudden, the beef\npeople, rather than write a check, will say, \"Oh, you\nknow, I make -- I raise cattle, but I don't think people\nshould eat beef.\"\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well --\nJUSTICE BREYER: That saves them the money.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, and I --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And I tend to doubt that that's\ntheir view.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, and --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Some may view -- object to\ncertain content. So I'm asking if it's feasible to work\nout --\nMR. KNEEDLER: I think it -- I think it would\nnot be feasible. It would -- it would enmesh the\nDepartment in difficult judgments and time-consuming --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: It would be -- in the union\ncases, it's hard enough. It's a -- the good-of-the-order\nexception is the way it works in the union. And in the\nbar thing, I think it would be hard to --\nMR. KNEEDLER: Absolutely. And the Court made a\nsimilar point in Southworth, where it specifically\ndeclined to impose, on the university, a requirement to\nmake judgments that would enable people to opt out in\nparticular cases. And we think that the problem here\nwould be even greater. But they would be particularly\ngreat under Respondents' proposal that individuals who\ndon't want to pay, without even having to express an\nobjection, because the whole system would collapse. This\nis a classic collective-action, free-rider problem.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Kneedler --\nMR. KNEEDLER: What the numbers --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- can I come back to Rust\nversus Sullivan? You say that that was a government\nspeech case? I had not recollected it as a government\nspeech case.\nMR. KNEEDLER: This Court --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: This is government subsidizing\nspeech by private organizations, and it chose to subsidize\none type of speech, but not another.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Yes --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Did we say, in the opinion,\nthat this was --\nMR. KNEEDLER: Not in Rust, but in the Court's\nsubsequent cases, Rosenberger, Southworth -- in\nparticular, in Velazquez -- this Court said that Rust has\ncome to be understood by the Court as a government speech\ncase, because the government prescribed the message, and\nit's government speech whether or not the government\nspeaks for itself or enlists others to transmit the\nmessage.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, for the precise purpose\nat issue here, I think it makes a lot of difference. You\ncan fund private people for some things, and not fund them\nfor others, and it doesn't make whatever they say\ngovernment speech. I think that's a --\nMR. KNEEDLER: But --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- I think that's a really --\nMR. KNEEDLER: -- but there's really no --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- strong proposition, that\nwhenever you're subsidizing any private enterprise, the\nspeech of that private enterprise becomes public speech.\nMR. KNEEDLER: There's really no need to get to\nthat point here, because the Beef Board, which is the\nentity that does the speaking, is, I think, unquestionably\na government body. It's established by special statute\nunder the Lebron test. All of its members are appointed\nby the --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's fine. But what you were\nusing Rust for was to establish the proposition that in\norder to be government speech, it -- you don't have to --\nyou don't have to say, \"This is the government speaking.\"\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, I think --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And Rust doesn't stand for\nthat.\nMR. KNEEDLER: -- Right -- I think, as this Court\nhas come to explain Rust, as being a species of government\nspeech -- but, as I say, there is no need -- there is no\nneed for the Court to get to that situation. And the fact\nthat the government is the one in control of the speech\nhere critically distinguished -- distinguishes this case\nfrom cases like Keller and Abood.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: This is a question perhaps\nmore for the Respondent than for you, but I would like\nyour comment on it. Suppose the statute were changed and\nthere was a dollar-a-head assessment on beef, and it just\nwent into the general funds of the United States Treasury,\nand then they used part of that money -- they had more\nmoney for beef advertising, and the government did the\nadvertising. What would the Respondents say about that?\nMR. KNEEDLER: I think -- I think they would say\nthat that -- that there's something different about\ngeneral taxes and excise taxes or focus taxes. But I\ndon't think there's any basis in this --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But why can't --\nMR. KNEEDLER: -- in history or --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- why can't you just do that?\nOr is your answer to me, \"Well, then, it's just formalism,\nand you might as well rule for me now?\"\nMR. KNEEDLER: I'm sorry, do -- maybe I\nmisunderstood your question.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Why can't the government --\nMR. KNEEDLER: Were you asking why focus --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- why can't the government\nadopt my solution?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, I -- and maybe I\nmisunderstood. Was it -- was it paying for it out of\ngeneral taxes or taking this money and putting into the\nfocus --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: It's put into the general fund\nof the -- of the Treasury.\nMR. KNEEDLER: I -- they may say that that's the\nsame thing, but I -- they were drawing a distinction\nbetween paying for it out of general funds -- income tax\nor something -- that we all would pay for. They say\nthat's the solution, rather than having the industry, that\nbenefits from the advertising, pay for it. Not only does\nthe industry benefit --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But then you'd come within the\nprotections of Frothingham versus Mellon, and\nMassachusetts versus Mellon, if you did it that way.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Yes, there would be standing\nobjection -- objections at that point, but we think, in\nterms of the merits of the argument, the notion that a\nperson would have a First Amendment objection to paying an\nexcise tax because of the uses to which the excise taxes\nare being put is really extraordinary and finds no basis\nin cases like Abood and Keller, which have to do with\nprivate association -- an association with private speech\n--\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But then you could --\nMR. KNEEDLER: -- no government speech.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- simply restructure this\nAct to get to the result you want.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Yes. If that -- but the funds\nthat are raised are public monies. They don't go in --\nthey're not deposited in the Treasury. But in the Joint\nAppendix, there is a reproduced -- an AMS, Agricultural\nMarketing Service, circular that explains how these public\nmonies -- and calls them \"public monies\" -- are to be\ndisposed of. And it describes the Beef Board, this\ngovernmental body that receives the money, as being the\ncustodian for the Agricultural Marketing Service and\nhandling these monies. And Congress and the Secretary\nhave imposed strict limitations on how those funds can be\ndeposited. So whether they go into the general Treasury\nor whether they're handled in this way is really a matter\nof fiscal and revenue and internal governmental policy\nthat I don't think that --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Kneedler, this theory is\none that wasn't brought up at all in Wileman, if I\nremember correctly. And in United Foods, it was brought\nup too late, so the government -- so the Court didn't\nentertain it. The argument that you're making today, I\ntake it, would necessarily displace United Foods as\nhaving any kind of a continuing --\nMR. KNEEDLER: Yes, because the government did\nnot reach the government speech -- or the Court did not\nreach the government speech argument in United Foods.\nAnd, in fact, United Foods is back, on remand. That was a\nreversal of summary judgment for the government. It's\nback, on remand, and is being stayed, pending the outcome\nof this case on government speech. So there would not be\nan inconsistent result in --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You wouldn't want to treat beef\nand mushrooms inconsistently.\n[Laughter.]\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But there is --\nMR. KNEEDLER: -- I think --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- the public perception of\nthese ads -- it says, \"Eat meat\" -- it's quite different\nfrom saying, \"Your government wants you to buy meat.\" And\nthe United States isn't saying that. So --\nMR. KNEEDLER: But what the -- what the United\nStates is doing is responding to this classic collective-\naction problem by establishing a government program to\nmeet the situation where the industry, itself, will -- is\nunable to conduct the advertising because of -- because\nof, what I said, the fungibility of the product --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But then --\nMR. KNEEDLER: -- and all.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- isn't it more realistic to\ndescribe this as the government facilitating the private\nspeech of the many people in this industry who don't have\na big budget to advertise on --\nMR. KNEEDLER: I think --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- on their own?\nMR. KNEEDLER: -- doctrinally, it is government\nspeech. It has the -- it has the benefit of enabling the\npromotion that would have happened in the industry, but\nfor the collective-action problem to occur. But it is\ngovernment speech under this Court's decision.\nIf I may --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Do you want to save your time?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Please.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Garre.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY G. GARRE\nON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS IN 03-1165\nMR. GARRE: Thank you, Justice Stevens, and may\nit please the Court:\nThe First Amendment does not prevent the\ngovernment from speaking out in order to revive and expand\nthe market for the nation's most important agricultural\nproduct.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: If we can just continue on\ngovernment speech, because that's where --\nMR. GARRE: Yes.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- where we left off. It\nseems to me there is something offensive about making a\nparticular portion of the public pay for something that\nthe government says.\nMR. GARRE: Justice Kennedy --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: It ought to be out of the\ngeneral fund.\nMR. GARRE: Justice Kennedy, the assessments in\nthis case are imposed on a class of people who sell\nparticular commodity -- cattle. In that respect, they're\nno different than the types of assessments the Federal\nGovernment has been imposing for centuries on the same of\ncommodities, from the first tax the Federal Government\nimposed on whiskey to the excise taxes on gasoline\nproducers today. And Respondents concede you could do\nthis out of general tax revenues. They concede that you\ncould have a government speech program funded by excises\non certain commodities, like cigarettes or alcohol. There\nis no basis under the First Amendment to carve out a\ndifferent rule in the case of beef.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: What I'm saying, it seems to\nme that the government speech doesn't seem to me to\nadvance your argument very much, because it has problems\nof its own.\nMR. GARRE: Well, we agree with the government\nspeech doctrine, although we also think that the Court can\nuphold the statute under the intermediate-scrutiny\nanalysis. It makes perfect sense for the government to be\nspeaking out in order to correct the market problem that\nCongress identified in the midst of a two-decades-long\ndepression in the beef industry.\nTake the BSE incident last year. BSE imposes a\npotentially catastrophic and overnight impact on the beef\nindustry. In response to that threat, because of the beef\ncheckoff program, the government was able to respond\nimmediately with the funds necessary to respond on a\nnational scale, not only through promotion -- and this is\nan important part in which this case is different from\nUnited Food -- only about half of every checkoff dollar\ngoes to promoting beef through commercial advertising,\nlike the \"Beef, it's what's for dinner\" campaign. The\nrest of that dollar goes to things like producing\ninformation to consumers about the safety of U.S. meat,\nthe -- addressing the health concerns imposed by BSE and\nother potential diseases, like E. coli; going to open up\nforeign markets so that we can export beef -- beef exports\nhave risen dramatically under this program -- and going\nfor things like research in order to identify an early-\ndetection system for BSE. In United Foods, this Court\nemphasized, at least three times throughout its opinion,\nthat the only aspect of the program that was -- the dollar\nwas being collected for was commercial advertising. And,\nJustice Stevens, I think you emphasized that in your\nconcurrence, as well. And this program is much more\nholistic --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but, I mean, that -- the\npart that's good can't save the whole thing, any more than\nin the -- in the union case, the fact that some -- the\nunion dues could be used for some permissible purposes,\nsaved the dues that were being used for impermissible\npurposes. You --\nMR. GARRE: Well, the union --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You don't want to just save\nhalf of this program, do you?\nMR. GARRE: Well, certainly saving half is\nbetter than scuttling the whole --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, all right.\nMR. GARRE: -- thing, Justice Scalia. But the\nunion case is -- the speech that was -- that this Court\nheld could not be funded -- and, after all, in those\ncases, the message was controlled by a non-government\nentity, the union or the state bar. But there, you're\ntalking about political and ideological speech. Here,\nwe're talking about beef production -- producing --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, what's the objection to,\nwhenever you have an ad, you put a little thing in the\ncorner, and it says, \"This advertisement is paid for by\nthe beef industry under a regulation, X-23, of the\nDepartment of Agriculture\"?\nMR. GARRE: Justice Breyer, the program would do\nthat if this Court held it was necessary --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And it wouldn't --\nMR. GARRE: -- under the First Amendment.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- tough, would it?\nMR. GARRE: But --\nJUSTICE BREYER: All you'd have to do is have a\nlittle thing -- and it would just say, \"USDA requires\nthis, under the program,\" and then the whole problem goes\naway.\nMR. GARRE: That's correct. But let me make a\nfew additional --\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right.\nMR. GARRE: -- points. First, as Mr. Kneedler\nemphasized, nothing in the statute, the regulation,\nrequires the ad to say that they're funded by America's\nbeef --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, I -- we realize that. I\nmean, we're getting into it because there's at least a\npotential constitutional problem here.\nMR. GARRE: And let me make another --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: As you respond to Justice\nBreyer's question, would you go the step further and say,\nWhy isn't one possible solution to this difficulty we're\nhaving about government speech a requirement that if you\nwant to justify it as government speech, you put in the\nadvertisement, \"This is the government's position, paid\nfor by the beef producers\"?\nMR. GARRE: The government isn't hiding from --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No --\nMR. GARRE: -- the messages in its pro-beef ads.\nIt -- Justice Souter, the government could do that, but\nit's not hiding from this message. We think that if the\nCourt --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: It seems to be. In fact, there\nwas an indication in the brief that the government had taken\nthe position that if the government came out front and said,\n\"Hey, we're urging you to eat more meat,\" that, in fact,\nit would be very unsuccessful in doing it. It seems to\nwant to hide the ball here.\nMR. GARRE: Well, the government does do that,\nJustice Souter. Last year, during the height of BSE\ncrisis, the President, from his ranch in Texas, urged\nAmericans to eat more beef and told Americans that beef\nwas safe. That's the same message that went out,\nsupervised by the United States Department of Agriculture,\nthrough the Beef Board, to communicate --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Did he --\nMR. GARRE: -- message.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And who paid for that? Did\nthese people pay for that?\nMR. GARRE: The President's message was paid\nthrough general tax dollars. The message under this\nprogram is paid through the assessment. It's the same\nmessage. The message under the Beef Board is carefully\ncontrolled and supervised by the United States Department\nof Agriculture.\nIf I could make a point --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, let's be honest about it.\nLet's be totally accurate. It's not going to say, \"The\ngovernment believes this.\" The government may not believe\nit. What it says is, \"This message is brought to you by\nthe Beef Association under the -- under a program\nrequiring contributions to advertising of the Department\nof Agriculture.\"\nMR. GARRE: And --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Nobody will even know what that\nmeans, but it has the --\n[Laughter.]\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- it has --\nMR. GARRE: Well, that's good.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- it has the virtue of being\ntotally accurate.\nMR. GARRE: That's right. Every single ad that\nwe're aware of, has the beef check, which is the sign that\nthe beef -- or the reasonable observer would know that\nthis is a statute passed by Congress containing a message\nthat Americans should eat more beef, that beef is\nnutritious, that's disseminated under a program that's\ncarefully supervised and controlled by the Secretary of\nAgriculture.\nJUSTICE BREYER: The important thing is, you\nhave no objection to doing that.\nMR. GARRE: We would not, but we also think --\nand if the Court made that clear in this case, it wouldn't\nbe a basis for invalidating the statute; it might be a\nbasis for sending it back or an as-applied challenge.\nImportantly, we --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But what it -- what it would --\nwhat it would be a basis for, at least within the confines\nof this argument, would be a basis for your government\nspeech claim in the sense that you wouldn't be basing a\ngovernment speech claim on what is really a\nmisrepresentation.\nMR. GARRE: It -- we don't think it's a\nmisrepresentation. The speech is funded by America's beef\nproducers. The Respondents in this case, the centerpiece\nof their First Amendment argument --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, including those who don't\nwant to fund it and who don't agree with the message. I\nmean, the problem here is that by making that\nrepresentation, you indicate that this is the message of\nthe people who are paying for it. And some of the people\nwho are paying for it do not wish to convey that message.\nMR. GARRE: We --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: That's the misrepresentation.\nMR. GARRE: With respect, we would disagree.\nThere's no reason to believe that a reasonable observer\nwould think that just because an ad says it's funded by\nthe nation's beef producers, every single one of the\n850,000 individual cattle producers in this country agrees\nwith every single statement --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But what they would --\nMR. GARRE: -- of the message.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- what they would, I think,\nassume is that, in the name, the beef producers do, in\nfact, agree with this, and this is their message. What\nthey would not assume from it is that it is what you and\nMr. Kneedler are claiming, the speech of the Government of\nthe United States. They certainly wouldn't infer that.\nMR. GARRE: We think it's fair to assume, as the\nCourt would under the establishment clause, that they're\nfamiliar with the act of Congress that makes it its message\nas well as a program.\nA critical point on this attribution argument is\nthat it's not supported by any single piece of evidence\nthat Respondents, themselves, have put into the record in\nthis case. Their First Amendment objection is to the\ncontent of the ads. There's not a single piece of evidence\nin the record purporting to make this attribution argument\nthat the public would attribute to the ads to them. It's\nnot in the complaint in this case, it's not in their own\naffidavits, it's not in the --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, maybe --\nMR. GARRE: -- in the --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- maybe it's not because they\ndidn't know you were going to be defending on the basis of\ngovernment speech. That's what's getting us into this.\nMR. GARRE: Well, I highly doubt that, Justice\nSouter, because the First Amendment claim was added in\nresponse to the United Foods case, and this case was\ndeveloped, from the outset, on a government speech theory.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Which wasn't a government\nspeech case.\nMR. GARRE: But it -- the case was tried under\nthe First Amendment, under a government speech argument.\nBut -- so the fact that Respondents didn't put --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: This case, not United Foods.\nBecause United Foods, the Court said it -- it was not\nlegitimately before us.\nMR. GARRE: That's correct. But my point is\nthat the First Amendment case proceeded after United\nFoods. The government's central argument in the trial was\ngovernment speech. The one time attribution came up --\nand this is at pages 46 and 47 of the trial record --\nRespondents' own witness testified that the public was not\nlikely to attribute the message of the pro-beef ad to its\norganization of beef producers. So if the Court finds\nthat attribution is a constitutional concern, it's no\nbasis to bring down the act of Congress on the record in\nthis case.\nThe -- I want to emphasize, if I could, that the\nprogram in this case has been effective. The record\nestablishes that the beef checkoff has had a statistically\nsignificant impact on increasing consumer demand for beef\nand an increase in prices. That's contained in the expert\ntestimony of Professor Ward, at pages 100 and 173. The\nrecord also shows that for every checkoff dollar spent on\nthe program, there's more than a 5.67 rate of return back\nto the beef producers in the form of increased prices for\ncattle. The Beef Board's 2003 report suggests -- finds\nthat the price of a fed steer increased by more than $200\nin the past few years. This program has worked.\nThank you very much.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you.\nMr. Tribe.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF LAURENCE H. TRIBE\nON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS\nMR. TRIBE: Justice Stevens, and may it please\nthe Court:\nAs I was listening to some of the questions\nabout whether it would solve the problem to be more candid\nand say, \"This is your government speaking,\" I thought I\nwould begin with that question, rather than with an\noverview of government speech.\nYou'll recall Wooley v. Maynard, of course, in\nwhich the State of New Hampshire, without sensing the\nirony of its position, said, \"We'll put you in jail if you\ndo not say, 'Live Free or Die' on\" --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But that was --\nMR. TRIBE: -- \"your license plates.\"\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- that was an individual\nattribution. You, yourself, had --\nMR. TRIBE: Yes.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- had to carry this message.\nNow, here you want us to think of some cowboy --\nMR. TRIBE: Well --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- going into the bar, and he\ngets jeered by all his friends because he likes beef.\nMR. TRIBE: Well, Justice Kennedy, my --\n[Laughter.]\nMR. TRIBE: -- my point -- my point was going to\nbe that a footnote on the license plate saying, \"This is\nNew Hampshire speaking,\" would not have helped. But one\nof the central holdings, as I understood it, of United\nFoods, independent of government speech, was that although\nthere is a difference between having to say something\nyourself, having to put it on your car, and having to pay\nfor it, that difference does not go to the existence of a\nFirst Amendment speech objection -- not an association\nobjection, but a speech objection.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Let's first address the\nquestion you said -- you said you were going to address,\nwhether in order to be government speech, within the\nmeaning of our cases, it has to be identified as such. Is\nthat really true? I mean, you know, in World War II, Bob\nHope would appear in movie theaters and say, you know,\n\"Buy war bonds?\"\nMR. TRIBE: Yes, I don't --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: \"This is Bob Hope. You people\nought to go out now\" --\nMR. TRIBE: Justice Scalia, I think, although\nit's an interesting digression about whether the\ngovernment is being candid, the objection here has nothing\nto do with that.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Okay, so it is --\nMR. TRIBE: But being the government --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- it is not essential --\nMR. TRIBE: It may be.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- that government might -- in\norder to be government speech, the government does not\nhave to identify itself as the speaker.\nMR. TRIBE: I --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes or no? Yes or no?\nMR. TRIBE: I think the answer is yes, it must\nidentify itself, but it doesn't help, because --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, it doesn't --\nMR. TRIBE: -- the government --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- we understand that you have\na First Amendment claim, which you're going to have even\nif we say, \"This is not government speech.\" I think the\nwhole point here is to decide whether this is even --\nMR. TRIBE: No, no, Justice --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- an issue that should be\ndisposed of on any grounds other than candor.\nMR. TRIBE: Justice Souter, I think that we're\ngetting off track by assuming that it helps for it to be\ngovernment speech. My point is that a central theme of\nthis --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, just indulge us. I mean,\nsome of us think it makes --\nMR. TRIBE: Let me --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- a difference --\nMR. TRIBE: Well, but --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- and I would --\nMR. TRIBE: -- but let me ask you whether --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- I would like to know whether\nit is essential to its character as government speech that\nthe government's say, \"This your government speaking.\"\nMR. TRIBE: It depends on the purpose for which\nyou are acting whether it's government speech. In Rust v.\nSullivan, even though I think you're certainly right,\nJustice Scalia, that in that opinion it wasn't called\ngovernment speech, in order to rationalize it, in\nRosenberger and Velazquez, it was so described. But the\nquestion there wasn't, \"Can people be made to support it?\"\nThe question, rather, was, \"Can the government insist on\nstaying within the terms of its grants and saying you\ncan't talk about abortion?\" When the question is, \"Can\nthe government force you to support it,\" the \"it,\" if it's\ngovernment speech, doesn't help. The First Amendment\nmakes it a harder case for them, not easier.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It does it all the time in\ngeneral taxes. Every --\nMR. TRIBE: Well --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- time we pay general taxes,\nwe're supporting government speech --\nMR. TRIBE: Of course.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- we may not agree with.\nMR. TRIBE: But the Court has said there is a\nfundamental difference between being singled out, as in\nWooley, to have a license plate, as in Pruneyard, to have\nsomeone on your premises. In Pruneyard, the Court said\nthat one of the reasons it's okay to require someone to\nallow a private speaker onto the premises is that he was\nnot required to support a government slogan. When it is\n--\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Yes, but there it --\nMR. TRIBE: -- government speech --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- there it is your car, your\nproperty. That's not this. This is a generic ad on\nbehalf of beef.\nMR. TRIBE: That was true of --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: I think there is --\nMR. TRIBE: -- that was true of United Foods.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- there's a world of\ndifference between this and having something put on your\nlicense plate or in your --\nMR. TRIBE: Justice O'Connor, I would be much\nmore offended by having to put it in my license plate.\nBut if I were raising cattle, and I were told, as they\nwere told in this case, \"cattle equals beef; that's all\nit's worth, and that's why we won't let you, in these ads\n-- we won't let the ads, that you have to pay for,\nincrease the demands for cattle; only beef\" --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, I don't even understand\nyour argument. Would you still be if the --\nMR. TRIBE: I haven't made it.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, you're trying.\n[Laughter.]\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Would you still be here if\nthere were distinctions made on behalf of free-range beef\nor, you know, \"Our cattle\" --\nMR. TRIBE: Oh, yes.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- \"never had a\" --\nMR. TRIBE: The most important distinction --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- \"medicine\" or something\nlike that? Would you still be here if those distinctions\n--\nMR. TRIBE: Well, if it --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- had been made?\nMR. TRIBE: -- wasn't generic -- there's no way\nfor them to have an ad for every imaginable different kind\nof cattle in one set of advertisements. I just think --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, I'm just --\nMR. TRIBE: -- it's a --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- asking you if,\ntheoretically, some attention had been paid to the\ndifferent kinds of producers --\nMR. TRIBE: Right.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- would you still be\nobjecting?\nMR. TRIBE: We would object, fundamentally, if\nthey did not emphasize American beef. That was our first\nobjection. They said that they don't want to emphasize\nAmerican beef, because, in cross-examination, the officer\nof the Beef Board said, \"Consumers might actually have a\npreference for American beef. That would be irrational.\nWe don't want that.\" And so all of those cattle ranchers\ncan say that, \"We're proud of it being American.\" They\ncan't get that in there.\nAnd the other principal thing is that they don't\nthink of themselves as selling sides of beef. Some of\nthem are selling dairy cattle, some of them are selling --\neven if it's going to, in the end, be in the\nslaughterhouse -- we all die someday -- their fundamental\nbelief is that these are animals, and they're to be cared\nfor. And the reason that that makes a difference -- the\nreason that it makes a difference that they can't even\nadvertise -- try to make live cattle more attractive to\nbuy -- is that the collective-action problem, if that were\nrelevant here -- I think that was really resolved by\nUnited Foods -- but the collective-action problem is\nreally created, not solved, by what they're doing.\nBecause the structure of the market is that there are a\nfew concentrated meat-packers. Something like four\nslaughter 80 percent of the -- of the cattle in the United\nStates. They have the bargaining power. And in the\nrecord, their support for the findings of the District\nCourt, that when the demand for beef goes up through these\ngeneric ads saying, \"Eat beef\" -- although they certainly\ndon't say, \"Your government says you should eat beef,\nbeef, beef\" -- but when the demand for beef goes up, the\nprofit is pocketed by the meat processor, the meat packer,\nthe restaurant, the supermarket. And these guys still end\nup taking their cattle to market, and often having to pay\na dollar checkoff, even though they can't even get the\nprice of the -- of the cattle back. So --\nJUSTICE BREYER: But would it --\nMR. TRIBE: -- the free rides are now taken by\nthe people who don't pay --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- seems to --\nMR. TRIBE: -- the processors don't pay anything.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I understand that a person\ncould have an ideological objection to the content of the\nad. But the ad, itself, is an effort by government, in\nthis area, to regulate a commercial matter, not a license\nplate that says, \"Free Speech, or Die,\" or \"Freedom\" --\nMR. TRIBE: But it regulates speech, Justice\nBreyer.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes, I know. Right now I'm\nasking --\nMR. TRIBE: They don't --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, my question is, does it\nmake a difference for the point of distinguishing, or not\ndistinguishing, \"Live Free, or Die,\" and similar\nideological matters -- does it make a difference that the\nfundamental aim of the program, and 99 percent of the way\nit's carried out, has to do with simple advertising,\ncommercial advertising, the regulation of a commercial\nmatter, commerce --\nMR. TRIBE: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- does that make a difference?\nMR. TRIBE: I think it makes an emotional\ndifference.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But no legal difference.\nMR. TRIBE: Not in the context of forcing people\nto pay.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So, in other words --\nMR. TRIBE: It makes a difference --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- in other words, a program\nthat is a regulatory program regulating commerce, we\nshould no longer think of that, though we tend to think of\nit as quite different in the way we approach the First\nAmendment -- we no longer, in your view, should?\nMR. TRIBE: No, no. I think, certainly if we\nare regulating economic transactions and only dealing with\nspeech in a purely ancillary way -- that is, we're\nregulating sale, transactions --\nJUSTICE BREYER: We regulate advertising. We\nregulate commercial advertising.\nMR. TRIBE: Right, but the --\nJUSTICE BREYER: The Federal Trade Commission --\nMR. TRIBE: -- network --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes.\nMR. TRIBE: -- didn't you say that just the fact\nthat you call it commercial speech only means that when\nyou are regulating problems of a transactional kind --\ndeception, overbearing -- then the fact that it's\ncommercial speech makes a big difference. But you can't\njust generically say that because something doesn't fit\nyour idea of what's ideological -- I mean, to these\nranchers, the ideology --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I didn't say --\nMR. TRIBE: -- is different --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- I didn't say they had a --\nMR. TRIBE: But whose --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- commercial objection.\nMR. TRIBE: -- whose line -- whose line between\nideology and commerce will --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I am asking. In analyzing the\nprogram, there are some things for it, and there are some\nthings against it. And in trying to make that weighing, I\ndo think it's different, because the basis of the program\nis commercial regulation. And so I want to be certain, in\nyour view, that's either correct or incorrect.\nMR. TRIBE: I think it's --\nJUSTICE BREYER: If it's incorrect, I want to\nknow why.\nMR. TRIBE: Well, I think it's -- if one were\njust weighing and didn't have a structured set of\nprinciples on the balance in favor of it, I think, you're\nright, we can't -- they're not trying to induce\nideological conformity. This is not a case where they're\ntrying to enforce what Justice Jackson calls \"the\nunanimity of the graveyard.\" It is a case where the\nspirit of the government is in the right place. The\ngovernment is trying to facilitate collective speech when\n--\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, if it makes a difference,\nthen the lens that I look at this through is called our --\nwhatever the second-tier commercial speech lends.\nMR. TRIBE: I don't think --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Have you looked at --\nMR. TRIBE: That doesn't follow. I don't think\nthat follows. It follows that if you were -- if you were\nwriting on a clean slate and were trying to create a\nwholly new doctrine, one of the things you would look at,\nI suppose, is that this is not a program designed to\ncreate ideological conformity in America. At least the\nspirit of the program is not that. But the road to hell\nis often paved with good intentions, and the means, in\nthis case, that was chosen, was not to have the government\nspend some more money telling people, \"Beef isn't all as\nbad for you as you think.\" The remedy that they are\nchoosing is to pick a group of ranchers and say to them,\n\"You are the ones who are going to pay, and you are going\nto pay for\" --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Tribe, would --\nMR. TRIBE: -- \"ads that are in your name.\"\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- would you comment on the\nargument that -- what will this do to compelling cigarette\nmanufacturers to finance the advertisements against\nsmoking?\nMR. TRIBE: Well, by \"advertisements against\nsmoking,\" Justice Stevens, if you mean, \"Here are the\nthings that will kill you in cigarettes,\" the kind of\nthing that's on the package now, it seems to me that it is\nconstitutional, under even cases like Zauderer, to say\nthat whoever sells a product or a service --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: They have to give warning.\nBut why is the -- why is the cigarette analogy different\nfrom this case? What is your answer to that?\nMR. TRIBE: Well, it seems to me that no one\nsuggests that the cigarette companies are supporting the\nads in California. California is doing exactly what the\nSurgeon General does.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, it's odd that you can be\ncompelled to --\nMR. TRIBE: Say negative things --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- engage in speech that you\ndon't agree with. Now you're saying that the more --\nMR. TRIBE: Right.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- disagreeable it is to you\n--\nMR. TRIBE: Well --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- the more legitimate it is.\nThat's --\nMR. TRIBE: I think if you're --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- a very strange argument.\nMR. TRIBE: Well, it may be strange, but I think\nthat there have been stranger things. The reason that\nit's true is that if you go around doing things that might\nendanger people, it's entirely justifiable for the state,\nas part of its non-speech effort to protect people --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, do you --\nMR. TRIBE: -- from harm, to make you give\nwarnings --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- do you accept the fact\nthat the government can charge taxes on the sale of\ncigarettes and compel -- and use that money to tell people\nthat they're dangerous?\nMR. TRIBE: Well, I think that's a much harder\ncase than this, to be honest with you. I think --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: We do, however.\nMR. TRIBE: Well, California does that.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Is that part of what's going\non?\nMR. TRIBE: In California, it does.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: So what you're arguing here\n--\nMR. TRIBE: Yes.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- is going to have rather a\ndrastic effect on --\nMR. TRIBE: Well, I think the --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- what's going on.\nMR. TRIBE: -- drastic effect would be the other\nway, wouldn't it? If this Court were to hold, despite\nUnited Foods, that it is permissible to force people to\nsupport speech they don't agree with, as long as that\nspeech doesn't fit our sense of what's ideological, that\ncuts to roll back Keller and Lehnert and Abood. It's not\na small part of the constitutional landscape that would be\nunearthed. Whereas, think about what is the marginal\neffect of saying --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Wait, I don't -- I had not\nunderstood you to be arguing, Professor Tribe, that this\nwould be unlawful, even if the money were raised in the\nfashion that it is, just from the -- just from the\ncattlemen. And the government's own program used that\nmoney to say, \"Your government thinks it's -- wants you to\nknow that beef is thoroughly safe. We've done studies.\nBeef is good for you. You should eat more beef.\" I\nthought you --\nMR. TRIBE: No, I do think that would be\npermissible.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That would be permissible?\nMR. TRIBE: Because, I mean, technically, it\nwould solve only the association problem. They're not\nassociated with the message. They're still forced to\nsupport it, but not in any sense different from general\ntaxpayers. And because that's the case, and because it\nwould be an odd formalism to say that it makes a\ndifference whether we segregate that money or not,\nseems to me it would follow that if the government is\nwilling to pay the political cost of having the speech be\nperhaps less persuasive because of -- people's discount for\nwhat the government says and of having to get an appropriation\nfrom the taxpayers -- I mean, taxpayers are smart enough\nto know --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: No, not that. The same\nprogram, but you just have a little tag on the ad.\nMR. TRIBE: Like the lockbox? I mean, every --\nI think the taxpayers know that money is fungible. Well,\nin this case, you mean if you had the program, not from\ngeneral revenue, but you simply said, on the ad, \"This is\nactually part of a government program\"? I don't think\nthat solves any problem, other than deception.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: What's the --\nMR. TRIBE: Deception is the -- my\nconstitutional argument.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- what's the difference\nbetween the checkoff and the excise tax?\nMR. TRIBE: Well, the checkoff in this case is\nmoney that goes to a group, which, though it is\norganized by the government, purports to represent --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So the answer is --\nMR. TRIBE: -- the way it structured --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- where --\nMR. TRIBE: -- these people.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- where the money goes and who\npays out the money for the ad, that's the difference.\nMR. TRIBE: Well, the difference is the whole\nstructure. Keep in mind --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, isn't that the -- isn't\nthat the essential difference between the structure in\nthis case and the structure in the case in which the\ngovernment comes out, saying, \"This is your government,\nsaying, 'Don't smoke.'\"\nMR. TRIBE: Yes, one -- the difference is that\nin one case, we've got Congress, we've got the executive,\nwe have one --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Right.\nMR. TRIBE: -- person, one vote. Here, we have\na million --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I know, but take all that out\nof it -- take all that out of it, and what is your answer\nto Justice Stevens and Justice Souter? That is, look,\nlike this, you have an organization, the Federal Trade\nCommission, say, or that the FDA says, on the one hand,\n(a) broccoli industry, \"Fruits and vegetables are good for\nyou; crib death device, \"Buy anti-crib-death devices; \"Buy\ncar seats for your children\"; or, \"Don't smoke\"; or --\nMR. TRIBE: Well, I mean --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- \"Don't buy a crib without a\ncrib-death device\" --\nMR. TRIBE: -- I mean, I think it's --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- \"or a car without a car\nseat.\"\nMR. TRIBE: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: See? One's negative and one's\npositive. And everything else is the same. Then how do\nyou --\nMR. TRIBE: Whether it's --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- what's the difference?\nMR. TRIBE: -- negative --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes.\nMR. TRIBE: -- or positive, it's the government\n--\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay, maybe it doesn't matter.\nMR. TRIBE: Well, no, it matters, in this sense.\nWhen the government puts out a message and puts its\ncredibility behind the message, likely to have to balance\n-- it's going to say, \"A little broccoli, but a little\nsteak.\" \"Don't risk crib death\" --\nJUSTICE BREYER: But I'm not interested -- I got\nthat point.\nMR. TRIBE: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I'm not dismissing it. I\nunderstand it.\nMR. TRIBE: All right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But I'm not sure --\nMR. TRIBE: So I'm not understanding what your\nquestion is.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, my question is, is it\nimplied in what you're argued that it would be equally\nunconstitutional, in the same way, to tell the cigarette\nindustry to advertise, \"Don't smoke,\" or to tell the\nautomobile industry to advertise, \"Buy car seats for your\nchildren,\" or to tell the crib industry to advertise, \"Be\nsure you have an anti-crib-death device\"?\nMR. TRIBE: I think --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And all that, assuming the\nfinancing is the same as here, everything else the same,\nis it implicit in your argument that they're all equally\nunlawful?\nMR. TRIBE: No. My argument is that you can\nrequire the seller of any commodity to include warnings.\nIt does not necessarily follow that you can say to an\nindustry, \"You're bad guys. We want you to put on an\nadvertising campaign, and the campaign has to have these\ncharacteristics.\" Forcing them to advocate that people\nnot buy their products, I think, is not the same thing --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Tribe --\nMR. TRIBE: -- as forcing them to say --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- I thought --\nMR. TRIBE: -- that it will be addictive or that\nit will cause cancer.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But you're saying --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- I thought --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I want to be sure I -- that I\nunderstood your answer. You can compel them to make\nwarnings. Can you compel them to pay for warnings that\nare just industry-specific, in saying, \"This is dangerous\"\n--\nMR. TRIBE: I think so, because I can't see any\ndifference between saying that -- you put on the package,\n\"The Surgeon General has determined that smoking will\ncause cancer,\" and saying, \"We're going to put on\ntelevision\" --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But it seems --\nMR. TRIBE: -- \"the Surgeon General\" --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- almost ironic, to me, to\nsay that you have a greater power to tell the whole\nindustry to publish something they don't want to publish\nthan you do to let them --\nMR. TRIBE: But that -- Justice Stevens, what --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- pay for what --\nMR. TRIBE: -- what is --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- 90 percent of them want to\nsay.\nMR. TRIBE: -- what is the difference between\ntelling them that -- I mean, there may be a critical\ndifference between the point of sale and a generic ad --\nthat is, the power to regulate the transaction to make\nsure it's safe, includes the power to include on the\npackage certain warnings. The moment you step back from\nthat and say that, \"Because you're in a dangerous\nbusiness, you have to publish general warnings to the\npublic,\" maybe that's where the line has to be drawn,\nbecause I agree that it would be rather bizarre --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Are you limiting your point to\nputting information on the package, or are you saying they\ncould -- could California compel a cigarette -- companies\nto contribute to a large fund which is just used to by\nnewspaper advertising describing the dangers of smoking?\nCould they do that?\nMR. TRIBE: Well, I think that the rationale for\nthat would be far stronger than this. The state's power\nto protect people, in terms of life and health, includes\nthe power to compel --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, but supposing there are\ndisagreements. We were -- you were talking about\ncigarettes. But supposing there's a legitimate\ndisagreement between the industry position and the\ngovernment position --\nMR. TRIBE: Okay.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- could the government,\nnevertheless, insist on the industry financing advertising\nadvocating the government's position?\nMR. TRIBE: Well, not advocating; reporting what\nthe government position is. I mean, the -- when the\ncigarette company says on the package, \"The Surgeon\nGeneral has found this stuff is deadly,\" they're not quite\nsaying, \"We agree with the Surgeon General.\" They've --\nmaking them fund or support statements that do not reflect\ntheir own beliefs, as though it were --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So, in this case --\nMR. TRIBE: -- is impermissible.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- I take it, it would be okay\nif the beef producers had to use a dollar a head to put,\n\"Eating too much beef is dangerous to your health.\"\nMR. TRIBE: Well, if they had -- well, they're\nnot beef producers. I mean, I am troubled by -- they're\n-- these are cattle.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: All right, cattle, then --\nMR. TRIBE: All right? And then -- and then\nthey're trying, ultimately, to brand us as though we are\nslicing these things up and selling them.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But what's the answer to my\nquestion?\nMR. TRIBE: If the question is, can retail\ngrocers be required to put on the beef packages they sell,\n\"The government has determined that the cholesterol\ncontent is dangerous if you have more than X,\" I see no\nreason why that would be harder --\nJUSTICE BREYER: In other words --\nMR. TRIBE: -- to defend than the cigarette\npackage.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I think the question, or at\nleast the version I have of it --\nMR. TRIBE: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- is, we have this case,\nexactly, and the only difference is, instead of getting\nthese people to eat -- say, \"Eat beef,\" what they say do\nis, they get people together and say, \"Don't eat too much\nbeef.\" I put --\nMR. TRIBE: Well --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- \"too much,\" because that --\nMR. TRIBE: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- makes it more realistic.\nAll right, now, does it suddenly become constitutional?\nMR. TRIBE: The program is facially\nunconstitutional. It is the structure that says to all\nthese people, \"You've got to put money into this elaborate\nstructure, which purports to represent you\" -- that is,\nthe -- they have all this stuff saying that the Beef Board\nis related to the industry as board of directors, the\nshareholders -- \"These people, who purport to represent\nyou, will, under the aegis of the government, put out\nstatements at various times.\" That's facially\nunconstitutional.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: All right. Consider this\ntheory. The Congress passes an excise tax. It happens to\nbe a dollar head, on the cattle, just like this so-called\n\"checkoff.\" And the government uses the excise tax\nrevenue to finance advertising, saying -- maybe saying,\n\"Eat more beef,\" maybe advertising, saying, \"Don't eat\nquite so much.\"\nMR. TRIBE: Or maybe --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: First Amendment problem --\nMR. TRIBE: -- talking about the war in Iraq.\nNo, I think that once your taxes enter the general fund,\na pretense that it's --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Including excise?\nMR. TRIBE: Well, I don't think excise taxes are\nsegregated in any way that makes -- that makes it harder\n--\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, I just want to know what --\nMR. TRIBE: -- than Social Security.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- your position is. I just\nwant to know what your position is.\nMR. TRIBE: My position is that once the revenue\nis part of the government's general fund, the government's\nsubject to doctrines that I don't think are First\nAmendment doctrines about government propaganda -- there\nmay be limits on the government's ability --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay, then --\nMR. TRIBE: -- to defend it.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: He's just going back to --\nMR. TRIBE: Subject to that --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay, then it does not have --\nMR. TRIBE: -- it's not a First Amendment\nproblem.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- it's not a First Amendment\nproblem. It does not have the objection that you're\nraising.\nMR. TRIBE: That's correct.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Is that -- is that an answer\nto the question that Justice Kennedy urged in the opening\nargument? That is, it's the same dollar a head, except\nyou call it an excise tax instead of a -- whatever this is\ncalled. The same thing, but to say it's a tax. And\nyou're not -- this is not general revenues that you\ncollect from everybody and spend --\nMR. TRIBE: If the structure is they take the\nmoney from you and put it in this elaborate machinery\nwhich comes out with statements you're forced to support,\nthe statements that don't have behind them the\naccountability checks of the Federal Government, which has\nto answer to taxpayers and answer to the public for the\nstuff it puts out -- that is -- if that's what it is, it\ndoesn't matter what you call it, it remains\nunconstitutional. It remains unconstitutional because\nthese individuals are forced in a way that taxpayers are\nnot -- forced to be part of a system in which, even if you\nhave footnotes saying, \"This is pursuant to the\ngovernment,\" a system in which they will be generally\nunderstood in just the way Justice Breyer said, \"Well, you\nknow, we assume\" --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But suppose --\nMR. TRIBE: -- that these people --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- we don't have that? I\nmean, could then -- could the government fix this problem\nthis way, saying, \"We're going to get the same bucks, but\nwe are going -- and we're going to have the same kinds of\nads, but they're going to be labeled, 'U.S. Department of\nAgriculture.\"\nMR. TRIBE: And we're going to eliminate the\ncattlemen's Beef Board and all of these things --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes.\nMR. TRIBE: -- that are supposed to represent\nyou --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But we are -- but where this\nmoney is coming from to pay this is --\nMR. TRIBE: I would be happy to represent the\ncattlemen in that circumstance, saying, \"You still have\nnot an associational right, but a right not to be singled\nout to support government speech.\" But it would be a\ndifferent and more difficult claim. One.\nTwo, this Court doesn't have before it the\npossibility of rewriting all of this.\nThree, there was a severability provision in an\nearlier version of the law suggesting that maybe if you\ncould lop something off, it would be okay. But that was\neliminated in the current law.\nAnd, finally, any attempts to analogize this to\nthe cases like Lehnert and Keller, in terms of remedy,\nthat maybe we can create some scheme where only the\nobjectionable part is returned, is fundamentally\nincoherent, because what is objectionable here is\nhomogenizing all of these people into some one message,\nand putting it out through this elaborate structure that\npurports to represent them.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: May I go back to one of your\nreasons, which was that they are being singled out to pay\nfor this? They're being singled out to pay for it in the\nexcise tax situation. Do you come to different answers,\ndepending whether it's excise tax or singled out without\nexcise tax, based, essentially, on the ground that there\nis a point beyond which we simply cannot look behind the\nexpenditure of tax revenue? Is that it?\nMR. TRIBE: I think that there's a point beyond\nwhich, for institutional reasons, it would be very\nproblematic for a courts to say that you could trace the\ndollars into the treasury and those institutional reasons\nwould be, I think, an instance of under-enforcement of a\nconstitutional norm, because the underlying constitutional\nprinciple that you ought not to be able, by some gimmick,\nto get some people to support speech they don't believe\nin, that would be there. But the difficulty of having\nthis Court enforce that principle, I think, would be very\nreal. But no such difficulty, I think, is presented in a\ncase like this one, because if this case came out their\nway because of government speech, of course, United Foods\nwould be obliterated, but a good deal more would be\nobliterated, because the theory would have to be that\nbecause it's not on your license plate, because you don't\nhave to carry it, you're only supporting it, then that's\nall the difference in the world. Because, otherwise, its\nbeing government speech would make it worse. But if it's\nall the difference in the world whether you have to carry\nor utter it, or merely support it, then all of the\ndecisions of this Court carefully protecting the rights of\ndissenters in every imaginable kind of organization, from\nthe powerful overriding theory that collective-action\nproblems mean that we've really got to get more speech\nover here than you are willing, yourselves, to engage in\n--\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, but on the other hand --\nMR. TRIBE: -- you'd be --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- you're running into the\nproblem that the taxpayer can be compelled to pay taxes to\nsupport activities that he doesn't support at all. That's\nthe other --\nMR. TRIBE: Well, we do that all the time.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- the other extreme. I know\nwe --\nMR. TRIBE: We do that all --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- do it all the time.\nMR. TRIBE: -- the time.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And when are we crossing --\nMR. TRIBE: That's the --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- the line?\nMR. TRIBE: -- that's why we have elections, in\npart.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Pardon me?\nMR. TRIBE: Right? We have elections, in part,\nbecause the only way -- there's no way to protect every\nindividual's right to have the government's collective\npolicy suit his or her fancy. I mean, that way --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But it is --\nMR. TRIBE: -- would allow complete chaos.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- inconsistent with the basic\nprinciple on which you rely, that the individual should\nnot be compelled to support speech --\nMR. TRIBE: Well --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- with which he disagrees.\nMR. TRIBE: -- to support -- supporting speech\nis somewhat different from supporting activities that you\ndon't agree with. I mean, the First Amendment makes a\nfundamental difference in that respect.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But isn't --\nMR. TRIBE: If there were --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- isn't that --\nMR. TRIBE: I'm sorry.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Don't you go back to the answer\nyou gave me? Sure, when taxes are involved, there may be\nan under-inclusive enforcement of certain individual\nrights, but they have to be under-enforced, because,\notherwise, you simply cannot administer a tax structure.\nMR. TRIBE: Or any structure. I mean, Bowen v.\nRoy -- I mean, there's a sympathetic case of the man who\ndid not want Little Bird of the Snow to be given a Social\nSecurity number. But we could, when we, interactive with\nthe government, say to him, \"You -- we can't make you give\nthe number to get the food for your little daughter,\" but\nif one person says, \"I don't want numbers in your\ncomputers,\" and the other says, \"I don't want letters, I\nwant only numbers,\" the fact that every individual who has\na potential claim on a collective choice could pull in a\ndifferent direction means we can't run a system that way.\nBut no such problem is presented in cases like this.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you, Mr. Tribe.\nMR. TRIBE: Thank you.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I think we understand your\nposition. Thank you.\nMr. Kneedler, you have about three -- three or\nfour minutes.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER\nON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS IN 03-1164\nMR. KNEEDLER: Thank you, Justice Stevens.\nMr. Tribe has conceded that if this program were\nfinanced by a system of excise taxes that went into the\ngeneral Treasury, and Congress then paid -- provided the\nexact same amount of money to produce the exact same ads,\nthat there would be no constitutional problem. And, in\nour view, the First Amendment simply does not regulate the\ndetails of government fundraising, the details of\ngovernment accounting, and the details of government\nbookkeeping in that manner. The First Amendment is --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But that goes back to\nFrothingham and Mellon, and Massachusetts versus Mellon,\nand United States versus Butler, where we could trace the\namount.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Right, and --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: It's old stuff.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Right, and the Court -- the Court\nsuperceded those decisions in cases like Carmichael Coal\nand Storaasli Company and cases like that, where the Court\nsaid excise taxes can be imposed. As long as there is a\npublic welfare justification, they can be spent. And it\nwould be an odd result to have the First Amendment drive\nthe way the government arranges a system like this. After\nall -- and Professor Tribe said it would be different if\nthe cattlemen's Beef Board were gotten rid of. It\nactually -- the principal point here is the Secretary\ncontrols the speech. Whatever the cattlemen's Beef Board\ndoes -- and that is a government entity -- the Secretary\ncontrols the speech. So that -- this is not some jury-\nrigged system; this is a system of governmental control.\nCongress has prescribed the message, and the Secretary\ncarries it out.\nIt's important to recall that many federal\nexcise taxes go into dedicated trust funds -- for\nhighways, for other functions like that. And out of that\ndedicated trust fund, there may be money expended on\nhighway safety. So the fact that it's dedicated really\nshould not matter.\nAnd this case is completely different from cases\nlike Keller. In Keller, the state bar was not appointed\nby the -- by the government, there was no governmental\nsupervision of what it did, and the government certainly\ndid not approve the messages in favor of nuclear freezes,\net cetera. This is different in all the critical ways\nthat make this a program of government speech.\nAnd, as Justice O'Connor pointed out, to strike\ndown this program would have drastic consequences. There\nare many, many agricultural promotion programs like this.\nThere are 13 at the national level. This program has been\nin existence since 1988. One billion dollars has been\ncollected, and promotions have been conducted under it.\nThese promotional programs go back to the '50s, and even\n-- and even earlier. And there are many programs on the\nstate levels, as the amicus brief filed by the states in\nthis case shows. This Court would be striking down a lot\nto hold that this commonsense way of approaching things is\nunconstitutional.\nIt's also important to recognize that the\nultimate beneficiary of the advertising is the consumer.\nYes, it affects the industry, but it's the consumer. And\nthe very first finding that Congress made in the Beef Act\nis, beef and beef products are basic foods that are a\nvaluable part of the human diet. When the -- when the --\nbecause of the collective-action problem in this industry,\nthat it cannot organize to advertise, that basic message\nis not getting to consumers. So this -- the\njustifications for this, to the extent one thinks of it in\nterms of the commercial speech, it is squarely within the\nultimate purposes of the commerce speech doctrine, which\nis to correctly market failure with respect to advertising\nin order to get information to consumers.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you, Mr. Kneedler. The\ncase is submitted.\n(Whereupon, at 11:06 a.m., the case in the\nabove-entitled matter was submitted.)\n"
