HAMILTON\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. HAMILTON: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and\nmay it please the Court:\nFrom the enactment of the 1966 Highway Safety\nAct, a congressional report, specifically number 17 to the\n89th Congress, which is quoted on page 2 of the blue\nbrief, congressional reports noted that, quote, no other\npart of the State program is as basic to ultimate success,\nnor as demanding of complete cooperation, end quote, as\nState collection of accident reports, because they are the\nbasis for hazard identification and correction.\nHowever, soon after the 1973 Highway Safety Act\nmade accident data collection a condition to Federal\nhazard elimination funds the Secretary of Transportation\nreported to Congress that States strongly objected,\nbecause they feared that their collection of accident data\nwould be used against them in damage actions. Because of\nthis, unintended liability exposure threatened the\nintegrity and proper operation of a cooperative Federal-\nState program that has saved thousands of lives --\nQUESTION: Would you help us figure out how to\ninterpret this statute?\nMR. HAMILTON: Yes, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: It says data, highway safety data\ncompiled or collected by a State. Now, I suppose that in\na crossing like we have here, where there might have been\naccidents from time to time, that there would be police\nreports or highway officer reports of motor vehicle\naccidents at that site, right?\nMR. HAMILTON: Yes, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: And those presumably are not either\ncompiled or collected for the purpose of getting highway\nfunding from the Federal Government. They're compiled, I\ngather, to serve the normal functions of law enforcement.\nMR. HAMILTON: Your Honor, no, that's not\ncompletely correct.\nQUESTION: No?\nMR. HAMILTON: They are collected and compiled\nfor purposes of highway hazard identification --\nQUESTION: Isn't --\nMR. HAMILTON: -- from the very beginning.\nQUESTION: Well, don't you suppose that at least\nin some jurisdictions, maybe not Tacoma, but in some\njurisdictions you will find just ordinary police\nreports --\nMR. HAMILTON: Well, it's my --\nQUESTION: -- of accidents, and sometime later,\nperhaps the State might decide, or the county, I'd like to\nhave some Federal money to make some changes at that\ncrossing, and maybe we can use some of the data to\nassemble it to try to apply for Federal money. Now, how\nshould we interpret that statute?\nMR. HAMILTON: Well, in the -- if I understand\nthe hypothetical, the -- Your Honor is postulating a\nsituation where there is an accident report purely State\nin origin. Just to help the Court, I don't know that such\na thing exists after the crash data forms. It's to be\nunderstood that the Department of Transportation has been,\nsince 1966, working with the States to develop a uniform\ncrash data form, and that -- I think it's becoming more\nand more successful as that goes on, so I'm --\nQUESTION: So your point is that the police\nofficers are using a kind of a unified Federal traffic\nreport --\nMR. HAMILTON: Essentially --\nQUESTION: -- when there's an accident?\nMR. HAMILTON: The forms are not all the same,\nbecause each State has the right to choose how to put it\ntogether, but the elements of the forms are dramatically\nFederal in their nature, and they're Federal totally\ndirected toward the issue of highway design. That's\nwhy -- Nation-wide there was a report cited by the\nWashington State amici and multi-State amicus, amici\nbriefs that pointed out that Nation-wide before 1966 there\nwas no standard at all.\nQUESTION: Well, let me ask you this. At page\n20 of the respondent's brief we have four different\ninterpretations, possible interpretations of the acts set\nforth. Do we have to choose among those in order, as a\npredicate before reaching the constitutional issue, and\nI'll just -- and this is in line with Justice O'Connor's\nquestion. If we took the most expansive view of the\nalternatives that she presents, then the opinion that we\nwould write, it seems to me, would be different than if we\ntook the more narrow, the most narrow view, and that leads\nme to the question, do we have to have a statutory\nconstruction at the beginning point of our holding?\nMR. HAMILTON: I don't believe so, Your Honor,\nand the county's position, and we believe it's well-\nfounded, is that the constitutional issue is not an excuse\nfor artificially narrowly interpreting --\nQUESTION: Well, but I think that our Court has\nalways preferred, along the lines suggested by Justice\nO'Connor and Justice Kennedy, to construe a statute to\navoid constitutional problems if we can, and certainly the\nrespondents here at least suggest there are several\ndifferent constructions. Are you not prepared to say\nwhich of those you favor?\nMR. HAMILTON: Well, I've -- I'm happy -- in\nfact, I had intended to, if given the opportunity, to\nprovide the Court the way the county believes the statute\nshould be interpreted.\nQUESTION: Well, I'll give you that opportunity\nright now.\nMR. HAMILTON: Okay.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: Yes, that's our question, and you\nmight bear in mind if you wish that I think we generally\nconstrue evidentiary privileges narrowly.\nMR. HAMILTON: Yes. However, as the Court\npointed out on that issue of narrow construction that --\nin the Shapiro case, I believe, which was also a raw data\ncase whose purpose was to encourage participation, that\neven after quoting the standard, the test of a narrow\nconstruction -- the test was first put to Congress'\nintent, and that the issue of, you know, that particular\nrule of construction is not to be used in a way to\nartificially narrowly interpret what Congress meant, and\nif Congress meant something, then that's the test.\nTo answer Justice -- Chief Justice Rehnquist's\nquestion, how does the county say the statute should be\ninterpreted, pretty much we agree with the logic of the\nUnited States Solicitor General, but just would suggest\nthat the, their logic be extended to what we believe is\nthe logical conclusion. In other words, we disagree with\nplaintiffs that it only covers generated documents,\nbecause under 409 that's interpretation conflicts with\nwhat this Court has said the plain meaning of compiled\nmeans, as this Court has discussed in the John Doe case\ncited to the Court.\nAlso, this reads out of 409 the express\nprotection also of data collected, not just generated. It\nignores the legislative history of why 409 was amended,\nand why it used the language compiled --\nQUESTION: You're telling us what's wrong with\nthe other reading. Which is your reading?\nMR. HAMILTON: Our reading, Your Honor, is that\nthere should be -- this Court should establish a bright\nline rule that documents collect -- as the language says,\nfor -- we would ask the Court to enforce the language of\nthe statute, which reads, documents and data, quote,\ncompiled or collected for the purpose, end quote, of\nspecified highway safety programs, and here's the\noperative language, quote, shall not be subject to\ndiscovery or admitted into evidence in a Federal or State\nproceeding or considered for any other purposes in any\naction for damages arising from any occurrence at a\nlocation mentioned or addressed in those documents or\ndata. In other words --\nQUESTION: It doesn't say documents. I mean,\nyou quoted it, you began the quote after --\nMR. HAMILTON: Yes --\nQUESTION: -- after the noun.\nMR. HAMILTON: Yes. I --\nQUESTION: The noun you inserted was documents.\nMR. HAMILTON: Yes. There are specific --\nQUESTION: It says --\nMR. HAMILTON: -- references to specific types.\nQUESTION:\nMR. HAMILTON: It says data, and also lists\nreports, lists -- and that sort of thing, and I was trying\nto condense it down, but yes.\nQUESTION: To be plain, do you mean that\neverything that goes to the Public Works Department,\neverything that eventually gets to the Public Works\nDepartment and is relevant to the safety of highway\ncrossings is exempt from discovery?\nMR. HAMILTON: Yes, Your Honor, that is what\nwe're saying.\nQUESTION: Every fact, so that if the Department\nof Environmental Protection has prepared a report saying\nthe accidents are wrecking the grass and the flowers at an\nintersection, and that report is then given to whatever\nthe data collection agency here is for this purpose, that\nall of that data, including the data in the Department of\nEnvironmental Protection, is then covered by the\nprivilege? Is that your position?\nMR. HAMILTON: To the extent that that\ncharacterization goes to the data that's in the reports.\nIt's not to say that -- all we're saying --\nQUESTION: That's my question.\nMR. HAMILTON: Yes.\nQUESTION: The same data is in the environmental\nreport.\nDoes the data, even in the hands of the Environmental\nDepartment, become subject to the privilege at that point,\non your reading?\nMR. HAMILTON: We believe the -- again, if it\nmeets the test of dealing with an occurrence at a --\nagain, following the language of the statute, an\noccurrence at the location mentioned or addressed in such\nreports in the damage action, then that report that it's\ncollected and compiled by --\nQUESTION: I'm not talking about the report.\nI'm talking about the fact which is reported.\nMR. HAMILTON: Yes.\nQUESTION: The data in the report.\nMR. HAMILTON: Well --\nQUESTION: Does that -- does that data --\nQUESTION: You can answer that yes or no.\nQUESTION: -- become subject to the privilege?\nMR. HAMILTON: Yes, if Your Honor means, when\nyou say data, going to the report to get the data, to --\nif you were to -- if that person wanted to raise that\nissue were to go to the person who, or the entity that\ncreated that information, and were to depose that, those\npeople, they could get the information that way. All\nwe're talking about --\nQUESTION:\nquestion, I guess, is no, the data does not become, as\nsuch, subject to the privilege. It's only the data as\nheld by the collection agency. You can still go to the\nEnvironmental Department, depose them, get your\ninformation?\nMR. HAMILTON: Yes, you can.\nQUESTION: Okay.\nMR. HAMILTON: Yes, and I'm sorry I\nmisunderstood you.\nQUESTION: Well, could you --\nQUESTION: What if you don't have to depose\nthem?\nQUESTION: -- go to the Police Department under\nthis uniform Federal form you were telling us about it?\nMR. HAMILTON: I'm sorry, I missed the question.\nQUESTION: You said at the outset that there's a\nuniform document for collisions or crashes or something.\nMR. HAMILTON: Yes.\nQUESTION: And the Police Department fills it\nout. Can you go to the Police Department and get that\ninformation?\nMR. HAMILTON: Under our interpretation, you\ncould find the officer, you could depose the officer, but\nyou cannot get the report if it's collected and filed for\nhazard identification.\nQUESTION: Well, so then Justice Souter's\nhypothetical is different from this. You said in Justice\nSouter's hypothetical that you could go to that Department\nand get the document, but if you go to the Police\nDepartment you can't get the document.\nMR. HAMILTON: No --\nQUESTION: You didn't say he could get the\ndocument.\nMR. HAMILTON: No.\nQUESTION: You said you could depose him --\nMR. HAMILTON: Yes.\nQUESTION: -- and that was what my question was\ngoing to be. Are you drawing a distinction between\ngetting the document that was generated in the\nEnvironmental Agency and deposing the person who made the\ndocument?\nMR. HAMILTON: Yes, Your Honor. That's a\ndistinction that the cases make --\nQUESTION: Why? It says data. I don't care\nabout the cases. I care about the text of the statute.\nIt says data. It's data whether it's in a document or\nwhether it's in some deponent's head. Data is data.\nMR. HAMILTON: I think that certainly is a fair\ninterpretation of the statute. What we're trying to do is\nsynthesize how the courts have looked at this, and they\nhave drawn the distinction saying that really what the\npurpose of this was to put plaintiffs back in the position\nthey were before. All this mechanism of creating accident\ndata existed beforehand. That's what they had to do.\nThey didn't have this silver platter.\nQUESTION: They could get a police report of an\naccident. Isn't that standard routine in negligence\ncases?\nMR. HAMILTON: Your Honor, before the 1966\nHighway Safety Act they could not get an accident, a\ncollection of accident reports, at least in Washington\nState, and it's my understanding Nation-wide, just by\nasking for them --\nQUESTION: But you could certainly get a\npolice -- at least judging from my own practice in Arizona\nyou could certainly get an individual police report of an\naccident.\nMR. HAMILTON: Yes. If you knew the -- and\nthat's the point. You essentially have to know what\nplaintiffs are trying to find out to get the document,\nbecause you couldn't ask for all the accidents at this\nintersection. You could ask for a date and people\ninvolved, but you couldn't ask for, give me all the\naccidents at a particular intersection.\nQUESTION:\nreport of the particular accident that you were concerned\nwith.\nMR. HAMILTON: Prior to 1966, yes, Your Honor,\nthat's correct. That's --\nQUESTION: I'm still slightly mixed up.\nMR. HAMILTON: Okay.\nQUESTION: Imagine the forest service in the\nState collects, because they have tree lovers, a piece of\npaper that says the elm trees at the intersection of such-\nand-such were diseased, all right. Now, that's done for\npurposes of tree health, and there's a piece of paper in\nthe environmental tree section which has that written\nright on it, and one day the Transportation Department for\nsafety reasons says, send us a Xerox of that, okay.\nThe question I think Justice Souter was asking\nand Justice Scalia, and I would certainly ask, is, in your\nview, when they send a subpoena or discovery to the tree\ndepartment to get that piece of paper, can they get it?\nMR. HAMILTON: No.\nQUESTION: No?\nMR. HAMILTON: No.\nQUESTION: Very well. Suppose that the\nTransportation Department one day wrote a witness' name\ndown, an address which they got from the internal State\ngovernment telephone book.\nplaintiff go and ask for a telephone book? The answer, I\nguess, is no.\nMR. HAMILTON: Let me think about that for a\nminute.\nQUESTION: Well, I don't see what the difference\nwould be. They didn't collect the telephone book for\npurposes of -- they didn't make the telephone book for the\npurposes of accidents, but one day somebody went to the\ntelephone book and copied some information out of it for\nthe purpose of accidents --\nMR. HAMILTON: I think what they copied --\nQUESTION: -- and that's why, you see, exactly\nwhy I find your interpretation of the statute rather\nstrained, so what is the answer to what my hypothetical\nsuggests?\nMR. HAMILTON: Well, since my answer would be\nstrained if I said the photo, the telephone book, what I'm\nreferring to would be what was written down for the\npurposes, and collected for the purposes --\nQUESTION: But you said that they could not get\nthe piece of paper --\nMR. HAMILTON: Yes.\nQUESTION: -- in the Tree Division --\nMR. HAMILTON: The --\nQUESTION:\ndistinguishing between the piece of paper written for tree\nhealth and the address in the telephone book written so\npeople can know where people should be phoned.\nMR. HAMILTON: The piece of paper written for\ntree help -- and I'm sorry I misunderstood the question.\nI thought the Court was asking about the telephone book.\nThe telephone book, no. The piece of paper that was\nwritten down from that, yes, because that's collected and\ncompiled, and that's really what the SHOTS case said, that\nif there's a question about this of whether this was\nreally fairly included for the purposes of 152, then for\nthat purpose you have an in camera inspection.\nQUESTION: But what is there that suggests that\nCongress wanted to change the game to that extent? One\ncan understand what you've suggested before, wanting to\nkeep personal injury plaintiffs in the same place they\nwere before this legislation, but your interpretation\ntakes away from plaintiffs things that they would have had\naccess to before.\nMR. HAMILTON: Your Honor, we -- respectfully,\nwe disagree with that characterization of our position.\nQUESTION: Well, you just, in response to the\nChief's question, said that at least the police report of\nthis accident was routine.\nMR. HAMILTON:\naccident, when you go and ask for -- and the reason why is\nbecause -- because of the Highway Safety Act, 1966 Highway\nSafety Act, the accident reports were indexed by location.\nYou could go and get a specific report if you knew the\nfacts enough of the accident, but only that accident\nreport, not all of them, and that is how 409 --\nQUESTION: But that's not because of a\nprivilege, is it?\nMR. HAMILTON: Yes. It is because of a\nprivilege.\nQUESTION: I thought the reason for that is the\npolice said, look, we don't have to do your homework for\nyou. If you know what you want, we'll give it to you. If\nyou don't know what you want, we don't have to search for\nit. Isn't that the reason?\nMR. HAMILTON: Yes, because the police don't do\nthat. The police don't care about highway design factors\nother than because the form asks them to.\nQUESTION: Okay, so in the past, then, and in\naccordance with Justice Ginsburg's question, you could\nhave asked for the police report, and in Justice Breyer's\nexample, I presume you could have gone to the Tree\nDivision and said, let's have the slip of paper that says\nthe elm trees are diseased. Now, you can't do that.\nMR. HAMILTON:\nthat --\nQUESTION: And Justice Ginsburg's question is, I\nthought it was supposed to leave things, as it were,\nlevel, the way they were, that a disadvantage was not\nbeing created, it was simply, the intent was simply to\navoid creating a new advantage which would deter the\nState. Isn't that the way we should read the statute?\nMR. HAMILTON: I think the purpose, yes, Your\nHonor, is to avoid discouraging States from participating,\nand allowing them to get accident reports from the hands\nof third parties does discourage States from\nparticipating.\nQUESTION: Would you like to reserve your time?\nMR. HAMILTON: Yes, I would, Your Honor. Thank\nyou very much.\nQUESTION: Mr. Clement.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS INTERVENOR\nMR. CLEMENT: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and\nmay it please the Court:\nThe 1995 amendment to section 409 is, contrary\nto the determination of the Washington State Supreme\nCourt, constitutional. The provision protects data that\nis compiled and collected for purposes of applying for\nFederal highway funds from being used in State and Federal\ncourt litigation. The documents at issue are inherently\nFederal in character, and so Congress has the power to\nprohibit the use of those documents in both Federal and\nState court litigation.\nQUESTION: Well, what about documents created\nnot for the purpose of getting Federal funds, not for\nsection 152, but for some other purpose, some of which are\nlater incorporated in a Federal funding application --\nMR. CLEMENT: I think those documents --\nQUESTION: -- by a different agency?\nMR. CLEMENT: I think those documents, Justice\nO'Connor, would be discoverable and admissible if the\ndocuments were sought from the party that collected them\nfor a purpose different than the Federal highway funding\npurposes, but what the statute, I think, does prohibit is\nsomebody going to the State Highway Traffic Department and\nessentially engaging in a one-stop shopping enterprise\nwhere they can get all sorts of documents that have been\ncollected --\nQUESTION: But you differ from petitioner in\nyour reading of the statute. Yours is much narrower, I\ntake it.\nMR. CLEMENT: That's exactly right, Justice\nO'Connor, and so as a result of our interpretation of the\nstatute, the typical police accident report can be\nobtained from the Police Department and, I think with\nrespect to Justice Breyer's hypothetical, the report about\nthe tree can be obtained from the State Tree Department or\nthe State Environmental Department.\nQUESTION: Let me ask a somewhat different\nquestion, although I'm not sure we've resolved the point\nthat we've been inquiring about. Would a State have the\nright to waive this privilege?\nMR. CLEMENT: I think that's a difficult\nquestion, Justice Kennedy. I think that as you know, as a\ngeneral matter evidentiary privileges are waivable, and\nso -- and that's the proposition this Court has\nestablished in cases like Menzonato and Hill, but there is\na sense in which this privilege exists, in our view,\nprimarily for the benefit of the Federal Government, so\nthat we can obtain accurate, complete, and candid\nassessments of highway traffic safety requirements, and\nso, there's a suggestion, for example, in the Hill\ndecision at footnote 3 that, when a third party's\ninterests are at stake, that the court may not find waiver\nunder those circumstances as readily as it would\notherwise, so our view I think would be that although the\nCourt need not definitively resolve it in this case,\nthere's a strong argument that the privilege would not be\nwaivable.\nQUESTION: Let me just interrupt you, if I may.\nAre you saying that the lawyer defending the county, if\nthe plaintiff called him up and said, I'd like to see\nthese reports, and the lawyer said, well, they're\nprivileged, but I think I'll give them to you because I\nthink it's in everybody's interests to know the facts,\nthat would violate the Federal statute?\nMR. CLEMENT: I think the admissibility of those\nmaterials --\nQUESTION: I'm just asking you about showing\nthem to the plaintiff.\nMR. CLEMENT: I think there's a sense in which\nit would violate the Federal statute, but I'm not\nsuggesting that the Department of Transportation is going\nto be able to leap to the defense of the statute in that\nhypothetical and assert the interests of the statute. I\nthink, however, if a State wanted to take a systematic\npolicy of disregarding section 409, I think that would\nimplicate the Federal interests, and I'm not sure that a\nState would be able to do it.\nQUESTION: Well, supposing this simply comes up\nduring a trial. A witness is put on the stand, asked\nabout the preparation of a report, and the State doesn't\nobject, and it would be objectionable under the statute.\nNow, is that something that could be challenged on appeal,\nsay?\nMR. CLEMENT: I don't think so, Chief Justice.\nI think it is something that could be procedurally\ndefaulted, but I do think if in a case like that the State\nwent to the trial judge and said, look, there is this\nprovision of Federal law, section 409, that says this\nmaterial can't come in, but we're happy to just disregard\nthat provision, I think the trial court might well be\nwithin its rights to say that no, we're not going to\ndisregard that provision of Federal law, we're going to\nkeep the material out, but I do think it could be --\nQUESTION: With these rights, is it a matter of\ndiscretion for the trial court? I mean, it would be one\nthing to say it's mandatory, it's a Federal requirement,\nand now you're suggesting that the lawyer can overlook it,\nand the court could or must act on its own?\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, I'm suggesting that the\nlanguage of the statute is mandatory. It says that it\nshall not be admitted, so I think if the language is\nbrought to the attention of the trial court judge, he or\nshe would be in a position where they ought to exclude the\nevidence.\nQUESTION: How would this be enforced by the\nFederal Government? I understand, and correct me if I'm\nwrong, that the Federal funding is not tied to the 409\nprivilege, but is tied to the 152 reporting obligations,\nso what Federal enforcement would there be for a county\nthat says, we think it's fair for the plaintiff to have\naccident reports, so we'll give them.\nWhat Federal -- how would that mandatory\nrequirement that you just stated be enforced by Federal\nauthorities?\nMR. CLEMENT: I think under the circumstances\nthat you're envisioning, Justice Ginsburg, the Federal\nGovernment would not provide funds under 152 or 130 or 144\nto that particular locality.\nQUESTION: So you're saying that the 409\nprivilege is not simply a right of the State agency, but\nis -- that the funding depends on the State's asserting\nthat privilege?\nMR. CLEMENT: It certainly depends on the States\nor the localities abiding by that privilege as a general\nmatter. I don't think a State or a locality can take a\ncavalier position of saying, we're just not going to be\nbound by the provisions of this Federal statute, but yet\nwe'd still like to take the money under those three\nstatutes. I don't think that's permissible, and the\nreason is, is that section 409, although it may benefit\nthe State in a particular litigation, does serve an\nimportant Federal interest, and that is the interest in\ngetting complete and candid information to assess and to\naward Federal highway funds.\nBy analogy, I would suggest this Court look to\nits decision in the Buckman Company v. Plaintiff's\nCommittee case, because in that case this Court recognized\nthat the FDA approval process, and the process for\napplying for FDA approval, is inherently Federal in\ncharacter, and so this Court preempted State tort law that\nmight distort the effect of applying for FDA approval.\nIn the same way, the process of applying for\nFederal highway funds and the documents that are used for\nthat purpose have an inherently Federal character, and so\nthe Federal Government has an interest in making sure that\nthe information provided to the Federal Government is\naccurate and complete, and it has an ability, Congress has\nthe power to take those essentially Federal documents and\nprotect them both in State and Federal court litigation.\nNow, I would suggest that the answer to the\nwaiver question, unlike the answer to the statutory\nconstruction question, is not a necessary component of\nthis Court's decision. We think the better view is that\nit could be -- is that it could not be waived, at least in\ngross. Of course, if it could be waived, I think that is\nan additional answer to any accountability questions that\nmay arise, but again, we think the better view is that it\ncan't be waived.\nQUESTION: Mr. Clement, one of the arguments\nmade by respondent Guillen is that -- is a Tenth Amendment\nargument. Do you think he has standing to make that\nargument?\nMR. CLEMENT: I think the better view is that he\ndoesn't have standing to raise that argument, and I'll\nalso suggest that if they wanted to make a Tenth Amendment\nargument, and wanted this Court to decide the difficult\nquestion of whether or not an individual had standing to\nraise a Tenth Amendment argument, that they probably\nshould have raised the Tenth Amendment argument before the\nconclusion section of their brief, and I think this Court\nwould be well-advised not to definitively decide whether\nor not an individual had standing to raise a Tenth\nAmendment issue. I --\nQUESTION: Why -- what's special about the --\nthis is just an assertion that the Federal Government has\nno authority to do what it has done, and you say an\nindividual who has been harmed by the Federal Government's\nexceeding its authority does not have standing to\nchallenge? It seems to me we do it all the time.\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, Justice Scalia, I don't\nthink all Tenth Amendment challenges are created equal,\nand I think therein lies the difference.\nAmendment challenge is, is a mirrored reflection of\nCongress not having the enumerated power to enact a\nstatute --\nQUESTION: But that's all it --\nQUESTION: How about a Commerce Clause\nchallenge?\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. CLEMENT: Absolutely. In those kind of\ncases, the individual does have standing, but this Court\non various occasions has suggested that there's an\nadditional component to the Tenth Amendment, that it's not\njust a reflection of the enumerated powers of Congress,\nbut, rather, there are certain special areas of State\nprerogatives that the Federal Government can't intrude\nthrough congressional acts.\nQUESTION: Well, we allow those challenges all\nthe time in separation of powers cases.\nMR. CLEMENT: I think that's right, but Justice\nKennedy, I think there's something that certainly seems\ndifferent. If the gravamen of the complaint is that\nthere's some element of State sovereignty that Congress\ncannot intrude upon, and the State doesn't object to that\nintrusion, it seems odd that the individual would have\nthird party standing to raise that objection.\nQUESTION:\nfor the Executive and the legislature in a case like\nChadha?\nMR. CLEMENT: Again, I think you could, and I\nthink that's why with respect to a more typical Tenth\nAmendment challenge that's based on an enumerated power,\nor the lack of an enumerated power, there would be\nstanding. I think what this Court suggested --\nQUESTION: I don't -- whenever the Government\ngoes beyond its enumerated power, it is infringing upon\nthe powers of the States, isn't it?\nMR. CLEMENT: Well --\nQUESTION: All the Tenth Amendment says is, you\nknow, other than the enumerated powers, the other powers\ncontinue where they used to be, with the States. In other\nwords, I don't see anything special about a Tenth\nAmendment claim.\nQUESTION: In Buckley v. Valeo we held that the\nAppointment Clause, where the President had signed the\nlegislation, could be raised by private individuals.\nMR. CLEMENT: No, I understand that, and that\nwas also true in Chadha. I think if there is a\ndifference, and this Court suggested there might be a\ndifference in the TVA case, if there is a difference it's\nbecause there are certain Tenth Amendment challenges that\nhave the nature of just an intrusion on State sovereignty\nthat's particularized. The hypothetical that the cases\nhave often talked about is moving a State capital, and if\nthe State doesn't object to moving the State capital, it's\nhard to see why an individual ought to be able to raise\nthat question.\nI think the more important point, though, for\nthis case is that there was a suggestion to this effect in\nthis Court's TVA decision. If this Court wants to revisit\nthat decision, it probably doesn't want to do it in a case\nwhere the Tenth Amendment challenge is not properly raised\nand isn't even raised at all in the briefing before this\nCourt until the conclusionary section of the brief.\nWith respect to the enumerated powers questions,\nwhich I think are the gravamen of respondent's case and\nthe Washington Supreme Court's decision, there's no\nquestion the individual has standing. That was true in\nthis case, in this Court's decision in United States v.\nLopez and would be equally true here.\nAnd I think this Court can take comfort in\nknowing that this is, at bottom, an enumerated powers\ncase, not a Tenth Amendment case in any specialized sense,\nbecause the Washington State Supreme Court found it\nunobjectionable that section 409 would apply in its pre-\n1995 amendment version, and what that indicates is that\nthere's nothing sacrosanct about State courts' procedures,\nor State evidentiary rules.\nQUESTION: Don't you think that our opinion in\nthe Commerce Clause case, in order to have persuasive\nforce, should begin with an interpretation of the statute,\nrecognize that a privilege can be waived or not waived? I\nfind it very difficult to see how this opinion can be\nwritten when we're not sure of the reach of the statute.\nMR. CLEMENT: I agree with you entirely, Justice\nKennedy, that this Court should define the scope of the\nstatute before deciding whether or not it's\nconstitutional, and we would urge the United States'\nconstruction of the statute.\nI would say that the waiver question is somewhat\ndifferent. I don't think the constitutionality of the\nstatute turns on the waiver question. If the Court\ndisagrees, we would urge the Court first to find that this\nprivilege is not waivable at least in gross and, second,\nthat even if it is waivable, the statute remains\nconstitutional.\nQUESTION: Do we have a final State decision\nhere, Mr. Clement?\nMR. CLEMENT: I think you do have a final State\ndecision, and I think that's most clear with respect to\nthe PDA action -- that's the State Public Disclosure Act\nthat was brought -- because in that case the Washington\nSupreme Court held that the four documents were\ndisclosable and said that attorney's fees would be\nappropriate. In this --\nQUESTION: There was a fifth document, though,\nand they didn't -- there was no appeal on that one, right?\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, but there was no cross-\nappeal on that document either, Justice Scalia, so I think\nthat document is no longer part of the case. When the\nWashington Court of Appeals held that four of the five\ndocuments needed to be disclosed, Pierce County took an\nappeal to the Washington State Supreme Court, but I don't\nthink that the Guillens filed a cross-appeal suggesting\nthat the fifth document ought to be disclosed, and so I\nreally think the fifth document is no longer in the case,\nand since the Washington Supreme Court found that\nattorney's fees were appropriate, that means that there\nwas a final judgment. That's true both at the --\nQUESTION: Mr. Clement, there was -- you said\nthat the PDA suit, the four documents were required to be\nturned over under that, but I thought the Washington\nSupreme Court said that accident reports from nonofficers,\nfrom witnesses, would not be disclosable under the PDA,\nthough they would be subject to discovery under rule\n26(b), so the notion that the PDA suit was the one that\ndetermined that these four documents were required to be\nturned over, I don't understand that, because I thought\nthere was one part at least, the reports from nonofficers,\nthat the county prevailed on before the Washington Supreme\nCourt, but that it was a Pyrrhic victory because they lost\non that point under 26(b).\nMR. CLEMENT: That's not how I read the\ndecision, Justice Ginsburg. I thought -- I read the\ndecision as the four documents were clearly going to be\ndisclosed as part of the PDA action.\nQUESTION: Did you read the decision to say that\nthese documents are not disclosable under our Freedom of\nInformation Act, nevertheless they can be discovered in a\ncivil litigation?\nMR. CLEMENT: That's not, with respect, how I\nread the opinion. I read the opinion that those four\ndocuments are disclosable under the PDA. The only\nobjection to disclosure under the PDA that was raised by\nthe county was section 409, and with that issue resolved\nagainst the county, I took the import of the decision that\nthose documents would be disclosed.\nAt that point, I think it's clearly a final\ndecision, because this Court has held in the Beckton\nDickinson case in the context of section 1291 that the\nfact that attorney's fees need to be resolved on remand\ndoesn't deprive a decision of finality, and in that\ndecision this Court relied on 1257 decisions, and so I\nwould think that the same rule would apply in both\ncontexts, so I think that the PDA action clearly is final.\nI think the tort action is a more difficult\nquestion as to whether that's final. I think this Court\nmight have to change its -- to modify its precedents a\nbit, but I think it might be a wise course in light of\nwhat Congress has done here. I think this case is quite\nanalogous to a case that this case found final called\nNational Mercantile Bank v. Langdow, and in that case\nthere was a State venue provision that a Federal statute\ntrumped, and the State supreme court found that the --\nthis Court found that the State's decision saying that\nState law trumped the Federal statute was final, and I\nthink the cases are quite parallel.\nThey both involved congressional efforts to\nmodify State procedure in order to serve a Federal\ninterest, and in both cases when the State court\ndisregarded the Federal interest and either through\nconstitutional means or statutory means found the Federal\nstatute inapplicable, this Court found that there was a\nfinal judgment in the Langdow case, and I think by\nextension of that decision, they could find a final\njudgment here.\nI think the main difference between this case\nand Langdow is that in Langdow this Court took the\nposition that upon remand there would be no further\nlitigation available in the State court where the lawsuit\nwas filed.\nHere, there might be some litigation that would\ngo on in the tort action, for example, but I think the\nimportant thing is that the Federal interest has been\nextinguished, and I think if there's any play in the\njoints in this Court's finality decisions, I think that\nthis would be a particularly important case to find a\nfinal decision, because an act of Congress has been held\nunconstitutional.\nQUESTION: Do we need to find finality with\nrespect to both?\nMR. CLEMENT: I don't think so, Your Honor. I\nthink that these actions are severable. They were\nconsolidated for purposes of appeal before the Washington\nSupreme Court, and I think that --\nQUESTION: So if I don't want to wrestle with\nthe complexities of the tort action, what would we do,\njust dismiss that case as improvidently granted and decide\nthe other one?\nMR. CLEMENT: I think that would be fair, or\nthis Court could just sort of ignore the tort case and say\nthat it's going to take jurisdiction over the PDA action\nand decide this Federal statutory issue in the context of\nthe State PDA action, and --\nQUESTION: Well, we can't ignore it. I mean,\nwe've taken the case. We've granted certiorari. We've\ngot to do something with it.\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, I --\nQUESTION: Just hide it under --\nQUESTION: There's only one case --\nMR. CLEMENT: I mean, I think that this Court\ncould say that to the extent that the tort action is\nbefore it, that that action is not final, and that -- or\nthey're not going to -- the Court's not going to\ndefinitively resolve that, and that the PDA action is\nfinal.\nI would -- this Court in a different context\nactually managed to bifurcate a single case and say that\none part of the case was final and the accounting action\nthat was subject to remand was not final. That's the\nW. W. --\nQUESTION: We wouldn't want to do that too\noften, I think.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. CLEMENT: No, no, but I think if you can do\nthat in a single case, I think you can certainly do it in\na case like this, where they started as separate actions,\nwere consolidated only for purposes of appeal, and really\nhave separate life.\nIf, for example, this Court hadn't exercised\njurisdiction, what would have happened is that the two\ncases would have gone back down. The PDA action would\nhave been essentially over, because as the county\nsuggested, there's nothing left in the PDA action on\nremand. The tort action would go on, and once the PDA\naction went back to the trial court, then it would have\nbeen appropriate to appeal that on a separate track from\nthe tort action, and there would have been really no point\nto making the county go through that exercise, and so I\nthink the PDA action is final.\nIf there are no further questions, I think the\nimportant submission from the Government is that the 1995\namendments can be given force in a way that renders them\nstill quite well within the Congress' power under the\nCommerce, Spending, and Necessary and Proper Clauses.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Clement.\nMr. Mungia, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF SALVADOR A. MUNGIA\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. MUNGIA: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe statute does have to be construed, but\nregardless of how the statute's construed, it clearly does\nnot meet this Court's requirements under South Dakota v.\nDole because 409 is not conditional. You read the plain\nlanguage of 409, and it's not conditional in nature. It's\na mandate, and if somehow it could be construed as being\nconditional, it's certainly ambiguous, as we've seen many\ninterpretations and many questions as to the operation of\n409.\n409 cannot be justified under the Commerce\nClause. It does not regulate commercial or economic\nactivity. Instead, it regulates State courts, and that is\nthe peculiar nature of this dispute, because what is at\nissue is, is what does a State -- this is completely an\nintrastate concern.\nQUESTION: Why is it intrastate? If you simply\nhave a -- if you interpret the statute to say, a document\nthat is prepared primarily for this -- for getting money,\nprimarily for getting money out of the Federal Government\ncan't be discoverable in a tort action? What part of the\nConstitution would that violate, if that's how you\ninterpret it?\nYou'd get all your documents, I guess, and so\nwould anyone like you, but that seems to be basically what\nthe Government's arguing --\nMR. MUNGIA: Justice --\nQUESTION: I -- yes.\nMR. MUNGIA: Justice Breyer, I agree with the\nSolicitor General's interpretation of the statute, we\nstill get our documents, and I do want to make it clear\nfor the record, and I think it's clear in the briefs,\nPierce County took a different tack on this and had a very\nwide scope of interpretation. However, despite that fact,\nthere still has to be authority under the Commerce or\nSpending Clause, and I may not get it in this issue if we\nget our documents, that's correct, but I'm saying that no\nmatter what, the act has to have authority under some\narticle I, section (a) basis.\nQUESTION: Well, that's certainly right, and so\nCongress says, we have a Federal interest in trying to\nminimize accidents, and in order to do that, we want to\nget information from the States when they want our money,\nand to be sure the information is accurate, we want to be\nsure that at least the information they give us, they're\ncollecting with an eye towards being accurate rather than\nwith an eye towards protecting themselves from tort\nlitigation.\nMR. MUNGIA: Justice --\nQUESTION: It sounds reasonable to me. What's\nunreasonable about that?\nMR. MUNGIA:\nanalysis starts, is this commercial or interstate activity\nthat in fact the Federal Government is regulating, and\nthey're not, they're regulating State courts. And\nagain --\nQUESTION: But they're regulating in the\ninterest of a commerce-type thing that's preventing\nautomobile accidents.\nMR. MUNGIA: That is the disputable part, as to\nwhether or not there's any evidence in, within -- not only\nin the record, or anywhere that can be found, whether this\naction, indeed, would prevent any further accidents. All\nthe statute does --\nQUESTION: When Congress makes that judgment,\ndon't we owe it substantial deference? That is, we're not\ngoing to sit as a committee of Congress to determine\nwhether there's a link between the condition of these\nintersections and vehicles going in and out of States. If\nCongress made that judgment, it's not for us to question\nit, is it?\nMR. MUNGIA: Justice Ginsburg, that is the\nhistoric and that is the correct analysis. This Court has\nbeen very deferential to Congress', even if there's\nsomething within the information source that could support\nthat reasoning, and again I'll go to U.S. v. Lopez and\nU.S. v. Morrison for that proposition, where in U.S. v.\nLopez, there were no congressional findings at least this\nCourt alluded to.\nThey do not have to make congressional findings,\nas long as there's something out there, some information,\nand the same thing with U.S. v. Morrison. Even when\nCongress did make a congressional finding, this Court said\nwe're not going to necessarily find that in fact they had\na substantial effect on interstate commerce.\nQUESTION: May I ask you just to back up for a\nmoment to address the question that Mr. Clement did about\nthe separateness of these two? Is there anything in the\ntort action that you are seeking that's different from the\nPDA action, or are these essentially two actions seeking\nthe same material?\nMR. MUNGIA: Justice Ginsburg, no. They are\nseeking different materials, and the materials we sought\nin the tort action were much broader than what we sought\nin the Public Disclosure Act, and the materials -- I do\nwant to say this as far as that, there is no judgment in\nthe tort action. I mean, that should be clear. There is\nno final judgment. This is a discovery order that was\ntaken up on interlocutory appeal.\nNow, whether or not there is a final judgment in\nthe PDA action is a closer question, but I would point out\nto the Court, page 114 of the Washington State Supreme\nCourt's opinion that you'll find at Appendix A-114 directs\nthe lower courts to make their rulings in accord with the\ncourt's opinion, and did not simply say these documents\neither are or are not discoverable, and thus it is\ndebatable whether or not there is a final judgment even in\nthe Public Disclosure Act case.\nQUESTION: But the way you interpreted it,\nalthough you say it's debatable, is that everything that\nfalls under the PDA, everything that -- those four\ndocuments, those are not available to you. That's what\nMr. Clement said, I think, that that's what rendered the\nPDA action final.\nMR. MUNGIA: Correct, and I read the opinion\ndifferently, where in fact we do get those documents, and\nI -- we may have a fight back at the trial court as to the\nlanguage of the Washington State Supreme Court, because I\nrealize in its opinion it said that those would normally\nnot be discoverable under the PDA, but then you have to\nlook at the purpose of the documents.\nQUESTION: You set forth four alternative\ninterpretations at page 20 of your brief. Do any of the\ndocuments involved in either of the tort action or the PDA\naction comprise just those set forth in your category 1,\nwhich is reports and data that the State agency actually\nprepares itself?\nMR. MUNGIA: Justice Kennedy, the documents that\nwe sought under the PDA, even under the narrowest\nconstruction, under the narrowest construction, we get the\ndocuments, just on a statutory construction under the PDA\nrequest.\nQUESTION: But some of the documents you\nrequested fit naturally within your category 1?\nMR. MUNGIA: Correct.\nQUESTION: All right.\nMR. MUNGIA: And so at least in this case, this\nCourt need not address the constitutional issues, finding\nno final judgment in the tort action and, in fact, a\nnarrow construction for the PDA action.\nQUESTION: I'm sorry, I'm not sure I understood.\nYou say the documents that you requested fell within\ncategory 1?\nMR. MUNGIA: Of our interpretation, which is a\nvery narrow construction of the statute. That's correct,\nJustice Stevens.\nQUESTION: In other words, they were documents\nthat were actually prepared to get highway funds?\nMR. MUNGIA: No, I'm sorry, if I --\nQUESTION: That's what I understood you to say.\nMR. MUNGIA: Oh, no, I'm sorry. I'm saying we\nwould get those documents under our construction. In\nother words, they do not fall within the parameters of\nthat narrow construction, because these are documents that\nin fact were prepared by another agency.\nQUESTION: So in your view, none of the\ndocuments that you're -- that are in dispute fall within\ncategory 1.\nMR. MUNGIA: Correct, under the PDA action, that\nis correct, not the tort action but the PDA action.\nQUESTION: Do they fall in category 2? Can you\ntell us?\nMR. MUNGIA: No. If they don't fall within\ncategory 1 -- I'm sorry, Justice Kennedy. If they fall\nwithin category 2, yes, they would. Under the PDA action,\nthose documents would fall within --\nQUESTION: Documents the agency has in its\npossession?\nMR. MUNGIA: Correct, they fall within category\n2. And I do want to point out to this Court that, in\nfact, Pierce County's position, and it's shown in the\nrecord, was that we could not even discover the names of\nwitnesses or the names of the people involved in the\naccidents, and that's surely not part of the Federal\nhighway funding data, because why is the Federal\nGovernment concerned with the names of the people involved\nin the accidents, and I think this is a concern about\nputting documents, if you will, in a black hole and\nallowing certain information which our supreme court has\nheld is essential to the proper determination of these\nclaims, based upon State and local law.\nThey are essential to those determinations going\nin, and now no longer being discoverable. I think that is\na very basic concern with this statute, and why at least\none reason it should take a narrow construction, or at the\nvery widest, the construction put forward by the Solicitor\nGeneral.\nQUESTION: But the construction put forward by\nthe Solicitor General, as I understand it, is you can get\nit from the agency, like a law enforcement agency, but not\nfrom the Public Works Department if the purpose is to\nimplement the Federal program. That's the Government's\nposition?\nMR. MUNGIA: Yes, Justice Ginsburg.\nQUESTION: But under that position, I suppose,\nin the day when we have this great data base and all\nreports are there initially, then under the Government's\napproach, everything would be exempt from discovery. Do\nyou read their position to say that?\nMR. MUNGIA: Correct, Justice Ginsburg, I do,\nand that is the day, if it's not today, that this court --\nQUESTION: No, I didn't read it that way. I\nthought what they were saying was consistent with if it --\nand maybe it's in this case. I don't think it is, but I\nmean, if you ever have the great single data base, you'd\nlook to see whether the document was primarily created for\nthe one purpose or the other. Where it's primarily\ncreated for accident reports, you get it. Where it's\nprimarily created to get money from the Government, you\ndon't. I mean, does that work as an interpretation? I'm\nnot sure we have to reach it, but if we did?\nMR. MUNGIA: Justice Breyer, as far as\ninterpreting the electronic portion, it probably is a\nreasonable interpretation, and you're right, I mean, it's\nnot part of this case, but it probably will have to be\nfaced sooner or later.\nGoing back to the scope, again, because we are\ntalking about the interpretation of this, Pierce County\ntook the position they were -- and this is in the\ncompanion Witmer case, which is the one -- there was a\ncompanion case at the State level, where private highway\nsurveys done by, I believe it was the McDonald's and a\nChevron Company, which the county then took within its\npossession, it was unwilling to disclose because under\n409, so again I think the county's position was a very\nbroad one, that anything that goes in within their\npossession then becomes nondiscoverable and you cannot use\nit, which I think is a completely unreasonable\ninterpretation.\nI do want to take a few minutes and talk about\nthe Spending Clause, because this is not a condition. If\nyou read section 409, the plain language of 409, it's\nmandatory, and surely when Congress has intended to use\nits Spending Clause powers, I think especially in the\nFederal highway setting, it's been very clear.\nQUESTION: I don't see how you can characterize\nsection 409 as a condition. It's an incentive provided\nto -- for the State to participate in this Federal funding\nprogram. The Federal Government hopes to get information\nfrom the State, and thinks that they'll be more apt to get\nit by providing the protections of section 409. I don't\nsee it as a condition at all.\nMR. MUNGIA: Justice O'Connor, I agree. I don't\nthink it's a condition either. Whether you want to term\nit as an incentive or something else -- they term it as a\nmandate. I think regardless of how you term it, then it\ncannot be authorized under the Spending Clause.\nQUESTION: But --\nQUESTION: Well, why not? It's a necessary and\nproper means of ensuring that the Federal money is spent\nwisely and efficiently. Now, I don't see the big issue\nthere, frankly.\nMR. MUNGIA: Under the Spending Clause analysis,\nthis Court has long gone through through Pennhurst,\nthrough South Dakota v. Dole, and just recently in Durham\nv. Gorham, it's clear that the conditions have to be\nspelled out.\nNow, this is clearly some sort of imposition,\nand if it's not Spending Clause, then they'd have to have\nit under the Commerce Clause authority, which goes under\nanother analysis.\nQUESTION: You'd have another --\nQUESTION: No State has to participate in this\nprogram if it doesn't want to. If a State wants to turn\ndown Federal money it can, can it not?\nMR. MUNGIA: It can turn down Federal money, and\nthat's the interesting, Mr. Chief Justice, about 409.\nAgain, just reading the plain language of 409, it is\nmandatory, and there's no provision -- even if you cross-\nreference to 152, there's nothing which puts anybody on\nnotice about how this -- how a State can avoid the\nmandates of 409.\nQUESTION: Well, it can avoid --\nQUESTION: But you can agree, nonetheless, that\na State can refuse to participate? You say you can't, by\nreading 409, tell that it isn't just a legislative command\nbased on something other than the Spending Clause, but\ndon't -- you do agree, don't you, that if a State didn't\ntake the Federal money, it would not be bound by 409?\nMR. MUNGIA: Mr. Chief Justice, I think that's\nan open question, and I don't necessarily agree with that.\nI think you have to read the plain language, and it seems\nlike Congress is saying you will do this.\nQUESTION: You think it's just categorical,\nthen?\nMR. MUNGIA: Correct.\nQUESTION: But how could that be if -- how could\nany document be collected for the purpose of participating\nin the Federal program if the State doesn't participate in\nthe Federal program?\nMR. MUNGIA: Because if you read section 152,\nwhat it mandates States to do is come up with a list and a\nsurvey of hazardous sites. That's all it says, in 52(a),\nthat's the mandatory part.\nSo Congress, if it has the authority, can tell\nthe States, do this list. Now, the question, that begs\nthe question whether or not Congress has that authority.\nI think then that's when you have to turn to the\nCommerce --\nQUESTION: Do the list whether or not you have\nany Federal money, is that what you're saying? This is\nnot tied to Federal spending.\nsaying. That it's independent Federal obligation on the\nStates whether or not they receive any Federal money. Is\nthat how you read 152?\nMR. MUNGIA: Justice Ginsburg, that's correct.\nI think if you read the plain language, 152, unlike 23\nU.S.C. 131, 141, 159, 161, where it's clear that Congress\nsays you must control highway billboard signs or you lose\n10 percent of your funding, you must control size and\nweights of vehicles that go on interstate highways or you\nlose 10 percent of your funding. Those are all clear.\nIn fact, in the Dole case, under 23 U.S.C. 158,\nI think that the title of the act was withdrawal of\nFederal funds.\nQUESTION: Aren't we losing sight of the fact,\nthe rather plain fact that the States and the counties\nwanted this? They weren't satisfied with the program\noriginally because they feared these documents would be\ndiscoverable, and make the county liable. Do you have\nanother Spending Clause case where the States and the\ncounties came to Congress and said, please give us a\nprivilege, and then say, well, now it's mandatory and it's\nsome kind of a club rather than a carrot?\nMR. MUNGIA: Justice Ginsburg, I have two\nresponses. One, I think actually this Court addressed\nthat same sort of analysis in New York v. U.S., where the\nSolicitor General argued that because New York officials\nwanted the benefits of the Low-Level Hazardous Waste Act,\ntherefore it cannot later challenge certain provisions of\nthat act, and this Court rejected that argument.\nQUESTION: But this very provision they wanted,\nnot the thing in general.\nMR. MUNGIA: And that goes -- then to my second\npart of my response is, and I think it's a fundamental\npart of the constitutional analysis, because here, if the\nStates wanted this protection they had the means to do it\nthemselves, and this Court has explained, again citing\nfrom New York v. U.S., State sovereignty isn't for the\nbenefit of the States, it's for the benefit of the\ncitizens to derive the benefits of liberty from the\ndivision of separate powers, so it really, just because\nState officials want it, it's clearly that the people of\nthe State of Washington did not want this, because it\ninfringed upon a State cause of action. In fact, so much\nso that the State supreme court was willing to hold it was\nunconstitutional.\nQUESTION: Well, that goes to the waiver point.\nI assume the State can waive it if its citizens instruct\nit to do so, or maybe not. The Government says no.\nMR. MUNGIA: I -- Justice Kennedy, you look at\nthe language, and in fact you look at the early responses\nby Pierce County, where Pierce County clearly said, we\ncannot -- I mean, we must -- we don't have that choice.\nWe cannot --\nQUESTION: The hypothetical is that the State\ncould waive it if it wanted to. That's the --\nMR. MUNGIA: And Justice Kennedy --\nQUESTION: -- hypothetical question.\nMR. MUNGIA: Yes, and I -- Justice Kennedy, my\nresponse is, I don't see how the State could, because I\nthink just for the very reasons, as was pointed out by the\nSolicitor General, where do you cross that line between, I\nguess, a single waiver, and then it becoming endemic. I\nthink that's the whole problem here.\nUnder the recent cases under the Commerce\nClause, and again I just want to spend a couple of minutes\non the U.S. v. Lopez and Morrison cases, it seems clear\nthat again this type of activity, what's being regulated\nis, in fact, State courts, in fact, the admissibility, the\ndiscovery of evidence, and that is certainly intrastate,\nand there's no contention here that somehow justice, or\nthe discovery of documents is somehow commercial in\nnature, and you cannot make that argument, so I think\nthere is no basis under either the Spending or the\nCommerce Clause to support this legislation.\nQUESTION:\nargument that the object of the Federal legislation is\nsafety in an artery of commerce? Is that beside the\npoint?\nMR. MUNGIA: Justice Souter, the object at least\nfor the Federal Highway Act is safety. I don't think the\nsame thing can be said about 409, because then you're\nbecoming -- as this Court said in U.S. v. Lopez, you're\nbuilding inference upon inference, because you have to go\nand say, if these documents are no longer, in fact,\ndiscoverable, would it result in safer interstate travel,\nand there's just too many intermediate steps.\nQUESTION: So you that think the Federal\ninterest in this case is comparable to the Federal\ninterest in Lopez, the ultimate interest?\nMR. MUNGIA: I think that the -- Justice Souter,\nthe Federal interest in section 409 --\nQUESTION: No, I'm talking about the ultimate\nFederal interest that gives rise to all of this\nregulation, which is the safety of an artery of commerce.\nAre you either disputing that that is the object, or are\nyou saying that that object is on par for constitutional\npurposes with the significance of the Government's object\nin Lopez?\nMR. MUNGIA: Justice Souter, I think it's more\nthe latter.\ncertainly has an interest in the safe passage of\ninterstate --\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Mungia.\nMr. Hamilton, you have 3 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DANIEL R. HAMILTON\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. HAMILTON: Thank you, Your Honor.\nVery quickly -- 3 minutes, quickly -- I would\nlike to correct I think what was a misstatement by\nrespondent's counsel, or at least one of them, dealing\nwith what the Court should do if it adopts the United\nStates' position. Plaintiffs say that if you adopt that\nposition, then they get the documents.\nI'll point out that on page 24 of their own\nrespondents' brief they say their -- interpretation\nnumber 2, which they say the U.S. reflects, they say on\npage 24, if the Court construes the statute in this\nfashion, then a remand would be necessary to determine\nwhich specific discovery requests would be precluded and\nwhich would be, still be allowed. They're not entitled,\neven under their own admission, under the U.S. position,\nand in fact I would point out on page 20 of our reply,\nyellow brief, where we point out that in fact, if that\nwere the case, even if the U.S. position were adopted,\nthese particular documents would have to be protected.\nFurthermore, obviously there is some confusion\nas to where we differ with the United States, and it's a\nvery narrow difference. We both agree that generated\ndocuments are protected. We both agree that collected and\ncompiled documents in the hands of Public Works are\nprotected, and we both agree that in some situations\nthey're protected in the hands of third parties.\nThey, though, very narrowly define that in\nsituations where the third party gets it, is a transferee\nagency, where you can only get it by indexing, or where\nit's part of a computer base.\nI would ask the Court to consider its own\nSt. Regis Paper Company case, where it addressed a statute\nthat only made a protection when it was in the hands of\nthird parties or officials, and it contrasted the language\nof that statute with other statutes, 45 U.S.C. section 41,\nand 49-320, whose wording is almost identical to 409. If\nyou would compare those, you would see that the case\ndistinguished those types of statutes from a statute only\nprotecting in the hands of third parties.\nSo whatever 409 does, it certainly protects more\nthan just in the hands of third parties, and I would also\nlike to point out, the reason why we differ from the U.S.,\nwe believe their logic is correct with protecting in the\ntransferee hands and in a computer data base and where\nit's indexed, but if you carry that logic through, we\nbelieve a bright line rule should be established by this\nCourt, because obviously the State courts have been\nvery -- some State courts, a minority of State courts have\nbeen very resistant.\nOther State courts have been trying to do their\nbest to comply with the language of the statute, but some\nStates, of course, have found every opportunity to try to\nmisinterpret the statute, and it required Congress at\nleast twice to amend the statute to get back to what they\nintended.\nWhen you look at the situation of why they\nwanted, the Solicitor General believed that documents in\nthe hands of the transferee agency are protected, they\nsaid that the reason for that was that they would not\nexist but for the planning agency's collection of that\ninformation. Well, so, too, accident reports would not\nexist in their totally different form, they would not be\nindexed and therefore accessible, and they would not be in\nthe county's possession but for the Highway Safety Act, so\nyou extend that logic through, then you come to a bright\nline rule which we believe the Court should adopt.\nThank you, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr.\n"
