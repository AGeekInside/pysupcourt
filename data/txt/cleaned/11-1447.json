St. Johns River Water Management District.\nMr. Beard?\nORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL J. BEARD, II,\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. BEARD: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nThis case is about the extent to which\nNollan and Dolan review should be made available to\nindividuals to challenge excessive exactions imposed as\nconditions to land use approval.\nHere, before he could make small use of his\nproperty, Coy Koontz was told by the district that he\nhad to finance enhancements to 50 acres of publicly\nheld --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Let's back up. When he\nasked for a permit, he voluntarily said, I -- as\nmitigation for the loss of wetlands, I am going to\nvoluntarily create a conservation easement on the rest\nof my property. So he recognized, from day one, that\nthere had to be some mitigation for what he was seeking\nto do in the permit. Is that right?\nMR. BEARD: That is correct. With his\napplication, Justice Ginsburg, he did offer a mitigation\nin the form of a conservation easement on most of his\nproperty.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And if he had offered\nnothing, and he just said, I want this permit to develop\nmy land, and the agency said, you have offered no\nmitigation, we deny your permit, would he have a claim?\nMR. BEARD: If there was no condition\nattached to the permit denial, then there would be no\nclaim; although it would be up to the district, under\nNollan and Dolan, to make the individualized\ndetermination, both of the amount of impact to wetlands\nand the amount necessary to offset.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Suppose he just put in\nthe application, no mitigating -- no mitigation of any\nkind, and the agency says no. You recognize that he\nwould have no claim, right? That he had an obligation\nto mitigate.\nMR. BEARD: It depends, Your Honor. If the\ndenial was based on the idea that he was obligated to\noffer mitigation and that was the extent of the\ndistrict's communication with him -- in other words,\nthat the district told him, you must offer us something,\nwe won't tell you what, and we'll let you decide what\nyou want to offer in mitigation -- if that was in the\nrecord and that was the -- and the result of that was a\npermit denial because Mr. Koontz said, for example,\nwell, gee whiz, I don't know how much I need to mitigate\nfor, you haven't told me, I still believe there would be\na Dolan violation because, in Dolan, the Court made\nclear, there has to be an individualized\ndetermination --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: For what? For what? You\nwouldn't -- you wouldn't know what property was taken.\nMR. BEARD: He wouldn't know where --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You are -- you are posing a\nsituation in which he never came forward with any\nsuggestion. They never came forward with any\nsuggestion. You say he still has a cause of action for\na taking?\nMR. BEARD: Not for --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: A taking of what?\nMR. BEARD: Not for a taking, Your Honor,\nbut he -- he may have a cause of action, under Nollan\nand Dolan, for the imposition of an unconstitutional\ncondition that may not -- the contours of which may not\nbe known. But the fact that the district told him, you\nneed to --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I think the other side says\nthat you may have such a cause of action here.\nMR. BEARD: Excuse me. I didn't understand?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Wouldn't -- wouldn't the\nother side in this case acknowledge that you have such a\ncause -- that you may have such a cause of action here?\nMR. BEARD: Yes, Your Honor. I believe\nthey -- well, their argument --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But they are just saying\nyou don't have a cause of action for a taking.\nMR. BEARD: That is correct. They -- they\nare saying that we don't have a cause of action for a\ntaking. Of course, in Nollan and Dolan, there was no\ntransfer of property from the applicant to the relevant\nagencies.\nAs this Court will recall, in both Nollan\nand Dolan, there was an imposition of an exaction, and\nimmediately, the applicant in both cases sued to prevent\nthe unlawful exaction from being consummated.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, I've had a\nproblem with your argument, okay? From the record, it's\nvery clear that a conservation offer is not considered\nmitigation because there's still a net loss of wetlands.\nThe policy is abundantly clear, stated, and undisputed.\nOkay?\nSo, given that policy, why are we even in\nthis case? Meaning whether there was an exaction or no\nexaction or whatever happened in terms of the denial,\nyou couldn't win on your offer because the policy of the\nState was clear and, in my mind, unassailable: We have\nto preserve wetlands. Conservation of other wetlands is\nnot enough. Mitigation means make sure that we get a\nnet gain of wetlands.\nSo why are we here?\nMR. BEARD: Justice Sotomayor, we don't\ncontest the legitimacy of the policy, of course, in\npreserving wetlands; nor do we contest, for that matter,\nthe ratios that the district has imposed via its\nregulations.\nIt is undisputed -- the trial court found\nbelow, the Court of Appeals affirmed, and the finding\nwas undisturbed in the Florida Supreme Court, that, in\nfact, the offsite mitigation -- that part of the\nmitigation that went beyond the conservation easement\nwas in excess, it violated Nollan and Dolan.\nSo the underlying factual findings are not\nin dispute.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I think you -- I think\nyou have a problem then, Mr. Beard, because, if you look\nat the record, the record is very clear that it was\nnot -- that the district didn't come back and say, take\nit or leave it, you -- you improve our wetlands, or you\nget no permit.\nThere was -- and if you -- they are set out\nin the Respondent's brief at pages 13 to 15, oh, at\nleast half a dozen, maybe more, that the -- the district\nsaid, here are several ways -- several ways that you\ncould sufficiently offset the adverse impact. And some\nof them had nothing to do with improving the\ngovernment's own land.\nSo if we can't -- we really can't say this\nwas a take it or leave it, either you do the\nimprovement that we are asking you to do, or you get no\npermit, what do you do with the fact that, as the\nappendix certainly bears out, that the district offered\na range, it offered many, many ways that this permit\nmight be granted. And then it says, then you are free\nto come up with some other -- something else.\nMR. BEARD: Justice Ginsburg, it's true that\nthere were negotiations and that a range of offers were\nmade. On Mr. Koontz's application to use 3.7 acres of\nhis property in conjunction with the conservation\neasement, the district made a final decision denying him\nhis permit because he would not go beyond the easement\nand offer offsite mitigation.\nAnd that is --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Not -- not -- because he\nwouldn't go beyond what he was offering, but that's --\nsome of these options -- one was that he -- that he\nadjust the size of his project, that he make it smaller.\nThe -- the staff suggested eliminating -- no, that --\nthat's a different one.\nBut there was one that suggested that he --\nhe reduce the scale, the Petitioner reduce the scale of\nhis project to one acre and preserve the rest for the\nconservation easement. Now, if that -- if he took that,\nwould you have any -- any case here?\nMR. BEARD: I'm sorry, Justice Ginsburg? If\nwe took --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: If they said, we will\ngive you -- we will give you a permit if you reduce the\nscale of your project to one acre, and then preserve the\nrest by a conservation easement?\nMR. BEARD: Unlikely not, Your Honor,\nbecause the trial court did conclude, based on the\nevidence, that he was having minimal impact on any\nviable wetlands. And so even a reduction in the size of\nthe project, with an increase in the amount of\nmitigation, would have a fortiori gone beyond even what\nwe have in this case.\nThe court of appeals made clear, as a matter\nof law, that Mr. Koontz did -- was entitled to a\ndetermination on the application he submitted. He\nsubmitted that application. And, as the district\nadmitted in a pretrial statement right before trial, the\ndenials were based exclusively -- and this is a quote --\n\"The denials were based exclusively on the fact that the\nplaintiff would not provide additional mitigation to\noffset impacts from the proposed project.\"\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Beard, can I go back to\nJustice Ginsburg's first question and make sure I\nunderstand your answer to it?\nSuppose that the State just had a policy\nthat said, We're concerned about wetlands; in order to\ndevelop your piece of property, you have to come forward\nwith a proposal -- a mitigation proposal and an adequate\nmitigation proposal. And then it gives some guidance\nabout what an adequate mitigation proposal would mean,\nbut it really leaves it up to the landowner.\nAnd the landowner says, sorry, I'm not\ngiving you anything, I think I should be able to develop\nthis on my own without providing any mitigation. Is\nthat -- and -- and the State says, well, then, sorry,\nyou don't get a permit.\nIs that a taking? Does the man have a\ntakings claim? I heard you answer the question yes.\nMR. BEARD: My answer was that he may have a\nNollan/Dolan claim. I don't want to get confused about\nthe term \"taking\" because \"taking\" could imply many\nkinds of regulatory takings claims.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Well, I -- that's the next\nquestion I was going to ask you because my understanding\nof Nollan and Dolan was that it assumed the condition,\nif taken alone, would constitute a taking.\nDo you disagree with that?\nMR. BEARD: I do not disagree with that,\nYour Honor.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Okay. So then you need a\ntaking someplace in the picture; isn't that right?\nNollan/Dolan says this is how we analyze takings in the\ncontext of a permit scheme. So we have to look for a\ntaking. So, in my example, where is the taking?\nThis was Justice Ginsburg's example. Where\nis the taking?\nMR. BEARD: Right. And I think that's\ncorrect, that, under Nollan and Dolan, you would have to\nhave a condition that was imposed on you.\nMy only point was would it be lawful --\nor there be a problem in the district shifting its\nburden on to the applicant and saying, we're not going\nto establish what mitigation is required, and we're not\ngoing to establish what the impacts are, we'll leave\nthat up to you, you give us what you think is -- is\nnecessary.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose the district\ndid -- did have, as I think it did here, a uniform\npolicy that, for every acre you develop, you have to\npreserve 10 wetlands -- 10 acres of wetlands.\nAnd then two cases, both hypothetical, one\nis somebody had an 100-acre parcel, and they want to\ndevelop five acres, and they have 50 acres that they\nmitigate for wetlands. The other person has only one\nacre, and he wants to -- and he has to develop the whole\nacre.\nCan the district then say, we'll give you\nthe one-acre development permit, if you reclaim wetlands\non 10 other acres that you -- that we can designate for\nyou elsewhere? The hypothetical being designed to point\nout whether or not the crux of your argument is that he\nhad to go off -- offsite.\nMR. BEARD: The crux is not that he had to\ngo offsite, but that -- that did play into the trial\ncourt's analysis as to the connection between his impact\nand what was being required, and there was testimony\nbelow that there was no connection there. And the fact\nthat the mitigation was four to seven miles away played\ninto the analysis as to whether there was a connection.\nIt's not --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So, in my hypothetical,\nyou would -- would there be a violation in my\nhypothetical, as you understood it?\nMR. BEARD: It depends, Your Honor, because\nyou have to determine what -- in each respective\nhypothetical, what the impact was actually to the\nwetlands and then determine what the appropriate\nmitigation --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How do you normally\ndecide whether the agency has done that right or not?\nMR. BEARD: Excuse me?\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How do you normally\ndecide? Let's assume Justice Kagan's question -- or\nJustice Ginsburg's question. No -- it just says, come\nto us with a mitigation plan. And you say, this is what\nI offer, and it's enough. And they say, no, it's not\nenough; denied.\nWould you go through the State\nadministrative process, to figure out whether that was\narbitrary and capricious, whether it was a Penn Central\nviolation? What would you do with that claim in the\nnormal circumstance? Justice Kennedy's question.\nMR. BEARD: In the normal circumstance, if\nthere was no condition imposed, there would not be a\nNollan and Dolan claim. There may be another kind of\nclaim, say, under Penn Central, and that could be\nbrought. That wouldn't have to be brought via\nadministrative remedies, if there was a final agency\naction --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It would be an inverse\ncondemnation.\nMR. BEARD: Correct. It could be an inverse\ncondemnation type of a claim.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So -- so what I think might\nbe driving some of these questions is the district court\nsays -- just as you say, had Koontz offered additional\nmitigation -- the additional that would have cost\n$10,000, he would have gotten the permit. That's what\nhe said.\nSo then you look back to see what additional\nmitigation. And, here, we have in the record, at least\nthat my law clerk finds -- you know, that -- that they\nwent to Koontz and they said, here are some choices:\nInstall a subsurface stormwater management system in the\ndevelopment -- I mean, right on your land -- or reduce\nthe size to one acre; or eliminate the filling of the\nslide slope areas; or replace 15 culverts and eliminate\na ditch system somewhere else; or enhance 50 acres\nsomewhere else.\nNow, at that point, when -- and then they\nsaid, won't you negotiate for 30 more days, maybe we can\nfind some other things? He says, no, I'll bring a\nlawsuit. Okay.\nNow, I absolutely can see a Penn Central\nclaim there. But the land -- what you're talking about\nis not some land somewhere off the site. We're talking\nabout his land. If, after all, they said you have to\nleave all the coal in the mine to hold up the ceiling --\nyou know what I'm referring to -- then they go too far.\nAnd, here, if we look at all these\nconditions proposed and said -- you know, this is just\nterrible, they don't do it for anybody else, your\nclient's the only one, it bears no relation, oh, it just\ngoes too far, you win under Penn Central.\nSo I can see the framework here. I'm not\nsaying you're going to win, but I got it clear what the\nframework is. But suddenly you bring this Nollan/Dolan\nbusiness into it, and I get confused. And the reason is\nbecause there was a different piece of land in Nollan\nand Dolan.\nThe piece of land that was different was an\neasement in front of -- and an easement is a piece of\nproperty in Nollan, and there was a bike path in Dolan,\nright across his property.\nSo -- so I don't see how Nollan and Dolan\nhave to do with this. I see everything that Penn\nCentral has to do with it, and that grows out of the\nnature of what was being offered. You are saying what\nthey are offering you is simply going too far. Okay.\nI've got that conceptually.\nI ask this question because all these briefs\nare about Nollan and Dolan, and I don't understand what\nthey have to do with it. I must be missing something,\nand that's why I am asking you.\nMR. BEARD: Justice Breyer --\nJustice Breyer, Nollan and Dolan, fundamentally, are\nabout whether a property owner has been singled out to\nbear public burdens that, in fairness and --\nJUSTICE BREYER: But, of course, they are\nland claims because they took a piece of land, which\neverybody assumes -- right in front of his house -- and\nsaid, you've got to let everybody from the beaches walk\nback and forth from one beach in the north to another\none in the south, and they are going to walk over your\nland.\nAnd the Court said, you can't take his land\nunless you have a nexus to some public purpose that is\nrelated to his building the house. I got it. I just\ndon't see what it has to do with this case.\nMR. BEARD: Because you -- you can have an\nunconstitutional condition imposed on your right to do\nsomething, in this case, make use of your property. And\nthe --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Of course, you can. In\nfact, there is too much coal. That's an\nunconstitutional condition. It goes too far, and there\nis a framework called Penn Central, which deals with it.\nMR. BEARD: Penn Central is a special\ntakings case that goes to the question of whether a\nregulation of the use of property that is sought to be\ndeveloped has gone too far so as to affect the taking.\nPenn Central is not --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Which -- how does that\nnot address going too far? You just said it. If -- if\nthis is unrelated to the -- the denial of your permit of\nall uses of your land, and you're saying that's the\nproblem, which is I still have a use, I just want more,\nwhy does that entitle you to your lost profits?\nWhen were you ever entitled to start with\nthe claim that, somehow, you're entitled to a permit, as\na matter of law?\nMR. BEARD: We're entitled, under the\nUnconstitutional Conditions Doctrine, to not have to\nbear a public burden that has no bearing on the impact\nthat we're trying to use on our property.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, that's fine. That --\nthat would enable you to challenge the denial of the\npermit, saying it's based upon an unconstitutional\ncondition. But how does it -- how does it enable you to\nsay there's been a taking? What has been taken?\nMR. BEARD: What has been -- what has been\ntaken, in effect, is his funds that have to be put now\nto a public use, the enhancement of 50 acres of public\nwetlands. And there is nothing in the Takings Clause --\nnothing --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It hasn't -- it hasn't been\ntaken. I mean, he turned it down.\nMR. BEARD: Nothing was taken in Nollan and\nDolan, either. What was proposed there, though, was a\nthreat of a taking.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The -- the permit was\ngranted in Nollan and Dolan. And -- and the condition\nattached to the permit, therefore, took effect; namely,\nthat you had to dedicate this easement over your -- over\nyour beach, whereas, as my colleague pointed out,\nanybody could walk back and forth, barefooted.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. BEARD: Justice Scalia, in Nollan and\nDolan, there was approval -- approval with conditions.\nThere were no permits issued, and that's -- that is an\nimportant distinction to make, that most agencies,\nincluding this one, you approve a permit with a -- with\nconditions, which means, we will give you your permits\nas soon as you comply; which is substantively the same\nas saying, we won't give you your permits until you say\nyes to our conditions.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. Look, we have\nthe same question. I just want an answer to my\nquestion. And, for the purposes of this question, I am\nassuming enormously in your favor. I am assuming that\nthis set of conditions is the worst thing since sliced\nbread.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. I\nthink there -- all right. I'm assuming that in your\nfavor. All right.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Sliced bread's supposed to\nbe good.\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, no. It's been proved\nbad.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: The -- the -- but -- but in\nany case, the -- the point is, you see, I assume that in\nyour favor. I'm trying to figure out the conceptual\nframework. I assume that in your favor. I assume\nwhether they didn't issue the permit and would have, but\nthey haven't quite, or maybe they have -- it means\nnothing.\nNow, having assumed that, it seems to me\nwhat your argument is, is that this is a form of\nregulatory taking of the kind that Holmes was talking\nabout. And that -- that's what was going on in -- in\nPenn Central, and so we simply look to see if it went\ntoo far or whatever. The lower courts could do that. I\ngot that part.\nNow, I want you to answer the question,\nwhich is, am I right? Is there another part -- a\ndifferent part to this case, called the Nollan/Dolan\npart and explain that to me. That's why I asked the\nquestion. I want to hear what you're going to say.\nMR. BEARD: Justice Breyer, there is another\npart, a very distinct part, and that part goes to the\nquestion of the condition that produced the denial. So\nthere are -- there are actually two parts here. There's\nthe -- the conditioning of your permit; in other words,\nwe will not issue you permits unless you agree to\nperform offsite mitigation.\nNow, the question, under Nollan and Dolan,\nis was that condition constitutional? Was he asked to\ngive up something that the State -- or the district, in\nthis case, should not have asked him to give up in\nexchange for his right to use his property?\nNow, it's true as -- as, Justice Breyer, you\nmentioned, that the permit denial and whether that\naffects a regulatory taking of his land, of the thing he\nwants to use, that's an entirely different question.\nAnd it may raise another kind of claim -- another kind\nof taking claim.\nBut the crux of the claim that was litigated\nin this case, from the trial court all the way up to the\nFlorida Supreme Court, is was the condition to perform\noffsite mitigation -- and that was accepted as true by\nthe courts below, that this was a condition that had\nbeen --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Suppose the record just\ndoesn't bear that out; the record shows that it wasn't\none option. They gave him a laundry list of things he\ncould do, some -- some of them having nothing whatever\nto do -- anything off his own property.\nSuppose the -- whatever the district court\nmight have said, the record shows that the agency said,\nyou're right, seven things you could do, come up with\nhere are six, if you have something else. And some of\nthem have absolutely nothing to do with other\nproperties.\nMR. BEARD: We agree that there were\nnegotiations and that, even in the order, it's alleged\nthat various options were provided to Mr. Koontz, but,\nultimately, the decision -- as the district admits, the\ndecision -- the final decision to deny the permit\napplication for 3.7 acres of use was Mr. Koontz's\nrefusal to acquiesce in the condition that he perform\n50 acres of offsite improvements.\nAnd, by the way, the reference --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Where -- where is that?\nMR. BEARD: It's in the Joint Appendix,\npages 70 to 71, which is the pretrial statement where\neach party sets forth his and her position. There, the\ncourt -- I'm sorry -- the district made clear that the\ncondition that had been refused and was the cause of the\npermit denial was the one to perform offsite mitigation\nat a cost of a range between $10,000 on the low end.\nOur experts said in the range of 100 to 150,000 -- 90 to\n150,000.\nSo the district, later on -- even in the\nFlorida Supreme Court, Justice Ginsburg, said, in its\nPetitioner's brief on jurisdiction, at page 1, that it\nrequired additional mitigation before it would authorize\nthe permits and that, quote, \"Additional mitigation\nwould be offsite because the available conservation land\nonsite was, in the district's view, insufficient\nmitigation.\"\nSo there's no question that an actual\ncondition was imposed, whose rejection produced a permit\ndenial.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. -- Mr. Beard, I don't\nthink anybody is contesting that there was a condition\nimposed or maybe there are. But -- you know, there's\nanother question whether that condition is a taking. And\nwe've been trying to figure out what's the taking here.\nIn Nollan and Dolan, they took an easement, they took a\npiece of land, so that's the taking. Now, you said the\nfunds are the taking; is that correct?\nAny time that somebody comes up with a\nproposal for -- for a developer to pay money, in order\nto compensate the State for the costs that are\nassociated with his development, that that is, itself, a\ntaking?\nMR. BEARD: I want to be clear that we're\nnot saying that all monetary fees or exactions would be\nsubject to Nollan and Dolan, only within the permit\ncontext -- the special context of land use permitting is\nit --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: No, I understand. But, in\nthe permit context, a State can't say to somebody, you\nhave to pay to perform some service or to compensate\nwithout it being a taking and without it being subject\nto Nollan and Dolan analysis.\nMR. BEARD: Correct. If the State or if the\ngovernment or the permitting authority asks for the --\nfor the property owner to give up property, even money\nto be put to a public use, and it's not an application\nfor your user fee or something like that, it's for\nmitigation, that should be subject --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: So -- so, for example -- and\nI'll try to do this very quickly, if -- if the State\njust had a policy for every acre of wetlands you fill\nin, it costs us $10,000, you need to pay $10,000, that's\nsubject to Nollan and Dolan analysis, too.\nMR. BEARD: Correct. It would be subject to\nNollan and Dolan analysis, to determine if there really,\non the ground, there's a connection between the\nimpact --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No, it -- it would be\nsubject to Nollan and Dolan analysis if they took the\n$10,000. If they issued the permit, the developer went\nahead with the development, and the State then attached\nthe -- the bank account in the amount of $10,000 or\nwhatever, that would be Nollan -- in Nollan and Dolan --\nin Nollan, there was a taking.\nHe had gone ahead with the -- with the\ndevelopment of his house under the permit, which said,\nif he did that, he gave away the easement. So there --\nthere was a -- a taking there. The -- the easement\nwould have been taken automatically.\nIn -- in -- in Dolan, there was -- the\nindividual had not gone ahead with the development, but\nit was clear that any development the person undertook\nwould be subject to the -- the exaction that the\nmunicipality required. So there was a -- a taking\nthere, we said.\nHere, there's nothing that happens. The\npermit was denied, unlike in -- unlike in -- in Dolan,\nwhere the permit was granted, and it was understood\nthat, if she went ahead with it, she was going to\nlose -- lose some land rights. Here, the permit's been\ndenied. I can't see where there's a taking here.\nNothing's been taken.\nMR. BEARD: In Nollan and Dolan, Your Honor,\nnothing was taken, either. In Nollan, you had a permit\napproval with conditions. It's true that development\nhad not gone forward, but, here, as well, development\nhad not gone forward.\nPresumably -- theoretically, if the\ndevelopment had gone forward, he might have been subject\nto conditions that he would have had to satisfy. But I\nwould submit to the Court --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The permit had issued. The\npermit had issued in both of those cases, and,\ntherefore, the person was saying, to go ahead with this\npermit, I give up -- I give up this land.\nMR. BEARD: The permits in Nollan and Dolan\nactually did not issue. There was only approval, with\nconditions, and there is a difference. And that is no\ndifferent from what happened here. The threat is the\nsame. You don't get a permit issued to you until you --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: There was no approval with\nconditions. There's one thing for -- for a municipality\nto issue an -- an approval with conditions, and a\nmunicipality saying, we can't approval it unless you\nagree to these conditions. And the person doesn't\nagree, and the municipality says, we don't approve it.\nMR. BEARD: But, in either case, he -- he\nfaces the threat, the unconstitutional condition on his\nuse of his property, you don't get your use until you\ncomply with our conditions.\nMr. Chief Justice --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I -- I have one question.\nI know we -- you are running short on your rebuttal\ntime.\nAssume that, when we look at this record,\nassume we think there is a due process violation, not a\ntaking violation. That is not before us here, is it?\nMR. BEARD: No. The due -- there is no due\nprocess claim here. There is only a State statute that\nembodies sort of a due process standard, but there is no\ndue process claim here.\nAnd may I reserve the balance of my time,\nYour Honor?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And I will afford\nyou some additional time, since our questioning intruded\non yours.\nMR. BEARD: Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Wolfson?\nORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL R.Q. WOLFSON\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. WOLFSON: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe parties agree that Florida may require a\nlandowner to perform mitigation as a condition for a\npermit that would allow the destruction of a wetlands.\nThe parties disagreed as to how much mitigation was\nappropriate in this case.\nThe district thought that Mr. Koontz's\nproposal was insufficient to mitigate the -- the damage\nto wetlands. Mr. Koontz rejected the district's\ncounterproposals, and he refused to do anything more.\nAnd the district denied his permit application because\nhe refused to do anything more.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Does it make any\ndifference, in his refusing to do anything more, whether\nthe condition is onsite or offsite?\nMR. WOLFSON: I don't think it makes any\ndifference, Mr. Chief Justice, I mean, the -- under the\nFlorida regulatory regime, we cannot demand certain\nconditions from the landowner.\nThe -- we are obligated -- if the -- if the\npermit -- the landowner has to establish, under his\npermit application -- and it's his burden -- that he\nmeets the various standards -- the public interest\nstandard, which includes no adverse impact --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Those are all\nState -- State law provisions you are talking about.\nMR. WOLFSON: Correct. Correct.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What about is\nthere -- is there anything in the Federal Constitution\nthat limits the conditions that you can demand?\nMR. WOLFSON: I don't -- not -- not -- if I\nunderstand your question, Mr. Chief Justice, I don't\nthink so.\nI think that the question is -- when you are\ntalking about what analytical rubric you should apply,\nwhether it be Nollan or Dolan or Penn Central, I think\nyou can always argue that the impact of any of the\nconditions that we would demand -- and I will assume\nhere that they are true demands -- you can always argue\nthat the impact of the conditions, be they onsite,\noffsite, or monetary, would be so burdensome that it\nwould call into play Penn Central or --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But that's -- but\nthere is no -- there is no restraint on the agency. It\ncan ask for the moon -- before it will give a permit?\nMR. WOLFSON: Well, I don't -- I think that\nPenn -- first of all, I think there are many restraints\non the agency. First of all, I think Penn Central\nimposes a restraint on the agency.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you know of any\ncase where the government has lost a Penn Central case?\nMR. WOLFSON: In -- yes. There are several\nin this case, Mr. Chief Justice. I mean, Hodel v.\nIrving is a Penn Central case, I believe, and I think\nKaiser-Aetna was also a Penn Central case.\nNow, they -- now, they -- so --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Let me present --\nI'm sorry.\nMR. WOLFSON: So it does -- it certainly\ndoes -- and they --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It doesn't happen\nvery often.\nMR. WOLFSON: Well, it is -- certainly, the\nburden is on the landowner, but -- but I think that Penn\nCentral -- I think that, in Lingle, when this Court tried to\nsort of restore -- you know, some -- some coherence to\nthe -- to the takings jurisprudence and repudiated the\nAgins point, the Court pointed out that -- that the --\nwhat -- that the normal -- sort of the normal\njurisprudence is that the government is not required to\nestablish, by a heightened scrutiny, sort of that there\nis a connection between means-ends analysis, when it\nengages in economic -- economic regulation.\nAnd that --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Just -- just to nail\nit down, your -- your position is that there is no limit\nin the Federal Constitution on what the agency can\ndemand as a condition for the issuance of a permit?\nMR. WOLFSON: No, no, no. I don't think\nthat is our position. First of all, the Due Process\nClause may certainly impose conditions. The Equal\nProtection Clause may certainly impose conditions.\nAnd --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But -- but the\nTakings -- the Takings Clause does not.\nMR. WOLFSON: If -- if the conditions are so\nonerous that it would make it essentially impossible to\nderive any value from the land, that may very well call\ninto question Penn Central or Lucas. I mean, in many\nways, this case could have been litigated as a very\nstraightforward Penn Central case.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose -- suppose the\nagency said, we are really short of revenue; we will let\nyou develop your land, if you contribute a million\ndollars to our new football stadium?\nMR. WOLFSON: Justice Kennedy, I think that\nthat might very well raise a Penn Central or Lucas claim.\nIt also sounds like --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it doesn't raise Penn\nCentral. You keep on running away from it by saying\nPenn Central or Lucas.\nMR. WOLFSON: Well, it's not --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It does not deprive the\nland of all value. The land still has some value. Penn\nCentral is totally out of the case.\nMR. WOLFSON: Well -- I mean -- it's not --\nit's not a Nollan or Dolan claim is my point,\nJustice Kennedy.\nAnd it's not a Nollan or Dolan claim because\nit's not a -- the -- the -- as -- as my friend\nacknowledged, the question in Nollan and Dolan -- or the\nrationale of Nollan and Dolan is would the condition, by\nitself, if demanded unilaterally and outside the\npermitting context, would -- would that have been a\ntaking of property for which just compensation would\nhave been required?\nSo the --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Sure it would have\nbeen -- sure it would have been, if they just went\nalong -- to a landowner, and the landowner is there,\nminding his own business, and they say, well, you own\nsome property, so give us a 1 million dollars to build a\nfootball stadium.\nThat would be -- that would be\nunconstitutional, right?\nMR. WOLFSON: I think -- I think that\nwould -- I mean, I think that would violate -- could\nwell violate the Due Process Clause. It's hard to\nsee what the -- you know, what the rationality of it is.\nBut I don't think that this Court has\never -- has ever extended the concept of a taking to\nrequirements that a landowner -- that anybody -- or a\nlandowner, either pay money or, more importantly,\nbecause I think what really is this case, is come into\ncompliance with a regulatory requirement that would\nhave -- that -- which he would have to expend money to\ncomply with.\nAnd that --\nJUSTICE ALITO: I'm trying to understand\nwhat would be -- what would be left of Nollan and Dolan,\nif we agree with you.\nLet me give you three situations. First,\nthe petition -- the district says, we are granting your\npermit on the condition that you give us one-third of\nyour land. That's Nollan and Dolan, right?\nMR. WOLFSON: Yes.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Okay. Situation number 2,\npermit is denied, but it will be granted, if you give us\none-third of your land. What about that?\nMR. WOLFSON: I think, in that situation --\nin other words, if the situation is really exactly the\nsame like Nollan and Dolan, but the permit is denied,\nbut it's clear that it is a concrete -- concrete\ncondition, the landowner can go up through the judicial\nreview process and say, this is -- you know, the denial\nof the permit application is predicated on an\nunconstitutional condition, and you should set that\naside.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Is that the same as the\nfirst example, for purposes of Nollan and Dolan?\nMR. WOLFSON: Almost. Almost,\nJustice Alito.\nJUSTICE ALITO: All right. Now let me to get to\nmy third. The permit is denied, but it will be granted,\nif you give us the fair market value of the third of the\nland, and, once you have done that, then we're going to\ncondemn your land and pay you the fair market value for\nit.\nMR. WOLFSON: Justice Alito, I think that\nthis Court's decision -- there are -- this Court's\ndecision in Village of Norwood, essentially says, if\nwhat is going on is just a pure contrivance to avoid the\nrequirement of compensation in the Just Compensation\nClause, that the Court has said, no, it will look\nthrough and -- to the substance of the demand and\ndetermine that there was -- you know, essentially, an\nevasion of the just compensation requirement.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: As I understand your\nposition, cash is magical, right? The -- the government\ncan come in and -- come into my house, take all of the\ncash that's there, and that is not the basis for a takings\nclaim, right? Because cash is not -- is not a taking.\nDoes that make any sense?\nMR. WOLFSON: Well, first of all,\nJustice Scalia, of course, this case, we don't believe\ninvolves cash. It involves a requirement to do\nsomething that costs money, which is -- is different\nfrom cash.\nI mean, cash is -- the problem with\nextending -- the problem with extending the takings\nconcept to a monetary obligation, which can be paid for\nout of sort of undifferentiated funds --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Right.\nMR. WOLFSON: -- is that it has -- it has no\nlogical stopping point. I mean, the court --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The stopping point is don't\ntake my cash.\nMR. WOLFSON: Well, but the --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Your -- your answer to my\nquestion is, that's okay, it's not a taking, right?\nMR. WOLFSON: I think --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I may have some other cause\nof action, but not a -- not a taking? The government's\ncome in and taken my money.\nMR. WOLFSON: It's not a -- it's not a\nNollan and Dolan claim for the government to say, if you\nwant -- if you want a permit --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I'm not talking Nollan and\nDolan. I'm talking about your position that the taking\nof cash cannot be a taking.\nMR. WOLFSON: Well, if a -- I'm sorry,\nJustice Scalia. If the -- if the government is seizing\nthe -- the identifiable dollar bills that are in your --\nin your house, I mean, that sounds more like a case\nlike --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, I see, I see.\nMR. WOLFSON: Webb's Fabulous Pharmacies,\nwhere --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: If they -- if they say, you\nhave to turn over to us whatever money you have in your\nhouse, or you have to turn over to us whatever's in your\nbank account, that's not a taking.\nMR. WOLFSON: Justice Scalia, I think there\nare many -- there are many constitutional claims that\ncould be made. And I also want to add, there is an\nextensive overlay of State law in this area that\nprotects landowners from arbitrary, irrational,\nintrusive, excessive demands by government agencies.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: One of the\nthings the -- the Federal provision, the Takings Clause,\nis designed to prevent property owners from having to\nbear the costs that should be borne by the people as a\nwhole.\nThe football stadium example, there is no\nreason that a particular landowner should have to pay\nfor the football stadium, simply because he owns\nproperty.\nThe Takings Clause is designed to make sure\nthat those exactions are not imposed on property owners,\nbut spread more evenly across the citizens who benefit\nfrom it. And I guess I don't understand why you say\nthat the Takings Clause is the one provision that\ndoesn't apply in that type of situation.\nMR. WOLFSON: Mr. Chief Justice, the -- the\nArmstrong policy of the -- that the government -- that\nan individual person should not be forced to bear what\nsociety should -- what should be spread to society as a\nwhole -- is not violated when the government insists\nthat a landowner comply with a generally applicable\nregulation.\nNow, of course -- of course --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The generally\napplicable regulation in the football stadium\nhypothetical is not generally applicable. It says, you\nare the owner of this property, and if you want to\ndevelop it, you've got to build a football stadium.\nMR. WOLFSON: Well, I think that is saying\nto one particular landowner, you may have to build a\nfootball stadium, where no other type of similar\nregulation or requirement would ever be imposed on any\nother landowner sounds -- you know, like -- you know,\nsounds like an equal protection claim, if the government\njust picks out one landowner.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What if they do it to five\nor six other landowners, okay?\nMR. WOLFSON: Well, then I think you have to\nask -- but, then, Justice Scalia, I think you have to\nask what -- what regulatory scheme is the government --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, let's -- let's\nput -- let's put it this way: I take it, it's -- it's a\ngiven that the government cannot take an easement on\nyour property. It cannot use your property for its own\npurposes. It cannot park its trucks there. It cannot\ncut the grass.\nWhy is it that, if it can't do those, it can\nstill force you, as a condition to using your property\nto its highest and best use, to pay them money?\nMR. WOLFSON: Well, I think --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Why isn't that an equal\nburden -- why isn't that an equal use of the property by\nthe government?\nMR. WOLFSON: I think -- I think, for\nseveral reasons, Justice Kennedy. First of all, I think\nthat this nation has a long legal tradition of giving\nunique legal protection to property, as opposed to\nmoney.\nI mean, there are many circumstances -- many\ncircumstances, where the government can say to an\nindividual, you must give me $1,000, but cannot say --\nor a group of individuals or -- but cannot say to the\nsame group or individual, you must give me land worth\n$1,000.\nI mean, there -- that -- that is what the\nJust Compensation Clause --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Really? Gee, that doesn't\nstrike me as -- as entirely true.\nMR. WOLFSON: Well, Justice --\nJustice Scalia, the government obviously --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You mean a tax that is\nimposed only on landowners, and it's -- you know, it's a\ntax -- $5,000 per landowner, if that were replaced by a\nprovision that said, every -- every landowner shall\ncontribute to the State a portion of his property worth\n$5,000, that --\nMR. WOLFSON: I think that would --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The latter is bad, and the\nformer's okay?\nMR. WOLFSON: I think that would raise very\nserious questions. I mean, I don't know that this Court\nhas ever -- has ever been faced with exactly such a\ncase, but I think that would raise very serious\nquestions.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So that -- am I\nwrong about -- I might have this -- I thought the\nframework, roughly, is the following: it is not the\ncase that Penn Central applies only where there is a\nphysical invasion of property, or there is total\ndestruction of the value of the property.\nIn those two situations, what we said in\nLucas is it applies without case-specific inquiry, but\nthere are another set of cases where Penn Central and\nMcMahon apply with case-specific inquiry.\nAnd those, to discover whether you have one,\nyou look into such things as whether the regulation\ndestroys investment-backed expectations. And then you\nlook to the nature of the government interest and the\nrelationships, et cetera. That's what I thought the\nframework was.\nNow, if that's the framework, then, when the\ngovernment says, I will let you develop your land if and\nonly if you give $50,000 to the Shriners Hospital, you\nwould say, I can't develop my land. And, besides, that\nsignificantly interferes with my investment-backed\nexpectations. And, besides, there is no relation\nwhatsoever. Therefore, I win under the Takings Clause.\nNow, I spell all that out because I -- if\nI'm wrong about that framework -- if I am right about\nthe framework, that can apply to this case. If I am\nwrong about the framework, I want to know where in the\ncases I'm wrong.\nMR. WOLFSON: Justice Breyer, we think that\nyou are right about that framework. That -- and -- and\njust six weeks ago in the --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That surprises me.\nMR. WOLFSON: In the -- well, just six weeks\nago, in the Arkansas Fish and Game Commission case, this\nCourt reiterated that Penn Central is presumed to be the\ntest.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay. So, if I'm right\nabout the framework, that takes care of all the\nhypotheticals you were asked. In those cases, there is\na significant interference with investment-backed\nexpectation. And there's no justification whatsoever,\nso the Takings Clause applies.\nMR. WOLFSON: We agree, Justice Scalia, and\nwe don't --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Justification is the\nprotection of wetlands. That's a justification, the\nprotection of wetlands.\nThere's no necessary comparison, as Nollan\nand Dolan requires, between the harm that would be\noccasioned if the permit were granted and what the State\nis exacting in order to mitigate.\nThat -- that doesn't exist anywhere in -- in\nthe analysis that you are talking about.\nMR. WOLFSON: Well, Justice Scalia, there\nare -- there is another problem with the Nollan and\nDolan claim in this case, which is it's hard to see how\nyou can have an exactions takings claim when nothing has\never actually been exacted --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Now, that is a problem.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. WOLFSON: And -- right.\nAnd so -- and, in this case, if the -- if\nthe claim for the taking is -- for the compensation is\nbased on Nollan and Dolan, it seems that there is a\nmismatch and that what the Petitioner is trying to do is\nsort of take the Nollan/Dolan heightened scrutiny\ngovernment -- government bears the burden of proof\nanalysis and sort of convert that into what is the\nregulatory takings analysis for the entire parcel of his\nland, which is -- which is the measure of damages that\nhe received.\nSo I think that there is a mismatch. And,\nnow, this is --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I think that your\npoint goes to the question that has been raised about --\nthere's no permit issued. He didn't accept the -- the\npermit. And I don't understand that proposition.\nAre you saying that, if you are confronted\nwith an unconstitutional condition, you have to accept\nit, and then you can challenge it? You can't simply say\nyou denied that on the basis of an unconstitutional\ncondition, and that's wrong?\nMR. WOLFSON: No, that's not our argument,\nMr. Chief Justice. Florida has opened an avenue for\njudicial relief for you to go up through the Florida EPA\nprocess, just like the Federal EPA, where you can say,\nstop -- stop the district from doing this to me; they\nare predicating their -- either their grant or their --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay. I'm trying to\nget to the Federal. You often fall back to the State\nprovisions. I'm looking at the Federal Constitution.\nAnd, assuming the State provisions give you\nno relief, is it your position that he has no claim,\nunless he accepts a permit with unconstitutional\nconditions?\nMR. WOLFSON: If there is no -- if there's\nno kind of avenue, as I was saying, then I would think\nwe would then -- you would have to obtain -- you have to\nseek compensation, but your compensation is for the\nvalue of your land that was taken.\nAnd, in Lingle, this Court reiterated that\nthe Takings Clause is not a substantive limitation on\nthe government's power to regulate. The -- the Takings\nClause -- or as I should call it, the Just Compensation\nClause -- is a requirement that if -- that the\ngovernment will pay you just compensation for any\nproperty or property interest it has seized from you.\nIt does not -- it does not, itself, impose\na -- a requirement that the government substantively\njustify its regulation.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Wolfson, why isn't it\nentirely reasonable to say, if you are going to put a\ncondition on a permit, that condition has to have some\nrough proportionate relationship to the harm that is\nbeing done to the permit -- what -- that seems to me\nperfectly sensible, that if they are going -- if they\nare going to exact a condition, the condition has to\nhave some discrete proportional relationship to the\nharm?\nMR. WOLFSON: Justice Ginsburg, I think that\nthe district thought that they were acting roughly\nproportional. In other words, we are -- we are not\nsaying that the government shouldn't act -- that\ngovernment should not act reasonably.\nBut I think that, when you force these cases\ninto court under the Nollan/Dolan framework, you have\na -- you have basically a mismatched and extraordinarily\ncomplex situation. And you have -- you run right into\nwhat this Court said in Lingle, which is that it is not\nordinarily the Court's -- the appropriate approach to\nrequire the government to bear the burden of proof.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, in Penn Coal v.\nMahon, the government didn't enter the property. It\ndidn't take the property in the physical sense of moving\nin inappropriate. It just says, congratulations,\nyou have some coal under your land, and we hope you\nenjoy it because you can't move it.\nAnd we said that is a taking, that is a\nregulation that goes too far. And it deprived, as\nJustice Breyer indicated, the owner of investment-backed\nexpectations, although that word wasn't in Penn-Mahon.\nMR. WOLFSON: Correct. And,\nJustice Kennedy, nobody is disputing that Mr. Koontz\ncould have made the argument that the regulation goes\ntoo far in the sense of the burden on his proposed\nproject. I mean, he had all of those arguments\navailable to him.\nHe bought the -- he says he bought the land\nbefore the regulation went into effect. He had\ninvestment-backed expectations and all the rest of it.\nBut that is not the claim that he is\nadvancing to this Court.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Wolfson.\nMr. Kneedler?\nORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER,\nFOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,\nSUPPORTING THE RESPONDENT\nMR. KNEEDLER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nI would like to emphasize, at the outset,\nthat Petitioner's argument that Nollan and Dolan should\napply in this context would -- would constitute a\nradical change in the -- in the way standard generally\napplicable regulatory programs are operated.\nIt is standard procedure, when someone\napplies for a permit from the government, it is the\npermit applicant's burden to establish that he complies\nwith the regulatory program.\nNollan and Dolan shift that burden to the\ngovernment. That has never been the case under\nregulation, including land use regulation.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What was taken in Nollan\nand Dolan?\nMR. KNEEDLER: If -- if --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: In Nollan, was it the\neasement that was taken?\nMR. KNEEDLER: That is what -- if -- if the\npermit had issued and the -- and an easement was\ngranted, yes, it was the easement.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, but it -- wasn't what\nwas taken unreasonably the ability of this homeowner to\nmake the alterations to his house that he wanted to\nmake? He wanted to add another story and the court --\nand the State said, you can't do it.\nAnd its only basis for saying, you can't do\nit was because you wouldn't give us the easement.\nMR. KNEEDLER: The -- the basis of the --\nthe theory of Nollan and Dolan -- and the Court made\nthis clear in -- in Lingle -- and in Del Monte Dunes,\nfor that matter -- is those two cases apply in a\nspecific situation where there is an exaction of a right\nof access, an easement for the public to enter the land\nas a condition.\nAnd the -- the reason for that, the Court\nexplained in Lingle -- there are really two reinforcing\npoints. The first was that there would be public\naccess, which is a permanent physical occupation, which\nis one of -- one of the exceptions to the general Penn\nCentral test for regulatory takings.\nThe other is that it was a per se taking.\nThe -- it -- it was per se that the government could not\nhave acquired that easement for paying -- without paying\ncompensation; therefore, the government could not attach\nas a condition to the granting of a permit that the\nperson convey something, unless it was proportional.\nSo the -- the theory began with the idea\nthat the easement itself would have been -- the taking\nof that would have been a per se taking. This is a very\ndifferent situation because the other way in which\nPetitioner's theory would constitute a radical departure\nis that compliance with regulatory programs frequently,\nmaybe almost always, requires the expenditure of money.\nIf someone wants to build a power plant -- a\ncoal-fired power plant, he's going to have to install a\nscrubber to protect the air, to prevent no -- diminution\nof air quality. Constructing that costs money. It\ncan't be that the requirement to spend money to comply\nwith a regulatory program is itself a taking.\nThe taking would be --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, what about --\nwhat about the football stadium? Do they -- can you\npick a particular landowner? I mean, you took a case in\nwhich there is no question, under Nollan and Dolan,\nabout the relationship, proportionality, and nexus.\nLet's put those to one side because the\nissue is whether Nollan and Dolan apply. Can the\ngovernment say, okay, you want a permit, we will give\nyou the permit, if you fund the new football stadium?\nMR. KNEEDLER: I think, in that situation,\nthere would be a very substantial equal protection challenge\nbecause one landowner is being singled out with no\nrational basis --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But the one\nconstitutional provision that is concerned with\nprotecting property owners from having to bear burdens\nthat should be borne by the public at large is not\napplicable?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, that -- that -- it\napplies when there is an identifiable property taken.\nIf the --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, no. Why isn't the\nanswer, yes, it is applicable? Of course, it's\napplicable. I own a piece of land, and they have\nsignificantly interfered with my investment-backed\nexpectation.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Right, right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And -- and to say that I\ncan't put a house on this because I'm supposed to pay\nfor a football field, which has nothing to do with it,\nis as close to insisting that you have to have 4,000\ncolumns of coal in your mine, so that you can never use\nit, as I can think of. It's Holmes brought up-to-date.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, certainly --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I mean, at least that\nargument would be made --\nMR. KNEEDLER: Certainly --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And why wouldn't it be a\nwinning argument?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Certainly, a Penn Central\nargument could be made there, but I think that's very\ndifferent from a Nollan argument --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes, I agree with you --\nMR. KNEEDLER: -- which -- which imposes\nthe -- the burden on the government and, basically,\ntreats the -- the payment of money as, itself, a taking.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Kneedler, can I go\nback to the questions presented for a moment? The court\nbelow did two separate rulings, I think.\nOne is there can't be a taking if the -- if\nthe claim is that it's of an undifferentiated money, not\na res. And I think you would agree with that.\nIf the only issue is an obligation to pay\nmoney, that that's not a takings claim, correct?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Yes. And this is not even an\nobligation to pay money. It's an obligation to spend\nmoney to come into compliance.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Right. There was a\nsecond holding, however, which really gets ellipsed by\nthe second, which is a denial of a permit doesn't permit\nyou to raise the Nollan/Dolan case. And it appears, to\nme, even if there is an easement situation -- so, even\nif there is an actual takings claim at issue, do you\nagree with that first holding by the court below?\nMR. KNEEDLER: We -- we think --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Assuming we narrow it\nnot to undifferentiated money, but is there a difference\nbetween a denial or a grant?\nMR. KNEEDLER: No. If the -- if the agency\ndecision is written where there is an express condition,\nwe don't think that it matters -- an express condition\nsatisfying Nollan and Dolan; in other words, an\nexaction, a per se taking, we don't think it matters\nwhether the -- whether it's a permit grant or permit\ndenial.\nThere was no actual taking in the sense that\ncompensation would be owed, but it could be challenged\nas an unconstitutional condition under the Nollan and\nDolan analysis.\nBut we think it's critical, when thinking\nabout that, that the -- that the permit denial -- that\nonly applies if the permit denial expressly is based on\nthe condition because, otherwise, you would get into a\nsituation of negotiations and what was discussed and --\nand liability could turn on an exchange of ideas;\nwhereas it should turn on the formality of the agency's\nfinal decision.\nIt's akin to the Williamson County final\ndecision requirements.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you agree -- your\nfriend on the other side cited a number of places in the\nrecord, where he thought your condition was satisfied,\nthat the denial of the permit was expressly based on the\nfailure to comply with the offered conditions.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, if you look at the --\nthe orders denying the permit applications in the record\nat -- I believe it's 49 to 51 and 59 to 61. In those\nsituations, it says the permits were denied because the\nplaintiff did not give the reasonable assurances that\nthe statute requires in order to get the permit -- the\nreasonable assurances of -- of no loss of wetlands\nfunctions.\nOne of the ways --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Isn't this unreal? I mean,\nyou are saying, all along, in the negotiations, the\nagency says, if you do X, you get the permit. And X\nis -- would -- would be an unconstitutional condition.\nOkay. He refuses to do X. The permit is\ndenied with a general statement like this: The permit\nis denied because he has refused to do the -- the\nnecessary mitigation.\nIsn't it clear that the reason he's refused\nto do the necessary mitigation, is he has refused the\nlast demand of the agency?\nMR. KNEEDLER: But the ultimate standard\nunder the statute is whether he has provided reasonable\nassurances. What assurances -- the way in which he goes\nabout it, whether offsite or onsite -- the offsite part\njust arises because this is a wetlands case.\nNormal regulation wouldn't raise the\noffsite -- onsite problem. But the ultimate question is\nhe didn't carry his burden of establishing no net loss\nof wetlands.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, what he's going to\nsay, in part, is -- I guess, I did a little numbers from\nyour brief, the 37 million acres in Florida, say about\n4 million are bodies of water and say a third of them\nare built up, and we have 11 million that are wetland\nand 11 million that aren't. That's crude.\nSo they're saying why in heaven's name are\nwe supposed to -- everybody wants to build. And why\nshould the people that happen to live in wetland have to\npay for all the other wetland? That's just coincidence.\nSo he is going to say that that is like the Shriners\nHospital. You are going to say, no, it isn't like the\nShriners Hospital.\nNow, all I'm saying is isn't it at least an\nissue, under the Takings Clause, whether it is or isn't?\nMR. KNEEDLER: I think it's clearly not like\nthe Shriners -- the Shriners Hospital --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I know you'll say that. He\nwill say that it is.\nMR. KNEEDLER: But I did want to come back\nto Justice Scalia's question. The permit -- permit\ndenials -- just general permit denials, the Court made\nclear, in Del Monte Dunes, are not covered by Nollan and\nDolan. They are covered by Penn Central.\nAnd the Court made clear, in Nollan, that\nthe Court could have denied the permit without attaching\nthe condition. We think it's important that the agency\nalways have that option.\nAnd the third point is --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, you may be right, but\nyou are making Nollan and Dolan a trap only for really\nstupid districts -- you know, if they -- they say the\nright words and then they are out from under it; isn't\nthat right?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, I don't think so\nbecause -- because there are situations in which an\nagency actually wants to get the easement. But this\nCourt, in Lingle, made clear that -- that the general\nrule is Penn Central, with only the two exceptions for\nregulatory takings --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, why should it matter whether\nthe -- whether the permitting authority says expressly\nin the denial, \"It's denied because you didn't do this,\"\nor it just says, \"It's denied,\" but it's perfectly well\nunderstood what was needed -- what they were going to\ndemand in order to get it.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Because -- if may I answer,\nbecause the agency has to reserve -- has to have the\nability to -- to deny the permit because the conditions\nrequired by the statute were not met.\nAnd Nollan and Dolan deal with formality and\nthe formality of conveyance of an easement. If there is\nnot a document that requires that, then the strict\nrequirements of -- for the narrow exception in Nollan\nand Dolan do not apply.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Kneedler.\nMr. Beard, you have three minutes.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL J. BEARD, II,\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. BEARD: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nI would just like to point the Court -- and\nparticularly Justice Scalia, to pages 30 and 31 of our\nbrief on the merits where we describe, with citations to\nthe Nollan and Dolan, what precisely happened there.\nI want to make sure that it's clear that\nwhat they did there was not issue permits. They\napproved with conditions, but the property owner still\nhad to satisfy the conditions in order to receive the\npermit.\nAs to the question about --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What do we do with what\nMr. Kneedler says is a ruling in your favor on this\nquestion, that all denials are subject to Nollan and\nDolan? What do we do with that?\nI mean, what's the -- I see an enormous\nflood gate here and one in which we are sending a signal\nthat, perhaps, States should be more quiet, rather than\nmore engaging. They should just say no because anything\nthey offer is going to be seen as an -- potentially, as\nan unconstitutional taking.\nThey should just plain say no and not\nexplain why, not engage in any work with you to\nmitigate.\nMR. BEARD: Justice Sotomayor, I don't\nbelieve that negotiations will suddenly break down, and\nwe will see a flurry of permit denials, if the Court\nrules in our favor. What will happen, instead -- it's\ntrue, I should say, they will lose flexibility in\ndemanding whatever it is that they want under the\nTakings Clause.\nThey won't have any review. But the benefit\nof applying our rule that says monetary exaction should\nbe treated like other exactions and be reviewed under\nNollan and Dolan --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But they're not. People\nare asked to pay taxes. Homeowners are asked to pay\ntaxes all the time; development fees, if they want to\ndevelop something. People are subject to money\nexactions all of the time in this society.\nMR. BEARD: No question that we all are\nsubject, on a daily basis, to government demands that we\npay or that we have a financial obligation.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So what happens in\njust -- when the legislature passes a development fee?\nAre you, now, saying that's subject to Nollan and Dolan,\ntoo?\nMR. BEARD: If the legislation requires an\nagency who processes the permit to impose a fee in\nexchange for a permit -- again, within the land-use\ncontext, we are not talking about taxes, homeowners'\nfees, we are talking within the discretionary land-use\nprocess -- that is imposed there, then the risk of\ncoercion, undue influence, and the like arise, and\nNollan and Dolan should apply.\nBut I wanted to respond specifically to\nJustice Breyer's questions about Penn Central. I think,\nconceptually, there is an important difference between\nthe Unconstitutional Conditions Doctrine, which is what\nwe seek to apply here, and what would be a permit -- or\nwhat would be a Penn Central claim.\nThe Unconstitutional Conditions Doctrine,\nthe offense there is the -- may I --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Finish your thought.\nMR. BEARD: The offense there is the\nconditioning -- the improper conditioning of a permit.\nIt's not did the condition force me to lose the value in\nmy land. That's a very different question that a case\nlike Penn Central might answer, subsequent to a permit\ndenial.\nThe Unconstitutional Conditions Doctrine\nfocuses exclusively on the permit exaction and on the\nconditioning, not on subsequent decisions by the\ngovernment, for example, to deny the permit.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMR. BEARD: Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel.\nThe case is now submitted.\n(Whereupon, at 12:09 p.m., the case in the\nabove-entitled matter was submitted.)\nadverse 8:7 49:24 55:21 areas 14:23
