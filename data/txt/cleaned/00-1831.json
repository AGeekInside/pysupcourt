        "content": "(10:01 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: We'll hear argument\nnow in Number 00-1831, United States v. Sandra Craft.\nMr. Jones.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF KENT L. JONES\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. JONES: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please\nthe Court:\nThe question in this case is whether the Federal\ntax lien that applies by operation of law to all property\nand rights to property of a delinquent taxpayer attaches\nto the interest of that taxpayer in a tenancy by the\nentirety. The taxpayer in this case was an attorney who,\nfor 10 years, failed to file a Federal income tax return\nand accumulated a Federal tax obligation of approximately\nhalf a million dollars.\nAt the time the taxes were assessed and the\nnotice of tax lien was filed, the taxpayer owned a real\nproperty in a joint tenancy by the entirety with his wife.\nHe then conveyed his interest in that property to his wife\nfor $1, and when his wife then sought to sell the property\nthe tax lien appeared in the title record.\nQUESTION: Now, tell us about the fraudulent\nconveyance proceeding. Does the fraudulent conveyance\nholding, or finding, make no difference one way or the\nother? If it was a fraudulent conveyance the husband has\nthe property -- you can -- well, if it was a fraudulent\nconveyance, you can pursue the property, and if it wasn't,\nthe lien is still there anyway under your theory. Is that\nthe way it works?\nMR. JONES: I think that we would say that the\nlien, the question of the validity of the lien is the\nfirst question. If the lien is valid you don't need to\naddress the fraudulent conveyance question. Indeed, we\nhaven't presented the fraudulent --\nQUESTION: Right.\nMR. JONES: -- conveyance question in this case.\nIf the lien were not valid, it would still be\npossible to go after property in certain circumstances if\nthere had been a fraudulent conveyance, but on this record\nwe're not challenging the determination that as a matter\nof State law there was not a fraudulent conveyance, except\nfor this fraudulent enhancement portion that the court\nawarded.\nQUESTION: Mr. Jones, as part of the background,\nhow did it come about that it's only the taxpayer who has\nthe liability? Did she file separate returns, or was she\nan innocent spouse?\nMR. JONES: In this case, the taxpayer is the\nhusband. The husband was an attorney, and he filed no\nreturn, and when -- there's two ways for this issue to\ncome up. Either spouse may file either no return, or file\nonly a separate return. It's only when they file a joint\nreturn that they are jointly and severally liable for the\ntax obligation, so if, as in this case, the taxpayer\nsimply files no return at all, then the obligation is\nexclusively that -- the tax obligation is that of the\nnonfiler, in this case the husband.\nIndeed, Judge Ryan pointed out in his separate\nopinion that the decision of this Court, of the court of\nappeals is very amenable to abuse, because on this theory\nboth spouses can earn income, neither of them can file a\nreturn, or they can both file a separate return, and then\nthey can put all of their real and personal property in a\ntenancy by the entirety, including stocks and bonds in\nStates like Michigan and Maryland, and claim a complete\nexemption of all of their property from Federal tax\nobligations.\nNow, in --\nQUESTION: -- some penalties for failing to file\na return?\nMR. JONES: There are some penalties, but the\npenalties, like taxes, have to be enforced against the\nproperty of the taxpayer, and if the taxpayer is allowed\nto exempt all of its property in this fashion, then\nthere's literally no way that the taxes can be enforced\nthrough civil procedures.\nQUESTION: What about criminal procedures? Are\nthere any criminal procedures for --\nMR. JONES: I --\nQUESTION: -- failure, continued failure to\nfile --\nMR. JONES: Of course, if you file a return,\nthen you're not exposing yourself to any criminal\nobligations, and if you don't file a return, it would\nbe -- I'm not familiar with a statute that makes that a\ncrime by itself. Now, it may be that it's a crime in\nconnection with some intent to conceal, but just the fact\nthat you didn't file -- I'm not -- frankly, I'm not --\neven though I come before the Court on tax cases, I'm not\nan expert on criminal tax matters, but it's my impression\nthat that would not by itself be a crime.\nNow, the Federal tax --\nQUESTION: We'd better not let the word get out.\nI thought that it was a crime, but I'll check.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. JONES: All right, well, I stand --\nQUESTION: We'll keep it just among ourselves.\nMR. JONES: I will defer all questions on title\n18 to Justice Kennedy. I'm simply not --\nQUESTION: Do we know as a matter of fact what\nher situation was? Did she not file also? Did she file a\nseparate return?\nMR. JONES: I don't know whether she had any\nincome of her own. I don't know whether she was required\nto, whether she did file a return -- this case does not\ninvolve this -- the wife's taxes. It involves the half-\nmillion dollars of taxes of the husband.\nQUESTION: Yes, I know. I was just curious how\nthat came about.\nMR. JONES: I don't believe the record reflects.\nNow, the comprehensive text of the Federal tax\nlien reaches not only all property of the taxpayer but all\nrights to property of the taxpayer, and this Court has\nconsistently held that this broad text shows a plain\nintent to reach every type of interest that a taxpayer\nmight have in property, and two terms ago in the Drye case\nthe Court summarized these holdings and said that the\nFederal tax lien reaches every species of valuable,\nlegally protected right or interest of the taxpayer, and\nthe simple question that we have before us today is\nwhether a taxpayer who has an interest in a tenancy by the\nentirety has any valuable legally protected interest in\nthe property.\nQUESTION: Well, of course, isn't the issue\nwhether the taxpayer has a legal interest in the property?\nIsn't that the issue?\nMR. JONES: That is the underlying issue in this\ncase.\nQUESTION: And the other side says no, there's\nthis mythical entity called the marriage, or something\nlike that, is the owner.\nMR. JONES: Well, it's a real entity. There is\nreally a marriage. It's just that the property interests\nare, in fact, owned by the individual spouses, as I can\nexplain by going through what rights a tenant by the\nentirety has under the applicable law in this case, which\nis Michigan law. A --\nQUESTION: But are any of those rights legal\nrights owned by the taxpayer.\nMR. JONES: Yes.\nQUESTION: That's the basic question.\nMR. JONES: Yes, and indeed, in fact, the\nsupreme court in Michigan has so held.\nLet me just describe these rights that the\ntaxpayer has. The individual owner of the -- each spouse\nin a tenancy by the entirety has the right to occupy and\nuse the premises, has the right, with the consent of the\nother spouse, to mortgage or sell it, and under section --\nQUESTION: Wait, wait. Strike that one. I\nmean, that's -- the marriage can sell it. I mean, with\nthe consent of the other one is just to say --\nMR. JONES: This is --\nQUESTION: -- tenancy by the entirety. It's the\nmarriage that sells it.\nMR. JONES: That is exactly the interest that\nthe taxpayer had in the Rodgers case in a homestead\nestate. He could not sell his properties separately from\nthat of his spouse. He could only mortgage or sell it\nwith the right, with the concurrence of the spouse, and\nwhat the Court held in Rodgers --\nQUESTION: But he had a legal interest in the\nproperty.\nMR. JONES: Yes, he did.\nQUESTION: He did.\nMR. JONES: Yes, and if I might go on, there are\nmore interests involved. I mean, even if you wanted to\nstop there, we can't stop there, because the taxpayer in\nfact has greater interests than the ones we've already\ndescribed.\nUnder section 557.71 of the Michigan Code, which\nis quoted at page 41 of the joint appendix and page 3 of\nour reply brief, each spouse in -- since 1975 each spouse\nin Michigan has had the right to equal portion of the\nincome from the property, that is, the interest, the\ndividends, the rents, to the profits, and is entitled to\nhalf of the proceeds on the sale of the property. Each\nspouse under Michigan law is entitled to half of the\nproperty on divorce, and has a right of survivorship that\ngives him the fee simple, absolute --\nQUESTION: Presumably the Government could get a\nlien on any of those things if they ever came into being.\nMR. JONES: They are in being, and that's what\nthe supreme court of Michigan pointed out in Dow v. State.\nThe court held that these significant interests in\nproperty possessed by each spouse are property for\npurposes of the constitutional Due Process Clause, and\nthat each spouse must separately be given notice of any\naction affecting their significant property interests.\nQUESTION: Given notice by whom?\nMR. JONES: Of any action that might be brought\nwith respect to the property. In other words, under the\nDue Process Clause you have to have notice and an\nopportunity to be heard if there's property affected, and\nwhat the court said is that these significant -- I'm\nquoting. These significant interests in property of each\nspouse entitle each of them to separate notice, because\nthey have separate rights.\nNow --\nQUESTION: How did that case come up? I mean,\nwas somebody suing the tenants by the entirety, or --\nMR. JONES: My recollection is that it was a\nforeclosure-type case.\nNow, the pecuniary right of each spouse to half\nthe income and half of the proceeds on the sale is an\nordinary kind of right to money. It is a\nquintessential --\nQUESTION: May I just interrupt you once more?\nYou, in describing the case, said that each of them was\nentitled to notice because each of them had a separate\nright in the property. Is that what the State court\nsaid --\nMR. JONES: Yes.\nQUESTION: -- or is that your sort of\ninterpretation?\nMR. JONES: It said that -- the words -- well, I\ndon't have the text in front of me. It said the\nseparate --\nQUESTION: It makes a big difference. They're\neach entitled to notice --\nMR. JONES: Each spouse --\nQUESTION: -- which is -- because each had a\nseparate right --\nMR. JONES: It says each spouse is entitled to\nseparate notice --\nQUESTION: Right.\nMR. JONES: -- because they have a significant\ninterest in the property, and --\nQUESTION: Mr. Jones, you're not asserting that\nthe Government's lien gives it any greater right than he\nhas, so the recitation that you had, you're not saying\nthat the Government lien means that they could preempt her\nright, are you?\nMR. JONES: No. We're saying that we have those\nrights. In fact, in this case that is the issue. There\nwas the sale. There was a consensual sale of the\nproperty. Half of the proceeds were placed in escrow.\nHalf were given to the wife as her undisputed 50-percent\nshare, half were placed in escrow pending determination of\nthe validity of the lien. That's what this case is. It's\nthat --\nQUESTION: Would the case be any different if\nthat transaction you just referred to hadn't taken place?\nWould the Government's case be weaker?\nMR. JONES: The Government's case would be\nsignificantly different if the sale had not occurred.\nThen we would presumably be waiting to see what happened,\nor we would under Rodgers be attempting to bring a\nforeclosure case. We haven't attempted to do that here\nbecause we didn't need to do it and, in fact, we rarely\ndo, and while I'm on the foreclosure issue, let me point\nout that Rodgers held that a joint interest can be\nforeclosed notwithstanding that neither spouse by\nthemselves force the sale of it.\nWhat the Court explained was that Congress\nspecifically provided in 7403 of the code that the\nforeclosure applies to the entire property, and that in\nthat sale the rights of the innocent spouse are protected\nand, indeed, the court, the district court has discretion\nnot even to order a foreclosure if it so chooses.\nQUESTION: But --\nQUESTION: Well, let's assume you do foreclose\nbecause we find that, indeed, the husband has a property\ninterest in the tenancy by the entirety, so you foreclose.\nNow, I guess some of his interest you've just\npointed out is a right to half of the income from the\nproperty, but surely his most significant interest is that\nhe is entitled to half of the whole property if the\nmarriage dissolves, right?\nMR. JONES: Or of it's sold, and he's entitled\nto all of it if he's the survivor.\nQUESTION: Right. These are all contingencies,\nokay. How do you -- you foreclose -- how do we value\nthese contingencies?\nMR. JONES: This --\nQUESTION: What do we -- we have people come in\nand say how stable the marriage is, or what?\nMR. JONES: This Court discussed that exact,\nwhat the Court called the practical reality in the Rodgers\ncase, and gave a detailed example that I think took three\nor four pages of the Court's opinion in Rodgers,\nexplaining how you would value the respective interests of\nthe parties.\nLet me also suggest to the Court that there is a\nvery thorough and thoughtful decision of the district\ncourt in New Jersey in United States v. Jones in 1995 that\ndiscusses the circumstances when discretion would not be\nexercised to allow foreclosure of tenancy-by-the-entirety\nproperty, and the Court concluded that there were\ncircumstances which that case was one, where instead of\nforeclosing on the property, the property rights of -- the\nUnited States would simply be put in the position of\nholding the right of survivorship of the delinquent\nspouse, and in addition, the right of that spouse to half\nof the rents would be recognized immediately on behalf of\nthe United States.\nThe foreclosure remedy, I've heard cases\ndescribe it as a drastic remedy. Well, I don't know if\nit's drastic, but it's a remedy that doesn't have to be\nexercised, and that there are cases that explain\ncircumstances when it's appropriate in the court's view\nnot to do so.\nQUESTION: But in your view, you always value\nthe taxpayer's interest at 50 percent?\nMR. JONES: No. I think in the Rodgers -- well,\nif the property's been sold, yes. If the property hasn't\nbeen sold, and we're talking about in a foreclosure\ncontext, I believe the Rodgers court goes through the\nexample of the varying life expectancies of the two\ntenants, and which one -- and I believe what the Court in\nRodgers said was that each of them should be treated as if\nthey have a life estate plus a right of survivorship, and\nthe Court explains how that could well -- I think in the\nfacts of Rodgers resulted in only 10 percent of the\nproceeds being applied to the husband's interest and 90\npercent being retained on behalf of the spouse, but --\nQUESTION: But there must be a foreclosure to\nthat extent?\nMR. JONES: There -- that was a -- I believe\nthose were hypothetical facts that the Court discussed in\nRodgers.\nQUESTION: Mr. Jones, during the continuance of\nthe marriage can either spouse force a sale?\nMR. JONES: No, and that was the point made in\nRodgers also, that in any kind of joint tenancy -- by the\nway, I should emphasize --\nQUESTION: But I thought joint -- I may be wrong\nin this. I thought a joint tenancy could be converted\ninto a common tenancy by the action of one --\nMR. JONES: I misspoke. It's not in every joint\ntenancy. It is a common feature of joint tenancies that\nthey can't be forcibly sold by one and, indeed --\nQUESTION: During the continuance of the joint\ntenancy.\nMR. JONES: Correct, and that that was the case\nin Rodgers --\nQUESTION: Okay.\nMR. JONES: -- where the homestead right could\nnot be --\nQUESTION: But I take it from your earlier\nanswer that there is, in tenancies by the entirety there\nis no such legal means of converting that tenancy into a\ntenancy in common which then can either be the subject of\na forced sale or petition, is that correct?\nMR. JONES: I believe that's correct, and I\nbelieve it was also true in Rodgers of the homestead\nestate, which is a common -- which is also a common\nestate.\nIn fact, in this Court's opinion in Jacobs in\n1939, where the Court said that we were not -- the Federal\ntax laws were not bound by the ancient fictions of\ntenancies by the entirety, the Court pointed out that a\njoint tenancy and a tenancy by the entirety create the\nsame rights. The only difference is the fiction of the\nmarital unit, and the Court held in the Jacobs case, as it\nhad held 9 years earlier in the Tyler case, that that\nfeudal fiction or ancient fiction did not bind the tax\nprovisions, that the tax provisions were to be implied in\nlight of the actual rights of the tenants and not based\nupon the artificial rules of State law, and then in Irvine\nand in Drye just two terms ago this Court, in interpreting\nthe term, property, and rights to property and Federal tax\nlegislation and in the lien statute said that we look to\nthe realities of the taxpayer's right, and we're not\nstruck blind by legal fictions of artificial --\nQUESTION: But the realities of taxpayer rights\ndepend on State law, don't they?\nMR. JONES: The realities of the taxpayer's\nright are drawn from State law, but we're not supposed\nto -- I mean, in the words of the Court, let the\nartificial rules of State law blind us to the realities of\nthose rights, and let me give you --\nQUESTION: Well now, what's the difference, do\nyou think, between the artificial rules and the realities?\nMR. JONES: Well, this Court has said that\ndifference can be seen in tenancies by the entirety, that\nthe realities are that the tenants -- I mean, it is a\nfiction. The respondent admits it's a fiction. Every --\nQUESTION: Well --\nMR. JONES: The word fiction is what is implied\nhere.\nQUESTION: You say it's a fiction. What do you\nmean by it?\nMR. JONES: What is a fiction is the idea that\nneither spouse actually owns an interest in this property.\nThat's the fiction.\nQUESTION: So is a corporation a fiction, but we\ndon't tax the shareholders for income of the corporation.\nIt's a fiction acknowledged at law and --\nMR. JONES: It's a legal entity. It has an\nexistence. The marital unit is the fiction.\nQUESTION: So is the marriage --\nMR. JONES: The marriage --\nQUESTION: -- for purposes of the tenancy by the\nentirety.\nMR. JONES: The marriage is the fact. What's\nthe fiction is that these spouses don't own anything.\nUnder State law they do own something. They own something\nsignificant, as the supreme court of Michigan has said,\nand let me give you an example of how courts have been\nblinded by this fiction.\nThe line of cases that respondent relies on\nbegins with the Eighth Circuit decision of the United\nStates v. Hutcherson in 1951. In that case, which started\nus down this path, the court made what are now clearly, I\nthink, two errors under this Court's precedents. The\nfirst error that the court made was to say that we own --\nthat this question about what's property or a right to\nproperty is solely a question of State law.\nWell, we know that what's a question of State\nlaw is what are the interests created, but whether it's\nproperty or right to property is a question of Federal\nlaw. The Court made that clear in '56 in Bess, emphasized\nit again in National Bank of Commerce, and held it\nspecifically, what, two terms ago.\nNow, the other thing that Hutcherson got wrong\nright from the beginning was this idea that you -- that\nthe fiction of State law is controlling, and I'm -- what\nthe court said is, the interest of a tenant by the\nentirety in the property cannot be subject to the Federal\nlien because, in the words of the court, that interest is\nlike a rainbow in the sky, or like the morning fog rising\nacross the valley.\nWell, once we get past the metaphorical fog,\nthere is indisputably actual value at the end of this\nfictional rainbow. It is -- these people have pecuniary\nrights, the rights to receive money, and in this case the\ntenant had a right to receive half the proceeds of the\nsale, and the United States is attaching that right to\nreceive money just like it would any other right to\nreceive money.\nQUESTION: These are all contingent rights.\nWould the Government attach or foreclose a piece of real\nestate that had been bequeathed to the taxpayer's brother\nand which would eventually come to the taxpayer,\nperhaps --\nMR. JONES: No.\nQUESTION: -- depending upon what contingencies\noccurred?\nMR. JONES: And the Court made that point in\nDrye. It made the difference between what is a legally\nprotected right and what is a -- what was the word you\nwere using?\nQUESTION: Contingent.\nMR. JONES: No, not a contingency.\nQUESTION: A contingency.\nMR. JONES: It was --\nQUESTION: Expectancy.\nMR. JONES: An expectancy, thank you. An\nexpectancy is something that is not a legally protected\nright. The expectancy that was described in Drye was the\nhope that the will on which you're a beneficiary won't be\nchanged before the decedent dies.\nYou have no right that the decedent won't change\nthe will. That's just an expectancy. But once the\ndecedent died, the right, the legally protected right that\nwas at issue in Drye was the irrevocable right to inherit\nor to disclaim.\nNow, once this tenancy has been created, these\ntenants have these vested rights. Now, their rights may\nbe contingent in terms of events happening in the future,\nbut it's nothing more -- nothing is more common than to\nsay that a contingent right is a property interest.\nQUESTION: Well --\nQUESTION: Certainly the community property\nStates, the concept of a marital community has some\nsignificance, I think. It isn't just a rainbow in the\nsky. That doesn't mean that you don't look at what rights\nthe individual members of the community may have, but what\nyou're saying is --\nMR. JONES: Well --\nQUESTION: Go ahead.\nMR. JONES: If I might, in a case called United\nStates v. Mitchell, involving the community property right\nof a spouse to disclaim her interest in the income of her\nspouse, this Court said that the disclaimer, this\nretroactive disclaimer, this fiction of State law would\nnot be recognized and would not upset the application of\nFederal tax principles.\nQUESTION: But it was retroactive.\nMR. JONES: It was a fiction.\nQUESTION: Before the disclaimer occurred\nthere's no doubt who was entitled to the money. She was,\nand this was more than a fiction. It was undoing a\nproperty right that the State recognized until the\ndisclaimer occurred.\nMR. JONES: Well, and indeed the State\nrecognizes these property rights. The State says there's\nsignificant interest in property, and it isn't silly just\nfor me to stand here and say it's a fiction. It is a\nfiction. This Court has said it's a fiction. In 1930 --\nQUESTION: Mr. Jones, would you comment on one\naspect of the case that troubles me? Let's assume -- I\nthink there are two court of appeals decisions out there\nthat are squarely on point and against you, and you say\nare incorrectly decided.\nMR. JONES: Yes.\nQUESTION: Let's assume they are incorrectly\ndecided, but they've been the only guidance for the tax\nbar for 40 or 50 years, and is there other reliance\ninterests that the tax bar can say, well, we always\nthought that, given those cases that Congress had not\nsought to overrule, we have a right to follow them?\nMR. JONES: Well, the tax bar is not a party to\nthis case, and -- but that's --\nQUESTION: No, but we have to be concerned\nabout --\nMR. JONES: Okay, well, that's --\nQUESTION: -- the community's reliance on\ndecisions that have been given by the Federal courts.\nMR. JONES: The answer -- I believe the answer\nto your question is no, that there is no embedded reliance\non this principle because, as we pointed out in our brief,\neven in Michigan there is an express caution given by the\nState bar to title examiners saying that, in light of the\n1975 enactment of this statute that gives each spouse an\nequal right to all of the income and profits from the\nproperty, that the State bar advised title examiners that\nthey could not give an opinion that the interest of an\nindividual spouse was not subject to the lien.\nMoreover, in 1983, I believe it was, this Court\nhad a discussion about the status of tenancy by the\nentirety under the Federal lien, and the majority opinion\nin a footnote questioned these older cases, so I do not\nthink that a title examiner, especially in Michigan, would\nbe able to say that he had upset settled expectations.\nQUESTION: So this case involves only Michigan,\nand if you have States that do not provide that the --\neach spouse has an interest in the income, it might be a\ndifferent answer.\nMR. JONES: There is, indeed, a narrow basis\nthat you just described for resolving this case, and it\nwould be an appropriate way to resolve the case because we\nhave the fund -- we have here the voluntary -- the sale,\nwith the proceeds available for distribution, so we don't\nhave to reach the broader question of whether the\nexistence of the right of survivorship, which is an\nundisputed personal interest, is sufficient for the lien\nto attach and, a la Rodgers, be subject to a foreclosure\naction. It would -- and --\nQUESTION: I must say, when you get to the\nsurvivorship, that's there I have real problems with your\ncase. I could just -- you answered my earlier\nhypothetical by just saying, well, you know, there's a\ncontingency that the will might be changed. Well, let's\nassume it's not a will. Let's assume it's an irrevocable\ntrust, under which you have a contingent future interest.\nWould you really say that the Government can move against\nthe entire corpus of the trust just because there's a\ncontingent future interest on the part of a defaulting\ntaxpayer?\nMR. JONES: The Government's lien attaches to\nthe interests of the contingent remaindermen, and there\nare cases on that very point. I am not familiar with the\nproblem I think you're describing which is, well, can you\nthen foreclose on the trust, and how would we value --\nQUESTION: Well, that's how the statute reads.\nYou can assert the lien on any property in which the\ntaxpayer has an interest.\nMR. JONES: That's correct.\nQUESTION: And you're saying the taxpayer has an\ninterest --\nMR. JONES: Yes.\nQUESTION: -- in this trust --\nMR. JONES: Yes.\nQUESTION: -- in which he has a future\ncontingency.\nMR. JONES: That's correct.\nQUESTION: I mean, that's a -- I --\nMR. JONES: That's correct, but also that\nsection 7403 reserves the right of a district court not to\naward foreclosure and, of course, foreclosure requires the\nGovernment to do something.\nQUESTION: We hope you get a tenderhearted\ndistrict judge. I don't think that that's --\nMR. JONES: Well, the United States, so far as I\nknow this controversy that you're concerned about has not\nbeen presented in an actual case, so I'm not sure that\nit's a -- I mean, it's a theoretical issue that I don't\nbelieve has been confronted, but what has been confronted\nis, does the lien attach to contingent remainders, and\nthat's In re -- well, there's a lot of In re's. I think\nit's Rosenberg's Will is the leading case on this. We\ncited it in a footnote, and it explains that the Federal\ntax lien applies to all property and rights to property.\nQUESTION: Well then, how -- do you then value\nthe contingent remainder?\nMR. JONES: Well, as I was saying, I don't know\nof a case where a foreclosure has been sought on a\ncontingent remainder. What's probably the more likely\nresult, because it's the more economical result, is to\nwait for the contingency to occur, and that's --\nQUESTION: And the case you're talking about\nwhere a lien was asserted against the contingent\nremainder, what was it asserted against, after the\nremainder had no longer been contingent?\nMR. JONES: I would -- I'm -- to be honest, I\nwould be guessing, but my guess is --\nQUESTION: Okay. I mean, that's a different\nquestion.\nMR. JONES: Well, the --\nQUESTION: I want a case in which, on the basis\nthat the taxpayer had an interest --\nMR. JONES: Right.\nQUESTION: -- had a purely contingent interest\nin some corpus. The Federal Government was enabled to\nassert a lien against the entire corpus. That seems to me\nextravagant.\nMR. JONES: Well, as you use the word\ncontingency, that would include Rodgers, because that was\na case where there was -- a right of survivorship was the\nvalued interest, but there's also the Bank One case,\nSpendthrift Trust, the right of a person to obtain income\nfrom a Spendthrift Trust is subject to the Federal lien.\nAny kind of right, legally protected, valuable interest\nhas been subjected to the Federal lien, and what the --\nthis case reduces to is the idea that simply by, that even\nthough they've, the State recognizes that there are\nvaluable, legally protected interests in each spouse, that\nby calling it a -- a something else, that the lien\nwouldn't apply, and that's exactly what the Court\nindicated in Drye shouldn't happen, that the Court\nindicated that the mere fact that the State doesn't\ncharacterize this valuable, legally protected right as\nproperty doesn't prevent the Federal lien from attaching.\nI would like to reserve my time for rebuttal.\nQUESTION: Very well, Mr. Jones.\nMr. Sutton, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY S. SUTTON\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. SUTTON: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and\nmay it please the Court:\nThere are some serious misunderstandings about\nthe meaning of Michigan law which go to the heart of the\nproper resolution of this case under Federal law. First\nof all, the Government has relied very heavily on a 1975\nMichigan statute that says, spouses in a tenancy by the\nentirety have equal rights to rent and income and to\nprofits. That's section 1 of the statute that I just\nquoted.\nIf you look at page 209 of that statute in the\nSixth Circuit appendix, regrettably not in your appendix,\nyou'll see that the second section of that statute says\nthat only applies to tenancies by the entirety created\nafter 1975. This tenancy was created in 1972. That\nstatute is utterly irrelevant. It in all events was\ndesigned primarily just to deal with what happens when the\ntenancy ends, that is, when there's a divorce, just to\nmake sure that both spouses have a right to the property.\nA second misunderstanding, the Government says\nthat the rights to proceeds, once you have proceeds as a\nspouse, that somehow that means the tenancy is over and\nthe creditors, Federal, State, city, private, can get at\nit. That's wrong. Under Michigan law, Muskegon Lumber,\n1953, Michigan supreme court case, says that it continues\nas a tenancy in the entirety. Why? Because most people\nsell their house to buy another. You wouldn't destroy\nit --\nQUESTION: Well, we're not used to resolving\nquestions of State law here. If you say the State law of\nMichigan is one thing and the Government says the State\nlaw of Michigan is the other, it's difficult for us to go\nin and referee the thing. What is the strongest Michigan\ncase for your point of view?\nMR. SUTTON: Your Honor, 1885, Vinton v. Beamer,\ngoing forward to Sanford, going to Budwit v. Herr -- those\nare, you know, separated by 20 or 30 years each -- every\nsingle one of them makes clear that with respect to the\nspecific belonging-to language in this statute there is no\ninterest that belongs to one spouse or another. They're\nindivisible interests. There's a unity of title and,\ncritically, if that unity of title is broken, Michigan law\nsays under Budwit v. Herr, a Michigan supreme court\ndecision, the tenancy is destroyed.\nQUESTION: And you say the 1975 statute does not\naffect this case at all?\nMR. SUTTON: It's irrelevant, Your Honor. By\nits terms it only applies to tenancies that are created\nafter 1975. That's section 2. It's in the act. That's\nnot legislative history. That's in the act.\nQUESTION: Mr. Sutton, how does it differ from\nother cases where under State law a predator can't touch\nthe thing, like a Spendthrift Trust, or like what was\ninvolved in Drye? Even though not a single predator in\nthat State could touch that inheritance, the Federal\ntaxing authorities could, so there are many situations\nwhere the property is exempt from reach, even where the\nState doesn't call it property, calls it something else,\nbut the elements of what the person had leads the Federal\nauthorities to say this is the property of so-and-so, as\nin the Spendthrift Trust, as in the case of the\ndisclaiming heir in Drye, so why is this any different?\nMR. SUTTON: This is not a disclaimer or\nexemption case for this basic reason. We're not relying\non the results under Michigan law. We're relying on the\nrationale under Michigan law for the exemption. The\nrationale under Michigan law is that neither spouse owns\nan independent interest in any respect. Not even the\nsurvivorship right under Sanford is considered an\nindependent interest.\nQUESTION: Why was that different from a State\nlaw that said Mr. Drye never had anything, we assume under\nour State's law that he predeceased his mother?\nMR. SUTTON: Your Honor, under Arkansas law in\nDrye, the opinion notes that he did have a right to\nalienate that interest once his wife died. That's exactly\nwhat -- that was the point of the decision. For 9 months,\nhe had a right of control over the property and it may be\nhelpful -- I want to make sure I'm answering your\nquestion -- to think about these interests in present\nterms and future terms, and if you talk about present\ninterest, I think the way Drye talks about it is, you have\nto have a present interest of pecuniary value over which\nthe taxpayer has exclusive dominion. That is not true in\na tenancy by the entirety. The closest you can come to\nfinding something over which the individual taxpayer might\nhave dominion of control are the future interests, the\nright to proceeds, the right -- survivorship rights if you\noutlive your spouse.\nQUESTION: Could the Congress with ease enact a\nstatutory amendment to make tenants by the entirety\nsubject to liens?\nMR. SUTTON: Absolutely, Your Honor. I would\nsubmit that that's one of the strongest points supporting\nMrs. Craft's position. For 136 years --\nQUESTION: Well, I mean, if you were a Senator\nfrom Michigan wouldn't you say, well, you're taxing\nproperty that doesn't belong to the taxpayer, this is\nimproper as a matter of law?\nMR. SUTTON: That's exactly what Tyler\nrecognized, the 1936 or so U.S. Supreme Court decision\nthat yes, these are fictions under State law but, under\nthe Supremacy Clause, the Federal Government is entitled\nto disregard them if it wishes and, notably in the estate\ntax setting, that's an estate tax case, the Court -- in\nthat law, Congress specifically said tenancies by the\nentirety are covered by the estate tax. Indeed, page 502\nof Tyler says, but for the specification of tenancies by\nthe entirety by terms, the estate tax would not cover\nthose interests.\nQUESTION: Well, our --\nMR. SUTTON: That's our case. That's this case.\nQUESTION: Our universe here is that the State\ndefines what's property and the Federal Government defines\nwhat property can be liened.\nMR. SUTTON: Yes, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: That doesn't quite work, because one\nof the sticks in the property definition is the right to\nbe liened, and so we're compromising that dichotomy even\nby stating it, and it seems to me that all the Government\nis doing here is saying, we're saying what property can be\nliened, we're entitled to define that one stick in the\nbundle.\nMR. SUTTON: I'm not relying, Your Honor, on\nwhat's lienable and what's not. Well, I am in terms of\nthe common law background. That's highly relevant that in\n1866 no one would have thought this was a lienable\nproperty interest, but when it comes to the present\nMichigan law, I'm not relying on whether it's lienable\nunder Michigan law. I'm relying on why that's true, the\nrationale for why it's not lienable.\nYou can't lien -- maybe this is the better way\nto put it. You can't lien an innocent property owner's\nproperty. If everything they're saying is true about this\nsomehow belonging to Don Craft, it is most assuredly also\ntrue that it belonged to Sandy Craft, and Justice\nGinsburg, she did file her tax returns, independent tax\nreturns. She paid her taxes, and there's no more right\nfor the Federal Government to put that lien on your\nproperty or mine, that it was --\nQUESTION: Well, but if you're right about that,\nMr. Sutton, then your statement that Congress could easily\namend the statute to collect in this situation probably\nisn't correct.\nMR. SUTTON: Well, Your Honor, I did not mean to\nsay -- I did say easily, and I misspoke, and I'm glad to\nhave an opportunity to correct.\nI think it would be very difficult, because of\nthe fact that under Michigan law the property ownership\ninterest might create a situation where the minute you\nforeclosed, great, you got $100,000 for Don's interest in\nthe property. Every dollar they took belongs to Sandy, so\nit's -- it is a difficult area to regulate. It would be\na -- and -- but that's again exactly why, in gift tax,\nestate tax, fair debt collection -- that's the Federal\nfraudulent conveyance law, bankruptcy, every one of these\nareas not only mentions the tenancy specifically, but it\nthen goes on to do what Justice Kennedy and Mr. Chief\nJustice Rehnquist's questions indicate. You've got to be\nvery specific about how in the world you value these\ninterests, and what you decide to do once you've decided\nto regulate them.\nQUESTION: Mr. Sutton, is it true that any\nconventional property interest in Michigan can be held in\nthe entirety form?\nMR. SUTTON: No, Your Honor. Personal\nproperty -- it does not apply to personal property. The\nonly exceptions are proceeds from real estate, the example\nI gave when you sell the house.\nQUESTION: Does --\nQUESTION: What about -- bank accounts can't\nbe --\nMR. SUTTON: No, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: And shares can't be --\nMR. SUTTON: No, Your Honor. No.\nQUESTION: What about the income from the real\nestate? Is it your position that before this statute was\npassed even the income from the real estate was held --\nMR. SUTTON: Absolutely, and that's --\nQUESTION: -- in tenancy by the entirety?\nMR. SUTTON: Let me give you -- S&B Trust, it's\none of the cases we've cited, says that very point, and\nthat makes sense. It's still property that they -- it\ncame from their joint marital asset, and they use it\ntogether.\nI want to go --\nQUESTION: How does it differ from community\nproperty?\nMR. SUTTON: Community property has several\ndifferences. It's much more like a joint tenancy. First\nof all, you can petition, which incidentally is exactly\nwhat the effect of this statute is, to by law petition\ntheir interests. Secondly, you have shares in the\nproperty, and this is exactly like Rodgers and National\nBank of Commerce. There were divisible shares that could\nbe levied.\nQUESTION: I thought the community property is\nowned by the community, which is a separate entity.\nMR. SUTTON: No, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Community property is not owned by a\ncommunity which is a separate entity?\nMR. SUTTON: No. It really works a lot like the\nhomestead. I want to be clear here. It's true that the --\nin one sense the home in a community property State or a\nhomestead State is still one where they both have\ninterests as to all the property, so in that respect\nyou're right, they still have joint interests. But the\ncritical legal distinction respecting the 19th Century all\nthe way to this century is that in one setting you had\ndivisible shares, and that's why one spouse in a home\nState setting, community property setting, could\nunilaterally incumber or destroy the tenancy.\nQUESTION: I'm not sure you can generalize as to\ncommunity property. I think the law varied in -- among --\nbetween the community property States. Some would say one\nthing, some would say the other.\nMR. SUTTON: Your Honor, you're right, and if\nI --\nQUESTION: The hornbook that we looked up just\nsays that community property can be severed only with the\nconsent of both spouses in the event of divorce, or in the\nevent of death of one of the spouses. It's a book called\nReal Property, by Bernhardt and Burkhardt.\nMR. SUTTON: Well --\nQUESTION: Again, I don't know that that's\nauthoritative, or maybe we made a mistake, but it\ncertainly was my impression that community property is\nowned by a community, which is a different legal entity,\nand I also thought that community property couldn't be\nseparate without the consent of the spouse.\nMR. SUTTON: Well, that -- Your Honor --\nQUESTION: Is that wrong?\nMR. SUTTON: -- if -- let's assume for the sake\nof argument, and I'm not -- let's assume it's true, you\nsaid it's true, that community property States are just\nlike tenancy-in-the-entirety States. That's fine by us.\nQUESTION: Well, I know, but all it means is --\nMR. SUTTON: The exact same argument applies.\nQUESTION: -- that if you're right, that in\nprobably a third or more of the country, suddenly the IRS\ncan't assert any liens, and it's a little tough to believe\nthat Congress would have thought that that's what it was\ndoing with this statute.\nMR. SUTTON: Oh, Your Honor, I respectfully\ndisagree. In the very -- the backyard of Congress they\nare saying tenancies by the entirety are exempt. I mean,\nin the District of Columbia, which Congress has sovereign\nprerogatives over, they've said from the beginning that we\nfavor these marital community property interests over\nthose of creditors.\nQUESTION: Mr. Sutton --\nQUESTION: Yes, that may be, but why -- I mean,\nhere, a lot of property in this country is owned by\ncommunities, i.e., the husband and wife together, and I\nimagine that people are quite free to take their real\nproperty in the form of tenancy by the entirety.\nAll right, now here the property interest is\ndefinite. There's no doubt that the husband is entitled\nto a lot of money, and there's nothing imprecise about it,\nnor is there really anything speculative about it, unless\nyou go and divide it into a present and future. All those\ndivisions you've made are purely legal ways of looking at\nwhat in reality is an absolutely precise and valuable\nproperty interest owned by the husband.\nAll right, now why should I accept an\ninterpretation that's going to exempt vast amounts of\nproperty from this statute --\nMR. SUTTON: A couple of thoughts, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: -- under those circumstances?\nMR. SUTTON: This is not a community property\ncase, and I think it would be dangerous for me to --\nQUESTION: But I'd like to know what the\nimplications are --\nMR. SUTTON: If --\nQUESTION: -- because it's one thing if we're\ndeciding a case -- yes.\nMR. SUTTON: If you find, in each of the States\nthat you're concerned about, the interests are defined\njust as they are in Michigan, which is to say, it's an\nindivisible interest, no shares, it follows just from what\nyou've said in Rodgers and National Bank of Commerce that\nyou can't lien the property, and what you've got to do is\nwait for a survivorship interest, wait for a sale,\ndestruction of the tenancy.\nBut if there's a problem here, Your Honor,\nCongress has known about it. This has been true for 136\nyears.\nQUESTION: Mr. Sutton, how many States are there\nthat have tenancies by the entireties?\nMR. SUTTON: 14 that have them in the\ntraditional way we're talking about, where it's an\nindivisibility of title, plus the District of Columbia.\nQUESTION: And some of them, at least according\nto a case that both of you cited, do provide tenancy.\nTenancies by the entirety can hold business assets,\npersonal property, even money may be held in some States,\nso if your theory holds, then a couple could insulate\neverything that they have simply by holding it all --\nMR. SUTTON: Well, to the extent Congress is\nworried about that, it's surprising in 1954 that they\ndidn't amend the statutes, even more surprising --\nQUESTION: Well, didn't this Court comment on\nthat in the Rodgers decision by saying that the fact that\nCongress didn't do something -- you can't infer much from\nnot doing, according to this Court. Maybe the Senate\nrejected the clarification that the House sought, not\nbecause it disagreed with it, but more likely because it\nfound it superfluous.\nMR. SUTTON: The 1954 history is relevant, I\nwould think all would agree, when it comes to the notion\nthat somehow this is a great tax-avoidance problem.\nCongress at a minimum was told about this issue and\ndecided not specifically to do anything about it. Whether\nthe law was changed or not --\nQUESTION: And this Court commented on it, that\nmaybe Congress didn't do anything because it thought that\nthe -- this --\nMR. SUTTON: Your Honor, by 1966 -- I mean --\nwell, by the present, we've got seven courts of appeals.\nEvery court of appeal that's looked at the issue has said\nthe tax lien does not apply when just one spouse has a tax\ndebt. In 1990, critically --\nQUESTION: In this particular case, wasn't the\nSixth Circuit saying, well, maybe there are good arguments\non both sides, but we've got that old precedent that we\nhave to follow. Wasn't that the background of this case?\nMR. SUTTON: I'm not sure what the Sixth Circuit\nhad in mind, but it certainly followed its precedent,\ndidn't think Drye, Irvine had changed the law\nnecessarily --\nQUESTION: Well, it couldn't have thought about\nDrye the first time around, because Drye wasn't there.\nMR. SUTTON: No, but the second time it did.\nQUESTION: They had already made the decision.\nThen there was a big discussion about law of the case and\nlaw of the circuit, so I don't think that they ever had\nthis case with Drye squarely in front of them, because\nthey decided the basic case without Drye and later they\nwere relying on law of the case, law --\nMR. SUTTON: Well, I certainly don't know why\neach court of appeals has done what it did, including the\nSixth Circuit, but the fact is, they've all done the same\nthing.\nI think it's also notable to the extent there's\na tax avoidance concern lurking here, why is it in 1990,\nwhen Congress passed the Fair Debt Collection Act --\nthat's the Federal fraudulent conveyance statute -- why\ndid it specifically exempt tenancy by the entirety\nproperty? Under that law today you could do exactly what\nhappened in this case and the Federal Government would\nhave nothing to say about it.\nQUESTION: I suppose, if you follow the -- your\nrationale to its furthest extent in a State such as the\none Justice Ginsburg referred to in which business assets\ncan be held in tenancy by the entirety, a husband and wife\ncould hold a -- have a closely held corporation by the\nentirety and, on your theory, they wouldn't even be liable\nfor income tax because it would be the entirety alone that\nwould be liable. Is that the --\nMR. SUTTON: No. No, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: -- fair consequence of what you're\nsaying?\nMR. SUTTON: Under section 61, which is the\nprovision of the Internal Revenue Code that taxes\nproperty, income from tenancy by the entirety property is\nstill taxed. It's never been a --\nQUESTION: No, but the income goes into a bank\naccount held by the -- held in entirety form. If they're\ncareful enough, so that they set up their corporation,\ntheir savings account, their checking account,\neverything's held in entirety form, there wouldn't be any\nindividual taxpayers under your theory.\nMR. SUTTON: Well, I'm not going to be in a\nposition to cite any cases for this point, the point that\nI'm going to make, so you're going to want to check me on\nit, but I don't think there's any doubt that when it comes\nto income from tenancies-by-the-entirety property, the\ncase law, the code, the regulations make it clear that\nthey're still -- you're still taxable. It's just a\nquestion of --\nQUESTION: Well, I don't think there's any\ndoubt, either, but I think the fact that there isn't any\nserious doubt about it is, at least so far as the States\nthat Justice Ginsburg's example referred to, there also is\nan inconsistency between the fact that we have no doubt,\nas you say, about taxability and the consequences of your\ntheory.\nMR. SUTTON: Well,it's a -- they're very\ndifferent concepts and maybe it's important, particularly\nin light of Justice Breyer's comment about this just\nseeming to be a fiction, there's a real function behind\nthis concept, and the function is that, while the tenancy\nis premised on this nice notion of two hearts beating as\none, the fact is that doesn't always happen, and the whole\npoint of the tenancy and the indivisibility of title is\nthat it precludes one spouse unilaterally from destroying\nor otherwise incumbering the tenancy.\nKeep in mind, that's exactly what happened in\nthis case.\nQUESTION: Well, but the --\nQUESTION: Then in your mind the critical factor\nis the factor that creditors under State law can't get a\nhold of it.\nMR. SUTTON: No, Your Honor. If it's\nindivisibly owned, that means that every lien on Don's\ninterest was a lien on Sandy's interest, and Sandy paid\nher taxes. If there's one first principle of lien law,\nit's that --\nQUESTION: Okay. Then you're saying it's the\ntheory of the thing.\nMR. SUTTON: It's --\nQUESTION: Okay. If it's the theory of the\nthing --\nMR. SUTTON: It's a theory that has a fact --\nQUESTION: If it's the theory of the thing,\nprimarily, plus the fact -- all right. If it's the theory\nof it, why --\nQUESTION: Go ahead.\nQUESTION: If it's the theory of it, doesn't the\nsame theory exist with community property? Doesn't the\nsame theory exist with joint tenancies? For all I know,\nthe same theory exists when people said, you don't own any\nland, you just hold it from the king, and you have feudal\nobligations unless you pass along the seasons. I mean,\nthat's -- if we're going on the theory of the thing --\nMR. SUTTON: I really hope I can clarify this\nbecause I do think it cuts the heart of this case. Most\nStates that don't have tenancies by the entirety do have\njoint tenancy, so that really is the key comparison, and\nas to those States, when you have a joint tenancy, first\nof all they are divisible interests.\nIf they're divisible interests, that means one\nspouse unilaterally can incumber and in some instances\nsell that right, whether it's a future right, the right of\nsurvivorship, or a present right with respect to some\ninterest in the property, so that's the whole point. The\nwhole point is, in those States people have decided to\nmarry, buy property together, but yet from the beginning\none spouse unilaterally could destroy or incumber the\nproperty.\nIn a tenancy by the entirety, at the outset,\nevery decision you make regarding that property has to be\nmade with the consent of your spouse.\nQUESTION: Well, is the question of taxability\nat bottom a question of Federal law, do you suppose?\nMR. SUTTON: I would submit, Your Honor, that\nwhen it comes to the tax lien statute the Court has said\nseveral times that Congress did not define the words,\nproperty, rights to property belonging to. We look first\nto State law --\nQUESTION: But is it a question of Federal law,\nand as a policy matter we generally look to State law?\nBut isn't that itself a question of Federal law, the\nextent to which we're going to look to State law?\nMR. SUTTON: Well, Your Honor, I had thought\nthat you take the State law's property interests as you\nfind them in the 50 or 51 jurisdictions, depending on how\nyou want to look at it, and then, depending how the\nStates --\nQUESTION: But for tax purposes, I'm just\nwondering if at bottom it isn't, in fact, a question of\nFederal law.\nMR. SUTTON: It is a question of Federal law\nwhat the, quote, consequences of those State law\ndefinitions are, but let me give you, I think, a good\nindication of this, and it relates to a hard issue raised\nby Justice Ginsburg. What about tenancy by the entirety\nwhere it was a joint bank account, which is clearly a much\nharder case, not presented here. Here, we're talking\nabout the marital home.\nBut in National Bank of Rodgers, which was about\na joint tenancy, the Court said in a 5-4 decision that you\ncould levy on one person's joint bank account. Why was\nthat? Because under State law, the taxpayer, or he had a\nright to all of the money in the account unilaterally,\nwhenever he wanted it, and if he misused it, that was\nsimply to be a fight among the other joint tenants.\nJustice Blackmun in writing that decision made\nit crystal clear that that case turned on the fact that\nunder State law the taxpayer had a unilateral right to\ntake all the proceeds. If that State law had said\ndifferently, that the only way you can take out the\nproceeds is with the consent of the spouse, there's --\nQUESTION: Which case are we talking about now?\nMR. SUTTON: National Bank of Commerce, 1985,\njoint bank account. If that State law had said, the only\nway you can take out the money in the bank account is with\nthe consent of the other, the Court, by the terms of its\ndecision, would not have allowed that levy, and remember,\nthe levy and lien statutes have the exact same language,\nwhich, you know, in order to lien something you've got to\nbe able to levy it, generally speaking.\nSo I don't -- that proves to me -- I hope this\nanswers your question, Justice O'Connor -- that these\ndefinitions of State law do matter. They are controlling\nwhen it comes to the consequences, and I hope I've showed,\nwhen it comes to --\nQUESTION: Mr. Sutton, I think that there was\nconsiderable attention in the Drye case to exactly what it\nwas you look to State law for. You look to State law to\nfind out what the person had. Whether that was\ncharacterized as property or not was a Federal law\nquestion, and Drye could not have been clearer that you\nlook to see what sticks the State law gives.\nMR. SUTTON: But Your Honor, what have I said\nthat makes you think I'm disagreeing with that?\nQUESTION: Well, I thought you said that whether\nit's property is determined by State law.\nMR. SUTTON: I'm simply saying the interests in\nthe property are determined by State law.\nQUESTION: What the taxpayer had is determined\nby State law.\nMR. SUTTON: Exactly.\nQUESTION: But not the label that we put on it.\nMR. SUTTON: Absolutely.\nQUESTION: For Federal tax purposes.\nMR. SUTTON: Absolutely, and I'm sorry if I left\nthat ambiguous. I mean, let's talk about this in terms of\nthe classic --\nQUESTION: Your point there is right there.\nYour point is, I take it, that in this case State law\ndefines the property such that it belongs to both parties\nand, indeed, it is not possible under State law without\nthe death, divorce, or consent of one of the parties for\nanyone to get a hold of a penny of the -- of that\ninterest.\nMR. SUTTON: Absolutely, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: That's your point --\nMR. SUTTON: To use the sticks --\nQUESTION: -- that both of those things have to\nbe true, the theory and the practice.\nMR. SUTTON: Yes.\nQUESTION: All right.\nMR. SUTTON: To use the sticks in the bundle\nanalogy, every interest under State law in Michigan\nregarding this tenancy, each stick has to be exercised two\nby two, not one by one, but every one of them is two by\ntwo, husband and wife, and certainly not three by three,\nwhich is what the Federal Government is saying here.\nQUESTION: But it is for the Federal Government\nto determine to what property the lien extends.\nMR. SUTTON: I couldn't agree more, Your Honor.\nI mean, not -- I wouldn't say the executive branch. I\nmean, in the 1971 Benson decision they admitted that the\nlien does not cover tenancy by the entirety. If you look\nat that 1971 decision, they admitted in that case it\ndoesn't cover it, so this is not an administrative\ndeference situation at all, but the Federal Government,\nthrough Congress and the President, does have a right to\nextend it. I will admit, it's not going to be easy, and\nif we could go back to thinking about --\nQUESTION: Their point to the contrary is\nbasically, you're right, or assuming you're right, it's\nstill definite enough to get at, and you really violate\nState law policy there only if you sell the property, you\nsee, but as long as -- and, indeed, if they sell it on\ntheir own, that's their problem. You'll get the proceeds.\nIf they don't sell it on their own, you know, the\ncommunity -- if they don't sell it on their own, then it\nbecomes a question of how the judge will enforce the lien,\nand there your clients or the equivalent would be free to\ngo in and say, don't force me to sell the property, et\ncetera.\nMR. SUTTON: I hope I'm responding to your\nquestion. I think what I hear you saying is that boy,\nthis is just a lien, they're just placeholders, it doesn't\nmean they'll necessarily foreclose, and therefore Sandy's\ninterests really aren't being hurt. I would submit that's\nwrong. Sandy Craft --\nQUESTION: You say Sandy. She's noted as the\nrespondent as Sandra.\nMR. SUTTON: Excuse me, Your Honor. I'll say\nMrs. Craft, to be even more careful. Excuse me.\nBut in this particular case, the lien does have\nan impact on their ability collectively to make decisions\nabout the property. Let's say the month after the lien\nattached, they decided, we need to borrow against the\nhouse to have enough money to pay for our kids' college\neducation, because the roof has collapsed. They can't do\nthat.\nPrior to the lien, she had a right to make a\ndecision not with the Federal Government about how to use\nthis property, but with her husband, and a classic tenet\nof lien law is you get no more lien rights than the debtor\nhad, and you've got a situation here where they're 1)\ntrying to act as a spouse, but 2) dictating how this\nproperty ought to be used, when that was a decision that\nunder Michigan law only the two spouses could make\ntogether.\nI want to go back to a point that I went over a\nlittle bit too quickly. The consequence --\nQUESTION: I'd just like to ask you one question\nabout Michigan law in origin, because you said this goes\nback to 1866, so it was probably before the Married\nWomen's Property Act, so -- at least in some States it\nwas, so whatever rights there were to control and make\ndecisions, they were all in the husband at that time.\nMR. SUTTON: Most of the Married Women's\nProperty Acts, almost all of them were passed before 1866,\nso first of all that defect, I would call it, in the old\ntenancy simply was no longer true, and even in some States\nwhere that continued, it was still this, I guess it's jure\nuxoris concept, that it wasn't the husband as an\nindividual having an opportunity to do this, it was the\nhusband acting on behalf of the wife, but that just isn't\ntrue under Michigan law. They still have these equal\ninterests in the property, as proved by the fact of what\nhappens on a divorce.\nThe point I glossed over and I wanted to make\nsure was understood, the issue here is not just whether\nthe lien attaches to the tenancy, I would submit that\nunder Michigan law, if a lien does attach, it destroys the\ntenancy, so we have a situation where a unilateral act of\none spouse has destroyed the tenancy by operation of law\nunder Michigan.\nIt becomes a tenancy in common that destroys the\nright of survivorship, and that also means because there\nare now divisible interests in the property that one\nspouse, unilaterally again, can incumber the property and\nexpose the marital home to these debts of just one spouse,\nso this is not just a modest question then.\nQUESTION: But --\nQUESTION: I thought, Mr. Sutton, this is a\nquestion of what the Federal taxing authority can do.\nEverything that you've been speaking about is something\nthat Michigan can say, no creditor of these people --\nMR. SUTTON: Your Honor, I agree with you,\nMichigan could change the law, though I think at that\npoint the rationale and the effect would line up.\nQUESTION: I don't think there's any question\nthat Michigan law, just as Arkansas law, continues to say,\ncreditors, you can't get at this disclaimed property, same\nthing Michigan can say. The only thing that Michigan\ncan't control if this decision should go the other way is\nwhat the Federal taxing authorities can do, not one thing\nabout any other creditor under Michigan law.\nMR. SUTTON: The problem for people like the\nCrafts is that they've already said it. In Budwit v. Herr\nthey say, the minute you destroy the unity of ownership\nyou destroy the tenancy, so I --\nQUESTION: Isn't the concern that the tenancy\nnot be destroyed, in effect as a result of a consensual\nact by one of the spouses, an alienation by a spouse\nalone --\nMR. SUTTON: The nonconsensual act, right.\nQUESTION: -- the incurring of debt by one\nspouse alone as a consensual act, i.e., going on a\nspending spree?\nBut here, the consensual act of the spouse has\nnothing to do with it. It's not a consensual act of the\nspouse that the spouse has to pay income act --\nMR. SUTTON: Oh, but Your Honor, it is.\nQUESTION: -- and therefore it seems to me\noutside the rationale that you're proposing for the\ntenancy.\nMR. SUTTON: I respectfully disagree, Your\nHonor. It's exactly the rationale. There's no difference\nfrom Mr. Craft unilaterally trying to incumber the\nproperty with his own loan, using the property as a\nmortgage to back it up.\nQUESTION: Sure it is. He goes out and says, I\nwant a loan to buy a Cadillac. That's certainly a fair\nconcern of the State in protecting the wife. That concern\ndoesn't extend to a situation in which the tax law of the\nUnited States says, you're going to pay tax on your income\nwhether you like it or not.\nMR. SUTTON: But Your Honor, it's a unilateral\nact, number 1, by the spouse, and number 2, it is a lot\nlike a loan.\nQUESTION: What's a unilateral act, earning the\nmoney?\nMR. SUTTON: It is a lot like a loan, Your\nHonor. If you need $50,000 a month to support some bad\nhabit, you can get it by borrowing from a bank or not\npaying your taxes. It has the exact same effect when it\ncomes to the unilateral conduct of one spouse undermining\nthe marital property. But again --\nQUESTION: And then, if Congress said this\nexplicitly, the same thing would follow, everything that\nyou said. Congress would then be destroying --\nMR. SUTTON: They could do what they did in the\nestate tax, which is regulate it specifically. I would\nsubmit, it is not an easy process.\nQUESTION: I thought that the -- oh.\nMR. SUTTON: Why doesn't Mrs. Craft have a\ntakings argument the minute this lien attaches for the\nentire value of her property? Why is that not the case?\nIt's not obvious to me.\nQUESTION: Just as Mr. Drye didn't when his\nState law said --\nMR. SUTTON: But there was only one taxpayer in\nDrye. You didn't allow a lien -- excuse me.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Sutton.\nMR. SUTTON: Thank you, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Mr. Jones, you have 3 minutes\nremaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF KENT L. JONES\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. JONES: Thank you. I have only a couple of\npoints. The first one is that the tenancy involved in\nthis case was destroyed when it was transferred from the\nhusband to the spouse. That's one. That's the first\ninstance when it was destroyed, and secondly it was\ndestroyed when the wife then sold it to a third party.\nWhat we have are proceeds that are not subject\nto a tenancy by the entirety. We have proceeds that\nare -- to which the former tenants are each entitled to 50\npercent. The right, their right to have 50 percent of the\nproceeds is confirmed by 577.71 of the Michigan Code,\nwhich was enacted in 1975, but it preexisted that as we\npointed out in the cases that we've cited in our reply\nbrief.\nI will say that the suggestion that this statute\nthat gives each spouse an equal right in the property only\napplies to tenancies created after 1975 is a new\ncontention. It's not addressed in the briefs. It catches\nus by surprise, but I will point out that the Dow case --\nQUESTION: It shouldn't be a surprise if it's in\nthe statute you're quoting to us.\nMR. JONES: What I will -- what is in the\nstatute that I --\nQUESTION: Is it in the statute?\nMR. JONES: What I have in my possession is a\ncopy that says that the effective date is 1975, and I do\nknow that in Dow v. State, decided by the supreme court of\nMichigan in 1976, they applied that statute to a tenancy\nthat had been created prior to 1965. This statute that\nwas enacted in 1975 reflects a policy of, I suspect, every\nState in the modern era to recognize the equal rights of\nthe spouses and the tenants in the property, and not to\nrespect --\nQUESTION: Suppose it didn't. I mean, is it\nyour -- are you conceding, then, that the Government\ncannot assert a lien on a real tenancy by the entirety?\nMR. JONES: No, not at all. I'm saying that we\nhave such a lien in this case, both from the right of\nsurvivorship, if we ever had to get there, but more\nimportantly because we have a lien in the right to receive\nproceeds. This statute that was enacted in '75 does not\ndirectly address the proceeds issue. The proceeds right\npreexisted the statute. What the statute addressed was\nthe equal right to income during the existence of the\ntenancy by the entirety, and the equal right to control\nthe management.\nQUESTION: Mr. Jones, can I ask you one\nquestion? I hate to take up your reply time. In your\nview, will the decision in this case control in community\nproperty States, raising the same question?\nMR. JONES: Well, I think the principles that\nyou apply will, of course, control, and --\nQUESTION: Yes, but --\nMR. JONES: And whether a decision in this case\naddressed principles that would extend or apply in that\nsituation as well as this, I can't say. I --\nQUESTION: Can -- do they -- in a community\nproperty State, can one spouse force division over -- to\nan unwilling spouse?\nMR. JONES: Under State law there are\nlimitations, but those State law limitations have already\nbeen held to be ineffective against Federal tax\nprovisions.\nQUESTION: But the community property is subject\nto the debts incurred during the marriage?\nMR. JONES: That's correct and, again, in the\nMitchell case the Court held that State law fictions about\nthe relative rights in community property States are no\nmore binding on the Federal tax collector than in other\ncontexts.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr. Jones.\n"
