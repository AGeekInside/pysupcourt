FEIGIN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. FEIGIN: Yes, Your Honor, thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you.\nMR. FEIGIN: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nThe court of appeals' practice of\nautomatically granting appellate relief for every\nviolation of Rule 11(c)(1), irrespective whether it\nprejudiced the defendant, is flawed. As this Court\nrecognized in United States v. Vaughn, Rule 11(h) was\nadopted for the precise purpose of ending the\nthen-common practice of automatically reversing even for\nnon-prejudicial Rule 11 errors.\nIt would be especially inappropriate to\napply an automatic reversal rule in a case like this one\nthat comes to the appellate courts in a plain error\nposture.\nErroneous judicial participation -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: May -- may I ask you a\nquestion about that? It's plain error because the\ndefendant didn't make an objection in the lower court.\nBut the defendant doesn't know about Rule 11 and doesn't\nknow about 11(c) that says a judge is not supposed to\nparticipate in plea bargaining, and his lawyer doesn't\ntell him the judge is doing something wrong because his\nlawyer wants him to plea. So he lacks the information\nnecessary to make a prompt objection.\nSo it seems a bit unfair to say that he's\nsubjected to plain error when he hasn't got a clue that\nthe judge, magistrate wasn't supposed to do what he did.\nMR. FEIGIN: Well, first of all, Your Honor,\nI'd respectfully disagree with the notion that just\nbecause Respondent's counsel was advising him to plead\nguilty, that Respondent's counsel had so advocated -- so\nabdicated his representation that he couldn't be\nexpected to object to an error that the judge made.\nI'd also point out that if the Court were to\ncreate an exception to the plain error doctrine, this\nwould be a particularly inappropriate case in which to\ndo it because not only was there not a contemporaneous\nobjection, there wasn't an objection before the district\njudge in the months and proceedings that followed.\nThey didn't raise any claim of error on\nappeal until the court of appeals raised it. And in\nfact, in this case, Respondent did file a motion in the\ndistrict court to withdraw his plea. And he didn't\nmention the magistrate's comments or any pressure he\nfelt from those comments at all.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, suppose you just\nstick with Justice Ginsburg's hypothetical, or perhaps\nnot even a hypothetical, what happened in this case.\nJust assume that the defense attorney likes this\njudicial intervention and he -- he wants this to take\nplace. It -- it seems quite unfair to talk about the\nplain error, because he doesn't tell -- as Justice\nGinsburg says, what does the defendant know about Rule\n11(c)? He doesn't know about it.\nMR. FEIGIN: Well, Your Honor, if Respondent\nwants to make an ineffective assistance of counsel claim\non collateral review, he can make that. But I'm not\naware of any court of appeals that has abandoned the\nplain error doctrine in this kind of case and I don't\nthink there should be any sort of special exception that\nsays when -- that we assume when counsel is advising his\nclient to plead guilty, that we can't expect counsel to\nmake objections to errors that occur based on the\njudge's comments.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It doesn't really\nmatter -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But this is a lawyer that\nhad filed an Anders brief. So he didn't -- even at that\nstage, the lawyer, the -- I don't want to absorb your\ntime beyond this, but I think the plain error is\nquestionable when it seems that the judge, the lawyer,\nthey arranged against the -- the defendant, and the\ndefendant doesn't know that he has this route.\nMR. FEIGIN: Well, Your Honor, let me just\nsay one other word about that. I don't think it's going\nto be easy for courts of appeals to tell exactly why the\nlawyer may not have made an objection, and I just don't\nthink it's fair to assume that in every Rule 11(c)(1)\ncase that the lawyer is effectively acting at contrary\npurposes to his client.\nI mean, lawyers advise clients to plead\nguilty all the time and that doesn't mean that they've\nabandoned the representation to the point where you\ncan't assume they're acting on the client's behalf and\nwill raise objections. But our basic point in this -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Excuse me. Does this\nissue go -- it doesn't go to whether you should apply\nthe prejudice prong, because either under normal\nharmless error or plain error you have to get to whether\nit prejudices someone.\nMR. FEIGIN: That's exactly right, Justice\nSotomayor. That was exactly the next sentence that was\ngoing to come out of my mouth is that our basic point in\nthis case is that you have to apply prejudice analysis\nin some form, and whether it's harmless error or plain\nerror, the court of appeals refuses to do it. And we\nthink -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: One of the most powerful\narguments of your adversary is that in the most common\nof situations -- and it's how I read the advisory\nnotes -- it's going to be awfully difficult to say that\na judge's intervention hasn't influenced a defendant.\nThis is the unusual case where you might actually have a\nno prejudice argument because of the unique facts.\nBut there is a purpose for keeping judges\nout of this, and that's because the subtle influence\nthat judges exert is not so subtle. It's very palpable\nand does influence most decision making, both by lawyers\nand defendants.\nSo if that's the standard, why isn't it a\nrebuttable presumption that prejudice exists?\nMR. FEIGIN: Well -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It has to be an awfully\nhigh presumption, otherwise, you make mockery of the\nrule, in my mind.\nMR. FEIGIN: Well, first of all, Your Honor,\nI want to take issue with the notion that all Rule\n11(c)(1) errors are alike. There's actually a variety\nof different kinds of Rule 11(c)(1) errors.\nRule 11(c)(1) has been held to cover, for\nexample, a judge pressuring the government outside the\ndefendant's presence to offer a plea, a judge\ndiscouraging a plea, a judge commenting in a\nwell-intentioned manner about the obvious difference in\npotential sentencing consequences between a potential\nplea agreement and a trial, or a judge, having rejected\none plea agreement that the parties reached, indicating\na bit too strongly what kind of plea agreement the judge\nmight accept.\nI think adopting some sort of \"one size fits\nall\" rule would -- would be inappropriate, and the\nrebuttable presumption I think would also be\ninappropriate, for a few reasons.\nFirst of all, I don't think courts should\nhave to distinguish between different types of errors to\nsee whether a rebuttable presumption should apply.\nSecond of all -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, I don't disagree\nthat one doesn't' have to use the word \"rebuttable\npresumption,\" but there has to be a strong prejudice\nfactor -\nMR. FEIGIN: Well, Your Honor -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- whether rebuttable or\nnot, assumed in a judge's intervention.\nMR. FEIGIN: -- I think that's already built\ninto Rule 52 in a couple of different ways.\nFirst of all, Rule 52 places a presumption\nbased on whether or not the defendant objected. If the\ndefendant objected, the burden's on the government. If\nthe defendant didn't object, the burden is on the\ndefendant.\nBut also, I don't -- I want to be clear on\nthis: The type of error -- if there is a very serious\nerror, the nature of the error and the error's\nseriousness would of course be a factor, and a very\nimportant factor, in the prejudice analysis.\nBut, as Your Honor has recognized with this\ncase, there may be other circumstances that indicate\nthat the error did not in this case have a reasonable\nprobability of affecting the decision of the plea.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But that's the problem. Is\nthere a way of doing this, which I -- I don't see at the\nmoment? But the judge intervenes in a serious way and\nsays, you go listen to your lawyer and this is a very\nharsh penalty and, boy, you are into -- okay? A serious\nproblem.\nAnd now to track down whether that affected\nsubstantial rights, you have to try to track down the\nstate of mind of the defendant and would he have pled\nguilty anyway. And that's sometimes quite difficult to\ndo, very hard.\nBut if you don't insist on doing it, and you\nhave an absolute rule of structural error or something,\nthen you suddenly discover these minor things. The\njudge says, go to lunch, or -- or, you know, some really\ntrivial intervention, and you are going to say that -\nthe guilty plea, he can just void his guilty plea.\nSo there should be a way of distinguishing\nthe trivial from the -- from the really important in\nterms of how serious the intervention was, but I don't\nsee any way to do that. Have -- have you thought about\nthat at all? Do we have to go all the one way or all\nthe other way?\nMR. FEIGIN: I have thought about that a\nlittle bit, Your Honor, and I'd say that trying to break\nRule 11(c)(1) into different pieces and adopt different\nrules based on different kinds of error would be\ninappropriate, for three main reasons.\nThe first one is I think it would be\ninconsistent with this Court's position in Neder v. the\nUnited States, which makes clear that in deciding\nwhether an error is structural you have to look at the\nentire class of errors.\nAnd Rule 11(c)(1) defines the class of\nerrors as cases in which a judge participates in plea\nnegotiations in some way, and it doesn't define\nsubcategories.\nSecond, I think breaking this up into pieces\nwould essentially be an incomplete and unsatisfactory\nform of prejudice analysis. That is, reviewing courts\nwould still be looking at errors and differentiating\nbetween them in order to decide whether relief is\nwarranted, but they would be narrowly focused only on\nthe binary inquiry of how to categorize the error,\nthey'd be disregarding how serious that particular error\nwas versus other errors in that category, and they would\nbe disregarding all the other facts and circumstances\nthe courts always look at and are well familiar with how\nto look at in a normal prejudice analysis, to determine\nwhether the error affected the outcome.\nThird, particularly because the\nsubcategories don't exist in the rule and would be\nsomething of judicial invention, I think that approach\nwould be inherently inadministrable and manipulatable\nand lead to inconsistent results.\nIt could be very difficult to tell whether a\nparticular type of error should fall into one category\nor another, and under the approach you're suggesting,\nwhich I think is the approach Respondent is\nadvocating -- I don't think Respondent is actually\nadvocating the per se rule that the Eleventh Circuit\nadopted here -- I think under that approach, you know,\neverything turns on a narrow question of categorization.\nI think the much better approach, and the\napproach that Rule 52 adopts, is to look at all the\nfacts and circumstances to attempt to determine the\neffect on the outcome.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Feigin, is there any\nsituation in which a -- a judge participating in a plea\nbargaining, any situation that would be prejudicial,\nthat you recognize would be prejudicial, and if there is\ncan you describe what that would be?\nMR. FEIGIN: Certainly, Your Honor.\nWe -- the government loses many of these\ncases even in circuits that have prejudice analysis. In\nfact, one example the Court might want to look to, there\nwas a certiorari petition I think filed at the end of\nlast term, a case, 11-8966, Rebollo-Andino, which was a\ncase of Rule 11(c)(1) error. The government conceded\nthat even on a plain error analysis that that was\nprejudicial.\nI can describe -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What -- what makes it\nprejudicial and this not?\nMR. FEIGIN: Well, let me take -- let me\ntake a different example.\nThe Fourth Circuit's decision in United\nStates v. Bradley, the judge essentially told the\ndefendants that he -- it boggled his mind that they were\ngoing to trial and kept essentially harassing them about\nwhy they were going to trial. And, eventually, they\nsaid, all right, Your Honor, we are going to -- we're\ngoing to plead guilty. I mean, that kind of thing\nobviously is going to be prejudicial.\nBut the advantage of a prejudice approach is\nit allows you to separate that kind of case from kinds\nof cases when there are less serious errors, or even a\ncase where there is a fairly serious error -- and this\ncase may fall within that category -- but there are\nfacts and circumstances that indicate that the error\ndidn't have a reasonable probability of affecting the\ndefendant's decision to plead.\nAnd while we're not asking the Court to\nresolve the prejudice analysis here in the first\ninstance, we -- we're just asking the Court to remand\nthe case to the court of appeals to do that, I think\nit's just worth noting that -- a couple of the factors.\nOne is that -- there was a 3-month break between the\nmagistrate judge's comments and the entry of the plea,\nand a month into that a speedy trial motion was filed,\nwhich indicated at least some intent at that point to go\nto trial.\nThe plea and the sentencing occurred in\nfront of the district judge, not the magistrate judge\nwho made the comments.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: On that point, do we\nknow -- do we know if the district judge who did preside\nat the plea hearing knew about the episode with the\nmagistrate 3 months earlier?\nMR. FEIGIN: I don't -- I'm not aware of\nanything in the record that reflects whether he did or\ndid not. There's never been an allegation that -- that\nhe said something about them, or that he was aware of\nthem or -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The same for the\nprosecutor?\nMR. FEIGIN: Your Honor, my understanding is\nthe government was not aware of this because it occurred\nin an ex parte hearing in which the government wasn't in\nattendance. The government wasn't aware of it until the\nEleventh Circuit conducted its own review of the record\nand asked for further briefing on the issue.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Suppose there's a case where\nthe -- the defendant would not have pled guilty without\nthe court saying something inappropriate about it's a\ncase where the defendant would be crazy to go to trial\nbecause the trial would lead to a much more severe\nsentence. Would there be prejudice there?\nMR. FEIGIN: Yes, Your Honor. He has a\nright to go to trial if he wants to go to trial, even if\nit would be crazy. So under that circumstance, if he\nwouldn't have, you know, pleaded guilty without the\nerroneous comments from the judge, there would be\nprejudice.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: That's -- what happens\nunder -- under the rule if the magistrate asked that the\ndefendant be excused -- I don't know quite how you do\nthat; the defendant has to be present. But can the -\ncan the judge just have the attorneys before him and\nsay, now, I want you to be very, very clear that this is\na mandatory minimum, that we should try to avoid if at\nall possible.\nCan he do that?\nMR. FEIGIN: Well, Your Honor, I think\nthat's -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: It's awfully hard to have\na hypothetical where you exclude the defendant.\nMR. FEIGIN: Well, Your Honor, this actually\nhappened in a non-hypothetical fashion in a case we cite\nin our reply brief, called In re United States, in which\nthe judge was apparently unhappy with the Government's\nconduct in that case and had the prosecutor and defense\ncounsel in chambers, or at least in court, without the\ndefendant's presence, and was urging the parties to\nreach a plea agreement.\nI think if something like that happens, Your\nHonor, there'd be some question whether the defendant\nwas made aware of it, and whether it actually influenced\nthe defendant's decision to plead. I don't think there\ncan be a presumption that just because counsel heard it,\nthat necessarily -\nJUSTICE ALITO: What -- what if the judge\nsees what the judge thinks is ineffective assistance of\ncounsel under our decision in Lafler taking place? Is\nthere anything that can be done?\nMR. FEIGIN: So -- Your Honor, I think one\nof our main concerns in bringing this case before the\nCourt is the interaction of this Court's decisions in\nLafler and Frye with Rule 11(c)(1), and Frye suggests\nthat one way a judge can try to guard against a later\nclaim of ineffective assistance of counsel is to conduct\na colloquy with the defendant -- not a colloquy, but a\ndiscussion with the defendant -- during the initial\nproceedings to try to establish that he understands the\nconsequences of his plea and that he's receiving\neffective assistance of counsel.\nI think that could be done very carefully by\nasking very general questions, but I think it's very\neasy to see how a judge might slip up and say, oh,\nthat's an interesting offer. Did you discuss that with\nyour counsel? That seems like something you ought to\ndiscuss with your counsel.\nAnd I think what the automatic reversal rule\nthe court of appeals has adopted is it really puts\njudges, and, frankly, the government, in kind of a box.\nOn the one hand, judges have to guard against these\nlater ineffective assistance of counsel claims by\ndiscussing plea discussions, and on the other hand, any\nslipup in that discussion is going to lead to automatic\nreversal on appeal.\nNow, I -- I just want to add one -- one more\nthing, which is, I think, the best evidence that we have\nthat this -- the magistrate judge's comments here did\nnot create a reasonable probability of effecting the\ndefendant's decision to plead is, again, defendant\nhimself moved pro se to withdraw his plea in the\ndistrict court, and his reasons for withdrawing his\nplea, which start on page 58 of the Joint Appendix,\nnever mention the magistrate's comments. Instead, in\nhis own words, what he says is, \"Your Honor, my decision\nto enter the plea was a strategic decision.\nThe reason being is that I knew that the\nprosecutor had a duty with the courts to disclose the\ninformation relevant for this court's determination of\nthe acceptance or rejection of the plea.\"\nAnd what he means by that is that he took\nissue with some aspects of the allegations in the\nindictment, although he's quite clear, both in that\nproceeding and at his guilty plea proceeding, that he\ndid commit the conspiracy offense, and he just believed\nthat those allegations in the record would be cleaned up\nor have to be withdrawn by the prosecutor if he pleaded\nguilty.\nNow, he was wrong about that. But what we\nhave in this case is a clear unvarnished explanation by\nthe defendant in his own words about why he pleaded that\ndoesn't mention the magistrate's comments.\nThe Court of Appeals erred in disregarding\nthat.\nAnd if the Court has no more questions, I'll\nreserve the balance of my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Yablon?\nORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT M. YABLON\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. YABLON: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nBy imploring Anthony Davila to forego his\ntrial rights, confess his alleged crimes, and accept a\nplea deal, the magistrate judge abandoned his role as\nneutral arbiter and fundamentally distorted the pretrial\nprocess.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I -- I don't want to\ninterrupt your opening because I think -- I just didn't\nhear your first -- \"by foregoing\"?\nMR. YABLON: By foregoing -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: By foregoing.\nMR. YABLON: -- his trial rights.\nThis -- the right at issue in this case is\nnot one that should be subject to post hoc speculation.\nJudges, when an error of this kind occurs -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You're creating a sui\ngeneris structural error analysis. You're basically -\nbecause even with respect to constitutional violations\nthat we have found structural error in, we've created\nthe plain error rule that still requires a proof of\nprejudice. So you're asking us to create something\nthat's really sui generis in saying it's always a\nstructural error.\nMR. YABLON: That's -- that's not correct,\nYour Honor. First, let's put to one side the fact that\nwe do argue that we should not be in a plain error\nframework at all in this case because of the\ncircumstances in which the judge's improper intervention\noccurred.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Assume I accept that\nargument.\nMR. YABLON: So this Court has -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You're -- you're saying\nthis is a structural error always.\nMR. YABLON: And this Court has, at the very\nleast, strongly suggested that substantial rights when\nyou're dealing with a structural error are affected, per\nse, where they've left the door open to some additional\nanalysis is the fourth prong of the plain error standard\nwhere the Court is called upon to consider whether the\nerror affects the fairness, integrity, or public\nreputation of the proceedings.\nAnd the government has never, in this case,\ninvoked that fourth prong. They've never claimed that\nthe error here is one that -- that does not affect the\nthe fairness, integrity, or public reputation.\nSo when you're only dealing with the third\nprong of the plain error standard, does the error affect\nsubstantial rights, that language is the same in Rule\n52(b), the plain error standard, as it is in Rule 52(a),\naffects substantial rights, and if it means in Rule\n52(a) that this is the sort of error for which an\nindividualized prejudice inquiry is not appropriate,\nthen the same analysis necessarily carries over to Rule\n52(b).\nSo I would not say that this is at all the\nkind of sui generis example that -- that you're\nindicating.\nAnd I do want to -- to -- and try to show\nthat this error is quite similar, both to constitutional\nand nonconstitutional violations in with -- which this\nCourt has said that an error should be said to affect\nsubstantial rights without the sort of specific showing\nof prejudice that the government is demanding.\nWhen you have a judge that, as in this case,\nis stepping out of his proper role, is acting contrary\nto his duties to guard against ill-considered and\ninvoluntary waivers of the defendant's basic trial\nrights, is actually ratcheting up the already tremendous\npressure on the defendant to plead guilty, that is a\nsystematic distortion of the process. That is not\nunlike the kind of error that occurs when a defendant is\ndenied an impartial adjudicator. It is not unlike the\nkind of error that occurs when a defendant is denied\ncounsel or is forced to -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What -- what if you\nhave the situation where the judge is conveying purely\nfactual information? There's a -- a plea bargain on the\ntable for one year and the judge says, you should know\nthat I -- I have these cases a lot. The last ten cases\nthat went to trial where the defendant was found guilty,\nI sentenced them to a minimum of 12 years. Pure facts.\nThe facts might have the effect of pushing\nthe defendant one way or another, but it's also factual\ninformation of which he ought to be aware.\nMR. YABLON: That's right, Your Honor, and\nthis raises a question about what the scope of the\nparticipation prohibition actually is.\nAnd we're in a strange posture in this case\nbecause the government has conceded that we're dealing\nwith a conceded plain violation of the rule, and yet\ntheir analysis, instead of proceeding from that\nviolation, it goes out to the periphery and tries to\nfigure out where are the boundaries of Rule 11.\nNow -- and they cite some appellate cases\nthat arguably have applied too broad a construction of\nthe rule and have reversed where maybe there was just a\none-off comment or a purely informational comment, but\nit's not clear that that is actually what the text of\nRule 11 forbids, particularly when you consider the\ncontext of the rule and its underlying purposes. So -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, we do need to\nhave a good sense of how far your -- your per se\nstructural argument is going to reach before we\ndecide -- in deciding whether it's appropriate or not.\nMR. YABLON: That's right, Your Honor, and\nthere are -- there are two ways to break it down. One\nis we do argue that the remedy that we seek should apply\nfor all cases of judicial participation. And the\nquestion then is: Are judicial participation violations\nas expansive a category as the government suggests that\nthey are?\nOur second argument is that -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Well, on that, what's the\nmost minor thing that the government could do that would\nstill count as a Rule 11(c)(1) violation?\nMR. YABLON: The most minor thing that the\ngovernment could do or a judge could do?\nJUSTICE KAGAN: That the judge could do.\nI'm sorry.\nMR. YABLON: Well, the most minor -- we\nthink that Rule 11 is concerned with judicial pressure\nto plead guilty. And so the most -- I mean, a judge\nmight make a comment that, viewed from the transcript,\nwould suggest that the evidence against the defendant is\noverwhelming or that the defendant is likely to get a\nmuch lower sentence if he pleads guilty than if he goes\nto trial. Those we think are -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What -- what about\nthe hypothetical that I posed?\nMR. YABLON: So that hypothetical, if -- if\nwe were talking about a purely informational statement\nlike that, then, actually, we don't think that that is\nlikely to be a violation of Rule 11(c)(1). And the\nreason is, if you look at 11(b), the rule expects that\njudges are, in fact, going to be offering a lot of\nadvice to defendants before the defendant pleads guilty.\nAnd so if a judge is making the kinds of\ncomments that Rule 11(b) is contemplating, informing the\ndefendant about the nature of the charges against him,\nattempting to make sure that the defendant understands\nthat his trial right is a real one, telling the\ndefendant a little bit about what, in fact, the -- the\nsentencing exposure might be if he is convicted, those\npurely informational statements we don't think is what\nis meant to be prohibited by the rule.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So if he -- if it's\nmy example and he says, this is what I've done the past\nten times, so you ought to think long and hard about\nwhether a bargain for one year is a good deal.\nMR. YABLON: So -- and -- and this is\ngetting -- and then the judge may well be crossing the\nline. And what the judge -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's kind of a fine\nline to -- to draw, isn't it?\nMR. YABLON: There's no question that there\nwill be close cases. I would say that if you look to\nthe majority of cases that are actually out there, most\njudges, of course, are very scrupulous about following\nthe rule. And when a judge is not, the judge is not\nusually being circumspect about it, the judge is trying\nto get a message across to the defendant.\nAnd so there may be difficult line-drawing\ncases, and that's true whether you're looking at the\nremedial approach that we're asking for or the remedial\napproach that the Government's asking for.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Yablon, the -- the\ncase that you're presenting would be quite strong if the\nsame judge -- if the magistrate judge also presided at\nthe plea hearing, but here we have two factors that are\nspecial in this case. One is it's a different judge,\nand two is we have the interval of some three months in\nbetween. And then we have a plea hearing that looks to\nme like it's exemplary. The district judge did go\nthrough everything that Rule 11 calls for.\nSo it is a different case, isn't it, when we\nhave a plea hearing with a judge who is exerting no\npressure at all, has nothing to do with encouraging the\ndefendant to plead, but there was an earlier episode\nwhere a magistrate judge did overbear?\nMR. YABLON: And at no point during the plea\ncolloquy hearing is the district judge in any way\nacknowledging or disavowing the magistrate judge's\ncomments, which, we submit, there is at least a very\nstrong probability that those comments affected the\ndefendant's thinking and the reason that the defendant\nis at the Rule 11 hearing in the first place.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But -- but the -- but the\njudge did ask, do you recognize that your -- your\nconduct satisfied the elements of the conspiracy? And\nthe defendant answered yes. And the -- the judge asked,\nhas anyone pressured you to plead guilty? And he\nanswers no. So -\nMR. YABLON: And, of course, in that\nsituation, the defendant is likely not thinking about\npressure that may come from the judiciary itself. And\nalso, not to nitpick but when he's asking that pressure\nquestion he's asking whether anyone pressured him to\nplead guilty today, which may not cause the defendant to\nthink back on why he started down the negotiation road.\nI think an important -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Yablon, I agree with\nyou totally. I'm not as much convinced in the delay in\npleading because defendants often think about it and I\ncan imagine a hypothetical where the lawyer comes in and\nsays: I told him to plead guilty and he said to me: I\ndon't want to, but the judge told me to.\nSo I don't think the time limit -- we don't\nknow if that happened. But what did happen is that the\ndefendant made a motion to withdraw his plea and he\ndirectly said: \"I entered the plea because I\nstrategically decided that the government would\neventually have to come forward and vacate the charges\nagainst me.\" He said it himself with no pressure by a\nlawyer, because he was making the motion. How do you\nget past that statement?\nMR. YABLON: That statement reveals just how\nlittle confidence we actually should have in the plea\ndecision that he made. Here is a defendant who for the\nbetter part of a year was adamant about his desire to go\nto trial and exercise his rights. It's the reason that\nthe in camera hearing happened in the first place,\nbecause he was unhappy that the lawyer just wanted him\nto plead guilty. After that hearing, suddenly there are\nplea negotiations and a plea deal, which it's clear that\nhe is never happy about from the start.\nEven at the plea hearing, he is attempting\nto tell the judge: Look, I don't think that my conduct\nactually is consistent with the conspiracy charge as\nalleged. And he says later at the sentencing hearing\nwhen they are discussing the withdrawal motion that\nbasically he went forward because his lawyer was\ninstructing him that it was the right thing to do. And\nif you look at that sentencing -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But that is the whole\npoint, which is this may be IAC, but I don't know how -\nhow you prove that what the magistrate judge said to him\nled to his decision.\nMR. YABLON: And we don't need to prove\nthat.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's only if we don't\naccept that prejudice is a consideration here.\nMR. YABLON: Either way, if you were looking\nat whether this conduct should be viewed as inherently\nprejudicial the reason that you might do that is because\nyou might think that at least in all of these cases\nthere might at least be a reasonable probability that it\nwould affect where the defendant is. And here you have\na defendant who has been adamant that he's not going to\nplead, and when you have the judge making these comments\nin front of the defendant, having him lose confidence in\nhis right to go to trial, then it's likely that that is\nshifting the defendant's mind set in a way that gets him\nto the negotiating table. And it also reaffirms the\ndefense lawyer's position in this case.\nAnd so you have a defense lawyer who may\nthen go back to the prosecutor and say: We're just\ngoing to get this deal done, and it may not be the deal\nthat the defendant would otherwise have wanted reached.\nJUSTICE BREYER: You want us to basically\nnot apply the 11(h), the harmless error business, and\nyou basically want to prevent bizarre results by making\na tough definition of the word \"participate.\" That's\nhow I understand you. And maybe you are right, but it\nsounds to me as you say it in reading the briefs that\nthis is really a job for the rules committee.\nThis is a rule. We don't normally have\nstructural errors with respect to rules. We have rules\ncommittees there to listen to this kind of complaint, to\nweigh it in the system as a whole and to come up with\nbetter rules.\nMR. YABLON: Let me address that in two\nways, because we have two separate arguments and I want\nto try to keep them distinct. One is that if you look\nat the text and the history of Rule 11, there is strong\nevidence that Congress actually made an affirmative\njudgment not to sweep in Rule 11 violations within the\nscope of Rule 11(h).\nOur second argument is even if Rule 11(h)\napplies to all Rule 11 errors, that all Rule 11(h) does\nis apply the same substantial rights language that you\nsee in Rule 52(a) and (b). And this Court has\nrecognized that, while that substantial rights language\nis often synonymous with a case of specific prejudice\ninquiry, that's not always true. And there are a number\nof examples. The Court is familiar with the\nconstitutional cases in which the Court has said that an\nerror is structural without trying to determine, make a\ncase-specific determination of prejudice.\nBut there are a number of nonconstitutional\ncases as well in which the Court has said an\nindividualized prejudice inquiry is simply\ninappropriate, that the error affects substantial rights\nby its nature. So one example that I think is fairly\nclose to the one we have here is Gomez v. United States,\nwhere you have the Court addressing a statutory\nprovision that prevents magistrate judges from\nconducting the jury voir dire and that proviso is\nviolated and the Court is asked to conduct a prejudice\nanalysis: Did it matter that the magistrate judge\nconducted voir dire?\nAnd the Court said: We are not going to go\nthere; this is in effect a structural defect in the\nproceedings.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Well, Mr. Yablon, have we\never said that about the violation of a rule of criminal\nprocedure, that it's structural error no matter what the\ncircumstances?\nMR. YABLON: First, Justice Sotomayor, this\nCourt has said that rules of criminal -- I'm so,\nsorry -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's not the first\ntime that has happened.\nMR. YABLON: And I should be -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: You worked for her, too, I\nthink.\nMR. YABLON: That makes it that much more\nembarrassing. She used to sit over there.\nThis Court has said that Federal rules and\nstatutes stand on equal footing, so whether we are\ntalking about applying this with respect to a rule or a\nstatute, it shouldn't make a difference; the analysis\nshould be the same. And in fact there is at least one\ncase where the Court did apply in effect the structural\nanalysis to -- to a rule violation and a second case in\nwhich the Court at least left open the possibility.\nSo the case in which the Court did so is the\nMcCarthy case, which is discussed extensively in the\nbriefs. The Court referred to the 1966 version of Rule\n11 and said that prejudice adheres in a violation of\nthat rule and that it was not going to conduct an\nindividualized analysis. It was simply going to grant\nrelief where there had not been full compliance with\nthat provision.\nOf course, the rule has been amended since\nthen, but that provides evidence that the Court is not\nunwilling to adopt this kind of rule in the context of\nthe Federal Rules.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: I would think, Mr. Yablon,\nthat one of the effects of what you are asking us to do\nis that the rule would just get narrower and narrower.\nIn other words, if automatic reversal is always the\neffect of finding a violation -- and I think you\nacknowledge this in a way -- that people will just find\nfewer and fewer violations. And I'm wondering why we\nshould do something like that rather than interpret the\nrule as it was meant to be interpreted, but then say:\nYou know, somebody can look and say it really just\ndidn't matter that it was violated in this case.\nMR. YABLON: So we think that our approach\nis consistent with how the rule is in fact meant to be\ninterpreted. The rule really is about this problem of\nplacing judicial pressure on defendants to plead guilty,\nand those are the cases that ought to be reversed.\nBut the Court has a line-drawing decision to\nmake either way. Either the line that the Court should\nfocus on is the line that separates participation from\nnonparticipation or, again, a narrower class of\nparticipation. And I want to get to this point that -\nJUSTICE ALITO: But you are arguing for a\nnarrower interpretation of Rule 11(c)(1) than a number\nof courts of appeals have adopted, isn't that correct?\nMR. YABLON: I believe there are some\ndecisions out that have adopted probably a broader\nconstruction than we think is necessary and appropriate.\nBut what is easier for reviewing courts to monitor? Is\nit easier for them to monitor the narrowing, the\nimproper narrowing of the rule over time, or is it\neasier for them to monitor improper applications of the\nharmless error rule, especially applications of it that\nare happening in this kind of setting, where it's going\nto be almost inherently a very speculative analysis, an\nattempt to read the defendant's mind and ascertain\nwhether the defendant was influenced by what the judge\nwas saying.\nAnd it would be much easier for appellate\ncourts to focus on the line-drawing exercise that\ndetermines whether or not a violation had occurred or,\nif you think that the rule is broader, whether the kind\nof violation that occurred in this case occurred, than\nit would be to try to make this case-by-case scouring\nthe record, individualized prejudice determinations.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Could you say something\nabout Mr. Feigin's comments regarding what a judge can\nand cannot do if the judge thinks that he or she sees a\nviolation of Lafler and Frye taking place?\nMR. YABLON: So there ought to be things\nthat a judge is able to do in that situation. Suppose,\nfor example, that the judge becomes aware that the\ndefense attorney has given the -- his client false\ninformation about the elements of the charge. It would\nnot violate Rule 11(c)(1) for the judge to say: I\nunderstand that you were told that the elements of the\ncharge are A, B, and C, but in fact they are X, Y, and\nZ.\nSo there are -- there are certainly steps\nthat a judge can take to help root out the violation.\nAnd I would say that the fact is that generally when it\ncomes to ineffective assistance of counsel claims there\nis only so much that the trial could court can do. So\nthe fact that the trial court may not be able to solve\nor prevent every ineffective assistance claim in this\ncontext is not necessarily an argument against the rule,\nbecause the judge often is not aware of the privileged\ncommunications.\nJUSTICE ALITO: What if the judge knows as a\nresult of pretrial motions that the evidence in the case\nis very, very strong.\nLet's say there's a -- there's been a motion\nto suppress extremely incriminating evidence and the\nmotion has been denied, so the judge knows this is going\nto come in. And the judge thinks if this comes in,\nthere's virtually very little chance that the defendant\nis going to be acquitted, and yet the defendant -- and\nthe judge knows that a plea bargain -- a plea offer was\nmade and the defendant initially was going to take it,\nand then before it was accepted, it's rejected.\nIs there anything a judge can do in that\nsituation? Just sit back and, you know, wait for the\ncase to be -- to be reversed?\nMR. YABLON: Well, the judge's role in that\nsituation is -- is not to step in as defense counsel or,\nin effect, as second prosecutor. The judge -- I think\nthat there may be ways in that case for the judge to try\nto alleviate the error without -- without crossing the\nline. But when -- but when you start to make exceptions\nin that -- in that situation, you -- you go down the\nroad of -- of the judge being the one who is evaluating\nthe evidence and who is, in effect, potentially\npresuming the defendant's guilt. And the judge -\nJUSTICE ALITO: It just puts -- puts the\njudge in a very difficult position. It could -- can the\njudge say, you -- do you realize that I denied your\nmotion to suppress that wiretap? And do you recognize\nthat on that wiretap, you conceded that the loss in this\ncase is $20 million, and do you know that under the\nsentencing guidelines, the sentence where the loss is\n$20 million is whatever it is, ten years in jail.\nIf the judge says all of that, has the judge\nviolated Rule 11(c)(1)?\nMR. YABLON: And if this is happening in the\ncontext of active discussions of whether the defendant\nshould or should not take a plea, then that -- that may\nwell cross the line.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I don't know when it can\nhappen, because there's no colloquy when there's a\nguilty plea. The colloquy happens when there's a not\nguilty plea.\nMR. YABLON: I think -- isn't it the\nopposite, Justice Kennedy? The colloquy happens after\nthe defendant -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: No, no -- you're correct.\nYou're correct.\nMR. YABLON: So -- so taking -- so in that\ninstance, again, you have a situation that may not be\ndifferent from situations that arise in completely\ndifferent contexts, where the attorney is doing\nsomething that's ineffective, for example, and the judge\njust doesn't know about it. And -- and whether or not\nthat can be cured in this -- in this setting of the -\nof plea discussions, it's just a little bit tangential,\nI think, to the key issue.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Now -- well, but\nyou've answered a lot of these questions by saying, you\nknow, it's hard to draw the line and, you know, maybe in\nthat case, maybe in this case.\nMost -- our precedents where we recognize\nstructural error and -- and plain error are ones that\nare pretty easily categorized. Did a magistrate conduct\nvoir dire or did he not? You know right away one way or\nthe other. Did he participate enough? You know, well,\nif he told them how many times he sentenced people this\nway, it's not, but if he said you ought to -- you ought\nto pay attention to what I'm telling you when you'd\nconsider whether to plea or not, well, then it is.\nIt -- it seems to me in the typical plain\nerror cases, we're very -- the categories are very\nsharply defined.\nMR. YABLON: That's actually not accurate.\nI would say, for example, take the defendant's right to\nself-representation. And do you -- there may be obvious\ncases and when the defendant's right to\nself-representation has been clearly denied. But there\nare going to be line-drawing problems when you're trying\nto figure out did standby counsel intervene so much that\nhe denied that right.\nOr similarly with the public trial,\nobviously, a court can be totally closed, but then there\nare going to be difficult cases when you have to decide\nwhether the justifications for closing the courtroom\nare -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I would say in both\nof those examples, the line -- the gray area, if you\nwere, is really quite narrow than here, where almost\nevery time you've been asked a question about a\ndifficult hypothetical, you say, well, maybe, maybe not.\nAnd I think that's quite different than saying is the\ncourt closed or not or was the person -- you know, did\nhe represent himself in fact or not. And those just\nstrike me as much easier cases.\nMR. YABLON: And, of course, I'm being asked\nall of the difficult hypotheticals.\nIf you look at the cases that actually\nrise -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes, but if you were\n-- if you were arguing whether or not it's -- it's\ncategorical error when the magistrate conducts voir\ndire, it'd be pretty hard for somebody to come up with a\ntough hypothetical.\nMR. YABLON: In that instance, yes. But\nthere certainly are instances in which the structural -\nin which the Court has found structural error, even when\nthere will be difficult line-drawing problems. And -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Yablon, one problem\nwith calling this structural error is that it's not so\nclear that this is a -- a bad thing. That is, some\nStates even today allow a judge to participate in plea\nbargaining, and the advisors -- the rules advisory\ncommittee -- said, when it -- when it framed this\nrule that some commentators had said it was quite -\nquite a frequent thing that happened, that judges\nparticipated. So it isn't like not having a public\ntrial or not giving a person counsel of choice.\nIt's, this was -- this was something that\nstill some jurisdictions think it's okay.\nMR. YABLON: Your Honor, no jurisdiction\nendorses judicial exhortations to plead guilty. And -\nand so this Court can resolve the case just on that\nnarrower basis, that there is a category of cases that\nclearly do involve direct judicial pressure. And no\nState allows it, and those are clear violations of the\nrules. So without needing to draw these other lines\nabout how broad participation may reach, the Court can\ndo that.\nBut even in those States, it's important to\nnote that -- that the Federal system has made a\ndifferent structural choice. So whether or not it may\nviolate the Constitution for States to have carefully\ntailored procedures that allow some type of judicial\ninvolvement, that's not the structure that the Federal\nsystem has chosen. And when you're dealing with the\nstructural choice that was made in Rule 11, that judges\nshall not, must not participate in plea discussions,\nthat that is as elemental to the Federal system of plea\nbargaining that we have as many of the familiar elements\nof -- of the trial are. And so, the fact that States\nhave made -- made different structural choices does not\nmean that it's not a structural error here.\nNow, I do want to get back to this\nline-drawing issue, because I think that this is not\nsomething that should trouble the Court too much, for a\ncouple of reasons: First, in most cases, the line will\nnot be that hard to draw when you consider the purpose\nof Rule 11(c)(1), which is reducing judicial pressure,\nand instances in which judges are stepping out of their\nrole as impartial adjudicators, and when reviewing\ncourts take that as the touchstone, there may be\ndifficult cases, but they're going to be able to resolve\nmost of them.\nNow, if the Court feels like it may be\ndifficult to do line drawing, and it is uncomfortable\nextending the rule, the remedy that we're seeking that\nfar, it is entirely appropriate for the Court to -- to\ntake out a subcategory of Rule 11(c)(1) violations.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: But that seems a bit odd,\ndon't you think, Mr. Yablon? You know, you're saying,\nwell, there are core violations as opposed to noncore\nviolations. I mean, presumably, that's part of what the\nCourt would think about when it was doing prejudice\nanalysis.\nMR. YABLON: It would factor into the\nprejudice analysis that the Court undertakes, but it\nalso is a reason just to -- to draw the line. I mean,\nthis Court in -- in various instances has\nindicated that -- I mean, there are some -- some broad\nrules out there: The right to the assistance of\ncounsel. It comes in different shapes. And the\nprejudice analysis that applies for a total denial of\nthe right to counsel is different from the one that\napplies when you're dealing with mere deficiency in\ncounsel's performance.\nAnd there is -- and again, this is -- this\nis a comparative line-drawing problem. Either you draw\nthe line looking at what a violation is or looking at\nwhat a judicial exhortation is from the statement that\nis made, or you engage in this freewheeling speculation\nthat the government wants engaged in, where you were\ntrying to read the defendant's mind. And that is simply\nnot how harmless error analysis normally proceeds, where\nyou have a closed universe of a record, you have\nspecific criteria that are being applied, and you can\nposit what a reasonable juror is.\nThere is no reasonable defendant that can be\nposited in the same way, because defendants are\nidiosyncratic and are entitled to be idiosyncratic.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Yablon, do you know of\nany case where there is one of these core violations,\nthese exhortation cases, where the Court did not find\nprejudice?\nMR. YABLON: The answer is no, and that\nwould be -- and we would urge the Court that if it does\nnot accept our primary submission, that it make clear\nthat judicial exhortations like this are highly unlikely\nto be harmless.\nThat is what the Fourth Circuit has done,\nthe Fifth Circuit, the Seventh Circuit, the Tenth\nCircuit, the D.C. Circuit. They are in effect applying\na per se analysis, they're just not calling it that.\nThey are reversing in all of these cases.\nAnd so, if this Court is uncomfortable\ncalling it a per se rule, at least it should give very\nstrong indications that comments like this cannot be\nwritten off, that they are highly likely, given the\nposition of the judge relative to the defendant, to\naffect the defendant's thinking, to affect the way that\nthe defense counsel approaches the case, and possibly\nthe prosecution as well in those cases in which the\nprosecution is aware of the error.\nAnd we would go further and say that if the\nCourt were to go down this road, it would be useful for\nthe Court to provide the additional guidance of holding\nthat this particular type of error was not harmless.\nThat would send a signal to the lower courts that this\nconduct is clearly off limits, and it would give them an\nindication that the court means what it's saying, that\nthese kind of comments, where a judge is exhorting a\ndefendant to come to the cross, that he needs to plead\nguilty -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How do we -- if\nwe're giving this guidance, what do we say about the\nfact that he had a different judge subsequent to this,\nthat he filed a speedy trial motion after this coercion,\nto suggest that he wasn't coerced all that much.\nAre we supposed to take all that into\nconsideration, too?\nMR. YABLON: You should say that those\ninferences are not adequate to overcome the inference\nthat you draw from this type of participation,\nparticularly here.\nI mean, consider the change in judge. The\nreason this hearing occurred before the magistrate judge\nis because the defendant sent a letter to the district\ncourt asking -- explaining his problems with his\ncounsel. He got a response from the magistrate judge.\nSo in the defendant's mind, the magistrate judge and the\ndistrict court are effectively one and the same, and you\nwould not want a system where district courts are\nencouraged to send these issues to magistrate judges, so\nmagistrate judges can engage in these kind of comments,\nbut then the district judge can basically just cleanse\nit. It is going to affect the way that the process\nplays out.\nNow, the speedy trial issue, if I may\njust -- we can equally draw the inference that that was\nonly done because counsel wanted to put some pressure on\nthe government to actually reach a deal. And it is that\nkind of speculation that makes this error ill-suited to\nthe kind of remedial analysis the government favors.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Feigin, 13 minutes.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC J. FEIGIN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. FEIGIN: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nI just want to make one quick point in\nresponse to the notion that we're asking for some form\nof new prejudice analysis here.\nThis is the exact same prejudice analysis\nfrom Dominguez Benitez, that looks whether there is a\nreasonable probability that the error affected the plea.\nUnless the Court has any further questions,\nI will rest -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Feigin, can I ask you\nthe same question that I asked Mr. Yablon: Do you know\nof any cases where in these -- where there are really\ncore violations, where a judge exhorts the defendant to\nplea it -- does the Court ever find that\nnon-prejudicial?\nMR. FEIGIN: I am aware of one or two State\ncases in which the court has looked at the passage of\ntime as a reason why that kind of error wouldn't have\nbeen prejudicial.\nBut otherwise, I agree with Respondent that\nin the Federal courts of appeals, that does tend to get\nreversed. And I think that supports the idea that if\nthe Court adopts the normal prejudice approach, and\nreaffirms that approach in this case, that there's\nnot really that -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Do you disagree with how\nthe Fourth and Seventh Circuits and other circuits apply\na prejudice analysis, but one that says that it's highly\nunlikely that you're not going to find prejudice? Do\nyou disagree with their analysis and approach?\nMR. FEIGIN: Well, Your Honor, there -\nmy -- I'm not going to go so far as to endorse the\nresults they've reached in every single case -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No.\nMR. FEIGIN: -- but I think insofar as they\napproach the matter that -- you know, if there's a\nfairly serious error and the defendant pleads guilty\nright after that, that that's very likely absence of\nextenuating circumstances to be prejudicial; we don't\nhave a problem with that.\nUnless there are further questions -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nCounsel.\n"
