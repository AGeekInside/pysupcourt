        "content": "(10:13 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument\nfirst this morning in Case 11-1274, Gabelli and\nAlpert v. the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nMr. Liman.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF LEWIS LIMAN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. LIMAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThis case concerns the statute dealing\nexclusively with penalty claims brought by government\nagencies to punish conduct made unlawful by statute.\nCongress provided a clear and easily administered\nstatutory time limitation on the government's power to\npunish: 5 years, except as otherwise provided by\nCongress.\nThe case does not concern -- the statute\ndoes not concern the government's power to seek remedial\nremedies such as disgorgement and injunction.\nConsistent with -- Congress's normal approach in penal\nsituations, Congress fixed a statute of limitations for\npenalties. The court below, for the first time over the\ncentury the statute has been in existence, sweepingly\nconcluded that unless Congress clearly directed\notherwise, the statute and the 5 years did not begin to\nrun from the time the defendant violated the law, the\nordinary rule for statutes providing for accrual, but\ninstead -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Liman. Mr. Liman,\nyou -- you are typing this a penalty case. The\ngovernment says the accrual is the ordinary rule, but\ndiscovery is the rule when there is fraud, and fraud is\nalleged here. So how does the Court decide whether to\ntype this case a penalty case, as you allege, or a fraud\ncase, as the government urged -- urges, when both\ncaptions fit?\nMR. LIMAN: Your Honor, I think there are\ntwo answers to that. First is that the Court doesn't\nneed to decide, Congress has decided. Congress made it\nquite clear that the rule of accrual applied to all\npenalty claims. And as this Court held in\nClark v. Martinez, the same word in a statute cannot be\ngiven different interpretations depending on the\nunderlying statute to which it is applied.\nThe second reason, though, Justice Ginsburg,\nis that it is not correct to say, and this Court has\nnever said, that either the Bailey rule or the injury\naccrual rule applies to a statutory fraud claim where\nthe government is seeking to punish. That would -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Excuse me.\nJustice Ginsburg points out that you're talking about\nthe statute, but the statute uses the term \"accrual.\"\nIs it correct to say that the term \"accrual\" is not used\nin statute of limitations for crimes -- generally -- for\ncrimes?\nMR. LIMAN: For -- for crimes, the general\nword that is used is time period from the violation.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Right. And this -- and\nthis talks about accrual. So that is indicative -- is\nindicative of the fact that Congress is using a civil\nanalogue in the drafting of this statute.\nMR. LIMAN: Your Honor, it indicates that\nCongress is using accrual as it is understood at common\nlaw. Common law, it means when the claim becomes ripe\nand the plaintiff has the ability to sue. What that\nmeans is, as the D.C. Circuit said in 3M -- and we think\nthe D.C. Circuit got it right on this -- that you look\nto the underlying statute pursuant to which the\ngovernment is seeking a penalty to see when the claim\nbecame ripe.\nIn a penalty situation, and under the IAA,\nwhich is what this concerns -- it doesn't concern a\ncommon law fraud claim; it doesn't concern a claim where\nthere's even any element of deception that's required.\nIt's a breach of fiduciary duty. What the IAA says is\nthat the government can sue when the violation occurs.\nNow -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Liman, I understand\nyour argument, but I have a fundamental difficulty,\nokay?\nBailey and Exploration Company, with\nstatutes not too dissimilar from this one, who read the\ndiscovery rule into a fraud claim, both were a civil\nlitigant and for the government. The only way that I\ncan tease out a potential difference between Exploration\nand this case is somehow that the penalty in this case\nis not for injury, but for punishment, as you called it.\nGovernment as enforcer, rather than government as\nvictim.\nSome of us would say that the common wheel\nis injured whenever someone breaks a law, so that that\ndistinction between enforcer and victim makes no sense.\nHow do you answer that point?\nMR. LIMAN: Justice Sotomayor, let me give\nyou the precise answer to that, which is that in this\ncase where the government is seeking a penalty, it is\nnot acting on behalf of underlying investors, and the\nrecovery is not one that is brought by way of damages or\ndisgorgement.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It's acting as a\nsovereign to protect what it thinks is an ordered\nsociety. And if you break that order, you are injuring\nthe society. That -- that's the best -\nMR. LIMAN: Your Honor, I think that is the\narticulation that the government would have to make. I\ndon't think it holds up, for several reasons. First of\nall, it would represent an extreme departure from\nanything this Court has ever held or, to our knowledge,\nany court has ever held with respect to the application\nof the discovery rule.\nSecond, when you're talking about penalty,\nyou're not talking about recovery to -- to victims.\nThird, when we're talking about implying a rule, which\nis what the government's argument is here -- it's not an\nargument to follow the plain language, it's an argument\nto depart from the plain language -- you should look at,\nand the cases direct you to look at, the policy\nconcerns. And when you're talking about discover -- a\ndiscovery rule with respect to the government as\nenforcer, the rules don't work. They don't work for\nseveral reasons.\nFirst of all, when you've got an injury, a\nparty who is injured, the statute of limitations has a\nnatural start date that is not in control of the\nplaintiff. There is a relationship to the underlying\nviolation. And that can be readily measured. None of\nthat is true when you're talking about the government in\na law enforcement capacity.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Liman, what you\nsuggested, when we talked about the discovery rule, is\nthat it has a basis in the notion that a defendant with\nunclean hands who has committed deceptive conduct\npreventing the plaintiff from understanding that he or\nit has a cause of action -- you know, shouldn't be\nentitled to the benefit of a statute of limitations.\nAnd if that's the understanding that lies\nbehind the discovery rule, I guess the question for you\nis, why doesn't it apply in this case, as well as, in\nthe case where the person bringing the action has\nhimself suffered a harm?\nMR. LIMAN: Justice Kagan, I've got two\nanswers to that question as well. The first is that -\nthat I don't think is the basis for the -- for the\ndiscovery rule at bottom. The basis for the discovery\nrule -- if you look at this Court's opinion in -- in\nRotella, if you look at the Seventh Circuit in Cada, the\nD.C. Circuit in Connor -- is the notion that when the\nplaintiff cannot discover the injury, doesn't know that\nit's been injured, and cannot reasonably know that the\nplaintiff's been injured, the plaintiff cannot take the\nsteps that other plaintiffs would take to investigate\nand determine whether they've got a cause of action.\nThat's not applicable in a government\nenforcement context because you're not talking about\nthere the government as a victim. The government may\nnot know of the underlying transaction, will not know of\nthe underlying transaction, unless the government asks.\nThe second reason is that there is a strain\nthat -- in the Bailey line of cases -- that really\nspeaks in terms of equitable tolling and fraudulent\nconcealment, that sort of a notion of unclean -- unclean\nhands. That's not in this case because the government\naffirmatively took it out. But we would submit -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: How did the government\ntake it out? I mean, the point here is that there was a\nconcealment. There was a hiding of what was -- the\nimpermissible action.\nMR. LIMAN: That's -- that's not correct,\nJustice Ginsburg. If you'd look at the -- at the\nopinion below and you look at the complaint, the essence\nof the allegation, which we have not yet had a chance to\ndisprove before you on a motion to dismiss, is that\nthere were misrepresentations and omissions made to the\nboard of the mutual fund. There was no\nmisrepresentations made to the investing public. That\nallegation is not in the complaint. It would not be\naccurate. And there is no allegation whatsoever that\nanything was hidden from the government or was in any\nway concealed from the government. The records here\nwould have been available -- were available for the\ngovernment to look at, at any time.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Liman, finishing up\na point you were just on previously, what's your\nposition with respect to fraudulent concealment?\nDoesn't your theory preclude even the application of\nthat to tolling of the statute?\nMR. LIMAN: Your Honor, I think you could\nand should conclude -- that if you reach that issue. I\ndon't think you need to reach that issue.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But tell me about -\nMR. LIMAN: Our theory doesn't require you\nto come to that conclusion.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: This is -- it's nice for\nyou to say that. But tell me, having announced your\ntheory, how the next step is avoidable? Under what\ntheory would we say you can't have a discovery rule, but\nyou can have a fraudulent concealment rule?\nMR. LIMAN: Your Honor, in the -- using the\nsame type of theory and the same methodology that the\nCourt employed in the RICO context, in the Claire case,\nand in the Rotella case, one can read the statute, I\nthink you have to read the statute, here to say that\n\"accrue\" means accrue. It's the time that the\ngovernment can first sue.\nThat does not necessarily resolve the\nquestion of whether there are equitable exceptions that\nthe government or any party could affirmatively assert\nto toll the statute of limitations, not to delay the\naccrual of the statute of limitations.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. -- Mr. Liman, you\nacknowledge that a civil action could be brought\nbeginning from the time when the injured plaintiff\ndiscovers the fraud, right?\nMR. LIMAN: That's -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So you're really not\narguing for what you might call a total statute of\nrepose. It seems to me odd that the defendant would be\nrelieved from prosecution by the government, but not\nrelieved from a suit for sometimes very substantial\ndamages by -- by an injured plaintiff who doesn't have\nto sue until he's discovered the fraud.\nMR. LIMAN: Your Honor, respectfully, we\ndon't think that's not odd at all. If you look in the\nsecurities context, there is a 5-year statute of repose.\nAnd it would be odd to think that the same Congress that\npassed that 5-year statute of repose limiting even the\nability of an injured plaintiff without the tools of the\ngovernment to bring a private suit for damages, that's\nthe -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Sure. But that 5 years\ndoesn't begin to run until the private plaintiff\ndiscovers the fraud, right?\nMR. LIMAN: That's -- that's not correct,\nYour Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No?\nMR. LIMAN: Under Title 28 1658(b) the 5\nyears runs from the time of the violation. It's exactly\ncoextensive 2462, and it's not an accident that it's\nexactly coextensive.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Liman, how does it\nwork with a disgorgement remedy? I take it that that's\nstill -- that you are not challenging the disgorgement?\nMR. LIMAN: We are not challenging the\ndisgorgement in front of this Court, and if this Court\nreverses the Second Circuit that -- that issue will\nremain in the case and the SEC's claim for disgorgement\nwill remain, and that's really been the way -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But you don't apply -\nyou don't say it's too late for them to sue for\ndisgorgement?\nMR. LIMAN: 2462 applies exclusively with\nrespect to penalties, fines and forfeitures. It does\nnot apply with respect to equitable remedies.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So is there any statute\nof limitations on disgorgement?\nMR. LIMAN: There is none. There is none.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Does it apply to Social\nSecurity? Does it apply to Veterans Affairs?\nMR. LIMAN: The -- there is a Social\nSecurity statute that -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Does this statute apply to\nSocial Security?\nMR. LIMAN: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Does it apply to Veterans\nAffairs? Yes or no or you don't know?\nMR. LIMAN: I don't know about Veterans\nAffairs.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What about Social Security?\nMR. LIMAN: Social Security, there is an\nunderlying statute -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Then, I'm asking about this\nstatute. Does it apply?\nMR. LIMAN: The answer is yes. The answer\nis yes. It applies to a broad range of statutes, unless\nCongress otherwise provided. In fact, there are very\nfew penalty statutes to which it does not apply.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Defense Department?\nMR. LIMAN: It does apply to a number of\nDefense Department statutes. I'm hesitating -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Antitrust?\nMR. LIMAN: I'm not sure on antitrust. But\nI believe that it applies to -- it does apply to a\nnumber of unfair trade practices. Antitrust, there may\nbe a separate statute.\nJUSTICE BREYER: FTC, you don't know?\nMR. LIMAN: FTC, yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: It does apply to FTC, okay.\nSo Social Security, FTC. Veterans Affairs we don't\nknow, antitrust we don't know. Okay.\nMR. LIMAN: One of the notable features,\nJustice Breyer, is that if you look across the U.S.\nCode, the government makes a point of saying: Well,\nCongress uses penalty -- acknowledges that Congress has\nused penalty when -- the word \"penalty\" when the\nCongress has -- I'm sorry, it has used the word\n\"discovery\" when Congress has wanted the statute to -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Liman, I'm a little\nconfused in your answer to Justice Scalia. You said\nthat the underlying case has a 5-year statute of repose\nfor a civil claim. It Bailey applies, however, those\nclaimants who have -- under your theory, who have been\ndirectly injured. The presumption would apply of\ndiscovery, if they were claiming a fraud.\nMR. LIMAN: No -- no, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So are you just arguing\nthat under this statutory scheme there is no application\nof the discovery?\nMR. LIMAN: This -- this Court has held in\nthe Lampf case that Bailey and Holmberg do not apply to\nsecurities fraud case.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Because of the\nalternative language of 5 years.\nMR. LIMAN: Well, in Lampf it was 1-year and\n3-year.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Right.\nMR. LIMAN: And in the Merck case, the Court\nmade clear that the 5 years was the statute of -- the\nstatute of repose.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's what I thought\nthose involved.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Medicare, Medicaid?\nMR. LIMAN: Yes.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: It is true, though, isn't\nit, that Justice Scalia pointed to an anomaly that could\neasily exist in other contexts because this isn't only a\nstatute about securities violations. So that you might\nhave in other contexts in which this statute applies a\nworld in which a private individual could sue, but the\ngovernment -- could sue after the -- the period of\ntime -\nMR. LIMAN: Yes.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: -- the 5 years, but the\ngovernment could not.\nMR. LIMAN: Yes, Justice Kagan. And we\ndon't think that's an anomaly. We don't think it's an\nanomaly for two reasons. First of all, in the private\ncontext, as again I mentioned, the statute, the start\ndate for the statute of limitations is not in the\ncontrol of the plaintiff. That's a critical point.\nIt's critical in this Court's jurisprudence from Hubrick\nforward. It -- there is a natural start date from when\nthe injury would be known to a reasonable plaintiff.\nNot true with respect to the government, who may not\neven know of the transaction. And -- but what it -- so\nit's -- I don't think there's an anomaly because there\nare different statutes of limitation.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: And I take it that your view\nwould be that a case like Exploration, it's different\nthan this case because it does have a natural start\ndate; is that the idea?\nMR. LIMAN: Number one, it does. And number\ntwo, the relief being sought in Exploration was the\ncancellation of a patent, so it was the government as a\nparty to a transaction. And what the Court really said\nin Exploration, what the Court, in fact, said in\nExploration, is that there is no reason why the same\nrule applied the same way couldn't benefit the\ngovernment, as well as the private plaintiff.\nWhat the government is seeking here is not\nthe same rule and would not be applied in the same way\nbecause you are talking about a transaction that is a,\nfrankly, a private transaction that there is no reason\nthat the government would know anything about. The\nclaim ultimately here is a claim about what was said in\na private conversation between the advisor to a mutual\nfund and the mutual fund -- fund board.\nSo Exploration, what's notable is that the\ngovernment doesn't cite a single case where the\ndiscovery rule has been applied to a party who is not a\nvictim or that it's been applied -- where it's been\napplied and a penalty hasn't been -- a penalty has been\nat issue. I mean, neither of those circumstances. We\nare talking about a statute ultimately where the plain\nlanguage is clear and the government is invoking a\nstatutory canon not to try to interpret language of the\nstatute, not even to fill a gap in a statute, but to\noverride it. The canon that they say overrides the\nplain language doesn't exist.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: In a civil -- in a civil\naction brought by an injured investor or private party,\ncan that plaintiff, the injured investor, the private\nparty, in the ordinary course plead and rely upon an\nearlier government determination that there had been a\nviolation and so that that's presumptive showing of\nliability?\nMR. LIMAN: Your Honor -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: In other words, the SEC\nmakes an investigation, find a violation; can a private\ninvestor then rely on that as a presumptive showing of\nliability?\nMR. LIMAN: Yeah. I think the lower courts\nare mixed on the extent to which you can rely upon the\nactual allegations in a complaint.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: No, not the allegation.\nIt's an ultimate finding.\nMR. LIMAN: Absolutely.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But then under your rule.\nThe plaintiff would be deprived of that.\nMR. LIMAN: No, that's not correct,\nYour Honor. Under our rule the plaintiff has exactly\nthe same rights, regardless of how this case is\ndetermined. The plaintiff's cause of action will turn\nupon the underlying -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But if the government's\nstatute of limitations runs out and the private investor\nis on his own, then the private investor doesn't have\nthe advantage that exists in other cases of reliance on\na -- SEC finding as a presumptive showing of liability.\nMR. LIMAN: Your Honor, that -- that -- our\nargument only applies with respect to penalty. The\ngovernment has huge powers with respect to disgorgement\nand injunctive relief. So, if the government believes\nthat there is a wrongdoing, the government still has the\nability to bring a claim and the private investors still\nhave the ability to rely upon the government's\nenforcement action and whatever findings come out of\nthat. So there is nothing in our argument that\ndiminished, to any degree, the recovery abilities of a\nprivate plaintiff.\nIn fact, as we've highlighted, that 5-year\nperiod for the -- in the securities laws puts a premium\non the SEC acting promptly. And I would note that\nthat's something that is not accidental. If you go back\nin the legislative history and look to the SEC's\nreaction to the Lampf decision, the SEC urged a 5-year\nstatute of repose, saying that that struck in the\nprivate context the right balance between repose when\nyou're dealing with complex commercial transactions and\nenforcement and -- and recovery.\nThere's -- the position that the SEC is\ntaking now is a novel position that to -- to our\nknowledge has not been taken by other regulators and\nhasn't been taken by the SEC until -- until quite\nrecently. This statute's been on the books for quite a\nlong time, and it's notable that agencies have not urged\nthat -- that interpretation.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Are there no statutes,\nMr. Liman, that say the claim accrues when the injury is\ndiscovered, that use both -- both terms?\nMR. LIMAN: I'm sorry, Justice Ginsburg. I\nmissed the question.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Are there no statutes\nthat use both terms, \"accrues\" and \"discovery\"? A\nstatute, for example, that says, this claim accrues when\nthe injury is discovered?\nMR. LIMAN: There are statutes that use that\nkind of language, and that's precisely our point because\nit reflects that Congress recognizes the difference and\ncould, if Congress wanted, provide that a claim for the\nviolation of the IAA or for any other statute accrues\nwhen it is discovered.\nIf there are no further questions, I would\nlike to reserve the remainder of my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Wall.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY B. WALL\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. WALL: Mr. Chief Justice and may it\nplease the Court:\nI think Justice Kennedy started us off in\nthe right place by focusing on the statute and its use\nof the term \"accrual.\" And when counsel concedes that\nthat term had an established meaning at common law and\nthis statute picks it up, I think he gave away his case\nbecause there were a cluster of concepts. One was the\ngeneral rule governing accrual: It accrues when the\nplaintiff can -- has a right to sue.\nBut there was a specific principle for cases\nof fraud and concealment. And I don't think there is\nany basis in law or logic for Petitioner saying that\nthis statute meant to pick up one of those concepts and\nnot the other concept.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't think the common\nlaw held that it didn't accrue. I think it was an\nexception to the accrual rule, that, even though it\naccrued earlier, we are going to allow a later suit\nwhere -- where discovery is made later. I -- is that\nthe way those cases were framed, that it didn't accrue\nuntil discovery?\nMR. WALL: Justice Scalia, I don't want to\nfight about it too much because from the government's\nperspective, it doesn't matter -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you are making the\nargument, so you ought to fight about it.\nMR. WALL: It doesn't matter how it's\nlabeled. It doesn't matter whether we label it as an\ninterpretation of the statute or an exception for cases\nof fraud or concealment. The result is the same.\nBut I will say you are right, in some cases\nit was described as an exception, but as long ago as\nKirby in 1887 and as recently as Merck -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And never in a criminal\ncase, right? Do you have a single case in which the\ndiscovery rule was -- was applied in a criminal case\nwith respect to a penalty or a criminal sanction?\nMR. WALL: No, not in -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Not a single one.\nMR. WALL: Well, no. The criminal context\nis fundamentally different. This Court has said that\nthose statutes are construed liberally in favor of\nrepose and are presumptively not subject to -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Now, that's the question\nbecause I certainly agree with Justice Scalia that this\nis not an SEC statute, this is not a securities statute;\nit is a statute that applies to all government actions,\nwhich is a huge category across the board and it's about\n200 years old.\nAnd until 2004 I haven't found a single case\nin which the government ever tried to assert the\ndiscovery rule where what they were seeking was a civil\npenalty, not to try to make themselves whole where they\nare a victim, with one exception, a case called Maillard\nin the 19th century where they did make that assertion.\nThey were struck down by the district court, and the\nattorney general in his opinion said, the district\ncourt's absolutely right; of course, the government\ncannot effectively abolish the statute of limitations\nwhere what they're trying to do is to gather something\nthat's so close to a criminal case.\nSo my question is: Is there any case at all\nuntil the year 2004, approximately, in which the\ngovernment has either tried or certainly succeeded in\ntaking this general statute and applying the discovery\nrule where they are not a victim, they are trying to\nenforce the law for the civil penalty?\nThe reason I brought up Social Security,\nVeteran's Affairs, Medicare, is it seems to me to have\nenormous consequences for the government suddenly to try\nto assert a quasi-criminal penalty and abolish the\nstatute of limitations, I mean, in a vast set of cases.\nAnd that -- you know, I have overstated that last remark\na little bit, but I want you to see where I'm coming\nfrom, which isn't so different from the -- from the\nquestions that have been put to you.\nMR. WALL: Justice Breyer, most or many of\nthe penalty claims that are being brought under Section\n2462 and other penalty statutes don't deal with fraud or\nconcealment, and I grant you that it is a problem -\nJUSTICE BREYER: All I'm asking you for is\none case.\nMR. WALL: So in -- it's a problem of fairly\nrecent vintage, to be sure -\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, it is not a problem of\nfairly recent vintage. I'd say for 200 years there is\nno case. The only case, as far as I have been able to\ndiscover, which is why I am asking, is that what created\nthe problem of recent vintage is that the Seventh\nCircuit, I guess, or a couple of other circuits decided\nthat this discovery rule did apply to an effort by the\ngovernment to assert a civil penalty. That's what\ncreated the problem. Before that there was no problem;\nit was clear the government couldn't do it.\nAll right. Now, you will tell me that I'm\nwrong by citing some cases that show I'm wrong. And\nthat's what I'm asking. I want to be told I'm wrong,\nsort of.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. WALL: And I guess what I want to tell\nyou is there aren't cases out there one way or the\nother. There aren't cases endorsing or declining to\nadopt the discovery rule in the context of fraud or\nconcealment with civil penalty actions -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You'd expect that - you'd\nexpect there to be some cases in a couple of hundred\nyears.\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, I haven't found one.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Fraud is nothing new, for\nPete's sake.\nMR. WALL: Justice Scalia, it's not that -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: This is brand-new assertion\nby the government that -- tell -- is there much\ndifference between the rule you are arguing for and a\nrule that there is no statute of limitations?\nMR. WALL: Absolutely there is. Since -\nlook, in 1990 the Commission was given the right to seek\ncivil penalties, so it could only have brought these\nactions for the last 20 years. In those 20-plus years,\nwe have seen 25 reported cases dealing with 2462 and\ncivil penalties. In 19 of those cases, the Commission\nbrought its action within 5 years of the end of the\nfraud. It used the discovery rule only to reach back\nand get the beginning of the fraud.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but that\nignores the point that has been raised, is that this\nstatute does not just apply in the SEC context. How\nmany cases have you found across the board in the range\nof those areas that Justice Breyer catalogued?\nMR. WALL: There are cases from the 1980s\nand 1990s dealing with concealment, and in our view the\njustification is the same for concealment as fraud.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I mean, we are asking the\nsame question, but in 30 seconds I am going to conclude\nthere is none. What I want is a case before the year\n2000 in which the government sought a civil penalty and\nwas not trying to recover money or land that it had\nlost, and I want the name of that case in which they\nsaid that the discovery rule applies.\nThe two that you cited, Amy and the case of\nBroderick's Will, did involve the government being\ninjured by losing land or losing money, something like\nthat. So I have those and I don't think they count, but\nI will look at them again. Is there anything else you\nwould like to refer me to?\nMR. WALL: Justice Breyer, I don't think\nthere is anything on either side of the ledger, I will\nbe very upfront, other than the Maillard case, which I\nthink even courts at the time, an exploration company,\nthe court of appeals recognized -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's not a matter of there\nbeing nothing on either side of the ledger. What's\nextraordinary is that the government has never asserted\nthis, except in the 19th century, when it was rebuffed\nand -- and repudiated its position. It isn't just that\nthere are no cases against you. It's you've never -\nthe government has never asserted it before.\nMR. WALL: Justice Scalia, there were very\nfew civil penalty actions in which -- that involved\nfraud or concealment, in which the government would have\nneeded to invoke it, or did invoke it and was rebuffed\nby courts. I mean, this is a fairly modern problem, and\nthe question is do all of the same concepts that\ncompelled one answer in these other contexts compel the\nsame answer here or does a rule that blankets the\nwaterfront -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, this is a very\nmodern problem, but how about the statute of Elizabeth,\nwhich talked about penalties as being a criminal\nsanction, but permitted private individuals, not the\ngovernment, to seek the penalties and keep it. So you\ncite the statute of James, and I look at the statute of\nElizabeth, and try to find the analogy between which\none.\nMR. WALL: Well, if this were a criminal\npenalty, the government agrees -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Even though private\nparties could keep the money back then.\nMR. WALL: That's right. But what the\nCourt's been clear on is that there are civil penalties\nand there are criminal penalties and which side of the\nline it falls on invokes a different set of background\nrules and legal norms. The Congress denominated this as\na civil penalty -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could I move you to\nanother issue? If a party can defeat the government's\nclaim of discovery by showing that the government wasn't\nreasonably diligent, how does a party ever accomplish\nthat? Aren't you going to raise the law enforcement\nprivilege, the -- some other privilege to block -\ndiscovery?\nMR. WALL: Justice Sotomayor, discovery is\nplaying itself out in cases like these in district\ncourts. Privilege has not been a very major issue and\nthe reason is defendants are by and large pointing to\nthings in the public domain -- private lawsuits, public\nfilings with the Commission, public statements -- to say\nthose put the Commission on constructive words -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, if they fail\nthere, don't you think that they are going to also fail\nbecause they are not going to be able to look at your\nrecords to figure out exactly what you knew or didn't\nknow?\nMR. WALL: No, not invariably. I mean, the\nway this plays itself out in the district court is the\nCommission says that it didn't know and a defendant\npoints to something in the public domain and says either\nthat put you on constructive notice or -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So it depends really\non how many enforcement officers the SEC has, is it\nreasonable for them to have been aware of the particular\nitem in some publication. Maybe if they've got 1,000\npeople reviewing it, but maybe not if they have 10; and\nthat's just not the -- I mean, it's not just the SEC;\nit's all these other government areas.\nIt seems to me that it's going to be almost\nimpossible for somebody to prove that the government\nshould have known about something. And which part of\nthe government? I mean, it's a big, big government, and\nparticular agencies -- well, you say, well, the Defense\nContractor Board should have known, but does that mean\nthat the U.S. attorney's office or the Defense Counsel's\noffice should have known?\nIt seems to me that, at least with respect\nto that aspect, you really are eliminating any real -\nit's certainly not a lot of repose if the idea is, well,\nI've got to establish that this particular government\nagency should have known about this.\nYou certainly can't sit back and say, well,\n5 years has gone by and -\nMR. WALL: Mr. Chief Justice, they can't\npoint to a single case where it has been difficult here,\nand it hasn't been difficult -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: They can't point to\na single case?\nMR. WALL: Where it's been difficult in\norder to make that determination. And it hasn't proven\ndifficult -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you think it's\nsignificant if you can't point to a single case?\nMR. WALL: Well, I think there are -- where\nyou should expect those cases to exist, yes.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Are -- are there cases\ndiscussing whether or not a government agency has been\ndiligent in pursuing a fraud, a fraud investigation?\nYou see, in the private context we have some sense of\nwhat the plaintiff has to do to protect the plaintiff's\nrights. He has to be diligent. But to transpose that\nto a governmental agency -- suppose the agency's over -\noverworked or underfunded? I don't -- which way do you\ncome out when the government says that?\nMR. WALL: Justice Kennedy, not just this\nstatute. There are other statutes, the False Claims Act\nand others, that have specific provisions requiring\ncourts to determine when a government official would\nreasonably have been on notice of certain circumstances.\nThat hasn't proven difficult in those contexts. It's\nnot difficult here.\nJUSTICE ALITO: What about the question that\nJustice Kennedy just asked? What if a claim could have\nreasonably been discovered by a government agency if it\nhad more resources, but given the resources that it had\nit couldn't have reasonably discovered the claim? Would\nthe discovery rule apply there?\nMR. WALL: I -- I don't think so,\nJustice Alito. I mean, I think we could say that there\nmight be circumstances where the Commission would be on\nconstructive notice and not a private plaintiff because\nof its expertise. It would see something in the public\ndomain that should be meaningful to it that might not be\nmeaningful to a private plaintiff -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The False Claims Act\nexample you give is indeed a private plaintiff kind of a\ncase.\nMR. WALL: That's -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, you can say the\ngovernment, having been cheated, should have known it\nwas cheated. But we are talking here about prosecution,\nessentially, prosecution for a civil penalty rather than\na criminal. By the way, doesn't the rule of lenity\napply whether the penalty is criminal or civil? So if I\nthink the word \"accrual\" is, at best, ambiguous,\nshouldn't the tie go to the defendant?\nMR. WALL: No. The court's been very -- I\nmean, in all of the civil cases applying the fraud\ndiscovery rule, the court has never looked to the\ncriminal analogies. The canon here is that ambiguities\nget construed for the sovereign, not against it.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But my question is broader\nthan that. Does the rule of lenity not apply to all\npenalties?\nMR. WALL: I don't think it applies in the\ncontext of a civil penalty. I don't think the -- I\ndon't think the -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Are you sure of that? My\nbelief is the contrary.\nMR. WALL: I can't say that I focused on it\nspecifically, but I think if the Petitioner said -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it's an important\nissue in this case, surely. I mean, if \"accrual\" is\nambiguous and we have a rule of lenity, we should\ninterpret it to favor the defendant.\nMR. WALL: Justice Scalia, I don't --\nPetitioner certainly couldn't claim that this civil\npenalty should have to be proved beyond a reasonable\ndoubt, or that they are entitled to a constitutional\nright to counsel. I don't know why one legal norm among\nthem all should change in the civil context and not the\nothers.\nJUSTICE BREYER: The reason would be that\nthe -- you know, once you start talking about applying\nthis to Social Security, for example, or to Medicare,\nfor example, or to DOD, for example, you have somebody\nwho did commit some fraud and they kept the money. You\nknow, she had five children not four, or she has five,\nnot six. And I can understand it being fair when the\ngovernment catches her -- you know, 18 years later, they\nsay, We want our money back. Okay. I say that's fair,\nnot necessarily merciful, but fair.\nBut then to go and say, and in addition we\nwant this civil penalty, even though -- of course, we\ncouldn't have discovered it. Don't you know there are 4\nmillion people who get Social Security or 40 million or\nsomething, and we can't police every one. And so\nsuddenly, I see I am opening the door, not just to\ngetting your money back, but to also you're having what\nlooked like criminal penalties years later without much\nbenefit of a statute of limitations.\nThat is at the back of my mind. And I'd\nlike to know, having brought it up front, what -- what\nyour response is.\nMR. WALL: Absolutely. There are anomalies\non both sides of the coin and I just want to touch on\nboth very briefly. Take the example you gave. In that\nsituation, the defendant's fraud or concealment the\nwould allow it or him to escape paying civil penalties,\nbut not private damages.\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's right.\nMR. WALL: This Court has never privileged a\nprivate lawsuit above a government enforcement action in\na securities context -\nJUSTICE BREYER: But this is not the\nsecurities context. This is the context of -- that's\nwhy I started down the road I was down.\nMR. WALL: But even in that context, imagine\nif there's a private right of action, the private\nplaintiff will be able to recover damages and the\ngovernment will not -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes, because you have two\npeople who are hurt, where two people have been hurt.\nFor example, I wrote the case in Burk and we had the\nstatute of limitations and Congress focused on this.\nAnd it wrote a two-tier statute. And it wrote a\ntwo-tier statute in large part because it was concerned\nabout the problem you mention. You have a victim. So\nyou're either going to let the defendant keep the money\nor the victim gets it back. I understand that, but this\nis not that context. This is like a criminal context,\nwhere not only are you getting your money back, but you\nalso want to assess a kind of criminal penalty. And in\nthat situation, I see a pretty clear line and I don't\nunderstand why the government is so anxious to change\nwhat has long been the apparent -\nMR. WALL: Just imagine the opposite, which\nis far more dangerous. Imagine a bank makes a bad loan\nto a veteran, or a bank tells the FDIC that it's gotten\nmortgage insurance to help lower income families buy\nhomes, and then that fraud or falsity escapes detection\nfor five years. The Veterans Administration or the FHA\nthen is barred from bringing a civil penalty action, and\nthere is no private right of action.\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's correct, you have a\nfraud and you can't put them in jail either, but you can\nget your money back.\nMR. WALL: But the reason there's no private\nright of action in those contexts is, in part, because\ngovernment agencies can seek civil penalties. And I\ncannot imagine that the Congress, which allowed agencies\nto seek civil penalties, where here they had existing\nremedies, would have thought that the only people who\ncould get away without paying them are the ones who\ncommit fraud or concealment and that remains hidden for\nfive years.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And the reason -\nthe reason there's no private action -- right of action\nis not because the government could seek civil\npenalties, it's because Congress hasn't provided a\nprivate right of action.\nMR. WALL: That's right because it thought\nthat the agencies could seek civil penalties and that\nwas sufficient.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Oh, no, your case-\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But it didn't -- it\ndidn't necessarily think, and that's why we have a case,\nthat they could seek civil penalties 10 years later,\n18 years later, however long, so long as they were busy\ndoing other things and didn't have a chance to know.\nMR. WALL: No question. And in the average\ntypical case, the time that Congress afforded is enough\nand we're not here claiming any different, but that -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And it is a generous\nperiod. It's -- it's 5 years. And, Mr. Wall, maybe you\ncan explain the SEC's pursuit of this -- of this case.\nThe alleged fraud went on from 1999 to 2002. It was\ndiscovered in 2003. The SEC waited from 2003 to 2008 to\ncommence suit. What -- what is the reason for -- for\nthe delay from the time of discovery till the time suit\nis instituted?\nMR. WALL: Justice Ginsburg, there was a lot\nof back and forth between the parties, document\nexchanges, they wanted to make additional submissions.\nThe government hoped that there would be a settlement\nthat would encompass all the defendants. Ultimately,\nthere was a settlement that only went to the fund and\nPetitioners did not settle and then the government put\ntogether and brought its case.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: But, Mr. Wall, I'll go even\nfurther than Justice Ginsburg. And this case actually\nseems to me a good example when Mr. Liman said there's\nno natural starting point and Justice Kennedy and\nJustice Alito referred to just -- this is a -- this is a\ndecision about enforcement priorities. The government\nhad decided not to go after market timers. And it\nchanged its decision when a State attorney general\ndecided to do it, and it embarrassed them that they had\nmade that enforcement priority decision, and then the\ngovernment made a different enforcement priority\ndecision. But that's not the kind of situation that the\ndiscovery rule was intended to operate on, is it?\nMR. WALL: Justice Kagan, I don't think\nthat's fair. We didn't go -- it wasn't market timing\nthat we discovered. What General Spitzer announced was\nthere are advisors that are permitting market timing,\nbut misleading investors about it and they're doing it\nin return for investments in other funds that they\nmanage, what are called sticky asset agreements, and\nthen we started doing market sweeps for those\nagreements.\nAnd I don't think we can ignore the evidence\nhere because we shouldn't decide the case based on\nfeverish hypotheticals. There are 25 reported cases\nbrought by the Commission involving this statute, 19\nwere brought within 5 years and they were just reaching\nback to pick up the beginning of the fraud. And the\nother six, including this case, the longest lag time was\nsix and a half years from the end of the fraud to\nbringing the complaint.\nAnd the reason is these are dynamic markets.\nThere's a lot going on in the public domain that puts\nthe commission on notice, inquiry or constructive, and\nstarts the clock running. Not only have we not seen a\n10, a 15, a 20-year case, we haven't seen a 7-year case.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, if all that's true,\nand this is a point I want you to -- I'm not sure I am\nright about this point, but remember your banking case\nnow, we're sounding like that, I thought -- doesn't the\ndoctrine of fraudulent concealment still apply? That\nis, if the defendant, in fact, takes any affirmative\naction to hide what's going on, the statute will be\ntolled. Is that right?\nMR. WALL: That's right, but that -\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. As long as\nthat's right, then in all your banking cases, there are\nbank inspectors all over these banks, I hope -- you\nknow, about once a month or so -\nMR. WALL: But Justice Breyer, that's -\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- or once a year. And so\nthe chance of there -- the chance of this somehow\nescaping notice without fraudulent concealment, which\nwould allow the government to extend the toll strikes me\nas small, but am I right?\nMR. WALL: Justice Breyer, I want to be\nclear. In the government's view, the concealment would\napply, though Petitioners or others like them will be\nback here making exactly the same arguments. The\ngovernment's point is just that equity fraud and\nconcealment were a pair and the justification was the\nsame for both.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, perhaps I've missed\nsomething. I -- I came in here thinking that both\nparties were willing to concede for purposes of this\ncase that there was a fraudulent concealment. Is\nthat -- is that wrong?\nMR. WALL: I -- I -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I mean, for purposes of\npresenting the statute of limitations issue that's\nbefore us.\nMR. WALL: I don't think the Petitioners are\ndisputing it here, but I think Mr. Liman acknowledged\nearlier that, if pressed, his arguments could be\nleveraged to get rid of the concealment doctrine, too.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: He didn't concede that\nthere was fraudulent concealment. All he conceded is\nthat there was fraud, but later concealment to cover up\nthat fraud I don't think has been conceded.\nMR. WALL: Oh, no, no, not -- I didn't -\nI'm sorry, Justice Scalia. I wasn't trying to mislead.\nThis is not a concealment case. This is a fraud case.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I thought it was the\nopposite. In other words, I thought both parties, for\npurposes of this argument, are assuming fraudulent\nconcealment has nothing to do with it. We are not to\nconsider fraudulent concealment.\nMR. WALL: This is a fraud case, not a\nconcealment case.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Am I right when I say that?\nMR. WALL: Yes. I was just trying to say\nthat once you say there is a concealment exception, the\nfraud exception follows from equity because they were of\na piece. And once you say there is not a fraud\nexception, the same arguments will be leveraged to get\nrid of a concealment exception. And the reason that\nequity treated them as -- of a piece was the deception\nwas the same. The fraud was self-concealing or even if\nit was non-fraud, the defendant could conceal, but\neither way -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Except that concealment is\nsort -- you know, it's sort of a self-starter. You -\nyou -- it -- it doesn't apply always. It applies when\nthere is concealment, and the person who is being\nsubjected to the longer statute of limitations is on\nnotice that if he fraudulently conceals, he's extending\nthe statute. So I -- I don't think that the one has to\ngo with the other. Maybe they're both equitable\ndoctrines, but that doesn't -- that doesn't mean that we\nhave to apply them to this statute.\nMR. WALL: Justice Scalia, for 300 years,\nEnglish and American courts looking at this problem have\nsaid where the defendant's misconduct, be it fraud or be\nit concealment of a non-fraud, but where the defendant's\ndeception prevents a plaintiff from knowing that he, she\nor it has a cause of action, equity suspends the running\nof a statute of limitations. Those -- that has been -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And for 300 years, that has\nbeen said only with respect to civil actions, not with\nrespect to the government's attempt to exact a penalty.\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's correct.\nMR. WALL: Justice Scalia, this is a civil\naction. I don't think even Petitioners are disputing\nthat.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I assume that we are on the\nsame ground, but I don't know that you have -- I mean,\nI'm worried about your giving up the fraudulent\nconcealment. I mean, you wouldn't give up equitable\nestoppel, would you?\nMR. WALL: If I gave up anything on\nfraudulent concealment, I didn't mean to.\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, no, no. I mean -- I\nmean, there's nothing -\n(Laughter.)\nMR. WALL: I want to be very clear, I give\nup nothing.\nJUSTICE BREYER: If we were to say -- if\nwe -- if the Court were to hold, it seemed to me, and\nthis is again tentative to get your response, but if the\n-- if the Court were to hold the discovery doesn't -\nrule doesn't apply, there's nothing in that that says\nequitable -- equitable tolling doesn't apply, nothing in\nthat that says equitable estoppel doesn't apply, nothing\nin that that says fraudulent concealment doesn't apply.\nNow, you've shaken me a little bit on the\nfraudulent concealment, but I don't know about the other\ntwo.\nMR. WALL: Well, all the same arguments are\ngoing to apply. Petitioners -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Oh, not the equitable\nestoppel.\nMR. WALL: Oh, sure.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Equitable estoppel, the\nperson comes in and says, oh, yes, I'll tell you all\nabout what I did, but by the way, I won't assert a\nstatute of limitations defense, I promise. And the\nCourt says, hey, you just asserted one, you can't.\nMR. WALL: Justice Breyer, Petitioners in a\nfuture case would be back here saying: The text of the\nstatute says nothing about equitable estoppel. And even\nif you've applied it to everybody else's actions, you\ncan't apply it to me because I'm somehow different.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And you will say nonsense\nin that future case, won't you?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. WALL: That's -- I'll be as right then\nas I am now.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. WALL: I mean, Petitioners' argument has\nthis sort air of unreality. You've applied it\neverywhere else he says, but not to me. Think how odd\nthat is, Justice Scalia, that where you have a\nbackground canon that says ambiguities get construed\nfor, and not against, the sovereign. When the sovereign\nsues quasi-sovereign to enforce the laws, that is\nsomehow a subordinate interest and the sovereign alone\ncannot take advantage of the Fraud Discovery Rule.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Wall, why is it that you\ndon't you have any cases? I mean, you said way back\nwhen: This didn't come up, this is a modern problem.\nSo explain to me why this is a modern problem. This is\nobviously an old statute. Are you saying that this\nstatute has not been used very -- was not used very much\nuntil very, very recently?\nMR. WALL: There are -- that's right. There\nare very few cases that deal with this statute at all\nand, obviously, in this context because the Commission's\nonly had the ability to bring civil penalties for about\n20 years.\nBut I think that is not a problem unknown to\nthe law. Again and again, facing garden variety\nlimitations provisions written just like this one, this\nCourt applied the fraud discovery rule. And now they\ncome in and say, oh, but you've never applied it to this\nstatute. That's true, but everything about this statute\nis identical as a matter of text and history to the\nstatute of Bailey.\nThe cause of action equally accrued there,\nand this Court's applied it across bankruptcy, land,\npatent cases -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: But what you're running up\nagainst is a skepticism, that -- you know, the\ngovernment, which has not -- asserted this power for 200\nyears, is now coming in and saying we want this. And\nthe question is why hasn't the government asserted this\npower previously?\nMR. WALL: I -- there are just very few\ncases on it. I think there are very few civil penalty\nactions that are being brought at all, certainly to\nwhich this statute apply, and certainly that deal with\nfraud or concealment and reach outside the 5-year\nperiod. And I don't have a great answer for why there\naren't cases. All I can tell you is that -- it isn't\nlike there are cases rejecting our arguments. We just\nsee an absence of case law.\nBut what we do see are -- is cases like\nExploration Company, where the government comes in, is\nreally suing in a sovereign capacity, to redistribute\nland from some private land owners to another by\nannulling their patents. And this Court rejects\nbasically exactly the same arguments Petitioners are\nmaking and says it applies equally to the government\nwhen it brings an action as to private plaintiffs.\nNow, an action for civil penalties? No, the\nrelief here is a little different, but if one looks back\nat the briefs the arguments are exactly the same. They\nmade exactly the same claims that the sky was falling\nthere, and for 100 years they have not been true. There\nis nothing important about this statute as a matter of\ntext, structure or anything else from the other statutes\nto which this Court has again and again applied the\nrule. And the justification is the same. It's the\ndefendant's misconduct which keeps the plaintiff from\nknowing of her cause of action.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, you made\nthe point earlier that it would be very odd that it's\nonly the sovereign that doesn't benefit from the\ndiscovery rule when other people can. But it's when\nit's the sovereign that's bringing the action that the\nconcerns about repose are particularly presented. You\nknow, the sovereign, with all of its resources, can\ndecide to go after whomever it discovers, however many\nyears after -- whether it's the Social Security\nrecipient that Justice Breyer mentioned or -- or anyone\nelse.\nSo I at least don't find it unusual that\nit's the sovereign in particular that doesn't get the\nbenefit of whenever you happen to find about it rule.\nMR. WALL: No question in the typical case,\nbut what equity has always said is in cases of fraud or\nconcealment the defendant is not entitled to repose\nuntil there is discovery of the fraud. And equity has\nnever looked at the identity of the plaintiff, the\nelements of the cause of action, the plaintiff's status,\nrole, party to what happened in the case. That is\nnever -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Would you agree that\nwhen we're talking about the interests in repose that\nthe one plaintiff that we should be particularly\nconcerned about is the government?\nMR. WALL: I -- I don't think that there's a\nbasis for separating as between private damages lawsuits\nand civil penalties. I think when Congress sets a\nstatute of limitations, that's a limitation on the\nvarious forms of -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What about criminal\npenalties? Would your argument be different with regard\nto criminal?\nMR. WALL: Justice Scalia -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Incidentally, what makes\nsomething a civil penalty? You just call it a civil\npenalty and -- and you don't have to prove it beyond a\nreasonable doubt, and you get the benefit of this\nextension that you are arguing for?\nMR. WALL: Justice Scalia, two very\nimportant things. Yes, our argument would absolutely be\ndifferent in a criminal context. In cases like Marion\nand Toussie, this Court has explained how statutes of\nlimitations function in the criminal context is very\ndifferent. They are presumptively not equitably tolled,\nwhereas civil statutes are presumptively equitably\ntolled.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What makes -- what makes a\npenalty a civil penalty?\nMR. WALL: In Hudson v. United States -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, a penalty is a\npenalty as far as I'm concerned if the government's\ntaking money from you.\nMR. WALL: Justice Scalia, the Court walked\nthrough in Hudson v. United States the test for\ndenominating a civil from a criminal penalty. The main\nthing is what Congress denominates it, although you can\nlook behind that.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's nice.\nMR. WALL: Here, there is no question that\nthis is a civil penalty. It was denominated by Congress\nthat way, it functions that way, it is phrased that way.\nI think even Petitioners and all of their amici -- not a\nsingle person on that side of the case has attempted to\nargue this penalty is criminal rather than civil under\nHudson.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That isn't my point, that\nit is criminal. My point is, it doesn't seem to me to\nmake a whole lot of difference as far as these issues\nare concerned.\nMR. WALL: Justice Scalia, the Court has\nalways said that whether the penalty is civil or\ncriminal carries with it a different set of legal rules\nor norms, and no party has ever successfully come into\ncourt and said, well, it may be civil, but it's a little\ncriminal-like, so I should borrow from the criminal\ncontext.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What about the -\nwhat about the Halper case?\nMR. WALL: Mr. Chief Justice, I think Hudson\noverruled Halper in large part, and no one here has\nasked this Court to label this a criminal penalty. They\nhave asked the Court to call this a civil penalty and\nyet say the fraud discovery rule does not apply. That,\nthere is no precedent for.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Liman, you have 5 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF LEWIS LIMAN\nON BEHALF OF THE Petitioners\nMR. LIMAN: Just a few points in rebuttal.\nFirst of all, with respect to whether this\nis a criminal penalty and whether the rules of lenity\napply, this Court has held in the Commissioner v.\nAckerly case that the rule of lenity applies to civil\npenalties.\nJust as an -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry. What\ncase?\nMR. LIMAN: I believe it's Commissioner\nagainst Ackerly. It's cited in one of the -- one of the\namicus briefs.\nSecond, the concession that you just heard a\nmoment ago, that the statute would not apply as the\ngovernment says it should apply if this was deemed to be\na criminal penalty, we submit under this Court's\nreasoning in Clark v. Martinez, it just gave away the\nstore in the government's case because if it is\npossible -- if the government has now admitted it's\npossible -- and I don't want to get into all of the\npermutations of Hudson -- but if it is possible that the\nlabel of civil penalty does not -- is not dispositive as\nto whether a penalty is civil or criminal, then, as the\nCourt held in Clark v. Martinez, the lowest common\ndenominator applies.\nOne has to interpret this statute so that it\nis applicable across the range of statutes. And if\nthat's so, then it follows, it runs from accrual as that\nword is commonly understood.\nNext point. The government said that there\nare no cases where the Court considered the -- the claim\nthat it is making. We would point the Court's attention\nto the Rotella case, in which in the context of a\nprivate plaintiff, who did not have the resources of the\ngovernment, the argument was made that the RICO statute\nshould have a discovery of the violation-type principle.\nAnd the argument was made there that RICO\ncan encompass a pattern of fraudulent acts. And the\nplaintiff in that case said, as the government says\nhere, fraud can be concealed, can be complex, can be\ndifficult to discover.\nAnd the Court unanimously had a response to\nthat. The response was that, at least as soon as you\nknow the injury, where there is an injury element, the\ndifficulty of discovery of the actual violation doesn't\ndefer the running of the statute of limitations. It\nwould defeat the purposes of the statute of limitations.\nThe government also argued that the problems\nof privilege are not significant ones. We would point\nthe Court's attention to the Joint Appendix in the\nSecond Circuit, where the government asserted privilege\nwith respect to our questions about its investigations\nof the counterparty to this alleged quid -- quid pro\nquo.\nThe Court also asked a question of whether\nthere are any cases in which courts have dealt with\ngovernment agencies being diligent, and the claim being\nthe government agency was not diligent. The Court has\ndealt with that in a related context, in the\nHeckler v. Cheney context. And in the Heckler v. Cheney\ncontext the Court held that that type of issue, how an\nadministrative agency treats facts that are -- that it\ndiscovers and whether it chooses to bring a claim or\nnot, whether it chooses to believe that they are in\nviolation of a statute, the agency is charged with\nadministering is not fit for judicial review. No\ndifferent result should apply here.\nJust two more points. The False Claims Act\nhas a -- which has an explicit discovery rule, also has\na statute of repose. It would be very odd, indeed, if\nthe one circumstance where Congress, one of the few\ncircumstances where Congress chose to use the word\n\"discovery,\" was where the government was injured, and\nthey -- Congress chose to impose a statute of repose,\nwhere, as they say in the 100 or other statutes that use\nlanguage, fraud-like language, Congress intended there\nto be discovery and no repose.\nAnd that really ties into the last point,\nwhich is that there are, by our count, if you look at\nfraud, misleading, false statement-type statutes, there\nare somewhere like 80 or 100-type statutes that use that\nkind of language that would be applicable if this Court\naffirms the Second Circuit.\nThis case was in -- the government says this\ncase was an outlier. There is no reason to believe this\ncase will remain an outlier.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nCounsel.\n"
