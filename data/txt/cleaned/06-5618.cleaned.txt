CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument

Mr. Dwyer.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL DWYER
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. DWYER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
The district court's 15-month sentence
combined with 3 years of supervised release conditioned
on drug treatments and the acquisition of a GED was a
reasonable sentence. In the uniform and constant
tradition of Federal criminal sentencing, the district
judge in this case treated Mario Claiborne as an
individual. She considered the guidelines and after
doing so turned to the judgment that 3553(a) demands in
every case. She issued a sentence to avoid unwarranted
disparity, to impose just punishment, and to ensure that
deterrence did not throw away Mario Claiborne's chances
to resume his responsibilities to himself, to his
family, and to his community.
The court of appeals, in contrast to the
district court's careful attention to the 3553(a)
factors, focused solely on the guidelines. The court of
appeals applied its extraordinary circumstances rule.
That rule re-tethers sentencing to the guideline.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: What would be your test
of reasonableness for appellate review?
MR. DWYER: I think a sentence would be
reasonable if a reasonable judge on the facts and
circumstances of that case would find that the sentence
imposed was sufficient but not greater than necessary to
satisfy 3553(a) standards.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: It seems to me that gives
very little weight to the goal, which I think is a
congressional goal, of nationwide consistency in
eliminating the disparities in the sentencing system
which cause great disrespect to the justice system.
MR. DWYER: I think that the statute speaks
of unwarranted disparity and does not speak in terms of
uniformity. And there is necessarily a tension between
the individualized sentencing that 3553(a) requires and
concerns about nationwide uniformity.
But I think that what distinguishes
sentencing under the advisory guidelines system from the
Presentencing Reform Act system are several. One is now
we explicitly have purposes of sentencing and factors
the judge must consider. 3553 didn't exist before that
time.
Secondly, in every case, as a practical
matter, the guidelines are going to exert a
gravitational weight because they are there. They must
be considered as part of the statute.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Can I substitute
"substantial" for "gravitational" without offending your
position or affecting your position?
MR. DWYER: I don't -- my position would be
that 3553(a)(4) is the correct place for consideration
of the guidelines. It's just one of seven factors. As
a practical matter, I think it's going to get --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Kind of a weak law of
gravity like the Moon. It's only at one-seventh.
(Laughter.)
MR. DWYER: As a legal matter weak. As a
practical matter, I think unfortunately it's going to be
very strong. And I think one of the real dangers of an
advisory guideline --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I guess the question
is how strong should we say or can we say, or can
Congress say it is?
MR. DWYER: I think that the strength should
be no more than one of the 3553(a) factors, because I
think the danger, particularly after 20 years of
guideline sentencing, is that courts will routinely and
mechanistically apply the guidelines instead of
exercising their discretion, which now runs to the full
limit of 3553(a).
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Then it seems to me that
to accomplish the goal that you want to accomplish in
this case, you almost remove the appellate courts from
the process.
MR. DWYER: I think the appellate courts
are -- I think Booker considered a very deferential
standard of review. The cases that the Booker Court
cited to illustrate the standard of review of
reasonableness were all highly deferential decisions
regarding revocations following supervised release,
affirming sentences that were many times what the
chapter 7 policy guidelines would require. The court of
appeals necessarily must be deferential or I think it
pushes the system back into a mandatory --
JUSTICE ALITO: Well, suppose the court of
appeals had done exactly what it did in this case, but
it said, we're not giving any special weight whatsoever
to the guidelines, we're basing this just on our own
evaluation of the sentencing factors that are set out in
the Sentencing Reform Act. Would there be a problem
there?
MR. DWYER: I think there would,
Justice Alito, because I don't think that the role of
the appellate court is to substitute its judgment for
the application and weight applied to the 3553(a)
factors for the district court.
JUSTICE ALITO: That's a principle that you
derive from what? From the Sixth Amendment? From the
Sentencing Reform Act? From where?
MR. DWYER: Well, I think it derives in part
from the Sentencing Reform Act, which contemplated
individualized sentencing.
JUSTICE ALITO: The Sentencing Reform Act
required, as enacted by Congress, required trial judges
to apply the guidelines, to follow the guidelines. And
you're saying that the Sentencing Reform Act now
precludes appellate review of -- it gives the trial
judges unlimited discretion or extremely broad
discretion?
MR. DWYER: Certainly extremely broad
discretion.
JUSTICE ALITO: How do you get that out of
the statute that was enacted to narrow their discretion?
MR. DWYER: Even under a mandatory
guidelines system that this Court considered in Koon, it
recognized that the Sentencing Reform Act also had an
important goal of individualized sentencing. And the
Court in Koon recognized that district courts in their
institutional position have a special competence to
determine what's ordinary in a case, what's unusual in a
case. The court of appeals lacks that special
competence. It sees only a tiny fraction of the number
of guideline cases. It doesn't have --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So one of the guides
for reasonableness review is what's ordinary in a
particular type of case?
MR. DWYER: I think that what guides the
court of appeals on reasonableness review is to look to
the particular case and determine if the reasons on the
record in that case, the district court's --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's impossible to
do in the abstract. If you're just looking at a
particular case, you have no idea whether 5 years is
reasonable or not. There has to be a background to it
so that you know that in this type of case, people
usually get a sentence of 3 years or they usually get a
sentence of 10 years. And it seems to me that what's
ordinary is going to be a judge -- a driving fact in
determining what's reasonable.
MR. DWYER: I think the court of appeals'
job is to ensure that the district judge provides
reasoned elaboration of its judgment on the facts of
that case that establish that the district court had
complied with 3553(a), and on the facts of that case,
selected a sentence which is sufficient but not greater
than necessary.
I don't believe that it is the court of
appeals' job, as was remarked earlier, to become a
sentencing commission and begin to reexamine and reweigh
district courts' decisions.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Even if you're
looking at not just the number, but the reasons. In
other words, the question I asked earlier, you've got
nine district judges, they all say we do not depart
downward for military service, and you've got one
district judge that says we do. It seems to me that if
the court of appeals can't review that to bring about
some uniformity in the factors that are appropriate to
consider, then it's essentially a lawless system.
MR. DWYER: I think it is not lawless in the
sense that courts of appeals need to determine whether
in a particular case, the differences it finds are
warranted on the facts and circumstances of that case,
whether the district judge has consulted the guidelines,
has looked at the history and characteristics of that
defendant, has looked at the nature and circumstances of
the crime. And if those reasons satisfy the court that
a reasonable judge looking at those facts --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: On my particular
case, what's the right answer for the court of appeals?
They've got two cases before them. One, the judge
departs three years because of military service. The
prosecutor appeals. The other, the judge refuses to
depart because of military service and the defendant
appeals.
Should those -- what should happen with
those two cases?
MR. DWYER: I think the same process of
review applies to each. And it may result -- and that
process of review is on the record in that case, would a
reasonable judge have arrived at that sentence?
And that review may result in both cases
being reversed, one, or the other, or neither being
reversed.
JUSTICE BREYER: Where does that come from
as a matter of law? That is, suppose -- now you can say
I -- if you want, say my hypothesis is wrong, but if I
start with an assumption that Congress did want the
court of appeals to try to create greater uniformity in
sentencing, and it wanted cooperation between the courts
of appeals and the sentencing commission, indeed the
sentencing commission itself is an effort to copy a
system that exists in Britain where courts of appeals
create a degree of uniformity.
Suppose I start with that assumption and say
that's what the guidelines were about and the reason
that number 4 is in 3553, it's not just one factor among
many. After all, it was attached to a bill that was the
guideline bill.
And indeed, the part we excised was a floor
amendment that came along later to make it even tougher.
So if I start with the assumption that's what Congress
wanted, not what I wanted, Congress wanted it, now is
there something in the Constitution that forbids it?
That's where I start -- I am starting
personally with that question in mind, always, if this
is what Congress wanted, we should try to do it unless
there's something in the Constitution that forbids it.
And is there something in the Constitution that would
forbid the court of appeals to do what on page 91 they
did here, leaving the word extraordinary out of it?
Now, just going through the different
elements of this case and coming to the conclusion that
what the district judge did was unreasonable?
MR. DWYER: I think there is a
constitutional problem with that. And it is that if --
it reinstitutes the mandatory guidelines system. And I
think if there is to be an effectively advisory system,
sentencing cannot center on the guidelines. The
district judge needs to be free to accept or reject that
advice and 3553(a), instead of the guidelines, becomes
the focal point for sentencing.
JUSTICE BREYER: It's not mandatory. It
says the district, the court of appeals judge says, now,
let's think here. We have 8 -- 7 people on the
sentencing commission that have really looked into that.
And they think that in an ordinary course with this
small amount of drugs, the person ought to get so many
months. That reflects a lot of thought. Seems
reasonable to us. And here the district judge is giving
him half that or 40 percent of that without a good
reason that we can find.
The judge said he did it because it was just
one little episode and we think there were many
episodes. And that's basically their reason.
Now, now -- what -- the Sixth Amendment
forbids that?
MR. DWYER: Of course, the court of appeals
did not adhere to your hypothetical in this case. In --
JUSTICE BREYER: Yeah --
MR. DWYER: The Eighth Circuit in this case
simply said it is not a guidelines sentence, it is an
extraordinary variance and we are reversing. The
district court has to consider the sentencing guidelines
and generally that must be part of the reason --
elaboration of judgment, so they will necessarily be
considered on appeal.
But the notion somehow that simply because a
sentence is in the guidelines, all disparity problems
have been resolved, is clearly not true. As the amici
briefs, and our brief have pointed out, even under a
mandatory guidelines system, racial disparity increased,
regional disparity increased. It's disparity that
individualized sentencing, the judicial discretion
necessary to do that kind of individualized sentencing,
can counteract. And that is genuine uniformity.
As -- as you pointed out in the Koon
decision, or the Koon pointed out borrowing your
language from Rivera, the district court's special
competence to determine what is ordinary and unusual is
exactly the kind of information the sentencing
commission needs to determine whether a guideline works
or doesn't work.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Aren't you really saying
that the most weight that the guidelines can be given,
or guidelines can be -- is that -- I apologize for my
voice -- the most weight the guidelines can be given is,
is the weight of necessary advertence? The guidelines,
in effect, are at odds with the rest of 3553(a). The
rest of them say individualized sentencing. The
guidelines, in effect, says, no, sentencing by the
guidelines.
Therefore, in order to -- to break this, in
effect, logical incommensurateness, on your view, I
think the most that you can concede is that before a
district judge sentences finally, he must show that he
has considered the value of uniformity as something
different from individualized sentencing, but that's as
much as he can be required to do.
Is that a fair statement of your position?
MR. DWYER: Yeah. And I think 3553(a), in
fact -- I expect Mr. Dreeben to say this -- talks about
uniformity, twice, in the sense that both 3553(a)(4),
which requires consideration of the guidelines, and
3553(a)(6) talks about unwarranted --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes. I -- I stand
corrected here. I'm sorry.
MR. DWYER: But I agree with you that it is
a consideration -- and I'm not talking about a check
list. I'm not saying that we just use a list and that's
enough. There has to -- I think sentencing under an
advisory system requires reason and judgment. We tried
to stress in our brief that judgment is somehow
different. It may involve fact-finding but is not the
determinant, the automatic jury kind of finding that the
guidelines require.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, as one of the themes
that you advance, you indicate that if your approach is
followed that the guidelines will then be adjusted over
time.
I assume they would be adjusted to be more
precise, but then we are right back where we started
because you want to give the guidelines very little
effect. It seems to me, in a way, you're arguing
against yourself.
If your view is accepted and the result is
considerable disparity, I suppose all that Congress can
do is have mandatory minimums.
MR. DWYER: I don't believe that, that the
results are going to be considerable disparity.
Certainly no more disparity than existed under the
mandatory guidelines which wasn't being addressed
particularly.
I think indeed there may be more
non-guideline sentences, but less true disparity,
because it really is kind of idle to talk about
disparity unless you are measuring it against something.
And 3553(a) provides those purposes, and true disparity
is measured --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Do you think it is idle to
talk about disparity before the Sentencing Reform Act
was adopted? You remember those days.
MR. DWYER: I do remember those days. And I
think there are two significant points about that. One,
judges sentenced in the pre-Sentencing Reform Act,
knowing that their sentence wasn't the real time served.
So that a judge may say 20 year sentence knowing the
defendant was immediately eligible for parole and was
going to get out soon.
The real number was parole eligibility
sentencing. So that looking at just the actual sentence
imposed did not tell you very much about disparity. And
none -- in the study that the sentencing commission in
its amicus cited -- that study explicitly said that none
of the studies looking at pre-Sentencing Reform Act
interjudge disparity considered actual sentences served
as opposed to actual sentences imposed.
JUSTICE BREYER: Yeah, yeah. But there --
you know, we can go back into that, but there was a
whole history that people testified, tremendously, no
opposition, virtually none, that you needed a judge
wheel. Why do you need a judge wheel in New York if, in
fact, the sentence didn't depend on the personality of
the judge? And why did you get different sentences
across the country which I don't -- I've never heard a
possibility of explaining that the judges didn't
understand what the parole commission was like. That's
a different issue.
So what -- what I'm concerned about is if we
followed your position literally, what we're saying is
that the Constitution of the United States prevents any
effort to create uniform sentences throughout the
country for people who different judges -- God doesn't
tell us what the right sentence is. We don't know.
There are reasonable sentences within a vast, vast range
of possible sentences.
And you're saying we have to go back to
that. And that wasn't -- I'm looking, in other words,
for you to tell me something that says we don't have to
be back to that, but we don't have to make it that rigid
either. And that's what I'm looking for, to be honest
with you, and I haven't -- I'm not certain I get it.
MR. DWYER: I don't believe that sentencing
under an effectively advisory system under the standards
of appellate review that I've described, which I think
is the standard Booker described, is in a sense an empty
exercise on appeal, and leading simply --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Could you describe it
again? Because I'm not clear what your answer was to
what the appellate court stance is. I take it the
appellate court would owe deference to the district
court's determination?
MR. DWYER: Yes.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: And no particular
deference to the guidelines?
MR. DWYER: That would -- yes, I would agree
with that.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: So what is it other
than -- is this arbitrary and capricious?
MR. DWYER: I think that the court of
appeals will first look to ensure that there was
reasoned elaboration of a judgment complying with
3553(a), that the district court considered all of the
factors and arrived at a judgment that this sentence was
sufficient but not greater than necessary.
Secondly, I think that the court of appeals
under that deferential standard of review that Booker
described would look to see if this is a sentence that a
reasonable judge would find sufficient but not greater
than necessary on those facts.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the -- one problem is
that two judges, both reasonable, might approach the
facts in this very case differently. That is, one as in
this case might think as she expressed it, to sentence
him to more than 15 months would throw away his life.
Another might say it's -- it's unreal to assume that he
just sold 23 grams of crack when he admitted that he had
been out on that same street every night for two and a
half weeks. So the quantity is much larger. And he was
in that sense a repeater, so I'm going to sentence him
to at least the bottom of the guidelines, nothing less.
Those could be reasonable determinations,
two different reactions that judges would have to the
same set of facts.
MR. DWYER: Yes. That is correct. And I
think that is what will result under an effectively
advisory system. But here we're talking --
JUSTICE SCALIA: In any case, you -- you,
you are not driven to the alternative that
Justice Breyer suggests, that there is no way to achieve
absolute uniformity. It's very easy. It was what the
dissenters in the Booker remedial phase urged, which is
use facts found by the jury and you can have the
sentences as rigid as you like.
It is really only, only when you want to let
the facts be found by the judge that you come into the
difficulty that, that we're arguing about. But it's
certainly not decreed by logic or by heaven that there
is no way to achieve determinate sentencing. There
certainly is.
MR. DWYER: I agree, Justice Scalia.
JUSTICE BREYER: Do you agree? Because I
think that system would, in fact, give total sentencing
power to the prosecutor, who would determine the
sentence by the kind and degree of evidence that he
introduced and what he charged. So I agree that that
might produce some kind of judicial uniformity, but only
because the prosecutor would have total power to decide
what the sentence will be.
MR. DWYER: Well, I -- I also appreciate the
dialogue. And --
JUSTICE SCALIA: You don't -- you don't have
to engage in our dispute here.
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE BREYER: We're pointing out there
are problems to every solution. And that's why I'm
still looking for the --
MR. DWYER: And -- and one of the serious
problems in the solution that Booker chose is that while
judicial discretion, which I think 3553(a) requires and
mandates, and an advisory system requires, that, too,
doesn't deal with the necessary exercise of
prosecutorial discretion which has an enormous thumb on
the scale, and which the district court, in the day to
day work of the criminal system in the courts, in the
district courts, has a far greater appreciation for,
than a court of appeals would.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Dwyer, before we get
to the prosecutor, you were candid in saying a district
court -- different district judges could act reasonably,
one of them giving whatever it was, 33 months, and the
other giving 15 months, both of those would be
reasonable and could be affirmed on appeal.
But one of, one of the arguments that was
made by defense counsel here was just there was -- there
is an irrational disparity between the penalty for crack
and the penalty for powdered cocaine.
Your predecessor thought that was so wrong,
he thought it was unconstitutional. I think at the very
least you ought to take into account that if this man
were distributing or possessed for distribution powdered
cocaine instead of crack, the sentence range, the
guideline sentence range would have been six months to a
year. Now we know that Congress wanted to retain that
disparity. Is a district judge free to say under
advisory guidelines, I am going to ignore the
difference, I'm going to treat this defendant as though
he possessed powdered cocaine?
MR. DWYER: I think that the judge in the
obligation of imposing an individual sentence must
consider the advice of the guidelines but must also be
free to shape and tailor that advice as the
circumstances of that case require.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, specifically, can
you take into account, can he say I'm going to treat him
as though he possessed powdered cocaine? Can he do
that? Yes or no?
MR. DWYER: Yes.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Even though we know that
Congress didn't want that to happen?
MR. DWYER: Yes, because I think if the
judge can elaborate reasons to justify that judgment in
that case --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's got nothing
to do with that case. That's got something to do with a
judgment apart from the particulars of the case about
whether crack should be treated the same as powdered
crack cocaine. It's got nothing to do with the
individual case.
MR. DWYER: Well, I beg to differ, Chief
Justice Roberts, because the differences were predicated
on assumptions about the type of individuals who would
engage in that. And the court in her experience could
look at it and say you aren't the typical crack
defendant, you are more like the people who come before
me who are involved in powdered cocaine, or you don't
possess the violence, the weaponry and the other things
that justified Congress's decision to create disparate
sentences for these two kinds of cocaine.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I think you ran away
from Justice Ginsburg's hypothetical just a little bit.
Let's assume that Congress wants to keep this
distinction and let's assume that there's no
constitutional problem with the distinction. There
might be, but let's assume.
Can the judge simply say, I ignore that
congressional -- congressional judgment is wrong. I'm
not going to do that.
MR. DWYER: I don't think that the district
judge's role is to make categorical pronouncements.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is the judge permitted --
JUSTICE STEVENS: To what extent is the
Congress's purpose later than the Congress that enacted
the statute we're construing? The statute we're
construing was enacted by one Congress and these
expressions came later.
MR. DWYER: Well, I would resolve the
problem by saying that the district judge must consider
the guidelines. The district judge doesn't sit in
review of the policy. It has to apply it to a specific
person. In a particular case, as in Mario Claiborne's,
that policy produced a sentence that would have been too
great.
And the application had some numbers to it,
so she said it was more serious because it was a crack
cocaine case, you're going to get more than somebody who
was involved with powder would get, but you don't need
to get as much as the guidelines call for, for the
reasons that she expressed on the record at the
sentencing.
If I could reserve the balance of my time,
unless there are other questions?
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.
Dwyer. Mr. Dreeben.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT
MR. DREEBEN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
This Court in Booker concluded that the
remedial severing of the statute's provision for
mandatory application of the guidelines and a provision
governing the standards of review on appeal rendered the
statute constitutional. It further implied a standard
of review of reasonableness of guideline sentences on
appeal, and it did not elaborate what that
reasonableness requirement means.
The Government submits that the best
interpretation of a reasonableness form of review would
be one that conforms as closely as it can to Congress's
original intent of minimizing and eliminating
unwarranted sentencing disparities between similarly
situated defendants.
JUSTICE SCALIA: As closely as it can, and
the "as it can" depends upon violation of the Sixth
Amendment by entitling defendants to sentences
determined by facts found by a judge instead of a jury.
Suppose in this case the court of appeals
instead of disallowing the lower sentence, approved it?
And then in the next case that comes up involving what
was the small amount of equivalent, 5.26 grams of
cocaine powder rather than crack, okay? Suppose in the
next case it would have been 30 grams of powder. And
the district court judge once again departs just the way
the departure was here, and the court of appeals says
no, that departure is unreasonable.
You now have circuit law which says 30
grams, you get the guidelines sentence; 5.26 grams,
you're entitled to a lesser sentence. Okay?
Why isn't -- why haven't we fallen back into
the same problem that produced Booker/Fanfan? You have
fact findings being made by the judge. It's a judge who
decides whether it's 30 grams or 5.26 grams. What
difference does it make whether that factual difference
produces an entitlement to a sentence on the basis of
the guidelines or on the basis of an opinion by or a
series of opinion by a court of appeals? Isn't the
Sixth Amendment equally violated?
MR. DREEBEN: Justice Scalia, as I think we
talked about in the last argument, in theory it could be
if this Court concludes that judicial determinations on
appeal are equivalent to guidelines promulgated by a
commission or statute, and if what the court of appeals
does is essentially function as a sentencing commission,
literally prescribing particular levels of punishment
for recurring sets of facts.
The Government's submission here is not that
the court of appeals has to do that in order to apply a
proportionality principle. A proportionality principle
will look to all of the facts of the case and will try
to get a handle on, is this a reasonable sentence in
response to all of the facts and circumstances that the
judge articulated within --
JUSTICE SCALIA: But if you have two cases
that are in other respects similar, and the court of
appeals has held 5.26 is too little to apply the
guidelines, it's okay to depart downward the way this
judge did, it seems to me that the next case that comes
up, the defendant has an entitlement to that lower
sentence.
MR. DREEBEN: Well, he doesn't, Justice
Scalia, because the second defendant may not encounter a
judge who concludes that that quantity warrants the same
level of leniency or any leniency at all. That judge
will retain the judge's classic discretion to look at
the totality of the facts and conclude whether a
sentence that would be below the range is a reasonable
sentence. And unlike a situation that some of us might
prefer in which the court of appeals would ensure that
like cases are treated with reasonable consistency, the
system of reasonableness review on top of advisory
guidelines will not produce perfect levels of
consistency.
And what the defendant is entitled to under
the Sixth Amendment rulings of this Court is knowing
that if the law says if I commit this crime and these
are the facts that support it, my level of sentence is
this and no higher, that any higher sentence that's
produced by a fact finding gives him a jury trial
entitlement. That's what the Sixth Amendment entitles
you.
But no defendant who commits a crack offense
can say that even after a series of court of appeals
rulings that mark out various points of reasonableness.
That defendant will not know whether the judge that he
or she appears in front of will give the same kind of
weight to those facts as some other judge did who was
affirmed or reversed. Nor will that judge be able to
say what is the constellation of policy and factual
reasons that this particular judge will find in
announcing the judge's sentence.
So I don't think that a proportionality
principle runs afoul of the Sixth Amendment. And I
don't think that it runs afoul of anything in 3553(a) or
any other part of the statute. What the Court is left
with is the task of interpreting reasonableness, and I
submit it should ask the same question that it asked in
Booker itself: Which alternative, the Petitioner's
alternative in this case or the Government's, conforms
more closely to Congress's original claim in the
Sentencing Reform Act?
The Petitioner's version of appellate review
as I understand it is very light review, if at all, of
the substance of what the district judge does. It may
reach a truly extreme case such as if a judge said a
second degree murderer, I think probation is the
appropriate sentence. Perhaps the Petitioner would
concede that that would be arbitrary and irrational; but
beyond such an extreme case that it is so unlikely to
arise that Petitioner can feel free to give it away,
Petitioner gives the Court nothing, and gives the courts
of appeals nothing to apply standards to determine
whether a particular sentence is reasonable. And that
is what the court of appeals have been reaching for when
eight of them have adopted this proportionality
principle.
JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this question:
It seems to me that in sentencing there are two
different broad categories of decision that the judge
has to make, one involving the severity of the crime,
and the other the characteristics of the particular
offender.
And might it not be the case that you give a
greater presumption of following the guidelines when
you're talking about the severity of the offense, and a
greater deference to the trial judge when you're
evaluating the factors of the individual that might
affect the sentence? There might be a difference in the
--
MR. DREEBEN: I think at a high level of
generality, that is true. Because what the sentencing
commission is good at is taking paradigmatic
circumstances and assigning them a numerical weight that
will transfer into a sentence. And what the strength of
the district judge is is looking at the defendant in
front of that particular judge and seeing how that
person's characteristics may map onto the policies of
sentencing.
But I don't agree that that distinction
would support a two-track form of appellate review that
would give the district judge greater deference to take
personal characteristics into account and to impose
widely varying sentences. That is exactly the situation
that we had in the pre Sentencing Reform Act era when
any district judge could choose whatever policies of
sentencing appeal to that judge, find the facts, and
impose a widely disparate sentence. And as the Court
well knows, there was no appellate review of that
exercise of discretion unless it could be shown that the
judge didn't exercise discretion at all.
Now it is not an exercise of discretion if a
judge simply says for this crime, I always give the same
sentence. That would not take into account the full
range of facts and factors that are present in the
sentencing court and as a result, that wouldn't be an
exercise of discretion.
But in the pre Sentencing Reform Act era,
the judge had pretty much plenary reign to decide what
facts mattered. If we continue with that same sort of
deference on appeal in the Booker remedial opinion, then
it's hard for me to see how appellate review can serve
any valid purpose of channeling and ensuring some
consistency and uniformity in the way district judges
impose sentencing.
JUSTICE BREYER: What do you think about
taking some of the Rivera ideas -- I'm slightly
hypothesizing this -- and following up with what
Justice Stevens said. You'd say look, one thing a
district judge can't say, he can't say that I believe
the guideline is right for a typical case. And I think
this is a typical case. And I won't follow the
guideline. You couldn't think those three things?
MR. DREEBEN: I agree.
JUSTICE BREYER: So one big power a judge
has that they didn't have before, after Booker, is to
say the guideline itself is unreasonable. So we're --
let's just say -- and there if they say that, the
district judge could decide whether or not, the court of
appeals could decide is the guideline reasonable or not
reasonable. But leave those cases aside. I imagine
they'll be few and far between.
Now we take one they assume is reasonable.
And now unlike the past, the judge has to do three
things. One, to give the kind of thing that -- the
reason he's not following the guideline, which he admits
is reasonable for a typical case. So what's the kind of
thing that leads you to think yours is not typical? And
he says it. And then he has the evidence as to the
related facts. And then he has the degree of departure.
As to the first thing, the court of appeals
could review it and decide whether it is or is not the
kind of thing. As to the second and third, they also
could review it but only after giving considerable
weight to what the district judge thinks about the case
in front of him.
Now maybe that's -- I mean, you might not
have a reaction to that. I'd have to sort of think
about it.
MR. DREEBEN: Well, Justice Breyer, if the
system that you're describing is a replica of the system
that existed under Koon versus United States --
JUSTICE BREYER: Not quite --
MR. DREEBEN: -- then it runs into the same
problem that led to the constitutional problem in
Booker. Where I think I would amend Your Honor's
proposal is that if the judge concludes that this is a
typical case but the guideline really doesn't prescribe
what I think is a reasonable sentence and here are the
reasons why, in the pre-Sentencing -- in the pre-Booker
system, that could have been problematic legally.
Today, it is not forbidden. But what it should be
subject to is a reasonableness review check on appeal
that take a look at what are the reasons that the
district judge articulated for that sentence.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Why, why do we assume that
the district judge cannot depart from the guideline
recommendation unless he thinks the guideline
recommendation is unreasonable? He doesn't -- does he
have to find it's unreasonable? There can certainly be
two reasonable sentences; and he's under no obligation
to select the guidelines sentence, is he?
MR. DREEBEN: That's correct.
JUSTICE SCALIA: So he doesn't have to
determine that it's unreasonable. I don't think we
should approach the discussion as though that's, that's
the situation.
MR. DREEBEN: I do think, though, that the
Court should be concerned about each district judge
formulating his or her own set of personal sentencing
guidelines and then applying them in the court to the
cases that appear on that judge's docket without any
check on appellate review to ensure that, although the
sentence might be in some possible world reasonable,
it's out of whack with what the Sentencing Commission
has prescribed and what other district judges are doing.
If there is no check on appeal, then I do think that the
clock has been turned back to the 1983 era before the
Sentencing Reform Act; and that does not seem to me a
reasonable interpretation of what the Booker remedial
opinion thought it was accomplishing. What the Booker
remedial opinion said that it was accomplishing was
providing an important mechanism that Congress itself
had intended, namely appellate review, in order to iron
out sentencing differences.
And our submission is that inherently means
some form of substantive proportionality review.
JUSTICE BREYER: That's the other thing I'm
not certain about, the proportionality, and the reason
I'm not certain of it is I'm not certain what it means.
That is, it sounds nice, as if you're saying something,
but proportional to what? I mean, I can think of two
problems. One problem, of course, is that the chart in
the guidelines is written on a logarithmic scale and
that means that if you move from one level, from 9 to
10, it's 3 months or 2 months; if you move from 29 to
30, it's 2 years.
Now, whether you're at 29-30 or whether
you're at 9 and 10 might depend upon things that just
have nothing to do with your reason for departure. You
might have added on something for having a gun and your
reason for being lenient might have to do with the
person's having a gun. So you're going to say it make a
difference whether you were high up or whether you were
low down, when your reason for departing has nothing to
do with whether you're high up or whether you were low
down? You see? It doesn't actually work, I don't
think, proportionality review, because it's so hard to
say what's proportional.
MR. DREEBEN: I think what is proportional
is a matter of common sense, and the eight circuits that
have been using this rule have not had a great deal of
difficulty in noting that you look at the extent to
which the sentence varies from the guidelines range, you
look at the absolute amount of time that's involved, and
have a sense of is this a significant deviation away
from what the guidelines would actually describe.
JUSTICE BREYER: Well, why use the word
"proportional," because the other thing is what the
Chief Justice brought out, is that why is it that if a
person has a bad reason, I mean, why should a bad reason
justify a little departure rather than a lot? And if he
has a good reason, well, why doesn't it justify a lot
just as much as it might justify a little?
MR. DREEBEN: If the sentencing court
articulates a bad reason, namely a reason that's
irrational or one that does not respond to facts of the
case, then that really shouldn't justify the sentence at
all and what the court of appeals should do is vacate
it, send it back for resentencing, and allow the
district court to articulate the reasons why the
sentence that the court now chooses to impose is an
appropriate sentence under 3553(a).
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Dreeben, if we could
focus on the facts of this case and what the district
court appeared to do, she made a kind of proportionality
judgment, too. She said this is a young man. It's his
first offense. He has a good family relationship, a
good work record. I am making a determination that will
put him away for a significant amount of time. But I'm
trying to figure the point at which he will lose touch
with his family, with his work, he will be thrown away.
That was the judgment that she made. She
tried to make a sentence that would be significant, 15
months, but that would not be so long that it would put
him out of touch with his children and his wife and his
work.
Now, in -- by some measures that would be
entirely reasonable. But on your measure, it isn't
reasonable.
MR. DREEBEN: That's right. And I think,
Justice Ginsburg, you've done a better job of
articulating a justification for the sentence than the
judge's own articulation, which did not focus on family
separation and employment to the degree that you have
now articulated it. What the judge did was focus on the
quantity of drugs and the fact that the defendant didn't
have any criminal history and that he qualified for the
safety valve.
She also said, without specifying any other
cases, that other cases that have come before my court
have had -- you know -- perhaps larger quantity of drugs
and very different sentences. When a court of appeals
is asked to review that line of reasoning and try to
decide whether the outside the guidelines sentence is
reasonable, it makes sense for the court to ask, do we
know anything, for example, about what this judge is
saying about other cases with other drug quantities?
There's no specifics in the record that enable the Court
of Appeals to measure the accuracy or the validity of
that observation. It's also relevant for the court of
appeals to say the guidelines range itself has taken
into account all of the factors that this judge has
previously noted and what has happened in the sentence
is that the judge has varied widely from the sentence
for reasons that the commission already took into
account. Now, that doesn't prohibit the judge from
relying on those facts, but it does mean that the
farther the sentence goes from the guidelines range the
more likely there is to be unwarranted disparity.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you did leave out
what -- she didn't elaborate on it, but she said, I
would be throwing him away. And I take it what she was
saying by that is it would be -- he would be
incarcerated beyond the point where he could reintegrate
into the community.
MR. DREEBEN: Well, this brings me to my
last point about this particular sentencing, which is
that in this very case Judge Jackson looked at the
defendant. She said, candidly I don't know really very
much about you other than what I've learned about in the
presentence report and I can't tell whether you're
unlucky or you're stupid, and then effectively gave him
a sentence that reflected, you know, a tremendous
indulgence of a presumption that maybe this kid needs a
wakeup call and nothing more. What she ignored is his
own proffer in the safety valve that he had been on a
street corner for 2-1/2 months selling crack cocaine,
that he was arrested and placed into the State system,
put into a pretrial diversion program through a drug
court, in essence being said, here's your chance, you
know, straighten up, we are going to be lenient on you,
we're going to give you an opportunity to reintegrate
with your family, and what did the defendant do but get
caught within 6 months with 5 grams of crack.
And on that record -- and this is what the
court of appeals said -- there's a disconnect between
the judge's conclusion that, with little information
more than what she had in the PSR, the kid deserved
leniency versus the fact that he had already had that
chance and he had not --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, but didn't the court
of appeals draw the inference that he had been
distributing drugs during that 6-month period and that
was not supported by the record? Am I wrong on that?
MR. DREEBEN: Well, Justice Stevens, we're
not relying on the inference of the --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Would it have been error
for the court of appeals to find a fact like that that
was not supported by the record and didn't it do it in
this case.
MR. DREEBEN: Well, supported by the record
is something of a judgment call. You'd have to assume
that Mr. Claiborne was found by the police, 6 months
after he had previously been arrested for crack
offenses, holding a 5-gram bag of crack and that was the
very first time after his arrest that he had been in
possession of drugs, that just he got extremely
unlikely, the police caught him.
JUSTICE STEVENS: And the court of appeals
is willing to draw a factual conclusion that he had in
fact distributed during that 6-month period?
MR. DREEBEN: That's right. And I would say
that a reasonable fact-finder could draw that
conclusion.
JUSTICE STEVENS: But should the court of
appeals act as a fact-finder in that posture of the
case?
MR. DREEBEN: Not in my view. And I think
on this record that's not a fact that we're relying on.
It's not a fact that the Government --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Is it not possibly a fact
that would justify the conclusion that they committed
error?
MR. DREEBEN: This aspect of the court of
appeals opinion in my view is not essential to the
judgment that it reached, which is correct.
JUSTICE STEVENS: It may not have been
essential, but it may have contributed to their
judgment.
MR. DREEBEN: It may have, but what they did
not mention is an equally validate reason for concluding
that this is a defendant who is in effect a recidivist
even though he had no criminal history. He had been
previously arrested for crack distribution crimes. He
had admitted that this was not -- the occasion of his
arrest wasn't the first opportunity that he had to deal
crack. He'd been doing it for 2-1/2 months. And the
judge essentially turned all of those facts off. She
did not really factor that into her sentence at all.
And the court of appeals, although it may
have fastened on the wrong time frame in concluding that
this defendant was in effect a recidivist and not the
sort of blameless ingenue that the trial judge had
treated him as, the record does indeed support the court
of appeals' central conclusion, which is this defendant,
despite his criminal history, really looks more like a
recidivist. And when you're talking about a defendant
whose mandatory minimum sentence would have been 5
years, but who gets out of that sentence because he
satisfies the safety valve which allows defendant who is
a first-time offender and meets certain other
requirements to get a sentence under the mandatory
minimum, that defendant's culpability had already been
substantially reduced under the guidelines because of
the safety valve and because of his criminal history.
And the judge basically said: I'm going to take a
chance with him and give him a much lower sentence than
what the guidelines described.
Our view is the judge can look at the facts
she looked at, but she went down to a level that is
productive of unwarranted disparity.
JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask just one other
question? I do not understand you to argue that the
court of appeals can apply a presumption of
unreasonableness just because there's a departure.
MR. DREEBEN: That's correct. We're not
arguing for a presumption of unreasonableness on appeal.
We're arguing for a presumption of reasonableness for a
guidelines sentence. For an out of guidelines sentence
there is no presumption that it is unreasonable, but the
court of appeals under a proportionality analysis would
look and require increasingly strong reasons with the
increasing degree of variance from --
JUSTICE BREYER: That's the part, they said
that. An extraordinary reduction must be supported by
extraordinary circumstances. What worries me about that
it sounds like a slogan. I would think an extraordinary
reduction must be supported by whatever reasons that
justify the extraordinary reduction, period.
And it also sounds like you're going to
start getting a mechanical set of charts and things,
which is going to be a true nightmare, and if we really
were to repeat that it would take on a tremendous force
of generative law which would worry me quite a lot
because I just think it's too complex to reduce to a
formula. What you want is a reason that supports the
sentence.
It is --
MR. DREEBEN: I think you want a better
reason for a sentence that is farther away from some
mean.
JUSTICE BREYER: Better than what? Better
than justifies it?
MR. DWYER: Perhaps the best way to do this
is to give a example. Suppose that the shoe were on the
other foot. Suppose that Judge Jackson had looked at
this defendant and said, you know, this defendant did
not learn from his experience. He was given leniency in
the State court. He didn't take advantage of that
opportunity. His statutory maximum is 20 years and I'm
going to give him, maybe not the statutory maximum, I'm
going to give him an 18-year sentence, or suppose she
said a 15-year sentence or a 10-year sentence.
I submit that in that circumstances the
Petitioner would be here saying, well, the guidelines
recommended a sentence of between 37 and 46 months and
this is a dramatic increase from that and the reason is
not something that's particularly unusual, it's a very
usual reason, and as a result, the magnitude of this
deviation is unreasonable.
And I have no problem with a Petitioner
making that argument if that's what happens to his or
her client. My problem is that without that kind of
anchoring effect of the guidelines in a proportionality
review, a court of appeals has almost nothing to work
with.
JUSTICE SCALIA: But what happens when that
case -- it goes back down to the district court. The
district court says well, okay, not 10 years. Nine
years. Okay? It goes back up. I mean, you know, when
do we end this game? Or does the court of appeals take
over the sentencing function and specify -- you know,
five years?
MR. DREEBEN: Justice Scalia, I don't think
that the courts of appeals are, at least absent very
unusual circumstances, to act as sentencers to specify a
sentence. There have been a couple of instances where
courts of appeals have said this is really the bottom
sentence that we can see that would be reasonable on
this particular constellation of facts. I think that
reflect as sense of potential impatience with a
ping-pong game that would occur if the court of appeals
says your sentence is unreasonable, Mr. District Judge,
and the district judge imposes a sentence that's one day
lower.
Another solution to that problem would be
reassignment to a different judge who would start with a
clean slate and could read the court of appeals' opinion
and apply the section 3553 factors.
We are not suggesting that the court of
appeals should assume the sentencing role here. All
we're suggesting is that the court of appeals needs to
have some intelligible legal principles that allow it to
identify and select unreasonable sentences versus
reasonable sentences; and when you have wide statutory
ranges as you do in the Federal system, if you don't
have the guidelines describing at least a benchmark,
it's not more, then I don't think courts of appeals have
a good, coherent, consistent way of fulfilling their
tasks. And if the courts of appeals can do that, can
look more with greater scrutiny at a sentence the
farther that it goes outside the guidelines range,
without violating the statute and without violating the
Constitution, then it seems to me the only thing for the
Court to ask at that point is which approach, that
approach of proportionality, or and approach that
basically says appellate review is procedural only,
absent the most glaringly aberrant sentences, conforms
to Congress's intent of producing a greater degree of
uniformity and consistency.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it wouldn't be, just
be procedural only. You -- you could say procedural
plus, you know, certainly review of the facts on, on
which the district court was -- was proceeding. So you,
if you could find that the determination that this was
just a good kid who made a mistake is, is an
unreasonable finding, you could reverse for that reason.
MR. DREEBEN: That -- that is true. But I
submit that -- I would like to hear what Petitioner has
to say. If Petitioner's client had been given 10 years
in this case, I have no doubt that Petitioner would be
arguing that's an unreasonable sentence. But I don't
see how you reach that judgment assuming that the court
has articulated a rationale that's consistent with
section 3553 and a rational interpretation of the facts,
unless you have the guidelines as an anchor for the
analysis.
Thank you.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.
Dreeben.
Mr. Dwyer, you have two minutes remaining.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL DWYER,
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. DWYER: I believe that Justice Breyer
put his finger on one of the central problems with the
Government's proposed rule. And that is what does it
mean? The Government talks about substantial variances
in Petitioner's case. The court of appeals spoke of it
as extraordinary variances. And the Government doesn't
suggest to us that substantial means the same thing or
means something different from extraordinary. And we've
already demonstrated in our brief why relying on
percentages as the court of appeals also did, is
pointless, because, one, if -- the arithmetic gets very
complicated at the low end and the percentages just
don't make any sense from a proper application of a rule
of law.
The Government's proposal, apart from having
no basis in the statute and no basis in Booker, is just
not susceptible of any kind of application because
nobody really knows what it means.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What about Mr.
Dreeben's parting challenge? What are you going to do
if your client gets 10 years? You're going to argue
that's an extraordinary departure from the guidelines,
right?
MR. DWYER: I'm certainly going to argue
that under the facts and the record before the Court,
that was not a sentence that was sufficient but not
greater than necessary. And I think the absence of a
prior record, the young man's work history, all of those
factors, the low amount of crack cocaine involved, his
age, all of the things which as Justice Ginsburg pointed
out that judge relied on in her sentencing decision,
could not possibly support a 10-year sentence.
And you know, it is easy to do this in a, in
a hypothetical sort of way. But the district judge --
and this was a very experienced district judge --
looking at the person in the eye, made a call based on
judgment. And that call was not treated with any
respect in the court of appeals. It was sloganeered
away as an extraordinary variance. And -- because the
court of appeals focused only on the guidelines.
The -- this Court in crafting the appellate
standard can't just look to determine what Congress
might have intended because of the constitutional
problem that lurks behind it. And that constitutional
problem is a resumption of mandatory guidelines.
Thank you very much.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel.
