Young.\nMr. Gupta?\nORAL ARGUMENT OF DEEPAK GUPTA\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. GUPTA: Thank you, and may it please the\nCourt:\nAll 50 States have public records laws. 47\nof those States make access available to residents and\nnonresidents on equal terms. Virginia, by contrast,\nenforces a discriminatory access policy, and, because\ncommercial requesters make up the vast majority of\nrecords requesters, out-of-State businesses bear the\nbrunt of Virginia's policy.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: When -- when was the first\nof those laws enacted? Do you know? I think it's -- I\nthink it's in my adult lifetime that Florida was the\nfirst to enact a sunshine law. Is that -- am I correct\nabout that?\nMR. GUPTA: That's right. All of these\nlaws -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: In the '60s.\nMR. GUPTA: In the '60s and the early '70s. The\nVirginia law was enacted in 1968. And we don't deny\nthat -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And you say that's a\nfundamental -- that's a fundamental right covered by\nPrivileges and Immunities Clause, which nobody had until\nthe 1960s?\nMR. GUPTA: Well, to be clear, the modern\ntransparency laws are new, but they sit on top of\nwell-established common-law right -- rights to access\nthat are based, not on modern notions of transparency,\nbut on the right to secure property and other basic\ninterests -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But those -- those rights\nstill exist in this State, don't they? Cannot you get\nrecords of deeds and whatever the common law would have\ncovered?\nMR. GUPTA: Well, it's true that -- that\nVirginia's law exempts deeds from its Freedom of\nInformation law, but, if I understand their position\ncorrectly, they would be entitled, as a constitutional\nmatter, under their theory, to preclude people from\nother States from accessing even deeds.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I'll ask them -- I\ndidn't understand that to be their position, but -- but\nI guess we can ask them. MR. GUPTA: Well, my\nclient, Mr. Hurlbert,\nis in the business of gathering property records for his\nclients. Now, it's true that, in Virginia, he could get\nthe deed, but what he can't get and what he principally\ngathers for his clients are real estate tax assessment\nrecords, and those are a much richer storehouse of\nproperty-related information than simply the deed.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Can you -- can you\nexplain that business a little more fully than you did\nin the briefs? He's in the business of collecting\nrecords from all the States about tax assessments.\nMR. GUPTA: That's right.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And he -- and he does\nthat for a client who could very well ask himself. So\nwhat is the service that's being performed?\nMR. GUPTA: Well, he -- you know, he doesn't\njust do the routine request. The -- the large data\ncompanies are the ones who hire him. And they -- if\nthey're routine requests, they can do them themselves;\nalthough if they're not based in Virginia, they would\nstill have to hire a Virginian to do it.\nBut they bring him in when there's some flaw\nin the -- the routine process where the -- the State is\nbeing recalcitrant or the local official is being\nrecalcitrant. And he's an expert in being able to gather\nthese -- these records and knowing the process is\nknowing what he's allowed to do and what he's not\nallowed to do.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: All -- all he has to\ndo is get somebody from -- from Virginia to ask for him,\nright?\nMR. GUPTA: Well, he could hire someone from\nVirginia to do that, but that's -- you know, that's sort\nof precisely what the -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but you don't\nhave to pay the person too much, he just has to write a\nletter saying, give me these documents, right?\nMR. GUPTA: He would still have to hire\nsomeone, and that would be an increased cost. And -- for\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, an increased\ncost of -- I don't know how much -- 100 bucks, right?\nGo -- write a letter, say you want these documents, and,\nwhen they come to your house, give them to me.\nMR. GUPTA: Yeah. For the large data\ncompanies -- you know, they will hire someone other than\nhim to perform this service. They will -- if you're\ntalking about routine requests. But even -- you know,\neven for them, if you're talking about a -- a request\nthat isn't routine, if he has to do something further to\nenforce the rights, he's going to have to do that in his own\nname, or the data company will have to hire someone\nother than him, someone based in Virginia, to do that\nfor them. And then he will lose that business.\nSo the lower you go down in the food chain\nof the data industry, the bigger the effect of\nVirginia's policy.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: How much -- how much of\nan impact, in fact, does it have on his business? I\nmean, there are 47 States who will provide this\ninformation.\nMR. GUPTA: Well, for -- for him, in the\nVirginia market, it completely forecloses him from doing\naccess -- business in the Virginia market.\nAnd, if other States were to have policies\nlike this, he wouldn't be able to do business in those\nStates as well. So if -- if the focus is on him and his\nbusiness in Virginia, it completely cuts him off.\nIf the focus is on -- on what the effect is\nin the aggregate, on the market as a whole, because most\npublic records requests are commercial requests, it's\ngoing to have an effect on most commercial requesters\nwho are out-of-State. And -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Gupta, I -- I\nunderstand that the -- the reasoning of Virginia in not\nallowing out-of-State people to -- to get these FOIA requests\nis the following: That the purpose of these -\nthese laws -- and I remember it when the first ones were\nenacted -- government in the sunshine. The purpose of\nit was not to enable people to get information, per se;\nit was to enable people to see how their government is\nworking, so that they could attend to any malfeasance\nthat is occurring in the process of government.\nIt seems to me entirely in accord with that\npurpose of these laws to say it's only Virginia citizens\nwho -- who are concerned about the functioning of\nVirginia government and ought to be able to get whatever\nrecords Virginia agencies have.\nWhat's -- what's wrong with that reasoning?\nMR. GUPTA: A few responses, Justice Scalia.\nFirst, transparency was one purpose, but, as\nI said, these laws also carried forward the much more\nlongstanding rights to access based on personal\ninterests and property interests. Also, even at the\ntime that these laws were enacted -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But -- but you don't need\nany personal or property interest under these laws. You\ncan just -- just out of curiosity, if you -- if you were a\nVirginian, at least, in Virginia, even though you have\nno interest in the matter at all, you can ask the agency\nfor records about this or that. It -- it can't be\nbased on -- on the\ntraditional property interest. It's based on the\nability of the citizens of the State to find out what\nthe -- what the government of the State is up to.\nMR. GUPTA: Even -- even at the time that\nthese laws were enacted in the -- in the '60s, it was\nwell-understood that they were going to have a big\ncommercial impact. The property records industry was in\nfull swing by the end of the late 19th Century.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But the point is that\nFOIA is tied to, as Justice Scalia said, the citizens\nshould know what their government is doing. And you\ndon't have to give any reason at all, if you were a part\nof that political community. Now, Virginia doesn't\nallow people from out-of-State to vote. They're not\npart of Virginia's political community.\nSo why isn't this -- if you're not part of\nthe political community, then you don't fall under FOIA,\nwhich is a peculiar statute, in that everybody who is\ncovered by it can get whatever they want, and they don't\nhave to give any reason for it.\nMR. GUPTA: Right. Well, elections just\nsimply don't work if you -- if you allow noncitizens to\nparticipate in elections or if you can't wall off the\nState in that respect. But what the State can't say is,\nsimply because one purpose of this law is that we want\nto constitute ourselves as a political community, that\nwe can exclude activities that have a big commercial\neffect.\nAnd -- you know, when we're looking under\nthe Dormant Commerce Clause or under the Privileges and\nImmunities Clause, this Court's cases have said\nrepeatedly you don't look to uncover the original\nlegislative purpose, you look to whether there is\ndiscrimination, which there is here, on its face, and\nyou look to whether there is a discriminatory effect.\nOne example of how this policy is actually\nbeing -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: And is the only thing that's\nnecessary -- excuse me -- is the only thing that's\nnecessary that the law affect a few people commercially?\nI mean, how much -- how many of the requesters have to\nbe engaged in some kind of commercial activity in order\nfor your arguments to work?\nMR. GUPTA: Well, what this Court has said\nis that there is no de minimis exception, if there's\ndiscrimination against commerce, but, here, what's going\non is anything, but de minimis. Virginia does not deny\nthat the -- the vast majority of the requesters are\ncommercial requesters -- the vast majority of out-of-State\nrequesters are commercial requesters.\nTheir -- the amicus brief supporting their\nside, the Local Government Attorneys of Virginia amicus\nbrief, at page 30, explains the way this policy -\npolicy is being implemented, is that noncommercial\nrequests are typically honored, but out-of-State\nrequests by data miners are being categorically denied\nunder the policy.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But this -- this is\nnot -- this is not a regulation of commerce. It's a\nState practice that may have an incidental effect on\ncommerce, and the incidental effect may be\ndisproportionate, depending upon whether you're State or\nlocal, but it's not a regulation of commerce.\nMR. GUPTA: But that's -- that was the\nFourth Circuit's theory, and I think incidental can mean\na few different things, and I think in -- in their\nopinion, it -- it does mean at least three different\nthings. So maybe it would be helpful if I try to unpack\nthat.\nIf it means incidental in terms of the\neffect on my client's business, I think, as I've\nexplained, it's anything, but incidental; it completely\nforecloses him from the market. If it means incidental\nin terms of the -- the aggregate effect of this statute,\nagain, it's not incidental because the vast majority\nof -- of affected parties under this policy are\nout-of-State commercial requesters, particularly data\ncompanies.\nAnd -- you know, if it means incidental\ncompared to the purpose of the statute, as I've said,\ntransparency was one purpose of the modern FOIA laws,\nbut they also subsumed and sit on top of all of the\nlongstanding rights of public access that have been\naround since the -- the first settlements in the United\nStates -- or before the United States, when, in order to\nhave a functioning property system, we recognized that\nyou've got to have records of who owns what and -- and\nthose records have to be made available to anyone in\norder to exercise property rights.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if the State of\nVirginia says, as a policy, we want to help Virginia\nbusinesses, and so we're going to open a business\ntraining, best practices institute, where you're going\nto learn how to be a better business person, but the\nonly people who can come in are -- are Virginia\nbusinesses.\nMR. GUPTA: Right.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Under your theory,\nbecause that will have an effect -- an incidental effect on\ncommerce in a way that's discriminatory, is -- is\nthat unconstitutional?\nMR. GUPTA: I don't think so. And there are\na couple of distinctions.\nFirst, that's not something that the State\nexclusively is able to provide. It's not like the\ncourthouse or the public archives across the street or\nthe road that runs between them that only the -- the\nState is able to provide.\nAnyone can provide a business training\ninstitute, so the State is just one player among many.\nAlso -- running a\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But that -- that just goes\nto the extent of the impact, not -- not on the\nprinciple. And you say extent doesn't matter. You say\nthere's no such thing as a de minimis exception.\nMR. GUPTA: No -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So that -- that explanation\ndoesn't -- doesn't seem, to me, to hold water.\nMR. GUPTA: Well, maybe I didn't explain it\nvery well. To be clear, I think it's more than just a\ndifference in degree; it's a difference in kind. These\nare fundamentally different when -- when you're talking\nabout running the courthouse or running the public\narchives, nobody else can do that. Nobody else\ncan collect -- you know, make\ntax assessments, collect those records, and keep the\nofficial public archive of those things. That -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So what? So what? Except\nto the extent that that bears upon how much of a -- an\nimposition this is upon interstate commerce. It seems,\nto me, that's the only relevance of that point.\nMR. GUPTA: Well -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And -- and you dismiss that\nrelevance. You say it doesn't matter how extensive the\nimpact is on -- on interstate commerce.\nMR. GUPTA: Well, to the extent that you -\nyou think it does matter, I mean, that -- that\ndistinction doesn't matter in this case because the\nimpact is -- is great. The principal impact is an\nimpact on out-of-State commerce.\nBut let me -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is that -- when\nyou're talking about impact, is that a Pike analysis?\nMR. GUPTA: No. I think this -- if you were\nin -- in the dormant Commerce Clause, this would be the\nper se rule of invalidity. You have facial\ndiscrimination. The -- the -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I thought, if\nit was facial discrimination, you're not concerned about\nimpact.\nMR. GUPTA: That's right. That's right.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I thought a question\nof talking about the effects on interstate commerce,\nthat's the -- you know, the Pike analysis.\nMR. GUPTA: No. What this Court has said is\nthat -- that the first -- sort of first-tier scrutiny,\nthe per se rule is -- is for cases where there's\ndiscrimination on its face or discrimination in effect.\nAnd then you've got this other category for the -- the\nPike analysis, where the State regulates evenhandedly.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: What's your closest case\nin support of the proposition that this is impermissible\nas a discrimination against interstate commerce? What's\nyour best case?\nMR. GUPTA: When you say, \"this,\" you mean\nthe -- that public records access is commerce?\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: If -- if you -- you are\narguing, as one of your arguments here, that this is\ndiscriminatory as to -- as to interstate commerce, as I\nunderstand your argument, what is the best case you have\nto support your position? What's the closest case?\nMR. GUPTA: Well, I think if you're -- if\nyou're -- if the question is about whether or not\nrecords access is commerce, there's Reno v. Condon this\nCourt's unanimous decision -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, my question is\nwhat's the best case you have for your argument?\nMR. GUPTA: Well, I think -- you know, this\nCourt's unanimous decision in Reno v. Condon held that,\nbecause people buy public records and sell them in\ninterstate commerce, that's, indisputably, interstate\ncommerce. So we -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But that wasn't a\ndiscrimination. That wasn't a -\nMR. GUPTA: That's right.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: That's just -- that goes\nto the question whether or not this is commerce.\nMR. GUPTA: That -- that's right.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: What -- what is your best\ncase to show that this is discriminatory in violation of\nour precedence?\nMR. GUPTA: Well, Virginia doesn't deny that\nthere's discrimination on its face, so I take your\nquestion to be asking -- you know, what about the\ncommerce aspect? And in Reno v. Condon -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Now -- if I have\nto write the opinion, what case do I put down? I'm\nwaiting.\nMR. GUPTA: Yeah, I mean, you -- okay. So you\ncan also look to Camps Newfound, which, I think -\nyou know, was much -- much more attenuated to commerce.\nThere, you had a generally applicable law, a property\ntax law -\nJUSTICE BREYER: If I only have time to read\none case -\nMR. GUPTA: Yeah.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- or possibly two, which\nwould you like me to read? I think that's, basically,\nthe question.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. GUPTA: Yeah. I mean -- you know, look.\nThere's no case that's -- that's entirely on all fours,\nbut -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay. But I assume you\ndon't want me -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: That's why you're here.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. GUPTA: So right. So -- so -- okay. So\nthe Camps Newfound case is -- is a case where you had a\ngenerally applicable law. It was a property tax law.\nIt exempted -- you know, charities that served primarily\nin-State residents.\nIt was -- there is no evidence that the\nState of Maine intended that to be a -- you know, a\ndiscrimination against commerce and, obviously, swept\nmore broadly and affected both commerce and\nnon-commerce. But this Court said that -- you know, you\nhad facial discrimination against commerce because there\nwere people operating these summer camps, and they were\ntreated differently -\nJUSTICE BREYER: I'll look at those. But I\nthink the Commerce Clause, basically, has, as its\nobjective, insofar as it's dormant, to prevent a\nlegislature or decisionmaker within its State\ndiscriminating in favor of their own State producers.\nMR. GUPTA: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Now, it's pretty hard for\nme to put this case into that mold.\nMR. GUPTA: Well, I mean, one -- you know,\none piece of evidence, Justice Breyer, is the media\nexception to the Virginia statute. It -- this -- this\nmakes it clear that Virginia was aware that people who\nwere requesting information for commercial purposes were\ngoing to use this statute and they exempted the press -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's just Virginia media,\nthough, isn't it? Isn't it only media that -\nMR. GUPTA: That's right, Justice Scalia.\nSo it's -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- exists or is broadcast into\nVirginia?\nMR. GUPTA: That's right. So it's -\nit's -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that's consistent\nwith their purpose, that this statute is meant to assure\ngood, honest government in Virginia.\nMR. GUPTA: Well, if this is a statute, it's\na pretty unusual statute that discriminates among\nnewspapers, so it says -\nJUSTICE BREYER: If it does what the -- I\nhad exactly the same question for both parts of your\nargument, that what it's their -- am I right in thinking\nthat anyone can get any information -- anyone in any\nState can get any information that pertains to him or\nher? Is that right or not?\nMR. GUPTA: There is a separate Virginia -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Is that right or not?\nMR. GUPTA: Yes. There is a\nseparate Virginia statute that allows this.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay. That's what I wanted\nto know, whether it's separate or not.\nMR. GUPTA: That's right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Anyone from Alaska to\nHawaii can get any information that pertains to him or\nher. Second, that this has nothing to do with\njudicial records, there is a different statute that\nmakes judicial records public.\nMR. GUPTA: That's correct.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay. So we're, now,\ntalking about the class of information, other than the\ntwo classes I've mentioned.\nAnd I then ended up -- and I'd like you to\nadd something to this, if you can, that, really, this is\nabout -- since getting information involves usually a\nbenefit to the recipient, but, sometimes, harm to the\nperson the information is about, that willing to run\nthat harm and risk of harm is the interest in State good\ngovernment, okay?\nMR. GUPTA: Uh-huh.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Now, if that's the\ninterest, that's an interest that probably a State has\nthe right, just as it has the right to say other people\ncan't vote in State elections, if that's the interest,\nthen I guess it could take reasonable measures related\nto that interest.\nAll right. Now, that is the -- the argument\nor the position that I would appreciate your addressing.\nMR. GUPTA: Sure. You know, that -- we\ndon't deny that that's an interest that the State has, but\nthen you have to see whether the -- the interest is\nreasonably furthered by the statute. And, here, you\nhave a resource that is not finite, and the statute\nallows the State to recoup its expenses.\nSo nothing is lost to Virginians. There\nisn't any loss in transparency to Virginians by\nextending access to out-of-State data companies.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But if it costs for\nVirginia -- Virginia has to take care of its own, and,\nif it has to service FOIA requests from all over, it's\ngoing to cost the State. It's going to have to hire\npeople to do this. They're going to have to spend many\nhours going through these records, so the State\ndoesn't -- it wants to conserve its resources for its\nown people.\nMR. GUPTA: But -- but there's no loss in\nresources, Justice Ginsburg, because the statute allows\nVirginia to fully recoup any administrative expenses.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, I'm having -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But they -- but they just\ndon't want out -- they -- they don't want outlanders\nmucking around in -- in Virginia government. It's\nperfectly okay for good old Virginians to do that, but\nthey don't want outlanders to do it. Why -- why is that\nunreasonable? MR. GUPTA: Yeah. That -- that is\ncertainly\ntheir interest. But you've got to see whether the\npolicy serves -- serves -- you know, the interest,\nand -- and this is a statute that is supposed to promote\ntransparency. It actually makes it less transparent.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, I'm -- I -\nthere is underlying your argument a sort of fundamental\nbelief that you are entitled to relief -- pardon the\nalliteration -- simply because the statute discriminates\nbetween citizens and noncitizens. Is that your\nposition?\nMR. GUPTA: No, not at all, I mean -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So if it's not, what are\nthe two rights that you -- or what rights are it that\nyou're claiming have been violated? You say privileges\nand immunities. What's the privilege or immunity?\nMR. GUPTA: It's the privilege or immunity\nof pursuing a common calling across State borders. So\nthere's no dispute here that Mr. Hurlbert's common\ncalling is -- is gathering data. In fact, those are the\nprincipal users of public records laws.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So is this -- is this an\nas-applied challenge to the -\nMR. GUPTA: That's right.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. MR.\nGUPTA: That's right.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So this is an as-applied\nchallenge?\nMR. GUPTA: Yes. So -- so it's an\nas-applied challenge with respect to Mr. Hurlbert's\ncommon calling. There's no -- there's no dispute that\nthat is his common calling and that this law has the\neffect of completely cutting him off from pursuing his\ncommon calling in the Virginia market and that 47 other\nStates -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Then you would be doing\nsomething very strange with this statute because you\nwould be saying Hurlbert has a right to this because\nit's his business. But the statute, the character of\nthis statute is it doesn't matter what you want the\ninformation for.\nBut you're saying the out-of -- the\nin-Stater, it doesn't matter. Out-of-Stater, is it your\nargument that, if this out-of-Stater has a good reason\nfor getting this and it's related to the out-of-State's\nbusiness, so you -- you're changing the character of a\nFOIA statute, which is it doesn't matter what you want\nit for.\nMR. GUPTA: Right. I mean, you would -- you\nknow, we would -- we would ask that you rule that the statute\nis unconstitutional, as applied to him, and then\nVirginia would have the choice, if it has a -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I -- I'm having a\nproblem, and then I think it's Justice Ginsburg's\nproblem, which is, absent the statute, he can't demand\nthat Virginia provide him with this information because\nthat's how he wants to work, correct?\nSo what's the added value that gives him a\nright to demand it merely because a statute exists? He\ndoesn't have a right to the information.\nMR. GUPTA: Well, he's -- all he's asking\nfor is information that's available in the public\narchives on equal terms with Virginians. In the same\nway that -- that someone who -\nJUSTICE BREYER: He -- he has a very\nreasonable request in my view, but the question isn't\nthe reasonableness of his request. The question's -\nyou know, whether they can do it. And the -- the way -\nthe work -- the thing that's bothering me on the work\npart is this: It seems that the work is sort of\ntailored to the statute.\nIt's in this way. I -- I have a job, and my\njob is to study election processes. And I write\nreports, and I find amazing things about differences\namong States. They're truly amazing. And I say\n-- you know, it would help me a\nlot if I was actually a voter in each of these States.\nThat would help my job. It would lend authenticity, and\nI could learn things that I probably couldn't learn\notherwise.\nNow, does that add anything to the argument?\nI mean, I don't think so, but it sounds a little bit\nlike you're making that kind of argument -\nMR. GUPTA: No.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- and -- and they either\ndo have the right or they don't. And I don't know that\nit helps that I -- that I say, well, I really want it\nfor my work.\nMR. GUPTA: Right. But this is -- this is a\nprofession that has existed since the founding era. I\nmean, we've -- you know, we've cited cases in our\nopening brief of -- of people hiring professionals to\nsearch the records for them before engaging in property\ntransactions. By the late 19th Century, you had an\nenormous industry that was designed to do this.\nSo this isn't -- Mr. Hurlbert isn't someone\nwho's making up some profession. He's part of a very\nlarge industry that has done this for a very long time.\nAnd that industry, yes, like lawyers depend on\ncourthouses or truckers depend on roads, his industry depends\non access to the public archives.\nAnd -- you know, it's true that -- that now\nyou have these modern public records laws, but I -- I\nthink Virginia's argument would be the same if you were\njust talking about can -- can they bar the doors to the\narchives building? Can they bar the doors to the\nproperty records? So there's no -- I don't see any\ndistinction in kind -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is this -- is this\nyour Privileges and Immunities argument or your dormant\nCommerce Clause argument?\nMR. GUPTA: You know, I think the logic of\nboth arguments are similar, but I think it, most\nclearly, is illustrated in the Privileges and Immunities\ncontext where -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So then it's not\nenough that this is a big deal to your client. It has\nto be something that is essential to hold the country\ntogether as a national unit. And it seems, to me, it's\na bit of a stretch to say somebody gathering records\nabout commercial -- under FOIA fits that description.\nMR. GUPTA: I don't think it's a stretch at\nall, Justice -- Chief Justice. The -- the aggregators\nof records make possible mortgage origination, credit\nreporting, insurance adjustment. The -- the economy -- and\nyou have an amicus brief -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, but, see,\nthey're just to get into those. Again, I think a lot of\nthose examples you -- you do have access under other\nstatutes. You're talking about mortgage rules and all\nthat. Aren't those all -\nMR. GUPTA: No, no. Not to this kind of\ninformation. The -- the information that Mr. Hurlbert\nis gathering, tax assessment information, is essential\nto -- to mortgage origination and credit reporting. The\npeople who hire him are large data companies, and the -\nthe data industry brief explains the uses of this\ninformation.\nThat -- that information is essential to\nthese activities. And Virginia, virtually alone among\nthe States, is -- is erecting this barrier to access\nthat market and reserving the right to access that\nmarket to only people who live in the State.\nAnd -- and -- you know, this would be no\ndifferent if it were just talking about the archives\nthat -- that include all the information that the -\nyes, it's true that Virginia has exempted of the title\nitself, but I don't see that the logic of their position\nallows them to make that distinction. I mean, that's\njust a feature of their -- of their statute.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could I -- I'm still trying to\ntease out what your claim is. Let's suppose Virginia\npasses a statute that says, We'll let nonresidents have\naccess, but they have to pay all the costs.\nNonresidents don't.\nWould that satisfy you as valid?\nMR. GUPTA: I think that would be a closer\nquestion, but I think that presents some problems as\nwell. I mean, so, in your hypothetical, it's free to\nthe citizens of the State, but they're just passing the\ncost on to out-of-Staters.\nAnd -- you know, this -- this Court, in\ncases like Toomer and Mullaney, have said that at\nleast -- you know, where the State can show that the\nnonresidents pose some unique evil, that the -- the\nState is entitled to pass the costs on.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Why isn't it just -- you\njust being costs them more?\nMR. GUPTA: Right.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That was Justice\nGinsburg's point, which is every time you've put in a\nrequest, you're costing them more money.\nMR. GUPTA: Right. But -- but that would be\ndiscriminating against non as -- noncitizens solely\nbecause they're noncitizens. So, if there's some particular\n-\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, why? You were\ncosting them more.\nMR. GUPTA: Right. Well, that's -- that's\nprecisely the rationale that -- that in\nJustice Kennedy's opinion for the Court in Barnard v.\nThorstenn, this Court rejected. This -- the Virgin\nIslands wanted to say if we open up our bar to people\nfrom all over the country, it's going to increase the\nadministrative resources. And this Court said, no,\nthat's not a good enough reason. That's just\ndiscriminating on the basis of citizenship.\nBut if, for example, the State could show\nthat there was -- you know, there were shipping costs\nthat were uniquely posed by nonresidents and they wanted\nto assess a $5 shipping fee for all nonresidents, that\nmight be permissible.\nAnd, if there are no further questions, I'd\nlike to reserve my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nGeneral Getchell?\nORAL ARGUMENT OF EARLE DUNCAN GETCHELL, JR.,\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. GETCHELL: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court: The -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm not sure how you\nsave administrative costs under this statute. They\ncould go to any Virginia resident, it's not illegal, and\nprobably will, it'll cost them something more, but not\nyou, and get the very same information.\nSo how do you justify this discrimination?\nBecause it's so easily -- the administrative cost is\ngoing to be imposed anyway.\nMR. GETCHELL: I would -- would suggest that\nthe purpose of the statute, which is political, not\ncommercial, left the State with the position that it was\ngoing to subsidize with tax dollars this function\nbecause we can't recover our overhead; we can over -\nonly recover the actual cost.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So you want to give more\nbusinesses to Virginia citizens who will now charge\nout-of-State residents money to process their FOIA\nrequests?\nMR. GETCHELL: No, Your Honor. I don't\nthink anybody was thinking about businesses of any sort.\nI think they were saying that we have a political\nhygiene statute. They were very much the fad. It\nhappened in -- in my lifetime, too. I remember when\nthey were adopted. Nobody thought they were commercial in\nnature.\nAnd I do want to -- want to repel the notion\nthat there is even substantial discrimination in this\ncase because Mr. Hurlbert, in his admission that this is\nan as-applied challenge, has a difficulty with\nsubstantial equality of access, because it turns out\nthat Mr. Hurlbert, in his reply brief, when he teed up\nthe 1786 statute, which does give access -- did give\naccess, he focused his argument on that statute.\nAnd if you run that statute, you will find\nthat between 1830 -- 1813 and 1840, that you did not\nhave general access. They went back to having to show a\nparticular interest. But that -- from 1840, '41 until\ntoday, through the codes of 1819 and -- and up until the\npresent code, Section 17.1208, he has the right of\naccess to tax assessment records.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So the -- if I\nunderstood your answer to Justice Sotomayor, the only\nreason you don't let out-of-Staters get these records is\nbecause of the added overhead costs?\nMR. GETCHELL: No, Your Honor. It's just\nnot part of the interests the State was trying to serve.\nThe State -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I know.\nBut -- but -- so why don't you do it anyways? Just -- just\nas I asked your friend, it doesn't seem like that\nbig a deal. It doesn't seem like that big a deal for\nyou either. If you can recoup overhead costs from\npeople who request -- and I'd assume you would be able\nto -- why don't other people -- people from West\nVirginia may have interest in how Virginia government\noperates, too.\nAnd -- and, again, if -- what cost is there to\nyou, other than overhead? You don't want to keep how\nVirginia government operates quiet from outsiders when\nyou let in -- its citizens get the access, do you?\nMR. GETCHELL: The -- we are here to defend\nthe decisions of the two lower courts that apply\nexisting doctrine. And, under existing doctrine, only\nif we discover that this is a fundamental right, do I\nhave to justify -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's under\nthe Privileges -- the Privileges and Immunities\nargument.\nMR. GETCHELL: That's correct.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay. But what\nabout the Dormant Commerce Clause?\nMR. GETCHELL: Under the Dormant Commerce\nClause, we would first have to have a regulation of\ncommerce that's discriminatory. And I would say that a -\nthat this is a governmental function. I would say\nthat -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, I know -- I\nunderstand your argument. I'm just asking you why\nbother? I mean, what -- what's the -- and that's\ncertainly pertinent to some of the Commerce Clause\nanalysis. And I haven't heard anything, other than the\noverhead costs. And I think you can recoup that from\nthe requesters.\nMR. GETCHELL: I cannot, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why not?\nMR. GETCHELL: Mr. Chief Justice, the\nstatute says I cannot recoup the cost of maintaining and\ngenerating the database, which is, by definition,\noverhead. I cannot -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, you've got to\nmaintain and generate the database, anyway, for Virginia\ncitizens who are going to ask for it. This is not an\nadded cost. It's an added cost if you\nhave to hire an additional person to handle -- as far as\nI can tell, just these two people.\nMR. GETCHELL: It's an added burden, too.\nIt's not all -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But the Virginia citizens\npay for that database, right? MR. GETCHELL: They\ndo. This is a\ntaxpayer -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And the out-of-Staters\ndon't pay for the database.\nMR. GETCHELL: This is a taxpayer-subsidized\nsystem.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And, besides, do -- do\nyou -- is it the law that -- that the State of Virginia\ncannot do anything that's pointless?\nOnly -- only the Federal Government can do\nstuff that's pointless?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. GETCHELL: The -- there is a\nburden -- there is a non-financial burden as well\nbecause, as one who is subject to FOIA requests, we have\na finite number of officials and employees who have to\naddress these things. And that -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You keep making that\nargument. But you don't stop residents for asking for\nthe information from someone else. I mean, that's one\nof the points of your law, which is they can hire a\nVirginia resident to get it for them. Most of the big\npeople are doing that already.\nSo you're not saving any money if they can\nget the information simply by paying someone in Virginia to\nget it for them.\nMR. GETCHELL: In -- in fact, the State of\nVirginia has made the policy decision to give this\ninformation to its citizens and not to inquire behind it\nto see whether or not somebody's doing it for an\nout-of-Stater. And not -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Or even for commercial\npurposes. Don't you think if -- if those who created\nthese government in the sunshine laws could have drafted\nthem in such a way that inquiries for commercial\npurposes would not be allowed, but only those inquiries\nthat are intended to look into the workings of State\ngovernment and produce government in the sunshine, don't\nyou think that they probably would have excluded\ncommercial inquiries, if they could?\nBut you can't tell which ones are commercial\nand which aren't.\nMR. GETCHELL: And we don't -- and we don't\ntry. We have a policy decision that we want to have a\nvery simple system that allows our citizens to make\ninquiries without a demonstrated need or cause because\nwe want there to be sunshine.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's no more\ncomplicated a system if you let out-of-Staters have\naccess, too. You say we want a simple system. It's going to\nbe the same system, whether you win or lose.\nMR. GETCHELL: The thing that is of -- of\ngreat concern -- why do we care, why do we bother -- is\nthe principle that when a government is providing a\ntaxpayer-subsidized service of recent origin to its\ncitizens, that it does not have to explain its choice,\neither under the Privileges and Immunities Clause or\nunder the Dormant Commerce Clause.\nIt is very important that we not find\nourselves with lawsuits that say, \"services.\" Voluntary\nservices are, in fact, things that, now, have to be\njustified under those two provisions of the\nConstitution.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, that -- that's where\nhe comes in with his argument because I -- I agree, you\ncan -- you don't have -- let's say the most fabulous\nreason for doing this, but you have a reason.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: And so the question is,\ndoes it have to be better than that? And -- and they\nare saying yes. And, as I heard it, this -- what I\nwould characterize as a strong argument -- this sort of,\nfirst of all, strikes me as a stronger argument, is\nthat, look, if we go back into history, out-of-State\nreal estate people could always get information about\nproperty -- let's say they had a client who wanted to\nbuy it.\nNow, you've protected that. But, in today's\nworld, it's important that we get statistics about this,\ntoo, because our economy is national. If we understand\nhow States are taxing their real estate, we will know to\nwhat extent they increase the value, to what extent they\nincrease the rate, to what extent they really get the\nmoney they are supposed to, to what extent they might\nget money or not get money in the future.\nAnd all of those things are nationally\nimportant, so that people can put them together and\nmake -- better than we have done in the past -\npredictions about what is likely to happen to States\nand, hence, the national economy. All right.\nThat's -- that's the kind of argument he's\nmaking. And he says, so, therefore, there is a national\ninterest in the flow of this information. And that\nmeans you have to have a better than \"uh-huh\" kind of\nrationale. That's -- that's what he's saying, I think.\nMR. GETCHELL: But it's very difficult for\nMr. Hurlbert to make that fairly expansive argument\nbecause it turns out -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, to be fair, I -- I\nwas sort of expanding it. (Laughter.)\nMR. GETCHELL: But, in point of fact,\nbecause he is entitled to the tax assessment data in the\nclerk's office, in the case of Henrico County, where he\nwent, you go in the same building and -- if you're\nMr. Hurlbert, you turn in one direction, you go to the\nclerk's office.\nAnd, if somebody in Virginia and wants to -\nfor whatever reason, get it from the tax assessor's\nbook, instead of from the clerk's book, you turn in the\nother direction.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: But you don't deny that, in\ngeneral, this does affect out-of-State data collectors,\npeople who are engaged in the kind of business that\nJustice Breyer was talking about, is that right?\nMR. GETCHELL: I have no idea in this record\nbecause we were on summary judgment -- cross motions for\nsummary judgment, and the district court and the court of\nappeals, both in our judgment, correctly ruled that\nthere's a two -- two-step inquiry.\nAnd the first step is whether or not\nthere is a fundamental right. And in the absence\nof a -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It's only in his\nPrivileges and Immunities Clause claim. MR.\nGETCHELL: Well -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: He claims that the\ndormant Commerce Clause has been effected because he\nreads this statute as saying only Virginia recording\ncompanies have access; out-of-State can't. And it's a\nfair reading of the statute. It only permits Virginia\nresidents, which include commercial and noncommercial,\nto access the information.\nSo assume, hypothetically, that the statute\nreads \"only Virginia commercial businesses have access\nto this information\" -\nMR. GETCHELL: If -- if, in fact, you want\nto rewrite the statute to -- subject to -- it to attack,\nobviously, that would then raise questions about a\nnongovernmental protectionist intent, but that's not the\nway this statute was written. It's not how it was\ncrafted. It -- it has nothing to do with commerce.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, that's the\nquestion I'm -- I'm raising the best argument for your\nadversary, okay?\nMR. GETCHELL: Right.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Because we could call it\na direct -- he calls it direct discrimination because\ncommercial businesses are being permitted in Virginia,\nbut not noncommercial. You say it's indirect. How do we\ndraw the line between direct and indirect, when the\nbottom-line consequence is the same?\nMR. GETCHELL: I would -- I would have about\nthree answers to that. The first -- the first one is\nthat we don't trigger the dormant Commerce Clause\nanalysis, unless we are exercising the police power of a\nState to regulate commerce. And that means -- it does\nmean that not every statute a State passes triggers an\ninquiry, even if it has an indirect effect on commerce.\nWhereas, here, we have a statute that has a\nsolely political intent, the fact that -- that now that\nthe amici want to tell us about this great burgeoning\nenterprise, they -- they want the Court to take that\ninto account.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Are you -- are you telling\nus that there is simply no commercial consequences to\nthis statute at all, that Virginians find this to be of\nno commercial value, in any instance?\nMR. GETCHELL: I am totally agnostic on this\nrecord because we don't have any data on that.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, you were the one\nwith summary judgment. Now, maybe -- maybe they didn't\ncome forward with the information, but we interpret\nsummary judgment in favor of -- of the losing party.\nAnd you're -- so you say you are totally\nagnostic. I am concerned that you are preventing them,\nby the summary judgment, from showing that there -- even\nwith Virginians, there is a commercial value frequently\nto this information.\nMR. GETCHELL: All right.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: It's not just political.\nMR. GETCHELL: On this -- on this record -\non this record, the position that was accepted by the\ntwo courts below, entirely in accordance with this\nCourt's existing doctrine, was the first inquiry under\nPrivileges and Immunities, was whether there was a\nfundamental right. If there -- if there is not, then we\nmake no further inquiry.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Let's talk about -- let's\ntalk about the Commerce Clause. You are saying you are\nagnostic. You have no idea whether or not there might\nbe some commercial value to this information. I would\nthink, as an officer of the State of Virginia or as a\nmatter of judicial notice, we could -- we could take\nnotice that there is.\nMR. GETCHELL: I'm saying that, under this\nrecord, that never came up, nor should it have come up,\nbecause what the court said on dormant Commerce Clause,\nboth of the courts below, was this is not a regulation\nof commerce, it is a governmental action --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But it has -- it has -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You are saying that it's no\nmore necessary for you to show that there's no\ncommercial value to allowing out-of-Staters to do this\nthan it is necessary for you to show that there is no\ncommercial value to your not allowing out-of-Staters to\nhunt deer in Virginia.\nMR. GETCHELL: I believe -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You say that it's up\nto Virginia -\nMR. GETCHELL: Correct, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- whether -- whether\nout-of-Staters can hunt for Virginia game.\nMR. GETCHELL: Correct.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And it's up to Virginia\nwhether out-of-Staters can have access to the State's\nrecords, that they have no interest in, personally,\nunder -- under this law. It seems, to me, perfectly\nlogical.\nMR. GETCHELL: But, remember, they do -\nthey do have access to this information, both Hurlbert\nand McBurney.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Of course, that assumes\nthe question as to whether or not there is a general\ncommercial interest in these -- in these -- in these\ndocuments. And you say, oh, you are agnostic. At least\nthat means you are open to the possibility that there\nmight be a commercial interest.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. GETCHELL: Well, here's the problem in\nthis case is because I think that we are not at\nfirst-tier analysis, because there is no regulation of\ncommerce that is discriminatory -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I didn't understand -- if\nthat's your argument on it, I reject it as Justice\nKennedy does. I -- I didn't understand you to be\narguing that there is no commercial value.\nMR. GETCHELL: I'm trying to explain why it\ndoesn't matter.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, that's what I thought.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. GETCHELL: It doesn't -- it doesn't\nmatter because if -- if, on the threshold inquiry, we\ndon't have a discriminatory regulation of commerce, but\njust an ordinary governmental function, then only\nPike-Church analysis could possibly -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You -- you can't say\ndiscriminatory regulation. What about a tax? I mean,\nyou can't tax discriminatorily, and I wouldn't call\ntaxation, in and of itself, a regulation of commerce, would\nyou?\nMR. GETCHELL: The -- the fact of the matter\nis that it has been -- taxes have been found to be both\nviolations of privileges and immunities and dormant\nCommerce Clause, where there were -- there was unequal\ntaxation of commerce.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, even though it's -\neven though it's not a regulation of commerce?\nMR. GETCHELL: Okay. Well, I -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. I mean, I guess\nthat's your argument, then.\nMR. GETCHELL: I apologize I chose a word\nthat is not as apt as it should have been, but a\nregulation or taxation centering around commerce\nintended to affect and actually affecting commerce, it\njust -- this just isn't that kind of activity.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Well, General, can I-- just\nindulge me with a hypothetical. Suppose that the background\nfor these statutes was different. The statutes were the\nsame, but, in addition to talking about people's right\nto know about how their government works, the people\nspend a lot of time also talking about the economic\nbenefits of a free flow of information in our country.\nWould that -- if that were true -- and I\nwant to put myself on record as not remembering when these\nstatutes were passed -- you know.\n(Laughter. )\nJUSTICE KAGAN: But, if that were true,\nwould this case be different? Or would you still be up\nhere saying the same thing?\nMR. GETCHELL: If -- if I had -- if I had a\nstatute which, on its face, dealt with -- with\ncommerce -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: The statute does exactly the\nsame thing. I'm just suggesting that there might be two\ninterests behind the statute. One is about knowing the\nway your government operates, and the other is about\nfree flows of information in our economy.\nAnd, if both of those things had gone into\nthe mix to create statutes of this kind, would you\nbe up here saying the same thing or not?\nMR. GETCHELL: I would be saying something\nat least slightly different, if I had different facts\nthat I had to deal with, but I think, in principle, I\nwould be arguing the power of the State to pass this\nkind of act without having to submit to the dormant\nCommerce Clause, at least first-tier dormant Commerce\nClause analysis.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What else -- what else\ncan Virginia do besides -- I don't know if there are elks in\nVirginia, but besides -- to reserve for its\nown -- for its own people? You say, this is -- good\ngovernment in Virginia is for Virginians. Big game\nhunting, scarce resource can be reserved for in-State\npeople.\nWhat else can Virginia do?\nMR. GETCHELL: Well, Virginia can -- can do\nthings including have in-State tuition. It can have -\nit can subsidize its own businesses, either by training\nprograms or even by other direct subsidy from public\nFISK. It limits welfare payments to residents of the\nCommonwealth.\nWhen the Commonwealth is just acting as a\ngovernment and not as a regulator or taxer of interstate\ncommerce, it has the status of a coequal sovereign that,\nin its own sphere, is allowed to do its own policy\nchoices.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: I think the thing, General,\nthat I was trying to get at, it seems to me you have a\nvery good case that these statutes were -- were meant\nfor a different purpose. But, in fact, it seems as\nthough your friends there have a good case that these\nstatutes have been taken over, to a large extent, across\nthe country by economic enterprises doing economic\nthings. And, at that point in time, Virginia's -\nand -- you know, you are only one of two States -\nVirginia's maintenance of this kind of -- no, it's\nVirginians -- you know, Virginia information for\nVirginians, looks very different from what it might have\nlooked like when the statute was originally passed.\nMR. GETCHELL: If -- if we were going to\nsay, if you were going to say that -- that this is an\ninquiry that needs to be made under the Commerce Clause,\nthis would be a particularly poor vehicle for doing it\nbecause the Fourth Circuit held that the Pike analysis\nof the district court was not appealed, and, therefore,\nthis case could not be sent back on remand to develop a\nburden analysis of a record -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But Pike is not relevant\nhere. Pike involves -- the Southern Pacific v. Arizona\nthe -- where there were -- where there were melons -\nwhere there were melons, and Arizona wanted to make sure\nthat you had labels and packing of the melons in\nArizona. That was -- that was discriminatory against -\nagainst interstate -- against interstate commerce.\nThat's not -- that's not dormant Commerce\nClause, but that is discrimination, and there is\ndiscrimination here.\nMR. GETCHELL: Well, there's -- there's\ndiscrimination, only in the sense that we discriminate\nagainst people who we don't let vote because they don't\nlive in the Commonwealth as well. I mean, we -- this\nstatute has a function. It's a legitimate function\nand -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: You -- you could say the\nsame thing, we don't discriminate against Californians\nwho want to come and pack their melons in Arizona.\nMR. GETCHELL: Well, I would say that -\nthat whether or not somebody can deal with an item in\ncommerce is -- is -- raises Commerce Clause questions.\nAnd just, like in Reno v. Condon, where the State of\nSouth Carolina was choosing to take its records and sell\nthem into the stream of commerce, there, the Court held\nthat -- that they thereby became a thing in commerce.\nThe records of the tax assessor of the\nCounty of Henrico, which are available through the\nclerk's office to Mr. Hurlbert, are not things or\npersons in commerce, nor are they -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: It -- it would surprise me\nif an out-of-State investor, who was thinking of putting\na large plant in Virginia, had absolutely no interest in\nVirginia's tax policies.\nMR. GETCHELL: But they are available. They\nare publicly available. They are not just not available\nthrough this adjunct service. All -- all FOIA is, is a\ndevice where you don't have to go and look. There has\nalways been public access for these -- these records.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So -- so suppose -- I mean,\nI think they have an argument, saying, of course, this\ninformation would be useful for gathering national\nstatistics and helping the national economy. I think\nthat's true.\nOn the other hand, you say, well, but, look,\nthere must be something left that the States can reserve\nto their own citizens, there must be something. They\ncan't protect their own commerce; that's clear. They\ncan't discriminate against people who want to come here\nand live here. That's clear.\nThey can't do this and that and the other\nthing, but, gee, there must be something. I mean, can't\nthey reserve at least their -- their beaches for their\nown citizens? No. Parking near their beaches? Well,\nmaybe. And -- and maybe deer. And, if not this, what?\nThat's the end. Okay?\nSo that's, basically, what you are saying.\nThis is just an interest in trying to find out how State\ninstitutions work, and the voters have the main interest\nthere, and this is other -- so you say the other one is\nattenuated, but not non-existent. He says the other is\nimportant, though he recognizes States should be able to\ndo something.\nSo if you were me, how would you decide?\nHow would you choose?\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: What is the standard,\nbecause you know the -- the Privileges and Immunities\nClause is -- is considerably opaque, and there are very\nfew cases on it. And so what -- how would you tell me\nto -- to resolve that -- that tension because there is a\ntension.\nMR. GETCHELL: I -- I think there that -\nthat the important policy issue in this case for us is\nprecisely as you articulated. There -- there is\nresidual sovereign power in the State to act, and we\nhave to violate the Constitution, clearly, before we\nlose that authority.\nAnd, under existing privileges and\nimmunities doctrine, the privileges and immunities\nare -- are few; they are -- they have been enumerated in\nthe courts, they are similar in character, having to do\nwith commerce, not governmental action. So I would say\nyou would not extend privileges and immunities.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: We are talking about\nState-owned documents, aren't we? MR. GETCHELL:\nYes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: There is not much that's as\nclose to the sovereignty of the State as the possession\nand right to exclude people from its own records and its\nown documents, right?\nMR. GETCHELL: I agree, Your -\nJustice Scalia.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So the -- the issue is can\nthe State allow its own citizens, for purposes of seeing\nthat the government is -- is being run on the up-and-up,\nhave access to those documents, without letting the\nwhole world?\nMR. GETCHELL: Yes, Your Honor, that is our\nposition.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So why doesn't the\ndormant Commerce Clause affect the hypothetical I laid\nout? Because, directly, this permits Virginia\ncommercial businesses to get something that\nout-of-Staters can't. The State is putting this\ninstrument into commerce. You say, I don't know that.\nBut make the assumption that we think the record's clear\nenough on that point.\nI know you want to fight me on that, but\nit's hard -- it's a fight with no legs because you have\nto know that commercial enterprises in Virginia seek these\nrecords.\nMR. GETCHELL: I am -- I am arguing that, of\ncourse, I think we say in our brief that -- that they\ncan be put into commerce. They are put into commerce,\nbut we don't put them into commerce. And we have -- in\nthe architecture of our bill -- our act has nothing to\ndo with commerce.\nAnd if a State can't deal with -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Tell us, under our\njurisprudence -- the dormant Common Commerce\njurisprudence -- and I have some colleagues who don't -- who\ndon't believe it should exist. Take that argument out.\nWhy is this not a dormant Commerce Clause case?\nMR. GETCHELL: Because it is not an exercise\nof the State police power to regulate commerce. The\ndocuments in the -- in the tax assessor's office of the\nCounty of Henrico are not things or persons in commerce,\nnor are they channels or instrumentalities of commerce.\nThey are just the records of the sovereign, which we\nwill allow our citizens to obtain.\nUnless the Court has further questions, I\nthink this argument has been developed from our\nstandpoint.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, General.\nMr. Gupta, you have three minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DEEPAK GUPTA\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. GUPTA: Thank you. Just a few quick\npoints: First, I just want to clear up, on the statute,\nI want to make it clear that this statute does allow the\nState to fully recoup its costs, including\nadministrative costs, and the State hasn't said\notherwise.\nAnd, secondly, the suggestion has been\nmade -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. The -- I -- I\nthink what he's saying is you don't have to pay the\ncosts of developing and maintaining those records, which\ncosts are paid by the citizens of Virginia, which gives\nthem an additional interest in being able to get to\nthose documents.\nYou -- you don't claim that -- that you pay\nfor the development and the maintenance of those\nrecords. You just pay for the incremental costs of\ngiving it to you, right?\nMR. GUPTA: That -- that's right,\nJustice Scalia -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And Virginians pay for all\nthe rest?\nMR. GUPTA: That -- that's right, Justice Scalia,\nand that's true of other things, like roads and\ncourthouses. And I think this gets to -- Justice Breyer\nasked for our test, to try to differentiate this from\nother services, and I'd like to try to provide one.\nI think, at least where you've got a\nfunction that is reserved to the State -- only the State\ncan do it, only the State can run the archives -- it's\nnecessary as a channel to -- to commerce. And in the -\nin the modern economy, this is as much part of the\ninformation infrastructure as transportation is, like\ncourthouses, like archives, like roads.\nIt would not stretch limited resources. It\nwould not cost the State additional money, and it would\nnot jeopardize important local traditions or\ninstitutions -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Are you leaving out -\nMR. GUPTA: -- that I think you can feel\ncomfortable -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Are you leaving it -\nyou -- you switched now to-- and you were led there, but\nyou switched to the dormant Commerce Clause. What about\nyour other client, McBurney? He doesn't have any\ndormant Commerce Clause claim.\nMR. GUPTA: Right. And I -- I think the\ntest that I just laid out would work for both clauses. It's a\nlimiting principle on the justification side.\nBut -- but that's right, Mr. McBurney does not have a\ndormant Commerce Clause claim. His claim is based on\nequal access to proceedings.\nHe wanted to get recovery of child support\nthat he was owed. So he is a creditor seeking to pursue\na debt on equal terms with people in the State of\nVirginia, and the State set up a process. As one step\nalong the way to court, you go to the agency, you ask\nthe agency to enforce. The -- the agency has unique\nenforcement tools.\nIt can suspend someone's driver's license,\nfor example. It can -- it can intercept income tax\nrefunds, and it can go to court on your behalf. And all\nhe's asking for is the rules of the game. He wants to\nknow what procedures apply to that process. And at\nleast where a -- an agency has a process that directly\naffects a non-stater in the pocketbook, all we are\nsaying is that equal access to the proceedings means\nequal access to the information governing those\nproceedings.\nAnd, finally, I would just like to close by\nsaying that -- you know, what I don't think we heard on\nthe justification side from the State was really any\njustification because the State can recoup its costs. And so\nanything more, which was the only justification they\npressed in -- in the courts below.\nAnd so they are left with the position that\nthey can discriminate simply because they think they\ncan. And, if you look at the Privileges and Immunities\nClause, it sits right next to the Full Faith and Credit\nClause, which indicates, if anything, that the framers\nthought that the movement of public records across State\nlines was important to interstate comity.\nThey changed the Articles of Confederation\nversion, which did not include public records; it only\nreferred to judicial records. They added a mention of\njudicial records -- nonjudicial records and saw that\nthat was important to -- to comity across State lines.\nBut -- but their position is about the step\nbefore that. It's about whether you get the records in\nthe first place.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
