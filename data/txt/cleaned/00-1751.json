Doris SImmons-Harris, and\ntwo related cases.\nMs. French.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JUDITH L. FRENCH\nON BEHALF OF THE STATE PETITIONERS\nMS. FRENCH: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and\nmay it please the Court:\nIn 1995, the Ohio General Assembly responded to\nan unprecedented educational crisis by enacting the Ohio\nScholarship and Tutorial Program. Under this Court's\ndecisions, especially Mueller, Witters, and Zobrest, and\nin light of this Court's teachings, most recently in\nAgostini and Mitchell, the Ohio program is constitutional\nbecause it offers a neutral program that offers true\nprivate choice to parents.\nFirst, the principle of neutrality. There are two\ncriteria that determine where the benefits will go under\nthe program. First is residence in a school district that\nis or has been taken over by State control. Second is\nfamily income. Neither of these criteria has anything to\ndo with religion, but even beyond these basic elements --\nQUESTION: Well, do you -- you don't take the\nposition that that guarantees constitutionality, do you?\nMS. FRENCH: We do not, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Okay.\nMS. FRENCH: We have a two-pronged approach.\nQUESTION: You take it as a necessary condition,\nbut not a sufficient condition?\nMS. FRENCH: We do, Your Honor. We offer both\nneutrality and true private choice, but even beyond the\nbasic elements of neutrality, there are a number of\nprovisions within this program that guarantee that it's\nopen to all-comers, both in terms of students and schools.\nFirst, the program requires schools not to\ndiscriminate based on race, religion, or ethnic origin,\nthat ensures that even a religious school may not\ndiscriminate in favor of students of their own religious\nfaith.\nQUESTION: And you think it would be\nunconstitutional if it didn't have that --\nMS. FRENCH: Not necessarily, Your Honor, but it\ncertainly goes to the neutrality of the program, but even\nbeyond the --\nQUESTION: Well, why does it matter? I mean, if\nthey're proselytizing, doesn't it make good sense for them\nto admit anybody who may come along, and yet the\nproselytizing can't be established under the Establishment\nClause?\nMS. FRENCH: We, of course, Your Honor, do you\nagree that they're proselytizing. Whatever proselytizing\nis happening in the religious schools is at the behest of\nthe parents, not at the behest of the Government, and\nperhaps I should move to the second prong, then, and talk\nabout --\nQUESTION: Well -- go ahead.\nMS. FRENCH: And talk about the true private\nchoice that is at issue here for the parents.\nQUESTION: Well, but I take it that the first\npart of your argument as demonstrated is to try to show\nthat there are certain indexes, indicia of neutrality.\nMS. FRENCH: Correct.\nQUESTION: And you just -- and you tick them\noff.\nMS. FRENCH: Yes, Your Honor. Yes, that there\nis the Nondiscrimination Clause, and secondly that there\nis a cap on the number of students that -- who are already\nin the program, and the limit on the number who can\ncontinue in the program. Only 50 percent of the\nscholarships awarded each year may be awarded to students\nwho are already in the program. That again assures that\nthe program be open to all-comers, to those eligible in\nthe Cleveland School District.\nThirdly --\nQUESTION: What percentage of the students in\nthe school system are -- get vouchers?\nMS. FRENCH: Well, there are 57,000 students,\nelementary students in the Cleveland School District, Your\nHonor. About 4,000 of them get scholarships.\nQUESTION: About how many thousand get\nscholarships, 2,000?\nMS. FRENCH: In 1999 the number was 3,700. It's\nnow about 3,4 --\nQUESTION: So it's about 10 percent of the\nstudent body?\nMS. FRENCH: Yes, Your Honor, a little less than\n10 percent, but all the students in the Cleveland School\nDistrict are eligible. They all receive information about\nthe program, all are invited to attend, as long as the\nresident is in the school district, and then family income\ndetermines the amount of the scholarship that they\nreceive.\nThe third and final prong of the neutrality here\nis the benefit itself. It is, of course, money. It is\ninherently neutral. There is nothing about that benefit\nthat suggests any sort of reference to religion.\nThe second prong this Court has looked to is the\ntrue private choice available for receiving the benefits.\nHere, Cleveland parents have a number of alternatives\navailable to them. They can stay in the Cleveland Public\nSchools --\nQUESTION: May I ask you a question about\nprivate choice which is a very important part of the case?\nSupposing you had a situation with a small community that\nhad one public school and one religious school, and they\nwould pay for the voucher to go to the religious school if\nthe family on its own private choice wanted the child to\ngo to the religious school. Would that save the program\nin that case?\nMS. FRENCH: I think it would, Your Honor --\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMS. FRENCH: -- given -- if -- of course --\nQUESTION: So in this case it's irrelevant,\nreally, that there are four or five choices available, as\nlong as there's a free choice either to go to the public\nschool or to go to the religious school?\nMS. FRENCH: Well, we have a number of choices\nwithin the traditional public schools, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: But they're not -- it's not necessary\nto your argument is what I'm trying to --\nMS. FRENCH: They are not necessary, Your Honor.\nHowever, this Court has viewed other programs in view of\nthe entire -- viewed as a whole of the program. For\ninstance, in Rosenberger, Justice Powell's decision in\nWitters --\nQUESTION: In Witters, there's such a dramatic\ndifference between a choice from the great universe of\ncolleges and universities, what a particular student will\nchoose, and here, the difference -- you just explained to\nJustice Stevens that maybe it doesn't matter. The\ndifference is that in fact there is only one alternative,\nif you don't take account of the community schools, the\nsuburban schools say no, they don't want any part of this,\nprivate schools can't make it on that low tuition, so in\nfact, isn't it true that something like 99 percent of the\nstudents who were receiving these vouchers are in\nreligious schools?\nMS. FRENCH: That's currently true, Your Honor.\nThat number has fluctuated over the years of the program.\nIt's fluctuated a great deal from 1995 to this year.\nThat's true.\nQUESTION: May I ask why we don't take account\nof the availability of the community schools in analyzing\nthis program?\nMS. FRENCH: We would like the Court to take\nvery much account of the community schools, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: The court below didn't do that.\nMS. FRENCH: That's correct, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Is that an option, in fact, to the\nparents?\nMS. FRENCH: Very much so, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: And the tuition assistance would be\nprovided if the selection were for a community school?\nMS. FRENCH: There would be no tuition\nassistance, Your Honor, only because they are public\nschools, so there's no need for a scholarship there.\nParents can choose a traditional public school, they can\nchoose a tutoring grant if they're in a public school,\nthey can choose a magnet school, they can choose a\ncommunity school, or --\nQUESTION: And if a community school is\nselected, no additional money then is provided, as would\nbe provided if the religious school were selected?\nMS. FRENCH: That's true, Your Honor. If the\nparent chooses a community school, because it's considered\na public school, there is no money exchanged. It's\nonly --\nQUESTION: Have some of the private nonsectarian\nschools in the city become community schools?\nMS. FRENCH: They have, Your Honor. There were\ntwo schools in particular who in 1997 chose to be\ncommunity schools rather than be in the scholarship\nprogram just after the district court's injunction.\nQUESTION: Because they get more money. Because\nthey get more money.\nMS. FRENCH: In part because they get more\nmoney, and in part because of the uncertainty of the\nlitigation. There certainly has been a chilling effect as\na result of the litigation that's been going on in some\nform since 1995.\nQUESTION: Are slots available in the community\nschools for these children that we're talking about?\nMS. FRENCH: Yes, Your Honor, there are spots\navailable.\nQUESTION: There are vacancies?\nMS. FRENCH: Available in both community\nschools --\nQUESTION: Can you get a tutoring grant if you\ngo to a community school?\nMS. FRENCH: Yes, Your Honor, you can. As long\nas you're in a public school, and that would include\ncommunity or magnet schools, you're eligible for a\ntutoring grant.\nQUESTION: Is there anything in the record about\nthe quality of these community schools? There was one\nbrief that said they were too new, too few, too\nunregulated, too untested to tell. Was there any evidence\nof what these schools are, when -- there is evidence that\nthe public school system is deplorable. What evidence is\nthere of these community schools, of whether they are a\nbetter choice to educate the child than the regular public\nschools?\nMS. FRENCH: I would direct the Court to two\nplaces in the record, particularly the joint appendix.\nOne is the affidavit of Mr. Puckett, which is at 157a,\nwhich simply describes what a community school is, the\nnumber of schools that are available, the number of spaces\nthat are available. There is also the affidavit of Paul\nPeterson, at approximately 98 of the joint appendix, a\nvery lengthy affidavit that describes the different kinds\nof options available and what their benefits are.\nThe benefit for a community school is, it is\nconsidered a public school. There is some amount of\naccountability that might not be there with respect to a\nprivate school, but for a parent who's looking for an\nalternative to the public schools, that might be a good\noption for them.\nQUESTION: Is there a description of the precise\ncommunity schools that are participating in the program,\nand the quality of education in those schools?\nMS. FRENCH: There is to the first part of your\nquestion, Your Honor, and that's in Mr. Puckett's\naffidavit, of just describing what the schools are, why we\nhave them in Ohio. It's a State-wide program. It's not\njust for Cleveland. It's actually a State-wide program\nthat was implemented in 1997, and was specifically\ncomplemented by the district court in a desegregation\norder relating to Cleveland as an option for Cleveland\nparents.\nQUESTION: Is there information in the record\navailable about the quality of the religiously affiliated\nschools?\nMS. FRENCH: There are a number of studies that\nhave been done both in Cleveland and with respect to other\nscholarship programs, Your Honor. I would point\nspecifically to, again to Mr. Peterson's affidavit at 105\nto 107 in the joint appendix.\nQUESTION: I mean about these particular schools\nin the program.\nMS. FRENCH: Yes, Your Honor, in general the\nscholarship program, not just specifically the religious\nschools, but the voucher, or the scholarship program as a\nwhole, as to whether the students are showing academic\nachievement or, you know, significant results beyond that.\nYes, there are, but not specific, again, to the religious\nschools.\nQUESTION: Before we leave the community\nschools, when the State calculates the funding that goes\nto the community schools, it takes account of the number\nof students that go to the community schools, I take it?\nMS. FRENCH: Oh, yes, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: And there's a figure of something\nlike $5,000 --\nMS. FRENCH: Yes.\nQUESTION: -- per student. It's not quite that.\nMS. FRENCH: Right. $4,500 to $5,000. It's\ncalculated on the basis of the normal State aid number\nthat a public school would receive for educating a child\nand, again, it's a per capita kind of number.\nQUESTION: Does the same amount of money per\ncapita go to a community school as would go to the regular\npublic school?\nMS. FRENCH: Yes, Your Honor, approximately.\nThere's a slightly different amount, but it's\napproximately the same as the State aid number.\nQUESTION: May I ask you if this Court would\nhave to overrule the Nyquist case to support your\nposition? It certainly points the other way, doesn't it?\nMS. FRENCH: It does point the other way, Your\nHonor, but we think that there are a number of\ndistinctions which this Court has drawn between the\nprograms at issue, say, in Mueller and Witters that\ndistinguish it from the New York program at issue in\nNyquist.\nThe New York program took a class of\nbeneficiaries, that is, the students already within the\nprivate schools, and offered them a benefit. The Ohio\nprogram approaches the problem very differently. It\napproaches the problem from all of the schoolchildren in\nOhio, or in the Cleveland Public School System, and offers\nthem a benefit which --\nQUESTION: How does that change the legal\nconcern about the Establishment Clause?\nMS. FRENCH: Well, this Court has pointed to\nspecifically footnote 38, where the Court reserved\njudgment in the Nyquist decision for programs that offered\na benefit, the specific example was scholarships there,\nand offered to a broad base of beneficiaries without\nregard to the nonpublic or public or nonsectarian,\nsectarian nature of the institutions benefited, which is\nprecisely what is happening here.\nQUESTION: Well, but doesn't that simply then go\nback to this neutrality point, and you're saying because\nit's neutral, in the sense that it's offered in an even-\nhanded way, query -- your friends on the other side\ndispute that, but just accepting that categorization,\nbecause it's neutral in that sense, that's a distinction\nwhich ought to make a difference in the result.\nBut as you agreed earlier, the neutrality that\nyou're talking about is a necessary condition, but it's\nnot a sufficient condition of constitutionality, and at\nthe end of the day, I think what's bothering me about\nNyquist and, I suspect, Justice O'Connor, too, is that\nNyquist depended not merely on a question of neutrality,\nbut on the effect, and at the end of the day, the effect\nis a massive amount of money into religious schools in\nNyquist, a massive amount of money into religious schools\nhere. That, I think, is the sticking point here.\nMS. FRENCH: We, of course, disagree, Your\nHonor, that there is a massive amount going to religious\nschools as a result of something that the Government is\ndoing. It's true, it's very true --\nQUESTION: Well, your adding a term as a result\nof what the Government is doing, which is a separate issue\nas to what the significance is of the private choice, but\nthe effect that Nyquist was concerned with, and the effect\nthat I think has been shown here, is a substantial amount\nof money, aid to the schools themselves, in relation to\nthe amount of money spent on the program, and in those\nrespects the two are identical.\nMS. FRENCH: Well, in that respect, Your Honor,\nthere's no question that there is money that is ending up\nin religious institutions, because that's what the parents\nhave chosen, but that nondiscrimination provision that I\nspoke of earlier did not exist in Nyquist. The New York\nschools at issue in Nyquist could discriminate based on\nreligion, and that, of course, means that the program, the\nNew York program was not open to all-comers.\nQUESTION: Well, Miller also made the point, I\nthink, that where the parents do the choosing, as they did\nnot do in Nyquist, it was a different ball game.\nMS. FRENCH: Absolutely, Your Honor. In\nMueller, of course, the percentage of religious schools or\nthe number of parents receiving benefit because they paid\ntuition to religious schools was 96 percent, and this\nCourt has been very clear that where there is private\nchoice, that percentage that changes from year to year is\nsimply not relevant. The wisdom of that rule --\nQUESTION: What is the closest of our cases, do\nyou think, to the Ohio program? Is it Witters?\nMS. FRENCH: I would suggest Witters, Your\nHonor, because it's a financial aid going to, there it was\na college student, but an adult, to make a decision about\nwhere to send the money. Here, it's an adult parent\nmaking a decision about where to send the money on behalf\nof the child.\nQUESTION: What are you say --\nQUESTION: Here, the difference would be,\nhowever, that according to respondents the choices are\nmuch more limited here than in Witters.\nMS. FRENCH: That's true, Your Honor, but in\nMueller the Court did address that concern, as Justice\nPowell said in his concurrence in Witters, that it didn't\nmatter that there was only one person, Mr. Witters, using\nthe money for seminary, for the Inland Empire School of\nthe Bible, nor did it matter in Zobrest that there was\nonly one child or one parent, set of parents for a child\nlooking for an interpretive or religious school. Mueller\nteachers that the percentage that changes from year to\nyear is simply not relevant.\nQUESTION: I suppose part of the design of the\nprogram is to have a structure which will encourage over\nthe long term more and different kinds of school choices,\nincluding, of course, the community schools.\nMS. FRENCH: Absolutely, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: May I ask you about your suggestion\nthat in Nyquist, it's a difference when the parents do the\nchoosing, but who chose where the children would go to\nschool in Nyquist? Did the parents make the decision?\nMS. FRENCH: The parents, of course, did, Your\nHonor.\nQUESTION: So it's the same case.\nMS. FRENCH: I disagree, Your Honor. I think\nit's different in that we fall under the question that was\nreserved by the Court that there, because they didn't have\nthe nondiscrimination provision, because of the purpose\nbehind that Nyquist program was specifically to aid the\nprivate schools, that's very different from the Ohio\nprogram that's at issue here.\nYour Honor, I'd like to reserve my remaining\ntime.\nQUESTION: Very well, Ms. French.\nMr. Young, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID L. YOUNG\nON BEHALF OF THE PRIVATE PETITIONERS\nMR. YOUNG: Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the\nCourt:\nI'd like to start out by addressing the\nquestions concerning Nyquist and the basis for\ndistinction. I would refer specifically to 463 U.S. page\n398, and there this Court, when it distinguished -- in\nMueller, when it distinguished Nyquist said, in this\nrespect, as well as others, this case is vitally different\nfrom the scheme struck down in Nyquist. There, public\nassistance amounting to tuition grants was provided only\nto parents of children in nonpublic schools -- pardon\nme -- in nonpublic schools. This fact had considerable\nbearing on our decision striking down the New York statute\nat issue, and then it goes on. It talks about Allen and\nEverson.\nSo this Court made it very clear in Mueller that\nthere was an important distinction between that and\nNyquist.\nQUESTION: Does the money went to children --\nthe money went to families with children in nonpublic\nschools, but that's exactly what's happening here.\nMR. YOUNG: Your Honor, if --\nQUESTION: Aren't the vouchers just for people\nin the nonpublic schools?\nMR. YOUNG: Your Honor, it isn't exactly the\nsame at all. In Nyquist --\nQUESTION: Well, am I right that the vouchers\nare just for people in nonpublic schools?\nMR. YOUNG: In this case, no, Your Honor. We\nhave tutorial vouchers for people in public schools, and\ntutorial vouchers for magnet schools and community\nschools.\nQUESTION: Speaking of the tutorial vouchers,\nwhy is the number of tutorial vouchers limited to the same\nnumber of vouchers paid to the private schools?\nMR. YOUNG: Well, I would -- Your Honor, I would\nsuspect the answer to that is to try to provide some form\nof equality and to make sure that there was no Government\nendorsement of one choice or another, so the equality of\nhaving the same number of grants for tutoring being the\nsame as the same number going for scholarships.\nQUESTION: Of course, the amount of money is\nvastly different, isn't it, because the -- I forget the\nfigures exactly, but isn't the limit on the tutorial\nsomething like $350 a student, as opposed to the $2,000-\nsome-odd limit on the tuition vouchers?\nMR. YOUNG: Your Honor, there is a difference,\nbut there is less a difference than the difference between\nthe public school and the nonpublic school deductions\ntaken in Mueller.\nQUESTION: Well, you wouldn't limit it to the\nvouchers anyway, would you? I mean, you would think that\nwe'd have to look at the money that goes to the community\nschools --\nMR. YOUNG: That is --\nQUESTION: -- which does not go via vouchers, it\ngoes directly to the schools, and it's a greater amount of\nmoney that goes to the private schools, isn't it?\nMR. YOUNG: Your Honor, I think the fact --\nthere is no question that when this program was initially\nimplemented, every single secular school in the district\nsigned up to participate. Additionally, two brand-new\nsecular schools were established by reason of this\nprogram, the two HOPE schools. They remained in the\nprogram until the Community School Act was adopted. That,\nindeed, doubled the amount of money available to the\nfamilies. In other words, the maximum scholarship grant,\n$2,250, and -- but if those same children elected to go to\na community school, the State would pay for each child at\nleast double the amount that it would pay if they selected\nthe scholarship --\nQUESTION: So what is actually involved? I'd\nlike to hear what you say about the endorsement point that\nJustice Souter initially raised, and my thought is, I'll\nassume no discrimination, and I'll assume it's a fine\nprogram, but imagine you came from Europe or Africa, or a\ndifferent place, and said, what do they do in the United\nStates by way of educating their children, and you're\ntold, well, $60 billion a year, $40 billion, or some very\nlarge amount of money is being spent by the Government to\ngive children K through 12 what is basically a religiously\noriented education taught by a parochial school. Wouldn't\nyou then say, in the United States of America, like France\nor like England, the Government of the United States\nendorses a religious education for young children by\nputting money up, massive amounts?\nNow, I'm putting it that way to get your\nresponse, and that's the problem that bothers me most\nabout the word, establishment.\nMR. YOUNG: Thank you, Your Honor. There is no\ngovernmental endorsement of religion in this program, and\nthere are several reasons why there isn't. The first,\nYour Honor, reason would be the amount of money that is\nspent, first of all, on a public school education, which\nis approximately $8,000, the amount of money paid for a\ncommunity secular education, $4,500, and the maximum\namount provided to a family that selects a nonpublic\nschool, $2,250.\nSo if -- the first thing you look at is the amount of\nmoney that is spent depending on the nature of choice made\nby the child, and the preference, the -- in that instance\nis clearly a preference for the secular schools.\nSecondly, Your Honor, if you look at the\nhistory, as well as the context of this particular\nprogram, this program was adopted because of one of the\nmost serious educational, public school crises in the\nUnited States, and I think anyone trying to determine what\nwas the Government doing, was it endorsing religion, no.\nThe Government was trying to permit low income\neducationally disadvantaged children who were trapped in a\nfailing system to exercise an alternate choice.\nSo I think any person -- the Cleveland district\nhas been in litigation, Your Honor, for some 20-plus\nyears, in Federal court, because of the difficulties that\nhave been encountered in the public school system. I\nthink anyone looking at this legislation as it was adopted\nand as it was implemented would conclude that there is\ncertainly no Government endorsement of religion.\nThe Government was trying to resolve a problem\nof these disadvantaged low income children, and giving\nthem alternate choices, which parents ought to have in any\nevent so that's certainly another reason. When no money\nflows, not a dollar flows to a religiously sponsored\nschool under this program, but for the independent,\nprivate choice of a parent. The State does not direct a\ndollar to a religiously sponsored school. No --\nQUESTION: There's an irony, I -- are you -- is\nthat --\nMR. YOUNG: I could go on, Your Honor, but --\nQUESTION: No, if -- I mean, the irony is that\nthe better the parochial school, in a sense, the less the\nfreedom of choice. I mean, I -- if it were my children\nand I saw these comparisons, I'd say, send them to the\nparochial school. Would you like them to learn that\nreligion, I'd say, frankly not, that's not my religion,\nbut it's very important my child get the best education,\nand therefore I would be feeling I had to send them there,\nif that's what I want.\nMR. YOUNG: Your Honor --\nQUESTION: I mean, no one's complaining about\nthe quality of the program. It's this concern about the\nendorsement, and not even that that's what they intend,\nbut that that's the effect.\nMR. YOUNG: For reasons I've already noted, Your\nHonor, I believe there is no governmental endorsement, and\nyou have to realize that the overwhelming majority of the\neligible children elected to remain in the public school,\nand incidentally there are --\nQUESTION: I assume Justice Breyer could send\nhis child to one of the community schools, which is\nentirely nonsectarian, under this program, right?\nMR. YOUNG: Your Honor, that's another\nalternative, and I think we --\nQUESTION: Which schools would get more money\nthan the sectarian schools anyway.\nMR. YOUNG: Your Honor, I see that as another\nreason why no one could say there's a reasonable message\nof governmental endorsement in this case.\nQUESTION: And you agree that the Sixth Circuit\nerred. Was it legal error? The Sixth Circuit said,\nwe're not going to take account of the community schools\nbecause that's a whole other program. This case was about\nthe voucher program. In the district court, what\ndevelopment was there about the community schools?\nMR. YOUNG: Your Honor, the same approach was\ntaken by Judge Oliver, but I don't feel that the Sixth\nCircuit really understood how the community school program\nworked, or how one could use the tutorial vouchers to help\nthe children that elected to go to the community schools.\nQUESTION: Well, there's really no record on the\ncommunity schools, you're saying, because you weren't\npermitted to make a record?\nMR. YOUNG: Your Honor, there is an extensive\nrecord in affidavits in terms of the creation of the\ncommunity schools, the transfer of the two secular\nscholarship schools to community school status. The\nchildren who were enrolled as scholarship pupils in the\nscholarship secular schools just transferred when those\nschools became community schools, so this legislation\nclearly enabled the same children, the same low income,\neducationally disadvantaged children to elect a community\nschool, so there is record evidence to that extent, Your\nHonor. Why the Sixth Circuit refused to consider the\ncommunity schools is beyond me.\nThe -- I think in order to fully understand the\nchoice issue, Your Honors, I think you have to really look\ninto more detail into the tutorial grant program. We\nhaven't addressed at all the subject of the --\nQUESTION: Do we have to link the two programs\ntogether to resolve the case --\nMR. YOUNG: Your Honor, I believe not.\nQUESTION: -- the tutorial program and the money\npaid to the parents and endorsed over to the schools in\nthe case of choice? Do we have to consider both together?\nMR. YOUNG: Your Honor, I would consider them\ntogether, but it was -- it's the, all of the indicia of\nchoice, not just the endorsement.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Young.\nGeneral Olson, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,\nSUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS\nGENERAL OLSON: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nI'd like to follow up on the point that was just\nbeing made. This Court has taught repeatedly that the\nhistory, the context, and the purpose for programs like\nthis are a very, very important part of the determination\nof what the endorsement test or the effects test would be.\nThere is no question that the purpose that inspired, and\nthe history and the context that inspired the Ohio pilot\nprogram could not have been more compelling and more\nfocused on the needs of children.\nQUESTION: No, but I would think you would say\nthe program was still constitutional, even if it was just\nconceived in the healthiest school system in the world.\nGENERAL OLSON: Well, perhaps, Justice Stevens,\nI might, but this -- as this Court has taught repeatedly,\nthe background history and the context informs the\ndecision which this Court has endorsed with respect to\nwhat the effects or endorsement test would be, measured by\nwhat a reasonable, objective observer would believe the\nState or the Government was doing, is the Government\nendorsing religion, and that has to be considered in the\ncontext of what was going on.\nHere we have a manifestly failing system in\nwhich -- no one disagrees with that. Efforts had been\nmade, and a Federal court had decided the system had to be\ntaken over.\nQUESTION: The thing that puzzles me about that\nargument is, why did they make this wonderful solution\navailable to such a small percentage of the student body?\nGENERAL OLSON: I would invite the Court's\nattention to page 41 of the Taylor petitioner's brief,\nwhich contains a chart which shows the various choices\nwhich were made available to the students as a result of\nthe composite, the context of the program that we're\nconsidering.\nIt shows -- that chart shows, along with the\nother statistics in the brief, that there are 57,000\nstudents in the school system. 16,000 went to the magnet\nschools, 2,000-and-some are going into the community\nschools -- these are present facts -- 3,700 accepted\nscholarships to use in religiously affiliated schools,\n1,400 accepted the tutorial program, and another 100-and-\nso took scholarships with respect to nonreligiously\naffiliated schools.l There were more nonreligiously\naffiliated schools available, but two of those, the major\nones, decided to become community schools.\nI would like to invite the Court's attention --\nQUESTION: Mr. Olson, I didn't quite understand\nJustice Stevens' question. You acknowledge that it was\nmade available only to a small number of the students?\nGENERAL OLSON: No. I -- what I meant --\nQUESTION: I thought the program was available\nto all the students.\nGENERAL OLSON: I stand corrected. What I mean\nto say, the choices were -- there was a broad range of\nchoices, but the program itself was made available to all\nof the students.\nQUESTION: Any student could have gone into a --\none of the community schools, or to one of the private\nschools, isn't that right?\nGENERAL OLSON: That's correct, and the record\nis quite clear on this, also. Any student who wanted to\ngo to a nonreligiously affiliated private school, no\nstudent who wanted to do that was declined the opportunity\nto do that, so your child, Justice Breyer, could have gone\nto a nonreligiously affiliated school.\nQUESTION: Ah, but there doesn't seem to be a\nrecord on this very clear, that my impression was really\nthe parochial schools are an awful lot better.\nGENERAL OLSON: Well, I think that's an\nimpression that you may have, but --\nQUESTION: So are we supposed to send the case\nback? Does it turn on that?\nGENERAL OLSON: No, no. There's no record\nevidence to support that. Remember, this is a pilot\nprogram, an experimental program. The best evidence may\nbe found in the affidavit or declaration of Howard Fuller,\nwho was the former superintendent of the Milwaukee system,\nwho watched the Milwaukee system develop and get put into\npractice. That's at the joint appendix pages 228 to 236.\nDuring the period of time that the Milwaukee\nprogram has been in existence, the number of private,\nnonreligiously affiliated schools have increased from 7 to\n30, the number of students in those private,\nnonreligiously affiliated schools has increased tenfold,\nfrom 337 to 3,025.\nHe also points out that the existence of the\nalternative has improved the public school systems as\nwell. Parents are involved in the choice of the\neducational opportunities for their children. He\ndemonstrates they get more involved in the school system.\nQUESTION: General Olson, if a private\nindividual challenges a State law as unconstitutional, the\nburden of proof is on that individual, isn't it, to show\nthe necessary facts to establish unconstitutionality?\nGENERAL OLSON: Yes, Mr. Chief Justice,\nabsolutely, but the record here goes even further than\nthat, because the record that is available shows these\nmany alternatives. It shows that when the program has\nbeen allowed to exist free of constitutional objection, it\nhas shown improvement at the student level, and\nimprovement at the public school level as well as the\nprivate school level.\nLet me emphasize that in response to the\nquestion Justice Souter raised at the very beginning of\nthe argument, it isn't just neutrality, but there is\nclearly neutral criteria here for opting in or out of the\nprogram.\nAnother factor that the Court has thought was\nimportant in the past was, the parents have an option not\nto participate in the program, and that's a part of the\noptional choices that are available.\nQUESTION: I want to ask how the courts faced\nwith this challenge have to view the case. Must they view\nit as having the whole range of options available, public\nschool, magnet, community, and religious schools?\nGENERAL OLSON: Yes, Justice O'Connor, I believe\nthat is the correct context.\nQUESTION: And why did the court below not do\nthat?\nGENERAL OLSON: I think the court made a legal\nerror in failing to do so, because this Court has taught\nover and over again that the context is extremely\nimportant --\nQUESTION: Now, is it limited only to low income\nchildren, or does it just -- does that affect the amount\nof money to be given?\nGENERAL OLSON: It affects both the amount of\nmoney to be given and the preference. To the extent that\nthere are any limitations on the program at all, the\npriorities are given to low income students on the\ntheory --\nQUESTION: There's only a finite amount of money\navailable.\nGENERAL OLSON: Well, that's always the case, of\ncourse --\nQUESTION: Right.\nGENERAL OLSON: -- in any Government program,\nbut the priorities are given to the low income people.\nThe evidence that's in the record demonstrates that the\nvast majority of these scholarships are used by people at\nthe poverty level. The rationale for that, of course, was\nthat people in the higher income level can afford the\nalternative.\nQUESTION: Now, there was no attempt in the\nprogram to make sure that the money that ends up in the\nparochial schools is not used for religious training, or\nteaching. There have been other Federal programs, for\nexample, where there have been such limitations on usage.\nThere's none of that here.\nGENERAL OLSON: That's correct, Justice\nO'Connor, but the Court has made the point in connection\nwith those types of programs that there's a significant\ndifference between a direct aid program, where funds are\ngoing from the Government to the school, as opposed to the\nprivate, genuinely independent, purely private choice\nprograms where the choices are being made by individual\nparents, and being made by individual parents motivated by\nthe best education for their children.\nSo to go back to the reasonable observer test\nwith respect to endorsement, would a reasonable observer\nbelieve that the Government's putting its thumb in favor\nof religion on the scales here under all of these\ncircumstances, the wide range of choices --\nQUESTION: May I ask on that very question, do\nyou think these alternatives are essential from a\nconstitutional point of view, or would you make the same\nargument if there were merely the one choice, religious\nschool or the private school?\nGENERAL OLSON: I think applying the standards\nthis Court has adopted, that if the criteria are\nneutral -- and I'm answering -- I'm saying yes.\nQUESTION: The criteria is neutral. You can\neither go to the public school, or you can go to the\nparochial school, and if you go to the parochial school,\nwe'll pay the tuition.\nGENERAL OLSON: Which we're also offer -- yes.\nYes.\nQUESTION: I understand there's a lot more here,\nbut what would you do with that case?\nGENERAL OLSON: I think if there was a purely\nneutral criteria in terms of eligibility for the program,\nand it's a purely private choice, that the -- because this\nCourt has emphasized that we're looking at whether the\nGovernment's being -- going to be perceived by a\nreasonable observer as endorsing religion, if it is a\npurely private choice program, the teaching of this Court\nis, it's not unlike a Government check that goes to an\nindividual who then spends it, all of it on his church.\nQUESTION: My hypothesis is, it's purely\nprivate. Either I'll go to the parochial school or the\npublic school, and the Government doesn't care which one.\nGENERAL OLSON: It's purely neutral --\nQUESTION: And you would say that's perfectly\nall right.\nGENERAL OLSON: Well, I would probably be making\nthat argument in another case. I don't have to make that\nargument here, because we have all of these other\nalternatives, including private schools.\nQUESTION: But I'm trying to decide whether\nthose alternatives are constitutionally necessary, or just\nmake your argument stronger.\nGENERAL OLSON: Well, I think that what this\nCourt has taught, that because these establishment Clause\ncases are so difficult, that they are made in the context\nof the particular facts of the case, and that the facts\nand circumstances in history illuminate what the\nGovernment was involved in, because we're not talking\nabout --\nQUESTION: Why don't we -- why don't you --\nwell, I know why you don't stress, but why shouldn't we\nstress as one of those facts the bottom line of 96 percent\nof the kids taking the tuition aid, or taking it in\nparochial schools?\nGENERAL OLSON: Well --\nQUESTION: And doesn't that suggest that there\nis perhaps something specious about this notion that it's\na matter of wide-open choice here? In practical terms,\nthe money is going to end up where it ends up, and the 96-\npercent figure is pretty persuasive.\nGENERAL OLSON: That was the same factor in the\nMueller case, and one of the other cases that has been\ncited, the Court said that is not of constitutional\nsignificance. We're not going to --\nQUESTION: Oh, I'm asking you a question about\npractical significance, and why do we eliminate that fact\nfrom our judgment about what in the real world seems to be\ngoing on?\nGENERAL OLSON: Because those choices this Court\nhas said are the result of purely private choices, and\nthat that will not be associated by a reasonable observer\nwith a governmental decision.\nQUESTION: Thank you, General Olson.\nMr. Chanin, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT H. CHANIN\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS SIMMONS-HARRIS, ET AL.\nMR. CHANIN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nUnder the Cleveland voucher program, millions of\ndollars of unrestricted public funds are transferred each\nyear from the State Treasury into the general coffers of\nsectarian private schools and the money is used by those\nschools to provide an educational program in which the\nsectarian and the secular are interwoven. It is a given\nthat, if those funds are properly attributable to the\nState, the program violates the Establishment Clause.\nWe submit that the answer to that attribution\nquestion is yes, and it is yes because, regardless of the\ndecision that individual parents may make, it is\ninevitable, it is a mathematical certainty that almost all\nof the students will end up going to religious schools\nthat provide a religious education --\nQUESTION: Well, Mr. Chanin, wait just a minute.\nA couple of things. Do we not have to look at all of the\nchoices open to the students, the community schools, the\nmagnet schools, et cetera? How is it that we can look\nonly at the ones looking to the religious schools?\nMR. CHANIN: The limitation to looking at the\nvoucher program as a freestanding program is consistent\nboth with the precedents of this Court and with absolute\nlogic, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: I don't understand either point, to\ntell you the truth. I mean, if you want to look at what\nthe parents' choices are, do you not have to look in\nreality at the whole program, then it isn't a 96-percent\nthing?\nMR. CHANIN: Your Honor, this Court has always\nbeen program-specific in its financial aid cases. In\nNyquist, the Court looked at three separate programs under\nthe one statute, viewed them all in independent terms, and\nviewed them all independently of whatever else was going\non in the New York City Public Schools and New York State.\nQUESTION: But I'm not sure that's proper.\nThat's what I'm asking you. Why should we not look at all\nof the options open to the parents in having their\nchildren educated?\nMR. CHANIN: Because what that does, Your Honor,\nis, it mixes together programs that are quite\nqualitatively different in both function and purpose. The\nmagnet schools, the charter schools, the tutorial program,\nthose are all ways in which the State is attempting to\ndischarge its basic legal obligation to provide a public\neducation for all of its students.\nQUESTION: But the question is whether or not --\nMR. CHANIN: All of the parents are entitled --\nQUESTION: The question is whether or not there\nis neutrality in this program, and it seems to me that if\nyou ask us to put on blinders, and not inquire as to\nwhat's really happening in Cincinnati, what really was the\nreason for this, what all of the choices are, that you're\nasking us to make a decision based on an a fictional\npremise.\nMR. CHANIN: Your Honor, I think we're doing\nprecisely the reverse. We are asking you to look at the\nreality. What the State of Ohio has set up here --\nQUESTION: You're asking us to look at part of a\nreality.\nMR. CHANIN: No, Your Honor. We're asking you\nto look at a special benefit that the State of Ohio is\nmaking available to a selected group of parents over and\nabove the benefit that they have, along with all other\nparents, to send their children to a public school. That\nbenefit is a qualitatively different benefit to take my\nchild out of a public school and put my child into a\nprivate school and be educated with public money.\nQUESTION: You don't have any problem with that.\nYou say it would be perfectly okay if it went to a private\nschool. It's only the portion of it that goes to a\nprivate school that is religiously affiliated that you\nobject to, isn't that right?\nMR. CHANIN: No. What I am saying --\nQUESTION: Oh, this money could not even go to\nnonsectarian private schools?\nMR. CHANIN: Pardon me, Your Honor?\nQUESTION: This money could not, in your view,\neven go to nonsectarian private schools?\nMR. CHANIN: Yes, it could, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: It could, and that would be a\nrational way for the State to provide for the education of\nchildren --\nMR. CHANIN: It would be a constitutional right.\nQUESTION: -- some in publicly run schools and\nsome in private schools, but if any of those private\nschools is a religiously affiliated school, that is a no-\nno.\nMR. CHANIN: No.\nQUESTION: -- and that, in your view, is\nneutrality?\nMR. CHANIN: No, Your Honor, that is not my\nposition. We are not saying, if any of those schools are\nsectarian it is a no-no, or the program fails. We are\nsaying, if you take a program which is designed to give\nparents the option to go out of the public schools and\neducate their children in a private school, and then you\nsay to 99 out of 100 of those parents, if you choose that\noption, you must send your child to get a religious\neducation, that is not --\nQUESTION: Well, the percentage in Mueller was\n96 percent.\nMR. CHANIN: I believe, Your Honor, that this\nCourt, this case is not controlled by Mueller, for the\nvery same reason that Mueller was not controlled by\nNyquist. The Court distinguished a Nyquist-type program\nin Mueller on three grounds, all of which are equally\napplicable here. The Court --\nQUESTION: The State does not say here, as you\nput it, that you must go to these religiously affiliated\nschools. What you're saying is, they happen to be the\nschools that are currently up and running. In fact,\noriginally in this system it wasn't -- what is it, 96\npercent you say? Originally it was something much lower,\nsomething like 62 percent, except that two of the schools,\ntwo of the largest nonsectarian private schools, decided\nto be come community schools, so originally it was a much\ndifferent percentage. Are we supposed to examine this\nprogram year by year to see what the percentage is?\nMR. CHANIN: No, Your Honor. What we would like\nthe Court to do is take the language of this program and\nlook at it, not simply on its face, but in the empirical\ncontext in which it will operate. Let me give you the\npercentages, if I may, just to track what you have done.\nThis started out in 1996 with 80 percent of the\nschools being sectarian and 80 percent of the students\ngoing to those schools. By 1999, 2000, the universe had\nbecome even more skewed toward the religious. It was 82\npercent of the schools and 96 percent of the students.\nQUESTION: But isn't that because some of the\nprivate schools had become community schools, and is it\nnot true that parents can choose to have their children\neducated in a community school and, if they do, that\nschool gets more money from the State than if they had\nchosen the religious school? If anything, it's skewed\nagainst the religious schools --\nMR. CHANIN: Your Honor --\nQUESTION: -- in terms of public support.\nMR. CHANIN: I think there are two parts to your\nquestion, if I may take them in sequence. The first is,\nwhy is the universe moving in the direction it is, and\njust, if I may, to complete the point, we now have this\nyear 99.4 percent of the students in that program going to\nreligious schools.\nQUESTION: So far, you're doing a very good job\nof not answering Justice O'Connor's question.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. CHANIN: Well, the answer to it is this,\nJustice Kennedy. From our perspective, it is not\ndeterminative why the universe is the way it is. From the\npoint of view of the --\nQUESTION: Well, but now, wait a minute. Why do\nyou not put the community schools and the magnet schools\nin the universe of choices? That's the problem I'm having\nwith your argument. You say the figures are skewed, but\nthey're skewed only because you will not look at those\nchoices. Why?\nMR. CHANIN: We do not look at them for two\nreasons, Your Honor. One is that the Court in Nyquist\nexplained why it did not go beyond the program itself. It\nsaid this. If you extend the -- if you look at the\nchoices that parents have to go to public schools as well\nas the vouchers in the private schools, you allow, through\nthe tuition grant program, to do precisely what the\nEstablishment Clause prohibits, which is to use tuition\ngrants to pay totally for private, sectarian religious\neducation, the Court said. It's a back-door approach to\ndo precisely what the Establishment Clause prohibits.\nSecondly, people talked a moment ago about\nperception, and I think they're completely mistaken. This\nis the perception. The reasonable observer does not look\nat public education and the multiple, changing, various\nprograms that are offered. The person looks at this. The\nState of Ohio has set up a special, well-publicized\nprogram which allows a certain number of students to\nescape from a troubled school district, and appropriates a\npot of money into that program, and what the reasonable\nobserver sees is, that program and that pot of money ends\nup 99.4 percent giving children a religious education.\nQUESTION: Mr. Chanin, that's only true if you\nsay the person is reasonable in not looking at all the\nchoices, which include community schools, certainly.\nMR. CHANIN: Your Honor --\nQUESTION: And probably magnet --\nMR. CHANIN: Your Honor, if it extends that way,\nthere is no meaning any more to the concept of genuinely\nindependent and private choice. We don't need magnet\nschools. We don't need community schools. We should just\nsay, you people have 57,000 options. You can stay in the\nCleveland public schools, or you can leave that school\ndistrict, take public money, and go get a religious\neducation. The magnet schools, the community schools,\nthey're not unique. They're part of the way in which a\nState provides a public education. There are small\nclasses and large classes. There's distance education,\nand face-to-face education. Magnet schools have been\naround for 50 years.\nQUESTION: But suddenly it changes, and it's\nnot education any more if you're getting it in a religious\nschool. Why is that?\nMR. CHANIN: We're not saying it's not --\nQUESTION: Unless there's an endorsement of\nreligion involved here, I don't see why the fact that some\nof the money, even most of the money goes to religious\nschools makes any difference.\nMR. CHANIN: Well, because you have a basic\nproposition that we build our case on, which the Court has\nadopted, and it is this. If public money that is\nreasonably attributable to the State is used to pay for a\nreligious education, it violates the Constitution. The\nonly way in which it's not attributable to the State is if\nit doesn't go there by virtue of a State action or a State\ndecision, but the circuit is broken, and the circuit is\nbroken because in between, standing between the State and\nstanding between the schools, is an independent party with\ndecisionmaking to divert it away.\nThere is no intervening party with\ndecisionmaking here. The parents play a ritualistic role\nin the transmission process, and if I am a parent, and I\nam holding a voucher in my hand, I can say, where can I\nuse it, and 99 of my 100 choices is, send my child to a\nreligious school.\nQUESTION: Well, suppose it weren't that number.\nI mean, our decision, I take it, would have to govern lots\nof programs in lots of school districts, and suppose that\na particular program in a particular school district was\nset up for the best possible reason, educate the children,\nand there's no other way, and suppose, too, that you would\nhave very, very good parochial schools, and also some\nvery, very good private schools, and let's suppose the\nnumbers were several hundred million dollars, and so\nparents getting the money, about half of them sent them to\nparochial schools and about half of them sent them to\nprivate schools. Now, suddenly, does the constitutional\nbalance change?\nMR. CHANIN: Not in my mind, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: And so all this 99 percent doesn't\nmake that much difference. Why not?\nMR. CHANIN: It -- I focus on it because it\nmakes it clear to the Court, I hope, that this isn't even\na close-to-the-line case. This is so far to the polar end\nof the continuum that even if the Court may, in particular\ncases, have to make judgments on the specific facts, this\nis not one of those cases.\nQUESTION: All right, so what is your response\nif it's 50-50, and you have hundreds of millions of\ndollars, and --\nMR. CHANIN: My response is --\nQUESTION: -- what they're saying, remember, is\nprivate --\nMR. CHANIN: My response is it's\nunconstitutional.\nQUESTION: Because?\nQUESTION: Your response --\nMR. CHANIN: Because of the criteria that this\nCourt used in Witters. What the Court used in Witters, it\ndidn't just say the program is constitutional in Witters.\nIt told us why it was constitutional. It said, it's\nconstitutional because the aid recipients have generally\nindependent and private choice, and then the Court went on\nto say what that meant.\nIt said, Witters could choose from a huge\nvariety of options, most of which were secular. It said\nthat only a -- an insignificant portion of the total\nprogram money will end up going to sectarian schools.\nThose were the criteria.\nIt seems to me there may be a case, a different\ncase, in which the Court will have to determine what do\nthe words, substantial portion, significant amount, huge\narray of choices mean, but the Court does that all the\ntime. It's the normal line-drawing.\nQUESTION: No, but let me sure I understand --\nMR. CHANIN: This is not a line-drawing case.\nQUESTION: Let me just be sure I understand your\nposition. Supposing there are 10 schools out there, 10\nprivate schools, nine of which are nonreligious, and one\nof which is religious, but the Government money will pay\nthe tuition of the -- for the parents who choose the\nreligious school. Is that, in your view, consistent with\nthe Establishment Clause or not.\nMR. CHANIN: Oh, that's clearly\nunconstitutional, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: So even if it's 10 percent.\nMR. CHANIN: Oh, no. That -- I'm only -- I'm\nresponding to I think --\nQUESTION: So we've got two extreme --\nMR. CHANIN: -- Justice Breyer put to me was,\nthere's a choice --\nQUESTION: See, the interesting thing, if I\nunderstand the case correctly, your view is, if any one\nschool gets the money, it's unconstitutional.\nMR. CHANIN: No. No, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Oh, I thought you said yes.\nMR. CHANIN: No. I'm sorry if I -- I did not.\nOr, I may have, but I didn't mean to.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: Well, what is your answer if there\nare 10 schools, nine nonsectarian, one sectarian?\nMR. CHANIN: I think that is a borderline case,\nbut if it's structured this way, I'm a parent --\nQUESTION: Well, say there are 100, and 99\nnonsectarian and one --\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: Give us something that isn't\nborderline.\nQUESTION: Well, I'm really trying to find out\nwhat your position is.\nMR. CHANIN: I think I can explain it relatively\nsimply. If Government money that is attributable to the\nGovernment is paid directly to a religious school to pay\nfor a religious education --\nQUESTION: Well, my hypothetical --\nMR. CHANIN: -- it's unconstitutional.\nQUESTION: -- is that in this -- and the\nGovernment says -- you pick your school. There are 100 of\nthem out there. One of you picks a parochial school,\nwe'll pay the tuition.\nMR. CHANIN: Okay.\nQUESTION: We'll send a check direct to the\nschool.\nMR. CHANIN: All right.\nQUESTION: That's unconstitutional?\nMR. CHANIN: But do I also --\nQUESTION: And your opponent says it's\nconstitutional if 100 percent, so --\nMR. CHANIN: But I have to know the choice\nyou're giving me as an aid recipient. Are you saying to\nme, I can use that money at this one religious school, or\nat the other 99?\nQUESTION: No, I want to use that money at that\none -- my private choice is to have my child go the\nsectarian school.\nMR. CHANIN: Absolutely violates the\nEstablishment Clause, in my opinion.\nQUESTION: Why?\nMR. CHANIN: Because certainly I can say,\nwithout hesitation, nothing broke the circuit between the\nState and the general coffer of the sectarian school, your\naid recipient in your hypothetical had no choice\nwhatsoever. The only choice was to stay in the public\nschools or go into a religious school. That is not the\nkind of choice that this Court referred to in Witters or\nin Nyquist.\nQUESTION: Well, what if, in Justice Stevens'\nhypothetical, the State would pay the tuition to the\nnonsectarian private schools, too?\nMR. CHANIN: Oh, I think that's Witters.\nQUESTION: What breaks the circuit in my 50-50\ncase? You say it doesn't break the circuit, but they're\nsaying, well -- the petitioners say, we gave the money to\nthe individuals. It was the individuals who decided, and\nthey had an equal choice between church-related schools\nand private ones, other ones, and so that broke the\ncircuit. Now, your response to that is what?\nMR. CHANIN: My response to that is, if this\nCourt concluded that the words, significant amount, huge\narray of choices, if the Court concluded, as an abstract\nproposition, that those standards were met on 50-50, I\nwould be most unhappy, but I would conclude that the\nprogram was constitutional.\nQUESTION: No, no, but give me -- not the case,\nbut give me the rationale.\nMR. CHANIN: The rationale is this. We need to\nbreak the circuit. The only case --\nQUESTION: They say it does. Now, forgetting\nthe cases, they say it does, so why doesn't it?\nMR. CHANIN: Well, I would not forget the cases.\nI'd say, I don't accept what they tell me. I want to hear\nwhat you've said, and I would say the one case in which\nyou allowed financial aid to go to pay the tuitions of a\nreligious school was Witters, and then I'd say to myself,\nwhy did you do it in Witters, and words would pop out to\nme, huge array of options, only an insignificant portion\nwould end up in sectarian schools. That, said the Court,\nis genuine, independent private choice, because of the\nnumbers.\nQUESTION: Well, let me ask you this. Suppose\nthe program were, if the parent chooses the sectarian\nschool, we'll give you a voucher of $2,500. If the parent\nchooses the community school, we'll give you a voucher of\n$4,500?\nMR. CHANIN: Your Honor, it's an unreal\nhypothetical.\nQUESTION: Well, it's not, because in effect\nthat's what's happened here.\nMR. CHANIN: No, it isn't because the --\neverybody --\nQUESTION: The community school gets $4,500 a\nhead, and parochial school $2,500, so if it were done by a\nlittle voucher working that way, then what is your answer?\nMR. CHANIN: It would be no -- it would be un --\na violation of the Constitution.\nQUESTION: Would it?\nMR. CHANIN: And it would be because --\nQUESTION: It wouldn't be perceived as --\nMR. CHANIN: I think it would, Your Honor. That\nis no different than saying\nQUESTION: -- giving undue help, or endorsing\nthe religious school.\nMR. CHANIN: It's no different than saying, you\ncan take a voucher, you can leave public education and go\nto a religious school, or you don't limit it to community\nschools, or, I'll give you money to go to a community\nschool, I'll give you money to go to a magnet school, I'll\ngive you money to go to a traditional school.\nThe choice that you are positing for me is, the\nchoice is between staying in the public schools with\nwhatever the public schools may offer --\nQUESTION: Well, we haven't been --\nMR. CHANIN: -- or leaving to go into private\nschool.\nQUESTION: We haven't been referring to\ncommunity schools as public schools. The public school\nsystem that failed was the traditional old public school\nsystem in the community. The community schools are\nbasically private schools that are getting a different\nkind of State aid. Why shouldn't they be considered?\nMR. CHANIN: They are not private schools, Your\nHonor. They are public schools. They are subject to\nGovernment control. They are just a method or a mechanism\nby which the State has chosen to provide a species of\npublic education. There is a bright line distinction\nbetween the public school system in which the community\nschools fit, and private education in which the voucher\nparents can take their money. It is simply --\nQUESTION: Do these community schools have to\naccept all-comers?\nMR. CHANIN: There are certain -- they cannot\ndiscriminate on certain bases. There are a lot of --\nQUESTION: Right, but can they say, we're only\ngoing to take kids who pass a certain test, a certain\nentry exam?\nMR. CHANIN: I'm not sure you can base it on\nacademic achievement.\nQUESTION: It doesn't sound much like the public\nschool system to me.\nMR. CHANIN: Pardon me?\nQUESTION: It doesn't sound much like the public\nschool system to me.\nMR. CHANIN: Well, it is, Your Honor. Magnet\nschools do that.\nQUESTION: Well, but why is there the bright\nline that you talk about which separates community schools\nfrom private schools and aligns them with -- other than\nthe fact that they're run by the Government? Here, the\ncommunity schools, as I understand it, were set up because\nthey wanted to get away from the kind of failing system\nthat so many public schools are, and do something\ndifferent.\nMR. CHANIN: Because, Your Honor, if the concept\nof breaking the circuit is going to have any meaning, you\nhave to draw a line, and the only rational line to draw is\nbetween public education and private eduction.\nQUESTION: Well, but you've said that time and\nagain --\nMR. CHANIN: I --\nQUESTION: -- but you can tell members of the\nCourt are --\nMR. CHANIN: I say it because --\nQUESTION: Well, I --\nMR. CHANIN: I didn't mean to interrupt you,\nYour Honor.\nQUESTION: You'd better not.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. CHANIN: Is it too late?\nQUESTION: You can see a number of members of\nthe Court are really not satisfied --\nMR. CHANIN: No.\nQUESTION: -- with that explanation.\nQUESTION: May I ask this question, is it true\nthat the group you put on one side of the line, there's no\ntuition in those?\nMR. CHANIN: There is no tuition.\nQUESTION: So those are all free schools,\nsupported -- where the others, there's tuition. That's\nthe line, isn't it?\nMR. CHANIN: Can I -- could I try once again on\nanother --\nQUESTION: By all means.\nMR. CHANIN: -- example here?\nThe prototype that this Court has set out for us\nof genuine, independent, and private choice, is a\nGovernment employee. The Government can pay that employee\nthe paycheck, and that -- even knowing that the employee\nintends to donate all or part of it to a church, all, with\nno constitutional problem, because the employee has\nindependent discretion. He can spend that paycheck any\nway he wants, for whatever purpose he wants, with no\ncontrol or direction from the Government.\nNow, you use that as your analogy of genuine and\nindependent choice. You don't say that Government\nemployee has independent choice --\nQUESTION: Mr. Chanin --\nMR. CHANIN: -- because he didn't have to come\nwork for the Government in the first place.\nQUESTION: Mr. Chanin\nMR. CHANIN: He had all kinds of options. He\ncould have worked everywhere else.\nQUESTION: Mr. Chanin, may I ask you a question,\nbecause I think we understand the case of the Government\nemployee turning over his paycheck to the Salvation Army,\nor whatever.\nSuppose the suburban schools had been included\nin this mix, that instead of saying, come in if you want,\nand then the reality is that none of them do, suppose all\nthose school districts surrounding the city were made to\nbe part of the program, and the parents had the choice of\nsending their children to those public schools, or to the\nreligious private schools, would you then say that --\nwould it make any difference, that is, if the public\nschools in the suburban communities were made to\nparticipate in this program?\nMR. CHANIN: It would make a difference, but I\ncould not answer as to whether it would be constitutional\nor unconstitutional as far as the program is concerned,\nuntil I saw the specifics of that program, are those\npublic schools a really meaningful type of choice for an\ninner city child in Cleveland, and I'd also have to make a\nlegal analysis of whether that really is just another way\nin which the State of Ohio is providing a public\neducation.\nQUESTION: Mr. Chanin, can you tell me how we\nget from here to there? Here we have a failed inner city\nschool system, and the State says, part of the problem\nwith this is monopoly. We just have to provide diversity,\nlet parents choose a good education.\nNow, it so happens that the only up-and-running\nschools that happen to be in the inner city are religious\nschools, educating the poor people in the city at\nrelatively low rates. The State of Ohio adopts a program\nwhich allows suburban schools to accept these inner city\nkids, but the suburban schools say, oh, heck no, we don't\nwant the inner city kids come into our suburban schools.\nHow does one get from here to there? The only schools\nthat happen to be there right now are religious schools.\nThis doesn't mean that the program will always\nbe that way. The experience in Milwaukee was that as the\nprogram continued, there were more and more nonreligious\nprivate schools, but right now, to start off with, of\ncourse they're mostly religious, and that is going to\ndestroy the entire program, so that we can never get from\nhere to there.\nMR. CHANIN: I do not believe, Your Honor, that\na crisis in the Cleveland public schools is a license to\nignore the mandate of the Establishment Clause, nor do I\nthink it's a mandate to say, ignore it for a while because\nin a few years it may --\nQUESTION: Tell us how to get from here to\nthere.\nMR. CHANIN: I will tell you, Your Honor --\nQUESTION: What do you do, abolish all the\nreligious --\nMR. CHANIN: No.\nQUESTION: -- schools in the inner city --\nMR. CHANIN: No. No.\nQUESTION: -- and then start from scratch --\nMR. CHANIN: I'll tell you just what it should\ndo.\nQUESTION: -- so that all the schools that start\nup won't be religious?\nMR. CHANIN: What the State of Ohio should do in\nthis specific case is exactly what the Ohio supreme\ncourt's been telling them to do for 10 years to deal with\nthe problems in Cleveland. It's telling them, there are\ninnovative programs within the public schools, refinance\nyour schools, provide resources, and do that. Instead --\nQUESTION: They've spent already $7,000 per\nchild, which is above the average in the rest of the\ncountry. It isn't a money problem.\nMR. CHANIN: The --\nQUESTION: It's a monopoly problem.\nMR. CHANIN: No, Your Honor, not according to\nthe Ohio supreme court. According to the Ohio supreme\ncourt, which just struck down as inadequate the financing\nstructure of the Ohio school system and has been directing\nit for 10 years to restructure it and put in more remedial\nclasses, smaller classes, free kindergarten classes --\nQUESTION: Mr. Chanin, it's very clear to me\nthat Ohio had that option. The question is, is it\nunconstitutional for them to choose an option that they\nthink has more likelihood of success, and Justice Scalia\nput the point that what they're trying to do is have a\nstructure in which different school systems, different\ncurriculums, curriculums that do not inflict terminal\nboredom on students, can begin to flourish, and the\nquestion is, how can they do that in the long term, and\nyou say they cannot do it.\nMR. CHANIN: No, I say this, Your Honor. I say\nthat the Ohio legislature has the right to make an\neducationally unsound judgment. It does not have the\nright to make an unconstitutional judgment. It must solve\nthe problems in Cleveland within the parameters of the\nEstablishment Clause, and as the brief that -- the amicus\nbrief filed by the National School Boards Association\nindicates, there are numerous programs that were available\nto it. There are problems being solved in urban school\ndistricts all over the country without voucher program.\nWe have not said much about the educational\nvalue vel non of voucher programs, because we don't think\nthat this is a forum for an educational policy debate, but\nthey are a lousy option, and we refer you to the amicus\nbrief of the National School Boards Association. The\nevidence is conflicting. There is no evidence that\ncompetition improves the lot for the 96 percent of the\nstudents who remain in the troubled Cleveland Public\nSchool System with less resources and even worse problems.\nIf there are no further questions, thank you,\nYour Honor.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Chanin.\nMr. Frankel, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MARVIN E. FRANKEL\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS GATTON, ET AL.\nMR. FRANKEL: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nComing in at this point, I come in in a way\ntoward the beginning and also toward the end of Mr.\nChanin's argument. The discussion of this problem long\nago began with talk of a crisis in the public schools of\nOhio, and that talk in a strange way has gotten lost in\nthe shuffle as the Court has ranged widely, necessarily\nbut widely, over Establishment Clause questions for which\nI am now about to submit this may be a strangely\nincongruous vehicle for a decision.\nAs was just pointed out toward the end of what\nMr. Chanin was saying, you had a determination sometime\nago by the supreme court of the State of Ohio that its\nsystem of public school financing is unconstitutional\nunder Ohio's own constitution. Now, we in our submissions\nearly felt that that was an important threshold question\nto be looking at, very possibly before you got into big,\nFederal constitutional questions, and so we have briefed\nit. We briefed it in the Sixth Circuit, and we briefed it\nin this Court.\nSomewhat remarkably, that question of whether\nOhio's school financing system is unconstitutional under\nits own constitution --\nQUESTION: But Judge Frankel, wasn't that on the\nground that it used the single subject title, rather\nthan --\nMR. FRANKEL: No, Your Honor, it had nothing to\ndo with that case. That was a quite separate case called\nDeRolf, which was decided in 1997. Under that decision,\never since 1997, Ohio's system of financing its public\nschools has a) been unconstitutional as a matter of Ohio\nconstitutional law and b) under ongoing repair, which is\nin progress this very day, and is approaching completion\nof repair.\nQUESTION: Judge Frankel, you are going to tie\nthis in to the question presented in this case?\nMR. FRANKEL: I hope so, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: That was a program designed to rescue\neconomically --\nMR. FRANKEL: I hope so, Your Honor --\nQUESTION: All right.\nMR. FRANKEL: -- for this reason, because I want\nto raise a question whether this Court doesn't reach hard\nquestions first is present here, whether the much-debated\nEstablishment Clause questions are as essential as the\nCourt has been led to believe they are in this case, and\nwhether a decision leaving the Establishment Clause\njurisprudence where we think it should stay will be an\nappropriate resolution for the interests of Ohio and its\npoor children.\nQUESTION: Your assumption, Judge Frankel, is\nthat the problem is a problem of money. That's all that\nthe supreme court of Ohio --\nMR. FRANKEL: Is what, Your Honor?\nQUESTION: Is a problem of money --\nMR. FRANKEL: Not only --\nQUESTION: -- and the studies that I'm familiar\nwith suggest that that is not the case.\nMR. FRANKEL: Whatever people suggest --\nQUESTION: Please let me finish, sir.\nMR. FRANKEL: I'm sorry.\nQUESTION: The studies that I'm familiar with\nsay that the inner city parochial schools, which spend\nmuch less per child on education, do a much better job\nthan the public schools that spend much more, so I just\ndon't think it follows that once you solve a\nconstitutional problem that will get more money, you're\ngoing to solve the difficulty that the people of Cleveland\nfound with their public schools. I don't think that\nnecessarily follows.\nMR. FRANKEL: Your Honor, there is mostly\nanecdotal material comparing the kind of job that's done\nin parochial and secular schools.\nQUESTION: Oh, I don't think it's anecdotal at\nall. I mean, there are extensive studies that show that\nparochial schools do a better job.\nMR. FRANKEL: With all --\nQUESTION: I mean, these are studies by, you\nknow, educational scholars.\nMR. FRANKEL: With deference, Your Honor, I\ndon't think that the difficulties that I'm trying to\nsuggest about the Court's getting into the details of some\nof the Establishment Clause cases that have been mooted\nhere are avoided by looking what is said to be a\ncomparison between parochial schools and public schools.\nCertainly, as you compare the subject of\naffluence from district to district, which was the guts of\nthe Ohio decision that I refer to, the problem of\ncomparative qualities changes quite markedly, and you\ndon't have the same kind of problem. In fact, what you\nhave in Ohio, and a basis for the holding of\nunconstitutionality, is vast regional disparities between\nthe public schools in affluent districts and the public\nschools in impoverished districts.\nQUESTION: Mr. Frankel, did you make this\nargument to the court of appeals?\nMR. FRANKEL: Yes, Your Honor. We raised --\nQUESTION: And how did they deal with it?\nMR. FRANKEL: Well, Your Honor, it sort of\nslipped by --\n(Laughter.)\nMR. FRANKEL: -- but we made a point that -- let\nme put it this way. I think in fairness to me and the\ncourt of appeals, arguments undergo some sea changes as\nyou go from court to court. We raised this 1997 decision,\nDeRolf, as a threshold problem that ought to be looked at\nbefore you got into wide Establishment Clause questions.\nOn the Establishment Clause, I should add we are\nas one with our friends here.\nQUESTION: Did you cross-petition for certiorari\nin this case?\nMR. FRANKEL: No, Your Honor, we didn't think we\nhad any occasion to do that.\nQUESTION: You brought the lawsuit, though. You\nbrought the lawsuit.\nMR. FRANKEL: We won the lawsuit.\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. FRANKEL: And we didn't believe -- I still\ndon't believe we had occasion to do that.\nNow, what's happened --\nQUESTION: Mr. Frankel, may I ask you, has\nthe -- have the Ohio courts ever passed upon this\nquestion? I know they passed on the single statement\nissue under the Constitution. Was that issue before the\nOhio courts when they passed on the single issue matter?\nMR. FRANKEL: The Ohio supreme court, Your\nHonor, in what we consider obiter, said it found\nconsistency with the Establishment Clause, but it had\nalready held its statute unconstitutional on State\ngrounds, so we never could reach that. That's why we came\nto the Federal court. Now -- so we've never had that\nquestion adjudicated.\nQUESTION: But the fact that it issued the\nobiter indicated that it was not concerned with the point\nthat you're now making, and that's the highest court of\nthe State.\nMR. FRANKEL: It was not concerned with -- I\ndidn't hear Your Honor.\nQUESTION: With the point that you're now\naddressing to us.\nMR. FRANKEL: No, Your Honor, it didn't take\nproper concern of everything that we thought it should\nhave looked at. What I am saying is that in the midst of\nOhio's efforts, which are almost completed, to resolve\nwhether Mr. Justice Scalia has the answer or not, the\ngreat core problem of public education in Ohio, in the\nmidst of that, they come slicing across this situation,\nhaving held their own system unconstitutional in 1997, and\nthey create this voucher program.\nWell, there we are. We're served up with a\nvoucher program, so we look at it, and looking at it, we\nhave argued, and Mr. Chanin has sufficiently covered that,\nthat it is unconstitutional, and we think their effort to\ndefend it is somewhat slap-dash, especially, for example,\nwhen they try to defend proselytization in a few hasty\nparagraphs, overturning 50 years of precedent, as they\nwould hope, and saying proselytization with Government\nmoney is okay, where we say that the law since 1948 has\nbeen to the contrary, and that's because this voucher\nprogram came in, as it were, by the ears, while they were\nbusy working on other, more fundamental things that may\nwell -- and I don't know, Mr. Justice Scalia, and I don't\nthink any of us knows that may well go far to solving --\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Frankel.\nMR. FRANKEL: Thank you, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Ms. French, you have 4 minutes\nremaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JUDITH L. FRENCH\nON BEHALF OF THE STATE PETITIONERS\nMS. FRENCH: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, I\nhave four points.\nFirst and foremost, the Ohio supreme court\nupheld the constitutionality of this program under the\nEstablishment Clause, and approved its use as one solution\nfor solving the problem in Cleveland and for any school\ndistrict that might find itself in a similar unfortunate\nsituation.\nSecond, it appears that respondents have either\nignored or do not accept the last 20 years or so of this\nCourt's jurisprudence. Each of the legal principles they\nhave raised here today and in their briefs have been\nexpressly rejected by the Court.\nTheir reliance on percentages was expressly\nrejected by this Court in Mueller. Their arguments about\nsubstantiality of the aid going to religious schools was\nrejected by five members of the Witters Court.\nTheir question about indoctrination, or\nproselytization, has been specifically rejected by this\nCourt in the cases involving true private choice, Mueller,\nWitters, Zobrest, and confirmed again in Agostini and\nMitchell most recently.\nThird, and Your Honor, I believe this goes to\nyour question, Justice Breyer, and your concerns, Justice\nO'Connor, about the breadth of options that are offered to\nall Cleveland students, the State of Ohio has looked to\nevery conceivable educational option available, to include\nall Cleveland students, to include all-comers in terms of\nstudents and schools.\nQUESTION: Are community schools public schools\nin Ohio?\nMS. FRENCH: They are considered public schools,\nYour Honor.\nQUESTION: They have separate boards?\nMS. FRENCH: They do.\nQUESTION: Separate employees?\nMS. FRENCH: They do. They do have separate\nemployees.\nQUESTION: And not the same control over content\nof programs?\nMS. FRENCH: That's right, Your Honor. It is\nseparately, it's not --\nQUESTION: It's publicly financed?\nMS. FRENCH: Yes, Your Honor, and it does have\nthe same sorts of financial requirements. They get\naudited a little differently. There are more controls,\nbut it is slightly different, because it's not --\nQUESTION: They charge tuition, though? They\ncharge --\nMS. FRENCH: Community schools do not charge\ntuition, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Do not charge tuition?\nMS. FRENCH: And in answer to your question\nearlier to Mr. Chanin, it's open to all-comers. If they\nhave -- if they don't have enough spaces available for all\nwho have applied, they must accept students on a lottery\nsystem the way that a public school would have to accept\nall-comers. The scholarship program, though, among all of\nthis array of options, is really the poor relative. They\nget less money, parents have to pay tuition, and they get\nno tutorial grants.\nPerhaps the best way to describe the array of\noptions is that at the eye-level of parents. This Court\nhas said it is important in Rosenberger and again in\nJustice Powell's concurrence in Witters, that it is\nimportant to view all of the circumstances, view all of\nthe consequences as a whole.\nWhat respondents seem to want us to do is\nexclude the religious schools as an option. This Court on\nmany occasions has told us that we can neither inhibit nor\nadvance religion, and that would certainly be the cause\nthere.\nFinally, it is apparent from the Court's\nquestions and respondents' arguments that the Ohio general\nassembly had a number of competing and conflicting\nconsiderations before it in the face of and in an\nenvironment of an educational crisis it needed to solve,\nand to solve quickly. It seems that Ohio did it right.\nIt didn't take too much money away from the public\nschools, but gave enough for a limited program that is\ntargeted to the most needy, the poorest of the poor, the\nlow income students who would not otherwise have choice.\nIt is for that reason that we ask the Court to overturn\nthe decision of the Sixth Circuit and uphold this program.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Ms. French.\n"
