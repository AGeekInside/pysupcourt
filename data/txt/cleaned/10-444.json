KOSTER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nBut for counsel's error, defendant would\nhave insisted on going to trial. That is the test for\nprejudice. But in Mr. Frye's case, that test was not\nmet. The truth is, despite counsel's error, Mr. Frye\nknowingly waived his right to trial and solemnly\nadmitted his guilt. Under both Hill and Premo, Mr. Frye\nhas failed to show prejudice, and therefore his guilty\nplea remains voluntary, intelligent, and final.\nMr. Frye may not assert ineffective\nassistance by alleging that, but for counsel's error, he\ncould have gotten a better deal on an earlier date.\nThat is not the standard. And the court of appeals\nshould be reversed.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, sometimes one's\nexperience has to be challenged. I, for one, have never\nheard of a case in which parties are discussing a plea,\nexcept in the most unusual of circumstances, and they\nadvance a court date to enter the plea. In most cases,\nthey just wait till the court date and tell the judge:\nI'm ready to plead guilty.\nThis is such an unusual case, because the\nplea happens on day one. The court below is assuming\nthat between day one and day five, or three or four, the\nguy would have come in and pled guilty, would have\nadvanced the later court date?\nMR. KOSTER: Well, the plea -- the plea\noccurred on March 3rd, 2008 --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No, that's the second\nplea, but --\nMR. KOSTER: It went -- the -- right. The\nplea offer --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm talking about the\nplea deal.\nMR. KOSTER: The plea offer expired on\nDecember 28th, 2007, I believe, and --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: He commits the crime on\nthe 29th or the 30th -- he commits a second offense on\nthe 29th or 30th?\nMR. KOSTER: That actually was a fifth\noffense, but yes.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. My point is,\nhow reasonable could it be for the -- for a court to\nassume that the plea offer had been made and that he\nwould have taken it before the January court date that\nwas set?\nMR. KOSTER: It would be less than likely,\nbut not impossible, I would say. And it would depend on\na myriad of circumstances, many of which are as -- as --\ncould be just dependent on the defense counsel's own\npersonal schedule.\nBut the scheduling of a plea once -- once an\nagreement has been made between a prosecutor and a\ndefense counsel, the scheduling of a plea I think is\nlargely a basis of convenience and does not\nnecessarily -- is not necessarily based on the\npreliminary hearing date or any future scheduled date.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I suppose the\ndefendant might think, you know, there is really bad\nevidence out there that they don't have yet. And if\nI -- I want to nail this deal down as soon as possible.\nI mean, that would be a reason to -- to move things up\nand get the plea in early, wouldn't it?\nMR. KOSTER: It could be. I would say that\nthat is --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I mean, I don't know\nhow often that happens.\nMR. KOSTER: That's possible. I don't --\nright. But it's also exactly another reason to keep the\ndiscretion of offering these plea bargains and the\nability to take these plea bargains back solely in the\nhands of the prosecutors of the country.\nJUSTICE ALITO: I'm really puzzled by what\nas a practical matter is at stake in this case. Under\nthe State court decision, the defendant has the option\nof either pleading guilty to the charge, in which case\nhe will be right back where he is now, or he can insist\non a trial.\nAnd if he insists on a trial, you need to\nprove that he was driving with a revoked license. That\nseems to me -- if there ever was a slam-dunk trial, that\nseems to me that's the slam-dunk trial. You introduce\nthe records of -- showing that his license was revoked,\nand you have the officer testify on such and such a date\nhe was driving. So, I don't really see what is involved\nin this case.\nMR. KOSTER: The last part of the question\nwas?\nJUSTICE ALITO: I don't see what is at stake\nhere. I don't see what that -- as a practical matter,\nthis seems to be -- to me to be a case about nothing.\nAm I wrong? Am I missing something?\nMR. KOSTER: As a former -- as a former\nprosecutor myself, I would agree with this. This\ngentleman went into court. He had two options before\nhim. There was not a third option. The -- the plea\nthat was -- that left reality on December 28th was not\nthere on March 3rd. He had a binary choice between two\noptions on March 3rd. He chose not trial. By choosing\nnot trial, it leaves us without a situation where either\nHill or Premo prejudice can be shown.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But we take the case on\nthe assumption that he hadn't heard of the earlier\nbetter offer. Am I wrong about that?\nMR. KOSTER: In this case, the defendant was\nunaware of the earlier better offer. That is correct.\nBut in this case also, the defendant went out 2 days\nlater and picked up a fifth charge. So, one of the\nconsiderations that I think has to be left with the\nCourt is that the possibility that this particular\ndefendant was ever going to see this plea offer is\nalmost nil. This was his fifth arrest for driving while\nrevoked.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I mean, aren't we taking\nthis on -- isn't there an assumption that there's a\nfinding, or some lower court judge made a finding that\nif he had known about the better deal that was offered,\nhe would have taken it?\nMR. KOSTER: That -- what is in the record\nis that he would have taken the 90-day deal on the\nmisdemeanor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes.\nMR. KOSTER: But there is also an important\nelement in the record, that when he went in front of the\ncourt on March 3rd and the felony offer was given to the\njudge, which was 3 years and defer on probation plus 10\ndays' shock time, the judge in Columbia, Missouri, gave\nthe felony offer the back of his hand.\nAnd so, while, yes, the record says that --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, then that's a causal\nproblem. You're saying that, even if he had accepted\nit, it would have gone to the judge, and the judge would\nhave turned it down anyway. The judge wouldn't have\naccepted it.\nMR. KOSTER: If the judge --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Is that your point?\nMR. KOSTER: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, then there's a --\nsomebody must have found somewhere that this made a\ndifference.\nMR. KOSTER: That --\nJUSTICE BREYER: That the failure to tell\nhim about the special offer of the misdemeanor did in\nfact make a difference because he would have accepted it\nand he would have ended up with it.\nMR. KOSTER: Well, and that is the problem\nthat brings us here today. The Missouri Court of\nAppeals said that --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes.\nMR. KOSTER: -- through a -- a\nmisinterpretation, we believe, of the Strickland\nstandard and, more importantly, a misreading of where\nHill and Premo takes us. Cert was granted on this case\njust at the same time that Premo was very clearly\nre-articulating the Hill standard.\nAnd so, the court of appeals had gone back\ntowards Strickland with a very broad reading just as\nthis Court was coming down with an opinion that very\nclearly re-articulated the Hill standard, the two-part\nperformance and prejudice test.\nAnd that's what we are asking be reversed.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Suppose he had snapped up\nthis deal as soon as it was offered. By the time he\nappeared before the court to answer a formal plea of\nguilty, would the court have known that he had in the\ninterim been arrested yet again for driving without a\nlicense?\nMR. KOSTER: The court probably would have\nknown as a result of a pre-sentence investigation. And\nperhaps more importantly, Your Honor, the prosecutor\nhimself would have known about the -- the second arrest,\nand he would have withdrawn it.\nAnd if I may, it's not always -- we've\nconcentrated so far in the case before and today on\nsubsequent criminal actions. You know, back home in\nMissouri, the criminal reporting system, we still use on\nfive-part carbon paper that you've got to press hard\nwith a pen to get down to the fifth page. It is also\npossible that the prosecutor learns at a subsequent date\nof a criminal history that is -- that is material that\npredates the plea offer. And so, in both directions,\nit's important that prosecutors have full discretion to\ntake these pleas back.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, regardless, your\nlegal position is that there is no basis for setting\naside the plea if an earlier, better offer was not\ncommunicated.\nThat's your legal position, right?\nMR. KOSTER: My legal position is that a\nfinding -- a conviction was entered on March 3rd. He\npled guilty. The question before the Court is, what\nsatisfies a standard by which we are going to unwind it?\nA Sixth Amendment violation would satisfy that standard,\nand if -- if there was a Sixth Amendment violation, if\nthe plea was truly involuntary, we would unwind it.\nBut the search for a better deal that is\nantecedent to the events of March 3rd is not the Sixth\nAmendment violation that should begin unwinding --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: You say -- you say\nthere's --\nMR. KOSTER: -- 97 percent of the\nconvictions in the country.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- no Sixth Amendment\nviolation when the counsel fails to communicate a\nfavorable offer to the defendant. That's your position.\nMR. KOSTER: No. Respectfully, Your Honor,\nthat is not my position. My position is that\nineffective assistance is a two-part test, that there\nwas a performance breach in the failure to communicate,\nbut once the performance breach is accepted, then it has\nto be run through the Hill standard to find whether\nprejudice has occurred, and then we would find a Sixth\nAmendment breach. But we -- we do not get there\nlogically because the offer did not exist after -- after\nDecember 28.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I -- I didn't\nunderstand that to be your position.\nThere -- there is a statement in your brief\nthat the question is whether plea negotiations that did\nnot result in a guilty plea constitute a critical\nconfrontation that gives the rise to effective\nassistance of counsel during such negotiations. So, I\nthought your position was that so long as the plea\nnegotiations don't result in a guilty plea, effective\nassistance of counsel doesn't even come into the\nequation.\nMR. KOSTER: I -- there's a question in --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, you can say yes or\nno. I mean, you could retract -- retreat from --\nMR. KOSTER: Is the question --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- that, I suppose, if you\nwant.\nMR. KOSTER: Is the question whether I\nbelieve that plea negotiations are a critical stage?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: When they do not result in\na guilty plea.\nMR. KOSTER: I believe they are not -- I\nbelieve that -- that plea negotiations are not a\ncritical stage under the laws of this Court.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: That's what we took the\ncase for. We didn't -- we wouldn't have taken the case\nif we were concerned about what happened in March and\nwhat happened in February. We took the case because of\nyour position, that this is not a Sixth Amendment\nviolation in these circumstances.\nMR. KOSTER: I do not -- there is a factual\nquestion as to whether or not plea negotiations in this\ncase really ever engaged when all that ever occurred was\nthe prosecutor sent a letter to the defense attorney.\nOnly in the most technical of readings --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but we don't care\nabout that. You know, what do we care about that? I\nmean, we don't take cases to figure out those -- those,\nyou know, picky, picky factual questions. The issue\nthat I thought was important here is whether this is a\ncritical stage when -- when the defendant is not -- does\nnot accept the -- the plea and plead guilty.\nMR. KOSTER: Plea negotiations I don't\nbelieve are a critical stage, because the fate -- in the\nback and forth between a prosecutor and a defense\nattorney, the fate of the accused is not -- is not set.\nAnd these -- of course, these negotiations can take\nplace over a very long time. Either party can get up\nfrom the table and walk away at any time. And then,\nperhaps most importantly, the -- the dialogue of the\nnegotiations are not used against the defendant at\ncritical stages, which would contrast it, I suppose,\nwith a Miranda situation in a custodial interrogation\nwhere that would be a critical stage.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And if it were a critical\nstage, I suppose that counsel would be ineffective, not\nonly if he was a lousy lawyer and didn't know the law,\nbut if he was a bad negotiator. I mean -- right? Being\na good criminal lawyer means you -- you got to be a good\nhorse trader, right?\nMR. KOSTER: I agree that that would be one\nof the extensions, if critical stage analysis --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes. You tell him to turn\ndown a deal --\nMR. KOSTER: -- was applied to plea\nnegotiations.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- that in fact, you know,\nwas a pretty good deal, that would be ineffective\nassistance of counsel. So, you must -- you must know\nhow to handle yourself in the used car lot, right?\nMR. KOSTER: I understand that that would be\none of the ramifications --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: So, Mr. Koster --\nJUSTICE BREYER: This is on the basic\nquestion --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: It's -- it's very odd for\nyou to say that -- to me -- that this is not a critical\nstage. If it results in a guilty plea and the -- and\nthe attorney has not done sufficient research to uncover\na defense, it can be set aside then. So, it's -- so,\nyou're saying it's not a critical stage depending on\nwhat the end result is. That's very difficult.\nI thought we were going to tell attorneys,\nyou have an obligation during the plea bargain process\nto use professional competence. And you say, well, you\ndo or you don't. That doesn't make much sense.\nMR. KOSTER: My understanding, Your Honor,\nis that attorneys are guaranteed to the accused at\ncritical stages, such as arraignments, plea hearings,\ntrials, but then there is an implied guarantee that\ncomes with that critical stage, and that implied\nguarantee is that their -- that the attorney appointed\nwill do research, analysis, and preparation that\nprepares him for the critical stage.\nBut when David Boyce is sitting home on a\nSaturday night with a file open in his lap preparing for\na case on Monday, that moment is not a critical stage of\ntrial, on a Saturday night in his den, but it prepares\nfor, it is precedent to, a critical stage. And the\nfailure to engage in that preparation analysis can lead\nto performance and prejudice at critical stages, but it\nitself is not.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, the -- the\nquestion -- I make a counter-assumption. The problem\nthat I -- I have the feeling that I'd like you and the\nothers to comment on, is that you're worried deeply\nabout a practical problem, and that the practical\nproblem is that it would be too easy, as just was\nsuggested by the question, to find that the lawyer,\nafter the defendant is convicted, did a bad job during\nthe plea negotiation, in which case everybody will get\ntwo or three bites at the apple. And one of the reasons\nfor that is every brief has been lifting the standards,\nparticularly in respect to prejudice, from Hill, which\nwas addressing a different question. It was addressing\nthe question of missed -- bad performance by the lawyer\nat trial. And that's hard to track what the effects\nare, and it isn't that hard to say the trial was unfair,\ngive him a new one.\nThat won't work here, I don't think. So\nsuppose what we did, instead of saying there was no\nright, you simply said you have to prove with some\ncertainty, work out a standard, that there really was\ninadequate assistance during the plea bargaining, and\nyou have to show something more than a reasonable\nprobability that this would have led to the plea, et\ncetera. You have to show that it would have happened.\nOr you have a -- in other words, you have\ntwo tougher standards for this area, but you don't\nreject the idea of inadequate assistance of counsel\nduring the plea bargaining stage. I'd like people's\nviews, insofar as they are willing to give them, on that\nquestion.\nMR. KOSTER: Ineffective assistance of\ncounsel is a -- is a term of art, and it is a two-part\ntest. I believe that there can be performance breaches\nthat occur between -- at the -- at the plea bargaining\nstage, but that prejudice does not occur until we return\nto a critical stage, which is -- is when that -- when\nthat plea, when the product of that plea negotiation is\nreturned to a critical stage, and then it has critical\nstage protections over it, where the judge is there, and\nthere's an allocution and the rest of the protections --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, the open -- the\nopen plea that was made -- that's a critical stage. In\nfact, he took a plea. But he, I think, has a plausible\nargument that the plea he made, the open plea with no\nbargain in the picture, that that plea was not\nintelligently made because he didn't know that there had\nbeen an offer for him to plead to a misdemeanor rather\nthan a felony.\nMR. KOSTER: In Tollett -- may I?\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes.\nMR. KOSTER: In Tollett v. Henderson, the\nquestion of the defendant Mr. Henderson's knowing waiver\nin that case, where the breach was infinitely more\negregious in my view, which was the 1948 court packing\nthat occurred and the African American citizens were\nexcluded from that grand jury pool.\nMr. Henderson's lack of knowledge about a\nprevious constitutional deprivation was not -- did not\nmake his waiver unknowing. Same with the analysis in\nMcMann and in Parker and in Brady, to say there is no\nlimiting principle that will allow this omission to\nunwind the knowing quality of Mr. Frye's waiver and then\nnot open up the floodgates to all sorts of\npre-constitutional deprivations.\nI'd like to reserve the balance of my time,\nYour Honor. Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Yang.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF ANTHONY A. YANG\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,\nSUPPORTING THE PETITIONER\nMR. YANG: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nWhen a defendant pleads guilty --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Are you taking the same\nposition your -- I don't want to call him co-counsel --\nPetitioner's counsel is taking, that you are not\nentitled to an attorney at plea bargaining, unless you\nwaive your -- unless you waive your right to a trial?\nMR. YANG: No, we're not --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It's not a critical --\nMR. YANG: We are not taking the view. In\nthis case, the alleged deficiency is not really an\ninteraction between the prosecution and the defense\ncounsel in plea bargaining. The alleged deficiency is a\nfailure to inform the defendant of things the defendant\nwould want to know as going forward, and we're -- we are\nwilling to assume the defendant has a right to be\nproperly informed by counsel. But with any Strickland\nclaim, the relevant inquiry is whether or not the\ndefendant has shown cognizable prejudice as a result of\na deficient performance by the counsel.\nAnd when a defendant pleads guilty in open\ncourt, the conviction rests on the defendant's\nassertion, an admission of his own guilt, and his\nconsent that there be judgment entered, a judgment of\nconviction, entered without trial.\nAnd because the conviction rests on a\nconsent judgment, it wipes free antecedent\nconstitutional errors. The one challenge that --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: So, I think, Mr. Yang, what\nJustice Sotomayor was suggesting is that your position\ndoes in fact require you to say that if there were no\ncounsel at all in the proceedings, that would be\nperfectly -- you know, there would not be a\nconstitutional problem with that. Once he pleads\nguilty, it just wipes away the fact that no counsel has\nbeen appointed for him.\nMR. YANG: A -- a guilty plea wipes free all\nkinds of constitutional violations that went before.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No, but the guilty -- I\nmean, no, the reason that is not true is that the guilty\nplea must be entered with advice of counsel. You\nacknowledge that, don't you?\nMR. YANG: Correct. And the guilty plea --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So, the guilty plea doesn't\nerase everything if it has been entered without advice\nof counsel.\nMR. YANG: Correct. When the counseled\nguilty plea is entered, this Court has held that the one\nremaining challenge that would be allowed is the\nchallenge to the knowing and intelligent waiver of the\nright to trial, which is what the guilty plea is. Now,\nin order to show that you were prejudiced --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: So, does that mean, Mr.\nYang, a State could set up a system where it says we're\ngoing to do all our negotiating with the defendant with\nno counsel present in the room, but we're going to keep\na lawyer on board just in the courtroom to advise him\nwhether he should plead -- you know, what -- you know,\nto advise him about the plea that he has struck, even\nthough he struck this plea with no counsel in the room,\nand that would be perfectly okay?\nMR. YANG: We are not saying that -- that --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: All the negotiations could\nbe uncounseled.\nMR. YANG: We are not taking the position\nthat States can deprive counsel or deprive counsel from\nparticipation in the guilty plea process. But what we\nare saying --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Well, I don't understand how\nyou can say that. It seems --\nMR. YANG: No --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: You are saying that, because\nyou're saying that in the end, the guilty plea wipes all\nconstitutional error away.\nMR. YANG: Just as we're not saying that\nthere can be coerced confessions, not just like we're\nsaying that a statute can impermissibly burden the right\nto trial by putting a death sentence on -- that's\navailable only when you go to trial. We're not saying\nany of that is allowed. But what we are saying is\nwhen a -- and that was the Brady trilogy, Brady and\nMcMann and ultimately in Tollett, which led to Hill.\nWhat the Court recognized is when you plead\nguilty in open court, you are waiving your right to\ntrial. And the relevant inquiry, the only inquiry once\nthe defendant has admitted guilt, is to determine\nwhether or not the waiver of the trial rights were\nknowing and voluntary. And the reason that that is a\nrelevant inquiry is because you have a constitutional\nright to trial, and due process requires that the waiver\nof those trial rights be knowing, intelligent, and\nvoluntary.\nAnd in Hill, the Court confronted the\nquestion and said: You need to show deficient advice in\nthe context of pleading guilty; and in addition, you\nneed to show that that prejudiced you because, absent --\nif you had received proper advice, you would have\nactually not waived your right to trial; you would have\nasserted your right to trial and gone to trial. That's\nthe standard that applies.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: If defense counsel gives\nwrong information to the defendant about witnesses that\ncan testify on his behalf and so forth, very bad legal\nadvice, that's -- that can be ground for setting aside\nthe plea, correct?\nMR. YANG: It can, and because what's\nrelevant --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: All right, so -- and\nthat's because counsel pre the entry of the plea did not\nadequately advise his client.\nMR. YANG: Right, right. The key is that --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Why -- why is there no\nproblem when he doesn't adequately advise a client of\nearlier better offers?\nMR. YANG: It's a different prejudice. The\n-- when you plead guilty and your counsel has advised\nyou wrongly in a way that would have changed your mind\nabout the merits of going forward on trial, you can show\nthat the waiver of the trial right is something that was\nprejudiced. But because -- had you known, had you been\nproperly advised, you would have exercised the whole\npanoply of rights that the Constitution provides one who\ngoes to trial, not only a right to a trial by jury but\nall the trial rights that go with it.\nBut when you instead plead guilty in open\ncourt -- and the claim here is not that the defendant\nwould have exercised his rights to trial. The claim is\nhe would have waived his rights to trial either way.\nThat is not prejudice to the -- that would overcome the\nguilty plea, which again rests on --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Well, Mr. Yang, there are\ndifferent kinds of unfairness. One kind of unfairness\nis when you're badly advised and you, therefore, waive\nyour right to trial when you would have gone. But\nthere's another kind of prejudice, which is, you know,\nyou and 10 other guys are all in the same situation, and\nthose 10 other guys come up with a favorable plea deal\nbecause their lawyers are paying attention, and you come\nup with an unfavorable plea deal because your lawyer has\nfallen asleep. And to the extent that we have an\neffective assistance right that means something, that\nunfairness needs to be addressed by it, doesn't it?\nMR. YANG: Well, when -- again, once --\nwhether or not there was a prior error, once you plead\nguilty, the question is not whether there were other\ndeals on the table; the question is whether that waiver\nof --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Well, I guess that's the\nquestion. Why isn't that the question?\nMR. YANG: Well, right, but if it were the\nquestion, it would call into -- this Court, in -- in\ngoing back to Brady and then in Boykin, explained that\nwhat's -- the relevant question when you enter a guilty\nplea is whether you have waived your rights to trial\nvalidly. And, in fact, that has to be spread upon the\nrecord. Rule 11(b) has now been modified by this Court\nto go through the things you have to check to make sure\nthat that waiver of your trial rights are knowing and\nvoluntary.\nWhat we have here is not anything associated\nwith the waiver of trial rights. What really the\ndefendant is claiming is some entitlement be able to\ntake another deal that would not have resulted in trial.\nBut that is not relevant to the waiver of trial rights.\nThat would be recognizing another type of right. But\nthis Court has repeatedly held that there is no right to\na guilty plea, there is no right to plea bargaining;\nonce you have a plea agreement, there is no right to\nenforcement. The only rights that come into play is\nwhen that guilty plea is rendered into a judgment. And\nwhen you don't get there, but instead you plead guilty\nand you have waived your rights to trial, you have\nconsented to the entry of judgment, and even if you had\nreceived better advice you would have consented to\nthe -- you would not have gone forward to trial, you\nhave -- the basis on which the conviction rests remains\nvalid. And that's what --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You have admitted that you\ngot what you deserved, right?\nMR. YANG: Precisely. And this Court in\nPremo addressed the exact same question. In Premo,\nthere was a contention that had counsel done better\nbefore by filing a motion to suppress, it would have\nbeen in a better position to secure a better plea\nagreement from the prosecution. But the Court concluded\nthat, no, the relevant inquiry, once you have pled\nguilty, is whether or not you would have, if properly\nadvised, insisted on your trial rights and gone to\ntrial. That's the standard set forth in Hill. And the\nreason --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Yang, in your view,\nis there any situation in which a defendant could regain\na plea opportunity that he lost due to counsel's\nconceded inadequacy? And I think it is accepted that\nnot telling him of the plea offer was ineffective\nrepresentation. Is there any case where the defendant\ncould regain the plea opportunity that he lost?\nMR. YANG: If he pleads guilty?\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes. If he doesn't seek\na trial, right.\nMR. YANG: I'm sorry. I didn't catch that.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes. If he doesn't want\nto go to trial and he's going to plead guilty, is there\nany circumstance where he could regain that lost\nopportunity?\nMR. YANG: If he has -- if he has pleaded\nguilty and he validly waived his rights to trial because\nhe would not have asserted them, then I think under Hill\nwhat you have is a defendant who admits guilt, there's\nno real risk of any kind of error in that determination,\nand the judgment which must be set aside -- remember, we\nhave to set aside the judgment. The judgment rests on\nthe admission of guilt and the waiver of trial. The\njudgment cannot be set aside at that point, because this\nCourt has long recognized the -- the special force of\nfinality with respect to guilty pleas. That's because\n-- for several reasons.\nFirst, guilty pleas are an important part of\nthe system, and it would be -- both delay and impair the\norderly administration of justice any time we open\nanother avenue to challenge guilty pleas. But, two,\nonce the defendant has stood up in open court and\nadmitted guilt, there is almost no risk of error, and\nthe defendant has gotten the proper sentence and the\nproper conviction.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMR. YANG. Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Queener.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF EMMETT D. QUEENER\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. QUEENER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nGalin Frye entered a plea of guilty to\nfelony driving while revoked and was sentenced to 3\nyears in prison. His trial lawyer failed to inform him\nthat the prosecutor was willing to allow him to accept a\nplea offer to a misdemeanor charge and recommend 90 days\nin jail. Fundamental fairness and reliability of\ncriminal process requires that an attorney provide his\nclient information regarding matters in his case.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why? Why is it unfair for\nthe law to apply to this individual the punishment he\ndeserved for the crime that he committed? I mean, the\nobject of the system is to put -- is to punish people\nwho commit crimes in a certain degree.\nAnd here he admitted he did the crime, and\nhe got the degree of punishment that the law provides.\nWhat could be more fair than that?\nMR. QUEENER: Fairness includes a whole\nrange of sentencing options. And in this case, the\nprosecutor was making a determination of what was fair\nin this case when he made the offer.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Ex ante, I suppose you\ncould say that. But when you look at it later, it's\nclear that that would have been unfair. In fact, this\nindividual was perfectly willing to admit that he had\nbeen guilty of more than what the prosecutor had\noffered.\nMR. QUEENER: Part of the consideration that\na defendant has to make during the plea bargaining\nprocess or plea negotiation process is determining the\nliability that he's willing to accept in entering a plea\nof guilty.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's true, and he did\nthat when he entered the plea of guilty. You -- you do\nnot contest he was well advised when he entered that\nplea that it was knowledgeable and he admitted that\nthat's what he had done and was willing to accept the\ndegree of punishment prescribed by law.\nMR. QUEENER: Well, he was -- the guilty\nplea in terms of what he was admitting to, he was\nwilling to and had to agree that he had committed the\ncrime of driving while -- while revoked. But the plea\nwas open in terms of sentencing, and he was allowed to\nargue for something lower than the sentencing. He only\nknew that was the available options at that time.\nHe wasn't aware that the prosecutor had made\navailable an option to him to limit his exposure for\nthat offense to 90 days.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, I have a\ntwo-part question.\nMR. QUEENER: Okay.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. What exactly\nmade his plea unknowing or involuntary, number one?\nAnd, number two, identify the right he was\ndeprived of, substantive or procedural, by his\nattorney's failure to communicate the plea.\nMR. QUEENER: The plea was unknowing and\ninvoluntary because he was not made aware by his\ncounsel's unprofessional representation of all of the\ncircumstances available to him, the consequences of\nentering that guilty plea, that would have included the\n90-day on a misdemeanor if he had been aware of that.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Suppose he had been told\nthat -- suppose he had been told that, and the\nprosecutor said, well, yes, that's true; I made that\noffer, but it's off the table now. And apparently, this\nwas then off the table. So, what good would it have\ndone him to know about something that happened in the\npast but was no longer available?\nMR. QUEENER: Well, this offer was only no\nlonger on the table at the time he entered the plea of\nguilty, because it had expired, and that was a result of\ncounsel's ineffectiveness in failing to communicate that\nto him. The lower court, the court of appeals, made a\nfinding that this offer was available, and he could have\ntaken advantage of it before it expired. And that was a\nfinding by the court below.\nJUSTICE ALITO: No, I understand that, and\nit may have been unfair, but I don't see why it's\ninvoluntary. Because I don't see that -- advising him\nthat he had an option at some point in the past which\nwas no longer available really doesn't have much of a --\ndoesn't have any bearing on the voluntariness of his\nplea to a later less-favorable offer.\nMR. QUEENER: I -- that's -- it seems to me\nthat that's involuntary in the sense that he didn't know\nit then. It's not that it's involuntary now because\nthat he knows it. It was involuntary because he didn't\nknow it then.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, suppose the case in\nwhich a plea offer's made, not communicated, and\nexpires. Then there's a guilty plea hearing. And he\ndoesn't -- and the defendant enters a -- a guilty plea\nbut doesn't know about the prior offer. Is -- is there\ninjury?\nMR. QUEENER: There is if there is an\nincrease in sentence. And that's the situation here.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: No, is the plea\ninvoluntary? Is it -- pardon me. Is it unknowing?\nMR. QUEENER: It is --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And what would he -- what\nwould he have done had he known?\nMR. QUEENER: It's unknowing in the sense\nthat he did not know the full consequences of --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, you know, Judge, I'm\nreally sorry I didn't accept responsibility 3 months\nearlier.\nMR. QUEENER: What he -- what's unknowing\nabout that is the potential consequence that he is\nchoosing in deciding to plead guilty. And if I may,\nthat's the second part of your question. The right that\nhe has is the right to make fundamental decisions in his\ncase, one of which is to accept a plea bargain and plead\nguilty.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Doesn't -- doesn't the rule\nthat the plea offer may be withdrawn at any time by the\nprosecutor -- indeed, even after it has been accepted --\ndoesn't that well enough establish that there is no\nright to profit from that plea offer, that there is no\nconstitutional right he's been deprived of, given that\nthe prosecutor can withdraw it even after he accepts it?\nMR. QUEENER: That can be -- excuse me --\nthat can be -- excuse me -- that can be withdrawn at any\ntime by the prosecutor, but we're not arguing that there\nis a right to a particular plea -- a particular plea.\nHe is entitled to the right to make a knowing and\nvoluntary acceptance of a plea, a knowing and voluntary\nguilty plea, and that requires that he know all of the\ninformation. And the record that we have in this case,\nthere's nothing to suggest that that plea would not have\ngone forward. The mere potentiality for withdrawing the\nplea --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I -- I had hoped you were\nmaking some argument other than the knowing argument,\nbecause as prior discussion has shown, even if he had\nknown, it would have made no difference to whether he\naccepted the later plea.\nSuppose he had been told, \"oh, by the way,\nthere was an earlier plea. It's too late to accept it\nnow. Do you want to take this plea?\" He says, \"well,\noh, I'd like the earlier.\" \"I'm sorry, the earlier plea\nis gone. Do you want to take this plea or not?\" He\nwould have taken it.\nWhat does the knowledge of the earlier\nlapsed plea have to do with whether his guilty plea is\nknowing and voluntary? It doesn't seem to me to have\nanything to do with that. So, I --\nMR. QUEENER: Well, the knowing -- yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I thought you had some\nother argument that was somehow a right to profit from\nthe earlier offer. And I find it hard to see that\nright, given that the prosecutor can withdraw the offer\nand, indeed, even withdraw it after it's accepted.\nMR. QUEENER: The right is to enter that\nplea knowing the full consequences of what he's doing at\nthat point, which includes the limitation on his\nexposure for the offense. This is sort of a sentencing\nissue. And an increase in sentence is a -- is\nprejudicial.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But he's -- the Missouri\nSupreme Court said in what -- that the prosecutor --\nthey would not -- they would not order the prosecutor to\nrenew that earlier plea. So, they said the options were\nyou can get a new trial -- you can get a trial or you\ncan replead the open plea. But wasn't it -- didn't the\ncourt say we will not order the prosecutor to reinstate\nthe earlier offer?\nMR. QUEENER: That -- that is correct, Your\nHonor. Their finding, more specifically, I think was\nthat they did not feel like they were empowered to do\nso. We certainly believe that they can -- they are\nempowered to do so in the sense that this is a remedy\nprovided for a constitutional violation.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes, but what about as a\nconstitutional violation that, in a context of a world\nwhere 95 percent of all people in prison are there as a\nresult of bargaining and guilty pleas arranged with\nprosecutors -- in that context, it's fundamentally\nunfair to deprive a person of his liberty for 40 years\ninstead of 6 months because the lawyer which he is\nguaranteed fell down on the basic, fundamental, obvious\nduty of communicating the relevant plea agreement?\nMR. QUEENER: I agree with you completely,\nYour Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And you would also --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So, is there any support\nfor me?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. QUEENER: That -- that is the issue\nwhere, in terms of the sentencing outcome, this is\nknowledge that he is required to -- that's required by\nhis attorney to provide him a sentencing of --\ndifference is a -- is prejudicial, excuse me, under\nStrickland, and the remedy for -- I guess going back in\n-- even more basic than that -- is that that ineffective\nassistance of counsel is -- has to be remedied.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But if that's ineffective\nassistance of counsel, surely it is ineffective\nassistance of counsel to advise him to turn down an\noffer that he should have snapped up. Isn't that\nineffective assistance as well? If it's absolutely\nclear that this was a great deal, and the lawyer said,\nnah, you shouldn't take it -- is that ineffective\nassistance or not?\nMR. QUEENER: I'm going to have to couch\nthat in terms of saying it would depend on the\ncircumstances. What you have to look at --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I gave you the\ncircumstances. It's clearly a super deal. Any good\nlawyer would have told him to take it.\nMR. QUEENER: Okay.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And this lawyer says don't\ntake it.\nIs that ineffective assistance?\nMR. QUEENER: That would probably not be\nineffective assistance.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It would not be?\nMR. QUEENER: The question would then be\nwhether or not there is prejudice from that, and that --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No, it would be ineffective\nassistance, and the question would be prejudice. Is\nthat it?\nMR. QUEENER: I think an attorney can\nprovide reasonable representation in making that sort of\nan offer.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, give me a yes -- a\nyes or no to the question whether, if every reasonable\nlawyer would have told him to snap up this offer, but\nhis counsel tells him, no, turn it down -- yes or no, is\nthat ineffective assistance?\nMR. QUEENER: In that circumstance, it is\nineffective assistance, because he has to do what is a\nreasonable standard of representation.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Then we're in the soup.\nThen we're in the soup because every one of these pleas\nis subject to the contention that, oh, there was an\nearlier plea, or I should have -- I should have taken it\nbut -- I mean -- and I suppose that if he goes to trial,\nthen you would also say that trial should not have\noccurred because it was the ineffective assistance of\ncounsel that caused him to turn down the plea, and,\ntherefore, we're going to -- right -- retry it and set\naside the trial?\nMR. QUEENER: Under that circumstance, that\nwould --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes.\nMR. QUEENER: -- may well be --\nJUSTICE BREYER: But, now, you've read these\ncases, and now we're right on what I think is the point,\nbecause we've both defined a possible constitutional\nright, but there's a practical problem. All right?\nNow, the States and others have dealt with this on your\nside --\nMR. QUEENER: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- for the last 30 years.\nAnd, presumably, you, but not me, have read a lot more\ncases.\nNow, have they developed -- as you look\nacross those cases, are there some States or places that\nhave developed reasonably tough standards in respect to\nwhat counts as ineffective assistance and in respect to\nwhether it made a difference that would help to\nalleviate the concern that this would turn into a great\nmess? Which it hasn't, apparently.\nMR. QUEENER: As I understand these -- these\ncases, the -- the standards being applied are the\nStrickland standard. It's the high bar of deficient\nperformance and prejudice under Strickland. And --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, we get a lot\nof Strickland cases, and the lower courts do, too.\nMR. QUEENER: Correct.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's not much\ncomfort in terms of what the consequences of a decision\nin your favor would be.\nMR. QUEENER: I mean, that -- that's\ncertainly true. I mean, we -- we have --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, in the case -- where\nthe case goes to trial, prejudice isn't going to be very\nhard to prove. The person turned down a 5-year deal and\ngets -- and after trial is sentenced to 20 years. So,\nyou've got -- you're got prejudice right there, right?\nMR. QUEENER: Right.\nJUSTICE ALITO: So, there's always going to\nbe a very good argument for prejudice where a person\nturns down a favorable deal and then gets slammed after\na trial.\nMR. QUEENER: I'm -- I'm going to qualify my\nanswer a little bit because I think where -- what the\nCourt has to -- to keep in mind is the rational decision\nrequirement that I think was reiterated in -- in\nPadilla. You're going to have to look at whether or not\nthe defendant was making a rational decision in that\nchoice. It's not simply that there was another offer\nout there. It -- was the decision rational on the part\nof the defendant to accept or reject that offer that was\nthere?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel --\nJUSTICE ALITO: No, but the point is just\nthat -- I'm sorry.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, go ahead.\nJUSTICE ALITO: The point is just that\nprejudice isn't going to be very tough to show, is it?\nYou turned down a 1-year deal, and then later when that\nwas off the table, you accepted a 5-year deal.\nMR. QUEENER: That may well be the --\nJUSTICE ALITO: There's prejudice --\nMR. QUEENER: That may well be the easier\npart of the -- of the equation. But there's still going\nto --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Why? Because you have to\nshow a causal connection. So, you'd have to show --\nshow in the causal connection that he would have taken\nthat deal.\nMR. QUEENER: That's -- yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And if -- if you're going\nto use the words \"reasonable probability\" that he would\nhave taken it, it might be fairly easy to show. And\nthat's where in the back of my mind I'm thinking that\nmaybe we want something tougher than reasonable\nprobability, that you have to show that it really would\nhave made a difference.\nMR. QUEENER: I -- I think reasonable\nprobability is a -- is a workable standard that we've\nused for many years.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But you are -- you are\nleaving out of the picture the prosecutor's prerogative\nto withdraw his plea. That you said that the court --\nsaid it lacked authority to order the State to offer any\nbargain, but also the court said, I'm not going to\nrequire the prosecutor to renew an earlier offer.\nOne thing is clear in this case: The\nprosecutor did nothing wrong. The wrong was on the part\nof defense counsel. So, why should the judge disarm the\nprosecutor, take away the prosecutor's right to change\nhis mind?\nMR. QUEENER: The -- this is a remedy for a\nSixth Amendment violation, and that is to put the\ndefendant back into the position as nearly as possible\nas he would have been in at the time and at the time the\noffer was open. This is not a situation where the\nprosecutor is being ordered initially or the first\ninstance to make an offer; it -- this is being viewed as\nthe offer that was originally made is still available\nand open to the defendant.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but at the time, that\noffer could have been withdrawn by the prosecutor. And\nyou're saying now it can't be withdrawn. So, you're\nreally not putting him back in the situation he was in.\nMR. QUEENER: There's -- there's never going\nto be a perfect remedy for any of these violations, I\ndon't believe.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I think that's right.\nMR. QUEENER: Right.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And that's one of the\nthings that causes us to be suspicious of whether\nthere's a constitutional violation --\nMR. QUEENER: Well --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- because there really\nisn't any perfect remedy.\nMR. QUEENER: There can't be a perfect --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: In some cases, not even a\nclose to perfect remedy.\nMR. QUEENER: I think this is close to\nperfect, as close to perfect as we can get, which is\nwhat is required for Sixth Amendment remedies, that it\nmitigate it to the extent possible. And in those\ncircumstances where one party -- the interests of one\nparty may be infringed upon, if that happens -- they\ncan't be infringed upon unnecessarily. This is a\nnecessary infringement. The State bears the burden of\nineffective assistance of counsel, and if that's in a --\nan erroneous sentencing, then the State has to bear the\nburden for the erroneous sentencing.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel --\nJUSTICE ALITO: On the issue of --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'll go this time.\nCounsel, on page 24 of your brief, you quote\nAlford for the proposition that a valid plea must be a\nvoluntary and intelligent choice among the alternative\ncourses of action open to the defendant.\nMR. QUEENER: Yes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: On the next page,\nyou say when Frye entered his guilty plea before the\ntrial court, he was completely unaware that counsel's\nineffective delay had forever foreclosed those options.\nNow, I put the two of those together and\nfind you saying that this was a valid plea.\nMR. QUEENER: No, it was --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The question of\nvalidity is whether it's an intelligent choice, as you\nquote, among the alternative choices of action open to\nthe defendant. The next page you say these options have\nforever been foreclosed. So, they weren't open to the\ndefendant.\nMR. QUEENER: Well, those were foreclosed\nsimply as a result of trial counsel's ineffectiveness,\nwhich -- which caused him to be unaware that they had\nbeen ever available to him, so that -- that how the plea\nbecomes involuntary is not that he's aware of what the\nsituation is at the time that he's entering the plea,\nbecause there are many other circumstances that go into\nhis decision of whether or not to enter a plea. Those\nalternatives were only no longer available to him as a\nresult of counsel's failure to perform his duty\nprofessionally and communicate the offer.\nJUSTICE ALITO: On the issue of remedy, as\nthe Respondent are you not limited to the remedies that\nwere provided in the judgment of the State court?\nMR. QUEENER: No, I don't believe so,\nbecause the State court, the court of appeals, simply\nthought it was not empowered to put him back in the\nposition that he was in, and I think that is the remedy\nunder the Sixth Amendment for that violation.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, you didn't file a\ncross-petition, and there wasn't one granted. So,\naren't -- aren't you limited to defending the judgment\nbelow? Can you ask for a modification of the judgment\nbelow in your favor?\nMR. QUEENER: With the -- the second point\nin the -- in this case is, what is the appropriate\nremedy? And --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And that's -- is that the\nquestion that the Court raised?\nMR. QUEENER: Yes. Yes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So, the Court was\nexpecting you to address it.\nMR. QUEENER: But we did file the petition\nchallenging the -- the finding of the -- or the relief\nprovided by the court below.\nJUSTICE ALITO: You think that because we\nadded a question, that acts as the functional equivalent\nof a granted cross-petition that would permit\nmodification of the judgment in your favor?\nMR. QUEENER: No, but the last I -- the last\nI recall, that cert petition was still pending. I may\nbe wrong about that, I'm not sure, that it was just into\nthis case.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Are -- are you\nrecognizing that the remedy that the Missouri Supreme\nCourt did give was a futile remedy? That is, to plead\nguilty, to have another open plea or trial, because this\ndefendant apparently doesn't want to go to trial.\nMR. QUEENER: I think both of those are\nfutile remedies, and that's why it's really obvious that\nthe remedy has to be something else. This is not a\nsituation where he does have a very -- a very good\nlikelihood of succeeding at trial. That's not going to\ndo him any good. That won't get him a misdemeanor where\nhe'll be sentenced to 90 days. The open plea is\nbasically the same -- the very same thing that's causing\nhim the prejudice in this case. So, the remedy being\nprovided by Missouri Court of Appeals is essentially no\nremedy at all for the prejudice that he suffered.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But why should -- now\nthat we know what the judge's sentence was, and part of\nthe plea offer was remade, the part about -- what was\nit -- 3 years with 10 days in jail?\nMR. QUEENER: Yes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And the judge said, no,\nI'm not going to give him just 10 days; I'm going to put\nhim in jail for the whole 3 years. Now, if that's --\nthis is the sentence that the judge gave, he rejected\nthe -- half of the plea bargain, so surely he would have\nrejected the more generous one.\nMR. QUEENER: I -- I'm not sure that's\nentirely the only answer we can draw from this record.\nAt the time that this -- or this guilty plea was being\nentered and the sentence was handed down, this was an\nopen plea, it was not an agreement. If they had gone to\ncourt on a plea agreement between the prosecutor and the\ndefense, and that was up for a -- an amendment down to a\nmisdemeanor and a reduced charge -- you know, that is\nsomething more definitive. Then the judge would be\nlooking at what the parties had agreed to at that point.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I'm not sure I understand\nthe difference between an open plea and a plea\nagreement. He just comes to the judge and says I'm\nwilling to plead to this without the prosecution having\noffered it?\nMR. QUEENER: The open plea basically means\nthere is not an agreement between the parties. Now,\nthey may each know what either party is going to argue\nfor or recommend, but there's not an agreement between\nthe parties.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Okay.\nMR. QUEENER: And I think that -- would\nleave the court with a little more flexibility than --\nthan he might otherwise exercise if they came to him\nwith an agreement.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sorry. Just to make\nsure. I thought the earlier, the November 15th letter\nagreement --\nMR. QUEENER: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- always left it up to\nthe judge whether to accept either the felony with shock\ntreatment or the misdemeanor with 90 days. So, the\njudge was always free to reject either of those two?\nMR. QUEENER: I think the deference to the\ntrial court on probation was in that first one, the 3\nyears with defer to the court on probation. If they had\nagreed on the 90 days in the misdemeanor, that would\nhave been a plea agreement between the two parties.\nThat would have been a definitive --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, he could still --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Binding the judge?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: He could still --\nMR. QUEENER: Not binding the judge. No,\nthat would not bind the judge. It never would. The\njudge would have the opportunity, at that point -- the\nonly time -- the only thing the judge would have\ndiscretion over at that point would be the actual amount\nof sentence. If the prosecutor reduced that from a\nfelony to a misdemeanor, the judge couldn't reject that.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: He would have had to\naccept it.\nMR. QUEENER: He would have had to --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But he would not have\nhad to accept the 90 days.\nMR. QUEENER: He would not have had to\naccept the 90 days.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But you're --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What proof -- I'm sorry.\nWhat proof did you have in the record that the judge\nwould have accepted the 90 days?\nMR. QUEENER: I don't have proof in the\nrecord that he would have. What I have in the record --\nthere is nothing in the record to suggest that that\nwould not have happened. The appellate court found --\nin fact by making the determination that Mr. Frye was\nprejudiced, necessarily made the conclusion that that\nplea would have gone forward. The motion court said\nnothing to refute that. There was nothing in the\ncourt's findings that the court would not have accepted\nthat agreement had the parties come before it with that.\nIf there are no further questions --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nGeneral Koster, you have 2 minutes\nremaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CHRIS KOSTER\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. KOSTER: Thank you, Your Honor.\nTwo of the Justices questions raised the\nconcept of sentencing equivalency. And certainly\nsentencing equivalency is an important goal, both at the\nFederal system and we've tried at the State system. But\nsentencing equivalency is not an avenue that the Sixth\nAmendment is intending to reach. The essential question\nhere, to Justice Breyer's earlier question that I think\nI didn't answer properly, is should we begin unwinding\nthese convictions in search of lost plea opportunities?\nI think that we should not. It undermines\nthe -- there were long discussions in both Hill and\nPremo about the importance of the finality of these and\nour being able to rely on the finality of these\ndecisions. There's mutual reliance. There's State\nreliance as well because, when these offers are made,\nthe State does not interview witnesses, the State does\nnot send evidence to the lab, the State does not, you\nknow -- sometimes even get to the point where the\ncharges are made. So, there's State reliance and --\nwhich is synonymous with a reliance of justice on the\nfinality of these agreements as well.\nAnd also, the search for these lost\nopportunities that Mr. Frye is asking this Court to lead\nus toward takes a point of representation beyond the\nlimited scope of the Sixth Amendment in Gonzalez --\nGonzalez-Lopez and other courts, the limited -- the\nlimitation of the Sixth Amendment that this Court has\nalways appropriately articulated.\nFor this and other reasons stated in our\nbriefing, the Missouri Court of Appeals should be\nreversed. Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you counsel.\n"
