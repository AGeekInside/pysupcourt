Newdow.\nMr. Cassidy.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF TERENCE J. CASSIDY\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. CASSIDY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe daily recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance\nto the flag by millions of school children across our\ncountry does not violate the Establishment Clause.\nPetitioners submit that the decision of the Ninth Circuit\nCourt of Appeals was incorrect for two reasons. First,\nrespondent lacks standing to assert the claims in this\ncase, and second, the school district policy of willing\nstudents reciting the pledge with the words, one nation\nunder God, is a patriotic exercise that is part of an\nunbroken history of official government acknowledgment of\nthe role of religion in American life.\nThe issue of standing in this case is one of\nfirst impression for this Court. Respondent seeks to\ninvoke the aid of a Federal court to override the state\nfamily law court in an ongoing custody dispute. We look\nto the state law to define the rights of parents involved\nin custody disputes. The state court custody order in\neffect both at the time this matter was pending before the\nNinth Circuit Court of Appeals, as well as before this\nCourt -\nQUESTION: Counsel -\nMR. CASSIDY: -- has limited -\nQUESTION: Counsel, on the standing issue,\nnormally, I guess, we defer to the courts of appeals in\ndeciding issues of state law. Now, I guess the California\nSupreme Court hasn't really weighed in on this question\nand the Ninth Circuit seems to have relied on some court\nof appeals decisions in making its decision about\nstanding.\nNow, normally we would just defer to that,\nwouldn't we, and move on to the merits? Is there some\nreason why we shouldn't do that here?\nMR. CASSIDY: Well, it is our position, Your\nHonor, that the Ninth Circuit made an incorrect analysis\nin -\nQUESTION: Well, maybe they did, but is it not\nthe case that we normally defer to courts of appeals on\nquestions of state law on issues of standing?\nMR. CASSIDY: I would say the Court does defer at\ntimes. However, the Court has the right, and in this case\nthe obligation, to reassess the rights when those are\nincorrectly decided by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.\nIn this -\nQUESTION: Is this just a question of Article III\nstanding or would it be open to us under our precedents to\nsay that we think there's Article III standing, but this\nreally involves rights of third parties, and as a\nprudential matter, we do not think it's appropriate to\nexercise jurisdiction -\nMR. CASSIDY: I think, Justice -\nQUESTION: Because, as I understand certainly the\nGovernment's brief, and I think yours, you don't argue\nprudential standing, it's just a question, an Article III\nquestion. Would you -\nMR. CASSIDY: Well, I would say both, Your Honor,\nthat the respondent is not a stakeholder within the\nmeaning of Article III. However, we would likewise submit\nthat I think that prudential argument was vis-a-vis the\nRooker-Feldman doctrine. We have requested that this\nCourt not interfere with the state court ongoing custody\ndispute on that basis, because essentially this is one of\na collateral attack of a state court proceeding.\nQUESTION: Well, I -- I saw the Rooker-Feldman\ncite. I just wonder if you have any other authority for\nthe fact that there's a prudential standing problem here\nand then you cite us a case other than Rooker v. Feldman,\nwould be Craig and Boren or Rescue Army or something?\nMR. CASSIDY: I don't know that it -- this case\nfits precisely in either the Rooker-Feldman or other\nprudential cases, but we do have a case that certainly\nmerits that type of consideration. We believe this Court\nshould defer and not interfere with what amounts to the\nmother's rights and interests in the upbringing,\neducational upbringing of the daughter. Second -\nQUESTION: Well, then that gets us to Article\nIII, the father says that it's not a level playing field,\nthat he has a right under state law and he might even have\na constitutional right to have some access to the -- to\nthe child and to try to affect the child's development,\nand that the state is tilting the balance,\nunconstitutionally he could say.\nMR. CASSIDY: Well, we would certainly disagree\nwith that position, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Well, but I mean, that's -- it's just\na question of standing. Does -- does -- he has no\nstanding to make that claim?\nMR. CASSIDY: Well, I think it's -- the best way\nto approach this is whether respondent has a legally\nprotected interest, which he does not. He does not have a\nlegally protected right. Therefore, he is not a\nstakeholder within the meaning of Article III, and -- and\nI would suggest -\nQUESTION: Well, he's -- he's -- may I ask you on\nthe question of legally protected right to zero in on\nthis. Put Rooker-Feldman aside for a moment, put next\nfriend standing aside for a moment. As I understand it,\nand you correct me if I'm wrong, as I understand it, he's\nsaying, look, simply as the father of this child, I have\nan interest which is in fact being infringed here. Even\nthough under state law the mother of the child has the\nright to cast the final decision on matters of morals,\neducation, religion, I nonetheless have an interest as a\nfather, and that interest is in seeing that my child is\nnot subjected to what I believe is an unconstitutional\nreligious interest or religious influence.\nWhat is your answer to his claim that that is\nenough to give him personal standing?\nMR. CASSIDY: I have to answer that question,\nJustice Souter, based upon how the school district\nperceives respondent's rights, and in this case, the\nschool district must look to only a single decision-maker.\nIt's the only way a school district can function. It's\nthe same way this Court should approach, we would suggest,\nthe standing issue.\nQUESTION: Well, the mother isn't a decision\nmaker for the school district, neither is the father a\ndecision-maker. If there's going to be a decision-maker,\nit's ultimately going to be a judicial decision-maker on\nthe constitutional question. He is simply saying, I have\na right to raise that question by virtue of my interest as\na father, even though at the present time under state law\nI cannot control her presence or absence at the school.\nMR. CASSIDY: We would submit, Justice Souter,\nthat the question is truly what is in the best interest of\nthe child. That's ultimately the determination made when\nwe look to parents' rights in custody disputes under state\nlaw.\nQUESTION: But aren't -- aren't you basically\nanswering the question as if I were asking you a next\nfriend standing question? Who should stand for the child\nin court as next friend is between these two parents. I'm\nasking the question simply about his interest, not as next\nfriend but as father, admittedly with limited rights.\nMR. CASSIDY: With limited rights, his rights\nbecome on a more abstract level. They are certainly not\nof the degree that provide a legally protectable interest\nin asserting those rights. His right to redress -\nQUESTION: California says otherwise. It says\nhe has the right to have an equal shot at trying to\ninfluence and raise this child and that this is his right.\nMR. CASSIDY: The reason, Justice Kennedy, that\nwe look to the state law to define those rights is that\nbecause when there are custody disputes, the court directs\nwhich parent gets the ultimate decision-making\nresponsibility and authority. In this case -\nQUESTION: Yes, but the judge didn't tell him to\n-- to discontinue the litigation, did he? The judge has\ntolerated the prosecution of the case?\nMR. CASSIDY: We would submit, Justice Stevens,\nthat the state judge cannot determine an Article III\nstanding. The judge -\nQUESTION: Well, he could certainly tell the\nfather, this is not in the best interest of the child,\ndiscontinue the litigation. He would have authority to do\nthat, at least to say, you can't bring this suit\npurporting to represent the best interests of the child.\nMR. CASSIDY: But when the respondent bypasses\nthe state court, the respond -- the record reflects that\nrespondent and the mother met with the principal and the\nkindergarten teacher of the daughter and respondent wanted\nto -\nQUESTION: But that doesn't go to the question of\nwhether he can maintain the litigation.\nMR. CASSIDY: But -\nQUESTION: That's a standing issue as to whether\nhe can bring this lawsuit.\nMR. CASSIDY: But certainly if he bypasses the\nstate court and never has a determination made as to\nwhether this is in the best interest of the daughter,\nyou're correct. You would not have that decision.\nQUESTION: But she never asked for a relief along\nthat line. She -- as I understand it, the mother never\nasked to tell him to discontinue the lawsuit.\nMR. CASSIDY: Well, she certainly sought\ndismissal in a -- in a manner of speaking from the Ninth\nCircuit Court of Appeals, and/or to intervene to -- to\ndemonstrate to the -\nQUESTION: And I think -\nMR. CASSIDY: -- Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals\nas to what was in the best interest of her daughter.\nQUESTION: Yeah, but the judge said the daughter\ncould go hear him argue the case as I understand it.\nMR. CASSIDY: But likewise in this Court the\njudge said she could not. So we have a situation where we\nhave to defer in a custody dispute like this to the state\ncourt's judgment as to what's ultimately in the best\ninterest of the child. When -- when we go back and look\nat the rights as defined, the ultimate decision-making\nauthority is with the mother in this case, and the reason\nthat the courts adopt that is consistent with the\nCalifornia education code for school districts, because\nunder the California education code, the school districts\nhave to have only one decision-maker. Otherwise, they\ncouldn't function properly when there are disagreements\nwith parents that are involved in custody disputes.\nIn referencing that code section, California\neducation code section 51100 sub D, in relation to the\nrights of parents to participate in the education of their\nchildren, the California education code specifically\nprovides, this section does not authorize a school to\npermit participation by a parent in the education of a\nchild if it conflicts with a valid order for custody\nissued by a court of competent jurisdiction.\nWith that, I would like to reserve the remainder\nof my time, Mr. Chief Justice.\nQUESTION: Very well, Mr. Cassidy.\nGeneral Olson, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF GEN. THEODORE B. OLSON\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES AS AMICUS CURIAE\nSUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS\nMR. OLSON: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please\nthe Court:\nRespondent has no right to bring this case in\nhis daughter's name and no independent, legally protected\nright to challenge in Federal court the conditions of his\ndaughter's education. A California domestic relations\ncourt with specialized expertise and continuing\njurisdiction has determined that the best interests of the\nchild require that decisions with respect to the\nconditions of the child's education are matters that\nshould be made -- those decisions should be made by the\nchild's mother.\nQUESTION: Well, he says, I have my own rights.\nHe says -- I'll -- I'll characterize his argument. He's\nsaying, you may be right about that, I have my own rights.\nI have a right as a father to -- to try to influence this\nchild -\nMR. OLSON: Well, it's -\nQUESTION: -- in -- consistent with her going to\nschool and with her mother and that's -- and the state set\nup an unfair playing field.\nMR. OLSON: Well, we submit, Justice Kennedy,\nthat a fair reading of what -- what the domestic relations\ncourt, which considered the best interests of the child,\nfocused in on the legally protected rights of the -- with\nrespect to this child's education. He's claiming a right,\na legally protected right to challenge the conditions in\nthe public school with respect to how the child shall be\neducated.\nThis record is relatively clear, not only with\nrespect to affidavits from the child's mother, but also\nwith respect to the decisions, the transcript of the\nSeptember 11, 2003, decision of this domestic relations\ncourt, and the order that the court issued on January 9 of\nthis year with respect to what was damaging to the\ninterests of the child. In fact, when the respondent\nbrought this case when he had joint custody without\nconsulting with the mother, the trial court found here\nthat it was unconscionable to bring this case, especially\nwhen he knew that it might adversely affect the interests\nof the child.\nWe submit that, under this Court's rulings with\nrespect to, even in connection with the right of the\nfather under Stanley v. Illinois, that may be trumped when\nthere is a powerful interest of the child, a powerful\ncountervailing interest under Stanley v. Illinois and -\nQUESTION: One -- one more question on standing.\nAm I correct that you don't argue this is a prudential\nstanding case and you don't -\nMR. OLSON: We -- we do also, Justice Kennedy.\nQUESTION: What's your best authority?\nMR. OLSON: Well, I -- first of all, there's two.\nIt's Rooker-Feldman in the sense that what -- recognizing\nstanding here will have the effect of disturbing and\nupsetting the effect of the trial court, of the domestic\nrelations court's decision with respect to the best\ninterests of the child.\nSecondly, with respect to the Ankenbrandt case\nwhere the Court has decided that the Federal courts don't\nhave jurisdiction with respect to domestic, the so-called\ndomestic relations exception, and that was specifically\nreferred to include divorce, alimony, and custody. So\nthere are those -- those factors all come together with -\nwith respect to describing the legally protected interest\nof the -- of the defendant -- of the respondent in this\ncase with respect to the matters involving the child.\nQUESTION: Is this your argument, Mr. Olson? In\n-- in determining whether we should recognize his next\nfriend standing, we should take into consideration the\nstate custody arrangements and the state judgments about\nwhat is in the best interests of the child. When we go to\nthe second question, should we recognize his individual\nstanding, if we do recognize his individual standing, but\nwe don't recognize his standing as next friend, we will\nundercut the interests which are being protected by\nrefusing to recognize his standing as next friend. We've\ngot to go, in effect, we've got to come to the same\nconclusion in each case or we will undercut our conclusion\non -- on next friend standing if it's adverse.\nMR. OLSON: That's -- that's absolutely correct,\nJustice Souter, and I think that's consistent with the so\ncalled domestic relations exception, the -- and the -- and\nthe court in that case recognized the special expertise of\nfamily courts with continuing jurisdiction with respect to\nsensitive matters. With respect to that, this Court would\ncollide with those concerns.\nIf I might turn to -\nQUESTION: But the -- the merits here certainly\nhave nothing to do with domestic relations.\nMR. OLSON: The -- well, and they do in the sense\nthat they -- the -- the matters that are before this Court\nwith respect to the Pledge of Allegiance in the public\nschool has to do with the child's education and impacts\nwith respect -- and there is in the record, Mr. Chief\nJustice, affidavits from the mother expressing her concern\nabout the effect on the child of being thrust into the\nvortex of this constitutional case.\nOne decision-maker has to make decisions with\nrespect to the best interests of the child and the\ncollision of those interests, and that comes into play\nbecause the child is the one that -- it's interesting that\nthe respondent's brief are full of references to the\ninterests of the child, the alleged coercive effect of the\nPledge of Allegiance, the impact on the child's rights and\nso forth, though -- therefore, although the respondent\ntalks about this separate independent right of his\ninterest when his -- when it comes to his brief, the\nissues that he's articulating throughout the brief don't\nsupport that standing. They support the standing of the\nnext friend on behalf of the child.\nIf I might turn to the merits, this Court has\nrepeatedly noted that the Pledge of Allegiance is a\nceremonial, patriotic exercise that acknowledges, and as\nthis Court has repeatedly held -\nQUESTION: Do you mean repeatedly held or\nrepeatedly said?\nMR. OLSON: Repeatedly said and in the -- in the\n-- in the sense of Seminole Tribe, Justice Stevens, this\nis more than dicta. It is -- it is explanations by the\nCourt for the holdings in those -- in those cases by the\nCourt. Indeed, I found, and this -- it's a -- this is a\ncalculation that's capable of being made by reference to\nthe cases cited in the brief, 14 separate Justices\narticulating that there was a significant difference\nbetween a purely religious exercise, such as in the prayer\ncases, and the ceremonial reference in solemn public\noccasions of -- with respect to the Pledge of Allegiance.\nFourteen Justices of this Court since the Pledge\nof Allegiance was amended have indicated that the Pledge\nof Allegiance is not a religious exercise, it is something\ndifferent of a ceremonial nature.\nQUESTION: Without benefit of brief and oral\nargument.\nMR. OLSON: Well, they -- there were references\nto the case in -- of -- of course in the briefs and -- and\nin connection with the case, but the fact is that the\nCourt was distinguishing, and the Court repeatedly said\nthat, that there is a major distinction between those\npurely religious exercises such as prayers or recitation\nof the Ten Commandments, or in the evolution cases. The\nrespondent cites nine cases that he says support the\nproposition that he's articulating. He left out a number\nof other cases where the Court has considered the issue of\nreligion in public schools, but those very cases,\nincluding the -- the Lee v. Weisman case involved a Pledge\nof Allegiance at the same time that the prayer was being\nuttered. Those -- all of those cases refer to the\ndifference in significant constitutional respects.\nQUESTION: Do you think the state or the school\ndistrict has the obligation to excuse from the classroom a\nchild whose parents disagree with the pledge?\nMR. OLSON: Yes, and it does. There's no\nquestion about that.\nQUESTION: There -- there is that -- that -- that\nconstitutional right?\nMR. OLSON: Yes, and that has been addressed, of\ncourse, in -- throughout the brief.\nQUESTION: Why -- why is that if this is not a\nprayer or not an exercise?\nMR. OLSON: Well, the -- the Court held in West\nVirginia v. Barnette that persons of conscience being\nconcerned about expressing allegiance to -- and that case\noccurred at a time before the pledge was amended.\nQUESTION: Well, that was not a prayer either.\nThat was saluting the flag.\nMR. OLSON: That was the Pledge of Allegiance to\nthe flag, but -- but that's the same thing that's\nhappening here, Mr. Chief Justice, that the child are\nexcused from reciting the -- the Pledge of Allegiance to\nthe flag. What I'm referring to in these other cases, as\nI indicated, 14 individual Justices have expressed a\ndifference between prayers, purely religious -\nQUESTION: They've expressed the view it's just a\nceremonial matter. Do you think that the pledge has the\nsame meaning today as when it was enacted with -- when the\nwords, under God, were inserted into the prayer, into the\npledge?\nMR. OLSON: Well, I think that the, as this, the\nlanguage of the Justices of this Court have expressed that\n-\nQUESTION: Well, forget the -\nMR. OLSON: -- because of -\nQUESTION: -- forget the, forget all that dicta\nfor just a moment. Do you think in -- is it the\nGovernment's position that the words, under God, have the\nsame meaning today as when they were first inserted in the\npledge?\nMR. OLSON: Yes and no, and I would like to\nanswer, explain if I may.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: Because it's a terribly important\nquestion.\nMR. OLSON: It's an important question because\nthe reference to under God in the pledge, as numerous\ndecisions of this Court have indicated in dicta, what as a\npart of a -- of a thought process of coming about to the\nconclusion that it -- it is an acknowledgment of the\nreligious basis of the framers of the Constitution, who\nbelieved not only that the right to revolt, but that the\nright to vest power in the people to create a government\nbecame -- came as a result of religious principles. In\nthat sense, the Pledge of Allegiance is today, that has\nthat same significance to this country as it did in 1954\nwhen it was amended.\nBut as this Court has also said, and that's the\nother part of my answer to your question, this Court has\nalso said the ceremonial rendition of the Pledge of\nAllegiance in context repeatedly over the years has caused\n-- would cause a reasonable observer familiar -- as this\nCourt's First Amendment Establishment Clause jurisdiction\npoints out -- would cause a reasonable observer to\nunderstand that that is -- this is not a religious\ninvocation. It is not like a prayer, it is not a\nsupplication, it's not an invocation. It is -\nQUESTION: Your -- your argument is that there's\na stronger case now than there would have been 50 years\nago?\nMR. OLSON: Yes, Justice Ginsburg, and that is\nfor many reasons, for -- because of the reason that I just\nmade, but also because the Congress revisited this issue\nin 2002 after the decision below in this case. There are\nfindings in the record which are a part of the brief, with\nrespect to what the -- what the pledge means, the context\nof the pledge in its historical context, in the connection\nwith its civic invocation, its ability to invoke certain\nprinciples that are indisputably true, which gave rise to\nthe institutions which have given us freedom over all this\nperiod of time.\nIt's in -- it is significant that the Court in,\nthe Congress, in making those findings, specifically\nreferred to the decisions that I was referring to before,\nwhich have been characterized as dicta, but very important\ndicta, because they explain how the Court came to its\nconclusions.\nSo those are differences. The other difference\nthat should be made is that the challenge here too is not\ndirectly to the Pledge of Allegiance, but it's to the\ninvocation or the -- the articulation of the Pledge of\nAllegiance in the Elk Grove School District. The State of\nCalifornia requires those patriotic exercises in that\nschool district under the phrase, patriotic\nresponsibilities of the schools, or words to that effect,\nand that -- and the school district itself puts this in\nthe category of a patriotic exercise.\nAnd to go back to what this Court has taught us\nwith respect to the Establishment Clause and the\nendorsement prong of the Establishment Clause, it's the\nentire context. It's the nation's history, it's a Pledge\nof Allegiance to the flag and to the nation for which it\nstands, and then a descriptive phrase, under God,\nindivisible, with liberty and justice for all. So -\nQUESTION: Well, why not have it like oath or\naffirmation? That is, give people a choice, don't say\nit's got to be all one way or all the other, but say\nchildren who want to say under God can say it and children\nwho don't, don't have to say it.\nMR. OLSON: Well, they don't. They don't have to\nsay it. They don't -\nQUESTION: But they can be -- take part in the\npledge.\nMR. OLSON: They can take part in the pledge -\nQUESTION: In their own way.\nMR. OLSON: -- without saying any words. They\ncan decide not to participate in the pledge at all, and I\nthink that's covered by the West Virginia v. Barnette\ndecision of this Court. The -- the -- and I want to make\nthis point before my time elapses, is that the respondent\nmakes a point of saying, this is the same as requiring the\npledge to say one nation under Jesus. That is completely\ndifferent. It's not supported by the history where the\nframers of our Constitution repeatedly referred to God,\nLord, the creator, and there's a very interesting piece of\nhistory with respect to that.\nWhen the Virginia bill of establishing religious\nfreedom was articulated, they -- they used the phrase, the\nholy author. Thomas Jefferson in his autobiography, which\nwas published in 1811, said there was a motion to amend to\nrefer to the holy author, Jesus Christ, and he said in his\nautobiography that that was rejected because the framers\nof the Virginia Bill of Rights, or act establishing\nreligious freedom, which is a precursor to the\nEstablishment Clause, was intended not to include any\nparticular sect, but to -- to apply to Jews, Hindus,\nMohammedens, and it even says the word infidels in Thomas\nJefferson's explanation for the background of that act.\nIn -- in summary, the state -- the Pledge of\nAllegiance is not what this Court has said the\nEstablishment Clause protects against, that is to say,\nstate-sponsored prayers, religious rituals or ceremonies,\nor the imposition or the requirement of teaching or not\nteaching a religious doctrine.\nThe Establishment Clause does not prohibit civic and\nceremonial acknowledgments of the indisputable historical\nfact of the religious heritage that caused the framers of\nour Constitution and the signers of the Declaration of\nIndependence to say that they had the right to revolt and\nstart a new country, because although the king was\ninfallible, they believe that God gave them the right to\ndeclare their independence when the king has not been\nliving up to the unalienable principles given to them by\nGod.\nQUESTION: Thank you, General Olson.\nMr. Newdow, we'll hear from you. Am I\npronouncing your name correctly?\nMR. NEWDOW: Yes, you are.\nQUESTION: Please proceed.\nARGUME NT OF MICHAEL A. NEWDOW\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. NEWDOW: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please\nthe Court:\nEvery school morning in the Elk Grove Unified\nSchool District's public schools, government agents,\nteachers, funded with tax dollars, have their students\nstand up, including my daughter, face the flag of the\nUnited States of America, place their hands over their\nhearts, and affirm that ours is a nation under some\nparticular religious entity, the appreciation of which is\nnot accepted by numerous people, such as myself. We\ncannot in good conscience accept the idea that there\nexists a deity.\nI am an atheist. I don't believe in God. And\nevery school morning my child is asked to stand up, face\nthat flag, put her hand over her heart, and say that her\nfather is wrong.\nQUESTION: Well now, let's -- let's talk first\nabout standing. You only give it two pages in your brief.\nIt -- it seems to me important to recognize that these\naren't just technical rules that we lawyers are interested\nin, but that there's a common sense component to it. And\nyou are asking the Court to exercise the extraordinary,\nthe breathtaking power to declare Federal law\nunconstitutional, and the common sense of the matter, it\nseems to me, is that your daughter is -- is the one that\nbears the blame for this. She's going to face the public\noutcry, the public outrage, and we take the case, I think,\non the assumption that even at her tender years she\nprobably doesn't agree with that and that her mother\ncertainly doesn't.\nAnd it seems to me that your insisting on\nstanding here contradicts that common sense core of the\nstanding rule, which is -- and I'm just talking about her\nstanding, I'm not talking about yours -- that the common\nsense core of the standing rule is, when a citizen wants\nthe courts to exercise this awful power, that they take\nthe consequences, and you're putting that on her. That's\nthe common sense of the matter to me, Mr. Newdow.\nMR. NEWDOW: I would answer that in two ways.\nFirst of all, Palmore v. Sidoti says that we shouldn't\nlook at the harms that occur to people as a result of\nprejudices of our society. If, in fact, the Constitution\nis being violated, if in -- and there are consequences\nfrom people trying to uphold the Constitution, that just\nhappens to happen. I'm not convinced that there are going\n-- going to be adverse consequences to my daughter. My\ndaughter's going to be able to walk around and say that my\nfather helped uphold the Constitution of the United\nStates.\nQUESTION: Maybe so, maybe no, but the rule of\nstanding is that the person who brings the suit has to\naffirm that they have that stake now when the suit is\nbrought, and she doesn't.\nMR. NEWDOW: Correct, but I'm not bringing this\nin her behalf, that was taken out. I'm bringing this in\nmy behalf, and my child -\nQUESTION: That's -- that's a different point\naltogether, but if she has no standing, then it seems to\nme the next question is whether or not the rights that you\nassert, and I understand what they are, do seem to\nundercut her position.\nMR. NEWDOW: They may well do that, but she's a\nseparate entity. I have a right of standing, and the\nquestion that this Court has is merely, do I have that\nright. And my daughter is told every morning -\nQUESTION: Yet -- but see, then -- then you're\ngetting back to your daughter. It seems to me this case\nhas to be about your rights, and you began this argument\nby talking about your daughter and you're talking about\nher now. I think she has, at least we'll say, I have\nserious concerns about her standing, and so it seems to me\nthat her position is irrelevant.\nMR. NEWDOW: And I agree with that, Your Honor.\nI am saying I as her father have a right to know that when\nshe goes into the public schools she's not going to be\ntold every morning to be asked to stand up, put her hand\nover her heart, and say your father is wrong, which is\nwhat she's told every morning. That is an actual,\nconcrete, discrete, particularized, individualized harm to\nme, which gives me standing, and not only gives me\nstanding, demonstrates to this Court how the -\nQUESTION: Well, she does have a right not to\nparticipate.\nMR. NEWDOW: She has a -- yes, except under Lee\nv. Weisman she's clearly coerced to participate. If there\nwas coercion in Lee v. Weisman -\nQUESTION: That was a prayer.\nMR. NEWDOW: Well, I'm not sure this isn't a\nprayer, and I'm -- I am sure that the Establishment Clause\ndoes not require prayer. President Bush, and this is in\nthe Americans United brief, stated himself that when we\nask our citizens to pledge allegiance to one nation under\nGod, they are asked to participate in an important\nAmerican tradition of humbly seeking the wisdom and\nblessing -\nQUESTION: Yeah, but I suppose reasonable people\ncould look at the pledge as not constituting a prayer.\nMR. NEWDOW: Well, President Bush said it does\nconstitute a prayer.\nQUESTION: Well, but he -- we certainly don't\ntake him as the final authority on this.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: What -- what you say is, I pledge\nallegiance to the flag of the United States of America and\nto the republic for which it stands. So that certainly\ndoesn't sound like anything like a prayer.\nMR. NEWDOW: Not at all.\nQUESTION: Then why isn't General Olson's\ncategorization of the remainder as descriptive, one nation\nunder God, with liberty and justice for all? You can\ndisagree it's under God, you can disagree that it's -- has\na liberty and justice for all, but that doesn't make it a\nprayer.\nMR. NEWDOW: First of all, I don't think that we\nwant our -- that the purpose of the Pledge of Allegiance\nis to disagree that it's liberty and justice for all. I\nthink the whole purpose of the pledge is to say that, and\nthis Court has stated it's an affirmation of belief, an\nattitude of mind when we pledge, and I think you have to\ntake all the words. It says under God. That's as purely\nreligious as you can get and I think it would be an\namazing child to suddenly come up with this knowledge of\nthe history of our society and -- and what our nation was\nfounded on.\nQUESTION: What -- what -- Mr. Newdow -- what if,\ninstead of the Pledge of Allegiance, the school required\nthe children to begin their -- their session by singing\nGod Bless America? Would that make your case weaker or\nstronger?\nMR. NEWDOW: I don't think so. If it was -\nwell, if it -\nQUESTION: Well, you don't think weaker or you\ndon't think stronger?\nMR. NEWDOW: I -- I think that if -- if they\nstood up the child and they said, stand up, face the flag,\nput your hand on your heart and you say God bless America,\nI think that would clearly violate the line as well, just\nas in God we trust.\nQUESTION: Well, what I -- my -- my hypothesis is\nthat they ask the children to stand and to sing the -- the\npatriotic song, God Bless America.\nMR. NEWDOW: I think the Court would have to go\nthrough its -- its normal procedures and say, was this\ndone for religious purpose? Does it have religious\neffects? Is it attempting to endorse religion? We would\nlook at the text -\nQUESTION: Sounds pretty much, much more like a\nprayer than under God, God bless America.\nMR. NEWDOW: I -- I don't -- I don't think so. I\nmean, we're saying that this -\nQUESTION: You're -\nMR. NEWDOW: -- nation is under God. I mean,\nCongress told us itself when it passed the law.\nQUESTION: And if children who say God bless\nMommy and God bless Daddy, they think they're saying a\nprayer.\nMR. NEWDOW: They think they're saying God bless,\nyes, and when they say, if Daddy and Mommy were under God,\nthey'd be also assuming that there was a God there if they\nsaid that, and especially if they're stood up in the\npublic schools. If they did that -\nQUESTION: It's two words sandwiched in the\nmiddle of something and the child doesn't have to say\nthose words.\nMR. NEWDOW: But the Government is not allowed to\ntake a position on that. Government is saying there's a\nGod. Certainly the child doesn't have to affirm that\nbelief if there weren't the coercion that we see in -\nQUESTION: The child doesn't have to if it\ndoesn't want to. That's not an issue in this case.\nMR. NEWDOW: The issue is whether or not\ngovernment can put that idea in her mind and interfere\nwith my right. I have a absolute right to raise my child\nas whatever I see. Government is weighing in on this\nissue.\nQUESTION: No, you don't, you don't. You -\nthere is another custodian of this child who makes the\nfinal decision who doesn't agree with you.\nMR. NEWDOW: Well, first of all, I'm not\nconvinced about her making the final decision. I think it\nwas shown when I tried to get my child to attend the Ninth\nCircuit that she certainly does not have the final\ndecision-making power. She has a temporary final\ndecision-making power, which is good for about three days\nuntil we get to court.\nBut more importantly is the issue that\ngovernment is weighing in here. The mother has no right\nto tell Elk Grove Unified School District how to run their\nmorning exercises. There is nothing in the custody order\nthat is affected by what I am asking. If, in fact, this\nCourt grants the relief that I suggest and that we take\nout the words, under God, or at least tell the Elk Grove\nUnified School District they can no longer do that, then\nnothing in the custody order will be affected in any way.\nThe mother can still advocate to have God and she can do\nall the things she wants.\nQUESTION: Of course, we have -- we have so many\nreferences to God in our daily lives in this country. We\nopened this session of the Court today -\nMR. NEWDOW: Correct, and there are -\nQUESTION: -- with a reference, and I suppose you\nwould find that invalid as well.\nMR. NEWDOW: Not -- not under what the -- this\nCourt has to distinguish in this case. No one -- when\nthis Court opens, God save this honorable Court, nobody's\nasked to stand up, place their hand on their heart and\naffirm this belief. This Court stated in West Virginia v.\nBarnette that this is an affirmation, a personal\naffirmation. Senator -\nQUESTION: And you have no problem with, in God\nwe trust, on the coins and that sort of thing?\nMR. NEWDOW: If my child was asked to stand up\nand say, in God we trust, every morning in the public\nschools led by her teachers -\nQUESTION: It's all right for her to have the\ncoins and use them and read them, but it's -- it's the -\nthe problem of being asked to say the pledge?\nMR. NEWDOW: I'm saying in this -\nQUESTION: Which she doesn't have to say.\nMR. NEWDOW: Well, first of all, under Lee v.\nWeisman, she is coerced in -\nQUESTION: Now, wait a minute. We have other\nauthorities saying that no child is required to say the\npledge.\nMR. NEWDOW: And no child was required to be at\nthe graduation at Lee v. Weisman, but we said this is a\ncoercive effect on -\nQUESTION: That was a prayer.\nMR. NEWDOW: And -- then we're back to the idea\nof why did Congress -- Congress told us why they stuck\nthis in their -- their -- into the pledge.\nQUESTION: Well, let's -- we have to be careful\nabout the facts here. Your -- your daughter is not\nrequired, and of course, I have a serious problem about\nyour daughter's standing, but your daughter is not\nrequired to put her hand over her heart and face the flag.\nThat's a misstatement. She is not required to do that.\nMR. NEWDOW: She's not required but she is\ncoerced. She is standing there. She's a 6-, 7-year-old\nkid at the time, and she -\nQUESTION: Justice O'Connor points out that's the\ndifference in Lee and Weisman and West Virginia Board of\nEducation v. Barnette. One is a prayer, the other isn't.\nMR. NEWDOW: Well, it's -- again, the\nEstablishment Clause does not require a prayer. To put\nthe Ten Commandments on the wall was not a prayer yet this\nCourt said that violated the Establishment Clause. To\nteach evolution or not teach evolution doesn't involve\nprayer, but that can violate the Establishment Clause. The\nissue is is it religious, and to say this is not religious\nseems to me to be somewhat bizarre.\nAnd as a matter of fact, we can look at the\nstanding argument and we can look at Elk Grove Unified\nSchool District's brief, in which eight times they mention\nthat this is the mother involved with religious\nupbringing, they keep talking about religious upbringing,\n18 times they spoke about religious education, religious\ntraining, religious interest. All of this has to do with\nreligion, and to suggest that this is merely historical or\npatriotic seems to me to be somewhat disingenuous.\nQUESTION: I mean, it's pretty, it's a pretty\nbroad use of religion sometimes. I -- does it make you\nfeel any better, and I think the answer's going to be no,\nbut there is a case called Seeger, which referred to the\nConstitution -- to the statute that used the word, supreme\nbeing, and it said that those words, supreme being,\nincluded a set of beliefs, sincere beliefs, which in any\nordinary person's life fills the same place as a belief in\nGod fills in the life of an orthodox religionist. So it's\nreaching out to be inclusive, maybe to include you, I\nmean, to -- because many people who are not religious\nnonetheless have a set of beliefs which occupy the same\nplace that religious beliefs occupy in the mind and woman\nof a religious -- of a religious mind in men and women.\nSo do you think God is so generic in this\ncontext that it could be that inclusive?\nMR. NEWDOW: I think -\nQUESTION: And if it is, then does your objection\ndisappear?\nMR. NEWDOW: I don't think so, because if I'm not\nmistaken with regard to Seeger, Seeger -- the Government\nwas saying what Seeger thought about religion and what's\noccupied in Seeger's mind. Here it is the Government and\nthere's a crucial difference between government speech\nendorsing religion, which the Establishment Clause\nforbids, and -- and private speech endorsing religion,\nwhich the Free Speech and Free Exercise Clauses protect.\nAnd in that case we're talking about protecting that\nindividual's right for him to say in his view that this\noccupies the same thing as God.\nHere we're talking about government, everybody\non the way here is government. It's Congress that stuck\nthe two words, under God, into the pledge, clearly for a\nreligious purpose. It's the State of California that\nsays, go ahead, use the Pledge of Allegiance, which is now\nreligious. It is the city of Elk Grove that says, now\nwe're going to demand -\nQUESTION: But what I'm thinking there is that\nperhaps when you get that broad in your idea of what is\nreligious, so it can encompass a set of religious-type\nbeliefs in the minds of people who are not traditionally\nreligious, when you are that broad and in a civic context,\nit really doesn't violate the Establishment Clause because\nit's meant to include virtually everybody, and the few\nwhom it doesn't include don't have to take the pledge.\nMR. NEWDOW: You're referring to the two words,\nunder God?\nQUESTION: Yeah, under God is this kind of very\ncomprehensive supreme being, Seeger-type thing.\nMR. NEWDOW: I don't think that I can include\nunder God to mean no God, which is exactly what I think.\nI deny the existence of God, and for someone to tell me\nthat under God should mean some broad thing that even\nencompasses my religious beliefs sounds a little, you\nknow, it seems like the Government is imposing what it\nwants me to think of in terms of religion, which it may\nnot do. Government needs to stay out of this business\naltogether. And this Court has always referred to -\nQUESTION: How about what the ending of every\nexecutive order, in the year of our Lord, so and so? Now\nthat, it seems to me, on your scale would be more\nproblematic because it's a specific Lord and not a generic\nGod.\nMR. NEWDOW: Well, I would note that this Court\nin its bar certificates when it passes those out has in\nthe year of the Lord, and actually it gives an exemption\nfor people who find that offensive. And it would seem to\nme that we ought to be -\nQUESTION: As -- as -- but it doesn't take away\nin the year of our Lord, which is what you would like to\ndo. There's an option here too. The child does not have\nto say it at all, can say it except for the words, under\nGod, or can say the whole thing.\nMR. NEWDOW: I think that's a huge imposition to\nput on a small child. Imagine you're the one atheist with\n30 Christians there and you say to this child, let's all\nstand up, face the flag, say we are one nation under God\nand we're going to impose on a small child the -- this\nimmense amount of power, prestige, and financial support\nQUESTION: Now, I just -- I just want to point\nout that once again you're arguing based on the child, and\nI -- I think there's a serious standing problem.\nMR. NEWDOW: I think the argument I'm trying to\nmake, and I may not be making it well, is that government\nis doing this to my child. They are telling her, they're\nputting here in a milieu where she says, hey, the\nGovernment is saying that there is a God and my dad says\nno, and that's an injury to me that it is --\nQUESTION: When -- when you put it the way you\njust did, that we are -- the school district is making her\nan atheist, you're -- you're certainly overstating the\ncase, I think.\nMR. NEWDOW: I'm not -\nQUESTION: There's no indication that she is an\natheist.\nMR. NEWDOW: I'm not saying either. I'm -- I'm\nsaying that she -- that my right to inculcate my religious\nbeliefs includes the right to know that government will\nnot in the public schools influence her one way in -- or\nthe other. And government is coming in here every morning\nto start off the morning, say put your hand on your heart,\npledge to that flag and incorporate in that Pledge of\nAllegiance that there exists this purely religious dogma\nthat your father has told you doesn't exist, and\ngovernment may not do that.\nQUESTION: What -- what do you make of -- of this\nargument? I will assume, and I -- I do assume, that -\nthat if you read the pledge carefully, the -- the\nreference to under God means something more than a mere\ndescription of how somebody else once thought. We're\npledging allegiance to the flag and to the republic. The\nrepublic is then described as being under God, and I think\na fair reading of that would -- would be I think that's\nthe way the republic ought to be conceived, as under God.\nSo I think -- I think there's some affirmation there. I\nwill grant you that.\nWhat do you make of the argument that in actual\npractice the -- the -- the affirmation in the midst of\nthis civic exercise as a religious affirmation is -- is so\ntepid, so diluted then so far, let's say, from a\ncompulsory prayer that in fact it -- it should be, in\neffect, beneath the constitutional radar. It's -- it's\nsometimes, you know the phrase, the Rostow phrase, the\nceremonial deism.\nWhat -- what do you make of -- of that argument,\neven -- even assuming that, as I do, that there is some\naffirmation involved when the child says this as a\ntechnical matter?\nMR. NEWDOW: I think that that whole concept goes\ncompletely against the ideals underlying the Establishment\nClause. We saw in Minersville v. Gobitis and West\nVirginia v. Barnette something that most people don't\nconsider to be religious at all to be of essential\nreligious value to those Jehovah's Witnesses who objected.\nAnd for the Government to come in and say, we've decided\nfor you this is inconsequential or unimportant is -- is an\narrogant pretension, said James Madison. He said in his\nmemorial -\nQUESTION: Well, I think the argument is not that\nthe Government is -- is saying, we are defining this as\ninconsequential for you. I think the argument is that\nsimply the way we live and think and work in schools and\nin civic society in which the pledge is made, that the -\nthat whatever is distinctively religious as an affirmation\nis simply lost. It -- it's not that the -- that the\nGovernment is saying, you've got to pretend that it's\nlost. The argument is that it is lost, that the\nreligious, as distinct from a civic content, is close to\ndisappearing here.\nMR. NEWDOW: And again, I -- I don't mean to go\nback, but it seems to me that is a view that you may\nchoose to take and the majority of Americans may choose to\ntake, but it doesn't -- it's not the view I take, and when\nI see the flag and I think of pledging allegiance, I -\nit's like I'm getting slapped in the face every time, bam,\nyou -- you know, this is a nation under God, your\nreligious belief system is wrong.\nAnd here, I want to be able to tell my child\nthat I have a very valid religious belief system. Go to\nchurch with your mother, go see Buddhists, do anything you\nwant, I love that -- the idea that she's being exposed to\nother things, but I want my religious belief system to be\ngiven the same weight as everybody else's. And the\nGovernment comes in here and says, no, Newdow, your\nreligious belief system is wrong and the mother's is right\nand anyone else who believes in God is right, and this\nCourt -\nQUESTION: If you had her in this courtroom and\nshe stood up when the Justices entered and she heard the\nwords, God save the United States and this honorable\nCourt, wouldn't the injury that you're complaining about\nbe exactly the same, so you would have equal standing on\nyour account of things to challenge that as you do to\nchallenge what the school district does here?\nMR. NEWDOW: I don't think the injury would be\neven close to the same. She's not being asked to stand\nup, place her hand on her heart, and say, I affirm this\nbelief, and I think that can easily distinguish this case\nfrom all those other situations. Here she is being asked\nto stand and say that there exists a God. Government\ncan't ever impose that -\nQUESTION: If she's -- if she's asked to repeat\nor to sing, as the Chief Justice suggested, God Bless\nAmerica, then she is speaking those words.\nMR. NEWDOW: Again, if it were a situation where\nwe said, let's only do nothing else in this classroom, all\nright, we'll say God bless America and let's just say\nthose words or something, I think that would violate the\nConstitution as well. If it's just, let's sing one song a\nday and once a month we get God Bless America, no, that\nwould be certainly fine. We don't want to be hostile to\nreligion.\nBut here we're not -- it's not a question of\nbeing hostile to religion. It's -- it's indoctrinating\nchildren and Congress said that was the purpose. This\nCourt is supposed to give credence and --\nQUESTION: Do we think of that, God Bless\nAmerica, as religion? It's not exactly like a hymn that\nyou'd sing in church?\nMR. NEWDOW: No, and again, if it were used for\nthe purpose to say that there exists a God, then I think\nit would violate the Constitution. If it's merely a song\nand this is one of many songs, then it would be fine. But\nhere there's nothing else in the Pledge of Allegiance,\nthere's no other view here. There's one view being\nenunciated, that is that there exists a God, and\ngovernment may not take a view. This Court has all -\nevery Justice here -\nQUESTION: Well, we're -- I don't know. I mean,\nthat's the point where -- I have no doubt that it offends\nyou and I respect the fact that you're -- your right to be\noffended. I understand that. But the question is whether\nCongress, whether -- whether the -- whether the Government\nhas the power to work that kind of offense. And on that,\nbecause you say, well, it doesn't have the right. Well,\nwhy doesn't it have the right? It isn't that divisive if,\nin fact, you have a very broad understanding of God. It's\nnot a prayer, it's in a ceremonial context, and it has a\nlong history of being evoked for civic purposes. Of\ncourse, some people will be offended, but those people who\nare offended can in fact ask the child, where they have\ncustody, to be excused or not to say the words, under God.\nSo it's not perfect, it's not perfect, but it serves\na purpose of unification at the price of offending a small\nnumber of people like you. So tell me from ground one why\n-- why the country cannot do that?\nMR. NEWDOW: Well, first of all, for 62 years\nthis pledge did serve the purpose of unification and it\ndid do it perfectly. It didn't include some religious\ndogma that separated out some -- and I don't think there's\nanything in the Constitution that says what percentage of\npeople get separated out. Additionally, again, we can use\nthat example that I raised before with one nation under\nJesus. That would also separate out just a few people\nrelatively in our country. There's not that many more.\nIt's about 86 percent to 93 percent, somewhere in that\nvicinity, so we're separating out another amount of\npeople, but again, the principle is the same. We are\nseparating out people. We don't need to.\nAgain, the Pledge of Allegiance did absolutely\nfine and with -- got us through two world wars, got us\nthrough the Depression, got us through everything without\nGod, and Congress stuck God in there for that particular\nreason, and the idea that it's not divisive I think is\nsomewhat, you know, shown to be questionable at least by\nwhat happened in the result of the Ninth Circuit's\nopinion. The country went berserk because people were so\nupset that God was going to be taken out of the Pledge of\nAllegiance.\nQUESTION: Do we know -- do we know what the vote\nwas in Congress apropos of divisiveness to adopt the under\nGod phrase?\nMR. NEWDOW: In 1954?\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. NEWDOW: It was apparently unanimous. There\nwas no objection. There's no count of the vote.\nQUESTION: Well, that doesn't sound divisive.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. NEWDOW: It doesn't sound divisive if -\nthat's only because no atheist can get elected to public\noffice. The studies show that 48 percent of the\npopulation cannot get elected.\n(Applause.)\nQUESTION: The courtroom will be cleared if\nthere's any more clapping. Proceed, Mr. Newdow.\nMR. NEWDOW: The -- there are right now in eight\nstates in their constitutions provisions that say things\nlike South Carolina's constitution, no person who denies\nthe existence of a supreme being shall hold any office\nunder this constitution. Among those eight states there's\n1328, I believe the number of legislators, not one of\nwhich has tried to get that -- those phrases out of their\nstate constitutions, because they know, should they do\nthat, they'll never get re-elected, because nobody likes\nsomebody to stand up for atheists, and that's one of the\nkey problems, and we perpetuate that every day when we\nsay, okay class, including Newdow's daughter, stand up,\nput your hand on your heart and pledge, affirm that we are\na nation under God.\nQUESTION: You have a clear free exercise right\nto get at those laws, wouldn't you, that you recited that\nsaid atheists can't run for office, atheists can't do this\nor that? That -- that would be plainly unconstitutional,\nwould it not?\nMR. NEWDOW: That would be, yes. Those clauses\nare clearly nullities at this time in view of Torcaso v.\nWatkins.\nQUESTION: And is -\nMR. NEWDOW: However, they still exist. And the\nfact that those clauses, I mean, we saw what happened to\nthe -- to -- when the Confederate flag was over the\nstatehouse in South Carolina, they had a big, you know,\neveryone got, you know, very upset and said, let's get\nthat out. That was a flag that can mean anything to\nanyone. Could we imagine a clause in the South Carolina\nconstitution that said no African-American shall hold any\noffice under this constitution, no Jew shall hold any\noffice under this constitution? That would be there for\ntwo seconds maybe. But no atheists? Hey, let it stick\naround, it's been there, in eight states right now today\nin 2004.\nQUESTION: Well, if anyone challenged that -\nQUESTION: May I ask you the same question I\nasked just General Olson? Do you think that the words,\nunder God, in the pledge, and I think of things like, in\nGod we trust, on the dollar bill, which nobody really\ncares very much about anymore, but do you think the words,\nunder God, in the Pledge of Allegiance have the same\nmeaning today that they did to the country when the words\nwere inserted in the -- in the pledge?\nMR. NEWDOW: I would merely note that 99 out of\n99 Senators stopped what they were doing and went out on\nthe front steps of the Capitol to say that they want under\nGod there. The President of the United States in a press\nconference with Vladimir Putin decided the first thing\nhe's going to talk about was this decision. It was on the\nfront page of every newspaper. This is supposed to be one\nof the major cases of this Court's terms. I think clearly\nit has enormous significance to the American public and\nthat's why this is important. That's why this case is so\ncritical.\nQUESTION: And that's why you would not take the\nsame position with regard to the words, in God we trust,\non the dollar bill?\nMR. NEWDOW: I -- I think this Court can easily\ndistinguish that situation from here, where we're asking\nchildren to stand up, being coerced in the setting, hold\nyour hand over your heart and pledge your own personal\naffirmation to some religious entity. Government is not\neven supposed to be anywhere near this question.\nGovernment's supposed to stay out of the religion\nbusiness, and here it came into it, it was completely\nunnecessary, and Congress said in 1954, in House Report\n1693, the inclusion of God in the pledge, therefore -- and\nthey didn't use the phrase, under God, they said the\nentity God -- the inclusion of God in the pledge,\ntherefore, would further acknowledge the dependence of our\npeople and our Government upon the moral directions of the\ncreator and we'll note it wasn't a creator, it was the\ncreator, the Christian creator and we know that because\nwhen they put the flag up the flagpole, they played Onward\nChristian Soldiers Marching as to War.\nI mean, this is -- clearly we know what was\ngoing on here. It was to get religion in our government,\nand the outcry that came when the Ninth Circuit issued its\nopinion shows that people still want their religious\nbeliefs in our government. And the Free Exercise Clause\nis fine, they can do anything they want in the public\nschools, they can go into class, they can do whatever they\nwant, but the Free Exercise Clause has never meant that a\nmajority may use the machinery of the state to practice\nits beliefs, and that's precisely what we have in this\nsituation.\nAgain, I would point out that this Court, every\nmember of this Court has demanded neutrality. Seven\nmembers of this Court, six sitting today, have said that\nwe need -- that have authored their own opinions that say\nthat we need neutrality, and here we have the\nquintessential religious question, does there exist a God?\nAnd government has come in, yes, there exists a God. That\nis not neutrality by any means.\nQUESTION: What -- what -- is there any merit to\nthe argument that there's a difference in a religious\nexercise and a pledge -- in the pledge -- or has that been\nyour whole point here that there is no difference?\nMR. NEWDOW: I think there is a difference when\nthe pledge doesn't have religious dogma as part of the\nreligious -\nQUESTION: But when it doesn't.\nMR. NEWDOW: -- when it doesn't have a religious\ncreed or religious doctrine inserted.\nQUESTION: No, no, I mean this pledge.\nMR. NEWDOW: This -- this pledge -\nQUESTION: You say this is the same as the prayer\nin Lee v. Weisman?\nMR. NEWDOW: No, not at all. I'm saying it's a\nreligious exercise, and clearly the whole idea, the intent\nof Congress was -\nQUESTION: You're saying both as a religious -\nare religious exercises?\nMR. NEWDOW: Well, I think religious exercise is\na larger set, prayer is a subset. I would say again the\nPresident of the United States considers the pledge in\nthat subset. Whether or not you do or I do is -- is\nsomewhat, I think irrelevant, because the question --\nQUESTION: Well, now, it -- it -- let's suppose,\nI thought the case turned on whether this was a religious\nexercise.\nMR. NEWDOW: Correct.\nQUESTION: Which -- which clearly there was in\nLee v. Weisman.\nMR. NEWDOW: Correct.\nQUESTION: Why -- why is this a religious\nexercise, or -- or is it?\nMR. NEWDOW: I think it definitely is, and it is\nbecause the two words are, under God, and I can't see of\nanything that's not religious under God, and again, I\nwould point out in the standing argument made by the Elk\nGrove Unified School District, they repeatedly reference\nthe fact it's the whole issue here with the mother is\nbecause she directs the, quote, religious upbringing.\nThere wasn't anything about -\nQUESTION: Well, let -- let's assume that in Lee\nv. Weisman it was 100 percent prayer, let's just assume\nthat.\nMR. NEWDOW: Okay.\nQUESTION: Is there -- this is maybe only -\nyou've probably figured out, 5 percent prayer under your\n- your view -\nMR. NEWDOW: Well, I don't think -\nQUESTION: -- under your view.\nMR. NEWDOW: That -- that's one of the issues\nthat -- that gets confusing. The question is, when you\nlook at what it -- the religious part, and then the\nquestion is, what are you going to define that as being\nencompassed in? In Lee v. Weisman, it was the prayer\nwithin the context of the graduation and I think it was\nlike an hour and a half for the graduation and two minutes\nfor the prayer.\nSo here we have, I think, if you actually\nmultiply and look at the ratio, the ratio of the two\nwords, under God, to the Pledge of Allegiance is greater\nthan the ratio of the time spent on prayer versus the\ngraduation exercise in Lee v. Weisman. You can do that\nwith anything. We have Allegheny County showing, you\nknow, we -- if you talk about the staircase and just\nbeing, you know, this individual thing, we could say,\nwell, the staircase is this -- this transportation mode\njust like here the pledge is this patriotic mode.\nBut the question is, why did you stick the\ncreche in the middle of this grand staircase? The\nquestion is here, why did you stick these two purely\nreligious words, under God, in the middle of the Pledge of\nAllegiance? So I would say that it's clear here there is\na purely religious purpose, we have purely religious\neffects, it fails the endorsement test, it fails the\noutsider test. Imagine you're this one child with a class\nfull of theists and you -- you're -- you have this idea\nthat you want to perhaps at least consider and you have\neveryone imposing their view on you, it fails every test\nthis Court has ever come up with, and there's a principle\nhere and I'm hoping the Court will uphold this principle\nso that we can finally go back and have every American\nwant to stand up, face the flag, place their hand over\ntheir heart and pledge to one nation, indivisible, not\ndivided by religion, with liberty and justice for all.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Newdow.\nMr. Cassidy, you have five minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF TERENCE J. CASSIDY\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. CASSIDY: I would like to take this\nopportunity to respond to several points. First, under\nLynch we know that acknowledgment of the role of religion\nin American society is not exercising religion, nor is it\nendorsing religion.\nSecond, respondent has stated his daughter is\nbeing required to stand up and say the pledge. His\ndaughter is not required to stand up and say the pledge.\nIt is the parents' choice, the parent chooses whether the\nchild recites the pledge. In this case, the mother has\nexercised her legal right under the state custody order\nand we have discussed that previously, but therefore, Mr.\n-- respondent's recourse is to object to the mother's\ndecision, to seek his recourse in state court for the\nmother's decision, because there is a lack of a causal\nrelationship with respect to his not having a legally\nprotectable right to assert what he seems to be asserting\nin this case, that it is his daughter who is affected by\nthe pledge.\nThird, following Barnette, schools across the\ncountry, including the Elk Grove Unified School District,\nhave developed a number of procedures to accommodate\nstudents who wish to opt out of the pledge exercise. They\ndo so by consulting with the teachers and the principals,\nwho are in the best position to know how to adopt that to\nthe various class members. In particular, there may be\nseveral ways that a child could opt out and exercise the\nrights that were developed post-Barnette.\nEqually important to the opt-out procedure or\nthe voluntary requirement is the fact that teachers now\ninstruct the students about mutual respect, respect of\nother belief systems, of all persons' belief systems.\nThird, I would like to go back to the issue that\nwas presented in this case, which was whether the school\ndistrict policy violates the Establishment Clause.\nRespondent conceded at the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals\nthat the school district policy had a secular purpose.\nThere's nothing in the record to show that the school\ndistrict policy was adopted solely for religious purpose,\nnor is there anything in the record that shows there was\nany religious purpose in adopting, in adopting, the school\ndistrict policy.\nMoreover, the Pledge of Allegiance in grammar\nschools, in public schools, is part of a teaching program,\nand that's what we're here about, to talk about the\neducational upbringing of a child, and it has to do with\nnational unity and citizenship of our young students.\nQUESTION: May I ask you just one question? I\nhate to take your rebuttal time, but one of the amicus\nbriefs filed in this case has this sentence in it. I'd\nlike you to comment on. If the religious portion of the\npledge is not intended as a serious affirmation of faith,\nthen every day government asks millions of school children\nto take the name of the Lord in vain. Would you comment\non that argument?\nMR. CASSIDY: I would disagree, because we feel\nthat the use of the term, one nation under God, reflects a\npolitical philosophy, and the political philosophy of our\ncountry, as set forth in the Declaration of Independence,\nis one is -- that ours is one of a limited government, and\nthat is the philosophy that's now more enhanced, more\nreflected in the 1954 act.\nBut back to our school district policy, which is\nwhat is being challenged in this case, I would point the\nCourt to the joint appendix at page 149, which sets forth\nnot only that the pledge is recited in grammar school, but\nalso that the pledge is then -- also can be recited in\nsecondary schools, and likewise, that policy provides that\nschool children are to look at all the different\ncomponents of our history, speeches, historical documents,\nwhether they be state constitutions, the Declaration of\nIndependence, the Bill of Rights, and likewise, that's\nincorporated into the history and social sciences content\nstandards for California, specifically at grade one level.\nNot only are the students learning the Pledge of\nAllegiance and singing songs such as My Country 'Tis of\nThee, but likewise they're learning about the Declaration\nof Independence, so they are learning about our country's\nnationalism and civic unity at a very early stage. They\ndon't say the Pledge of Allegiance and go home.\nLikewise, I would submit that the Pledge of -\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr. Cassidy.\n"
