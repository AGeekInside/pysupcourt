LAYTON\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. LAYTON: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThough bound by Stanford v. Kentucky, the\nMissouri Supreme Court rejected both its holding and its\nrationale. This Court should stay the course it set in\nStanford, leaving in the hands of legislators a\ndetermination as to the precise minimum age for capital\npunishment within the realm of Thompson v. Oklahoma, and\nleaving to jurors responsibility for determining the\nculpability of individual defendants above that minimum\nage.\nThe Missouri court justified its departure from\nStanford on Atkins v. Virginia, but the result it reached\nis quite different from the result in Stanford. In that\n-- excuse me -- in Atkins. In that case, the Court was\naddressing mental ability, itself a component of\nculpability. The Court announced a principle based on\nthat characteristic, that is, that the mentally retarded\nare not to be eligible for capital punishment, but then it\nleft to the States the determination of the standard and\nthe means of implementing that principle.\nThe Missouri Supreme Court, by contrast, jumped\nbeyond the question of maturity, which is an element of\nculpability analysis, to the arbitrary distinction of age.\nIt drew a line based purely on age, which is necessarily\nover-inclusive, and then it gave that line constitutional\nstatus, thus depriving legislators and juries of the\nability to evaluate the maturity of 17-year-old defenders.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, we didn't leave it up to\nthe States entirely. I mean, you -- you mean the States\ncould adopt any definition of mental retardation they\nwant?\nMR. LAYTON: No. The States certainly -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So there's -- there's some\nminimal level of mental retardation. Right?\nMR. LAYTON: There is some minimal level.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And isn't that necessarily\nover-inclusive, just as picking any single age is\nnecessarily over-inclusive?\nMR. LAYTON: No.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Surely there will be some\npeople who -- who, although they have that level of mental\nretardation, with regard to the particular crime in\nquestion, are deserving of the death penalty.\nMR. LAYTON: I -- I don't agree that it would be\nover-inclusive, given the Court's analysis in Atkins. The\nCourt said that someone who has that level of mental\nretardation is simply not sufficiently culpable by\ndefinition. That certainly would not be true here. There\nare 17-year-olds who are equally culpable with those who\nare 18, 20, 25, or some other age.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But the age 18 is set even\nfor such things as buying tobacco. The -- the dividing\nline between people who are members of the community, the\nadult community, is pervasively 18, to vote, to sit on\njuries, to serve in the military. Why should it be that\nsomeone is death-eligible under the age of 18 but not\neligible to be an adult member of the community?\nMR. LAYTON: I think that legislators would be\nsurprised, when they adopted those statutes, that they\nwere affecting their criminal law. In fact, many of those\nstatutes have individualized determinations, the military\nbeing one of them. 17-year-olds can enlist. There is an\nindividualized determination, albeit by parents, not the\nGovernment. 17-year-olds may be serving in Iraq today.\nThat -- the other kinds of examples that you cite, for\nexample, tobacco -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But with parental -- they are\nwards of their parents.\nMR. LAYTON: Yes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So their parents -- the same\nthing with marriage. A 17-year-old can marry but not\nwithout parental consent.\nMR. LAYTON: Although in most instances can\nmarry if they go to a court and demonstrate they are\nsufficiently mature, again contemplating individualized\ndetermination, which the Missouri Supreme Court says does\nnot exist as to 17-year-olds with regard to capital\npunishment.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why pick -- why pick on the\ndeath penalty? I mean, if you're going to say that\nsomehow people under 18 are juveniles for all purposes,\nwhy -- why just pick on the death penalty? Why -- why not\nsay they're immune from any criminal penalty?\nMR. LAYTON: Well, I -- I must assume that if we\n-- if the Court says they are immune from the -- from\ncapital punishment that someone will come and say they\nalso must be immune from, for example, life without\nparole.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I'm sure that -- I'm sure that\nwould follow. I -- I don't see where there's a logical\nline.\nMR. LAYTON: No. The -- the problem with\nadopting the -- the 18-year-old line is that it is\nessentially arbitrary. It's the kind of line that\nlegislators and not courts adopt.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: But didn't -- didn't\nwe adopt a 16-year-old line in our earlier case?\nMR. LAYTON: In -- in Thompson, the Court in a\n4-1-4 decision struck a 15-year-old -- a 15-year-old\nexecution, and the States have taken, including Missouri\nthrough its General Assembly, have taken that to mean that\nthere is a 16-year-old line. And today, in fact, I think\nit's true that there is a consensus nationally with regard\nto the 16-year-old line, not because it has some\nbiological or psychological magic, but because perhaps --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, but -- but there was -\nit's about the same consensus that existed in the\nretardation case.\nMR. LAYTON: Absolutely, that's true. If you\nlook at the -- the --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: And -- and so are we somehow\nrequired to at least look at that? I mean, the statistics\nof how many States have approved 18 years as the line is\nabout the same as those in the retardation case.\nMR. LAYTON: The -- the Court has kind of three\ngroups of cases with regard to the number of States. On\none extreme, are Enmund and Coker where you have three and\neight States. On the other extreme, are Penry and\nStanford where you have 24 and 34 States. And then\nthere's this middle group, which isn't just Atkins and\nthis case. It's also Tison, which is also almost exactly\nthe same number.\nThe Court in Atkins had to find a way of\ndistinguishing Tison, to the extent the Court relied on\nthat -- that counting process, and the -- the Court\nconcluded that there was kind of an inexorable trend with\nregard to the mentally retarded. We don't have that kind\nof trend here. In -\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, we -- we have a different\nkind of trend. What do you make -- you spoke of a\nconsensus, but what do you make of the fact that over the\nlast, I guess, 10- or 12-year period, the actual\nimposition of the death penalty for -- for those whose\ncrimes were -- were under 18 has -- has steadily been\ndropping. I think 10 years ago, there were 13. Last\nyear, I -- I think the figures were that there were two.\nThe -- the consensus seems to be eroding, and yet as -- as\nthe counsel on the other side pointed out, this has been\noccurring at a time when -- when treating juvenile crime\nseriously has not, in fact, been eroding at all. What -\nwhat are we supposed to make of that?\nMR. LAYTON: Well, two things.\nNumber one is that capital sentences have been\ndropping for all ages, not just for those under 18. So it\n-- you have to take that into account.\nThe second is that although the last -\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Has -- has the -- has the rate\nof attrition been the same?\nMR. LAYTON: It is --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: 13 to 2 is pretty spectacular.\nMR. LAYTON: It is not --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I don't think we've seen that,\nor maybe we have seen that, for -- for death imposition\ngenerally. Is that so?\nMR. LAYTON: It is certainly greater, but part\nof the problem is we're dealing with such small numbers\nfor the -- the juveniles, those under 18, that the\ndifference of one or two makes a huge difference in how\nthe numbers come out.\nBut if you look over the last 10 years, in fact,\nit has gone up and down and currently is in a down trend,\nbut the down trend -\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, it went up once I think,\ndidn't it?\nMR. LAYTON: It -- it went up once within -\nsince -- since Stanford and then came back down. Now,\nwhether this -- this period in which it comes back down is\ngoing to remain that way or whether we'll go back up to\nwhere we were 10 years ago I don't know. That's entirely\nhypothetical to suggest that -- that this very recent\ntrend is more dispositive than the trends over the last 10\nyears.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So -- so you're basically -\nJUSTICE SOUTER: You're -- you're basically\nsaying that the -- the time is too short, the numbers are\ntoo small -\nMR. LAYTON: Right.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- to infer anything.\nMR. LAYTON: Right, and the time is too short on\nthe legislative side as well. We're only talking about\nthe States that have adopted new legislation having done\nso, one of them in 1999 and the others simply in 2002 and\n2004. If we were to look at the history of -- of capital\npunishment in the United States, there are many times when\nStates have abolished capital punishment and then\nreturned. And Justice -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: You -- you were in the midst\nof telling us why the -- there is a consensus now that\nit's inappropriate to execute anyone under 16, and I -- I\n-- you weren't -\nMR. LAYTON: No. It -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: You couldn't finish that\nanswer. I want to know it.\nMR. LAYTON: Since -- since Stanford, we have\nhad no executions under 16 even though it is possible to\nread Justice O'Connor's opinion in that case as allowing a\nState to adopt a statute that specifically says 15. No\none has tried that. Everyone seems to have taken Thompson\nand Stanford together to mean there is a 16-year-old line.\nTwo States have adopted 16 by statute.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And -- and so you say there's\n-- there's not so much as a consensus as an understanding\nof what that decision means.\nMR. LAYTON: I -- I think that that's right.\nThere are States that have adopted it specifically and\nothers have simply implemented it. If I were a prosecutor\ntoday, I -- it's hard to imagine that I would -- even in a\nState where I could find a statute saying I could\nprosecute someone under age 16, that I would try such a\nthing.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Let -- let me ask you this. I\n-- I don't yet have the -- the record showing the full\nclosing argument of -- of both sides, but we do have the\nportion where the prosecutor says, isn't this scary? Can\nadolescence ever be anything but mitigating?\nMR. LAYTON: I -- I don't know how it could be\nanything but mitigating. But what we have in that -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But that's not how the\nprosecution presented it to the jury.\nMR. LAYTON: In that statement, but -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: He said -- he -- he almost\nmade it aggravating. Isn't that scary? I don't have the\n-- I don't have the full argument.\nMR. LAYTON: No. What -- what he's facing is -\nis 18 pages of transcript that occupied the -- the defense\ncounsel's argument. Of those 18 pages, 4 pages are\ndedicated purely to Mr. Simmons' youth, and throughout the\nrest of the argument, he uses terms to reinforce that. He\nrefers to him repeatedly as a 17-year-old. He calls him a\nkid. He does things to reinforce with the jury that he's\nvery young.\nSo then we come back and in a few pages of\nrebuttal, we have a couple of words -- I shouldn't say\nthat -- two sentences in which the prosecutor is trying to\nrespond to that particular lengthy theme and argument.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: It was pretty clear. The -\nthe words in question were: Think about age. 17 years\nold. Isn't that scary? Doesn't that scare you?\nMitigating? Quite the contrary I submit. Quite the\ncontrary.\nMR. LAYTON: And if we were here because Mr.\nSimmons said that was improper and the Missouri Supreme\nCourt said that was improper, well, we wouldn't be here.\nWe wouldn't have asked for certiorari. The Court wouldn't\nhave granted it.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But the question is, can -\nis -- is age, youth inevitably mitigating, and here is a\nprosecutor giving the answer no, it can be aggravating.\nMR. LAYTON: The Missouri statute requires that\nan instruction be given that says that age is a mitigator,\nand the -- the instruction was given here. And the jury\nheard argument concerning that particular claim.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, what's -- what's the -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, that's somewhat --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What is the contrary of -- of\nmitigating? I -- I would assume -\nMR. LAYTON: Aggravating, but aggravating -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Is it? I -- I would assume\nit's not mitigating.\nMR. LAYTON: Well, you're right, Your Honor,\nbecause -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Maybe the opposite of\nmitigating is aggravating, but it -- it's perfectly good\nEnglish to say, mitigating? Quite the contrary -\nMR. LAYTON: It is --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's not at all mitigating.\nMR. LAYTON: Yes. And -- and --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So I don't know why you give\nthat one away.\nMR. LAYTON: Certainly aggravating circumstances\nare defined in the Missouri statute, and they were defined\nin the instructions. So this was not to be considered by\nthe jury as an aggravator.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Let -- let's focus on the word\nunusual. Forget cruel for the moment, although they're\nboth obviously involved.\nWe've seen very substantial demonstration that\nworld opinion is -- is against this, at least as\ninterpreted by the leaders of the European Union. Does\nthat have a bearing on what's unusual? Suppose it were\nshown that the United States were one of the very, very few\ncountries that executed juveniles, and that's true. Does\nthat have a bearing on whether or not it's unusual?\nMR. LAYTON: No more than if we were one of the\nvery few countries that didn't do this. It would bear on\nthe question of unusual. The decision as to the Eighth\nAmendment should not be based on what happens in the rest\nof the world. It needs to be based on the mores of -- of\nAmerican society.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Have the countries of the\nEuropean Union abolished the death penalty by popular\nvote?\nMR. LAYTON: I don't know how they've done that,\nYour Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I thought they did it by reason\nof a judgment of a court -\nMR. LAYTON: Well, in fact -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- which required all of them\nto abolish it.\nMR. LAYTON: I -- I believe that -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And I thought that some of the\npublic opinion polls in -- in a number of the countries\nsupport the death penalty.\nMR. LAYTON: I believe that there are countries\nin Europe who abolish it because of their membership in\nthe European Union -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I -- I acknowledged that in -\nin my question. I recognize it is the leadership in many\nof these countries that objects to it.\nBut let us -- let us assume that it's an\naccepted practice in most countries of the world not to\nexecute a juvenile for moral reasons. That has no bearing\non whether or not what we're doing is unusual?\nMR. LAYTON: I -- I can't concede that it does\nbecause it's unimaginable to me that we would be willing\nto accept the alternative, the flip side of that argument.\nIt does seem to me, however, that that goes to a\nparticular -- back to the aspect where I began -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Is there -- is there any on -\non that? Is there any indication? I mean, I've never\nseen any either way, to tell you the truth, but -- that\nMadison or Jefferson or whoever, when they were writing\nthe Constitution, would have thought what happened\nelsewhere, let's say, in Britain or in the British -- they\nwere a British colony. They did think Blackstone was\nrelevant. Did any -- that they would have thought it was\ntotally irrelevant what happened elsewhere in the world to\nthe word unusual. Is there any indication in any debate\nor any of the ratification conventions?\nMR. LAYTON: Nothing that I have seen has\nsuggested that -\nJUSTICE BREYER: So if Lincoln --\nMR. LAYTON: -- one way or the other.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- Abraham Lincoln used to\nstudy Blackstone and I think he thought that the Founding\nFathers studied Blackstone, and all that happened in\nEngland was relevant, is there some special reason why\nwhat happens abroad would not be relevant here? Relevant.\nMR. LAYTON: There's a -\nJUSTICE BREYER: I'm not saying controlling.\nMR. LAYTON: There's a special reason why\nBlackstone would be relevant because that was the law from\nwhich they were operating when they put this language into\nthe Constitution.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Absolutely, and they, I guess,\nwere looking at English practices, and would they have\nthought it was wrong to look abroad as a relevant feature?\nMR. LAYTON: And -- and I don't know the answer\nto that, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Do we -- do we ever take the\nposition that what we do here should influence what people\nthink elsewhere?\nMR. LAYTON: I -- I have not seen that overtly\nin any of the Court's opinions, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You -- you think --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: You -- you thought that Mr.\nJefferson thought that what we did here had no bearing on\nthe rest of the world?\nMR. LAYTON: Oh, I -- I think Mr. Jefferson\nthought that. I think many of the Founders thought that\nthey were leading the world, and I have no objection to us\nleading the world, but Mr. Jefferson's lead of the world\nwas through the legislature not through the courts.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But did he not also say that\nto -- to lead the world, we would have to show a decent\nrespect for the opinions of mankind?\nMR. LAYTON: That -- that may well be.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What did John Adams think of\nthe French?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. LAYTON: I read a biography of John Adams\nrecently. I recall that he didn't think highly of them.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. LAYTON: The -- Missouri, in order to\nimplement the principle that those who are immature should\nnot be subject to capital punishment, has adopted an\napproach that, first off, excludes anyone age 16 and under\nfrom capital punishment; second, requires certification by\nthe juvenile court for anyone who is 16, but otherwise\nturns the matter over to the jury and defines it as a\nstatutory mitigator.\nThe kind of evidence that is discussed in Mr.\nSimmons' brief at some length could have been applied -\ncould have been presented during the penalty phase of Mr.\nSimmons' trial. It has been reflected in decisions of\nthis Court as far back as Eddings where there was evidence\nof mental and emotional development. In Penry, there was\nevidence of mental age and social maturity. And here, in\nthe post-conviction proceeding, Mr. Simmons presented such\nevidence regarding his impulsivity, his susceptibility to\npeer pressure, and his immaturity. But he didn't present\nthat at trial. There is a mechanism in Missouri for him\nto do that and he chose not to.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Before you go off on this, the\none statistic that interested me -- and I'd like you to\ndiscuss its relevance really -- is if we look back 10\nyears, I have only three States executing a juvenile:\nTexas, 11; Virginia, 3; and Oklahoma, 2.\nMR. LAYTON: Correct.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And those three States account\nfor about 11 percent of the population of the country,\n11.3 percent.\nNow, if we go back a few more years to Stanford,\nwe get three others in there: Louisiana, 1; Georgia, 1;\nand Missouri, 1.\nMR. LAYTON: And if you go to the convictions\nrather than the executions, then Alabama goes into that\nmix.\nJUSTICE BREYER: We have a very different\nnumber.\nMR. LAYTON: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So the reason that I thought\narguably it's more relevant to look at the convictions is\nthere are a lot of States. Say, New Hampshire, I think,\nfor example -- when I was in the First Circuit, there were\nseveral States that on the books permitted the death\npenalty, but nobody ever had ever been executed. And -\nand that's true across the country. There are a number of\nStates like that. So if we look at the States that\nactually execute people, it's 10 years, say, 11 percent of\nthe population are in such States. You go back 15 years,\nand you get these three other States, which raises the\npercentage.\nHow -- how should I understand that? I'm\ninterested in both sides -\nMR. LAYTON: Frankly, we don't know what those\nnumbers mean because we don't know to what extent\njuveniles are committing capital level murders. We -- and\nthere is no way in current social science to make that\ndetermination.\nIt's interesting that among the three States -\ntwo of the three States that are on that list that Justice\nBreyer mentioned are States in which there is a specific\ninstruction to the jury, or indeed, in Texas, a\nrequirement, that the jury evaluate future dangerousness.\nThat is, the argument that was referred to by opposing -\nor that counsel made, the State's counsel made, the\nprosecutor made, in the -- in the trial here, there's\nactually an instruction in some of those States. And that\nmay play into the manner in which this -- those States -\nthe reason those States have additional convictions and\nadditional executions.\nBut Missouri doesn't have that. We don't\nrequire that the jury find future dangerousness, and\nalthough that may come up in the course of a mitigation\nand aggravation argument in the penalty phase, it isn't\nhighlighted like it is in those States. And that may be\nmore problematic than the system that Missouri has\ncreated.\nIf the kind of evidence, psychosocial evidence,\nthat is cited in Mr. Simmons' brief had been presented at\nthe penalty phase, of course there would have been an\nopportunity to rebut it, to question it. Instead, what we\nhave in this case is the marshaling of untested evidence\nfrom various cause groups and some dispassionate\nobservers.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: At what point was this\ninserted into the record, Mr. Layton?\nMR. LAYTON: The -- the kind of -- well, as to\nMr. Simmons specifically, it came in in the post\nconviction proceeding, and then was also present in the\nhabeas record. In this case, the -- the lengthy litany of\nscientific studies appeared for the first time in his\nbrief in this Court. There were references to a few of\nthem before, but nothing --\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: It was never -- never\ntested in the trial court.\nMR. LAYTON: Oh, no. Oh, no, because he never\nmade the argument in the trial court during his trial that\n-- that scientifically he was too immature to be culpable\nto the degree that would merit capital punishment.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, at least to the extent\nthat he's simply quoting public sources, you had a chance\nto quote public sources in -- in return.\nMR. LAYTON: Absolutely.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So I think you're -- you're\neven on that -\nMR. LAYTON: Absolutely.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- or at least your opportunity\nis.\nMR. LAYTON: I -- and I think the reason that we\ndid that and we cited the difficulties in our reply brief\nwith what he cited is to highlight that the precise age is\na legislative question based on legislative type facts.\nLegislatures can evaluate this series of studies and then\npick what is essentially an arbitrary age. There is no\nstudy in anything that Mr. Simmons cites that -- that\njustifies that particular day, 18. They talk about\nadolescence. They talk about young adolescence, old\nadolescence. They talk about adolescence continuing until\nthe mid-20's. Nothing justifies the age of 18. That\nmakes it the kind of fact that a legislature ought to be\nevaluating, not a court.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Does adolescence as a\nscientific term -- does it always occur on the same day\nfor -- for all individuals?\nMR. LAYTON: No. The -- the studies point out\nthat adolescence is -- well, they don't agree on what\nadolescence means, and they don't -- and they point out\nthat it begins and ends on different times for different\npeople. So we don't know what adolescence means in the\nstudies, and we don't know what it would mean were the\nCourt to base a decision on the -- this concept of\nadolescence.\nI'd like to reserve the rest of my time, if\nthere are no other questions.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Very well, Mr. Layton.\nMr. Waxman, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. WAXMAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nEveryone agrees that there is some age below\nwhich juveniles can't be subjected to the death penalty.\nThe question here is where our society's evolving\nstandards of decency now draw that line.\n15 years ago, this Court found insufficient\nevidence to justify a bright line at 18, but since\nStanford, a consensus has evolved and new scientific\nevidence has emerged, and these developments change the\nconstitutional calculus for much the same reasons the\nCourt found compelling in Atkins. As was noted -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Can the constitutional calculus\never move in the other direction? I mean, once we hold\nthat, you know, 16 is the age, if there's new scientific\nevidence that shows that some people are quite mature at\n18 or at -- at 17-and-a-half or if -- if there is a -- a\nnew feeling among the people that youthful murderers are,\nindeed, a serious problem and -- and deterrence is\nnecessary, can we ever go back?\nMR. WAXMAN: Well, there is a -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's sort of a one-way ratchet.\nIsn't it?\nMR. WAXMAN: There is a one-way ratchet here as\nthere is whenever this Court draws a constitutional line;\nthat is, whenever this Court determines that the\nConstitution preempts the ability of legislatures to\nmake --\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Well, but what -- what\nif a State legislature decides that, sure, the Supreme\nCourt said in the Simmons case that you can't execute\nanybody under 18, but we think there's kind of a tendency\nthe other way, we're going to pass a statute and see what\nhappens in court?\nMR. WAXMAN: Well, you could -- you could have,\nI guess, what I refer to as the Dickerson v. United States\nphenomenon. It could come up. But what's -- what's\nreally interesting -- I think what's -\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Is it -- is that a\nclosed book? I mean, granted, you may lose the argument,\nbut is it a permissible argument that the standards have\nevolved the other way?\nMR. WAXMAN: It -- it certainly would be a\npermissible -- permissible argument.\nWhat's -- what's notable here, Justice Scalia\nand Mr. Chief Justice, is how robust this consensus is.\nWe're talking not only about the whole variety of ways in\nwhich our society has concluded that 18 is the bright line\nbetween childhood and adulthood and that 18 is the line\nbelow which we preserve -- presume immaturity. But the\nline with respect to executions, the trend is very robust\nand it is very deep.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: We don't -- we don't use 18 for\neverything. Aren't there States that -- that allow\nadolescents to drive at the age of 16?\nMR. WAXMAN: There are nine States that allow\nadolescents to drive at the age of 16 without their\nparents' consent. That -- driving, of course, is the\nclassic example, but -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: With their parents' consent -\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Right.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: With their parents' consent,\nhow many?\nMR. WAXMAN: To -- to -- there are 41 States\nthat require parental consent below 18.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But they can drive.\nMR. WAXMAN: But they can drive if their parents\nagree. My -- my -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: If it's okay with the parents,\nit's okay with the State.\nMR. WAXMAN: My point here is that with respect\nto the death penalty, we have a substantial consensus\nwithin the United States, as it happens, exactly the same\nlineup as existed in -- as existed in -- was true in\nAtkins. We have not just a worldwide consensus that\nrepresents the better view in Europe. There are 194\ncountries -\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Well, how does one -\nhow does one determine what is the better view?\nMR. WAXMAN: I was -- I was referring to the\nimplication that it has often been said that because the\nEuropean Union thinks something, we should, therefore,\npresume that the world views it that way. We're now\ntalking about --\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Are you suggesting\nthat we adopt that principle?\nMR. WAXMAN: To the contrary. My point is we\nare not talking about just what a particular European\ntreaty requires. We -- the -- the eight States that -\nthat theoretically -- that have statutes that\ntheoretically permit execution of offenders under 18 are\nnot only alone in this country, they are alone in the\nworld. Every country in the world, including China and\nNigeria and Saudi Arabia and the -- and the Democratic\nRepublic of the Congo, every one has agreed formally and\nlegislatively to renounce this punishment, and the only\ncountry besides the United States that has not is Somalia,\nwhich as this Court was reminded yesterday, has no\norganized government. It is incapable --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: They have a lot of customs that\nwe don't have. They don't allow most -- almost all of\nthem do not allow -- have trial by jury. Should we -- and\nthey think it's not only more efficient, it is fairer\nbecause juries are, you know, unpredictable and whatnot.\nShould we yield to the views of the rest of the world?\nMR. WAXMAN: Of course not, but this is a -\nthis is a standard which -- a constitutional test that\nlooks to evolving standards of moral decency that go to\nhuman dignity. And in that regard, it is -- it is notable\nthat we are literally alone in the world even though 110\ncountries in the world permit capital punishment for one\npurpose -- for one crime or another, and yet every one -\nevery one formally renounces it for juvenile offenders.\nAnd, Justice Kennedy, my submission isn't that\nthat that's set -- you know, game, set, and match. It's\njust relevant, and I think it is relevant in terms of the\nexistence of a consensus.\nThere was reference made by my opponent to the\nfact that there are four States that set the age at 17 and\nfour States that set the age at 16. No -- in terms of\nmovement, no one has suggested that any of those States or\nany other State has ever lowered the age. In fact, if you\nlook at those particular -- those eight States, a number\nof them legislated an age that represented raising the\nnumber over what had previously been permitted. The\nmovement, as this Court addressed, talked about in Atkins,\nhas all been in one direction, and it's not as if that\nmovement, in and of itself, answers the question. But\nwhere you have the type of consensus that exists here, as\nit did in Atkins, and where you have a scientific\ncommunity that in Stanford was absent -- the American\nMedical Association, the American Psychological\nAssociation, the American Psychiatric Association, the\nmajor medical and scientific associations, were not able\nin 1989, based on the evidence, to come to this Court and\nsay there is scientific, empirical validation for\nrequiring that the line be set at 18.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, in fact, the American\nPsychological Association is not your brief. You're not\naccountable for inconsistencies there.\nBut I -- I would like your comment. They came\nto us in Hodgson v. Minnesota, as I think the State quite\ncorrectly points out, and said that with reference to the\nage for determining whether the child could have an\nabortion without parental consent, that adults -- that\nthey -- that they were risk -- that they could assess\nrisk, that they had rational capacity, and they completely\nflip-flop in this case.\nMR. WAXMAN: Well --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Is that just because of -- is\nthat just because of this modern evidence?\nMR. WAXMAN: No, no, no. I don't -- I think\nit's -- it may be in small part to that, Justice Kennedy,\nbut I think the main point is that what their brief looked\nto -- what the argument was was our -- are adolescents\ncognitively different than adults. And the answer is, as\nwe -- our brief concedes, is generally no.\nAnd what was at issue in the abortion cases was\ncompetency to decide. And just as we allow the mentally\nretarded the ability to decide whether or not to obtain an\nabortion but not to be subject to a penalty that is\nreserved for the tiny fraction of murderers that are so\ndepraved that we call them the worst of the worst, here\ncompetency to decide here, as with the mentally retarded,\nisn't the issue.\nChristopher Simmons was found, beyond a\nreasonable doubt, to have committed this offense with the\nspecific intent necessary to do it, just as the mentally\nretarded can be. The issue in Hodgson was cognitive\nability to be able to make a competent decision. And so I\ndon't -- I didn't represent the APA then and I don't now,\nbut I don't, with respect, think there's an inconsistency.\nIn fact, the difference here goes to the factors\nthat Atkins identified about why overwhelmingly the\nmentally retarded -- and here adolescents -- are less\nmorally capable. They are much, much less likely to be\nsufficiently mature to be among the worst of the worst.\nAnd here, even more than with the mentally retarded, the\nfew 16- and 17-year-olds who might, if we could even\ndetermine it, be -- we could determine were in fact so\ndepraved that they were among the worst of the worst,\nthere is no way reliably to identify them and there's no way\nreliably to exclude them. And it is in this respect that\nscience I think changes.\nAt the time of Stanford, everybody on this\nCourt, of course, knew what all of us as adults\nintuitively know, which is that adolescents -- and -- and\nhere we're talking about -- I agree that when adolescence\nstarts and when it ends is undefined. But every\nscientific and medical journal and study acknowledges that\n16- and 17-year-olds are the heartland. No one excludes\nthem. And what we know from the science essentially\nexplains and validates the consensus that society has\nalready developed.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: If all of this is so clear, why\ncan't the State legislature take it into account?\nMR. WAXMAN: Well, one could have said -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, if it's such an\noverwhelming case that -- that we can prescribe it for the\nwhole country, you would expect that the number of States\nthat -- that now permit it would not permit it. All you\nhave to do is bring these facts to the attention of the\nlegislature, and they can investigate the accuracy of the\nstudies that the American Psychological Association does\nor other associations in a manner that we can't. We just\nhave to read whatever you put in front of us.\nMR. WAXMAN: Justice Scalia, the number of\nStates that engage in these executions is very small, and\nif it were all of the States, none of this Court's Eighth\nAmendment jurisprudence would ever have to come -- would\never have to be developed. But --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But that's precisely because\nthe jury considers youthfulness as one of the mitigating\nfactors. It doesn't surprise me that the death penalty\nfor 16- to 18-year-olds is rarely imposed. I would expect\nit would be. But it -- it's a question of whether you\nleave it to the jury to evaluate the person's youth and\ntake that into account or whether you adopt a hard rule\nthat nobody who is under 18 is -- is -- has committed such\na heinous crime with such intent that he -- that he\ndeserves the death penalty.\nMR. WAXMAN: Justice -- Justice Scalia, there's\nno doubt -- and the jury was instructed -- that age is a\nmitigating factor although, Justice Kennedy, in response\nto your question, our brief points out prosecutors, in the\ncontext of future dangerousness, which is relevant, argue\nit all the time and jurors intuitively think it all the\ntime.\nBut the fact that he could have made an\nindividualized mitigating case or argued that he was only\n-- that he was young, as he did, doesn't address the\nconstitutional problem. The constitutional problem is\nthat overwhelmingly 16- and 17-year-olds, for reasons of\nthe -- the developmental reasons relating to their\npsychosocial character --\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Well, Mr. Waxman, was\nthat in evidence that you referred to from these various\nassociations? Was that introduced at trial?\nMR. WAXMAN: The -- about the character --\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Yes.\nMR. WAXMAN: No. The trial was -- I'm making an\nobservation just as in -- as in Atkins -\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Well, but I -- I would\nthink if you want to rely on evidence like that, it ought\nto be introduced at trial and subject to cross examination\nrather than just put in amicus briefs.\nMR. WAXMAN: Oh, no, Mr. Chief Justice. I'm not\nmaking an argument about the character or maturity of this\ndefendant, which would have been the only thing that would\nbe -\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: No. But you're making\nan argument that science says people this age are simply\ndifferent, and it seems to me you -- if that's to be an\nargument, it ought to be introduced at trial.\nMR. WAXMAN: I -- I -- it's an argument about\nwhat the Constitution prohibits. It's an argument about\nwhere a constitutional line should be drawn.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Well, but you're -\nyou're talking facts basically and facts ordinarily are\nadduced at trial for cross examination.\nMR. WAXMAN: Well, I am not aware of any\ninstance in which legislative facts, as you will call\nthem, that is, facts that go to where a line should be\ndrawn, whether it's by this Court because the Constitution\nought to be so interpreted or a legislation should change,\nwould be properly introduced to a jury that is supposed to\naccept the law, that has required to accept the law as is\ngiven by a judge -\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Well, how about in the\n-- how about in the habeas proceeding?\nMR. WAXMAN: In the habeas proceeding, it's -\nit's -- an argument could have been made and, indeed, was\nmade in this case that the line -- that under Atkins\njuvenile offenders are the same and -\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Well, was this\nevidence adduced at the habeas proceeding?\nMR. WAXMAN: The habeas -- if you're talking\nabout the -- the scientific studies -\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Right.\nMR. WAXMAN: -- in peer-reviewed journals, it\nwas not.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well -- well, surely at the\ntrial, you could have had a psychiatrist testify to all\nthe things that are in your -- in your brief, and in fact\nthe -- it would be another argument, but maybe the -\nmaybe the finding was deficient on that ground as well.\nMR. WAXMAN: Well, we certainly could have had a\npsychiatrist argue that in -- generally speaking,\nadolescents are less mature and on a range of psychosocial\nfactors, they -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, he could have cited all\nthe -- all the authorities you cite in your brief.\nMR. WAXMAN: Right. But, Justice Kennedy, I -\nI concede that.\nThe issue for this Court is whether the\nConstitution requires that as a matter of law, not as a\nmatter of the application of law to a particular\ndefendant, the line has to be drawn this way, and -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose -- suppose that all of\nthe things set forth in your brief were eloquently set\nforth by a psychiatrist to the jury. Could the jury then\nweigh these things that you're telling us?\nMR. WAXMAN: The jury could have weighed these\nthings, but there is no way, even for a psychiatrist or a\npsychologist, much less a juror to -- to be confident\nbecause of the inherent, documented transiency of the\nadolescent personality. No psychiatrist and no juror can\nsay with confidence that the crime that was committed by a\n16- or 17-year-old, on the average 2 years ago -- and this\nis the key point -- proceeded from enduring qualities of\nthat person's character as opposed to the transient\naspects of youth, and therefore -\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: But now, that -- that\nitself is a purported scientific fact, what you just said,\nand it seems to me if we're -- if we're to rely on that,\nit ought to have been tested in the way most facts are.\nMR. WAXMAN: What the jury -- perhaps I'm not\nunderstanding your point.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Well, you're -- you're\nrelying on factual -- the statement you just made was -\nwas a factual statement about the enduring character, et\ncetera. Now, if -- if we are to take that as a fact, it\nought to have been tested somewhere rather than just given\nto us in a brief.\nMR. WAXMAN: Well, the -- the -- an argument to\nthe jury that regardless of what a psychiatrist or a\npsychologist would have said about Christopher Simmons, as\na group, 16- and 17-year-olds have such labile\npersonalities that it is impossible to know whether\nthey're -- the crime that they committed reflected an\nenduring character is an argument that could have been\nmade to spare this particular defendant, but it need not\nhave been credited or given dispositive weight,\nparticularly since at sentencing -- and this Court has\nacknowledged this in cases like Pate v. Robinson and Drope\nv. Illinois -- the jury is evaluating somebody,\ndetermining their moral blameworthiness 2 years later.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But -- but if you're reluctant\nto give it dispositive weight in an individual case, then\nyou come in and ask us to give it dispositive weight as a\ngeneral rule, that seems to me inconsistent.\nMR. WAXMAN: Well, no. What I'm -- what I'm\nasking you to do -- what I'm suggesting is that the weight\nof scientific and medical evidence of which the Court can\ntake judicial notice and should take judicial notice and\ndid take judicial notice in cases like Atkins and Thompson\nand Stanford explains and validates the consensus that\nsociety has drawn. We're not arguing that the science or\nwhat a particular neurobiologist or developmental\npsychologist says dictates the line of 18. The question\nis we have a consensus. It's even more robust than it was\nin Atkins. Looking at proportionality and reliability\nwith respect to that consensus, is there a good,\nobjective, scientific reason to credit the line that\nsociety has drawn?\nAnd I'm suggesting two things. Number one, that\nalthough one could posit that there are 16- and 17-year-\nolds whose antisocial traits are characterological rather\nthan transient, we know it is impossible -- we know this\nfrom common sense and it's been validated by science, of\nwhich the Court can take note, that it is impossible to\nknow whether the crime that was committed by a 16- or 17\nyear-old is a reflection of his true, enduring character\nor whether it's a manifestation of traits that are\nexhibited during adolescence. And -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, suppose -- suppose I -\nI were not convinced about your scientific evidence was\nconclusive and I don't identify a clear consensus. Do you\nlose the case, or can you then make the same argument you\njust made appealing to some other more fundamental\nprinciple that Stanford was just wrong?\nMR. WAXMAN: Here -- no. Well -- no. Here's\nwhat I would appeal to. I -- there are three relevant\nfactors that this Court has to look at. There's the\ndetermination of consensus. Is there enough of a one or\nisn't there? There's the determination of\nproportionality, and then there's the issue identified in\nLockett and in Atkins, which is how reliable is the\nindividualized sentencing process. How reliably -- when\nwe're talking about picking the tiny few who are the worst\nof the worst, how reliably can we do that? We think that\nwith respect to each of those, we have demonstrated that\nthe Eighth Amendment requires recognizing 18.\nBut I will take as a posit your hypothetical\nquestion that I haven't convinced you on number one,\nnumber two, or perhaps individually on all three. This is\ntruly a case, Justice Kennedy, in which the whole is\ngreater than the sum of the parts. Taken together, the\nfact that it's impossible for a jury to know whether the\ncrime of an adolescent was really the feature of an\nenduring character, since we know, as in Atkins, that many\nof the characteristics that manifest themselves in mental\nretardation also affect the inability of adolescents to\ncommunicate with their attorneys, to express remorse, that\n2 years later when this person is on trial, physically,\nemotionally it's not the same person that the jury is\nlooking at and being asked to evaluate -\nJUSTICE BREYER: So that -- that's\n-- that last point was what I thought the scientific\nevidence was getting at, that it simply confirmed what\ncommon sense suggests, that when you execute a person 15\nor sometimes 20 years later, a problem always is that that\nperson isn't the same person who committed the trial in a\nmeaningful sense. And it's specially true of 16- and 17\nyear-olds who, observation would suggest, have a lot of\nchanging to do because their personality is not fully\nformed.\nNow, I thought that the -- the scientific\nevidence simply corroborated something that every parent\nalready knows, and if it's more than that, I would like to\nknow what more.\nMR. WAXMAN: Well, it's -- I think it's -- it's\nmore than that in a couple of respects. It -- it\nexplains, corroborates, and validates what we sort of\nintuitively know, not just as parents but in adults that\n-- that -- who live in a world filled with adolescents.\nAnd -- and the very fact that science -- and I'm not just\ntalking about social science here, but the important\nneurobiological science that has now shown that these\nadolescents are -- their character is not hard-wired.\nIt's why, for example -- here's a -- here's an interesting\nand relevant scientific fact. Psychiatrists under the\nDSM, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, which is their\nBible, are precluded from making a diagnosis of antisocial\npersonality before the age of 18 precisely because before\nthe age of 18, personality and character are not fixed\neven with respect to -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Waxman, I -- I thought we\npunish people, criminals, for what they were, not for what they\nare. I mean, you know, if you have someone who commits a\nheinous crime and by the time he's brought to trial and\nconvicted, he's come to Jesus, we don't let him off\nbecause he's not now what he was then. It seems to me we\npunish people for what they were.\nMR. WAXMAN: We -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And to say that adolescents\nchange, everybody changes, but that doesn't justify\neliminating the -- the proper punishments that society has\ndetermined.\nMR. WAXMAN: I think, with respect, Justice\nScalia, I'm not -- I think that there is an interesting\nquestion about -- with respect to death, whether what they\nare and what they will become is totally irrelevant.\nBut accepting the premise of your question, my\npoint is that science has confirmed what we intuitively\nknow, which is that when the jury gets around to\nevaluating what the character was that manifested that\nhorrible crime, they can't tell because of the passage of\nage and because of a number of confounding factors and\nbecause psychologists and psychiatrists can't tell\nthemselves whether the crime that occurred 2 years ago or\n2 weeks ago was the manifestation of an enduring character\nor transient psychosocial traits that rage in adolescence.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Is part of your answer\nbased on the length of time between the killing and the\ntrial?\nMR. WAXMAN: Only part, Mr. Chief Justice. Part\nof it is that the jury, of course, is looking at the\ndefendant, and we have laid before the Court peer-reviewed\nscientific studies that show that they -- that people are\n-- frequently equate maturity and psychosocial development\nwith race and with physical appearance. In addition,\nbecause the adolescent personality is transient and the\nlapse of time for trial is 2 years, in a very real sense\npsychosocially as opposed to -- in addition to physically,\nthe person that the jury is judging is not the -- is not a\nmanifestation of the person who committed the crime.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Well, what if -- what\nif a State said I see the problem, so we'll bring this\nperson to trial in 6 weeks?\nMR. WAXMAN: Even if it were in 6 weeks, Mr.\nChief Justice, we believe that the process is -- is\nsufficiently -- that would just make the youth the same as\nthe mentally retarded, because the mentally retarded have\nstable personalities and stable characters, and yet, what\nthis Court said in Atkins was we have two things to say.\nOne is that overwhelmingly as a group the mentally\nretarded are unlikely to be among the very worst of the\nworst, and the very deficits that they have -- that you\ncalled deficits in reasoning, judgment, and control of\ntheir impulses, makes the jury -- the process of the jury\nevaluating the moral culpability, the moral\nblameworthiness unreliable. And it's on the basis of\nthose two things that we think that the consensus that's\notherwise reflected is validated. And here -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I have -- I have one other\nquestion I'd like to ask because it's been troubling me\nand I want your comment.\nA number of juveniles run in gangs and a number\nof the gang members are over 18. If we ruled in your\nfavor and this decision was given wide publicity, wouldn't\nthat make 16-, 17-year-olds subject to being persuaded to\nbe the hit men for the gangs?\nMR. WAXMAN: Well -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm -- I'm very concerned\nabout that.\nMR. WAXMAN: I -- I am also concerned about it,\nand I -- I have thought about this. First of all, if they\nare enlisted by people over the age of 18 to do that, the\n-- the precise degree of culpability goes to the people\nwho are over 18, and juries ought to consider whether\npeople who are over the age of 18 have so enlisted them.\nBut even -- but with respect to -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm talking about the\ndeterrent value of the existing rule insofar as the 16\nand 17-year-old. If -- if we rule against you, then the\ndeterrent remains.\nMR. WAXMAN: Well, I think -- I think, as with\nthe mentally retarded, or in fact, even more than with the\nmentally retarded, adolescents -- the -- the role of\ndeterrence has even less to say, precisely because they\nweigh risks differently and they don't see the future and\nthey are impulsive and they're subject to peer pressure.\nAnd in fact, if you look at what happened in\nthis case, it's as good an example as any. The State\nsays, well, okay, you know, he -- you know, this guy,\naccording to the State's witness, the person, who was over\n18 and described as the Fagin of this group of juveniles,\ntestified to the court, well, Christopher Simmons says,\nlet's do it because, quote, we can get away with it.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, there were a number -- a\nnumber of cases in the Alabama amicus brief, which is\nchilling reading -- and I wish that all the people that\nsign on to the amicus briefs had at least read that before\nthey sign on to them -- indicates that often the 17-year-\nold is the ringleader.\nMR. WAXMAN: Well, the 17-year-old may be the\nringleader, and even if you posit that Christopher Simmons\nwas the ringleader here, he -- he wasn't under any\nillusions. He wasn't making a statement about being\nexecuted. He said, we could get away with it, which\nspeaks volumes about the -- the extent to which -- this\nguy was subject to life without parole, which is, Justice\nScalia, fundamentally different than death. This Court\nhas said that only when the penalty is death, do you look\nat the character of the defendant as opposed to the nature\nof the crime and the act.\nBut the data shows -- and I think this Court has\nacknowledged -- it acknowledged in Thompson in any event\n-- that the -- that adolescents like the -- the mentally\nretarded are much less likely to be deterred by the\nprospect of an uncertain, even if probable, very\nsubstantial penalty. The -- no mature adult would have\nthought, as Chris Simmons reportedly said, I can get away\nwith this because I'm 17 years old, when the mandatory\npunishment for him would have been life in prison.\nIt's -- it is not -- eliminating the death\npenalty as an option, which is -- which is imposed so\nrarely as to be more freakish than the death penalty was\nin Furman -- three States in the last 10 years, one -\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But of course, the death\npenalty was not a deterrent for any of the crimes\ndescribed in the Alabama brief because those are all -\ncrimes all occurred in States which execute people under\n18.\nMR. WAXMAN: Yes, and I -- and I -- the -- the\nexamples in the Alabama brief are horrifying. But if you\nlook at those examples, the very first one, this is a kid\nwho went on a killing spree, including his father, because\nhe felt he was unjustly deprived use of the family truck.\nAnd there -- I can go through the other examples, but\nthese are posited as people who a jury could, with a\ndegree of reliability that the Constitution requires, say\nacted out of a stable, enduring character rather than\ntransient aspects of youth? I think that's a poster child\nfor us.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Whereas if it had been done by\nan 18-year-old, a jury could have said that.\nMR. WAXMAN: Well -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: If an 18-year-old did the same\nthing, you say, well, he's certainly stable.\nMR. WAXMAN: May I answer? Briefly.\nThe line -- the science shows what common sense\nunderstands which is that development is a continuum, but\nthe line, 18, is one that has been drawn by society.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr. Waxman.\nMR. WAXMAN: Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Mr. Layton, you have 8\nminutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES R. LAYTON\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. LAYTON: Mr. Simmons, of course, was found\nby the jury to be the ringleader. And in essence, that\ncreates a contrast with the Lee Malvo case where we had\nsomething like what Justice Kennedy referred to, adults\ninfluencing a juvenile, and the jury was able to make that\ndistinction in the Virginia Lee Malvo case.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this question, Mr.\nLayton? This case kind of raises a question about the\nbasic State interests that are involved here, and the\nState interests that justify the death penalty include\ndeterrence and also retribution.\nMR. LAYTON: Yes.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Which, if either, of those do\nyou think is the primary State interest you seek to\nvindicate today?\nMR. LAYTON: I -- I think that they are of equal\nweight in the minds of the legislators in the State of\nMissouri.\nThe -- Mr. Simmons' counsel comes to the edge of\nasking this Court to -\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I just ask one further?\nMR. LAYTON: Yes.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Is there any evidence that the\ndeath penalty for those under 18 or even above has, in\nfact, had any deterrent value?\nMR. LAYTON: From all that I have read, the\nevidence both directions is inconclusive, Your Honor, and\nthus, subject to legislators' determination.\nMr. Simmons' counsel comes to the edge of asking\nthe Court to elevate proportionality to be equivalent to\n-- to a consensus. But let me just highlight two aspects\nof the non-capital case proportionality jurisprudence of\nthis Court.\nJustice Kennedy, in -- in Harmelin recently\ncited by the plurality in Ewing, pointed out that two of\nthe considerations in proportionality review in those\ninstances are the primacy of the legislature and the\nnature of the Federal system. What we should have here is\na principle that is a principle dealing with immaturity,\nand the States, within the Federal system, should be able\nto make the determination as to how to implement it.\nAs pointed out, this Court's jurisprudence in\nEighth Amendment areas has proven to be a one-way ratchet,\nand because of that, the Court has to be very wary of\nleading rather than reflecting societal norms. Now, there\nare some States, of course, that have raised the age, the\nminimum age, for capital punishment, but at least in some\ninstances, such as Missouri, that is a reaction to this\nCourt's jurisprudence, that is, a reaction to Thompson and\nStanford. Other States have left 18 for other purposes,\nand yet there still is a role by this Court.\nPornography is an example. I am confident that\nbut for this Court's First Amendment jurisprudence, the\nMissouri General Assembly would adopt a statute that said\nthat pornography should not be allowed at ages much higher\nthan 18 and not because of maturity, but because of their\nopposition to pornography.\nIn many of the instances cited by Mr. Simmons,\nthe kind of statutes that he cites, gambling and others,\nit is a compromise in the legislative arena, not\nnecessarily based on maturity or immaturity, that leads to\nthe selection of the age of 18. Many States have, of\ncourse, individualized determinations with regard to those\nstatutes. There was a discussion of driver's licenses.\nIn Missouri, of course, we allow people to drive at age\n15. They have to have parental consent, yes, but there\nalso is a test. That is, there is an individualized\ndetermination before we do that, and that's what the State\nrequests here.\nMr. Simmons' counsel points out that in Atkins\nthe Court took judicial notice of psychosocial evidence,\nand that's true. The Court did. But remember that what\nthe Court had before it in Atkins was not a proxy for a -\na factor that plays into culpability. It was, in fact,\nthe factor itself, that is mental capacity. And what they\nwant here is not a determination as to the maturity or the\ncapacity of individuals. They want a bright line test\nthat is based purely on age.\nThis Court should adopt, as it did in Atkins, a\nprinciple and leave it to the States to act. That's what\nthe Court did in --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Of course, one -- one of the\nobjections in -- in Atkins was we needed a bright line\ntest. We'd have difficulty determining which ones are\nmentally retarded. Here we don't have that problem at\nall. I guess everybody knows whether or not the defendant\nis over or under 18.\nMR. LAYTON: Well, if that's the bright line.\nWe don't know whether they're mature or immature, and we\nhave to measure that somehow.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But the -- but the purpose of\na bright line test is to avoid litigation over the\nborderline cases, and you just have completely avoided\nthat in this category.\nMR. LAYTON: Because the -- having a bright line\ntest means that the individual who murders at age 17, 364\ndays is treated differently than a more -- a less mature\nindividual who is 2 days older.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But it's an equally arbitrary\nline if it's 16, 17, or 15.\nMR. LAYTON: Yes, it is, and it's an arbitrary\nline that the legislatures have set because it's a\nlegislative type determination based on what even Mr.\nWaxman called legislative facts.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask one -- have you read\nthe brief of the former U.S. diplomats in the case?\nMR. LAYTON: Yes.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Do you think we should give\nany credence whatsoever to the arguments they make?\nMR. LAYTON: No.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE STEVENS: The respect of other countries\nfor our country is something we should totally ignore.\nMR. LAYTON: That's not for this Court to\ndecide. Congress should consider that. The legislatures\nshould consider that. It's an important consideration,\nbut it is not a consideration under the Eighth Amendment.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: We should leave it up to the\nlegislature of the State of Missouri to resolve those\nquestions.\nMR. LAYTON: Within the parameters of -- of\nThompson and Stanford, yes. Yes.\nThe Missouri Supreme Court -- the Atkins v.\nVirginia -- in Atkins v. Virginia, this Court did not\nauthorize the Missouri Supreme Court to reject Stanford.\nThe Court should refuse to -- to sanction such activity by\nthe lower courts and continue the course it set in that\ndecision.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr. Layton.\n"
