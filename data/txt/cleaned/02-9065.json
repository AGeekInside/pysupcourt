Mark Close.\nMs. Beckwith.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF CORINNE BECKWITH\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMS. BECKWITH: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and\nmay it please the Court:\nThe petitioner in this case, Shakur Muhammad, is\na state prisoner who has brought a civil rights action\nalleging that a prison guard framed him on a false\ndisciplinary charge in retaliation for his having\nexercised his constitutional right to seek redress in the\ncourts for this same prison guard's previous misconduct.\nFor three reasons, this Court should not engraft onto this\ntype of Section 1983 claim a favorable termination\nrequirement that would make this prisoner have to win his\nclaim in another forum before he can seek his remedy in\nFederal court.\nFirst, the favorable termination requirement is\na habeas protecting advice - device - that was borne of\nthis Court's recognition that Congress would not have\nwanted a general civil rights action to be the vehicle for\nundoing a state criminal judgment, particularly given the\nmore specific habeas exhaustion requirement.\nSecond, extending the favorable termination\nrequirement beyond this original rationale lacks any basis\nin the statute's terms or history, and it's devoid of the\nkind of common law pedigree that might suggest Congress\nenvisioned a broader application to cases that do not look\nlike habeas cases in that they don't involve a direct or\nan indirect challenge to the fact or duration of custody.\nAnd finally, any remaining qualms about\nCongress' intent are resolved by the Prison Litigation\nReform Act, where, after carefully weighing the interests\nof overburdened courts and of prison officials, Congress\nimposed an administrative exhaustion requirement, not a\nfavorable termination requirement.\nQUESTION: But I don't understand this about this\ncase. I'm having an awfully hard time understanding this\ncase, and - and it seemed to me what had happened was that\nthe - your client, who's certainly well represented, he is\nsitting there at lunch and he makes some faces or gestures\nand the prison guard then has him up for a couple of\ncharges and he basically is acquitted of the more serious\none and they punish him for the more - less serious,\nthreatening behavior, no, it's insolence or something like\nthat.\nHe never says a word about retaliation, never\nsays a word about it. He never appeals, which he could\nhave done, his conviction. He never says to the prison\nauthorities, hey, throw this out. The whole thing was\nbased on the guard's desire to retaliate. And now\nsuddenly have his - not having done any of that, we're in\nFederal court, and the Federal magistrate says, you know,\nhe has no evidence of retaliation, or at least not enough.\nAnd now we're up here arguing about Heck v.\nHumphrey, sort of like the Finnegan's Wake of the habeas\ncorpus law, and I - I can't really understand how we even\ngot here. I - I don't understand why, if you're right,\nthis isn't an unexhausted claim, or at least the\nmagistrate said you don't - your client, unfortunately for\nhim, has not enough evidence. How do we get into this?\nQUESTION: Well, I suppose one of the reasons you\ngot into it was that the Sixth Circuit said that you had -\nhad to comply with Heck against Humphrey, and you didn't\nagree with it.\nMS. BECKWITH: Well, that's right, and you know,\nthis is undoubtedly a valid First Amendment retaliation\nclaim. The idea here is our - our client is saying, you\nknow, he - he made perfectly appropriate allegations in\nthe courts against this prison - this prison guard in\nprior lawsuits, and the guard set out to get him -\nQUESTION: Can we reach this - I can't reach the\nSixth - the question that the circuit thought was here. I\ndon't see what we're supposed to say. What are we\nsupposed to say? That - that this unexhausted claim,\nnonetheless, in 1983 states a claim?\nMS. BECKWITH: It's not - I don't believe it's an\n-\nQUESTION: If I said what I said, is that correct\nwhat I've said?\nMS. BECKWITH: I don't think so, because it's not\nan unexhausted claim, and I believe the whole point of\nthis case is the - is the misstatement of the law by the\nSixth Circuit that would deem this a non-civil rights\nclaim, basically a habeas claim completely contrary to\nthis Court's precedent in Preiser. We have, you know,\nPreiser v. Rodriguez, which set up the way, you know,\nfollowed up on by Heck v. Humphrey, the way that we decide\nwhich way these cases should go. Is this a civil rights\nclaim? It should go through 1983. Or is it something\nwe're worried might swallow the habeas exhaustion\nrequirement?\nQUESTION: Well, does the Heck Humphrey issue\nthat comes to us one that is affected by whether good-\ntime credits are lost?\nMS. BECKWITH: The - whether good-time credits\nare lost is a - is a consideration and whether this is a\nfact or duration case.\nQUESTION: Right.\nMS. BECKWITH: And this case is nothing about -\nQUESTION: So after all the briefing, the\nadditional briefing that's gone on, do we know now for\nsure whether good-time credits are affected here?\nMS. BECKWITH: I think we do. The most important\npoint on that question, Justice O'Connor, is something\nthat I - a point I unfortunately made in a footnote\ninstead of in the text, footnote 6 on page 5 of the yellow\nbrief, which I wish had been the first sentence of my\nissue in bold, and that point is that it doesn't matter,\nbecause we're not - no part of our constitutional claim\nchallenges the insolence conviction.\nQUESTION: But is - is that really the point?\nIt's not what you challenge, it's the implication of what\nyou want to be held.\nMS. BECKWITH: It - that's right.\nQUESTION: And those are quite different things.\nI mean, if in fact good-time credits are lost, even though\nyou are not asking for any adjudication on good-time\ncredits, then it necessarily follows that the length of\nthe sentence can be affected, and it necessarily follows\nthat at some point there could be a habeas claim because\nthe individual was not being released.\nMS. BECKWITH: That's right, but there's nothing\nabout this claim that would ever, you know, ever lead to\nthe result, under the test necessarily imply the\ninvalidity of the deprivation of good-time credits, which,\nby the way, I don't believe we were deprived of good-time\ncredits, because of the reasons I state in my brief. Our\nclient is a habitual offender and this claim was not\nraised in the lower court but -\nQUESTION: Well, let - let's - could we just make\na short excursus there? Assuming that no good-time\ncredits are lost with respect to the minimum sentence, the\npoint of - determining the earliest point at which he\ncould be paroled, isn't it the case under state law that\ngood-time credits still would be applied to the maximum\nsentence?\nMS. BECKWITH: That - that is true. I don't\nbelieve that would ever -\nQUESTION: Then - then isn't that the end of your\nargument -\nMS. BECKWITH: I don't think so.\nQUESTION: - because doesn't it - I mean, let me\njust finish -\nMS. BECKWITH: Sure.\nQUESTION: - my - my question so you know where\nI'm going. If - if - if the good-time credits would apply\nto the maximum sentence, then it seems to me that if he is\nnot released at the point at which he says he should be\nentitled to good-time credits, he's got a habeas claim.\nMS. BECKWITH: I don't think that - I think that\nthat aspect of the claim, you know, aside from waiver and\naside from not challenging the conviction that led to the\ngood-time credits, if they exist, is still not true, I\ndon't think. It - it's too hypothetical. Most of these\ncases are like Preiser, where there would be immediate\nrelease. He has to serve his minimum sentence under\nMichigan law, so he's not ever going to get out earlier\nthan his minimum. He - those will not be shortened by\ngood-time credits.\nAfter that, he's going to see the parole board\nseveral times. He's going to be 103 years old when he\nhits his maximum sentence. The likelihood that he would\nactually not be dismissed until his maximum sentence, you\nknow, be discharged as opposed to paroled earlier than\nthat and have his sentence terminated long before his\nmaximum, you know, just makes it impossible that this\nwould be anything but hypothetical -\nQUESTION: Well, but for ease of judicial\nadministration, do we really want to have to look at how\nold he's going to be and all of these things? Is it not\npossible to say at the end of the day, good-time credits\nstill apply to the maximum, so you're out of here?\nMS. BECKWITH: Well, that may be true in another\ncase, but it's not true in our case, because we're not\nchallenging, you know, nothing about our constitutional\nclaim would necessarily imply the invalidity of that\ninsolence conviction.\nQUESTION: Well, sticking with Justice O'Connor's\nquestion, suppose good-time credits were involved here,\nbut insofar as the prisoner is concerned, it was wholly\nperipheral, and assume that the good-time credits would\nnot click into operation for another 20 years. Would it\nmake sense for us to insist on Heck v. Humphrey in those\ncircumstances?\nMS. BECKWITH: In - I mean, I think that - that\nPreiser created a clean line, and this Court has decided\nrepeatedly that good-time - the loss of good-time credits\nfalls on the fact or duration side of that line, and I\nthink it makes sense to continue to maintain that clean\nline, and it's the kind of thing where good-time credits\nare the hard case. There's -\nQUESTION: So you think it does - so you think\nthat if good-time credits were unequivocally involved\nhere, that the Heck rule would apply?\nMS. BECKWITH: I don't - I - I think that's what\nthis Court's precedents would suggest. There might be\nroom for reconsideration of the good-time credits in the\nfuture when it - when it starts to get real hypothetical\nor when there - if there might be some abuses, such as\nprison, you know, evidence that prisons were, you know,\nhad the perverse incentive of tacking on good-time credits\nto -\nQUESTION: Well, this is - this is very strange\nwhen we - when the original idea, I thought, of Heck was\ntyping the kind of claim. I think the Court said in that\ncase, this is not a prison condition case like my dietary\nlaw is not observed, am I not getting medical treatment,\nbut it - it is like - there was an analogy to malicious\nprosecution, and here this has the same flavor, that this\nis - the complaint is that this guard had it in for me,\nand there were trumped up charges.\nAnd the way you get around - would you say\nyou're not really attacking the insolence, what he - he\nwas convicted, so you're only concerned with the six days\npre-hearing detention, but I don't see how you can, in all\ncandor, chop up your complaint that way, because if the\nofficer hadn't been retaliatory, the officer wouldn't have\nconfronted him in the first place, he wouldn't have been\ninsolent, and nothing would happen. So how you can say\nis, well, we'll accept the insolence but really we don't\nbecause this is a retaliation and there never would have\nbeen any charge at all.\nMS. BECKWITH: Well, I - that's - part - along\nthe lines of the argument the respondent makes in trying\nto use a - sort of a but-for kind of take, or test, or a\nrelevance kind of test, but that is not the test. The\ntest is whether the claim, the constitutional claim, would\nnecessarily imply the invalidity of the conviction or\nsentence -\nQUESTION: I - I thought your response to that\nwas that provocation was no defense to the charge -\nMS. BECKWITH: That's right.\nQUESTION: - to the charge of insolence.\nMS. BECKWITH: The respondent is - is arguing\nthat - that it goes to credibility. Credibility is not\nenough. That's about relevance or admissibility.\nQUESTION: But is not your position, and I don't\nknow that the other side has contested it, that\nprovocation would not have been a defense to the charge of\ninsolence?\nMS. BECKWITH: That's right. There's no -\nQUESTION: And therefore, your provocation claim\ndoes not invalidate the insolence conviction.\nMS. BECKWITH: There's - there's - that's\ncorrect, Justice Scalia. There's no way of litigating -\nQUESTION: How - how do I decide that, because\nthat, it seems to me, is why I kept thinking I'm having\ntrouble with this case?\nMS. BECKWITH: Well -\nQUESTION: It is inconceivable to me that under\nany law of any place that if a guard has gone and brought\nthis whole thing about as a way of retaliating against a\nFirst Amendment right, I can't imagine a tribunal that\nwouldn't throw out the whole thing. I mean, I know you\nsay, oh no, that isn't what they would have done. If he\nhad gone to that disciplinary body and it said, look, I\nhave proof here that this is total fake by the guard in\nretaliation for my First Amendment right, what that body\nwould have said is, we convict you still of insolence but\nnot of the greater charge.\nThat to me is inconceivable, but whether that's\nso or not is a pure matter of state law, and - and it\nseems to me that this case then turns on a pure matter of\nstate law, because I think if it is totally separate maybe\nyou're right. If it isn't totally separate, I don't see\nhow you could be right.\nMS. BECKWITH: And it is. I have several answer\nthat. It is totally separate. You - you can't litigate\nthe retaliation claim in - in a - in a prison misconduct\nhearing, just as Rodney King couldn't -\nQUESTION: You couldn't - you couldn't say,\nhearing examiner in the prison, I want to tell you\nsomething. The guard's doing this because I filed some\nearlier claims against him. What - what would be so hard\nabout doing that?\nMS. BECKWITH: In fact, we actually - the hearing\nofficer himself, in his deposition, which is at joint\nappendix 102 to 103, indicates he - he - retaliation was\nnot a defense. It might go to credibility, but he can't\nconsider that -\nQUESTION: No, but that's a - that's an issue of\nfact. And the thing that's bothering Justice Breyer is\nthe same thing that's bothering me, and that is it seems a\n- it seems like a very strange statement of law to say\nthat there would be no retaliation defense, and if - and\nyet it seems to me you've got to say that in order to\navoid Heck and Humphrey. So what's your basis for saying\nit? Do you have -\nMS. BECKWITH: It's -\nQUESTION: - any state law authority for saying\nthat so that we could make that assumption that you are\ncorrect in your statement when we decide this case?\nMS. BECKWITH: To tell you the truth, I just\nassumed it as - as a logical matter. It's like, as I was\nsaying before, Rodney -\nQUESTION: You assumed that in - in the - in the\ndisciplinary proceeding for - that, let's say, in a\ndisciplinary proceeding for insolence, he would not be -\nthe prisoner would not have the opportunity of saying, he\ngot me into this situation in retaliation for filing these\nactions? You just assumed that?\nMS. BECKWITH: Right. It's just like assault on\na police officer. If you're arrested because you're black\nand then you assault that police officer, you - you know,\nyour - your 1983 claim on the illegal arrest is not, you\nknow, it's - it's separate and apart from -\nQUESTION: But we're talking here about\ninsolence. I mean, he gave him a dirty look or something\nor other.\nMS. BECKWITH: The - the hearing officer himself\nsaid that -\nQUESTION: Well, is there any state law authority\nthat we could look to?\nMS. BECKWITH: I'm not aware of any and I'm sorry\nthat I -\nQUESTION: Well, it doesn't seem unreasonable to\nme. A police officer who's charged with a civil rights\nviolation for - for whacking a demonstrator cannot please\n- plead as a defense, I was provoked. Doesn't matter if\nyou're provoked, you're not supposed to do - do the act,\nand I don't know why it would be any different with - with\na prison inmate if - if he was provoked -\nQUESTION: But he doesn't admit that.\nQUESTION: - to resist the provocation.\nMS. BECKWITH: And in any event -\nQUESTION: What's so unreasonable about that?\nMS. BECKWITH: - I think that what - whether we\nchallenge the - the misconduct - the result of the\nmisconduct proceeding in this case is really not relevant\nbecause -\nQUESTION: Well, his - his complaint doesn't say\nthe kind of thing you just said. I think his complaint\nsays, I'm sitting there, the officer made some faces,\nlured me into this whole thing, and then what he charged\nme with was false. So I - I didn't see - it's what\nJustice Ginsburg, I think, was talking about at the\nbeginning. I'm just - maybe you have nothing else to say\non it, but I saw this being chopped up. I saw one\nincident, it being chopped up as if there were several\nthings, one insolence, one threatening behavior, and then\nseparating that out, and I got totally confused about the\nHeck v. Humphrey part, the exhaustion part -\nMS. BECKWITH: The - the complaint is very clear.\nI mean, the gist - the most tangible part of - of the\ncomplaint is that I was overcharged, you know, and I had\nto do pre-hearing detention, six days in pre-hearing\ndetention that I would not otherwise have had to do\nbecause this guard was retaliating against me for suing\nhim, for exercising -\nQUESTION: This is the amended complaint. It was\nnot his original complaint, and one of the many puzzling\nfeatures in this case is the Sixth Circuit is addressing\nthe original complaint, where this man says, I want the\nwhole thing expunged, not that, yes, I was insolent, but I\nwasn't engaged in threatening behavior. The initial\ncomplaint said, this officer retaliated against me, the\nwhole thing is no good, court, expunge the discipline.\nAnd it was only in the amended complaint that they came up\nwith this theory, oh, insolence was all right, and the\nonly thing that we're attacking is the threatening\nbehavior.\nMS. BECKWITH: Well, the two complaints are\nactually very similar, maybe identical, except for the -\nremoving the request for expungement. And, of course, the\nSixth Circuit's -\nQUESTION: Well, isn't that a rather significant\ndifference, because that says the whole thing is no good,\nthe insolence is no better than the threatening, the whole\nthing is no good?\nMS. BECKWITH: Mr. Muhammad was - was not\nrepresented by counsel. He was - he was working pro se,\nand he amended his complaint. The amended complaint was\naccepted and that's - that's the complaint that's - that's\nbefore -\nQUESTION: But that's not what - that isn't the\ncomplaint that was before the Sixth Circuit, so at a\nminimum, shouldn't we send it back to the Sixth Circuit -\nMS. BECKWITH: No.\nQUESTION: - and say, look, you looked at the\nwrong complaint?\nMS. BECKWITH: Well, it was the complaint that\nwas before the Sixth Circuit. They just made a factual\nerror, and I think both parties agree it was a factual\nerror, but it's one that didn't matter.\nQUESTION: Nonetheless, they ruled on a complaint\nthat is not the one he was complaining about.\nMS. BECKWITH: But - but it doesn't matter,\nbecause they relied on Huey v. Stine and the case law in\nthe Sixth Circuit. It wouldn't matter whether you asked\nfor expungement or not if you are challenging the result,\nwhich the Sixth Circuit thought -\nQUESTION: Excuse me. All of this is relevant\nwhy? Because of the issue of whether he's lost any good-\ntime credit, isn't that right?\nMS. BECKWITH: I don't -\nQUESTION: Wasn't that issue waived by the other\nside and wasn't - wasn't there a finding? As I understand\nit, there was a finding by a - by the magistrate that\nplaintiff is no longer in the more restrictive custody of\ntoplock or administrative segregation, nor in the more\nextended custody that would still faced him had he lost\nany good-time credit, and an issue was never made by the\nother side as I understand it, nor before the Sixth\nCircuit, that he had lost any - any good-time credit. Am\nI wrong in that?\nMS. BECKWITH: That's absolutely right. The\nissue wasn't presented -\nQUESTION: So it's waived.\ninto that here?\nMS. BECKWITH: Right. And if - but if -\nQUESTION: Especially having granted cert on a -\non - on a significant question, to which that - that is -\nis preliminary.\nMS. BECKWITH: That's correct, Justice Scalia,\nand if good-time credits are not at issue, it doesn't\nmatter if we're challenging the insolence conviction,\nbecause nothing about this claim is going to affect the\nfact or duration of - of confinement, so that, you know -\nQUESTION: Though the state does dispute you on\nthe good-time credit, does it not?\nMS. BECKWITH: The state does dispute. You know,\nI think they're wrong for four reasons.\nQUESTION: But too late, but too late. Isn't\nthat your point? They dispute you, but too late.\nMS. BECKWITH: That is my point. I mean, that is\nmy best point. My second best point -\nQUESTION: Okay. If you're right on that point,\nthen it's the easiest case ever, you're obviously right.\nIf it has nothing to do with good-time credit -\nMS. BECKWITH: Well -\nQUESTION: - if you can chop up the - the action\nin that way, if all you're complaining about is six days\nthat he spent in pre-trial detention and your winning on\nthat would have nothing to do with anything else, would\nnot set aside the rest of the - of the loss of good time\nor anything else, then you're obviously right.\nMS. BECKWITH: That's right.\nQUESTION: That's what she says.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: Why is it an issue for us?\nMS. BECKWITH: I agree. It's an issue because\nthe respondent is trying to push the test of, you know, of\nHeck v. Humphrey into the context of misconduct\nproceedings, regardless of the punishment imposed. They\nsay even -\nQUESTION: You don't - you don't say that Heck\nagainst Humphrey should never apply to misconduct\nproceedings, do you?\nMS. BECKWITH: No.\nQUESTION: You just say it shouldn't have -\nMS. BECKWITH: As in Edwards, it should\ndefinitely apply when good-time credits are lost or\nsomething else happens, you know, in the proceeding. I\ncan't imagine what besides good-time credits, but if fact\nor duration is affected - in this case, fact or duration\nwas not affected. This is a classic civil rights claim.\nWe're talking about the First Amendment. It could have\nbeen about religion. It could have been about race.\nQUESTION: Know what is very strange about this\ncase is you've got these two threshold requirements. If\nit's a habeas line, then you can't skirt exhausting state\njudicial remedies. If it's a prison condition case, then\nyou have the PLRA, you have to exhaust the internal\nremedies. Here, you didn't do either. I mean, if you\ntake it on your case, this is really in the prison\nconditions line. You didn't even appeal internally.\nMS. BECKWITH: But that's - that's not at issue\nin this case. The - the respondent complained in the\ncourts below about exhaustion. It was considered by the\nlower court. The respondent said, you didn't seek\nrehearing, and the magistrate judge said, I disagree with\nyou, he didn't have to seek rehearing because he's not\ncomplaining about the insolence -\nQUESTION: But, nonetheless, you are saying that\nthis is a case that can go into court under 1983 even\nthough there was - it's not on the habeas side so you\ndon't have to exhaust the judicial remedies. It's not on\nthe prison conditions side and you don't have to - you\ndon't have to exhaust internal administrative remedies.\nMS. BECKWITH: Justice Ginsburg, I absolutely\ndisagree. He did exhaust. This was a question -\nQUESTION: What did he exhaust?\nMS. BECKWITH: He - he did everything he needed\nto do. The magistrate judge held that and the district\njudge affirmed that and it wasn't appealed -\nQUESTION: Where? Because it seems to me that he\ndidn't. He didn't ask for anything.\nMS. BECKWITH: In -\nQUESTION: He said - and he said, indeed, I'm not\nchallenging, I'm not challenging the insolence conviction.\nMS. BECKWITH: Record 68, the district court\nrecord in 68, unfortunately it's not in the joint appendix\nat - at 8 to 9 - pages 8 to 9, the magistrate held that\nMr. Muhammad exhausted, without seeking rehearing he\nexhausted. And there was also a -\nQUESTION: But can you tell me exactly what that\nwas, because I don't see how he - he had?\nMS. BECKWITH: Well, the -\nQUESTION: He might have said he didn't need to\nexhaust.\nMS. BECKWITH: No, the - the - the government\nfiled a brief, a motion to dismiss, saying, you know, many\nthings, but one of the things was he didn't exhaust his\nadministrative remedies and they said because he didn't\nseek rehearing, respondent, or the - Mr. Muhammad\nresponded, I didn't have to seek rehearing because I'm not\ncomplaining about the insolence.\ninsolence. And the magistrate agreed. That's the end of\nexhaustion.\nQUESTION: Exactly. But did he exhaust\nadministrative remedies for what he's complaining about\nhere, which is -\nMS. BECKWITH: Right. There was no -\nQUESTION: - which is not the insolence\nconviction, but rather the sixth - the six day lockdown or\nwhatever he had pending the hearing on the higher charge.\nMS. BECKWITH: As far as we know, he exhausted\neverything that he needed to exhaust.\nQUESTION: Well, how - how could that be,\nbecause -\nMS. BECKWITH: The government -\nQUESTION: I know they said that, and that's one\nof the reasons I'm having difficulty. You would have\nthought that if he was retaliated against, he would have\nsaid to the hearing examiner, I was retaliated against me,\nthe whole thing is no good, I had six days that I spent,\nat least deduct the six days from the seven days\nadditional punishment you're giving me. He didn't say\nthat. Nobody knew a thing about it. He didn't ask for a\nrehearing. He didn't ask a judge - I mean -\nMS. BECKWITH: I -\nQUESTION: - what I'm worried about is writing an\nopinion in this that says you're completely right, and in\nthe course of doing that by every assumption I have to\nmake, so mixing up the law that nobody can understand what\nit is.\nMS. BECKWITH: I understand. There - there's no\ndoubt that the PLRA requires exhaustion of administrative\nremedies. It's not at issue in this case. It's not\njurisdictional. Every circuit court to consider the issue\nhas said it's not jurisdictional. The government raised\nthe - the question. The lower court considered it. They\n- they ruled in our favor. It's not a part of this case\nanymore.\nQUESTION: Was it raised on appeal?\nMS. BECKWITH: It was not raised on appeal.\nQUESTION: Was it raised in the brief in\nopposition?\nMS. BECKWITH: In - in cert?\nQUESTION: To the petition for cert?\nMS. BECKWITH: No.\nQUESTION: Not the state, from the district court\nor the court of appeals?\nMS. BECKWITH: That's right, but it was not part\nof - of the government's response, failure to exhaust. It\nwas decided in the lower court. It's - it's over.\nQUESTION: Is - is it clear that the wrong of\nwhich he's complain - complains - is one of the wrongs set\nforth in the Prison Litigation Reform Act, or is this - is\nthis some -\nMS. BECKWITH: Yes. And in fact, that - that's\none of our arguments that the Prison Litigation Reform Act\nreaffirms the - the clean line that was created in\nPreiser. You have fact or duration claims and you have\nconditions claims, Prison Litigation Reform Act, in - in\ncreating an exhaust - an administrative exhaustion\nrequirement for conditions claims, you know, indicates\nthat this is the kind of claim that needs to exhaust.\nQUESTION: If he had been charged initially just\nwith insolence instead of threatening behavior, that is\nbondable, but that doesn't mean that he would have been\nbonded, right? That's a discretionary determination.\nMS. BECKWITH: That's right.\nQUESTION: So it might have been the very same\nthing. The officer might have said, this is a bad guy,\ndon't let him out until after the hearing. So, in one\ncase, he can't get out because it's mandatory pre-trial\ndetention. In the other - so this case is not about he\nhad a right to be free, or free in the prison population\nthose six days, but he could have argued that he should\nhave been not locked up. Is that's what the - that's the\nwhole thing that this case is about, right?\nMS. BECKWITH: I mean, his - his claim is a First\nAmendment retaliation claim. The damages are this, you\nknow, the chilling effect, the six days of pre-hearing\ndetention, but that's just a remedial question. The claim\nis a valid one.\nQUESTION: I thought he's suing for damages and\nthat's the only thing he's suing for, not injunctive,\nnothing else. All he wants is money.\nMS. BECKWITH: That's right. That's right.\nQUESTION: And what he wants money is for the six\ndays that he might have spent anyway.\nMS. BECKWITH: He wouldn't have spent it anyway,\nand you can see from the joint appendix at page 58, credit\nwas not given -\nQUESTION: No, I'm not talking about - it's\nbondable. There's nothing that shows that if the charge\nhad simply been insolence they wouldn't have held him for\nthe six days. He wasn't entitled not to be held.\nMS. BECKWITH: That's purely speculative and a\nmatter of remedy, not - not the right. Mr. Chief Justice,\nif I may reserve the balance of my time.\nQUESTION: Very well, Ms. Beckwith.\nMr. Casey, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS L. CASEY\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. CASEY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please\nthe Court:\nI agree this is a very confusing case. We\nbelieve there are several reasons why summary judgment\nshould be affirmed. The first is that because Mr.\nMuhammad did lose good-time credits, and because the\nnature of his challenge necessarily implies the invalidity\nof his misconduct determination, we think this case is\ncontrolled by Edwards v. Balisok.\nQUESTION: Why didn't you waive the question of\ngood-time credits? I mean, why - you - you heard the\ndiscussion before.\nMR. CASEY: Yes.\nQUESTION: Why - why is this something we should\nconsider?\nMR. CASEY: First of all, we believe it's - it's\na matter of straightforward statutory - not even\ninterpretation, just reading the text of the Michigan\nstatutes on good time, so it's not some fact issue that -\nthat can be waived. Secondly -\nQUESTION: Excuse me? Only fact issues can be -\nlegal issues can't be waived?\nMR. CASEY: No, it's not a legal argument. This\nis a straightforward - a straightforward application of\nthe statutory language that says he did lose good time.\nQUESTION: You did not - did you make the point\nbelow that the other side has to lose because he lost\ngood-time credit?\nMR. CASEY: In our first motion for summary\njudgment, which was in 1998, we argued that Heck and\nEdwards controlled the case, that he was in effect\nchallenging his good - or his misconduct hearing\ndetermination. The magistrate of the district court\ndenied that motion, saying he is not challenging his\nmisconduct. They agreed with his theory that this was a\nstand-alone retaliation case. So nobody - neither party\nnor the district court nor the Sixth Circuit got into the\nfine points of the argument about whether this was a\nduration case or a conditions case.\nQUESTION: Then why isn't it waived?\nMR. CASEY: Well, we submit it's - it's a\nstraightforward matter. It appears that the magistrate,\nin his opinion or his recommendation denying our motion\nfor summary judgment, was under the impression he did not\nlose good time.\nQUESTION: Okay. And let's assume the magistrate\nwas wrong. As I understand it, you did not go to the\ndistrict court and say, the magistrate is wrong on this\npoint and this point can be dispositive under Heck. Am I\ncorrect?\nMR. CASEY: We did not argue it in those terms.\nWe argued, as I say, the broader application of Heck and\nEdwards to the effect that he was - the nature of his\nchallenge necessarily implied that his -\nQUESTION: But your position - your position as I\nunderstand was that even if he did not lose any good-time\ncredits, that you - nevertheless, Heck controls.\nMR. CASEY: Yes.\nQUESTION: And that's the question -\nQUESTION: And that's what -\nQUESTION: - on which we granted certiorari.\nThat's the question we - whether a plaintiff who wishes to\nbring a 1983 suit challenging only the conditions rather\nthan the fact or duration of his confinement must satisfy\nHeck v. Humphrey. Now, that question is not in the case,\nif indeed the duration of his confinement is what is\naffected. And did you respond in the brief in opposition\nby saying, actually, this question is not even in the\ncase?\nMR. CASEY: Yes. We -\nQUESTION: But even if you did, it's not in the\ncase, none of it's in the case on the assumption your\ncolleague there was making, or your opponent. Imagine\nthat Mr. Muhammad wins his claim in the 1983 action, which\nthe fact that they thought didn't have enough evidence\nsuggests he wouldn't, but suppose he did. Then he says,\nwhat I've showed was illegal under the Constitution or\nwhatever, was, by being put in confinement for six days\nbefore my hearing, and my being charged with threatening\nbehavior, that's it, that's all. The rest of it is all\nbeside the point. I don't complain about my insolence. I\ndon't complain about the seven days. I don't complain\nabout the loss of good time. I don't complain about\nanything except the six pre-hearing days and the later\ndropped charge of threatening.\nSo, if he's right about that, if you can do\nthat, if in fact his winning on that in no way calls into\nquestion the conviction or the loss of good time or the\nseven later days for insolence, then under Heck, of course\nhe can bring it.\nMR. CASEY: Yes, that - that's correct. Heck -\nthe favorable termination requirement of Heck only applies\nwhen the nature of the challenge necessarily implies -\nQUESTION: Fine. So now I've got to the point\nthat either she's obviously right or you're obviously\nright, and what it depends upon is a matter of state law,\nwhich is whether, as a matter of state law, should he win\nthis claim, it is true that his showing the retaliation in\nrespect to the six previous days and threatening in no way\ncalls into question the validity of the insolence\nconviction, the seven days, and the loss of good time. So\nI say, what is the answer to that question of state law?\nOr a sister concluded - it's fairly obvious under the law\nthat they are separate. Now what do you conclude?\nMR. CASEY: We argue that they are not separate,\nthat the nature of this challenge does in fact necessarily\nimply the invalidity of his misconduct determination.\nWhat he's challenging in this Federal lawsuit is\nretaliatory disciplinary action. That - that's the\nlanguage that he used in his amended complaint. What he's\nsaying is that the guard acted with an improper motive and\nthat these adverse consequences flowed from that. The\nonly adverse consequences that he's alleging are involved\nin the misconduct hearing. So we don't think that the\nfact that he was found guilty of insolence and not\nthreatening behavior has any bearing at all on this\nquestion. It was one incident, one charge that this\nparticular hearing officer felt should be reduced to a\nlower charge, but the nature of his challenge, if - if Mr.\nMuhammad is correct that this guard acted\nunconstitutionally, there should not have been any\nmisconduct charges, should not have been a hearing, should\nnot have been any pre-hearing detention or post-hearing\npunishment.\nQUESTION: Is - is - is that so?\nit, as a matter of constitutional law, you - you could not\n- you could not say that a prisoner has no right to\nthreaten a guard even if he - even if he claims to have\nbeen provoked or has no right to insolent behavior even if\nhe claims to have been provoked? As a matter of\nconstitutional law, the prison cannot have such rules?\nMR. CASEY: The Heck v. Humphrey analysis says\nthat there were certain claims that are not cognizable on\na money damage action under 1983. Our argument is this is\nsuch a claim. If a punishment imposed affects the\nduration of confinement, the loss of good time, then under\nEdwards v. Balisok, termination requires -\nQUESTION: I'm saying it - it does not affect it\nif he would have been convicted anyway, and the contention\nof the other side is that he was guilty of the offense,\nboth the major offense, if he had been guilty of that, and\nthe minor offense, regardless of whether there was\nprovocation on the part of the guard.\nMR. CASEY: Correct. That - that's his claim.\nOur argument is that -\nQUESTION: Well, why - why do you - why do you\nassert the opposite?\nMR. CASEY: Well, that - that implicates the\nelements of the common law tort of malicious prosecution,\nas discussed in Heck and Edwards, and those elements\ninclude favorable termination and probable cause.\nQUESTION: But I think what you're not - it isn't\nthe issue of whether provocation is a defense to a charge\nof insolence. I thought what you were saying is that this\nwhole string never would have happened, nothing would have\nhappened. If he - if he establishes the retaliation, then\nnone of this would have happened, and it's just one\nepisode.\nMR. CASEY: Well, if - if he's correct that this\nretaliation is independent of the hearing process, that's\n- that's his argument. Our argument is that the only\nthing he's complaining about is the retaliatory action,\nand the retaliatory action was charging him with\nmisconduct. He -\nQUESTION: Is not - not retaliation separate in\nthe hearing process. You're saying, is his point that\nwhen the guard looked at him from outside the cafeteria\nand made faces at him, and then he came in, and then the\nprisoner stands up and gives him some very dirty looks,\naccording to the guard. Now, if you can separate out\nthere the retaliation, if you can separate out there what\nthe guard did by way of retaliation, making some very bad\nfaces through the window, and insolence under state law,\nwhich would exist even if the guard were badly motivated\nin making the bad faces, then you've got your two separate\nthings.\nMR. CASEY: Under Sixth Circuit law, to establish\na claim for retaliation, there has to be protective\nconduct that the inmate engaged in and there has to be\nadverse action taken against that plaintiff that would\ndeter a person of ordinary firmness from continuing to\nengage -\nQUESTION: Fine. And the - and the conduct -\nMR. CASEY: But that's -\nQUESTION: - of the prisoner that's retaliation\nis that - that - has to do with that -\nMR. CASEY: No, conduct of the guard.\nQUESTION: - would be his threatening look, but\nnot his insolent look.\nMR. CASEY: If this situation had proceeded\nexactly as petitioner alleges up to the point where they\nwere nose to nose for a few seconds and then they had both\nwalked away, there would be no retaliation claim, there\nwould be no constitutional violation at all. The only\nthing that gives rise to a constitutional right is the\nadverse action of charging him with misconduct. That's\nwhy we say that this charge is necessarily implicated in\nthe hearing process. It necessary - necessarily\nimplicates that his misconduct determination is invalid.\nIf he's right that there should have been no\ncharge at all, if he's right on that, then the Heck v.\nHumphrey analysis doesn't even come into play. We think\nhe's wrong on that. The - the district court felt he was\nright on that and - and ruled against us on our Heck v.\nHumphrey motion. The Sixth Circuit in effect said we were\nright on that, that the nature of this challenge does\nimplicate the hearing process, and under Sixth Circuit\nprecedent, they said, therefore, it falls.\nQUESTION: But the Sixth Circuit was addressing a\ncomplaint that looked like it was attacking the whole\nthing, because it asked for expungement of the\ndisciplinary - of the disciplinary action. Why didn't you\ncall to the - or whoever was representing Michigan at that\nstage - call to the attention of the Sixth Circuit that it\nhad addressed the wrong complaint?\nMR. CASEY: The Sixth Circuit issued its order.\nThe petitioner filed a motion for rehearing. Under the\ncourt rules, we're not permitted to respond to that, but\nour argument is that even though the Sixth Circuit -\nQUESTION: You could have made a motion to remand\nor something.\nMR. CASEY: We could have, but we did not. In\nretrospect, I wish many things had been done differently\nin this case.\nQUESTION: Well, do you aggrieve, looking at the\nSixth Circuit opinion, that it was examining the original\ncomplaint, not the amended complaint?\nMR. CASEY: It referred to the original\ncomplaint, but the - the holding of the Sixth Circuit on\npage 106 of the joint appendix, they say in an earlier\nSixth Circuit case, and they quote it, in order to grant\nthe plaintiff in this case the release he - relief he\nseeks, we would have to unwind the judgment of the state\nagency. That is the basis on which they affirmed the\njudgment.\nQUESTION: I thought you agreed that the Sixth\nCircuit was looking at the initial, original complaint,\nnot the amended.\nMR. CASEY: That they - they mentioned the\ninitial complaint and not the amended complaint. That's\ncorrect.\nQUESTION: Yeah.\nMR. CASEY: But we believe that the rationale\nthat they used, that his challenge did implicate the\nvalidity of his misconduct hearing, is correct on both his\noriginal complaint and his amended complaint.\nQUESTION: May I ask you a hypothetical question?\nAssume we had the case with the same facts except the\nremedy a different - if the, say the prison authorities\nhad said you can't use your television set for 30 days and\nthat was the only remedy and otherwise everything else was\nthe same, and he said it was - they did that in\nretaliation because I exercised my First Amendment rights.\nIf that were the discipline, would Heck v. Humphrey\npreclude relief in this case?\nMR. CASEY: Yes, we believe - that's the question\nthe Court granted cert on. If a punishment affects only\nconditions -\nQUESTION: And that's the one we probably ought\nto hear some argument about.\nMR. CASEY: That's - that's correct. I - I\nagree, Your Honor. We argue that -\nQUESTION: And why would it preclude relief in\nthat case? That's what I'd be interested in hearing.\nMR. CASEY: Because as in the Edwards v. Balisok\nand - and Heck v. Humphrey, the proper method of analysis\nis to look to the most closely analogous common law tort,\nlook to traditions of common law, public policy\nconsiderations in light of the purposes of Section 1983.\nIn Heck v. Humphrey and Edwards v. Balisok, the Court\nsaid, in the prison context - prison disciplinary context,\nthe favorable termination requirement applies. On the\nfacts of those cases, there was good time involved, so\nduration -\nQUESTION: More than the facts of the case, we -\nthe reason we - we - we adopted that common law rule was\nto prevent a collision between 1983 and habeas corpus law\nand prevent 1983 from being used as an end-run around\nhabeas corpus limitations.\nMR. CASEY: Again, on - on the facts of the case,\nthat's - that was the situation presented, because in that\ncase there was a collision between the habeas statutes and\nthe 1983 -\nQUESTION: And that collision was - was in the\nreasoning of the Court. It isn't -\nMR. CASEY: Yes, it was. But additional\nreasoning was based on common law traditions and we argue\nthat that same rationale applies even if good time is not\ninvolved, even if it's just conditions of confinement as\npunishment.\nQUESTION: So that even if setting a - a ruling\nin favor of the plaintiff would not in any way call into\nquestion the prison disciplinary proceeding, it still\nshould - Heck should still apply?\nMR. CASEY: No. If - if the nature of the\nchallenge does not imply that the misconduct determination\nis invalid, then the Heck v. Humphrey analysis doesn't\napply. It's not analogous to the common law tort of\nmalicious prosecution. We don't assert that the favorable\ntermination requirement applies to all conditions cases.\nWe say it only applies when a claim for money damages is\nattempted which - the nature of which necessarily implies\nthat the misconduct hearing is invalid.\nQUESTION: Well, it looked like the Sixth Circuit\nis on the short side of a five-to-one split among the\ncourts of appeals on how Heck v. Humphrey is to be\napplied, that the Sixth Circuit views it differently than\nthe other circuits that have addressed it.\nMR. CASEY: I believe that's correct.\nQUESTION: Do you agree?\nMR. CASEY: I believe that's correct.\nQUESTION: Yeah, based on -\nQUESTION: How - how is -\nQUESTION: - its own Huey decision, and I really\nthought very likely that was why this Court granted cert\nhere, to see whether the Sixth Circuit rule is out of step\nwith what we said in Heck v. Humphrey.\nMR. CASEY: The Sixth Circuit, and all of the\ncourt of appeals' decisions that have attempted to apply\nthe Heck v. Humphrey analysis to conditions cases, are\nnecessarily involved in - in extension of the Heck\nrationale to this other factual context, because Heck and\nEdwards involved good-time losses. I agree that's - we\nassume that's why the Court took the case. When we filed\nour brief in opposition, we suggested that there are these\nalternative reasons why the Court should not grant cert.\nOne of them was the loss - that he did in fact lose good\ntime, but -\nQUESTION: But, of course, that conceivably was\nwaived, because you didn't get into it below. If we - if\nwe disregard that and think that you waived this issue of\ngood-time credits, and if we reach the merits on which I\nassumed we granted the case, then what justifies the Sixth\nCircuit rule? Do you say just because damages potentially\nare at issue that the 1983 claim can't go forward?\nMR. CASEY: A - a claim for damages cannot go\nforward unless there's favorable termination. If his\nclaim was for an injunction changing the hearing\nprocedures somehow, as in Edwards, that type of claim\ncould go forward.\nQUESTION: I don't see the difference in the\nSixth Circuit rule anymore. What - in what respect is it\nin the minority? I thought you were reading now, as I\nheard you, the last or the next to last sentence in the\nopinion -\nMR. CASEY: That's - that's correct.\nQUESTION: - that the Sixth Circuit simply\nthought that if this individual wins, if Mr. Muhammad\nwins, they would have to unwind the entire judgment of the\nhearing, which would include the judgment having to do\nwith insolence.\nMR. CASEY: That's correct.\nQUESTION: And so if that's what they base it on\n-\nMR. CASEY: That's correct.\nQUESTION: - is their rule different from that of\nany other circuit?\nMR. CASEY: The way the Sixth Circuit is\ndifferent from most of the other circuits is that they\napply the Heck v. Humphrey analysis to punishments of\nconditions and not just to punishments affecting the\nduration of confinement.\nQUESTION: What is the condition -\nQUESTION: They meaning the Sixth Circuit?\nMR. CASEY: The Sixth Circuit applies it to\nconditions, punishments, and duration punishments.\nMR. CASEY: What do you mean by a conditions\npunishment?\nQUESTION: The - the punishments that Mr.\nMuhammad received were the loss of good time, confinement\nto administrative segregation, essentially remaining in\nhis cell, plus loss of privileges for 30 days. So only the\nloss of good time affects the duration of his sentence -\nQUESTION: Thus, only the loss of good time could\nhave been challenged in habeas?\nMR. CASEY: Correct.\nQUESTION: And the conditions couldn't have been\nchallenged in habeas?\nMR. CASEY: Correct.\nQUESTION: And that's the distinction -\nMR. CASEY: The distinction in this case -\nQUESTION: - that the other circuits think is\ncrucial?\nMR. CASEY: Correct. In - in conditions\nchallenges, habeas corpus relief is not available, so\nthere will be no other Federal court remedy if a Federal\ncivil rights action is not available.\nQUESTION: And it - it's your position that there\nshould be no remedy whatever for this person?\nMR. CASEY: It's our position that if he is -\nQUESTION: If - if - we're disregarding the good-\ntime credits. That's waived, that's out of here. Let's\njust make that assumption. And you say that he's out of\nluck on pursuing any remedy for anything else?\nMR. CASEY: Prisoners who seek to challenge the\nnature of their complaint seeks to challenge or call into\n- whose challenges necessarily imply that a prison\nmisconduct is invalid, do not have a Federal Civil Rights\nAct cause of action, whether it - whether the punishment -\nQUESTION: And other circuits disagree. They say\nthat in this case it would relate to conditions, and\ntherefore, the 1983 suit could go forward.\nMR. CASEY: Correct.\nQUESTION: That's the difference?\nMR. CASEY: Correct. And the difference was\ncreated because the majority in Heck based much of its\ndecision on a rationale of the common law. A concurring\nopinion in that case, signed by four justices, said, no,\nwe're not going to base it on that rationale because that\nmight mean that there would be no Civil Rights Act remedy\nin any such case. Subsequently, in the Spencer v. Kemna,\none of the judges who - or justices - who had been in the\nmajority changed her mind and is now agreeing with the\nrationale of the concurring opinion in Heck. So that's\nwhy the Sixth Circuit, or that's why the courts of appeals\nare split on this. On the facts of Edwards and Heck it\ninvolved just duration claims, but depending on the\nrationale for the rule, it may or may not apply to\nconditions cases. We say it does apply to conditions cases\nbecause -\nQUESTION: And the condition here - and one thing\nis the abstract level on which you're speaking, the other\nis concretely what this case is about. This case is about\nsix days spent in pre-hearing detention.\nthing that money is sought for. Now, we're told that\ninsolence is bondable, threatening behavior is not. Does\nbondable mean it will be bond? What is the incidence?\nWhat practically is the effect?\nMR. CASEY: Some - some major misconducts are\nmandatory non-bondable. Threatening behavior, the\noriginal charge, was mandatory -\nQUESTION: So insolence is not mandatory. What is\nthe practice in the prison? Is it common to let people -\nMR. CASEY: On - on page 14 of the joint appendix\nwe've quoted from the policy directive, and the standard\nis, if there is a reasonable showing that failure to do so\nwould constitute a threat to the security or good order of\nthe facility, so on a case-by-case basis, a prisoner\ncharged with a bondable major misconduct could be placed\nin pre-hearing detention.\nQUESTION: Well, when you say bondable, I mean,\nyou don't mean if a person posts a bond they're out on the\nstreet?\nMR. CASEY: No, no. That - that's the phrase\nused in these prison directives.\nQUESTION: But that's what this case is about,\nthose six days when he was in administrative detention.\nMR. CASEY: Those are the six days for which he\nis seeking damages.\nQUESTION: And - and do you have, rather than\nbeing in the general prison population, do you have any\nstatistical indication of - on charges of insolence, are\npeople more often than not, or is it rare that they would\nbe in administrative detention awaiting the hearing?\nMR. CASEY: I - I don't have the statistics of -\nthe Department of Corrections probably could compile\nthat, but I don't know. I do know that there were last\nyear more than 72,000 major misconduct hearings of all\nkinds, bondable and non-bondable. I do not know how many\nof those 72,000 resulted in pre-hearing detention.\nQUESTION: But was - was this argument raised\nbelow that there's no cause of action because there's no\nassurance that he wouldn't have been kept for six days\nanyway, even if it was bondable? You - you didn't defend\non that ground, did you?\nMR. CASEY: It was not argued in those terms, no.\nAs I said, the case was argued -\nQUESTION: Why do we want to get into that? I -\nI don't understand.\nMR. CASEY: No. We did not argue the - the terms\nof the bond versus non-bondable, because it simply didn't\ncome up.\nQUESTION: So suppose now - I think Justice\nO'Connor may be causing the light to dawn in my head -\nsuppose you're right, suppose that there is just one ball\nof wax. Suppose the - this is all a waste of time trying\nto separate those two things. There's just one thing.\nThere's a conviction, all right?\nMR. CASEY: Correct.\nQUESTION: Now, we look to see what happens if he\nwins. If he wins, we set aside the whole conviction, but\ngood time is out of it. And since good time is out of it,\nof course he can bring a 1983 action, because this wasn't\nthe kind of thing that habeas was designed for. Habeas\nwas about duration of - of staying in prison, and with\ngood time out of it, it doesn't matter whether it's one\nball of wax or two. He can go in on 1983 since there's no\nconflict with the habeas statute. What's your response to\nthat?\nMR. CASEY: Our response to that in - in - in\nresponse to the question that the Court granted certiorari\non is that even if good time was not at issue in the case,\nif the only punishment he received affected the conditions\nof confinement, our argument is, it's still appropriate to\nlook to the traditions of the common law and public policy\nconsiderations to determine whether a cause of action in\nthose circumstances is cognizable in 1983. We've argued\nthat it is not cognizable. If he is challenging the\nvalidity of his misconduct determination, that's analogous\nto the common law tort of malicious prosecution.\nThe elements of that tort require favorable\ntermination before it can succeed. We believe that - that\nsame element applies in a 1983 case. So if he does not\nget favorable termination of his prison misconduct, he\ncannot bring a suit for damages under 1983.\nQUESTION: It is essential to your argument, is\nit not, that provocation would be a defense?\nMR. CASEY: No.\nQUESTION: No?\nMR. CASEY: Whatever - whatever charge -\nQUESTION: If provocation would - would not be a\ndefense, then even if he establishes provocation, for\nwhich he can get damages, he would not be impairing the\njudgment against him.\nMR. CASEY: One of the elements of the\nconstitutional cause of action for retaliation is adverse\naction against the prisoner because of his protected\nconduct. The adverse action in this case is not the\nstaring down and the nose-to-nose confrontation. The\nadverse action is charging misconduct, and we say, if he's\nright in his complaint that there would not have been a\nmisconduct charge but for this action, that necessarily\nimplies that the misconduct proceeding is invalid, and\nthat triggers the analogy to malicious prosecution and its\nelement of favorable termination.\nQUESTION: So that you say basically, the\nimportance of Heck and Humphrey here is the way it says\nyou ought to refer to common law analogies in analyzing\nwhether there ought to be a 1983 action, and that has\nnothing to do in the final analysis with whether there's a\ncollision between habeas corpus and 1983. That is an -\nthat is an independent requirement of the way you go about\nanalyzing 1983 actions.\nMR. CASEY: Yes, that's correct.\nQUESTION: So that even though there isn't a\nhabeas corpus problem, you still go through the same\nmethodology?\nMR. CASEY: Correct. You say the same\nmethodology applies whether it's just conditions or\nduration of confinement. If it's a -\nQUESTION: Are you essentially making an\nexhaustion of - of state remedies then? It seems to me -\nare you - you're not saying that this person would have\nno complaint, no Federal complaint, not in habeas, not in\n1983? Are you saying that -\nMR. CASEY: Yes.\nQUESTION: - or are you saying 1983 is premature?\nMR. CASEY: If he gets favorable termination. We\nsay -\nQUESTION: Where does he get the favorable\ndetermination?\nMR. CASEY: The - if he got favorable termination\nby review of the misconduct - if he - if he had won at the\nmisconduct or if he had appealed and won on appeal, that\nwould be favorable termination.\nQUESTION: So you're saying essentially he hasn't\nexhausted his internal administrative remedies, and that's\nwhy the 1983 is improper?\nMR. CASEY: We say the - his failure to exhaust\nis another independent reason why he does not have -\nQUESTION: You're saying he has to both exhaust\nand prevail?\nMR. CASEY: That's correct. They're independent\nrequirements.\nQUESTION: And that seems somewhat inconsistent\nwith at least the negative implication of the Federal\nstatute, which says all he has to do is exhaust.\nMR. CASEY: Well, the - the Court addressed that\nquestion in Heck v. Humphrey, and it said that even if a\nperson exhausts his remedies, if he has not favorably\nterminated, he cannot bring the lawsuit unless and until\nhe gets favorable termination. They're - they're\nindependent. The exhaustion requirement -\nQUESTION: Well, that's the Heck v. Humphrey's\ngloss, but that's an additional requirement. Usually\nexhaustion does not require prevailing.\nMR. CASEY: Well, that's correct. That's\ncorrect. The - the reason he has to get favorable\ntermination in this case is because of the analogy to -\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. CASEY: - malicious prosecution.\nQUESTION: Right. It - it usually does not\nrequire prevailing, but it does require prevailing when -\nwhen your cause of action is that - that you have been\nsubjected to the law improperly.\nMR. CASEY: That's correct. That's our argument.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Casey.\nMR. CASEY: Thank you very much.\nQUESTION: Ms. Beckwith, you have 3 minutes\nremaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CORINNE BECKWITH\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMS. BECKWITH: Turning to the actual question\npresented in this case, there is no justification for the\nSixth Circuit's rule extending the Heck favorable\ntermination requirement to prison hearings that don't\ninvolve the fact or duration of custody. Congress could\nhave amended 1983 to say that, but we know from the PLRA\nthey looked at the same considerations, they did something\ndifferent. The Sixth Circuit is an outlier here, as\nJustice O'Connor said, because there's no - there's no\nconflict with habeas in a - in a matter like this.\nAs to all of the other questions that have come\nup during this argument, this case came to this Court in\nthe posture where there were no good-time credits and\nthere was no exhaustion question. Now, we think we can\novercome those problems, but I don't think this Court\nneeds to.\nAnd the - the government has never cited any law\nthat says the guard's retaliatory conduct violating Mr.\nMuhammad's First Amendment rights would have been a\ndefense, and we know of none. They argued that it was -\nit was relevant to credibility. They argued that that was\nsome kind of a but-for relationship, but victory in the\n1983 suit does not affect the adjudication for insolence\nin this claim. All of this only matters if good-time\ncredits are at issue.\nAnd putting all of that aside, we just agree\nwith Justice Breyer that then this is an easy case in our\nfavor. If there are no further questions from the Court,\nwe'd ask that you reverse the Sixth Circuit.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Ms.\nBeckwith. The case is -\n(Whereupon, at 11:59 a.m., the case in the\nabove-entitled matter was submitted.)\n"
