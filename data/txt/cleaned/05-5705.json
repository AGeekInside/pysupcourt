FRIEDMAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe Court can decide these cases, as it\ndecided Crawford without testing the outer bounds of\nthe Confrontation Clause, by adopting a simple\nproposition that is easily understood by and\nintuitively sensible to ordinary lay people and so\ncapable of being passed on from generation to\ngeneration as one of the cornerstones of our\nfundamental liberties.\nA criminal conviction cannot be based on an\naccusation made privately to a known law enforcement\nofficer. If a State wishes that such an accusation\nbe presented in support of a conviction, then it must\nensure that the accuser testifies in the manner long\nrequired by the common law system of criminal justice,\nin the presence of the accused, under oath, and subject\nto cross examination.\nAs in Crawford, the Court does not need to\noffer a comprehensive definition of the term\ntestimonial. It is enough to say that an accusation to\na known law enforcement officer must be testimonial\nunder any plausible definition.\nJUSTICE BREYER: When, for example, there's\nan undercover agent, a law enforcement officer -- let's\nthink of the mafia or the Ku Klux Klan reveals himself.\nOne of the co-conspirators during the ongoing\nconspiracy switches sides. But no. He doesn't switch.\nHe's still in the conspiracy. Makes a whole lot of\nstatements. Those are all inadmissible, though they'd\ncome in now because they would be in the furtherance of\nthe conspiracy.\nMR. FRIEDMAN: Statements in furtherance of a\nconspiracy, if I understand --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes. There -- but there's\n-- in other words, I've got your definition and all\nI've tried to do is create a circumstance where, while\nit fits your definition, it's made by a person that is\nin the conspiracy. So I make him undercover, the law\nenforcement officer.\nMR. FRIEDMAN: If it's an undercover law\nenforcement --\nJUSTICE BREYER: But known.\nMR. FRIEDMAN: By -- by known, I mean to the\ndeclarant.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes.\nMR. FRIEDMAN: By known, I mean to the\ndeclarant. So if it's --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes.\nMR. FRIEDMAN: -- if it's an undercover agent\nand so it's a statement to an undercover --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So you're saying my\nhypothetical could never come up. What I'm trying to\ndo is -- it seems to me that your hypothetical is going\nto take statements that would come in that are pretty\nfar removed from the prosecution that are in odd\ncircumstances, are not just a testimonial at all in\nanybody's thought, but it keeps them out.\nMR. FRIEDMAN: I -- I'm afraid I -- I don't\nfully understand the hypothetical. If the -- if the\nofficer is not known to the declarant as a law\nenforcement officer, then there's no problem. Then --\nthen the statement could --\nJUSTICE BREYER: He's known.\nMR. FRIEDMAN: If he's -- he's known to the\nlaw enforcement officer and the member of the\nconspiracy is making a --\nJUSTICE BREYER: It's continuing.\nMR. FRIEDMAN: It's a continuing conspiracy,\nbut -- but that statement to the law enforcement\nofficer saying that somebody else in the conspiracy has\ncommitted a crime, would not, in fact, be in\nfurtherance of the conspiracy. It would blow the\nconspiracy apart.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. You've convinced\nme I have a bad hypothetical.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: You go ahead.\nMR. FRIEDMAN: I -- I don't think it's --\nYour Honor, I feel duty-bound to say there are no bad\nhypotheticals, but there are -- there are easy ones,\nand I think if -- if it's a known officer -- it's -- in\nthat situation, it's going to be accusatorial. If it's\nnot a known officer, it's -- it's not accusatorial --\nJUSTICE ALITO: What if a statement is made\nto a known law enforcement officer providing\ninformation that's -- that's very incriminating against\nsomebody, but it doesn't specifically identify that\nperson? Does that fall within your test?\nMR. FRIEDMAN: I -- I believe it does. Of\ncourse, in this case we have both, a description of the\ncrime and an identification of the perpetrator.\nJUSTICE ALITO: So it's an accusation even\nthough it doesn't identify the person who is alleged to\nbe the perpetrator?\nMR. FRIEDMAN: We could call it what we will.\nI think -- I think that it still would be within the\nnarrow proposition that we're advocating that a -- that\na description of the crime to a known --\nJUSTICE ALITO: So really, your test is any\nevidence that's -- any statement made to the police or\n-- is an -- is testimony.\nMR. FRIEDMAN: No, Your Honor. I think it --\nit either has to describe a crime or identify the\nperpetrator or, as in this case, do both. So --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Any relevant evidence given\nto law enforcement is testimonial.\nMR. FRIEDMAN: Well, when you say -- when you\nsay relevant, I think that if the law enforcement\nofficer -- if -- if it's a statement to a known law\nenforcement officer in the line of duty, it's -- it's\nalmost always going to be testimonial. If it -- if it\nidentifies the -- the perpetrator or describes the\ncrime, I would say it's clearly testimonial, or if it's\nin response to the -- to the officer's inquiries, it's\nclearly --\nJUSTICE ALITO: If somebody calls and says, I\njust saw a blue Toyota with Ohio plates commit a hit\nand run, that's testimonial?\nMR. FRIEDMAN: I believe -- I believe so.\nNow -- now, in fact, that would provide some\nidentifying information because it is a person who is\nassociated with that blue -- with that blue Toyota.\nBut if it's simply a officer in the donut shop, I just\nsaw Jack, he's back in town, with no clear relation to\nany -- any crime, that's presumably just chatter and\nthat wouldn't be testimonial even if it -- even if it\nlater becomes relevant.\nJUSTICE ALITO: But if it's relevant that\nJack is back in town, then that's testimonial.\nMR. FRIEDMAN: If -- if at the moment that\nit's made, the declarant understands that Jack being\nback in town might be useful in an investigation, or if\na reasonable person in the position of the declarant\nwould understand it, that would be testimonial. Yes.\nYes, Your Honor.\nSo the -- the basic principle for which we're\nadvocating does not lie at the -- outside of the -- of\nthe definition of testimonial. I think it's simply a\ncore proposition.\nJUSTICE ALITO: And the people who are making\nall these statements are -- are to be understood as\nwitnesses against somebody within the -- the language\nof the Confrontation Clause?\nMR. FRIEDMAN: I think within the -- within\nthe meaning of the Confrontation Clause, if those\nstatements are allowed at proof -- as proof at trial\nwithout the person coming in, then what we have\nessentially done is created a system by which people\ncan create evidence for use by the legal system, by\nengaging those statements without coming into court.\nThat's -- that's right.\nAnd so I think one of the critical factors\nhere is to imagine what happens if statements, such as\nthe ones in -- in this case, are admitted -- are\nadmissible, and this Court holds -- holds that they\nare, then basically they always can be admitted. Then\nany State is free to create a system in which a\nstatement to a responding officer comes in as proof.\nThere's no need for the -- for the -- the declarant to\nshow up at trial, and there's no doubt that -- that\nthat is what would happen. California and Oregon have\nalready adopted such statutes, and -- and my State of\nMichigan is on the verge of doing so.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Statutes that -- that say\nwhat?\nMR. FRIEDMAN: That say -- that say\naccusations to a -- made to a law enforcement officer,\nin the case of Oregon and the pending Michigan bill,\naccusations of domestic violence are admissible so long\nas they are made reasonably freshly -- but they give a\n24-hour time frame -- they -- they are admissible. No\nneed for excitement. So -- so the idea that -- that\nthe jurisdictions have limited this to -- to excited\nutterances is -- is not -- is not so. If -- if the\nCourt affirms the decision here, I think the message\nwould go out that these -- that these statutes are\nperfectly okay.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And those -- those --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And -- and what -- what is\nthe theory on which the statutes are -- are adopted?\nMR. FRIEDMAN: The --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: What's the argument that\nthey propose to say it's not testimonial? I know you\ndisagree with it, but --\nMR. FRIEDMAN: Justice Kennedy, the -- I\ndon't think there is a theory. And I say that quite\nseriously. I -- I actually testified last month before\nthe Michigan House on the -- the bill saying I believe\nthis bill is blatantly unconstitutional. I believe\nit's going to be held unconstitutional within a few\nmonths. There was not a high level of interest in the\nconstitutional argument before the legislature. I\ndon't think there is a theory. I think the -- I think\nthe theory is that prosecutors say that these would be\ngood laws to pass. So --\nJUSTICE BREYER: What's -- what's worrying me\non this is -- I'll tell you my concern without the\nhypothetical. Crawford wrenches the Confrontation\nClause free of the hearsay rule, and therefore,\ntestimony -- it might be testimonial even though it is\nnot hearsay or falls within an -- doesn't fall within\nan exception. You understand what I'm saying. Fine.\nNow, you come along with a suggestion, and\nwhat struck me immediately was that, wait a minute,\ncan't I easily think -- apparently not easily -- can't\nI easily think of instances where it would be\ntestimonial but it isn't an accusation made to a\npoliceman. And conversely, can't I easily think -- not\neasily -- of instances where, well, it would have come\nin, but it was statements made to a policeman maybe\nyears before, maybe about this, maybe about that?\nMaybe it's a hospital record. Maybe it's a business\nrecord. There are all kinds of exceptions to the\nhearsay rule, and they don't run parallel to the test\nyou've just given. That's what's worrying me. What's\nthe test?\nMR. FRIEDMAN: Your Honor, let -- let me be\nvery clear. We do not propose that this categorical\nprinciple that an accusation to a law enforcement\nofficer is a definition of what's testimonial. We\nregard this as a core category of testimonial\nstatements such as the core categories that the Court\nlisted in Crawford. So -- so if a statement fits\nwithin that -- within that category, that is sufficient\nto make it testimonial.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Such as in Crawford, but\nin Crawford, it was the kind of formal statement, the\nCourt said, materials such as affidavits, custodial\nexaminations, prior testimony that the defendant was\nunable to cross examine, or similar pretrial\nstatements. Similar pretrial statement is not an\nagitated woman calling 911 or telling a police officer\nwho -- as in your case, who comes in response to a\ncall, there's a disturbance going on in that house, get\nthere.\nMR. FRIEDMAN: Right. I -- I understand,\nJustice Ginsburg. Of course, Crawford was only listing\na non-exclusive list of -- of core -- of core\ncategories.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes. We -- we -- that --\nthat quotation was a -- a description of what Crawford\ndescribed as the core.\nMR. FRIEDMAN: Right.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Not -- not the totality of\n--\nMR. FRIEDMAN: Certainly not the totality,\nand if you say, well, this statement was informal, it\n-- it doesn't make sense and I think it conflicts with\na comment in Crawford in footnote 3 to say, well,\ninformal testimony is -- is okay, as the Court said in\n-- in Crawford. If -- if sworn out-of-court testimony\nis invalid, it wouldn't make sense to say that unsworn\ntestimonial statements are perfectly okay.\nNow, so far as the principle that -- that\nbecause the witness is under agitation, the -- the\nConfrontation Clause doesn't -- doesn't apply, I don't\nthink that's -- that's valid at -- at all. It\ncertainly isn't valid historically. If -- if it were,\nwe would have seen examples over history in which\nagitated declarants -- their statements came in. But\nas -- as General Dreeben has indicated, the very -- the\nvery organizing principle of prosecution was that the\naccuser must come and -- come and testify.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Did the legislatures that\nhave passed laws of the kind you describe have before\nthem information that there is a rather high incidence\nof the victim being intimidated and therefore not\nshowing up in court to testify?\nMR. FRIEDMAN: Your -- Your Honor, in the --\nin the Old Bailey sessions papers there were\napproximately 2 percent of the cases, the victim who\nwas the prosecutor did not show up. It was a recurring\n-- a recurring matter. Why they didn't show up may\nhave been for various reasons. And I want to emphasize\nthat the State in the very first paragraph of its brief\nemphasizes that there are numerous reasons why, in the\ndomestic violence context, the -- the accuser may not\ntestify in court. And in those roughly 2 percent of\nall the cases, which is 2,000 cases, in not a single\none -- well, I'm sorry. There was one in which there\nwas a -- a conviction. That's because -- because the\ndefendant -- because the defendant confessed. But in\nall the others, the accusation was -- the -- the case\nwas summarily dismissed.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you -- you have to\nassume not only that the victim is unwilling or\nreluctant to testify, you have to assume that the\nvictim has disappeared because the victim, unwilling or\nnot, could be subpoenaed. Isn't that right?\nMR. FRIEDMAN: The -- the victim could be\nsubpoenaed, and in -- in this case, as in Davis, the\nvictim was subpoenaed, but subpoenas have to be\nenforced. And -- and I think in some cases the\nprosecution does -- simply doesn't enforce the\nsubpoenas. It's what the Cook County --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Right, but I'm saying the scope\nof the problem is -- is much more narrow than what is\nsuggested by simply describing how often it is that the\n-- that the complaining witness is reluctant to\ntestify. That doesn't stop anything.\nMR. FRIEDMAN: Well --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Reluctant or not, that\nwitness can be -- can be subpoenaed.\nMR. FRIEDMAN: That is -- that is correct,\nJustice Scalia. It is the State's choice whether to\ncompel the -- the person to -- to testify, and if, as\nCook County has done, they put in particular efforts to\nprotect the witness, to encourage her to testify, then\nprosecutors get a very high return. That is, in -- in\nthe Cook County program, 80 percent of -- of the\nwitnesses testify. They get a very high conviction\nrate, and they protect the -- the witnesses.\nSo I think the message from this Court is\ngoing to be one of two things. Either it's okay to\nadopt a California/Oregon type of statute and just --\njust let any statements come -- come in, or we have to\nput in the resources to -- to -- into domestic violence\nto ensure that the witnesses come -- come to court.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I don't know why the or\nwould necessarily follow. I mean, if you prevail,\nthere's nothing that compels the State to put money in\nwhat has been suggested, a training program, shelters,\ncounselors for these people.\nMR. FRIEDMAN: They --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Nothing at all compels the\nState to do that.\nMR. FRIEDMAN: They -- they would not be\ncompelled to do that, but -- they would not be\ncompelled constitutionally to do that. They would\nsimply be deprived of a -- of -- of the so-called\nevidence-based prosecution, which has just been a\nphenomenon of the last 14 years.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Your point, I thought, was\nthat that would be the incentive for --\nMR. FRIEDMAN: That -- that --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- for police departments,\nof course --\nMR. FRIEDMAN: That -- that -- that is\ncorrect.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- if they want to make\ntheir cases.\nMR. FRIEDMAN: That is correct. They -- they\nwould -- they want to make their cases, and -- and I\nthink they can make their cases best if the witness\ntestifies, in which case, under the Confrontation\nClause now -- now construed, there's no objection then\nto bringing in the prior statement at all.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What about present sense\nperceptions? That might be a good one.\nMR. FRIEDMAN: And -- and --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Apparently 803(1) has the\nfirst exception --\nMR. FRIEDMAN: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- to the hearsay rule.\nIt's present sense impression.\nMR. FRIEDMAN: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So on the phone, somebody is\ndescribing very calmly -- very calmly to the policeman\nthe terrible crime that he sees going on in front of\nhim. Now, I gather from the fact that it's an -- that\nit is a exception, that now in the Federal courts that\nwould be admissible.\nMR. FRIEDMAN: Well, it would have been under\nRoberts presumably.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes. No. Forget the --\nyes. Every day of the week, they come in. Is that\nright? Present sense impressions. It's here as the\nfirst exception to the hearsay rule.\nMR. FRIEDMAN: It's -- it's an exception. In\ncivil cases, there's no problem. In -- in criminal\ncases --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, there it is, 803(1).\nMR. FRIEDMAN: That's right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I mean, and you practiced\nthis for years. See. I mean, you're an expert in\nthis, and I -- I think my impression -- just tell me if\nI'm wrong -- is it's 803(1). It says a present sense\nimpression comes in. So I guess it does unless I'm --\nMR. FRIEDMAN: Yes, but until -- until White\nv. Illinois basically let the guard down, these --\nthese statements could not come -- accusatory\nstatements that might have been in present sense\nimpressions did not -- were -- were not the basis for\nprosecutions. Once -- once White v. Illinois was\ndecided, then -- then courts allowed them in routinely.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So if we adopt your rule, a\nperson calls up on the phone and says, I'm here at the\nbaseball game, there's a terrible crime going on in\nfront of me, and he describes it --\nMR. FRIEDMAN: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- to the police officer,\nthat no longer could come in.\nMR. FRIEDMAN: I -- I believe that is correct\nbecause that --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I should hope not. I mean\n--\nMR. FRIEDMAN: It -- it shouldn't. It's an\naccusatory -- it's an accusatory statement to -- to a\n-- a -- to law enforcement.\nNow, I mean, the Court could, if it wanted,\ncarve out or -- or draw the line at statements that are\ndescribing the contemporaneous -- the absolutely\ncontemporaneous commission of a crime. I don't think\nit's a particularly good line to draw.\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, no. I wasn't --\nMR. FRIEDMAN: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- trying to reduct you out\nof --\nMR. FRIEDMAN: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I just wanted to know what\nthe facts are about the rule. I was just -- that's\nwhat I was asking.\nMR. FRIEDMAN: The -- the rule is that the\nhearsay law -- the rule against hearsay provides -- the\nmodern rule against hearsay provides no -- no\nrestriction. The Confrontation Clause should.\nAnd let me address the -- your concern,\nJustice Breyer, that is this hearsay rather than --\nthan confrontation. I think -- I think that the notion\nof the accuser is central to the confrontation right\nand always -- and always has been, and those 2,000\ncases really develop. As of 1791, the rule against\nhearsay was barely developed, and we cite -- or the\n-- the rule against hearsay was barely developed and\nEdmund Burke said that a trained parrot could recite\nall the laws of evidence in 5 minutes, and that is no\nlonger -- that is no longer so.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Edmund Burke say that?\nMR. FRIEDMAN: Edmund Burke said that, yes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Friedman, can I go\nback to your answer that the police will then -- in\nresponse to the position that you're urging, will then\nprotect the victim and all these fine things? It\nwasn't so long ago that the police wouldn't bother with\nthese prosecutions at all. They didn't care about\nthem. And if you say you're going to have to drag in\nthe victim, you're going to have to jail her for\ncontempt if she's so scared that she won't testify,\nthey'll say, who needs it. We've got a lot of other\ncrimes to prosecute.\nMR. FRIEDMAN: Well, I -- I hope not, Your\nHonor, and I -- I believe that we've gotten past the\npoint. I mean, I think we now recognize how serious a\n-- a crime domestic violence is.\nLet me emphasize that it is just as now\nsometimes a prosecutor will compel a victim to\ntestify. It will still be that sometimes they will and\nsometimes they won't. That will be a matter of -- of\nState policy. There are other approaches as -- as\nwell. And -- and hopefully, compulsion isn't\nnecessary, I think, if the prosecutors pay -- pay\nsufficient attention and -- and care, but beyond that,\nthere's the possibility of forfeiture. If, indeed, the\nreason why the victim will not testify is because of\nintimidation, then -- then the prosecution -- it is\nopen to the prosecution to prove that. In many cases,\nthe case can be proven --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: That's very powerfully\nhard to prove, isn't it?\nMR. FRIEDMAN: I don't think so, Your Honor.\nAnd -- and, of course, it remains to be seen just how\neasy or how hard it -- it is to -- to prove. But, in\nfact, the -- as Mr. Fisher said, the rules of evidence\ndon't apply at the -- at the preliminary hearing. It's\nthe judge, not the -- the jury that has to decide. And\nthe standard of proof presumably would not be beyond a\nreasonable doubt. So --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But you are back --\nas Justice Breyer pointed earlier, you're making the\nprosecution prove two crimes instead of one.\nMR. FRIEDMAN: Well, intimidation is -- is a\ncrime, but it wouldn't -- it wouldn't be a full\ncriminal case. It would, as in many other contexts,\nsimply a preliminary hearing on -- on a threshold\nissue. As we have for every evidentiary problem, for\nevery -- for any -- any evidentiary problem, such as\ndoes the present sense impression exception apply,\nthere's a preliminary --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but every\nevidentiary problem, the -- the root of the problem is\nnot the inability of the -- or the unwillingness of the\nprimary victim to testify. I mean, that's what makes\nintimidation so hard to prove in these cases is because\nyou have to get the -- if -- if the intimidation is\nsuccessful, the witness to testify about the -- the\ncrime is unavailable and unwilling to do so.\nMR. FRIEDMAN: Well, it -- it would remain\nfor the Court to determine what the standards are for\nproving --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you wouldn't have to\nprove beyond a reasonable doubt, would you?\nMR. FRIEDMAN: I -- I wouldn't --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: This is -- this\nis a pretrial hearing on whether the -- the -- there's\nbeen intimidation. Couldn't the judge just find it\nmore likely than not that the defendant has intimidated\na witness?\nMR. FRIEDMAN: Prior decisions of the Court\nsuggest that that would most likely be the -- the\nstandard. It may be --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But the -- the judge\ncan't make that finding if the witness doesn't testify,\ncan he?\nMR. FRIEDMAN: Oh, I think that -- that the\njudge may well, and I think it would remain --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How's that? The\nprosecutor goes in and says, we think the defendant has\nintimidated the witness by saying he's not going to\nsupport her financially, he's going to leave, whatever,\nand -- and the -- presumably the -- the defendant says\nno -- no, and the witness isn't there. The judge says,\nwell, I find by a preponderance of the evidence that he\nhas intimidated her?\nMR. FRIEDMAN: I think it remains an open\nquestion what the standards would be for -- for proof\nand whether that would be constitutionally accepted.\nThis, of course, is a matter for -- for another day.\nI think what the Court can't do is\neffectively assume as a -- or create an irrebuttable\npresumption that in all domestic violence cases, the --\nthe victim has been intimidated, which is what the\nState asks, even though they acknowledge at the very\noutset that there are many other reasons why -- why the\nvictim may not testify. The -- there's no domestic\nviolence exception for the confrontation right, just as\nthere's no organized crime exception for the\nconfrontation right.\nSo I do think that -- that what the\nprocedures are for forfeiture is -- is a big open\nquestion. But -- but it's the State's burden to prove\nforfeiture. It -- it can't be assumed as a per se\nmatter.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Do you have a second choice\nrule? I mean, we have Professor Amar, who has pretty\nformal criteria.\nMR. FRIEDMAN: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: We have the rule that you\njust enunciated, and I don't want, before you sit down,\nto -- I want to find out if you have an intermediate\nposition, a fall-back position.\nMR. FRIEDMAN: Well, our -- our narrow rule\nis -- is simply the -- an accusation to a law\nenforcement officer. We -- we, of course, believe that\nthe more general test is reasonable expectation of the\ndeclarant and that's where -- where I disagree with --\nwith Professor Amar. I don't know that he would -- I\ndon't know that he would disagree. I'd be surprised if\nhe would disagree that an accusation to a law\nenforcement officer is -- is testimonial because --\nbecause that is such a -- a narrow principle. Now --\nnow, he does speak about -- about formality, but\nformality, for reasons I suggested, I don't think -- I\ndon't think makes an awful lot of sense because it then\ngives the police officers and prosecutors an incentive\nto take testimony informally.\nAnd what we have then, as in this case, we\nhave not the affidavit, which -- which the State is\ncondemning as admissible. They now concede that that's\ninadmissible. The evidence on which this prosecution\nis based is a police officer's rendition of what he was\ntold orally, which is a denigrated form of -- form of\nevidence. That's where a formality rule will -- will\nget you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Where -- where do you\ncome out on the person running out of the house and\nyelling to her neighbor with the law enforcement\nofficer standing by?\nMR. FRIEDMAN: And -- and --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's not -- the\nstatement is not to the law enforcement officer, but he\nor she overhears it.\nMR. FRIEDMAN: If -- if the -- if the speaker\nknows that the law enforcement officer is there --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Doesn't.\nMR. FRIEDMAN: -- then -- then I -- then --\nthen it's not within the narrow categorical rule for which\nwe're -- we're asking now. It may come within the\ngeneral test of reasonable expectation.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is anybody -- is\nanybody working for the State a law enforcement\nofficer?\nMR. FRIEDMAN: No, not -- not within the --\nwithin the narrow categorical rule that we're asking.\nI think it's another question if, say, you're speaking\nto a -- a doctor who's an employee of the State\nhospital --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Or a 911 operator who was an\nagent of -- of the police.\nMR. FRIEDMAN: A 911 operator is a direct\nconduit to the police, and the police are a direct\nconduit to the court.\nAnd -- and that addresses your hypothetical,\nJustice Scalia, about the -- the affidavit right to the\ncourt. The person writes an affidavit right to the\ncourt. Under -- under the theory presented by the\nState under the resemblance theory -- let's take away\nthe -- the sworn part of the affidavit. It's just a\nletter or -- or a message over the Internet or a\nvideotape. All of those would be allowed because\nthere's no formality, because there's no interrogation,\nand that's a grotesque result --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm not sure what -- what\nsense it makes. Two cases. The woman runs out and --\nand says, he -- he stabbed me and I'm dying, he's a\nmurderer. Case one, it's a -- a neighbor. Case two,\nit's a police officer and she sees that he's a police\nofficer. Why -- why should there be a difference? It\ndoesn't make any sense to me.\nMR. FRIEDMAN: Well, I'm -- I'm not saying\nthere necessarily should be a difference. I think -- I\nthink in the --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I thought your test\nwas if she knows that he's a police officer, it's\ntestimonial.\nMR. FRIEDMAN: We're saying that is an easy\ncase. That's what Professor Mosteller called a dead\nbang case where it's made to a police officer.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, let me put it this\nway. I don't know why one case is so easier than the\nother.\nMR. FRIEDMAN: I think it's an easier case\nbecause the police officer is a direct conduit to the\n-- to the machinery of -- of justice. When you're\nspeaking to a police officer, you know you're speaking\nto the State.\nIf the Court has no further questions, I'll\nreserve the balance of my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Fisher.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS M. FISHER\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. FISHER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nAmy Hammon's oral statements to Officer\nMooney arose in an emergency situation very similar to\na 911 call, not in a situation where a detective was\nattempting to subvert the judicial system by developing\nevidence in secret with no intention of ever letting\nthe witness testify at trial.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: She's sitting down at -- at\na table, as I recall it, with the -- with the police\nofficer on the other side of the table.\nMR. FISHER: She may -- yes, I think.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Has a cup of coffee.\nMR. FISHER: Well, I don't know about that.\nShe was in the living room.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I thought there was a cup of\ncoffee, too. Maybe -- I don't know where I got that\nfrom. Maybe I made it up.\nMR. FISHER: Well, what we know is that the\n--\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It didn't seem to me a\nterribly emergency situation in -- in that kind of a\ncontext.\nMR. FISHER: I respectfully disagree, Your\nHonor. We're talking about a woman who has -- has\nstated that she has suffered a beating from her\nhusband, that -- a beating that may flare up at any\ntime if the officers withdraw, and the officer needs to\nknow what happened so that he can properly address the\nsituation.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: At the time, the officer is\nright there in the house. There's certainly no\nemergency at the time. Now, you could say that -- that\nthe woman is frightened about a recurrence, but if --\nif that's your definition of an emergency, it's going\nto cover an awful lot of situations.\nMR. FISHER: Well, I think it's -- the -- the\nmoment to consider is not just the moment when the\nofficers are present, but in fact, what would happen if\nthe officers were to do nothing, which is one of the\nchoices that, I suppose, the officers had. They could\nfind out what was going on and address the situation,\nor they could withdraw, doing nothing, and then leave\nAmy Hammon to her own devices in a highly explosive\nsituation.\nThey -- we don't know exactly what -- what\nOfficer Mooney said when he went back into the living\nroom, but what we know is that there was no apparent\ninterrogation of any type. We know that Amy Hammon at\nthat point told him the story of the argument that had\ntaken place and the resulting physical abuse.\nNow, what we know from -- from the accusation\ntest that is put forth by -- by the petitioner is\nthat the reason that it doesn't apply apparently to all\nstatements to -- to police officers is that it must\nsomehow take account of the co-conspirator statement.\nBut we don't otherwise have any grounding of that test\nin the history of the Confrontation Clause.\nThe test that we are proposing, the broader\ntest that we are proposing, the resemblance test, flows\ndirectly from statements in Crawford suggesting\nthat the way that we know what is testimonial and what\nis not is by examining the lessons of history. What\nwe're proposing is that in any particular context, if\nthe statement resembles one of those historical abuses\nin the civil law tradition, then in that circumstance\nit's testimonial. But if the --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Isn't -- isn't the problem,\nthough -- I mean, as Crawford said, those examples\ndefined the core. They were the paradigms, but they\ndidn't purport to cover the whole ground. And it seems\nto me that your argument is to turn the core into the\nexclusive examples, in which case the Confrontation\nClause in the real world is never going to apply.\nMR. FISHER: Your Honor, I think the\nimportant lesson from Crawford in that regard is -- is\nthe methodology, and the methodology was let's look at\nhistory. What does history tell us the Founders were\nconcerned about? And the Court listed the specific\nexamples of affidavits, depositions, pretrial hearings,\nand -- and expanded that even to include interrogation.\nAnd in -- excuse me -- particular cases coming --\ncoming up, if there is evidence that -- that the\nstatements do correspond to historical abuses, even if\nthose abuses were not listed in Crawford, then that\nwould be a different situation. That would be testimonial.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I'm not sure that that\nwas the only concern of the Founders, I mean, the --\nthe -- you know, the -- the fact that -- that the State\ncould corrupt the -- the statement through the\ninterrogation. I'm not sure that was the only concern.\nI -- I think the Founders believed in a judicial\nsystem, at least in criminal cases, where the person\nhas a right to cross examine his accuser. Whether the\nfact that the -- I am -- I'll put it this way.\nI am quite sure that it would have been held\na violation of the Confrontation Clause if, as the\nprior example I gave, someone wrote out an affidavit\nand sent it directly to the court, no intervening\npolice interrogation at all, just wrote out an\naffidavit from -- from France, mailed it to the court,\nand the court has this affidavit. I am sure that would\nbe a smack-bang violation of the Confrontation Clause.\nAnd there's none of the -- the abuse that -- on -- on\nwhich you -- you would hinge the entirety of the\nviolation.\nMR. FISHER: Well, except that we do know\nthat -- that affidavits, I agree, would have been\nprohibited, and that's one of the classic forms of\ntestimony, indeed, that was enumerated in Crawford and\nthat was kept out at the founding. And that falls into\na very well-defined category.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But one of the reasons for\nthat is -- let's assume you had a completely honest\npolice officer. You may have a motive on the part of\nthe witness to frame the defendant. I mean, that's\nanother reason.\nMR. FISHER: Well, I think it ostensibly\ncould be. I think what we know, though, looking back\nat what -- at the -- at the Raleigh trial and at -- at\nthe -- at the trials even in the colonial period, was\nthat the Founders were concerned about abuses by the\nState, in -- in particular, in interrogations and in\neliciting these affidavits and in using pretrial\ntestimony.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But I'm suggesting to you\nthat it often happens that there are false charges made\nthat the -- that the police believe to be true.\nMR. FISHER: The false charges scenario is --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And this is fully\nconsistent with prohibiting testimonial statements.\nMR. FISHER: Again, I think what Crawford was\ntalking about, in terms of trying to understand the\nConfrontation Clause, was not simply to hypothesize\nvarious problems that different types of evidence could\npresent if it weren't cross examined, but instead to\nexamine more particularly what the Founders were\nconcerned about. And that was not one of the -- of the\ncategories simply --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this, Mr. Fisher?\nWhat is your answer to Justice Scalia's hypothetical,\nan entirely volunteered affidavit by the accuser? Is\nthat admissible or not?\nMR. FISHER: I think that -- well, certainly\nit's testimonial, and so --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: So that would be prohibited\nby the Confrontation Clause. Yet, that was clearly not\nan example that would fall within the Marian practice.\nMR. FISHER: Well, whether it would have come\nin --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I mean, it doesn't resemble\nit is what I'm saying.\nMR. FISHER: Whether it would have been a\nproblem under the Marian practice I think is only part\nof the story. And certainly Crawford recognized that\naffidavits as a category were part of the -- of the\ntradition that led to the abuses that the Founders were\nconcerned about. So Marian is, again, part of the\nstory but not necessarily the whole thing.\nNow, when we articulate this resemblance --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Before you leave that,\nsurely the affidavit isn't -- isn't what's magical. I\nmean, I'm going to change my hypothetical. The person\nrecites his accusation on a tape recorder and mails the\ntape to the court. Now, are you going to say, well,\nit's not an affidavit? You'd exclude that as well,\nwouldn't you?\nMR. FISHER: Well, I -- I don't know that I\nwould because, again, you've got the -- you've got the\nform that Crawford was concerned about. The affidavit\nis the classic form.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That would make no sense at\nall. I mean, that -- that is just the worst sort of\nformalism. If you do it in an affidavit, it's -- it's\nbad, but if you put it on a tape, it's -- it's good. I\n-- I cannot understand any reason for that.\nMR. FISHER: Well, I don't know that the\nanalysis has to end there. I think, for example, there\nwere other circumstances where other types of\ncommunications were problematic. In -- in Raleigh's\ntrial, for example, Cobham had submitted a letter, and\nthat was recited as part of the -- the concern. Now,\nif the Court were to determine that a recording of that\nsort was similar enough, it resembled enough that sort\nof abuse, then yes, it could be testimonial.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Fisher, let me again be\nsure I understand your position. Would the unsworn\nletter that Justice Scalia describes be admissible or\ninadmissible under your view?\nMR. FISHER: I think that there is evidence\nhistorically that a letter would be testimonial,\ncertainly coming out of Cobham's case and -- and other\ncircumstances.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: So then you don't rely on\nthe affidavit point.\nMR. FISHER: Well, I think it's -- it's a\nmatter of what -- what is covered, what is mentioned in\nhistory. Affidavit is one of those -- those\ncategories. Letters, in particular, in Raleigh's trial\nwas another area that may have been problematic. And I\nthink --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: If that's your criterion,\nare you going to draw the distinction between the\nletter and the tape recording?\nMR. FISHER: Well, I think that that is the\n-- whether we have the resemblance test doesn't require\nus to answer that question because I think that the\nexamination the Court would undertake would again --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, let's answer it. Is\n-- is the tape recording like the letter so that it --\nit's inadmissible?\nMR. FISHER: I think it's -- I think it is\nvery similar to the letter and -- and could well be\ninadmissible, but I don't know that it's -- if the\nCourt adheres to the test that it set forth in\nCrawford, that it's looking for forms of testimony that\nwere prohibited at common law, certainly that would not\nhave been one of them.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: A videotape -- a\nvideotape of a crime scene is admissible. Right?\nMR. FISHER: I think that's -- that's right.\nNow, if it's -- if you have a videotape of someone\nthat -- that's responding to an interrogation, that's\nan entirely different thing.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No.\nMR. FISHER: But a videotape of a crime scene\nagain would be -- would be not testimonial.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But a tape recording\nby the same person who videotaped the crime scene,\ndescribing what he saw, you agree would be excluded.\nMR. FISHER: I think that there's a high\nchance that could be -- be excluded.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So what's the test?\nMR. FISHER: It's the resemblance test, and\nthe question --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Resemblance to?\nMR. FISHER: To the historical abuses that\nthe Founders were trying to address. And the --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Which were?\nMR. FISHER: Well, which were in particular,\nwe know, affidavits. We also know something about\nletters, and the question with the tape recording is,\nis it enough like, does it resemble those enough?\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Do you accept the\nGovernment's --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I think the problem with\nthe examples is that none of these are abuses. As I\nsee it, the examples of the tape recording mailed in\nand the volunteer statement, I don't see how you can\ncall those abuses.\nMR. FISHER: Well, I think the abuse comes\nnot simply in how they were created, but -- but then in\nhow they were later used. And -- and again, we're\ntalking about trying to -- to craft a rule in part that\nhas some bright lines to it based on -- on just what\nwas -- what forms were not used --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Why isn't the -- the\nbright line that the Government asserts that this is a\ncrime made in an urgent situation, when one doesn't --\nthe declarant doesn't think rationally will this be\nused eventually in a trial, where the declarant wants\nto stop an imminent threat?\nMR. FISHER: I certainly think that that\nfollows from the -- the overall test we propose.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But that's a different\ntest than the resemblance test that you're proposing.\nMR. FISHER: Our position is it's a corollary\nto it. And certainly it's a narrower test and applies,\nI think, here in -- in both cases to that, and it\nprovides the opportunity resolve both cases on the\nnotion that when the officers were at the scene, they\nwere in no way behaving like inquisitors. They showed\nup. They were -- they could -- they were in the middle\nof -- of an abusive situation that could explode at any\ntime, and they needed to know what -- what was going on\nin order to diffuse the situation. So this case could\nbe resolved on that -- on a much narrower ground.\nIt's -- it's important here also to -- to\nrecognize that what the -- what the prosecution did has\nno -- no similarity to what would happen at the common\nlaw. We have here the government issuing a subpoena to\nAmy Hammon to come and testify and, obviously, showing\nthat they would have preferred the live testimony in\nthis case.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Was there -- was there any\nshowing at all of whether they made the police -- or\nthe prosecutor made any effort to enforce the subpoena?\nMR. FISHER: There was no such effort, Your\nHonor. But, well, here, if I may be permitted to go\nbeyond the record just a little bit, what we -- what we\ndo know is that the case was continued one time because\nAmy Hammon did not show up in response to a subpoena,\nand that the second time, the -- the trial proceeded.\nBut there was no effort to send someone out to -- to\nenforce it or to bring any sort of contempt sanction.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, let's assume your --\nyou have here a woman who's sitting down in the kitchen\nwith the police officer, talks to the police officer,\nand then signs an affidavit. Did she sign the\naffidavit at that time?\nMR. FISHER: That's right, yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And that affidavit was not\nadmissible because it's an affidavit.\nMR. FISHER: Correct.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But the police officer who\ntestified to what she said and what he wrote down in\nthe affidavit that she signed, that does get in.\nMR. FISHER: Correct.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I -- I can't see why that\nmakes any sense at all. I mean, she -- she was either\ntestifying when she spoke and then signed the\naffidavit, as evidence of her testimony, or -- or else\nshe wasn't testifying, in which case both the affidavit\nand the oral statement should be in. I can't -- I\ncan't see drawing the line between those two. It\nreally seems very strange to me.\nMR. FISHER: Well, I think whether you look\nat it from her perspective or from the officer's\nperspective, that something did change in the moment\nbetween the oral statement and the affidavit.\nIf you look at it from -- from the officer's\nperspective, once Amy Hammon disclosed to him what had\nhappened and -- and gave him information that he needed\nto handle the situation, then he could go about\nhandling the situation. He didn't need the affidavit\nto do that. Once he turned to get the affidavit, he --\nhe was transitioning to -- less from an emergency mode\nand more to an evidence-gathering mode.\nIf you're -- if you are looking at it from\nthe standpoint of Amy Hammon, then at that point, when\n-- when Officer Mooney is -- is in the house and has\nher husband, you know, in another room and she's trying\nto just describe what's going on so that she can be\nprotected, that's a far different mind set.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but it's a --\nit's a classic mixed motive case. We don't know when\nthe officer is sitting down with her and asking the\nquestions, whether his primary motive is to make sure\nthe guy doesn't come back or if his primary motive is\nto help make the case against the guy. It's both.\nMR. FISHER: Well, I think it's reasonable to\nassume that officers, faced with an emergency\nsituation, are primarily going to be working for --\nfrom a concern of safety, for their own and for others.\nAnd so even if it is a mixed motive, I think that the\npoint is that particular circumstance, it's reasonable\nto infer where there's an emergency -- ongoing\nemergency, an ongoing immediate safety concern, that\nsafety and security are going to be the primary motive.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why does his motive matter?\nI mean, the -- the issue is whether she is testifying,\nwhether she is a witness, and I don't see how that\nchanges when she tells him these things orally and when\nshe signs the affidavit afterwards. It seems to me\nshe's testifying as to what events had occurred.\nMR. FISHER: Well, let me be clear that we're\nnot suggesting a subjective inquiry into the officer's\nmotive, but what we are saying is that whether a\nstatement is testimonial depends on whether the\ngovernment is -- is purely collecting evidence, making\nsomeone undergo an interrogation, for example, or\nwhether they are performing tasks that really were not\npart of -- of any type of police function at the\nfounding, which is sort of a community caretaking,\npublic safety function, so that by definition in\neliciting statements concerning the immediate safety\nissue, the police officer could not have been engaged\nin the kinds of abuses that gave rise --\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. This is helpful,\nvery helpful to me, but I'm trying to see what you're\ndriving at. I'm imagining the woman saying, he's\nhitting me, he's just hit me. She's in tears. That's\nexcited utterance. Not. Then suddenly the officer, 5\nminutes later, says I've heard what you said. Let's\nreduce it to writing. Here's the formal affidavit, et\ncetera, that is -- but to prevent Mr. Friedman's\nproblem, we're going to have to say as to the second,\nthat is even if you don't have the formality, you see,\neverything is the same, but not the formality. Now,\nhow do we do that?\nMR. FISHER: I'm not sure if I'm following.\nNot formality --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I'm making the distinction\nyou're making between she's in tears, excited utterance\nor res gestae, around there, just what you were talking\nabout. Now think of the second affidavit -- when he\nreduces it to writing. That's different, calmer,\nclearly motive to testify, et cetera. Fine. But now\nwhat Mr. Friedman pointed out is if we make it turn\nsolely on the formality, the piece of paper, the stamp,\net cetera, they'll just avoid that. So we're going to\nhave to sweep into the second the circumstance where\neverything is the same but the formality, and that's\nwhere I have the difficulty.\nMR. FISHER: Well, again, the -- the\ndifficult task of understanding the Confrontation\nClause is to figure out what limits there might be, and\n-- and in Crawford, the methodology was what does\nhistory tell us the Framers were concerned about. And\ncertainly the formal affidavit was something that they\nwere very concerned about. The less formal forms they\nwere not.\nAnd certainly when it comes to something as\n-- as recent, you know, relatively speaking, as -- as\nthe community caretaking function of the police, that\nwas in no way part of -- of the abuses that the Framers\nwere concerned about. And so I think even if the Court\nwere to limit its decision to that part of the test,\nresolving the other instances, according to the\nresemblance test or -- or trying to figure out where to\ndraw that -- you know, that line, could come later,\nconsistent with its decision in this case.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But your answer, I take it,\nassumes that the Framers had no concern with the\ncapacity of the court to test the -- the validity or\nthe truth of the statement.\nMR. FISHER: Well, I'm not entirely sure if\nthat's the case. I mean, I -- of course, they were\noperating in a -- in a circumstance where -- where\nhearsay rules were -- were part of trial process.\nCertainly also, to the extent that -- that a particular\nprocedure is -- is outrageous, the -- a due process\nconcern might arise, but --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, but -- no. But I'm --\nI'm not talking about outrageous circumstances in which\nthe -- the statement was taken. I'm talking about the\ncapacity of the court, by whatever means, to test the\ntruth of that statement once it is placed before the\ncourt. And I understood your argument to Justice\nBreyer to assume that that testing function was not\nwithin the contemplation of the Framers.\nMR. FISHER: I think it was with respect to\n-- to the abuses that -- testimony elicited through the\nabuses that gave rise to the clause, the -- the common\n-- or I'm sorry -- the civil law type abuses. They did\nwant to test that, but the concern --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So that your -- your -- you\nwould then say they want a -- they want to test certain\n-- in certain cases where they think there may have\nbeen an abuse in the elicitation of the statement, but\nif there is -- there is no reason to suspect that the\nstatement was taken under untoward circumstances, they\nwere not concerned to test its validity.\nMR. FISHER: I think that -- that that's\nlargely accurate, but they were dealing with, I think,\na rather set form.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But is that your position?\nMR. FISHER: Well, yes, but -- but if I may\nadd a clarification, which is to say, the reason I\nthink that we could circumscribe affidavits, regardless\nof whether the elicitation abuses are present, is\nsimply for ease of administration, that abuses known to\nthe Framers would have been arising in a circumstance\nwhere there would have been those abuses, and -- and as\na form --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Don't -- don't you think the\nFramers were aware of the fact that although there were\nlaw enforcement abuses, Raleigh's case and so on, there\nwere also abuses every day of the week on the part of\npeople who gave false testimony because they had\ngrudges against the defendant? Do you think that was\ntotally out of the minds of the Framers so as to\nsupport the distinction that -- that as a general rule\nyou were suggesting?\nMR. FISHER: We don't know exactly all of the\ndetails that would have -- that they were\ncontemplating.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But why would -- why would\nwe impute that -- that unconcern to the Framers about\nthe -- the need to test statements which may very well\nhave -- have been given because of envy, grudge, and so\non?\nMR. FISHER: Because of -- of what we do know\nand what Crawford said that we do know, which is that\nwe know that they were responding to things like\nRaleigh's trial and to Stamp Act, you know,\nenforcement, other --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, but doesn't -- doesn't\nthat get us back to the fact that those examples were\ngiven in Crawford as paradigm examples, if, you know,\nthose were -- I think the word poor was used. But --\nbut Crawford was not limited to that, and if it's not\nlimited to that, why, in effect, does the -- does the\n-- should we conclude that the concern of the clause\nstops short of the self-interested witness even though\nhe didn't make an affidavit?\nMR. FISHER: Again, if I may be permitted to\nfinish. The methodology -- the methodology of Crawford\nis to look for known circumstances of abuse, about\nwhich the Framers were concerned, and we don't have\nthat sort of historical evidence more generally.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Gornstein.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF IRVING L. GORNSTEIN\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,\nAS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENT\nMR. GORNSTEIN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nWe are asking the Court to apply the same\nstandard to statements made to officers at the scene as\nto statements made during a 911 call. If the statement\nis made in response to police questions that are\nreasonably necessary to determine whether an emergency\nexists --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask, under your view,\nwas the affidavit admissible?\nMR. GORNSTEIN: The affidavit is not\nadmissible.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Why not?\nMR. GORNSTEIN: The affidavit is -- is not\nadmissible because, by that point, the officer had the\ninformation that he needed to resolve the emergency,\nand what he was soliciting at that point --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I would suggest the reason\nit was not admissible is it's very clear that the\naffidavit is the testimonial statement by a witness\nthat the defendant had a right to confront. The\nconstitutional right is the right to confront the\nwitnesses against him.\nMR. GORNSTEIN: I was just getting to that,\nJustice Stevens --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Oh.\nMR. GORNSTEIN: -- that the -- the emergency\nwas resolved, and at that point, he was --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But you say if the officer\nindependently repeats what is said in the affidavit,\nthen he's the witness against rather than the --\nMR. GORNSTEIN: No, not -- no. He's -- he's\nnot -- if he was repeating what was said in the\naffidavit, that's a different point. He's repeating\nthe statement that was made before the affidavit was\ngiven. That was at a point at which the -- there was\nstill an immediate danger and that he was asking a\nquestion that was reasonably necessary to determine\nwhether that danger existed and, if so, how to resolve\nit.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What was the immediate\ndanger?\nMR. GORNSTEIN: When -- the immediate danger\nwas --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, there's the\npoliceman in the room across the kitchen table from --\nfrom the woman.\nMR. GORNSTEIN: The --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: He's not on the end of a\nphone line. He's in the room across the kitchen table.\nMR. GORNSTEIN: That's correct. And -- and\nthe problem here is what the danger was what would\nhappen if the officers left. When -- when the officer\ncame in and saw a frightened Ms. Hammon, he saw\nwreckage on the floor, he had reason to be concerned\nthat there was a very recent attack on her and that if\nhe left the scene, that attack would be renewed.\nAsking Ms. Hammon what happened was reasonably\nnecessary to determine whether that emergency existed\nand, if so, how to resolve it.\nNow, once he had that information, he had\nwhat he needed to resolve the emergency, and at that --\nJUSTICE ALITO: In a situation like that,\nwhat was needed to resolve the situation, if he\nbelieved what Mrs. Hammon said, was to arrest Mr.\nHammon. Right?\nMR. GORNSTEIN: That's correct.\nJUSTICE ALITO: So he could -- you think he\ncould gather as much evidence as was necessary to\narrest Mr. Hammon.\nMR. GORNSTEIN: I do not. At some --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Why -- why not? Why doesn't\nthat follow?\nMR. GORNSTEIN: Well, at some point, what --\nwhat turns into emergency resolution moves over into\ninterrogation, and once you reach interrogation, then\nyou have reached the core of what Crawford talks about\n--\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: How do we know when that\nline is crossed? You said reasonably necessary to\nprotect safety. That's okay. Interrogation is not\ngood. But how -- how does one tell when one stops and\nthe other starts?\nMR. GORNSTEIN: I -- I think this is going to\nbe a line-drawing question, but when you have a\nsituation like this one where you have an officer who's\njust on the scene in the immediate wake of a -- of a\ndomestic dispute, he asks a single question, what\nhappened, in -- in circumstances in which he needed to\nknow the answer to that question to make sure he could\nleave and leave her there safely. That's not\ninterrogation. If he sat around for a half hour with a\nback-and-forth and give-and-take and trying to press\nand get to the situation in that kind of back-and-\nforth, that would be interrogation colloquially. And\nit's -- it's that kind of line that the Court is going\nto need to draw.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Why? Because he might be\ninterrogating with no idea at all primarily in his mind\nof later court appearance. He wants to find out if\nthere are guns in the house. He wants to find out if\nthere are other people in the house. He wants to find\nout if somebody is being held captive. He wants to\nfind out if these are the same people who did some\nother crime that's immediately taking place, what's the\nrelationship. There are all kinds of interrogation.\nYou're saying that all that interrogation by a\npoliceman can't come in under the Confrontation Clause.\nMR. GORNSTEIN: The Confrontation Clause bars\nunder Crawford police interrogation. And the -- the\nsituation is one in which we are not going to be able\nto examine the individual motives of officers in every\ncase and individual declarants in every case.\nWhat we are looking for is a categorical rule\nthat is going to capture the likely motivations in both\ncases, and when you have emergency question, you're\nlikely dealing with the situation with -- both from the\nofficer's side and from the declarant's side, you're\ngoing to be having people attempting to resolve an\nimmediate danger of harm. And you get --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That -- that assumes -- this\n-- your -- your focus on whether the -- you know, the\n-- it's an interrogation or not -- it -- it assumes\nthat the only focus of the Confrontation Clause is on\nprosecutorial abuse somehow. And -- and as -- as\nJustice Souter was suggesting, I don't think that was\nthe exclusive --\nMR. GORNSTEIN: No, we don't -- we don't\nthink that's the exclusive focus either, and we think\ninterrogation can capture both, too, that when you get\nto the point of interrogation, what's happening with\nthe witness is getting an increasing understanding that\nwhat this is being sought for is to build a case.\nI think the biggest problem with the -- the\ntwo rules that are proposed on the other side, that is,\nthe accusation rule and the reasonable anticipation\nrule, is it captures within a -- these emergency\nstatements that really don't have -- fall within any\nordinary understanding of what testimony is. If I go\nto my house and it's late at night, I hear suspicious\nnoises, and I see somebody and get a partial\ndescription of him, and I call 911, I'm seeking to\navert an immediate danger to myself. I don't think\nunder any stretch of the imagination anybody would\nrefer to that as testimony. Yet, under his rule --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Of course, the Sixth\nAmendment doesn't use the word testimony, does it?\nMR. GORNSTEIN: No, it does not. But what\nthe Court said in Crawford was that the term witness\nwas referring to -- that people can make testimonial\nstatements --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And maybe that -- and\nmaybe you're not a witness when you make the call, but\nwhen that same call is admitted into court, then --\nthen it strikes me that you are a witness.\nMR. GORNSTEIN: But -- but that's not the\ndefinition of witness that -- that Crawford adopted.\nThat would be --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: As it happens in the other\n-- in the companion case today, the prosecution itself,\nin its summation to the jury, referred to the 911 call\nand said, you have heard the testimony of -- of the\nvictim and referred to it as testimony.\nMR. GORNSTEIN: Justice Scalia, if he --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, it's not beyond the\npale to consider this testimony.\nMR. GORNSTEIN: -- if -- if he -- he had made\na statement about a co-conspirator's statement during\nthe course of the conspiracy and he had said, we have\nhere the testimony of the -- his co-conspirator, that\nwould not make it testimony. And if the -- the 911\ncall --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No, but it would prove that\n-- that it's not beyond the pale to call it testimony.\nMR. GORNSTEIN: Well, it just does not make\nit testimony. And if it -- the prosecutor in the 911\ncase had said, I don't have her testimony, I have\nsomething better, it's a 911 call --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Gornstein?\nMR. GORNSTEIN: -- of a cry for help, that\nwouldn't make it not testimony. And I don't think --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Gornstein, is this a\nfair summary of your position, if I may? We're really\nasking who's the witness that's being testified\nagainst, and when it's the affidavit, it's clearly the\nwoman that's a witness there where it's inadmissible.\nBut your view, as I understand you, is when it's the\nofficer who is the witness, he's subject to cross\nexamination, and as long as the emergency continues and\nhe's describing what happened during the emergency,\nhe's still the witness. That's what you're saying, I\nthink.\nMR. GORNSTEIN: He's -- he's still a --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: He's still the witness\nwe're concerned about.\nMR. GORNSTEIN: He is the witness --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Therefore, he's subject to\ncross examination.\nMR. GORNSTEIN: He's the -- he's the -- he is\nsubject to cross examination.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And so during the emergency\nperiod, he can repeat what she said.\nMR. GORNSTEIN: But I -- what I'm saying is\nthat she's not a witness during the emergency period\nitself.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I understand what you're\nsaying.\nMR. GORNSTEIN: It has to be both.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: That we focus not on\nwhether it's testimony but whether he's the witness at\nthe critical time or whether she's the witness.\nMR. GORNSTEIN: I -- I think that that's one\nway of looking at it, Justice Stevens, but --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's not the way\nthe Court looked at it in Crawford.\nMR. GORNSTEIN: No. I -- I think that what\nyou would look to see is if, at the relevant time, that\n-- that the declarant was acting as a witness. And at\nthe relevant time, when somebody is answering a\nquestion to avert an immediate danger, they're not\nacting as a witness. They're not making a solemn\ndeclaration for the purpose of proving facts to support\na prosecution, and so they're not acting as a witness\nin those circumstances.\nAnd -- and it's only later, when the officer\nturns to soliciting from Ms. Hammon an affidavit, that\nwhat he's soliciting at that point is a solemn\ndeclaration made for the purpose of proving facts to\nsupport a prosecution. Now, that's testimony.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I'm not sure that the two\nwere -- were as separated as you -- as you claim. I --\nI took it that the affidavit -- while he was getting\nthe oral responses, he was writing down what -- what\nwould be put in the affidavit.\nMR. GORNSTEIN: I don't think that there's\nany evidence in the record to support that, Justice\nScalia. That -- that -- what happened is that he took\n-- that he listened to her oral statement and then he\nproceeded to ask for -- her for an affidavit, after he\nhad the information that he needed to resolve the\nemergency, was to figure out how he was going to\nprotect this person from an immediate renewed attack if\nhe left the scene.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But under your test, the\nwhole question is whether the emergency continued at\nthe time the witness' words are being repeated.\nMR. GORNSTEIN: It's not the whole question\nbecause if the statement -- the question has nothing to\ndo with and the answer had nothing to do with the\nemergency. It does not come in under the rule we're\ntalking about.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: No, I'm not arguing that.\nI'm trying to figure out -- I think I have a little\ndifferent angle on it than you actually said in your\nbrief or actually in the text of Crawford. Of course,\nCrawford wasn't confronting this problem. It described\neverything as testimonial, but the real question is\nwho's the witness under the text of the Constitution.\nMR. GORNSTEIN: Well, Justice Stevens, I'm --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And I think your argument\nis --\nMR. GORNSTEIN: -- I'm happy to have your\napproach if it -- if it leads to five votes in this\ncase.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I think I'm trying to help\nyou.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I know it didn't start out\nthat way, but it seems to me I'm helping your side of\nit. Yes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.\nGornstein.\nMr. Friedman, you have 4 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD D. FRIEDMAN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. FRIEDMAN: I -- I think that whenever\nthere is a -- an out-of-court accusation repeated,\nthere is a witness in court, but that is not the\nwitness that -- or that doesn't satisfy the\nconfrontation right because there's the -- the --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: No, but you would agree\nthat the officer could testify to some of the things\nthat happened during the emergency, and he's a witness\nto that extent.\nMR. FRIEDMAN: Yes, absolutely, the officer\nwas --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And the question is whether\nhe can cover this as well.\nMR. FRIEDMAN: That's -- that, of course, is\nthe -- that -- that's the question. But -- but she was\nacting as a -- a witness when -- when she made the\naccusation to -- to the officer, and characterizing it\nas an emergency I don't think helps anything in -- in\nthis case.\nThe -- the fact is that if we extend the\nemergency this far it shows -- well, it shows just how\ncapable of expansion the -- the theory is because there\nis an officer with her and there is an officer with --\nwith him. So the -- the only question is should the\nofficers leave. That means that whenever there's --\nthere's a victim potentially at large there, the\nconfrontation right wouldn't -- wouldn't apply.\nThe -- the whole emergency doctrine really\ndistorts incentives because a -- a police officer who\nhas a -- a dual motive of creating -- of protecting\npeople, protecting the safety of -- of people and\ngathering evidence -- and I think it's clear that they\ndo -- under an emergency doctrine, would have an\nincentive to preserve the emergency or the appearance\nof emergency for -- for as long as -- for as long as\npossible. And I -- I think the -- the State encourages\npeople to call, which of course they should do, but in\npart the reason why people are encouraged to call is to\n-- is to create -- is to pass on -- is to pass on\nevidence.\nSo I don't think that even if -- even to the\nextent that the call is a -- a cry for help, well, the\nhelp is -- is seeking invitation of the -- of the legal\nsystem. In the Davis case, of course, it was an\narrest.\nIn -- in this case, the -- the statement was\nnot a cry for help. It was in response to the second\ninquiry by the police officer. The police officer was\n-- was pressing. And -- and I -- I think the -- the\nemergency doctrine simply -- simply can't -- if -- if\nthere were an emergency doctrine, I think it's just\nbadly founded and couldn't apply here.\nIf it please the Court, I believe Crawford\nhas brought us to a remarkable crossroads. If the\naccusation in this case is allowed to secure a\nconviction without the State providing an opportunity\nfor confrontation, then the Confrontation Clause will\nbe little more than a charade, easily evated by State\nofficers gathering evidence. But if the Court\nproclaims that a conviction cannot be based on an\naccusation made privately to a known police officer,\nthen it will take a long step to ensure that the\nconfrontation right remains robust, as the Framers\nintended for centuries to come.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What about the resemblance\nidea to get around your problem? Of course, it's not\npurely formal. It's purely formal, plus those things\nthat resemble what's purely formal.\nMR. FRIEDMAN: I'm not sure I quite\nunderstand.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Listen -- it's purely the formal\ncriteria, plus anything that's the same. Now, same is\nvague, but it's no vaguer than a lot of other things\nfloating around here today.\nMR. FRIEDMAN: Well --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So what do you think of\nthat?\nMR. FRIEDMAN: I -- I -- not much, Your\nHonor.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. FRIEDMAN: I -- I don't think an\naccusation to a known law enforcement officer is\nawfully vague. Any legal term will have some -- some\nvagueness around the edges, but I don't think there's\nmuch.\nResemblance is awfully vague. I think what\nhappened here resembled the inquisitorial practices in\nthe key -- in the key -- in a key respect. And I don't\nthink the test Your Honor is proposing handles the\nmessage over the Internet or -- or a letter, the -- the\ntape made at the initiative of the -- of the witness.\nI think it -- it utterly fails to get that because the\n-- the prosecutors aren't involved. But clearly the\nConfrontation Clause was written against the backdrop\nof private prosecution, the system of private\nprosecution. So it has to get those clauses.\nI -- I think that this case can be resolved\non those very narrow grounds without trying to\nestablish the broad, general meaning of the\nConfrontation Clause. I'm -- I'm hoping that the Court\nis building a framework for hundreds of years to -- to\ncome, and I think it's more important that it be built\nright than that it be built quickly. And so I think an\nimportant first step is to say an accusation to a known\npolice officer, whatever else is testimonial, that\nclearly must be.\nIf there are no further questions, I'm\npleased to submit the case.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
