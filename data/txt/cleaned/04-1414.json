DREEBEN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. DREEBEN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe postal inspectors in this case applied\nfor a warrant to search respondent's property. The\nwarrant that they obtained particularly described the\nplace to be searched and the things to be seized. It\nwas issued based on an affidavit that informed the\nmagistrate judge that a videotape containing child\npornography that respondent had ordered through the\nmail and had paid for in cash was going to be delivered\nto respondent's house and that the warrant would not be\nexecuted until the delivery had taken place.\nThe Ninth Circuit held that the execution of\nthis warrant, which occurred after the delivery that\nthe postal inspectors represented would occur had in\nfact happened, violated the Particularity Clause of the\nFourth Amendment.\nThe Ninth Circuit's opinion is wrong because\nthe Particularity Clause of the Fourth Amendment\naddresses two specific topics: the place to be\nsearched and the persons or things to be seized. It\ndoes not address the time of execution of a warrant,\nwhich the Ninth Circuit impermissibly read into the\nFourth Amendment in violation of its text.\nThe Ninth Circuit held, therefore, that\nbecause the warrant was not in accordance with the\nParticularity Clause, this search was equivalent to a\nwarrantless search and that all fruits of the search\nhad to be suppressed.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I think, Mr. Dreeben, at the\nend of the day, I agree with you on the particularity\nargument, but do you take the -- does the Government\ntake the position that the -- that the -- that a valid\nwarrant need not contain an indication of the time\nwithin which it may be served, executed?\nMR. DREEBEN: That's right, Justice Souter.\nIn the Government's view, the Warrant Clause\nspecifically addresses those things that need to be on\nthe face of the warrant.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: As far as --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: What would prevent the\nissuance of just a blanket warrant? We have a warrant\nfor this -- for this premises to be searched.\nMR. DREEBEN: What would prevent the valid\nexecution of a warrant that had no time limits\nwhatsoever would be the requirement that a warrant must\nbe supported by probable cause. And if agents executed\na warrant at a time at which there was no probable\ncause, for example, because they executed it before the\ndelivery had taken place or they executed it after a\ntime at which probable cause had become stale, the\nsearch would be unreasonable and the fruits of the\nsearch would probably have to be suppressed.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I suppose that a warrant\nlike a -- like a contract has a -- a reasonable life.\nDon't you think a warrant expires if it does not have a\nconcluding date? You think it goes on forever and ever\nand ever? Don't you think a warrant just lasts a\nreasonable time?\nMR. DREEBEN: I think it absolutely just\nlasts a reasonable time, Justice Scalia, and the reason\nwhy there is very little law and very little litigation\non this is that since the 1917 statute that Congress\noriginally wrote to provide for the issuance of Federal\nsearch warrants, it's provided for a 10-day execution\nperiod, and that 10-day limit has been contained and\ncontinued in the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.\nSo in the ordinary --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Dreeben, I\nunderstood you to say a short while ago that if it were\nexecuted before the triggering event, it would be\ninvalid because there was no probable cause.\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, I -- I don't want to say\nthat there's no probable cause for the warrant.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, you don't because\nthen the warrant shouldn't have issued.\nMR. DREEBEN: No. There -- there is probable\ncause that the magistrate has to believe that the\nvideotape, which was one of the items to be seized,\nwould be found at the premises at the time that the\nsearch was to be executed, which was represented in the\naffidavit to be after the delivery takes place. If, in\nfact, the warrant is executed at a time before the\ndelivery takes place, then the warrant has failed to\nconform to the probable cause that supported it and the\nsearch would be unreasonable.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Even -- even if the warrant\ndid not specifically say that it was an anticipatory\nwarrant and that -- and that you can only execute it\nafter the delivery?\nMR. DREEBEN: That's right, Justice Scalia,\nbecause there is an independent requirement that\nprobable cause must exist at the time of the execution\nof the warrant. Officers are --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But I thought that's\nsupposed to be a -- a magistrate's determination.\nMR. DREEBEN: There are two separate things\nthat are going on. One is what the magistrate must do\nat the time that he issues the warrant. The magistrate\nmust find that there is probable cause to believe that\noffense -- an offense has been committed, is being\ncommitted, or is about to be committed, and that the\nitems that the warrant is going to request to be seized\nwill be present at the location at the time of\nexecution. And the magistrate in this case was easily\nable to make those determinations based on the warrant\naffidavit that was submitted to him.\nBut there is an additional requirement of\nreasonableness, that officers may not execute a\nwarrant, even if it was validly issued, if they become\naware of facts that would tell a reasonable officer --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: If they become aware, but\nthe -- it's a big leap from that to say that they must\nmake their own determination of probable cause.\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, I -- I think, Justice\nKennedy, the easiest example to -- to see why this --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: You -- you indicated a\nwarrant can't be served unless they determine there's\nprobable cause, but that's for the magistrate to do, as\nJustice Scalia --\nMR. DREEBEN: I -- what I -- I'm making a\nseparate point here, which is that officers have a\ncontinuing obligation to act reasonably in the\nexecution of a warrant, and of course, they fulfill\nthat in a variety of ways. They have to be reasonable\nin identifying the property that's -- that's specified\nin the warrant and that they go to search. They have\nto be reasonable in conducting the search of places\nwithin that property to see that they're looking for\nthe things that are specified in the warrant and not\ngoing on a fishing expedition for things that are not.\nThey have to be reasonable in deciding whether they\ndecide to dispense with knock and announce, and they\nalso have to be reasonable in deciding that the basis\nfor probable cause that they used to support the\nissuance of the warrant has not become so stale that a\nreasonable officer would know that that warrant should\nnot be executed.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, does that mean that\nthe executing officer must be the same officer who got\nthe warrant?\nMR. DREEBEN: No, it certainly doesn't,\nJustice Stevens.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I don't know why he's going\nto give a warrant to his -- some just call in a police\nofficer and say I want you to execute this warrant. He\ndoesn't know anything about the probable cause. He\njust says he's mandated to carry out the warrant.\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, I -- I think in the\nordinary instance, it would be reasonable for the team\nof executing officers to be responsible for the inquiry\nthat I'm talking about and any individual officer --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, there's no -- there's\nno authority for that. I -- I thought warrants were\nissued to police officers all the time without knowing\nthe -- the precise reason. It's to search the house to\ntry to find X, and the warrant speaks for itself. A\njudge has made that determination.\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, the warrant is obtained\nbased on an affidavit by --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I mean, if you want us to\nwrite the opinion with this qualification in it, it\nseems to me that you're making a big change in the way\nsearch warrants are used.\nMR. DREEBEN: Oh, I don't think it's a big\nchange at all, Justice Kennedy, and I -- I think what\nI'm trying to make clear here is that there's an\nongoing obligation of reasonableness. Certainly the\nCourt does not have to get into that in this case to\ndecide it --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But -- but, Mr. Dreeben,\nthere's an ongoing obligation of reasonableness in the\nmanner of which the -- in -- in the manner in which the\nsearch is carried out. But unless every officer who --\nwho acts under the authority of the warrant is aware of\nthe probable cause evidence and can make a judgment\nwhen that evidence either is stale or, in this case,\nhas not yet ripened, then in fact there is no way for\nan officer to make that kind of what you're calling the\nreasonableness judgment in the execution of the\nwarrant. He simply doesn't have the factual background\nfor it, and that's where the timing -- we'll call it --\nthe timing clause comes in because at least an officer\nwho may not know the probable cause behind it all -- at\nleast an officer who has a warrant that says, you may\nsearch between times X and Y, or a warrant that says,\nupon the occurrence of event X and time Y, has a -- a\nrough and sound idea of when he can act. But if that's\nnot in the warrant, the officer cannot make that\njudgment. He doesn't know the probable cause\nnecessarily and he doesn't know the time.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The affidavit -- wasn't\nthe affidavit available to the executing officer?\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, in this case, Justice\nGinsburg, the -- the affidavit was on the scene. The\naffiant who secured the warrant was the lead agent who\nwas in charge of the search that was carried out. The\nsearch team had been briefed on the probable cause and\nthe -- the contents of the affidavit and the -- the\nitems that were to be searched for and when the search\nwas to take place. All of those things were true.\nThe district court also found that the\naffidavit, which does contain the triggering condition\nin two different places, was incorporated into the\nwarrant. The search warrant itself refers to the\nattached affidavit. So the documents --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: It -- it was -- I take it it\nwas, in fact, not attached but it was somewhere on the\npremises.\nMR. DREEBEN: It was not -- it was not\nphysically attached. It was in the possession --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So an officer who picked up\nthe warrant would not be able to tell necessarily. If\nhe said, hey, has somebody got the affidavit, they\ncould have brought it forward and he could have found\nout. But if -- if somebody didn't know where the\naffidavit was, he wouldn't have any way of knowing.\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, in the abstract, I\nsuppose that that's right, but in -- in the concrete\ncircumstances of this case -- and I think it's\nconsistent with what I was trying to explain is\nreasonable search warrant execution -- all of the\nsearch team was fully familiar with the process that\nwas going on. This -- this was a controlled delivery\nin which postal inspectors were arranging themselves to\nmake a delivery to the premises of the videotape in\nquestion. Everyone on the search warrant team knew\nthat until that item had been received and taken inside\nthe house, there would be no warrant execution. And in\nfact --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but the facts\nof the triggering event are not always going to be so\nclean, and in many cases they're going to require an\nexercise of judgment by the officer. I mean, if the\ntriggering event is a, you know, delivery of a bale of\nmarijuana or something and they see a big box coming\nin, they're going to have say, well, is that what\nthey're talking about or is -- you know, is that it.\nAnd the point is under the Fourth Amendment that those\ntypes of judgments are supposed to be made by the\nmagistrate and not by the officers on the scene.\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, I don't think that is the\npoint of the Fourth Amendment. I think what the point\nof the Fourth Amendment is is that the magistrate judge\nmakes a determination whether the facts that are\nsubmitted to him rise to the level of probable cause.\nAnd then the magistrate writes a warrant that's\nconsistent with what the Fourth Amendment says in terms\nthe Warrant Clause requires. Then the police officers\nhave to be reasonable in executing it. That was really\nmy only point at the outset of the colloquy that I had\nwith Justice Kennedy and with Justice Souter.\nAnd the classic example that I think shows\nthat certainly officers may use discretion in what they\ndo in determining whether it's certain types of\ntriggering conditions are met are wiretaps because\nwiretaps are issued on the basis that there is probable\ncause to believe that criminal conversations will occur\nin the future. The officers then have the\nresponsibility to conduct appropriate electronic\nsurveillance that acquires the criminal conversations\nbut not other conversations that are not within the\nscope of the probable cause that they've obtained.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but doesn't that simply\n-- isn't the analogy there that when a -- when a search\nwarrant says you may -- you may pick up implements of\ndrug traffic, all it covers is drug traffic. It\ndoesn't cover coffee, tea, and -- and milk. In -- in\nthe case of the electronic surveillance, they're\nsupposed to record criminal conversations and -- but\nnot others.\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, the point, Justice\nSouter, is that they have to make a judgment that\ncriminal conversations are what is going to be\nintercepted.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But those -- those are\njudgments about facts that they are finding. They are\nnot judgments about probable cause or the moment at\nwhich the warrant becomes valid.\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, they're -- they're not\njudgments here about probable cause either because the\nmagistrate has --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, it is. The -- the\nmoment -- the triggering event is the event that\ndetermines that the probable cause determination is, in\nfact, true now.\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, that's a separate\nquestion, and I think the magistrate's question is, is\nthere probable cause? He doesn't have to determine\nthat the probable cause is true.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And his judgment, though, is\nthere will be probable cause when the triggering event\noccurs.\nMR. DREEBEN: That's right.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And so the triggering --\nMR. DREEBEN: No. I actually, Justice Souter --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- the triggering event has\na probable cause implication, which the selection of\nobjects to be seized does not have.\nMR. DREEBEN: I -- I have to say that I\ndisagree fundamentally with the suggestion that he's\nsaying there will be probable cause when the triggering\nevent occurs. He's saying, based on the facts that are\nsubmitted to me now, the probabilities are such that\nevidence of this crime will be on the property when the\nwarrant is executed.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, he's saying two\nthings. There is probable cause to believe that what\nwe're calling the triggering event will occur, and\nthere is probable -- and when that triggering event\noccurs, there will be probable cause to believe that\nevidence of a crime may be found and seized at such and\nsuch a place. There are two determinations.\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, I -- I don't think that\nthere's any reason linguistically to prefer your\nformulation, Justice Souter, to the formulation that\nsays there's probable cause to believe now that when\nthe warrant is executed, in accordance with the\ntriggering condition's occurrence, the property will be\nfound.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Of course, that's not what\nthe -- what the warrant says. The warrant says I'm\nsatisfied that the person or the property so described\nis now concealed on the premises.\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, Justice Kennedy, I think\nthe warrant should be read as a whole and not, as this\nCourt has indicated in many cases, a technical sense.\nThis search warrant, which is at page 47a of the\npetition appendix, specifically refers to the attached\naffidavit. And the district court found as a fact that\nthe warrant was intended to incorporate the affidavit.\nThe affidavit states quite explicitly in two different\nplaces that it would not be executed until the\ntriggering event occurred, and it also makes clear that\nthe triggering event was the delivery of the videotape\nthat respondent --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: The affidavit itself says\nthere is now concealed a certain person or property.\nHe checked the wrong the box --\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, I think the -- that is\ncorrect, too, because this --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: If you read the whole\naffidavit, you know it doesn't mean what it says there.\nMR. DREEBEN: I think that not only do you\nknow that the -- this was clearly intended to be an\nanticipatory warrant as to the videotape, but it also\nauthorized the search for other items that were related\nto --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask you this\nquestion? With a warrant to conduct a wiretap, does\nthe warrant just merely specify the telephone number\nand the time at which the -- the officer may listen, or\ndoes it have anything to do with what -- what -- the\ncontent of the -- of the conversation?\nMR. DREEBEN: Wiretaps, Justice Stevens, are\nregulated extensively by Federal statute, and under\nFederal statute, a wiretap order contains a myriad of\ndetails that are not specified by the Fourth Amendment.\nAmong those details are the crimes that are being\ninvestigated and the time period of --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: No, but I mean in\ndescribing the authority of the investigating officer\nto execute the warrant, does it describe it just in\nterms of a physical number that can be listened, or one\nor more numbers, plus a time period, or does -- does it\nsay you may listen only when he's talking about foreign\naffairs or --\nMR. DREEBEN: It specifies the crimes that\nare being investigated and it contains a minimization\nrequirement which --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: It's a minimization as to\nwhat they will transcribe, isn't it?\nMR. DREEBEN: It's a minimization as to what\nconversations they will intercept if they listen to a\nconversation and determine that it falls outside the\nscope of what they're authorized to intercept. Many of\nthe calls that -- that are intercepted in these kinds\nof wiretaps require a considerable amount of judgment\nand discretion. Are the individuals talking in code?\nAre they talking about crimes in an oblique way that\npertain to the subject of the warrant, or are they\nreally having innocent conversations? And the officers\ncan listen in long enough to make that determination.\nIf they determine that it's a clean call, they have to\nminimize and terminate their interceptions.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Dreeben, could -- could\nI ask you if the Government would -- would defend a --\nan anticipatory warrant in these circumstances? The\npostal inspectors know that the unlawful video has been\nput in the mail and they know that it -- it is going to\none of 17 individuals. They're not sure which one of\nthe 17. So they go and get a warrant that says, you\nknow -- and -- and it will be obvious in my hypothesis\nthat the delivery of the video has occurred. So can\nthey get a warrant that says you can go in -- it lists\nall of these 17 people. And it says you can go into\ntheir premises as soon as you see delivery of the\nvideo. Would -- would you support that kind of an\nanticipatory warrant?\nMR. DREEBEN: Justice Scalia, I -- I would\ncertainly with respect to search of common areas. For\nexample, this was a delivery to some sort of a --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, then -- then -- well,\nI'm sorry to hear you say that because then you are\nreally not saying that there has to be probable cause.\nMR. DREEBEN: No. I'm saying that there\nwould be --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Because at the outset\nthere's no probable cause to believe that any one of\nthose 17 -- unless you think one-seventeenth is enough\nfor probable cause.\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, I think one-seventeenth\nis pushing it for probable cause --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes.\nMR. DREEBEN: -- which is why my answer was\nas to the common area. Certainly they can get a\nwarrant that says we know that there's an item that\nrepresents evidence of a crime and that it's going to\nbe at a particular location upon delivery and we can go\nin and search that location.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but I'm not talking\nabout a particular location. I'm talking about we know\nit's going to be one of 17 -- or make it 50, if you\nlike. We don't know which of those.\nMR. DREEBEN: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: We want a warrant that will\nlet us go in immediately when we see it delivered.\nWould you support that warrant?\nMR. DREEBEN: With -- if what you're talking\nabout is invading the individual expectations of\nprivacy of -- of 50 --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes. It's in somebody's\nhome. It's into a home.\nMR. DREEBEN: No, I -- I wouldn't because I\ndon't think that -- that one-fiftieth in those\ncircumstances would -- would be probable cause without\nmore. I -- I do think --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, but there's no --\nthere's no probable cause until the triggering event.\nWhen -- when the triggering event takes place, you've\neliminated the 16 others and you do know that it's --\nit's -- there's probable cause. How is that different\nfrom this case?\nMR. DREEBEN: This case is different because\nthere -- you -- you can subtract out all of the\nvariables except will the postal officials, in fact,\ndeliver it to the place where they're saying they will\ndeliver it and they say that they're delivering it to a\nhousehold that has actually placed the order.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's not\ntrue. Maybe the -- maybe the person decides he won't\naccept it.\nMR. DREEBEN: Then the -- then the warrant\nshould not be executed because this affidavit said that --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So there are a lot\nmore things than just the delivery. It's not entirely\ncontrolled by you.\nMR. DREEBEN: I think that that -- it's fair\nto say that it's not 100 percent controlled by the\nPostal Service, but I wouldn't say that there are a lot\nof things that are left up in the air or that there's\nany more that's left up in the air than in the kind of\nexperience that goes on in installing a wiretap.\nJustice --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, what -- what -- take\nthis variable. The -- the warrant can be executed when\nthe item is taken into the house, if I remember what it\nsaid. Suppose the defendant is sitting on a porch,\nsees the postal carrier, gets up, takes the package,\nand proceeds to walk down the street, and never enters\nthe house. Could the warrant be executed?\nMR. DREEBEN: Not under this warrant because\nit was secured by an affidavit that represented that it\n-- the warrant will not be executed unless and until\nthe item is taken inside the house. And so the agents\nassumed the risk, so to speak, that the event that you\ndescribed, Justice Ginsburg, would occur, and under\nthose circumstances, the search wouldn't take place.\nPresumably under those circumstances an\narrest would take place. A search would take place\nincident to the arrest of the individual. The\nvideotape would be found, and the Government would have\nacquired the evidence that it's looking for, which is\nevidence with jury appeal that this individual has, in\nfact, received child pornography through the mail.\nAnd it's important to recognize that in this\ncase there was ample probable cause that respondent had\nattempted to receive child pornography through the mail\nbefore the triggering event even took place, and had\nthe agents wished to, they could have procured a\nwarrant, a conventional warrant, so to speak, at that\ntime that allowed the --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but you don't want us\nto decide the case on that ground. I mean --\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, I don't think this was\nsuch a warrant, Justice Scalia. I'm -- I'm just\npointing out that there was a chain of events that\nsupported probable cause to a very strong degree and\nthe triggering event represented that until the actual\ndelivery had taken place and the item was brought in\nthe house, the search wouldn't take place.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Could you elaborate\njust a little bit for me on why you think this case is\ndifferent from Justice Scalia's hypothetical with the\n17 people? Because my concern is there -- here you say\nonce the triggering event takes place, then you do --\nthe probable cause comes to fruition or whatever. How\nis that different than his hypothetical?\nMR. DREEBEN: It's -- it's fundamentally\ndifferent. This case is fundamentally different from\nthat hypothetical because the measure of probable cause\nat the time the warrant is issued is very weak under\nJustice Scalia's hypothetical. One out of 17 is\npushing the envelope. One out of 50, at least absent\nsome extraordinary national emergency, is probably well\noutside the envelope for saying we have probable cause\nto go into any particular place.\nJustice Scalia's hypothetical illustrates\nthat the emergence of later facts can make it very\nclear that the agents can go in and get probable cause\nat that moment, but this case is fundamentally\ndifferent because the agents have probable cause based\non probabilities.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It is probable that this\npackage will be delivered to this individual. That\nprobability exists at the time that the warrant is --\nis issued.\nMR. DREEBEN: That's right.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And that's the probable\ncause you're relying on.\nMR. DREEBEN: That's right.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It is probable that this\npackage will be delivered to this individual.\nMR. DREEBEN: That's right. And those fact --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But that probability does\nnot support the truth of the statement that the person\nor property so described is now concealed at the place\nfor the issuance of the warrant.\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, I -- I think this takes\nme back to the fact that this warrant, number one,\nshould be construed as a whole and not -- not by virtue\nof which box was checked and, number two, that there\nwere many items that were specified in the warrant that\n-- and the warrant application that the agent had\nreason to believe were then concealed at the time. So\nthis was really a case where the form warrant was\ninadequate to the -- to describe fully and accurately\nwhat was going on.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Of course, if the -- if the\nstuff was already there that supports the warrant and\nthe search, we don't even reach the question of a -- of\nthe anticipatory warrant.\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, I think you do in --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I should say I -- I've\napproached the case on the assumption that the only\nthing we're worried about is whether -- whether the\nanticipatory part is okay.\nMR. DREEBEN: And that is --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But it doesn't seem to me\nto be a fair response to say, well, we had other\ngrounds for --\nMR. DREEBEN: No. It's a -- it's a fair\nresponse into -- on how the warrant was drawn and why\nthe statements that were made are not laughably wrong.\nThey -- they are partially inaccurate because the\nvideotape was clearly not on the premises at the time.\nThey are partially right in that other evidence of\nchild pornography distribution was.\nBut this case -- and, Justice Stevens, I\nquite agree with you. This case only concerns the\ntriggering condition because that --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But -- but you would defend\nthe warrant even if the only thing they were looking\nfor was the stuff delivered at the -- at the time.\nMR. DREEBEN: Yes, and that's the only thing\nthat's before the Court.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And as to that aspect of\nit, the warrant is incorrect.\nMR. DREEBEN: Yes.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: The warrant itself.\nMR. DREEBEN: The -- the box on the warrant\nis. Again, I think that you need to --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, it's not really a\nbox. I am satisfied, et cetera, the property so\ndescribed is now concealed on the premises.\nMR. DREEBEN: The same response that I gave\nto Justice Kennedy. The magistrate found that the\nwarrant, the form of -- that constitutes the warrant,\nincorporated the attached affidavit, and the attached\naffidavit makes clear exactly what the agent had in\nmind.\nThere is an alternative point here that I\nwant to make before I reserve the remainder of my time\nfor rebuttal, and that is the Ninth Circuit's position,\neven if the Ninth Circuit were correct that the\ntriggering condition needs to be in the warrant, should\nstill not lead to the suppression of evidence because\nalthough the Government's submission is that the\ntriggering condition is not required by the\nParticularity Clause, if some other doctrine under the\nFourth Amendment did require it to be in the warrant,\nthe warrant should be treated as one that is at most\noverbroad as to the time of permissible execution.\nThat is, on its face it would authorize the warrant to\nbe executed from the moment of issuance until 10 days\nafter issuance instead of from the moment that the\ntriggering condition is satisfied until 10 days after\nissuance.\nWhen courts have confronted overbroad\nwarrants, what they have done is ask is there probable\ncause that supports part of this warrant. If the\nanswer to that is yes, the next question is, is the\nevidence that's sought to be suppressed acquired under\nthe part of the warrant that was validly supported by\nprobable cause? If the answer to that is yes, there's\nno suppression. The warrant is, in effect, severed and\nthe only suppression that can be obtained is as to\nevidence that was secured by execution of the part of\nthe warrant that's not supported by probable cause.\nHere, there was ample probable cause to\nsupport the magistrate judge's conclusion that after\nthe triggering condition was satisfied, the videotape\nwould be on the premises. The warrant was not executed\nuntil after the delivery of the videotape took place,\nand therefore, there was no deficiency in the\ncorrelation between probable cause showings that were\nmade to obtain the warrant and the time at which it was\nexecuted. And the result is that there should be no\nsuppression of evidence.\nIf I may save the rest of my time for\nrebuttal.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.\nDreeben.\nMr. Reichel.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK J. REICHEL\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. REICHEL: Mr. Chief Justice, and may --\nmay it please the Court:\nI'd like to begin with noting that, Mr. Chief\nJustice, you highlighted a specific concern with\nanticipatory warrants and a specific concern specific\nto this type of case.\nA discussion was -- was had about triggering\nevents are commonly not so clean. It requires a lot of\njudgment to be made by the officer in the field. There\nare not only examples in the case law, but I speak from\nmy own experience as a public defender of many years\nthat there are many examples that occur often in the\ncourtroom. Specifically a triggering condition may\nallow for the search of a home after a suspect sells\nnarcotics to an officer, but what will happen is the\nsuspect will take the money from the officer and then\nhave to go to another residence to get the narcotics,\nnot the residence that the magistrate and the officer\nbelieve he would get them from. As a result, he has to\nmake a determination at that point whether the\ntriggering condition has been satisfied.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Reichel, it -- it seems\nto me it's part of your case that the probable cause\nmust be in existence at the moment the warrant is\nissued and that the magistrate cannot take into account\nthe passage of time. Are you --\nSuppose that -- that policemen apply for a --\na warrant in Manhattan which is to be served in\nBrooklyn, and it's going to -- it's going to take half\nan hour to get there. Everybody knows it's going to\ntake half an hour. And the probable cause that they\ncome up with is they know that this mob leader is going\nto be in this apartment between 6:30 and 6:45. Okay?\nAnd they present the warrant to the magistrate at -- at\n6 o'clock. It will take half an hour to get to\nBrooklyn. The magistrate knows that when it's served,\nthe mob leader will be in this apartment. Can that --\ncan that warrant issue?\nMR. REICHEL: Yes, because the magistrate has\ndetermined that there's probable cause to believe that\nat the time of the search, the contraband, the purpose\nof the search, will be present in that particularly\ndescribed location.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Right, and -- and likewise,\nit -- it would work the other way. If the magistrate\nhad the same facts, the -- the mob leader is going to\nbe there between 6:30 and 6:45, and the warrant is\npresented to him at 6:30, he would have to decline it\nbecause he knows by the time it's served, it's -- it's\ngoing to be gone. Right?\nMR. REICHEL: That is correct.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So the magistrate is always\nlooking to the condition when -- when the warrant is\nexecuted, and that's all that's happening here. There\nis probable cause to believe that this person will be\nreceiving contraband. There is probable cause to\nbelieve it because he sent for it and it was mailed to\nhim. It's just a matter of waiting till it gets there.\nThere is probable cause to believe that he will\nreceive it. And all you're doing is predicting in the\nfuture, saying the probable cause doesn't exist now,\nbut it exists when the warrant will be executed. I\ndon't see -- I don't see any real difference between\nthat and the -- and the mob leader example I just --\nMR. REICHEL: Justice Scalia, what the\nmagistrate is predicting is that there will be receipt,\nbut the magistrate is -- is not predicting that there\nwill be contraband inside of that house at that point.\nHe's actually shipping that discretion to the officer\nin the field.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No, but it's probable. At\nthe time that he issues the warrant, it is probable\nthat this person will be receiving contraband because\nthey showed, you know, this guy sent for it. He sent\nfor the -- these child pornography films in -- in a --\nyou know, a Postal Service rouse, and we mailed it to\nhim. It's probable that he's going to be receiving it.\nMR. REICHEL: It is probable that he's going\nto be receiving it. However, what occurred -- what --\nthe -- the problem that occurs in such a situation is\nthat is that the warrant issuing process itself, which\nis part of the machinery of government -- the actual\nprocess of issuance is completed with anticipatory\nwarrants by the officer in the field. It's not fair to\nsay that the warrant has been issued and the magistrate\nprovides it to the officer. At that point, it's not a\nvalid warrant. A warrant cannot be issued if it's not\nvalid by definition. So what you have --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Reichel, one of the\nconcerns about the position you're taking, the\nalternative would be that the police officer, expecting\nthat this package is going to be delivered at a certain\ntime, is on the lookout for it. He sees the post\nofficer approaching, calls on his cell phone to get an\nemergency warrant, let's say. The magistrate will not\nbe nearly as well informed as he was when he was\npresented with -- was it a 64-paragraph affidavit? So\nthe magistrate knows that the whole deal -- he can't\npossibly know it if he's got -- got a telephone call on\nan urgent basis. So if you want the magistrate's\njudgment rather than the police officers' on the spot,\nthen it makes much more sense to have the magistrate\nget a detailed picture of what's going on and decide\nwhether or not he'll issue the warrant.\nMR. REICHEL: That is correct, and I'm --\nand, Justice Ginsburg, that's why telephonic warrants\nare simple and easy, one of the many alternatives to\nanticipatory warrants, which do not require any --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But I just -- I made the\nopposite argument, that a telephone warrant has to be\ndone on the basis of minimum information. The officer\n-- the magistrate will have a detailed affidavit when\nit isn't on an emergency basis. He -- he will have, as\nhe did in this case, an affidavit with 64 paragraphs\nexplaining the whole deal, how it was set up. So isn't\n-- isn't there greater security if you could have a\nmagistrate with time to think, well, is there really\nprobable cause than to have the magistrate make that\njudgment on a -- such a quick basis?\nMR. REICHEL: Yes, there is, Justice\nGinsburg. And the procedure -- the most appropriate\nprocedure is the duplicate warrant whereby the\nmagistrate, satisfying all the concerns Your Honor has\nexpressed, has this warrant. As to the final matter,\nthe final determination of probable cause, he receives\na call from the officer. There's an agent with the\nmagistrate at the time. He advises what's just\noccurred. He can advise he took the package but did\nnot go in the house. He took the package and did go in\nthe house. The magistrate has the 64-page affidavit,\nis all prepared now. He can advise the officer to sign\noff on it, that it's okay to search now. He signed\nthat --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So there has to be -- when\ndoes he get the -- when does the magistrate get the\naffidavit?\nMR. REICHEL: Well before the delivery of the\npackage in such a circumstance, Your Honor. They bring\na duplicate -- a duplicate warrant to the magistrate\nwho -- and they -- and there's an agent who stays with\nthe magistrate. They then control -- are in complete\ncontrol at this point of the contraband.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Mr. Reichel, did you take\nthe position in the proceedings below that anticipatory\nwarrants are invalid?\nMR. REICHEL: No, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: No.\nAnd did you raise the issue in your response\nto the petition for certiorari?\nMR. REICHEL: No, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: No.\nBut you want us to address it now. I mean,\nyou -- you make a big deal of the notion that there's\nno such thing as an anticipatory warrant. And yet,\nit's never been addressed below. It wasn't addressed\nby the court below.\nMR. REICHEL: Your Honor, if I -- Justice\nO'Connor, if I can elaborate. It was raised in the\ndistrict court, and in fact, I believe it's in the\njoint appendix. Excuse me. It's in the cert petition\nat page 36a, which I think is appendix D, where the\ndistrict court finds that they're permissible, and he\ncites Weber and Hale. And the district judge at that\npoint made a final determination for the litigation in\nthe district court that they were permissible and they\nwere lawful in all circumstances.\nI did not -- the matter on appeal to the\nNinth -- the court of appeals on appeal, the more surer\ncourse that we thought for reversal would be the\nfailure of particularity of these types of\nrequirements.\nBut the most important point is I do believe\nit's fairly included in the question presented before\nthis Court. Several examples, long discussion, lots of\nconfusion about what must -- what procedure must take\nplace with anticipatory warrants I think calls out for\nthe inferior courts to hear from this Court what those\nrequirements are. To answer what those requirements\nare, this Court must answer whether they're\nconstitutional --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Can I --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I don't see --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- can I take you through my\n-- a variation of my earlier hypothetical? You say\nthat the magistrate can issue the warrant at 6 o'clock,\nalthough he knows that there really won't be the\nprobable cause until 6:30. You say that would be\nvalid. He could issue it in Manhattan knowing that it\nwouldn't be served in -- in Brooklyn until 6:30.\nWhat if the magistrate specified that out of\nan abundance of caution? It's just the same case, but\nhe writes on the warrant, this warrant is not to be\nserved until 6:30. Does that make it invalid?\nWhereas, it was valid before, it's not valid if he --\nif he says I am anticipating what will be the situation\nwhen the warrant is executed. He says it explicitly,\nit can't be served until 6:30. Does that make it bad?\nMR. REICHEL: Textually he -- textually under\nthe language of the Fourth Amendment, he cannot issue\nthe warrant for service at 6:30 when probable cause --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Doesn't it strike you as --\nas strange that it's perfectly okay if he issues it at\n6 o'clock, knowing that it'll be -- won't -- that there\nisn't probable cause now, but there will be at 6:30\nwhen it will be served. You say that's perfectly okay.\nBut if he says it on a warrant, not to be served until\n6:30, it suddenly becomes bad.\nMR. REICHEL: If it -- if it is textually\nokay, if the warrant is valid under the Fourth\nAmendment, that it must be clearly stated that the time\nand the -- and the significant limit on the officer's\npower to search is the time of 6:30, that must be\nclearly stated on the warrant to satisfy the\nParticularity Clause of the Fourth Amendment.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, I see. So -- so you say\nso long as you say something as clear as 6:30, that's\nokay. It cannot be served until 6:30.\nMR. REICHEL: It must be on there. It is a\nrequirement under the Particularity Clause that it must\nbe on there for the officer --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Where -- where is time? I\nknow that the Fourth Amendment says persons and places.\nWhere does it say time is one of the particulars?\nMR. REICHEL: It is inherent. It is inherent\nin that language. It is backed up -- clearly it is\nbacked up by the purposes behind the Particularity\nClause. If a warrant -- the probable cause -- the --\nthe two clauses in the Warrant Clause, the probable\ncause, is constitutionally I believe joined at the hip.\nIt is textually joined with the objects of the search,\nthe place to be searched, and the -- and the persons to\nbe searched. And as a result --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I think time -- time is\ncertainly relevant to probable cause, but the -- the\nFourth Amendment says what you have to identify with\nparticularity are places and the items and the person.\nPerson, things, and place. It doesn't say time, but\nyou say that's inherent. Have we -- are there\ndecisions of this Court that say time goes to the\nparticularity requirement?\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Let me give you another\nexample. There are search warrants for wiretaps, are\nthere not?\nMR. REICHEL: Yes.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: And they are often\nanticipatory. They aren't issued because the suspect\nis now using the phone, but because it's anticipated in\nthe future the suspect will use the phone at some point\nand there's probable cause to believe, if -- if the\nsuspect does, there may be evidence of a crime. I\nmean, anticipatory warrants are just inherent in the\nsystem. I don't -- I just don't think your argument\nfollows from precedent.\nMR. REICHEL: Thank you, Your Honor. Justice\nO'Connor, I do know that the -- that wiretap statutes\ncame about only after three important decisions from\nthis Court: Ker v. California, Katz, and Berger. And\nin -- in those opinions, they dealt -- they dealt very\nstrongly with the Particularity Clause of the Fourth\nAmendment and wiretap restrictions. Thereafter, there\nwere extensive congressional hearings on wiretaps and\nthe final result was a very carefully drafted statute\nthat allowed for wiretap, subject to -- to very\nstringent conditions, specifically enumerated --\nenumerated crimes and specific circumstances, but\nadditionally, notice to the homeowner --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, the Constitution\nstill applies to it, and they are inherently\nanticipatory.\nMR. REICHEL: And I -- and I believe that\nwiretap laws -- the wiretap laws require a showing of\npresent probable cause, not probable cause in the\nfuture. But there is criminality ongoing at this time.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Probable cause that there\n-- this is somebody who's going to use a certain\ntelephone number and that there may be reason to\nsuspect a crime will be discussed.\nMR. REICHEL: I believe this Court announced\nin --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: And -- and this is no\ndifferent than that.\nMR. REICHEL: I believe in -- in -- this\nCourt announced, Justice O'Connor, in the Berger\nopinion that for a wiretap warrant to be authorized\nunder the Fourth Amendment, there must be a crime\nundertaken, presently being committed, or about to be\ncommitted, additional evidence of a crime that's\nalready been committed. There is present probable\ncause. And it also, I do not believe, vests the\ndiscretion in the officers to completely control when\nprobable cause will occur.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, the conversation is\nnot occurring right now. The magistrate has to say in\nthe future, when this warrant is executed, the\nconversation probably will be occurring. Right? And\nso also here. You know, the -- the receipt is not\noccurring now, but on the basis of all of the evidence\nbefore me, I think that that receipt will be occurring.\nMR. REICHEL: Justice Scalia, I believe that\nwiretaps are different for a few reasons. First of\nall, I do not believe they could have been foreseen by\nthe Framers of the Fourth Amendment. As a result, more\npragmatic modern approaches for law enforcement's needs\nmust be taken into consideration. But additionally --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I'm not sure the Framers\nused controlled deliveries either.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. REICHEL: I agree, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. I -- I have a\nquestion that you could just clarify a confusion. You\nwant to bring into this case the question of whether or\nnot anticipatory warrants are ever valid. I had a case\nin the First Circuit where I explained my view on that.\nI thought they would be reasonably described. So I\ndon't know if that issue should be brought up here.\nMaybe.\nI can't figure out what issue should be\nbrought up here. There's a Van Treska case that says\nwe ought to read these things in a common sense\nfashion. All right?\nI read it. My common sense says I have a\nwarrant here. It says nothing about anticipatory\nanything. It says you can go and search for any of 16\nitems, 14 of which are in his house well before the\ndelivery. After all, he's had all this correspondence\nwith these people about child pornography. They have\nterrific reason for thinking he might have some. And\nthat's all it says. And then it says, is there\nprobable cause for a warrant that says go in any time\nnow and search for any of these items, including what\nwill be delivered, if that's when you do it?\nI say I look at the probable cause. His\nprobable cause is he thinks that another package is\nbeing delivered, and he's right to think it. Now,\nwhether it is delivered or not doesn't add anything\nreally to the issuance of the warrant. It might add to\nhis personal confidence. But that's my common sense\nopinion. The common sense is the only question here is\ndo they have probable cause to issue a warrant that\nallows them to search now, because that's what it says.\nSo now how -- how, given that -- I grant you\nthe Ninth Circuit went into all kinds of other things,\nbut you explain to me, please, how I'm supposed to\nreach those other things and what I'm supposed to do,\nand why I'm wrong.\nMR. REICHEL: Thank you, Justice Breyer.\nThe particularity requirement requires\nspecificity on the purposes behind the particularity\nrequirement in the warrant itself and not in some other\ndocuments or supporting documents elsewhere.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Oh, no, it's not supported.\nIt's specific. It says go to Jeffrey Grubbs'\nresidence and then it has an attachment A which\ndescribes it with great specificity. And go and search\nfor and seize the records and materials described in\nattachment B, and then we have 16 different kinds of\nitems with great specificity. That's it. That's the\nend of this warrant, and that's what it says to do, and\nthat's what he did. And then he has a different\naffidavit which gives him the probable cause for\nissuing the warrant I just described.\nMR. REICHEL: Justice -- Justice Breyer, it\nsays that they may enter into that house, but only upon\nthe occurrence of a significant event, a specific\noccurrence.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Where does it say that?\nMR. REICHEL: That is in the affidavit --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, no. I'm reading the\nwarrant. I'm not reading the affidavit. It happens to\nsay that the affidavit is -- that that affidavit is --\nit's in appendix A, appendix B, but it doesn't say\nanything about going in on -- where does it say that?\nMR. REICHEL: Well, it --\nJUSTICE BREYER: It says -- mine says, you\nmay command to search on or before April 27th for 10\ndays the person/place named and make the search in the\ndaytime between 6:00 and 10:00. That's what mine says.\nMR. REICHEL: Justice --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Then there's an affidavit\nabout probable cause. That's true. So --\nMR. REICHEL: Justice Breyer, I think that\nhighlights and it supports the court of appeals\ndecision in this case, specifically because if it's not\nstated on the face of the warrant, such as --\nJUSTICE BREYER: What's not stated?\nMR. REICHEL: The limit on the officers'\npower to search.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Where is there a limit?\nMR. REICHEL: Their limit is in the\ntriggering event. It is an anticipatory warrant which\nis written at the top.\nJUSTICE BREYER: It is?\nMR. REICHEL: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What is it that tells us\nthat? I just happened to read an affidavit where the\n-- the person says that he won't enter until this\npackage is there, but there are a lot of cause I would\nthink --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Doesn't the Government\nconcede this point? I had thought the Government\nconceded that this warrant would not have been validly\nexecuted if they went in before the triggering event.\nOtherwise, there's no purpose in putting in the\ntriggering event. Maybe we'll have to get the\nGovernment to -- to state that explicitly, but that --\nthat's my understanding, that they acknowledge this\nwarrant would not have been validly executed if they\nwent in before the triggering event occurred.\nIf that's not the case, I agree. I don't\nknow why we took the case.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. REICHEL: That is correct, Justice\nScalia.\nAnd, Justice Breyer, the limitation for the\nofficer is a significant matter. It is the only thing\nthat gives him the --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well -- well, he says in his\naffidavit he's not going to execute it until this\npackage is delivered, but that -- if I read it in a\ncommon sense way, say, of course, he isn't going to\nbecause he wants to get everything at once. But after\nall, he's in the place. I would say there's a lot of\nprobable cause for him to looking for 12 of these items\nwhich are there whether this package is there or not.\nOf course, he's not going to execute it till later.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But, of course, if you take\nthat view, why did they bother to put the words,\nanticipatory search warrant, on the document? That's\nwhat we're fighting about. If we decide it on your\nground, we never should have taken cert.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Maybe that's the answer.\nMR. REICHEL: I believe the particularity\nrequirement also does not assume that the officers\nseeking the warrant will be the officers serving the\nwarrant.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What else is there in\nthis joined at the hip particularity requirement? The\nnumber of officers? Which officers, FBI agents or DEA\nor something else? I mean, you're -- you're adding to\nthe text of the amendment, and I just wonder what else\nis added under your view.\nMR. REICHEL: Mr. Chief Justice, I believe\nthey are joined at the hip because the -- the\nparticularity requirement --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No. That's your\nargument. I'm just saying what else is joined at -- at\nthe hip besides time. You say they don't say time.\nThey say persons to be seized and place to be searched,\nand you say inherent in that is time. Well, what else\nis inherent in there?\nMR. REICHEL: If there's a -- Mr. Chief\nJustice, if there's a significant limit on the time of\nthe execution of the warrant, then that does become\npart of the Particularity Clause.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's time. Is\nthere anything else that's not written there that is\npart of that particularity requirement?\nMR. REICHEL: Not that I -- if it is\nsignificant -- if it is a significant limit on the\nofficer's power to search and if it serves the other\npurposes of the particularity requirement, the\nmeasurement of the -- providing the homeowner the\nnotice of what is going on.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, there's all\nsorts of, as Mr. Dreeben explained, reasonableness. It\ndoesn't say how you enter the house, but if you\nsuddenly go in with a -- with a tank, we might find\nthat unreasonable. But that's not something that has\nto be spelled out particularly under the terms of the\nFourth Amendment.\nMR. REICHEL: Mr. Chief Justice, that's\ncorrect. The reasonableness prong is separate, and I\nthink this Court has -- has long pronounced that the\nmanner of executing a warrant may offend the\nConstitution and vitiate the legality of a search.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So who --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It doesn't have to be\nspelled out in the warrant itself.\nMR. REICHEL: The manner of entry -- the\nmethod of entry does not have to be spelled out.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So who, what, and where\nincludes when, but it doesn't include how. Right?\nWhere -- where do you derive this proposition?\nMR. REICHEL: I believe that not for -- for\nall cases, I cannot answer the question, but for cases\nof anticipatory search warrants where the officers are\ngoing to finalize the issuing process, the officers are\ncompletely in control of the manufacture and completely\nin control of the completion of the delivery of the\ncontraband, and if a magistrate has allowed them to\nmake that decision in the field, that has to be clearly\nstated to satisfy the particularity requirement on the\nfront page of the warrant so that any officer executing\nit, not just those who -- who seek the warrant, but the\nofficer executing it, is keenly aware of his limit to\nsearch. As well, it puts the homeowner on notice of\nthe other factors of the particularity requirement that\nthis has announced in --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask --\nMR. REICHEL: -- the Groh v. Ramirez opinion.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- may I ask you this\nquestion? The warrant now says it is now -- the\nwarrant says the contraband and so forth is now\nconcealed on the person or in the house. And if I\nunderstand your position correctly, your first argument\nis it should have said, will be concealed upon the\nhappening of the anticipatory event. That would have\n-- and describe the event properly. That would have\nsatisfied the Ninth Circuit's objection.\nMR. REICHEL: That -- that is correct,\nJustice Stevens.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Now, why would that not\nalso have satisfied the objection of the warrant -- the\nargument you make in this Court? Because it would have\nmade it clear that there is now probable cause to\nbelieve it will be there at the time of the execution.\nWhy isn't that sufficient to make the warrant valid?\nMR. REICHEL: It will make the warrant valid\nunder the Particularity Clause.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Will it also satisfy the\ntext of the Constitution that says no warrant shall\nissue except upon probable cause? And I'm asking you\nwhy is it not adequate probable cause to say we believe\nthat will probably happen when the anticipatory event\noccurs?\nMR. REICHEL: Because the text of the -- of\nthe probable cause requirement in the Fourth Amendment\nhas clearly been announced by this Court to always\nrequire the magistrate's determination of the facts, as\nwell as the legal grounds, after studied caution to\nmake that determination.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, he has made a\ndetermination of the facts that will establish probable\ncause.\nMR. REICHEL: He has, Justice Stevens, but he\nhas ceded his discretion to finalize that -- to\nfinalize that decision.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Will you -- will you just\nhelp me with this? Justice Stevens answered my\nquestion. The word anticipatory. The word\nanticipatory does suggest it isn't valid for a while.\nNothing else in the warrant does.\nWhat am I supposed to do if I think there's\nadequate probable cause for issuing that warrant right\nnow in respect to 12 of the things? And it's really\npretty hard for me to try to understand what this\nwarrant is about if I'm supposed to understand it, by\nreading through about 15 or 20 pages of small print and\nthere discovering somewhere in the back of it some --\nthe post office says I'm not going to execute this\nuntil this other package gets there too. Now, that\ndoes make me nervous. That -- that supports you.\nMR. REICHEL: That does not --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I understand that, but it's\nnot going to support you enough unless you connect this\nanxiety I'm having now about this being buried in page\n28 of an affidavit when it's an important condition of\nthe warrant, the only clue to that fact being the word\nanticipatory. And there we are. Now, you tell me why\nthis anxiety, which is going to help you, is connected\nto something in the law.\nMR. REICHEL: Justice Breyer, they are prone\nto abuse by nature. They are --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, please don't. I start\nwith an assumption that an anticipatory warrant is\nconstitutionally valid. I start with that assumption.\nI'm assuming that the conditions have to reasonably\ndescribe. My anxiety is resting only on the fact that\nthis warrant doesn't seem to be an anticipatory warrant\nbut for one word, and to know what it's about, you have\nto look through 28 pages of fine print. Now, you\nconnect that anxiety to something in the law.\nMR. REICHEL: Thank you, Justice Breyer.\nIn Groh v. Ramirez, this Court set forth very\nclearly that the purpose of the particularity\nrequirement serves two functions. One is for law\nenforcement; the second is for the homeowner. And for\nlaw enforcement, it is very clear in these -- this\nCourt's decisions that that must be so that the officer\nexecuting it can simply and quickly and efficiently\ndetermine the limits of their power to search.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Of course, all -- this whole\nargument begs the question. It -- it assumes that the\nparticularity requirement includes time, not only who,\nwhat, where, but also when. Right? I mean, you -- you\nacknowledge that if you're wrong about that, if you're\nwrong about the fact that who, what, and where\nautomatically includes when, the argument you've just\nmade doesn't get anywhere.\nMR. REICHEL: Justice Scalia, I -- I can --\nit is inherent in the place, the objects, and the\npersons to be searched in a particularity --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I understand that's your\nargument, but you agree that if -- if that argument is\nwrong, you're done.\nMR. REICHEL: That's correct. With regard to\nanticipatory warrants, time is part of the\nparticularity requirement. The time of the execution\nof the warrant, the time of the determination of\nprobable cause that contraband will be present, the\ntime of the determination of probable cause, which is\nthe triggering event, which comes from the Fourth\nAmendment itself --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: They have first the outer\nlimit of the 10 days in the warrant itself. And in\nfact, this warrant was executed within 2 days of its\nissuance. Is that not --\nMR. REICHEL: That's correct, Justice\nGinsburg.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And could it be if the\nofficer knows that this package -- let's say it's\nloaded with dynamite or guns or drugs -- is going to be\ndelivered at a certain time and it -- the delivery\noccurs, and then the officer busts in and says, there's\nexigent circumstances. They're going to take those\ndrugs and they'll be off the premises. That might\nhappen.\nMR. REICHEL: That might happen. Exigent\ncircumstances in the execution of a warrant were not\npresented in this case.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, my -- my question\nis, isn't it better to have the police go to the\nmagistrate when there's time for the magistrate to\nreflect, than to have this scenario where the police\nwill say this was really dangerous stuff, exigent\ncircumstances? Wouldn't you want the officer to apply\nin advance for the warrant?\nMR. REICHEL: Justice -- Justice Ginsburg,\nyes, I would. And I think at that point the officers\nwould also have to leave the final determination as to\nwhether probable cause has been completed to the\nmagistrate through the use of many alternatives,\nincluding a telephonic warrant where the --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Even -- wasn't this man --\nmagistrate told we've set this whole thing up? We've\nput this package in the mail. It's going to be\ndelivered at such and such a time. Wasn't the\nmagistrate told that?\nMR. REICHEL: Yes, Justice Ginsburg.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So why was there a need\nfor a second call when exactly that happened?\nMR. REICHEL: Well, specifically what was\nhighlighted in this case is that the individual\nreceiving the package was his wife, Justice Ginsburg.\nAnd it's -- it's clear in the record that she received\nit. Moments later, they rushed in. The first thing\nshe said to the officers is what is going on here and\nwhy are you here? What is going on here? Why are you\nhere? At that point, I believe clearly under -- under\nthe court of appeals decisions and other court\ndecisions, that this crime, the knowing receipt of the\nillegal material, had not been completed. There had\nbeen no crime committed at that point. And there was\nno -- no knowing receipt of the illegality of this.\nThere's never been any evidence --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Didn't -- was -- he was on\nthe premises?\nMR. REICHEL: He was inside the --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And he said, I know why\nthey're here.\nMR. REICHEL: Justice Ginsburg, he was inside\nthe house, and he walked outside thereafter.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, and they -- and they\nfound other -- other videotapes besides the one that\nhad just been delivered, didn't they, in the course of\nthe search?\nMR. REICHEL: They did, Justice Scalia.\nNow, but they did enter the house prior --\nthey entered the house prior to a lawful triggering\ncondition. In such an example, they could have\ncontacted the magistrate immediately, advised what had\nhappened, who would have realized at that point that a\ncrime had not been committed, that there was not\nprobable cause that this crime, the knowing receipt,\nhad been committed.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And exactly the same thing\nwould be true if they had stated the triggering event\nclearly somewhere in -- in the warrant. The -- the\nargument here is that the triggering event was stated\nin the affidavit.\nMR. REICHEL: But this does -- Justice\nSouter, this highlights why the triggering event must\nbe clearly, specifically drawn by a magistrate with\nstudied caution about the exact factors for probable\ncause which would allow this search. And if it's\nburied in some affidavit somewhere, if it's not on the\nfront of the warrant, or if it's vested in the\ndiscretion of the officer to make that determination\nwhether that's close enough, then it is prone to these\nabuses and it is -- requires the magistrate to make\nthat final legal determination.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMR. REICHEL: Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Dreeben, you have\n3 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Dreeben, a quick yes or\nno. Does the Government concede that when you have an\nanticipatory warrant, the warrant is not properly\nexecuted until the -- the anticipated event occurs?\nMR. DREEBEN: Yes, Justice Scalia, because\nthe representations that are made to the magistrate to\nsecure the warrant include the fact that the warrant\nwill not be executed and the agents should --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But that -- that puzzles me\na little. The -- the affidavit says execution will not\ntake place until the event. But the authority to\nsearch, which is in the last paragraph, is not limited\nto the time after the anticipatory event.\nMR. DREEBEN: That's true because I think\nthat the magistrate is making the common sense judgment\nthat this will be -- we don't know exactly when --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I mean, not even -- it is\nnot only the warrant, but the affidavit itself doesn't\nsay we merely request permission to search after the --\nafter the event. It's a general request for authority\nto search.\nMR. DREEBEN: It makes the representation,\nand I think what draws the link between the conditions\nthat are represented to occur before the warrant will\nbe executed and the warrant itself are paragraphs 1, 2,\nand 3 of the items that are to be seized because those\npertain --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: No. I'm drawing your\nattention to paragraphs 61 and 64 of the affidavit.\nMR. DREEBEN: I understand that, Justice\nStevens. But the -- the items to be seized include the\nvideotape and its containers which are paragraphs 1, 2,\nand 3.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, but the authority is\nbroader than the authority to search for those items.\nMR. DREEBEN: That's true. But those items\n-- the magistrate can conclude that there's probable\ncause to believe that they'll be on the premises only\nafter delivery has taken place. And the magistrate has\nissued the warrant, and the three principal items at\nthe top are those things. So it's logical to conclude\nthat the magistrate formed the view that there's\nprobable cause to believe that these items will be on\nthe --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But it takes a step of\nreasoning beyond merely saying we incorporate the --\nthe affidavit into the warrant.\nMR. DREEBEN: I think it takes a very small\nstep of logical inference, but I agree with you,\nJustice Stevens, that it doesn't say everything that is\nlogically implied in the magistrate's probable cause\nfinding. But the magistrate's probable cause finding\nis predicated on the view that the items will be there\nbecause the Postal Service has represented they'll\ndeliver them.\nThe burden of the Ninth Circuit's view is\nthat the Particularity Clause applies to the triggering\ncondition and mandates that it be stated in the text\neven though the Fourth Amendment's text doesn't contain\nthat requirement. This Court in Dalia v. United States\nrejected a similar effort to add a requirement to a\nwarrant that would authorize surreptitious entry to\ninstall a covert bugging device, and the Court's\nreasoning in Dalia makes clear that the Court was\nunwilling to go on a progressive path of reading things\ninto the Fourth Amendment's Particularity Clause that\nare not there.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So you just want us to say,\nlook, the Ninth Circuit is wrong. They're okay to have\nconditional warrants like this and there is no absolute\nrule you always have to have the triggering condition\nin. As to whether this is too confusing or not too\nconfusing, send them back and let them figure it out.\nMR. DREEBEN: No, I don't want the Court to\nsend it back to the Ninth Circuit to impose yet new\nrequirements on the execution of warrants.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. DREEBEN: What I want the Court to hold\nis that the triggering condition in an anticipatory\nwarrant is not subsumed in the Particularity Clause and\ntherefore it need not be in the face of the warrant at\nall. And alternatively, if the Court believed that it\ndid, that a warrant that's executed after the\ntriggering condition has occurred, does not require\nsuppression of evidence.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.\nDreeben.\n"
