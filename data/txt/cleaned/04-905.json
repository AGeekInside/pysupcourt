ENGLERT, JR.\nON BEHALF OF PETITIONER\nMR. ENGLERT: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may\nit please the Court:\nSixty-six years elapsed between the passage of the\nRobinson-Patman Act and the judgment of the District Court in\nthis case. In that time, there is no reported instance of a\nfinding of a violation by a seller operating in an industry like\nthis one in which a sale is made to the plaintiff distributor\nif, and only if, it has already secured a contract for resale to\na particular end user. Courts have long understood that mere\noffers at different prices cannot violate the Act, because it\nrequires two purchases, and that successful purchases in\nwinner-take-all bidding cannot have the requisite effect on\ncompetition. To affirm the judgment below would open up new\nvistas for application of the Robinson-Patman Act where it has\nnever been applied before.\nThis case --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You concede, though, don't\nyou, Mr. Englert, that the language of the statute covers the\nconduct here?\nMR. ENGLERT: Very much the opposite, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, you have a person\nwho's engaged in commerce, who's discriminating in the price\nthat they offer to different purchasers. Now, I know your\nargument about the structure, but the actual language does seem\nto encompass the activity.\nMR. ENGLERT: Well, I don't agree, with respect,\nYour Honor. With respect to mere offers, offering a price to\ndifferent purchasers is not covered by the statutory language.\nWith respect to the sales-to-sales comparisons, there is not the\nrequisite effect of such discrimination --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, just to --\nMR. ENGLERT: -- on competition.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- get to your first point,\nthe statute talks about discrimination in price between\ndifferent purchasers, and not different actual purchases.\nMR. ENGLERT: But this --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It doesn't seem it's that\nmuch of a stretch to cover would-be purchasers, potential\npurchasers.\nMR. ENGLERT: Well, except that, back in 1947, this\nCourt, in the Bruce's Juices case, made clear, in the early days\nof the Act, that it takes two completed sales to violate the\nAct. No one sale can violate the Act. Even earlier than that,\nthe Third Circuit, in the Shaw's case, in 1939, laid down that\nrule, and it's been an accepted rule of Robinson-Patman Act\njurisprudence for that entire time. And it is a natural reading\nof the statute, and in accordance with the general principle,\nthat this statute should be construed consistently with the\nlarger body of antitrust law.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But may I not ask, Isn't it true\nthat each of the parties here, over a long period of time, was a\npurchaser? I mean, the -- Reeder was a purchaser, was he not?\nThey were a dealer.\nMR. ENGLERT: Yes.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: So, they were a purchaser. And\nwere not the other people who purchased from Volvo also\npurchasers?\nMR. ENGLERT: Yes. With respect to the sales- --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: So there were --\nMR. ENGLERT: -- -to-sales transactions --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- two purchasers.\nMR. ENGLERT: Well, with respect to the\nsales-to-sales transactions in which there were --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Over a --\nMR. ENGLERT: -- two purchases --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- period of time, you had two\npurchasers.\nMR. ENGLERT: Yes. But the statutory language is\nthe effect of \"such discrimination\" must be to harm competition\nin one of these justified instances.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And the discrimination occurred\nover a period of a couple of years, as I understand it.\nMR. ENGLERT: No, Your Honor. This case was tried\non the basis of several discrete transaction comparisons. It\nwas not tried on the basis of any systematic study of every\noffer to Reeder and every offer to --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, if --\nMR. ENGLERT: -- another --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- these are ordinary automobile\ndealers who sold out of inventory, would you agree that they\nwere -- you had two purchasers?\nMR. ENGLERT: Sure.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: So that the whole point of your\ncase is they're negotiated transactions?\nMR. ENGLERT: The whole point of the case is the --\nis twofold. Each transaction is one in which there is a\npurchase if, and only if, there is already a contract for\nresale, so that when there is an offer compared to a purchase,\nyou don't have two purchases. And when you've already got the\ncontract for resale --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but -- I mean, you say that,\nbut the title goes to the dealer. The dealer makes the\npurchase. Aren't you -- as I understand your answer to Justice\nStevens, and also your answer to the Chief Justice, if these\nwere automobile dealers that sold some inventory, there would be\na cause of action if you extrapolate this -- these kind of\nfacts. One dealer being discriminated against, vis-a-vis\nanother dealer.\nMR. ENGLERT: If the requisite effect on competition\nis shown, yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, and if there was a sale to\nthe other dealer. You would say that there had to be a sale to\nthe other dealer.\nMR. ENGLERT: There have to be two sales.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Not just an --\nMR. ENGLERT: But there would --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- not just an offer to the other\ndealer --\nMR. ENGLERT: Correct.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- of higher prices.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but there would be sales if\nthey were selling from inventory. I mean, there would have been\na preceding sale, and the sale would have been at differential\nprices, as between two dealers.\nMR. ENGLERT: And that's the typical --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yes.\nMR. ENGLERT: -- Robinson-Patman case. That's the\ncase in which there is a potential violation. The case in which\nthere is a sale by the purchaser if, but only if -- I'm sorry,\nthe case in which there is a purchase by the purchaser if, but\nonly if, it already has the sale is the case in which it can't\nhave lost that sale in competition with a favored dealer because\nof price discrimination, which is what the statutory language\nrequires, which is --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Englert --\nMR. ENGLERT: -- why the Robinson-Patman Act --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- suppose you had a case of\ntwo Volvo dealers, and the scheme is, as this one, specially\nordered goods with competitive bidding, but, over a substantial\nperiod of time, one dealer -- we'll call that dealer the\n\"favored dealer\" -- consistently gets higher concessions, and\nthe other dealer, who ends up being the plaintiff in the case,\nconsistently, in that same period, gets lower concessions. So,\nwe don't have a picture of what you call \"mix and match,\" but\ntwo dealers, one consistently getting higher concessions, and\none consistently getting lower, and, therefore, missing out on\nsales or making sales at a very low profit. That, too, would be\nout of Robinson-Patman, if I understand your view of the\nstatute.\nMR. ENGLERT: It -- yes, I think that's correct.\nThat's a closer case to what's the -- what the statute was\ndesigned to cover than this case, but, yes, that, too, would be\nout of Robinson-Patman.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So, you go back to the language --\nare you finished with that answer? Go ahead and finish, if you\nwant.\nMR. ENGLERT: Enough for now, Justice Breyer --\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right.\nMR. ENGLERT: -- yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: In respect to the language, how do\nyou read it? I think it's ambiguous. \"To discriminate in price\nbetween different purchasers of commodities.\" Do you read it --\n\"different purchaser\" -- \"to discriminate in price in respect to\nthat commodity that is purchased\"? Do you read it \"to\ndiscriminate in price between different purchasers of\ncommodities -- i.e., the commodity, the particular item -- the\ncommodity there refers to the particular item in respect to\nwhich there is the discrimination\"? How do you want to read it,\nliterally? I just want your --\nMR. ENGLERT: Well --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- literal reading of the statute\nto -- I agree with you, 60 years, nobody's questioned it. I\nagree with you, policy reasons, very strongly on your side. I\nagree with you, at least hypothetically, but for the particular\nlanguage. So, look at the phrase and read the language as you\nwant me to read it.\nMR. ENGLERT: Well, two different issues, Justice\nBreyer. With respect to the two-purchase rule, if the statutory\nlanguage is ambiguous, and if it can be read to say \"purchaser\nstatus is enough,\" then I think the principle stated in all of\nthis Court's cases, that the Robinson-Patman Act --\nJUSTICE BREYER: You're giving --\nMR. ENGLERT: -- should be construed --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- me a policy argument. I don't\nwant a policy argument, for the moment. I want to know -- what\nyou're saying is that the word \"purchaser\" means \"purchaser in\nrespect to the particular commodity -- this one that is\npurchased, there has to be a discrimination in price.\"\nMR. ENGLERT: And there's a textual reason --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And what you're hearing, I think,\nis, well, this person, the dealer, bought other items in respect\nto which there was no discrimination in price. So, he is a\npurchaser of that commodity. You see, \"commodity\" could refer\nto the kind of thing -- Volvo trucks -- or it could refer to the\nparticular thing -- this truck. And I want to know how you read\nthe literal language.\nMR. ENGLERT: The textual answer to your question is\n--\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's all I want --\nMR. ENGLERT: -- the phrase --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- the textual answer.\nMR. ENGLERT: -- the phrase \"the effect of such\ncompetition\" ties --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Oh, no, no. I'm very --\nMR. ENGLERT: I'm sorry, the effect of such --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- sorry. The effect of such\ncompetition --\nMR. ENGLERT: -- discrimination.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- was conceded in this case, that\nthere's the effect on the competition. There are two separate\nthings. There is the truck that was purchased by the disfavored\ndealer. In respect to that, he wasn't hurt, in the sense of the\nstatute, because, even though he got a lower profit margin, that\ndoesn't count. I'm not focusing on that.\nI am focusing upon the truck that he did not\npurchase. The reason that the disfavored dealer did not\npurchase that truck is that he had a rival -- maybe there's only\none case of it, but there's at least one -- he had a rival, the\nfavored dealer, who got the purchase. He got the order from the\ncustomer, and then ordered the truck. Now, in that one, I take\nit, the problem is that there was no purchase by the disfavored\ndealer.\nMR. ENGLERT: Correct.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. But what you're hearing\nis, \"So what? He was a dealer whose line of business was to\npurchase Volvo trucks, and, therefore, he is a purchaser of a\ncommodity -- namely, Volvo trucks.\"\nMR. ENGLERT: Well --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And there was a discrimination --\nnamely, the offer was discriminatory. And there was a harm to\ncompetition, in the -- in the Robinson-Patman sense -- his rival\ngot the sale.\nMR. ENGLERT: Well, I still question whether --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So, I want the textual answer.\nMR. ENGLERT: Okay. I still question whether the --\nunder the text -- the effect of such discrimination was the\nrequisite effect on --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes.\nMR. ENGLERT: -- competition. But --\nJUSTICE BREYER: The effect of such discrimination\nis that his next-door rival, in effect, \"got the sale.\" Do you\nwant to say that isn't enough?\nMR. ENGLERT: Yes, I do want to say that isn't\nenough. And, Justice Breyer, first of all, I --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Let's assume I don't agree with you\nabout that. Now --\nMR. ENGLERT: Well --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- what?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Englert, I thought you were\nrelying on the succeeding phrase, where \"either or any of the\npurchases involved in such discrimination are in commerce,\"\nwhich seems to require that -- \"to discriminate in price between\ndifferent purchasers where either or any of the purchases\ninvolved in such discrimination\" -- I thought that's what you\nwere hanging your hat on, to say that there has to be a\ndiscrimination in particular sales.\nMR. ENGLERT: I think the statute, read as a whole,\ncompels that conclusion. But if I'm wrong about that, and if\nthere is enough ambiguity to admit of a different conclusion,\nthen the principle comes into play that cases of ambiguity in\nthe Robinson-Patman Act are construed to be more consistent with\nthe overall --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, of course, if we can go back\nto the language, it's between different purchases of commodities\nof \"like grade and quality.\" And that seems to me to indicate\nthat Volvo Trucks, generically, must be looked at -- the policy,\nwith reference to Volvo trucks, generically. Suppose one dealer\nalways got a 10 percent discount, the other dealer always got a\n20 percent discount over a period of time.\nMR. ENGLERT: Well, Your Honor, I think everyone,\nincluding the lower courts in this case, agrees that you don't\nlook at the goods generically. You have to look at their\ncharacteristics to determine like grade and quality. And I\nwould actually think that the grade --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: It has to be purchase-by-purchase\nto determine like grade or quality?\nMR. ENGLERT: Yes. Every Robinson-Patman case\nthere's ever been has been purchase-by-purchase at the level of\n--\nJUSTICE BREYER: Fine. That's --\nMR. ENGLERT: -- sale from the manufacturer to the\ndealer.\nJUSTICE BREYER: You've put your finger right on it.\nMy question is so obvious that you're not giving me an answer.\nEvery case for 60 years has been on your side of it. Those\njudges, though, were -- must have been reading some language.\nAnd how did they interpret that language? That's all I'm asking\nyou. A very literal question. It has nothing to do with policy\nor anything. And all I want you to do is take the statute and\nread the language so that it is possible for you to win this\ncase.\nMR. ENGLERT: Okay.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay.\nMR. ENGLERT: I'm a manufacturer. I'm reading the\nstatute. I have to give a price on a particular deal. I\nrealize I can't discriminate in price between different\npurchasers of like grade and quality, where the effect of such\ndiscrimination may be one of the prohibited effects. I say,\n\"Okay, can I give a different price to one dealer or to\nanother?\" Yes, I can, because it says \"different purchasers of\ncommodities of like grade and quality.\" It is a specific\ninstance of a purchase, a specific instance of discrimination.\nThe very words in the statute are what judges have read\nconsistently to compel that result.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this question, just to\nget it in the -- Supposing volvo had a policy of granting\neverybody a 20 percent concession, and they had -- except\nReeder -- and they always granted Reeder just a 15 percent\nconcession, and the -- you had the same sales pattern you have\nhere. Would there be a violation of the Robinson-Patman Act?\nMR. ENGLERT: Well, again --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Prima facie violation.\nMR. ENGLERT: I think the answer is no, Your Honor,\nalthough that -- although that would be a closer case --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Even if there --\nMR. ENGLERT: -- than this case.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- were dozens and dozens --\nMR. ENGLERT: This case was tried on the basis of\nthe same transactions.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- of sales to both.\nMR. ENGLERT: Yes. Yes. That would be a closer\ncase. But the -- it might fit the policy of the Act, but it's a\nvery poor fit with the words of the statute. And --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, it depends on how -- whether\nyou regard the purchase as on a single -- each single\ntransaction as a separate purchase or if you look at a course of\ndealing and say that, over a period of years, the favored dealer\nis one purchaser and the disfavored dealer is the other\npurchaser. Why can't you look at the pattern of dealing by\nautomobile dealers over a period of time?\nMR. ENGLERT: That would be the argument in favor of\nan expansive reading of the language in the hypothetical example\nto cover that case. But it would not be consistent with the\ngeneral policies of antitrust law.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: It would be consistent with the\nliteral language, wouldn't it? If you treat it, the purchaser,\nas a -- as -- look not at just individual transactions, but what\nthey do over a period of years, just like any other -- any\nordinary automobile dealer. Two dealers in this market, one in\nArlington and one in Bethesda, are both purchasers, even though\nthey may not compete on the same transactions, aren't they?\nMR. ENGLERT: No. The effect of such discrimination\nhas to be to harm competition with the favored purchaser. And\nif all transactions are hermetically sealed from one another,\nyes, the buyer might like a better price, but it's not\ncomplaining about the effect of such discrimination on\ncompetition with the favored purchaser.\nTo put this point in perspective, imagine that Volvo\nraised its price to every so-called favored purchaser --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But --\nMR. ENGLERT: -- in this case.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: You would agree, in my\nhypothetical, there's discrimination, but you'd say there's no\ninjury to competition.\nMR. ENGLERT: There's no injury to competition that\nis the effect of such --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Even if you --\nMR. ENGLERT: -- competition with --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- got an expert to --\nMR. ENGLERT: -- a favored purchaser that is the\neffect of such --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- even if you got an expert to\ncome and say, \"Well, these two dealers are in the same relevant\nmarket, and there's a likelihood that customers go to the\nfavored dealer,\" that would not be a prima facie --\nMR. ENGLERT: Oh, if you have that evidence?\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yes.\nMR. ENGLERT: That there is a likelihood that, in a\npattern, customers have gone to the favored dealer? That's --\nthat begins to come within the statutory language in a way this\ncase does not.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I understand --\nMR. ENGLERT: There is no customer testimony, no\nevidence of diversion to any favored dealer in this case, no\nevidence that Reeder lost profits because of the price given to\nany favored dealer, only evidence that if Reeder had gotten a\nprice, it would have -- better price -- it would have made more\nmoney. Well, every dealer can show that.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I understand your argument\nthat there's no injury or impact in competition for resale of\nthe trucks. What's wrong with looking at the statute as being\nconcerned to protect competition to be the Volvo dealer? In\nother words, you know, they're competing -- if Volvo's\nrestructuring its approach, they're competing to be the favored\ndealer, even though they don't compete with other Volvo dealers\ndirectly.\nMR. ENGLERT: The main problem with that\ninterpretation of the statute is, it takes the last phrase of\nthe statute and makes it no longer a limiting phrase. It\nessentially makes all price discrimination illegal. And this\nCourt said, in Brooke Group, and has said in many other cases,\nthat it is not -- not all price discrimination is made illegal\nby this statute. It does require the requisite effect on\ncompetition.\nI'd like to reserve the balance of my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you.\nMr. Hungar.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS G. HUNGAR\nFOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,\nSUPPORTING THE PETITIONER\nMR. HUNGAR: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may\nit please the Court:\nThe fundamental question in this case is whether a\nplaintiff who did not purchase goods for resale in competition\nwith a favored purchaser can, nonetheless, establish all the\nelements of a Robinson-Patman Act claim by picking and choosing\nfrom among different aspects of unrelated transactions. The\nposition of the United States is --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But how can you say --\nMR. HUNGAR: -- that the answer is no.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- that the dealer didn't purchase\ngoods for resale in competition with other Volvo dealers?\nThat's exactly what they do every day, isn't it?\nMR. HUNGAR: No, Your Honor. When they purchase the\ngoods, they are not in competition with any other Volvo dealer.\nBy definition, they have the sale. And so, if --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Can't they be --\nMR. HUNGAR: That's the point that I'm making.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- in competition just from -- on\na day-to-day basis over the years, over a period of time, trying\nto get business?\nMR. HUNGAR: In a different sense, they may be in\ncompetition --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Assuming --\nMR. HUNGAR: -- with other --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- they're in the same relevant\nmarket, of course.\nMR. HUNGAR: In a different sense, yes. But the\npoint is, the price discrimination does not occur when there is\nany competition. And, therefore, the requirements of the Act\nare not satisfied.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: You're assuming they're not in\ncompetition on a continuing basis, they're only in competition\nfor one isolated transaction after another.\nMR. HUNGAR: No, Your Honor. The -- they may be, in\nother senses, and in -- and in seeking other customers, in a --\nin some sense, in competition with other Volvo dealers. But, at\nthe point that the price discrimination occurs, they are not.\nAnd, therefore, even in the -- in the -- in the -- well, in any\nof the examples offered by the Respondents in this case, they\ndon't show price discrimination between competing purchasers,\nwhich is what this Court, in the Morton Salt case and in other\ncases, have indicated the Act was aimed at. And as Mr. Englert\nindicated, that is why, in the 70 years since the\nRobinson-Patman Act was enacted, we haven't seen cases like\nthis, because it is understood that the Act has no application\nin these circumstances, and --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Two --\nMR. HUNGAR: -- I would --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- two dealers within 10 miles of\neach other, customers frequently go to both dealers to check out\n-- to get the lowest price. Dealer A gets 10 percent discount\nroutinely; Dealer B, 20 percent discount routinely. Over a\nperiod of time, would there be a violation of the\nRobinson-Patman Act?\nMR. HUNGAR: And all the same structure as this --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes.\nMR. HUNGAR: -- hypothetical? Well, the answer is\nno, but only for, I think, one of the several reasons why in\nthis case the answer is no. That is, in your hypothetical they\nare, in a sense -- and I'm assuming that there might be direct\nhead-to-head competition, but the offers are different -- or\naffected by the differing differentials. So, there is -- there\nis competition between the purchasers, and there is\ndiscrimination in offers, although not in purchases. So, there\nis still the two-purchaser requirement which is not satisfied in\nthat circumstance. There is the -- Reeder is not purchasing in\n-- assuming it loses the sale to the other customer, it's not\npurchasing in competition with a favored customer, a favored\ndealer, because it's not purchasing at all.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Just so --\nMR. HUNGAR: But I would point out that even if the\nCourt is unwilling to go that far in this case, that you don't\nneed to go that far to resolve this case and to reverse the\njudgment below for the other -- because of the other failings in\nthe plaintiff's case here.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And the -- and the main\nfailing there is that Volvo Trucks and Reeder-Simco do not\ncompete in the same market for sales of Volvo trucks. Is that a\ncorrect statement of the record?\nMR. HUNGAR: Well, I don't think I would put it that\nway. I think, again, they don't compete at the point at which\nthe price --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: For any --\nMR. HUNGAR: -- discrimination occurs.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- particular sales.\nMR. HUNGAR: Right. Yes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I see.\nMR. HUNGAR: And that's --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay.\nMR. HUNGAR: -- right. Other than -- there are the\n-- the two examples of what have been called head-to-head\ncompetition, in one of which there was clearly no price\ndiscrimination, in the other of which our reading of the record\nis that a reasonable jury could not have found that there was\nprice discrimination. And even if there were price\ndiscrimination, that one instance, standing alone, could not\nsupport a finding of a Robinson-Patman Act --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Why not?\nMR. HUNGAR: -- violation.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Why not? The -- Hiland -- is that\nthe one?\nMR. HUNGAR: Because there --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Hiland Dairy?\nMR. HUNGAR: -- because there's no substantial\ninjury to competition.\nJUSTICE BREYER: In other words, a -- I mean, you\ncould go in -- I see that. But what -- is there any authority\nfor that, that just one -- a head-to-head competition, he bought\nthe truck. Let's -- keep that out of it, so imagine they bought\nthe truck, they resold it, and the market structure is such\nthere probably is quite a lot of competition, in fact, with\nother dealers, and they lost at least one sale. That's not\nenough to prove an injury to competition?\nMR. HUNGAR: I don't think so, Your Honor. I mean,\nclearly --\nJUSTICE BREYER: What's the authority for that?\nMR. HUNGAR: Well, certainly the Morton Salt\ninference wouldn't apply, because there's no substantial --\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's a different matter. That's a\n-- what -- I'm saying, What authority is there -- have there\nbeen cases in which that was not viewed? After all, let's\nsuppose the dealers are located geographically in about the same\nplace, and it's logical to think they'd go for the same\ncustomers. They overlap. Their territories are close. Logical\nto think people shop around for trucks. And we have in the\nrecord one item where they -- one instance in which they found\nthe customer, and he said, \"Yeah, I did -- I did go and shop in\nboth. I lost\" -- the disfavored dealer lost the sale.\nMR. HUNGAR: Well, I don't --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Any authority?\nMR. HUNGAR: Well, this Court's cases, and the lower\ncourts', have understood the Act to require a likelihood of a\nsubstantial injury to competition --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, they say, \"This is our\nevidence that it is likely.\" Just what I said.\nMR. HUNGAR: But one sale is not substantial, Your\nHonor, I would submit. And, moreover, in this case, of course,\nthey don't have that evidence of the close dealer with whom they\nare in repeated competition for the same customers that -- and\nso, I don't think we have that case. We don't have a\nsubstantial injury, even if you assume -- even if you read the\nevidence the way they do with respect to the one head-to-head\ncompetition.\nAnd it's important to understand that this -- the\ntwo-purchaser rule is not the only flaw in the judgment below.\nThe Act requires causation. That is, the price differential\nmust cause the injury to competition. Here, it's not the price\ndifferential that causes the injury, in the sense that the\nRobinson-Patman Act addresses. The Act is addressed to the\nsituation where they're competing head to head, the favored\npurchaser has a competitive -- a relative competitive advantage\nwhich allows them to offer a lower price and, thereby, either\nget the sale or reduce the profits of the competing purchaser.\nBut that's simply not the case here in these sales-to-sales or\noffers-to-sales competitions. The fact that some other dealer\nin some other transaction with some other customer got a better\nprice has absolutely no relevance, no significance, and no\neffect on Reeder's ability to get a sale or make a profit in its\ntransactions with an unrelated customer. So, there -- the\ncausation element that's so crucial under the Act is absolutely\nmissing here.\nAnd, in fact, Reeder's interpretation would simply\nread the injury requirement out of the statute. They would say,\n\"Whenever there is a price differential, we've been injured,\nbecause if we had gotten the lower price instead of the higher\nprice, we would have made more money.\" So, there's per se\ninjury. The Morton Salt inference is converted into an\nirrebuttable presumption --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. --\nMR. HUNGAR: -- contrary --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- Mr. Hungar, do you agree with\nMr. Englert that even if you had -- you could -- you had a case\nbased on two dealers, one consistently gets higher concessions,\none consistently gets lower concessions, and they're in roughly\nthe same market -- that even that would not be covered by\nRobinson-Patman?\nMR. HUNGAR: And they're in repeated head-to-head\ncompetition for the same customers -- one gets -- they're\ngetting --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But I --\nMR. HUNGAR: -- differential offers? Is that --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- I'm not putting the\nhead-to-head in. Just, one of his sales gets lower concessions;\none, higher. That's --\nMR. HUNGAR: I agree that that would not be\nactionable under the Robinson-Patman Act. The reasons why --\nthe reason, or reasons, why depend on whether they are in\nhead-to-head competition or not. If they're never in\nhead-to-head competition, then they're never in competition --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Let me just --\nMR. HUNGAR: -- and they would fail to have --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- modify Justice Ginsburg's\nquestion a little bit. Supposing, over a period of years, one\ndealer always got 15 percent off, and the other one always got\n20 percent, and there's testimony they're in the same relevant\nmarket, so presumably customers can go to either one. What more\ndo they have to prove to establish a prima facie case?\nMR. HUNGAR: They have to prove at least what Morton\nSalt said, which is price differentials between competing\npurchasers. And the way the purchasers were competing in Morton\nSalt was that --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, I understand --\nMR. HUNGAR: -- they were both competing --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- I understand the Morton Salt\ncase, but do the -- I'm assuming they're in the same relevant\nmarket in which customers patronize both of them from time to\ntime, but they can't identify that Mr. Smith was here on this\nday, and the other dealer on the same day, but just an\noverlapping in the -- in the same competitive market. Would\nthat not create a prima facie case? And if not, how much more\nwould they have to prove?\nMR. HUNGAR: Well, in this market, they'd have to\nshow that they were purchasers --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well --\nMR. HUNGAR: -- at --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- they're both purchasers.\nThey're dealers, in my hypothesis. Each of them buys a hundred\ncars a year, and one of them pays a higher price than the other,\nand they're in the same relevant market --\nMR. HUNGAR: Yes, Your Honor, but they haven't\npurchased --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: What?\nMR. HUNGAR: They haven't purchased in connection\nwith the --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: They all purchased --\nMR. HUNGAR: -- a price discrimination --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- for the purpose of reselling,\nif they can find customers.\nMR. HUNGAR: Well, right. But, as Justice Scalia\npointed out, the Act clearly does not apply to offers. It\nrequires purchases --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, I understand.\nMR. HUNGAR: -- and it requires --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: In my case --\nMR. HUNGAR: -- sales.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- there are a hundred purchases\nby each of them at different prices. What more do they have to\nprove, other than that they were in the same relevant market?\nMR. HUNGAR: They have to prove that they were in\ncompetition with each other and that competition was --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Now, isn't the fact they're --\nMR. HUNGAR: -- injured by --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- in the same --\nMR. HUNGAR: -- the differential.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- relevant market enough to prove\nthey're in competition with each other?\nMR. HUNGAR: No, Your Honor, because -- it's not\nenough to prove they're in competition with each other. They\nhave to prove that they are in -- that the price differential\ninjured, or was likely to injure, substantially, that\ncompetition. And that is not true if they aren't competing in\nconnection with the transactions --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, but if you're looking at --\nMR. HUNGAR: -- in which the price discrimination\noccurs.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- if you're looking at broad\nmarket competition, you don't normally require them to identify\ncompetition on a customer -- on a per-customer basis. The only\nreason we get into the per-customer basis is that we have this\nodd -- not an odd situation, but the situation with Volvo trucks\nthat no dealer ever buys unless he's already got a -- got a sale\nwaiting. But in Justice Stevens' hypothetical, we -- as long as\nthe market was identified, and as long as they were buying, we\nwouldn't require anything more to show competition, would we?\nMR. HUNGAR: May I answer?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Sure.\nMR. HUNGAR: Your Honor, if -- I understood Justice\nStevens' hypothetical to address the situation where, as in this\ncircumstance, they are not competing at the point at which they\nactually purchase --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No.\nMR. HUNGAR: -- the product. If it were the\ntraditional Robinson-Patman Act case, where they purchase for\ninventory and are both trying to sell the same goods to the same\ncustomers, then yes, the problems that we've identified here\nwould not exist.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Hungar.\nMR. HUNGAR: Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Phillips.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS\nON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT\nMR. PHILLIPS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may\nit please the Court:\nIt seems to me there are three issues that have been\nposed by the way both this case has been argued by the parties\non the other side and as the questions have arisen. And the\nfirst one is whether or not there is competition in this\nparticular case. And Justice Stevens' question, it seems to me,\nposed the issue about as starkly as it can be: Is it not the\ncase that under traditional standards of Tampa Electric, this\nCourt's decision there, and a host of other cases, that we\ndefine \"competition\" by reference to whether or not entities\ncompete for the same -- with respect to the same product in the\nsame market, same region, and if they're -- if that's what you\nhave by way of competition, then you look to the next level,\nwhich is to see: Is there price discrimination, and is there\ninjury to that competition?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What evidence was there of\ncompetition here? How -- did you bring forward instances where\nthey both bid for sale of special trucks to a single\nrepurchaser?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, we clearly did that with the --\nwith the Hiland case. That was -- that was clear. But the\ntestimony was uncontested on both sides. Both Reeder's --\nReeder testified, \"We compete against other dealers every day.\"\nAnd Volvo's witness testified --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Not other Volvo dealers.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Yes, other Volvo dealers.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I thought the Volvo policy\nwas, if you had two dealers competing for the same sale, they\ngave the same discount to each dealer.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, that's not the competition.\nThat's the question as whether there is discrimination. The\nquestion is, Do Volvo dealers compete against other Volvo\ndealers, in the first instance? And with respect to that, the\ntestimony was absolutely clear, it's in the -- witnesses for\nVolvo -- are quoted in our brief at page 8 -- explicitly say,\n\"We compete, on a daily basis, in the region and the district,\nVolvo dealer to Volvo dealer.\"\nNow, there's a separate --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But there's never -- but, in\nthose situations, there's never two purchases, there's always\none -- there's only one completed purchase.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, the -- again, there are lots of\nsituations where there are two purchasers. Again, you go back\nto the -- to the four specific transactions that were\nidentified. For the 102 sales, 55 percent of the sales between\n1996 and 2000 involve -- I mean, 1998 -- involved\ndirect-comparison sales, where we purchased from Volvo, and one\nof our competitors 200 miles down the road -- and on interstate\nhighways, 200 miles down the road's the same as next door -- and\nwe -- we purchased exactly the same product, and we got a\nsignificantly lower concession --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, but --\nMR. PHILLIPS: -- under the circumstances.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But that was for a resale to\n-- that was for resale to different purchasers.\nMR. PHILLIPS: To be sure, it was --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Nobody's buying two --\nMR. PHILLIPS: -- for resale.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- nobody's buying two\ntrucks from two different purchasers.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right. Anymore than anybody's buying\ntwo cars from two different purchasers in the -- in the classic\ninventory situation.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but it's very hard to compare\nthose two sales, because they all depend upon the special\nfeatures on the trucks that are ordered by the particular\nindividual, and also how -- you know, how much of a hard bargain\nthat individual is driving. I don't know how you can compare a\nsale to one -- one person with XYZ features on the truck with a\nsale to a totally different person with ABC features on the\ntruck.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Justice Scalia, that was precisely\nthe defense that Volvo made at trial. They put it to the jury,\n\"Remember, it has to be like kind and quality. We are required\nto demonstrate that the truck that we are getting a 10 percent\ndiscount on and the truck that they're getting a 20 percent\ndiscount on is exactly the same like kind and quality of truck.\"\nAnd that was their defense. And our witness meticulously --\nI'd commend the record to you if you want to read it -- but he\nmeticulously examined each of those trucks and showed that,\nsystematically, for 102 sales, they sold the exact same truck to\na dealer down the road, with a significantly better price than\nthe truck they sold to us, in order to implement the \"Volvo\nVision\" and drive my client --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: For resale --\nMR. PHILLIPS: -- out of the dealership business.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- to a different purchaser, who\nmay have been in a better position with regard to the\nnegotiation than any of your customers were.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, he -- but whatever that\nperson's position was, vis-a-vis its customer, doesn't affect\nthe relationship between Reeder-Simco and Volvo, and that\nindividual and Volvo.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why is it --\nMR. PHILLIPS: There, it has to be a level playing\nfield.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- why is it --\nMR. PHILLIPS: That is precisely what\nRobinson-Patman is about.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- why is it unreasonable -- why\ndoes it violate the principle of Robinson-Patman, and why does\nit destroy competition, for Volvo to say, \"We'll make whatever\ndiscount it takes to get the sale, and if this dealer needs a 20\npercent discount for this sale, but this other fellow over here\nonly needs a 10 percent discount to make that sale, we're going\nto have a differential discount\"? Why -- I don't see why that\nharms competition.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Because the -- it wouldn't\nnecessarily, on an episodic basis. But what you have in this\ncase is substantial price discrimination across time, which this\nCourt held, under Morton Salt, triggers an inference of\ncompetitive injury.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Phillips, the problem that I\nhave with even accepting your theory is what the other side\ncalls the \"mix and match\" quality of your evidence. That is,\nyou say here's Reeder, disfavored, and here's someone else,\nfavored. But it's not consistently the same someone else. And,\nfor all we know, someone else could make a case saying, \"We\ncompare ourselves with Reeder, and we say, oh, there was that\nsale 7 months ago, where they got a whopping discount and we got\na much smaller one.\" You're not -- you don't have the same\nfavored customer. You're picking from a series of sales, and we\ndon't know how manipulative this proof is. And we I mean - and\nwe don't --\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, I mean, putting aside the fact,\nYour Honor, that I think that that's essentially a jury question\n-- I mean, I do think both sides get to put on the evidence that\nshows that there's been discrimination and that there -- and\nthen we know what the market consequences will be. But if you\nlook at plaintiff's exhibit 104, which is in the appendix to the\nCourt of Appeals at 577, and you look down that list, you will\nsee that they are -- where they're specifically talking about\nReeder-Simco, and it has -- and it satisfies its 28 percent of\nits overall objective in 1999; and then you go through the\ntestimony of Reeder-Simco's co-owner, and he's -- identifies\neach of the four or five competing entities that were the\nbeneficiaries of those -- of the price discrimination of those\nsales in the 102 sales that were the basis for liability; and\ntheir percentages for the objectives during the next -- during\n1999 are 71 percent, 81 percent, 97 percent, 107 percent, 92\npercent -- those are -- those are huge differentials.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Phillips, when you lose\n--\nMR. PHILLIPS: And --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If I may. When you lose a\nsale, it's because Volvo didn't give you a big enough discount.\nIt's not because they gave another Volvo dealer a bigger\ndiscount.\nMR. PHILLIPS: That's today, Mr. Chief Justice, to\nbe sure. But tomorrow, when I go to the next dealer to -- go to\nthe next purchaser, the reason I didn't get that sale was\nbecause I didn't have enough capital to have the same quality of\nsalesperson in place to make that sale.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, sure, but, I mean,\nthat's -- I mean, long term -- of course, Volvo can terminate\nyou, as a dealer, tomorrow. And --\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, it can't. Under the contract\n--\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well --\nMR. PHILLIPS: -- and under State -- Arkansas State\nlaw, it can't.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- well, what -- but it --\nunder the Robinson-Patman Act, it can.\nMR. PHILLIPS: As long as it doesn't discriminate on\nthe basis of price --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The classic --\nMR. PHILLIPS: -- you're right.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- case that the\nRobinson-Patman Act is directed to is when you lose sales\nbecause they're giving bigger discounts to other sellers. And\nthat's just not the case here.\nMR. PHILLIPS: But it -- it's not just sales. It's\nalways been lost profits, as well. And if we are paying more,\nwe're losing money, vis-a-vis our competitors. And then every\nday after that, we're competing with our -- one arm tied behind\nour back because we have less money. And is there any reason to\ndoubt that --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But Volvo's interest may be\nin as -- making as much money off of sales this year, and they\nmay not be terribly concerned about whether you, as a reseller,\nare making enough profit to last 3 years or 5 years.\nMR. PHILLIPS: That's true. But we know from the\nrecord that Volvo's purpose in this enterprise was to eliminate\n50 percent of its dealers --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That -- that's a --\nMR. PHILLIPS: -- and to do so by using price\ndiscrimination.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- that's a -- that's a broad\nRobinson-Patman principle you're arguing for, that a -- that a\nseller such as Volvo has to make sure that each of its\ndistributors makes the same profit?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Oh, no. To be sure, no --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And if --\nMR. PHILLIPS: -- of course not.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- if it works its system in such a\nway that one of them is making less profit than another, it's\nliable?\nMR. PHILLIPS: No, there are -- there are two\nelements to this, Justice Scalia. You first have to demonstrate\nthat there's discrimination. And the way you demonstrate\nanticompetitive discrimination is to show that there is a\nconsistent pattern. It has to be substantial discrimination\nover a substantial period of time.\nIf we're trying to cut deals on a daily basis,\npresumably today you got a deal with a customer, and I'll give\nyou a 10 percent, and then the Chief Justice got a deal\ntomorrow, and I may give him 12 percent, but, 2 weeks down the\nline, the situations will likely be flipped out. You're not\ngoing to find, where you have 55 percent of your sales, 102\nsales involving $250,000-plus of sales differentials to be the\nbasis for the claim that there is price discrimination in the\nfirst instance, Justice Scalia.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Do you have any instance where you\nmade an offer to a buyer assuming that you'd get the kind of a\nbreak that Volvo gives to other dealers -- all right? -- you\nmade that offer, and the buyer says, \"Yes, I'll take it at that\nprice\" -- and then you go to Volvo, and they won't give you that?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Oh, sure. We had thousands of those\nexamples.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Where you made the offer to the\nbuyer --\nMR. PHILLIPS: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- and the buyer had agreed to buy\nit --\nMR. PHILLIPS: Sure.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- and you --\nMR. PHILLIPS: Where we -- well, I -- had agreed to\nbuy it. We had a -- clearly, there was an understanding. Our\nsales person thought that, \"If I can get this discount at this\nrate, I can cut this deal,\" went to -- went to Volvo, asked for\nthat rate, Volvo said no. Didn't get the deal.\nJUSTICE BREYER: This is the Robinson --\nMR. PHILLIPS: That happened literally more than a\nthousand times. The testimony on that is rampant. And the\nreason we don't make more of that, Justice Scalia, in this\nparticular case, is because the jury verdict is based on actual\nsales. There is as very clear fidelity to the two-purchaser\nrule in the way the jury verdict was rendered and the way the\nCourt of Appeals affirmed it. That said, I -- a lot of this\ndiscussion about, you know: Is that two-purchaser rule, in its\nmost strict version, the right way to interpret the\nRobinson-Patman Act? Our view is, it's not. But we don't have\nto get there --\nJUSTICE BREYER: If it's not, the -- the reason -- I\nthought, for about 60 years, the words \"different purchasers of\ncommodities,\" it forbids any person to discriminate in price\nbetween different purchasers of commodities. Now, you have to\nrefer -- as soon as I ask the question, or start getting into\nthe language, I forget the statute, and it's so complicated that\nI'm giving you time to think about it --\n[Laughter.]\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- and to think of those words in\nyour mind.\nMR. PHILLIPS: All right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: It's a -- it's forbidden to\ndiscriminate in price between different purchasers of\ncommodities.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Now, I had always thought -- and I\nthink the Courts' decisions bear that out, or the absence of\ndecisions -- that the words \"discriminate in price between\ndifferent purchasers of commodities\" meant you can't\ndiscriminate in price between different purchasers of the item,\nor items, in respect to which the discrimination of price\nexists. That's what I thought it meant. And it seems to me\nthat was the general understanding in the antitrust bar, that\nwas the general understanding of the courts. And either it's\nnot permissible to give such an interpretation -- I don't know\nwhy it wouldn't be; it's literal -- or there's a good policy\nreason for not doing it in respect to the policy.\nAnd in respect to the policy, what worries me about\nthe broader interpretation is suddenly doing what Volvo --\nforbidding Volvo from doing what it probably wants to do here.\nIf it wants to get rid of its dealers, it's because it wants to\ncompete better with other brands. And that means lower prices\nfor consumers, though individual dealers might be hurt.\nSo, if I'm trying to read that law consistent with\n60 years of history, and the basic purposes of the antitrust\nlaw, I guess I would -- might favor your opponents in this. I'm\nexposing my entire line of thought. I'm trying to protect\ninterbrand competition, why -- while, at the same time, not\nbeing -- not being unfair to the purposes of Robinson-Patman;\nand, therefore, I'm reading this fairly literally, as it's been\nread. So, what's your response?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, I guess the difficulty I have,\nJustice Breyer, is understanding why you don't think we are --\nwhat we have here is precisely different purchasers of\ncommodities.\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, I said -- I said they -- in --\nthe problem for you is that, in respect to discrimination\nbetween the item, or items, the -- in respect to -- the purchase\nof the item, or items, in respect to which the discrimination\nexisted. Insofar as there were items, or items, purchased,\nthere is no discrimination. At least there is no discrimination\nthat -- in terms of the injury of the statute, creates that kind\nof injury. In respect to instances where you have a strong case\nof the right kind of injury, there was no purchase, defined as I\njust defined it.\nMR. PHILLIPS: I apologize for being --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, let me deal --\nMR. PHILLIPS: -- dense, Justice Breyer.\n[Laughter.]\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- with the latter. I will say --\nMR. PHILLIPS: Let --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- there are some items where your\nclient bought the truck.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Absolutely.\nJUSTICE BREYER: When he bought the truck, he got\nthe sale, although he earned less profit. Put those to the\nside.\nMR. PHILLIPS: It's difficult --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Let's focus --\nMR. PHILLIPS: -- for me to do that, Justice Breyer\n--\nJUSTICE BREYER: But you are.\nMR. PHILLIPS: -- but I understand.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Let's focus --\n[Laughter.]\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- on the items -- let's focus on\nthe items where he didn't get the sale.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: When he didn't get the sale, there\nwas no purchase of the item, or items, from the manufacturer in\nrespect to which the discrimination existed.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay? Now, it's that second class\n--\nMR. PHILLIPS: That's what you want me to focus on.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes.\nMR. PHILLIPS: That's fine. As long as you accept\nthat the first class is a distinct one, and, as far as I'm\nconcerned --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Of course it's distinct. Of course\n--\nMR. PHILLIPS: -- but -- and it totally makes my\ncase, as far as I'm concerned.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Oh, well, you have a --\nMR. PHILLIPS: I realize you may disagree with me on\nthat, but --\n[Laughter.]\nMR. PHILLIPS: -- we'll start there. But I just\nwant to be clear that that's a completely separate analysis.\nThen, it seems to me, what you -- what you have to go back to is\nthe kind of analysis that Justice Stevens was saying, which is\nthat when you're talking about different purchasers of\ncommodities, there is no reason to be so focused on the -- on\nthe identical transaction, rather than recognizing, particularly\nin the context of a dealership arrangement where you're -- have\ncontinuous relationships between the -- between the seller --\nthe manufacturer and the dealer, where you have this enormous\ndisadvantage to the dealer, who has already sunk, you know, huge\namounts of money into this and is in -- essentially at the whim\nof what is now a monopoly seller -- a monopsony -- a monopoly\nseller. And, under those circumstances, it makes perfect sense\nto say, \"Look, if I'm going to systematically keep getting 20 --\n10 percent discounts, where my competitor, a hundred miles away,\nis always getting 20 percent discounts,\" that's a situation that\nthis statute seems clearly aimed at dealing with.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You're not at the whim of a\nmonopoly seller. You mentioned to me just a little while ago,\nyou've got a contract with them. You can put in that contract\nwhatever you want about pricing.\nMR. PHILLIPS: I have a 5-year contract that's\nalready in place, so, at least for the 5 years, I'm pretty much\nat the whim of my -- unless I want to breach the contract, which\n--\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You should have written a better\ncontract.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, unfortunately --\n[Laughter.]\nMR. PHILLIPS: -- I didn't write that contract,\nJustice Scalia.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But on a misinterpretation of\nRobinson-Patman.\n[Laughter.]\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What do you do with the\npolicy argument -- at, sort of, the level of the forest, rather\nthan the trees -- that the antitrust laws are designed to prefer\ncompetition in interbrand -- in the interbrand market, rather\nthan intrabrand, and that, therefore, to the extent there's\nambiguity, that supports an interpretation that allows the\nmanufacturer to strengthen his interbrand position, as opposed\nto protect the intrabrand position?\nMR. PHILLIPS: I think to make that argument you\nessentially have to make mush out of the last half of the\nRobinson-Patman Act, because it's not injury in any line of\ncommerce, which is where I think you would be talking about\ninterbrand problems. It's problems with respect to customers of\neither of them. And it's quite clear, and it's been clear since\n1948 in Justice Black's opinion for the Court in Morton Salt,\nthat this is designed to recognize that when you harm an\nintrabrand competitor, that that's the kind of injury to\ncompetition that this statute was aimed at. And this Court\nreaffirmed that both in the 1980s, reaffirmed it again in 1990,\nin Texaco. And it's -- and notwithstanding some effort to ask\nthe Court to revisit Morton Salt at this point, it seems to me\nthat that principle ought to be completely settled at this\nstage. If there's to be any fix there, it ought to be a fix\nthat's offered up by Congress.\nTo go back to, then, your point, Justice Scalia, I\ntold you, first, you have this discrimination in price, you have\nto show that it's substantial, lasts for a substantial period of\ntime, you get the Morton Salt inference. You -- then we still\nhave to show, under section 4 of the Clayton Act, that we have\nactual injury to our business and property. And in this\ncontext, it seems to me, the evidence is absolutely\noverwhelming, because you have a situation where, in 1995, we\nare next-to-none dealer for Volvo. In 1995, we're selling 66\ncars, we're making $165,000. Volvo implements its \"Volvo\nVision,\" the purpose of which is to drive my client out of this\ndealership. It engages in systematic discrimination, both with\nrespect to unquestionable purchases on both sides and, candidly,\nmore broadly than that. And the effect of that, at the end of\nthe day, is that our sales go from 65 to 34 to 18 to 8. Our\ngross profits dropped to $26,327.\nYou compare that to the kind of evidence this Court\nlooked at in the -- in the J. Truett Payne case, where it wasn't\nclear that there was really any discrimination involved there,\nthere was no drop in the market, there was no evidence of any\ndiversion of any sales. And, even in that context, this Court\nwas unwilling to say that the Fifth Circuit's decision holding\nthat the evidence was flat-out inconsistent -- or inadequate to\nsustain the verdict, was overturned, had to be sent back.\nI submit to you, the evidence in this case is vastly\nstronger. The jury reached the result that it did. That result\nwas approved in the face of a JMOL --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, let me ask you --\nMR. PHILLIPS: -- and affirmed --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- this question.\nMR. PHILLIPS: -- on appeal.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Supposing you did have a contract,\nsuch as Justice Scalia suggests, in which the manufacturer\nagreed that, at any given point of time, you will get just as\nfavorable a concession as any other Volvo dealer could get at\nthe same time. If there were such a contract in place, would\nthe evidence show that it was breached?\nMR. PHILLIPS: In this case, yes, it would have\nbeen. We have evidence that they clearly didn't. Because they\nhave a policy of trying to accomplish the same thing, and didn't\nachieve that in this particular case, in at least two instances.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But you did -- you did get a\njudgment on the -- whatever it was -- the State Franchises Act,\nand that is not being contested --\nMR. PHILLIPS: That's correct --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- on appeal.\nMR. PHILLIPS: -- Justice Ginsburg.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So that if -- the question is\nwhether fair franchising practices -- were there unfair\npractices? You won a verdict that there was a violation of the\nFairness in Franchising Act.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right. We clearly aren't raising the\nState law issue here. Our argument here is that the\nRobinson-Patman --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, you won on it.\nMR. PHILLIPS: -- violation --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You won on it. But the\ndifference is that that doesn't give you treble damages.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, it also has a different statute\nof limitations, Justice Ginsburg. There are a lot of\ndifferences between the State law and the Federal claim that\nwe're --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: On --\nMR. PHILLIPS: -- that we're pursuing here.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- limitations, one of the\naspects of this mismatches -- that in one case you went back as\nmuch as -- there was a 7-month differential. Is there a\ntimeframe, if we adopt your theory, about -- in which you can\nengage in this comparison?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Oh, of course. You require the jury\nto make a determination that it's within a reasonable period of\ntime and that it's in a reasonable adjustment. There is no\nchallenge to the jury instruction on whether or not the\ncomparisons that were made were legitimate in any way. So,\nthat's -- you know, there's no question that this Court can\ncertainly establish a rule that says certain timeframes are\neither, per se, good or bad, but that issue is clearly not\nraised by the way the jury -- this jury was instructed, because\nthere was no challenge to the instruction, in this case.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And it's also not disputed now\nthat these were goods of like grade and quality.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Not disputed that these are goods of\nlike grade and quality, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Phillips, how many States have\nthese fair franchising laws? Are there any States that don't?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Oh, I'm sure there are some States\nthat don't. I think there are about 30-some States that do, as\nI recall.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Your argument that focuses\non the dealer's profits, I guess, doesn't depend upon you losing\nthose sales at all. I mean, if you -- you had made all the\nsales, but you still thought you should have gotten a bigger\ndiscount that would have allowed you to make more money, you'd\nhave the same argument, right?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, I think if we had gotten all of\nthose sales the first time around, we would have ended up with\nthe profits that would have allowed us to make the sales --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Oh, no, you just go back and\nlook again, 7 months or a year down the road, and if somebody\nelse was getting a bigger discount -- if you had gotten the\nbigger discount, you would have made more money on those sales,\nand then you would have had more capital, and you'd be able to\nbe a dealer for a longer time.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, I think, at the end of the day,\nwhat we're talking about is essentially a jury question: Were\nwe entitled to say these were lost profits, the margins were\nreduced, we didn't have as much money? That interfered with our\nability to make sales in the future period, because you have the\ncomplete before-and-after documented history in this particular\ncase.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So --\nMR. PHILLIPS: It seems to me that's a jury\nquestion. And the jury found in our favor.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Wouldn't --\nJUSTICE BREYER: You suggest something very -- to\nme, quite interesting, but it would be quite a departure, I\nthink, from prior law that --\nMR. PHILLIPS: I hope not.\nJUSTICE BREYER: If you want to go look at this, you\nknow, you say, all right, here's -- we should be realistic about\nit. We're going to be realistic. Realistic, they -- we're only\nnow looking at the cases where they undoubtedly bought the item,\nbut the profit was lower. There's no purchaser problem.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But they got a lower profit. And I\nthink, there, the mine-run of cases is against you that that\ncounts as an injury.\nMR. PHILLIPS: That, by itself, wouldn't count as an\ninjury.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes. Yes, but it's -- you know, it\nshows that they're going to be hurt, that they may be driven out\nof business.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Indeed, the market in -- the\ndealership market, whatever -- if that's a separate market,\nwhich it might be -- becomes more concentrated, and the result\nof -- you know, I could make a -- tell a little story there that\nwould be quite consistent with the purposes of the antitrust\nlaw. So we follow that approach in this case and say goodbye to\nMorton Salt, because Morton Salt, after all, was a case that was\nquite formalistic. It didn't really look to the injury to\ncompetition in a market. It had a formalistic slogan that\nwould, in fact, be a proxy for that.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So, what do you think of that? We\nfollow your -- we follow your advice, we say, \"Okay, we're going\nto be very realistic in the future. Forget the presumptions.\nAnd, court, look to see whether competition, in the sense of\nincreased concentration through people going out of business,\nwill lead to higher prices with the ordinary antitrust proxies\nthere.\" What about that? I mean, I don't know if you -- you\nknow, I --\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, I'm not here to --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- I'm being a little --\nMR. PHILLIPS: -- I'm not here, necessarily, as an\nadvocate for overturning Morton Salt, for obvious reasons. I\nthink the answer to your question is, under Morton Salt we\nclearly win, because we -- we probably didn't need to show as\nmuch as we did, in terms of the impact of this particular\ndiscrimination on our ability to compete in the future. I think\nwe were entitled to a straight inference of that, in terms of\nthe substantial -- or reasonable possibility of injury in the\nfirst instance. But, beyond that, I -- you know, you could\ncertainly hold, in this case, that Reeder-Simco has made more\nthan enough of a case in order to recover under the\nRobinson-Patman Act. But --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, in fact --\nMR. PHILLIPS: -- we, neverthe- -- I'm sorry,\nJustice --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- you almost have to show that.\nBut the evidence of the head-to-head competition, it seems to\nme, too insubstantial to support liability here. Would you\nagree? I -- and I --\nMR. PHILLIPS: One --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- I -- your opposing counsel says\nyou almost concede that, right?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, we -- I mean, we don't rely on\nit. And part of this -- part of the problem is that it's not --\nthat head-to-head item wasn't part of the jury instruction. So,\nthat -- we -- I can't rely on it, in terms of supporting it. If\nyou ask me, outside of the context of this case, would I defend\nthat argument? I probably would try to defend the argument.\nBut it's obviously much tougher when you only have one\nhead-to-head. It's completely different when you're talking\nabout 102 sales-to-sales comparisons over years, with\nsignificant differentials, that clearly caused the kind of\ninjury we have here.\nIf there are no further questions, Your Honors, I'd\ngive you back the rest of my time.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Phillips.\nMr. Englert, you have four minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ROY T. ENGLERT, JR.\nON BEHALF OF PETITIONER\nMR. ENGLERT: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nThe heart of the theory of this case came up in\ncolloquy between the Chief Justice and Mr. Phillips. The Chief\nJustice pointed out that Reeder doesn't lose a sale because of\nthe concession that Volvo gives to the other dealer, which makes\nthis quite different from every other Robinson-Patman case. Mr.\nPhillips' response was, \"That's today, Your Honor. But our\nfuture ability to compete is impaired.\" Well, that's very\nsimilar to the evidence this Court referred to as \"weak\" in J.\nTruett Payne. The Court didn't go all the way and say that that\nwasn't enough to give rise to damages under section 4 of the\nClayton Act, but the -- but all nine Justices agreed that such\nevidence was very weak. The Fifth Circuit, on remand, threw out\nthe jury verdict, a case that arose in the same posture as this\ncase. And there is not -- as we said in the reply brief, Reeder\nis complaining about price, not price discrimination.\nNow, let me say a word or two about the record. Mr.\nPhillips says the \"Volvo Vision\" was to get rid of dealers, and\nto do so through price discrimination. That is a leap of faith\nthat Reeder asked the jury to make at trial, but there is not an\niota of evidence connecting Volvo's interest in making its\ndealer network smaller and more efficient to price\ndiscrimination. That's entirely a leap of faith. Mr. Phillips\nsays an inference should be made. That's not the kind of\ninference we usually allow juries to draw in antitrust cases\nwithout some evidence.\nThe evidence was actually that Reeder's biggest\ncustomer, New Hi-Way, which was 82 percent of its business, was\nbought by a Memphis company. So, just to point to Reeder's\nbefore-and-after sales is really terribly misleading, in terms\nof causation here between so-called discrimination and the\ndecline in Reeder's business.\nThe so-called 102 sales are four transactions.\nThere's one 77-truck transaction to New Hi-Way before it was\nbought by the Memphis company, and 25 other trucks in the other\nthree transactions. They are all cases in which all Reeder did\nwas take its own completed sales and compare them to sales by\nsome other dealer in some other State. Reeder wasn't competing\nfor the sale to that dealer's customer. That customer wasn't\ncompeting for the sale to Reeder's customer. So it is, as\nJustice Ginsburg's questions pointed out, completely a\nmix-and-match approach.\nAnd Bill Heck conceded that there were times when\nReeder got better concessions than other dealers. If you have a\ncompany that doesn't engage in uniform pricing, as Volvo does\nnot, it's not going to be hard for any plaintiff, whether it's\nReeder or Reeder's competitor, to come up with instances in\nwhich it was the so-called disfavored dealer if it is admissible\nto compare transactions to completely unrelated transactions,\nwhich is what the proof at trial in this case was.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Let me ask you, if you have a\nminute left, is your central point that there was no proof of\ndamages or no proof of injury to competition?\nMR. ENGLERT: Both, Your Honor. They need both.\nThey need --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I know they --\nMR. ENGLERT: In 2(a) --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- need both, but which is your\nprincipal argument?\nMR. ENGLERT: My principal argument is under 2(a),\nbut if I fail on that, I think they fail under Clayton Act,\nsection 4, as well. And --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Your principal argument, that\nthere was no injury to competition.\nMR. ENGLERT: That was the effect of such\ndiscrimination, yes.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Okay. Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel.\n"
