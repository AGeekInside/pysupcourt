VERRILLI, JR.,\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nGENERAL VERRILLI: Mr. Chief Justice, and\nmay it please the Court:\nThe question in this case is whether\nRespondents have standing to bring a facial challenge to\nthe 2008 amendments to the Foreign Intelligence\nSurveillance Act. Those amendments provide authority to\nthe executive to conduct surveillance targeted at\nforeign persons located abroad for foreign intelligence\npurposes.\nAlong with that grant of authority, Congress\nimposed statutory protections designed --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: General, is there\nanybody who has standing?\nAs I read your brief, standing would only\narise at the moment the government decided to use the\ninformation against someone in a pending case. To me,\nthat --\nGENERAL VERRILLI: Several points,\nYour Honor --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- would seem to say\nthat the Act -- if there were a violation; I'm not\nsuggesting there is -- but that if there was a\nconstitutional violation in the interception, that no\none could ever stop it until they were charged with a\ncrime, essentially.\nGENERAL VERRILLI: Your Honor, under the\nstatute, there are two clear examples of situations in\nwhich the individuals would have standing.\nThe first is if an aggrieved person, someone\nwho is a party to a communication, gets notice that the\ngovernment intends to introduce information in a\nproceeding against them. They have standing. That\nstanding could include a facial challenge like the one\nhere.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: General Verrilli, can you\nbe specific on who that person would be? Because, as I\nunderstand it, it's unlikely that, for example, the\nlawyers in this case would be charged with any criminal\noffense. It's more probable that their clients would\nbe; but, according to the government, their clients have\nno Fourth Amendment rights because they are people who\nare noncitizens who acted abroad.\nSo it's hard for me to envision. I see the\ntheoretical possibility, but I don't see a real person\nwho would be subject to a criminal charge who could\nraise an objection.\nGENERAL VERRILLI: Well, if the\ninformation were -- if anyone gets notice, including the\nclient, then the lawyer would know, and the lawyer would\nbe in a position at that point to act.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So the client is somebody\nwho is abroad and who acted abroad, and is not a U.S.\ncitizen.\nGENERAL VERRILLI: That's certainly true.\nBut, in addition, Your Honor, the statute provides that\n-- that electronic communication service providers can\nchallenge authorizations under the Act, so you -- there\ncertainly would be standing in that instance.\nThere was such a case.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: How likely is it that a\nservice provider would object?\nGENERAL VERRILLI: Well, the service\nprovider did object to the immediate statutory\npredecessor to the 2008 amendments. And the -- and the\nFISA court litigated that constitutional challenge. So\nthere's a concrete context there in which it arises.\nBut even -- but beyond that --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And the litigation was\nunsuccessful.\nGENERAL VERRILLI: Well, that's right. The\nCourt found there was no Fourth Amendment violation\nthere.\nBut I think the point here, Your Honor,\nis -- the key point is this, that the -- in a normal\ncase, a plaintiff would challenge the application of the\nauthority to that plaintiff. In a situation like this\none, we acknowledge that it may be difficult for a\nplaintiff to do so because an -- a challenge to the\napplication gets into classified information pretty\nquickly.\nI think what the Respondents have tried to\ndo here is to find a theory of the case that avoids that\ndifficulty.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, using what you just\nmentioned, suppose -- just let's suppose that the Court\nshould hold there is standing. Couldn't the government\nthen say as far as the merits of the complaint, this\ninformation is classified, these are state secrets, we\ncan't -- we can't go forward with the litigation?\nGENERAL VERRILLI: That is a possibility.\nOf course, there's a procedure that the executive branch\nwould have to go through, but that's a possibility.\nBut I don't think we can get to that point,\nYour Honor, because I do think the key point here is\nthat the Respondents' claims about this statute depend\non a cascade of speculation. This statute only grants\nauthority. It doesn't command anything. And in order\nfor the Respondents to make a claim that they are\ninjured, in fact, by this statute --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: General, I don't know\nthat you've answered my question. Perhaps you have, but\nI just want to make sure that I'm clear.\nGiven that lawyers are unlikely to be the\ntargets of an investigation, if they -- if their\nconversations would be intercepted, according to you\nthey'd never have standing.\nGENERAL VERRILLI: I don't think it's\nappropriate, Your Honor, to relax the Article III\nstanding requirement of injury in fact based on the\nreality that the specific applications of this statute\nmay involve classified information.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Verrilli, we've had --\nwe've had cases in the past where it is clear that\nnobody would have standing to challenge what is -- what\nis brought before this Court.\nGENERAL VERRILLI: That's exactly right,\nJustice Scalia.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And we've said that that\njust proves that under our system of separated powers,\nit is none of our business.\nGENERAL VERRILLI: That the Court's\nauthority cannot be invoked in that circumstance. And\nthe mere fact that a specific application requires\ngetting into classified matters can't change that basic\nArticle III requirement.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Is the test that you\npropose that the injury -- I think your brief used the\nword imminent -- is another way of saying that -- is it\nunfair to characterize the government's position as\nsaying that you're submitting that the injury must be\ncertain?\nGENERAL VERRILLI: No. The key point, I\nthink, is narrower than that, Justice Kennedy.\nThis is a case in which the speculation is\nabout the government's conduct, not the connection\nbetween the government action and an ultimate effect on\nthe Plaintiff.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, let's assume --\nlet's assume for the moment that the lawyer would be --\nthat the lawyer would be injured if his communication\nwith the client were intercepted, or at least that he\nwould have standing to prove injury. Let's assume that\nfor the moment.\nIf that is an acceptable premise, assume\nthat it is, are you saying that it has to be certain to\noccur? And another test is there's a reasonable\nlikelihood, and then we get in the middle, is it a\nsubstantial likelihood. You have to say -- you say\nimminent.\nGENERAL VERRILLI: The government conduct\nbeing challenged has to either have occurred or be\ncertainly impending. And here, we have the polar\nopposite, Your Honor. I think it is important to think\nabout --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Certainly impending.\nGENERAL VERRILLI: Certainly impending.\nThat's the language from this Court's opinions.\nAnd I think -- I think, if the Court thinks\nabout it, every single case in which the Court has found\nstanding, there's never been a dispute about whether the\ngovernment was going to act or not; the dispute was only\nabout the connection between the government action and\nthe plaintiff's injury.\nHere, they're fighting about what --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: General Verrilli, but in\nthis case the Complainant can never know. I mean, I\nknow you emphasize the speculative nature of this claim,\nbut it's not speculative if the government being given\nthis authority by Congress is going to use it. Isn't\nthat so?\nI mean, are we to assume that --\nGENERAL VERRILLI: Yes, that's not\nspeculative, Justice Ginsburg, but what is speculative\nis the connection between the grant of authority and a\nclaim of injury. I do think it's important --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Is it -- you were\ntalking -- you wanted to say there's a cascade of\ninferences, I think was your phrase.\nGENERAL VERRILLI: There's a cascade of\nspeculation --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: You want to tell us that\nin your view these -- all these inference that we're\nrequired to go through, if the Respondents' theory is\nadopted, you were going to tell us about --\nGENERAL VERRILLI: I'd like very much to do\nthat. Thank you, Your Honor, yes.\nFirst, the Respondents have to speculate\nabout what the intelligence priorities and objectives of\nthe executive branch are.\nSecond, they have to speculate about how the\nexecutive branch officials are going to exercise their\njudgment to translate those priorities into procedures\nand procedures that comply with the statutory targeting\nand minimization requirements.\nThird, they have to speculate about the\nindependent judgment of an Article III court assessing\nthe lawfulness of those procedures and assessing whether\nthose procedures comply with the Fourth Amendment.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Is there much of a\nspeculation involved in how -- I think it's only one\ntime, and it was under the pre-amended statute, that the\nFISA court ever -- ever turned down an application.\nGENERAL VERRILLI: Yes, but that, Your\nHonor, is, I think, not a fair assessment of the\nprocess. It's really very much an iterative process in\nwhich there's a dialogue between the executive branch\nand the FISA court in which the court can demand more\ninformation, raise objections. Those get worked out,\nand then there's a final order.\nSo I don't think it's fair to infer from the\nfact that there's only one rejection that this -- that\nit's a process that isn't rigorous.\nBut, in addition to the speculation I just\ndescribed, once you get through all that, you still have\nto speculate about whether the communication that --\nwhether the persons with whom the Respondents are\ncommunicating are going to be targeted, and that\nRespondents' communications will get picked up and --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, here is -- I assume\nthat it is an injury for an American speaking in America\nto have his communication intercepted against his will\nby the American government. We take that as a harm; is\nthat right?\nGENERAL VERRILLI: It may be a harm, yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay. So the question is\nhow likely is that to occur?\nGENERAL VERRILLI: No, I think the question\nunder this Court's cases, Your Honor, is whether the\ngovernment is going to take an action that makes that\ncertainly impending.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. Fine. That's\nwhy I say certainly -- it might not be a storm tomorrow.\nI mean, you know, nothing is certain. But I see it's\nsome degree of what you say -- some people say\ncertainly, some people say likelihood, etc. So put that\nto the side.\nWhat I want to know is, we have the\ndeclaration of Mr. Scott McKay. Now, Mr. Scott McKay\nsays he's represented two of the people who are\nallegedly part of al Qaeda and committed crimes, and he\nhas represented them for some time. One was in\nGuantanamo. Another is charged with various crimes and\nis subject to many, many civil suits.\nIn the course of that, he has to phone and\nhas phoned lots of people in Saudi Arabia, in the\nvarious Arab states, and in the past the U.S.\nintercepted some 10,000 telephone calls and\n20,000 e-mail communications involving his client.\nSo isn't it a fair inference, almost pretty\ncertain, maybe about as much as the storm, that if the\nsecurity agencies are doing their job, they will, in\nfact, intercept further communications involving this\nparticular individual, the two that he's representing?\nGENERAL VERRILLI: Actually, Your Honor --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And why doesn't that meet\nthe test?\nGENERAL VERRILLI: -- I think that gets to\nthe last speculative inference that needs to be drawn in\norder for them to make out their chain of causation, and\nit's this: They have to speculate that whatever\nsurveillance occurs will occur under this authority, as\nopposed to other forms of lawful authority that they do\nnot challenge.\nAnd Mr. McKay, that situation is a very good\nexample of this. We point out in footnote 11 at page 32\nof our brief that Mr. McKay says, yes, my client was\nsubjected to 10,000 interceptions of phone calls, 20,000\ninterceptions of e-mails. Every one of those, it's a\nmatter of public record, was under the authority of FISA\nbefore it was amended in 2008 --\nJUSTICE BREYER: But why can't we get an\nanswer to that question? I mean, I see your point. I'm\ninterrupting because I -- I see where you're going. And\nit seems to me that, at least, if held in camera, I\ncan't imagine what security it would violate, whether\nthe government were to say, if necessary privately to a\njudge, would say, no, we do not intend to use this new\nauthority for this purpose.\nGENERAL VERRILLI: But he's just --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Or it could say the\ncontrary. And so couldn't we find out whether he has\nstanding there without jeopardizing any concern of\nnational security?\nGENERAL VERRILLI: I think you can't get\nthere without establishing that there's a case of\ncontroversy. And they haven't --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, there is if, in fact,\nthe government is going to use this statute to continue\nto do some of the 10,000 or 20,000 --\nGENERAL VERRILLI: But this case is at\nsummary judgment now, and the --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes.\nGENERAL VERRILLI: -- Respondents moved for\nsummary judgment based on the declarations that they\nsubmitted. And the declarations that they submitted\ncontain the information I described.\nAnd so the only information that's in front\nof the Court in making a decision now is information\nthat that surveillance occurred under another authority\nthat still exists and could still be applied --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I don't see how that\nis pertinent. What you're saying is they don't have\nstanding to challenge program A because they may also be\ninjured under program B. And do you have an example of\na case where we've held that?\nGENERAL VERRILLI: I think it's -- I think\nthe problem, Mr. Chief Justice, is redressability, in\nthat the argument of the lawyers is that we have a duty\nto incur costs to avoid the surveillance, but that duty\nis triggered by, according to their expert affidavit --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, there again,\nit depends how you phrase their injury. If you phrase\ntheir injury as being subject to surveillance under a\nparticular statutory provision that they think is\nfacially invalid, saying that, well, you're not going to\nget any relief because you're going to be subject to\nsurveillance under a different provision, I mean, they\nmay say, well, we may, or we may not, but we still have\nthe right to cure the injury of being subject to\nsurveillance under 1881a.\nGENERAL VERRILLI: But they still have to\nshow a concrete application of the authority they're\nchallenging. That's what this Court faces --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Do -- do we parse injury\nthat finely? I mean, the injury, it seems to me, is\nbeing overheard. Does it -- by the government. Do we\nsay, oh, well, it's one injury to be overheard under\nthis statute, it's another injury to be overheard under\nanother statute? Do you know any case where we've --\nwe've cut the baloney that fine?\nGENERAL VERRILLI: No, I don't. But -- but\nI do think the redressability point is a valid one.\nThey have to show --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: General Verrilli --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, the thing is they are\ngoing to be injured by being overheard. And you're\nsaying that they will be overheard anyway, and,\ntherefore, by preventing the government from overhearing\nthem under this statute, we're not redressing their\ngrievance, which is being overheard by the government.\nGENERAL VERRILLI: That's precisely what I'm\nsaying.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: But, General Verrilli, this\nstatute greatly expands the government's surveillance\npower. Nobody denies that. And so if the question from\nthese lawyers' perspective is, what chance do I have of\nbeing overheard, and what precautions do I have to take,\nthis statute makes them think about that question in an\nentirely different way, doesn't it?\nGENERAL VERRILLI: Well, I think, as\ncompared to -- let me make two points about that.\nFirst, in terms of the expansion of authority, yes,\nthat's fair with respect to the authority that existed\nimmediately preceding the statute.\nI actually think -- a bit of context is\nrelevant here -- that what this statute was trying to do\nis reset the initial balance that Congress struck under\nFISA in 1978, when the large majority of overseas\ncommunications were carried by satellite and, therefore,\nnot within FISA.\nAnd, of course, what --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Yes, but if you take the\nbaseline position before this statute and the position\nafter this statute, these lawyers and other people in\ntheir situation are going to understand that this is\njust true, that the government is intercepting more\nmaterial, and that they have to take greater precautions\nin order to keep their conversations confidential, if\nthat's what they want to do, which lawyers want to do.\nSo they're going to take precautions that\nthey wouldn't have had to take the day before this\nstatute was passed, it seems to me, just from a kind of\ncommonsensical point of view.\nGENERAL VERRILLI: I don't agree with that,\nJustice Kagan. I think -- this statute does not\nregulate them. It confers authority on the government.\nThey take whatever precautions they choose to take based\non their beliefs about how that authority's going to be\nexercised. That depends on the speculation I described.\nWhat this Court held in Summers is that you\nhave to have a concrete application of the authority in\norder to meet the minimum constitutional requirement for\nArticle III standing.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Now we're back at the\nsame circle we started with, which is the one that\nJustice Breyer started with. He pointed to one person\nunder -- who has been surveilled continuously, tens of\nthousands of interceptions. Can you really say that the\ngovernment's not going to target him under this greater\nauthority that it sought just for the purpose of\nensuring that it casts a broader net?\nGENERAL VERRILLI: I think -- I think it is\nspeculation. I think you do not have a concrete\napplication of this authority against anyone, and\ntherefore you cannot meet the basic Article III\nrequirement of standing that's set forth in Summers.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: I guess I don't see why,\nGeneral Verrilli, this case is any different from\nMonsanto. In Monsanto, the government deregulates\ngenetically modified alfalfa, says, go plant it.\nNow, there were these farmers who were\ncomplaining, and they said, we don't know if that will\ncontaminate our crops or not; we think that there's a\nsignificant risk that it will contaminate our crops.\nBecause we think that there's that significant risk, we\nhave to take precautions.\nNow, why isn't that exactly what's happening\nin this case? We now think, says the -- say the\nlawyers, that there is a significant risk that our\nconversations will be surveilled, a risk that didn't\nexist before. Because of that significant risk, we have\nto take precautions of the exact same kind that the\nfarmers in Monsanto took; therefore, there is standing.\nGENERAL VERRILLI: I think the difference\nbetween this case and Monsanto illustrates our point.\nIf the plaintiff in Monsanto had come into court and\nsaid, Congress has enacted a statute that gives the\ngovernment agency the authority to deregulate\ngenetically modified seeds, we think there is an\nobjectively reasonable likelihood that the government is\ngoing to exercise that authority to deregulate\nalfalfa --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: I don't see that difference\nat all, General Verrilli --\nGENERAL VERRILLI: -- and then --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: -- because, in fact, what\nMonsanto did -- it's not Congress; it's an agency -- but\nthe agency issued a rule saying that farmers could go\nplant genetically modified crops.\nAnd then there was the question whether,\nbecause of that, essentially, delegation of authority,\nthe plaintiffs in that case were going to be burdened.\nAnd the plaintiffs said, you know, we might be harmed,\nand we have to take precautions in order not to be\nharmed.\nSo it's the same thing. It's a different\nactor, but it's a delegation of authority and a -- and a\nfear that that delegation of authority will result in\nharm leading to a set of precautions.\nGENERAL VERRILLI: There is at least two\ndifferences, Justice Kagan, with all due respect.\nFirst, there is an exercise of the\ndelegation of authority in Monsanto that is not present\nhere. Here, there is speculation about how the\nauthority will be exercised.\nSecond, with respect to the authority, the\nrecord in that -- in Monsanto showed the seeds were in\nthe ground, and the only question was a question of\nscientific assessment about the likelihood that the\nplaintiff farmers' crops were going to be affected, and\nthat was a scientific judgment based on the pollination\nradius of the bumblebee, whether it would affect their\ncrops.\nBut what we're talking about here is\nspeculation about how government officials are going to\nexercise policy judgments to implement the statute\nand --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Well, is it really such\nspeculation, General? I mean, just imagine\nthat -- yourself in this lawyer's position, and the\nlawyer says, I'm representing a person associated with a\nterrorist organization, I'm representing KLM in the case\nof one of these lawyers, and I'm going to be talking to\nthat person's family members and associates and trying\nto find out everything that I can.\nNow, as a lawyer, would you take\nprecautions, or would you pick up the phone and start\nwriting e-mails to all those people?\nGENERAL VERRILLI: If I took precautions, it\nwould be because of a belief that I had to comply with\nan ethics rule, and the ethics rule would be the cause\nof me taking those precautions. It doesn't change the\nstandard.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: I don't even think it has to\ndo with an ethics rule. If you're a good lawyer --\nforget the ethics rule and how the ethics rules apply.\nAre you really going to tell me that you, as a lawyer,\nwould just pick up the phone in the face of this statute\nand talk to -- these terrorists' associates?\nGENERAL VERRILLI: Your Honor, it seems to\nme that that hypothetical is a variant of exactly the\nargument that the Court rejected in Summers. There\nisn't a concrete application.\nIn Summers, the Court said, even in a\nsituation where it would be likely that some members of\nthe Sierra Club would be affected by the exercise of\nauthority that the statute conferred, that you cannot --\nyou do not have a case --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: In Summers, the Court\nsaid --\nGENERAL VERRILLI: -- or controversy absent\nthe exercise of the authority.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Excuse me. In Summers, the\nCourt said, well, we don't know that this person is just\ngoing to stumble upon a piece of land that's affected by\nthis government action.\nI asked you a different question. You're a\nlawyer representing a terrorist and talking to the\nterrorist's affiliates, and the question is, is this\nstatute going to make you not use the e-mail in the way\nthat you ordinarily would use the e-mail?\nWell, given the availability of traditional\nFISA surveillance, surveillance under Executive Order\n12333, surveillance by foreign governments, I don't\nthink it depends on this statute.\nBut -- but, in any event, whatever the\nreasonable judgment of a lawyer in those circumstances,\nthere isn't a concrete application of the statute that\ncreates a case or controversy here.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You never know. There\nmay be dozens of concrete applications affecting the\nPlaintiffs in this case, but we will never know.\nGENERAL VERRILLI: Well, I do think the\nproblem here, Justice Ginsburg, really is -- the heart\nof the matter here really is that in a normal lawsuit a\nplaintiff would challenge the application of a statute,\nof the authority conferred under the statute.\nHere, that would run into classified\ninformation. So the Respondents have tried to plead a\ntheory that allows them to avoid that problem. But it\nis inherently based on speculation, and I --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, you think it's\nspeculation. The government has a statute that says you\ncan wiretap in the United States organized crime when\nlife is at stake and you show it to a judge. Then they\nsay, that isn't good enough. We pass a new statute, and\nit says, suppression of organized crime, wiretap when\nyou want, without a judge.\nNow, a lawyer who represents organized crime\nsays, my clients have been wiretapped under the first\nstatute 400,000 times.\nNow, I'll tell you, when the government gets\nahold of this second statute, it's going to be a million\ntimes, because they want to suppress organized crime.\nI'm not saying my clients are guilty, but we all know.\nOkay. So.\nNow, the question, which I haven't thought\nof before, you are saying no standing, no standing,\ncan't raise it --\nGENERAL VERRILLI: In a case like that, the\nlawyer -- the normal course would be for the lawyer to\nchallenge the application of the statute. Here, you\nhave the classified information problem.\nBut I will say --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, you can't. You can't\ndo that here. So -- so what I'm thinking is, he seems\nto be separate from other people. He seems very likely\nto have a concrete injury. If they -- if they aren't\nwiretapping the people who are described here, who are\nthey wiretapping? And they passed this statute in order\nto have extra authority.\nSo put those three things together, and they\nseem to spell mother, perhaps, you know.\nGENERAL VERRILLI: No, they don't.\nAnd the other thing I think that's critical\nhere is that I think Congress was sensitive to the\nprobability that you could not have facial challenges of\nthe kind that Respondents want to bring. And so there\nis an entire --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But you're -- you are\nsaying that the government has obtained this\nextraordinarily wide-reaching power and we have\nextraordinary risks that face this country and the\ngovernment's not going to use it. That's just, it --\nit's hard for me to think that the government isn't\nusing all of the powers at its command under the law --\nGENERAL VERRILLI: I'm not --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- in order to protect\nthis country. And you -- you want to say: Oh, well,\ndon't worry that it's not happening. There is another\nstatute. That -- that's the problem I have with this\nline of argument.\nGENERAL VERRILLI: I -- I'm not saying that\nat all, Justice Kennedy. But it remains the case that\nthe way -- that in order for there to be an Article III\ncase or controversy, a concrete application of that\nauthority has to be demonstrated and it hasn't\nbeen under the theory of the plaintiffs' case.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, it's Justice Kagan's\nhypothetical. The lawyer -- and I don't forget\nabout the -- I think the ethics problem is, is a very\nsubstantial one. I think the lawyer would engage in\nmalpractice if he talked on the telephone with some of\nthese clients, given this statute.\nGENERAL VERRILLI: And -- and I think it\nwould be the ethics rule that caused the lawyer to take\nthose steps, not the statute. He would still have the\nsame inferences.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But it's still the\nreality. He still has to change his conduct.\nGENERAL VERRILLI: I would like to make one\nmore point, if I could, Justice Kennedy, that I think\ngoes to this and then I would like to reserve the\nbalance of my time.\nCongress was aware of the difficultly that\n-- of bringing facial challenges, and so Congress put\ninto place an alternative structure of accountability\nhere. There are -- this is not unbounded authority.\nThere are targeting requirements, minimization\nrequirements, certification by the highest level --\nhighest levels of the executive, and there is\nindependent review by an Article III judge to ensure\ncompliance not only with the statute, but also with the\nFourth Amendment, and there is ample congressional\noversight. So it's not the case that this is a\nfree-ranging authority at all.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, General.\nMr. Jaffer.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMEEL JAFFER\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. JAFFER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nPlaintiffs have standing here because there\nis a substantial risk that their communications will be\nacquired under the Act and because this substantial risk\nhas effectively compelled them to take immediate\nmeasures to protect information that is sensitive or\nprivileged. Plaintiffs are lawyers, journalists and\nhuman rights researchers who routinely engage in\ncommunications that the Act is designed to allow the\ngovernment to acquire. Plaintiffs communicate, for\nexample, foreign intelligence information, the kind of\ninformation that the statute expressly authorizes the\ngovernment to collect, to retain and disseminate.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Our cases, of\ncourse, say, do say \"certainly impending,\" not\n\"substantial risk.\"\nMR. JAFFER: Well, Your Honor, I think that\nthere is a -- a question even in cases that involve only\na future injury, whether \"certainly impending\" is in\nfact the standard. But leaving that to the side, this\nis not a case that involves only an allegation of future\ninjury. Our --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, let's leave that\naside. You have two arguments; one is likelihood of\nfuture injury and the other is present obligations or\ncause. I want to focus on the former. Our standard is\ncertainly impending, and you articulated it by saying,\nsubstantial risk. There is obviously a vast difference\nbetween those two.\nMR. JAFFER: Well, I don't think, Your\nHonor, that the Court has settled on certainly\nimpending. The cases that the -- the government cites\nare cases like -- I think that the one that the\ngovernment cites, relies on most heavily is Summers.\nBut in Summers, the distinction between likelihood and\ncertainly impending was not one that the Court relied on\nin -- in that decision. The Court said that plaintiffs\ncouldn't meet even the lower standard. So I think that\nthe discussion of certainly impending --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But both in Summers and\nMonsanto the government tells us: We knew that the\ngovernmental act was occurring, and then once we knew\nthat, the question was substantial risk.\nMR. JAFFER: Justice Kennedy, the -- the --\nthe cases that we rely on, Monsanto, Laidlaw,\nMeese v. Keene, these are cases in which the Court\ndidn't look to the certainly impending standard at all.\nThe question that the Court asked in those cases was:\nIs there a substantial risk? Is there a substantial\nrisk that effectively compels the plaintiff to act in\nthe way they are -- they are acting?\nYou are right that the government points out\nthis distinction in Monsanto. They say Monsanto is a\ncase in which the government was actually doing\nsomething, was known to -- to be doing something. But\neven, in this case, first of all, we know that the\ngovernment is using the statute. They have acknowledged\nthat they are using the statute. So there -- there is a\ncertainty of government conduct.\nBut aside from that, those cases like\nMonsanto and Laidlaw and Meese are not cases that --\nthat actually turned on the fact that the government was\ndoing something. They are cases that turned on the fact\nthat there was a substantial risk of future injury, and\nthe substantial risk compelled plaintiffs to do\nsomething immediately.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's not enough, of\ncourse, to know that the government is using the\nstatute. The whole question is whether or not your\nclients have been injured, not whether the statute's\nbeing used.\nMR. JAFFER: I -- I agree with that. I\ndon't think it would be enough for a plaintiff to walk\ninto court and say the government is using the statute\nand therefore we have standing. But our plaintiffs are\nnot in that position. Our plaintiffs --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, I have an\nissue --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry, do you\nwant to finish? If it's all right, could you finish the\nanswer?\nMR. JAFFER: Sure. I was just going to say\nthat our -- our plaintiffs have -- have reasons to\nbelieve that their own communications will be monitored\nunder the statute. One relates to the kind of\ninformation that they routinely exchange over the phone\nand by e-mail, foreign intelligence information. But\nit's also that -- that plaintiffs communicate with the\nkinds of people the government is likely to -- to\nmonitor under the statute.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Does that assessment take\ninto account the fact that a court is going to pass upon\nthe government's ability to intercept these\ncommunications?\nMR. JAFFER: It does, Justice Scalia. I\nmean you -- you are right that there is a court that in\nsome sense stands between plaintiffs and the future\ninjury that they -- that they fear.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: With the obligation to\napply the Fourth Amendment.\nMR. JAFFER: I don't think it's that simple.\nThe -- the -- the court, the FISA court, is tasked with\nassessing the reasonableness of targeting and\nminimization procedures. But the statute itself\nforecloses the court from imposing the kinds of limits\nthat plaintiffs think the Fourth Amendment requires. So\nfor example, the statute itself in section (g)(4) says\nthat the government is not required to identify the\nfacilities to be monitored. And the statute itself in\ndefining targeting procedures defines them to be\nprocedures intended to ensure that the targets are\noutside the United States.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But if as you say those\nprocedures violate the Fourth Amendment, it doesn't\nmatter what the statute says.\nMR. JAFFER: Well, the Court would have\nto --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: If those statutory\nprovisions would produce a violation of the Fourth\nAmendment, they are null and void, right?\nMR. JAFFER: Well, I think that's right.\nThe -- the court --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. So the FISA Court\nwould presumably know that.\nMR. JAFFER: Well, I think if that had\nhappened over the last 4 years, the government wouldn't\nbe seeking reauthorization of the statute now. But even\napart from that --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Jaffer, could you be\nclear on the expanded authority under the FAA? As I\nunderstood it, it's not like in the old statute, where a\ntarget was identified and FISA decided whether there\nwas -- the court decided whether there was probable\ncause. Under this new statute, the government doesn't\nsay who the particular person or the particular\nlocation. So, there isn't that check. There isn't that\ncheck.\nMR. JAFFER: That's absolutely right,\nJustice Ginsburg. There -- the whole point of the\nstatute was to remove those tests, to remove the\nprobable cause requirement, and to remove the facility\nof requirement, the requirement that the government\nidentify to the court the facilities to be monitored.\nSo those are gone.\nThat's why we use the phrase \"dragnet\nsurveillance.\" I know the government doesn't accept\nthat label, but it concedes that the statute allows what\nit calls categorical surveillance, which -- which --\nwhich is essentially the surveillance the plaintiffs\nhere are concerned about.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could you address --\nJUSTICE ALITO: If we accept the -- if we\nassume for the sake of argument that \"certainly\nimpending\" is the, the general standard, if we accepted\nyour other argument, that the plaintiffs have standing\nbecause they took preventative measures, wouldn't that\nundermine completely the -- the \"certainly impending\"\nstandard? You have a person who is in a situation where\nthere is a certain risk, a certain degree of risk of --\nof the person's conversation being intercepted, but it's\nnot certainly impending. So then the person simply\ntakes some preventative measures, and acquires standing\nthat wouldn't otherwise be present.\nMR. JAFFER: I don't think it would\nundermine the -- the future injuries standard, Your\nHonor, for a couple of different reasons. The first is\nthat \"fairly traceable,\" which is the standard that the\nCourt has used when there is an actual injury, is a\nstandard that does real work.\nSo if plaintiffs, for example, were acting\nunreasonably in taking the measures they are taking, if\nplaintiffs were gratuitously buying flight tickets, they\ncouldn't create standing out of nothing. It would have\nto be a reasonable reaction to the risk.\nBut the other thing is, and this is just to\ngo back to sort of the -- the basic standing --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me, before we go\nfurther. A reasonable reaction to the risk; but it\ndoesn't have to be a reasonable reaction to a certainly\nimpending risk, does it?\nMR. JAFFER: You are right, Justice Scalia.\nIt doesn't, on -- on our theory.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But that's his question.\nDoesn't it undermine the certainly impending?\nMR. JAFFER: And the only point I was trying\nto make is that if there is a distance between these two\nstandards, it's a -- it's a pretty narrow distance. But\nthe other point I want to make is just that the\nreason -- to the extent the Court has imposed a higher\nstandard for cases involving only future injury -- and\nagain, we don't concede that the Court has imposed a\nhigher standard, but to the extent it has, it has done\nso because it wants to assure itself that the future\ninjury is sufficiently concrete to warrant the Court's\nintervention.\nBut if there's an actual injury, the Court\nis assured of concreteness. The actualness of the\ninjury makes the case concrete on its own. And so I\nthink that the standards do different work. I don't\nthink it's a question of an end-run around the imminent\nstandard. It's a question of the Court assuring itself\nthat there is a concrete case before it.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Jaffer, it seems to me\nthat your -- the government's strongest argument goes\nsomething like this -- and I don't think that they would\nsay it in these words, but you have some clients where\nit actually does seem completely reasonable that they\nwould take precautions, that they would not get on the\nphone, and that they would not use e-mail in the way\nthat any old person would.\nBut just -- those clients, these lawyers of\nterrorists, essentially shouldn't be using that e-mail\nor getting on the phone anyway. Even before the FAA was\npassed, they would have been wise and, indeed, maybe\nethically required to use precautions.\nSo what does the FAA do? I guess this is a\npoint about redressability, it's a point about --\nMR. JAFFER: Right.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: -- causation, but that seems\nto me the strongest of the government's arguments.\nMR. JAFFER: Well, Justice Kagan, this is\nsomething that the declarations address specifically,\nthe distinction between the burden imposed by FISA,\ntraditional FISA, and the -- the burden imposed by the\nnew statute.\nAnd it's true that the old -- under the old\nstatute, plaintiffs were required to take precautions\nwith respect to a subset of their communications. And\nthey acknowledge that in their declarations.\nBut the new statute reaches whole categories\nof people who couldn't have been reached under FISA.\nFISA had a probable cause requirement. It had to be a\nforeign agent on one end of the phone. And so when one\nof the lawyers in this case was talking to somebody who\nthey thought the government might believe to be a\nforeign agent, they took those precautions even before.\nBut now they have to take those\nprecautions -- some of which are very costly -- they\nhave to take those precautions with respect to people\nwho are, for example, witnesses overseas, of journalists\noverseas or human rights researchers overseas. As Scott\nMcKay says in his declaration, with respect to every\nsingle international communication, I have to make an\nassessment of the risk that the government --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Do you have specifics in the\naffidavits of things that your clients would have done\npreviously that they cannot do now?\nMR. JAFFER: Yes, Your Honor. So, for\nexample -- well, I'm not sure that this goes directly to\nyour question, but in the McKay affidavit, as well as in\nthe Sylvia Royce affidavit -- Sylvia Royce is another\none of the attorney plaintiffs in this case -- both of\nthose Plaintiffs discuss the additional burden of the\nFAA. They talk about measures that they are taking\nbecause of the FAA specifically. And they mention the\nkinds of communications they're having with people who\ncould not reasonably be thought to be foreign agents.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What other measures\nbesides having to travel to have conversations?\nMR. JAFFER: I think it's a spectrum,\nJustice Ginsburg. It begins with just being more\ncircumspect on the telephone, and it goes to, for\nexample, talking in generalities rather than specifics.\nLet me see if I can give you actual\ncitations for these. So -- so -- so, the Plaintiffs\nhave in some cases been deterred from communicating over\ne-mail or the phone. Chris Hedges discusses that at\n366a of the appendix; Scott McKay discusses it at 371a.\nIn some instances, the Plaintiffs have\ntalked in generalities rather than specifics. Sylvia\nRoyce at 352a.\nIn some instances, it has even required\nPlaintiffs to travel overseas to gather information that\nthey might otherwise --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, the travel overseas\nI understand is the one thing that has a dollar amount\nattached to it.\nMR. JAFFER: Right.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But these others -- these\nother precautions, being more circumspect in their\nquestions, talking in generalities --\nMR. JAFFER: There is no dollar cost,\nJustice Ginsburg --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes.\nMR. JAFFER: -- but there is a professional\ncost. And I don't think it's -- it shouldn't be hard to\nunderstand the professional cost. If a lawyer is --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Can you go back to being\na little bit more specific on this? I think I got it.\nThere is a class of people that they would\nhave spoken to on the phone or e-mailed before because\nthey didn't think they would be covered by other\nsurveillance measures --\nMR. JAFFER: That's right,\nJustice Sotomayor.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- that were in effect\nbefore this Act?\nMR. JAFFER: That's right. The --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Can you talk about what\nkinds of people those are? Because if the targets are\nalways terrorists --\nMR. JAFFER: Right. No. Right. Under this\nstatute, there's no requirement that the target be a\nterrorist or a foreign agent, right?\nSo under this statute, every time, for\nexample, Sylvia Royce has to make a phone call with\nsomebody overseas about the representation of somebody\nthat she is representing, she needs to make an\nassessment about the sensitivity of the information,\nabout the ways that information might be used against\nher client.\nSo, for example, if she is talking to a\njournalist in Afghanistan about the detention of one of\nher prisoners at Bagram Air Base, that is a conversation\nthat could not plausibly have been picked up under FISA,\nbut it's a conversation that could be picked up under\nthe FAA.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, it seems to\nme that the concern you're talking about is present in\nevery area of practice. If you're representing someone\nwho is being prosecuted, you don't send an e-mail\nsaying, you know, the government hasn't yet asked where\nyou threw the gun, and we've got to be prepared to\nanswer questions on that because, as you know, that's a\nreal probable.\nI mean, you don't send messages like that\nthrough the e-mails or just talk casually over the phone\neither.\nMR. JAFFER: I think that's -- that's right,\nMr. Chief Justice, that, to some extent, this exists in\nevery area of practice.\nBut this is a statute that is focused on\ngathering foreign intelligence information, and our\nclients include lawyers who represent defendants charged\nwith foreign intelligence-related crimes.\nAnd this statute, I think for good reason,\nmakes them especially concerned about the communications\nthey are engaged in with people overseas who couldn't\nhave been covered under FISA, but who are covered under\nthis statute.\nIf I could just address --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Could I go back to a\nquestion that Justice Breyer asked, where he used the\nanalogy of a lawyer who is representing someone who is\nalleged to be an organized crime figure.\nSuppose you have a case where a lawyer says,\nI represent so and so, the government thinks this person\nis an organized crime kingpin, I know the government has\na very extensive wiretapping program for people who fall\ninto this category, I want to raise -- I want to\nchallenge the constitutionality of the statute under\nwhich some of this wiretapping occurs. Would that\nperson have stand -- would that lawyer have standing?\nMR. JAFFER: I think so. I think so,\nJustice Alito. I mean, assuming that the lawyer could\nestablish that there was a substantial risk that his\ncommunications would be -- would be monitored, and that\nthe substantial risk had compelled him to take measures\nimmediately, I think that lawyer would have standing.\nWhether he would have a claim is a different\nquestion, but I think he would have standing.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Do you know of any case that\nholds that?\nMR. JAFFER: Well, I think that -- I don't\nthink it's a novel proposition. I think that in every\none of -- for example, in a case like Skinner, which was\na challenge to the rules that allowed for blood tests of\nrailway employees who had been in a -- in accidents,\nthat was a facial challenge brought to the statute, and\nnobody questioned standing in that case.\nJUSTICE ALITO: The Federal wiretapping\nstatute has been around for 40 years. Has there been a\nsingle case that falls into this category that you're\ntalking about?\nMR. JAFFER: No, but I think that that --\nthat there's a good reason for that, which is under\nTitle III people who are monitored get notice. There is\na notice provision, a general notice provision. And so\nit doesn't -- you know, and people don't have to worry\nthat this is going on secretly.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, there is a notice\nprovision under this statute.\nMR. JAFFER: Only for prosecutions, right?\nOnly for prosecutions. And the government has made\nclear that it's not going to -- that the main purpose of\nthis statute is not to gather evidence for law\nenforcement --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I think the -- which I\nthink is difficult, because it makes this case somewhat\nunique, so that what you're worried about most is the\ndefinition of foreign intelligence information, which\ndefines it to include information with respect to a\nforeign power or foreign territory that relates to the\nconduct of foreign affairs. It's very general.\nMR. JAFFER: That --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And then, the\nAttorney General can, if he decides there are exigent\ncircumstances, wiretap for a year, anyway, without going\nto any court, something that isn't true of the ordinary\nwiretapping.\nNow, you say, look, if there is any special\ngroup that's going to apply to, that is the group that\nthey wiretapped 10,000 times when they didn't even have\nthat authority. And the government is saying, maybe,\nmaybe not. And there, we have an argument.\nIs there a way of resolving it? That is, is\nit open to the government, if you prevail, and we say,\nyou know, they have this extra broad authority, there is\nno way to check it through a court, it does cause harm,\nthese are the most likely people to be harmed and there\nis very good reason, whatever words we use there, to\nthink it will be used for them, that the government --\nis there some way the government could say, in camera\neven, no, we are not doing it? Here are our procedures.\nWe are not going to show them to anybody but you, judge.\nI mean, is there a way for the government to\nshow that you're wrong --\nMR. JAFFER: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- and that we're wrong\nwhen we think you're right?\nMR. JAFFER: Yes. Absolutely.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What?\nMR. JAFFER: If the government were to walk\ninto court either today or after the remand that we are\nasking for, if the government were to walk into court\neither in camera or -- or -- or not and say that\nplaintiffs will never be monitored under this statute, I\nthink the case would be over. Plaintiffs -- plaintiffs\nare here not because they have a general complaint about\nthe statute, but because they're actually -- they're\ninjured by it, and they're -- they -- they --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, the plaintiffs\naren't going to be monitored under the statute. Other\npeople are, and your concern is collateral, that the\nplaintiffs' discussions might be picked up. But the\nplaintiffs are not going to be monitored as targets.\nMR. JAFFER: Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I\ndon't think that's exactly right. I know that the\nstatute says that the government has to target people\nabroad, but in targeting people abroad the government is\ncollecting plaintiffs' communications. So, you know,\nthis isn't a situation where plaintiffs are entirely --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's why I'm\nsaying under your circumstances -- what you said is the\ngovernment could come in and say: We're not going to\nmonitor these people. Under the statute, you can say\nthat today. The question is whether or not your\nclients' conversations can be picked up in an incidental\nway.\nMR. JAFFER: Right. I -- I guess I'm\ndisagreeing with the word \"incidental.\" It's -- the\nwhole point of this statute was to allow the government\nto collect Americans' international communications.\nThe -- the executive officials threatened a presidential\nveto when it was proposed that Americans' communications\nshould be segregated in some way, that in the district\ncourt the government was very upfront about this, that\nthe statute's whole purpose was to regulate the -- the\nsurveillance of Americans' international communications.\nSo there is a sense in which Americans --\nthe surveillance of Americans is incidental, but it's\na --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Isn't what you just\nsuggested as a way of resolving this case rather\nbizarre? Someone who is -- whom the government believes\nto be a top terrorist and a great threat to the country\ncan stop the use of this surveillance by hiring an\nAmerican lawyer and then having the American lawyer come\ninto court and say -- you know, challenge the\nconstitutionality of this, and the way to resolve the\ncase would be for the government to go into court and\nsay: Well, we're not going to -- we're not going to\ntarget this -- this person whom we believe to be a great\nsecurity threat?\nMR. JAFFER: I -- I didn't mean to suggest\nsomething like that, Justice Alito. You know,\nultimately, the authority that the government has\nclaimed under this statute is what requires the\nplaintiffs to take the measures that they're taking.\nAnd I suppose that if all the government were to do at\nthis point is to say secretly to a judge, \"We're not\nactually going to use this against plaintiffs,\"\nplaintiffs would have to take the same measures they're\ntaking right now. And they would be injured in exactly\nthe same way. What --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: To that point, you're\nconceding the government's position that -- on\nredressability?\nMR. JAFFER: No, not at all, Justice --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That even if they\npromise you they weren't going to intercept you under\nthis statute, that you would still take the same\nmeasures?\nMR. JAFFER: No, no, I wasn't talking about\nthe other programs. I was just saying that plaintiffs'\ninjuries flow from the authority that they're -- that\nthey're claiming under the statute. And if the\ngovernment were to have a secret -- you know, if there\nwere some sort of secret government memo that said\nplaintiffs will not in fact be surveilled, their\ncommunications won't be picked up, if plaintiffs don't\nknow about that change to the government's authority,\nthey're going to have to take the same measures that\nthey're taking.\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's on that branch of\nyour argument, which makes me more nervous than the\nother branch. The other branch, they might say\nsomething like: We're supposed to minimize risks of\ncatching in surveillance Americans and this is what we\ndo. And they show that and they say: We go to the FISA\ncourt. Except in these very rare instances where there\nare emergencies, da, da, da.\nAnd I guess by that point they might be able\nto reduce the risks to this kind of plaintiff to where\nit's the same as virtually anybody else or they might\nbe -- be showing it's constitutional. That's where I --\nthat's why I ask the question. I'm not certain of where\nI am going.\nMR. JAFFER: So -- so maybe it's helpful to\nthink of the -- the cases involving pre-enforcement\nchallenges. So you think -- think of a case like\nAmerican Book Sellers Association, which we cite on I\nthink page 55 of our brief, the case in which there's\nuncertainty about how the government is going to\nimplement the authority. Nobody knows whether this\nparticular plaintiff is going to be prosecuted. In\nfact, in that case nobody knew whether anybody would be\nprosecuted. But the authority was out there and the\nfact that the authority was out there, the government\nhadn't disclaimed it, plaintiffs were required to take\nimmediate measures to conform their behavior to the\nstatute, and plaintiffs -- some of the injury there\nrelated to the kind of self-censorship that the Court\nhas always been especially concerned about in First\nAmendment cases.\nAll of those things led the Court to find\nthat plaintiffs had standing to bring a pre-enforcement\nchallenge. And the kind of uncertainty that the\ngovernment says is present here, uncertainty about how\nthe government will actually implement the statute is\nthe same kind of uncertainty that is present in every\nsingle pre-enforcement challenge.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Jaffer, apart -- apart\nfrom the government's power that you point out to\nconduct some of this surveillance without approval by\nthe FISA court in an emergency situation for 1 year,\nleaving that aside, I don't see how the rest of your\nchallenge or your challenge to the remainder of this\nstatute can be characterized as a facial challenge,\nbecause it necessarily assumes that the FISA court will\nmistakenly say that there has been no Fourth Amendment\nviolation, doesn't it?\nMR. JAFFER: I don't think that's so,\nJustice Scalia. Our concern is not -- not that -- that\nthe FISA court will make mistakes, although it well\nmight. The concern -- the main concern is that the\nreasonableness inquiry that the FISA court engages in is\na narrowly cabined one. They court can't say this is\nunreasonable because you haven't identified the\nfacilities. They can't say this is unreasonable because\nyou haven't identified a specific target.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it -- it can say it's\nunreasonable because you have unreasonably limited us.\nDon't you think the FISA court is able to say, what\nwe're allowed to look into under this statute does not\ncomport with the Fourth Amendment.\nMR. JAFFER: I think in --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: We have to look into more.\nMR. JAFFER: Right. I think it's within the\nrealm of -- -- of the conceivable that -- that the court\ncould essentially subvert the statute in that way or\nfind it unconstitutional, but the government would not\nbe pressing for reauthorization now, and plaintiffs have\nto act on the basis of the authority that is delineated\nin this Federal law. And plaintiffs see that there's a\nlaw that is designed to allow the government to mine\nAmericans' international communications for foreign\nintelligence information. The plaintiffs are people who\nreport on war zones or they investigate human rights\nabuses in places like Syria and Lebanon and the Yemen\nand the Sudan, places where the government is likely to\nuse this power. And plaintiffs include people who\nrepresent defendants who've been charged in -- in --\nterrorism crime and foreign intelligence-related crimes.\nAnd so they --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: I'm sorry.\nMR. JAFFER: In our view, they act entirely\nreasonably in taking the measures they're taking and\nthey are effectively compelled in the same way that the\nplaintiffs in Monsanto, in Laidlaw in -- in -- in\nMeese v. Keene were effectively compelled to take the\nmeasures that they -- that they were taking.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Jaffer, you mentioned\nyour journalist clients. Do you have any affidavits or\nanything else in the record to suggest that those\njournalists have simply not gotten information from\nthird parties that they otherwise would have gotten? In\nother words, this would not be a question of what\nprecautions they took and what precautions were\nreasonable.\nMR. JAFFER: Right.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: But if you assume that\ninformation is the lifeblood of journalism, that their\nsources and their information has dried up as a result\nof this statute.\nMR. JAFFER: Yes, Justice Kagan. Naomi\nKlein's declaration at page 338A addresses that. I\nbelieve that Chris Hedges' declaration addresses it too,\nalthough I don't have a page citation for you. It's\ncertainly in the lawyers' affidavits that some third\nparties are less willing to share information, Sylvia\nRoyce, 353A.\nSo -- so -- so the declarations were filed\nearly, it was a summary judgment motion, they were filed\nrelatively early. So to some extent, they are making\npredictions about how third parties will -- will react,\nbut I think it's an entirely fair prediction to -- to\npredict that third parties who believe that the\ncommunications are being surveilled will react in the\nway you just described. And although it's not in the\nrecord, we -- we have spoken to our journalist clients\nmore recently and they have told us that their\npredictions have actually been realized in some cases.\nJust to go to -- to -- to address the --\nthe -- the Monsanto point -- point once more. I mean, I\nunderstand the Court's -- that the Court has to struggle\nwith the distinction between cases that involve only\nfuture injuries and cases that involve present injuries\nas well. I think it's just important to recognize that\nthe Court has never found the kinds of present injuries\nthat we are pointing to here to be irrelevant to the\nanalysis.\nIn Monsanto, in Laidlaw, in Meese, in\nCamreta, the Court looked to -- looked to the present\ninjuries as well as to the likelihood of -- of -- of\nfuture harm. And we are not making an argument that we\nare entitled to a lower -- lower standing -- to lower\nstanding requirements or less stringent requirements\nthan the Court has applied in other cases.\nJUSTICE ALITO: But in Monsanto, suppose the\nchallenge had been brought by a soybean farmer who said,\n\"I raise soybeans and people around me raise soybeans,\nI'm afraid that they're going to start planting\ngenetically modified soybeans, but they haven't done it\nup to this point, but, you know, this might be something\nthey will do in the future and if they do that, then I'm\ngoing to have to take precautions.\"\nMR. JAFFER: I think that would be a much\nharder case than the one that they've brought. I mean,\nin part because the Plaintiff would presumably know\nwhen -- when the soybeans had been -- had been planted,\nand the Plaintiff would then have an opportunity to come\ninto court.\nAnd it would be hard to -- to establish, I\nthink, a substantial risk in those circumstances where\nthe Plaintiff couldn't point to any evidence that --\nthat any action had been taken towards the\nimplementation of this policy that -- that he feared.\nBut in our case, again, the government has\nconceded that the statute is being used. It's\nconceded -- or it's acknowledged that the statute has\nbeen used to collect Americans' communications.\nIt's true that we don't know that our\nPlaintiffs specifically have been monitored, and we will\nnever know that. But that kind of uncertainty was --\nwas present in Monsanto and in --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Maybe it's a\ndifference in how we're using the word monitor. You do\nknow that your Plaintiffs have not been monitored.\nMR. JAFFER: Been targeted.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What you\ndon't -- well, others have been monitored abroad, right?\nMR. JAFFER: I don't --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You're not monitored\nin the sense that this is the person's e-mail, and\nthat's what we're going to collect information from,\nright?\nMR. JAFFER: Well, what -- what happens is\nthat the government identifies some category of targets\nabroad. In the course of collecting --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right.\nMR. JAFFER: -- those targets'\ncommunications, they collect Americans' international\ncommunications. And when they're collecting Americans'\ninternational communications, they are monitoring those\ncommunications.\nThe statute allows the government to acquire\nthem, to retain them, to disseminate them. It\nrequires -- even if it's not foreign intelligence\ninformation, which is, as Justice Breyer says --\nrecognized, is defined very broadly -- the statute\nallows the government to disseminate that information,\njust redacting the Americans' name.\nThe statute also allows the government to --\nto retain evidence of criminal activity. And for\ncriminal defense lawyers, that's -- that's a -- it's a\nreal issue.\nSo you're right that -- that our\ncommunications are not being targeted, but they are\nbeing monitored.\nI see my time has expired.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nGeneral Verrilli, you have four minutes\nremaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD B. VERRILLI, JR.,\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nGENERAL VERRILLI: Thank you,\nMr. Chief Justice.\nTwo specific points and then three broader\npoints.\nFirst, Justice Kagan, with respect to the\nNaomi Klein declaration, what it says on page 338a is,\n\"Some of my sources will decline to share information\nwith me if they believe that their communications are\nbeing monitored by the United States.\"\nJUSTICE KAGAN: That's a fair point,\nGeneral. What if it said something different? What if\nshe said -- what if there were even an affidavit from\nthe source saying, \"I have stopped talking with this\njournalist because of the FAA and because of my fear\nthat my communications will be intercepted\"?\nGENERAL VERRILLI: I think you'd still have\nthe problem of speculation there.\nAnd if I could, Justice Breyer, go to your\nproposed solution. I don't think it's a solution. I\nthink it's a mechanism for people who think they may be\nunder surveillance, foreign terrorists who think they\nmay be under surveillance, to find out whether they are\nor not. I -- I just don't think that's a workable\nsolution at all.\nNow, three broader points, if I may.\nFirst, the -- in every case in which the\nCourt has found standing, every one on which the\nRespondents rely, the government conduct either happened\nor was certain to happen.\nIn Meese against Keene, the films had been\nlabeled as political propaganda. It wasn't a question\nabout how authority to do so would be exercised. In\nLaidlaw, the permit had issued, and the pollution was in\nthe water. There wasn't speculation about that.\nMonsanto, we already talked about; the\ngovernment action was certain. That's true in every\ncase.\nAnd Summers drew a distinction with those\ncases because, in Summers, there was no example of a\nconcrete application of the authority.\nSecond, their -- the fact that some of their\nclients may take steps that incur costs doesn't change\nthe injury. It's still speculative. It's the kind of\nsubjective chill that Laird said was -- was not\nsufficient to establish standing.\nAnd I think, if you take a step back,\nthink -- ask -- think about what they're asking you to\ndo. They are asking you to invalidate a vitally\nimportant national security statute based not on a\nconcrete application --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: No, General Verrilli, this\nis not about the merits of the statute. They might have\nno claim on the merits at all, and so there would be no\nquestion of invalidation. The question is only: Can\nthey make their argument to a court?\nGENERAL VERRILLI: But the whole point,\nJustice Kagan, the basic, most fundamental point about\nthe case or controversy requirement and the\ninjury-in-fact requirement that is embedded in it is to\npreserve the separation of powers.\nThey are asking the Court to consider\ninvalidating the statute based on an assumption either\nthat there is dragnet surveillance or an assumption\nthat their clients are going to be put under\nsurveillance, without a single fact to substantiate\neither of those assumptions.\nI submit to the Court that it would be --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Which they can never,\nnever have, and that's what makes this -- if -- if there\ncould be a person in this category who would know, but\nthe person will never know.\nYou did mention minimization procedures as\none safeguard against abuse. What are the minimum --\nwhat -- what minimization standards are taken that will\nprotect plaintiffs in this class?\nGENERAL VERRILLI: It's a little bit hard to\ntalk about, Your Honor, because, to the extent we're\ntalking about the process of acquiring foreign\nintelligence, that's a very sensitive intelligence\nmethod; and, to the extent minimization plays into that,\nit's -- it's not public information.\nBut there are some steps that are publicly\nknown, and they are, for example, that information\nacquired can be retained only for certain limited\nperiods of time; that whenever -- when reports are done\non information, that the names of U.S. persons or\ncorporations are redacted. There are other restrictions\non the ability to use the information. So there are\nsteps of that nature.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Are there restrictions on\ngiving the information to other government agencies, in\nparticular, the Justice Department?\nGENERAL VERRILLI: Well, that -- that --\nagain, Your Honor, there are procedures that govern\nthose issues. They're not public procedures, but there\nare procedures that govern those issues, yes.\nBut -- but, I do -- I understand the point,\nYour Honor, but I do think that's why Congress\nestablished this alternative structure of\naccountability, with the statutory protections, with the\nFISA court review, including review for conformity with\nthe Fourth Amendment, with very robust reporting\nrequirements, semiannual reporting requirements -- I see\nmy time's expired.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nAnd so the case is submitted.\n(Whereupon, at 11:04
