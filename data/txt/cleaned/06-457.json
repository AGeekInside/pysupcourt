New Hampshire Motor\nTransport Association.\nMr. Stern.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL STERN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. STERN: Chief Justice, and may it please\nthe Court:\nCongress has left to the States and\nencouraged them to deal with the significant public\nhealth problem of youth access to tobacco. The question\npresented is whether the FAAA Act nonetheless preempts\nthe two State laws before the Court and those laws that\nensure that tobacco shipped into the State of Maine does\nnot end up in the hands of our children.\nIt is not contested that Maine can and, in\nfact, has banned the retail sale of tobacco unless the\nseller verifies the age of the buyer. Section\n1555-C(3)(C) regulates the seller and not a carrier. It\nrequires that a -- in the context of a delivery sale, a\nseller cannot engage in that sale in the State of Maine\nunless the seller ensures that the person delivering the\ntobacco actually verifies the age of the buyer. This\nlaw does not relate to the services of the carrier, but\nrather relates to a dangerous substance that Congress\nhas asked the States and left to the States and\nencouraged the States to deal with.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, certainly that\nmay be true, but it certainly relates to the service of\na carrier. I understood your argument to be that we\ncan't read that language literally.\nMR. STERN: Exactly --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It talks about what\ncarriers have to do, so -- in connection with delivery,\nso it relates to the service of the motor carrier.\nMR. STERN: Well, Your Honor, section 1555-C\n(3)(C) does not dictate at all what a carrier has to do.\nIt is an incentive that permits a carrier, if the\ncarrier wishes to compete on a level playing field for\nthe legal tobacco delivery market --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It doesn't dictate\nwhat they have to do. They can get out of the business.\nMR. STERN: They can get out of the business\nor compete for the business, Your Honor. But the point\nis that the law regulates the retailer and not the\ncarrier and, in doing so, similar to the situation in\nTravelers, allows for a market to be created.\nIn particular, however, with respect to this\nparticular situation, Congress has spoken directly to it\nand this Court has considered in the context of its\nERISA cases how Congress has dealt specifically with the\nproblem before the Court.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, we also\nconsidered it in Morales, and I thought this law was\nenacted in the immediate wake of Morales, which adopted\na much broader reading of \"relates to\" than the\nsubsequent ERISA cases.\nMR. STERN: We don't agree that it adopted\nsuch a broad view because in Morales the Court was very\ncareful in the opinion to make clear that it was not\ndrawing a line which would bring potentially such laws\ndealing with gambling or prostitution within the\npreemptive ambit of the ADA. Similarly, in -- with\nrespect to the FAA Act, particularly looking at the\nlegislative history, there is no indication that\nCongress intended in any way to deal with the State's\ncontrolling and regulating dangerous substances such as\ntobacco.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But isn't that answering\nthe wrong question? I'll be candid with you. I'm not\nsure that whatever Morales-Travelers distinction there\nis really counts here, because the issue here is\ndifferent from the issue in some of the -- in most of\nthe preemption cases, because the issue here starts with\nthe, I think, the agreed assumption that Congress wanted\nto end a certain category of regulation.\nAnd the question is would Congress have\nwanted, in effect, to permit a degree of State\nregulation when it was for a particular purpose?\nAnd the question then is not whether\nCongress intended or had as an object when it passed\nthis statute an interference with the State's regulation\nof juvenile contraband. The question is whether it\nintended to permit any regulation with respect to\ndelivery services to survive; and isn't that the tough\nquestion that you've got to face?\nMR. STERN: Your Honor, looking at the\nobjectives of Congress as explained by Congress in the\nlegislative record, it's very clear that Congress was\nconcerned, the committee was concerned with, the\nproponents such as the Federal Department of\nTransportation, were concerned with the effects of the\nparticular category of regulation, State economic\nregulation. The committee mentioned that nine times.\nThe United States --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: That's because most\nregulation, you know, has an economic purpose involved.\nBut the ultimate object, it seems to me, was to end the\neconomic effects of State patchwork transportation\nregulation.\nAnd therefore I think the question you've\ngot to address is why would they have allowed a certain\ncategory of regulation that clearly affects the way\nthese companies perform their services to survive solely\non the ground that the regulation was entailed at the\nState level by the State's choice to go against youthful\ntobacco use?\nMR. STERN: Well, Your Honor, we suggest\nthat the Court looks at the FAA Act and its legislative\nhistory, as well as what immediately preceded it, which\nwas the Synar Amendment. The Synar Amendment encouraged\nthe States to deal with this problem. The Federal\nGovernment --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But the Synar -- I don't\nhave it in front of me, but the Synar Amendment refers\nto -- to a number of objects of State legislation that\nwould be required, but it doesn't say anything about\nregulating transportation.\nMR. STERN: It states quite clearly that the\nintent is to encourage the States to prohibit -- or to\nenforce/enact laws that prohibit retailers and\ndistributors from getting tobacco to children.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Right. And we don't\nnormally think of a delivery service as a distributor of\ngoods. I mean, we -- in the sense, I think, that the\nstatute meant.\nI -- I read the Synar Amendment reference to\ndistributors as being wholesalers, people within the\nindustry who get the cigarettes from, you know, the\nmanufacturing point to the corner store, as opposed\nsimply to a delivery service that delivers all kinds of\ngoods.\nMR. STERN: Well, a sale consists of several\ncomponents, Your Honor: Order, payment, and delivery.\nHanding it over, handing the tobacco over physically to\nthe buyer, from the standpoint of the buyer's standpoint\nand from the standpoint of public health perspective, is\nthe most important aspect of the transaction.\nIt is the seller who has the responsibility\nto comply with the law with respect to each one of those\nsteps.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Stern, at the time\nthat the motor carrier deregulation came into effect,\nwere there any products where Maine told the retailer,\nif you want to sell not face-to-face, you must choose a\ncarrier that will provide X, Y, and Z services? Was\nthere any -- is tobacco alone or were there other\ncommodities?\nMR. STERN: Interestingly, there -- Maine\nbeing a hunting State, there was a law on the books\nwhich required the common carrier -- it specifically\nreferred to the common carrier -- to verify that the\nperson shipping it was the hunter with the appropriate\nlicense, required the common carrier to affix\nidentification tags to the hunting -- the hunting\nreward, so to speak, and also to make a return or\nprovide notice to the Commissioner of Inland Fisheries\nand Wildlife.\nSo Maine had a variety of those sorts of\nlaws on the books that required carriers to actually do\nsomething with respect to a particular type of\ncommodity.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Does the Postal Service\nadhere to -- or I don't know if the Postal Service is\nused to ship cigarettes, tobacco products. But if it\nis, does the Postal Service adhere to Maine's\nrequirement?\nMR. STERN: Two points, Your Honor. First,\nthe Postal Service has immunity from Maine laws. And\nsecond, the Postal Service, interestingly, does have an\naddressee verification service for $4.10.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why does the Post Office\nhave immunity from Maine laws? Really?\nMR. STERN: I believe there --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You could kill people and\nall sorts of stuff. I mean --\n(Laughter.)\nMR. STERN: I hope not, Your Honor. But\nwith respect to a variety of civil regulatory matters, I\nbelieve the courts have concluded that the United States\nPostal Service has immunity from Maine -- from Maine and\nother State laws.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But it does -- you say\nthe Postal Service provides something that conforms,\nthat they have the -- you must deliver it to the person,\nto the addressee herself?\nMR. STERN: Yes, Your Honor. It is not\nexactly conforming because -- it's sort of interesting.\nDifferent carrier services or the Postal Service have\ndifferent sort of options that seem to make clear that\nthis is not a real problem to provide. The U.S. Postal\nService provides an addressee verification service, but\nnot an age verification service. UPS provides an age\nverification service, but not an addressee verification\nservice.\nSince one costs $2.75 and the other one\ncosts $4.10, this does not seem to be an acute problem\nto -- for a carrier, if it wishes to compete for the\nmarket, to actually compete for it and price it\nappropriately.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But why aren't you just\ndriving all this business to the Postal Service? I\nmean, you know, what have you accomplished? You'd drive\nFedEx out of business if they choose not to incur the\nadditional expense. And so, you know, all these people\njust ship it through the Postal Service.\nMR. STERN: There have been efforts to deal\nwith the Postal Service loophole, Your Honor, and --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You can't do it. I mean,\nthey're exempt from Maine laws. Didn't you know that?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. STERN: I think I heard somebody mention\nthat, Your Honor.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. STERN: Certainly, in another branch of\ngovernment, that -- there's an effort to deal with that\nproblem. But, with respect to the suggestion we've\ndriven FedEx out of business, there's no suggestion --\nwell, first of all, we have no evidence with respect to\nwhat this effect has had on FedEx. With respect to UPS,\nUPS continues to ship tobacco to licensees and has not\nshown in the record that they lost any business with any\nof their customers, obtained licenses from the State of\nMaine, and therefore it could actually ship into the\nState of Maine.\nJUSTICE ALITO: But what if every -- what if\nevery State enacted a slightly different law relating to\nthis and a slightly different law relating to every\nother product that they might want to restrict for\nhealth or safety reasons? Would you -- would you agree\nthen with the Respondent that there would be just the\nkind of patchwork of regulation at the State level that\nthis statute was intended to stop?\nMR. STERN: Well, Your Honor, the\nRespondent's arguments do not guarantee uniform\nregulation. In fact, they guarantee exactly the\nopposite. They don't dispute that Maine and other\nStates can ban the transport and delivery of what we can\ncall unlicensed tobacco, tobacco from unlicensed\nretailers, to unlicensed entities. Different States can\nhave different licensing requirements and certainly\ndifferent licensees. So a patchwork is created.\nIn addition, Respondents agree that States\ncan outright ban the furnishing of a variety of\ncommodities or contraband, including in particular\ntobacco or alcohol --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought that wasn't\nclear from their brief. I thought they had a footnote\nthat said they weren't arguing the point in this case,\nbut I thought they didn't concede the total ban.\nMR. STERN: I believe if one looks at --\nit's either page 24 or 44 of the brief -- they concede\nthat Maine and other States can ban the furnishing of\ntobacco.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, they --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: They concede that they can\ndo it beyond the requirement, beyond the force of the\nstatute that precludes the knowing distribution. In\nother words, they -- they're not appealing the one\nprovision of subsection D that makes it a crime\nknowingly to get the tobacco into the hands of minors\nand so on, but do they concede anything beyond that?\nMR. STERN: I believe they do, Your Honor.\nI believe -- I think it's at page 44 -- they concede\nthat Maine can ban the furnishing of tobacco by anyone,\nincluding a carrier.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but I think that the\nreason they make that concession is that they say you\nmust prove knowledge, and they're -- they're not\nconcerned about the -- about intentionally transgressing\nMaine's law. What they're concerned about is the\nadditional steps that you require them to go through to\nmake sure that there is no tobacco.\nSo they're not really worried about it so\nlong as you have a knowledge requirement.\nMR. STERN: Well, there is a knowledge\nrequirement in the first part of section 1555-D. And\nYour Honor's question gets right to the nub of the\nproblem with respect to the lower court's decision on\n1555-D, which is: How does Maine or any other State go\nabout proving knowing delivery of an unlicensed product\nsuch as this?\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, you prove it without\na presumption to start with. That's what the -- that's\nway the issue was left by the district court.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And that's why they're not\nworried about it, because it's hard to prove.\nMR. STERN: Without the evidentiary\nassumption, it's very difficult, if not impossible, to\nprove, which essentially makes the first part of the\ncourt's decision with respect to 1555 --\nJUSTICE BREYER: The answer to that is it\nmay be a very good idea, so convince Congress to pass a\nlaw. It's just that if every State does it differently\nit's going to be a nightmare. And I don't know what the\nanswer to that point is.\nAnd I don't know what the answer to the\npoint is about banning things. I'm amazed if that's\nwhat you mean. I'm not sure what you mean. I mean,\nNorth Carolina could pass a statute that says the\nfollowing: Everybody in North Carolina over the age 16,\nsay, or maybe everybody including small children -- I\ndon't know what they want to pass -- can smoke to their\nheart's delight, can buy as many cigarettes as they\nlike, but you can't ship in a single cigarette from out\nof State.\nYou think that wouldn't cause -- raise a\nCommerce Clause problem?\nMR. STERN: A Commerce Clause problem?\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes.\nMR. STERN: It depends upon how the statute\nis written. If it banned --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, that's why I'm just\nnot certain about bans that forbid people to ship things\ninside from outside the State, while allowing people to\nbuy those things produced by people inside the State.\nThat's why I'm uncertain about the concession you're\ntalking about.\nMR. STERN: Well --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I mean, what is this New\nYork law that does this?\nMR. STERN: The New York law banned the\ndelivery and sale of tobacco -- delivery and sales of\ncigarettes to B(2) --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But isn't that the result\nof a settlement?\nMR. STERN: The -- the law was -- existed\nbefore the settlement, and the settlement which we have\nreferred to is a situation where UPS and a number of\nother carriers have agreed to conform with it, Your\nHonor.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And nationwide, not just\nin New York; isn't that so?\nMR. STERN: Yes, Your Honor. And it -- it\nreveals, we think, that the -- that the nature of the\nlaws here are not so burdensome as to run afoul of this\nCourt's concerns --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So, then, practically,\nyou don't have a problem with cigarettes because the New\nYork settlement takes care of it. You're just talking\nabout other tobacco products?\nMR. STERN: Well, there are other tobacco\nproducts, but in the New York settlement -- we can't\nenforce the New York settlement, Your Honor. We have\nour own separate law, particularly section --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But I thought, as a\nresult of the New York settlement, carriers are no\nlonger shipping directly to consumers anyplace\ncigarettes.\nMR. STERN: That is the intent of that, Your\nHonor. I'm not sure how effective it has been. But by\ndoing that, they have agreed and put in place a system\nwhere tobacco products can only be shipped from a\nlicensee.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But the thing I'm concerned\nabout is -- is assume it's perfectly legal to do what\nyou said. I guess it still wouldn't be legal for Maine\nor New York to say the following: We really want to\ndiscourage people from smoking, a noble goal. And,\ntherefore, whenever an interstate shipper ships tobacco\ninto the State, he has to charge double the price, just\ndouble the shipment price or ten times the shipment\nprice. Could they say that?\nMR. STERN: That would seem to clearly run\nafoul of the --\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right.\nMR. STERN: -- Commerce Clause.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. But could they\nsay you have to carry it in special packages which the\nsticker -- which maybe you should do, but which the\nsticker puts skull and crossbones on each of the\npackages? Could they say that?\nMR. STERN: I don't think --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No. All right.\nMR. STERN: -- they necessarily could, Your\nHonor.\nJUDGE BREYER: If they cannot say either of\nthose things because of the statute, why can they say:\nWhat you have to do is you have to ship it in a way that\nmakes certain that the person who receives it, the\naddressee, is the person who bought it?\nMR. STERN: The reason, Your Honor, is the\ndifference between the hypothetical you proposed at the\nbeginning of your question and what's going on in Maine\nwith respect to 1555-C(3)(C), which is a mouthful.\nAt the time the FAAA Act was enacted, it was\nillegal for anyone to -- an unlicensed retailer, to sell\ntobacco in the State of Maine, and it was illegal to\nsell tobacco without verifying the age of the buyer.\nThat's the generally applicable law that was -- a\njudicial sort of law that was on the books in 1994.\nThe skull and crossbones requirement is not\na judicial type of law, and what this Court has done in\nthe ERISA cases is look to see the -- the purpose and\ntype of law that is before it to determine whether it\nwas a type of law that was in existence and whether\nthere was any positive indication that -- that that sort\nof law was supposed to be pre-empted or not.\nHere these sorts of age verification laws\nwere on the books. We have identified the problem and\neverybody understands the problem with respect to\ndelivery and sales.\nIt would be absurd for an over-the-counter\nclerk to take money from someone --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Stern, can I ask you\nthis question: To what extent are we dealing with a\ntobacco problem or a broader problem? Do you have other\nproducts that are contraband such as -- or have special\nrestrictions on who can ship wild animals, prescription\ndrugs, firearms; or are there other products that you\nregulate in the same way?\nMR. STERN: There are no -- I'm not aware of\nany that we -- we regulate in the same way. In similar\n--\nJUSTICE STEVENS: You allow shippers to ship\nfirearms and poisonous substances without having this\nkind of restriction on it, do you?\nMR. STERN: There are not exactly the same\nrestrictions. But, with respect to alcohol, we have a\nlaw on the books which prohibits the knowing sale or\ntransfer of alcohol to somebody who is underage.\nBecause of the -- the unique situation we\nfound with respect to delivery and sales of tobacco,\nwe've put this in place to make it clear how a seller\ngoes about conforming with Maine's generally applicable\nlaw.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But I don't really see why\nthe States have -- have a different interest in\nregulating shipment of tobacco to minors than they would\na variety of other substances that could be harmful to\nminors or contraband in general. And you don't try to\nregulate any of those?\nMR. STERN: Well, Your Honor, we do try to\nregulate those. I misunderstood your question.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: By -- by regulating how\nthey may be shipped, I mean.\nMR. STERN: There is no law exactly like\nthis one with respect to the other types of -- of\ndangerous substances. There is --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Stern, you told me in\n-- in response to my question earlier, you mentioned\nonly, I think, game; and you said that those\nprohibitions were directly on the carrier --\nMR. STERN: That's correct.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- that is, prohibitions\nand instructions for how you can ship game. And I don't\nknow if that -- if there are other food products. You\nmentioned only that one.\nAnd is it not the case that explosives --\nthat that's Federal regulation?\nMR. STERN: The Federal Government has a\nrole with respect to the shipment of explosives, but it\nhas no role with respect to the shipment of tobacco.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But is there -- in\naddition to the Federal regulation, which I take it\nwould cover various dangerous substances, does Maine add\nto what the Federal regulation is, say, for sending\nfireworks, firearms?\nMR. STERN: With respect to fireworks, Maine\nin its discretion has adopted the Federal role -- the\nFederal view, which, I think, emphasizes and -- and\nhighlights the different situation we have here.\nWhen the Federal Government believed there\nshould be some sort of uniform regulation of a\nparticular dangerous item, be it fireworks, for example,\nor hazardous material, it does so. Otherwise, it leaves\nit to the States.\nAnd this is a situation where if the State\ndoesn't act to deal with the problem of delivery and\nsales, we have a regulatory void and nobody deals with\nthis problem.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, maybe because\nCongress wanted the regulatory void. Maybe Congress\ndidn't want these things to be enforced by regulating\nthe transporter, as opposed to regulating the shipper\nand the receiver.\nAs far as the game regulation is concerned,\nisn't it the case that UPS won't carry any game now\nbecause of the -- because of your game regulations?\nMR. STERN: In their policies, they have\nindicated that they do not carry game, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's too onerous.\nMR. STERN: Well --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So you've sort of driven\nthem out of the business.\nMR. STERN: No. Your Honor, UPS has a\nvariety of options such as a cash-on-delivery option\nwhich requires them to run around and find somebody with\na check, money order, or credit card. So they can price\nthese. It's just a matter of whether they want to\ncompete for them.\nAnd, again, with respect to C(3)(C), which\nI'd like to focus on for a moment, it would be absurd,\nwe think, to have a situation where a clerk in an\nover-the-counter sale could accept money from a buyer,\nverify the age of the buyer, and then turn to a third\nperson and hand the tobacco to that person without the\nbuyer being present.\nThat is exactly the situation that\nRespondents ask this Court to embrace as the intent of\nCongress. And with respect to Your Honor's--\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, as long as the buyer\nis not an interstate carrier, there is really no -- no\nproblem of conflicting with Federal law.\nMR. STERN: Well, there is no conflict with\nFederal law under our reading of the FAAA Act and the\nSynar Amendment because the -- the intent of Congress\nhas to be one which does not end up in an absurd result.\nAnd we suggest that having this gaping conduit of\ntobacco to children is just such an absurd result.\nIf the Court has no further questions now,\nI'd like to reserve my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Stern.\nMs. Brinkmann.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF BETH S. BRINKMANN\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMS. BRINKMANN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may\nit please the Court:\nIf Maine's tobacco delivery law is not\npreempted, Congress's core purpose for the FAAAA will be\ndefeated. There will be different delivery laws in\nStates across the country, and that patchwork will\neliminate the efficiency and the cost savings that was\nCongress's intent in the FAAAA when it enacted it to\nderegulate the industry.\nIf I could, I'd like to try and quantify for\nyou the enormous impact and effect that these two\nprovisions have on carrier services.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Before you do that,\nMs. Brinkmann, would you tell us how alcohol is handled,\nbecause that is, as I understand it, that's by virtue of\nthe 24th Amendment State regulation. Does UPS carry\nalcohol packages from one State to another?\nMS. BRINKMANN: Yes, alcohol is, of course,\ngoverned by a different legal regime because of the 21st\nAmendment. And yes, they do provide services for wine\nand beer only, and that service has to be pursuant to a\ncontract. It is a special contract with the shipper,\nand the shipper has to be licensed.\nAnd UPS and the other carriers have uniform\nprocedures for doing that, so they are not subject to a\npatchwork of regulation, unless there are laws in the\nStates that are allowed because of the 21st Amendment.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But I asked the question\nonly in response to your impossibility argument that you\ncouldn't cope with such State regulations with respect\nto tobacco, when it seems you are with respect to\nalcohol.\nMS. BRINKMANN: I think it would be useful\nto give the quantification, I think, about the impact of\nthese provisions. I would first point out that the\nservices that are provided right now are in response to\nthe market and market competition, which was Congress's\nintent. And these, of course, would be services that\nwere created in response to a State dictate, which is at\nthe core of the problem.\nBut just to give you an idea about the\nC(3)(C), which is the delivery confirmation --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Before you leave the\nalcohol point, I don't quite understand the relevance of\nthe 21st Amendment. It seems to me if you can\npre-empt -- if Federal law can pre-empt State laws that\nare authorized by the 21st Amendment, I don't understand\nhow that has anything to do with the preemption issue.\nMS. BRINKMANN: I think it involves much\nmore complicated constitutional issues that reach the\n21st Amendment. I think even in light of this Court's\nopinion in Granholm v. Heald, there would be more\ncomplex issues to analyze --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Why isn't it still a State\nregulation of shipping, even if it's a law that's\nauthorized by the 21st Amendment? I don't see the\ndifference.\nMS. BRINKMANN: Well, it may be not be, Your\nHonor. The problem has been taken care of by this\nuniform service, and I have to say that is at the age of\n21. That is an adult confirmation. And that is not an\naddressee-specific requirement.\nHere under C(3)(C), it would be a new\nservice that required the actual addressee to sign for\nit. And I should comment, my understanding of U.S.\nPostal Service is it doesn't have to be the addressee\nwho signs. They can designate someone else to sign for\nit, and there is no age verification. But here it has\nto be the addressee, and there has to be photo\ngovernment ID for anyone between 18 and 27. And if I\ncould just for --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: What if a new carrier\nsaid, well, I'd like to get into the business of\nshipping tobacco products, none of the other companies\nwant to do it, I want to form -- I'll form my own\ncompany. It will meet all these requirements. Would it\n-- would it then be pre-empted?\nMS. BRINKMANN: If the State was dictating a\nservice that made --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, they're saying the\nretailer must use a service that fulfills these\nqualifications. And if there are services out there,\nwhy would the law be pre-empted?\nMS. BRINKMANN: It would depend on the\neffect on the carriers. And if I could --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I assume that the purpose\nof the Federal law was not to enable services which\nwould not otherwise be provided at all, but rather to\nenable services to be provided more economically, to\nreduce the cost, the cost of interstate transportation.\nMS. BRINKMANN: Driven by market\ncompetition, Your Honor. The evidence --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Sure. Somebody would come\nin to occupy the void, but he would charge a heck of a\nlot more.\nMS. BRINKMANN: Your Honor, in this case the\nevidence demonstrates -- in the court of appeals\nappendix there's the deposition by Ms. Meisel, which\nexplains on pages 163 and 189 that it's not flipping a\nswitch to create a new service like this. Many systems\nwould have to be completely reengineered to take in new\ndata about age and addressee. There would have to be a\nnew system for the alert. There would have to be a new\nsystem for reading the alert. That takes one\nand-a-half years, 18 months, for that modification to\noccur. That's an enormous effect.\nAnd I would also like just to look at --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But that's the effect on\nUPS; is that not right?\nMS. BRINKMANN: On the carrier services.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Does that foreclose the\npossibility that somebody else might just specialize in\ndelivering tobacco products, for example?\nMS. BRINKMANN: Your Honor, if there were a\nrequirement or Maine law, for example, for a widely\nalready established adult signature requirement, that\nmay have a different preemption analysis. There\ncertainly would not be the problems of uniformity. But\nI don't think it could be something that's dictated.\nAnd if a --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why wouldn't there would be\na problem? I don't understand that. There would still\nbe a problem with uniformity from State to State.\nMS. BRINKMANN: Yes, Your Honor --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Do you think if Maine did\nit for all products it would be okay? It's only they're\ndoing it for tobacco that makes it bad?\nMS. BRINKMANN: No, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I didn't think so.\nMS. BRINKMANN: That cost that I just\ndescribed has to be multiplied for 50 States and many\ncommodities.\nAnd also, if you look at the 1555-D, the\nprohibition on unlicensed tobacco retailers sending to a\nconsume and the imputed knowledge, the law that has\nstrict liability on the carrier, if there is a box that\nhas a shipper's name from the attorney general's list,\nthat imputed knowledge would require that every one of\nthe 65,000 or 16 million packages going to Maine every\nyear be examined for the shipper identification.\nAnd in the record, there is -- the State has\nadmitted at J-96 that that kind of research to look\ninto -- in this case it was looking at the sender, but\nit would be the same for the shipper -- I mean, it was\nlooking for the addressee; this would be for the shipper\n-- is two dollars per package.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: How did they deal with\nunder the New York settlement? I take it this would be\na problem under that settlement, because it doesn't\ntouch selling from a duly licensed dealer. And so,\nunder the New York settlement, which operates\nnationwide, what does the carrier do to make sure that\nthe recipient is a licensed dealer?\nMS. BRINKMANN: Under the New York\nsettlement there's a very complex structure that the\ncarriers have agreed to, first of all forbidding all\ndelivery of cigarettes to consumers.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Where does that appear in\nthe materials? Do you remember where it is?\nMS. BRINKMANN: There is a citation to it in\nthe Petitioner's brief, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But there's no text,\nthough?\nMS. BRINKMANN: It's available, I believe,\non the attorney general of New York's web site. There's\na very -- for example, in the UPS assurance of\ndiscontinuance, there's a three-tier disciplinary scheme\nagainst shippers that are found to violate that.\nAnd the carriers entered into these\nagreements under threat of criminal sanctions. The New\nYork statute made one offense a misdemeanor and a second\noffense a felony. And the carriers, who had been trying\nto abide by those laws, were faced with subpoenas and\nthe threat of prosecution. And so their solution was a\nuniform nationwide policy, no cigarettes to consumers.\nBut of course --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Ms. Brinkmann, I'm\ninterested in two things. Number one, I want to make\nsure you completed the quantification point that you\nmade, and you pointed us to someplace in the record,\nbecause the Petitioner said, oh, it just costs a penny a\npackage or something like that.\nAnd then the second point, I think probably\nnot related, is the question of knowledge. I take it\nyou're not contesting if there's actual knowledge that\nit's a minor that there can be a prosecution. I'm not\nsure how that works if the company -- because of the\nimputed knowledge. Suppose an officer of the company or\nsome shipping clerk knows it. Wouldn't the company be\nliable if the company were subject to -- those are two\ndifferent questions.\nMS. BRINKMANN: To your first question, just\nto complete it, Your Honor, at JA-96 there's an\nadmission that it's a two-dollar cost to research a\npackage. There it's for the addressee, but it would be\nthe same for the shipper. And if you had to do that for\nthe 16 million packages going to Maine a year just\nthrough UPS, it would be $32 million a year.\nTurning to your knowledge point, I think\nthis is a very important point that the Court was\ndiscussing earlier and, Justice Scalia, I think you were\ndiscussing about the general ban. Justice Ginsburg, you\nmentioned our footnote.\nYou have to know that the details of the ban\nare to figure out whether or not it is pre-empted. In\nthis case, the First Circuit at Pet. App. 29 explains\nwhy its construction of the first sentence of 1555-D,\nwhich prohibits any person from knowingly transporting\ncontraband tobacco, is now pre-empted. But it makes\nvery clear that the State law is pre-empted, Pet. App.\n29, to the extent that Maine's tobacco delivery law\nrequires or has the effect of requiring carriers to\nimplement State-mandated procedures in the processing or\ndelivery of packages as pre-empted by the FAAAA.\nSo to the extent there is a general ban\nagainst knowing transportation that does not require --\nthat does not impose a strict liability requirement --\nit's a strict liability that says it's not just knowing,\nyou have to look at every shipper's name. You have to\nlook at every side of that box. And then you have to\ndecide who the recipient is.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Ms. Brinkmann, I'm\nfascinated by this New York settlement. You -- you say\nthat -- that Maine can't do this. But you say if a\nbunch of States do it, and they twist the carriers' arms\nhard enough by threatening criminal penalties, so that\nthe carriers say, okay, I give up; and then they agree\nto limit their transport, that's okay?\nMS. BRINKMANN: No, Your Honor. I'm sorry\nif I gave that impression. That was a --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I mean you're\nspeaking about the New York settlement as though that's\nhunky-dory.\nMS. BRINKMANN: No, it isn't. This --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I'm not sure that if this\n-- if this Federal act means what it says, that that\nkind of settlement isn't the kind of thing the act did\nnot want to happen.\nMS. BRINKMANN: Well, it's a voluntary\nagreement in which --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Voluntary under threat of\ncriminal penalty.\nMS. BRINKMANN: -- in which the carriers\nadopted a uniform approach.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that's -- that's\nnice. But what about the consumer? The act was not\njust for the convenience of the carriers. It was meant\nto -- to serve the convenience and the economic benefit\nof the consumer.\nI -- I expect a consumer might be able to\nchallenge that -- that New York settlement. I'm\nsurprised you accepted it as, well, you know, so long as\nthe carrier coughs it up, it's okay.\nMS. BRINKMANN: No, the assurances of\ndiscontinuance -- specifically, I know that Federal\nExpress and UPS have reserved the right and do not\nconcede that the New York law is not preempted under\nFAAAA. There is no concession there, Your Honor. I\nwant to make that abundantly clear.\nI also wanted to address the --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Just on the knowledge\npoint, I'm still not sure. I don't want to ask you if\nyou concede that knowing delivery would make you liable.\nThat's what the First Circuit said. I suppose that's\nnot before us, so I have to take that as a premise, as a\ngiven.\nMS. BRINKMANN: I think, though, if I could\n--\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: It's a little bit hard to\nwrite the opinion your way with that, with that\nconcession. That's my problem. Or with that premise.\nMS. BRINKMANN: I think if you understand\nwhat the First Circuit was saying, this is a total ban\non knowing delivery. It doesn't require the carrier to\nchange their services. So we -- the carriers don't have\nto go out and in the hundreds of countries that they\noperate change the intake procedure for shipments to be\nable to have all the data and all the --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: No, but they are presumed\nto have read the label, the stamp on the label; isn't\nthat correct?\nMS. BRINKMANN: You go to the end of the\nsystem, is where the knowledge would come into place.\nIn reality, under the current operating services that\nare provided --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Would you answer my\nquestion? May they presume that if the package is\nlabeled cigarettes, that the delivery -- the delivery\nperson knows that?\nMS. BRINKMANN: I wouldn't necessarily say a\npresumption, Your Honor. It is evidence that can be\nused.\nThat -- we recognize that. I think some of\nthe amici suggest that we say it cannot. It can be\nused. It's not a presumption. It is not something that\ndeems knowledge. I can just give you some examples of\npracticality.\nThe two employees who actually see the box,\nloaders and sorters, it's going by so fast, they don't\n-- aren't reading anything. The preloader who puts it\ninto the truck --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: When they pick up the\npackage, they don't look at the labels?\nMS. BRINKMANN: -- and the driver.\nBut what you have to understand is sometimes\nthey're packed four high. Some deliveries are ten to\none business and each side of each box is not viewed.\nOftentimes the scan on the bar code is done from a\ndistance. They don't -- what the loaders look at is the\nZIP-code, and actually with increased automation -- and\nMr. Butler's deposition, which was filed on -- back in\nJune of 2004, he talked about even greater automation\nwhere they won't even be reading the ZIP-code.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but the way -- I'm\ntelling you I assume the way it works is that the UPS\ntruck goes out to the tobacco warehouse and picks up\n4,000 boxes, all registered tobacco. He certainly knows\nit's tobacco at that point.\nMS. BRINKMANN: That's not my understanding.\nThat's not the evidence in this case. There are many\nways in which the system comes in; and I certainly think\nthat could be a different question of knowing and that\nwould be a question of proof.\nAnd it can be evidence. But I'll tell you,\nif there was a driver who for the past month had found\nthree boxes of tobacco and turned them in and said, you\nknow, these can't be delivered, and one day one box got\nthrough and he didn't see it written, or it was written\nin light marker or it had, you know, bled, because they\nused the wrong thing -- there's no uniformity of size or\nanything -- no, I think that would be a question for a\njury to decide about knowledge, and it can't be a\npresumption and it can't be deemed. It is a question of\nknowledge.\nJUSTICE BREYER: May I ask you this\nquestion, which is where I'm having a little trouble on\nyour side. I think I would agree and you would agree\nthat if the State were to say, to protect the consumers\nin our State, anyone who ships in goods must do so in\nspecial padded cars -- use whatever shipper you want,\nbut you have to have special -- that would be illegal.\nMS. BRINKMANN: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Can California say, anybody\nwho ships lettuces into our State has to use\nrefrigerated equipment? One product, not all products,\nand a good public health reason?\nMS. BRINKMANN: Your Honor, that would be\nfor Congress, and it would have --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So you'd say that would\nalso be preempted?\nMS. BRINKMANN: I think you have to look at\nthe specific statute. And we went through and really\nlooked at the statutes that the State cited, and you can\nsee in our brief we set out, a third of them have\nknowledge requirements. Another group -- for example\nMaine's fireworks, when you trace it down, it looks like\na local commissioner does it, and then they adopt these\nstandards for an association. And what is it? It's a\nFederal standard. So I think you really have to bore\ninto that.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Why is it that knowledge\nrequirements have a different preemption analysis?\nThat's what I'm finding that difficult to understand.\nMS. BRINKMANN: Because the way in which the\nFirst Circuit construed the first sentence is just to be\na ban on knowing transportation delivery, and said it\ncan't require -- on pages 26 and 27, it says it\ndifferent ways -- that if a liability standard of a\nState is preempted, if, for example, it required\nmodification of the delivery methods, other than\ndeclining the package; if in the normal course of the\nservices that are already provided, if there is\nknowledge that is evidence --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Then that's clear\npreemption in Justice Breyer's example. If California\nsays you must ship certain products in refrigerated\ncontainers, that is definitely preempted under your\nanalysis.\nMS. BRINKMANN: If there is no Federal\nregulatory -- yes.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: That statute is definitely\npreemptive. A State cannot insist on that. Could they\ninsist on firearms being slipped only in labeled\npackages?\nMS. BRINKMANN: There are many Federal\nregulations about the transportation --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Could the State do it\nbeyond the Federal requirement?\nMS. BRINKMANN: No, Your Honor, it would\nhave to be uniform, and I think that's a great example.\nThe -- the Federal scheme for hazardous materials are\nextensive, and that is what carriers are focused on, on\nuniformity, on the best way in which to provide these\nservices.\nIf I could, I just wanted to discuss for a\nmoment why we really would urge that there is no health\nand safety exception or that this can be read to be\nlimited to economics. First of all --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Before you get into that,\ndo we have to hold -- assuming we agree with you -- do\nwe have to hold that the knowing requirement of the\nfirst sentence is okay?\nMS. BRINKMANN: No, I don't --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- even though the other\nprovisions are not okay?\nMS. BRINKMANN: We did not --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: : Okay. I have a lot of\ntrouble with the knowing requirement.\nMS. BRINKMANN: We do not cross-petition on\nthat --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Fifty different States\nhaving a knowing requirement for a hundred different\nproducts -- I don't know that that complies with the\nFederal law.\nMS. BRINKMANN: What we are responding to is\nthe cert petition from the State here. I would point\nout that -- an example that the Court itself gave is\nunder their health and safety exemption, that means that\nthe State could come and just put a surcharge, whether\nit would be on tobacco or junk food. There is no line\nto draw between the position they take here and that\nkind of situation. We point to the text of the statute,\nof course, and the findings about the burdens on\ninterstate commerce of the interstate regulation. The\nstructure -- there is a facie exemption for motor\nvehicles and even that has a Department of\nTransportation Federal backdrop against it. And in the\nMorales opinion from this Court, they pointed to the\nAirline Deregulation Act, which is very important here\nbecause that statute is construed just as this is. And\nin the Morales the Court pointed out that an earlier\nbill had had the kind of economic regulation that the\nState here seeks and it was rejected. Then of course in\nthis very case, the Congress -- conference report\nembraced the Morales standard and in fact described it\nas a broad preemptive standard they intended apply here.\nSo we believe that that is the standard that should\nreally apply, but in light of the effect that this has\non the carrier services, we suggest it means any\nstandard of or are related to.\nThere's certainly an immediate connection\nwith -- and there are express references in these\nprovisions that we suggest means any preemption\nstandard.\nIf there's -- one other thing I would say,\nup the C(3)(C), the provision which the State suggests\ndoes not directly dictate services, first of all the\nSolicitor General reads the statute anew and suggests\nthat there may be direct enforcement against the\ncarriers, which certainly would changes our view of\nthat, because there is an instruction requirement that\nthe shipper give to the carrier and say, State law\nmandates this.\nMoreover, we would like to point out, for\nexample, in the Wolens case, the frequent flyers program\nthat was at issue there was not a mandatory aspect of\nthe services, and also in the Court's own recent Clean\nAir Act case, where there's also the \"relating to\"\nlanguage used. Engine manufacturers realize this, that\nyou can't regulate the seller through the purchaser.\nThank you, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMs. Brinkmann.\nMr. Hallward-Driemeier.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF DOUGLAS HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER,\nON BEHALF OF UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,\nSUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Thank you,\nMr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:\nI think there's no question that the\nState of Maine could not require carriers to obtain a\nlicense to deliver tobacco products and condition that\nupon the carrier's service complying with the mandates\nof State law, that that would be a law that relates to\nthe carrier's service.\nNow, Maine maintains that its law is\nsaved from preemption because of two distinctions: One,\nit that is adopted with a health rather than economic\npurpose, and because it operates directly on the shipper\nrather than the carrier.\nAnd we don't think that either of those\narguments is consistent with the text, structure, or\nlegislative history of the Act. But I would want to\npoint --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You're talking about\nthe Federal act or the Maine act?\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: The Federal act.\nThat's right. But it's worth noting that those\narguments, in any event, only go to the provision in\nC(3)(C). The provision that is under dispute in section\nD does not have either of those characteristics. It\noperates directly on the carrier, and it is not adopted\nfor the health concern but rather to support the State's\nlicensing and tax purposes.\nBut if I could go back to the reasons why\ntheir argument is inconsistent with the text, structure,\nand history of the Federal act, as Respondents' counsel\nnoted, Congress did consider an alternative version of\nthis bill, one that was limited to economic regulation,\nand the Congress rejected the Senate version and adopted\ninstead the House version that much more broadly\npre-empted State regulation related to carrier services.\nIt added the provision of services and adopted the\n\"related to\" standard rather than regulation.\nAnd so it has rejected this limitation that\nPetitioners urge. Moreover, the argument that there is\na general health exception to the pre-emptive force of\nthe FAAAA is inconsistent with the structure of the Act.\nThere are specific exceptions in the Act related, for\nexample, to motor carrier safety, but those exceptions\ncorrespond to other grants of authority to the Secretary\nof Transportation to adopt regulations and to pre-empt\nState regulations that would interfere with interstate\ncommerce or impose too much of a burden on interstate\ncommerce.\nThere is no similar back top, if the court\nreads into the FAAAA a textual general exception for any\nact adopted with a health purpose by the States.\nJUSTICE ALITO: If one of the big carriers\ndecides for its own business purposes to offer a service\nthat complied with the Maine law, would that have the\neffect of \"un-pre-empting\" the Maine law?\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well, what Congress\n-- what Congress had in mind in the Act was that\ncarriers would respond to the marketplace, not State\nregulation. And where a service is widely available in\nresponse to the marketplace, for a State to dictate to\nshippers that they should use one service as opposed to\nanother, we think would have -- it would be a different\nanalysis under Morales. The Court in Morales said that\nthe test was whether there was a significant effect on\nthe carriers.\nAnd where, as here, we have the three major\ncarriers all providing, for example, an\nadult-signature-required service, for the -- for a State\nto say, well, when you ship alcohol, you have to use\nthat available service, that would not have much of an\neffect at all on the carriers.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Even if the law --\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: In fact, the\nFederal law --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Even if they all now decided\nthey wanted to go into this business, that would have no\neffect because they would have done that to comply with\nthe Maine law rather than as -- in response to the\nmarketplace?\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: That's right. We\ndon't think the State can adopt a law and in a sense\nforce the carriers to conform their services to the\nState law and then say, oh, but now they have it. We\ndon't think that would be conducive --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: It seems to me rather odd\nthat major carriers can determine the scope of\npre-emption. Suppose there are smaller carriers that\nsay we don't want to do this. Take the New York\nsettlement example. If the New York settlement example,\nin effect, opens up a new kind of service, all other\ncarriers have to follow that? That's a -- there's no\nauthority in our cases for that kind of pre-emption\nanalysis, is there?\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: I think with\nrespect to this particular example about the adult\nsignature required, the Court probably would need to go\nno farther than the fact that the Federal government has\nitself recognized the existence of that service and\nrequired it in a law that relates to the shipping of\nwine when one is prohibited by safety regulations from\ntaking it on the airplane with them. So the existence\nin the marketplace of this service has already\nrecognized in Federal law.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Could I follow up on\nJustice Kennedy's question, though, and specifically, do\nyou think the New York settlement, if the carriers did\nnot agree to it, that they would nonetheless prevail\nbecause the terms of it are pre-emptive?\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: I have not studied\nthe New York statute sufficiently to speak to that, and\nI don't think the government has a position about that.\nWe do believe -- the settlement agreement, though, is\ndistinct from the Maine law in some very significant\nrespects.\nAnd the most important of those is that\nunder the settlement agreement, the carriers agree to\nuse reasonable best efforts; whereas the Maine\nprovision -- this is the second sentence of D -- deems\nthe carrier to have knowledge --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, see, you are\n-- you are pretty familiar with the New York settlement\nthen.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: I have some\nfamiliarity with it.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, then I think\nyou ought to be able to tell me whether you think it's\npre-empted by the Federal law under your theory or not.\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well, I -- Your\nHonor, we have not taken a position on whether the\nsettlement is and, with respect -- although I have\nfamiliarity with the settlement, I have less familiarity\nwith the underlying New York statute that it was agreed\nto, in response to --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, you have\nfamiliarity with the knowing delivery requirement here.\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Yes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is that pre-emptive\nunder your view?\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: In our view, where,\nas construed by the First Circuit -- and we sort of\naccept that view -- the First Circuit, on page 26 of the\nPet. App., construed the first sentence of D as\nrequiring that carriers do not act as knowing\naccomplices in the illegal sale of tobacco products. So\nconstrued, we don't believe that that provision is\npre-emptive. It is akin to the general prohibition on\nfurnishing tobacco to minors in 1555-B(2), and we don't\nthink that that provision is pre-emptive.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: You mean it's akin to the\nhealth exception.\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Excuse me.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: You say it's akin to a\nhealth exception.\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: No. I -- I say\nthat it is a law of general applicability, and it does\nnot require any change in the carriers' practices. What\n-- what the imputation of knowledge does, however, is\nrequire the carriers to change their practices so that\nthey will get the knowledge when they can. For example,\ntake another example. If Maine said that it would\nimpute knowledge to the carriers of the tobacco contents\nif an X-ray scan would reveal the cigarette contents, it\nwould in effect be requiring the carriers to install\nX-ray machines and pass every package that they get\nthrough those X-ray machines. That's how an\nimputation of knowledge can be used to direct the\nconduct of the carrier, and that's what is so\nproblematic about the second sentence of D. They impute\nknowledge based upon whether the name of the shipper\nappears on a confidential list that the attorney general\nhas provided. In other words, even though, in their\nnormal practices, they don't pay attention whatsoever to\nthe shipper's name, they have to incorporate that into\ntheir practices in order to avoid the imputation of\nknowledge.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But the first condition,\nand the package is clearly labeled, aren't there some\ncommodities where UPS does have to pay attention to the\nlabel?\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well, yes, Your\nHonor. A Federal law -- there is Federal law with\nrespect to shipment of hazardous substances. There are\nuniform requirements with respect to how one must label\nhazardous substances, but --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: It can't be --\nMs. Brinkmann told us that they've got these -- so many\npackages and it's going to cost millions. But they do\nhave to do it for a package that's labeled hazardous.\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well, as I\nunderstand it, the -- the uniformity of the symbol for\nhazardous substance is something that the handlers are\ntrained to scan for.\nJUSTICE ALITO: But won't the name of the\nshipper be in their computer program? I mean, the\nshipper has to pay, right? Well, they know the name of\nthe shipper --\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well --\nJUSTICE ALITO -- and they have a\nsupercomputer so I don't understand why not\nnecessarily --\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Not necessarily, as\nI understand the service. Some of -- many, many of the\npackages are delivered to a company with which UPS has a\ncontract, such as a Staples or some other kind of store.\nAnd it becomes -- the Staples store becomes the shipper.\nThey are the ones with the contract with UPS, not\nwhoever it was that brought to it Staples. So it is not\nnecessarily part of their practice that they would have\nthat information at all.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Hallward-Driemeier.\nMr. Stern, you have five minutes left.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL STERN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. STERN: Thank you, Your Honor.\nBeginning with the last series of questions,\nif the Court looks at pages 100 to 102 of the joint\nappendix, the Court will see that UPS has a computer\ndial-up system which allows it to keep track of, and\nprovide alerts for, shippers' addresses and consignees,\nas well as they can keep track of what is called an SIC\ncode which is with respect to commodities. And they can\nkeep track of tobacco commodities.\nThere seems to be a misconception here, and\nI apologize for that. Maine's law is not a criminal\nlaw. It provides for civil violations between $50 and,\nI think, $1500.\nRegarding quantification, the only hard\nevidence in the record is that it costs UPS less than\none cents a -- one cent a package to look at the label\nto determine whether a -- a particular name is\nproblematic or not.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Times 50.\nMR. STERN: Excuse me.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Times 50, because 49 other\nStates would have different requirements, and all those\nrequirements might -- might cost only a penny to comply\nwith. But you add them all up, and it is half a buck.\nMR. STERN: No, it is not, Your Honor.\nBecause, as Ms. Brinkmann explained, the -- the looking\nat the label is done usually in UPS's situation by a\npreloader. And the preloader is in the particular\nState. So it still would be less than one cent a State\nfor each State it happened to be in.\nThe $2 a package is for the actual\nintercepted packages. In a five-month period, there\nwere a total of 33 intercepted packages, and the\ncitation to the record is at page 106.\nBy no stretch of the imagination is there\nany proof in this record that it costs $32 million a\nyear to comply with Maine's law.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Stern, when you say\nthat it takes one second to -- I forget whether you said\nscan or -- or examine a label, do you -- are you\ndescribing simply the physical act of a human being\nlooking at the label?\nMR. STERN: According to the testimony of\nMr. Butler, who provided a document on this, it is\nlooking at the label and determining whether it appears\nto be from a tobacco retailer.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: You can't tell unless you\nhave an extraordinary memory for all the names on the\nAttorney General's list. You can't do that simply by\nlooking at the label.\nAnd I -- I thought maybe what you meant by\nthe one second was that the list was -- was in a\ncomputer, and you had a mechanical device that scanned\nthe -- the name on the label and -- and it either\nmatched something in the computer, or it didn't.\nBut I take it you are talking about\nphysical, visual inspection.\nMR. STERN: Yes. Your Honor's question\nraises two points. First, with respect to the names,\nif one goes and looks at the list of unlicensed tobacco\nretailers, virtually all of them have something like\n\"tobacco\" or \"smokes\" or something in it, because their\ngoal is to be picked up by a Google search for somebody\nwho is looking for cheap cigarettes and cheap tobacco.\nWith respect to the computer system -- and\nthe record is full of citations to it, for example, at\npages 92 and 95 -- they have done a study of their\ncomputer system. They have not attempted in any way to\nresearch whether any of the companies on the list of\nunlicensed retailers is actually in their system so they\ncan be picked up by the system.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, I -- I just wanted to\nknow what you meant by the \"one second.\" I take it what\nyou mean is there is a physical, visual inspection of\nthe label. And in that one second, in practical terms,\nthe person looking can tell whether the name is on the\nAttorney General's list, because there will be some\ntipoff in the -- in the name of the company that -- that\nwill alert him?\nMR. STERN: Yes. And if it is, it is put\naside. And those are the 33 packages that were\nintercepted in a five-month period that cost --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. But --\nMR. STERN: -- UPS $2 a package.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: If someone on the\nunapproved list wants to -- for whatever reason, wants\nto avoid a tipoff term like incorporating the term\n\"tobacco\" on to their label, then the person making the\none-second inspection is not going to pick it up.\nAnd the only way the company is going to be\nable to protect itself against the imputed knowledge is\neither by a visual inspection of the Attorney General's\nlist to see whether it matches what the person is\nlooking at or by some computer scan, right?\nMR. STERN: The short answer is yes. If I\ncan explain?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Sure.\nMR. STERN: The -- the way UPS goes about\ndealing with this law was to put together a system which\nMs. Brinkmann and I have described. They did not study\nin any way, shape, or form how their computer system\ncould streamline this and make it effective.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Stern, I'd be\ninterested in whether you have any response to the\nGovernment's point that, at least as far as 1555-D is\nconcerned, that is a direct regulation of -- of the --\nthe shipper -- not the shipper, of the transporter. So\nthat -- so that your point that this is not a regulation\nof -- of transport is simply -- is simply wrong as far\nas 1555-D is concerned. Do you acknowledge that?\nMR. STERN: Yes. We made that point with\nrespect to 1555-C (3)(C).\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Okay.\nMR. STERN: With respect to 1555-D, it is a\ndirect regulation of the carrier services or any other\ndelivery service which we believe is called for and\npermissible under the Synar Amendment, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Stern.\n"
