CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The Court will hear

Frederick.
Mr. Starr.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF KENNETH W. STARR
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. STARR: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
Illegal drugs and the glorification of the
drug culture are profoundly serious problems for our
nation. Congress has so recognized, as has this Court,
time and again. The magnitude of the problem is
captured in the amicus brief, the Court has a number of
amicus briefs before it, but the amicus brief of General
McCaffrey, Secretary Bennett, and a number of
organizations. And particularly, pages 5 to 9 of that
brief, the nature and the scope of the problem are
well-captured.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, is this case limited
to signs about drugs? What is the rule that you want us
to adopt for deciding this case?
MR. STARR: The rule the Court -- that it
articulated in Tinker. The rule of the Court as
articulated in Tinker is that there is, in fact, a right
to political speech subject to disruption, requirements
that the speech not be disruptive.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Disruptive of what?
Disruptive of the classroom order? There was no
classroom here.
MR. STARR: Including but not limited to.
This was a school authorized event, this was education
outside of the classroom. It was essentially a school
simply out of doors. It was essentially --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, I can understand if
they unfurled the banner in a classroom that it would be
disruptive, but what did it disrupt on the sidewalk?
MR. STARR: The educational mission of the
school.
JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but I mean, that's at a
level of generality that doesn't get us very far. I
mean, what specifically did it disrupt? Did it disrupt
the parade, did it disrupt teaching, what was it?
MR. STARR: 5520, a school policy of the
board that says emphatically that political speech is
protected, embracing Tinker.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Then if that's the rule,
the school can make any rule that it wants on any
subject restrictive of speech, and if anyone violates
it, the result is, on your reasoning, it's disruptive
under Tinker.
MR. STARR: Not at all. I think that in
form --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Then I'm missing the
argument.
MR. STARR: The argument is that this Court
in Tinker articulated a rule that allows the school
boards considerable discretion both in identifying the
educational mission and to prevent disruption of that
mission, and this is disruptive of the mission --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, suppose you have --
suppose you have a mission to have a global school. Can
they ban American flags on lapel pins?
MR. STARR: Absolutely not, because under
Tinker that is political expression. Let me be very
specific. This case is ultimately about drugs and other
illegal substances.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: So if the sign had been
"Bong Stinks for Jesus," that would be, and Morse had
the same reaction, that this was demeaning to the
Olympics and it was unruly conduct, that there would be
a protected right under Tinker because the message was
not promoting drugs?
MR. STARR: She stated in her answers to
interrogatories that she may very well not have
interfered with the banner had it in fact said legalize
marijuana. Under our theory, we think she could have
interfered with that because it was disruptive to the
event, it was disorderly to the event itself, but the --
JUSTICE SOUTER: What would be disorderly?
I don't understand this disorder. If somebody holds up
a sign and says change the marijuana laws, why is it
disruptive of anything, simply because the school quite
naturally has said we support the enforcement of the
law, and the law right now does forbid the use of
marijuana.
MR. STARR: I --
JUSTICE SOUTER: It's political speech, it
seems to me. I don't see what it disrupts, unless
disruption simply means any statement of disagreement
with a position officially adopted by the school. Is
that what you mean by disruption?
MR. STARR: No. Your Honor, first of all,
this is, I think, an unusual characterization, namely
for this to be called political speech. We would --
JUSTICE SOUTER: If it's calling -- I mean
--
MR. STARR: We think it's a First -- I'm
sorry.
JUSTICE SOUTER: A call for a change in the
law, I would have supposed, was political speech.
MR. STARR: That wasn't the interpretation.
Your Honor, let's back up, if I may. Someone has to
interpret the message and the front line message
interpreter is the school official. The school official
--
JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, that may be, but
that's not the hypo. The -- the hypothetical is, what
if there is a sign or a statement in the school calling
for a change in, you know, the prohibition against
marijuana use? As a call for change in the law, I would
suppose it was political speech. But as I understood
the argument you were making, it would still be regarded
as an exception, as it were, to Tinker, because it was
disruptive. And it was disruptive in the sense that it
disagreed with official school policy, which was to
enforce the law or support the law as it was. Is that
your position on what disruption means under Tinker?
MR. STARR: But our -- the answer is no.
Because what we are also urging the Court to consider is
its gloss on Tinker and Frazier, and also what this
Court said in Kuhlmeier. And in Frazier, the Court was
very clear, the first three paragraphs in part three of
the opinion, in talking about the habits and manners of
civility, and inculcating the values of citizenship.
That, in fact, is what is happening here. There is an
effort of the -- to prevent a message that is
inconsistent with a fundamental message of the schools,
which is the use of illegal drugs is simply verboten,
and we believe that is permitted under Tinker --
JUSTICE SCALIA: So you want to get away
from a hypothetical then. I don't know why you try to
defend a hypothetical that involves a banner that says
amend the marijuana laws. That's not this case as you
see it, is it?
MR. STARR: Well, it's certainly not this
case, but --
JUSTICE SCALIA: This banner was interpreted
as meaning smoke pot, no?
MR. STARR: It was interpreted -- exactly,
yes. It was interpreted as an encouragement of the drug
culture and --
JUSTICE ALITO: Are you arguing that there
should be a sui generis rule for speech that advocates
illegal drug use, or this broader argument that the
school can suppress any speech that is inconsistent with
its educational mission as the school --
MR. STARR: I think that --
JUSTICE ALITO: -- defines it?
MR. STARR: I apologize. The Court can
certainly decide this on very narrow grounds, that there
are certain substances, illegal drugs, we would include
alcohol and tobacco, that's part of the school's policy,
because those are illegal substances which are very
injurious to health. And this Court has noted that in
Bernonia and in Earls, time and again, it is that these
are very dangerous substances and we have a clear policy
sanctioned by Congress, and also noted by courts across
the country, that illegal drugs are so dangerous that
schools are entitled to have a message going --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But the problem --
the problem, Mr. Starr, is that school boards these days
take it upon themselves to broaden their mission well
beyond education or protection from illegal substances,
and several of the briefs have pointed out school boards
have adopted policies taking on the whole range of
political issues. Now, do they get to dictate the
content of speech on all of those issues simply because
they have adopted that as the part of their educational
mission?
MR. STARR: No, because that may very well
be inconsistent with Tinker. Tinker articulates a
baseline of political speech is, in fact, protected,
subject to --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I think that
-- I think you're right about that, and I guess my
question goes to how broadly we should read Tinker. I
mean, why is it that the classroom ought to be a forum
for political debate simply because the students want to
put that on their agenda? Presumably the teacher's
agenda is a little bit different and includes things
like teaching Shakespeare or the Pythagorean Theorem,
and just because political speech is on the student's
agenda, I'm not sure that it makes sense to read Tinker
so broadly as to include protection of those, that
speech.
MR. STARR: This Court has not read Tinker
quite so broadly in both Frazier and in Kuhlmeier, and
there are a couple of aspects of Tinker that I think are
worthy of note. One, that there was no written policy
there, so there was an issue of standardless discretion
being exercised. And also --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But it may have made a
difference in Tinker. If the school had a policy,
defend our troops in Vietnam, would that have brought
this into the category that you are now carving out?
You said that Tinker had no policy, but suppose the
school did have a policy, patriotism, we support our
troops, no bad speech about the war in Vietnam. Should
Tinker have come out the other way?
MR. STARR: No, it should not, because there
-- I think there are concerns with respect to what this
Court has identified it is trying to, even in the public
school setting, quite apart from the university setting,
to cast a pall of orthodoxy to prevent the discussion of
ideas. What is happening here of course in this case,
it can be decided very narrowly, that drugs, alcohol and
tobacco just have no place in the schools. And --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes, but the rule you
proposed, I thought, in response to my question is that
the school has wide discretion to define its educational
mission and it can restrict speech that's inconsistent
with that mission.
MR. STARR: And that's what this Court in --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: And it seems to me that's
much broader than Tinker. Now you said, well, there is
an exception for political speech. Well, but then
you're right with Justice Ginsburg's hypothetical, let's
suppose that they have a particular view on a political
issue, No Child Left Behind, or foreign intervention and
so forth.
MR. STARR: Justice Kennedy, the words that
you articulated are essentially quotes of Frazier and
Kuhlmeier, so there is a broadening of the lens and a
restoration, frankly, of greater school discretion in
those two cases than one might see in Tinker. They of
course drew, as you well know, from Justice Black's
warning in dissent of Tinker that the Federal courts,
Federal judiciary should not be extending itself unduly
into the work of the school boards' --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Why do we have to get into
the question of what the school board's policy is and
what things they can make its policy? Surely it can be
the -- it must be the policy of any school to discourage
breaking of the law. I mean, suppose this banner had
said kill somebody, and there was no explicit regulation
of the school that said you should not, you should not
foster murder. Wouldn't that be suppressible?
MR. STARR: Of course. That is not --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Of course it would, so --
MR. STARR: The answer is yes.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Why can't we decide this
case on that narrow enough ground, that any school
whether it has expressed the policy or not, can suppress
speech that advocates violation of the law?
MR. STARR: I think it can, but it raises
some interesting potential hypothetical questions, what
about listening to the voice of Martin Luther King
Junior, conscientious objection and so forth. I don't
think the Court needs to stray into those areas because
here we have a written policy which does in fact respond
to concerns about the exercise of standardless
discretion.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Does it have --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Let me just clear up one
thing to be 100 percent sure I understand your position.
It does -- the message is the critical part of this
case. If it was a totally neutral message on a 15-foot
sign, that would be okay. You're not saying 15-foot
signs are disruptive?
MR. STARR: Not inherently disruptive, but
in fact -- the answer is yes. We're not saying that
JUSTICE STEVENS: And so we're focusing on
the message and that's the whole crux of the case.
MR. STARR: That's why this case is here
because of the message.
JUSTICE BREYER: Well, why is that? Why?
Why? I mean suppose you go on a school trip, and the
teacher says on the school trip, I don't want people
unfurling 15 foot banners. I don't care what they are
about.
MR. STARR: It may very well be.
JUSTICE BREYER: We are going to visit the
state capital and we are not marching down the street
with 15 foot banners. I mean, does the First Amendment
say the teacher can't say that?
MR. STARR: It does not. But the Juneau
school board and 5520, Justice Breyer, allows -- in fact
it has a Tinker statement in the first paragraph of
5520, which is also, you will not be advocating drugs.
And so there is essentially a culture of liberty in
Juneau. You don't have to --
JUSTICE BREYER: You just said suppose --
why should I not say that? I mean I'm not going to do
it, necessarily. But why could I not say, would it be
wrong in an opinion to say a school board can on a
school trip tell the students they can't unfurl 15 foot
banners? Is that a correct statement of the law or not?
In your opinion.
MR. STARR: In my opinion it is a correct
statement of the law. But in response to Justice
Stevens' question, the message here is in fact critical
because what we know about this case is that, and you're
here of course to respond to this case, which has to do
with a message that the message interpreter, Deborah
Morse, who by the way --
JUSTICE STEVENS: It's also critical here to
your case that it was a school event. If it, if this
had have been two blocks down the street there would
have been no objection.
MR. STARR: If Mr. Frederick had seen fit to
go down Glacier Avenue to J and J's, a popular hangout,
there would have been no high school jurisdiction.
There may have been elementary school -- but yes. He
could have gone, Justice Stevens, to the State capital
or anywhere along the ten mile route.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Suppose it were Saturday
instead of a weekday.
MR. STARR: I beg your pardon.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Suppose it were Saturday,
not a school day. And the school children were not
required to show up at the Olympic event but were
encouraged to and the same thing happened. Would it
make a difference that it wasn't in the course of a
regular school day?
MR. STARR: No. I think it still, under
your hypothetical would be school sponsored. But there
might be a more difficult showing of disruption or
inconsistency with the educational mission. That is
what this Court articulated in Frazier and again in
Kuhlmeier that the school is able under our policies of
federalism and value of federalism and democratic theory
to fashion its educational mission subject to
constitutional safeguards. And that mission of
preventing the schools from being infected with pro-drug
messages continues wherever there is school
jurisdiction, and that would include on a Saturday field
trip or other kind of activity and I think that --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Starr, you -- you
responded to Justice Breyer that you think the school
could just prohibit the unfurling of 15 foot banners on
a trip. Could it prohibit the wearing of black armbands
on a trip?
MR. STARR: I don't believe so.
JUSTICE SCALIA: And if not -- if not,
what's the difference?
MR. STARR: Because of the potential for
disruption, disorderliness in the event and the judgment
that is entrusted to --
JUSTICE SOUTER: But don't we have to be
more specific about the context in determining whether
there's disruption? If it's a school trip to an art
museum, unfurling a 15 foot banner in front of the
pictures is clearly going to be disruptive of the object
of the trip. Unfurling a banner in a classroom is going
to be disruptive to the teaching of Shakespeare or
whatever is supposed to be going on in there.
What we have here is the unfurling of a
banner on a sidewalk in a crowd with kids throwing
snowballs waiting for some -- somebody to run by with a
TV camera nearby. And there is a real question as to
whether, it seems to me, as to whether it is in a kind
of practical, real world sense, disruptive of anything.
And if there is such a question, shouldn't the answer
favor the right to, to make the speech as opposed to
favor the right to suppress it?
MR. STARR: Your Honor, the answer is no.
We do think that if the test that this Court
has articulated which we embrace, looks not simply to
"disruption" but inconsistency with what this Court has
focused -- this Court's language, the basic educational
mission, then surely --
JUSTICE SOUTER: All right. Let me, let me
follow, actually ask you the same question on -- on
that. Because in response to Justice Scalia's question
you said certainly that the school has got the right to
have a policy that forbids violating the law and calling
for violations of the law.
Accepting that as a premise, don't we need,
before the school may suppress the speech, don't we need
at least a statement which is clearly inconsistent with
that policy? And if that is so, is Bong Hits 4 Jesus
inconsistent with it? It sounds like just a kid's
provocative statement to me.
MR. STARR: Your Honor, with all due
respect, the key is to allow the school official to
interpret the message as long as that interpretation is
reasonable. You might disagree with that just as
Justice Brennan disagreed with whether Matt Frazier's
speech was all that terrible. But he said even though
it wasn't all that terrible I nonetheless defer to the
interpretation of school officials. That's what our
educational system is about.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But those were the words
and characterizing them as offensive/ but here one could
look at these words and say it's just nonsense. Or one
could say it's like mares-eat-oats. It isn't clear that
this is "smoke pot."
MR. STARR: Your Honor, again, Deborah
Morse, a conscientious principal, interpreted the
message in light of the subculture of the school where
drug use is a serious problem. And it was on the spot
judgment. We believe that judgment was reasonable as
opposed to a judgment reached in judicial chambers, but
we know that that was also the judgment of the
superintendent and district judge --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Is that a judgment clear
enough as a matter of law, or is there possible debate
as to whether that's a reasonable interpretation of the
message? Let's assume it was an ambiguous message.
Would we have to accept her interpretation on summary
judgment?
MR. STARR: Yes, I believe you do. And --
well, that's of course a question for the district
judge. And here the judge analyzed the facts in terms
of what the individual was trying to say and determined
that that is a reasonable interpretation and that is all
that is required under this Court's law.
I'd like to reserve the remainder of my
time. Thank you.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel.
Mr. Kneedler.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER,
ON BEHALF OF UNITED STATES AS AMICUS CURIAE,
SUPPORTING PETITIONERS
MR. KNEEDLER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court.
The First Amendment does not require public
school officials to stand aside and permit students who
are entrusted to their supervision and care to promote
or encourage the use of illegal drugs. As this Court
observed in Earls, the nationwide drug - drug epidemic
makes the war against drugs a pressing concern in every
school.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: And is that the rationale
on which you wish us to decide this case, nothing more
broad?
MR. KNEEDLER: The Court need not decide
anything more broadly than that.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm asking what your
recommendation is to what our rule should be this case.
MR. KNEEDLER: Well, I think this is a
manifestation of the principle articulated in Earls and
repeated in Hazelwood that a, school does not have to
tolerate a message that is inconsistent with its basic
educational --
JUSTICE ALITO: Well, that's a very -- I
find that a very, a very disturbing argument, because
schools have and they can defined their educational
mission so broadly that they can suppress all sorts of
political speech and speech expressing fundamental
values of the students, under the banner of, of -- of
getting rid of speech that's inconsistent with
educational missions.
MR. KNEEDLER: That's why I think there
would, there would be, it would make a lot of sense for
the Court to articulate a rule that had to do with
encouraging illegal conduct and particularly --
JUSTICE BREYER: Well, why go into this? I
mean, that's what I actually, seriously don't
understand. Suppose the rule has the following rule:
by the way, on our field trips you can carry around 15
foot banners. They can say anything. Except they can't
talk about drugs and they can't talk about sex and they
can't talk about -- I don't know. Or I'd say three
things. Would that be constitutional?
MR. KNEEDLER: Well -- I think, I think a
school could certainly prohibit the display of banners
on a school trip or in a school assembly.
JUSTICE BREYER: Suppose that this
particular person had whispered to his next door
neighbor, "Bong Hits 4 Jesus, heh heh heh," you know.
Supposed that's what had happened?
(Laughter.)
MR. KNEEDLER: And that may well -- that may
well be different. And that's why I --
JUSTICE BREYER: No. What would be
different -- that's what I -- what a principal that has
to act quickly sees across the street at a school
meeting, a big banner go up making a joke out of drug
use. So the principal acts.
Now, are we supposed to divide that into
little bitsy parts? Because as soon as we do we are
going to get a rather interesting, complicated and very
difficult set of constitutional rules. But you want us
to do that.
MR. KNEEDLER: No. I do not. I think -- I
think the point that you make that a principal sees the
banner across the street and sees the word bong hits,
and -- and at the very moment when the Olympic torch was
about to arrive, I think it was. She made a quick
judgment and an entirely reasonable one that the display
of the slang words bong hits --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, then you're not
arguing for the broad educational mission, which is what
you said at the first.
MR. STARR: Well, there are several
gradations that the Court could take: Advocacy of
illegal conduct generally; more specifically advocacy of
illegal drugs. But I believe -- I think it's important
to recognize that this Court's precedents recognize --
recognize several different justifications for
restricting student speech. In Tinker itself which
dealt with political speech, the Court was careful to
point out that even then, if the speech could be shown
to present a threat of a material disruption to the
class work, and I think this would answer your question,
Mr. Chief Justice, if the teacher wants to teach
Shakespeare, the teacher doesn't have to turn over the
class to political speech.
JUSTICE ALITO: But that's a
viewpoint-neutral regulation. This isn't, the principal
didn't say this was a viewpoint-neutral regulation, did
she?
MR. KNEEDLER: No. No. And -- and, and
just to finish, in Tinker even with a viewpoint concern,
the Court said if you could show material disruption,
and --- and the Court made that clear in Tinker, by, by
its comparison to several lower court decisions where
wearing buttons had been prohibited because they had
caused disruption. And the third category in Tinker
itself was where there would be an intrusion upon the
rights of other students to be secure and be let alone.
That's Tinker dealing with political speech.
But in Frazier and Hazelwood the Court
identified additional categories of speech that could be
governed by the school, and this is in footnote 4 of
Hazelwood. The Court made clear that the ability to
regulate those categories of speech goes beyond the
question of whether there would be disruption or whether
there would be --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So -- so you think
that the, not a 15 foot banner but a very discrete
button that says "legalize marijuana," although it might
be covered as not being disruptive under Tinker, it
could be inconsistent with the school's mission and
prohibited on that basis?
MR. KNEEDLER: Well, I think -- I think if,
if the button is legalize marijuana during a referendum
in the State, then that, that might be the category of
political speech that could not be regulated.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: And at -- at this very
rally, I mean I thought your brief said that it's okay
to work for change in existing law which such a sign
would be, but it is not okay to violate the law. And no
one was smoking pot in that crowd.
MR. KNEEDLER: But -- but the, what was
happening was a sign that was reasonably construed to
encourage the use of illegal drugs.
JUSTICE SOUTER: All right. Given the fact
that this is a First Amendment case, isn't a court
forced into the position if it's going to be consistent
with what else we have said, even at the final appellate
level, of giving pretty careful scrutiny to the
statement itself in determining whether it may be
suppressed or punished?
And if we do that, is it such a reasonable
construction that this is an -- an incitement to illegal
drug use?
I mean it's a statement which makes, makes
the drug law look a little ridiculous, I think, but I'm
not sure that that is very distinguishable from a
statement saying "you ought to change the drug law."
MR. KNEEDLER: Well, I -- I -- I think in,
in this Court's decisions dealing with public schools,
this Court has, has a consistent theme as to give
deference to the judgments by the educators. Public
schools --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Do we have to give -- let
me ask you this. And maybe this is the, as far as we
can go with it here.
Is that the answer to the question here
about what the statement means?
MR. KNEEDLER: Yes.
JUSTICE SOUTER: In other words, if we give
deference your argument wins. But if we don't give
deference, then does anybody really know what the
statement means?
MR. KNEEDLER: I don't think the question is
what Mr. Frederick intended. The question is what a
reasonable observer would think. And the words "bong
hits" are slang that would be particularly, have a
particular characteristic of getting across to other
student, and they suggest a casual tolerance and
encouragement of --
JUSTICE STEVENS: What if the sign said
"bong hits should be legal?"
MR. KNEEDLER: I, I think that would be a
judgment call. I think the, I think the casual use --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Under your view wouldn't
the principal's judgment always prevail?
MR. KNEEDLER: Well it has to be a
reasonable judgment and this is, this is reflected in
Frazier.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Is that a question of fact
or a question of law?
MR. KNEEDLER: Pardon me?
JUSTICE STEVENS: Is whether it's a
reasonable judgment --
MR. KNEEDLER: I think ultimately it's a
question of law, whether it's a reasonable judgment.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: This, this -- this parade
had a theme to celebrate the Olympics, with -- the high
school kids are carrying the torch, the band is in it.
And suppose the banner said vote for, vote Republican,
vote Democrat. And he wants to be on the TV with that.
Could this, the principal make him take that sign out of
the ground in that it's inconsistent with the whole
theme of, of, of the parade? Something like our Kurle
case?
MR. KNEEDLER: Yes. I -- I mean, I think
for this reason. This was essentially an outdoor
assembly, where the -- whether the students were
assembled to watch a particular different, just as in an
indoor assembly.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is that different from the
rationale you've put.
MR. KNEEDLER: Yes. Again, that's why I
don't think there's any one single rule that governs all
cases. This, this I think falls under the Frazier
standard, where the Court said that, that schools have a
duty to inculcate matters of civility and to prepare
students for citizenship, and not violating the law is
an important part of that and teachers' act in loco
parentis. They act as guardians and they should be able
to do, as this Court says in Earls, what a reasonable
guardian would do. That would mean don't allow people
to encourage lawbreaking.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But it wasn't, it wasn't
like an assembly, was it? As I understand it, the
children were released from school, but they were not
required to attend this event and they were not required
to stand in front of the school on the opposite side.
They weren't monitored by their teachers, so they -- and
there were nonstudents in the crowd. So it's not like a
school assembly.
MR. KNEEDLER: The students' present at the
event, presence as the event, was like an assembly.
Students may go into an assembly hall and not have to
sit with their class. They were released from class,
but they were not released from school or school
supervision. There were teachers around there and the
school could define what is the nature of our assembly
at this public event and, just as in, in the auditorium
a school could say there will be no political banners
or, frankly, no banners about anything other than what
the event is --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Were they required to go to
this event and could they have skipped off and gone home
without violating --
MR. KNEEDLER: They were not allowed to go
home. They were required, they were required --
JUSTICE SCALIA: They were required to
attend.
MR. KNEEDLER: They were required to be
there if the classroom teacher decided to let them go
out there, but they were under school supervision at
that time.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Were they ever told what
they were supposed to do in the sense did the school
ever say, we are letting you out on the street to
celebrate the Olympics and to do only that? Was, was
there an object to this release from the school building
that was ever conveyed?
MR. KNEEDLER: If I may, I don't think
there's any question that he knew in advance that this
was about the Olympics. That's why he made the sign.
And they were released to go out and watch the torch go
by. He hasn't raised any question of notice or due
process concerns.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,
Mr. Kneedler.
MR. KNEEDLER: Thank you.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Mertz.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF DOUGLAS K. MERTZ, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. MERTZ: Mr. Chief Justice and may it
please the Court: This is a case about free speech. It
is not a case about drugs.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's a case about
money. Your client wants money from the principal
personally for her actions in this case.
MR. MERTZ: He does have a damages claim
against the school district and the principal, but
that's by no means his chief object here. The
overwhelming object is to assert his free speech --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, would you waive
damages against this principal who has devoted her life
to the school, and you're seeking damages for her for
this sophomoric sign that was held up?
MR. MERTZ: We are certainly willing to
negotiate a minimum settlement of damages. That is not
the object here.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But there's a
broader issue of whether principals and teachers around
the country have to fear that they're going to have to
pay out of their personal pocket whenever they take
actions pursuant to established board policies that they
think are necessary to promote the school's educational
mission.
MR. MERTZ: That is indeed a legitimate
fear, Your Honor, and we believe the existing law takes
care of it by requiring before qualified immunity can be
breached that there be a demonstration that under the
existing law at the time available to her --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And you think it was
clearly established that she had to allow a student at a
school- supervised function to hold a 15-foot banner
saying "Bong Hits 4 Jesus"?
MR. MERTZ: I think it was clearly
established at the time, Your Honor, that a principal
could not engage in viewpoint censorship of a
nondisruptive expression, under both Ninth Circuit law
and this Court's law. The case had --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Does that, does that
general statement that you just made apply to all
circumstances in which a student-teacher relationship
might be involved? For example, in the course of
teaching a class in Shakespeare would your rule prevail?
MR. MERTZ: The rule on qualified immunity?
JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, the general rule which
the teacher is supposed clearly to have known here. For
example, in the Shakespeare class, kid doesn't, doesn't
say anything. He doesn't yell or scream or even raise
his hand. He just holds a little sign in the
Shakespeare class that says "Bong Hits 4 Jesus." As I
understood the general rule that you said the teacher
was bound to know here, the teacher I suppose would be
required or the school would be required to tolerate
that sign in the Shakespeare class; is that correct?
MR. MERTZ: I believe the analysis would be
the Tinker analysis in terms of substantial disruption
of the lesson.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, would there be a
substantial disruption?
MR. MERTZ: It would all depend on the
circumstances. My guess is that if it were simply
passively --
JUSTICE SOUTER: If the kids look around and
they say, well, so and so has got his bong sign again --
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE SOUTER: -- they then return, they
then return to MacBeth. Does the -- does the, does the
teacher have to, does the school have to tolerate that
sign in the Shakespeare class?
MR. MERTZ: I believe that in circumstances
where it is a substantial distraction --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Can't it just say no
signs when you're supposed to be learning?
MR. MERTZ: Your Honor, I think the answer
is yes if they had a content-neutral rule prohibiting
signs in school. I believe that would be --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But can't the school
decide that it's part of its mission to try to prevent
its student from engaging in drug use and so that it's
going to have a viewpoint on drug use and that viewpoint
is going to be that it's opposed to it and so that it
takes a particular view with respect to signs that in
their view seem to encourage drug use?
MR. MERTZ: Certainly it is within the
school's mission to discourage drug use. Certainly it
has many tools to allow it to get its own viewpoint --
certainly it can -- it does not need to provide a forum
in the school itself for students with a contrary
viewpoint. But when a student is basically on his own
time, whether it's outside of school --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So your position
would be different if this were in the student gym and
they were having a discussion. There was a program to
discourage drug use and he held up his sign; you would
say it would be all right to take down the sign inside
the school gym?
MR. MERTZ: No, I'm not so sure.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So it doesn't matter
that this is outside. It matters on the content of the
sign, not the location?
MR. MERTZ: Well, what matters is whether
there is a substantial disruption of what the school is
trying to achieve legitimately, whether it's a classroom
lesson or a lesson on drug use.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, but the school has --
the school has a program, an anti -drug program that
shows movies, it brings in policemen and social workers
to preach against drug use and you're saying that --
never mind unfurling a banner. You're saying that it
has to let students contradict this message it's trying
to teach, to walk around, you know, with a button that
says "Smoke Pot, It's Fun."
MR. MERTZ: I believe, Your Honor --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Does the school have to do
that?
MR. MERTZ: I believe, Your Honor, that a
nondisruptive pin, badge, whatever you want to call it,
would have to be tolerated. However, they would not
have to tolerate a student who interrupts a anti-drug
presentation.
JUSTICE SCALIA: But the school, even though
it is trying to teach one point of view, can allow
students to come in and undermine that point of view,
assuming that it's legitimate to teach that point of
view? It can allow students to come in and undermine
what it's trying to teach?
MR. MERTZ: I think that --
JUSTICE SCALIA: And that is not disruption
in your view?
MR. MERTZ: I think they cannot prevent
presentation of a contrary viewpoint as long as it is
done in such a way that it doesn't interfere with the
school's own presentation of its viewpoint.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Can the student be allowed
to wear a button that says "Rape Is Fun"?
MR. MERTZ: No, I don't think so --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Why?
MR. MERTZ: There is a distinction there.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Why?
MR. MERTZ: Because when you're talking
about hate speech, speech that advocates violence, then
you're in another category of speech. There has been
general recognition --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Nonviolent crimes are okay,
it's only violent crimes that you can't, you can not
promote, right? Right?
MR. MERTZ: I think there is a --
JUSTICE SCALIA: "Extortion Is Profitable,"
that's okay?
MR. MERTZ: Well --
JUSTICE SCALIA: This is a very, very, with
all respect, ridiculous line. I mean, I can understand
you're saying you cannot promote things that are
unlawful, but to say, oh, it's only violent, where do
you get that line from, only violent unlawful acts?
MR. MERTZ: No, I'm not saying only violent
unlawful acts. But this is a case where if you look at
it in the context of what was going on in the State at
the time, where there was an active public debate on
marijuana policy, on marijuana for medical use,
marijuana for personal use, so it's --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So it's a political
-- even assuming it's a political issue, the question is
whether the school has to say our classrooms, our field
trips, our sponsored and supervised activities are a
forum for that debate?
MR. MERTZ: I believe it does not have to if
being a forum would disrupt the school's own educational
program and --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And disruption does
not include undermining the message they want to send?
It has to be some type of physical disruption. But
undermining the message they want to send, they can't
make the judgment that that's not allowed?
MR. MERTZ: Preventing a contrary viewpoint
from being expressed, that we --
JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, but you rephrased it
that way, but what actually happened is the principal
looks across the street, a 15-foot banner goes up at
what's supposed to be a school event with everybody
together in a single place, and it says a joke, it makes
a joke out of drug use. The principal thinks of course
adolescents and post-adolescents sometimes like to test
limits, and if the kids go around having 15-foot banners
making a joke out of drug use that really does make it a
little tougher for me to convince the students at this
school not to use drugs, and particularly putting up
15-foot banners. I don't know why everybody wants to
get away from that because I think you would have had a
very different case if in fact it had been a whisper or
if it had been a serious effort to contest the drug
laws. It wasn't either. It was a joke. It was a
15-foot banner. We have the message plus the means plus
the school event.
Now, what's your response?
MR. MERTZ: My response, Your Honor, is
that, first of all, a 14-foot banner.
JUSTICE BREYER: That's an excellent
response, I think.
(Laughter.)
MR. MERTZ: That was just a preliminary. In
fact, what it was was a person displaying this banner in
a quiet, passive manner that didn't interfere with
anybody's observation.
JUSTICE BREYER: I conceive that
interference consists of it's pretty hard to run a
school where kids go around at public events publicly
making a joke out of drugs. That's what his thought is.
Now, I don't think he has to be able to read content
discrimination, viewpoint discrimination, time-place.
He doesn't know the law, the principal. His job is to
run the school. And so I guess what I'm worried about
is a rule that would -- is on your side, a rule that
takes your side; we'll suddenly see people testing
limits all over the place in the high schools. But a
rule that against your side may really limit people's
rights on free speech. That's what I'm struggling with.
Now, I want some help there and I'm worried about the
principal.
MR. MERTZ: I believe the answer is that the
Tinker case as we understand it struck a very wise
compromise between allowing school officials to have
complete discretion to suppress student speech in order
to maintain what they conceive of as their individual
mission and the student's right to speak in a
nondisruptive manner. The speaker -- the Tinker case
has stood the test of time for 40, almost 30 years and,
although --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you can say that, but
the subsequent cases seem to me to try to cut back on
it. I mean, it stood the test of time in the sense that
it hasn't been overruled, but --
MR. MERTZ: There have been some narrow
exceptions to it in subsequent cases, of course, the
Frazier and the Kuhlmeier cases. But the basic, the
heart of it, the requirement that the school demonstrate
that substantial disruption before it can engage in
suppression of --
JUSTICE SCALIA: I think we're using
disruption in two different senses here and we should
probably separate the two. One sense is disrupting the
class so that whatever is being taught can't be taught.
But you're also using it in the sense of undermining a
general message that the school is trying to get across:
Obey the law, don't use drugs, whatever. Maybe we
should have a different word for -- the first is
disruption. Disruption is a, is a funny word for the
second. Let's called it undermining instead.
Now, you think both of them, however, are
bad and both of them can be a basis for suppressing the
speech?
MR. MERTZ: If I understand your question
correctly, the second of them might better be called
allowing competing viewpoints.
JUSTICE SCALIA: So you think undermining is
perfectly okay? You would never consider undermining to
be disruption and therefore bad?
MR. MERTZ: I think undermining in the sense
of preventing impeding the school from delivering its
own message --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay, but only that.
MR. MERTZ: -- would be substantial
disruption.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Right after a class on
drugs, he can be standing there in the hall and say:
This class was ridiculous, drugs are good for you, I use
them all the time, I urge all of you. That's perfectly
okay? That's not undermining?
MR. MERTZ: I believe that is the kind of
speech --
JUSTICE SCALIA: That's not disruption?
MR. MERTZ: -- that we must tolerate no
matter how unwise it is.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But couldn't the school,
couldn't the school board have a time, place, or manner
regulation that says you're not going to use the halls
to proselytizer for your cause, whatever it may be?
MR. MERTZ: I believe that's correct.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: You could have reasonable
rules of decorum for what goes on inside the school
building.
MR. MERTZ: Right.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Does the school have
to be completely neutral in that respect? Does it have
to punish who says that was a good program, I'm not
going to use drugs, and you shouldn't either, because
he's taking position on a public issue?
MR. MERTZ: I think a content neutral,
content neutrality is critical here, and if the school
wants to allow anti-drug comments, messages, then it has
an outside of the official forum --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Where does that
notion that our schools have to be content neutral -- I
thought we wanted our schools to teach something,
including something besides just basic elements,
including the character formation and not to use drugs.
They have to be neutral on whether you should use drugs
or not?
MR. MERTZ: Content neutrality goes to what
speech is suppressed or punished. As far as the school
delivering its own message, there is no requirement of
equal time or that it be neutral. It's got its own
viewpoint in the case of drugs, a viewpoint that almost
all of us agree with, and it should be able to espouse
--
JUSTICE SCALIA: A school isn't an open
forum. A school isn't there for everybody to teach the
students whatever he wants. It's there for the teachers
to instruct. And you're turning it into an open forum.
If the school says, addresses one issue, everybody else
has to be able to address that issue.
MR. MERTZ: I don't believe that's the case
at all, Your Honor.
JUSTICE SCALIA: That's not my vision of
what a school is.
MR. MERTZ: In the classroom delivering the
prescribed messages, in the school assemblies, when the
school wishes to present a particular message, that's
one case. However, in the lunchroom, outside in recess,
across the street, that is a quintessentially open forum
where it would not be proper, I think, to tell students
you may not mention this subject, you may not take this
position.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: But do you concede that
there was some right of school control for what was
going on across the street?
MR. MERTZ: No. Actually our primary
position on that is that he was in a public place at a
public event among public people --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: If kids were throwing
bottles and injuring passers by, the principal had no
right or duty to go over there and stop it?
MR. MERTZ: Oh, I think if they were
engaging in an act of hooliganism --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, that's because the
school has a right of control.
MR. MERTZ: There is a distinction here.
This young man had not been in school today, had not
been an campus, was not in any class that was released
to --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why did he go where
he went?
MR. MERTZ: Pardon?
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why did he choose
that location to unfurl his banner?
MR. MERTZ: He explained because it was the
only place where he actually knew the route of the
relay.
JUSTICE BREYER: But I mean, that's -- I
have, I guess his note, you accept this with what the
teacher said. The entire class went to view the relay.
Individual students -- this is at 9:30 in the morning.
They were not given the option of remaining in class,
nor were they released to do as they pleased. They were
to watch the relay with the rest of the student body,
either just in front of the school or just across the
street -- that's me, not them -- and then return
directly to their classrooms, which I guess the school
did. So it sounds like you're going to one place, stand
together, behave yourselves, watch the relay, and the
teachers will be there and take you back to class. Now
is there something else in the record that suggests
something different?
MR. MERTZ: There is a major dispute on that
point, Your Honor. We presented several affidavits that
showed individual teachers --
JUSTICE BREYER: Just tell me where to look.
Where are the conflicting affidavits? I'm just reading
from page 51 of the joint appendix. I didn't know there
was a dispute.
MR. MERTZ: It would be on pages 32, 34, 36.
JUSTICE BREYER: Okay, I'll look at those.
Another somewhat minor point. Can I ask you another
point about the record? I'll read those.
MR. MERTZ: Okay. Can I finish the
description of what actually happened? According to the
students, for those who were released from class, there
was no requirement for staying on campus, and many of
them did not stay on campus. No requirement for --
JUSTICE BREYER: No, they went across the
street.
MR. MERTZ: Some of them did. Some went
down --
JUSTICE BREYER: Was there any -- there was
no requirement, they didn't have to go across the street
or stay on campus, they could wander off distantly.
MR. MERTZ: They could, and many of them
did.
JUSTICE BREYER: Okay.
MR. MERTZ: And there was no requirement
that they stay together, no requirement that they do
anything in particular. They --
JUSTICE SCALIA: I had to watch -- not even
watch the parade, no requirement they watch the parade?
They were released in order to watch the parade.
MR. MERTZ: That was the intent, obviously,
for those released.
JUSTICE SCALIA: The intent, it was the
direction.
MR. MERTZ: But --
JUSTICE SCALIA: It was not only the intent,
it was the direction.
MR. MERTZ: Actually it was not. According
to these student affidavits, they were simply released
and said, you can go watch --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Was there any fact
finding on that? You referred to affidavits.
MR. MERTZ: No. It was decided on cross
motions for summary judgment in the district court, and
there were no findings, actually no factual findings at
all, and certainly nothing on that particular point.
JUSTICE BREYER: Can I ask you another
record point, just so I know where to look?
MR. MERTZ: Yes.
JUSTICE BREYER: You've also asked for an
injunction that would require expunging his 5-day
suspension from his record.
MR. MERTZ: Correct.
JUSTICE BREYER: 10 days. Well, 10 or 5,
unclear. I noticed the superintendent of schools on
page 66A when he's reviewing this, what he says is,
"Joseph contends that all his behavior is excusable
because he was exercising his free of speech right.
Even if I were to concede his speech across from the
high school is protected, which I do not, the rest of
his behavior warranted the suspension." And then he
says, "And I'm cutting it from 10 days to 5. So given
that, if you win, suppose you were to win, and you --
that it is protected and so forth -- then would you
concede or not concede the suspension, the 5 days, it's
over, it still stands, I don't care about the
expungement or not?
MR. MERTZ: The -- whether it remains on the
record, anything that remains on his record is obviously
much more --
JUSTICE BREYER: No, but I'm asking that you
think about it. I'm putting you on the spot.
MR. MERTZ: In that case, I missed the point
of your --
JUSTICE BREYER: I want to know what the
superintendent said. As I read it is, he says, look, I
don't care if this was protected or not. I'll give you
that. It's protected. But the rest of his behavior,
the way he treated the principal, what he did, the
reluctance, et cetera, et cetera, that warrants a
suspension too, and I'm cutting it from 10 days to 5.
So it sounds to me as I read it that the teacher is
saying even if you're right, he's still suspended for 5
days. That's what the superintendent says.
Now suppose you win your point that you're
interested in winning, which you may not or you may.
Are you still then going to pursue this case on the 5
days, that that should be erased?
MR. MERTZ: If the only thing left were
discipline because he was tardy that day, was -- didn't
divulge the names of the other people holding the
banner, that sort of thing, we couldn't --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I think it's --
JUSTICE BREYER: You couldn't what? I
didn't hear the last part of what you said. You just
got to the point of --
MR. MERTZ: Of answering the question.
JUSTICE BREYER: Yes. What's the answer?
MR. MERTZ: Those things wouldn't manner
anymore.
JUSTICE BREYER: So you would not pursue it?
MR. MERTZ: Correct.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Can we get back --
I'm sorry.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Go ahead.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Can we get back to
what the case is about. You think the law was so
clearly established when this happened that the
principal, that the instant that the banner was
unfurled, snowballs are flying around, the torch is
coming, should have said oh, I remember under Tinker I
can only take the sign down if it's disruptive. But
then under Frazier I can do something if it interferes
with the basic mission, and under Kuhlmeier I've got
this other thing. So she should have known at that
point that she could not take the banner down, and it
was so clear that she should have to pay out of her own
pocket because of it.
MR. MERTZ: Mr. Chief Justice, there are two
different time points we have to talk about. There's
the heat of the moment out there on the street, but then
later back in the office when she actually decided to
levy the punishment after she had talked to him, after
she heard why he did it and why he didn't do it, after
she had had a chance to consult with the school
district's counsel. At that point in the calmness of
her office, then she should indeed have known it. And
she did testify that she had taken a master's degree
course in school law in which she studied Kuhlmeier and
Frazier and Tinker. So --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And so it should be
perfectly clear to her exactly what she could and
couldn't do.
MR. MERTZ: Yes.
JUSTICE SCALIA: As it is to us, right?
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE SOUTER: I mean, we have had a
debate here for going on 50 minutes about what Tinker
means, about the proper characterization of the
behavior, the nonspeech behavior. The school's terms in
dealing with the kids that morning. The meaning of the,
of the statement. We've been debating this in this
courtroom for going on an hour, and it seems to me
however you come out, there is reasonable debate.
Should the teacher have known, even in the, in the calm
deliberative atmosphere of the school later, what the
correct answer is?
MR. MERTZ: We believe at the very least she
should have known that one cannot punish a nondisruptive
holding of a sign because it said something you
disagreed with.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Of course I disagree with
the characterization on disruptive. It was completely
disruptive of the message, of the theme that the school
wanted to promote. Completely disruptive of the reason
for letting the students out to begin with. Completely
disruptive of the school's image that they wanted to
portray in sponsoring the Olympics.
MR. MERTZ: Well, they weren't sponsoring
the Olympics, they weren't even sponsoring this event
actually. They simply let the students out to watch it.
That was --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Some of the students were
carrying the torch and the band was playing in the
parade.
MR. MERTZ: A few of the student -- a few of
the relay runners were from the school and had been
allowed to skip school because of that, and the pep band
played as it went by. I do not believe that made the
torch relay a school event. The best that can be said
for them is that they let the students watch it with the
concurrence of individual teachers, and that that
attendance was a school sanctioned attendance. Now
whether that allows them to then engage in this kind of
punishment for speech by a student who was not even
among those released, who is standing --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Now you said that in your
brief, and I couldn't understand that somehow you got
mileage out of his being truant that morning. Would the
case have come out differently, would you be making any
different argument if he got to school on time and was
released with the rest of them? Does the case turn on
the fact that he was late to school that day?
MR. MERTZ: We believe it would be a closer
question, but the fact that he was not there in school
today, and intentionally was not there today, turns this
into a pure free speech case where you have a citizen in
a public place in a public event who was not acting as a
student.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: So he's not a school
child, he would be playing hooky?
MR. MERTZ: Because he was playing hooky
because he chose not to be there, because he was not
part of the class.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Even though the law
required him to be there?
MR. MERTZ: That's right.
JUSTICE SCALIA: He wasn't playing hooky.
He showed up late, that's all, right? I mean, he
actually came and joined his classmates at an event that
he knew was an event that the school told the classes to
go to.
MR. MERTZ: He joined --
JUSTICE SCALIA: As far as I'm concerned, he
just showed up late.
MR. MERTZ: He joined a public crowd on a
private side -- public sidewalk in front of private
homes. The crowd happened to have some other students
in that school there.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Where did he go
immediately after? He went to the school building for
whatever it was, the third period of the day.
MR. MERTZ: Yes. The principal instructed
him to do so and he did.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: So under your view, if the
principal sees something wrong in the crowd across the
street, had to come up and say now, how many here are
truants and how many here are -- I can't discipline you
because you're a truant, you can go ahead and throw the
bottle.
(Laughter.)
MR. MERTZ: No, I don't think she needs to
do that in the heat of the moment. But later on once
she's discovered the true facts, then at that point I
think she loses a basis for punishing him as a student
if he was not there as a student.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Because you're both a
truant and disrupter, you get off.
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE SCALIA: Had you been just a
disrupter, tough luck.
MR. MERTZ: Well, it may well be that he
could have been punished for being truant, but of course
that's not why we're here. He was punished for
displaying, for the content of the sign he was
displaying in a public place as a private citizen.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Who were the people that
helped him hold up his flag? Were they not classmates
of his?
MR. MERTZ: Most of them were classmates; at
least one was not a student.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Did he not know that these
classmates were there at a public event that was
sponsored, not sponsored, but to which the school had
directed the students to go?
MR. MERTZ: I'm sure he did know.
JUSTICE SCALIA: So it seems to me it's like
joining a school trip at the zoo, you know. You -- you
don't make it to the -- to the school, but you drive
there yourself and then join the class as it's going
through the zoo. It seems to me he's in school.
MR. MERTZ: A better analogy might be if he
had gone on his own time to the zoo and was engaging in
some expressive act, and there happened to be a school
group there at the same time, could the teacher with
that group then have disciplined him for what he was
doing?
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That gets back to
the point I was trying to make earlier. He came here
because it was the school event, the school sponsored
activity. He could have gone anywhere along the route.
He knew that it was coming by the school, he knew that
they were going to be, the students were going to be
released to see it. He went to join up with the school
even if he were truant that day.
MR. MERTZ: No, Your Honor. I believe
that's incorrect. There is nothing in the record that
even suggests that he went there in order to join up
with schoolmates or in order to be near the school. He
says, in fact, he intentionally tried to avoid the
school because he thought that that way he could avoid
the school jurisdiction for his --
JUSTICE SCALIA: You think he could have
been marked absent for the whole day because he didn't
intend to be part of the school group afterwards? I
mean, suppose there's a suspension of so much for half a
day truancy, and so much more for a whole day's truancy.
And he shows up and he says, oh, you can't -- you have
to hold me for a whole day's truancy because I didn't
intend to be in school. I was in school but I didn't
intend to be there.
MR. MERTZ: I think it would all depend on
whether he --
JUSTICE SCALIA: That doesn't make any sense
to me. Does it depend on his intent, whether or not he
intended to be a truant that afternoon?
MR. MERTZ: I think that would depend on the
fact of whether he was a truant that afternoon.
JUSTICE SCALIA: He was either in school or
he wasn't in school.
MR. MERTZ: In the morning he wasn't in
school.
JUSTICE SCALIA: In the afternoon he either
was or he wasn't.
MR. MERTZ: In the afternoon he was.
JUSTICE SCALIA: And the question is whether
joining the school group, intentionally joining the
school group, going there because the school group was
there, whether that places him in school.
MR. MERTZ: As a hypothetical, if he were
intentionally joining a school group, I would have to
say that puts him within whatever jurisdiction the
school has.
JUSTICE BREYER: Why does it matter? That
is, why doesn't the -- you're suing the teacher or the
principal and why wouldn't the issue be what that
principal really reasonably thought the situation was?
I mean, if a principal reasonably thought he was part of
the school group, if the principal reasonably thought
that this was a school outing, if the principal
reasonably thought that students are staying together,
why wouldn't that just be the ground on which you'd take
the case, we should take it that way, because the
principal reasonably thinks?
MR. MERTZ: As far as qualified immunity, I
think that's correct, if she had a reasonable belief.
JUSTICE BREYER: But even on the merits?
MR. MERTZ: On the merits I don't think so,
because if he was not in fact there as part of a school
group --
JUSTICE BREYER: Even if the principal
couldn't tell him to take down the manner even if she
thought he was part of the school group reasonably, if
he really wasn't?
MR. MERTZ: I do not believe there's
anything in the law that allows a principal to convert a
pure free speech exercise into a school exercise because
it's --
JUSTICE SCALIA: I thought you were going to
appeal to the calm of her office the next day. I
thought that was going to be your answer to my question.
Whatever she thought at the time, she didn't think it
later.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: May I ask to you clarify
one thing. I initiated this line of questioning when I
said I was surprised that your brief made such a big
deal that he was late to school. You would still be
making the argument about the free speech right if he
had diligently showed up for his math class first period
in the morning, gone out with the others, and had his
banner to unfurl when the torch came by?
MR. MERTZ: That is correct. We have two
independent bases for defending him here. One is the
pure free speech in a public place argument. That's the
one that hinges on the fact that he was not among the
released students. The other argument, which we believe
in equally, is that even if it were a on-campus or on an
extension of campus like a field trip, then under Tinker
because it was not disruptive they cannot punish it.
My time is up. I thank the Court.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,
Mr. Mertz.
Mr. Starr, you have a minute remaining.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF KENNETH W. STARR
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS
MR. STARR: For the reasons that have been
discussed, under no circumstances should Deborah Morse,
a conscientious principal, be subjected to the
possibility of punitive damages or compensatory damages.
A very brief factual point. In light of the
richness of the discussion with respect to the facts, I
would guide the Court to page 109 of the joint appendix.
This is Deborah Morse's interrogatory answer and there
she sets forth the facts, and that bleeds into the law.
To promote drugs -- and this is our
fundamental suggestion and submission. To promote drugs
is utterly inconsistent with the basic educational
mission of the school, and for this Court to suggest to
the contrary would really be quite inconsistent with
much of its drug jurisprudence, Bernonia and Earls. The
opinion of the Court in Earls 2002 is especially
powerful with respect to the scourge of drugs and their
dangers.
More broadly, the Court does not need to go
more broadly, but the Court has spoken more broadly with
respect to the need to defer to school officials in
identifying the educational mission. But we know that
there are in fact constitutional limits. Those limits
are captured in Tinker. A passive pure political speech
that reflects on the part of the school board a
standardless discretionary effort to squelch any kind of
controversial discussion, that casts a pall of orthodoxy
over the classroom. We are light years away from that.
I thank the Court.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you counsel,
the case is submitted.
(Whereupon, at 11:04 a.m., the case in the
above-entitled matter was submitted.)
