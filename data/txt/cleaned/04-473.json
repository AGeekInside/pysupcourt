LEE: Chief Justice Roberts, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe issue presented is whether the first\namendment requires protection for all public employee\nspeech that touches on a matter of public concern without\nany consideration of whether the speech was expressed as a\ncitizen.\nThe Ninth Circuit's approach affords no\nconsideration for the role of the speaker as a citizen or\nan employee at the time of the speech. This approach,\nhowever, plants a seed of a constitutional claim in\nvirtually every speech that public employees express while\ncarrying out their regular job duties.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, that's -- I mean, I can\nsee --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Do you think that the Court\ntried to apply the Pickering test?\nMS. LEE: The Ninth Circuit clearly did not\napply the Pickering test when they were doing the initial\nanalysis, a threshold analysis, of whether or not the\nspeech at issue was constitutionally protected.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Do you think that the\nPickering test, properly applied, would have reached a\ndifferent result in this case?\nMS. LEE: Not necessarily, not the way the Ninth\n--\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: It could have --\nMS. LEE: -- Circuit viewed it.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- certainly.\nMS. LEE: Well, in the Ninth Circuit's view, the\ncapacity of an employee at the time of the speech is of\nsome factor. It's a determinative factor. But, in its\nview, it was a factor that should be weighed against\nfinding no constitutional protection. In its view --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Do you think that the proper\napplication of Pickering would yield a different result in\nthis case?\nMS. LEE: Our view is that --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Could it?\nMS. LEE: -- if the application of the Pickering\nis rearticulated such that when job-required speech is at\nissue, like in this case, the employer should invariably\nwin or have a -- an easier time of prevailing. But, in\nthis case, the Ninth Circuit didn't see it that way. The\nNinth Circuit took the view that the capacity of an\nemployee at the time of the speech is a factor, but it\nwould be difficult for an employer to justify employment\ndecisions made when the employee is speaking as required\nby the duties of employment.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Counsel, you've made the point\nthat if we go the Ninth Circuit way, every time an\nemployee gets in Dutch there's a potential first amendment\nissue. Why hasn't that been a problem since 1988 in the\nNinth Circuit? I think 1988 was the year of the Circuit's\nRoth decision. So, we haven't seen a deluge, and doesn't\nthat rather discount your argument?\nMS. LEE: Well, our view is that if we accept\nthe Ninth Circuit's approach, then speech by public\nemployees expressed while carrying out their assigned job\nduties would virtually -- invariably be --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No.\nMS. LEE: -- a matter --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I realize that, but that -- as\nI understand it, that has been true since the Ninth\nCircuit's Roth decision in 1988. And apparently we have\nnot seen a deluge of these claims, or we would have had\ncitations to the cases. So, doesn't that rather discount\nthe concern that you express?\nMS. LEE: Not necessarily. The Ninth Circuit\nand the other circuits that have made, primarily, content\nthe determinative factor in finding presumptive first-\namendment protection have, in some regards, considered the\ncapacity of an employee as whether or not the speech\nshould be protected under the first amendment, but they've\ndone so in the context of whether or not it is a matter of\npublic concern. So, the Ninth Circuit is alone in having\naddressed squarely whether or not job-required speech\nshould not be afforded presumptive first-amendment\nprotection. The other --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But didn't -- maybe I'm wrong\non my assumption, but didn't the Ninth Circuit take that\nposition, back in 1988?\nMS. LEE: That's correct.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What do you do with a\npublic university professor, who -- is fired for the\ncontent of his lectures? Certainly, in the course of his\nemployment, that's what he's paid to do. That has no\nfirst-amendment protection?\nMS. LEE: Well, it would be our view that if the\nassigned job duties of that university professor was to\nspeak on a particular topic or content, and they were\ngetting paid for doing that, that that is a job-required\nspeech and that it should not be entitled, presumptively,\nto first-amendment protection. Now, that is a far cry\nfrom --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: \"Should not be entitled,\npresumptively, to first-amendment protection,\" what does\nthat mean? That there might be first amendment\nprotection, in light of the particular context --\nMS. LEE: Our --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- of the speech?\nMS. LEE: Well, according to the Ninth Circuit's\nview, anything -- anytime a public employee speaks, and\nthat speech relates to a matter of public concern, that is\npresumptively entitled to first-amendment protection, such\nthat the burden is on the employer to justify the\ndecisions for the employment actions taken.\nOur view is that the employer should not have\nthat burden until the first threshold is made, that the\nspeech is expressed as a citizen on a matter of public\nconcern.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I suppose that, in the\nsituation the Chief Justice mentioned, the professor would\nstill be able to contend that the university fired him\nbecause it disagreed with the political content of his\nspeech or because of the university's politics. He could\nstill make that claim, couldn't he?\nMS. LEE: Our approach would not prohibit that\n--\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But the --\nMS. LEE: -- kind of --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- burden would be on him, as\nit would be in most cases --\nMS. LEE: That's correct, Justice Scalia.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- to show that that was true.\nMS. LEE: That's correct.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Whereas, the Ninth Circuit\nwould put it on the -- put the burden on the university to\nshow that it wasn't true.\nMS. LEE: That's correct. The ninth --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I would have thought you\nmight have argued that it's speech paid for by the\nGovernment, that's what they pay him for, it's their\nspeech; and so, there's no first-amendment issue at all.\nMS. LEE: In essence, the principle of our\napproach is supported by those Government subsidizer\ncases, like the Rust v. Sullivan. Our --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But in Rust v. Sullivan, the\nGovernment was buying a commodity. It was the\nGovernment's program, and it was employing people, funding\npeople to implement that program. Here is a person whose\njob includes being candid, serving justice, serving truth.\nIf that's part of his job responsibilities, that's quite\ndifferent from speaking the speech that the Government\nwants spoken.\nMS. LEE: Well, in this case, we think that the\njob duties are aligned with those subsidizer cases. We\nhave a deputy district attorney whose job duty was to\nassess the merits of the prosecution's case, which he did.\nThat includes assessing the credibility of a witness.\nBecause his conclusions in this case were that the\nprosecution's witness was not very credible does not make\nthat task extraordinary.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I guess if your job is to speak\ntruth, and you speak falsehood, that's a good reason to\nfire you, which is what happened here.\nMS. LEE: That could be a --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But you don't --\nMS. LEE: -- legitimate reason. Or --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- contend that, do you?\nMS. LEE: -- or the employer doesn't --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Do you contend --\nMS. LEE: -- necessarily have to --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- that his statement was\nfalse? Do you contend the speech was false?\nMS. LEE: Our position is that the speech was\ninaccurate and that --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, but how do we know that?\nWe're at summary judgment.\nMS. LEE: Well, we have the -- the deputy\ndistrict attorney's disposition memorandum assessed that\n-- in his view, that the prosecution was going to lose on\nthe pending motion to dismiss, in -- on the grounds of\nthat the search warrant was going to be -- was going to be\nfound invalid. That was the essence of the deputy\ndistrict attorney's assessment. And in his memorandum, as\npart of his prosecutorial duties, he evaluated that. He\ntold his supervisor, \"Look, you know, I'm looking at the\ncredibility of the officer. I conducted an investigation.\nI don't think we're going to win on this case.\" The\nsupervisor initially thought, \"Okay, you have a point,\"\nbut ultimately decided, \"You know what? I'm not as sure\nas you are. We have a motion to traverse on calendar,\nwhere we have a judge who's going to be assessing that, so\nlet's see what happens.\" That judge found that the search\nwarrant was valid. And so, in essence, we have a public\nemployee who is challenging employment decisions made by\nhis supervisors --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, I realize that, but where\ndo you -- how do you infer, from that, that the\nindividual, the employee, was not telling the truth?\nMS. LEE: That --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: If --\nMS. LEE: It is not our --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- if I --\nMS. LEE: -- position --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- if my ethical record\namounted to a lie every time I made a -- an inaccurate\nprediction about what a court was going to do when I was a\nyoung lawyer, I would have had a very short career.\n[Laughter.]\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And that seems to me as much as\nyou can infer from what this individual did.\nMS. LEE: Justice Souter, it is not our\nposition, and we have never taken the stance, that the\ndeputy district attorney in this case was reckless in\nregards of his speech --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Oh. Oh. Okay.\nMS. LEE: -- or his evaluation.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So, we don't --\nMS. LEE: Our view is that --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- we don't know why it didn't\npan out the way he said it was going to, and we don't know\nthat he was -- that he was lying.\nMS. LEE: Correct. What --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.\nMS. LEE: -- we do know is that the -- it is our\nview that the supervisor -- while the supervisor contended\nthat he did not react to this speech adversely, that he\ncould have. We have here speech that was required by the\njob. The employee here -- if we take the Ninth Circuit's\napproach, we would be providing public employees a\nconstitutional right to perform their assigned job-\nrequired duties in a way that is to the dissatisfaction of\nthe public employer.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You don't have to establish\nthat he was lying; just that his prediction -- his job,\nwas to predict, and he made a -- an erroneous -- a false\nprediction. Don't have to show that he intended to do\nthat.\nMS. LEE: That's correct, Justice Scalia.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, but the disposition by\nthe -- I mean, his grievance by the hearing examiner was\nthat there was no retaliation. He assumed that the speech\nwas proper and there was no inefficiency or misconduct on\nthe part of the speaker.\nMS. LEE: Well, the internal grievance procedure\nresulted in the finding that the supervisors did not\nretaliate against the deputy district attorney for the --\nfor his job-required duties.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And, in my understanding, that\nwas the only defense that was made for the charge, that,\n\"We didn't retaliate.\" There was no claim that the speech\nwas improper in any way. Am I wrong on that?\nMS. LEE: That's correct --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yes.\nMS. LEE: -- Justice Stevens.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: So, we assume, for purposes of\nour case, that what he said was totally accurate and did\nnot, itself, provide the basis for saying he was\nincompetent or something of that -- like that.\nMS. LEE: Well, we assume, for purposes of the\nsummary judgment motion, that he was within his\nprosecutorial duties in making those assessments.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Can I ask you one --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me, I'm not sure I\nunderstood the answer to the first question, John. Was he\nnot fired because he had made an improper assessment?\nJUSTICE STEVENS: No.\nMS. LEE: No, our position has never been that\nthe supervisors took any retaliatory action as a result of\nhis speech. He was not fired. What the --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes.\nMS. LEE: -- deputy district attorney --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Right.\nMS. LEE: -- challenges here is various\nemployment decisions by his supervisor, claiming that they\nwere in retaliation for him having prepared and\ncommunicated a disposition memorandum that was within the\ncourse and scope of his employment duties.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And your defense is that the --\nMS. LEE: Our --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- actions were not taken with\nany reference to this -- to this at all.\nMS. LEE: -- our position has been that the\nemployer could certainly have reacted, or responded, to\nthe speech or the way he conducted his job, or performed\nhis job, but they didn't, in this case. There were --\nthere were legitimate business reasons for the employment\n--\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But that's surely a --\nMS. LEE: -- decisions made.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- surely a factual inquiry,\nwhich will be disputed. If you want to win on summary\njudgment, it seems to me you have to establish that,\nassuming he was fired because of this speech, that would\nbe -- or not promoted because of his speech -- that would\nbe perfectly okay.\nMS. LEE: That's correct --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's where --\nMS. LEE: -- Justice Scalia.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- we are.\nMS. LEE: That's --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: We assume --\nMS. LEE: -- that's correct.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- that that was the reason for\nthe later actions.\nMS. LEE: And the problem with the Ninth\nCircuit's approach is that every time there is job\nperformance at issue that's required by the public\nemployee, it essentially puts the question before a jury\nor a Federal court to assess the motives --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But what is your position?\nMS. LEE: -- to assess the reasonableness of the\ndecisions made.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Ms. Lee, is your position\nthat job-required speech -- an assistant district\nattorney's obligation is to give his best opinion -- that\njob-required speech is outside the first-amendment\nprotection? You say the Ninth Circuit went too far, in\none way. But are you saying that as long as it's related\nto his job, it's simply not protected by the first\namendment? Is that your position?\nMS. LEE: Our view is that job-required speech\nis not of a character for which principles of first\namendment should protect. In Pickering, the public school\nteacher sought to be treated as a member of the general\npublic when he sent his letter to the newspaper\ncriticizing the allocation of financial resources by the\nschool board.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, I understand --\nMS. LEE: Nothing like that arises --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- I understand that, but I\nwas confused by your answer to Justice O'Connor, because\nthe question was, Would this come out a different way\nunder Pickering? And I take it your answer is, this\ndoesn't come in the door, because he's not speaking as a\ncitizen.\nMS. LEE: Under the current -- my -- under my\ncurrent understanding of the Pickering balancing -- which\nis -- shifts the burden to the employer to justify the\nemployment decisions made -- that we don't -- I don't\nnecessarily believe that the Pickering would clearly weigh\nin favor of the employer in this case, even though the\nspeech was so connected to the duties of employment --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I'm confused. You think that\nthis -- there was an aspect of it that was citizen speech?\nWhy --\nMS. LEE: No.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I --\nMS. LEE: We contend that it should -- in\nsituations where the speech at issue is job-required, and\nthat employee is getting paid for engaging in that kind of\nduty, that the balance should weigh in favor of the\nemployer. And I believe the respondent --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, what do you mean --\nMS. LEE: -- concedes as much.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- by \"the balance, weigh in\nfavor\"? Because, a moment ago, I thought you answered me,\n\"This kind of speech simply is not shielded by the\" --\nMS. LEE: That's correct.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- \"first amendment.\"\nMS. LEE: Our -- the -- our view is that job-\nrequired speech should not be protected under the first\namendment, so there is no need to go into the balancing,\nthere is no need to go into the weighing of the interests\nof the employer versus the interest of the employee. The\nbalancing has been required in the -- in the line of cases\nthat the Court has held -- the language that the Court has\nused in this first-amendment public-employment context is,\nwhen you do the balancing, you weigh the interests of the\nState, as an employer, versus the interests of the\nemployee, as a citizen, when engaging in this speech. Our\nview is that the balancing should only be required when\nthe --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: You would give --\nMS. LEE: -- public employee --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- greater protection to a\npublic speech than to a comment from -- on the job from --\nto one's superior. Can you give me an example of a\nstatement that would provide -- be entitled to complete\nfirst-amendment protection if made in a speech, but could\njustify a discharge if made face to face with your\nemployer?\nMS. LEE: I'm sorry, could you repeat that?\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Could you give me an example\nof a statement that would be protected in a public speech,\nbut, if made privately to your superior, could provide the\nbasis for a discharge?\nMS. LEE: I believe the Court's referring to\nfacts similar to Givhan, where there you had speech made\nprivately to a supervisor, and --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Which was --\nMS. LEE: -- this Court --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- protected.\nMS. LEE: -- this Court has found that it was\nprotected under the first amendment.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yes.\nMS. LEE: However, the Court did not need to\naddress the role of the speaker in that case, because\nthere you had an English teacher who was criticizing the\nracial --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: You're not --\nMS. LEE: -- policies --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- responding to my question.\nMy question is, Can you give me an example of a statement\nthat would be entitled to protection if made in a public\nspeech, but could be a basis for discharge if made face to\nface?\nMS. LEE: It could be in this case, where the\nprosecutor, who is assigned, or authorized, to speak on\nbehalf of the DA's office in a pending criminal action,\nmade comments to the press about the nature of the case,\nbut, rather -- and, in this particular scenario, goes too\nfar, goes beyond what the DA's office allowed him to speak\non.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: No, I'm --\nMS. LEE: He could --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- asking you if --\nMS. LEE: -- certainly be discharged for that.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- what he says privately\ncould the basis for a discharge. Surely, he couldn't be\ndischarged for what you just described.\nMS. LEE: The -- under our approach, the issue\nis not whether it's privately or publicly. If the job\nrequires him to speak in a -- within the internal\nchannels, then that speech -- he's doing his job, he's\ngetting paid for it, and he should not be entitled to\nfirst-amendment protection.\nUnless there are any other questions --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Is that --\nMS. LEE: -- I'd like to --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- is that true in this case?\nI realize they didn't get to it on summary judgment, but\nis that true in this case with respect to a Brady\ndisclosure?\nMS. LEE: Brady disclosures are the obligations\nof the district attorney's office. So, in this case, when\nthe deputy district attorney believed that it should be\ndisclosed, his supervisor had an absolute right to, say,\non behalf of the DA's office, challenge that decision to\ndisclose.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: What if -- what if the lawyer\nsimply believes that he has an ethical obligation to make\nthe disclosure, and he makes it, and he is then subject to\nretaliation? No first amendment claim on his part?\nMS. LEE: Those ethical obligations would build\n-- would arise from his capacity as a prosecutor.\nProsecutors are employees. Governmental employees have a\ngeneral standard of ethical conduct. That doesn't mean\nthat they are getting paid for the same assigned job\nduties.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, does that mean -- what's\nyour answer to my question? If he makes the Brady\ndisclosure because he believes that is an ethical\nobligation, and he is then subject to retaliation, does he\nhave a first amendment claim, or not?\nMS. LEE: It's our view that he does not.\nI'd like to reserve the remainder of --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you --\nMS. LEE: -- my time for rebuttal.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- Ms. Lee.\nMr. Himmelfarb.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF DAN HIMMELFARB\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,\nAS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING PETITIONERS\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: What's your answer to that\nlast question, Mr. Himmelfarb?\nMR. HIMMELFARB: A Brady obligation is an\nobligation of a prosecutor in his capacity as a\nprosecutor; and a Brady disclosure, like a recommendation\nto a superior that there should be a Brady disclosure,\nconstitutes the exercise of the prosecutorial function by\na prosecutor. It is employee speech, and that speech, if\nit engenders an employment action, should not be\nsufficient for the employee to get past the first step of\nthe Pickering balancing. If there is --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: So, no free-speech protection\nunder Pickering.\nMR. HIMMELFARB: That's exactly right, Justice\nO'Connor.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: And how about this case?\nCould it not be resolved under a proper handling of\nPickering?\nMR. HIMMELFARB: Well, we think a proper\nhandling of Pickering is that respondents should not get\npast step one of the balancing, because the speech is\nexpressed in his capacity as an employee.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Now, what about retaliation\nclaims that the employee may have? What about\nwhistleblower-type claims by an employer? Are they -- are\nthey separate from the first-amendment concerns?\nMR. HIMMELFARB: We don't think they are,\nJustice O'Connor, if the whistle-blowing is required by\nthe employee's speech. If an investigator in an inspector\ngeneral's office, whose job it is to investigate and\nreport government misconduct, reports misconduct, and an\naction is taken as a result -- an employment action is\ntaken against them as a result -- he is demoted or\ntransferred, because it's the view of his superior that he\ndidn't perform his job properly in speaking on that issue\n-- that should not enable the investigator to get past the\nfirst step.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What if the reason -- what if\nthe reason for the -- for firing him is that he's a\nDemocrat and it's a Republican Administration, and the\nspeech is used as the pretext?\nMR. HIMMELFARB: Justice Scalia, I think that\ncase would be covered by this Court's patronage cases,\nwhich would absolutely prohibit that sort of employment\naction. But in a case where it's not party affiliation\nthat motivates the employment action, if the speech is\nexpressed in carrying out the employee's duties, he may\nhave a civil-service remedy -- indeed, that's precisely\nwhat the civil-service laws were designed to deal with, a\nsituation where the employee is just doing his job, an\naction is taken again him, and there's a dispute as to\nwhether he was doing his job properly, about whether he\nwas insubordinate, or simply about whether he was --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Suppose that we have an\ninstance where it is job related. He is not speaking as a\nprivate citizen, and it's also a public concern. Now, in\nsuch an instance, could we say that, at least if the\nmatter of public concern rise to the level where it's\nrelated to an independent constitutional protection --\nsay, founded in the due-process clause -- under those\ncircumstances, the employer cannot unreasonably -- though\nwe give him an area of discretion, he cannot unreasonably\nretaliate.\nMR. HIMMELFARB: I don't think so, Justice --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Why not?\nMR. HIMMELFARB: -- Breyer.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Why not? And here is an\nindependent obligation.\nMR. HIMMELFARB: To --\nJUSTICE BREYER: It's very unusual --\nMR. HIMMELFARB: To --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- but it's there.\nMR. HIMMELFARB: To use the example of this\ncase, if respondent advised his supervisor that, in his\nprofessional judgment, a Brady disclosure should be made,\nand if the supervisor disagreed with him, and if\nreasonable minds could differ as to whether the disclosure\nshould be made, and he made it, nonetheless, he would be\ninsubordinate. And we don't think that that is the --\nJUSTICE BREYER: You'd only lose -- the\nGovernment would lose, only where you can conclude that\nthey could -- \"they,\" the Government -- could not -- could\nnot reasonably conclude that he'd been insubordinate.\nMR. HIMMELFARB: Justice Breyer --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So, we covered the case of the\nDemocrat, Republican, et cetera. In other words, we'd\ngive him -- should we give him total discretion? Can't we\nlimit that discretion of the supervisor?\nMR. HIMMELFARB: If it's -- if it's a situation\nwhere reasonable minds cannot differ, and the superior\ndirects him not to make the disclosure, in clear\ncontravention of the due-process clause as interpreted in\nBrady, that is a situation --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But, Mr. Himmelfarb, in that\ncase he could also be fired if he made the statement in a\nspeech, could he not?\nMR. HIMMELFARB: If he made the statement in a\npublic speech --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Right.\nMR. HIMMELFARB: -- or in a letter to the editor\nof a newspaper, we think that speech would be\npresumptively protected by the first amendment.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But could he not be fired if\nthe scenario you just described as --\nMR. HIMMELFARB: Maybe he could, Justice\nStevens, but that would be subject to balancing, and it\nwould be the employer's duty to justify the firing, based\non workplace disruption.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: It seems to me odd that the\nemployee has greater protection if he goes outside the\nregular channels and makes a speech than if he does -- he\ngoes right to his superior and says, \"I think this is\nwhat's wrong and should be remedied.\"\nMR. HIMMELFARB: Well, it's not that odd,\nJustice Stevens, because if you have an obligation to\nreport misconduct -- take, again, the example of the\ninvestigator in the inspector general's office -- you will\nordinarily be better off by reporting it through the\nordinary channels.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Right.\nMR. HIMMELFARB: Because, ordinarily, you have\n--\nJUSTICE STEVENS: You may have no constitutional\nprotection. But if you go ahead and make a speech, you\ndo.\nMR. HIMMELFARB: Well, you have presumptive\nfirst-amendment protection. If you work in the inspector\ngeneral's office, and there is a prohibition on disclosing\npending investigations, and you hold a press conference,\nthere is a very good chance you're going to lose at step\ntwo of Pickering, which is why it's in your interest to\ndisclose it through appropriate channels, because --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And it's going to be\nclear that that's violating your job, and it has an\nadverse impact on your job-related duties, because you're\ngoing public, instead of going through the channels.\nMR. HIMMELFARB: Well, that's right. If you\nhave an -- if it's a part of your job, you have an\nincentive to do it, just like any other job requirement.\nAnd it's ordinarily not the case that public employees are\npunished for doing their jobs. They're more often\npunished for not doing their jobs. So, in that situation,\nthe employee is going to likely be better off by making\nthe disclosure through appropriate channels.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But he has less constitutional\nprotection.\nMR. HIMMELFARB: That's true, Justice Stevens,\nbut civil -- it's our view that civil service laws are the\nmechanism for dealing with a situation where you're doing\nyour job and there's a dispute as to whether you're doing\nit properly or not.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How comfortable are you\nthat this line you're trying to draw is one that's going\nto be workable in practice? I mean, suppose the employee\nwrites a memo, and the boss comes and says, \"If you don't\npromise me you're not going to talk about this publicly,\nyou're fired.\" And he says, \"Well, I'm not going to\npromise that.\" And so, he's fired. Now, is that\ninternal, or is that external?\nMR. HIMMELFARB: If the -- if the memo is\nrequired by his job, it's --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right.\nMR. HIMMELFARB: -- a recommendation about what\npolicy the agency --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's --\nMR. HIMMELFARB: -- should take --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- required by his job.\nBut \"promise that he's not going to talk about it\" is not\nrequired by his job. And this case, kind of, raises the\nquestion, because the only reason it's squarely presented\non the memo is because the Court didn't reach the Brady\ndisclosure or the talk to the bar association that were\nrelated to the memo.\nMR. HIMMELFARB: That's right. In answer to\nyour question of how difficult it's going to be to draw\nthe line, I think in most cases it won't be difficult to\ndraw the line. I don't think it was difficult in this\ncase. I'm not aware of any cases that applied principle\nwe advocate where it has been. There may be some cases\nwhere it will be difficult to draw the line, but --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I suppose you have the rule\nwhich distinguishes between employment-related and outside\nspeech, under the hypothetical -- difficult hypothetical\nposed by the Chief Justice, it would be an -- the promise\nwould be an unconstitutional condition, or something like\nthat.\nMR. HIMMELFARB: That may --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I --\nMR. HIMMELFARB: -- that may -- that may be,\nJustice Kennedy.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I suppose it's a hard case --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And I suppose that what\nconstitutes a matter of public interest is not the\nclearest line in the world either, is it?\nMR. HIMMELFARB: That's absolutely right,\nJustice Scalia. This Court has already decided that it's\nimportant to draw a line at step one in distinguishing\nbetween speech on a matter of public concern and speech on\na matter of private concern, even though it will often be\nhard to draw that line. And the reason that line has to\nbe drawn is that the alternative is, in effect, to\nconstitutionalize the law of public employment.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Do you -- let me ask you this\n-- do you propose drawing the line -- or at least drawing\na line in some circumstances this way: That, at step one,\nif it can be concluded that a private communication\nbetween the employer and the employee would have\nconstituted the discharge of the employee's assigned work\n-- so that it would have been within the scope of his\nemployment, and, therefore, not subject to Pickering\nbalancing, if he had made the statement to the employer --\nthat, therefore, the statement cannot be regarded as a\nstatement of public interest, even if he had disclosed it\npublicly, or if he took a further step and went to the bar\nassociation and whatnot?\nMR. HIMMELFARB: Justice Souter, we see these as\ntwo separate requirements to get past step one. The\nspeech has to be on a matter of public concern, but it\nalso has to be speech in the speaker's capacity as a\ncitizen.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But if it is within -- I'm\nsorry, but if it -- if it is within the speaker's assigned\nduties as an employee, does that preclude a conclusion,\nlater on, that he was speaking as a citizen, even if he\ngoes public with it?\nMR. HIMMELFARB: I don't think it does, Justice\nSouter. If --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So, we do have, then, the\nproblem that Justice Stevens has raised.\nMR. HIMMELFARB: That's right. I don't -- I\ndon't see it as much of a problem, for the reasons I tried\nto give in responding to Justice Stevens.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What about the hearing at\nwhich this office had testified? I thought that part of\nthe complaint was, \"When I spoke at the hearing, I was\nspeaking in a public forum, and they fired me for it.\"\nMR. HIMMELFARB: May I answer the question?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes.\nMR. HIMMELFARB: My understanding is that that's\nnot part of the complaint, Justice Ginsburg. And my\nunderstanding also is that, in the district court,\nrespondent took the position that his testimony at the\nhearing was in his capacity as an employee.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.\nHimmelfarb.\nMs. Robin-Vergeer.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF BONNIE L. ROBIN-VERGEER\nON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may\nit please the Court:\nEver since Pickering, it has been the law that\nthe first amendment protects public employees from being\nfired or punished for expressing views on matters of\npublic importance where, as here, there is no harm or\ndisruption to their employers. Petitioners in -- the\nUnited States asked this Court to scrap that. It is not\njust the Ninth Circuit.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I'm not sure that that\nwas clear from the decisions of this Court. Certainly,\nthat wasn't what was involved in Pickering. That was\noutside speech.\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: That's correct. But it's\nbeen the --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And the same -- and the same\nwith Connick. So, I'm -- if you're saying that this is\nwhat the circuits have understood, fine, but that's not\nthis -- that's why we took this case.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And I think all the cases did\nsay \"expressing views as a citizen on a matter of public\nconcern.\" Wasn't that qualifier always used?\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: The qualifier has always\nbeen used in conjunction with the phase \"on matters of\npublic concern.\"\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So, what does it mean? What is\n-- what is your explanation for that qualifier,\n\"expressing views as a citizen\"? Why do we --\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: It --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- continually say that?\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: -- it was used descriptively\nto explain, and especially to look at the context in which\nthe phrase first appears, in Pickering, that public\nemployees, like all citizens, have an interest --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, let's assume that --\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: -- on matters --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- I think that that's an open\nquestion under Pickering, and that this case presents it.\nDo you -- do you concede -- and maybe you don't -- that\nthere is any category of first amendment speech, as a\nmatter of public concern, which an employee cannot direct\nto the employer? Are there -- are there some matters as\nto which the employer can protect its own interests and\nstifle the employee's speech?\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: Speaking on a matter of\npublic concern only gets the employee presumptive first-\namendment protection.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So, there's always Pickering\nbalance.\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: There would be a Pickering\nbalance, yes. And the Pickering balancing test is quite\ndeferential to the employer. The Court observed, in the\nPickering case, that it's proper to look -- that a court\nshould look at the proper performance of the employee's\ndaily duties. In Rankin, the Court talked about the\nquestions whether the speech interferes with work,\npersonnel relationships, or the speaker's job performance.\nThe bar is already quite high for the employee,\ncoupled with causation burdens, qualified immunity, and so\non. And so, it is not the case that just because a -- an\nemployee speaks on a matter of public concern, that that\nemployee is necessarily going to win a first-amendment\ncase. Also --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Ms. Lee -- Ms. Lee told us\nthat the Ninth Circuit weighed the capacity of the\nplaintiff as an employee, rather than a member of the\npublic, in favor of the employee and against the employer.\nIs that how you read the Ninth Circuit's decision?\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: No, I think -- it's not\nquite right. I think the Ninth Circuit just looked at\nwhether his speech which was reporting Government misconduct,\na type of speech that the circuit said uniformly recognized\nwas of paramount public importance.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But --\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: And --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- any comment that an\nemployee makes regarding how the office is working is a\nmatter of public concern. I would concede that. I mean\n--\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: With --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- that has to be.\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: -- with respect, I don't --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And the consequence of your\nview is to have the first amendment being used for courts\nto monitor the discussions that take place in every public\nagency -- local, State, and Federal -- in the United\nStates. It's -- you are advocating a sweeping rule. Now,\nyou'll say, \"Oh, well, Pickering balance will protect it.\"\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: With --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But I still think the\nintrusive consequences of your -- of your rule are\nsweeping.\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: With respect, the public-\nconcern threshold is not so easily met. the Court has\nsaid --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I guess our law clerks would\nmeet it every day.\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: Maybe. Maybe not.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yeah, maybe, maybe not. I\ndon't --\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: But the Court has --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- anything that goes on in my\nchamber that isn't a matter of public concern, and I would\nthink everything at OSHA and everything at -- look, I'll\n-- let me put my question to you, because you're going to\nmake an argument that I don't think is too widely shared;\nnamely, that Pickering decides this case. If that's your\nargument, I'd like to ask you a question based on the\nassumption Pickering does not decide this case. And it\nseems to me that Pickering involves a case in which it's\nboth a matter of public concern and outside the scope of\nemployment.\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And here we have a case that is\na matter of public concern, but inside.\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: Right. I --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So, in those circumstances, I\nwant to know how you believe the first amendment requires\nus to decide this case. And as I read this case, in the\nrecord, we have one individual, your client, who looked at\nan affidavit. The affidavit said that the deputy sheriffs\nwere trying to locate where a vehicle that was chocked up\ncame from. They saw tire tracks. The tire tracks went\nback to a fence at the end of a long driveway.\nSo, I looked in the record. I couldn't find the\naffidavit. So, I assume that's what it says. And I\nwanted to know what the deputy sheriff said. What they\nsaid is that your client agreed that there were tire\ntracks. There were tire tracks that did not go the whole\nlength of the driveway, but, rather, tire tracks near the\nhouse, where they got the search warrant for. And, they\nadded, that -- the deputies -- that there was rocks broken\nup.\nAll right. So, we have two sides to this\nargument: the deputies, who might reasonably contend that\nthey did nothing wrong; your client, who thinks they were\nlying. And we also have a letter that your client wrote,\nwhere he said that these deputies are grossly inaccurate\nand clearly misleading.\nSuppose his supervisor goes to him and says, \"I\nthink that that letter is not the right tone. Maybe\nyou're right, maybe you're wrong; maybe they're in good\nfaith, maybe they're not. And so, if you don't change\nthat tone, I'm going to discipline you.\" All right?\nNow, that's my hypothetical, which seemed to me,\nperhaps, very much like this case. How, in your opinion,\ndoes the first amendment handle such a matter?\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: If the supervisor told Mr.\nCeballos that there was something wrong in the manner in\nwhich he conveyed his speech, and told him to revise the\nmemo, that would have been -- he would have been well\nwithin his rights to do so. Bear in mind that there's\nnever been an argument here that there was anything\ninappropriate about Mr. Ceballos's speech, that he\nexercised poor judgment, that there was anything\ndisruptive about the manner in which he communicated. The\nhead of the office --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But I don't under- --\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: -- actually said --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- I understand the ultimate\nanswer you gave the hypothetical. I don't understand the\nprinciple you're following. I mean, it's a matter of --\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: It's --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- you would agree this is a\nmatter of public concern.\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Which is what I'm looking --\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- for. I'm looking for --\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: It is --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- a standard.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But we don't have a standard.\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: The principle is that an\nemployer -- we agree with the position of the United\nStates, that the employer has the ability to dictate how\nan employee carries out his duties. In a case where the\nemployee --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But in Justice --\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: -- is insubordinate --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- in Justice Breyer's\nhypothetical, if the employee filed a lawsuit claiming a\nviolation of his first-amendment rights, you would say\nthat could not be thrown out, on summary judgment, on the\nground that the speech was within the scope of his\nemployment.\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: It would be not on that\nground.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No.\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: The reason it would be\nthrown out in summary judgment would be because the\nemployer had a different reason for taking retaliatory\naction --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, no there is --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that would --\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: -- against the employee.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- be a dispute of fact,\nso it probably wouldn't -- so it wouldn't be thrown at\nsummary judgment at all.\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: Virtually all of these cases\nare able to be disposed of at summary judgment. And you\nhave, basically, 20 years of litigation in the circuit\ncourts to look at where --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Look --\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: -- the problems that are\nbeing posited haven't materialized.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I'm not making my question too\nclear. I imagine the district judge. I get just the\nfacts I described to you. Your client, who's very upset,\nsays, \"This is the most unreasonable thing that ever\nhappened. They were trying to prevent me from\ncommunicating with the judge. I'm the one who saw the\nsheriffs. They didn't.\" The other side says, \"We think\nit's reasonable what we did.\"\nMy question to you is, What standard does that\njudge apply under the first amendment? What does he do?\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: The judge looks first at\nwhether the speech is on a matter of public concern. And\nif it's a dispute over Government misconduct, it would\nmeet that threshold. Second, the Court would proceed to a\nPickering balance and would say the employer's actual\nreason for retaliating or taking action would be because\nof the -- you know, the tone or the message or because it\nwas a disagreement, and the supervisor's views ultimately\nprevail. And so, that's how it would be --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So, the Federal --\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: -- analyzed.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- Federal courts supervise\nthe constant dialogue that is the everyday routine\npractice in every governmental agency, local and Federal,\nin the United States.\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: With respect, no. These\ncases are not that hard to dispose of at summary judgment.\nMost actions that employers take against the employees\nare not because of the employees' speech anyway, it's\nbecause of how they carry out their job functions.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But that would be something\nthat would have to go to trial, to prove that the -- that\nthe employee was incompetent.\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: Respectfully, I don't -- I\ndon't think that most of these cases -- they don't go to\ntrial, most of them. They're -- of course, there are some\ntrials, but that is not the way most of these cases are\nhandled. And, besides that, adding an extra test, another\npreliminary hurdle, wouldn't change the litigation burden.\nInstead of it being the Connick-Pickering test, it would\nbe Connick-Pickering-Ceballos test. And then the question\nwould be, Was the person doing their job? How do you\ndecide that? Is it in his job description? Is it a\nmatter of custom and practice? What if he's doing extra-\ncredit work to build up goodwill with his employer, but\nit's something that's not --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, in --\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: -- ordinarily required?\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- in this case, the\nsupervisor said, \"There can't be -- can't be tracks on\nasphalt, so you're probably right.\" Then he finds out\nthat it's a tire rim, and of course the rim makes a -- so\nwe have to find out this at discovery -- at the discovery\nstage of a lawsuit?\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: As long as he's made an --\nas long as he's made allegations or spoken in good faith\nin their -- and it isn't demonstrably false, then he would\nclear that initial hurdle. And there certainly was\nnothing suggesting that he spoke in bad faith or was\nobviously false, whether or not he was correct in his\nassessment.\nAnd it wasn't just an argument over a tire rim.\nHe accused these -- the deputy sheriff here of perjury.\nIt was a quite serious allegation of Government misconduct\nthat was made here, and not, sort of, a mundane dispute\nover --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why doesn't --\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: -- whether or not --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- why doesn't Rust\nanswer this question? I mean, there, it was really --\nthis issue was just outsourced by the Government. They\npaid for the speech there, and we said that if you pay the\npiper, you get to call the tune. And this is just an\ninsourced -- the same question.\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: Ceballos was not speaking on\nbehalf of the Government when he went to his supervisor.\nThat was an internal communication to his supervisor\nreporting --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: He was writing a memo\nabout why the case should be dismissed. Wasn't --\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: Right.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- that part of his job?\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: It was part of his job,\nalthough I -- I'd quibble with the idea that it was\nrequired by his job. But it was part of his job. And, in\ndoing so, he spoke to the Government, not as the\nGovernment.\nA better analogy with respect to Rust would be\nif the doctor in Rust -- let's say it's a doctor at a\npublic university hospital, and the doctor was told that\nthe policy is not to engage in abortion counseling. And\nhe wrote a memo to the supervisor saying, \"This is a\nterribly policy. This is inhibiting our ability to\ncounsel my patients and for me to do my job correctly.\"\nThat memo would not be the Government's message. And\nCeballos's memo here to his supervisor was also not the\nGovernment's message.\nBut I want to -- I want to get --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, why is that? In\nthe -- in your hypothetical, the doctor is -- it's not his\njob to challenge the restriction on the Government grant,\nbut that's what he's doing, so that's not part of his job.\nHere, it's part of Ceballos's job to explain why the case\nshould be dismissed, and that's what he wrote in his memo.\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: But this is a very malleable\nand manipulable concept, what's part of a job. I mean,\nfor a doctor to talk to his supervisor about a restriction\nthat he feels is inhibiting his ability to counsel his\npatients is as much part of his job as a prosecutor going\nto his supervisor and saying, \"There's government\nmisconduct in this case, and we need to do something about\nit.\" Just like a teacher in the Givhan case, going to her\nprincipal, a conference between a teacher and her\nprincipal about whether there's racial -- racially\ndiscriminatory practices in the school would be part of a\nteacher's job, complaining about something that affects\nher students.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What do you do with your\nfriend's response to that, that in Connick the Court\ncharacterized Givhan as involving a case of a citizen\ncomplaining about a particular practice?\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: Well, I think that\nunderscores the point, that the employee in Givhan was\nspeaking both as an employee and as a citizen, and these\nroles are not mutually exclusive. You can be both.\nThere's no artificial distinction that the Court has drawn\nhere. And where a Government employee comes forward and\nreports misconduct and puts himself at risk, he is doing\njust that, speaking in both capacities. And --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: We just shouldn't have said \"as\na citizen\" in all of these cases. We were just padding\nour opinion with unnecessary words.\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: the Court -- the Court\nalways views the \"as a citizen\" language in conjunction\nwith the -- speaking on a matter of public concern. And\nit seems to me that the Court equated the two concepts.\nBut I want to get to why it is unwise and\nunjustified to draw the per se rule that petitioners are\nurging here. For one, it essentially means that a public\nemployee such as Ceballos has to go public in order to\nhave presumptive first-amendment protection.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But then he would be\nviolating the internal rules of the workplace.\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: Correct.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Where as giving his candid\nviews -- the search warrant -- he's giving his own\nopinion. But if he goes outside, he is violating a rule\nof the workplace. And it would seem to me that there are\ncertainly measures could be taken against him for that.\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: Correct. It's a trap. They\ndon't tell you about what happened in the second case. If\nCeballos had taken suspicions of police misconduct and\ngone to the Los Angeles Times, they would have fired him.\nAnd had he brought a case challenging that termination\nunder the first amendment, he would have lost on under the\nPickering balance. The circuit --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you think he should\nhave lost under the Pickering balance, in that case, if he\nwent public right away?\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: Yes. If he had evaded\nproper internal channels of communication, then the\nemployer would be well within his rights to fire him for\ntaking an action that's so disruptive in bringing --\ndiscrediting the office without even letting his own\nemployer try to address the situation internally first.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: What if he does let the\nemployer try first, and the employer does nothing, then he\ngoes public? Where does the Pickering balance come out\nthen?\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: Closer question. I think he\nprobably still loses, but it's a closer question. I\nthink, at some point, if the magnitude of this -- of the\nproblem is so large -- I mean, imagine in the Ramparts\nscandal situation if -- which has been discussed in the\nbriefs -- if a prosecutor tried to deal with that within\nthe DA's office, and failed to get any response, and then\nwent public with the Ramparts scandal, something of such\nmagnitude, a court perhaps would find their way. But in\nthe --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: What --\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: -- individual --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- what you're saying is, is\nthat the first amendment has an office and a function\nwithin the confines of a Government agency that it doesn't\nhave outside. That's a curious calculus. It seems to me\nthat the first amendment has its most application when you\ntalk to newspapers, when you talk outside. That's what\nthe first amendment's about. The first amendment isn't\nabout policing the workplace.\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: the Court held, in both\nGivhan and Rankin, that private communications on matters\nof public concern are still protected. And it's -- and\nthere's very good reasons for that to be. I mean, imagine\nan employee at FEMA who thinks that FEMA is not ready to\nhandle the next hurricane, that it has problems in its\ndisaster preparedness, and so that FEMA employee goes to\nhis supervisor and says, \"We have problems here. Here are\nthe four areas in which we're not ready to handle the next\nhurricane.\" He gets fired, because the supervisor doesn't\nwant to hear that. It's critically important that public\nemployees who have information, who know what ails the\nagencies that they work for, be able to find an avenue to\ncommunicate issues of public importance. If that FEMA\nemployee had gone --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Is any -- is any duty of an\nemployee in a -- an agency devoted to service of the\npublic -- is any of his functions not a matter of public\nconcern?\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: Yes. The standard isn't\nanything of public interest, it's something of legitimate\nnews interest. the Court reiterated that recently in the\nRoe case. The standard does -- it's not a --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's news. This is a press --\na press kind of a test.\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: Newsworthy. And it's the\nsame test --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Newsworthy.\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: -- the Court has applied in\ninvasion-of-privacy contexts. It's -- although it's a\nbroad standard, but it's also a well-known and well-\nestablished standard that --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought that's --\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: -- courts are using --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- what Connick was about,\nthat there are things that are said in the workplace that\nare of no public interest. They're personal gripes.\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: Correct. The line the Court\nwas drawing in Connick was between the personal and the\npublic. the Court said that, had the prosecutor in that\ncase come forward had -- to bring to light actual\npotential wrongdoing, a breach of public trust, the Court\nsuggested strongly that that would have been a matter of\npublic concern, and that the Court would then --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So --\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: -- have proceeded to the\nPickering balance.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- so if an employee -- I\nreally don't understand it -- an employee comes forward\nwith some scurrilous information about a family member of\nhis boss, who is a public figure, and his whole families\nare public figures, which would be picked up by the press,\nthat would be a matter of public concern?\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: If he's talking --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Gee, I never understood that\nthat's what the test was. I thought this was a matter\nthat deals with the welfare of the public, rather than --\nrather than the welfare of the press.\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: Two things. One is that if\nthe public employee is basically reporting something\ncorrupt in the --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that I understand.\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: -- in the workplace.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's the welfare of the\npublic.\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: Correct. And --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No, he's --\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: -- in Government --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- he's just saying, you know,\nhis boss's wife, a mayor of a big city, is running around\nwith somebody. Okay? And that's picked up by the press.\nIt's there on the gossip pages. She's a public figure.\nYou say that would be covered by this.\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: The test the Court\nenunciated in Connick is public, social, or -- excuse me\n-- political, social, or other concerns is up to the\ncommunity. If it's something that would be of legitimate\nnews and --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Anything that would get in the\npress. That's it.\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: Then potentially --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Wow.\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: But it has to be legitimate\nnews interest. And the Court -- the Courts have not\nusually taken idle gossip to meet that test.\nJUSTICE BREYER: We live in a world where people\nare leaking things all the time. And there are thousands\nof things that are in the public interest every day. But\nwhat's bothering me is, while I see the Government's rule\nas protecting the interests of the employer, it's very\nhard for me to believe that never is there an instance\nwhere the first amendment offers protection. But the only\nchoice you've given me is a rule that says every dispute\nof the public interest is going to go right into\nconstitutional litigation. And I don't like that either.\nSo, am I hopelessly --\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: No.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- forced to choose which is\nthe lesser of the evils, or is there some middle approach\nthat gives discretion to the Government, but doesn't allow\nthem to exceed that discretion in a certain category of\ncases? If so, what? And --\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: Certainly --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- how would you phrase it?\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: -- at a minimum, a report of\nGovernment misconduct by an employee to his supervisor, at\na minimum, should be treated as meeting whatever threshold\nthe Court establishes. And there's something that all the\nall circuits that have addressed this point agree, that\nwhistleblower-types of speech is of paramount public --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So, we do this --\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: -- concern.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- so we do this as a -- so we\ndo this as a matter of what is sound management principles\nfor a Government agency? How does that relate to the\nfirst amendment?\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: Because Government\nmisconduct goes to the very heart of Government\naccountability and the public's ability to hold officials\naccountable when there is --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But Government\nmisconduct -- if I get a memo from a law clerk that says,\n\"Justice So-and-So's jurisprudence is wacky,\" that goes to\n--\n[Laughter.]\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- that goes to\nGovernment misconduct, under your theory, right? And I\nfire them, because I think that's not appropriate to put\nin a memo.\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: But if --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: They have a first-\namendment claim, right?\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: Well, they have a first-\namendment interest in their speech, but they have no\nclaim, because if the -- if you fired them just because --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Nobody's wacko here. I mean,\nit's plainly --\n[Laughter.]\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- plainly false.\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: You know, it would depend\nwhy -- it would depend why you fired them.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, they disagree with\nit. They think it's -- whatever -- unprincipled, wrong.\nThey write me a memo, and I say, \"Don't write me a memo\nlike that.\" And they write me another one, and then I\nfire them.\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: All right. But if you're\nfiring them because you think they've exercised poor\njudgment in the -- in the way that they've communicated,\nthen it's --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And they think it's\nGovernment misconduct because of the way cases are\ndecided, and that they have a first amendment interest.\nWhat could be more important than how the Court decides\ncases? And that violates their first-amendment rights.\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: In the hypothetical you gave\nme, it doesn't -- I mean, it doesn't sound like a serious\nclaim of Government misconduct. It sounds like more like\nan offhand remark with -- which, if you thought it was\ninappropriate, you might be able to take action against\nthat employee. Here, we have a very grave allegation to\npublic -- of Government misconduct, not casually made. I\nmean, the -- Mr. Ceballos talked to --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But there was --\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: -- other people --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- a dispute about that\nin this case, too. I mean, it -- under the supervisor's\nview, it may come down to simply whether there were tire\ntracks or tire rim tracks. And that's not as serious, in\none view, as your client thinks it's serious.\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: My client carefully\nconsidered what the -- what the allegations were in the\ncase, and they talked to people in this office. So\nseriously did the supervisors take it that they actually\nreleased somebody who pleaded guilty, who was in custody\nfor seven months, and let them out on their own\nrecognizance, because that's how seriously -- what a\nproblem they thought, in his office, they had with this --\nthe affidavit. It was only after the meeting with the\nsheriff's department where they, kind of, launched into\nhim exactly like a public defender, did the tide turn.\nSo, we're not -- it's not a casual dispute over tire\ntracks, or not tire tracks, in this case.\nBut getting back to Justice Breyer's question\nabout drawing lines, I think that's just --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Your answer to Justice Breyer's\n-- I was just going to jump in there -- your answer to\nJustice Breyer's question is, look at -- if you want to be\nsure that, in every case, you know, the good cases fall on\nthis side, the bad cases fall on -- he should buy your\nposition that every case should go to a balancing test.\nThat will give you the perfection of first-amendment\napplication. The absolute perfection. Now, it'll cost a\nlot of money, and it'll, you know, interfere with a lot of\nemployment things, but it will give you first-amendment\nperfection. Right? I mean, that's the answer.\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: There's an -- with respect,\nI think there's --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Is that your answer?\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: I'm not sure I can answer\nthat.\n[Laughter.]\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: I'll take that as a\nrhetorical question.\nBut, to get back to Justice Breyer's question,\nthere's also -- I think this came up in -- when my\nopposing counsel was talking, that there's this extra element\npresent here, which is that there is an independent\nconstitutional problem here, in that when you have a --\npolice misconduct, you have someone whose right to fair\ntrial are at stake, and you have a prosecutor who's trying\nto fulfill his individual ethical and constitutional\nobligation --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, that --\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: -- on top of it.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: There would -- in this case,\nunlike any other case I've seen in the employment area,\nthere is a hearing in -- before a court of general\njurisdiction, who goes into this. That's what the\ncriminal trial is for. And he did. There was also a\ngrievance proceeding.\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: Had Ceballos remained\nsilent, however, then this speech would never have been\naired, and police misconduct --\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right --\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: -- would go unchecked.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- I've got -- you've got me\npart of the way. Now, I'm not saying I -- I have to think\nthis through, but you got part of the way. You say here,\nthere's an independent constitutional basis for the speech\nbeing permitted. But, now, still within that, the\nGovernment agency has to have some authority to discipline\na person, even there, because, after all, he might have\nbeen accusing these sheriffs of things that were really\nnot justified by what they, in fact, did. Or maybe he was\nright. What about that part of the standard? Do you want\nto say that the Government wins, as long as it behaved\nreasonably? Do you want to say that the Government loses\nonly if there was an abuse of ordinary employer\ndiscretion? Do you want to say the Government -- et\ncetera. What do you want to say?\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: If the Government takes\naction because the employee has exercised -- has done --\ncarried out his job in an inappropriate way that reflects\na lack of fitness or poor judgment and what have you, the\nemployer's within his rights to do so. The Court\nacknowledged that in Pickering, it acknowledged that in\nRankin. That has never really been an issue in the\nCourt's cases. And it's not --\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. Suppose --\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: -- our position --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- we were to write this,\nhypothetically. Indeed, the employer has broad discretion\nto discipline the employee for the manner -- or whatever\nhe does -- even in such an area, but that discretion can\nbe abused. And, therefore, it is up to the judge to\ndetermine whether a jury could find such abuse of\ndiscretion here.\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: Correct. I agree with that\nstandard.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But that does --\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: That --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- that does mean that\npotentially -- as the Government says, potentially every\ncase is at least going to get as far as summary judgment\nin court.\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: That's already the case.\nAlmost all these cases go to summary judgment. It's\nalmost impossible to dismiss one of these cases on the\npleadings. That's true even in the Fourth Circuit.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, you -- it wouldn't be\nthat way if the rule was that if it's employee speech on\nthe job, it's not protected at all.\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: Respectfully, that's not\ncorrect. Even in the fourth circuit --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: No, that's the argument\nthat's being made here by both the --\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: I understand that, but that\nargument is unfounded. Even in the fourth circuit, which\nhas come closest to adopting the per-se rule the\npetitioners are asking for, district courts -- and there's\na case we cited in our brief, Echtenkamp -- it's from the\neastern district of Virginia -- where the Court said, in\ntrying to decide, \"Did the employee speak as a citizen or\nas an employee?\" this is going to take factual\ndevelopment. We can't decide this on the pleadings. It's\ngoing to --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay, do --\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: -- have to go to summary\njudgment.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- do we know how many cases of\nthis sort there are?\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: I can only say based looking\nat published cases --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yeah.\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: -- on Westlaw.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yeah.\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: There seem to be around 60\nor 70 court-of-appeals cases --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Over what --\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: -- a year.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- period of time?\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: Each year, for the least\nfive years, about --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: In --\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: -- 60 or 70 court-of-appeals\ncases.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- in all of the circuits --\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: In all of the circuits.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- that follow a ninth-circuit\nkind of rule?\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: Yes, in all of the circuits.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's court of appeals. You\nreally don't know how many district-court judgments there\nmay have been that didn't go up to the court.\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: There's around a hundred a\nyear in the district courts that appear on Westlaw, each\nyear for the last five years.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: There's one aspect of this\ncase that no one has touched on. The concurring judge,\nJudge O'Scannlain, said, this is what whistleblower\nstatutes are supposed to handle, and that if we accepted\nyour view of the first-amendment coverage, the\nwhistleblower statutes would be superfluous.\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: That's incorrect. The\nwhistleblower statutes, which are sort of a patchwork\nnationwide, protect, or at least they have the ability to\nprotect, speech beyond what the first amendment does. If\nyou take the Federal whistleblower protection statute, for\nexample, if an employee makes a protected disclosure, and\nan employer takes a prohibited action in response, there's\nno balancing. The employee wins. The causation burden is\nalso lower. The agency's on the hook for paying the\nmoney. There's no immunity, and so on.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: California does have a\nwhistleblower statute. Is that right?\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: It does.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And there was a claim made\nunder it, but we're not told how it came out.\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: There wasn't a claim made\nunder it.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: There was not.\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: There was not a --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I -- I'm --\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: -- did not bring a claim\nunder California whistle-blowing --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: He did -- he --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I'm not sure you've answered\nJustice Ginsburg's question. Her question was, Don't\nwhistleblower statutes cover this? And your answer, if I\nunderstood it correctly, is, whistleblower statutes cover\nthis, and a lot more. That doesn't prove --\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: Oh, I'm sorry, I --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- that doesn't prove--\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: -- understood the question\n--\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- that they don't take care of\nthis problem.\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: No, I understood her\nquestion to be whether they're rendered superfluous.\nWhistleblower statutes are patchwork across the country.\nSome would cover this kind of speech, some would not.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Some would not cover it.\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: Not all whistleblower\nstatutes cover internal communications. Some do --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Some are quite narrow --\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: -- some don't\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- of what they cover.\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: I'm sorry?\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Some of the whistleblower\nstatutes are very specific and narrow --\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: Yes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- of what they cover.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Some of them --\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: Yes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- in fact, don't cover\ndisclosures that are job related. If it's the employee's\njob to blow the whistle on this type of thing, it's\nusually not covered by a whistleblower statute.\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: Well, no, that's not --\nthat's not correct. I mean, in -- many of the statutes do\ncover internal, and some don't. In some, you have to go\nto a legislature, or you have to go -- take it to a\ncertain outside organization or entity in order to cover\nit, and --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I guess I'm --\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: -- some internal --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- thinking of the\nFederal law, where the idea is, if it's part of your job,\nyou have the normal civil-service job protections if\nyou're being retaliated or discriminated against for doing\nyour job, so you don't get the extra protections of the\nwhistleblower law. The only people who get it are the\npeople who -- it is not part of their job.\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: The Federal circuit has\ninterpreted the Federal whistleblower statute to narrow\nthe protection, so if it's within your normal duties of\nemployment, then it would excluded.\nBut if I could -- if I can -- just for a moment,\nI want to return -- I've hinted -- I've hinted at this\nsomewhat, but I haven't -- oh, I see my time's up.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yeah. Thank you, Ms.\nRobin-Vergeer.\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Ms. Lee, you have one\nminute left.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CINDY S. LEE\nON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS\nMS. LEE: Under our approach, we believe that\nmany cases won't even be filed, because they won't be able\nto make a colorable claim that it is citizen speech. This\ncase, in its essence, is about whether a public employee\nhas a constitutional right to perform his assigned job\nduties in such a way that is to the dissatisfaction of the\nemployer. In Pickering and in Connick, this Court\ncontemplated first-amendment litigation in a public-\nemployment context in the relatively rare circumstances in\nwhich adverse employment action was taken as a result of\nan employee's extracurricular activities. Under the Ninth\nCircuit and the respondent's approach, the exception would\nbecome the rule.\nIt is our view that the Ninth Circuit has simply\ngone too far in giving a broad sweep for first-amendment\nprotection for any public employee speech, simply because\nit happens to be a matter of public concern. As Judge\nO'Scannlain stated in his special concurring opinion, \"The\ntime is right for this Court to steer the drifting first-\namendment jurisprudence back to its proper moorings.\"\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Ms. Lee.\n"
