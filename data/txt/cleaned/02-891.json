GOLDSTEIN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nThis is an ERISA pension case. The petitioner\nis a multiemployer pension plan. The respondent\nplaintiffs are two plan participants. Each accrued a\npension and took early retirement at age 39, and each\nclaimed a full pension in the form of a life annuity.\nAt issue in the case is a plan amendment. It\nauthorizes the suspension of retirees' benefit payments\nduring the time that they choose to go back to work as\nconstruction supervisors. Before the amendment,\nsuspension was triggered only by work as a construction\nlaborer.\nThe change gives rise to an important, albeit\nhighly technical, question about the relationship between\ntwo provisions of ERISA. The question is: may such an\namended employment suspension provision apply to\npreviously accrued benefits? The plan says the answer is\nyes; the participants say the answer is no.\nThe expert agencies charged by Congress with\nadministering ERISA have also spoken to the question.\nThey say that ERISA does authorize such an amendment, and\nthey reached that conclusion by construing the two ERISA\nprovisions in para materia.\nCountless pension plans around the Nation, in\nturn, have relied on the agencies' guidance in shaping\ntheir plan amendments for decades, and that is the\nprincipal reason that the case is so important.\nQUESTION: In the -- in the guidance that is\ngiven, does the -- has the IRS actually passed on\nparticular amendments?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: It has, not in formal guidance.\nThe process is that you can -\nQUESTION: How does it do it?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: There -- there are a couple of\nlayers of it. The first is that the IRS publishes\nguidance ahead of time. For about 2 decades, there has\nbeen something called the LRM, the List of Required\nModifications. It's quoted in -- it's quoted in the\nGovernment's brief in particular. And that said to plans,\nif you're going to adopt a plan or revise a plan, here's\nwhat you can do.\nQUESTION: Is this in the manual?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Then there's a second. The\nsecond step is that more recently they have published\nwhat's known as to IRM, the Internal Revenue Manual, and\nthat's guidance for IRS employees.\nAnd then there's a third level, and that is\nplans can submit their plan provisions and amendments to\nthe IRS for what are known as determination letters on\nwhich the IRS signs off. And so all three of those exist.\nQUESTION: Do we -- do we have any indication of\nhow many determination letters have been issued?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: We don't. I don't think that\nthe IRS was able to come up with a particular number, but\nthey did say that their consistent practice for decades\nhas been to approve this particular -\nQUESTION: Is there anything to document that,\nthat it's been for decades? I mean, the manual provisions\nand the rest of -- of what you're describing is not -- not\npublished. So where do we get the 2 decades from?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: We get that from, I guess, two\nsources. The first is that there is the document -- the\n-- the series of documents known as the LRM, the List of\nRequired Modifications, that has guided the plans for a\ncouple of decades, and it does not restrain plans in its\n-- it specifically addresses revisions to plans,\namendments, and it doesn't say that you can only apply it\na suspension provision to benefit payments that accrue in\nthe future. Beyond that, when it comes to, you know, what\nthe IRS does day in and day out, we just have their\nrepresentation.\nQUESTION: Well, do you -- does -- does the list\nspecifically say that the amendments can -- can relate -\ncan, in fact, relate to or in law relate to prior\naccrued -\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: No, it doesn't. There --\nQUESTION: So, it leaves that question open.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: It -- it -- literally in its\ntext it does, but as a practical matter it doesn't\nbecause, as I was saying to Justice Ginsburg, the LRM's\nhave addressed revisions to plans and to amendments, and\nthey haven't restrained in any way the ability to apply it\nto previous -\nQUESTION: But that's a pretty negative\ninference, isn't it?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: It's true, but the -- the way\nthese documents work, as I understand them, is that if\nthere's a restriction, something you can't do, they say it\nexpressly. When you -- remember, the default rule under\nERISA, of course, is that you are allowed to adopt a plan\namendment, and then the -- they -- they articulate\nparticular restrictions -\nQUESTION: So I -- I think it's pretty explicit\nwhen it says that the accrued benefit of a participant\nunder a plan may not be decreased by an amendment of the\nplan.\nAnd I don't -- the trouble I'm having is it just\nseems to me utterly unrealistic to say that his accrued\nbenefit has not been decreased when he used to be able to\nwork as a -- as a supervisor and continued to draw from\nthe plan. Now he cannot work as a supervisor. How can\nyou -- I mean, certainly if you placed a dollar value on\nhis right to receive money from the plan, you would -- you\nwould put a higher price on -- on the -- the individual\nwho has the right to work as a supervisor and still\ncontinue to draw money as opposed to the person who\ndoesn't have that right. I mean, the -- the language just\nseems to me utterly plain.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: The -- Justice Scalia, the\nreason that the IRS has reached the opposite conclusion\nfor decades is threefold, and I will focus on the text\nbecause that's where you focus. But just to lay them out,\nit's going to be the text, the purposes of the suspension\nprovision, which is section 203(a)(3)(B), and what will\nbest protect participants' expectations. You focus\nrightly on the text.\nThe -- the key is what is a benefit versus what\nis a suspension of benefit payments. As I said in the\nintroduction, the plan participants here earned a benefit\nand that is a life annuity in a service only pension. So\nthey were able to retire and they got a life annuity\nthat's available to them.\nQUESTION: It's the dollar amount that they're\nentitled to which is the benefit.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: It is --\nQUESTION: But that means you can say, well, you\nknow, they're still entitled to that dollar amount, but\nthey can only get it every other year.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: That would be prohibited.\nQUESTION: Would that limitation be okay?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: No, it wouldn't because it would\nviolate the vesting rules.\nLet me continue. There are two parts in ERISA,\nand this is set out in your Alessi opinion in 1981. You\nhave to accrue a benefit and then you vest in the benefit.\nThe accrual is when you've earned the benefit. They\nearned the benefit. They earned their pension. Then they\nhad to vest in it; that is, though they've earned it, they\nhave what Alessi calls a non-forfeitable right to claim\nit. And what a suspension provision does it says your\nbenefit still exists. Their benefit is a life annuity.\nIt exists. There is an available stream of payments.\nThere's a stream of payments that is available every\nsingle month. That's the accrual rule.\nThen you have to vest. You have to have a right\nto claim it, and that's what a suspension provision does.\nQUESTION: It's not you that vests. It's the\npension that vests, isn't it?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: It is your claim to it that\nvests, Mr. Chief Justice. If I could give you the\nlanguage -\nQUESTION: Well, I was just questioning your\nchoice of words.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: I apologize. What I had\nintended to say is that your claim to it vests. There is\na benefit out there, this life annuity. And the question\nis: do you have the right to claim it in any particular\nmonth? That's the structure of section 203 versus section\n204.\nAnd what a suspension provision does -- and let\nme just pause to say the court of appeals acknowledged,\nthe plaintiffs acknowledged, that when we suspend their\nbenefit payments, we are not decreasing their benefit.\nWhat we're doing is that they have sacrificed their claim\nto a particular benefit in any given month. That's why\nCongress used the different language, suspension of\nbenefit payments versus the actual decrease in the\nbenefit.\nQUESTION: Well, they concede that with respect\nto the -- the decreases that were a term of the plan when\nit accrued to them.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Well, they conceded -\nQUESTION: They don't concede anything more, do\nthey?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: No, but the concession is,\nnonetheless -\nQUESTION: Well, that's no concession.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Well, it is we think, Justice\nSouter. Here's why. What I think Justice Scalia was\nfocusing on -- and I may be mistaken -- is that, look,\nwhen you withhold that benefit payment, sort of give me a\nbreak. They're not getting the money. You're decreasing\ntheir benefit. And in the terminology of ERISA, that is\nactually not correct.\nQUESTION: No. That wasn't my point at all. My\n-- my point, which I took a long time to make, was that\nthe value of your right to money, even though you work as\na supervisor, is greater than your right to money which\nterminates as soon as you begin to work as a supervisor.\nIt's a less valuable benefit.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Fair enough.\nQUESTION: And that comes right within the\nlanguage. The accrued benefit may not be decreased by an\namendment.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: And here is why it does not.\nThe real-world value, the sense that, look, this is more\ndesirable. I would rather have a benefit that has less\nsuspension provisions than one that has more. For\nexample, hey, it's more likely I'm going to get the money.\nThat is not a benefit within the meaning of ERISA. The\nbenefit is the life annuity. It's a -- this is -- the -\nERISA is, of course, as you've often said, a highly\nreticulated statute. There are 3,978 pages of regulations\nimplementing it in about 6-point font. The terms of art\nare highly, highly technical, and the benefit is the life\nannuity. It's not just the sense that I like it more.\nAnd I can give you an example.\nSection 203(c) of ERISA -- and, Mr. Chief\nJustice, that is reproduced in the yellow brief. I don't\nthink it will be necessary for the Court to track it, but\nit is at the bottom of 4a and 5a. This is a -- of the\nyellow brief. And this is a provision under which plans\nare authorized to change their vesting schedules. And so,\ntake an example.\nThere are two ways you can vest under ERISA.\nOne if over the course of 7 years in individual steps.\nAnother is so-called cliff vesting, and that is, you've\ngot your benefit. You've earned it, but until you've been\nin service for 5 years, you don't have any legal claim to\nit notwithstanding that it's out there. Plans under\nsection 203(c) are allowed to change their vesting rules\nso that if someone had earned 2 years of vesting credit,\nthe plan can, nonetheless, change to a 5-year cliff\nvesting provision. Now, that's all very complicated, but\nthe bottom line is that it makes it less valuable in the\nreal-world sense for the plan participants.\nQUESTION: Yes, but that -- that speaks to the\nfuture effect of such an amendment, and it -- when you're\ntalking about getting vesting, you can't have a\nretroactive -- you would not already be vested. Does that\nmean that if somebody vested after 2 years, they could\nthen adopt an amendment saying henceforth it's got to be 5\nyears and that applies to somebody who is already vested?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Unquestionably, yes.\nQUESTION: Does it really.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Absolutely, yes, without any -\nany doubt whatsoever.\nQUESTION: And what is the authority for that?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: That is section 203(c). Section\n203(c) explains that if you have less than 3 years of\nservice, you are not allowed to object to the change in\nvesting conditions. There are rules under ERISA that say\nthat even though you've vested, you can, in effect, be\ndivested. That's why it is a very strange structure of\nthe -\nQUESTION: Well, they -- they wouldn't need that\nprovision if the principle of law that you're urging upon\nus existed. I mean, the -- the whole reason, it seems to\nme, that they had to make that clear in a statutory\nprovision is that without it, you would obviously be\ndecreasing the value of the plan and violating the\nprovision of whatever it is, 1054(g)(1).\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: No. That's why this is in 1053.\nThere are two sets of restrictions. That provision that\nI've just been describing would not -- and I don't think\nthere's anybody who really contends it would -- violate\n1054, what we've been calling 204. It would violate 1053.\nYou have -\nQUESTION: Which -- which part of 1053?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: It would violate the beginning\nof 1053, Mr. Chief Justice. Let me take you to 1a of the\nyellow brief, and the paragraphs involved would be 1 --\nexcuse me -- 1053(a)(2)(A) and (B). Those are the\nplaces -\nQUESTION: Okay. Read them please.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes, Mr. Chief Justice. The\nbeginning of (2) says, except as provided in paragraph 4,\nwhich is not relevant, a plan satisfies the requirements\nof this paragraph if it satisfies the requirements of\nsubparagraphs (A) or (B). And subparagraphs (A) or (B)\nwhich I'll read, give you that 5-year cliff vesting option\nor instead over the course of 7 years. A plan satisfies\nthe requirements of this subparagraph if an employee who\nhas completed at least 5 years service has a non\nforfeitable right to 100 percent of the employee's accrued\nbenefit derived from employer contributions. And then (B)\nis the other option, the 7 years.\nNow, I have spoken and I've tried to emphasize\nthe difference between a benefit and the suspension of\nbenefit payments, but it is also important to deal with\nthe two other reasons that the Government -\nQUESTION: Let me just be sure I understand that\nargument again, Mr. Goldstein. This says you, in effect,\ncan retroactively require a longer vesting period. That\nwould mean require a longer period before you acquired an\naccrued benefit.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: No.\nQUESTION: That was 20 -- isn't that right?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: No, Justice Stevens. You would\nacquire the accrued benefit under 1054 as it accrued over\ntime. What you would not do is vest in that benefit, your\nright to the benefit is not present.\nQUESTION: So accrued -- the term, accrued\nbenefits, applies to benefits that have not yet vested.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: That's exactly right.\nQUESTION: I see.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes. Let me just step back.\nQUESTION: I'm not sure that -- I'm not sure I\nunderstand that, but anyway, go ahead.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: I apologize. Let me just step\nback and explain it then. There are two things that you\nhave to do in order to be able to collect your benefit\nunder ERISA. It has to accrue. You have to earn it under\n1054.\nQUESTION: Right.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: And you also have to vest in it\nunder 1053.\nJustice Scalia, you had intimated a\nhypothetical. Well, look, couldn't the plan just say,\nhey, we're suspending your benefit payments and wouldn't\nthat violate 1054 because you lessened the value of the\nbenefit. The answer to that question is no. You couldn't\ndo it, but -- because it would violate 1053. Someone\nwould have vested in the benefit and you would be\ndivesting them of it.\nLet me also take you -- because we do contend\nthat we are entitled to -\nQUESTION: Vesting means -\nQUESTION: You're going pretty fast for me.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Sorry.\nQUESTION: Could I just make sure I understand\none thing?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes.\nQUESTION: You're saying that a delay in the\nperiod between the time a benefit accrues and when it\nvests is not covered by 204(g), but a reduction of a\nbenefit that has already both accrued and vested is -- is\nnot covered by it or is -- you're saying they're the same.\nThat's what you're saying -\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Let me -\nQUESTION: -- for purposes of --\nQUESTION: Answer the question.\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: No is the -- is the short answer\nand here's the longer answer. You cannot decrease the\nbenefit even if it has not yet vested. Let's be perfectly\nclear. If I -- they have a life annuity and I were to say\ninstead of paying you $1,650 a month, I'm going to pay you\n$1,400 a month, notwithstanding that they haven't vested\nin it, it still violates the accrual rule.\nBut when you come to the question of the\nsuspension of benefit payments, which throughout ERISA is\na different concept than a decrease in benefits, when you\ncome to a suspension -- that is, your -- your claim to the\nbenefit payment each month -- I'm taking that away from\nyou -- that's covered by 1053. And our point is that this\nplan amendment is -- and the Government agrees -- is\nauthorized by 1053.\nI had said that I was also going to go beyond\nthe -- move from the text to the purposes underlying the\nstatute and the protection of participants' legitimate\nexpectations.\nBut before doing that, I do want to point to the\nregulation, Justice Scalia, that addresses our\nunderstanding of what it is to decrease, and we contend\nthat the regulation, which is published after notice and\ncomment, is entitled to Chevron deference. And it is --\nis reproduced on page 8a of the yellow brief, and I will\njust -- it's quoted in our brief as well. And it explains\nthat a decrease in a benefit is something that changes the\ncomputation of the benefit. This does not change the\ncomputation of the benefit. It's not just a rhetorical\ndevice. It is a theme that runs throughout the provisions\nof ERISA.\nBriefly, with respect to the purpose of the\nstatute and plan's expectations, the critical point is\nthat the suspension rule cannot work if it -- this is\nsection 203(a)(3)(B), the 1053 provision -- cannot work if\nit does not apply to already accrued benefits. The point\nof the statute is to get people to move in and out of the\nworkforce. And if you are not allowed to apply your\nsuspension provision to existing retirees, you cannot\ninfluence them in response to current financial\nconditions, the shape of the construction labor market,\nthe shape of the current trucking market. You have to be\nable to influence their decision whether or not to work or\nnot to work.\nQUESTION: Well, that -- that as set forth in -\nin your brief and -- and you made it sound like a very\nsignificant, very important power, but also you made it,\nto me, sound like it -- it gives almost no effect at all\nto the anti-cutback provisions.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: It does -\nQUESTION: I mean, this -- this is a sweeping\nauthority you're arguing for on behalf of the plaintiff.\nOh, the economy is this way and that way.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Well, I think the critical point\nis that Congress in section 1053, in 203, carefully\nlimited the power of the plans; that is, it's -- the right\nhere is to receive your pension. That right is completely\nin the control of the participants. They can choose not\nto go back to work or to go back to work. They will\nreceive their benefits.\nIn addition, the plan is only allowed to limit\nthe receipt of the benefit payment during periods of\nreemployment in the same industry, trade, or craft in the\nsame geographic region only if they work more than 40\nhours of -- a month, and a variety of other restrictions.\nAnd those showed that Congress was cabining the authority\nof plans so that they didn't unduly restrict the ability\nof plan participants to go back to work.\nBut it is, I think, absolutely critical, to\nreturn to the point, that 1053(a)(3)(B), the suspension\nrule, cannot function as Congress intended and that is\nwhat the IRS concluded if it does not apply to already\naccrued benefits. We could not encourage or discourage\nthe plan participants to go back to work or not to go back\nto work and thus calibrate the pension payments that are\ncoming into the plan if it did -- if our suspension\nprovision did not apply to their benefits.\nIf I could reserve the remainder of the time.\nQUESTION: Very well, Mr. Goldstein.\nMr. Elwood, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN P. ELWOOD\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES\nAS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER\nMR. ELWOOD: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nFor at least 20 years, the Internal Revenue\nService has consistently approved the amendment of pension\nplans to add or expand disqualifying employment provisions\nwithin the scope of ERISA's suspension rule, and it has\npermitted those amendments to be applied to existing\nbenefit accruals. Over the years, literally hundreds of\nplans have relied on the flexibility that policy afforded\nin determining whether a plan -\nQUESTION: Could you address one -- one question\nI have? The fact that the -- the plan doesn't -- or the\ncontributors don't lose their tax deduction does not\nnecessarily mean that those -- that they otherwise comply\nwith ERISA.\nMR. ELWOOD: That is -- I think that -- well,\nactually I think that because the -- the qualification\nprovisions are coextensive with the ERISA provisions, that\nI think that they rise or fall together.\nQUESTION: Have we ever said that?\nMR. ELWOOD: I think that the -- the -- thing is\nthe language of the -- the provisions is substantially\nidentical. The wording is -- is basically exactly the\nsame. And so I don't know that there has been a -- a case\non point that says they could be construed differently,\nbut I think there would be an uphill road.\nQUESTION: The Treasury Department, of course,\nis interpreting -- is interpreting the statute for the\npurpose of deciding whether -- the income tax consequences\nof contributions basically.\nMR. ELWOOD: That is correct, but they have been\nvested under reorganization plan number four with the\nauthority to construe the exact same provisions, the\ncorresponding provisions of title I of ERISA that we're\ntalking about here. And in -- when they issue those\nregulations, they typically say we're construing both. We\nuse the code verbiage, but we're construing both.\nQUESTION: The thing that runs through my mind\nis I'm not sure they have the same expertise, for example,\nas if the Department of Labor had to give them the same -\nsame answer to this question.\nMR. ELWOOD: They have been charged with\ninterpreting these provisions, the same provisions of\ntitle I of ERISA, the 204, 203 here as in the\ncorresponding provisions of the code. And it would be our\nposition that they're just as expert because they're\nexactly the same the language -\nQUESTION: But the concern at issue in this case\nis the ability of people to move in and out of the -- out\nof the trade, which is specifically a Labor Department\ninterest. The Labor Department would be more interested\nin ensuring that -- that interest is preserved than the\nTreasury Department would.\nMR. ELWOOD: In any event, the -- the Department\nof the Treasury has been charged with the responsibility\nand because it's identical language, we would argue that\nthey're entitled to just as much deference under that as\nunder title I of ERISA --\nQUESTION: And the -- the Labor Department has\nnot adopted a position on this question -\nMR. ELWOOD: The Labor Department agrees with\nthis position. The Labor Department, again under internal\nexecutive branch orders, is bound by the IRS\ndeterminations in this regard.\nNow, if I could get back to -\nQUESTION: Now, may I ask you about section 203?\nBecause the respondent says it governs only normal\nretirement benefits and not early retirement benefits that\nare at issue here.\nMR. ELWOOD: It governs normal retirement\nbenefits and their actuarial equivalents. So to the\nextent that early retirement benefits are the actuarial\nequivalent of normal retirement benefits, just reduced to\naccount for the fact they're received earlier and that\nthey'll be received over a longer period, it applies of\nits own force.\nBut again, the -- the Department of the Treasury\nhas taken the purposes of 203 into account when it\nconstrues all of the remaining provisions.\nJustice Souter -\nQUESTION: May I ask you to -- to comment on an\nargument that Mr. Goldstein just made? His -- his\nargument was that, at least certainly so far as the\nconstruction industry is concerned, unless this kind of\nretroactive effect could be given, there -- the -- the\nvarious plans could not protect themselves, or at least\nthey -- they could not take account of -- of labor market\nconditions. It would be useless to them.\nMy question is assume that is so. ERISA is made\nfor all sorts of plans. It isn't just made for the\nconstruction industry. Is there any reason to believe\nthat Congress was concerned with the construction\nindustry's labor market problems in -- in fixing the --\nthe statue in the way Mr. Goldstein and you say it has\nbeen arranged?\nMR. ELWOOD: I think there is reason to believe\nthat Congress was concerned with the cyclical nature of\nindustries for which market -- which are covered typically\nby multiemployer plans.\nQUESTION: How do we -- how do we know that? In\nother words, how do we know that this argument is not the\ntail wagging the dog?\nMR. ELWOOD: I think two things. First of all,\nCongress -- several Members of Congress, everyone who\nspoke to the subject during the debates leading up to the\npassage of ERISA, indicated that the idea here was to\npromote industrial stability and to give plans the\nflexibility, when market conditions warranted, to adopt\nsuspension provisions.\nQUESTION: Well, but you don't -- we don't have\nto adopt your provision to -- to accord that flexibility.\nAll that's needed is that the plan state, when it is\nestablished, that these provisions dealing with where you\ncan work are amendable. Once it says that, then there's\nno reduction in the value of -- of the benefits that the\nemployee receives. I mean, it's -- it's just very clear\nfrom the outset that these things are subject to\ndefeasance. All we're talking about is a plan that\ndoesn't contain that provision at the outset, and then\nlater decides it wants to change its mind.\nMR. ELWOOD: Actually, Justice Scalia, it I\nthink explicitly indicates that it contemplates that. If\nyou look at pages J.A. 46 and 64, there are places there\nsaying that basically if there are material changes in the\nsuspension provisions, that the plan will notify\nparticipants of them. And so between that and the fact\nthat the plan itself specifically states on page 50, J.A.\n50, that the plan is amendable -\nQUESTION: Yes, but that -\nQUESTION: Okay. You're referring to J.A. 50.\nGive us a minute, if you're -\nMR. ELWOOD: Oh, sure.\nQUESTION: -- if you're interested in our\ncomprehending what you're saying. Give us a minute to\nturn to that page, will you?\nWhere on page 50 is it?\nMR. ELWOOD: The -- page 50 is just the\nexplanation that the plan is amendable. Page 46 indicates\nthat -- that there can be change in the suspension rules.\nIt says if benefits have -\nQUESTION: Whereabouts are you reading?\nMR. ELWOOD: It's under (d)(1), page 46.\nQUESTION: Okay.\nMR. ELWOOD: (d)(1). That's the -- basically\nthe last sentence in the bottom three lines.\nI'll begin earlier than that. It says, if\nbenefits have been suspended and payment resumed, new\nnotification shall, upon resumption, be given to the\nparticipant if there has been any material change in\nsuspension rules, which we take to be an indication that\nthe plan contemplated that such amendments could be made.\nJustice Souter, if I could -\nQUESTION: It doesn't say anything about\namendments. It just says if you had a suspension, you got\n-- you got to give notice. I don't -- I don't see that.\nQUESTION: Presumably that -- that's a\nsuspension provided for in the plan but the plan -\nMR. ELWOOD: No. It says if there has been any\nmaterial change in the suspension rules, which we think to\napply to changes in when a suspension can be enacted, not\nthat a suspension will be given in a particular case.\nIn addition, I just -- Mr. Goldstein has already\nexplained a bit why we think the text of ERISA supports\nthis, but I think that its purposes -- the purposes of the\nanti-cutback rule are consistent with this because what\nCongress was trying to protect in the anti-cutback rule\nwas reduction of retirement income. And I think that that\nis broadly satisfied in this case because what this\nguarantee, as we've explained, is an annuity and a certain\nface amount that can never be reduced in face amount. And\nthe only time it is not paid to them is under very\nnarrowly cabined circumstances when they are, by\ndefinition, receiving essentially receiving replacement\nincome from the same industry, the same trade or craft in\nthe same geographic area that has funded their pension\nplan. And I think under those sort of narrow\ncircumstances, that the -- the purposes of the anti\ncutback rule are satisfied.\nIn addition, I would like to get back to a point\nthat Justice Souter raised.\nQUESTION: What -- what would happen if there\nwere a -- a suspension if you were working in any other\nindustry? Suppose the plan adopted that?\nMR. ELWOOD: I think that a plan could adopt a\nsuspension rule with respect to future plan accruals for\nany reemployment, but it is the Government's position that\nbecause what Congress is trying to control here was -- was\nbasically to give plans the flexibility so that their -\ntheir participants would not have to compete or, rather,\nhave to subsidize their competitors --\nQUESTION: But what is -- what is the provision\nof the statute which is -- which -- on which you rest to\nmake that distinction -\nMR. ELWOOD: That -\nQUESTION: -- as to whether it's very important\nfor the construction industry? Suppose some plan said\nit's for any industry.\nMR. ELWOOD: It's for section 203(a)(3)(B), or\n1053(a)(3)(B), which is set forth at the yellow brief on\npage -- I think it's 1a to 2a. And there it is just -- it\njust identifies the circumstances under which Congress has\nauthorized the suspension rule, which we read to be able\nto be applied to existing benefit accruals. And it limits\nit to application in the case of a multiemployer plan,\nwhich we've said tend to be industries of more cyclical\nswings, to cases where it's employment in the same\nindustry, in the same trade or craft, and in the same\ngeographic area covered by the plan.\nQUESTION: If this is so central to your case,\nhow come it only shows up in your -- in the reply brief?\nI mean -\nMR. ELWOOD: No. It's cited from the outset.\nIt's just -- it's only reproduced in the reply brief. But\nthe -- but the very same provision is very central to the\nargument set forth in both the petitioner's brief and the\nGovernment's.\nQUESTION: You -- you've been dying to respond\nto something I raised. Let me give you the chance to do\nit.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. ELWOOD: Okay. I appreciate that.\nBut I just wanted to clarify one thing about\nwhat the notice of required modifications says because the\nnotice of required modifications basically sets out model\nplan language, and the model plan language in this case\nthat existed began -- first appeared in 1984 said\nexplicitly it may be added to existing plans. And the\nplan language itself doesn't contain any language that\nwould carve our existing accruals, so that by definition\nit would apply to existing accruals. And I think that if\nthe Treasury had intended it to apply only to future\nbenefit accruals, it would have contained language. And\nin fact, there are other provisions that specifically set\nout that kind of limiting language so it can only be\napplied to future accruals. So I'd say that. It's not -\nI -- I think it's a -- a reasonable negative inference\nthat can be drawn from that. It's not going out on a limb\ntoo much.\nQUESTION: Mr. Elwood, you --\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Elwood.\nMR. ELWOOD: Thank you.\nQUESTION: Mr. Gossett, it's your turn.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID M. GOSSETT\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. GOSSETT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe Central Laborers' Pension Fund promised Tom\nHeinz and Rick Schmitt that after they accepted an early\nretirement package, they would be entitled to work in\nspecific jobs without sacrificing their pension plans. It\nis a foundational principle of ERISA that participants are\nentitled to rely on plan promises such as this one. By\nreneging on this promise and changing the rules after the\nfact, the plan violated section 204(g) of ERISA and\ndecreased the value of participants' plan, as Justice\nScalia -\nQUESTION: Let's assume I -- I agree with you on\nthat. The -- there's -- there's another reliance problem\nhere and -- and that, I take it, is the -- is the reliance\nupon a contrary view taken by the IRS. And the -- the -\nyour -- your colleagues on the other side say that if we\nsee it your way, there's an enormous number of plans out\nthere who are suddenly going to find themselves\nunqualified or disqualified, whatever the term is. Is -\nis there a way to avoid that if -- if you are correct on\nthe law, but they are correct about the -- the practice?\nMR. GOSSETT: Yes, Justice Souter.\nQUESTION: What part are we -- how does that -\nMR. GOSSETT: Under Internal Revenue Code\nsection 7805(b), the IRS has the right to say that any\namendment before the date of this -- of this Court's\ndecision in this case wouldn't lead to a disqualification\nof -- of the plan.\nQUESTION: Oh, I don't think they could because\nyou have an answer there to question 6 which says that if\nyou put in your original plan a provision that would say\nthe employer can change the definition of who's working in\nhis same company over time, as labor circumstances call\nfor it, that that gives the employer discretion, and you\ncan't do it because giving them that discretion would\nitself count as a reduction.\nNow, that's well established. The whole point\nof this -- so you tell me how they could write a plan to\ndo what you think they should be able to do. And of\ncourse, they should. That's the whole point of this part\nof 203.\nMR. GOSSETT: No, Justice Breyer. The -- the\npart -- the -- the point of 203 is not to allow plans to\nchange the rules over time -\nQUESTION: The whole point of 203, as I\nunderstand it, is that it was something put in there by\nthe Teamsters or possibly the crafts unions so that when\nyou get your -- your early retirement benefit and you're\nout there, don't come back to my plant. Why not my plant?\nBecause when you do, you will work for a low wage and that\nwill depress the wages of other workers.\nNow, I'm not going to say absolutely never. I'm\nnot going to say always. It's going to depend on labor\nconditions, and that's why if that purpose is not what\nthat part of 203 is there for, you can explain why it is\nthere. But if I'm right about why it's there, your\ninterpretation not only disrupts 20 years of -- of how\nthis has been administered, but also makes it unworkable.\nMR. GOSSETT: That's not why it's there, Justice\nBreyer.\nQUESTION: Why is it there?\nMR. GOSSETT: Section -- section 203(a)(3)(B),\nfor starters, only applies to normal retirement benefits.\nUnder section 203(a) of ERISA, normal retirement benefits\nare -- cannot be forfeited. But for section 203(a)(3)(B),\nthere would be no situation in which a plan could suspend\nbenefit payments. So 203(a)(3)(B) specifies -- it\ndelimits the limited circumstances in which -\nQUESTION: Put a little footnote here that I may\nnot agree with your statement, but go ahead.\nMR. GOSSETT: Okay. I -- footnote noted.\nBut the point of 203(a)(3)(B) is to say that you\ncan only limit plans -- suspensions in two certain\ncircumstances. The -- if you look at the legislative\nhistory of 203(a)(3)(B), though, it discusses how -- how\nemployers shouldn't be required to subsidize competitors.\nThey shouldn't be required to -- union employers should\nnot have former union workers going in for work for non\nunion competitors at lower wages because they're also\nreceiving a pension benefit. That's what's rife\nthroughout the legislative of ERISA.\nBut there's nothing in that -- that purpose\nwhich requires a plan to be able to change the rules,\nwhich is what they want.\nQUESTION: That -- that would be an odd purpose.\nNow, wait, you're saying that the purpose of this -- I\nhave a -- a plant where I make trousers and some of my\nworkers have retired early. And you're saying the purpose\nof this provision is to make sure that my worker who's\nretired early doesn't go work for Justice Ginsburg's\nplant, the trousers, some other plant. All right?\nNow, that would be very odd to have that purpose\nserved by the language which I think says by -- that -\nthat in the case of a plan other than by an employer who\nmaintains the plan -- that is, it's talking about going\nback to the same plant, isn't it? Am I wrong?\nMR. GOSSETT: Well, in -- there -- there are -\nQUESTION: They're -- they're talking about\ngoing back to my plant, isn't it?\nMR. GOSSETT: In the context of a single\nemployer plan, which is -\nQUESTION: That's -- am I right about that?\nIt's talking about going back to my plant, not Justice\nGinsburg's plant.\nMR. GOSSETT: Sure. In the single employer\nplan, it only limit -- it's only to prevent double -- true\ndouble dipping. What double dipping is, is where you\naccrued benefits while also receiving benefits from the\nsame plan. It's -- it's --\nQUESTION: I thought that --\nMR. GOSSETT: That's all you can -\nQUESTION: -- if I've retired early and I'm an\nexpert trouser maker, I could go back to work for Justice\nGinsburg's plant and nobody would care as far as this\nprovision is concerned. Right?\nMR. GOSSETT: If your pension fund was a\nsingle -\nQUESTION: Yes. It's my -- my -\nMR. GOSSETT: -- employer pension fund. It was\nnot a multiemployer.\nQUESTION: All right.\nMR. GOSSETT: But in the multiemployer context,\nit's -- it's only about cross-subsidization. But the\nbottom line is that in either of those cases, there's no\nreason why the pension fund -- why the -- the fund should\nbe allowed to change the rules. The -- those -\nQUESTION: The reason is supposedly -- what they\nsay is the reason we want to change the rules is because\nlabor conditions change and whereas in this year where the\nplant -- where the economy is booming, I don't really have\na problem, at least my workers don't, with retirees coming\nback and depressing their wages.\nQUESTION: Well, it wouldn't be changing the\nrules, would it, if you said at the beginning these rules\ncan be changed? Isn't that all your saying, that -- that\nthe employer can do it so long as when the plan is\nestablished, it is made clear that the rules can be\nchanged?\nMR. GOSSETT: Not exactly.\nQUESTION: Then -- then you're not changing the\nrules when you change the rules, so to speak.\nQUESTION: I -- I thought your brief was -- was\ncandid, Mr. Gossett, and you said you couldn't -- you\ncould not do what Justice Scalia just suggested. You\ncouldn't say up front in the plan, we can amend it anytime\nback and forth the way we like. I thought you said quite\nclearly in your brief that that wouldn't work.\nMR. GOSSETT: Yes, Justice Ginsburg. I -- I\nagree completely.\nThe -- the point is that there's no difference\nbetween a plan provision that says we can change the\nsuspension rules at any point and reduce them versus a\nplan provision that says we can reduce your benefit from\n$1,600 a month to $1,400 a month at any point if we so\nchoose.\nQUESTION: And the only --\nMR. GOSSETT: Both of those would -- sorry.\nQUESTION: I want to get the answer to Justice\nScalia's before you lose that.\nMR. GOSSETT: This is -\nQUESTION: Now, I thought that what he was\nsuggesting was not possible because of the reason of the\nanswer to question 6. Am I right or wrong?\nMR. GOSSETT: The answer to question 6 in the -\nin the regulations is a subsidiary answer. I think it's\nby far the less important answer.\nQUESTION: No, but I want to know first if I'm\nright or wrong.\nMR. GOSSETT: Yes. That is an answer is that it\ncannot be -\nQUESTION: I am right.\nMR. GOSSETT: -- discretionary on the -- to the\nplan to cut back -- to do something because of plan\nfunding.\nBut the more fundamental answer is that if that\nwere the case, every plan could include a provision that\nsaid in just these words, any benefit that we've promised\nyou in this plan can be reduced at a future date at our\ndiscretion. And if a plan could say that and still be\nvalid under ERISA, the anti-cutback rule would be\nmeaningless. Every plan would -- could say that.\nSo ERISA was passed specifically because\nhistorically plans were pulling back benefits, relying on\nthe common law rule that a pension is simply a gratuity.\nAnd the anti-cutback rule is the primary provision in\nERISA that was designed to say, no, when a -- a\nparticipant is promised something, that promise has to be\nkept.\nQUESTION: Yes, but if -- if your hypothesis is\nthat even when it says they're promised nothing, in other\nwords, that they -- it can be changed retroactively -\nyou're -- you're saying that that is a promise that's not\nkept?\nMR. GOSSETT: That is a promise that is kept on\nthe most technical level, of course. If I'm promised\nnothing and I'm given nothing, I -- I -\nQUESTION: You can't complain.\nMR. GOSSETT: -- one simply can't complain. But\nthe -- the whole goal of ERISA is to require employers to\nsay we're going to -- to say we're going to give you this\nand -- and keep their -- their word to that.\nQUESTION: I thought it was 203 that -- that\nprovided that guarantee. I thought it was 203 that\nprevents you from going too far in what you say you can\nchange.\nMR. GOSSETT: It is both 203 and 204, Justice\nScalia.\nQUESTION: I don't see how 204 does it.\nMR. GOSSETT: The -- the -- Mr. Goldstein tries\nto differentiate 203 and 204 and argue that they're\ncompletely distinct beasts, the one not affecting the\nother. That's simply not the case. As the IRS has said\nin its regulations, anything that indirectly decreases a\nbenefit is equally violative of 204(g).\nAnd it's easy to come up with -- with plan\nprovisions that, quote, forfeit a benefit rather than\ndecrease the benefit, but which obviously reduced the\nvalue you get. I mean, the most obvious example would be\na -- an amendment that says, each month we're going to\nflip a coin and decide whether or not you get a check this\nmonth. That benefit would be -\nQUESTION: My -- my true question -- it isn't -\nit isn't -- I think there's no easy answer to this case.\nAll right? And I agree with you that in ordinary English,\nwe'd call this a reduction. But there is in 203(g) -- or,\nyou know, the 203 part we're talking about -- there is an\nobvious purpose to do something that is not consistent\nwith the normal ERISA purposes. It's right there and it's\ndone for labor reasons. And you can interpret it either\nway.\nSo given the either-way possibility, in my own\nmind this is where I am. I'm telling you truthfully. I'd\nsay -\nMR. GOSSETT: Thank you.\nQUESTION: -- either-way possibility. Well,\nthey've had this for 20 years. They have regs that are\nconsistent with it. People have lived with it. Go with\nthe administration. I mean, that's -- all right? So\nthat's -- that's where I -- that's what I -- that's how\nI'm thinking about it, and I'd like to hear your response\nto that.\nMR. GOSSETT: Okay. I have several responses to\nthat because it's obviously a critical point.\nThe -- the first response is that although the\nIRS and Mr. Goldstein have told us that this is a\nlongstanding Government position, the only thing they can\nactually point to that states that position is the\nInternal Revenue Manual that dates to 2001. The List of\nRequired Modifications, the LRM, not the IRM, which does\ngo back quite some time earlier, specifically says that it\nis designed to aid people in drafting or redrafting plans\nand that the provisions included therein could be useful\nin some plans, it could be violative in other plans. So\nthat's not authority by which someone can actually look at\nan IRS publication and say, this is what we have -- the\nIRS allows.\nThey say that they've issued letters --\ndeterminations that they have allowed these in the past,\nbut those are not due deference under -- certainly not\nunder Chevron, probably not even under Skidmore. Those\nare sort of individual case determinations and they have\nput none of these in the record.\nAnd in any event, under section -- code section\n7805, the IRS says that those can be wrong, and if they're\nwrong, all it means is the plan can't be disqualified for\nhaving done something wrong. There's -- there are no tax\nimplications. The plan can still owe damages to someone\nwho in fact was hurt by the amendment, but that is itself\na small cost in this case.\nMr. Goldstein is engaged -- and more to the\npoint, his amici is engaging in hyperbole by saying this\nis going to bankrupt plans. In the joint appendix at page\n80, the plan -- the plan's actuary tells us that exactly\nseven people's benefits were cut off as a result -\nsuspended as a result of this amendment. That's out of\n5,300 active pensioners, according to the plan's web site\nat the moment. We're talking less than two-tenths of 1\npercent of people were, in fact, cut -- suspended because\nof -\nQUESTION: But it's not -- if your -- if your\nposition prevails, then I take it the only way an employer\ncan protect himself against hard times is to say for this\nclass of early retirees, no employment. Any employment\nwill result in suspension of benefits, and to say for the\nones -- normal retirees are the ones who are restricted\nonly with respect to the same trade, to make the rule as\nrestrictive as possible. I think that your -- your\ninterpretation forces the employer who wants to protect\nagainst hard times to take that view. Is that not so?\nMR. GOSSETT: I -- I disagree, Justice Ginsburg.\nThe -- from the -- the employer setting up a plan, the\nsettlers of a plan, all they care about is how much money\na plan is going to cost them. And it's a -- it's a design\ndecision whether or not you'd rather have a benefit of,\nsay, $2,000 a month with a narrow -- a narrower suspension\nrule or $1,990 a month with a wider suspension rule. Both\nof those plans cost the employer the same amount of money.\nThere's no -- the -- the details of the number, of course,\nare -- are questions for actuaries. But the -- the design\nquestion is one that can be made completely independent of\nthis. Is it's how important is it to the employer whether\npeople go back to work in other jobs, how important is it\nto the employees that they can work in specific jobs.\nThe -- while a change in the plan might save the\n-- the plan money, the initial design decision about how\nrestrictive the rules should be isn't a financial question\nin the -- in the slightest. And in fact, the fact that\nthe change in the plan -- the -- in the suspension rule,\nthe amendment here saved the plan money, is in fact I\nthink the best evidence of all that the amendment violates\nthe anti-cutback rule. The anti-cutback rule prevents,\nquote, a decrease -\nQUESTION: You're -- you're back to the word\nreduction where I agree with you. But I would have\nthought that this -- this provision here in 203 really\nreflects a tension within the union. The union wants to\nget benefits for its early retirees, and that argues for\ngoing back. But the union also wants to reflect -- or\nprotect the wages of the people who are already there.\nAnd that means that if there is a recession, what we want\nto do is stop too many people from going back because that\nmight have a depressing effect on the workers who are\nthere.\nNow, I put that again because that -- that was\nhow I began to understand what was going on in this\nprovision and I want you to be able to say, no, you're\nwrong. That isn't what's going on.\nMR. GOSSETT: What's going on is that --\nJustice Breyer, is that plans -- that -- that unions and\nthe employers want to prevent cross-subsidization. But\nthere's -- while it is certainly the case that, at least\naccording to this plan and its amici, they have started to\nrely on this purported right to deal with changing market\nconditions, they have no authority for doing so. The only\nthing they can point to is one floor statement by\nRepresentative Dent after that provision of ERISA, in\nfact, had been enacted, saying that there might be some\nchange in market conditions which would affect things.\nEmployers can deal with changing market conditions in the\ntraditional ways. They can pay more or less money.\nAnd in any event, the thing missing in that\napproach to 203 is the foundational principle that ERISA\nis designed to protect participants. It's not designed to\nprotect plans. It's designed to protect the participants\nin the plans. That's why it -- that's why the vesting and\naccrual rules are very explicit. And in fact, turning\nvery briefly to the vesting rules, Mr. -\nQUESTION: It's certainly designed to protect\nplans in some respects, the preemption, that sort of\nthing.\nMR. GOSSETT: Yes, that's true, but that's\nlargely an indirect way of protecting the plan -- the\nplans and more indirectly the -- the participants and more\nindirectly the participants and more indirectly the\nFederal fisc because, of course, plans are -- are insured\nby the Pension Benefit Guaranty Board.\nQUESTION: Am I right about this, that -- that\nthe -- that there is a specific provision in there for the\n-- for the protection of the plans? I forget what it is,\nbut isn't there a provision that if the plan gets in\nfinancial straits, then in fact there -- there can -- can\nbe an amendment that might otherwise might be allowed, an\namendment that would -- would save the plan money? Is\nthat correct? Or save the employer money so he can\ncontinue to contribute to the plan. Is that correct?\nMR. GOSSETT: With the -- yes, Justice Souter.\nWith the -- with the consent of the Secretary of Labor,\nwith the disclosure -\nQUESTION: Okay.\nMR. GOSSETT: -- to the Secretary of Labor and\nconsent, you can pass an amendment in a plan that -\nQUESTION: And that would -- that would -\nMR. GOSSETT: -- reduces benefits.\nQUESTION: -- be -- that would be a redundancy\non -- on the argument that your -- your colleagues on the\nother side make then I take it. On their position, that\nwouldn't be necessary.\nMR. GOSSETT: Yes.\nQUESTION: Yes.\nQUESTION: Mr. Gossett, would you just make sure\nI understand one thing correctly? It's been asked two or\nthree times, but I want to be sure I'm right on it.\nThe amendment that -- the plan provision that\nJustice Scalia hypothesized which authorized this sort of\nchange -- you agree that if you prevail, that kind of plan\nprovision would be impermissible.\nMR. GOSSETT: I don't think this Court needs to\nreach the question because the plan in this case doesn't,\nin fact, include that provision.\nQUESTION: No, I understand that.\nMR. GOSSETT: But I think that that plan\nprovision would not be permissible.\nQUESTION: Yes, I think that's right. It's\nstill is the same -- it doesn't affect your argument, so I\njust wanted to be sure about that.\nMR. GOSSETT: Yes, yes, I agree with that.\nI -- I want to -\nQUESTION: Because of what? Just tell me the\nprovision that you think precludes it.\nMR. GOSSETT: I think that it is on the narrow\n-- on the narrow end -- it's a technical level -- it's\nprecluded under the IRS's own regulations which point out\nthat you can't have -- you can't change conditions in a\nway that violates missions. But -- but on the more\nfundamental level, it violates -\nQUESTION: I want the statutory provision. I\nwant the statutory provision that makes that no good.\n204(g).\nMR. GOSSETT: 204(g).\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. GOSSETT: 204(g)(1) which says you can't\ndecrease benefits. And while one can come up with a\ntechnical reason -- reading of that said that your\nprovision would not violate 204(g)(1), it would read\n204(g)(1) -- 204(g) out of ERISA because -\nQUESTION: And this is what we were discussing\nbefore and you spell this out in your brief, and you were\nvery candid in saying Justice Scalia's solution wouldn't\nwork.\nMR. GOSSETT: Yes, Justice Ginsburg.\nI -- I want -- I wanted to turn quickly to -- to\n203(c), the -- the amendment provision in the vesting\nstatute that Mr. Goldstein talked about. There are a\ncouple of things to note about that.\nThe first and foremost is probably that it shows\nthat 203(a)(1)(B), the -- the suspension rule that we're\ntalking about, talks about a plan providing for something.\nIn 203(c), they talk about a plan amending the rules. If\nthey had wanted to talk about an amendment in\n203(a)(1)(B), they could have. They -- they talked about\nterms amending things elsewhere in the same provision.\nBut more fundamentally, Mr. Goldstein is simply\nwrong that a plan can retroactively de-vest a participant\nof benefits that had previously vested. Under\n203(c)(1)(A), which is on page 4a of the yellow brief, it\n-- it explains that a plan amendment shall not -- shall be\ntreated as not satisfying 203 if the -- if the amended\namount is less than such a non-forfeitable percentage\ncommuted -- computed under the plan without regard to such\namendment.\nSo, for example, if a plan participant had\nearned 20 percent of their -- had a non-forfeitable\ninterest in 20 percent of their accrued benefit and the\nplan switched from a progression to a -- a cliff vesting,\nwhere you got everything in 5 years, they could do that,\nbut they couldn't remove your 20 percent. They could say\nyou don't vest in anything more until the 5-year period,\nbut they couldn't say you lose the 20 percent vested that\nyou already have.\nQUESTION: I think that they -- that the -- (c)\nbeing there shows no more than, that the words, shall\nprovide, which is the beginning of 203, do not mean shall\nprovide in the original plan. They must mean shall\nprovide in the original plan or through permissible\namendments because if they meant the original plan only,\nthere would be no safety.\nMR. GOSSETT: The term provide is not in\n203(a)(1)(A) and (B), which are the -\nQUESTION: It says at the very beginning, (A),\neach plan shall provide that. And as some of -- reading\nsome of what you've written, it's as if you think those\nwords mean in the original plan, and -- and I think they\npoint to (c) to say it can't mean that.\nMR. GOSSETT: Justice Breyer, the amendment of a\nplan is authorized under ERISA section 402(b)(3).\n402(b)(3) is the provision of ERISA that says any plan\nmust include a provision that allows amendments. The\namendments that are authorized under 402(b)(3) are then\nlimited by the anti-cutback rule, by the provisions of -\nof 203, by everything else in ERISA.\nThe -- these specific limitations on amendments,\nthough, are fully -- are all read in para materia. Each\n-- each limitation on amendments applies to every\namendment and there's no provision in 203 that says these\namendments are allowed.\nQUESTION: We're back to the circle. I mean,\nthe -- you're quite right. Every time it talks about the\namendments or otherwise, it uses some word like you can't\nreduce, and the ordinary -- it would have been simpler if\nthey had amended that word reduced, wherever it appears,\nwith the same exception they have here in 203. Then you'd\nlose definitely and you'd admit it. On the other hand,\nthey didn't put those words in and that gives the strength\nto your argument.\nBut on the other hand, they say, well, yes, that\nif in fact they didn't mean to read it in, they're really\ngoing to reduce the effectiveness of that same kind of\nthing over in 203, you see, because they just have it for\nthe forfeitability. They don't have it for the reduction.\nReally, please, that doesn't make much sense. So that's\nwhy, you know, I can't get a firm answer out of the\nlanguage.\nMR. GOSSETT: I think that the text of the\nstatute is pretty clearly on my side. The only thing that\nMr. Goldstein can point to is this created purpose and\nsupposed longstanding practice of plans to be allowed to\nchange rules retroactively in light of changing market\nconditions. But though the plans have been doing that,\nit's the text of the statute that controls and -\nQUESTION: But you do acknowledge that plans\nhave been making these changes and the IRS has been\naccepting them for purposes of the employer's tax\ndeductions.\nMR. GOSSETT: I know, Justice -\nQUESTION: Is that right?\nMR. GOSSETT: I know, Justice O'Connor, that\nthey did so in this case. Beyond that, all we have are\nstatements in the IRS's brief and in the National\nCoordinating Committee's brief, but they're not\nactually -\nQUESTION: Now, section 203 refers to normal\nretirement plans. You take the position that it doesn't\ncover early retirement.\nMR. GOSSETT: Section 203(a)(3)(B) doesn't apply\nto the subsidized portion of early retirement benefits.\nThe -- the -- that's obvious because it is an exception to\n203(a) which says that your normal retirement is non\nforfeitable.\nAnd the Government has taken this position as\nwell. This is not something that we created. In the\nregulation -- this is in 29 C.F.R. 2530.203. The\nGovernment explains that a plan can provide that early\nretirement benefits are suspended for any reason -- for\nany reemployment because 203(a)(3)(B) is defining the\nuniverse of possible suspension rules for normal\nretirement benefits, but it doesn't -- doesn't limit the\nuniverse of suspension rules for early retirement\nbenefits.\nAnd in fact, in September -- on the same\namendment that applied to Messrs. Heinz and Schmitt, that\n-- in that same amendment, the plan provided that for\nbenefits accrued after September 30th, 1998, but only sort\nof prospective benefits, not retroactive benefits, any\npost-retirement reemployment would lead to those benefits\nbeing suspended.\nThey -- and -- and this actually follows from\nthe -- again, from the IRS's own position. In the\nInternal Revenue Manual, the IRS says you can have a\nprovision saying that any work is -- is suspensive, but\nyou can only do that prospectively because applying the -\nsuch a changed rule retroactively would decrease their\nbenefits.\nBut to the extent that you can have a rule that\nsays any work is suspensive, that means that 203(a)(3)(B)\nisn't -- just isn't applicable here. It's not what\ndetermines whether or not someone -- the rules that a plan\ncan have for early retirement benefits. A plan can have\na -\nQUESTION: Was that distinction made in the\nSeventh Circuit between the early retirement benefits with\nregard to the application of 203(a)?\nMR. GOSSETT: Sorry.\nQUESTION: Was that -- was that an argument that\nyou presented to the Seventh Circuit distinguishing the\nearly retirements benefits from normal retirement benefits\nfor 203(a) purposes? I thought it was -- that it was\nacknowledged in the Seventh Circuit that 203(a) applied to\nthe early retirement benefits as well as the normal --\nnormal retirement benefits.\nMR. GOSSETT: 203(a) applies to early retirement\nbenefits to the extent that they are the actuarial\nequivalent, the net present -- the financial equivalent of\nnormal retirement benefits, but not to the subsidized\nportion of -- of them. So -- so I think the answer is\nyes, we did say that in -- in the lower court, but I'm not\n100 percent sure, Justice Ginsburg.\nThe -- one other point I wanted to -- to go\nover. Though the plan argues that 204(g) doesn't apply to\nthis change -- they say that the change only applies to a\nreduction in the value of a life annuity -- that's not the\nstatutory term. The -- the statutory definition of an\naccrued benefit, which is in ERISA section 323, is the\nindividual's accrued benefit determined under the plan.\nIt's whatever the plan promises to the participant that is\nprotected by the plan. It's --\nQUESTION: You -- you say that 204(g) prevents\nthe plan at the outset from rendering itself amendable,\nbut if you agreed with them that 204(g) does not prevent\nthe later amendment, it would also be true that 204(g)\ndoes not prevent the employer from the outset at saying\nthat the retirement benefits are amendable. Isn't that\nright?\nMR. GOSSETT: Justice Scalia, it allows an --\nyou can make an amendment --\nQUESTION: I was making the point earlier that\neven if we find for you, the employer would -- would have\na way of -- of solving the problem, which is simply at the\noutset to set forth. Now, it's very difficult for them to\nrespond to that argument when they say that 204(g) does\nnot stop -- does -- does not prevent a later change in the\nplan. How could it possibly prevent a later change but -\nnot prevent a later change, but prevent a change at the\noutset and announce that you're going to make a change?\nMR. GOSSETT: Well, it clearly prevents the\nlater change, which is what is at issue here. I think it\nalso prevents the earlier change because I think any other\nreading of the anti-cutback rule reads it out of the\nstatute, but I don't think the Court needs to address that\nquestion in this case.\nQUESTION: But another way of putting Justice\nScalia's point is if they're right, it's surprising that\nthey didn't make the point clearer in their plans because\nit would have been legal to do so.\nMR. GOSSETT: I don't think -- they didn't make\nthis argument below, to the best of my knowledge. They\nmade this argument that -\nQUESTION: But I mean if their basic theory of\nthe 204(g) is correct, then all the plans could have\nsolved this problem by saying so expressly so nobody would\nhave been fooled as your clients were. They could have\nsaid in the plan itself, we retain the right to do this.\nThey say it's just there by statute, but the plan is\nsomewhat ambiguous, and they could have said so expressly\nif they're right and you're wrong.\nMR. GOSSETT: Yes.\nQUESTION: They couldn't have done it if you're\nright and they're wrong.\nMR. GOSSETT: That's exactly right, Justice\nStevens. But of course, they didn't.\nThe -- the main provision on amendments in the\nplan, which is the provision at page 50 of the joint\nappendix, says that no amendment can decrease the accrued\nvalue. They elsewhere in the plan talk about notifying\nparticipants of changes to the plan and discussed that\nthere could be a change, but that change -- that doesn't\nsay that there can be a retroactive change. There could\nhave been a prospective change that loosened the rules.\nThere could also have been a prospective change that\napplied to newly accrued benefits because by the terms of\nthat provision, the -\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. -- thank you, Mr.\nGossett.\nMr. Goldstein, you have 2 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS C. GOLDSTEIN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nI have four points. The first deals with what\nkind of promises we can make to participants that they can\nenforce. The promise can only go in one direction. That\nis, if we promise them we will not change the suspension\nrules, if they -- trustees put that provision in and the\nemployees and the participants rely on it, we -- that --\nto -- to change that would violate the plan and they would\nhave a right under 502 to enforce it.\nBut, Justice Scalia, there is no way that\nthere's a middle ground under which the plans flag for the\nparticipants, hey, this is open to a change because 204(g)\n-- if they win, they'll win under 204(g). 204(g) is\ncategorical. You can't reduce benefits even if you say\nyou're going to. It's just no way you can do it. And\ntherefore, the only middle ground is under our provision.\nIf participants and the trustees want a plan provision,\nmaking it a concrete promise, we won't change the rules.\nIf that's in the plan, it would be enforceable against us.\nBut it isn't.\nSecond -\nQUESTION: No, but your plan could have made\nclear what you say the law otherwise authorizes.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: It could have, although I would\nsay that the provisions cited by the Assistant to the\nSolicitor General talks about telling a person who is in\nretirement about a material change in the suspension\nrules, and that's -- that's pretty clear to my mind. But\nit's true. It could have gone -- we could have been even\nmore clear, but this is a right, a statutory right, that\nwe have.\nJustice O'Connor, Justice Ginsburg, what does\n203 cover? It covers a normal retirement benefit, and\nusually what we think of as an early retirement benefit,\nthat is, the unsubsidized portion of an -- of a early\nretirement benefit.\nThe third is it is -- Justice Breyer is\nabsolutely right about the purpose of this provision. We\nwant to be able to adjust to current labor conditions.\nAnd Justice Souter, the statute recognizes that. 203(a)\nhas a special rule for multiemployer plans. They cover\nthings like construction and labor where the markets\nchange a lot, and they have a much narrower provision in\n203 for single employer plans.\nBut ultimately, I think that this is fairly\ncharacterized as ambiguous. The agency here has an\nenormous amount of experience in balancing the purposes of\nthese different statutes and knowing what's different\nbetween a decrease and a suspension.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr.\nGoldstein.\n"
