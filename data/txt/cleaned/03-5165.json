DUNHAM, JR.\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. DUNHAM: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe central issue in this case is whether the\nGovernment, having failed to prove that the police\ninitiated contact with Petitioner Thornton while he was an\noccupant of his automobile and having failed to prove that\nwhen Mr. Thornton was arrested, that he was even within\nreaching distance of his automobile, may rely on New York\nv. Belton to justify a warrantless, suspicionless search\nof Mr. Thornton's automobile incident to arrest.\nNow, it's the Government's burden -\nQUESTION: Well, now, Belton did involve a car\nsearch after the suspects had left the car and were under\narrest. They weren't in a position to reach into the car.\nMR. DUNHAM: They were within reaching distance\nof the vehicle, Justice O'Connor.\nQUESTION: And arrested.\nMR. DUNHAM: They -- they were standing by the\nside of the car at the -- at the moment of arrest.\nQUESTION: Right, but then they were disabled by\nthe arrest. They couldn't reach into the car, and after\nthat, the search occurred, and we -- we said, okay, that\nyou could search if -- for a recent occupant of the\nvehicle. I just -- I think the reasons articulated in\nBelton weren't all that clear, but it may cover this case.\nMR. DUNHAM: Well, Your Honor, I -- I believe\nthat when you focus on the word recent, it's not a very\nbright line test unless you flesh it out and give it some\ndefinition. I believe I was a recent occupant of my\nautomobile this morning. Somebody could say I was\nrecently in that, but that wouldn't mean that they could\ngo search it.\nWell, the facts show -\nQUESTION: Do we know from the facts here?\nMR. DUNHAM: -- a lot less -- the facts here\nshow a lot less time, but recent doesn't give the kind of\nclear bright line that Belton said it was trying to draw\nbecause it -- it's open to a lot of interpretation.\nOur -\nQUESTION: How about moments?\nQUESTION: You conceded -- the Fourth Circuit\nsaid that it was conceded in the -- that he was in close\nproximity to his vehicle when Officer Nichols approached\nhim, and the record does conclusively show that Officer\nNichols observed Thornton park and exit his automobile and\nthen approached Thornton within moments. You don't\ndispute any of that I take it.\nMR. DUNHAM: No. Those -- those are the facts\nof the case, Your Honor.\nBut moments again -- is he -- is he 5 yards, 10\nyards, 15 yards away from the vehicle? We -- I think we\nneed to go back to what Belton was all about. Belton said\nthat it concerns the proper -- quoting at page 459 of the\nBelton opinion, it says the proper scope of a search of\nthe interior of an automobile, incident to a lawful\ncustodian -- custodial arrest of its occupants. And the\nBelton rule itself says, quote, at page 460, when a\npoliceman has made a lawful arrest of the occupants of an\nautomobile, he may, as a contemporaneous incident of that\narrest, search the passenger compartment of that\nautomobile.\nBelton was focusing on that highly dangerous\nsituation when a police officer initiates contact with and\napproaches a -- an occupied vehicle. As this Court\nrecognized in Pennsylvania v. Mimms, that may be the most\nhighly dangerous situation an officer faces.\nQUESTION: But there was no search until the -\nBelton was -- wasn't he in -- in the patrol car by the\ntime they started the search?\nMR. DUNHAM: So was Mr. Thornton, Your Honor,\nand I -\nQUESTION: But -- so I -- that's what I don't -\nit's quite different from search into -- incident to\narrest. The -- the area around the defendant, the\ndefendant may still grab a gun. But the one thing we know\nis that when the defendant -- when the suspect is sitting\nin the patrol car with handcuffs on, there isn't any\ndanger that the police faces when they're doing the\nsearch. When they arrested him, yes, but not when they\nsearch -- do the search.\nMR. DUNHAM: I would agree with that 100\npercent, Your Honor, but the converse of that position is\nthat in order to do the search, the -- that he's allowed\nto do under the Fourth Amendment, that -- that right to\nsearch fixes at the moment he effects the custodial\narrest. You don't want to -- or it's not reasonable to\nrequire the officer to conduct that search with the\nsuspect at his elbow.\nSo while I would agree with Your Honor as a -\nas a very practical matter, there is no danger to the\nofficer in the situation where the man is arrested,\nstuffed in the back of the squad car, and then we go\nsearch, that's kind of a fiction. But on the other hand,\nit may be a kind of a reasonable fiction because\notherwise, the converse is, if the officer is going to\nsearch the car, he's got to do it with Mr. Thornton or Mr.\nBelton standing right beside him. And that's why -\nQUESTION: So you don't object to the search\ntaking place when there's no danger to the officer, but\nyou say in order to do that non-dangerous search, the\nofficer has to put himself in danger when he makes the\narrest.\nMR. DUNHAM: That's -- that's right. I -- and I\n-- and I believe, Your Honor, that's why -- this case is\nreally presenting a situation where we're dealing with the\nharm to the Fourth Amendment instead of really dealing\nwith potential danger to the officer. Modern police\npractices are going to have a Mr. Belton or a Mr. Thornton\nin the back of the squad car at the time these searches\nincident to the arrest under Belton or whether you're\noperating -\nQUESTION: Was there -- were there reasonable\ngrounds here, do you concede that, for the Terry pat-down\nof petitioner?\nMR. DUNHAM: Your Honor, there may or may not -\nQUESTION: Is that contested?\nMR. DUNHAM: The -- that ground, that exception\nto the warrant requirement was not advanced by the\nGovernment below.\nQUESTION: All right. I mean, there was a Terry\nstop. There was a pat-down. Narcotics were found. He\nwas arrested. Right? Subsequently the search.\nMR. DUNHAM: That's correct. We -\nQUESTION: Of the vehicle.\nMR. DUNHAM: We have not -\nQUESTION: Now, had -- had the officer not made\nan immediate search of the vehicle, presumably the police\nwould have to have taken precautions to safeguard the car\nand make an inventory search of it. So they're going to\nfind the stuff anyway, aren't they?\nMR. DUNHAM: Well, Your Honor, the -- the Fourth\nCircuit did not address -\nQUESTION: Isn't that right?\nMR. DUNHAM: Well, not necessarily, Your Honor.\nWe're not conceding that particularly in this case. We're\nnot saying that there -- this case involves a car that was\nparked in a -- in a shopping mall parking lot. And the\nonly motor vehicle violation didn't authorize a towing of\nthe vehicle. So that the -- the -- there is an inadequate\nrecord below with regard to whether or not there would\nhave been an inevitable towing and inventory of this car.\nQUESTION: Well, it seems to me that Justice\nO'Connor's questions are -- are getting to your comment\nthat Belton is a -- is a fiction. And maybe it's not a\nfiction. Maybe the officer, at the time he conducts the\nsearch, is not in immediate danger, but if he left the\nvehicle without conducting the search, a confederate can\ncome by. There could be somebody with another key. A\npasser-by can come and get the gun if the car isn't\nlocked, and there's going to be an inventory search\nanywhere -- anyway. So Belton, rather than being a\nfiction, makes a good deal of sense in terms of safety,\nmaybe not safety at the time the officer is making the\nvery search. Maybe that's somewhat fictional.\nMR. DUNHAM: You could make the same argument\nwith regard to the house in Chimel, that we limit the\nsearch to the area within reaching distance in the room\nthat the man is in. We don't let him go into the kitchen\nor the bedroom. But there could be accomplices there.\nThere could be guns there.\nQUESTION: Houses are -- houses are stationary\nand cars are not. So we have to draw the line there.\nMR. DUNHAM: Well, it -- the -- if the -- the\njustification in Belton for allowing the vehicle search\nsays it's not a departure from Chimel, and it limits the\nsearch to an area within the reaching distance. It's\nbased on a generalization, Your Honor, that everything\nwithin the narrow passenger compartment of the vehicle is\nwithin reach of an occupant. Now, when a man is no longer\nan occupant and has become a pedestrian and is walking on\nthe street, that generalization that he can reach\neverything in the narrow passenger compartment of an\nautomobile no longer makes any sense.\nQUESTION: Well, then -- then Belton should have\nbeen -- if you're right, Belton should have -- not have\nbeen decided the way it was.\nMR. DUNHAM: Your Honor, Belton was decided\nabsolutely correctly I believe. The -- the -- Roger\nBelton was approached by the officer while he was an\noccupant of the vehicle. The officer asked him to step\nout of the car. I do not believe that we want to have our\nsearch incident to arrest doctrine turn on whether the\nofficer decides to have him step out before he places him\nunder arrest or arrest him, sit him in the -- sitting in\nthe vehicle. Five other -\nQUESTION: Well, suppose this -- this officer\nlets Mr. Thornton go to the shopping mall but is standing\nguard next to the car and Mr. Thornton then comes back,\nenters the car and just as he enters, the police officer\nsays, you're arrested. Then he could do -\nMR. DUNHAM: In my view he would not be able to\ndo a Belton search. He would be able to a Chimel search.\nHe'd be able to arrest the individual under Chimel, which\nis still the -- the law in this Court, and he would be\nable to conduct a search of anything within Mr. Thornton's\nreaching distance at the time.\nQUESTION: So if -\nQUESTION: So if the car were -- the car door\nwere unlocked and his reach would have been long enough to\nget inside the -- the car if the door were open, he could\nsearch into the car?\nMR. DUNHAM: If -- if the -- if the car was -\nif he could -- he could search for anything within\nreaching distance of the person he's arresting.\nQUESTION: What about the answer to my question?\nMR. DUNHAM: If he could reach into the car, he\ncould -- he could get anything within the man's reach.\nQUESTION: Why is that reasonable? Why doesn't\nhe tell him, look it, move off, get -- get 10 yards away\nfrom the car, get 20 yards away, however? I -- I mean,\nyou -- you don't really suggest that there is a necessity\nto conduct a Belton search in order to protect the\nofficer. All he has to do is say, get away from the car.\nMR. DUNHAM: Well, I -- I agree with Your Honor\nthat if he hasn't arrested the man and he has an\nopportunity to let the man move away from the car before\nhe conducts the arrest, he's certainly acting as a prudent\nofficer in protecting his own safety. I would agree with\nthat.\nQUESTION: It seems to me -\nQUESTION: Belton must then rest on some kind of\nbright line administrative consideration because you're\nattacking Belton in various ways which are logical. But\nour problem I think in this case is to decide whether the\nparticular limit that you propose makes sense, and that's\nwhere I'm having a problem because what you say is that\nthe -- the line to be drawn around Belton is not just a\nline of -- in time and space, which I could understand.\nBut you want to say it depends on whether the policeman\ninitiated conduct with the individual before he exited the\ncar. And that seems to me that you're trying to\ndistinguish between the case where the policeman notices a\nwanted suspect driving, pulls over to the side. The\npolice -- the -- the suspect takes off and runs over to a\nfence. Now, that would be okay. That's Belton.\nBut the car stops before the policeman\nrecognizes him. The driver gets out and then the\npoliceman recognizes him, and then he takes off for the\nfence and it's exactly the same. That you would say is\nnot Belton.\nNow -- now, that line that you're drawing there\nto me -- I -- I don't understand it at all in terms of the\nBelton rationale or administrative. It would make it more\ncomplicated and it wouldn't achieve that much. It seems\n-- in other words, I want you to explain why that line is\na rational way of limiting Belton.\nMR. DUNHAM: I would suggest, Your Honor, that\nthe man who exits the vehicle and runs to the fence, 15,\n20, 30 yards from the vehicle, whether he did it because\nthe police pulled up behind him and turned the flashers on\nor whether the policeman surprised him as he was coming\nout of the car, neither one of those searches are good\nunder Belton because the man -- it's -- it's no longer\nappropriate in my judgment to rely -\nQUESTION: That's not what the question\npresented says. It says, when the arrestee was not in the\ncar when the police initiated contact with him.\nMR. DUNHAM: I understand.\nQUESTION: So what I thought you were advocating\nis if the policeman was not in the car when the police\ninitiated contact with him, unless he's within reaching\ndistance, which he isn't -- if he's not in the car when\nthe police initiated contact with him, then don't apply\nBelton.\nMR. DUNHAM: That's -- that's correct, Your\nHonor.\nQUESTION: And that was the line that I was\nhaving trouble figuring out a justification for.\nMR. DUNHAM: That -- that's correct, Your Honor,\nand if I might respond.\nThe -- our -- our test under Belton has two\nprongs to it. One is that he's in the car when the police\ninitiate contact with him. The second is that he's\narrested within reaching distance of the car. So your\nhypothetical that the man runs to the fence -\nQUESTION: You're saying that Belton never\napplies as within reaching -- if he's outside reaching\ndistance of the car.\nMR. DUNHAM: If he's -- if he's outside reaching\ndistance, it doesn't make any sense -\nQUESTION: Okay. That's -- that's one possible\nrule. That would -- that would invalidate what is\nordinary police practice in almost every place, which is\nthat they remove him, he's outside the police -- I take it\nit would.\nMR. DUNHAM: Well, it's the moment -\nQUESTION: Can the policeman make him stay\nwithin reaching distance? Wait. Don't -- don't get any\nfurther than that. I want you to stay right there.\nMR. DUNHAM: The policeman can arrest him and\ntake control of him. So I would argue yes, he can make\nhim stay within reaching distance.\nThe -- the justification for the Belton search\nis to protect the officer. It's not reasonable to think\nthat he's going to effect his arrest at a point that\nincreases the danger to himself just so that he can make a\nsearch.\nQUESTION: Okay. I mean, I understand the\nargument, and it's been made many times and there's a lot\nof logic to it. But it's been pretty consistently\nrejected. So -- but I got it. At least I understand it\nand -- and maybe it will be accepted or not.\nBut let's put that one aside, the reaching\ndistance point. Do you want to defend the other\ndistinction your making, which I take it is even if you\nlose on reaching distance, still Belton does not apply if\nthe initial contact was made between the police and the -\nand the suspect outside the car?\nMR. DUNHAM: We -- that is -\nQUESTION: You want to give up on that one.\nMR. DUNHAM: No.\nQUESTION: Or you want to defend it?\nMR. DUNHAM: No, no.\nQUESTION: Then defend it.\nMR. DUNHAM: Our -- the initiation of contact we\nbelieve is a -- is a very reasonable test, and we believe\nit's called for by the Belton case itself. When you read\n-- when you read Belton, it says it is a narrow -- narrow\n-- class of problematic recurring cases, and then it gives\nseven cases as examples of cases that fall within its\nclass. And in every single one of those cases, with the\npossible -- a marginal exception of one, the police are\ninitiating contact with the man while he is an occupant of\na vehicle. We -\nQUESTION: And that escalates the danger of the\nsituation. I mean, why -- what sensible regime would say,\npolice officer, don't take the precaution of waiting to\nmake the arrest till the person stops and gets out of the\ncar? That way, police officer, you won't be in danger of\nthe man grasping for a gun.\nOr suppose it's a case where the police want to\nfollow that car and not signal because they want to find\nout where the crack house is that he's going to. So if\nthey signal, they make initial contact, they give away the\nwhole -- the whole thing. They will not find the\ndestination they're looking for.\nTo -- to say that Belton is okay but -- in those\nsituations the -- the police would not have the\npossibility of within moments after the suspect exits the\ncar arresting him and then doing a car search. It just\ndoesn't seem to make any sense.\nMR. DUNHAM: Well, Your Honor, if you -- if you\nthink about it, that most -- the most dangerous situation\nfor the police officer is when he initiates contact with\nthe person while he's an -- an occupant in an -- of an\nautomobile, but has not yet gotten up to the point where\nhe can get him out and make an arrest. It's during that\ninterval between the time that the officer initiates\ncontact with the vehicle and the time when he actually\nmakes a custodial arrest that the danger to the officer is\nat its greatest point.\nQUESTION: Well, that's what -- why I asked\ndoesn't it make sense to say we're not going to initiate\ncontact while he's in the vehicle, but the minute he gets\nout, we will arrest him.\nMR. DUNHAM: Because in most cases, Your Honor,\nthe officer doesn't have a choice. You look at the case\nin New York v. Belton, I mean, he -- the officer was a -\nwas a State trooper pulling the man over on the highway.\nThe -- when -- when you -- and that's going to be the case\nmost of the time. You're going to have a -- a State\ntrooper or somebody with lights on top of their car that\nare pulling somebody over, and they don't really have a\nchoice. Or you've got undercover agents watching for the\ndrug transaction to occur and then before the dealers\ndrive off, they want to rush the car and make the arrest\nof the occupants. It -- the -- the officer frequently has\nno choice.\nAnd I like to think of it as when you turn on\nthe light to pull the man over, you turn on Belton.\nBelton comes on when you turn on the red light to signal\nthe man over.\nAnd what does it do for the officer? It\nimmediately defines, for purposes of a bright line rule,\nwho is an occupant. It not only defines who is an\noccupant, it defines who can become a recent occupant.\nQUESTION: Why -- why don't we save ourselves a\nlot of trouble and say that in almost all of these cases,\nthe police have an interest in what happens to the\nvehicle, they're going to take it away anyway, so they\nmight as well do the inventory search right away?\nMR. DUNHAM: Well, the -- the Court has come\nclose to entirely extinguishing -- extinguishing any\nFourth Amendment protection in a vehicle, and that kind of\na decision would give it the final death knell. There\nwould be no privacy left.\nQUESTION: But, I mean, does it make a lot of\nsense if in most cases, which I -- which I assume to be so\n-- I may be wrong. In most cases, especially when the car\nis on a -- on a street or in -- in a -- in a parking lot\n-- it's not at the residence -- they're going to have to\ntow that car and -- and check it. They probably should\nmake sure it's locked before they leave so that nothing\nwill be taken from the car, et cetera.\nMR. DUNHAM: What you end up with, Your Honor,\nis when you combine that view with the Court's decisions\nin Atwater and Whren, you end up with the police stopping\nsomebody in -- in a parking lot, maybe a short distance\naway in a store because they've got a dead inspection\nsticker. But it's a pretext because the officer wants to\nsearch the car.\nQUESTION: Well, no, my case -- my case says\nthere's been an arrest.\nMR. DUNHAM: Well, but the -- the Court's\ndecisions allow the arrest to be made on a minor traffic\nviolation that doesn't carry anything more than a $200\nfine on a pretext because the officer wants to search the\ncar. He then -- he makes the arrest on the -- on that\nunder -- under Wren and Atwater. He then has the right to\ngo search the entire vehicle.\nQUESTION: Well, my point -- my point is I\nassume it happens anyway. Now, empirically I may be\nwrong. Then that's a different case.\nQUESTION: Well, it is clear, is it not -- I -\nif I remember Belton, it is clear that the Belton rule\napplies to any arrest. It does not necessarily have to be\nan arrest in which they will impound the car. You could\nbe caught for speeding. That's what they stopped him for\nin Belton. They were speeding. And so I think Justice\nKennedy's hypothetical is not the facts of Belton.\nMR. DUNHAM: The -- the fact is that -- that\nBelton is an arrest. It doesn't require a towing or\ninventorying of the car. It is a -- a classic search\nincident to arrest.\nQUESTION: And it not only allows search of the\nvehicle but of every container in the vehicle. So\neverybody who's caught speeding has his vehicle -\neverything in that vehicle is subject to search.\nMR. DUNHAM: If they're -- if they are arrested,\nJustice Stevens. Many times -\nQUESTION: Correct.\nMR. DUNHAM: -- people are just issued a\ncitation. But if they're -- if they're stopped, even for\na bad traffic signal or not wearing a seat belt, they can\nbe subjected to a custodial arrest and have their entire\nvehicle searched. And I think that's why it's -- in\ndrawing the lines here with respect to Belton, recognizing\nthat the -- that the arrestee is usually in the back of\nthe squad car, and we're not here talking about officer\nsafety issues -- that we try to remain -- retain some\nsemblance of the Fourth Amendment with regard to\nautomobiles.\nQUESTION: The arrestee here, though, wasn't -\nwasn't in the back of the car, the back of the police car.\nMR. DUNHAM: Mr. Thornton was placed in the back\nof the police car before the search occurred, Your Honor.\nHe was arrested -\nQUESTION: Oh, after -- after he was arrested\nyou mean.\nMR. DUNHAM: Arrested, but before the search,\nYour Honor. And that's Justice Ginsburg's point. Where\nis the danger to the officer when the arrestee is in the\nback of the squad car? And that is a fiction and it is a\nfiction that courts accept, that if the squad car drives\noff with the man and takes him back to the station house,\nthen the right to search is gone, but as long as it's a\ncontemporaneous part of an unfolding scene -\nQUESTION: Who -- who -\nQUESTION: Unless the police have a practice of\ntrying to safeguard the vehicle since it -- it could be\nclaimed later by the person arrested, I had the Hope\ndiamond in the back seat and you people hauled me off to\njail, now you pay me for the Hope diamond. So, obviously,\nthey want to inventory it. And I suppose virtually every\npolice department has regular provisions to safeguard\nvehicles in those circumstances and do inventory searches.\nDon't they?\nMR. DUNHAM: I -- I assume most good police\ndepartments do, but in this -\nQUESTION: So I don't see how we're furthered in\nour concerns by your approach.\nMR. DUNHAM: Well, in this particular case, Your\nHonor, those inventory concerns were -- were not addressed\nin -- in the factual record. We believe we would win on\nthe issue of inevitable discovery. The Fourth Circuit\ndidn't address it.\nAnd moreover, you -- frequently you're going to\nhave an occupant arrested but that doesn't mean the\nvehicle is going to get towed.\nQUESTION: Why -- why instead of complicating it\n-- take Belton as a given. Sorry. Were you finished?\nMR. DUNHAM: I -- I was just going to finish,\nYour Honor, by saying that the -- that -- that you might\njust arrest one occupant and you might let the other\noccupants go on. So you can't necessarily say that the\nvehicle is always going to be towed and is always going to\nbe inventoried.\nQUESTION: I mean, would it -- do you think it\nwould work -- or why wouldn't work -- to try to control\nBelton by imposing limits on what's reasonable time and\nreasonable space so that you keep it really to a -- an\narrest that took place really when he was just within the\ncar and not too far away unless it's his fault because he\ntook off?\nAll right. Now, you'd do that through a common\nlaw approach. The lower courts would make their decisions\nand occasionally we could review one to say it went too\nfar one way or the other. That, it seems, is a -- is a\nprocedure for imposing limits on Belton that -- that might\nwork. Why wouldn't it?\nMR. DUNHAM: Well, Your Honor, as long as\nthey're -- they're more definite than words like recent or\nclose proximity -\nQUESTION: No, no. You'd have to -- you can't\nget -- unfortunately, language is what it is, and -- and\nsometimes efforts to make it clearer make matters worse.\nSo one way to control, in the presence of vague language,\nis through example.\nMR. DUNHAM: And I -- that's what I thought the\nCourt did in Belton was give examples. And if you follow\nthe examples that were given in Belton, you don't approve\nthe search that occurred with regard to Mr. Thornton,\nbecause if you're trying to draw a bright line, which is\nwhat you were trying to do in Belton, you have -- some\nthings fall on one side of that line and some things fall\non the other. And we would -- we would submit that once a\nperson, on his own without any prompting from the police,\nbecomes a pedestrian, he's no longer an occupant of a\nvehicle.\nQUESTION: How long after he got out of the car\ndid the arrest take place?\nMR. DUNHAM: Moments.\nQUESTION: What are moments?\nMR. DUNHAM: Well, the -- it seems like the\nentire time I've been standing here is moments because my\nlife is going in front of my eyes.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: All right, and how far -\nMR. DUNHAM: But in -- in any event, we would\nargue that the -- that the search here was outside of\nBelton and we would also argue that you have a perfectly\ngood 35-year-old precedent in Chimel. If Belton doesn't\napply and you're on the other side of the Belton line,\nthen you go to Chimel, and Chimel tells you what to do.\nChimel wasn't limited to houses. It is the rule that the\npolice use every single day when they effect a custodial\narrest. No new rules. No new guidance. Just if Belton\ndoesn't apply, go to Chimel.\nI'd like to save the rest of my time for\nrebuttal please.\nQUESTION: Very well, Mr. Dunham.\nMr. Garre, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY G. GARRE\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. GARRE: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and\nmay it please the Court:\nThe sole contention advanced by petitioner on\nappeal was that the search of his car was not lawful under\nthe rule of New York v. Belton because Officer Nichols did\nnot succeed in initiating contact with him while he was\nstill inside his car. The court of appeals correctly\nrejected that contention.\nTo begin with, petitioner's initiation of\ncontact rule has no foundation in the rationale of Belton.\nIt is the fact of the arrest and not the reason that the\nperson exited the car that gives rise to the justification\nfor the Belton search.\nThe custodial arrest is an extremely dangerous\nand volatile encounter for the officer in the field, and\nthat's particularly true in the case of the arrest of a\nrecent occupant of a vehicle. In Belton, this Court drew\nthe generalization that when the recent occupant of a\nvehicle is arrested, that the inside of the vehicle is\nalways within the area in which that occupant might try to\n-- try to lunge in order to get a weapon to effect his\nescape or to grab evidence to conceal it or destroy it in\nthe car.\nNow, the application of that generalization -\nQUESTION: May I just point out that the\nquestion presented in Belton defined it as an occupant of\nthe vehicle?\nMR. GARRE: That's correct, Justice Stevens, but\nthe Court did use the term recent occupant at page 460 of\nits decision.\nQUESTION: It also used occupant several times\nin the opinion.\nMR. GARRE: That's true, and -- and in\ndescribing the category of -\nQUESTION: And -- and the examples that it gave,\nas your opponent indicated, all were -- except one\npossible exception, all were occupants, weren't they, in\n-- in the cases that Justice Stewart -\nMR. GARRE: No, Justice Stevens. I -- I\nactually don't think that that's correct. I think the\nFrick case, which is discussed, listed with the cases\ndiscussed at page 459 of the decision, involved the\nsituation where the police came upon the person in a\nparking lot, and in that situation -- which was one of the\ncases that the Court identified as the disarray in the\ncase law that existed before Belton. And that's a\ncritical point for the Court to understand in weighing the\n-- the petitioner's reaching distance argument here.\nThis Court knows what the world is like in a\nreaching distance regime under Chimel and the important\ncontext in which the recent occupant of a car is arrested.\nAs the Court mentioned in -- in Belton, it's a world in\nwhich there's disarray and confusion in the case law, more\nlitigation and more confusion for the officer in the\nfield. The Court noted on page 460 of its decision in\nBelton that that kind of confusion was not helpful to the\npolice who need clear rules for the scope of their\nauthority in this context.\nQUESTION: Yes, but if you emphasize the clarity\n-- and that's what Justice Stewart did. He drafted what\nhe thought was a very clear rule. If you limit it to\noccupants, isn't that equally clear as the rule you\npropose?\nMR. GARRE: It's -- it's artificial, Justice\nStevens, and it's -\nQUESTION: Well, I agree it's artificial, but is\nit not equally clear?\nMR. GARRE: That is a clear -\nQUESTION: In fact, is it not more clear?\nBecause I don't know when you stop being a recent\noccupant.\nMR. GARRE: Well, with respect, we think it's an\nartificial rule, and -- and if I could -\nQUESTION: It is an artificial rule. We all\nagree with that, but what we're -- what we're looking for\nis a clear artificial rule. That's the purpose of Belton.\nMR. GARRE: No. I -- I think a rule which -\nwhich takes into account the justifications -\nQUESTION: Because the reason it's artificial is\nit explains that normally Chimel would control, and he\nsaid we want a special rule for -- for arrests of\noccupants of cars. And that's what they did. And we -\nand they made it so you can search the entire vehicle.\nThat's the other important part of Belton.\nMR. GARRE: But -- but it -\nQUESTION: And the entire -- all -- all\ncontainers in the vehicle I mean.\nMR. GARRE: If I could respond in this way.\nFirst, the vast majority of arrests that take place in the\nBelton context, including in this case, including in\nBelton itself, take place after the person is already\noutside of the car.\nQUESTION: Yes, but the contact with the police\nis when they're occupants.\nMR. GARRE: Well, that's true. And -- and let\nme talk, if I could, about the artificiality of that rule\nand why we think it's not a rule that the Court should\nadopt.\nQUESTION: Well, I'm trying to get an answer to\nthis question. I agree it's artificial. It's described\nin Belton as artificial. But the search in Belton was for\nthe clearest rule available, and my suggestion to you is\nthe rule of Belton, as -- as described in Belton itself\napplying to occupants of the cars at the time of contact,\nis clearer than a rule defined by recent occupant because\nwhat is a recent occupant.\nMR. GARRE: Well, let me answer both questions.\nI -- I don't think that that is going to be a clearer rule\nthan the rule that we're asking for in this case.\nAnd -- and to respond to your second question as\nto what is a recent occupant, in our view it's someone\nwho's just occupied the car. It's -- it's the person in\nthe vast majority of cases in which this question has\narisen. In this case it was clear that Officer Nichols\nmet petitioner moments after he exited the car, and that's\ngoing to be the situation in which this question has\narisen and it can arise in a number of ways.\nIn Michigan v. Long, the police -\nQUESTION: But would your rule apply to someone\nwho was out of the car for 5 minutes?\nMR. GARRE: Well, the -- the recency test that\nthe Court -- that we think the adopted or described in\nBelton is one that's tethered to the proximity of the\nautomobile. And there are going to be line-drawing\nproblems at the outer -\nQUESTION: Well, I'm trying to understand what\nyour definition of recent is.\nMR. GARRE: It's -- it's someone -- it's the\nperson who has gotten out of the car and who's in the same\nproximity to the car that he would have occupied if he had\nbeen ordered out.\nQUESTION: But is -- in other words, geography\nis part of the time dimension of recency.\nMR. GARRE: Well, and it is in a typical Belton\ncase. If I could give the Court an example. The Federal\nLaw Enforcement Training Center trains its officers that\nthey should stop their police car within two to four\nlengths of the vehicle that they're stopping and to pull\nthe person out of the car prior to the arrest.\nis -- this is the way officers are trained to bring them\nback because of the inordinate risks that officers face in\nthat situation.\nIn this case, Officer Nichols intended to pull\npetitioner over. That's at page 16 of the J.A., but he\ndidn't succeed in doing so because the petitioner pulled\ninto a parking lot. And that's not an uncommon practice\nthat -- that suspects do if they -- if they feel or sense\nthat they're under surveillance by the police. And he got\nout of his car, and the record shows at page 11 of the\nJ.A. that Officer Nichols got out at the same time and met\nhim within moments. This is -- this case we think has the\nhallmarks of the classic Belton encounter.\nOfficer Nichols patted him down, found drugs on\nhis person, and at that moment, placed him under arrest.\nThe -- the pat-down was a consensual search. That's -\nthat's indicated at page 19 of the joint appendix, and at\nthe moment that he placed petitioner under arrest who,\nafter all, was a convicted felon who just had drugs on his\nperson and who had a loaded semi-automatic gun --\nQUESTION: Why -- why does that matter? We\ndon't know that. The police don't know that. That\ndoesn't figure into any calculus. Most people who get out\nof cars are not convicted felons bearing drugs.\nMR. GARRE: That's absolutely correct, Justice\nSouter, and that's an important aspect of the\ngeneralization that the Court drew in Belton and -- and\nthat underlies the search incident to arrest cases which\nis --\nQUESTION: No, but the -- the point of Justice\nStevens' question is why should we go beyond -- strictly\nwhy should we go beyond the generalization in Belton? And\nthe reason certainly cannot be that this particular guy\nhad a record and had drugs.\nMR. GARRE: My -- my point, Justice Souter, was\nthat the officer safety justification for Belton is going\nto be squarely implicated regardless of the reason that\nthe person got -- got out of the car.\nQUESTION: No, but it seems to me that you get\ninto -- into deeper water if you say that because the -\nto me the incoherence of Belton is that it -- it purports\nto be an application of Chimel with a bright line, but at\nthe point at which the actual search is made, any danger\nto the officer is over. And so if -- if you're going to\ntry to justify a -- a more flexible approach to Belton on\ngrounds of the safety justification in Belton, I -- I\nthink you're -- you're out over your head.\nAnd -- and the force of Justice Stevens'\nquestion to me is this. Belton is not coherent with\nChimel. Belton does not stand up as an analysis of\nanything other than we're going to have a simple bright\nline rule for cars and stop all of this litigation. But\nif Belton gave a bright line rule for cars, why is there a\njustification for making it less bright by going beyond\nthe specific kinds of facts in Belton itself? That's the\nforce of the question.\nMR. GARRE: Sure. And -- and we don't think\nit's going to be any less bright in the most common\nsituation in which this question has arisen where police\ncome upon the person right as he's -- as he's exiting his\ncar.\nMichigan v. Long is another example. That case\nwas decided two terms after Belton. And in that case this\nCourt indicated in dictum that Belton would apply in the\nsituation where the police come upon the person after he's\noutside of the car.\nQUESTION: But is -- is your criterion then\ngoing to be a time criterion, the recency of his exit from\nthe car?\nMR. GARRE: It's -- it's going to have both -\nand the court of appeals emphasized it in this case at\npage 74 -\nQUESTION: Well, is it time or is it space?\nMR. GARRE: It's both space and time and it's\ngoing to encompass a situation where the person has just\ngotten out of the car -\nQUESTION: So if -- if I get out of my car and I\nrun as fast as I can run for 15 seconds, and I get across\nthe parking lot, that is very recent in time. Can -- can\nyou search my car then?\nMR. GARRE: Well, under the position that\npetitioner advances -\nQUESTION: No. I want your position. We want a\nbright line rule. If -- if I -- if I'm a sprinter and I\nget across the parking lot and it's 15 seconds, can they\nsearch the car?\nMR. GARRE: Justice Souter, as in the case of\nany Fourth Amendment case, there -- there are going to be\nsituations at the margin. I think if -- if the person is\nracing away from the -\nQUESTION: No, but bright line rules are -- are\nthere to -- to avoid marginal problems. What -- what's\nthe answer to my -- my question?\nMR. GARRE: If the hypothetical is the person\nsees the police officer and races away from the car, the\npolice officer arrests the person in the vicinity of the\ncar, then no, I don't think it matters if he got 15 feet\nor 20 feet or 30 feet. If he gets a block away, then\nsure, it might matter. These are cases at the outer\nextreme or margin and aren't implicated by the commonly\nrecurring fact pattern in which this case arises where the\npolice meet the person in the same spot that he would have\nbeen if he had been ordered out of the car.\nAnd -- and let me talk about the problems with\nline-drawing that the Court is going -\nQUESTION: What if he -- what if he didn't see\nthe police officer? He drives into the parking lot, gets\nout of his car, locks the car. He's 5 feet away and -\nand the police say, that's the guy I saw speeding on Main\nStreet 10 minutes ago. What's -- what's the answer there?\nMR. GARRE: Well -\nQUESTION: He's -- he is in the spot he would\nhave been if the police had arrested him or had\napprehended him in the car and told him to get out. Can\nthey search?\nMR. GARRE: Of course, there's something absent\nthere which is the positive linkage. The police don't\nknow that that person has just gotten out of the car.\nThat -- that case is a lot like the Frick case that the\nCourt noted in Belton as one of the cases that it was\ntrying to deal with when it came up.\nQUESTION: But if they see him -- if --\nMR. GARRE: I think the police -\nQUESTION: -- if they see him get out of the\ncar, can they then search in my hypo?\nMR. GARRE: I -- I think in that situation where\nthe person was arrested right by the car, we think that\nBelton probably would apply. But that's not the fact\npattern initiated here.\nIf -- if I could just talk about the line\ndrawing problems that the Court is going to invite if it\nadopts petitioner's initiation of contact rule.\nThe -- the petitioner said today that -- that\nthe rule the Court ought to adopt if the light is on, then\nBelton is -- is on. Well -- well, that's going to create\nline-drawing problems. To take an example close to home,\nthe -- the police officers in the District of Columbia\noften drive around with white flashing lights on. Now,\nI'm not sure how the existence of those white flashing\nlights would come into play under petitioner's initiation\nof contact rule.\nTake the case that the Court had before it this\nfall, Arizona v. Gant, which was a case that presented the\nsame issue, but the Court vacated and remanded it in light\nof the Arizona Supreme Court's decision which rejected the\ninitiation of contact rule. In that case, the officer\ncame upon the suspect and he shined a flight -- shined a\nflashlight into the car which the suspect was still inside\nthe car. The suspect got out of the car. The officer met\nhim moments later, and yet the court of appeals in that\ncase said that the police officer hadn't sufficiently\ninitiated contact with the suspect while he was still in\nthe car.\nQUESTION: The Arizona Court of Appeal.\nMR. GARRE: The Arizona Court of Appeals held in\nthat case. That's correct, Mr. Chief Justice.\nAnd -- and in describing that, the Court listed\nthe number of different factors that would have to go into\nthe calculus both from the standpoint of the officer on\nthe scene and from a court later reviewing that\ndetermination as to whether the officer initiated contact.\nHe'd have to take into account the lighting in the\nsituation, how far the officer was the car when he -- away\nfrom the car when he shined the flashlight into it,\nwhether the person saw the flashlight, whether the person\nthought it was a police officer shining the flashlight or\nsomeone else, whether the person was aware that there was\na police -\nQUESTION: Well, you said a little while ago\nthere are cases on the fringe. Of course, you can always\nfind one or two cases that present these difficult\nproblems.\nBut are -- are you really contending that the\nrule of initiating contact is less bright than the rule\nyou're proposing?\nMR. GARRE: Yes, we are. If -- if the Court\nfocuses -\nQUESTION: What if, for example, the -- the\nofficer saw a person speeding, he pulls into a gas\nstation, he gets out, goes to the men's room and comes\nback out. Can he be -- can you search his car?\nMR. GARRE: If -- of course, that's -- that's\nnot the fact pattern here.\nQUESTION: No. I'm just not -- I'm just\nwondering -\nMR. GARRE: Yes, I think he probably would be\nable -\nQUESTION: I'm wondering about the integrity of\nyour statement that there's a real bright line rule there.\nAnd what do you do with my case?\nMR. GARRE: In -- in that case where the\nperson -\nQUESTION: He's -- this -- the officer saw him\nspeeding but he didn't turn the light on. He followed\nhim. The guy goes into a gas station, goes to the men's\nroom, comes out 2 minutes later. Can you search his car?\nMR. GARRE: If the person comes out and is right\nnext to the car in the place he would have been when he\nhad been ordered out, yes, we think that -- that Belton\nwould apply in that situation.\nBut -- but the rule that we're asking the Court\nto adopt here is that on this fact pattern, which as the\ncourt of appeals we think correctly recognized has\ntemporal and spatial limits, where the police see the\nperson exit the car, confront him moments later, the\napplication of the bright line rule in Belton shouldn't\ndepend on the fortuity of whether the police initiate\ncontact with that person beforehand. And that's\nparticularly true in a case like this where Officer\nNichols intended to pull the car over and -- and yet\ndidn't do so because the suspect did what suspects\nsometimes do, which is to pull over and get out in order\nto try to blend in.\nThe -- now, going back to the officer safety\nrationale, we think that is a justification for Belton and\nthat it is implicated in this situation and that the\ninitiation of contact rule would implicate officer safety\nin a number of ways.\nOne is the surveillance situation that was\nmentioned during petitioner's argument and that the court\nof appeals mentioned in this case. In -- in some cases,\nofficers are engaged in surveillance activities and maybe\ndetermine that it's undesirable and unsafe to make contact\nwith a suspect while he's still inside the car and so take\nthe prudent step of waiting for the suspect to step out of\nthe car before confronting him. The -- the case out of\nVirginia, the Glasco case that's discussed in the brief,\nis an example of that.\nThere's -- there's also the -- the possibility,\nwhich is recognized in the case law, that an initiation of\nthe contact rule would have the effect of increasing the\nvolatility of Belton encounters by creating a dynamic in\nwhich suspects had an incentive to race out of the car\nbefore police could -- could initiate contact.\nQUESTION: If the -- if the suspect is\nhandcuffed and is in the police cruiser, is there any\ndanger to the officer at that point that can't be equally\navoided by simply having an inventory search later?\nMR. GARRE: There is danger, Justice Kennedy. I\nmean, first of all, on -- on the handcuff -\nQUESTION: Assume a single occupant.\nMR. GARRE: Right. There is danger. And we -\nwe -- and it's true in -- in a stop and arrest like this\ncase where there's a lone officer and a person who he\narrests. And the -- the deeply ingrained practice in this\ncountry is for the officer to put the -- the suspect,\narrestee, in the squad car and then go back and search the\ncar. And -- and we cite cases on page 38 of our brief\nwhere -- where suspects have escaped from handcuffs and\ngotten out. And -- and that danger is remote, but we\nthink that it's still real as long as the suspect is at\nthe scene of the arrest. All of the courts of appeals\nthat we're aware of that -- that have considered this\nquestion and Professor LaFave who's -- who's recognized\nand have concluded that Belton applies when the person is\nhandcuffed in the back seat of the squad car.\nAnd of course, Justice Brennan in his dissent in\nBelton recognized -\nQUESTION: I know it applies, but it's just not\nclear to me why an inventory search can never be, which -\nI have only one factual question here.\nWas this car locked before the police officer\nsearched it? Did he need the key or do -- do we know?\nMR. GARRE: The -- I believe the answer to that\nis -- is no because the record doesn't -- what the record\nshows -- and this is on page 50 of the J.A. I think -- is\nthat the officer arrested petitioner, put him in the car\nand then went back and searched the car. There's nothing\nin the record that suggests that the officer needed keys.\nBut -- but on the inventory search question,\nalthough it may be true in some cases that the inventory\nsearch inevitably would have led to the discovery of the\ncontraband, in that sense the privacy interests of the\nperson from a Belton search at the time are -- are further\ndiminished.\nThe inventory search I don't think is an answer\nto the officer's safety concerns and justification for\nBelton, which are real as long as the person is still at\nthe scene of the arrest. There is the remote risk that\nthe person can escape and try to get back into the car.\nThere's also the risk, as -- as you mentioned I think,\nthat there could be confederates in the area who might try\nto get into the car, either for a weapon or to get drugs\nout of the car or other contraband out of the car.\nOfficers in -- in the Belton stop, it's not uncommon for\nthem to -- to have the person out of the car, to secure\nhim, and then it's only at that point that they -- that\nthey feel safe to go back to make sure that there's no one\nelse in the car who could be hidden in the car or other\nthings in the car.\nSo I -- so we don't think that the inventory\nsearch is an answer to the very real concerns that the\nofficers face in conducting the Belton search and that\nprovide the rationale for the Belton search.\nI wanted to just go back briefly to the Court's\ndecision in Michigan v. Long. And although it is dictum\nin that case on the application of -- of Belton, we do\nthink that it's -- it's persuasive dictum. In that case\nthe police officers saw a car swerve off the road, and\nthey -- they came around back to investigate. The\npetitioner -- or -- or the suspect in that case, the\nindividual who was driving the car, was already outside of\nthe car when the police came back. And -- and the Court\nin that case made quite clear in dictum that if the -- if\nthe suspect in that case had been arrested, that the\nsearch of his car would have been perfectly lawful under\nBelton. And we think that that was -- that is a\npersuasive and a correct understanding of Belton.\nIf I could -- I wanted to make clear too that we\nthink that this case does bear the -- the hallmarks of a\nclassic Belton encounter. The only difference is -- is\nthat Officer Nichols did not succeed in initiating contact\nbefore the suspect got -- got out of the car, but Officer\n--\nQUESTION: Would he have to at least see the\nsuspect in the car or would it be all right under the rule\nyou're proposing where the police that come upon the scene\njust after the suspect exits from the car?\nMR. GARRE: Well, we think that the -- the most\nimportant thing for the Court to hold in this case -- that\nwe would ask the Court to hold in this case is in the\ncommonly recurring situation where police see the person\nexit the car and confront him moments later in the same\nvicinity that he might have occupied if he had been\nordered out of the car, that it doesn't make a difference\nfor the purposes of applying Belton as to whether or not\nthe police succeeded in initiating contact or succeeded in\ninitiating contact in a sufficient way.\nThere may be -- there are going to be other\ncases that arise, and -- and we don't think that this is\nan area in which the Court should try to establish a rule\nwhich is tethered to a particular distance or -- or a\nparticular amount of time. These are -- this is an\nextremely dangerous encounter for police. This is an area\nin which police need to make judgments. This Court\nrecognized in the Lago Vista case -\nQUESTION: It seems to me your argument is that\nwe don't want a bright line rule. We want a -- a facts\nand circumstances rule and take everything into account,\nwhich is sort of -- Justice Scalia often speaks of those\nrules with some disparaging terms.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. GARRE: No. That -- that's not what we're\nasking for, and I'm sorry if I -- if I misled the Court.\nWe're asking the Court to apply the generalization that it\nadopted in Belton.\nThe -- the reaching distance rule that\npetitioner has alternatively asked for would just\neviscerate Belton and put courts and police officers back\nin the situation that they occupied before Belton in\ntrying to apply Chimel in -- in the recurring and\ndangerous context of an automobile stop. The Court\nrecognized in Belton on page 59 of its decision that that\n-- the Chimel analysis had -- had provided to be -- shown\nto be unworkable in this context and -- and had created\nlitigation for the courts and uncertainty for the police\nofficers. So we're asking the Court to -- to stick to\nthat bright line.\nQUESTION: Justice Stewart wrote both Chimel and\nBelton, did he not?\nMR. GARRE: That's absolutely correct, Mr. Chief\nJustice.\nOn the handcuffing in the squad car, I -- I did\nwant to make clear on that point that that argument was\nnot raised by petitioner below, and -- and the court of\nappeals noted that at page 74, note 2 of the joint\nappendix. It's not pressed by petitioner in this Court.\nI think petitioner's reply brief makes that clear on page\n16.\nQUESTION: What do the police departments\nnormally tell the policemen? What do they say? They say,\nwhen you arrest a person who just got out of a car, you\ncan search the car?\nMR. GARRE: In terms of -- of -- I -- I can tell\nyou what the practice is at the Federal Law Enforcement\nTraining Center. And -- and that practice is you -- is -\nis to take the -- the person outside of the car,\nordinarily away from the car back towards the police -\nQUESTION: No. I'm not -- I'm not asking the\npractice. I'm asking -- the virtue of Belton is supposed\nto be it's simple. Explain it to a policeman. So I want\nto know how do they explain it. I thought perhaps they\nexplain it by saying, policeman, if you arrest a person\nwho's just got out of a car, you can search the car.\nMR. GARRE: That's -- that's correct, Justice\nBreyer.\nQUESTION: All right. Then if that's -- then\nthere has to be some kind of limit on just got out of.\nMR. GARRE: And -- and if it's -\nQUESTION: So -- so inevitably we're in the\nbusiness of trying to say what's just got out of. Is it a\nminute? Is it 2 minutes? Is it 5 minutes? There's no\nway to avoid that, is there?\nMR. GARRE: No. There's not at the outer\nmargins, but -- but the Court -\nQUESTION: All right. So what in your opinion\nis the outer margin?\nMR. GARRE: Well, let me -- let me say\naffirmatively that this case we think places a proper\ntemporal -\nQUESTION: This is well within it.\nMR. GARRE: -- and spatial limits on it where\nit's clear that the person -\nQUESTION: And you'd say certainly a day is too\nlong I imagine.\nMR. GARRE: Of course.\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. GARRE: That's correct.\nI think if the Court were to hold in this case\nthat Belton applies in this situation where the police\nconfront the person just after he gets out of the car,\nthat is going to provide a guidance to the police\nofficers. And that's going to tell them they don't need\nto undertake this additional fact-specific analysis as to\nwhether the person got out of the car of their own\nvolition or an initiation of contact.\nQUESTION: Then perhaps we could use words like\njust got out of.\nMR. GARRE: Or within moments. And -- and I\nthink -\nQUESTION: Seconds?\nMR. GARRE: Seconds would be fine. But -- but\nno.\nQUESTION: And what about in this --\nMR. GARRE: I don't --\nQUESTION: -- what about in this -- this is a\nserious question. What about if he's just about to get\ninto it?\nMR. GARRE: Well, and -- and that's -- that's a\ndifferent fact pattern that has arisen. We think Belton\nwould apply in that situation, and police we think have\nreasonably concluded that and courts have reasonably\nconcluded that.\nBut -- but that's not the question here. And\nthe most important question for the Court to answer, which\nis the situation where the police do see the person get\nout of the car and do confront him moments later.\nThe -- the States -- a number of States have\nfiled an amicus brief in this case supporting the\nGovernment's position and -- and urging against adoption\nof an initiation of contact rule. And -- and we do think\nit's significant that each of the States and jurisdictions\nthat have adopted the initiation of contact rule, States\nlike Florida and -- and Illinois and Michigan, have signed\nthat brief and urged the Court to reject the initiation of\ncontact rule. We think that that rule is unworkable.\nIt's shown to be unworkable in cases like Gant v. Arizona.\nThere are other cases in which added wrinkles\nhave been applied to the rule. There's a Florida case,\nwhich is not discussed in the briefs, but it is publicly\nreported. It's Kavallierakis v. State, 790 S.2d 1201. In\nthat case, the courts in Florida, applying the initiation\nof contact rule, concluded that in order to trigger\nBelton, the contact had to be of a confrontational nature\nand not of a friendly nature, so that in that case, the\ncourts reversed a conviction for possession of drugs found\nin a car because the police officer met the person with a\ngreeting while he was getting out of the car as opposed to\na confrontational signal such as a -- as a siren or a\nlight. Now, that -- that seems like an extreme\napplication of that rule, but it's nevertheless indicative\nof -- of the variations in the line-drawing that can arise\nand that have arisen.\nIn this case we think that the court of appeals\nproperly held that Belton apply. The record conclusively\nshows that petitioner was a recent occupant of the car and\nthe search was contemporaneous with the -- the arrest, and\nwe would ask the Court to affirm the judgment of the court\nof appeals.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Garre.\nMr. Dunham, you have 4 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF FRANK W. DUNHAM, JR.\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. DUNHAM: I have four brief points, Your\nHonor, that I'd like to make, if I could.\nThe first is that the State court opinion in\nMichigan v. Long, People v. -- People v. Long, shows that\nthe car there was being chased by the police. They just\nweren't observing him drive by at a high rate of speed and\ncrash into a ditch. They were in a high-speed chase, and\nit's reasonable to infer that they had their lights on and\ntherefore had initiated contact.\nFurthermore, the State court opinion in People\nv. Long shows that Long was in the vehicle when the\nofficers got out of their car, after he had crashed into\nthe ditch, and began to approach the vehicle. Then Long\nexited his vehicle and walked towards the officers. So I\ndon't think it's -- it's fair to say that there was no\ninitiation of contact by the officers with Long in the\nLong case and that the footnote in the Long opinion\nreferencing to Belton is no expansion or further\nbrightening of the Belton rule.\nSecond, I want to point out that the Frick case,\nwhich is the one possible exception that I think Justice\nStevens referred to when he was talking about the cases\nthat Belton points to as defining its class -- the man is\neither getting into or getting out of his vehicle. He has\nnot -- he has not achieved the status of pedestrian. Most\npeople -- I think you could still consider someone who was\nin the act of either getting in or getting out -- you\ncould call that person an occupant.\nThird, if you -- the Fourth Circuit did not\nadopt Mr. Garre's place where he would have occupied if he\nhad been arrested test. We call -- that's the\nGovernment's might have test. But Mr. Garre would add\nthat to what the Fourth Circuit rule and would have him -\nand -- and would add a limit that, oh, as long as he's\narrested where he might have been if he might have been\narrested, if we'd stopped him when he was getting out of\nhis car. It seems to me that that is an unworkable rule\nand it just adds further confusion to the situation. Yet,\nit's necessary, necessary because it's the only way you\navoid reversing Chimel.\nNow, the -- the other point I want to make is\nJustice O'Connor I think made a good point about the\ninventory search. Why can't we draw Belton narrowly\nbecause in 90 percent of the cases, we're going to have an\ninventory search anyway? And why can't we maintain some\nsemblance of Fourth Amendment protection in automobiles?\nAnd finally, with regard to the handcuffs point,\nMr. Garre's point that people sometimes get out of their\nhandcuffs, I'd simply like to say if we indulge in the\npresumption that suspects are going to get out of their\nhandcuffs, there's simply no search incident to arrest\nrule that we can fashion that doesn't just have us\nsearching everyplace on God's green earth.\nQUESTION: May I ask you a question -\nMR. DUNHAM: Yes.\nQUESTION: -- if your time is up? In your\nexperience, does an inventory search include the right to\nsearch containers in the -- in the car? Belton, of\ncourse, gives the -- the Government the big advantage.\nYou can search every container in the car.\nMR. DUNHAM: I believe an inventory search does\nnot allow you to search opaque containers within the car.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr. Dunham.\n"
