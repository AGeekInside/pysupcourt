ROBERTS, JR.\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and\nmay it please the Court:\nIn 1974, when it enacted the Family Educational\nRights and Privacy Act, Congress conditioned Federal\nfunding for educational institutions on the institution\nnot having a policy or practice of releasing student\nrecords without consent. Congress did not phrase this\ncondition in terms of individual rights. It did not, for\nexample, follow the model of title IX, enacted 2 years\nearlier and also dealing with educational institutions,\nand say something like, no student at a school receiving\nFederal funds shall have his records released without his\nconsent. Instead, Congress proceeded more indirectly. It\nsaid that no funds shall be made available to any\ninstitution having a policy or practice of releasing\nstudent records without consent.\nThe statute is directed to the Secretary of\nEducation. He's the one who makes Federal funds\navailable, not to the institution receiving the funds, and\ncertainly not to the individual student. This Court's\ncases establish that that is a distinction that makes a\ndifference. In Cannon, for example, the Court said there\nwould be far less reason --\nQUESTION: Mr. Roberts, isn't it primarily a\ndistinction that makes a difference in connection with\nwhether there's an implied cause of action, rather than\nwhether 1983 authorized a cause of action?\nMR. ROBERTS: In the implied right of action\nquestion there are two questions, did Congress intend to\ncreate a right, and did Congress intend to provide a\njudicial remedy? In the 1983 context, there are two\nquestions, did Congress intend to create a right, and did\nCongress intend to preclude resort to the 1983 remedy, so\nthat first question I think is the same under both\ncategories of cases, and as the Court said in Cannon, if\nCongress phrases the statute as -- quote, as a prohibition\non the disbursement of public funds, there's far less\nreason to think that they intended a private remedy.\nIn addition, purpose speaks in terms of an\ninstitutional policy or practice, not individual instances\nof disclosures. Again, the contrast with a rights-\ncreating provision like title IX is stark. Title IX says,\nno student shall be subject to discrimination, but FERPA\ndoesn't look at what happens to individual students. It\nlooks at institutional behavior, institutional policy or\npractice.\nQUESTION: The statute does talk about rights of\nstudents and rights of parents. It's, of course, as you\nsay, preceded by the mandate that there shall be no\npolicy, but in this regard it seems to me to be at least\nmore specific than -- with references to rights than some\nof the other funding statutes we've looked at.\nMR. ROBERTS: Well, of course, the word rights\ndoes not appear in the disclosure provision, subsection\n(b), and in Pennhurst, where the Court was dealing with\ndevelopmentally disabled bill of rights, the Court\nexplained that just because the statute uses the word\nrights doesn't mean that it creates a 1983 right.\nQUESTION: Yes, I recognize in the one section\nthat we're talking about here you have a stronger argument\nthan the other, but if we assume for the moment would have\na 1983 cause of action under the whole act without going\ndown provision by provision, then I do think you have to\nrecognize that the act does talk about rights of students,\nrights of parents to look at files, et cetera.\nMR. ROBERTS: Well, first of all, the Court in\nBlessing said that you don't look at the whole act. You\nhave to look at the particular provision that is relied\nupon to create the 1983 right.\nSecond of all, we're 6 years before Maine v.\nThiboutot when Congress passed this, so it's not as if\nthey're using rights as some term of art under the\nestablished jurisprudence, and finally, I think Congress\ncan use the term to refer to the opportunity of parents\nand students to participate in the administrative remedy,\nto the criteria that the Secretary of Education is to use\nin deciding whether to terminate funds, without thereby\nnecessarily triggering coverage under section 1982.\nQUESTION: Well, I think it's that latter\nrationale that might be stronger for your case. I'll be\nsomewhat reluctant to parse through this statute and say\nthere's no right under (b), there is a right under (e), et\ncetera.\nMR. ROBERTS: Well, whatever rights, whether\nyou're talking -- putting aside the question whether it's\na 1983 right or a right to participate in the process\nthat's established under the statute, it is part of the\npolicy or practice that the Secretary of Education is to\nlook to in deciding whether to disburse funds. The\nobligation is to the Secretary, not to the institution,\nand that is made clear when you look at what Congress said\nabout enforcement.\nThe Congress said, the Secretary shall enforce\nFERPA, and the Secretary shall deal with violations. Now,\nthat deal-with-violations language should strike the Court\nas unusual and, in fact, nowhere else in the United States\nCode does Congress tell an agency to deal with violations.\nIt has almost a colloquial tone to it. Mr. Secretary,\nFERPA is your problem, you deal with the violations.\nThere's no suggestion that they would be dealt with by\nprivate actions brought in court and, in fact, that\nconclusion is reinforced when you look at subsection (g),\nwhich tells the Secretary, you set up an office to deal --\nQUESTION: Whereabouts is this, Mr. Roberts?\nMR. ROBERTS: 12a of our statutory appendix,\nYour Honor.\nQUESTION: Thank you.\nMR. ROBERTS: It says to the Secretary, you set\nup an office to investigate, process, review, and\nadjudicate complaints about violations under FERPA. I\nthink this is something --\nQUESTION: You say violations of this section.\nYou tell us that there's no violation of this section\nunless there's a policy, right?\nMR. ROBERTS: There's no violation unless\nthere's a policy.\nQUESTION: So he doesn't have to investigate any\nindividual complaint, unless the person comes in and says,\nnot only do they do it to me, but this is their policy,\nright?\nMR. ROBERTS: It's evidence that there might be\na problem with the school's policy, and this is what makes\nit different, for example, from the Wright case. In\nWright, the Court said, look, all you can do is terminate\nfunding. There's no process to bring complaints to the\nattention of the Secretary. That's not enough.\nHere, Congress said to the Secretary, you set up\na complaint procedure, and if someone's got a problem with\nthe release of their records you investigate it, you\nprocess the complaint, you review it, and you adjudicate\nit, and what has happened is that complaints have come in,\nand the Family Policy Compliance Office have gotten\nresponses from the university, and voluntary compliance\nhas ensured that the policy and practice of the\ninstitution complies with the Secretary's view.\nQUESTION: I guess that that's all that the\nplaintiff could accomplish in court anyway. The\nplaintiffs here don't contend that they would be entitled\nto recovery if there is no policy or practice.\nMR. ROBERTS: That's correct. That's correct.\nQUESTION: So the Secretary's enforcement\nauthority is coextensive with what the court did.\nMR. ROBERTS: In terms of the scope of\nliability --\nQUESTION: You'd need an allegation of a policy\nor practice.\nMR. ROBERTS: Exactly, but it is the fact that\nCongress focused on the policy or practice that helps\nestablish that they were not concerned with individual\ninstances of disclosure. It is odd to speak of a\ndistinctly individual right being protected when whether\nit's protected or not depends on whether the school does\nthe same thing to others. That looks more like a systemic\nconcern, not an individual concern, and it's the --\nQUESTION: Well, Mr. Roberts, why are they\nmutually exclusive? The Secretary has this authority, and\nI think your argument would be more impressive if this\nwere a large operation. On the one hand you say, the\ncourts, that the institutions will be harassed by all\nthese lawsuits across the country, and yet this one agency\nthat you are saying will take care of it, this centralized\nadministration, we're told that as of 2000 it had all of\nseven staff members in that entire office, hardly a number\nthat is likely to be able to handle a lot of complaints.\nMR. ROBERTS: It's very important to keep in\nmind the distinction between how matters are handled\nbefore the Family Policy Compliance Office and in court.\nFERPA places a premium on voluntary compliance, on\ninformal and inexpensive adjudication. A 1983 damages\naction in Federal court doesn't. The statute says the\nSecretary shall deal with violations, not the court. The\nSecretary says -- and the statute goes on to say, we're\ngoing to tell you how to deal with individual\ncomplainants. They don't go to court, either. They go to\nthe office that's set up by the Secretary, and there they\nwill find an informal, inexpensive procedure in which\npeople can quickly find out what the school's answer is\nand, in a case in which it suggests that there's a policy\nor practice problem, secure voluntary problem.\nQUESTION: Do we know from the -- maybe the\nSolicitor General can tell us -- if the seven people are\noverworked?\nMR. ROBERTS: In fact, in practice most of what\nthey do is field questions from the school, how do we\nhandle this situation, what do we do about this?\nQUESTION: But how do you get a stop order? One\nof the points that were made is that if records are about\nto be divulged to, say, a newspaper, and the student or\nthe parent wants an immediate stop order, you can go into\ncourt and get a TRO. There's nothing comparable in the\nSecretary's arsenal that has that kind of muscle behind\nit, is there?\nMR. ROBERTS: There certainly is. The first\nthing, if you're a student subjected to that, what you\nwould do is call the Family Policy Compliance Office and\nthe Secretary, keep in mind, has the cudgel of terminating\nfunding behind the most informal telephone call or\ncorrespondence. Schools respond to what the Secretary of\nEducation tells them to do with respect to FERPA, because\nthey appreciate the sanctions that can be brought. That's\nthe way the system has worked effectively since FERPA was\nenacted.\nQUESTION: This office can't really give relief\nto any individual, however, right, except to tell the\nschool not to release, wrongfully release records in the\nfuture, right?\nMR. ROBERTS: The focus of the office is in\nvindicating what the statute provides. The statute is\ndirected to institutional behavior. The office reviews\ncomplaints in order to secure compliance with the proper\npolicy or practice.\nQUESTION: So all --\nMR. ROBERTS: It is -- it is --\nQUESTION: All you have to do is eliminate the\npolicy, and everything that's happened in the past is\nwater over the dam --\nMR. ROBERTS: Because --\nQUESTION: -- and go and sin no more is what the\nSecretary says, right?\nMR. ROBERTS: Because the statute is directed to\nprospective compliance, not retrospective compensation for\ninjuries. That is a different focus than section 1983.\nThe 1983 --\nQUESTION: What do you do about the language\nwhere it says, no funds shall be made available to a\nschool that effectively prevent, et cetera, the student --\nit says, of the right to inspect. It says of the right to\ninspect right in the first sentence, and then later on it\nsays in (b) no -- or later on it says that you have to\ntell the parent in (e) of the rights accorded them by\nthis. I mean, that's the same question, but I want to\nget -- that others have asked, but I want to have very\nclear in my mind the specific answer. It says, we won't\ngive you any money if you interfere with the right.\nNow, that sounds as if there's a right, and then\nthey underline it by saying, and you have to tell them\nabout the right, and what's -- your direct response to\nthat is what?\nMR. ROBERTS: The direct response is that -- you\nleft out words in the quote, which is that no funds shall\nbe made available to an institution that has a policy or\npractice, and the question is, is Congress focusing on\nprotecting individual rights in, as the Court said in\nBlessing, an individual way, or are they addressing a\nsystemic concern. The policy, or the focus on the\nSecretary -- this statute is directed to the Secretary.\nDon't make funds available, and it says, look at the\npolicy or practice. It's not written the way title IX is,\nwhich would suggest the conferring of an individual right.\nSecondly, you're quoting from subsection (a).\nSubsection (b) does not talk about rights.\nAnd finally, the answer --\nQUESTION: Well, but Mr. Roberts, let me just be\nsure I understand your answer. I have the same problem\nJustice Breyer does, because in 1232g(1)(B) on page 2a,\nno funds and so forth shall be made available if the\nagency has a policy of denying or effectively prevents the\nparents of students the right to inspect. Now, is the\nright to inspect a Federal right?\nMR. ROBERTS: I think not, because --\nQUESTION: What is its source?\nMR. ROBERTS: The right to inspect is not an\nindependent and freestanding right. It is a description\nof the sort of policy or practice that should prompt the\nSecretary of Education to withhold funds. In addition,\nthis is not the provision that's at issue in this case.\nSubsection (b) --\nQUESTION: Well, I understand, but your initial\nsubmission is that this is not a rights-creating statute,\nit just -- but I don't know where the right comes from\nthat they refer to in that section and also in -- on 12a\ninforming parents and students of rights under this\nsection.\nMR. ROBERTS: Under this section. I think\nCongress can use the term, rights, to refer to the\nopportunities that are provided to the parents and\nstudents and to the criteria that the Secretary of\nEducation will look to in deciding funding, without\nthereby triggering coverage under section 1983.\nJust like in Pennhurst, Congress used the word\nrights repeatedly in --\nQUESTION: But do you think that they would have\nhad the rights described herein even if this statute had\nnot been passed?\nMR. ROBERTS: No. There would not have been --\nno rights are conferred under this statute. What is\nconferred is discretion on the Secretary of Education to\nwithhold funds depending upon a policy or practice. In\ndescribing the policy or practice that should trigger\naction by the Secretary of Education, the statute refers\nto opportunities that must be provided to parents and\nstudents by that institution, but in doing so I don't\nthink Congress is necessarily triggering the right to a\ndamages action.\nQUESTION: You use the word opportunity in the\nstatute wherever the statute used the word rights.\nMR. ROBERTS: Well, the statute doesn't use the\nwords right under subsection (b). The statute in\nPennhurst was called the Bill of Rights, and this Court\nconcluded that that did not confer rights. The question\nis whether Congress acted in a way that indicated an\nintent to confer an individually enforceable right.\nQUESTION: Mr. Roberts, you said that 1232g(b)\nis not the section at issue here.\nMR. ROBERTS: No --\nQUESTION: What section is the one at issue?\nMR. ROBERTS: 1232g(b) is the section at issue.\nJustice Stevens and Justice Breyer were quoting from\n1232g(a). (a) refers to rights, (b) does not.\nQUESTION: Well, but (b) does say, the parents\nof students the right to inspect and review.\nMR. ROBERTS: That's (a), Your Honor. That's\n1232g(a)(1)(A).\nQUESTION: (b) is on 6a, I gather is what\nyou're --\nQUESTION: Oh, (b) is on --\nMR. ROBERTS: (b) is on 6a, and it does not\nrefer to rights.\nQUESTION: Okay. Thank you.\nMR. ROBERTS: Thank you, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Ms. Millett, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF PATRICIA A. MILLETT\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,\nSUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS\nMS. MILLETT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nIf I could begin by responding to Justice\nKennedy's question about whether the Family Policy\nCompliance Office is overworked, I will tell you that they\ndo work very hard, but they handle -- for a small staff,\nthey handle an amazing amount of work, and have been doing\nso for 28 years under this statute. They handle over 900\npieces of correspondence a year, up to -- close to 100 of\nthings that are formally categorized as complaints as they\ngo through the investigation stages.\nQUESTION: Three letters a day, I guess.\nMS. MILLETT: Hmm?\nQUESTION: That's three letters a day.\nMS. MILLETT: Yes, but they also -- I'm not done\nwith my -- forgive me.\n(Laughter.)\nMS. MILLETT: They have about 300 phone calls a\nmonth, and well over 1,000 e-mails a year to --\nQUESTION: That's 10 phone calls a day.\n(Laughter.)\nMS. MILLETT: That's right, and well over 1,000\ne-mails, and I think one of the reasons that there\nisn't -- I mean, if you look at the legal landscape out\nthere, too, there hasn't been an enormous volume of 1983\nactions, and that is because the Secretary has been very\nsuccessful, I think, in communicating and enforcing this\nin an informal manner with the universities. The\nuniversities wish to comply with this, and a lot of it\nis -- we've had 28 years now to explicate what this\nstatute means and to clarify what it means.\nNow, I fear that may change if this Court were\nto recognize a 1983 action --\nQUESTION: What is your opinion about the idea\nthat this could be bifurcated, that it orders a right to\ninspect, that isn't going to be too tough, you let the\nperson look at the record, but there's a policy of\ndisclosure. Does that make sense in terms of the statute\nto say there's a private right under (a) but not under\n(b)? What's your opinion of that?\nMS. MILLETT: Okay, I'll answer that in two\nstages. It makes sense to bifurcate analysis as a matter\nof this Court's 1983 precedents, and specifically that's\nexactly what the Court did in the Blessing case, which is\nyour most recent case up here.\nAs a whole, we don't think it actually makes\nsense to do so under this statute. The Court may not\ndecide that today because the only provision at issue is\nsubsection (b), which does not refer to rights and focuses\non policies or practices, but our position is that there\nare three mutually reinforcing features here, both in (a)\nand (b), that show there is not a right under 1983, and\nthat is -- even under (a), the very beginning of the\nsentence, and the operative command is that no funds shall\nbe distributed, or shall be distributed by the Secretary\nof Education, and that is distinctive, unique language\nthat this Court recognized, suggested in Cannon, and held\njust last term in Sandoval. It's not the type of language\nCongress would use to create individual rights and in\nparticular, in 1974, 2 years after title IX was enacted,\nCongress chose different, distinctly different language\nthat is very uncommon in the U.S. Code.\nQUESTION: If you go through the first three\nfactors listed in Blessing, Congress intended to benefit\nthe plaintiff, and it not be beyond judicial competence --\nMS. MILLETT: Not not be --\nQUESTION: -- and there must be an unambiguously\nbinding obligation on the State, it would seem to me that\nthose are met here, and that you then have to go to the\nnext part of the test which is -- that creates a\npresumption that there is a right.\nMS. MILLETT: Well, as we said in our brief, we\nthink that the problem here is not that it's vague or\namorphous, and it's not that there's not binding\nobligations, which is the second two prongs of the\nBlessing test, but the first prong of the Blessing test,\nwhile phrased in terms of benefiting individuals, the\nCourt made clear in Blessing it's not just a general\ninquiry if it's of some good to people, because all\nlegislation is of some good to somebody. It is whether it\ncreates individual entitlements, and that's where we think\nthis statute fails, a statute that --\nQUESTION: Well, with reference to the other\nparts, the non-(b) parts of the statute, it does seem to\nme that it talks about the student and the parent in very\nspecific terms, and it uses the term, rights.\nMS. MILLETT: Well, again, this Court made clear\nin Pennhurst that you can't just look at the word right in\nisolation. You have to put it in context, and there are\nsome important contexts I would like to stress, again even\nup through subsection (a). The right begins with -- it\nbegins with the no-funds command. The focus is on a\npolicy, system-wide basis, and even when it talks about\nrights, it's not an individual right, it is the -- the\neducation records of the children -- I'm sorry, I'm\nreading from -- this is my appendix. I hate to confuse the\nCourt, to my brief, at 1a, where subsection (a) is, and\nthere has to be a policy of denying or effectively\npreventing the parents of students, plural, access to\nthese records, so we think that makes clear that you have\nthe same programmatic, system-wide rule here, and in fact\nthe Secretary's position is that if you had one instance\nof a failure to allow someone access to records during\nnonpolicy or nonprogram-wide failure to allow access to\nrecords, that would not violate FERPA. The command is\nstill -- it's written differently. I mean, the statute\nwas put on, was enacted on the floor of Congress. It\ndidn't have long hearings where people sort of labored and\nstruggled over precise language, but it contains --\nQUESTION: May I ask you -- it's really the same\nquestion I asked Mr. Roberts, I suppose, but the first\nsentence of 1232g(a)(1)(A) refers to a policy of denying\naccess, denying the right to inspect and review education\nrecords. In your view, is that right a federally created\nright, or is that a right created by some other source\nand, if so, what is the source of the right?\nMS. MILLETT: I'm sorry, I'm having -- there\nwere too many numbers in that. g(1) --\nQUESTION: it's the first sentence of 1232g on\npage 2a of the blue brief, and the first, very first\nsentence in the statute ends by saying the right to\ninspect and review the education records of their\nchildren, and my question is whether you think that is a\nfederally created right and, if not, what is the source of\nthat right?\nMS. MILLETT: I think it's not -- I have two\nanswers. First of all, whatever it is, it's a collective,\nprogram-wide, aggregated right, because it speaks in the\nplural, but secondly it;'s not -- I think it is used as\nMr. Roberts said here in a shorthand way, and the\nlegislative history says that one of the things they were\ntrying to enforce here is what Congress considered to be\npre-existing moral or legal --\nQUESTION: Let me be sure you have my question\nin mind. Do you think the right to which the statute\nrefers is a federally created right, or right with a\ndifferent source?\nMS. MILLETT: I think what the statute is\ncreating there is a Federal overlay to protect pre -- as\nwas said in the legislative history on page 17 of our\nbrief, preexisting legal or moral right.\nQUESTION: So that if a school came back and\nsaid, in our State there's no such right, then the statute\nwould not apply?\nMS. MILLETT: Congress felt that when it said\npreexisting moral or legal rights, there was a sense of\nCongress that this is a type of, not in a bright sense\nthat we use for purposes of 1983 actions, but the\nlegislative history was that Congress had a sense here\nthat this was something all individuals should have. But\nthis --\nQUESTION: It is something they should have by\nreason of this statute, and therefore it's created, or by\nsome preexisting rule of law in some -- at some other\nsource?\nMS. MILLETT: Well, Congress' language was\npreexisting moral or legal rights, and so I'm not sure\nwhat one considers --\nQUESTION: If it's another source, it seems to\nme that the State or the institution could say, in this\nlocality there is no such right, and that would make the\nstatute totally inapplicable.\nMS. MILLETT: No, it wouldn't, because what you\nstill have is, once you take these funds you have a\nFederal overlay. Once you decide to take these funds your\nprior law doesn't matter, which you have --\nQUESTION: It's a Federal overlay on a\nnonexistent right, if I understand you correctly.\nMS. MILLETT: Well, there's a -- there is --\nthere's no doubt that there's a Federal level of\nprotection here for privacy, and it's at an aggregated,\ncollective system-wide level. It's not at the individual\nlevel of --\nQUESTION: But you use the word overlay,\nMr. Roberts used the word obligation, you stay away from\nthe term, right, in the statute. If we followed Justice\nStevens' line of questions and concluded that there is a\nFederal right, would you necessarily -- would your\nposition -- would that be fatal to your position, or would\nyou say it's a right that can be enforced through a\ncomprehensive administrative scheme?\nMS. MILLETT: In two ways it wouldn't. It's not\nat issue in this case, and the second argument is that the\nnature of the -- whatever the nature of the right is\nthat's created here, Congress has created the very type of\nscheme that it thinks is appropriate to enforce these\ncollective, aggregated, system-wide rights that it created\nhere, that in fact --\nQUESTION: Well, are you in effect saying, as\nMr. Roberts did, I think when he used the word,\nopportunity, that this is kind of, that the scheme of this\nsection is sort of an if-then sort of scheme. If you deny\nthem the opportunity then -- and you do so on a systemic\nbasis, then the Secretary will take, or should take\ncertain action. Is that -- you are saying essentially the\nsame thing that he did.\nMS. MILLETT: Yes.\nQUESTION: So when you say there's a Federal\nright, you really mean there's an opportunity. If the\nopportunity is denied, then certain administrative action\ncan be taken.\nMS. MILLETT: That's right. There's a Federal\nobligation -- to use Mr. Roberts' words, a Federal\nobligation, once you take these funds, to not have system-\nwide practices or policies that either deny access or, in\nthis case, disclose without consent, or an authorized\nbasis for disclosure, and I think it's very -- again, very\nunique language. You have -- you didn't have to look at\nthe two separately, but when you combined the no-funds\nlanguage and the focus on system-wide policies and\npractices, that this Court made clear in Blessing that\ntype of aggregate language doesn't create individual\nlights -- rights, excuse me, and then you marry to that\nthe fact that Congress has enacted an administrative\nscheme that is directly responsive to that type of system-\nwide overlay, there should not --\nQUESTION: Thank you, Ms. Millett.\nMS. MILLETT: thank you.\nQUESTION: Ms. Brinkmann, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF BETH S. BRINKMANN\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMS. BRINKMANN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nIn FERPA, Congress gave parents the right to\nprevent the release of certain educational records.\nThat's evident from Congress' choice of words and the\nstructure and history of the statute. There are at least\nfive indications of that intent, including references to\nrights under that provision, which I'll get to in a\nmoment. It involves reading two sections together.\nFirst, in section -- this is on page 9a of the\nred brief, at the very top. In 1232g(b)(2)(A), at the top\nof page 9a, Congress prohibited a recipient from having a\npolicy of releasing education records, quote, unless there\nis written consent from the students' parents. Congress\ndid not say, unless there is a policy of obtaining written\nconsent. Congress thereby --\nQUESTION: Now, you're reading from 9a, Ms.\nBrinkmann? Whereabouts on page 9a?\nMS. BRINKMANN: At the very top, Your Honor,\nparagraph 2 begins that no fund shall be given to an\nagency, and explains that has a policy or --\nQUESTION: -- see it either. I'm looking at\npage --\nQUESTION: I think she said red brief.\nQUESTION: 9a of the red brief.\nMS. BRINKMANN: It's on page 8a of the --\nQUESTION: You're switching briefs on us.\nMS. BRINKMANN: I'm sorry.\n(Laughter.)\nMS. BRINKMANN: It's on page 8a of the blue\nbrief, if you prefer that. The problem is, there are\nother provisions in here I need to refer to. At the very\ntop of the page, it explains that no funds shall go to a\nschool that has a policy of releasing information, and at\nthe end of that first paragraph, quote, unless, and then\nwe go to subparagraph (A), there is written consent from\nthe students' parents.\nCongress did not say, unless the school has a\npolicy of obtaining consent.\nQUESTION: Yes, it does. It says no money will\ngo to an educational agency or institution which has a\npolicy or practice.\nMS. BRINKMANN: Unless.\nQUESTION: Unless.\nMS. BRINKMANN: Yes.\nQUESTION: Now, if you don't have a policy or\npractice, the whole provision doesn't apply.\nMS. BRINKMANN: If you don't have a policy or\npractice of releasing information other than under the\npreceding (b)(1), you're correct, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: The whole thing wouldn't apply, so I\ndon't --\nMS. BRINKMANN: And (b)(2)(A) is -- (b)(1) says\nyou can't -- a school can't have a policy of releasing\nwithout consent, other than to certain categories.\nQUESTION: It's a question of whether you read\nthe word policy, what policy? I think Justice Scalia is\nreading it as, what policy?\nMS. BRINKMANN: It's a policy --\nQUESTION: A policy of releasing records without\nwritten consent.\nMS. BRINKMANN: That's not what not -- that's\nnot what (b)(2)(A) says. That language is not -- that is,\nthe without consent is in (b)(1). It's not in (b)(2). It\nsays, has a policy or practice of releasing or providing\naccess to any personally identifiable information, other\nthan direct information, or is permitted under paragraph\n(1). That's what paragraph (1) does. It permits a\nlaundry list of releases where Congress said, we're not\ngoing to require parental consent.\nSchool educators need this information. (b)(1),\nno problem, you get all of this information without\nparental consent. Other than in those situations, if you\nhave policy or practice, then the school decides --\nQUESTION: I'm really not following you. What\ndo you think the unless goes to? I take it that the\nunless goes to, no funds shall be made available.\nMS. BRINKMANN: Yes.\nQUESTION: Unless.\nMS. BRINKMANN: Yes.\nQUESTION: Okay.\nMS. BRINKMANN: So --\nQUESTION: But that whole provision, no funds\nshall be made available, only applies to an educational\nagency or institution which has a policy or practice of\nreleasing.\nMS. BRINKMANN: Absolutely.\nQUESTION: If it doesn't have a policy or\npractice of releasing, it's entirely exempt from that\nprovision.\nMS. BRINKMANN: That's correct, Your Honor,\nbecause they did not -- Congress did not intend to go\nafter inadvertent releases.\nFor example, the school makes a decision if they\nare going to have a policy of releasing information to a\nscholarship program, or to the press, and if they have a\npolicy release, they have to abide by this very specific\nrequirement in (b)(2)(A).\nQUESTION: Well --\nMS. BRINKMANN: They may choose not to. It's\nparallel to the directory information provision in the\nstatute.\nCongress also said, you, school, can make a\nchoice. If you want to release things like names,\nclasses, awards receipts under the directory information\nprovision, you can make that decision. You have to give\nnotice at the beginning of the year, and you have to give\nparents enough time to respond whether or not they want to\nopt out of that.\nSame thing under (b)(2)(A). If you as a\nuniversity decide that you want to have a policy or\npractice of releasing things beyond what is already\nauthorized under (b)(1), which includes other teachers,\nemergency situations, Federal officials, all kinds of\nsituations, then you have to abide by (b)(2)(A), and you\ncannot have that policy or practice unless there is\nwritten consent from the students' parents.\nQUESTION: But it appears to be a scheme, at\nleast as I read it, just directed at when Federal funds\nare going to be given to a school, and you determine that\nby whether the school has a particular policy or practice,\nand the remedy is withholding funds. I don't see how you\nextrapolate from this statute the intent to create a\nprivate cause of action for damages.\nMS. BRINKMANN: Your Honor, in addition to the\nlanguage, unless there is, our position is, because there\nis that requirement, unless there is written consent from\nthe parent, Congress intended to directly benefit the\nparents and to say to the parents in a particular\nsituation, you can say no, I don't want this information\nreleased. Parents may have different decisions based on\nwhether or not they think it will benefit the child.\nQUESTION: But they can't do that, because I\nmean, if the information is released and the parent says,\nI object, the institution can say, oh, I'm sorry, that was\njust a mistake. We don't have that policy. You know, we\nreleased it. Too bad. We don't have the policy. So\nthere is no absolute right on the part of the parent to\nprevent it.\nMS. BRINKMANN: There is, Your Honor, because\nthe -- if they do have a policy and practice, it's akin to\nthe standard that the Court adopted in Gebser, and here\nCongress did that. They said, we are not going to charge\nevery institution with inadvertent release, but to the\nextent, as under Monell, if there is requisite knowledge\nby the school that they have a policy or practice, they're\nintending to be releasing information, they are charged\nwith getting the consent from the parents, and again I\nhave to --\nQUESTION: The consequence, if they don't get\nconsent from the parents, the express consequence is no\nfunds shall be made available.\nMS. BRINKMANN: Which is the commonality in all\nof the Spending Clause cases that have come before the\nCourt, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Ms. Brinkmann, but not the emphasis,\nas was pointed out by Mr. Roberts. Title IX, title VI\nsay, no person shall be, and this starts out with no\nfunds. Do you have any statutes, any spending statutes\nthat uses the no funds shall, instead of no person shall\nbe denied, where this Court has either implied a private\nright of action, or has found a right which 1983 can then\nbe used to enforce?\nMS. BRINKMANN: Well, Your Honor, there's never\nbeen a formula. None of the statutes where the Court has\nfound a right has included that language, Wright, Wilde,\nor Blessing, none of them have the language the petitioner\nand the Solicitor General now urges.\nIn fact, in footnote 12 of the Suter opinion the\nCourt contrasted the language where they were not finding\na right to a statute that, quote, said, no Federal payment\nmay be made under this part, and they said, now, there's a\nspecific requirement, so there's no formula. None of the\ncourts have had this language that they're now urging.\nThe Suter opinion refers to this type of language as being\nmore specific, and it doesn't as a practical matter make\nany difference what these Spending Clause statutes do say.\nIf you receive Federal funds, you have to abide by these\nconditions.\nQUESTION: I'm not sure that I gave you my\nquestion precisely. There are title VI, title IX,\nstatutes that use the formula, no person shall, and under\nthose statutes a right of action has been implied, and\nwhat I'm asking is, is there any statute with the\nlanguage, no funds shall, where a right of action has been\nimplied?\nMS. BRINKMANN: No statute of that language has\never come before the Court, Your Honor, and all I'm saying\nis, there are many other cases in which statutes have been\nfound to accord rights under section 1983 that don't have\nthat no-student-shall language.\nQUESTION: What about -- you say, you agree\nthere is no example of a case we've decided where the term\nis no funds shall?\nMS. BRINKMANN: That statute has not come before\nthe Court. I have to say in the title IX and title VI\ncontext, it was a broader inquiry of whether or not there\nwas implied cause of action, but in Your Honor's opinion,\nin Suter, in footnote 12, it does refer to this type of\nstatute and suggests that that is a direct requirement.\nQUESTION: If I may --\nQUESTION: Well, where is the statute -- the\nfootnote you're quoting speaks in terms of, or addresses\nthe no funds shall?\nMS. BRINKMANN: The precise language in that\nstatute which is quoted in that footnote says that no\nFederal funds payments shall be made, Your Honor. It's on\npage 361 of the opinion, and it's citing 42 U.S.C. 672(e)\nthat says, quote, for example, no Federal payment may be\nmade under this part, and then it goes on and it says that\nthat is an example of more precise requirements as\ncontrasted to the statute in Suter.\nIf I may, there are four other provisions I'd\nlike to speak to in addition to the language, unless there\nis. In addition, again on page 9a under (b)(2)(A), it's\nnot just unless there is written consent. That consent\nhas to have included a provision of a copy of what is\nintended to be released by the school to the parents. The\nparents have to be told why the information is being\nreleased, and the parents have to know to whom it is being\nreleased. That is exactly what the Court referenced in\nBlessing about Congress addressing the particular need of\nthe individuals who they're according the rights to.\nThey knew that parents were going to be able to\nneed to know why the information was provided, exactly\nwhat it is, and to whom. Parents may think it's fine to\nrelease financial information, personal information about\ntheir household for a scholarship or an honorary award\npurpose, but not, for example, to a newspaper story about\nlow income families in the school district.\nThird, the history of the -- before I go to the\nhistory, actually, I want to explain another provision of\nthe statute which I think --\nQUESTION: Two more. You have two more coming.\nYou said you had four.\nMS. BRINKMANN: Yes. Yes. Actually, I'm going\nto jump in, though, because this responds to questions of\nthe Court about the use of the word, right. If you could\nturn to page 12a in the red brief, subsection (d),\n1232g(d), is entitled, \"Students Rather than Parents'\nPermission or Consent.\" That clearly references the\npermission or consent under (b)(2)(A). That is where this\npermission or consent is referenced in FERPA, and it\nexplains there the purpose of it, to explain that when a\nstudent becomes 18, as the student here was, or attending\na school of higher education, the permission or consent\nrequired, and the rights accorded to the parents of the\nstudents, shall be required in accordance -- (b)(2)(A)\ngives the student, requires permission or consent, and\nthen gives the right to deny permission or consent. That\nis a direct reference to the rights under (b)(2)(A).\nMoreover, as members of the --\nQUESTION: So we have right, the word right used\nin (b) as well as in (a), or at least with reference to\n(b) as well as with reference to (a).\nMS. BRINKMANN: Much more precisely, Your Honor,\nhere, because they are specifically talking not just about\n(b) generically, but about permission or consent.\nQUESTION: Why does right refer to (b)? I mean,\nrights could refer to (a).\nMS. BRINKMANN: Because the whole provision of\n(d) refers to permission nor consent, Your Honor. There is\nno permission or --\nQUESTION: No, it says permission or consent of\nand the rights.\nMS. BRINKMANN: Yes.\nQUESTION: So --\nMS. BRINKMANN: Yes, but --\nQUESTION: (b), the first is this, and the other\nis that.\nMS. BRINKMANN: But if you look at the structure\nof the provision, they are referring to the actual\npermission or consent, because that's when you would need\nto know, do I go to the -- when I -- for a college\nstudent, do I go to the --\nQUESTION: The right to inspect after he's 18 is\na right that goes to the student, not to the parent.\nMS. BRINKMANN: But Your Honor, this is\nspecifically addressing the permission or consent\nprovision. You can tell by the heading of subsection (d).\nMoreover, under (e), as Your Honor pointed out\nbefore, the school is obligated to inform parents or\nstudents of their rights under the regulations promulgated\nby the Secretary of Education. One of the rights they are\nrequired to inform parents and students about is the\nconsent --\nQUESTION: Ms. Brinkmann --\nMS. BRINKMANN: -- required there.\nQUESTION: Where does it say that? Where does\nit say that?\nMS. BRINKMANN: It would be in the regulations,\nYour Honor.\nQUESTION: In the regulations, okay, fine.\nQUESTION: Even if we say that you met the three\nBlessing standards, Blessing still kind of said in that\nopinion, there's something more, and the more is what\nseems to be the strongest emphasis of the case that Mr.\nRobert and Ms. Millett made, and that is that Congress\ncreated an enforcement scheme that they meant to be it,\nthat would be incompatible with individual enforcement.\nMS. BRINKMANN: Actually that, ironically, leads\nme to my third point, in fact. When you look at this\nhistory, Congress clearly was addressing the interest of\nparents in controlling dissemination of information about\ntheir children. This is a paradigm example of what they\nwere worrying about, information that's gossip,\nunsubstantiated, never had a chance to respond to it,\ncould have a devastating effect on a student's career.\nUnder petitioner's interpretation --\nQUESTION: But the issue isn't whether they were\nworried about that. The issue is whether they wanted to\neliminate that worry by having the Secretary police the\nthing, or by having lawsuits to vindicate private rights.\nMS. BRINKMANN: Yes, Your Honor, and I think --\nQUESTION: I don't see how you advance the ball\nat all by saying what they were worried about was\nprecisely this thing. I mean, I think Mr. Roberts would\nstipulate that.\nMS. BRINKMANN: Well, it was the point that\nJustice Ginsburg brought up before, which actually I think\nresponds to your inquiry. Under petitioner's\ninterpretation, if this student had found out that this\ninformation was about to be released, information he could\nprove was false, he would have no avenue to prevent the\nrelease of that. There was no method at the Department of\nEducation to provide any individual remedy, let alone our\nTRO, and I think that that's even magnified by --\nQUESTION: It may not be the ideal remedy. It\nmay not be the best remedy, and one of the anomalies here\nthat wouldn't be present in title IX is working through\n1983, where you must have a State action pegged. Now,\nhere, it happened that there was a connection with a\nState, with a State officer. The conversation was between\nprivate institutions and State officer, but suppose we\nhave two schools, and one is about to give a record to a\nnewspaper, and the other is about to do the same thing,\nand one is the State university, and one is the private\nuniversity.\nUnder your scheme, the private university would\nbe home free, it wouldn't be subject to 1983 liability,\nbut the public would, and I think that would be a strange\nscheme for Congress to enact.\nMS. BRINKMANN: Your Honor, actually it's much\nmore complicated than that. It's just not whether or not\nsuits are available against public or private, because, of\ncourse, State universities are often deemed arms of the\nState, so they're not subject to suit at all. The only\naction that can be brought against a State official is for\ninjunctive relief. Moreover, most private elementary and\nsecondary schools, as was pointed out in the amicus brief\nin support of respondent, don't receive Federal funding,\nso there are a lot of different ways in which there may be\ndifferent actions, but that is because of 1983 Eleventh\nAmendment --\nQUESTION: Well, maybe that shows that 1983\nreally doesn't fit this pattern, because why -- even, why\nshould certain kinds of institutions be stopped, and\nothers not, from doing the same thing?\nMS. BRINKMANN: Because the relationship of\nstudents at the private school is different than a\nrelationship with a public school. A relationship of a\nstudent at public school is defined by State law. It\nis -- and that's what an action under 1983 is, it's under\ncolor of State law.\nQUESTION: But doesn't the student have the\nsame, whether we're going to call it right or opportunity,\nin the private school with respect to records, like a\nprivate university?\nMS. BRINKMANN: Only if the school receives\nFederal funds. Secondary and elementary --\nQUESTION: Which an overwhelming number of\nschools do.\nMS. BRINKMANN: Only universities, Your Honor.\nActually, the amicus brief of the ACLU cites a letter from\nthe Department of Education explaining that the vast\nmajority of private schools, elementary and secondary, do\nnot receive Federal funding, but if I may, I think that\nthe important point here is, the relationship of a student\nwith a private school is different. There is a\ncontractual relationship there, and there may very well be\nother remedies against a private school arising out of --\nfor example, here in Exhibit 1 at the trial, the handbook,\nGonzaga promised to abide by FERPA and said, we will not\nrelease information without your consent. There could be\na contractual action there. You can't have those kinds of\nactions against a school, public school. That's why\nCongress created section 1983. There was --\nQUESTION: Ms. Brinkmann, can I come back to\nyour assertion that there is no right to an injunction,\nyou can't get an injunction under this act, but you can't\nget an injunction, even if we accept your theory of the\nact. You cannot get an injunction unless you show not\nonly that they're about to release this information, but\nalso that this is their practice or policy.\nMS. BRINKMANN: Absolutely, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Isn't that right?\nMS. BRINKMANN: Absolutely, and --\nQUESTION: So what good does that do you? You\nhave to go in --\nMS. BRINKMANN: Because in this case you needed\nthe testimony of one witness --\nQUESTION: Which suggests that you're not\nvindicating a private right of yours, that somehow what\nCongress is concerned with is the existence of a policy or\npractice that it doesn't like, even though --\nMS. BRINKMANN: With all due respect --\nQUESTION: Even though you're being harmed by\nthis release, under your theory you can't get an\ninjunction against it.\nMS. BRINKMANN: I respectfully disagree.\nQUESTION: Unless you show that there's a policy\nor practice.\nMS. BRINKMANN: You absolutely could get an\ninjunction, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: How so?\nMS. BRINKMANN: Because you needed the testimony\nof one witness in this case who said, we do this all of\nthe time. We disclose information to the State agency\nbefore --\nQUESTION: You need that witness, and if you\ndon't have such a witness, you cannot get an injunction,\nisn't that right?\nMS. BRINKMANN: That's right. That's a matter\nof proof, and Your Honor, what -- I just have to emphasize\nthat what the provision here goes to with the policy and\npractice in (b)(2)(A) is Monell, Gebser, it is Congress\nsaying, we're not going to charge every university with\nthis requirement. If they have a policy or practice, if\nthis decision is made at a high enough level that they\nwould have requisite knowledge, that's the only place in\nwhich this section 1983 liability would be triggered.\nQUESTION: Is there -- can I ask you one\nquestion on the practicality? Assuming all the language\nis ambiguous, et cetera, and I would like you to remove\nthis image from my mind, the image that I have in my mind\nwas an earlier case argued here in this Court, and as a\nresult of the lawyer's argument in that case I focused on\nthe language, educational record, and I realized it's a\nclose question, perhaps, as to whether those words do\ninclude things like a gold star the third grade teacher\nmight give out in class, or the statement, you're going to\nget a bad mark on your report card.\nI suddenly realized it's highly ambiguous, and\nthe lawyer said that he had been cross-examining the\nschool officials on this and related questions in the\ncourtroom for several hours, I thought. I mean, at least\nfor a time, and suddenly it occurred to me, how are they\nteaching or running the school district, and the image\nthat came up in my courtroom was of private actions all\nover the place trying to bring into court school officials\nto interpret language which really doesn't explain itself.\nTherefore, a need for centralized\nadministration, which of course would be harmful to some\nparents, but counterbalanced by the need for effective\nschool administration, and those were the things in my\nmind, and that's the image it called up, and I want you to\nreply to that, because I think that's at the heart of\nthis, at least the practical part.\nQUESTION: I think I have at least five answers.\nI haven't counted them off. First of all, I think it's\nimportant to realize that that's one of the reasons you\nhave the particularized examination in Blessing. We are\nnot saying there's a right under every one of these\nprovisions, but if you look at (b)(2)(A), unless there is\nthe specific requirement, the history of it, and also if\nyou compare it to the other release provisions that do not\nhave this kind of right, they say you have to notify the\nparent, or you have to make the person who's getting it\npromise to destroy it when they're done with it. They\ndon't have this right.\nSo if you look at this particular right, then\nyou step back and you realize what the Department of\nEducation has been saying. Schools comply with this\nstatute. It is clear and simple. You give them a copy,\nyou ask the parents -- tell the parents why and to whom it\nis going.\nIn the 28 years since this statute has been\nenacted, there has been no flood of litigation, despite\nthe fact that the Second Circuit, I think 15 years ago,\nheld that there was a section 1983 cause of action, the\nFifth Circuit more than 10 years ago. There is no Federal\ncourt of appeals that has taken petitioner's position.\nthink in the past 5 or 6 years there have been at least\ntwo more circuits. People comply.\nQUESTION: But Ms. Brinkmann, if your -- if the\nforce -- if we accept the force of your argument, then I\nthink we'd have to say, well, Congress really didn't need\nto bother with the centralized administration provision,\nand yet Congress did put it in, and it seems to me the\nmost likely reason that it put it in is the reason that\nJustice Breyer just gave.\nMS. BRINKMANN: I think --\nQUESTION: So you may have made a good argument\nfor getting rid of it, but as long as it's there, it seems\nto have the same lesson that his question suggests.\nMS. BRINKMANN: I think that the FPCO office\nserves a admirably meritorious role. It answers countless\nnumbers of phone calls and inquiries about this, but its\nown interpretation of its role I think is really\nillustrated by footnote 6 in our brief, which is on page\n35.\nIn 1987, when FPCO changed regulations, it\nexplained that it wasn't going to require schools even to\nafford them access to education records information\nbecause they don't go out and investigate.\nWhat more accurately reflects their\ninvestigation is allowing schools to submit reports -- and\nthis is quotes -- since its inception, FPCO has not\nconducted any on-site visits to resolve complaints.\nRather, it has resolved complaints through correspondence\nand telephone calls with the affected parties, and that\nworks in the vast majority of cases.\nIn the limited number of cases that are brought\nunder FERPA in the Federal courts, Federal and State\ncourts since its enactment, this is the only reported case\nthat anyone has located for punitive damages, and the only\nother case that had any damages was $1 of nominal damages\nthat we've been able to --\nQUESTION: But that may be a very good argument\nfor saying that what Congress had in mind, in effect, in\nconfining the enforcement the way it seems to have done by\nthis exclusive authority provision works in the general\nrun of cases, and therefore there is not a good reason to\nsay that Congress probably would have wanted this private\nright of action with the punitive damages.\nMS. BRINKMANN: I think it works generally, and\nthen you look at the Blessing inquiry to see if Congress\nintended to create a right, they intended to create a\nright from all of those reasons I said. Once you get\nthere, it's clear, it's mandatory --\nQUESTION: But we're at the -- we're beyond\nstage 1, 2, 3 --\nMS. BRINKMANN: It's -- yes.\nQUESTION: -- and we're saying, okay, are there\nparticular reasons to think that they did not.\nMS. BRINKMANN: Then it's presumptively\navailable, a section 1983 action. It's not an implied\ncause of action. Congress created 1983 and said, if you\nhave a Federal right, you can enforce it in court. It is\nagainst that presumption the petitioner has to carry the\nheavy burden that this Court has found met only twice, in\nthe Sea Clammers case and Smith v. Robinson.\nQUESTION: Why isn't the theory of centralized\nadministration, spelled out in the statute, with the\nSecretary's office doing this thing, why doesn't that\novercome the presumption?\nMS. BRINKMANN: Because the presumption has to\nbe overcome by an enforcement scheme, an administrative\nscheme that supplants the section 1983 that has some\naddress for a private remedy.\nQUESTION: Well, certainly it doesn't have to be\na duplicate of section 1983, or there would be no point in\nsaying it supplants it.\nMS. BRINKMANN: Absolutely, Your Honor, but here\nthere is absolutely no availability for any remedy for an\nindividual injury, and Sea Clammers --\nQUESTION: Ms. Brink --\nQUESTION: Well now, wait a minute. As I\nunderstand it, people who are aggrieved by some practice\nin the schools can get a hold of the Secretary's office\nand -- by a phone call and perhaps by the Secretary's\naction in saying, either you fly right or we'll cut off\nfunds, they do have a remedy.\nMS. BRINKMANN: Not under (b)(2)(A), if they\nhave released records. There's no provision for any kind\nof damages compensation for an individual, and the Court\nhas looked at that role of the administrative scheme in\nits line of cases, deciding whether or not it was\nsufficient to supplant this congressionally created right\nunder section 1983. In the two cases --\nQUESTION: Ms. Brinkmann, can you give us one\nother example of a right that depends upon whether the\nperson allegedly violating the right has done it before?\nMS. BRINKMANN: Yes, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Or has a policy or practice of doing\nit? For example, you know, your right to be free from\nunreasonable searches and seizures.\nQUESTION: I suppose you're going to tell us\nabout the Monell case.\nMS. BRINKMANN: I was going to cite the Monell\ncase. I think that's --\nQUESTION: No, no, no.\nMS. BRINKMANN: -- exactly what the Monell case\nis about.\nQUESTION: That depends on whom you can sue.\nThat depends upon whom you can assert the right against,\nbut against the individual you can assert that right,\nwhether there's a policy or practice or not. That's\nsimply the question of whether you can reach the\nmunicipality, but I cannot think of a single other right\nin the world which only exists as a right when somebody is\na two-time loser, or has a policy, or practice.\nMS. BRINKMANN: Your Honor, a policy or practice\nmay not have injured anyone in the past. They may have a\nwritten policy in saying, we're going to release these\nthings to --\nQUESTION: Maybe, but it's a very strange right.\nI don't know of any --\nMS. BRINKMANN: This is the fact --\nQUESTION: I mean, I have another rights\nquestion, too, but I -- you're relying on the use of the\nright, of the term, right, in the statute. What do you\ndo -- what do you conceive to be the -- it's on the --\nit's on page 4a of the blue brief.\nIt refers to the privacy rights of students. It\nsays that no funds shall be available, blah, blah, blah,\nunless in accordance with regulations of the Secretary,\nthe student or parents has a right to challenge the\ncontent of each student's education record in order to\nensure that the records are not inaccurate, misleading, or\notherwise in violation of the privacy rights of students.\nIs that also the creation of a Federal privacy right?\nMS. BRINKMANN: I don't believe so, Your Honor.\nI have to --\nQUESTION: Does it refer to existing State\nprivacy rights, or just sort of a moral notion of what\nthings should be kept private?\nMS. BRINKMANN: Well, I have to emphasize, our\nstatutory argument about rights is not based solely on the\n1232g(d) referenced rights. It's based on the, unless\nthere is consent from the parents, and on this\nparticularized consent required, giving parents a copy,\ntelling them to whom am I -- that is what demonstrates\nunder the Blessing standard it was intended to benefit\nparents and to address their specific needs to protect\ntheir children from information they have never been\ninformed about, as in this case, that destroyed this\nperson's career.\nThat's exactly what Congress was aiming at, and\nwithout -- in petitioner's position there was absolutely\nnothing that anyone can do to protect that right. The\nDepartment of Education cannot give individual relief, and\nthis -- anybody will be barred from going into court.\nFortunately, this doesn't happen. It's simple. Schools\ncomply with it. This is an exceptionally unusual and\negregious case.\nQUESTION: Well, Ms. Brinkmann, there haven't\nbeen other cases where substantial monetary damages and\npunitive damages have been available, and maybe that's the\nconcern. I mean, it's -- this is a person who did have a\nright. There was a contract right, and there was the\ndeformation, but by bringing 1983 into the picture, the\ndamages are increased for the same conduct, and you can\npick up 1988 counsel fees.\nMS. BRINKMANN: It's not the same conduct, Your\nHonor, if I may. First of all, deformation would not\nnecessarily cover cases that involved truthful\ninformation, but in this particular case, if I could just\nmake clear, what I think -- first of all, this involved\ncompensatory damages, just not punitive, but of course\nthis Court's ruling will affect injunctive actions also,\nbut in this case, because this information was released at\nthe very outset of this investigation, it affected the\nschool's decision about whether or not to issue an\naffidavit to my client.\nThere was disagreement -- even as it stood,\nwithout any information from my client to say this was\nfalse, there was disagreement amongst the school officials\nabout whether or not to issue this, and plaintiff's\nexhibit 28 has a chronology. The people at the school who\nwere in favor of releasing, of not giving the affidavit\ngot State officials to contact the dean and --\nQUESTION: Thank you, Ms. Brinkmann.\nMr. Roberts, you have 4 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN G. ROBERTS, JR.\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. ROBERTS: Thank you, Your Honor.\nTwo statutes enacted within 2 years of each\nother: title IX, no person shall be subject to\ndiscrimination; FERPA, no funds shall be made available to\nan institution that has a policy or practice described in\nthe statute, and the Secretary shall deal with violations,\nand the Secretary shall do that at one place, because\nwe're worried about multiple interpretations causing\nconfusion.\nNow, that is two -- those are two very different\nways of approaching a problem. Under this Court's\nprecedents the former, the title IX model confers\nprivately enforceable rights. The latter does not. Why\nwould Congress proceed differently in dealing with\neducational institutions in those two different contexts?\nBecause of the appreciation that the regulation of student\nrecords from kindergarten through graduate school directly\nimplicated pedagogical concerns.\nIt would have been a radical notion, even in\n1974, for Congress to confer individual rights on every\nstudent from kindergarten to graduate school in a way that\nwould directly implicate the day-to-day running of schools\nacross the country, and there's no evidence to suggest\nthat that's what Congress had in mind.\nThe evidence is the opposite. It proceeded\ngingerly. It said, this is directed to the Secretary.\nIt's directed to policies and practice. Who's going to\ndeal with violations? Mr. Secretary, deal with\nviolations, and do it in one place. Four months after\nFERPA was enacted, in response to what was called by the\nsponsors the perplexity and frustration it had caused --\nfour months -- they added the second sentence to\nsubsection (g) on page 12a of the blue brief, and that\nsaid, don't do any of this, Mr. Secretary, in any of the\nregional offices. The reason? We're afraid of multiple\ninterpretation.\nWell, multiple interpretations caused by\nregional offices, there's a slight problem there, are,\nafter all, answerable to the Secretary. Individual\nprivate plaintiffs suing in State and Federal court around\nthe country, any one of these 62 million students covered\nby the Federal funds requirement, that would give rise to\nmultiple interpretations, and it is implausible to\nsuppose --\nQUESTION: They're answerable to us, presumably.\nWe could take care of all of that, right?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. ROBERTS: Well, it is implausible to suppose\nthat the same Congress that was so worried about multiple\ninterpretations of the law from the regional offices of\none Department would have been perfectly content and, in\nfact, intended to confer the right for every one of 62\nmillion students to go into court in a 1983 action.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr.\nRoberts.\nMR.
