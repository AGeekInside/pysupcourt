The Equal\nEmployment Opportunity Commission.\nMr. Laycock.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF DOUGLAS LAYCOCK\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. LAYCOCK: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe churches do not set the criteria for\nselecting or removing the officers of government, and\ngovernment does not set the criteria for selecting or\nremoving officers of the church. That's a bedrock\nprinciple, and these Respondents would repudiate it.\nThey no longer seriously argue that Cheryl Perich was\nnot a minister. Instead, they argue that even people\nwho are indisputably ministers can sue their churches on\nclaims that turn on their qualifications, their job\nperformance, and the rules of ministry. They would --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Laycock, would you\nclarify one point? You say the church decides who's\nqualified to be a minister, but, as I understand the\nfacts here, she was never decommissioned as a minister,\nand, beyond that, she was even recommended by the\nofficials to other parishes to be a commissioned\nminister. So, it's -- it's odd to say there's any\ninterferences with who is qualified to be a minister,\nbecause the church was holding her out as being\nqualified.\nMR. LAYCOCK: Well, she was removed from her\nministry at Hosanna-Tabor. They do not have to indulge\nin a vendetta against her and file charges with the\nsynod. And if you look at that recommendation -- it's\nin the joint appendix -- it is not much of a\nrecommendation. There's excellent, commendable,\nproficient, and in ministry qualities, she gets\nproficient. We all know if there's a 5, a 4, and a 3, a\n3 isn't very good.\nSo, they were not recommending her; they\nsimply weren't pursuing formal charges against her\nbefore the -- before the Missouri Synod. And -- and the\nproblems they had were most severe at Hosanna-Tabor. In\nanother congregation that didn't know this history, she\nmight have been able to be effective again. That was\nfor them to decide. They make their own calls.\nBut she was removed at Hosanna-Tabor, which\nwas where the problem was.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, most of the\ncircuits have recognized a ministerial exception. But\nthey've, in one form or another, created a pretext\nexception. The reason for that is the situation that\ntroubles me. How about a teacher who reports sexual\nabuse to the government and is fired because of that\nreporting?\nNow, we know from the news recently that\nthere was a church whose religious beliefs centered\naround sexually exploiting women and, I believe,\nchildren. Regardless of whether it's a religious belief\nor not, doesn't society have a right at some point to\nsay certain conduct is unacceptable, even if religious\n-- smoking peyote? And once we say that's unacceptable,\ncan and why shouldn't we protect the people who are\ndoing what the law requires, i.e., reporting it?\nSo, how do we deal with that situation under\nyour theory? Under your theory, nothing survives if the\nindividual is a minister, no claim, private claim.\nMR. LAYCOCK: I think if you look at the\ncourt of appeals cases, they have not indulged in\npretext inquiries for ministers. The case you present\nis obviously a difficult case, and I would say two\nthings: We think the appropriate rule should be the\ngovernment could do many things to force reporting, to\npenalize people who don't report, but a discharge claim\nby a minister presents the question why she was\ndischarged, and the court should stay out of that.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The problem with that is\nthat it doesn't take account of the societal interest in\nencouraging the reporting. And, in fact, if we -- if we\ndefine the ministerial exception in the way you want, we\ntake away the incentive for reporting; we actually do\nthe opposite of what society needs.\nMR. LAYCOCK: I understand that concern, and\nthat was my second point, that if you want to carve out\nan exception for cases like child abuse where the\ngovernment's interest is in protecting the child, not an\ninterest in protecting the minister, when you get such a\ncase, we think you could carve out that exception.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How? Give me a\ntheoretical framework for this.\nMR. LAYCOCK: The -- first you have to\nidentify the government's interest in regulation. If\nthe government's interest is in protecting ministers\nfrom discrimination, we are squarely within the heart of\nthe ministerial exception.\nIf the government's interest is something\nquite different from that, like protecting the children,\nthen you can assess whether that government interest is\nsufficiently compelling to justify interfering with the\nrelationship between the church and its ministers. But\nthe government's interest is at its nadir when the claim\nis: We want to protect these ministers as such. We\nwant to tell the churches what criteria they should\napply for -- for selecting and removing ministers.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Mr. Laycock, the ministerial\nexception is not something new. It has been widely\nrecognized, as Justice Sotomayor mentioned, by the\ncourts of appeals going back 40 years. So, we can see\nhow the recognition of this exception within -- with\ncertain contours has worked out. And how has it worked\nout over those past 40 years? Have there been a great\nmany cases, a significant number of cases, involving the\nkinds of things that Justice Sotomayor is certainly\nrightly concerned about, instances in which ministers\nhave been fired for reporting criminal violations and\nthat sort of thing?\nMR. LAYCOCK: The only -- I'm not aware of\nany such case. The one case I am aware of cuts the\nother way. A minister, a priest accused of sexually\nabusing children who was fired, sued to get his job\nback, and the church invoked the ministerial exception,\nand that case ended. They were able to get rid of him.\nThere is a cert petition pending in which a\nteacher with a long series of problems in her school\ncalled the police about an allegation of sexual abuse\nthat did not happen at the school, did not involve a\nstudent of the school, did not involve a parent at the\nschool, someplace else; and -- and called the police and\nhad them come interview a student without any\ncommunication with -- with her principal. And the\nrespondents tried to spin that as a case of discharge\nfor reporting sexual abuse. But if you look at the\nfacts, it's really quite different. And those are the\nonly two cases I'm aware of that even approach touching\non this problem.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But here what we have is a\nclaim of retaliation, so that she can't even get a\nhearing. So, we can look at the various tests that are\nproposed here, and I think it's difficult to formulate\nthe tests, but this can't even be -- be litigated\nbecause she is discharged. The allegation is that\nthere's a retaliation for even asking for a hearing\nwhere these tests could -- could be applied.\nMR. LAYCOCK: Well, she can't get a hearing\nin civil court. She could have had a hearing in the\nsynod before decisionmakers who would have been\nindependent of the local church. This Court has\nrepeatedly said churches can create tribunals for the\ngovernance of their officers. The churches --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Again, that -- that could\nbe an argument you could make in the -- in the pretext\nhearing.\nMR. LAYCOCK: Well, it's an argument we make\nin the hearing on whether the ministerial exception\napplies. You know --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But you're asking for an\nexemption so these issues can't even be tried.\nMR. LAYCOCK: Well, we're asking to apply\nthe exemption --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: It's almost like a summary\n-- like a summary judgment argument.\nMR. LAYCOCK: It was precisely a motion\nfor --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And that's the -- that's\nthe analogy, I think.\nMR. LAYCOCK: It was a motion for summary\njudgment.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: No, no, no. What she is\nsaying is that you basically gave me summary judgment;\nyou didn't allow me to go to the agency to have a proper\ntest applied. The summary judgment was just an analogy.\nForget it.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. LAYCOCK: I'm not entirely sure I\nunderstand the question. We agree she couldn't go to\ncivil court if she's a minister. She could have gone to\nthe synod. She wasn't cut off from that. She decided\nnot to do it.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But I'm saying if there\nare some substantial interests the church has that can\nbe litigated in EEOC hearing. She was fired simply for\nasking for a hearing.\nMR. LAYCOCK: I understand that. But once\nyou start to litigate these cases --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I think your point is that\nit's -- it's none of the business of the government to\ndecide what the substantial interest of the church is.\nMR. LAYCOCK: That's one of my points, maybe\nthe most important of my points. These -- these\ndecisions are committed to the churches by separation of\nchurch and state, but -- but beyond that, once the --\nthis process of trying to identify, we can decide some\nissues in this case and we won't get to other issues in\nthis case doesn't work. As Justice Breyer said in a\nFirst Circuit opinion, that requires more and more\nfinely spun distinctions that create entanglement rather\nthan avoid it, Universidad de Bayamon.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, you\nreferred to the ministerial exception, but, of course,\nyour position extends beyond ministers. How do we --\nhow do we decide who's covered by the ministerial\nexception and who is not?\nMR. LAYCOCK: Right. Here I think it's very\neasy. She's a commissioned minister in the church. She\nholds ecclesiastical office. She teaches the religion\nclass.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, let's say it's\na teacher who teaches only purely secular subjects but\nleads the class in grace before lunch. Is that somebody\nwho would be covered by the ministerial exception?\nMR. LAYCOCK: The lower courts have said\nthat person is not covered. And we are not challenging\nthat rule. Obviously, there has to be some kind of\nquantitative threshold. There will be line-drawing\nproblems. But --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But I thought your\nposition would be if she's a commissioned minister, as\ndistinguished from a teacher who conducts grace or takes\nthe class to chapel. I'm -- I take it the Chief is\nasking for somebody in this -- that you categorize as a\nminister, although mostly she's a math teacher. You\nwould say the extent of her religious duties don't\nmatter; what counts is that she is commissioned as a\nminister.\nMR. LAYCOCK: If she's commissioned as a\nminister and if that is not a sham, then we think that\nmakes her a minister. If you have a Jesuit teaching\nphysics, we think he is still a priest. And he's still\ncontrolled by the ministerial exception.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Can we try whether it's a\nsham? I thought you said we couldn't try whether it's a\nsham.\nMR. LAYCOCK: Well --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Is a sham different from a\npretext?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. LAYCOCK: Well, I -- I certainly meant\nsomething different from a pretext. A sham is more\nextreme, and it goes to a different point in the\nanalysis. You can decide whether she's really a\nminister. That's the threshold question that courts\nmust decide. And if we have a person with a ministerial\ntitle who is doing nothing at all religious or\nministerial, we have a church that tries to say everyone\nwho ever worked for us or ever may is a minister, the\ncourts can deal with those cases if they --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So, you would allow the --\nthe government courts to probe behind the church's\nassertion that this person is a minister? You would\nallow that, right? But once it is determined that the\nperson is a minister, you would not allow the government\nto decide whether the firing was a pretext?\nMR. LAYCOCK: That's right.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, different\nchurches have different ideas about who's a minister.\nThere are some churches who think all of our adherents\nare ministers of our faith. Now, does that mean that\neverybody who's a member of that church qualifies as a\nminister because that is part of the church's belief?\nMR. LAYCOCK: I don't -- I don't think it\nmeans that. And, again, I -- I think courts have some\ncapacity to look at what this employee is actually\ndoing, and if he's not performing any of the functions\nof a religious leader, if he's not teaching the faith,\nthen --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Every one of our\nadherents stands as a witness to our beliefs. And\nthat -- you know, not every church is hierarchical in\nterms of different offices.\nMR. LAYCOCK: I understand that. And lay\npeople in many churches are expected to be witnesses,\nright. So --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Lay people in many --\nMR. LAYCOCK: Lay people have to be\nwitnesses. The fact that you're expected to witness to\nthe faith when the occasion arises doesn't make you --\ndoesn't make you a minister.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But the answer you gave to\nthe Chief Justice seems to me to be this case. I was\ninterested. I didn't know about this -- this minister\ncapacity in this particular church. And as the Chief\nJustice indicates, many churches don't have -- some\nchurches don't have what we think of as professional or\nfull-time ministers at all. They're all ministers.\nMR. LAYCOCK: Right.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And you said, well, that\n-- that can be litigated, that can be investigated. And\nI suppose when we do that we say, how many secular\nfunctions do you perform? And that's what this case is.\nBut you don't -- you don't even want that issue to be\ntried. You say that issue can't even be explored.\nMR. LAYCOCK: How -- you know, how many\nreligious functions you perform can be explored. The\nissue that can be explored is whether she's a minister.\nWe think she clearly is. The issue --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And that term is a legal\nterm. What constitutes a minister is -- is decided by\nthe law, not by the church, right?\nMR. LAYCOCK: That is correct.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Okay.\nMR. LAYCOCK: That is correct.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Is that correct?\nJUSTICE ALITO: But I thought with a lot of\ndeference to the church's understanding of whether\nsomeone is a minister.\nMR. LAYCOCK: We think there should be\ndeference to good-faith understandings, but we are not\narguing for a rule that would enable an organization to\nfraudulently declare that everyone is a minister when\nit's not true. You decided the Tony Alamo case 20 years\nago. We're not defending that.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What makes it not true?\nWhat is the legal definition of \"minister\"? What is it?\nThat you have to lead the congregation in their\nreligious services or what? What is it?\nMR. LAYCOCK: We think -- we think you -- if\nyou teach the doctrines of the faith, if that is part of\nyour job responsibilities, to teach the doctrines of the\nfaith, we think you're a minister.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Well, does that mean that\nany religious teacher is a minister under your theory?\nSo, you know, there may be teachers in religious schools\nwho teach religious subjects, not mathematics, but are\nnot ordained or commissioned in any way as ministers.\nAre they ministers?\nMR. LAYCOCK: If you're ordained or\ncommissioned, that makes it very easy. If you teach the\nreligion class, you teach an entire class on religion,\nwe think you ought to be within this rule.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought that it was\npart of -- it was agreed that there was no fact dispute\nthat what she did, her duties at the school, did not\nchange from when she was a contract teacher, and\ntherefore not a minister, and then she takes courses and\nis qualified to become a minister, but what she's doing\nat the school is the very same thing. And I thought\nthat was the basis for the -- the decision that we're\nreviewing, that there was no difference at all in what\nshe did before she was commissioned and after she was\ncommissioned.\nMR. LAYCOCK: That -- that's what the Sixth\nCircuit said. What they -- what -- you know, I don't\nthink that changes the nature of the functions that were\nbeing performed. But what's relevant to that, that they\nneglected was these noncommissioned -- these teachers\nwho were not commissioned ministers, the lay and\ncontract teachers, were fill-ins only when no called\nteacher was available, and Perich identifies only one\nperson for 1 year.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But you're isolating one\nparish, but there was something in one of these briefs\nthat said the majority of the teachers in the Lutheran\nschools -- let's see where it was. I think it was --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: While Justice Ginsburg is\nlooking, I had -- I had the same impression, that\nwhether you're commissioned or not commissioned doesn't\nnecessarily mean you can't teach a religious class.\nMR. LAYCOCK: Well, it doesn't --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And again, that's\nsomething that -- that can be heard. You don't even\nwant to hear it.\nMR. LAYCOCK: That's -- it is not uncommon,\neven with ordained ministers, it's not uncommon among\nProtestants, to recognize an ordination from a different\ndenomination that has similar teachings. So, when --\nwhen they can't find a called minister to cover a class\nand they hire another Christian from another\nconservative Protestant denomination, they say: While\nyou teach here, you're required to teach Lutheran\ndoctrine.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sorry. Going back\nto the question Justice Kagan asked you, if one of these\nProtestant teachers that's not Lutheran led the\ncafeteria prayer, as they are required to, you're now\nsaying that the law must recognize that lay teacher as a\nminister and apply the ministerial exception, even\nthough the religion doesn't consider her a minister?\nMR. LAYCOCK: I -- I didn't say that. I\nsaid --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, but that was the\nanswer you gave. If she taught a religious class --\nMR. LAYCOCK: If she teaches a religion\nclass, not if she merely leads a prayer.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, what is your\ndefinition of \"minister\"? Maybe we need to find out.\nSo, it's not a title. It's really -- the only\nfunction -- you're saying anyone who teaches religion?\nMR. LAYCOCK: I think if you teach the\nreligion class, you're clearly a minister. But if you\nare -- if you hold an ecclesiastical office, that makes\nthis a very easy --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Okay, but this is -- you're\nsaying a fortiori, but basically you'd be here anyway\neven if she hadn't been ordained; right?\nMR. LAYCOCK: That's correct.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Okay.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What is your take -- what\nis your reaction to a less dramatic kind of holding?\nSuppose we were to say the truth is that the particular\nindividual here does have some religious obligations in\nteaching and quite a lot that aren't. So, she's sort of\non the edge. At the same time, there is a statute\nwhich, whether it applies or not, you could take the\nprinciple, and it says a religious organization like\nyour client may require that she conform to the\nreligious tenets of the organization.\nSo, Congress focused on this. And the\ndistrict court looks at it, and suppose it were to\ndecide: That's true, but there's no evidence here at\nall that religious tenets had anything to do with her\nbeing dismissed. No one mentioned them. She didn't\nknow about them. I didn't until I read the very\nexcellent brief filed by the Lutherans that explained\nthe nature of taking civil suits. No one said that to\nher, whether it was in someone's mind or not. She found\nout on motion for summary judgment. So, therefore, this\nwasn't an effort by the religious organization to\nexpress its tenets. She was dismissed.\nShe could have -- they could have had a\ndefense, but it doesn't apply, and, therefore, even\nthough she's sort of like a minister, she loses.\nWhat are your objections to that?\nMR. LAYCOCK: Well, my first objection is I\ndon't think those are remotely the facts here. You\nknow, this teaching is clearly stated, embodied in an\nelaborate dispute resolution process. You don't ask\nfor --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Did anyone mention that to\nher?\nMR. LAYCOCK: Indeed.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Really? My law clerk\ncouldn't find it. Can you tell me where -- where\nsomeone did say the reason we're dismissing you is\nbecause of our religious doctrine that you cannot bring\ncivil suits?\nMR. LAYCOCK: Page 55 of the joint appendix,\nwhich is the letter that -- where they tell her that\nthey're going to recommend recission of her call, they\nsay, because -- because of insubordination and because\nyou threatened to sue us.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I mean, does anyone explain\nto her, which she might not have known, that this is a\nreligious doctrine that you are supposed to go to the\nsynod or whatever, and you're not supposed to go to\ncourt?\nMR. LAYCOCK: She --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Of course, they wanted to\nfire her because she threatened to sue them. But what\nI'm wondering is, is there anywhere before the motion\nfor summary judgment where someone explains to her, our\nmotivation here is due to our religious tenet?\nMR. LAYCOCK: You don't assess the\nimportance of a doctrine by asking the person --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, no. I understand that.\nBut I went on a different piece of -- matter, that the\npeople who were involved in this were doing it for\nreligious rather than civil reasons. I'm just wondering\nwhat the evidence is that they knew there was such a\ndoctrine, that they were motivated by the religious\ndoctrine, and that they expressed that to her. I\njust -- I'll look at page 55. Is there anything else I\nshould look at?\nMR. LAYCOCK: The principal --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Is it -- is it in the\nhandbook? I mean, one of the objections -- if this --\nif this is a rule that's going to bind the teachers,\nthen you would expect to find it in the handbook. But\nthe handbook doesn't tell her, if you complain to the\nEEOC about discrimination, then you will be fired.\nMR. LAYCOCK: Well, I don't know if it does\nor it doesn't, because the handbook is not in the record\nexcept for a short excerpt. But she knew about this\nrule.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, Mr. Laycock, could\nyou --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I'm looking for a citation\nin the record? I just wonder, is there anything you\nwant me to read other than page 55?\nMR. LAYCOCK: Yes. The principal in her\ndeposition says: The minute she said she might sue, I\nsaid you can't do that; you're a called teacher.\nThe testimony is the board talked about it\nat their meeting on February 22nd. I think that's also\nin the principal's deposition. The president of the\ncongregation, who did not deal directly with Perich,\nsaid -- said it was one of the first things that he\nthought about. Perich was a lifelong Lutheran. She\nworked 11 years in Lutheran schools. She had these\neight theology courses. It's simply not credible that\nshe didn't know about this doctrine.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Mr. Laycock, doesn't this\ninquiry illustrate the problems that will necessarily\noccur if you get into a pretext analysis? The question\nof was she told that she had violated the church's\nteaching about suing in a civil tribunal? Well, that\ndepends. The significance of -- let's assume she wasn't\ntold. The significance of that depends on how central a\nteaching of Lutheranism this is.\nIt's like -- suppose a Catholic priest got\nmarried and the bishop said, I'm removing you from your\nparish because of your conduct. Now, there wouldn't be\nmuch question about why that was done. So, you'd have\nto get in, what did Martin Luther actually say about --\nabout suing the church or other Christians in a civil\ntribunal? Is this really a central tenet of\nLutheranism? Isn't that the problem with going into\nthis pretext analysis?\nMR. LAYCOCK: That's just part of the\nproblem. You've got to figure, how does this doctrine\nwork? How important is it? How does it apply to the\nfacts of this case? How does it interact with other\ndoctrines?\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Laycock, you, in\norder, I think, to dispel the notion that nothing is\npermitted, in your reply brief you say there are many\nsuits that could be brought that would not be\ninappropriate. And I think it's on page 20 of your\nreply brief. But I don't understand how those would\nwork if the policy is you're a minister; if you have\nquarrels with the church or a co-worker, we have our own\ndispute resolution, and you don't go outside.\nBut you say tort arising from unsafe working\nconditions. Suppose one of these commissioned workers\nsaid, I think that there are unsafe working conditions\nand I'm going to complain to the Occupational Health and\nSafety Agency. And wouldn't she get the same answer:\nThis has to be solved in-house. You don't go to an\nagency of the state.\nWhy -- I don't follow why the tort claim\nbased on unsafe working conditions would not fall under\nthe same ban on -- keeping disputes in-house?\nMR. LAYCOCK: Well, it may or it may not.\nThe rule on internal dispute resolution is most\nemphatically and clearly stated as applying to disputes\nover fitness for ministry, and a tort claim may not be a\ndispute over fitness for ministry, but what --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But I thought the reason\nthat she was unfit for the ministry was that she went\noutside the house.\nMR. LAYCOCK: That's right. Yes.\nJUDGE GINSBURG: So, in all of these cases,\nyou go outside the church, you go to the government,\nthen you have a --\nMR. LAYCOCK: What we say in the passages in\nthe reply brief that you're looking at is the legal\ndoctrine, the ministerial exception as a matter of law,\ndoes not apply unless the dispute is over whether I get\nthe job back, job qualifications, job performance, or\nrules of ministry. The church's rule --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But she could -- she\ncould be -- for any of these things, she could be\ndisciplined, fired because she complained outside the\nhouse.\nMR. LAYCOCK: She could be. And her tort --\nthe tort claim would proceed. We think the retaliation\nclaim should not proceed.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The tort claim could\nproceed, and then she would get damages, and that would\nbe all right?\nMR. LAYCOCK: She would get damages for the\ntort. She would not get damages for the loss of her\nposition.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Did you say -- did I\nunderstand you before, in response to Justice Sotomayor\nand Justice Scalia, that even if she were merely a\ncontract teacher, the fact that she teaches religion\nclasses would be enough for her to qualify for the\nministerial exception?\nMR. LAYCOCK: Yes. And the fact that she's\na commissioned minister is the clincher in this case.\nTeaching --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Is the clincher in this\ncase, but even -- I think you answered if she were not a\ncommissioned minister, she's teaching the faith;\ntherefore, she can be fired, and it doesn't matter\nwhether she's commissioned. So, the commission is\nirrelevant. It's -- it's her job duties that count.\nMR. LAYCOCK: Job duties are enough. The\ncommission is not irrelevant. It is the clincher.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Now, it was certainly for\nsome purposes. I mean, if every teacher who teaches\nreligion and math and a lot of other things said, I'm a\nminister and I'm entitled to the parsonage allowance on\nmy income tax return, certainly that's something that a\ngovernment agent would review.\nMR. LAYCOCK: Well, they do review it there.\nI think there's a -- I don't think the Lutherans have\nany problems with the IRS on that. But, yes, that is a\ncontext where they review these questions.\nIf I could reserve a few minutes for\nrebuttal, I would be grateful.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You may.\nMs. Kruger.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF LEONDRA R. KRUGER\nON BEHALF OF THE FEDERAL RESPONDENT\nMS. KRUGER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe freedom of religious communities to come\ntogether to express and share religious belief is a\nfundamental constitutional right. But it's a right that\nmust also accommodate important governmental interests\nin securing the public welfare. Congress has not\nunconstitutionally infringed Petitioner's freedom in\nthis case by making it illegal for it to fire a fourth\ngrade teacher in retaliation for asserting her statutory\nrights.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is the position of\nthe United States that there is a ministerial exception\nor that there is not a ministerial exception?\nMS. KRUGER: Mr. Chief Justice, if the\nministerial exception is understood as a First Amendment\ndoctrine that governs the adjudication of disputes\nbetween certain employees and their employers, we agree\nthat that First Amendment doctrine exists.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Nothing to do with\nrespect to the ministers. In other words, is there a\nministerial exception distinct from the right of\nassociation under the First Amendment?\nMS. KRUGER: We think that the ministerial\nexception is one that incorporates the right of\nassociation as well as the rights under the religion\nclauses.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is there anything\nspecial about the fact that the people involved in this\ncase are part of a religious organization?\nMS. KRUGER: We think that the -- the\nanalysis is one that the Court has -- has elaborated in\nother cases involving similar claims to autonomy,\nnoninterference --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is that a \"no\"? You\nsay it's similar to other cases. Expressive\nassociations -- a group of people who are interested in\nlabor rights have expressive associations. Is the issue\nwe are talking about here in the view of the United\nStates any different than any other group of people who\nget together for an expressive right?\nMS. KRUGER: We think the basic contours of\nthe inquiry are not different. We think how the inquiry\nplays out in particular cases may be --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's extraordinary.\nMS. KRUGER: I --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's extraordinary.\nMS. KRUGER: Well, I --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: We're talking here about\nthe Free Exercise Clause and about the Establishment\nClause, and you say they have no special application\nto --\nMS. KRUGER: The contours -- but the inquiry\nthat the Court has set out as to expressive associations\nwe think translate quite well to analyzing the claim\nthat Petitioner has made here. And for this reason, we\ndon't think that the job duties of a particular\nreligious employee in an organization are relevant to\nthe inquiry.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: There's nothing in the\nConstitution that explicitly prohibits the government\nfrom mucking around in a labor organization. Now, yes,\nyou -- you can by an extension of First Amendment rights\nderive such a -- but there, black on white in the text\nof the Constitution are special protections for\nreligion. And you say that makes no difference?\nMS. KRUGER: Well, Justice Scalia, if I may,\nI don't understand Petitioner from the first half of his\nargument to have disputed this basic point, which is\nthat the contours of the First Amendment doctrine at\nissue here will depend on a balancing of interests.\nThat is the only way, I think, that Petitioner can\ndifferentiate a generally neutrally applicable\napplication of anti-discrimination law with respect to a\nchurch's choice of those who would govern it and a\nchurch's retaliation against a teacher who would report\nchild abuse to the authorities.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I think that the balancing\nof interests is different, according to the Petitioner,\nwhen one of the interests is religion. And you're just\ndenying that. You say: We balance religion the way we\nbalance labor organizations.\nMS. KRUGER: Well, Justice Scalia --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's certainly not what\nthe Petitioner is saying.\nMS. KRUGER: Here is where I think what the\ncore of the insight of the ministerial exception as it\nwas originally conceived is, which is that there are\ncertain relationships within a religious community that\nare so fundamental, so private and ecclesiastical in\nnature, that it will take an extraordinarily compelling\ngovernmental interest to justify interference. Concerns\nwith health or safety, for example. But the\ngovernment's general interest in eradicating\ndiscrimination in the workplace will not be sufficient\nto justify the burden.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, do you dispute the\nproposition that one of the central concerns of the\nEstablishment Clause was preventing the government from\nchoosing ministers? When there was an established\nchurch, the government chose the ministers or had a say\nin choosing the ministers. And the Establishment\nClause, many argue, was centrally focused on eliminating\nthat governmental power. Now, do you dispute that?\nMS. KRUGER: No, Justice Alito, we don't\ndispute it. What we do dispute is that what is\nhappening when the government applies generally\napplicable anti-retaliation law to a religious employer\nis that it is choosing a minister on behalf of the\nchurch. What it is instead doing is preventing\nreligious employers, like any other employers, from\npunishing their employees for threatening to bring\nillegal conduct to the attention of --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Suppose that's the central\ntenet. Suppose you have a religion and the central\ntenet is: You have a problem with what we do, go to the\nsynod; don't go to court. And that applies to civil\nactions of all kinds. All right? So, would that not be\nprotected by the First Amendment?\nMS. KRUGER: Justice Breyer, two points --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Your view is it's not\nprotected?\nMS. KRUGER: It's not protected. But I'd\nlike -- I think there are two responses that are\nrelevant to how this Court will resolve that question in\nthis case.\nFirst of all, if the Court were to accept\nthe rule that Petitioner would ask it to adopt, we would\nnever ask the question whether or not the church has a\nreason for firing an employee that's rooted in religious\ndoctrine. Their submission is that the hiring and\nfiring decisions with respect to parochial school\nteachers and with respect to priests is categorically\noff limits. And we think that that is a rule that is\ninsufficiently attentive to the relative public and\nprivate interests at stake, interests that this Court\nhas repeatedly recognized are important in\ndetermining freedom of association claims.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So that, in fact, if they\nwant to choose to the priest, you could go to the\nCatholic Church and say they have to be women. I mean,\nyou couldn't say that. That's obvious. So, how are you\ndistinguishing this?\nMS. KRUGER: Right. We think that the --\nboth the private and public interests are very different\nin the two scenarios. The government's general interest\nin eradicating discrimination in the workplace is simply\nnot sufficient to justify changing the way that the\nCatholic Church chooses its priests based on gender\nroles that are rooted in religious doctrine.\nBut the interests in this case are quite\ndifferent. The government has a compelling and indeed\noverriding interest in ensuring that individuals are not\nprevented from coming to the government with information\nabout illegal conduct.\nJUSTICE ALITO: When you say that, are you\nnot implicitly making a judgment about the relative\nimportance of the Catholic doctrine that only males can\nbe ordained as priests and the Lutheran doctrine that a\nLutheran should not sue the church in civil courts? I\ndon't see any distinction between -- I can't reconcile\nyour position on those two issues without coming to the\nconclusion that you think that the Catholic doctrine is\nolder, stronger, and entitled to more respect than the\nLutheran doctrine.\nMS. KRUGER: No, we're not -- we're not\ndrawing distinctions between the importance of a\nparticular religious tenet in a system of religious\nbelief. But the difference is that the government has\na, indeed, foundational interest in ensuring, as a\nmatter of preserving the integrity of the rule of law,\nthat individuals are not punished for coming --\nJUSTICE BREYER: You're saying that going to\nchurch -- sorry -- that going to court is a more\nfundamental interest than a woman obtaining the job that\nshe wants, which happens in this case to be a Catholic\npriest. But that's the distinction you're making.\nMS. KRUGER: I am drawing a distinction\nbetween --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, why? I don't know\nwhy that doesn't -- I mean, you may be right, but it\nisn't obvious to me that the one is the more important\nthan the other.\nMS. KRUGER: The government's interest in\npreventing retaliation against those who would go to\ncivil authorities with civil wrongs is foundational to\nthe rule of law.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Ms. Kruger, if I could just\nclarify for a second there, because you're now sounding\nas though you want to draw a sharp line between\nretaliation claims and substantive discrimination\nclaims, and I didn't get that from your brief. So, is\nthat, in fact, what you're saying?\nMS. KRUGER: I think that there is an\nimportant distinction to be made between the\ngovernment's general interest in eradicating\ndiscrimination from the workplace and the government's\ninterest in ensuring that individuals are not chilled\nfrom coming to civil authorities with reports about\ncivil wrongs.\nBut if I could continue, I think that the --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: So, are you willing to\naccept the ministerial exception for substantive\ndiscrimination claims, just not for retaliation claims?\nMS. KRUGER: I don't think that those are\nthe only two sets of inquiries that are important in the\nbalancing. And if I could continue, I think the\ngovernment --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry. That was\na yes -- I think that question can be answered yes or\nno.\nMS. KRUGER: I think that that doesn't -- I\nthink the answer is no, in part because that doesn't\nfully account for all of the public and private\ninterests at stake. The government's interest extends\nin this case beyond the fact that this is a retaliation\nto the fact that this is not a church operating\ninternally to promulgate and express religious belief\ninternally. It is a church that has decided to open its\ndoors to the public to provide the service, socially\nbeneficial service, of educating children for a fee, in\ncompliance with State compulsory education laws.\nAnd this Court has recognized in cases like\nBob Jones that church-operated schools sit in a\ndifferent position with respect to the -- the\npermissible scope of governmental regulations than\nchurches themselves do.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Even with respect to their\nreligion classes and their theology classes? It's\nextraordinary.\nMS. KRUGER: Well, the government's --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Just because -- just\nbecause you have to comply with State education\nrequirements on secular subjects, your -- who you pick\nto -- to teach theology or to teach religion has to\nbe -- has to be subject to State control?\nMS. KRUGER: Justice Scalia, to be clear,\nthe government's interest in this case is not in\ndictating to the church-operated school who it may\nchoose to teach religion classes and who it may not. It\nis one thing and one thing only, which is to tell the\nschool that it may not punish its employees for\nthreatening to report civil wrongs to civil authorities.\nThat is an interest that we think overrides the burden\non the association's religious message about the virtues\nof internal dispute resolution as opposed to court\nresolution.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, you're making --\nyou're making a judgment about how important a\nparticular religious belief is to a church. You're\nsaying -- this may just be the same question Justice\nAlito asked -- but you're saying: We don't believe the\nLutheran Church when it says that this is an important\nand central tenet of our faith.\nMS. KRUGER: No, absolutely not, Mr. Chief\nJustice. We do not dispute -- when they assert that\nit's an important tenet, we assume its validity, we\nassume that they are sincere in that religious belief.\nBut just as in United States v. Lee, that sincere\nreligious belief was not sufficient to warrant an\nexemption from generally applicable tax laws, as in Bob\nJones, or --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: On the other hand,\nthe -- the belief of the Catholic Church that priests\nshould be male only -- you do defer to that, even if the\nLutherans say, look, our dispute resolution belief is\njust as important to a Lutheran as the all-male clergy\nis to a Catholic.\nMS. KRUGER: Yes. But that's because the\nbalance of relative public and private interests is\ndifferent in each case.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Do you believe, Ms. Kruger,\nthat a church has a right that's grounded in the Free\nExercise Clause and/or the Establishment Clause to\ninstitutional autonomy with respect to its employees?\nMS. KRUGER: We don't see that line of\nchurch autonomy principles in the Religion Clause\njurisprudence as such. We see it as a question of\nfreedom of association. We think that this case is\nperhaps one of the cases --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: So, this is to go back to\nJustice Scalia's question, because I too find that\namazing, that you think that the Free -- neither the\nFree Exercise Clause nor the Establishment Clause has\nanything to say about a church's relationship with its\nown employees.\nMS. KRUGER: We think that this is one of\nthe cases that Employment Division v. Smith may have\nbeen referring to when it referred to free association\nclaims that are reinforced by free exercise concerns.\nIt's certainly true that the association's claim to\nautonomy in this case is one that is deeply rooted. And\nconcerns about how it exercises its religion -- those\ntwo things merge in some ways in that respect. But --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't think they merge at\nall. Smith didn't involve employment by a church. It\nhad nothing to do with who the church could employ. I\ndon't -- I don't see how that has any relevance to this.\nI would -- I didn't understand your answer\nto the Chief Justice's question. You -- you say that\nthere were different institutional values or government\nvalues involved with respect to a -- to a Catholic\npriest than there is with respect to this Lutheran\nminister. Let's assume that a Catholic priest is -- is\nremoved from his duties because he married, okay?\nAnd -- and he claims: No, that's not the real reason;\nthe real reason is because I threatened to sue the\nchurch. Okay? So, that reason is just pretextual.\nWould you -- would you allow the government\nto go -- go into the -- into the dismissal of the\nCatholic priest to see whether indeed it -- it was\npretextual?\nMS. KRUGER: I think the answer is no,\nJustice Scalia --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why?\nMS. KRUGER: -- but that is the --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why is that any different\nfrom the Lutheran minister?\nMS. KRUGER: I would begin with looking at\nthe burdens on association under the balancing test. I\nthink that the core of the understanding of the\nministerial exception, as it was elaborated in the lower\ncourts, is that there is a fundamental difference\nbetween governmental regulation that operates to\ninterfere with the relationship between a church and\nthose who would govern it, those who would preach the\nword to the congregations, those who would administer\nits sacraments, on the one hand, and the more public\nrelationship between a church and a school teacher and\nothers that provide services to the public at large.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I think that's saying\nnothing different than what the Chief Justice suggests,\nthat you think the one is more -- is more important to\n-- to Catholics than the other is to Lutherans.\nMS. KRUGER: I don't think it's a question\nof the importance of either function to the -- the\nreligious association. It's a question of the realm\nof permissible governmental regulation.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes, but then you have to\nsay that it's more important to let people go to court\nto sue about sex discrimination than it is for a woman\nto get a job. I can't say that one way or the other.\nSo -- so, I'm stuck.\nAnd since I'm really -- this is tough and\nI'm stuck on this, I don't see how you can avoid going\ninto religion to some degree. You have to decide if\nthis is really a minister, for example, and what kind of\nminister. That gets you right involved. Or if you're\nnot going to do that, you're going to go look to see\nwhat are their religious tenets? And that gets you\nright involved.\nI just can't see a way of getting out of\nsomething -- of getting out of the whole thing. I don't\nsee how to do it. So, suppose you said in case of doubt\nlike that, we'll try what Congress suggested. And now\nwe have here a borderline case of ministry, not the\nheartland case. So, you say, all right, where you have\na borderline case the constitutional issue goes away,\nand what Congress said is okay. So, now what you have\nto prove is you have to prove that -- the church has to\nshow that the applicant was disciplined, or whatever,\nbecause she didn't conform to the religious tenets. All\nright? That's what they have to show.\nAnd I'm sorry; they maybe only make a prima\nfacie case, but they got to show it, and if they don't\nshow that there was at least some evidence to that\neffect and that somebody knew about the religious tenet\nand there was something like that -- maybe it's in the\nair, as is obvious with Justice Alito's question, but\nwhere it isn't in the air, you'd have to make a showing.\nNow -- now, I see that's an interference,\nbut I don't see how you avoid an interference someplace\nor the other. Otherwise, you're going to get into who\nis a minister.\nSo, what's the answer to this dilemma? At\nthe moment I'm making an argument for following what\nCongress said, go back and try it that way, and if they\ncan show in this case and she shows in this case nobody\never thought of the religious tenet, nobody told me,\nthey didn't read it, then she's going to win. And if\nthey come in and show that they really did this because\nof their religious tenet, they'll win. What about that?\nMS. KRUGER: Justice Breyer, I think that\nthat is a perfectly appropriate way to come at this\ncase, although it skips over sort of the initial\ninquiry, which is into whether or not the application of\nthe regulation to the particular employment relationship\nresults in an unwarranted interference.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, it does have the\nvirtue of deciding a statutory question before a tough\nconstitutional question. And I agree, with what we\nsometimes do, that seems bizarre, but I thought that was\nthe basic rule.\nMS. KRUGER: I think that that's absolutely\nright, Justice Breyer. And I think the next question\nbecomes, with respect to adjudicating a particular case,\nwhether deciding the case would require the court to\ndecide disputed matters of religious doctrine or to\nsecond-guess essentially subjective --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, if -- if the plaintiff\nproceeded that way, would she be entitled to -- I assume\nshe would -- introduce testimony by experts on\nLutheranism, theologians, professors of religion about\nhow the -- about this -- this tenet, and it isn't\nreally -- they might say, well, it's really not that\nstrong, and it once was, but it's faded, and it's not --\nit's not widely enforced.\nAnd then you'd have experts on the other\nside, and you'd have a court and a lay jury deciding how\nimportant this really is to Lutherans. Is that how that\nwould play out?\nMS. KRUGER: No, it's not how it would play\nout.\nJUSTICE ALITO: How are you going to avoid\nthat? I just don't see it.\nMS. KRUGER: Any inquiry into the validity\nof a particular religious doctrine is simply irrelevant\nto the adjudication of the dispute, which is designed to\nfind out just one thing, which is whether the --\nJUSTICE ALITO: No, it's not irrelevant.\nI've seen dozens and dozens and dozens of pretext cases,\nand in practically every pretext case that I've seen,\none of the central issues is whether the reason that was\nproffered by the employer is the real reason, is an\nimportant reason for that, for that employer, and\nwhether they really think it's important and whether\nthey apply it across the board. That's almost always a\nbig part of the case.\nAnd once you get into that, you're going to\nget into questions of -- of religious doctrine. I just\ndon't see it.\nLet me give you an example of a real case.\nA nun wanted to be -- wanted a tenured position teaching\ncanon law at Catholic University, and she claimed that\nshe was denied tenure because of her -- because of her\ngender.\nNow, there the university might argue, no,\nshe was -- and did argue -- she's denied tenure because\nof the quality of her -- of her scholarship. And, okay,\nnow, if you try that pretext issue, the issue is going\nto be what is the real quality of her canon law\nscholarship? And you're going to have the judge and the\njury decide whether the particular writings on canon law\nare -- make a contribution to canon law scholarship.\nHow can something like that be tried, without getting\ninto religious issues?\nMS. KRUGER: If the only way that the\nplaintiff has to show that that may not have been the\nemployer's real reason was a subjective judgment about\nthe quality of canon law scholarship, then judgment has\nto be entered for the employer, because the plaintiff\nhas no viable way, consistent with the Establishment\nClause, of demonstrating that wasn't the employer's real\nreason.\nIf, on the other hand, the plaintiff has\nevidence that no one ever raised any objections to the\nquality of her scholarship, but they raised objections\nto women serving in certain roles in the school, and\nthose roles were not ones that were required to be\nfilled by persons of a particular gender, consistent\nwith religious beliefs, then that's a case in which a\njudge can instruct a jury that it's job is not to\ninquire into the validity of the subjective judgment,\njust as juries are often instructed that their job is\nnot to determine whether an employer's business judgment\nwas fair or correct, but only whether the employer was\nmotivated by discrimination or retaliation.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMs. Kruger.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF WALTER DELLINGER\nON BEHALF OF THE PRIVATE RESPONDENT\nMR. DELLINGER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may\nit --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Dellinger.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Dellinger?\nMR. DELLINGER: Yes.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Could you assume for --\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE KAGAN: I'm sorry. Could you assume\nfor me that -- is it --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Justice Kagan.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE KAGAN: I feel like I missed\nsomething.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Dellinger, could you\nassume for me that there is a ministerial exception\nthat's founded in the Religion Clauses, and tell me who\ncounts as a minister, and why this commissioned minister\ndoes not count as a minister?\nMR. DELLINGER: I believe that there is an\nexemption grounded in the Religion Clauses. It means\nthat religious organizations will win -- will prevail in\nmany cases in which a comparable civil organization\nwould not prevail. I don't think that it makes sense to\napproach it in a categorical way of asking --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: I'm just asking you to\nassume with me for a moment that there is a categorical\nexception and to tell me who you think counts as a\nminister, and why the woman in this case does not.\nMR. DELLINGER: Well, in our view, if that\nwas the test, then we would say that the court of\nappeals was correct in holding that she was not a\nminister, and the reason -- the principal reason is she\ncarries out such important secular functions in addition\nto her religious duties in --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That can't -- I'm\nsorry to interrupt you, but that can't be the test. The\nPope is a head of state carrying out secular functions;\nright?\n(Laughter.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Those are important.\nSo, he is not a minister?\nMR. DELLINGER: Chief Justice Roberts, I do\nnot want to suggest that it's a very good approach to\ntry to decide who's a minister and who's not a minister.\nThat's what's wrong with Professor Laycock's categorical\napproach, because it's -- it's both over- and\nunder-inclusive. It sweeps in cases where there is, in\nfact, no religious reason offered --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's only a bad approach if\nwe adopt your test. Why isn't it a perfectly reasonable\ntest whether the person -- although the person may have\na lot of secular duties, whether the person has\nsubstantial religious responsibilities?\nMR. DELLINGER: And the reason that is not a\nsatisfactory test is that it fails to take account of\nthe important governmental interests -- for example, in\nthis case -- in having everyone have access to the -- to\nthe courts.\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, but that isn't -- but\nthat isn't the problem. The problem, it seems to me, is\nI don't know how substantial these interests are\nreligiously. I don't know how substantial the religion\nitself considers what they do from a religious\nperspective.\nSo, let's go back to Justice Alito's\nproblem. And now on the ministerial issue, we call the\nsynods, we call the how certain was it, how central is\nit to the heart of the religion, what they're actually\ndoing, and we replicate exactly what he said, in respect\nto the problem of religious tenet, now in respect to the\nproblem of religious minister.\nAnd maybe you can tell me we don't have to\ngo into the one or the other, but I've had enough of\nthese cases in the lower court to know they are really\nhard. People believe really different things, and I see\nno way to avoid going into one or the other, and,\ntherefore, I think, rather than try this constitutional\nmatter, let's go to the one Congress suggested.\nMR. DELLINGER: Well --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Now, what do you --\nthat's --\nMR. DELLINGER: If --\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's the state of the\nargument that you're walking into, I think.\nMR. DELLINGER: If we go to Congress,\nCongress made it quite clear how this case should be\nresolved, because Congress expressly did not apply the\nreligious exemptions of the ADA to retaliation.\nJUSTICE BREYER: No. I don't agree with\nthat. I think -- I think what it says is a religious\norganization may require that all applicants and\nemployees conform to the religious tenets. It put that\nin the section defining defenses. The defenses are part\nof the right, and when it forbids retaliation, it says\nforbids retaliation against an individual for the\nexercise of any right granted.\nAnd, therefore, I don't believe that a\nperson who has failed to violate the substantive section\ncould be held up normally.\nI mean, I don't --\nMR. DELLINGER: Well, we differ on that,\nbut --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I can think it's pretty\neasy to read that exception, even though it's in a\ndifferent subchapter, into the retaliation exception.\nAnd assume for me that that's so.\nMR. DELLINGER: It is still the case that it\nis a constitutional matter. The state's interest in\nallowing citizens to have access to its courts and to\nits agencies is paramount in cases like child abuse,\nreporting of school safety problems, and others. In\nthis case, it's -- we are mindful --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But it's not paramount.\nWould you -- take the firing of the Catholic priest\nexample. Does that get into the courts?\nMR. DELLINGER: No, it doesn't and the\nreason is --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why not?\nMR. DELLINGER: -- that there is -- and that\npoints out, Justice Scalia, that there are ample\ndoctrines to protect church autonomy. One is that under\nthe Establishment Clause, there can be no reinstatement\nordered by a court of someone to an ecclesiastical\nposition. Another mentioned by General Kruger is\nthat --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But he can sue for money,\nright?\nMR. DELLINGER: I -- I do not believe that\nhe can be reinstated or get damages for removal from\nthe -- from the priesthood.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Not reinstated. He can sue\nfor money. He can sue for, you know, the loss of --\nMR. DELLINGER: I think, in that case, that\nthat is very likely to fail because you're going to run\ninto (a) issues of religious doctrine or evaluations of\ndistinctly religious matters, like EEOC v. Catholic\nUniversity. Those doctrines still stand.\nThe problem with the -- this categorical\nexception is it sweeps in cases like this one, where the\nwell-pleaded complaint in this case simply says, I was\ndismissed from my employment because I said I was going\nto make a report to the EEOC. And she's not seeking\nreinstatement. She just wants the economic loss.\nThere's no need --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, if I could just come\nback to the example of the canon law professor, because\nI still don't see how the -- the approach that the\nSolicitor General is recognizing -- is recommending\ncould -- can eliminate the problems involved in pretext.\nSo, the -- as I understood her -- her answer, it was\nthat you couldn't look into the question of whether the\nprofessor's canon law scholarship was really good canon\nlaw scholarship, but you could try the issue of sex\ndiscrimination based on other evidence. So, maybe\nthere's some stray remarks here and there about a woman\nteaching canon law.\nNow, a response to that might be that wasn't\nthe real reason, and if you just look at the scholarship\nand you see how miserable it is and how inconsistent it\nis with church doctrine, you can see that that's the\nreal reason.\nSo, you just cannot get away from evaluating\nreligious issues.\nMR. DELLINGER: This is not a problem that\nis unique to ministerial employees, which is why this is\nboth over- and under-inclusive. When you -- this is a\ncircumstance in which an organization is going into the\npublic arena providing a public service, and in that\nsituation, it ought to be governed by the same rules --\nJustice Scalia, you said this case is not like\nEmployment Division v. Smith, but under Employment\nDivision v. Smith, we know that the State could forbid a\nschool from -- a religious school from using peyote in\nits ceremonies, but under Petitioner's submission, they\ncould fire any employee who reported that use of peyote\nto civil authorities, and that employee would have no\nrecourse.\nWe know that under U.S. v. Lee, an Amish\nemployer has to comply with the Social Security laws,\nbut under their submission, the employer could fire\nwithout recourse any employee who called noncompliance\nto the attention of the EEOC. We believe that -- that\nyou can trust to Congress on these hard areas where\nthere needs to be additional accommodations; Congress\ncould make them, just as Justice Scalia suggested. The\nministerial exemption has a long history, Justice Alito,\nbut in almost every circuit, it did not apply to\nteachers. So, I mean --\nJUSTICE ALITO: It antedated -- did it not\nantedate the enactment of the Americans with\nDisabilities Act?\nMR. DELLINGER: That is correct. When that\nwas enacted --\nJUSTICE ALITO: So, wouldn't -- shouldn't we\nassume that Congress -- that Congress assumed that it\nwould continue to apply to the ADA, just as it applied\nto Title VII.\nMR. DELLINGER: It -- in the lower courts\ndid not apply it as sweepingly as to teachers. And I --\nI think we have this debate with Justice Breyer about\nwhether -- whether you can say that Congress\nspecifically excluded retaliation -- retaliation cases.\nBut remember that that doctrine emerged at a\ntime when this Court had a position that religious\norganizations could not participate in getting public\nfunding, even when they were providing remedial services\nto low-income students. We repudiated that doctrine in\nAgostini v. Felton and where the Court said that you're\nentitled to participate in providing public services on\nthe same basis as all other organizations. That means\nthat you should comply, in some instances, with the same\nrules, when you leave the cloister and go into the\npublic arena and provide public services.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Gee whiz. Do -- do\nLutheran schools and Catholic parochial schools share\npublic funds the same way public schools do?\nMR. DELLINGER: No, they don't, Justice --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You bet you they don't.\nMR. DELLINGER: But they are entitled to.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What is this argument\nyou're making? I don't understand.\nMR. DELLINGER: Because we are no longer --\nwe are no longer of the -- of the Aguilar v. Felton era,\nthe pre-Employment Division v. Smith where we believe\nthat no governmental rules or involvement can be had\nwith these public institutions.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Don't tell me that fair is\nfair, that now, you know --\nMR. DELLINGER: No --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- we're just like\neverybody else. That's not true.\nMR. DELLINGER: It's that we have recognized\nin your opinion in Smith and in Justice Kennedy's\nopinion in Rosenberger the value of neutrality where you\nhave doctrines, as we recognize you do not second-guess\nreligious doctrine. You do not under the Establishment\nClause introduce someone into an ecclesiastical office,\nand you do a balancing test to make sure that there's a\nsufficient governmental interest, if you're going to\nundercut an organization's ability to convey its views.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.\nDellinger.\nMr. Laycock, 2 minutes.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DOUGLAS LAYCOCK\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. LAYCOCK: Two or three points very\nbriefly: The many distinctions and balancing tests in\ntheir argument show the mess you will be in if you try\nto decide these cases. And we may have a line-drawing\nproblem at the margin, but many, many cases are easy.\nThe priest, the rabbi, the bishop, the pastor of the\ncongregation cannot sue. Under their rule, they can\nsue --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Laycock, I'm not\nsure why the status of the individual matters under your\ntheory. It seems to me what you're saying is, so long\nas a religious organization gives a religious reason of\nany kind, genuine or not, for firing someone that's\nassociated with it, whether minister or not, that that\ninvokes the exception. Am I hearing your argument\nright?\nMR. LAYCOCK: No.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. So, why is\nthere a difference?\nMR. LAYCOCK: The position of minister is\ncategorically special because that is committed to the\nchurch in the system of separation of church and state.\nYou may have religious questions when they dismiss the\njanitor, but the level of sensitivity is not remotely\nthe same. And -- and --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, you would say with\njanitors, you can get into the pretext question.\nMR. LAYCOCK: The janitor can litigate his\npretext question. Yes.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, you're limiting your\ntest to whether that person is a minister. So, define\n\"minister\" for me again.\nMR. LAYCOCK: A minister is a person who\nholds ecclesiastical office in the church or who\nexercises important religious functions, most obviously\nincluding teaching of the faith.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Laycock, Mr. Dellinger\nhas some -- some points here about the way in which the\nministerial exception relates or doesn't relate to\nEmployment Division v. Smith. And it seems to me that\nin order to make an argument for the ministerial\nexception, you in some sense have to say that\ninstitutional autonomy is different from individual\nconscience, that we've said in Smith that state\ninterests can trump individual conscience. And you want\nus to say that they can't trump institutional autonomy.\nSo, why is that?\nMR. LAYCOCK: It's not that institutions are\ndifferent from individuals. It is that the\ninstitutional governance of the church is at a prior\nstep. Smith is about whether people can act on their\nreligious teachings after they're formulated. The\nselection of ministers is about the process by which\nthose religious teachings will be formulated.\nSmith distinguishes those cases --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Might not the Establishment\nClause have something to do with that question --\nMR. LAYCOCK: The Establishment Clause --\nwell, that --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- which applies to\ninstitutions?\nMR. LAYCOCK: That's the second answer --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Whereas the Free Exercise\nClause applies to individuals, right?\nMR. LAYCOCK: This Court has relied on both\nFree Exercise and Establishment: Serbian, Kedroff,\nKreshik, Gonzalez. There's a long line of cases all the\nway back to Watson distinguishing this problem from the\nproblem that culminates in Smith.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nCounsel.\n"
