KNEEDLER\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES\nMR. KNEEDLER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThese cases implicate the fundamental power of\nthe United States to protect its borders by excluding\naliens who arrive at its borders, but are found under the\nlaw not to qualify for admission.\nThis Court held more than 100 years ago in\nNishimura Ekiu that the power of a nation to forbid the\nentrance of foreigners within its dominions is inherent in\nsovereignty and is central to self-preservation. If it\nwere otherwise, the integrity of the Nation's borders and\nits security would be at the mercy of a foreign power who\nmight choose to foist aliens onto our country or to the\nself-help efforts of aliens who might leave another\ncountry coming to our shores. The migration crises\ninvolving Haitians and Cubans over the last 35 years\nvividly illustrate the adverse consequences of such a\nregime, and events of recent years confirm that the\nthreats to the Nation's borders and security are not\nlimited to nearby nations.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But this Court held only 3\nyears ago that the statute before us here does not permit\nthe Attorney General to hold the alien indefinitely.\nMR. KNEEDLER: The -- the Court addressed one of\nthe statutes before the Court here. It's -- it's\nimportant I -- I think to recognize another statute and -\nthat is -- reflects the background principle of this\nCourt's decision in Mezei. And if I may explain, to do\nthat.\nThis Court made clear in Mezei that an alien has\nno substantive due process right to enter the United\nStates when the executive branch has determined, under the\nlaw, that he has no right to enter the United States. The\nrelevant --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But, Mr. Kneedler, recognizing\nthat distinction, is that a distinction drawn by the\nstatute that's before us?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Yes, I believe it is, but it -\nbut -- but first of all, there is another statute which is\nhighly relevant to this, and that is 1182(d)(5)(A), the\nparole statute. It is the parole statute that -- that has\nlong governed whether an alien who arrives at our shores\nand has not been shown to be admissible may enter the\nUnited -- may enter the United States. The parole statute\nis set forth at petition appendix 3a -- excuse me -- page\n3a of our brief. That is the only statute that\naffirmatively authorizes aliens to enter the United\nStates. That statute is -- obviously confers no rights.\nIt is written entirely in terms of the discretion of the\nAttorney General, now the Secretary of Homeland Security.\nIt says the Attorney -- the Secretary may, in his\ndiscretion, temporarily under conditions that he\nprescribes and for urgent and humanitarian reasons, parole\nan alien into the United States. But it says that parole\ndoes not constitute an admission, and it may be revoked at\nany time when the Secretary in his opinion concludes that\nthe purposes of the parole have been satisfied.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So are you -- are you arguing\nnow that -- that (5)(A) -- (d)(5)(A), is the statute under\nwhich you are detaining him and that 1231(a)(6) has\nnothing to do with the case?\nMR. KNEEDLER: No. They -- they are independent\nauthorities for the detention -\nJUSTICE BREYER: So -- so you're arguing -- then\nyou are. You're saying -- this is coming to me a little\nbit anew. I perhaps didn't read it carefully enough. But\nI thought -- let's assume you lose on 1231(a)(6), that I\ncan't think of a way. Let's assume that I can't think of\na way of applying the same words to your alien to mean\nsomething different than were applied to the alien who was\nin Zadvydas. Suppose you lose on that point.\nNow you're saying, well, independently of that,\nwe have a different statute under which we can detain him,\nnamely 1182(d)(5)(A). Is that -\nMR. KNEEDLER: Yes, absolutely, and the -- and\nthe -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Now -- now is that argument -\nI mean, I'm sorry that I -\nMR. KNEEDLER: Yes, and we -- we make -- we do\nmake that argument in our brief.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- and that -- and so is that\nmade in the courts below and everything that they're doing\nin the cases -\nMR. KNEEDLER: Yes. We made it at -- we made it\nin both courts below, and we -- and we think it's clear\nfrom the background of -- of this statute that it does -\nthat it does confer independent authority.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But this statute just -- just\ngoes in a circle because it ends. The way end -- (A) ends\nis that after revoking the parole, the alien shall\nforthwith return or be returned to the custody from which\nhe was paroled and thereafter his case shall continue to\nbe dealt with in the same manner as that of any other\napplicant for admission to the United States, which refers\nyou back to -- to 1231(a)(6).\nMR. KNEEDLER: No. With respect, it doesn't.\n1231(a)(6) is an additional -- on its face is an\nadditional grant of detention authority. It is not -- but\nwhereas, the -- the parole authority which -- which for\nyears until -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, this shall continue to be\ndealt with in the same manner as that of any other\napplicant -\nMR. KNEEDLER: And an -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Dealt with includes, it seems\nto me, 1231(a)(6).\nMR. KNEEDLER: An applicant for admission\nincludes anyone who has been found not to be admissible to\nthe United States. 8 U.S.C. 1225(a)(1) provides that any\n-- any alien in the United States who has not\naffirmatively been found to be admissible is an applicant\nfor admission. And the -- the statutes dealing with\napplicants for admission or aliens who arrive at our shore\nestablish that detention, even indefinite detention, is -\nis not only permitted, but required unless the Secretary\nreleases someone.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: How would that -- how would\nthat apply to someone who hasn't gotten parole, hasn't\ngotten any permission, who snuck across the border?\nThat's one of the pieces of this that's incomprehensible,\nthat you are suggesting someone can be detained\nindefinitely who we allowed in temporarily, but such\ntreatment could not occur with respect to somebody that\nhad no permission at any time to be here.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Yes. Well, the -- the parole\nstatute -- if someone was taken into custody, the parole\n-- who had sneaked across the border, that person, under\nthe 1996 revisions, is an applicant for -- for admission,\nand the parole statute would govern that.\nAs a constitutional matter, and particularly\nwith respect to procedural due process, the Court has\nsuggested in a number of its cases that there may be a\ndifference between somebody who arrives at our borders and\n-- and is stopped and somebody who -- who sneaks through.\nAt least as a procedural matter, the Government would have\nto establish that he has no right to be here. But -\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But may I -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, are -- are you saying\nthat if an alien on -- who seeks admission and is denied\nadmission and is at Ellis Island or the JKF Airport, that\nthe Attorney General is -- does not have to consult\n1231(a)(6)?\nMR. KNEEDLER: No. We believe the parole\nstatute furnishes independent authority -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Where does it say -- I mean,\nthe reason I guess I missed it is because when I looked at\nyour table of contents and elsewhere in the brief, it\nseems phrased totally in terms of 1231(a)(6). That's the\nheading. Each argument seems to support that. And then\non page -- you know, when you refer to this, I guess on\npage 26, you're talking in a section about what 1231 must\nbe because of the structure of it. And then you refer to\nother provisions such as the one you're now mentioning. I\njust didn't pick up that it was a totally independent\nbasis.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Right. And -- and if I may, the\n-- the special statutes that govern the parole of Mariel\nCubans that we reproduce in the appendix to our brief at\n212.12 were promulgated in 1987 before 1231(a)(6) was\nenacted in 1996.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right, but where does it\nsay that? I'd like to just glance at it even now. Where\ndoes it say that in your brief, that it's a totally\nindependent basis?\nMR. KNEEDLER: On page 12 -- 26 to 27.\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's what I read and it was\nin a structure called the statutory and -- text and\nstructure support the Secretary's detention authority,\nwhich is under a bigger heading saying the text,\nstructure, and history of section 1231(a)(6) confirm the\nexecutive branch's authority.\nMR. KNEEDLER: I should -- I should also -\nJUSTICE BREYER: So perhaps I could be forgiven\nfor not understanding -\nMR. KNEEDLER: And -- and I should also point\nout that -- that in -- in our response to the petition in\nthe Benitez petition, we expressly -- we expressly argued\nthat 1182(d)(5)(A) is an independent source of authority.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But if -- if there's a statute\nthat directs you with reference to a class, that statute\nis applicable, and this person is within that class. So\nhow can you tell us we can't go or that we needn't go to\n1231?\nMR. KNEEDLER: My -- my point is that's not the\nexclusive basis. I'm not saying that it's inapplicable to\nthis category. But -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, it might be exclusive\nconstitutionally, but the Congress has acted.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Or -- or -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And once it's acted, you're\ncontrolled.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, or -- or -- but -- but what\nCongress -- if I may go back to the parole statute, before\n1231(a)(6) was enacted, the only statute that governed the\ndetention and the release of aliens arriving at our\nshores, what used to be called excludable aliens, was the\nparole statute. That provision -- until the aliens before\nthis Court were ordered -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: By which you mean -- parole\nstatute, by which you mean?\nMR. KNEEDLER: 1182(d)(5)(A). Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Okay.\nMR. KNEEDLER: And until there is an order of\nexclusion, even now the parole statute is the only statute\nthat governs the detention and release of the alien. And\nI think it would be impossible to read into 1182(d)(5)(A)\nany 6-month limitation or any limitation at all on how\nlong someone can be detained because that statute sets up\na presumption of custody with release only in the\ndiscretion of the Attorney General, or now the Secretary\nof -- of Homeland Security.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: May I interrupt you there, Mr.\nKneedler? Because I mean, the question is whether\nconstitutionally we should respect that presumption. And\n-- and my -- my question basically is this. I can\nperfectly well understand and I can understand the -- the\nargument for respecting that presumption. When you're\ndealing with excluded aliens who are in a literal\nterritorial sense within the border but are never allowed,\nin effect, beyond a point of initial custody, the ones who\nare kept at Ellis Island or wherever one may -- may keep\nthem.\nIt is difficult, however, I -- I think to accept\nwhat has been called the -- the fiction of custody. When\nwe are dealing with individuals who, although absolutely\nexcludable, were nonetheless welcomed into the United\nStates by a public announcement of the President of the\nUnited States, have been allowed into the American\npopulation, just as clearly and as readily as they would\nhave been under any other protocol of admission -- and I\nguess in this case for something like 20 years -- isn't\nthere a point at which the -- the fiction of exclusion\nsimply cannot be accepted for constitutional purposes?\nMR. KNEEDLER: There are a number of responses\nto that. First, as a factual matter, with respect to\nwelcoming into the United States, what gets cited for that\nproposition is a statement by President Carter in May 5 of\n1980. 10 days later, before the aliens in this case came\nto this country, he made clear that people should not do\nthis. He encouraged people not to go to Cuba. The INS\nbrought enforcement actions against people who went there.\nThere were criminal prosecutions that were brought. So\npeople were not encouraged to come to the United States in\nthis way.\nWith respect to the regime that you say -- I\nbelieve you said they're -- they're admitted just like\nunder any other regime. That is not correct.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, factually. They're\nallowed into the country. You know, they can get jobs,\nown property, et cetera.\nMR. KNEEDLER: They were allowed into the\ncountry under the parole statute that I just read, which\nmakes -- which makes it clear that they are admitted not\n-- not in a way that confers any rights on them, but they\nare admitted in the interest of the United States for\npublic benefits under circumstances which make clear that\nit is not an admission and that -\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No. I realize but they are\nadmitted in the sense that they say, okay, you can come in\nand you can do these things, but you get no -- in effect,\nyou get no vested right. We can take it away like that.\nMR. KNEEDLER: No -- no vested right to come\ninto the United States. It is, in effect, a revocable -\nJUSTICE SOUTER: All right. But otherwise -\notherwise they are treated like any other class of aliens\nwho are admitted into the United States. They are subject\nto this condition. The United States makes that clear,\nbut they nonetheless can be in the country and do in the\ncountry what other aliens can do.\nMR. KNEEDLER: At the sufferance of the United\nStates.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I -- I know. Subject to that\ncondition.\nMR. KNEEDLER: And -- and the question we have\nhere is when the -- when and if the United States,\npursuant to this statute, decides no longer to suffer the\naliens being at large, but instead return them to the\nborder, in effect, or return them to detention, this\nstatute makes clear that that -- that whatever practical\nexperience they have had at large in the country is always\nsubject to revocation -\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No. I -- I realize that, but\nthe problem is you've got a Due Process Clause that talks\nabout persons not citizens. Maybe I can understand the -\nthe fiction that says it doesn't apply to these persons\nif, for practical purposes, we stop them at the border and\nwe don't let them into society. Once we do let them into\nsociety, whether we say it's subject to this condition it\ncan be revoked or not, I find it difficult to see a\nconstitutional warrant for drawing the line that you want\nus to draw.\nMR. KNEEDLER: This Court has always treated as\nthe same the custody of an alien who arrives at the border\nand has not been admitted, whether that person stays on\nthe boat, goes to Ellis Island, which the Court said was\nnot an entry that gave somebody constitutional rights to\ncome here. In the Kaplan v. Tod case, you had the example\nof a person who was paroled for 9 years and regarded as\nnot being in the United States. And what the -\nJUSTICE SOUTER: You're giving me prior\nexamples, but the issue here is should we continue to\nrespect that -- what has been called that fiction as to\npeople who are allowed into the country and are allowed to\nmove around like other aliens and, indeed, and by and\nlarge like citizens.\nMR. KNEEDLER: With respect, I think it is not\n-- it is not a fiction with respect to the constitutional\nissue because there's a critical difference between, for\nexample, a lawful permanent resident -- a person does not\nacquire lawful permanent resident status by something like\nadverse possession, by living in the United States for a\nlong period of time. It is an affirmative grant of status\nfor permission to reside permanently in the United States.\nIt is a grant of a status -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Which can be revoked. Which\ncan be revoked, and that's the -- the distinction that\nseems to me strange. When somebody commits a deportable\noffense, they are stripped of whatever right they had to\nbe here. They are, it seems to me, in the same boat as\nsomeone who is excludable. They -- they do -- do not have\nany right to remain no more than a parolee has. We have\ntaken away their right to remain. So it seems to me that\nthey have no status anymore based on a prior admission\nthat we have removed from them.\nMR. KNEEDLER: This Court -- this Court thought\notherwise in -- in Zadvydas 3 years ago where it drew a\ndistinction. It said the distinction between someone who\nhas never entered the country and someone who has effected\nan entry -\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's true. That's true.\nAbsolutely we did.\nAnd also, I'll assume for argument's sake that\nyou're completely right on the constitutional point.\nThat's just for argument's sake. But assume you are. So\nthere's all kinds of constitutional difference.\nStill, I don't see how to read the statute one\nway for one group of people and another way for another.\nThe statutory words in Zadvydas, the words that the\nAttorney General may detain this individual beyond the\nremoval period, are read in Zadvydas to mean beyond the\nremoval period -- may detain beyond the removal period\nmeans for a reasonable time, presumably 6 months,\npresumptively, related -- reasonable time related to the\npurpose of the statute which is to find a country willing\nto accept them. Okay?\nNow, I haven't found a single case of this Court\nwhere you interpret these complicated words one way for\none and another way for another. My law clerk found a\ncouple of cases, Communications Work v. Bett and\nMachinists v. Street, where in Bett particularly the Court\nstrongly implies the contrary. It says you can't read\nwords differently just because we interpreted in one -\nyou know, one statute, they were interpreted in light of\nconstitutional considerations, and now we have -- those\nconstitutional considerations aren't here, but it's the\nsame words. You have to apply it the same.\nMR. KNEEDLER: But -- but, with respect, the\nCourt did not construe any word in this statute to impose\nthe limitation that you're describing. The -- the way the\nCourt posed the question was does it -- does it\naffirmatively grant a power for detention of these aliens\nin these circumstances. At the very beginning of the\nCourt's opinion, the Court put to one side -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's an interpretation.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Pardon me?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It says -- that's an\ninterpretation.\nMR. KNEEDLER: But -- but -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It says the statute does not\nconfer power to hold beyond a reasonable period.\nMR. KNEEDLER: But -- but the -- the mode of\nanalysis of the Court -- it starts with the introduction\nto the Court's opinion, and this is at page 682. It says\n-- of -- of Zadvydas. We deal here with aliens who are\nadmitted, aliens who have not yet -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes, yes. That's right.\nMR. KNEEDLER: No. But -- but that -- that's\nsetting the Court -- the case up. But then what the Court\nsays, in terms of how it interprets the statute, we\nconstrue the statute to contain an implicit reasonable\ntime limitation, the application of which is subject to\nFederal court review. Well, what is a reasonable time\ndepends upon the circumstances.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well -- well, yes, but what -\nwhat -- we put in the presumptively 6 months, but we said\nin our view the statute, read in light of the\nConstitution's demands, limits an alien's post-removal\nperiod detention to a period reasonably necessary to bring\nabout that alien's removal from the United States. It\ndoes not permit indefinite detention interpreting it to\navoid constitutional threat. We include that once removal\nis no longer reasonably foreseeable, continued detention\nis no longer authorized by statute.\nNow, I don't know what those sentences are doing\nunless they're interpreting the words I mentioned. And\nthen later in the opinion, we say it's presumptively -\nMR. KNEEDLER: No. What -- what -\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- not always, but\npresumptively 6 months.\nMR. KNEEDLER: What -- what the -- what the\nCourt was doing was -- the -- the standard that the Court\nannounced at the beginning of its opinion was a reasonable\n-- a reasonable time limitation, the application of which\nis subject to court review. As applied to permanent\nresident aliens, the Court saw a -- a constitutional\nproblem and, in that situation, came up with a presumptive\n6-month rule.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, it interpreted the\nstatute as doing it. Now, that brings me back to the\noriginal question.\nMR. KNEEDLER: No. No, I don't believe -- with\n-- with respect, what -- what I believe the Court said was\nthat there is a reasonable time limitation. And given the\n-- given the distinction that runs throughout immigration\nlaws, this Court said at page 2500 of the Supreme Court\nReports in this decision, the distinction between aliens\nwho arrive at our borders and are governed by Mezei, as\nopposed to people who enter, runs throughout our\nimmigration law, I would think that it would run\nthroughout 1231(a)(6).\nJUSTICE SOUTER: All right. I can -- I can\nagree with you that the different classes are going to\nimplicate different considerations on what is reasonable.\nBut you, as I understand it, go the further step and say\nthere is a presumption, and perhaps an irrebuttable\npresumption, that in the case of the -- the legally\nexcluded, even though they are, in fact, in the country,\nthe -- the presumptive reasonable period is forever.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And that's where -- it's that\nstretch that's giving us the trouble.\nMR. KNEEDLER: And -- first of all, the Court\ndoesn't have to decide that in this case because we have a\nregime where each of the aliens before this Court, came\nhere, was paroled -\nJUSTICE SOUTER: That's true, but we've got to\nsay something.\nMR. KNEEDLER: But if -- if I may go to the\nMezei case, what the Court said there is that the\ndetention of the alien on Ellis Island was effectuating\nhis exclusion. The two cannot be distinguished from one\nanother.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, Mr. Kneedler, do you\nmind telling us whether the record shows where Martinez\nand Benitez are now? Where are they?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Benitez has been released to a\nhalf-way house. We sent the Court a letter -\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: That's what I thought.\nMR. KNEEDLER: -- last week showing that the\nreview process under these regulations actually works.\nIt's been working for 15 years. And as we explain in our\nbrief, more than 9,000 people have been granted parole\nhere.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: So is that case basically\nmoot? Benitez's?\nMR. KNEEDLER: He hasn't been -- he hasn't been\n-- I think he's still in -- in custody. Whether -- if -\nif he -- if he completes that and is released, a question\nof mootness may arise at that point.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Where's Martinez?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Martinez was released pursuant to\nthe court -- district court order almost 2 years ago, and\nhe's -- he's now at large under an order of supervision.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Kneedler -\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Now, if I can continue for\njust a moment and then I'll stop. There is a new statute,\n1226(a) of title 8, part of the Patriot Act, which allows\ndetention of aliens who threaten our safety or security.\nPresumably that is an option if either of these people is\nseen to do that.\nMR. KNEEDLER: If -- if there's an -- if there\nis an individualized reason to believe that an alien would\nbe a terrorist or -- or a threat to the security in that\nrespect, but the threat to the -\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: And that's available, is it\nnot?\nMR. KNEEDLER: That -- that's available, but the\nthreat to the national security here is much larger than\nthat. If -- again, if we go back to the immigration\ncrises involving Haiti and Cuba, there -- there is a\nthreat to the national security when another nation can\nfoist aliens onto our shores, and -- and -\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask you about -\nMR. KNEEDLER: -- if the United States had no\nability to -- to deflect -\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Kneedler, can I ask you a\nquestion, forgetting the statutes for a moment -- I -\nwhich we've already covered at some length? Just going to\nyour constitutional position, it's clear that a person\nwho's not been admitted and has been paroled could be\nexcluded forthwith, summarily, and so forth because he's\nnever been admitted. But does that person have any\nprotection under the Constitution? Could we shoot him?\nMR. KNEEDLER: No, no, surely. What -- the -\nthe -\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Then what is the protection\nunder the Constitution that deals -- is it the Due Process\nClause?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Whatever right -- in -- in a\ncriminal prosecution the Bill of Rights would apply to\nthat person.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Is he -- is he a person within\nthe meaning -\nMR. KNEEDLER: Yes. We -- our position is not\nthat he's -- not that he's not a person. The question is\nwhat -- is what process is due.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And is he a person who has a\nright to liberty, entitled to some protection, very, very,\nvery minimal, but there is some protection to that -- that\nindividual.\nMR. KNEEDLER: It -- depending upon the context.\nThe one protection for liberty he does -\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, the context is he got\noff a boat. We couldn't -- but Cuba won't take him back\nor -- or whatever -- wherever he came from. They can't.\nAnd the only thing we can do to keep him out of the\ncountry is to keep him in jail.\nMR. KNEEDLER: He has no substantive due process\nright to be released into the United States.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: He -- he doesn't have a right\nto be released. But -- but you do not contend that we\ncould kill him.\nMR. KNEEDLER: No, absolutely not. Absolutely\nnot.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: He does have some -- some\nminimal protection under the Constitution.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Absolutely not. The formulation\n-- and this was used in -- in the Court's decision in\nLandon v. Plasencia. The -- the question is there are no\nconstitutional rights in connection with his admission to\nthe United States. And admission means, I think, both\nformal granted admission and practical admission or entry.\nA person cannot -\nJUSTICE BREYER: A person who runs in illegally,\na person who crosses the border illegally, say, from\nMexico is entitled to these rights when you catch him.\nMR. KNEEDLER: He's entitled to procedural due\nprocess rights. We don't believe he -- that person has\nany more substantive due process right to remain at large\nin the United States.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But you -- you -- I thought\nthere was a reg of the INS.\nMR. KNEEDLER: No. With -- with -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Am I not right?\nMR. KNEEDLER: With -- with respect to the -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Tell me if I'm right.\nMR. KNEEDLER: With respect to the regulations,\nbut -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Can I say what it is?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Yes, I'm sorry.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I thought there was a reg -- to\nbe sure we're talking about the same thing -- where the\nINS has said that Zadvydas applies to individuals who run\ninto the United States illegally from Mexico. Am I right\nabout that?\nMR. KNEEDLER: The -- the INS has -- or now DHS\nhas applied it. I -- I don't know that there's an\nanalysis in there that says Zadvydas requires it. I don't\nthink the -- either the statute or particularly the\nConstitution would give somebody who sneaks across our\nborder a right to remain here, a substantive due process\nright to be here. Maybe procedural rights would be\ndifferent, but a substantive -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But is that the current\nINS -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Kneedler, may I -- may I\ntry to get in the question I did earlier? Is -- is 8\nU.S.C., section 1182(d)(5) -- was -- was that applicable\nin Zadvydas, as it's applicable here?\nMR. KNEEDLER: No, because those were lawful\npermanent residents whose -- whose lawful permanent\nresidency had -- had -- they came in under a grant of\nlawful permanent residency.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So this is a new string to your\nbow in this case.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Yes, because these aliens entered\nthe United States only -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But it wouldn't -- it\nwouldn't apply to the illegal alien because it's a statute\nthat governs parole and they're not paroled into the\nUnited States.\nMR. KNEEDLER: But someone -- someone who would\nbe picked up would be an applicant for admission and could\nbe released under this -- under this statute. But -- but\nfocusing here on the people excluded at the border -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: How does that -\nMR. KNEEDLER: -- this is the only way someone\ncould -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: How does that make that\nperson, the illegal entrant, a parolee?\nMR. KNEEDLER: He would be an applicant for\nadmission, and the -- I -- I believe -- I believe I'm\ncorrect on that.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Suppose he says, I don't want\nto apply for admission. I just don't want to be locked\nup.\nMR. KNEEDLER: The act treats him as an\napplicant for admission under 1225(a)(1).\nMr. Chief Justice, if I may\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Very well, Mr.\nKneedler.\nMs. Dahl, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF CHRISTINE S. DAHL\nON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT MARTINEZ\nMS. DAHL: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please\nthe Court:\nBecause the same words mean the same thing in\nthe same statute, this Court need not reach the\nconstitutional questions presented by the indefinite\ndetention of inadmissible as opposed to deportable aliens.\nWithout going to questions of constitutional doubt, there\nare three reasons why this Court should hold that section\n1231(a)(6) treats inadmissible aliens the same as it\ntreats deportable aliens.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Before you get to that, do you\nthink that that's the only statute applicable here? What\nabout 1182(d)(5)? What's your response to the\nGovernment's assertion that that's an independent basis?\nMS. DAHL: Justice Scalia, I don't believe it\nprovides an independent basis for detention. The\nimmigration law works together in it's various elements,\nand section 1182, when parole is revoked, treats the alien\nthen as an applicant for admission, and section 1229\nplaces the applicant for admission into removal\nproceedings.\nThe Government did not obtain a ruling on that\nargument from the Ninth Circuit, although it made\nreference to 1182 in its motions to stay the briefing\nschedule. It ultimately conceded that this case was\ncontrolled by Lin Guo Xi, which was a statutory\nconstruction of 1231(a)(6), and cert was granted on the\n1231(a)(6) issue only.\nThe reading of the statute that we proffer, that\nthe same words mean the same meaning, is consistent with\nthe overall changes Congress made in 1996 in IIRIRA when\nit eliminated the category of excludable aliens and\nreplaced it with a single, broader category, now called\nremovable aliens, that embraces both inadmissible and\ndeportable aliens.\nThird, Congress knows how to provide for\nindefinite detention when it wants to.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Well, how do you\nexplain then, Ms. Dahl, the language in the Court's\nZadvydas opinion that had, were we dealing with, in\neffect, off-shore aliens, this would be a much different case?\nMS. DAHL: I believe it would present a\ndifferent question, but the constitutional issues\npresented by indefinite detention remain. The Court\ndoesn't need to reach those --\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: So you say that a\nperson, even though they're not lawfully admitted into the\nUnited States, still couldn't be indefinitely detained.\nMS. DAHL: Yes, Your Honor, that is our -- our\npoint precisely. The Government was not correct when it\nsaid that it -- that this Court has always treated\nexcludable aliens the same. In a case that was a\ncontemporary of the Mezei decision, Kwong Hai Chew, cited\nat page 45 of our brief, the Court found that an\nexcludable entrant on Ellis Island was entitled to -\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Well, the Government\ndistinguishes that case. What do you make of their\ndistinction?\nMS. DAHL: We disagree. I think that it shows\nthat the Court will consider length of time in the country\nin determining what amount of due process is required.\nNow, the plain language of the statute of\n1231(a)(6) requires the same treatment between\ninadmissible and deportable aliens. Where there's no\ndifference in the language that Congress has used, this\nCourt can draw no distinctions.\nThere is a presumption that Congress expects its\nstatutes to be read in the same manner as the Supreme\nCourt's interpretation, and because of the\ninterrelationship between the parole statute and the\nrevocation proceedings and removability proceedings,\nthere's no reason for this Court to resort to the 1182\nstatute to provide the authority that the Government\nseeks. The relevant authority is section 1231(a)(6).\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, what do you think we\nshould do with the 1182? Because suppose you prevail on\nyour argument that it's the same statute, the same word,\nit can't be construed differently under 12-whatever, and\nthe Government says fine. We now go to the other string\nin our bow and we continue to detain this person on the\nbasis of 1182(d)(5)(A).\nMS. DAHL: Well, the 1182(d)(5)(A) doesn't\nprovide for indefinite detention. What it provides is\nthat upon revocation of parole, the alien is placed into\nremoval proceedings. Once the removal proceedings have\nbeen determined and a final order of removal is entered,\n1231(a) requires removal within 90 days, and failing that,\nthe appropriate -- the relevant statutory provision is\n1231(a)(6). That says that the alien may be detained\nbeyond the removal period and then, if released, subjected\nto conditions of supervision. 1231 is the only statutory\nauthority for post-removal period detention. Parole deals\nwith entry and 1231(a)(6) -\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, but you haven't\nanswered, I think, the question of whether the Government\nis entitled in this case, if we dispose of the 1231\nquestion, to resort to the other statute.\nMS. DAHL: I don't think that the Court could\ncarve out a statute and use it in a way contrary to the\nway it functions in the immigration scheme and make\nsuperfluous or irrelevant a more express, more detailed\nstatutory provision.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, what you're saying is\nthat even if 1182 comes first, 1231 comes second.\nMS. DAHL: Precisely, Your Honor. And I don't\nthink that the Government could revoke parole and then\nsuspend proceedings to determine the admissibility of a\nparolee indefinitely.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But still, is this another -\ncould -- could we do this? I noticed that -- that your -\nthe petition for cert in Benitez has two questions, both\nof which are about interpreting 1231(a)(6). The\nGovernment's petition, though not its brief -- the\nGovernment's petition in Crawford says the question\npresented is whether 1231(a)(6) in Zadvydas compelled a\nrelease. So this other -- this other matter is a totally\n-- seen as a totally separate ground. Perhaps the thing\nto do is we send it back, and if they want to raise it,\nthey can raise it, and it would be up to the circuit to\ndecide whether they had preserved it or not preserved it.\nIs that -- is that a sensible thing?\nMS. DAHL: I don't think so because I don't\nthink that 1182 allows the interpretation that the\nGovernment -\nJUSTICE BREYER: And that's your view of -- of\nwhat 1182 means, and they're going to have a different\nview. If they want to argue their different view, they\ncould do it in the Ninth Circuit. If they've waived it,\nthey've waived it, and that's up to them, not up to us.\nMS. DAHL: What the Ninth Circuit found, though,\nin questions of an inadmissible alien, that this Court's\nconstruction of 1231(a)(6) in Zadvydas applied and there\nwould be no need for resort to any other statute.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask if you believe the\nsupervision after the 90-day period covered in\nsubparagraph 3 -- is there -- can that continue\nindefinitely in your view?\nMS. DAHL: Yes. While the alien is awaiting\nremoval, he is subject to supervision conditions that will\nsafeguard the Government's interests, and for as long as\nhe is waiting, he is under supervision.\nIt's those supervision conditions that\ndistinguish this case from the situation where the\nGovernment is finding national security risks. That -\nCongress has expressly provided for the indefinite\ndetention of people whom the Attorney General certifies as\npresenting risks to national security.\nIt's also the presence of a national security\nrisk that distinguishes this case from the Mezei decision.\nI think that the Government makes more of that decision\nthan needs to be made in order to find that Mr. Benitez\nand Mr. Martinez are in different situations. They were\nallowed into this country. They have lived here for 24\nyears, and -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: How long had the -- the\ndetainee in, however you pronounce it, Mezei lived in the\nUnited States?\nMS. DAHL: Mr. Mezei had been in the United\nStates for 25 years before he left, and he was gone for an\nextended period of time. When he sought to return, he was\ntreated as if he were an initial entrant, and the\nGovernment, citing national security, excluded him without\na hearing and refused to disclose the evidence that was\nthe basis for the exclusion. He challenged that and\nwanted a hearing and wanted the Attorney General to be\nrequired to disclose the evidence. The Court found that\nhis release into the community itself would present a\nsecurity risk and therefore sustained the denial of the\nhearing and the detention of Mr. Mezei.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, I don't think it really\nsaid they -- they found there was a security risk. They\n-- they held the Government did not have to explain\nbecause the man had no right to come in.\nMS. DAHL: That's correct.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: What's -- what's your best\nanswer to the Government's argument that unless you treat\nthis case differently from Zadvydas, at least for purposes\nof reasonable time or reasonable interest, which affects\ntime, the United States is basically defenseless against\ncountries that -- that want to dump undesirable aliens and\nforce them into the United States?\nMS. DAHL: I don't think that applying the\nstatute, as it's written, leaves the Government\ndefenseless.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Because.\nMS. DAHL: Congress can pass another statute, if\nit needs to, and the Government -\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But it's defenseless under the\npresent law?\nMS. DAHL: I disagree. We have -\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Then what is the defense?\nMS. DAHL: We have very effective means of\ninterdicting --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: What are they?\nMS. DAHL: Well, after the Mariel boatlift, the\nGovernment changed its policy and now intercepts people\nwho are coming from Cuba by boat and detains them at\nGuantanamo Bay, does a screening, and has a more effective\nrepatriation process for people that they do not want to\ncome in.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: You want us to take -\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So you're saying they can\nactually exclude, in practical terms.\nMS. DAHL: Yes. That's exactly what -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: You want us to take judicial\nnotice that the Mexican border and American border is\nimpervious?\n(Laughter.)\nMS. DAHL: I think that would present a\ndifferent question. As the Government acknowledged,\npeople who come into the country without inspection are\nentitled, under the Government regulations, to the\nprotections under Zadvydas. And -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And there's no -- and -- and\nthere's no answer to Justice Souter's question with regard\nto people who -- who -- once they enter that way. Right?\nMS. DAHL: Well, the Government has -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Except a new statute.\nMS. DAHL: Well, Congress has -- has, by\ndefinition, treated those people as inadmissible aliens\nwho are subject to removal proceedings. And the\ninterdiction methods are -- they're purely political\ndecisions that the Government needs to make.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But they -- in any case, those\nindividuals are not the subject of sort of dumping action\nby their own governments.\nMS. DAHL: That's correct, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Does the -- Congress has passed\na special statute with respect to terrorism, hasn't it,\nwhere it does authorize detention of any of these people\nwho are engaged in terrorism. Now, I don't know how\nthat's defined. Is that defined to relieve in a way\nthat's broad enough to relieve some of the problem?\nMS. DAHL: Well, if -- well, first of all, the\nGovernment has the ability to detain, pending the removal\nproceedings, of people who are trying to come into the\ncountry. The question becomes if they can't be\nrepatriated. Now, the Patriot Act in 1226(a) does allow,\nin instances of national security, for the Attorney\nGeneral to indefinitely detain. Now, importantly, that\nstatute provides for procedural protections and judicial\nreview, that is absent from -\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: But are -- are the\npeople here charged with any sort of terrorist activities?\nThey were committed -- convicted of crimes, but I -- I\ndidn't think they were connected with terrorist\nactivities.\nMS. DAHL: That's correct. The Government has\nnot made any allegation that there's -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Just normal, harmless\ncriminals.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Right?\n(Laughter.)\nMS. DAHL: Their release from prison presents\nthe same issues that the release of any person who has\nserved the sentences that were imposed after the\ncommission of a crime.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Well, except that with\naliens, they can be deported, whereas a citizen can't be,\nupon release from prison.\nMS. DAHL: That's correct. And the conditions\nof supervision that the Government can impose are much\nlengthier and could be even more onerous than the kinds of\nsupervision conditions after prison that the Government\ncould impose on its citizens.\nIn this case, Mr. Martinez and Mr. Zadvydas both\nreceived permission to live here. Both committed crimes.\nBoth served their sentences and both were ordered removed.\nNothing in section 1231(a)(6) warrants making Mr. Martinez\nwait for removal in a Federal prison perhaps for the rest\nof his life, while Mr. Zadvydas awaits removal after\nhaving been released -\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: I thought the other person\nwas named Benitez. I thought we had Zadvydas in the other\ncase. Do we have two, a Martinez and a Benitez, here?\nMS. DAHL: Yes, Your Honor. I was drawing a\ncomparison between the situation with Mr. Zadvydas and Mr.\nMartinez.\nDetention, of course, needs to be reasonably\nrelated to its purpose. Here removal cannot be achieved.\nSo detention for that purpose becomes arbitrary and\npunitive, and we'd ask the Court to affirm the grant of\nhabeas corpus and Mr. Martinez's release on supervision\nconditions.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Ms. Dahl.\nMr. Mills, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN S. MILLS\nON BEHALF OF PETITIONER BENITEZ\nMR. MILLS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please\nthe Court:\nI think that we have lost sight of the statutory\nscheme that applies here. Section 1182(d)(5)(A) is not a\ndetention statute. It's clearly not preserved as an\ninitial matter. It was not in the answer to either habeas\npetition. The justification given in the district court\nin both cases was 1231(a)(6).\nBut, Justice Breyer, there is no need to remand\nthis case because a clear, simple reading of the\nimmigration statutes demonstrates that 1182 is not a\ndetention statute. You have to go through the process,\nand I attempted to do this in my reply brief, but I think\nI can do it a little bit more clearly for the Court this\nmorning.\nWhen an alien first arrives, he's an applicant\nfor admission. Section 1225(b)(2)(A) of title 8, United\nStates Code says an applicant for admission -- any\napplicant for admission shall be detained until the\nremoval proceeding unless it is clear, beyond any doubt,\nthat they are entitled to come in. So all aliens, when\nthey apply -- that's the detention statute that initially\napplies, 1225(b)(2)(A). They are to be detained until\nthere is a removal proceeding. The removal proceeding,\nwhich is governed by 1229(a)(1) -- I'm sorry -- 1226(a) -\nit is 1229(a) -- is to determine whether the alien is\nadmissible or not, whether they should come in or whether\nthey must be removed. So 1225(b)(2)(A) says detain until\nthat point.\n1182(d)(5)(A) then comes in to authorize the\nGovernment to stop that process for humanitarian reasons\nand parole an alien in. We won't have the removal\nprocess. We're going to -- we -- we're going to get out\nof the detention in 1225(b)(2)(A), and we're going to let\nyou out on parole, which is discretionary. That's\n1182(d)(5)(A).\nIf at any time, we in our discretion think it is\nno longer appropriate to keep you on parole, we can revoke\nthat parole, and the statute 1182(d)(5)(A) says once\nparole is revoked, the alien is treated as, quote, any\nother applicant for admission. So you go back to\n1225(b)(2)(A), which says detain them until the removal\nproceeding.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, you -- you skipped a -- a\nphrase. It says when the Attorney General is of the\nopinion that the purposes of the parole justify nothing\nmore, the individual shall return or be returned to the\ncustody from which he began. And their argument is that\ncustody is different in these cases.\nMR. MILLS: That custody is the custody under\n1225(b)(2)(A). That is the statute that authorizes the\ncustody. That's what they're being returned to.\n1225(b)(2)(A) is detention until the removal proceedings.\nAnd in the Demore v. Kim case, this case -- this Court\nsaid that even if it's a long time and there aren't other\nprocedures in place, you can be detained until your\nremoval order is entered because -- and -- and the\nemphasis was there's an end date to that. So there's an\nend date to detention under (b)(2)(A), 1225(b)(2)(A), and\nit's the removal proceedings.\nSection 1231 is the statute that governs removal\nand says, okay, now what happens? It says you have to\nremove within 90 days, but for certain aliens who've\ncommitted crimes or are inadmissible or are otherwise\ndetermined to be dangerous, we can detain them beyond. It\nsays may be detained beyond the period. That is the only\nstatute that authorizes any detention of an alien after a\nremoval order other than the specific terrorist statute,\n1226(a), which was enacted, which does not authorize\nindefinite detention. It says -- it has a paragraph\nlabeled indefinite detention, and it says the Government\nshall not indefinitely detain a terrorist alien that it\ncannot remove except that if the Government determines -\nand -- and it appears to put the burden on the Government\n-- that the person is a danger to national security or the\ncommunity, it can detain them for another 6 months. And\nthen you -- you could have indefinite detention, but each\ntime, each 6 months, the statute provides for review.\nSo not only do the sneakers, the aliens who\ncross across the border in the -- in the dark of night\nfrom Mexico or wherever -- not only do they under the\nGovernment's own admission have the Zadvydas rights, so\ntoo do terrorist aliens by statute. And to suggest that\nby some implication Congress has intended to authorize the\nindefinite detention of people that we thought we should\nwelcome into our country, even though we didn't have the\nability under our quota system and under our current\nregulations in 1980 to let them in, somehow they have no\nrights against indefinite detention.\nFor the Government to -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: How do you -- how do you\nanswer the Government's argument that this is necessary,\nthat the United States shouldn't effectively be punished\nfor being humanitarian, and if we can't hold these people,\nif we're forced to let them in, then any rogue nation can\ndump anyone it wants on the United States and we can't\nstop it?\nMR. MILLS: Yes, Your Honor. Justice Ginsburg,\nthat's their sole policy argument, and frankly, it doesn't\nhold water. Just yesterday in the Jama case, the\nGovernment took the position that if Mexico flooded -\nflooded our borders with illegal aliens who we could not\ndetain, we know under their own regulations, if they snuck\nin, we couldn't detain them, but if a new Mexican -- there\nwas a Mexican dictator and he flooded our borders, could\nwe forcibly repatriate them? And the Government said\nabsolutely we can. We can go down and put them back in\nMexico. We could do that with the Cubans. We could let\nthem out the gate at Guantanamo Bay.\nIf a -- a rogue nation truly invades our country\nwith its bad aliens, that is an infringement on our\nsovereignty, and I think that's an act of war. And I\nthink the President has all kinds of options: trade\nsanctions, go to the United Nations, diplomacy. If it's\nreally something bad that's going to be a -- a threat to\nour national security, I think -\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Well, you -- you might\nwait a while if you went to the United Nations or --\n(Laughter.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: -- or to -- I take it\nthe Government feels you need some sort of a rather\nimmediate recourse.\nMR. MILLS: Sure, and our Government has\ndemonstrated that it believes in preemptive -- preemptive\naction and we can go in and have regime change in Cuba if\nit -- if it is such a threat. If it's a political\ndecision, the purely executive decision, that our national\nsecurity is so threatened, they have all kinds of tools.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But this -- this regime is not\nsending, you know, an armed flotilla to Florida. They\njust --\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- they just open their jails\nand say, hey, you know, go wherever you want. And these\npeople say I want to get out of here, and they go to\nFlorida. You -- you want us -\nMR. MILLS: That was less than 1 percent -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- to bomb Cuba because of\nthat.\nMR. MILLS: That was less than 1 percent of the\nCubans who came in the Mariel boatlift. That did occur,\nand we do have options for dealing with them. We can\nreturn them forcibly. If they don't allow us, that's like\nthem sending a missile. It's -- we -- we can destroy the\nmissile. We can't destroy a human being. By punishing a\nhuman being that Castro sends over, we're not sending a\nmessage to Castro. We're not saying, ah, you sent your\nprisoners over here and were going to indefinitely detain\nthem. Mental torture. That will teach you. That's -\nJUSTICE SOUTER: What you -- what you mean when\nyou say we can forcibly return them is literally we can\ntake them to Guantanamo, take them to the gate, and push\nthem out?\nMR. MILLS: That's one option. If there -- if\nthe Cuban army is there to prevent us, you know, maybe it\nwould require some military action that the administration\nmight decide is not advisable. But those are the options\ndepending on the size of the threat. So a judicial\ninterpretation that the statute means the same thing in\nall contexts does not deprive the Government of anything.\nAnd I'd like to go back to that if I could.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought -- maybe I -- I\nmisunderstood you, but I thought that one of your points\nwere even assuming that we couldn't send these people back\ninto Cuba without having a major conflagration, the rogue\ndictator is not going to be deterred by our tossing even\ninto the sea the people that he doesn't want.\nMR. MILLS: That -- that is my point. That's\nthe point that I -- I intend to make, that indefinitely\ndetaining these people -- that does nothing to a dictator.\nThat does nothing to deter a dictator. All it means is\nwe're going to be incurring the huge cost of incarcerating\na large number of people, and if anything, that may\nencourage the dictator to do exactly that, or it may\nencourage the dictator, instead of sending them to Key\nWest on boats -- on American boats, to sneak them up on\nspeed boats or take them through Mexico and sneak them\nacross the border that's -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Anyway, it's a little drastic.\nI -- I guess that before this happens, Congress might\nenact a statute like the terrorist statute.\nMR. MILLS: Exactly. That -- that is exactly\ncorrect, Justice Breyer. And if they think -- whether a\n-- a Cuban, a Mariel Cuban, can be put in jail -- and\nthese are in prison for the rest of their life -- is a\nhuge policy decision. And this Court should abstain from\nputting its voice as -- on to the answer. That is a\ndecision for Congress in the first place.\nIn Zadvydas, this Court said the statute doesn't\nclearly do that, so we're not going to -- we're not going\nto answer that question as to whether it would be\nconstitutional.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, it's a policy decision\neither way. I -- I suppose if Zadvydas had come out the\nother way, the Congress could have responded as well.\nMR. MILLS: That's correct. But in -- in this\ncase, because especially the Zadvydas aliens had clear\nconstitutional rights, we avoid the question. The\ndoctrine of constitutional avoidance says the Court\ndoesn't engage in that. The default is to stay away from\nit. If Congress wants to do something that might be\nunconstitutional, they can come back and do it and then\nthe Court will determine whether it's unconstitutional.\nBack to the point of whether 1231(a)(6) can mean\nsomething different for the two groups of aliens. Never\nbefore has this Court taken a statute that -\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: How do you explain,\nMr. Mills, the language that the Court used, pointing out\nhow different this kind of a case would have been from the\n-- from the Zadvydas case?\nMR. MILLS: Sure. My reading of that -- of that\ndecision, there were two parts of the decision. There was\npart one, which examined whether there is a -- or it\ndetermined whether the statute is ambiguous, and part two\nis whether there's a constitutional error. It was only in\nthe part of the decision deciding whether there's a\nconstitutional problem that the distinction was made. The\ndistinction makes the difference in whether there's a\nproblem or not. And maybe there's not a problem for\ninadmissible aliens.\nSo, the Court then concluded in Zadvydas that\nbecause there's a problem, we look at the statute. This\nstatute could be interpreted to authorize indefinite\ndetention or not. It's ambiguous. Because we have a\nproblem, at least with one category, we're going to choose\nthe -- a safe route.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It might have been a -- a means\nof warning Congress off one area, but not the other. That\nis to say, just because we think there's a constitutional\ndoubt here and therefore Congress might be sailing close\nto the wind if they tried to overrule our opinion by\nstatute doesn't mean that Congress couldn't in this other\narea alter the result in Zadvydas.\nMR. MILLS: I think that that is absolutely a -\na conclusion that can be drawn that Congress -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Of course, I dissented in that\ncase. So I'm not saying this was a good idea.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: But it -- it's interesting. In\n-- in just my -- for my -- my own information, then\nCongress did respond. And there were two areas in\nZadvydas that, you know, didn't warn Congress off. One is\nthe one we're talking about now. The other is terrorism.\nAnd Congress responded in the terrorism matter. Is that\nright? But they didn't do anything on the -\nMR. MILLS: That's absolutely correct. And\nthey're responding right now. In the 9/11 Commission\nbill, there is a section that's being negotiated as to\nwhether terrorist aliens who can't be removed because they\nwould be tortured -- whether they can be indefinitely\ndetained. And they're looking at the same limiting\nlanguage.\nOne point that I'd like to make that I did not\nget to make directly in the brief, but it was raised.\nJustice Scalia, you had a question yesterday in the Leocal\ncase, and it -- it raised an issue that I hadn't looked at\nbefore on whether a statute can be interpreted differently\nin a situation where the reason to interpret it is no\nlonger there. And that's the rule of lenity cases.\nAnd I cited as a supplemental authority the\nUnited States v. Thompson/Center Arms Company, 504 U.S.\n505. It's a 1992 decision, and it involved a tax code\nprovision. And the question is, do we apply the rule of\nlenity? And Justice Stevens, in dissent you said no,\nbecause this is a civil case. The rule of lenity doesn't\napply. But a three-judge plurality, an opinion by Justice\nSouter, and a two-justice -- two-judge concurrence by\nJustice Scalia both agreed that the rule of lenity applied\nbecause the statute applies both in criminal and civil\ncontexts. And you can't have one meaning in a criminal\ncontext and another in civil.\nFor the same reason, the rule of constitutional\navoidance should not result in a statute being interpreted\none way when there would be a doubt and another way when\nthere would not.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, what about the argument\nthat the statute, in effect, limits the -- our -- our\ninterpretation limits the -- the detention to a period\nreasonably related to the Government's interest in\naccomplishing that interest? That interest is different\nin -- in the case of -- of aliens who are excluded, if we\naccept that class as distinct from all excludables. And\n-- and that may allow a much longer period of detention,\namong other things, to deter dictators from -- from\ndumping. You've given us an answer to what to do if they\ndump, but we don't want them to dump in the first place.\nThat argument stops short of saying we can detain them for\nlife, but it would support the -- the position that on a\nconsistent interpretation of the statute, the Government\ncould detain them longer in the excluded cases than in\nothers. What's your answer to that?\nMR. MILLS: My answer to that is that that might\nbe a -- a legislative policy decision to make that\ndistinction. But in 1996, IIRIRA abolished the\ndistinction between inadmissible and deportable aliens\nafter they've been ordered removed. Up until that time,\nit makes a difference. It makes a difference under the\nConstitution. But once they've been ordered removed -\nand this was the Government's argument in Zadvydas. Once\nthey've been ordered removed, regardless of how they got\nhere in the first place, they no longer have any right to\nbe here at all and -\nJUSTICE SOUTER: There is only one class of\nexcludables by the Government's own choice. That's -\nthat's basically your answer.\nMR. MILLS: After a removal proceeding, there is\nonly one class. That is correct.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yes.\nMR. MILLS: If there are no more questions, I\nwould just ask that the Court reverse in this case.\nIf there are any mootness concerns about Mr.\nBenitez, I would refer the Court to Friends of the\nEnvironment which said that when a challenged practice has\nstopped voluntarily, that does not moot a case out in the\nSupreme Court unless there's some reason to believe they\nwon't go at it again. And the Government has asserted\nthat it can revoke his release at any time for any reason\nand detain him indefinitely.\nAnd the suggestion that the fact that he's been\nreleased under the Cuban Review Panel shows that his -\nhe's been protected is -- is not well taken. He was\ndetermined, when he first was detained in -- in 2001, that\nhe was eligible under the Cuban Review Panel to be\nreleased. It took 3 years and the week before this case\nwas argued in the highest court of the land before the\nImmigration Service did what its own regulations told it\nit had to do.\nThank you very much.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr. Mills.\nMr. Kneedler, you have 4 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. KNEEDLER: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nJustice Souter, you're exactly right in terms of\nwhy the statutory construction or statutory application of\nthe terms in Zadvydas does not control here. The Court's\nstarting point -- again back to page 682 of its opinion,\nit says, we deal here with aliens who were admitted. The\nway the Court dealt in the opinion was a matter of\nstatutory construction, and it did it by reading into the\nstatute a reasonable time limitation. What is reasonable\nfor aliens who -- who have been admitted and are subject\nto what were called deportation is different from aliens\nwho were stopped at the border. And in fact, in the -- in\nthe Court's statutory analysis, it looked to the point\nthat in the Witkovitz jurisdictional statement referring\nto Congress' constitutional doubts about detention of more\nthan 6 months, those were constitutional doubts about\npeople who were being deported after having been allowed\nto be here. There has never -\nJUSTICE SOUTER: What's your -- what's your\nanswer to Mr. -- Mr. Mills' position that the Government\nhas, in fact, statutorily waived that distinction by\ncreating one class of excludables?\nMR. KNEEDLER: It -- with respect -- with\nrespect, it has not. And -- and if I could -- if I could\nexplain this. This -- going back to Mezei, this Court\nheld and in fact rejected a very similar argument. The\nrationale of the court of appeals in Mezei was that\ndeportable aliens are subject to an express, not an\nimplied, 6-month limitation. And the court of appeals\nsaid the aliens in that -- the alien in that case, once he\ncouldn't be removed to another country, should be released\nbecause the purpose of keeping him to return him to\nanother country was no longer being served. This Court\nrejected that argument, even though there was a statutory\nexpress limitation of 6 months for deportable aliens, held\nthat an alien who had been on Ellis Island for 2 years did\nnot have to be released.\nIn reliance on that decision, Congress passed\nthe parole statute to leave the release in -- excuse me -\nMezei was after it, but the -- the executive branch has\nrelied on that rationale.\nThe Cuban review regulations that are at issue\nhere have been in place for 15 years under the parole\nstatute. As Congress well knew, when it acted in 1996,\nthe -- this program was the subject of many hearings in\nCongress. There were cases -- the Barrera case out of the\nNinth Circuit sustained a 10-year detention of a Mariel\nCuban. It is implausible to believe in 1996, when\nCongress enacted IIRIRA, that it intended to cut back on\nthe longstanding power of the executive branch to prevent\nhordes of aliens from coming into our country and to\nimpose an arbitrary 6-month limitation.\nI -- I think there's no argument that if an\nalien is detained before removal proceedings are begun,\nthat there is no 6-month limitation. His release is\nentirely up to the Attorney General under the parole\nregulations. It's -- it's implausible to believe that\nonce Congress actually enters a formal order of exclusion\nor now removal against an alien, the person is no longer\nin an ambiguous situation, the executive branch says\nyou're not eligible, that suddenly that person who has\nbeen formerly found not eligible, would be subject to a 6\nmonth limitation that did not apply up until '96 and\ndoesn't even apply until these -- to these aliens until\nremoval proceedings have been begun.\nSo the right way to look at this statute as\nwhat's a reasonable time under 1231(a)(6) has to take into\naccount that historic background of the United States\nbeing able to protect its borders. And there is no\nindication whatsoever that Congress intended to overrule\nthis longstanding program for Mariel Cubans, which has\noperated, as I said, for 15 years.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr.\nKneedler.\n"
