RUSSELL\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. RUSSELL: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThis case presents a single important but\nnarrow question. Everyone agrees that under the\nreasonable factor other than age provision of the Age\nDiscrimination in Employment Act, a business practice\nthat is reasonable is not unlawful even if it has a\ndisparate impact on older workers. The question here is\nsimply what happens in cases in which the proof on\nreasonableness is in equipoise, which party bears the\nrisk of nonpersuasion. And on that question the statute\nis not silent such as to leave to the courts to decide\nfor themselves what answer makes the most sense.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Is there a hypothetical\nuniverse where a scheme that discriminates on the basis\nof age is reasonable, but there is another alternative\nthat doesn't discriminate on the basis of age? Is the\nfirst alternative still reasonable, or does the\nexistence of a nondiscriminating alternative make it\nunreasonable?\nMR. RUSSELL: This Court made quite clear in\nCity of Jackson that the existence of alternatives,\nwhile sufficient perhaps to satisfy Wards Cove and to\nshow a violation under Section 4(a)(2), is not\nsufficient to show that the action is unreasonable. And\nthat's what the Court found to be the case in Smith. So\nthe standards are, in fact, quite different.\nThe reasonable factor other than age\nprovision looks at the reasonableness of the actual,\nexisting practice, and that's where the \"because of age\"\nrefers to the business practice there. It doesn't --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: If that's true, then is it\nnecessary either on the burden of production or burden\nof persuasion aspect of the case to consider other\nalternatives?\nMR. RUSSELL: It is in our view necessary in\norder to decide whether there is a --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Why is it necessary in\nlight of the answer you gave me at the outset?\nMR. RUSSELL: It is necessary in order to\nestablish whether you even get to the RFOA provision.\nBy its terms --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Whether you even get to --\nMR. RUSSELL: Even get to it, because by its\nterms the RFOA provision only applies to conduct that is\notherwise prohibited by Section 4(a)(2), and the test\nfor whether something is otherwise prohibited under\nSection 4(a)(2) is Wards Cove.\nThis Court in Smith said that language,\nwhich was identical to the language Congress used to\ndescribe the unlawful- employment practice in Title VII,\nhas the same meaning in both statutes. And in order to\nestablish a violation of Wards Cove, you do have to\noften look at questions of alternatives.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Russell, this is the\nproblem that I have with your double inquiry. First,\nyou decide business necessity. Then you decide\nreasonable factor other than age. Once you determine\nthat there is no business necessity, there is a readily\navailable alternative, so what you're left with is a\npretext for age discrimination, what -- what function is\nthere for anything else to perform?\nI mean, I understand the business necessity,\nwhether you have it pre-1991 or post, but I don't\nunderstand putting this other test on top of it. It\nsounds like you're making it harder for the -- for the\nplaintiff.\nMR. RUSSELL: Well, we think that the\nlayering of the tests arises out of the structure of the\nstatute as Congress wrote it. If this Court disagrees\nwith us, however, and thinks that there is room in the\nstatutory language to treat the language of 4(a)(2)\ndifferently in some sense or to apply a different Wards\nCove test, then you're still left with the question of\nwho bears the burden of reasonableness.\nAnd on that grounds we agree entirely with\nthe EEOC that that question is still determined by the\nlanguage of the statute, which makes quite clear that\nCongress thought that this was an exception to liability\nupon which the employer bears the burden of proof. And\nit made that -- made that clear both by setting the RFOA\nup as an exception to liability, which this Court has\nlong told Congress will be construed as establishing an\naffirmative defense absent strong indications of\ncontrary legislative intent, and by sandwiching that\ndefense in the same sentence as two other affirmative\ndefenses, which would be a very strange thing to do if\nCongress in fact intended the courts to figure out, you\nknow, one of the three is not like the others, That it's\nintended, instead, as a modification of the definition.\nAnd, third, Congress I think it -- it does,\nand it is telling that, in defining the unlawful\nemployment practice, that is in defining the plaintiff's\ncase in chief, Congress used the same language that it\ndid in Title VII, and this Court has never construed\nthat language to require proof of unreasonableness.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, your friend,\nof course, makes the point that the age discrimination\nprohibition is narrower in scope than Title VII, that\nthere are more likely to be instances in which a\nreasonable factor other than age came into play than\nthere would be a basis for discrimination on the basis\nof race.\nMR. RUSSELL: We acknowledge that. This\nCourt pointed out in Smith that Congress itself\nrecognized that there was a difference between age and\nother kinds of discrimination; but it took that\ndifference into account not by defining the unlawful\nemployment practice differently, but by providing age\ndiscrimination defendants a capacious defense that's not\navailable to any other defendant in a Federal employment\ndiscrimination statute, and by in 1991 not extending the\nmodifications to Wards Cove to ADEA plaintiffs.\nCongress already specifically addressed this\nquestion of whether Wards Cove should be adjusted in\norder to make age discrimination claims harder to prove\nthan Title VII claims, and it agreed that it should; but\nit didn't do it in the way that Respondents suggest.\nInstead they lowered the bar for Title VII plaintiffs\nand left in place the Wards Cove test for age\ndiscrimination.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Isn't it a strain to say\nthat an employment practice was because of an\nindividual's age, but at the same time was based on\nreasonable factors other than age?\nMR. RUSSELL: Well --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Doesn't the latter negate\nthe former or come very close to negating the former?\nAnd if that's the case doesn't that suggest that it's\nnot really an affirmative defense but what's necessary\nto show liability?\nMR. RUSSELL: I don't think it does. We use\nthe example in our brief of a weight-lifting\nrequirement. It's quite possible for that requirement,\nand quite likely, that it will have a disparate impact\non older workers because of their age. The effect will\nbe felt by workers because of their age. At the same\ntime, it is quite possible that that practice itself\nwill be entirely reasonable. And the difference is\nbetween what the \"because of age\" refers to in the two\ndifferent provisions.\nSo if you look on page 3 of the blue brief,\nyou have the language of the RFOA provision, and the\nreasonable -- the \"factors other than age\" refers to in\nthat case the differentiation, that is the business\npractice itself. But if you turn to the prior page on\npage 1A and look at the language of (a)(2), the business\npractice, that is, the limiting, segregating, or\nclassifying, doesn't have to be because of age. There\nwouldn't be a disparate treatment claim. Instead what\n\"because of age\" refers to there is the effect of that\nfacially neutral practice. That is, the employee has to\nshow that the neutral practice deprives or tends to\ndeprive people of opportunities because of their age.\nAnd the way that you do that is through the\nfirst step of the Wards Cove analysis, by showing that\nthe practice falls more heavily on older workers as a\ngroup, so that you can reach the conclusion that the\nplaintiff is feeling the effect because of her age as\nopposed to because of her sex or some other reason\nspecific to her. So it's not the fact that a showing of\nRFOA negates the showing that a disparate impact is felt\nbecause of age by the plaintiff.\nAs we were -- as I was mentioning before,\nthe language of the statute we think strongly points in\nfavor of an ordinary reading of this as an affirmative\ndefense. The Respondent's principal objection is that\nthis doesn't give adequate weight to the differences\nbetween age and other forms of discrimination. But as I\nmentioned, we -- we do think that Congress took that\ninto account in a different way, and there is, we think,\nquite an important value here in providing Congress\nclear rules of interpretation so that it knows when it\nenacts statutes using a particular formulation the\ncourts will construe it in an ordinary way, absent some\ncompelling indication to the contrary.\nWe recognize, of course, in Betts that this\nCourt found such a compelling counter-indication in the\nlegislative history of that statute, and in the -- the\nlaw's traditional treatment of benefits -- retirement\nbenefits and seniority rights. But Respondents can't\npoint to any kind of similar showing in this case that\nCongress would have intended this catch-all provision to\nmean something other than what it seems to say.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The expression comes from\nthe Equal Pay Act, with a substitution. In the Equal\nPay Act it's \"any other factor other than sex\" and here\nit's \"a reasonable factor other than age.\" And my\nimpression is that that formulation in this Equal Pay\nAct has been rather problematic. First, you have to\nfind there is a differential between the pay of men and\nthe pay of women, so -- and then you go to any other\nfactor other than sex.\nAre you suggesting any different analysis\nfor the age category than for the sex category.\nMR. RUSSELL: Well, certainly what you have\nto show before you get to the defense is different in\nthe two statutes. They are similar in the sense that\nneither requires proof of intentional discrimination.\nFor example, in Corning Glass Works all the plaintiffs\nshowed there was that a facially neutral practice, that\nis paying the night shift folks more than the day shift\nfolks, resulted in women getting paid less than men for\nthe same work, and that was sufficient to shift the\nburden over to the employer to show that it was based on\nany other factor other than age.\nAnd in here we think that it's similar, that\nthe plaintiff has to show that a neutral employment\npractice has a disparate impact on the basis of age. We\nthink in our view, in addition, the plaintiff has to\nmake the full Wards Cove showing that would be\nsufficient in Title VII to establish liability\nconclusively. And at that point, then the burden does\nshift to the employer but it's a modest burden.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: The burden of production,\nof course.\nMR. RUSSELL: Yes.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And what about the burden\nof persuasion?\nMR. RUSSELL: The burden of persuasion as\nwell. We think that this is --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Why is it that if the\nemployer has the burden of production, and I assume that\nis satisfied by his saying, here's the plan that we\nused, here are the factors we used, here is the reason\nwe used them. What is so difficult for the -- what is\nthe difficulty in saying that the employee then has to\nshow that that is unreasonable?\nMR. RUSSELL: Well, we think there are some\ndifficulties, but it's ultimately I think beside the\npoint. The question is not what rule would make sense,\nbut what does the statute -- what rule does the statute\ncontemplate? And we think by phrasing the RFOA\nprovision as a traditional affirmative defense --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: You think the statute\ndoesn't make sense, so we don't --\nMR. RUSSELL: I think the statute makes\nperfect sense the way it's written, but if you\ndisagree --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Your point that it's\nsandwiched between two things that are clearly\naffirmative defenses, BFOQ, the employer has the buried\nof production and persuasion. And I forgot what the\nthird one --\nMR. RUSSELL: The foreign law exception.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Is also an affirmative\ndefense. So I take it your point is why should this\nmiddle one be any different?\nMR. RUSSELL: Yes, we think it would be\nentirely odd for Congress --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I'm well aware of\nthe statutory format here. But what I want to ask is\nwhy is it beyond the employee's means and capacity to\nshow that this is unreasonable? It seems to me that\nthat's the gravamen of this case.\nMR. RUSSELL: I don't think it's beyond the\nemployee's means. I don't think it's an impossible\nburden. Certainly Congress could have written the\nstatute in a way that imposed that burden on the\nemployees. We do think that it makes sense because --\nthat the factors that weigh in on the reasonableness\ntend to be in the employer's possession and they have\nbetter access to it; it makes sense for them to bear the\nburden.\nBut ultimately our argument isn't grounded\non the claim that it would be impossible for Congress to\nhave imposed that burden. It's grounded on the claim\nthat the text of the statute indicates that Congress\nmade a different decision, that is it accommodated the\nemployers' interests in dealing with the special facts\nof age discrimination differently.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, if I find the text\nof the statute neutral or at least not clear, then it is\nproper for me to ask as a matter of efficiency where the\nburden should be placed, is it not?\nMR. RUSSELL: It is. It is. And my answer\nis that we do think that most of the facts going to\nreasonableness are in the employer's possession.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but the facts\n-- I mean, given discovery, that doesn't seem a very\ncompelling case. Once you require the employer to come\nup -- in other words, the burden of production -- and\nsay, well, the reason we did it was this, then it's just\na matter of discovery. The plaintiff can say, oh, well,\nthen let me depose that person who is the head of, you\nknow, whatever the department. If it's for safety\nreasons, for some reason, or training issues, well, then\nwe depose the person who is in charge of training or\nsafety and ask them those questions. And it doesn't\nseem to me that the fact that the employer possesses the\ninformation, given very liberal discovery we have, is\nmuch of a factor.\nMR. RUSSELL: Well, that's true in every\ncase in which informational disadvantages are cited as a\nreason for putting the burden of proof on one party or\nthe other. Discovery can always mitigate that\ndisadvantage.\nBut we ultimately think, you know, if you\nfind the statute so ambiguous as to think that it's a\nreally critical consideration of what makes the most\nsense, then you ought to defer to the judgment of the\nEEOC on this question.\nI would like to address if I could one\nspecific --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But the argument was that\nEEOC never spoke to disparate impact?\nMR. RUSSELL: Well, it's certainly clear\nthat the EEOC -- what their position is, and that they\nread their regulation as addressing disparate impact;\nand we think that, although it's an inartfully drafted\nregulation, by using the terms \"individual claim of\ndiscriminatory treatment\" rather than the term of art\n\"disparate treatment,\" the language is broad enough to\nbear their reading, particularly when you see that it\nwas enacted in the aftermath of a Department of Labor\nregulation that nobody disputes addresses\ndisparate-impact cases, and it has no indication that\nthey were disavowing that position.\nBut if I could address the one other\nobjective --\nJUSTICE ALITO: In this area of the law,\n\"treatment\" and \"impact\" are words that have\ntremendously different meaning. Isn't it strange to\nargue that they used the term \"treatment\" when they\nreally meant \"impact\"?\nMR. RUSSELL: Well, I -- I think that the\nterms of art are \"adverse impact\" and \"disparate\ntreatment.\" And so that their failure to use either one\nof those, I think, supports the idea that they weren't\ntalking about either one specifically. I agree, it's --\nit's a hard to read regulation.\nBut if I could turn, for a moment, to the\nAdams Fruit objection, which is Respondent's insistence\nthat this is not the kind of question that the Court\nshould defer to an agency on. My point is simply that\nthis is a substantive question of law. It's a question\nof whether reasonableness is an element of the unlawful\nemployment practice in section 4(a)(2), the same kind of\nquestion this Court asked in Smith when it decided\nwhether discriminatory intent was an element of the\n4(a)(2) cause of action.\nAnd the -- Congress has delegated authority\nto the EEOC to address those kinds of questions. In\nfact, it went so far as to delegate to the authority --\ndelegate to the EEOC the authority not only to construe\nthe exceptions that are in the Act, but to create\nadditional exceptions. So I think Congress would be\nvery surprised, indeed, to find out that this is not the\nsort of question to which it had delegated authority to\nthe EEOC to answer.\nIf I could reserve the remainder of my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel.\nMr. Joseffer.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF DARYL JOSEFFER\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,\nAS AMICUS CURIAE,\nSUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS\nMR. JOSEFFER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nCongress enacted the ADEA against a settled\nbackground rule that defendants bear the burden of\npersuasion on affirmative defenses and other exceptions\nto liability. And Congress made very clear in the\nstatute that the \"reasonable factors other than age\"\nprovision is precisely such an affirmative defense. It\ndid so first by saying that the provision applies to\nactivities that are \"otherwise prohibited by subsection\nA.\"\nThat has to mean that liability for\ndisparate impacts exists under subsection A without\nregard to whether the employment practice is based on\nreasonable factors other than age. The latter inquiry\nis then a defense to the liability that would \"otherwise\nexist\" under subsection A.\nThe second is a point that Justice Ginsburg\nmade, which is that this subsection (f)(1) lists three\ndifferent defenses right in a row. It appears to be\ncommon ground that the other two are clearly affirmative\ndefenses as to which the employer bears the burden of\npersuasion. And considering that all three are\nintroduced by the same \"otherwise prohibited\" language\nand they are set forth in a single sentence separated\nonly by commas, there is no basis for distinguishing\namong them.\nNow, the defendant's main argument seems --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm not sure that if the\nstatute contains three different conditions, three\ndifferent commands, that it follows that the procedural\nimplementations for all of these has to be the same.\nDo you have any authority for that\nproposition?\nMR. JOSEFFER: No. I mean, it's just a\nmatter of how to interpret the particular statute. And\nsince our point here is that this is a subsection on its\nface --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: If you want to say that\nCongress was well aware of burden of persuasion, burden\nof production problems with affirmative action, then\nthey wouldn't have drafted it this way, that's one\nthing. I'm not sure that that's true.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I suppose you could appeal\nto the maxim noscitur ex sociis, couldn't you --\nMR. JOSEFFER: Right.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- and say if it's in with\ntwo other chickens, it's probably a chicken?\nMR. JOSEFFER: Exactly. I mean, words are\ngenerally known by the company they keep. And with\nthese three in a row, it would presumptively assume that\nthey are all --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: These are not words.\nThey are operative provisions of law.\nMR. JOSEFFER: Right. They are three\nseparate clauses that are set forth, introduced by the\nsame, in our view, dispositive language, which is the\n\"otherwise prohibited\" phrase.\nIt's also the only way to make sense of the\nstatute as a whole, because the defendant's view seems\nto be that \"because of age\" under subsection (a)(2) and\n\"reasonable factors other than age\" under subsection\n(f)(1), should essentially be conflated such that the\nsecond, more specific provision is essentially\nsurplusage.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Do you think that \"based on\nreasonable factors other than age\" in the ADEA means\nsomething different from because of such -- I'm sorry,\nthat the -- because of an individual's age in the ADEA\nmeans something different from because of such\nindividual's race, color, religion, sex or national\norigin?\nMR. JOSEFFER: It modifies -- it modifies\nsomething different. \"Based on reasonable factors other\nthan age\" modifies the underlying employment practice,\nthe differentiation. Over an (a)(2) -- and this was the\nbasis of the Court's decision in Smith in part --\n\"because of\" does not modify the underlying employment\npractice. It modifies the adverse effect of the\nunemployment practice. In other words, the statute\nrefers to -- and this is on page 1a of the blue brief\nappendix -- it refers to an employment practice such as\na classification that adversely affects an individual\nbecause of that individual's age.\nSo \"because of\" logically modifies what\ncomes before it, which is \"adverse effect.\" And that's\nconfirmed by the fact that the first sentence that talks\nabout the employment practices is written in the plural,\nwhereas \"adverse effect\" and \"because of\" are written in\nthe singular with respect to individual, which is\nanother point the Court made in footnote 6 in Smith.\nAnd that also has to be the case because\ndisparate impact liability is not based on intent. It\ndoesn't matter why the employer draft -- has the\nemployment practice. What matters is the effect. So in\nany disparate impact case there are two basic inquiries:\nthe first is, is there an adverse effect on the\nprotected class; and the second is, has the business\npractice nonetheless justifiable.\nAnd here Congress broke those two out.\nSubsection (a)(2) addresses is there an adverse effect\non the -- on the protected class. And then in (f)(1),\nCongress specifically addressed the justification\nstandard. That's one reason that we disagree with\nPetitioners about their four-part test. Here Congress\nclearly -- here the first part of Wards Cove tells us\nwhether there is an adverse effect under subsection\n(a)(2). But then when it comes to the justification\nstep, Congress clearly said that the justification is a\nreasonable factor other than age. So there is no need\nto read in a different justification standard from the\nsecond and third prongs of Wards Cove.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The problem is that you\nwould be making this provision more generous to the\nplaintiff than -- for example, in Title VII the defense\nis business necessity; the employer has the burden of\nproduction; the employee has the burden of persuasion.\nHere you'd read -- you're saying you come into the\ncovered category, you were shown because of age through\nimpact, and then the burden -- the total burden is on\nthe employer.\nAm -- am I making myself clear here?\nMR. JOSEFFER: I think -- I think I\nunderstand the question. This statute is far more\nemployer-friendly in the standard than Title VII because\nit relies on the reasonable factors -- the\nreasonableness defense, which is a much lower standard\nthan the business necessity test under Title VII. That\nreflects the fact that there are more innocent\nexplanations for age disparity.\nThe separate question here, though, on\nburden of persuasion, I think the key point there is\nthat in Wards Cove this Court only had the equivalent of\n(a)(2) to work with. So it had not much textual basis\nto go on with respect to the second and third factors of\nWards Cove and burden-shifting. The Court had to do a\nlot of gap-filling once it recognized the disparate\nimpact claim.\nSince then, however, in every one of these\nrelated civil rights statutes that Congress has enacted,\nit has spoken more clearly on the justification stage;\nand has always in every one of these statutes put that\nburden on the defendant. It did it in Equal Pay Act,\naccording to this Court's decision in Corning Glass. It\ndid it in the revised Title VII. It did it here. And\neven in the Americans with Disabilities Act, Congress\nspecified that business necessity is a \"defense.\"\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, I was\nsurprised not to see Chevron cited in your brief. What\n-- what sort of deference do you think we should give\nthe EEOC regulations here?\nMR. JOSEFFER: Auer -- in our view the\nregulation itself as far as it goes is entitled to\nChevron deference, because it's a notice and comment\nrulemaking pursuant to delegated legislative authority.\nWe recognize, however, that the regulation on its face\nis at best inartfully written; and therefore, the\nquestion is how to interpret the regulation.\nWe think EEOC's interpretation of its\nregulation in context is reasonable for a combination of\na few factors. First, the Department of Labor\ncontemporaneously enacted a regulation putting the\nburden on the employer in all cases.\nSecond, when the EEOC took over rulemaking\nauthority, it didn't insert this unusual discriminatory\ntreatment language in there, but the EEOC's position at\nthat time and ever since has been that it did not intend\na substantive change.\nAnd third, discriminatory treatment, while\nit undoubtedly throws a real wrench in -- or wrinkle\ninto things -- excuse me -- and takes us out of Chevron\nand into Auer, is not a term of art. Disparate\ntreatment is a term of art. The regulations otherwise\nuse the phrase \"different treatment,\" but discriminatory\ntreatment is at best confusing, especially\nconsidering --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry. I\nthought Auer deference tells you how to interpret the\nregulation. And having once interpreted the regulation,\nyou need to know what to do with it.\nMR. JOSEFFER: My understanding of Auer\ndeference is that the agency gets deference as the\nreasonable interpretation of its regulation. And the\nagency has consistent --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We know what the\nregulation -- we give it deference; we know what the\nregulation means. Now, does that regulation, as\nunderstood in light of Auer deference, get Chevron\ndeference or something else?\nMR. JOSEFFER: It would get Chevron\ndeference. I mean, I think the two-step process is the\nregulation here, in our view, is clearly entitled to\nChevron deference as far as it goes. And if you defer\nunder Auer to the agency's view of its regulation, then\nthat makes the Chevron case. But it's through the lens\nof Auer.\nAnd finally, as a policy matter, Justice\nKennedy, one can reasonably place this burden of\npersuasion either way. I mean this Court put it one\nplace in Wards Cove. Congress immediately abrogated\nWards Cove and put it in the other place. The sky is\nnot going to fall either way. But even if the text\nwasn't so clear, one would logically put it on the\nemployer for a few reasons: First, all else being\nequal, the employer is at least in a better decision to\nexplain the reasonableness of its very own business\npractice.\nAnd, second, the parties are not ordinarily\nexpected to prove a negative, which is what the\nplaintiff would have to do here. And that's why in\nevery statute enacted after 1964, which is the first --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why is it proving a\nnegative? They would just have to prove that it was or\nwas not a reasonable factor other than age.\nMR. JOSEFFER: Right, and --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes, and just adding on to\nthe Chief Justice, it seems the employer is the one that\nwould prove the negative. He has to say there were no\n-- here is a whole universe of other frameworks, and\nnone of these work.\nMR. JOSEFFER: No, it's a very simple\ntwo-part test. Once the plaintiff has established an\nadverse effect, an adverse impact -- I mean, even the\ndefendant agrees that presumptively establishes\nliability, because the defendant agrees to bear at least\nthe burden of production at that point.\nAnd the question for the employer is just to\nshow that its business practices -- own business\npractice is reasonable, is supported by some reasonable\nfactor other than age. And it ought not be hard for an\nemployer, especially considering that the reasonableness\nstandard is not very daunting, to explain why its own\nbusiness practice is reasonable. And if an employer\ncan't even persuade someone that its own business\npractice is reasonable, then the odds are that there is\na problem.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Waxman.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. WAXMAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nI want to make an argument both from\nelegance and from function and from structure. Under\nthe employment discrimination -- a wide range of\nemployment discrimination, beginning with this Court's\ndecision in McDonnell Douglas, this Court has applied a\nthree-step balance-shifting paradigm in order to help\njuries resolve the question of whether discrimination\noccurred. In the disparate treatment cases there is a\nburden -- the first step, the plaintiff has to establish\na prima facie case that he was the subject of disparate\ntreatment because of his race or sex.\nThe burden of production then shifts to the\ndefendant in order to explain, under disparate treatment\ncases, a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason, which\neliminates the presumption consistent with Evidence Rule\n301, and the burden of proof then resumes on the\nplaintiff to prove discrimination because of the\nprohibited characteristic.\nNow, in Wards Cove, this Court looked both\nto Rule 301 and to the paradigm in other discrimination\ncases to apply a three-part test, in which there is a\nburden of proof to establish a presumption, a burden of\nproduction to neutralize it, and then a burden of proof\nto show because of race.\nThe Second Circuit has done exactly that in\nthis case, and we think they are right not just because\nthat harmonizes this Court's prior discrimination cases,\nand not just because three seems to be more elegant than\nthe four steps that the Petitioners want or the two\nsteps that the Government wants, but because it makes\nsense.\nAnd this goes directly to the question, I\nthink it was, that Justice Alito asked: Whether or not\nthe \"reasonable factors other than age\" inquiry is\nsimply what's necessary to show liability, that is, that\nit was because of.\nThe ADEA doesn't prohibit disparate\ntreatment. It doesn't prohibit disparate impact. It\nprohibits -- doesn't prohibit employment practices\nsimply because they correlate negatively with age. A\nplaintiff has to prove that he has suffered adverse\nemployment action because of his age. And the question\nwhether an employer based its action on reasonable\nfactors other than age is part and parcel of that\ninquiry. It's not a free-standing --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Waxman, the first\npart --\nMR. WAXMAN: -- confession and avoidance\ndefense.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The way you phrased the\nfirst part, it sounded to me like you were going back to\nthe interpretation that this Court rejected, that is,\nunder the Age Discrimination Act there is only\ndifferential treatment, not neutral factor with a\ndifferential impact.\nMR. WAXMAN: No, not at all. Not at all.\nIf I said that, I certainly don't want to be mistaken.\nWe are not up here arguing that there is no disparate\nimpact theory of liability under the ADEA as there is\nunder Title VII. This Court resolved that question in\nSmith, and it resolved it in large part by reference to\nthe \"reasonable factors other than age\" provision, which\nJustice Stevens' opinion for a plurality of the Court\nexplained that, when you have a disparate treatment\ncase, if the plaintiff proves that his -- his or her\ntreatment -- if the defendant proves that it was because\nof something other than age, it isn't disparate\ntreatment.\nThe fact that there is an RFOA provision, we\nthink, does reflect the fact that there is the potential\nfor liability under disparate impact, but as this Court\nexplained, it's narrower. And it's narrower because --\nnot only because the 1991 amendments didn't apply to age\ncases; it's narrower, because as this Court has\nrecognized in almost every age case it has decided, age\n-- unlike race and sex and religion and national origin\n-- often does -- sad to say by somebody who is in his\nsecond decade of protection under the ADEA -- often does\ncorrelate with reasonable employment factors.\nAnd the fact that all -- what it means is\nthat at step one of the burden-shifting analysis, the\nWards Cove analysis, which in a race or sex case\nestablishes a strong presumption that the employment\naction was because of race or sex because there are so\nfew employment characteristics that do correlate\nnegatively with one's race or one's gender, it's a\nstrong presumption which nonetheless need be met only by\na burden of production.\nThis Court has recognized that in the age\ncontext, the presumption actually is quite weak. And it\nwould be more than perverse to adopt the Government's\nproposal, which is that notwithstanding the much weaker\ninference, the burden of persuasion is now on the\nemployer, not the employee. And, in fact, the principal\nproblem, I would say, with the Government the EEOC\nproposal --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Waxman, what do you do\nabout the language \"otherwise prohibited\"?\nMR. WAXMAN: Excuse me?\nJUSTICE STEVENS: What do you do about that\nlanguage in the statute?\nMR. WAXMAN: May I just finish my sentence\n--\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Sure.\nMR. WAXMAN: -- Justice Stevens, and go\nright to \"otherwise prohibited\"?\nThe government's proposal under which, once\nthe employer establishes the statistical disparity, the\nburden of proof shifts to the employer, equates what\nthis Court has said over and over again is a prima facie\ncase or a presumption into liability. It would dictate\nprecisely the opposite result that this Court found in\nSt. Mary's Honor Center. It would allow the jury, upon\nsilence by the defendant, not to say, well, you may\nconsider this presumption to be enough if you don't hear\nany other evidence. It would tell the jury the proof of\nstatistical disparity is proof of discrimination. And\nthat's just wrong.\nNow, \"otherwise prohibited\" --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Even that, there's a\nquestion about not merely statistical disparity, but a\ncausal connection between an identified practice --\nMR. WAXMAN: Right.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- in the disparity.\nMR. WAXMAN: That's exactly right.\nNow, with respect to the structure of the\nstatute and \"otherwise prohibited,\" the -- my friends on\nthe other side of this case turn almost everything on\nthe fact that the \"reasonable factors other than age\"\nprovision applies in -- in subsection (f) and is -- as\nJustice Ginsburg said -- is sandwiched in between two\nother provisions that, for argument's sake, let's just\nacknowledge are affirmative defenses on which the\nemployer would bear the burden of proof. And why\ndoesn't that prove anything?\nI'll go first to \"otherwise prohibited\" and\nthen explain why the sandwich effect is no more\npersuasive here than it was to the Court in Betts.\n\"Otherwise prohibited\" means that it is\nprohibited subject to the following conditions. It\ndoesn't say who bears the burden of those conditions.\nWhat it reflects, Justice Stevens, is this\nfact. You could have taken everything that is in F and\njust put it into A, but you would then have had to put\nit into B and C and E. And so what Congress said was --\nit didn't say not -- things that are prohibited in\nSection A won't be unlawful if X, Y and Z. It says\n\"otherwise prohibited\" in those sections.\nIn other words, it doesn't -- it means\nnothing other than it's prohibited subject to the\nfollowing conditions. Now, I will acknowledge for\nargument's purposes -- and it actually suits my argument\n-- to show that the BFOQ defense and the\nforeign-employer defense are affirmative defenses.\nBecause as we -- as we know from Black's Law Dictionary\nand this Court's decisions, Dixon, for example, an\naffirmative defense is a defense that says: I admit the\nallegations of the complaint, but I have a justification\nfor it that the law recognizes.\nNow, that's --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Isn't it -- isn't the --\nisn't the weak point in your argument the following:\nYour argument assumes that when the employer implicitly\nsays I admit the allegations the complainant made, that\nthe employer is admitting, in effect, to disparate\ntreatment. That he is saying: I did it because it was\nmy purpose to discriminate against the old.\nBut if we read the \"because\" language as\nalso admitting the meaning, \"I did it or it had an\nimpact by reason of the age, regardless of my intent,\"\nthen this incongruity that you are arguing about\ndisappears.\nMR. WAXMAN: No. It is quite to the\ncontrary, unless -- and it may be the case that I'm\ncompletely misunderstanding you.\nThe point is that at step one the plaintiff\nhas to prove a statistical disparity, a substantial,\nnegative, statistical correlation. And that raises a\npresumption that what was otherwise a neutral -- appears\nto be a neutral factor was, in fact, because of age.\nThat these --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: In other words, for the\npurpose of discriminating against the old.\nMR. WAXMAN: Whether it's --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And that's -- that's\ndisparate treatment.\nMR. WAXMAN: Well, no. What this -- what\nthis Court said in Griggs is there are proof problems.\nThere are plenty of instances in which there is\nundiscovered, unreconciled, unacknowledged inferences\nabout people. And old people is the perfect example\nwhere there is no history of invidious discrimination.\nThere is no prior hurdle that, unlike black people and\nwomen had to overcome -- which was another factor in\nGriggs. It's that we all get old, and people have\npreconceptions sometimes about the enormity of\nlimitations of age which may not be justified.\nSo the way that these defenses, the\nsandwich, if you will, works is the plaintiff under\nWards Cove shows his statistical case. It's a prima\nfacie -- it shows that there is a disparate impact,\nperiod. But the statute --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Waxman, you have to\nkeep in mind they are not just showing a disparate\nimpact. Because of a particular practice there is a\ndisparate impact. That's what you leave out. So the\nquality of the practice is what is at issue, and the\ndefendant doesn't come in and say I admit that it was\nunlawful. He first tries to prove it was necessary, and\nhe fails on that. And if he fails on that, he has the\nlesser burden of proving reasonableness.\nMR. WAXMAN: No, well let -- let me see if I\ncan't address Justice Souter's point first. I do think\nI understand your point, which is what's wrong with the\nPetitioner's case. But, Justice Souter, the point is\nthat once a prima facie case is established in an age\ncase -- let's just take the three provisions that are at\nissue in (f)(1).\nUnder BFOQ, the employer gets up and says:\nWell, ladies and gentlemen, the judge is going to tell\nyou that they have established a prima facie case that\nthe way that these otherwise neutral -- that this was\nbecause of the plaintiff's age. And you know what? I\nadmit it. I, in fact, admit that it was by accident\nbecause of age.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: In an impact -- no. In an\nimpact case, he is saying: I admit that the impact\nfalls more heavily on the old.\nMR. WAXMAN: Correct.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And -- and it seems to me\nthat's all he has to admit in an impact case. And he\ndoes so, and then he --\nMR. WAXMAN: What he basically says is: I\nagree that age was the factor, but I have an excuse for\nit. And, similarly, in the third exception, the\nforeign-employers exception, he comes in and says: You\nhave heard all of the statistics. And you know what? I\ndid do this to disadvantage old people, because my plant\nis in a country that discriminates -- that makes it\nillegal for people over 65 to work. But --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But then he is\nnot -- he didn't do it to discriminate against old\npeople. He did it because the foreign country requires\nhim --\nMR. WAXMAN: That's correct. And that's why\nI admit -- I admit that I did this in a way that had a\ndisparate impact on old people. I did it, if you will,\nin order to -- I have a justification for it. Whereas,\nin the reasonable factors other than age, the assertion\nis everybody understands that the plaintiff has the\nultimate burden to prove that he or she suffered an\nadverse employment action because of age, not because of\nsome factor that for entirely good reasons correlates\nwith age. And the showing that there is a statistical\n--\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, then you're -- then\nyou're just saying that there -- that there is no such\nthing as a disparate-impact case.\nMR. WAXMAN: No.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: You're saying -- you're\nsaying that there's got to be a disparate-treatment\ncase.\nMR. WAXMAN: No, no; not at all.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, then I'm not\nfollowing you.\nMR. WAXMAN: Let's take their -- let's take\ntheir 50-pound hypothetical. The employer says: Okay,\nfrom now on all of our employees have to be able to lift\n50 pounds over their head, you know, 10 times in 30\nseconds. And older people or women -- let's say older\npeople, you know, say: Well, statistically, that has\nwiped us out. That has had a substantial -- a\nsubstantial adverse effect on us because we are old, and\nwe have less upper body strength.\nThe employer then gives -- comes forward\nwith a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason or a\nreasonable factor other than age, and says, for example,\nwell, you know, this is -- we need our employees to be\nable to lift strong things. If the plaintiff comes back\nand says, I am an accountant, that's not reasonable,\nit's a very different case than if this is a requirement\nimposed on stocking clerks in an auto parts -- auto\nparts shop where you do have to lift very heavy things\nover your head.\nIn other words, the paradigm that this Court\nset out in Wards Cove applies exactly the same way. It\napplies a three-part test except that at step three the\nstandard of justification is different.\nAnd this, I think -- I hope, Justice\nStephens, goes to your question. In Wards Cove this\nCourt said you show a prima facie case of a disparate\nimpact. The burden then -- the burden of production\nthen shifts to the employer to explain that it was --\nthere is a business -- to articulate a business\njustification for the facially neutral requirement.\nAnd what the plaintiff then has to do is\nbear the burden of proving that that wasn't a business\nnecessity; that there is one other way, one other way in\nwhich it could have been done; and, therefore --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But you there agree that\nthere is a distinction between \"business necessity\" and\n\"business reasonableness\"?\nMR. WAXMAN: Yes. And, in fact, I think\nit's sort of embedded in the very opening of the blue\nbrief in this case, where the Petitioner says: Well,\nthe Court has sometimes used the word \"business\njustification,\" and the Court has sometimes used the\nword \"business necessity,\" and we don't really think\nthat means anything, so we use the words\ninterchangeably.\nBut this case shows that it means everything\nbecause at step three of Wards Cove the petitioner --\nthe plaintiff's burden is proving that it is -- that\nthere is one other way -- that all you have to show is\nthat it wasn't a necessity to do it that way in order to\nachieve your objective and the employee wins.\nBut because of the differential in\ncorrelation between age and employment factors, in this\ncase it is a business justification; that is, the\nemployee has to come in and say it just wasn't\nreasonable to use that.\nAnd this case is a perfect example. Here we\nhave a research lab that has one client. It's the\nnuclear reactor division of the United States submarine\nunit. And they come, and they say -- and there is no\ndispute about the facts here -- they say the Cold War is\nover. We aren't going to have as much work for you.\nAnd since you're cost-plus, you're going to have to\nreduce your work force; and because we are in a\ndifferent kind of war, we have new missions. You are\ngoing to have to design and engineer and implement\nthings that you hadn't done it before. And so you need\nto figure out a way to go ahead and do this.\nAnd what the company did was to go through\nall of its units and then subunits and sections, and\nsay: Given the new mission that the Navy has told us we\nare going to have to occupy, do you have people -- do\nyou have more people than you're going to get paid for\nto do what you have to do?\nIf the answer is yes -- if the answer is no,\nyou're fine. If the answer is yes, please consider the\nfollowing: What are the skills within the people within\nyour section, subsection, or unit that are excess, that\nin light of the reduced and changed mission we don't\nneed? Identify those skills. Then go through each one\nof your employees; and if it is an employee with that\nskill, rank them on a scale of 1 to 10 according to four\ndifferent characteristics: Seniority, which gives a\nbenefit to older workers; recent job-performance\nratings; the criticality of the other skills they have,\ndo they have some other skill that is going to be\nrequired; and their flexibility -- how willing have they\nbeen, or are they, to learn new skills?\nAnd the company has a training manual. It\ngoes through and trains the managers to do this. It is\napproved by the Department of Energy and the Department\nof the Navy. But after the managers engage in this\nanalysis and prepare this matrix, they then have to\njustify it before a central review board, which the\nplaintiff's own expert acknowledged was set up in order\nto make the managers defend each decision and make sure\nthat those judgments corresponded with overall\nmanagement's responsibilities.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Still, the numbers, the\nway it came out, are rather startling. That there were\n31 people who were RIF'd; and of those, 30 turn out to\nbe over 40.\nMR. WAXMAN: That's correct. And as the\ndistrict court found and the court of appeals found,\nthose were strikingly stark numbers. They were so stark\nthat they came to the immediate attention of the\ncompany's management and general counsel, Mr. Correa,\nwho was -- who looked at this and said: We are going to\nget sued for age discrimination. What should we do\nabout this?\nAnd what he did about this, what the proof\nshowed, is he went back and said: Is each one of these\ndecisions justifiable? Did they really apply these\nfactors? He testified that he considered just saying:\nWe'll go back and redo it so that the age distribution\ncomes out right. But he was concerned that the New York\nhuman rights law, which defines -- this is sort of\nastounding -- defines \"older worker\" as somebody over\n18, does have a reverse-discrimination provision.\nBut the point here is -- and, therefore, he\ndecided: We did this right; we used a matrix that\nunrebutted testimony said was the paradigm in industry.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But the terms\n\"flexibility,\" \"criticality\" -- I mean the way you\ndescribed it, it sounds very mechanical, mathematical.\nBut those terms are -- they call for some human\njudgment.\nMR. WAXMAN: They definitely do. And the\nsecond question that was presented in this case, which\nthe Court didn't accept, was an assertion by the\nPetitioner that the Second Circuit had assertedly held\nthat where a reasonable factor other than age derives\nfrom a subjective judgment, the Second Circuit had held\nthat it was immune from review under disparate-impact\ntheory, which, as the Government pointed out in its\ninvitation brief, is not at all what the Second Circuit\nheld.\nThe point is that this Court in Smith and\nearlier in Hazen Paper and earlier age cases was highly\ncognizant of the fact that unless there is a test that\nimplies that -- that applies certainty for employers,\nthere is going to be -- age -- if this standard isn't\nreasonable and if it isn't up to the other side to prove\nthat it's unreasonable, employers are essentially going\nto take age into account. They are going to do what\nMr. Correa testified he wouldn't do, which is rejigger\nthe results to come up with a -- a percentage that more\napproximated the balance in the work force. And that,\nthis Court has said repeatedly --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, maybe because he\nthought that, given the subjectivity of some of these\nfactors, that there was at least unconscious age bias in\nthe decisions that were made.\nMR. WAXMAN: Well, Justice Ginsburg, that is\nwhy -- and it was testimony both from the employees in\nthe case and from our uncross-examined expert and even\ntheir expert -- the review board -- the company set up a\ncentral review board which was trained and which\nexamined every single manager about every single\ndecision, whether you call it subjective or objective.\nNow, the district court -- the trial court\nwho heard the testimony said that he -- he deemed\nflexibility and criticality objective. He said they\nwere objective factors because of all the instructions\nthat were given, which we have reprinted in the joint\nappendix in this case. But even assuming -- and I\ncertainly take your point, Justice Ginsburg, that if you\nask a manager to evaluate an employee on the degree of\ncriticality of that employee's skills or the flexibility\nof that employee, you can give her all the training in\nthe world. You can give her a 16-point checklist.\nUltimately, you're relying on a judgment by a human\nbeing of another human being.\nBut why would we not want employers to do\nthat? Why would we want them to -- to retreat to the\nsafe harbor of some safe quota. You know, gee, we have\na 60/40 split in our work force; and, wow, these\nnumbers, we did it according to Hoyle. We've done --\nthis is the paradigm RIF process, but go back and do it\nin a way that comes out with a specific set of numbers.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, is your\nrecent discussion about what happened here go simply to,\nI guess, your alternative argument, that we should\naffirm because you're right, regardless of who bears the\nburden; or does it really go to the legal question\nbefore us?\nMR. WAXMAN: Well, I think it goes to both.\nI mean it goes to -- it simply -- it certainly goes to\nthe question over whether, whoever has the burden on\nreasonableness, you ought to do what you did in Smith\nand what the Eleventh Circuit did in Montalvo, which is\nthe case you cited in Smith. And in --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Here we have a jury\nverdict that was affirmed by the court of appeals.\nMR. WAXMAN: Well, we have a jury verdict.\nWe have a jury verdict under Wards Cove. The court of\nappeals, as we pointed out in -- to the court of appeals\nthe first time and in our petition for certiorari here\nthe last time and to the court of appeals the second\ntime and to this Court on pages 4, 5, and 7 of our brief\nin opposition this time -- the court of appeals was\nsimply wrong in both step one and step three of Wards\nCove. This is even assuming Wards Cove were the test.\nThere is -- under step three of Wards Cove, which is how\nthis case was tried, it was concededly the plaintiff's\nburden to prove that there was some other way, one other\nway, to do what the company wanted that established that\nthis wasn't a business necessity. And I will represent\nto the Court that in five and a half weeks of testimony\nthere is not one sentence of evidence to that effect.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But that was taken out of\nit by Judge Jacobs when he redid it. He said, we were\non the wrong track with business necessity. Business\nnecessity is out. It's only reasonable factor of age.\nMR. WAXMAN: What Judge Jacobs said is the\ncase was tried under business necessity, under which the\nplaintiffs at least had to prove that there was some\nother way that the company could equally have achieved\nits objectives.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, wasn't the issue of\nreasonable factor under age tried in the trial court\nwhen the case was tried?\nMR. WAXMAN: No, because the EEOC regulation\nat the time, regulation (d), which deals with\ndisparate-impact cases, said that reasonable -- the\nreasonable factors other than age provision is proven\nby, and only by, the business-necessity defense, a\ndefense as to which the plaintiffs bear the burden.\nAnd, in fact, in Wards Cove, the Government\nin Wards Cove was on the employer's side. The\nGovernment urged the court to do exactly what it did.\nAnd under the Government's own regulation 1625.7(d), the\nburden of proving reasonable factors other than age was\ncorrectly on the plaintiff, but incorrectly equated with\nthe substantive showing of business.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Is that --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Am I correct to understand\nthat your trial counsel then took the position you must\nprove business necessity? I mean an absence of business\nnecessity, rather than reasonableness. They didn't\nadvance their strongest defense.\nMR. WAXMAN: Well, no, we took the position\nthat reasonable factors other than age was a separate\ntest and was a separate defense.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Right.\nMR. WAXMAN: The judge instructed the jury\nto the contrary and said under Wards Cove --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Was Judge Pooler wrong,\nthen? She said, in effect: You forfeited reasonable\nfactor other than sex, because you didn't bring it up.\nYou were going on business necessity.\nMR. WAXMAN: Well, what happened was -- I\nmean, Judge Pooler is wrong in certain respects, but not\nthat respect. We -- our answer pleaded reasonable\nfactors other than age, but we didn't -- neither we nor\nour opponents asked for a separate instruction on\nreasonable factors other than age. The jury was\ninstructed on the Wards Cove analysis because --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The jury didn't hear a\nword about reasonable factors other than age. They\nheard about business necessity.\nMR. WAXMAN: That's correct. I mean that --\nand that's because -- you could say that it was a mutual\nmistake by everyone involved. But the EEOC had directed\nunder subsection (d) of its regulations that reasonable\nfactor other than age could be established only by\nproving business necessity. And both parties --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: As everybody now knows,\nthat was wrong.\nMR. WAXMAN: That's correct. And the -- my\npoint is we are -- we are entitled to judgment in our\nfavor. We are entitled to an affirmance because, number\none, the Second Circuit was correct that the burden of\nproving reasonableness was on them, and the -- the\nPetitioners have acknowledged expressly on page 53 of\ntheir blue brief that if in fact it is true that the\nSecond -- if the Second Circuit is in fact correct, then\nthe judgment is affirmed, that is, they say when a --\n\"While a defendant has no obligation to press an issue\nupon which the plaintiff bears the burden of proof --\nand therefore the Second Circuit may have been justified\nin reviewing the evidence of reasonableness in light of\nits holding that Petitioners bore the burden of proof\"\n--\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But did you plead this as\nan affirmative defense? Did you plead it as an\naffirmative defense?\nMR. WAXMAN: We pleaded it as a -- I can't\nbring the complaint to mind, but we pleaded it as a\nseparately specified defense, yes. We said, in our\nanswer to the complaint, we said this is a reasonable\nfactor other than age.\nAnd so we are -- everyone acknowledges that\nif the Second Circuit is correct as to where the burden\napplies, the judgment should be affirmed. Our\nsubmission is that the judgment has to be affirmed\nwhether or not the burden applies as the Second Circuit\nheld.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Russell, you have four minutes\nremaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF KEVIN K. RUSSELL\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. RUSSELL: I'd like to begin by\naddressing the general legal question that the Court\ngranted cert on, and particularly going back to this\nidea, this assertion that the proof of the RFOA is\nsomehow a negation of the obligation that the plaintiff\nhas to prove that they have suffered a disparate impact\nbecause of age. It is simply incorrect. It's based --\nas, Justice Souter, I think you were suggesting in some\nof your questions -- on a confusion about what the\n\"because of age\" requirement is in a disparate-impact\ncase under Section 4(a)(2). The requirement under\nSection 4(a)(2) is simply to show that the effect of the\npractice is felt because of age, while the defense in\nthe RFOA provision is to show that the practice itself\nis reasonable even though it has this effect.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, the practice -- if a\npractice correlates with a number of -- statistically\ncorrelates with a number of different factors, is it\nbecause of all of those factors?\nMR. RUSSELL: I think, under Wards Cove,\nthis Court has said that it does, and so under Wards\nCove you establish that the discrimination is felt by\nolder workers because of age by showing that all the\nworkers as a group suffer disproportionately from it.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Wards Cove, in other words,\nsays \"because\" may mean \"correlation\" and it mean\n\"purpose,\" either one.\nMR. RUSSELL: Yes. I mean --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yes.\nMR. RUSSELL: But I think all you have to\nshow under 4(a)(2) is that the practice tends to\ndisadvantage older workers because of their age. And so\nagain in our weight -- weight example, the employer\nadmits in our weight example that the effect of the\nneutral practice is to fall more heavily, is to restrict\nthe employment opportunities of older workers because of\nage, but says, even if that's true -- even if there is a\ndisparate impact because of age-- we are still entitled\nto the defense because the practice itself is\nreasonable.\nIt's also -- I would like to address the\nsuggestion that Griggs is directed -- or disparate\nimpact is directed at ferreting out intentional\ndiscrimination. Certainly it serves that function in\nmany cases, but that's not the sole purpose of it. And\nit's simply not the purpose of the prima facie case in\nWards Cove to give rise to an inference of intentional\ndiscrimination, and the fact that it doesn't as strongly\nin the age case I think isn't a reason to think that\nCongress intended the courts to develop a different test\nfor showing what's otherwise prohibited under 4(a)(2).\nAnd, finally, if I could address some of the\nquestions regarding what happened in this case. This\ncase, Justice Stevens, was not tried with reasonableness\nin mind, both because Respondents abandoned their\n\"reasonable factor other than age\" defense, which they\nhad raised as an affirmative defense in their answer. I\nbelieve Mr. Waxman is incorrect when he suggests that\nthey in fact asked for instructions.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, if he put in all the\nevidence he's described, that would not have proven\nbusiness necessity. It seems to me that evidence had to\ngo to the issue of reasonableness.\nMR. RUSSELL: It may have been relevant to\nreasonableness, but that's not why it was put in.\nBefore the trial began --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Was he arguing that it was\nnecessary to follow this one downsizing practice?\nMR. RUSSELL: They certainly, I think --\nthey used that argument to show that they had a business\njustification and to try to rebut our showing of\nalternative, equally effective practices. But it was\nclear by the time of trial that -- you know, they had\nproposed jury instructions that didn't ask for\nreasonableness to be part of the case. We proceeded\nwith the case on the assumption that we would be\nentitled to prevail under these instructions so long\nthat we showed that the current practice, reasonable or\nnot, had a disparate impact and was subject to an\nequally effective alternative.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And just one other detail,\nDid -- the district judge not instruct the jury on this\ndefense?\nMR. RUSSELL: It did not.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: It did not?\nMR. RUSSELL: The only instruction was that\nwe'd be entitled to prevail if we showed Wards Cove, and\nits --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: You have an unusual case\nwhere the decisive issue, at least when you get to this\nCourt, is something the jury never passed on.\nMR. RUSSELL: Well, I think that's right.\nAnd ordinarily I think you would say that the\ndefendants, by not raising the issue to the jury, if\nit's an affirmative defense, have waived it. They ask\nfor an excuse, given the change in law. We don't think\nthat the change in law excuses their failure to waive\nit. The regulation that they point to they themselves\nhave argued here isn't entitled to much of any\ndeference. And, in fact, at the same time they were\nsimultaneously arguing that there wasn't even any\ndisparate-impact liability in the first place under the\nADEA. So I don't think they can actually claim that\nthey were relying on that.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
