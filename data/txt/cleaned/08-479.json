Redding.\nMr. Wright.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MATTHEW W. WRIGHT\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. WRIGHT: Mr. Chief Justice, may it\nplease the Court:\nThe search of Savana Redding in this case\nwas constitutional because Mr. Wilson had reason to\nsuspect that she possessed contraband which posed a\nhealth and safety risk. Therefore, searching any place\nwhere she might be reasonably hiding that contraband was\nconstitutionally permissible.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Any place, even\nthough he had perhaps no reasonable suspicion to suspect\nthat she was hiding the contraband in her underwear?\nMR. WRIGHT: Your Honor, Mr. Chief Justice,\nas long as he had reason to suspect, which we believe\nthe evidence does show, he was entitled to search any\nplace where the contraband might be reasonably hidden.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Any place? I mean,\nprison inmates, for example, are subject to much more\nintrusive searches. Are you suggesting that would have\nbeen justified in this case?\nMR. WRIGHT: No, Your Honor. I'm -- I'm\nsuggesting that where it might be reasonably hidden is\nbased on an administrator's experience and certainly is\nproven out by the reported cases that we've cite in the\nreply on pages 8 and 9, which are that students often\nwill secrete items in and under their clothing. That is\nnot an uncommon thing to happen, although these kind of\nintrusive searches are rare.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But I -- I think you're\nreally caught in -- in a dilemma here. Your answer\nsuggests that you would not have allowed a cavity search\nin this case.\nMR. WRIGHT: That's correct, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But people have been known\nto secrete contraband in -- in bodily cavities. What is\nthe -- what is the principle under which you would allow\na strip search but disallow a cavity search?\nMR. WRIGHT: The principle is, Your Honor,\nis that the common experience with schoolchildren, as --\nas school officials have a relation to schoolchildren,\nis such that they might hide things, and they do hide\nthings, in and under their clothing.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Was there --\nMR. WRIGHT: But --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Was there prior\nexperience in this particular school? Were there prior\noccasions on which students had been strip-searched and\ncontraband found?\nMR. WRIGHT: Your Honor, I don't know, and\nthat's not in the record, but I can tell that you that\nthat would not be the threshold requirement under this\nCourt's prior rulings to justify the search.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But you -- I thought your\nanswer to Justice Scalia was that in the -- in the\nschool's experience, children do hide contraband in\ntheir underwear but not in their body cavities.\nMR. WRIGHT: Yes, Your Honor. To be more\nspecific, in the nationwide school experience, based on\nthe reported cases that we see, which are contained in\nthe reply at pages 8 and 9, we find that they hide them\nin and under clothing, but I don't know of any case of\nwhich I'm aware where there would be items secreted in\nbody cavities.\nAnd I -- and I feel, Your Honor, that that\nis a bright-line area because that -- that is -- that is\nsomething that the Court can clearly say is off limits.\nAnd --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Let me ask you about\nanother bright-line rule that I think you're assuming.\nYou -- you said in the course of describing the\njustification for this search that one -- one of the\npoints of justification was that there was a health and\nsafety risk. And I assume from the way you put it that\nyou are grouping every drug, prescription or over the\ncounter, as posing a health and safety risk; is that\ncorrect?\nMR. WRIGHT: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Why -- why should we accept\nthat -- that blanket assumption? I mean, at some point\nit gets silly. Having -- having an aspirin tablet does\nnot present a health and safety risk, and yet that's an\nover-the-counter drug, and presumably you would have\ngone through the same search for -- for an aspirin that\nwas conducted here.\nMR. WRIGHT: For the very same reasons this\nCourt noted in T.L.O. 25 years ago, Your Honor, and that\nis that the school officials have deemed, in their\njudgment, that this is an important rule with regard to\nhealth and safety. So --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Oh, and I agree with you,\nand I -- I don't have any question with this kind of a,\nlet's say, a -- a broad swath of judicial hands-off in\ndetermining what is a risk and what isn't. But at some\npoint it becomes sufficiently questionable that I do\nthink we have to raise it. And if your rule would\ncriminalize -- I shouldn't say \"criminalize\" -- would\nput aspirin in the contraband category and justify the\nkind of search that went on here, I think we've reached\nthe questionable point. And I -- my question to you now\nis, why haven't we?\nMR. WRIGHT: Well, Your Honor, if -- if an\nadministrator in their judgment, in their reasonable\njudgment, believes that any -- any drug poses a\npotential health and safety risk, because they have the\ncustodial and tutelary responsibilities for those kids\n-- and it's not like a criminal issue where they're\ntrying to prosecute; this is a case where they're trying\nto protect -- because they have those kinds of\nobligations to provide for the safety of children, to\nprovide an orderly educational environment, it is best\nfor this Court to defer to their judgment when they\nbelieve that certain rules are important and not\nsecond-guess those rules.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Had it been --\nMR. WRIGHT: So long --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Had it been the case that,\nas I recall, someone had -- well, students were popping\nibuprofen, weren't they?\nMR. WRIGHT: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I guess they might pop\naspirin as well. I'm not aware that one gets a high on\neither one of those. Somebody in -- in the school had\ngotten almost fatally ill about a year before this\nincident; isn't that right?\nMR. WRIGHT: Precisely, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: On over-the-counter drugs.\nMR. WRIGHT: On a prescription medication\nthat --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: A prescription, not over-\nthe-counter.\nMR. WRIGHT: -- that a student brought to\nschool and that a student ingested, another student\ningested, and then was airlifted out in an ICU in a\nnear-fatal experience.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What was --\nMR. WRIGHT: But just 7 days --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What was -- what was the\ndrug involved in that case?\nMR. WRIGHT: I don't know, Your Honor, and\nit's not in the record.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But it certainly was not\nibuprofen?\nMR. WRIGHT: Again, I don't know, Your\nHonor.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You said it was a\nprescription drug.\nMR. WRIGHT: It was a prescription drug.\nAnd -- and 7 days before this event, Your Honor, just 7\ndays before, the student informant Romero had taken a\nprescription drug. Again, I don't know what the type of\ndrug was, but he became violently ill, which caused he\nand his mother to come talk to the administrator. So we\nhad those two recent events.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, but he -- he was not\nthe one who identified Redding. It was her classmate.\nMR. WRIGHT: Her friend Marissa Glines, yes,\nYour Honor.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And on that classmate's\nsay-so -- was the classmate ever asked, well, when did\nyou get this pill? Where did she give it to you?\nMR. WRIGHT: Where -- the question, where\ndid this pill come from, was asked by the administrator.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I mean, what place. I\nmean, the child is caught with the pills. She blames it\non her classmate. She says: She gave them to me. Did\nthe school ever bother to ask when in time she gave\nthem, where in location she gave them?\nMR. WRIGHT: No, but that's clear from the\nrecord, Your Honor. The reason for that is Jordan\nRomero said to Mr. Wilson that morning: I just received\nthis pill from Marissa Glines. The plan is that a group\nof these kids are going to take these pills at noon. So\nit's contemporaneous.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But it's contemporaneous\nwith the -- with the student who blamed the other child.\nI'm asking if there's any link other than one child\ncaught with the pills blurts out that it was someone\nelse? The tip from the young man had nothing to do with\nRedding; it had to do with Glines.\nMR. WRIGHT: But the tip from the young man\ngoes to Glines, and the young man's tip becomes reliable\nwhen Glines produces the fistful of pills that he said\nshe would have, plus other pills.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Maybe it becomes reliable\nas to her, but it has nothing to do with Redding.\nMR. WRIGHT: But, Your Honor, then it ties\nin with the -- with the contraband -- excuse me -- the\nplanner that was laid open before Mr. Wilson when he\nsubsequently searches Savana Redding, and she admits to\nhim that that was her planner, but she denies any\nknowledge of the contents. So did Marissa Glines. So\n--\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Did the school know what --\nwhat particular pills it was searching for?\nMR. WRIGHT: Not --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Did it know that -- what --\nwhat the threat was was ibuprofen or aspirin or -- or\nsome prescription drug?\nMR. WRIGHT: Not comprehensively, Your\nHonor. What they knew was there was IBU 400s in an OTC\npill that was later identified. But he also knew there\nwas a variety of pills. What Mr. Wilson did not know --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: How did he know it was an\nOTC pill?\nMR. WRIGHT: Because he --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Just by looking at it?\nMR. WRIGHT: -- called poison control.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Okay.\nMR. WRIGHT: And -- and once that was\nassessed --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What was in it? Did he say\n--\nMR. WRIGHT: It was Naprosyn 200 milligrams.\nAnd -- and, Your Honor, what -- that's a\ngood point because what Mr. Wilson doesn't know is what\nother pills might be out there. He knows there's a\nvariety of pills, but he doesn't know of what type. He\ndoesn't know what amount.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Have you ever made -- has\nyour side of the case ever made the argument that it\nneeds this sort of blanket classification rule, any drug\nover the counter or prescription, because when a, a pill\nis found, they're not pharmacists, they don't know what\nit is, and therefore they've got to have a blanket rule\nor they simply cannot act effectively? I did not see\nthat argument in the briefs. Has that argument been\nraised at any point?\nMR. WRIGHT: Precisely, Your Honor. We have\nargued that our administrators are not pharmacologically\ntrained?\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Where did you argue it? I\nmean, I want to know whether that argument is in the\ncase.\nMR. WRIGHT: It's in the briefs.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Is it? I don't remember\nit. Do you remember a page? Do you have a page\nreference offhand?\nMR. WRIGHT: I don't have one offhand, Your\nHonor.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But you say it's in your\nbrief?\nMR. WRIGHT: I'm fairly -- fairly certain\nit's in the brief.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay, I'll go back.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: In the case, this case,\nthe school nurse -- the pills were given to the school\nnurse and she identified what they were.\nMR. WRIGHT: Precisely. And she called\npoison control to figure that out, though, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Mr. Mr. Wright, could I ask\nyou this question. There may be an issue as to what the\nassistant principal could reasonably infer from the\nfacts that were known by him, whether he could\nreasonably infer facts that would create a reasonable\nsuspicion that there were drugs hidden in the\nplaintiff's undergarments. Is that a question for --\nfor the finder of fact in a case like this, so that it\ncan't be -- there can't be summary judgment for either\nside unless no reasonable factfinder could find to the\ncontrary?\nMR. WRIGHT: The problem with that is, Your\nHonor, it wouldn't comport with the notion that we need\nto shield administrators from lawsuits and legal\nliability.\nJUSTICE ALITO: No, not on the question of\nqualified immunity. On the issue of whether there is a\nFourth Amendment violation.\nMR. WRIGHT: Whether or not that would be a\nfactual determination, as to whether he could reasonably\nsuspect that the pills would be there?\nJUSTICE ALITO: Right.\nMR. WRIGHT: I think -- I think it could\nlend itself to that, Your Honor, but I would prefer that\nthe Court -- we would ask the Court and it's our\nposition that the Court would lay down a bright line\nrule such that it wouldn't end up in a factual dispute,\nand that bright line rule is this. Once you had reason\nto suspect a student is possessing any contraband that\nposes a health and safety risk, then searching any place\nwhere that contraband may reasonably be found is\nconstitutional, and --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Any contraband, like the\nblack marker pencil that -- that astounded me. That was\ncontraband in that school, wasn't it, a black marker\npencil?\nMR. WRIGHT: Well, for sniffing.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, is that what they do?\nMR. WRIGHT: It's a permanent marker.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: They sniff them?\nMR. WRIGHT: Well, that's the -- I mean, I'm\na school lawyer. That's what kids do, Your Honor,\nunfortunately, Your Honor. But --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Really?\nMR. WRIGHT: But the point was is that the\nrule -- the rule, Your Honor, is -- is grounded in the\nnotion that when there's a health and safety risk\nbecause these people are charged and tasked with the\nresponsibility to keep these kids safe, they have to\nhave the opportunity to act flexibly, immediately, and\neffectively when they're dealing with these risks.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But there has to be -- I\nmean, some -- the stark difference between this case and\nT.L.O., in addition to the intrusiveness of the search,\nwas there was a teacher said: I caught those girls;\nthey were smoking in the bathroom. Here we have nothing\nbut this Glines identifying her classmate. And nothing\nis done to check her veracity, nothing is done to follow\nup on it at all. And the search is quite different from\nthe search of a purse that doesn't touch the child's\nperson.\nMR. WRIGHT: Your Honor seems to be\nconcerned about the reliability of the tip in this case.\nYour Honor, I would submit to you to that student tips\nare the very thing that officials rely on probably the\nmost.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But an official could\nfollow up to see whether this child -- whether there is\na basis for what she said. But there were no questions\nasked at all.\nMR. WRIGHT: There was additional\ncorroborating evidence, Your Honor. There was -- there\nwas suspicion by direct implication and there was\nsuspicion by circumstantial corroboration. These two\nkids could, in Mr. Wilson's mind -- he believed that\nthey were working together to conceal other types of\ncontraband.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, the school could keep\nrecords on its students, like the police keep records on\nconfidential informants. So if -- unless this student\nhad a proven record of having accurately ratted out a\ncertain number of classmates in the past, she couldn't\nbe believed.\nMR. WRIGHT: Except that, Your Honor,\nthere's a different incentive here. Students can be\ndisciplined if they -- if they tell tales. And so if\nshe tells a lie she faces the risk of discipline. In\naddition to that, there was evidence that these kids\nwere friends, and he had reason to rely on that. He had\nreason based on their association at the opening dance.\nHe had reason to believe that because --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: What discipline did the\ntipster receive? What discipline was the erroneous\ntipster given?\nMR. WRIGHT: Oh, there was no discipline\nthat I know of in the record, Your Honor. It's not in\nthe record and I do not know.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Was she subject to a civil\nsuit by the plaintiff in this case?\nMR. WRIGHT: Was the person Marissa Glines,\nthe person who gave the tip?\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes.\nMR. WRIGHT: No, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Could I come back to your\ndistinguishing a strip search from a cavity search.\nWhat would you require before you would allow a cavity\nsearch?\nMR. WRIGHT: Nothing at all. A bright line\nrule. I would not allow it.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No cavity search in school,\nno matter what?\nMR. WRIGHT: We're not even clinically\ntrained to do that, Your Honor. I would submit that if\na child has something stuffed up one of their cavities\n-- and I assume we mean private parts, the very private\nparts -- that the first thing to do would be to send\nthem to the hospital. I mean, we just don't have that\nclinical training.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Your basis -- your basis\nfor saying that, I guess, is just sort of the practical\none, we don't know how to do that type of thing. So far\nas the legal principle on the basis of which you\njustified this search, you could justify that search,\ntoo, couldn't you?\nMR. WRIGHT: On the legal basis I could see\nthat, Your Honor. I could see that result. But\npractically --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But if -- if we hold in\nyour favor in this case and the next school district\nsays, all right, we're going to have classes in body\ncavity searches, then there would be no legal basis, if\nwe accept your principle, for saying that's out of\nbounds as a matter of the Fourth Amendment; isn't that\ncorrect?\nMR. WRIGHT: I see your concern. That's to\nbe left up to the local governments, Your Honor. As you\nhave mentioned, this Court has mentioned, in Ingraham\nand Wright --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So it would not -- it would\nnot be out of bounds under the Fourth Amendment?\nMR. WRIGHT: Technically, but it will be\ncontrolled by the community. It would be controlled by\nthe local board. The community would never --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Do you know whether or not\nin the Ninth Circuit in border search cases a body\ncavity search can be conducted without a warrant? I\nthought a warrant was required under the Ninth Circuit\nrule. I could ask the government.\nMR. WRIGHT: I just know that there has been\nconcern expressed over body cavity searches, even in the\nprisoner environment and even in the border environment.\nI can say to this Court you will not restrict or in any\nway inhibit the discretion of an administrator by saying\nyou can't go there on a body cavity search, nor would\nthey want to, nor are they clinically trained to.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Can I ask just a\nfollow-up on your answer to Justice Kennedy's earlier\nquestion about whether the informant was subject to\ncivil suit. When you said no, did you mean she hadn't\nbeen sued or that she could not be sued?\nMR. WRIGHT: I'm sorry, Your Honor. That\nshe had not been sued.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: There's one aspect of\nthis considering the reasonableness of the school\nadministrator's behavior. In addition to not following\nup with Glines, after Redding was searched and nothing\nwas found, she was put in a chair outside the vice\nprincipal's office for over 2 hours and her mother\nwasn't called. What was the reason for that\nhumiliating, putting her in that humiliating situation?\nMR. WRIGHT: Your Honor, that is not a\nmatter of the record, but the inference is that the --\nthat the investigation was still ongoing because there\nwas a group of kids, and at that time the administrator\nwas making efforts to try to make sure that he had\ngathered all the drugs that might be on campus. And in\nany event that wouldn't --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But how were they\ninvestigating her when they did nothing but put her in a\nchair outside the vice principal's office?\nMR. WRIGHT: Well, Your Honor, I can see\nwhere it might have been more reasonable in that sense\nto have let her go back to class, but it certainly is\nnot a standard that would affect the constitutionality .\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I assume a school can\nassign a student to study hall. That's not considered a\ngovernment seizure. Isn't that an obvious part of the\nparental supervision that a school exercises, sit here\nand stay there.\nMR. WRIGHT: That's exactly right, Your\nHonor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Schools do that all the\ntime, don't they?\nMR. WRIGHT: Yes. In fact, there was a\nNinth Circuit on the docket at the time, the Smith\nversus McLaughlin case, where the plaintiff argued the\nvery thing, that she was detained for hours. And the\ncourt recognized there -- I believe there was a\nconcurrence by Judge Kozinski -- that that's entirely\nappropriate, that's where they are.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: When was the -- when\nwas she detained there in relation to the lunchtime\nperiod, which was when the other student had said that\nall the kids were going to take these pills?\nMR. WRIGHT: I believe it went through the\nlunchtime period, Your Honor, the detainment.\nIn addition, Your Honor, I would like to\npoint out also that trying to restrict any more the rule\nthat I've laid out, as the United States Government has\nsuggested, respectfully, would cause more problems.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But aren't there things\nhere that are a little extreme? I mean, if she's to be\nbelieved, then she was really naked, and the two\nadministrators deny that, but you have to take her side\nof the facts. So taking her side of the facts, why\ncouldn't the school administrators just do what they\nsaid they did? That is, you leave her in her underwear,\ntell her: Go shake her underwear. No reason to do any\nmore than that. Or if she is really embarrassed about\nthat, say: Go put on a swimming suit, you know. Shake\nthe swimming suit, no problem. People see you at the\nbeach all the time. Or call your mother.\nI mean, you know, we can think of another --\na number of things that seem a lot less restrictive than\nher version of what went on here.\nMR. WRIGHT: May I offer two principles?\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes.\nMR. WRIGHT: First, this Court has\nrecognized that the least intrusive means is not a\nthreshold prerequisite to a constitutional --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I know, but I mean, here\nshe is embarrassed if -- if what she says happened\nhappened. There seems no reason for that, and it seems\nso easy. Put on your gym clothes, okay? I mean, she\ndoes that every day. It is just such obvious\nalternatives to having her be really naked.\nMR. WRIGHT: Very true.\nJUSTICE BREYER:\nSo that's what I -- I don't see any basis\nfor saying to the school administrator, you know, you\ncan do that. You can just turn her naked. I mean, it\njust embarrasses her. What's the need for it?\nMR. WRIGHT: In the record, Your Honor, she\ndid -- she did have her underpants on and her brassiere\nstill on.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I know, but she says in the\nrecord that they went further and required her to be\npartly naked beyond just her underwear. They say --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I suppose you could\nsay that about any strip search, couldn't you: That\nthere is never a need for a strip search? You could\nalways give the -- you know, the suspected felon, you\nknow: Here, change into this suit. And -- and we\nhaven't adopted some such rule, have we?\nMR. WRIGHT: No, Your Honor. You have\nspecifically said the fact that other reasonable\nalternatives are available doesn't mean that the\nalternative that was used or the actual search that was\ndone was unreasonable.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay. So that was my\nquestion. My question was: Why wasn't it? I wasn't\nasking about the law. I was asking: Why didn't they\nchoose one of these alternatives?\nMR. WRIGHT: I'm sorry, Your Honor. I don't\n-- I can't answer that question for Mr. Wilson, but I'm\nsure that in the heat of the moment that that issue\nwasn't thought through. And, of course, he wasn't\ninvolved in the search because he's a male. Only the\nfemales were involved in the search.\nMay I reserve the balance of my time, Your\nHonor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.\nWright.\nMr. O'Neil.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID O'NEIL\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,\nAS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING REVERSAL\nMR. O'NEIL: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nIntrusive body searches in the school\ncontext implicate fundamentally different expectations\nof privacy than other -- other kinds of searches. For\nthat reason, they require greater justification under\nthe Fourth Amendment.\nIn the government's view, the best way to\ngive effect to that greater showing is to adhere to the\nbasic reasonable suspicion standard of T.L.O., but to\nelaborate on that standard in two ways. First --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Before you get\nstarted, do we have to reach the underlying merits or\ncan we just decide the qualified immunity issue?\nMR. O'NEIL: The government agrees with the\nparties and all amici in this case that this Court\nshould address the substantive Fourth Amendment issue.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Should -- should,\nbut must?\nMR. O'NEIL: This Court could decide the\ncase on qualified immunity grounds alone.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, one of the defendants\ndoesn't have qualified immunity.\nMR. O'NEIL: That's exactly right, Justice\nScalia.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So don't we have to, for\nthat defendant at least, decide the constitutional\nquestion?\nMR. O'NEIL: Well, this Court could remand\non Monell grounds for a hearing on that, which was not\naddressed in --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What would be, Mr.\nO'Neil, the basis for the Monell claim? That would be\nagainst the school district?\nMR. O'NEIL: That's correct.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What would the plaintiff\nhave to show to establish a claim under Monell?\nMR. O'NEIL: The plaintiff would have to\nshow that this search was conducted pursuant to a -- an\nofficial policy or that the vice principal was a person\nwho was acting with that authority. There are a number\nof grounds that -- that the plaintiff could establish\nthe Monell claim on the basis of, but in this case the\nNinth Circuit did not address that. And, therefore, we\nbelieve that this Court should not review in the first\ninstance, but if the Court were inclined to remand on\nthat ground to allow the Ninth Circuit to address it\nbefore this Court reaches that.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: You -- you criticized the\nNinth Circuit in your brief for having a sliding scale\nstandard, which is a bad thing in your view. But it\nseems to me that your standard comes close to that. You\ncall yours a differential level standard or something\nlike that?\nMR. O'NEIL: No, Justice Kennedy. Our\nstandard is one of greater specificity in the\ninformation, not a standard that rises and falls\ndepending on the level of intrusiveness.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You -- you have to, under\nyour standard, have reason -- a reasonable suspicion\nspecifically that -- that the student is hiding the\ncontraband in the student's underwear?\nMR. O'NEIL: That's correct, Justice Scalia.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Now, if -- if you have a\nreasonable suspicion that the student has drugs and you\nsearch every other place, you search in the student's\npack, you search the student's outer garments, and you\nhave a reasonable suspicion that the student has drugs,\ndon't you have, after conducting all these other\nsearches, a reasonable suspicion that she has drugs in\nher underpants?\nMR. O'NEIL: No, Justice Scalia, we believe\nthat you don't --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: All right.\nMR. O'NEIL: -- without -- without --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Your logic fails me.\nMR. O'NEIL: Well, Justice --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You -- you reasonably\nsuspect the student has drugs. You've searched\neverywhere else. By God, the drugs must be in her\nunderpants.\nMR. O'NEIL: Well, Justice Scalia, you\nposited that the teacher began the search with\nreasonable suspicion. And in that case, if you searched\nthe obvious places like a wallet, a pocket, a desk, a\nlocker, and you didn't find it in those places, the\nlogical conclusion would not be that it must be in the\nstudent's underwear, but perhaps that the information\nthat you had --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That sounds like you\n--\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- putting things in their\nunderwear.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That sounds to me\nlike the sliding scale that you reject from the Ninth\nCircuit.\nMR. O'NEIL: No, because we believe that\nwhere you have reasonable suspicion that there is\ncontraband in the underwear, then you could go directly\nto that location, and you wouldn't have to work from the\noutside in. But, Justice Scalia, it takes --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Oh, surely not. You\nare saying if you have reasonable suspicion that it's in\nthe underwear, you shouldn't even bother searching the\npack or the pockets. You should go straight to the\nunderwear. That can't be right.\nMR. O'NEIL: Well, to take T.L.O. as an\nexample, Justice Scalia, in that case the Court believed\nthat there was reasonable suspicion that the student had\ncigarettes in her purse because that was the obvious\nplace to find them. Now, if the -- if the school\nprincipal in that case had searched the purse, searched\nthe student's pocket, searched the locker, searched the\ndesk, I don't think this Court would have said that\nthere was reasonable suspicion to believe that the\ncigarettes were in --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Now, what specifically do\nyou think is missing here? They need -- the school\nneeded to have a direct statement from Marissa Glines\nthat -- that Redding had the -- had the pills in her\nundergarments; is that correct.\nMR. O'NEIL: The particularized suspicion\ncould come from information from students that reliably\nadverted to the location of the contraband. That's the\n--\nJUSTICE ALITO: But you have to have direct\nevidence that the -- the -- it can't be based on\ninferences?\nMR. O'NEIL: No --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Is that the distinction you\nare drawing? The location has to be supported by direct\nevidence. Somebody has to say that that's where it is.\nMR. O'NEIL: No, Justice Alito. We believe\nthat if teachers were aware of the general practice and\nit was common knowledge that students did hide\ncontraband in this way and -- that would be relevant to\nthe totality of the circumstances in determining whether\nthis student was following that practice.\nBut we don't believe that the examples that\nwere provided in Petitioners' reply brief establish\nanything like that practice. Petitioners cite 8 cases\nover the course of approximately 30 years in which\ncontraband was found in those locations.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But you are -- you are\nsaying basically there is -- there is no general\nunderstanding that people carry ibuprofen in -- in their\nundergarments.\nMR. O'NEIL: That is -- that is true. There\nwas no experience at this school. There was no\nreasonable -- no reason to suspect that based on\nexperience in the world. And, in fact, by the time the\nofficials had conducted their -- this search, they had\nsearched Marissa, who was Respondent's friend. And they\nhad conducted a search of her pockets and her wallet and\nthey had found pills in her pockets and her wallet. But\nthey had not found pills in her underwear.\nSo even if that had been a suspicion that\none might have had even before beginning the search,\nthey certainly wouldn't have had that suspicion by the\ntime --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But if your --\naccepting your argument that there may be no reasonable\nsuspicion based on Marissa saying this is the person who\ngave me the drugs, does the fact that she said kids are\ngoing to -- the kids are going to take these drugs at\nlunchtime, a specific time, does that present a\ndifference in the level of concern that the school\nshould have?\nMR. O'NEIL: We believe that the schools may\ntake seriously any information they receive and must\ntake seriously any information they receive about the\npresence of prescription pills on campus. And the fact\nthat the teacher believed that these pills were going to\nbe consumed at lunch as part of an event that obviously\nwasn't simply intended to get rid of the students'\nheadaches, we believe that that would give rise to\nreasonable suspicion to initiate some search.\nBut we believe that without some\nparticularized suspicion or some specific indication\nthat this, the location, was a likely one to contain the\ndrugs, that this search was excessively intrusive. And\nthis is not a new standard. This is essentially the\nsame standard this Court adopted in the Montoya De\nHernandez case for intrusive body searches in other\ncontexts. It has proved workable in that context and we\nbelieve that it would prove workable here.\nWe believe that it is also better than the\nalternatives of a higher level of suspicion, which does\nnot bear any necessary logical correlation to the\nlikelihood that the --\nJUSTICE ALITO: If Marissa Glines had said\nspecifically that Savana Redding has pills someplace on\nher person and she's going to distribute them at lunch\nin the cafeteria, would this be a different case?\nMR. O'NEIL: It may well, Justice Alito. In\nthat circumstance it would likely be the reasonable\nthing for the teacher --\nJUSTICE ALITO: What is the difference\nbetween that situation and this situation? The\ndifferences are slight. Wouldn't that at least be a\nquestion that has to be decided by the trier of fact?\nMR. O'NEIL: That may present a triable\nissue. Here --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. That\nwouldn't -- that wouldn't satisfy the test you've just\ngiven us. I thought you said there had to be specific\nindication that she was carrying it in her\nundergarments. And what Justice Alito posed was not\nthat, just specific indication that she had it on her\nperson. Is that enough? Do you want to revise your\ntest so it's not just specific indication that it's in\nher undergarments, but specific indication that it's on\nher person? That's enough?\nMR. O'NEIL: No, Justice Scalia. We believe\nthat there must be information beyond that. And I may\nhave misspoke, and I think the answer to that question\nis that in that circumstance, a teacher would almost\ncertainly ask, well, where on her person is it? And if\nthe student doesn't know, then, yes, Justice Scalia,\nthat would not satisfy the standard that we would urge\nthis Court to adopt.\nJUSTICE ALITO: I mean, the student says,\nshe has -- she has crack someplace on her person, and\nshe's going to distribute it to kids during the lunch\nhour, and so they search her -- her garments, and they\ndon't find it. And you're saying that they cannot then\ngo ahead and search her undergarments --\nMR. O'NEIL: The nature of the contraband --\nJUSTICE ALITO: -- because --\nMR. O'NEIL: The nature of the contraband\ncould be relevant in the totality of the circumstances\nto the suspicion that the student has -- is hiding it in\nsome illicit place as -- Justice Souter, as you noted,\ncertainly there is no practice anywhere, that I'm aware\nof, of hiding ibuprofen in underwear.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So there is a sliding scale\nfor the dangerousness of what you're looking for?\nMR. O'NEIL: No. It simply means that it's\nrelevant to whether in the totality of the circumstances\nthat school official could have reasonably suspected\nthat the student was hiding it.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How is a school\nadministrator supposed to know? Marissa says: She gave\nme these pills. What are they? I don't know. And so\nhow is the -- if it depends whether it's a dangerous\ndrug like crack or a relatively -- not harmless, but a\ndifferent one like ibuprofen, the search depends on\nthat, how is the school administrator supposed to know?\nMR. O'NEIL: My point was simply with a drug\nlike crack there is a more common understanding that a\ndrug like that can be hidden in a student's -- in\nunderwear.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So what is the\nschool administrator supposed to know when he sees a\nwhite pill and doesn't know if it's something terribly\nharmful, even deadly, or if it's prescription strength\nibuprofen? You say in the former case he can search\nundergarments, in the latter case he can't. So how is\nthe administrator supposed to know what he's dealing\nwith?\nMR. O'NEIL: Well, we believe that, as I\nsaid, school administrators have to take seriously all\nmedication like this on campus. My point was simply\nthat where a particular type of contraband is known to\nbe carried in a certain way, that can be relevant to the\ntotality --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry, your\nanswer to me was they have to take it seriously. My\nquestion to you is, what is the administrator supposed\nto do? He sees a white pill; nobody can tell him what\nit is. Is he allowed at that point to search the\nundergarments or not?\nMR. O'NEIL: No.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: He's not?\nMR. O'NEIL: He is not.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Even if it turns out\nto be -- you know, I don't know, some very deadly drug?\nMR. O'NEIL: Mr. Chief Justice, we do not\nbelieve that this Court should get in the business of\ndeciding that searches are okay for, for example,\nheroin, but not okay for cocaine.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's what you just\ntold us we should do, in answer to Justice Alito's\nquestion.\nMR. O'NEIL: No, I simply -- the point was\nsimply that if there is some common understanding that a\ntype of contraband is generally secreted in a certain\nway, and the example is crack, and there is a known\nunderstanding that crack can be hidden in that way, that\nthat would be relevant to the totality of the\ncircumstances.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And I don't see why your\nanswer might not be different if, under the Chief\nJustice's question, he didn't know it was ibuprofen.\nAll he knew was that it was a white pill. He's not a\npharmacologist, he doesn't know what's in it. Wouldn't\nthe reasonableness of the -- wouldn't the scope of\nreasonable search at least potentially be greater for\nthe undifferentiated white pill than for the known\nibuprofen?\nMR. O'NEIL: It may, Justice Souter, but I\nthink that the question would be whether the school\nofficial has some reason to believe, based on a\npractice, that -- that pills, for example, are hidden in\na student's -- can be hidden in a student's underwear.\nAgain, the example was crack, and that is a situation\nwhere there is an understanding that that is -- can be a\nplace in which suspects will hide that type of item.\nBut, again, there was no indication in this\ncase whatsoever and no basis for the school official to\nsuspect that that was a likely location.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMR. O'NEIL: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Wolf.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF ADAM B. WOLF\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. WOLF: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nWe agree with the Federal Government that\nbefore conducting an intrusive strip search a school\nneeds to have location-specific information. And while\nthis case can begin and end with that well-accepted\nproposition, it's also important to recognize that a\nschool needs greater -- a greater degree of suspicion to\nconduct a strip search than to conduct an ordinary\nbackpack search.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I don't think the\ncase can begin and end with that because we have the\nseparate issue of qualified immunity. Can we take that\noff the table?\nI mean, we have got six to five in the Ninth\nCircuit, disagreement throughout in this case, and yet\nyou say the rule is so clearly established that you can\nmake these school officials personally liable.\nMR. WOLF: Your Honor, I don't think a head\ncount of the judges is the standard by which this Court\nmeasures qualified immunity. That's what this Court,\nyou know, held, for instance, in Groh v. Ramirez. But I\ndo understand that it sort of gives one pause.\nIt says: Well, what did they miss here?\nAnd what they missed here is that this search violated\nthe clearly established point that in order to conduct\nan intrusive search of one's body, the searching\nofficial needs to at least reasonably believe that the\nobject is located underneath the undergarments. The\nFourth Amendment does not account -- it does not\ncountenance the rummaging on or around a 13-year-old\ngirl's naked body --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if --\nMR. WOLF: -- without any suspicion.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if what Marissa\nhas is heroin? The school administrator recognizes\nheroin. She says: This is what the student gave me?\nSearch the undergarments or not?\nMR. WOLF: The nature of the infraction --\nno. The nature of the infraction, as T.L.O. would put\nit, is a nonstarter in this case, because we don't even\nhave the suspicion to get underneath Savana's\nundergarments, even if you had -- regardless of the\nsubstance.\nNow, in T.L.O., the question was whether\nthere were drugs to be found. There was marijuana in\nthat case. And this Court set a relatively low\nstandard, that you need more than a hunch, and you need\nparticularized suspicion. Now, that's where the Court\nset the balance for ordinary searches for drugs.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm not quite sure where\nwe are in your answer to the question of the Chief\nJustice's question. He asked you a hypothetical case.\nAnd you said that's a nonstarter because in this case.\nAnd the hypothetical is that there is a very\ndangerous drug, meth, that's going to be distributed and\nconsumed that afternoon.\nDoes that make a difference in the\npermissibility of the search and the reasonableness of\nthe search and the scope of the search?\nMR. WOLF: No, it does not. It does not in\nthis case, because without a suspicion that you're going\nto find the object --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So you don't mind our\njudging this case as if they were searching for meth?\nMR. WOLF: Your Honor --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: That's the way -- we\nshould -- we should judge this case as though they were\nsearching -- the fact that it was -- is it ibuprofen,\nhave I got that? The fact that it was ibuprofen is\nirrelevant; we can consider this case as if it were\nmeth?\nMR. WOLF: I think we all understand that\nthis -- that this case, you know, involves ibuprofen.\nBut our argument --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I don't think I understand\nthat based on your answer. I'm -- I'm asking you -- you\nsaid that the nature of the drug makes no difference,\nIt's a nonstarter.\nMR. WOLF: Not in in this case, correct.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Insofar as the rule that\nwe -- that's because in this case you don't think\nthere's a reasonable suspicion to begin with. But that\ndoesn't answer the hypothetical. We're trying to\nannounce a rule. And your rule, your submission, as I\nunderstand you and as I understood the government, is\nthat the nature of the substance they're searching for\nis irrelevant.\nMR. WOLF: I think it's irrelevant when\nyou're making distinctions between drugs. If -- if the\nquestion is whether you can strip search a child for\ngum, for instance, because that might prohibit school\npolicy, I would --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So that goes back to my\nearlier proposition that you don't mind our deciding the\ncase as if this were a search for meth that was going to\nbe consumed at noon?\nMR. WOLF: That's correct, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Thank you.\nMR. WOLF: Why? Because in this case there\nwas no suspicion -- and I think Justice Alito was\nperhaps getting to this -- there was no suspicion that\nthese objects were going to be found inside Savana's\nundergarments. And without that suspicion you cannot\nconduct such an intrusive search.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, to play the devil's\nadvocate on that, why couldn't the assistant principal\nreason as follows: that he has information from -- from\nMs. Glines that Ms. Redding has drugs. He has\ninformation from another student that drugs are going to\nbe consumed during the lunch hour. Putting those two\ntogether, he reaches the -- he suspects that the person\nwho has the drugs has the drugs on his or her person so\nthat they can be distributed at lunch. And then having\nsearched every other part of -- having searched Ms.\nRedding's outer garments, what's left are her\nundergarments. So therefore there's a reasonable\nsuspicion that the drugs are -- are located there.\nMR. WOLF: Justice Alito --\nJUSTICE ALITO: What's wrong with that?\nMR. WOLF: Justice Alito, I don't think that\naccurately describes the record. Even if it did, it\nwouldn't satisfy this Court's standard. Two things\nabout the record: one, I think the hypothetical\nsupposed that she had drugs, and in fact what the record\nreveals is that it was allegedly Savana provided these\ndrugs at some point. It's not that she currently had\nthem on her.\nSecond, that they searched every other part,\nand it's an important -- it's an important point in this\ncase. Where did Marissa have her planner? It was in\nthe desk. Did they search the desk here? No. We know\nthat. It's not in the record, as Mr. Wright said, but\nthey have lockers in the school. Did they search any\nlocker? No.\nCan students keep drugs anywhere else on\nschool grounds? Perhaps, probably so. Did they search\neverywhere? They absolutely did not. But I want to get\nback to the legal answer, too, which is that this Court\nsaid in T.L.O., and it's on page 342 of T.L.O., that a\nsearch is reasonable only when there are reasonable\ngrounds for believing that it will turn up evidence.\nThere were no reasonable grounds for believing that this\nsearch would turn up evidence, none at all.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You're saying the whole\nsearch, not just the search of the undergarments.\nYou're saying they couldn't even have searched her\nbackpack, right?\nMR. WOLF: I think they could have searched\nher backpack. And what --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why?\nMR. WOLF: What that speaks to is the low\ndegree of the suspicion and the nonspecific suspicion\nthat's needed to conduct an ordinary search.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So you want a sliding\nscale?\nMR. WOLF: It's not a sliding scale, Your\nHonor. This is a two-step framework, and that is it.\nWe have ordinary searches, backpacks, pencil cases, book\nbags, that kind of thing; and then you have a search\nwhere you require a 13-year-old girl to take off her --\ntake off her pants, take off her shirt, move around her\nbra so she reveals her breasts, and the same thing with\nher underpants to reveal her pelvic area.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I mean, I think there's a\ndispute in the record about that. So -- so we have, I\nmean you would have the right to prove your version,\nobviously. But suppose you fail to prove that and that\nthe jury or judge, or whoever is deciding this fact,\nconcludes the school board's right on that; all they did\nwas ask her to strip to her underwear, period. Nobody\nsaw anything else.\nNow, what's your view of that one? I mean,\nlet's also imagine that this is sufficient to prove --\nto -- what happened was Marissa opens a planner, and in\nthe planner there's some small knives, a cigarette\nlighter, and a cigarette. And who gave you the planner?\nWell, Savana gave it to me. And they find some pills.\nLet's imagine those pills are cocaine or something like\nmeth or something. And she says well, where did you get\nthose? Savana gave them to me.\nOkay. That seems to be possibly reasonable\nsuspicion to think Savana has some of these pills. And\nthey're going to distribute them at lunchtime. At that\npoint they go look, whatever they did here. But then\nthey bring Savana in to the nurse and the nurse and the\nfemale official say: All right, Savana, strip to your\nunderclothes and shake your underclothes. That's what\nhappens, period.\nNow, is that latter part a violation of the\nFourth Amendment?\nMR. WOLF: It is, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Because?\nMR. WOLF: It is because that is an\nintrusive, traumatic search.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. But it would be\nokay to say, change into a swimming suit or your gym\nclothes? Hey, your gym clothes are in the locker,\nthey're about the same size, shape; go do that.\nMR. WOLF: It -- it might be different if\nthey asked Savana to go into the other room and to\nchange where you're not revealing your body to\nany government official.\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, they didn't -- she\ndidn't reveal her body beyond her underclothes. She --\nthat's the hypothetical that I'm trying to work out\nhere, because I'm not certain.\nMR. WOLF: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I'm trying to work out why\nis this a major thing to say strip down to your\nunderclothes, which children do when they change for\ngym, they do fairly frequently, not to -- you know, and\nthere are only two women there. Is -- how bad is this,\nunderclothes? That's what I'm trying to get at. I'm\nasking because I don't know.\nMR. WOLF: Right.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Wolf, one thing\nshould be clarified. I don't think there's any dispute\nwhat was done in the case of both of these girls. It\nwasn't just that they were stripped to their underwear.\nThey were asked to shake their bra out, to -- to shake,\nstretch the top of their pants and shake that out.\nThere's no dispute, factual dispute about that, is\nthere?\nMR. WOLF: There is none at all.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, I thought there was,\nbecause I thought on page 135 of the record the official\nsaid they didn't see her naked, and so I thought that\nthere was --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: There was no dispute that\nthey asked her to shake her pants and her bra. Nobody\nsaid that they touched -- the school officials didn't\ntouch her, that's a given. But they did ask her to\nshake out her underwear.\nMR. WOLF: That's right, Justice Ginsburg.\nEverybody --\nJUSTICE BREYER: My question -- my question\nhas to do with accepting --\nMR. WOLF: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What they said on page 135\nof the record, and this is a genuine problem I'm having.\nI'm trying to figure out, if that's so, and to repeat it\n-- you heard what I said, there's no reason to repeat\nit.\nMR. WOLF: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay. I want to know why\nthat search, if that's what happened, would violate the\nFourth Amendment, assuming reasonable suspicion to think\nshe possessed meth or cocaine at that time.\nMR. WOLF: Yes. And it still would violate\nthe Fourth Amendment, and the question is why. Because\neven that slightly less invasive search still implicates\nlegitimate and serious implications of privacy. The\nNational Association of Social Workers, for instance,\nfiled an amicus brief in this case, and what they showed\nis that -- or they cited studies showing that when a\nchild undergoes a strip search -- and Justice Breyer,\nyour -- your hypothetical involves a strip search --\nthat that produces long-lasting and traumatic\nconsequences for a 13-year-old child.\nNow, why does that matter? Because the\nFourth Amendment requires a balancing. On one side you\nhave legitimate expectations of privacy, and on the\nother side you have the governmental need to conduct\nthat search. So --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Maybe the psychologists --\n\"strip search\" has a lot of meanings. And do the\npsychologists focus on the situation with the child\ninvolved, you know, this is an -- my hypothetical, is\nthat what they're talking about?\nMR. WOLF: I believe it is, Your -- Justice\nBreyer. And I believe that we cite such a study in --\nin our brief, the red brief, where we say that it\ndoesn't require a student to take off his or her\nundergarments so long as the shirt and the pants are\ntaken off, that that produces trauma.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Let me -- let me just, not\nso much change the facts, but -- but emphasize a couple\nof different aspects of the facts.\nAssuming Justice Breyer's hypothetical of a\nmoment ago and assuming the following thought process on\nthe part of the principal -- I -- strike that.\nI will vary the facts in one way. Let's\nassume, following your categorical rule that the -- the\nprincipal doesn't know whether it's ibuprofen or not.\nHe just knows that there's a pill and one of the other\nkids said this person has got pills on -- on her person.\nThe principal says, I know as a matter of reliable fact\nthat one student got sick, violently sick, within the\npast week or so on some pill; we don't know exactly what\nit was. We also know within a reasonable period of time\nfrom where we are now that there have been kids who died\nfrom ingesting dangerous drugs. I've got suspicion that\nsome drug is on this kid's person. My thought process\nis I would rather have the kid embarrassed by a strip\nsearch, if we can't find anything short of that, than to\nhave some other kids dead because the stuff is\ndistributed at lunchtime and things go awry.\nIs that the basis? Is that thought process,\nthat reasoning, the basis for a -- a reasonable strip\nsearch?\nMR. WOLF: And to make sure I understand,\nit's that there's reasonable belief -- there's a\nreasonable belief that a student has drugs on his or her\nperson?\nJUSTICE SOUTER: That's right.\nMR. WOLF: And by his or her person,\npresumably it could be the pockets or it could be in the\nbackpack that he or she is holding?\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Somewhere between the\nsurface of the clothes and -- and the body.\nMR. WOLF: Right. And in that instance it\nstill would not be appropriate. There needs to be\nsuspicion that the object is located underneath the\nclothing. And if that isn't there, then you can't\nsearch there. Now that should be --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: You -- you say that the --\nthe point of my question, this is what I'd like you to\nfocus on -- you're entirely right, I would accept that\nargument and I think that argument is entirely right, if\nthe stakes are lower. If the risk of a mistake is going\nto be less traumatic. In the hypo that I gave, the risk\nof the mistake may well be violent sickness or death.\nAnd the thought process in the principal's mind is, the\nreasonableness analysis in the principal's mind is\nbetter embarrassment than violent sickness or death.\nWhat's wrong with that reasoning under the Fourth\nAmendment?\nMR. WOLF: Well, I mean, to start, that's\nnot what T.L.O. said. T.L.O. said that there needs to\nbe a reasonable --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I'm -- I'm saying it.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SOUTER: We -- We've got a new case.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And I'm saying to you, why\nisn't that a -- a reasonable thought process within the\nconcept of Fourth Amendment reasonableness?\nMR. WOLF: Because in order to conduct that\nintrusive search, it seems like it that case you would\nhave to be doing guesswork, if you will, about where\nthose pills are located.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: You've got reasonable\nsuspicion that they are somewhere on the person.\nMR. WOLF: That's right. And presumably, if\nthey're -- if it doesn't show up in a pocket search,\nthen you can do a strip search; and if you don't find it\nin the strip search, you could do a body cavity search;\nand if it's not in the body cavity search --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And with those stakes in\nmind, why isn't it reasonable? In other words, there --\nthere is a sliding scale of risk which is inherent in my\nhypo, and why isn't that a sound basis for a -- a Fourth\nAmendment analysis?\nMR. WOLF: Because -- it all comes back to\nthe balancing of the Fourth Amendment. And here, where\nyou're conducting a traumatic search without a belief\nthat you're going to find it underneath the\nundergarments, it --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I don't have a belief; I\nsimply have a reasonable suspicion. That's what I've\ngot all along the way. And it seems to me, when -- when\nyou take the position that you -- you were taking, you\nare saying, better to have the risk of violent sickness\nor death than the risk of embarrassment. Isn't that\nwhat you're saying?\nMR. WOLF: No, it's not what I'm saying,\nYour Honor. There are many things that -- that this\nprincipal could -- or the assistant principal could have\ndone here that would have mitigated any risk, and at the\nsame time not caused the trauma of -- the trauma\nassociated with a strip search. Sit the child down --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Some search is -- is\nreasonable, I take it?\nMR. WOLF: But -- absolutely.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: All right. Now the -- we\nget to the point as in prior hypos, in which it does --\nthey find nothing in the pockets. They find nothing in\nthe pocket book or other garments. The only thing\nthat's left is a strip search, and that's where you draw\nthe line. Why do you draw the line there, on the risk\nanalysis?\nMR. WOLF: Well, the hypothetical supposes\nthey have searched everywhere. And I suppose if you\nhave -- if you are certain that somebody possesses a\ndrug and you have searched everywhere, perhaps you have\ngenerated location-specific information. I would\nreadily agree to that.\nBut in this case, they certainly did not\nsearch everywhere.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Do you agree with Mr.\nO'Neil when he said if the drug had been cocaine, and\nit's well known that cocaine is carried in underwear,\nthat then this would not run afoul of the Fourth\nAmendment? He gave an example of a drug where there was\na custom of carrying it in a certain way.\nMR. WOLF: Right. I think if it were\nreadily known that this student had previously been\nsuspected of -- to use the term that's used in the court\nof appeal cases -- \"crotching\" that drug, well, then,\nperhaps that would have been appropriate.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: It has to be that\nstudent. It can't be that it's customary among\nstudents?\nMR. WOLF: And it may be that if this\nbecomes so customary, that that somehow differently\ncalibrates the equation here, but it -- it's sort of\nstrange credulity to think that you would have loose\npills concealed against a student's genitalia. That's\nwhat you'd have to think was the custom here.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: As -- as I understand your\n- your presentation, you qualify as a strip search any\nsearch that requires the outer garments to be taken off.\nSo it didn't really matter whether they required her to\nshake out her bra or stretch the elastic of her\nunderwear?\nMR. WOLF: It certainly added to the trauma\n-- trauma, Justice Scalia.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But is a strip search and\n-- impermissible along the lines you say, to require the\nstudent to even take off the outer garments?\nMR. WOLF: That's -- that's right. That's\nwhat the studies say, and that seems like a reasonable\ncalibration to me. You know, anything --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Just to combine it\nwith -- with your answers to Justice Kennedy, you are\nsaying it's unreasonable to take off the outer garments\neven if your suspicion, reasonable suspicion for\njustifying the preliminary search is that the student\nhas heroin?\nMR. WOLF: Without any location-specific\ninformation, that's correct, and anything else would\nsend a shudder down the spines of little boys and girls\naround this country.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, let me ask you this\nabout spine shuddering.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Let's go back to Justice\nSouter's question. We assume that there's meth,\nsomething very dangerous, going to be smoked at noon,\nthere's very strong suspicion of this student. The\nassistant principal says I'm going to give you a choice:\nwe're going to engage in an intrusive search, same sex\npeople, like what went on here; or we're going to call\nthe local police department, we'll have probable cause\nto book you and they will search you at the jail house.\nWhich do you choose?\nWould the school administrators be violating\ntheir duty if they did that?\nMR. WOLF: If -- if they called in the\npolice officers?\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: They give the student the\nchoice. They say we'll do it here with a nurse right\nhere, where you know everybody, and there's nothing\nwrong' or we'll call the police, and they'll do it down\nat the police station.\nMR. WOLF: I don't think that would violate\nthe Fourth Amendment, Justice Kennedy.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Which -- which would be\nthe less traumatic of the two choices for the student?\nMR. WOLF: Well I'm not sure that there's a\nlesser or more traumatic. Both -- both are fairly\ntraumatic.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But wouldn't the\npolice --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: You think it's less\ntraumatic, or it might be less traumatic to have\nuniformed police officers take the person to the police\nstation and conduct the search there?\nMR. WOLF: Well --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: You want us to decide the\ncase on the fact that that's probably less traumatic for\nthe student?\nMR. WOLF: I'm saying both are remarkably\ntraumatic.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The police would require --\nMR. WOLF: I'm not putting them one above\nthe other.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The police would require\nprobable cause, wouldn't they, not just suspicion?\nMR. WOLF: They would require probable\ncause.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: In the hypothetical wasn't\nthere a probable cause?\nMR. WOLF: Well if there's probable cause\nand they want to call the police officers in, then they\ncan do that. But that's not what happened here. What\nthis school official did was act on nothing more than a\nhunch, if that, that Savana was currently concealing\nIbuprofen pills underneath her underpants for other's\noral consumption. I mean there's a certain ick factor\nto this.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, you've made\nthat point several times. In fact the issue here covers\nthe brassier as well, which doesn't seem as outlandish\nas the underpants, right?\nMR. WOLF: Did you say the prisoner?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes.\nMR. WOLF: Mr. Chief Justice? Well, yes, in\nthe prison context, the rules are different. They are\ndifferent, because this Court has --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Maybe I'm -- maybe\nI'm not articulating this. You keep focusing on the\nfact that it's unlikely that the pills would be\nconcealed in her underpants. That doesn't go to the\nbrassiere at all.\nMR. WOLF: Well it -- the brassiere I think\nas well. I mean there -- there was nothing in this\nrecord that even the principal or assistant principal\nsaid I suspect that it was there.\nJUSTICE BREYER: It's not like you have any\nstudies on this. But I mean, I hate to tell you, but it\nseems to me like a logical thing when an adolescent\nchild has some pills or something, they know people are\nlooking for them, they will stick them in their\nunderwear. I'm not saying everyone would, but I mean,\nsomebody who thinks that that's a fairly normal idea for\nsome adolescent with some illegal drugs to think of, I\ndon't think he's totally out to lunch, is he?\nMR. WOLF: Well --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Do you have any studies on\nthis? I doubt it.\nMR. WOLF: No, but neither -- neither do\nthey.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So what am I supposed to\ndo? In my experience when I was 8 or 10 or 12 years\nold, you know, we did take our clothes off once a day,\nwe changed for gym, okay? And in my experience, too,\npeople did sometimes stick things in my underwear --\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: Or not my underwear.\nWhatever. Whatever. I was the one who did it? I don't\nknow. I mean, I don't think it's beyond human\nexperience, not beyond human experience.\nMR. WOLF: Yes, but the \"not beyond human\nexperience\" --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, what are they\nsupposed to do?\nMR. WOLF: But the \"not beyond human\nexperience\" standard is not the standard that governs\nwhether the Fourth Amendment is violated.\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, no, but it's supposed\nto be what's reasonable.\nMR. WOLF: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And a teacher is there\nthinking what's reasonable? And I've already got the\nthing sort of away from -- I see your point. I'm not\nquite talking about that. I'm worried about what to\nwrite in this as a general standard. And so am I\nsupposed to say, look, school -- school officials who\nthink that children could hide things in their underwear\nwhen they know they're not supposed to have them, is\nthat school official really unreasonable except in a\nspecial case? That's what's bothering me.\nMR. WRIGHT: Well, it -- it is unreasonable,\nand at the end of the day, it has to be unreasonable.\nTo think that -- for school officials to think that this\nstudent was hiding -- this honor student was hiding\npills underneath her undergarments based on nothing in\nthe record that supports that, not a single thing. What\ndoes the school official know? That there was an\naccusation that Savana had provided pills at an unknown\ntime and at an unknown location, that Savana's backpack\nsearch yielded nothing, not only pills, but no suspicion\nthat she possessed pills underneath her undergarments.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Is that a question of law or\nis that a question that goes to the trier of fact,\nwhether you could infer reasonable suspicion about the\npresence of the pills in those locations?\nMR. WOLF: That seems like a factual\nquestion to me, Justice Alito. I mean, there's nothing\nin the record to -- to indicate otherwise. And we\nhaven't moved for summary judgment here, but all\ninferences are resolved in our favor when Petitioners\nhave moved for summary judgment.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Is probable cause a jury\nquestion too?\nMR. WOLF: Whether something rises to the\nlevel of probable cause?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, probable cause in the\nordinary criminal investigation cases. Is that a jury\nquestion?\nMR. WOLF: It strikes me as a factual\nquestion, Your Honor, that may or may not -- I -- I\ndon't know the answer to that --\nJUSTICE ALITO: In a 1983 action, wouldn't\nit be a jury question?\nMR. WOLF: I think in this case it certainly\nis a jury question, without anything else in the record\nthat that -- that that is a reasonable inference, and\nwithout it being self-evident -- and I would actually\nargue that it was self-evident that those pills were not\nlocated there and that that's not a reasonable\ninference.\nBut if there is some doubt about that -- and\nI was hearing some doubt from Justice Breyer and perhaps\nother members of this Court -- well, that strikes me as\na factual question. And if that's a factual question to\nbe resolved by a jury, there must be a principle behind\nthat, which is that if it is not a reasonable inference\nthat those objects were located there, then it would be\nan unreasonable search. And if that's true, then\nqualified immunity, at least at this stage, was properly\ndenied.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't think it's a\nquestion. You can -- even -- even in a 1983 action, I\ndon't think the courts allow a jury to decide whether\nthere was probable cause for an officer's search or\nseizure. That's new to me.\nMR. WOLF: Well, whether something was a\nreasonable inference or not, it might strike one as a\nreasonable inference --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Did the Ninth Circuit --\nMR. WOLF: -- and another as not a\nreasonable inference.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Did the Ninth Circuit\ntreat this as a jury question? I'm looking at page 38a.\nThey were quite definite that that was a Fourth\nAmendment violation.\nMR. WOLF: Right, because for the Ninth\nCircuit, this -- it was self-evident to the Ninth\nCircuit that the -- that there was not a reasonable\ninference. And without that reasonable inference, there\nwas no reason to treat it as a jury question, but if\nthere were a reasonable inference, then it strikes me as\nsomething that might be -- that might be better suited\nfor determination by the jury.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Wolf.\nMr. Wright, you have 3 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MATTHEW W. WRIGHT\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. WRIGHT: Thank you, Your Honor.\nThe reality is that we've gotten past the\nreasonable at its inception prong, and we're now on the\nscope. And I think everyone concedes that. And, as to\nthe scope, I can tell you that if they found uncut\nheroin or small-caliber bullets in this case, they would\nhave to reach the same results. And that is\nunacceptable in the school setting. There's too much at\nrisk here when you're talking about the custodial and\ntutelary responsibilities this Court has time and again\nrecognized as the most important elements in upholding\nthe three search cases, student search cases, that this\nCourt has upheld.\nThe other thing about the government's\nproposal is -- is really troubling. It's because they\ndo not justify why they would pass a rule that would so\nmuch stunt the administrator's discretion to respond,\neven in the most serious situations that confront the\nhealth and safety of kids. These -- these principles\nare principles that have been restated by this Court.\nYou need the flexibility to act immediately and\neffectively to keep kids safe.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Unless the people feel\ndifferently.\nMR. WRIGHT: That's right.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Some school districts have\nrules against --\nMR. WRIGHT: Absolutely.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- simply forbidding strip\nsearches on any -- right?\nMR. WRIGHT: There is an amicus brief that\ncites 189 school districts which have substantially\nlimited strip searches, which proves the Ingraham v.\nWright theory, which is that it will be taken care of at\nthe local level.\nBut administrators, for now, need a\nbright-line rule. And as to the scope, that bright-line\nrule is if you have reason to suspect that a student is\nprocessing contraband that poses a health and safety\nrisk, then searching any place where that contraband may\nbe reasonably hidden is constitutionally permissible.\nAnd in any event, Mr. Wilson in this case certainly\ncould have believed that the Constitution permitted it,\nMr. Chief Justice, and so immunity is a foregone\nconclusion in my opinion.\nBut I would ask the Court to rule on the\nconstitutional question in the affirmative because it\nwould further the interests of judicial economy. There\nwould not be any more Federal action in this case.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, there would.\nThere's a Monell claim against the school district\nbecause there is no qualified immunity.\nMR. WRIGHT: That's correct, Your Honor, but\nif you ruled in the affirmative on the constitutional\nquestion --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes.\nMR. WRIGHT: -- the case is over.\nThe additional issue, Justice Alito, on the\nfactual question is I understand you're not talking\nabout immunity, but the reality is we've got to be able\nto make decisions, and if we get sued on factual\nquestions because somebody questions whether or not it's\nreasonable for us to search where contraband may be\nreasonably located, then we're going to end up in court\nanyway on those factual questions, which is going to --\nyou know, deter officials from acting immediately and\neffectively in those situations. So, I do not think it\nis a factual question. And the District Court and the\nfirst three-panel-judge court did hold as a matter of\nlaw that this search was constitutional.\nThank you, Your Honors.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
