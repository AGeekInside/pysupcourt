MAHONEY\nOn behalf of Petitioners 48\n(10:04 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument\nfirst this morning in 06-84, Safeco Insurance Company\nversus Burr, and 06-100, GEICO General Insurance Company\nversus Edo.\nMs. Mahoney.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MAUREEN E. MAHONEY\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMS. MAHONEY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nI'd like to turn first to the Ninth\nCircuit's interpretation of the term \"willfully\" and its\ndetermination that the case had to be remanded for\nfurther proceedings to permit an opportunity to explore\nPetitioners' communications with their counsel. We ask\nthis Court to find that there is no necessity for any\nsuch inquiry for waivers of attorney-client privilege\nbecause summary judgment should have been affirmed in\nthis case.\nPetitioners and their counsel, if you think\nabout what communications you might find, they could not\nhave known anything more about these statutory issues of\nfirst impression than the district court did. It's\nquestions of law. And if the district court's opinion\ndoes not reflect reckless disregard for the law, for the\nreading of the statute, then it would be inappropriate\nto characterize Petitioners' adoption of the very same\nviews as either a knowing or reckless violation of the,\nof the FCRA.\nThe first -- the Ninth Circuit nevertheless\nreached a contrary conclusion, and said it was time to\ngo ahead and look at privileged communications if the\nPetitioners wanted to defend the case, because they made\nself-interpretive errors about the meaning of willfully.\nAnd the first is that they read willfully in\nthis setting to mean recklessly, and relied on several\ncases where this Court has read the term willfully in\ncivil statutes to mean recklessly.\nBut this Court has said repeatedly that the\nword willfully is contextual, that you have to look at\nall of the sections of the statute to see how it's used\nto determine whether it means with knowledge that your\nconduct violates the law, or whether reckless violations\nare sufficient. And in this particular statute, unlike\nthe other three that were at issue, Congress has used\nthe term willfully in other sections of the law to mean,\nas Plaintiffs concede, that the Defendant knows that\ntheir conduct violates the Act.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it's also used in the\nphrase \"knowing and willfully.\" That appears in several\nother parts of the statute, and that wouldn't make any\nsense if the only meaning of willful is knowing.\nMS. MAHONEY: Well, it actually says\n\"willfully and knowingly --\"\nJUSTICE SCALIA: In one formulation or\nanother, but it combines the two words, knowing and\nwillful.\nMS. MAHONEY: Well, this Court, though, has\nheld that willfully and knowingly, when that phrase is\nused together, it's been discussed in a number of cases\nincluding Dixon recently, that it means -- willfully\nmeans knowledge that the conduct violates the law, and\nknowingly means knowledge of the relevant facts. And\nthat would make perfect sense in this setting, and so\nthe term willfully when, again, used --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You mean willfully alone?\nMS. MAHONEY: It --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Where -- where it -- where\nit means what you think it means, which is knowingly,\nthat does not mean knowing the facts? If you mistake\nthe facts and are laboring under a misimpression of the\nfacts, you have nonetheless willfully violated the law?\nMS. MAHONEY: Your Honor, in Ratzlaf, the\nphrase was willfully, not willfully and knowingly, and\nthe Court held that it meant that you knew that your\nconduct violated the law. And that seems to be the most\nreasonable reading here because if you look, there are\nalso sections of Section 1681n that refer to knowing\nconduct, and that would require the conclusion that\nCongress used willfully in this section to mean a -- a\nless -- a more -- a less culpable mens rea than\nknowingly. And that's --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So that if you're\nthe CEO of your company, and a lawyer -- Federal counsel\ncomes in and says we've got a real issue under the Fair\nCredit Reporting Act, I need to brief you on that, we\nneed to make an important decision about whether we are\ncomplying, you say I don't want to hear about it, I\ndon't want to know about it. That would not be\nwillfully violating the statute?\nMS. MAHONEY: Well, under -- some cases have\nsuggested that there could be a willful blindness\ninstruction that would govern whether you define that as\nknowing or not. Certainly --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So it doesn't have\nto be actual knowledge?\nMS. MAHONEY: I think that the best reading\nof knowingly is actual knowledge or something that is,\nthat is everything but, you know, that really is --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: How about reckless\ndisregard?\nMS. MAHONEY: Well, conscious disregard is a\nrecklessness standard, and even if the Ninth Circuit\ncorrectly determined that this should be interpreted as\na recklessness standard, this Court has defined\nrecklessness to mean that it has to be conscious\ndisregard, actual knowledge of a high risk of, of -- of\nharm or in this case illegality. And in these\ncircumstances, you can't say that there was a high risk\nof illegality because what the district court found is\nthat the Petitioners' interpretations of the statute\nwere actually not only reasonable, but correct, and\nhaving --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Since the term knowingly or\nknowing appears in two places in 1681n, can't we infer\nfrom that that willfully in that provision also means\nsomething different?\nMS. MAHONEY: I think the way it's used, it\nsays knowing, knowingly that they did not have a\npermissible purpose. Permissible purpose, that may not\nbe knowledge of the law, it just may be knowledge that\nyour purpose wasn't permissible. And even if they were\nusing it --\nJUSTICE ALITO: I thought the statute says\nwhat the permissible purposes are.\nMS. MAHONEY: It does, but it doesn't\nnecessarily mean that the individual knew precisely what\nthe statute said. Because for instance, users are told\nwhat the permissible purposes are when they get a credit\nreport from, from a credit agency. But more\nimportantly, Your Honor, I think that the use of the\nterm knowingly there can also be explained.\nIf you look at Section 1681h, it actually\nprovides that certain tort actions cannot proceed unless\nthere is a willful intent to injure, except as provided\nin Section 1681n, and they are the same kinds of actions\nthat are carved out in 1681n.\nAnd so I think it was to make clear, I think\nit was to make clear that you didn't have to have a\nwillful intent to injure. So even if they meant it to\nbe interchangeable with a knowing violation of the law\nthere, I think there was a reason for it, it wasn't just\nsurplusage. It was to clarify that they didn't have to\nhave a willful intent to violate.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Would you say it's all\nright to use the model penal code definition of\nreckless, which is basically what you -- taking it here,\nyou would have to consciously disregard a substantial\nand unjustifiable risk that the action is unlawful?\nMS. MAHONEY: That's correct, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: If you come across anything\nthat would use that, I mean \"reckless\" itself is\nunclear. The model penal code tried to clarify it based\non this Court's opinions primarily.\nMS. MAHONEY: But I think you can look to\nthe way this Court described recklessness in Farmer vs.\nBrennan as well, though, as well as --\nJUSTICE BREYER: What's the difference?\nMS. MAHONEY: The difference is just, there\nis two forms of recklessness. One which says that if\nthe risk is sufficiently high, if a person should have\nknown, you could be -- you could be liable. But that\nthe form of recklessness that Congress presumably used\nhere in this setting, where there is the potential for\nvery punitive sanctions, was what is referred to --\nFarmer versus Brennan calls it \"criminal,\" the criminal\nrecklessness standard.\nAnd that means that not only do you have to\nhave an objectively high risk of illegality, but you\nmust be actually conscious of that risk. But in this\ncase, you don't even need to get to the issue of\nconsciousness.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, you said there is no\nway they couldn't have been conscious of the risk here.\nI mean, after all, that's why they went to lawyers.\nThey know there's risk that this is unlawful.\nMS. MAHONEY: The question is --\nJUSTICE BREYER: But consciousness, I mean,\nmaybe it should come in in the standard, but I don't\nknow that that would help you.\nMS. MAHONEY: I think the issue of conscious\n-- the risk, though, it has to be a high risk. And if\nit is a reasonable interpretation of the statute, or\neven if it is an interpretation of the statute that is\nfairly debatable, that you have a fair chance of\nsuccess, then how can you say that is a high risk of\nillegality, so high that we should say that Congress\nwanted to sanction you for taking that position?\nAnd for saying that, you know, you shouldn't\nbe permitted to adopt a compliance program if there was\na fair ground for believing that it was lawful. And\nhere what the Ninth Circuit did --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Suppose there is a fair\nground for believing it was lawful. Lawyers are in\ndisagreement, but in fact, I believe the lawyers who say\nit is unlawful, and I nonetheless go ahead and do it.\nIs that a willful violation?\nMS. MAHONEY: I don't, I don't think so,\nYour Honor, if, in fact, it was a fair ground for -- -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But I think I'm violating.\nMS. MAHONEY: I don't -- yes. But you\ncouldn't know you were violating it, and because if it\nreally is a fair ground for litigation --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I'm a better lawyer than my\nadvisors.\n(Laughter.)\nMS. MAHONEY: Your Honor, I think if it's an\narea where the law is truly unsettled. And here an\nissue of first impression, a lawyer's assessment that\nyou may lose is inherently predictive. These are not\ntrue or false answers when there is almost nothing to go\non.\nAnd so in that area, it's much like what\nthis Court did in Screws, where it said that this was a\ncase involving a willful violation of, or interference\nwith rights secured by -- by Federal law. And what the\nCourt says, well, it's not just any bad purpose that\nCongress had in mind, it is a bad purpose to defy\nannounced rules of law. They have to be, there has to\nbe sufficient clarity in the law to say that there was a\nhigh risk of illegality that you could disregard.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Would you look to the\nsubjective intent of the actor at all?\nMS. MAHONEY: Only --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Or would you just look to\nthe outcome and say, well, you know, it was a close\nquestion, so even if the actor indeed thought he was in\nviolation, it was a close question; it's okay?\nMS. MAHONEY: I don't think you would look\nat the intent until you found that there -- there was no\nreasonable ground or at least no, no -- no fair ground\nfor debate about the question. And at that point, Your\nHonor, if there was an objectively high risk of\nillegality, then you do have to ask, what were they\nconsciously aware of; what did they do?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I must say that -- that is\nnot the normal meaning of willful, willfully violating\nthe law.\nMS. MAHONEY: Well, I think in Screws --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You're changing it to mean\nwillfully, willfully and blatantly violating the law.\nMS. MAHONEY: I don't think so.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, if I know that what\nI'm doing is in violation of the law, even if it's a\nclose question, it seems to me I am willfully violating\nthe law.\nMS. MAHONEY: Your Honor, Screws says you\ncan't know the unknowable. And if the law, if it's\nreally, truly an issue of first impression, you may\nthink you're violating the law, but you -- you can't\nknow the unknowable. And that's why this setting is so\nimportant, because you can't, you know, put -- impose\nsanctions. Here we're talking about the potential for\nan industry facing billions of dollars without any\nactual harm to -- to individuals. And that --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Is it really billions?\nHow many of these have been certified as class actions?\nMS. MAHONEY: I believe that there are two\ncertified class actions. But many -- there are many\ncases pending and it could be billions of dollars, Your\nHonor. Certainly if the classes are certified, and --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Would you, would you, as\nrepresentative of the insurers, would you have a sound\nobjection to class action certification in these cases?\nMS. MAHONEY: Your Honor, I'm sure there\nwould be some bases to resist. But classes have been\ncertified, so I --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And gone to, gone to\njudgment?\nMS. MAHONEY: I do not believe any have gone\nto judgment, but I don't, I don't -- I think that the\npoint is that if you allow a thousand dollar penalty or\nthe potential for a thousand dollar penalty for every\nconsumer who didn't get a notice, simply because they\nmay have gotten a better price if they had even better\ncredit, across the country, if you interpret the statute\nthat way, and then you can say you can get this thousand\ndollar, what is in essence a penalty, and you multiply\nthat by the number of consumers, then you certainly have\nthe potential for very, very substantial liability.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: It's a question how many\nwill sue for a thousand dollars, given the litigation\ncosts.\nMS. MAHONEY: Well, given that these are\nproceeding as class actions, the answer is there is\nplenty on the line to incentivize plaintiffs' attorneys\nto bring these class actions, and they have been\nbrought, and this is a class action. There are two\nclass actions.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: They haven't -- neither\nhas been certified, has it?\nMS. MAHONEY: No, it has not. They are\nputative class actions, Your Honor. But I, but I think\nthat whether it's a class action or not, we have to look\nat what did, what did Congress presumably have in mind\nwhen it authorized these kinds of penalties and punitive\ndamages based on a willful violation in a technical area\nwhere there is no potential for harm? And certainly --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I have just two, two\nquestions on, on willful and then -- because you may\nwant to talk about the other issue in the case. First,\nyou began by saying that here a district judge has come\nto the contrary conclusion; by definition, it can't be\nreckless. Do you have any authority, where we -- for\nthat proposition, where we have said that?\nMS. MAHONEY: Well --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: We find all the time that\na right is not clearly established under AEDPA, and so\nforth -- and disregard what I just said. That's my\nfirst question.\nAnd the second is willfully, as Screws\nitself makes very clear, it is interpreted differently\nin the criminal context than it is in the civil context.\nMS. MAHONEY: Except Screws, Your Honor,\nactually says that it was adopting a criminal\nrecklessness standard, not a knowing standard, but a\nreckless standard. And that is the same standard that\nhas been applied in the civil cases that use willfully\nin the punitive damages context.\nSo I think it's exactly the same standard in\nthat Screws does say that the, you can't have, it can't\njust be a bad purpose, that it has to have been a bad\npurpose to violate clearly defined rules. And this\nCourt has said in various contexts in the, in the\nqualified immunity area that picking the losing side\ndoes not mean that your conduct was objectively, you\nknow, wrongful.\nAnd that's really -- I think that there is\ngreat significance to the district court's ruling. I'm\nnot saying that in every case, it would absolutely be\ndispositive. I think you have to look at what was the,\nyou know, the clarity of the law, what was the reasoning\nof the district court. But what the Ninth Circuit did\nis that it, in essence, said that you can't rely on\ncreative but unlikely answers to issues of first\nimpression.\nWell, if an administration official goes to\na lawyer in the administration and asks about a course\nof conduct, and is told, well, it's completely an issue\nof first impression, there is probably a 40 percent\nchance of success, do you say it's reckless to proceed\non that basis?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, just because\nan issue is one of first impression doesn't mean there's\na high degree of uncertainty. The statute may be\nclearly addressed to that issue. It hasn't come up\nbefore.\nMS. MAHONEY: Absolutely, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: First impression.\nMS. MAHONEY: It certainly -- this Court has\nmade clear that if the language of the statute is very\nplain, then, of course, that can be noticed, that can be\nadequate warning. But certainly this statute doesn't\nsatisfy that standard. Congress didn't provide the\nbenchmarks that you have to use for comparison to\ndetermine whether there has been an increase in a charge\nor whether there has been an adverse action based on the\nconsumer report. You need benchmarks to answer those\nquestions, and there aren't any regulations and there\nwere no cases.\nIf I could save the balance of my time for\nrebuttal.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel.\nMs. Millett.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF PATRICIA A. MILLETT,\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMS. MILLETT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe Court of Appeals correctly concluded\nthat willfulness in the civil context, as is used here,\nincludes a reckless disregard component or a\nrecklessness component. That is what this Court has\nheld in a number of cases that have similar uses of\nwillfulness focused on a departure from the law, have\nheld. Thurston, Richland Shoe and Hazen Paper are the\nthree that have been most discussed in the case, in the\npapers here.\nBut where the Ninth Circuit misstepped here\nwas in the application of that standard. And in\nparticular, we agreed with Petitioners that when it\nconcluded that a creative but unlikely position\nconstitutes recklessness, it erred. Recklessness speaks\nan extreme deviation from an ordinary standard of care.\nIt requires that the defendant act in the face of or\nfail to act --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: It is a subjective\nstandard or an objective standard?\nMS. MILLETT: It has both in this context.\nIt is, I think, first and foremost, an objective\ncomponent, because there is -- this is a civil case.\nIt's not purely subjective. And that objective\ncomponent is very important because that is what makes\nthe act or inaction reckless, and that is the risk.\nThere has to be an objectively high and obvious risk.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: So if the potential\nliability, as in these cases, is huge, then you have to\nbe even more careful because there is liability so\ngreat. So is it the greater the liability -- the\ngreater chance of recklessness, the greater the\npotential liability?\nMS. MILLETT: No, to the extent you're\ntalking about dollar liability, I don't think that's\ntrue. I do think it's fair to say that in recklessness\ngenerally in the tort law, the more serious an injury\nthat could result, can -- we'll tolerate less risk. If\nthe risk is causing serious bodily injury or death to\nsomebody, we'll -- the law will tolerate a lesser degree\nof risk than it will if, if it's simply causing, you\nknow, a delay in something or a sort of paper injury or\nmaybe even a dollar injury.\nAnd it's not set. It's a variable\ncalculation. So in that sense, it is. I don't think\nthat when we talk about a high and objective risk in\nthis context, we are talking about the dollars that a,\nthat a company would have to pay, although I'm sure they\nare interested in hearing about that from their lawyers.\nWhat we are talking about here -- and this\nis a very unusual statute the way it's written -- the\nliability itself, not just the damages, but the\nliability itself turns upon the extent of departure from\nlaw. You have to -- there is no recovery here like\nthere is in almost -- or commonly in Federal statutes\nfor just a violation. That isn't it.\nYou have to show either a willful violation\nor a negligent violation, and that requires a\ndetermination not only that the defendants violated the\nlaw, but a determination as to how much, how far, how\nmany standard deviations from correct their position was\nand that is an objective determination.\nOnce an objectively high risk has been found\nby a court, then -- then the case can shift to looking\ninto subjective things. I think a plaintiff would be\nentitled, once an objectively high and obvious risk has\nbeen found by the court, to rely on that, and allow a\njury to, or a judge, whoever is deciding the case, to\ninfer the existence of willfulness from that. And\nthat's often when defendants -- I'm sorry.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I also ask, do you\nagree with the Petitioner on the meaning of adverse\naction?\nMS. MILLETT: No, we agree with Respondents\non the meaning of adverse action.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Correct me if I'm\nwrong. You think if I have an insurance policy, I'm\npaying a certain rate, they look at my credit report and\nthey say, you know, good news, we're going to lower your\nrates, that's an adverse action because they might have\nlowered the rates even further if they had notified me\nabout the credit report and there were some errors in\nit?\nMS. MILLETT: Right. It's a complicated\nanswer, in part because that assumes that you have an\nexisting account and you're not an initial account here.\nAnd when you have an existing account, there's a\ndefinition of adverse action for insurance provisions,\nbut in iv there is a separate, there's another\ndefinition, and this is on, on page -- sorry. Excuse\nme. On page 3A of the appendix to our brief, iv under\nbig I -- I'm sorry, there's a lot of provisions -- talks\nabout reviewing an existing account, and it\ncross-referenced another provision which talks about\nreviewing an account for purposes of termination. And\nthat would include, in our view, not only completely\ncanceling it, but terminating the existing and charging\nyou more for allowing you now to pay a new rate. So\nwhich would govern in that particular context is a\nlittle bit harder.\nBut it could, and here's logically why,\nbecause I think the understanding of \"increase\" that's\nat issue here is one that's very basic to the operation\nof this statute, and that is, did the content of your\ninformation in your credit report, if it had been\nbetter, could you have had a better rate or a better\ndeal.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right.\nMS. MILLETT: So have you been hit in the\npocketbook.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So if they lower, if\nthey lower the rates, you still say that that fits the\nmeaning of adverse action because they might have\nlowered them further if the information hadn't been\nerroneous?\nMS. MILLETT: It could have, and here -- in\nthis sense, it could be: In the same way that I, sort\nof the flip side, but in my office, if everybody in the\nhallway gets a 5 percent salary increase and I only get\na 1 percent salary increase, I am certainly better off,\nbut if the reason I got a lesser increase is because of\nmy gender or because of my credit report, it's an\nadverse action. So the fact that you're doing somewhat\nbetter doesn't mean --\nJUSTICE BREYER: That isn't how the statute\ndefines it.\nMS. MILLETT: Excuse me?\nJUSTICE BREYER: The statute says an adverse\naction is an increase in a charge for -- in connection\nwith underwriting.\nMS. MILLETT: But it also --\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's what it says. And\nthen it says an increase is -- and if you take an\nadverse action, i.e., if you increase it, and your\nincrease is based in whole or in part on information\ncontained in a consumer report, you have to send the\nthing. How did you get -- in your example, there was no\nincrease. I mean, in a charge. In your salary, it's a\ndecrease in the salary. Same thing.\nMS. MILLETT: The definition again on 3A\nincludes not just increase, but includes an unfavorable\nchange in the terms. And so it's not settled whether --\nJUSTICE BREYER: You mean unfavorable change\nin terms, unfavorable change in terms.\nMS. MILLETT: Exactly.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, suppose you don't\nhave, you don't have any terms because you never did it\nbefore. There's no change in terms.\nMS. MILLETT: If you're a new customer --\nand again, I want to reiterate that, how this applies to\nexisting accounts is complicated --\nJUSTICE BREYER: You mean those words\n\"change in terms\" refer to rates, in other words?\nThat's a rather odd way to refer to it. In one place,\nyou refer to an \"increase\"; in the other place, you'd\nrefer to it as a \"change in terms.\" That's sort of an\nodd way to write a statute.\nMS. MILLETT: Well, you can have a change in\nterms that is not necessarily an increase. It could be\nyou will no longer be entitled to a free rental car when\nyour car is in for repair for some reason. That's not\nan increase.\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, no, I understand that.\nBut what we're after is this. Everybody has a credit\nreport, just about. You put it in and you give people\nthe best possible rate conceivable, and now, how do you\nknow that maybe there could have still been a better\nrate? And it can't be that the statute intends you to\nsend out notices in such circumstances or you'd have to\nsend notices whenever you read a credit report. Now, I\nthink that's, I've overstated slightly, but that's\nbasically the argument. So what's your response?\nMS. MILLETT: And Justice Breyer, my\nresponse is that if the content of the information in\nyour credit report would have made you -- had it been\nbetter information you'd have gotten a better rate, a\nbetter result, your pocketbook wouldn't have been hit as\nhard, you have a dollars and cents injury because of the\ncontent of the information, then you had an adverse\naction.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay, so your response is\njust to repeat my question and say that's right?\nMS. MILLETT: No. If I could continue on\nthat, if I could add on, if I could add on, the way\ninsurance companies work is they don't have 3 million\ncustomers and 3 million rates. They have ranges and\nmost of them will have a top tier. They may have\nspecialized things for employees, but putting aside a\nspecialized category, there's a top range and they will\ntell you, as they say in the briefs, that 10 to 15\npercent of people fit in there. So they know what the\nbest rate is. They know what the next, above average\nrate, the standard rate.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: How do you fit, how do you\nfit that within the language of the statute? Is it, I\nfail -- you're a first- time customer and I fail to give\nyou a, you know, a break that maybe you could have had.\nIs it a denial or cancellation of insurance? No. Is it\nan increase in, an increase in any charge for insurance?\nIs it a reduction or other adverse or unfavorable change\nin the terms of coverage or in the amount of any\ninsurance? I find it hard to shoehorn your case into\nthat language.\nMS. MILLETT: Well, to begin with, that may\nbe why Petitioners' position here certainly was not\nreckless and the Ninth Circuit erred. But we do think\nthat the statutory language read as a whole supports\nthis. It could be a denial of a particular term in an\ninsurance contract. But you have to look at -- it's\nimportant to understand you look --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I read the term as, as one\nof the Justices here does, not referring to the rate.\nThe earlier part refers to the rate. An increase in any\ncharge for, that's the rate. And then it speaks of\nchange in the terms of coverage. I mean, that is, you\nknow, whether it covers hurricanes, or in the amount of\nthe insurance, whether you're insured for --\nMS. MILLETT: Or it could be a reduction in\nthe terms. I mean, these things are statutory\nconstruction issues to be litigated, and the important\nissue here -- and they are presented in this case.\nThey're to be litigated and the important issue is that\nwhen there is fair debate about these issues insurance\ncompanies will not be held to be willfully violating the\nstatute if they got the answer wrong.\nBut I think on the, on the substantive\nquestion, it's important to read \"adverse action\" in\nlight of, if I could just finish the sentence, in light\nof the definition of when a notice is required to be\nissued, which turns upon the content of the information\nin the report.\nThank you.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Which is where?\nMS. MILLETT: And that's on page 6a on our\nappendix.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Shorr.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF SCOTT A. SHORR\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. SHORR: Mr. Chief Justice and may it\nplease the Court:\nWhen Congress intended to require a knowing\nviolation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act, it expressly\nsaid so. It did not do so in connection with the claims\nhere under Section 1681n(a)(1)(A). In each instance\nwhere Congress wanted to allow -- to require a higher\nmens rea, it said so and did so in connection with\nliability that was greater. They required knowing mens\nrea for the criminal provision. They required knowing\nmens rea to obtain the even higher statutory damages\nthat are available under the act.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: What do you say to the\nargument from drafting history that looks at the history\nboth of little n and little o and it points out that as\noriginally, in the original bill, little o providing for\nthe actual damages required a finding of gross\nnegligence? Little n used the word \"willful\" just as it\ndoes now, suggesting that willful would not include\ngross negligence or something close to gross negligence\nlike recklessness. Then in, then in o, they changed the\nstandard from gross negligence to mere negligence, but\nthey made no change in n, which suggests that n stayed\nwhatever it always was, and if the argument from\ncontrast was that n probably meant knowing rather than\nreckless, it stayed knowing even when the standard was\nchanged to negligence in o. What do you say to that\nargument?\nMR. SHORR: Justice Souther, I think the\nonly thing we can say about that is Congress reduced the\nculpability for the actual damages from gross negligence\nto negligence. I don't think that tells us much about\nwillful means, what willful means as a separate matter.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But the fact that they had\noriginally drafted n as it is, in contrast to the\noriginal o, does tell us, doesn't it, something about\nwhat they had in mind in n. And they must have had\nsomething in mind, probably had in mind, something in n\nwhich was a standard higher than gross negligence.\nMR. SHORR: No, Justice Souter, I suggest\nthat what you can infer from that is that, if anything,\nis perhaps Congress wanted to move, make clear that\nunder o the actual damages aren't close to willful or\nreckless, so they reduced gross negligence to negligence\nin that circumstance. But that still doesn't tell us\nseparately what \"willful\" meant, and of course \"willful\"\nhad been interpreted by this Court in similar cases\ninvolving similar statutes to mean a knowing or reckless\ndisregard. And I respectfully disagree with --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, I mean, there's no\nquestion it has been and that is sort of the usual\nreading in the civil context. But we also keep\nrepeating, you know, \"willful\" is a word of many\nmeanings and you always look to the context. And here\nthe argument is that if you look to the context of the,\nof the two statutory sections right up next to each\nother, you can draw a, an inference about what \"willful\"\nmeans.\nMR. SHORR: I think if anything, Justice\nSouter, here the context should be the actual statutory\nterms used, and in Section 1681n(b) they expressly\nrequired the knowing standard and that's a knowing\nviolation of the law, as Justice Alito's question seemed\nto draw out, a knowing impermissible purpose. And the\nstatute directly defines what a permissible purpose is\nunder this law.\nSo that reference to knowing could not refer\nto a knowing, knowing the facts. And of course, willful\nin some sense always includes some knowledge of the\nfactual circumstances.\nIn addition, the logical structure of the\nact -- as I mentioned, we had negligence and actual\ndamages. We have a reckless standard, a knowing or\nreckless standard for certain statutory damages, but\nthen an even higher level for the criminal and higher\nstatutory penalty provisions. And as I started to say,\na willful, knowing, reckless standard is entirely\nconsistent with how this Court has interpreted the term\nin similar civil statutes that were in fact passed about\nthe same time the Hazen Paper case and Thurston and\nMcLaughlin cases interpreting the ADA and the FLSA and\nother similar cases.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, even if\nyou're right about the standard, how can you suggest\nthat it's willful here when you have no judicial\nconstruction, you have no administrative construction,\nyou have the statutory language that at least the\nquestions this morning have suggested is not perfectly\nclear? How can you suggest that the action of the\ncompanies on this case even under your standard was\nwillful?\nMR. SHORR: Mr. Chief Justice, of course we\nbelieve and the statute is in fact clear, you do not\nneed further interpretation by the Court.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So if we don't agree\nwith you on that, you would lose on the application of\nthe willfulness standard?\nMR. SHORR: If you don't agree with us --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: In other words,\nyour, your, your conclusion that this was a willful\nviolation depends upon your assertion that the statute\nis perfectly clear?\nMR. SHORR: I think that there is a level of\nobjective component that the statute at least has to be\nunderstood by a reasonable person at some level using\nstandard statutory construction. But that isn't to\nsuggest that the statute needs to be interpreted by a\nhigher court or even a district court for counsel to get\nguidance. And of course, in this case, there was no\nguidance supporting Respondents -- excuse me -- no\nguidance supporting Petitioners', defendants', position.\nIn fact, the only guidance supported our position,\nincluding guidance from the FTC.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You're talking about\nthe Ball letter?\nMR. SHORR: I am talking about the Ball\nletter.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That wasn't even\nbinding on the commission, so why would that be regarded\nas authoritative?\nMR. SHORR: It was not, and we are not\nsuggesting it is, although it's entitled to Chevron\ndeference. But if you get past the minimal level of\nobjective standard, the question becomes what indicia\nand markers were out there that would have guided this\ncompany as to whether there was a high risk that they\nwere violating the act. And certainly the Ball letter,\nwhich was sent by the staff specifically to address this\nexact question and to guide insurance companies, gave\nnotice and it said charging anyone a higher amount than\nthe best available rate based on their credit score was\nan adverse action. And in addition, there was --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, how could that be? I\nmean I agree that the statute is clear, but I think it's\nclear the other way. That is, if you look at the\nlanguage, as you've just heard, if you look at the\npurpose it's very hard to reconcile with the purpose an\ninstance where a person has continuous accidents. He's\na reckless driver. His insurance company puts him in\njust a category below the bottom and they read his\ncredit report and they discover, despite his faults, he\nalways pays his bills on time. So they increase it, not\nto the top category, but they give him a much better\ndeal. And you're saying this statute means that what I\njust described is an adverse action based on a credit\nreport?\nMR. SHORR: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes. Okay. And then if\nyou're going to say yes, I want to hear why yes, and\nthen in light of the following: The little boy who says\nwolf. You're probably puzzled what I mean by that. I\nmean that if you're right in that interpretation, there\nwill be tens of millions of notices going out and\nthey'll have the same effect on the public that these\nprivacy notices have today. We get them every day,\ndozens of them, and they go right in the wastebasket,\nbecause they will become meaningless because to an\naverage person that notice will not mean that he better\nlook at his credit report. It will mean throw it in the\nwastebasket.\nAll right, now I've got the purpose, I've\ngot the language, and I have what I think of as common\nsense. Now, you explain why it's obvious the opposite.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: This is a different\nquestion. We've been talking about willful up to now.\nMR. SHORR: Yes, and this is the adverse\naction question.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You haven't addressed\nadverse action at all.\nMR. SHORR: And I'm happy to do so now.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes. But, was there\nanything further on willful? You said that the statute\nwas clear enough and you had the FTC informal advice,\nbut now we know that courts have divided on this\nquestion, right? On --\nMR. SHORR: Divided in the sense -- well,\nthe Ninth Circuit of course overturned the district\ncourt's ruling so there's no current division, but if\nthat's what you mean, yes, Your Honor.\nIn a -- I guess I'll address quickly your\nquestion. There's additional guidance provided by the\nFTC that was subject to formal rulemaking and that was\n16 CFR, I believe it's Part 601 Appendix C, and in that\ninstance the FTC, again subject to formal notice and\ncomment of rulemaking, said that the statute is defined\nvery broadly and it includes any action that can even be\nconsidered to have a negative impact. And that plays in\nthe subjective aspect as well, but addressing your\nquestion, Justice Breyer, first on the statutory\nlanguage --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's pretty sloppy\nlawyering, don't you think, any action that even be\nconsidered to have -- wow. This is a standard?\nMR. SHORR: That was --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Any action that can even be\nconsidered to have a negative impact.\nMR. SHORR: That was guidance, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: This is guidance?\nMR. SHORR: That was guidance. That was\nguidance to provide in the context of reading this\nstatute, it should be read broadly.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But you know, I would tell\nmy CEO ignore that, that it's meaningless.\nMR. SHORR: In addition, the CEO would have\nthe guidance provided by the Ball letter.\nBut again addressing your question, Justice\nBreyer, an increase based on credit, if we had let's say\nan increase based on race, someone goes in and has a\nproduct to buy and there's the best rate, and they\ncharge someone else based on their race a higher rate,\ncertainly that's an increase based on credit. There's\nonly one best rate.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But this is not an\nantidiscrimination provision. It doesn't say anyone who\ndiscriminates in the setting of race has to send out\nletters. It requires an adverse action. It requires an\nincrease in the charge.\nMR. SHORR: And Your Honor, I was only using\nthat example to try and explain the statutory language.\nJUSTICE BREYER: It doesn't explain it\nbecause if you have an increase in the charge based on\nrace, of course that's an increase based on race.\nMR. SHORR: Well, here we have --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And if you refuse to give a\nperson the best rate, and lower his rate but not the\nbest rate, based on race, that is not an increase based\non race. That is discrimination based on race.\nMR. SHORR: You're charging someone more\nbased on credit.\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's true, and it's a\ndiscrimination, but you didn't increase the rate. You\ndecreased it.\nMR. SHORR: I think --\nJUSTICE BREYER: It's still a\ndiscrimination, it's still unlawful.\nMR. SHORR: Applying it to credit, a natural\ndefinition that is charging someone more than you charge\nothers is an increase.\nJUSTICE ALITO: When you say more, in order\nfor there to be an adverse action there has to be an\nincrease or an unfavorable change. And when you have an\ninitial application you have to figure out what is the\nbaseline in order to determine whether there has been an\nincrease or an adverse action. And you and the\nSolicitor General just assert that the baseline in that\nsituation is the best possible rate that you can get,\nbut I don't understand where that comes from.\nMR. SHORR: Because charging someone more\nthan someone else who qualifies for that better rate\nbased on their credit, is increasing them, charging them\nmore, but it's also evident from the statutory purpose,\nwhich I think was a question you asked --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Let me look at the\nlanguage. Go back to give me -- because in ordinary\nEnglish, which I hope I speak, it is not an increase,\nbut maybe there is a technical term in the technical\nlanguage of commercial law or in FTC law where the word\nincrease means decrease. And if you -- is there\nanything you want -- no. It's a serious question, at\nleast if you want to cite me to some authority that uses\nthis word increase in the way you just suggested.\nMR. SHORR: We believe that it's a standard\ndictionary definition, to charge someone more for\ninsurance than they would otherwise qualify for is\nincreasing their charge.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Which dictionary shall I\nlook at?\nMR. SHORR: I think we can look at any\ndictionary. I don't have a cite, Your Honor, but --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: They're making this\nargument, and I think you got close to it a minute ago\nwhen you alluded to statutory purpose. I think this is\nwhat's behind, and you tell me if I'm wrong. One\npurpose of the statute is to alert a consumer that the\nconsumer's credit report may contain errors which are\ndoing the consumer some kind of damage.\nMR. SHORR: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And you want this consumer\nalerted so the consumer can ask to see the report and\ncorrect it if possible.\nMR. SHORR: That's exactly right.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Reading the adverse action\nthe way you read it, it would give the consumer or\nconsumers a tip-off in the maximum number of cases. In\nevery case in which the consumer might have done better\nif the credit report had assumed different facts, on\nyour reading theoretically, the consumer is going to say\nI want to look at that report and correct it if it's\nwrong. But isn't the fallacy of that argument the\nfallacy of saying because that is one object of the\nstatute, every term within the statute has got to be\nread in a way that maximizes the effectuation of that\nobject? And the trouble that we're having on the bench\nis that discrimination and increase are different terms.\nIncrease says the rate actually goes up from a baseline\nthat the consumer previously had, whereas discrimination\ndoes not. And your reading in effect, increase to mean\ndiscrimination in order to maximize the likelihood that\nthe consumer will look at the report, isn't that the\nbasis of your argument?\nMR. SHORR: I think it has to be an increase\nbased on some aspect, but the only way to give effect to\nthat statutory purpose is an increase above what you\nwould otherwise qualify for had you had better credit\nand of course --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, that's a way to give\nevery conceivable effect to that policy. But the\nstatute in drafting adverse, or drafting the terms of\nadverse action, may very well have said we don't want to\ngive every conceivable effect to this purpose because if\nwe do, we'll get into the situation that Justice Breyer\ndescribed. Everybody will be getting notices and the\nnotices will be meaningless.\nMR. SHORR: I don't think the notice is\nproblematic because you're alerting the consumer to\ncheck that the information that the insurance company\nexpressly relied on to increase your charge --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: To set the charge. I mean,\nthat's circular. To set the charge that it gives you.\nMR. SHORR: I don't think you need a prior\ncharge to suffer an increase. If I walk into a candy\nstore and I've never purchased that candy before but the\nbest price that day is 5 cents but they say we're going\nto charge you 10 cents, I've certainly suffered an\nincrease.\nJUSTICE BREYER: By that you're talking\nlinguistically, but I am interested in the purpose. So\nI looked up on the Internet approximately what percent\nof the people have the best credit score and that's\nabout 1 percent. So 99 percent of the public doesn't\nhave the best possible credit score. Now I take it that\nmeans that you could in fact, if it's even roughly\nright, have 99 percent or a little less or even perhaps\na little more when they look at that report that, since\nit's not perfect in 99 percent of the cases, it's quite\npossible that they won't get the best conceivable rate\nwhich might be reserved for just perfect people. And if\nthat's so, in 99 percent of the cases they'll send out\nnotices. And that's why I asked my question about the\nboy who calls wolf. What will happen if 99 percent of\nthe people who apply for insurance or any other thing\nget notices? I suspect that this is only intuitive,\nthat the notices are more likely to go into the\nwastebasket than they are if there was really a\ndecrease. Now, do you have any light you can shed on\nthat?\nMR. SHORR: Sure. The -- as an initial\nmatter, it's not the perfect credit that is the\nstandard, it's whatever would qualify you for GEICO's\nbest rate. And that's a much broader standard. We\ndon't know the exact amounts but if you look at GEICO JA\n6768, they have fairly broad tiers, maybe five or six.\nAnd of course not everyone is going to get the notice.\nIf your driving record totally eliminates -- if you have\ngreat credit but your driving record eliminates the\npossibility that you qualify for the better rate, you\nwouldn't get notice in that circumstance either. But\nthe key to the notice is, if I have very good credit but\nthe information that the insurance company looks at is\nincorrect, I will be charged more based on incorrect\ninformation without ever having the opportunity to tell\nthe insurance company or whoever is collecting that\ninformation for them, you've charged me the wrong amount\nand I in fact qualify for that better rate.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Don't you have that\nright independently, though, every year to look at a\ncopy of your credit report?\nMR. SHORR: Well, what's significant here,\nthat has been added to the statute in the last two\nyears. But since 1970, Congress's concern is giving\nnotice at a critical time, when the insurance company\ntells you we are relying on it and we may have taken an\nadverse action.\nI wanted to also mention, here it's not just\nan increase. There's also been a denial, and that\nMr. Edo applied for insurance from GEICO, and was denied\ninsurance with the stand-alone company GEICO General, so\nthat is also an adverse action under the act.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: When you say you\nlook at the increase with respect to the best credit\nrate, why is that? Why wouldn't you look at it relative\nto say the average insured who walks in the door?\nMR. SHORR: Because that -- GEICO's\nargument, and I think that's what they want, presumes\nthey're looking at accurate credit information. And the\nproblem is, Congress has always told that there is\nsignificant inadequacy in the credit information. I\nthink it's cited in the National Consumer Law Center\nbrief. In 1996, Congress was told that the error rate\nin consumer information was 50 percent and there was a\n20 percent serious error in the rates. Under GEICO's\ninterpretation --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I don't understand\nwhat pertinence that has to my question which is, why do\nyou get to pick the best credit report as the baseline\nfrom which you would measure your hypothetical increase?\nMR. SHORR: Because under GEICO's theory of\nthe statute you may never get notice, even though you're\nbeing charged more for insurance based on inaccurate\ninformation, as long as you're not charge -- your charge\ndoesn't move below average. So a lot of people who are\nin fact intended to be protected under this act will not\nbe protected until their charge goes below average, even\nthough the insurance company is continuing to charge\nthem more based on inaccurate information.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Why do we -- how do we know\nthat they were intended to be protected in this way by\ngetting this notice? That's the issue in the case.\nMR. SHORR: Because going through the\nstatute and the increase based on credit, and then the\nnotice will give them the opportunity to check. Since\nthe consumer here is the -- it's a system of checks and\nbalances, and unless you give this consumer the\nopportunity to check that they are in fact using the\ncorrect information, it wasn't mistaken, it wasn't\ndriven down by identity theft, you can continue to\ncharge people more --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. So that's --\nMR. SHORR: -- based on inaccurate\ninformation.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Your basic argument is the\nstatute, the definitions of adverse action have got to\nbe read in a way that maximizes the occasion upon which\na consumer will get a notice that may lead that consumer\nto ask to see his credit report. That's your basic\npremise?\nMR. SHORR: Both based on the premise and\npurpose of statute, yes.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: All right.\nMR. SHORR: Briefly addressing the\napplication of the standard to the facts in this case,\nwe do think it's appropriate to remand for further\nconsideration in light of some new developments. GEICO\nhas just recently produced documents to us that\naddressly -- directly address the question of scienter\nhere, so if there's -- if you go past a minimum\nthreshold --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I've read your reference\nto those documents. Explain why you think that's so\nimportant.\nMR. SHORR: Because those documents directly\naddress the subject of standard here, that GEICO was\nreckless or understood their --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: How do those documents\nshed any light on recklessness? I didn't see that.\nMR. SHORR: I'm sorry, Your Honor?\nJUSTICE STEVENS: How do the documents that\nyou describe shed any light on the extent of their\nrecklessness, if any?\nMR. SHORR: I want to be careful, because I\nhad presented -- I asked to lodge them with the Court\nand I can quote them if necessary, but within those\ndocuments there is direct evidence that GEICO\ninterpreted the statute exactly how we do, that not\nputting someone in the best tier based on credit --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Who's GEICO? I\nmean, you're talking about particular lawyers at a\nparticular level, an ongoing debate about what this law\nmeans. If you get one lawyer who says, you know, I\nthink you could read it this way, does that mean that\nGEICO reads it that way?\nMR. SHORR: No, Your Honor. In this\ninstance, this document involves top level GEICO\nexecutives. And with respect to the advice of counsel\nissue, frankly it's a red herring. We have never asked\nto compel the Defendants in either of these cases or any\nof the cases we're involved in, to waive their\nprivilege. They've got the right, of course, to offer\nadvice of counsel as an affirmative -- as a defense in\nthis case, but we don't believe it's necessary to prove\nour case to even reach what the counsel said. We\nbelieve we can prove our case based on the documents and\nsubjective intent alone.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I still don't really\nunderstand this part of the case very much. Assume that\na lawyer writes a letter saying you read it two or three\ndifferent ways, read the statute, it's very ambiguous,\nand we think the government's reading is the better\nreading. And the executives think about it and they say\nno, we don't think that's right. Has that proved\nreckless disregard?\nMR. SHORR: If the statute was clear and the\nguidance --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: If the statute's clear.\nAnd of course, Miss Mahoney said the district judge\nthought it was clear, but the other way.\nMR. SHORR: And with respect to the district\ncourt, we believe the district court here clearly erred,\nas the Ninth Circuit found. And the guidance -- that\nopinion certainly didn't precede the conduct that's at\nissue here. The only guidance, again, available at the\ntime supported our reading of the statute. There was no\nguidance from and court or from the FTC, or from\nanywhere that would have supported Defendants'\ninterpretation at that time. So that's another aspect\nof inquiry, the subjective intent of the Defendants.\nIf there are no other questions?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMs. Mahoney, you have four minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MAUREEN E. MAHONEY\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMS. MAHONEY: If I could start by just\nresponding to the issue of the new document, I just want\nto emphasize that this document was created by people\nwho weren't lawyers. It was done before GEICO even\nstarted using credit to price insurance. They were --\nsaid they were brainstorming about what the statute\nmight mean. And I would point the Court to the\nsupplemental excerpt of records at 504 where when GEICO\nimplemented the policy that we're talking about here,\nthe -- they said that the intent was that we would send\nto the people who were supposed to get the adverse\naction notice. With the early systems development we\ndidn't have the ability to identify whether they were\nsupposed to receive the notice or not; that was because\nthey had not yet developed the way to do with what they\ncall the neutral, where they compare how the applicant\nwould have done if they hadn't taken credit, hadn't\ntaken credit into account at all. And this is a\nprocedure that's required actually in most States in\norder to ensure that those who don't want to allow\naccess to credit reports or who don't have a sufficient\ncredit history are not treated adversely in the meaning\nof those State laws, and that means worse than the\naverage loss ratio. So there's nothing in this record,\neven if you take into account the documents they're\ntalking about, to suggest that there was somehow a\nknowing or deliberate intent to try to violate the law.\nWith respect to a few of the factual or --\nissues that came up, Safeco estimates that approximately\n80 percent of all consumers that they are selling new\ninsurance to now have to get notice under the standards\nestablished by the Ninth Circuit.\nWith respect to who can qualify for the top\ntier of credit, it's only, at least at GEICO,\napproximately 10 percent. So 90 percent of the\nconsumers would not qualify for that.\nAnd the statute very plainly does not\nprohibit differential treatment based on persons with\nbetter credit, nor do State laws. And so the analogy as\nto race discrimination simply don't hold water, because\nthere Congress has told you what the baseline is, you\ncan't treat any person of a different race in a\ndifferent way, and that's not true under this statute.\nAnd instead, it's quite reasonable, as GEICO has\nconcluded, to simply say look, if we wouldn't -- if\nwe're treating you worse than we would have treated you\nif we ever looked at your credit report, worse than if\nyou had an average loss ratio for this criteria, we'll\nsend you the notice.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Why did they use credit\nreports? Is it just a hedge against late premiums and\nthe cost of late premiums, or does it bear on risk\nfactors generally?\nMS. MAHONEY: Well, generally there are\nabout 15 factors that they look at to try to come up\nwith a prediction of loss ratio, and someone who has a\ngood credit history is generally regarded as\nresponsible, and responsible people tend to make less\nclaims. And so, again, it's just one factor of 15\nthough.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yeah. May I ask this\nquestion? The reading of the statute in subsection i\nabout, in the charges for insurance advice, seems to\nfavor your view. But subsection ii about denial of\nemployment really seems to read in favor of the\ngovernment's reading.\nMS. MAHONEY: Well actually, I think that\nwhen you factor in employment, it has -- it has the\nopposite effect. Because what happens here is if you're\nusing employment verification reports, consumer reports\nabout employment, there are all kinds of consumer\nreports. How do you tell who had the optimal employment\nhistory? How could the baseline be the best employment\nhistory possible?\nJUSTICE STEVENS: No. But my point is, it\nseems to me that getting a lesser salary, it just seems\nlike the first applicant would be an adverse employment\naction under subparagraph ii, just -- do you see what\nI'm trying to say?\nMS. MAHONEY: That if you -- that in other\nwords, if you gave someone a lower salary --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: It adversely affects any\ncurrent or prospective employee. Now the language in i\nisn't, it doesn't read that way. But the thing that's\ntroubling me is whether you should interpret i in the\nlight of what ii seems to say.\nMS. MAHONEY: Your Honor, I think that if\nGEICO in this example, if you actually pay them less\nbecause you looked at their credit report, then GEICO\nwould concede that that is in fact an adverse action.\nSo I don't think it's inconsistent at all.\nThank you, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\n(Whereupon, at 10:59 a.m., the case in the\nabove-entitled matters was submitted.)\n52:5

        "content": "(10:04 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument\nfirst this morning in 06-84, Safeco Insurance Company\nversus Burr, and 06-100, GEICO General Insurance Company\nversus Edo.\nMs. Mahoney.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MAUREEN E. MAHONEY\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMS. MAHONEY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nI'd like to turn first to the Ninth\nCircuit's interpretation of the term \"willfully\" and its\ndetermination that the case had to be remanded for\nfurther proceedings to permit an opportunity to explore\nPetitioners' communications with their counsel. We ask\nthis Court to find that there is no necessity for any\nsuch inquiry for waivers of attorney-client privilege\nbecause summary judgment should have been affirmed in\nthis case.\nPetitioners and their counsel, if you think\nabout what communications you might find, they could not\nhave known anything more about these statutory issues of\nfirst impression than the district court did. It's\nquestions of law. And if the district court's opinion\ndoes not reflect reckless disregard for the law, for the\nreading of the statute, then it would be inappropriate\nto characterize Petitioners' adoption of the very same\nviews as either a knowing or reckless violation of the,\nof the FCRA.\nThe first -- the Ninth Circuit nevertheless\nreached a contrary conclusion, and said it was time to\ngo ahead and look at privileged communications if the\nPetitioners wanted to defend the case, because they made\nself-interpretive errors about the meaning of willfully.\nAnd the first is that they read willfully in\nthis setting to mean recklessly, and relied on several\ncases where this Court has read the term willfully in\ncivil statutes to mean recklessly.\nBut this Court has said repeatedly that the\nword willfully is contextual, that you have to look at\nall of the sections of the statute to see how it's used\nto determine whether it means with knowledge that your\nconduct violates the law, or whether reckless violations\nare sufficient. And in this particular statute, unlike\nthe other three that were at issue, Congress has used\nthe term willfully in other sections of the law to mean,\nas Plaintiffs concede, that the Defendant knows that\ntheir conduct violates the Act.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it's also used in the\nphrase \"knowing and willfully.\" That appears in several\nother parts of the statute, and that wouldn't make any\nsense if the only meaning of willful is knowing.\nMS. MAHONEY: Well, it actually says\n\"willfully and knowingly --\"\nJUSTICE SCALIA: In one formulation or\nanother, but it combines the two words, knowing and\nwillful.\nMS. MAHONEY: Well, this Court, though, has\nheld that willfully and knowingly, when that phrase is\nused together, it's been discussed in a number of cases\nincluding Dixon recently, that it means -- willfully\nmeans knowledge that the conduct violates the law, and\nknowingly means knowledge of the relevant facts. And\nthat would make perfect sense in this setting, and so\nthe term willfully when, again, used --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You mean willfully alone?\nMS. MAHONEY: It --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Where -- where it -- where\nit means what you think it means, which is knowingly,\nthat does not mean knowing the facts? If you mistake\nthe facts and are laboring under a misimpression of the\nfacts, you have nonetheless willfully violated the law?\nMS. MAHONEY: Your Honor, in Ratzlaf, the\nphrase was willfully, not willfully and knowingly, and\nthe Court held that it meant that you knew that your\nconduct violated the law. And that seems to be the most\nreasonable reading here because if you look, there are\nalso sections of Section 1681n that refer to knowing\nconduct, and that would require the conclusion that\nCongress used willfully in this section to mean a -- a\nless -- a more -- a less culpable mens rea than\nknowingly. And that's --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So that if you're\nthe CEO of your company, and a lawyer -- Federal counsel\ncomes in and says we've got a real issue under the Fair\nCredit Reporting Act, I need to brief you on that, we\nneed to make an important decision about whether we are\ncomplying, you say I don't want to hear about it, I\ndon't want to know about it. That would not be\nwillfully violating the statute?\nMS. MAHONEY: Well, under -- some cases have\nsuggested that there could be a willful blindness\ninstruction that would govern whether you define that as\nknowing or not. Certainly --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So it doesn't have\nto be actual knowledge?\nMS. MAHONEY: I think that the best reading\nof knowingly is actual knowledge or something that is,\nthat is everything but, you know, that really is --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: How about reckless\ndisregard?\nMS. MAHONEY: Well, conscious disregard is a\nrecklessness standard, and even if the Ninth Circuit\ncorrectly determined that this should be interpreted as\na recklessness standard, this Court has defined\nrecklessness to mean that it has to be conscious\ndisregard, actual knowledge of a high risk of, of -- of\nharm or in this case illegality. And in these\ncircumstances, you can't say that there was a high risk\nof illegality because what the district court found is\nthat the Petitioners' interpretations of the statute\nwere actually not only reasonable, but correct, and\nhaving --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Since the term knowingly or\nknowing appears in two places in 1681n, can't we infer\nfrom that that willfully in that provision also means\nsomething different?\nMS. MAHONEY: I think the way it's used, it\nsays knowing, knowingly that they did not have a\npermissible purpose. Permissible purpose, that may not\nbe knowledge of the law, it just may be knowledge that\nyour purpose wasn't permissible. And even if they were\nusing it --\nJUSTICE ALITO: I thought the statute says\nwhat the permissible purposes are.\nMS. MAHONEY: It does, but it doesn't\nnecessarily mean that the individual knew precisely what\nthe statute said. Because for instance, users are told\nwhat the permissible purposes are when they get a credit\nreport from, from a credit agency. But more\nimportantly, Your Honor, I think that the use of the\nterm knowingly there can also be explained.\nIf you look at Section 1681h, it actually\nprovides that certain tort actions cannot proceed unless\nthere is a willful intent to injure, except as provided\nin Section 1681n, and they are the same kinds of actions\nthat are carved out in 1681n.\nAnd so I think it was to make clear, I think\nit was to make clear that you didn't have to have a\nwillful intent to injure. So even if they meant it to\nbe interchangeable with a knowing violation of the law\nthere, I think there was a reason for it, it wasn't just\nsurplusage. It was to clarify that they didn't have to\nhave a willful intent to violate.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Would you say it's all\nright to use the model penal code definition of\nreckless, which is basically what you -- taking it here,\nyou would have to consciously disregard a substantial\nand unjustifiable risk that the action is unlawful?\nMS. MAHONEY: That's correct, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: If you come across anything\nthat would use that, I mean \"reckless\" itself is\nunclear. The model penal code tried to clarify it based\non this Court's opinions primarily.\nMS. MAHONEY: But I think you can look to\nthe way this Court described recklessness in Farmer vs.\nBrennan as well, though, as well as --\nJUSTICE BREYER: What's the difference?\nMS. MAHONEY: The difference is just, there\nis two forms of recklessness. One which says that if\nthe risk is sufficiently high, if a person should have\nknown, you could be -- you could be liable. But that\nthe form of recklessness that Congress presumably used\nhere in this setting, where there is the potential for\nvery punitive sanctions, was what is referred to --\nFarmer versus Brennan calls it \"criminal,\" the criminal\nrecklessness standard.\nAnd that means that not only do you have to\nhave an objectively high risk of illegality, but you\nmust be actually conscious of that risk. But in this\ncase, you don't even need to get to the issue of\nconsciousness.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, you said there is no\nway they couldn't have been conscious of the risk here.\nI mean, after all, that's why they went to lawyers.\nThey know there's risk that this is unlawful.\nMS. MAHONEY: The question is --\nJUSTICE BREYER: But consciousness, I mean,\nmaybe it should come in in the standard, but I don't\nknow that that would help you.\nMS. MAHONEY: I think the issue of conscious\n-- the risk, though, it has to be a high risk. And if\nit is a reasonable interpretation of the statute, or\neven if it is an interpretation of the statute that is\nfairly debatable, that you have a fair chance of\nsuccess, then how can you say that is a high risk of\nillegality, so high that we should say that Congress\nwanted to sanction you for taking that position?\nAnd for saying that, you know, you shouldn't\nbe permitted to adopt a compliance program if there was\na fair ground for believing that it was lawful. And\nhere what the Ninth Circuit did --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Suppose there is a fair\nground for believing it was lawful. Lawyers are in\ndisagreement, but in fact, I believe the lawyers who say\nit is unlawful, and I nonetheless go ahead and do it.\nIs that a willful violation?\nMS. MAHONEY: I don't, I don't think so,\nYour Honor, if, in fact, it was a fair ground for -- -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But I think I'm violating.\nMS. MAHONEY: I don't -- yes. But you\ncouldn't know you were violating it, and because if it\nreally is a fair ground for litigation --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I'm a better lawyer than my\nadvisors.\n(Laughter.)\nMS. MAHONEY: Your Honor, I think if it's an\narea where the law is truly unsettled. And here an\nissue of first impression, a lawyer's assessment that\nyou may lose is inherently predictive. These are not\ntrue or false answers when there is almost nothing to go\non.\nAnd so in that area, it's much like what\nthis Court did in Screws, where it said that this was a\ncase involving a willful violation of, or interference\nwith rights secured by -- by Federal law. And what the\nCourt says, well, it's not just any bad purpose that\nCongress had in mind, it is a bad purpose to defy\nannounced rules of law. They have to be, there has to\nbe sufficient clarity in the law to say that there was a\nhigh risk of illegality that you could disregard.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Would you look to the\nsubjective intent of the actor at all?\nMS. MAHONEY: Only --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Or would you just look to\nthe outcome and say, well, you know, it was a close\nquestion, so even if the actor indeed thought he was in\nviolation, it was a close question; it's okay?\nMS. MAHONEY: I don't think you would look\nat the intent until you found that there -- there was no\nreasonable ground or at least no, no -- no fair ground\nfor debate about the question. And at that point, Your\nHonor, if there was an objectively high risk of\nillegality, then you do have to ask, what were they\nconsciously aware of; what did they do?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I must say that -- that is\nnot the normal meaning of willful, willfully violating\nthe law.\nMS. MAHONEY: Well, I think in Screws --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You're changing it to mean\nwillfully, willfully and blatantly violating the law.\nMS. MAHONEY: I don't think so.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, if I know that what\nI'm doing is in violation of the law, even if it's a\nclose question, it seems to me I am willfully violating\nthe law.\nMS. MAHONEY: Your Honor, Screws says you\ncan't know the unknowable. And if the law, if it's\nreally, truly an issue of first impression, you may\nthink you're violating the law, but you -- you can't\nknow the unknowable. And that's why this setting is so\nimportant, because you can't, you know, put -- impose\nsanctions. Here we're talking about the potential for\nan industry facing billions of dollars without any\nactual harm to -- to individuals. And that --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Is it really billions?\nHow many of these have been certified as class actions?\nMS. MAHONEY: I believe that there are two\ncertified class actions. But many -- there are many\ncases pending and it could be billions of dollars, Your\nHonor. Certainly if the classes are certified, and --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Would you, would you, as\nrepresentative of the insurers, would you have a sound\nobjection to class action certification in these cases?\nMS. MAHONEY: Your Honor, I'm sure there\nwould be some bases to resist. But classes have been\ncertified, so I --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And gone to, gone to\njudgment?\nMS. MAHONEY: I do not believe any have gone\nto judgment, but I don't, I don't -- I think that the\npoint is that if you allow a thousand dollar penalty or\nthe potential for a thousand dollar penalty for every\nconsumer who didn't get a notice, simply because they\nmay have gotten a better price if they had even better\ncredit, across the country, if you interpret the statute\nthat way, and then you can say you can get this thousand\ndollar, what is in essence a penalty, and you multiply\nthat by the number of consumers, then you certainly have\nthe potential for very, very substantial liability.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: It's a question how many\nwill sue for a thousand dollars, given the litigation\ncosts.\nMS. MAHONEY: Well, given that these are\nproceeding as class actions, the answer is there is\nplenty on the line to incentivize plaintiffs' attorneys\nto bring these class actions, and they have been\nbrought, and this is a class action. There are two\nclass actions.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: They haven't -- neither\nhas been certified, has it?\nMS. MAHONEY: No, it has not. They are\nputative class actions, Your Honor. But I, but I think\nthat whether it's a class action or not, we have to look\nat what did, what did Congress presumably have in mind\nwhen it authorized these kinds of penalties and punitive\ndamages based on a willful violation in a technical area\nwhere there is no potential for harm? And certainly --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I have just two, two\nquestions on, on willful and then -- because you may\nwant to talk about the other issue in the case. First,\nyou began by saying that here a district judge has come\nto the contrary conclusion; by definition, it can't be\nreckless. Do you have any authority, where we -- for\nthat proposition, where we have said that?\nMS. MAHONEY: Well --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: We find all the time that\na right is not clearly established under AEDPA, and so\nforth -- and disregard what I just said. That's my\nfirst question.\nAnd the second is willfully, as Screws\nitself makes very clear, it is interpreted differently\nin the criminal context than it is in the civil context.\nMS. MAHONEY: Except Screws, Your Honor,\nactually says that it was adopting a criminal\nrecklessness standard, not a knowing standard, but a\nreckless standard. And that is the same standard that\nhas been applied in the civil cases that use willfully\nin the punitive damages context.\nSo I think it's exactly the same standard in\nthat Screws does say that the, you can't have, it can't\njust be a bad purpose, that it has to have been a bad\npurpose to violate clearly defined rules. And this\nCourt has said in various contexts in the, in the\nqualified immunity area that picking the losing side\ndoes not mean that your conduct was objectively, you\nknow, wrongful.\nAnd that's really -- I think that there is\ngreat significance to the district court's ruling. I'm\nnot saying that in every case, it would absolutely be\ndispositive. I think you have to look at what was the,\nyou know, the clarity of the law, what was the reasoning\nof the district court. But what the Ninth Circuit did\nis that it, in essence, said that you can't rely on\ncreative but unlikely answers to issues of first\nimpression.\nWell, if an administration official goes to\na lawyer in the administration and asks about a course\nof conduct, and is told, well, it's completely an issue\nof first impression, there is probably a 40 percent\nchance of success, do you say it's reckless to proceed\non that basis?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, just because\nan issue is one of first impression doesn't mean there's\na high degree of uncertainty. The statute may be\nclearly addressed to that issue. It hasn't come up\nbefore.\nMS. MAHONEY: Absolutely, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: First impression.\nMS. MAHONEY: It certainly -- this Court has\nmade clear that if the language of the statute is very\nplain, then, of course, that can be noticed, that can be\nadequate warning. But certainly this statute doesn't\nsatisfy that standard. Congress didn't provide the\nbenchmarks that you have to use for comparison to\ndetermine whether there has been an increase in a charge\nor whether there has been an adverse action based on the\nconsumer report. You need benchmarks to answer those\nquestions, and there aren't any regulations and there\nwere no cases.\nIf I could save the balance of my time for\nrebuttal.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel.\nMs. Millett.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF PATRICIA A. MILLETT,\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMS. MILLETT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe Court of Appeals correctly concluded\nthat willfulness in the civil context, as is used here,\nincludes a reckless disregard component or a\nrecklessness component. That is what this Court has\nheld in a number of cases that have similar uses of\nwillfulness focused on a departure from the law, have\nheld. Thurston, Richland Shoe and Hazen Paper are the\nthree that have been most discussed in the case, in the\npapers here.\nBut where the Ninth Circuit misstepped here\nwas in the application of that standard. And in\nparticular, we agreed with Petitioners that when it\nconcluded that a creative but unlikely position\nconstitutes recklessness, it erred. Recklessness speaks\nan extreme deviation from an ordinary standard of care.\nIt requires that the defendant act in the face of or\nfail to act --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: It is a subjective\nstandard or an objective standard?\nMS. MILLETT: It has both in this context.\nIt is, I think, first and foremost, an objective\ncomponent, because there is -- this is a civil case.\nIt's not purely subjective. And that objective\ncomponent is very important because that is what makes\nthe act or inaction reckless, and that is the risk.\nThere has to be an objectively high and obvious risk.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: So if the potential\nliability, as in these cases, is huge, then you have to\nbe even more careful because there is liability so\ngreat. So is it the greater the liability -- the\ngreater chance of recklessness, the greater the\npotential liability?\nMS. MILLETT: No, to the extent you're\ntalking about dollar liability, I don't think that's\ntrue. I do think it's fair to say that in recklessness\ngenerally in the tort law, the more serious an injury\nthat could result, can -- we'll tolerate less risk. If\nthe risk is causing serious bodily injury or death to\nsomebody, we'll -- the law will tolerate a lesser degree\nof risk than it will if, if it's simply causing, you\nknow, a delay in something or a sort of paper injury or\nmaybe even a dollar injury.\nAnd it's not set. It's a variable\ncalculation. So in that sense, it is. I don't think\nthat when we talk about a high and objective risk in\nthis context, we are talking about the dollars that a,\nthat a company would have to pay, although I'm sure they\nare interested in hearing about that from their lawyers.\nWhat we are talking about here -- and this\nis a very unusual statute the way it's written -- the\nliability itself, not just the damages, but the\nliability itself turns upon the extent of departure from\nlaw. You have to -- there is no recovery here like\nthere is in almost -- or commonly in Federal statutes\nfor just a violation. That isn't it.\nYou have to show either a willful violation\nor a negligent violation, and that requires a\ndetermination not only that the defendants violated the\nlaw, but a determination as to how much, how far, how\nmany standard deviations from correct their position was\nand that is an objective determination.\nOnce an objectively high risk has been found\nby a court, then -- then the case can shift to looking\ninto subjective things. I think a plaintiff would be\nentitled, once an objectively high and obvious risk has\nbeen found by the court, to rely on that, and allow a\njury to, or a judge, whoever is deciding the case, to\ninfer the existence of willfulness from that. And\nthat's often when defendants -- I'm sorry.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I also ask, do you\nagree with the Petitioner on the meaning of adverse\naction?\nMS. MILLETT: No, we agree with Respondents\non the meaning of adverse action.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Correct me if I'm\nwrong. You think if I have an insurance policy, I'm\npaying a certain rate, they look at my credit report and\nthey say, you know, good news, we're going to lower your\nrates, that's an adverse action because they might have\nlowered the rates even further if they had notified me\nabout the credit report and there were some errors in\nit?\nMS. MILLETT: Right. It's a complicated\nanswer, in part because that assumes that you have an\nexisting account and you're not an initial account here.\nAnd when you have an existing account, there's a\ndefinition of adverse action for insurance provisions,\nbut in iv there is a separate, there's another\ndefinition, and this is on, on page -- sorry. Excuse\nme. On page 3A of the appendix to our brief, iv under\nbig I -- I'm sorry, there's a lot of provisions -- talks\nabout reviewing an existing account, and it\ncross-referenced another provision which talks about\nreviewing an account for purposes of termination. And\nthat would include, in our view, not only completely\ncanceling it, but terminating the existing and charging\nyou more for allowing you now to pay a new rate. So\nwhich would govern in that particular context is a\nlittle bit harder.\nBut it could, and here's logically why,\nbecause I think the understanding of \"increase\" that's\nat issue here is one that's very basic to the operation\nof this statute, and that is, did the content of your\ninformation in your credit report, if it had been\nbetter, could you have had a better rate or a better\ndeal.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right.\nMS. MILLETT: So have you been hit in the\npocketbook.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So if they lower, if\nthey lower the rates, you still say that that fits the\nmeaning of adverse action because they might have\nlowered them further if the information hadn't been\nerroneous?\nMS. MILLETT: It could have, and here -- in\nthis sense, it could be: In the same way that I, sort\nof the flip side, but in my office, if everybody in the\nhallway gets a 5 percent salary increase and I only get\na 1 percent salary increase, I am certainly better off,\nbut if the reason I got a lesser increase is because of\nmy gender or because of my credit report, it's an\nadverse action. So the fact that you're doing somewhat\nbetter doesn't mean --\nJUSTICE BREYER: That isn't how the statute\ndefines it.\nMS. MILLETT: Excuse me?\nJUSTICE BREYER: The statute says an adverse\naction is an increase in a charge for -- in connection\nwith underwriting.\nMS. MILLETT: But it also --\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's what it says. And\nthen it says an increase is -- and if you take an\nadverse action, i.e., if you increase it, and your\nincrease is based in whole or in part on information\ncontained in a consumer report, you have to send the\nthing. How did you get -- in your example, there was no\nincrease. I mean, in a charge. In your salary, it's a\ndecrease in the salary. Same thing.\nMS. MILLETT: The definition again on 3A\nincludes not just increase, but includes an unfavorable\nchange in the terms. And so it's not settled whether --\nJUSTICE BREYER: You mean unfavorable change\nin terms, unfavorable change in terms.\nMS. MILLETT: Exactly.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, suppose you don't\nhave, you don't have any terms because you never did it\nbefore. There's no change in terms.\nMS. MILLETT: If you're a new customer --\nand again, I want to reiterate that, how this applies to\nexisting accounts is complicated --\nJUSTICE BREYER: You mean those words\n\"change in terms\" refer to rates, in other words?\nThat's a rather odd way to refer to it. In one place,\nyou refer to an \"increase\"; in the other place, you'd\nrefer to it as a \"change in terms.\" That's sort of an\nodd way to write a statute.\nMS. MILLETT: Well, you can have a change in\nterms that is not necessarily an increase. It could be\nyou will no longer be entitled to a free rental car when\nyour car is in for repair for some reason. That's not\nan increase.\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, no, I understand that.\nBut what we're after is this. Everybody has a credit\nreport, just about. You put it in and you give people\nthe best possible rate conceivable, and now, how do you\nknow that maybe there could have still been a better\nrate? And it can't be that the statute intends you to\nsend out notices in such circumstances or you'd have to\nsend notices whenever you read a credit report. Now, I\nthink that's, I've overstated slightly, but that's\nbasically the argument. So what's your response?\nMS. MILLETT: And Justice Breyer, my\nresponse is that if the content of the information in\nyour credit report would have made you -- had it been\nbetter information you'd have gotten a better rate, a\nbetter result, your pocketbook wouldn't have been hit as\nhard, you have a dollars and cents injury because of the\ncontent of the information, then you had an adverse\naction.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay, so your response is\njust to repeat my question and say that's right?\nMS. MILLETT: No. If I could continue on\nthat, if I could add on, if I could add on, the way\ninsurance companies work is they don't have 3 million\ncustomers and 3 million rates. They have ranges and\nmost of them will have a top tier. They may have\nspecialized things for employees, but putting aside a\nspecialized category, there's a top range and they will\ntell you, as they say in the briefs, that 10 to 15\npercent of people fit in there. So they know what the\nbest rate is. They know what the next, above average\nrate, the standard rate.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: How do you fit, how do you\nfit that within the language of the statute? Is it, I\nfail -- you're a first- time customer and I fail to give\nyou a, you know, a break that maybe you could have had.\nIs it a denial or cancellation of insurance? No. Is it\nan increase in, an increase in any charge for insurance?\nIs it a reduction or other adverse or unfavorable change\nin the terms of coverage or in the amount of any\ninsurance? I find it hard to shoehorn your case into\nthat language.\nMS. MILLETT: Well, to begin with, that may\nbe why Petitioners' position here certainly was not\nreckless and the Ninth Circuit erred. But we do think\nthat the statutory language read as a whole supports\nthis. It could be a denial of a particular term in an\ninsurance contract. But you have to look at -- it's\nimportant to understand you look --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I read the term as, as one\nof the Justices here does, not referring to the rate.\nThe earlier part refers to the rate. An increase in any\ncharge for, that's the rate. And then it speaks of\nchange in the terms of coverage. I mean, that is, you\nknow, whether it covers hurricanes, or in the amount of\nthe insurance, whether you're insured for --\nMS. MILLETT: Or it could be a reduction in\nthe terms. I mean, these things are statutory\nconstruction issues to be litigated, and the important\nissue here -- and they are presented in this case.\nThey're to be litigated and the important issue is that\nwhen there is fair debate about these issues insurance\ncompanies will not be held to be willfully violating the\nstatute if they got the answer wrong.\nBut I think on the, on the substantive\nquestion, it's important to read \"adverse action\" in\nlight of, if I could just finish the sentence, in light\nof the definition of when a notice is required to be\nissued, which turns upon the content of the information\nin the report.\nThank you.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Which is where?\nMS. MILLETT: And that's on page 6a on our\nappendix.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Shorr.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF SCOTT A. SHORR\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. SHORR: Mr. Chief Justice and may it\nplease the Court:\nWhen Congress intended to require a knowing\nviolation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act, it expressly\nsaid so. It did not do so in connection with the claims\nhere under Section 1681n(a)(1)(A). In each instance\nwhere Congress wanted to allow -- to require a higher\nmens rea, it said so and did so in connection with\nliability that was greater. They required knowing mens\nrea for the criminal provision. They required knowing\nmens rea to obtain the even higher statutory damages\nthat are available under the act.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: What do you say to the\nargument from drafting history that looks at the history\nboth of little n and little o and it points out that as\noriginally, in the original bill, little o providing for\nthe actual damages required a finding of gross\nnegligence? Little n used the word \"willful\" just as it\ndoes now, suggesting that willful would not include\ngross negligence or something close to gross negligence\nlike recklessness. Then in, then in o, they changed the\nstandard from gross negligence to mere negligence, but\nthey made no change in n, which suggests that n stayed\nwhatever it always was, and if the argument from\ncontrast was that n probably meant knowing rather than\nreckless, it stayed knowing even when the standard was\nchanged to negligence in o. What do you say to that\nargument?\nMR. SHORR: Justice Souther, I think the\nonly thing we can say about that is Congress reduced the\nculpability for the actual damages from gross negligence\nto negligence. I don't think that tells us much about\nwillful means, what willful means as a separate matter.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But the fact that they had\noriginally drafted n as it is, in contrast to the\noriginal o, does tell us, doesn't it, something about\nwhat they had in mind in n. And they must have had\nsomething in mind, probably had in mind, something in n\nwhich was a standard higher than gross negligence.\nMR. SHORR: No, Justice Souter, I suggest\nthat what you can infer from that is that, if anything,\nis perhaps Congress wanted to move, make clear that\nunder o the actual damages aren't close to willful or\nreckless, so they reduced gross negligence to negligence\nin that circumstance. But that still doesn't tell us\nseparately what \"willful\" meant, and of course \"willful\"\nhad been interpreted by this Court in similar cases\ninvolving similar statutes to mean a knowing or reckless\ndisregard. And I respectfully disagree with --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, I mean, there's no\nquestion it has been and that is sort of the usual\nreading in the civil context. But we also keep\nrepeating, you know, \"willful\" is a word of many\nmeanings and you always look to the context. And here\nthe argument is that if you look to the context of the,\nof the two statutory sections right up next to each\nother, you can draw a, an inference about what \"willful\"\nmeans.\nMR. SHORR: I think if anything, Justice\nSouter, here the context should be the actual statutory\nterms used, and in Section 1681n(b) they expressly\nrequired the knowing standard and that's a knowing\nviolation of the law, as Justice Alito's question seemed\nto draw out, a knowing impermissible purpose. And the\nstatute directly defines what a permissible purpose is\nunder this law.\nSo that reference to knowing could not refer\nto a knowing, knowing the facts. And of course, willful\nin some sense always includes some knowledge of the\nfactual circumstances.\nIn addition, the logical structure of the\nact -- as I mentioned, we had negligence and actual\ndamages. We have a reckless standard, a knowing or\nreckless standard for certain statutory damages, but\nthen an even higher level for the criminal and higher\nstatutory penalty provisions. And as I started to say,\na willful, knowing, reckless standard is entirely\nconsistent with how this Court has interpreted the term\nin similar civil statutes that were in fact passed about\nthe same time the Hazen Paper case and Thurston and\nMcLaughlin cases interpreting the ADA and the FLSA and\nother similar cases.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, even if\nyou're right about the standard, how can you suggest\nthat it's willful here when you have no judicial\nconstruction, you have no administrative construction,\nyou have the statutory language that at least the\nquestions this morning have suggested is not perfectly\nclear? How can you suggest that the action of the\ncompanies on this case even under your standard was\nwillful?\nMR. SHORR: Mr. Chief Justice, of course we\nbelieve and the statute is in fact clear, you do not\nneed further interpretation by the Court.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So if we don't agree\nwith you on that, you would lose on the application of\nthe willfulness standard?\nMR. SHORR: If you don't agree with us --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: In other words,\nyour, your, your conclusion that this was a willful\nviolation depends upon your assertion that the statute\nis perfectly clear?\nMR. SHORR: I think that there is a level of\nobjective component that the statute at least has to be\nunderstood by a reasonable person at some level using\nstandard statutory construction. But that isn't to\nsuggest that the statute needs to be interpreted by a\nhigher court or even a district court for counsel to get\nguidance. And of course, in this case, there was no\nguidance supporting Respondents -- excuse me -- no\nguidance supporting Petitioners', defendants', position.\nIn fact, the only guidance supported our position,\nincluding guidance from the FTC.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You're talking about\nthe Ball letter?\nMR. SHORR: I am talking about the Ball\nletter.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That wasn't even\nbinding on the commission, so why would that be regarded\nas authoritative?\nMR. SHORR: It was not, and we are not\nsuggesting it is, although it's entitled to Chevron\ndeference. But if you get past the minimal level of\nobjective standard, the question becomes what indicia\nand markers were out there that would have guided this\ncompany as to whether there was a high risk that they\nwere violating the act. And certainly the Ball letter,\nwhich was sent by the staff specifically to address this\nexact question and to guide insurance companies, gave\nnotice and it said charging anyone a higher amount than\nthe best available rate based on their credit score was\nan adverse action. And in addition, there was --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, how could that be? I\nmean I agree that the statute is clear, but I think it's\nclear the other way. That is, if you look at the\nlanguage, as you've just heard, if you look at the\npurpose it's very hard to reconcile with the purpose an\ninstance where a person has continuous accidents. He's\na reckless driver. His insurance company puts him in\njust a category below the bottom and they read his\ncredit report and they discover, despite his faults, he\nalways pays his bills on time. So they increase it, not\nto the top category, but they give him a much better\ndeal. And you're saying this statute means that what I\njust described is an adverse action based on a credit\nreport?\nMR. SHORR: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes. Okay. And then if\nyou're going to say yes, I want to hear why yes, and\nthen in light of the following: The little boy who says\nwolf. You're probably puzzled what I mean by that. I\nmean that if you're right in that interpretation, there\nwill be tens of millions of notices going out and\nthey'll have the same effect on the public that these\nprivacy notices have today. We get them every day,\ndozens of them, and they go right in the wastebasket,\nbecause they will become meaningless because to an\naverage person that notice will not mean that he better\nlook at his credit report. It will mean throw it in the\nwastebasket.\nAll right, now I've got the purpose, I've\ngot the language, and I have what I think of as common\nsense. Now, you explain why it's obvious the opposite.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: This is a different\nquestion. We've been talking about willful up to now.\nMR. SHORR: Yes, and this is the adverse\naction question.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You haven't addressed\nadverse action at all.\nMR. SHORR: And I'm happy to do so now.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes. But, was there\nanything further on willful? You said that the statute\nwas clear enough and you had the FTC informal advice,\nbut now we know that courts have divided on this\nquestion, right? On --\nMR. SHORR: Divided in the sense -- well,\nthe Ninth Circuit of course overturned the district\ncourt's ruling so there's no current division, but if\nthat's what you mean, yes, Your Honor.\nIn a -- I guess I'll address quickly your\nquestion. There's additional guidance provided by the\nFTC that was subject to formal rulemaking and that was\n16 CFR, I believe it's Part 601 Appendix C, and in that\ninstance the FTC, again subject to formal notice and\ncomment of rulemaking, said that the statute is defined\nvery broadly and it includes any action that can even be\nconsidered to have a negative impact. And that plays in\nthe subjective aspect as well, but addressing your\nquestion, Justice Breyer, first on the statutory\nlanguage --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's pretty sloppy\nlawyering, don't you think, any action that even be\nconsidered to have -- wow. This is a standard?\nMR. SHORR: That was --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Any action that can even be\nconsidered to have a negative impact.\nMR. SHORR: That was guidance, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: This is guidance?\nMR. SHORR: That was guidance. That was\nguidance to provide in the context of reading this\nstatute, it should be read broadly.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But you know, I would tell\nmy CEO ignore that, that it's meaningless.\nMR. SHORR: In addition, the CEO would have\nthe guidance provided by the Ball letter.\nBut again addressing your question, Justice\nBreyer, an increase based on credit, if we had let's say\nan increase based on race, someone goes in and has a\nproduct to buy and there's the best rate, and they\ncharge someone else based on their race a higher rate,\ncertainly that's an increase based on credit. There's\nonly one best rate.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But this is not an\nantidiscrimination provision. It doesn't say anyone who\ndiscriminates in the setting of race has to send out\nletters. It requires an adverse action. It requires an\nincrease in the charge.\nMR. SHORR: And Your Honor, I was only using\nthat example to try and explain the statutory language.\nJUSTICE BREYER: It doesn't explain it\nbecause if you have an increase in the charge based on\nrace, of course that's an increase based on race.\nMR. SHORR: Well, here we have --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And if you refuse to give a\nperson the best rate, and lower his rate but not the\nbest rate, based on race, that is not an increase based\non race. That is discrimination based on race.\nMR. SHORR: You're charging someone more\nbased on credit.\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's true, and it's a\ndiscrimination, but you didn't increase the rate. You\ndecreased it.\nMR. SHORR: I think --\nJUSTICE BREYER: It's still a\ndiscrimination, it's still unlawful.\nMR. SHORR: Applying it to credit, a natural\ndefinition that is charging someone more than you charge\nothers is an increase.\nJUSTICE ALITO: When you say more, in order\nfor there to be an adverse action there has to be an\nincrease or an unfavorable change. And when you have an\ninitial application you have to figure out what is the\nbaseline in order to determine whether there has been an\nincrease or an adverse action. And you and the\nSolicitor General just assert that the baseline in that\nsituation is the best possible rate that you can get,\nbut I don't understand where that comes from.\nMR. SHORR: Because charging someone more\nthan someone else who qualifies for that better rate\nbased on their credit, is increasing them, charging them\nmore, but it's also evident from the statutory purpose,\nwhich I think was a question you asked --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Let me look at the\nlanguage. Go back to give me -- because in ordinary\nEnglish, which I hope I speak, it is not an increase,\nbut maybe there is a technical term in the technical\nlanguage of commercial law or in FTC law where the word\nincrease means decrease. And if you -- is there\nanything you want -- no. It's a serious question, at\nleast if you want to cite me to some authority that uses\nthis word increase in the way you just suggested.\nMR. SHORR: We believe that it's a standard\ndictionary definition, to charge someone more for\ninsurance than they would otherwise qualify for is\nincreasing their charge.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Which dictionary shall I\nlook at?\nMR. SHORR: I think we can look at any\ndictionary. I don't have a cite, Your Honor, but --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: They're making this\nargument, and I think you got close to it a minute ago\nwhen you alluded to statutory purpose. I think this is\nwhat's behind, and you tell me if I'm wrong. One\npurpose of the statute is to alert a consumer that the\nconsumer's credit report may contain errors which are\ndoing the consumer some kind of damage.\nMR. SHORR: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And you want this consumer\nalerted so the consumer can ask to see the report and\ncorrect it if possible.\nMR. SHORR: That's exactly right.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Reading the adverse action\nthe way you read it, it would give the consumer or\nconsumers a tip-off in the maximum number of cases. In\nevery case in which the consumer might have done better\nif the credit report had assumed different facts, on\nyour reading theoretically, the consumer is going to say\nI want to look at that report and correct it if it's\nwrong. But isn't the fallacy of that argument the\nfallacy of saying because that is one object of the\nstatute, every term within the statute has got to be\nread in a way that maximizes the effectuation of that\nobject? And the trouble that we're having on the bench\nis that discrimination and increase are different terms.\nIncrease says the rate actually goes up from a baseline\nthat the consumer previously had, whereas discrimination\ndoes not. And your reading in effect, increase to mean\ndiscrimination in order to maximize the likelihood that\nthe consumer will look at the report, isn't that the\nbasis of your argument?\nMR. SHORR: I think it has to be an increase\nbased on some aspect, but the only way to give effect to\nthat statutory purpose is an increase above what you\nwould otherwise qualify for had you had better credit\nand of course --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, that's a way to give\nevery conceivable effect to that policy. But the\nstatute in drafting adverse, or drafting the terms of\nadverse action, may very well have said we don't want to\ngive every conceivable effect to this purpose because if\nwe do, we'll get into the situation that Justice Breyer\ndescribed. Everybody will be getting notices and the\nnotices will be meaningless.\nMR. SHORR: I don't think the notice is\nproblematic because you're alerting the consumer to\ncheck that the information that the insurance company\nexpressly relied on to increase your charge --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: To set the charge. I mean,\nthat's circular. To set the charge that it gives you.\nMR. SHORR: I don't think you need a prior\ncharge to suffer an increase. If I walk into a candy\nstore and I've never purchased that candy before but the\nbest price that day is 5 cents but they say we're going\nto charge you 10 cents, I've certainly suffered an\nincrease.\nJUSTICE BREYER: By that you're talking\nlinguistically, but I am interested in the purpose. So\nI looked up on the Internet approximately what percent\nof the people have the best credit score and that's\nabout 1 percent. So 99 percent of the public doesn't\nhave the best possible credit score. Now I take it that\nmeans that you could in fact, if it's even roughly\nright, have 99 percent or a little less or even perhaps\na little more when they look at that report that, since\nit's not perfect in 99 percent of the cases, it's quite\npossible that they won't get the best conceivable rate\nwhich might be reserved for just perfect people. And if\nthat's so, in 99 percent of the cases they'll send out\nnotices. And that's why I asked my question about the\nboy who calls wolf. What will happen if 99 percent of\nthe people who apply for insurance or any other thing\nget notices? I suspect that this is only intuitive,\nthat the notices are more likely to go into the\nwastebasket than they are if there was really a\ndecrease. Now, do you have any light you can shed on\nthat?\nMR. SHORR: Sure. The -- as an initial\nmatter, it's not the perfect credit that is the\nstandard, it's whatever would qualify you for GEICO's\nbest rate. And that's a much broader standard. We\ndon't know the exact amounts but if you look at GEICO JA\n6768, they have fairly broad tiers, maybe five or six.\nAnd of course not everyone is going to get the notice.\nIf your driving record totally eliminates -- if you have\ngreat credit but your driving record eliminates the\npossibility that you qualify for the better rate, you\nwouldn't get notice in that circumstance either. But\nthe key to the notice is, if I have very good credit but\nthe information that the insurance company looks at is\nincorrect, I will be charged more based on incorrect\ninformation without ever having the opportunity to tell\nthe insurance company or whoever is collecting that\ninformation for them, you've charged me the wrong amount\nand I in fact qualify for that better rate.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Don't you have that\nright independently, though, every year to look at a\ncopy of your credit report?\nMR. SHORR: Well, what's significant here,\nthat has been added to the statute in the last two\nyears. But since 1970, Congress's concern is giving\nnotice at a critical time, when the insurance company\ntells you we are relying on it and we may have taken an\nadverse action.\nI wanted to also mention, here it's not just\nan increase. There's also been a denial, and that\nMr. Edo applied for insurance from GEICO, and was denied\ninsurance with the stand-alone company GEICO General, so\nthat is also an adverse action under the act.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: When you say you\nlook at the increase with respect to the best credit\nrate, why is that? Why wouldn't you look at it relative\nto say the average insured who walks in the door?\nMR. SHORR: Because that -- GEICO's\nargument, and I think that's what they want, presumes\nthey're looking at accurate credit information. And the\nproblem is, Congress has always told that there is\nsignificant inadequacy in the credit information. I\nthink it's cited in the National Consumer Law Center\nbrief. In 1996, Congress was told that the error rate\nin consumer information was 50 percent and there was a\n20 percent serious error in the rates. Under GEICO's\ninterpretation --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I don't understand\nwhat pertinence that has to my question which is, why do\nyou get to pick the best credit report as the baseline\nfrom which you would measure your hypothetical increase?\nMR. SHORR: Because under GEICO's theory of\nthe statute you may never get notice, even though you're\nbeing charged more for insurance based on inaccurate\ninformation, as long as you're not charge -- your charge\ndoesn't move below average. So a lot of people who are\nin fact intended to be protected under this act will not\nbe protected until their charge goes below average, even\nthough the insurance company is continuing to charge\nthem more based on inaccurate information.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Why do we -- how do we know\nthat they were intended to be protected in this way by\ngetting this notice? That's the issue in the case.\nMR. SHORR: Because going through the\nstatute and the increase based on credit, and then the\nnotice will give them the opportunity to check. Since\nthe consumer here is the -- it's a system of checks and\nbalances, and unless you give this consumer the\nopportunity to check that they are in fact using the\ncorrect information, it wasn't mistaken, it wasn't\ndriven down by identity theft, you can continue to\ncharge people more --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. So that's --\nMR. SHORR: -- based on inaccurate\ninformation.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Your basic argument is the\nstatute, the definitions of adverse action have got to\nbe read in a way that maximizes the occasion upon which\na consumer will get a notice that may lead that consumer\nto ask to see his credit report. That's your basic\npremise?\nMR. SHORR: Both based on the premise and\npurpose of statute, yes.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: All right.\nMR. SHORR: Briefly addressing the\napplication of the standard to the facts in this case,\nwe do think it's appropriate to remand for further\nconsideration in light of some new developments. GEICO\nhas just recently produced documents to us that\naddressly -- directly address the question of scienter\nhere, so if there's -- if you go past a minimum\nthreshold --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I've read your reference\nto those documents. Explain why you think that's so\nimportant.\nMR. SHORR: Because those documents directly\naddress the subject of standard here, that GEICO was\nreckless or understood their --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: How do those documents\nshed any light on recklessness? I didn't see that.\nMR. SHORR: I'm sorry, Your Honor?\nJUSTICE STEVENS: How do the documents that\nyou describe shed any light on the extent of their\nrecklessness, if any?\nMR. SHORR: I want to be careful, because I\nhad presented -- I asked to lodge them with the Court\nand I can quote them if necessary, but within those\ndocuments there is direct evidence that GEICO\ninterpreted the statute exactly how we do, that not\nputting someone in the best tier based on credit --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Who's GEICO? I\nmean, you're talking about particular lawyers at a\nparticular level, an ongoing debate about what this law\nmeans. If you get one lawyer who says, you know, I\nthink you could read it this way, does that mean that\nGEICO reads it that way?\nMR. SHORR: No, Your Honor. In this\ninstance, this document involves top level GEICO\nexecutives. And with respect to the advice of counsel\nissue, frankly it's a red herring. We have never asked\nto compel the Defendants in either of these cases or any\nof the cases we're involved in, to waive their\nprivilege. They've got the right, of course, to offer\nadvice of counsel as an affirmative -- as a defense in\nthis case, but we don't believe it's necessary to prove\nour case to even reach what the counsel said. We\nbelieve we can prove our case based on the documents and\nsubjective intent alone.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I still don't really\nunderstand this part of the case very much. Assume that\na lawyer writes a letter saying you read it two or three\ndifferent ways, read the statute, it's very ambiguous,\nand we think the government's reading is the better\nreading. And the executives think about it and they say\nno, we don't think that's right. Has that proved\nreckless disregard?\nMR. SHORR: If the statute was clear and the\nguidance --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: If the statute's clear.\nAnd of course, Miss Mahoney said the district judge\nthought it was clear, but the other way.\nMR. SHORR: And with respect to the district\ncourt, we believe the district court here clearly erred,\nas the Ninth Circuit found. And the guidance -- that\nopinion certainly didn't precede the conduct that's at\nissue here. The only guidance, again, available at the\ntime supported our reading of the statute. There was no\nguidance from and court or from the FTC, or from\nanywhere that would have supported Defendants'\ninterpretation at that time. So that's another aspect\nof inquiry, the subjective intent of the Defendants.\nIf there are no other questions?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMs. Mahoney, you have four minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MAUREEN E. MAHONEY\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMS. MAHONEY: If I could start by just\nresponding to the issue of the new document, I just want\nto emphasize that this document was created by people\nwho weren't lawyers. It was done before GEICO even\nstarted using credit to price insurance. They were --\nsaid they were brainstorming about what the statute\nmight mean. And I would point the Court to the\nsupplemental excerpt of records at 504 where when GEICO\nimplemented the policy that we're talking about here,\nthe -- they said that the intent was that we would send\nto the people who were supposed to get the adverse\naction notice. With the early systems development we\ndidn't have the ability to identify whether they were\nsupposed to receive the notice or not; that was because\nthey had not yet developed the way to do with what they\ncall the neutral, where they compare how the applicant\nwould have done if they hadn't taken credit, hadn't\ntaken credit into account at all. And this is a\nprocedure that's required actually in most States in\norder to ensure that those who don't want to allow\naccess to credit reports or who don't have a sufficient\ncredit history are not treated adversely in the meaning\nof those State laws, and that means worse than the\naverage loss ratio. So there's nothing in this record,\neven if you take into account the documents they're\ntalking about, to suggest that there was somehow a\nknowing or deliberate intent to try to violate the law.\nWith respect to a few of the factual or --\nissues that came up, Safeco estimates that approximately\n80 percent of all consumers that they are selling new\ninsurance to now have to get notice under the standards\nestablished by the Ninth Circuit.\nWith respect to who can qualify for the top\ntier of credit, it's only, at least at GEICO,\napproximately 10 percent. So 90 percent of the\nconsumers would not qualify for that.\nAnd the statute very plainly does not\nprohibit differential treatment based on persons with\nbetter credit, nor do State laws. And so the analogy as\nto race discrimination simply don't hold water, because\nthere Congress has told you what the baseline is, you\ncan't treat any person of a different race in a\ndifferent way, and that's not true under this statute.\nAnd instead, it's quite reasonable, as GEICO has\nconcluded, to simply say look, if we wouldn't -- if\nwe're treating you worse than we would have treated you\nif we ever looked at your credit report, worse than if\nyou had an average loss ratio for this criteria, we'll\nsend you the notice.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Why did they use credit\nreports? Is it just a hedge against late premiums and\nthe cost of late premiums, or does it bear on risk\nfactors generally?\nMS. MAHONEY: Well, generally there are\nabout 15 factors that they look at to try to come up\nwith a prediction of loss ratio, and someone who has a\ngood credit history is generally regarded as\nresponsible, and responsible people tend to make less\nclaims. And so, again, it's just one factor of 15\nthough.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yeah. May I ask this\nquestion? The reading of the statute in subsection i\nabout, in the charges for insurance advice, seems to\nfavor your view. But subsection ii about denial of\nemployment really seems to read in favor of the\ngovernment's reading.\nMS. MAHONEY: Well actually, I think that\nwhen you factor in employment, it has -- it has the\nopposite effect. Because what happens here is if you're\nusing employment verification reports, consumer reports\nabout employment, there are all kinds of consumer\nreports. How do you tell who had the optimal employment\nhistory? How could the baseline be the best employment\nhistory possible?\nJUSTICE STEVENS: No. But my point is, it\nseems to me that getting a lesser salary, it just seems\nlike the first applicant would be an adverse employment\naction under subparagraph ii, just -- do you see what\nI'm trying to say?\nMS. MAHONEY: That if you -- that in other\nwords, if you gave someone a lower salary --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: It adversely affects any\ncurrent or prospective employee. Now the language in i\nisn't, it doesn't read that way. But the thing that's\ntroubling me is whether you should interpret i in the\nlight of what ii seems to say.\nMS. MAHONEY: Your Honor, I think that if\nGEICO in this example, if you actually pay them less\nbecause you looked at their credit report, then GEICO\nwould concede that that is in fact an adverse action.\nSo I don't think it's inconsistent at all.\nThank you, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\n"
