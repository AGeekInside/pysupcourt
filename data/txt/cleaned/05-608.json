KESTER\nON BEHALF OF PETITIONER\nMR. KESTER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nAs of this morning, it is exactly 70 years ago\nto the day, minus 4 months, that this Court heard argument\nchallenging the new Federal Declaratory Judgment Act of\n1934, in an action to construe an insurance contract.\nAnd exactly 25 years -- 25 days later, in a\nunanimous opinion written by Chief Justice Hughes, joined\nby Justices Stone, Brandeis, and others, the Act was held\nfully consistent with Article III of the Constitution.\nThis morning, you are here because an action was\nbrought for a declaratory judgment that a biomedical\nmanufacturer need not play -- pay large sums, under a\nlicense as patent royalties, under a patent it contends is\ninvalid, unenforceable, and not infringed, but is paying\nroyalties under protest in the meantime. That complaint\nwas ordered dismissed by the Federal Circuit as outside\nthe Article III judicial power of the United States.\nIn detail, the Petitioner, MedImmune, is a\nbiotech company, formed in 1988. During the 1990s --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Kester, would it --\nMR. KESTER: Yes?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- would it -- would\nyour position be different if the contract contained a\nspecific -- the license -- a specific provision specifying\nthat the licensee may not sue?\nMR. KESTER: No, it would not, Your Honor,\nbecause --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You -- do you think such\na provision would be enforceable?\nMR. KESTER: I doubt it would be enforceable.\nIt would be a matter -- under the Lear case, Lear against\nAdkins, it would be an -- it would be an affirmative\ndefense if such -- if such a claim were raised. This case\nis here at the level of subject-matter jurisdiction.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me, I don't -- I don't\nunderstand what you just said. You mean, it would be\nenforceable; that if such a suit were brought, the\nlicensor could raise that contractual provision as a basis\nfor dismissing the suit. Is that --\nMR. KESTER: Under 12- -- under 12(b)(6) --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Okay.\nMR. KESTER: -- perhaps.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So, then it is enforceable.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, but --\nMR. KESTER: No.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- your point is, it's not\njurisdictional.\nMR. KESTER: It's not jurisdictional, exactly,\nJustice Souter. This is a jurisdictional ruling. And\nthat's all that this Court granted certiorari on.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but as a matter of\npolicy, we, at some point, either in this case or some\nlater case, may have to address the question of whether or\nnot such a provision is enforceable. If it is, we may be\n-- not be talking about much. It's just going to be\nboilerplate in every license agreement, and that's the end\nof it. And it --\nMR. KESTER: And so --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- but it -- on the other\nhand, it may be that there are reasons not to enforce\nthis, so that we don't have courts flooded with lawsuits,\net cetera, et cetera.\nMR. KESTER: And those reasons, I would suggest,\nJustice Kennedy, were taken care of in Lear, for the most\npart, in 1969. Provisions in license contracts that\nprevent challenges to the contracts are not enforceable\nunder the patent laws of the United States. But then, I\n-- as I was saying, that is a matter of patent law.\nThat's not a matter of jurisdictional law. We're here --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, let's look at what\nmight be a matter of jurisdictional law. I take it, from\nyour position, there's nothing preventing Genentech from\nsuing, either, is there? In other words, to establish the\nvalidity of their patent.\nMR. KESTER: It has -- it has happened, on\nvarious occasions, that patentees have brought suit to\nestablish the validity of --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Against licensees?\nMR. KESTER: Against licensees and others. And\nthe --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Against licensees who are not\nclaiming that the patent is invalid? And where is the\ncontroversy?\nMR. KESTER: The controversy could arise in any\nnumber of ways.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I mean, I can see, if the --\nif licensee says the patent is invalid, that the patentee\nsays paying its royalties -- how does it --\nMR. KESTER: The patentee could be paying his\nroyalties. The patentee could also be putting ads in the\npaper saying, \"This is not a valid patent.\" It could --\nit could have acquired a lot of publicity. And, in the\nend, there could be reasons, and there have been such\ncases -- which we cited, 47 of, our brief -- where such\nsuits have been brought. But --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: If it -- if the -- if the --\nif the licensee came into court and said, \"I'm not\ncontesting this patent,\" that would be the end of it,\nwouldn't it?\nMR. KESTER: If the licensee said, \"I am not\ncontesting that patent,\" that could be.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Oh, but the patentee\nwould just say, \"Look, we have a license. I think the\npatent's valid, and you owe me a dollar a unit.\" The\nlicensee said, \"Well, I don't think they're -- it's valid,\nso I owe you nothing.\" And they settle on a license for\n50 cents. Why can't the patentee say, \"You know, if I get\na judicial decision establishing that the patent is valid,\nI can charge a higher license, either when this agreement\nexpires or for other licenses\"?\nMR. KESTER: That -- I agree with that, Mr.\nChief Justice. But the practicality is that a patentee\nstarts out with, essentially, a judgment that the patent\nis valid. There is a presumption of validity. And to\nchallenge that patent -- that presumption of validity, is\na very difficult undertaking. Most of them don't bother.\nWhy would they? If they are receiving -- if they're\nreceiving --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm trying to see how\nfar you want -- are willing to push your argument that\njust because there's been an agreement, or perhaps even a\nsettlement, that that somehow or another doesn't moot the\ncontroversy, the underlying legal dispute. And it -- I\ngather your answer to me is that Genentech, or a patentee,\ncan sue, even though they have an existing -- they're\ngetting royalties from the licensee, they can still sue\nthe licensee.\nMR. KESTER: A settlement does not deprive a\nFederal Court of subject-matter jurisdiction. That's the\nnarrow point that is before this -- before this Court.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Why aren't you -- you said,\n\"The only question before the court is jurisdictional.\"\nIf that's so, why isn't your position that the Federal\nCircuit put the wrong label on this, that license is\nlisted in 8(c) as an affirmative defense; so, whatever the\noutcome should be, the wrong label should -- is -- was\nused. It shouldn't be a subject-matter jurisdiction,\nshouldn't be 12(b)(1); it should be an 8(c) affirmative\ndefense. And then the -- you're out of the jurisdiction\nbox, but you're left with the same underlying question.\nMR. KESTER: But not the same underlying\nquestion, Justice Ginsburg, with respect, because then you\nare in a situation like the business forms case in the\nSeventh Circuit, which came out shortly after the Lear.\nThere was a settle -- settlement, and the -- and it was\nargued that the settlement was not effective because of\nthe Lear decision, and parties can't settle themselves out\nof the Lear decision. But that is all under 12(b)(6), and\nnot 12(b)(1). This case involves a 12(b)(1) motion, not a\n12(b)(6) --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But what --\nMR. KESTER: -- motion.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- good would it do? Suppose\nwe said, \"Federal Circuit, you put the wrong label on it.\nIt should be 12(b)(6), not 12(b)(1), or perhaps even 8(c),\naffirmative defense\"? Then you go back to the Federal\nCircuit, and they'll come up with the same decision, that,\nas long as you are licensed and are paying your royalties,\nyou have -- and they just put a different label on it --\nyou have --\nMR. KESTER: They --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- you have no -- you have\nnot stated a claim.\nMR. KESTER: That would be effectively\noverruling Lear, which is what, I think, is what many of\nthe parties in this case actually seek to do.\nLear does not allow inhibitions of challenges to\npatent licenses. A licensee can challenge the validity,\nthe enforceability of the patent. That's because there's\na public interest in this, as well. Parties cannot simply\ncontract with each other and prevent a challenge to a --\nto a patent --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But then --\nMR. KESTER: -- license.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- the Federal Circuit\ndistinguished Lear, and said what -- in Lear, the licensee\nhad stopped paying royalties. Isn't that so?\nMR. KESTER: That -- those were the facts of\nLear. But -- it happened that way in Lear, but that\nwasn't the reasoning of Lear. Lear would not totally\ncover that situation, but we would submit to this Court,\nit shouldn't make any difference. The reasoning of Lear\nis the same. The licensee cannot, by contract, be\nestopped, licensee estoppel, from challenging a patent.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, there's no way, I --\nunder your view, that a patent holder can protect itself\nfrom suit through any license arrangement or any agreement\nof any kind.\nMR. KESTER: I suspect there are many ways, Mr.\nChief Justice, but not by throwing them out on a\njurisdictional basis at the very first moment of the\nlawsuit.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: How about --\nMR. KESTER: There may be ways this could be\narranged at the second level, through --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, what are those ways --\nI mean, the ones that have been mentioned as possibilities\nin the Government brief -- one, you rejected, and the\nother that was mentioned was: if you sue -- if the\nlicensee sues, then the royalty fees will be upped. Would\nthat be effective?\nMR. KESTER: That is a question that would arise\nunder Lear against Adkins. And the question before this\nCourt in that situation, if it got to this Court, would\nbe, Is that kind of a provision compatible with the policy\nthat was so firmly expressed by Justice Harlan in Lear,\nand has been reiterated in so many subsequent cases of\nthis Court?\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So, you have rejected both of\nthe Government's suggestions on what the patent holder\nmight do to protect itself. Do you have anything concrete\nthat you would concede the patent holder could do?\nMR. KESTER: I don't think that I have rejected\nboth the Government's suggestions. I've said that they\nraise problems on -- as to the scope of Lear.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: With respect to -- whether we\nare talking about a jurisdictional defense or whether we\nare talking about an affirmative defense, assuming\njurisdiction, is there any -- is there any reason for us\nto accept your position, other than the reason that you\nhave mentioned a number of times, and that is the adoption\nand encouragement of a public policy that allows patent\nchallenges freely? Is that the nub of our reasoning, if\nwe were to support your position, either jurisdictionally,\nin this case, or in recognizing -- or the -- in dealing\nwith the affirmative defense in another case?\nMR. KESTER: Not quite, Justice Souter. I would\nsay the nub of your position is the Altvater case, the\nAetna case, the Maryland --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, Altvater is difficult for\nyou, isn't it? Because there was an injunction in\nAltvater, wasn't there?\nMR. KESTER: That -- but that -- but was --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Which raises an entirely\ndifferent policy issue?\nMR. KESTER: Well, I would say what it -- what\nit raises is simply an extra fact, but it wasn't a\nnecessary fact. Because this Court, in Altvater,\nspecifically pointed out that even if there weren't an\ninjunction there, there would be -- there would be the\ndanger forced on the licensee, of an infringement suit;\nand an infringement suit means, possibly, an injunction of\nthe patent, treble damages, any number of sanctions. An\ninjunction suit can put a company out of business,\nespecially like a company like my client here. And --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But that is -- that is a good\nreason. And, I take it, it's your logic that that is a\ngood reason to recognize a fairly broad right on the part\nof the licensee to challenge.\nMR. KESTER: Right.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: In other words, the nub of your\nposition, as I understand it, is the public policy that\nfavors relative --\nMR. KESTER: It --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- freedom to challenge --\nMR. KESTER: It's more -- it's more than public\npolicy, it's Article III. Article III says that you can\nbring a lawsuit in this situation. And that was settled --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No --\nMR. KESTER: -- in Aetna.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, I realize that. But, I\nmean, what we've got in this case, and in any of these\ncases, is a question of line-drawing under Article III.\nAnd your argument is, you want to draw the line where you\nwant it drawn primarily because there are practical\nreasons to favor a public policy of free challenge.\nMR. KESTER: What we are presenting in this case\nis a dispute about money. It's not abstract. It's not\nhypothetical. It's not conjectural. It is concrete,\nimmediate. All the facts are in. It's definitely\nadversarial. It's legal.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You -- well, you can have such\na dispute on a theoretical question between, I don't know,\nthe ACLU and the National Rifle Association, but that\ndoesn't create a case or controversy. What is the injury,\nthe imminent injury to your -- to your client that is the\nbasis for the case or controversy?\nMR. KESTER: The --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Is it anything other than, \"I\nhave to pay the royalties that I agreed to pay.\"?\nMR. KESTER: It is the -- it is that, \"I am\nhaving to pay the royalties -- that I say I did not agree\nto pay, because this is an invalid patent.\" Money is\nbeing paid by my client every quarter, large amounts of\nmoney. That is a major injury.\nJCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, if you don't --\nMR. KESTER: And if --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- think --\nMR. KESTER: And if --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- if you don't think --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Is it -- is it unlawful to\nagree to pay somebody money who does not have a patent?\nMR. KESTER: It is --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, you're speaking as\nthough somehow that -- such a contract is contrary to\npublic policy, and void.\nMR. KESTER: No, we're saying that that isn't\nwhat we agreed to. We're saying this is a contract\ndispute. And the whole purpose of the --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, then why are you\npaying it, if you -- if you don't think you owe it?\nMR. KESTER: Because the --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Because of the threat of\ntreble damages --\nMR. KESTER: The threat --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- and injunction.\nMR. KESTER: -- of this --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If we're trying to\nfigure out where the public policy is here, why don't we\ngive some weight to those congressional enactments that\nobviously fortify the strength of the patent? In other\nwords, Congress passed these provisions providing for\ntreble damages for attorneys' fees. And --\nMR. KESTER: But --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- and to respond that\nthere's got to be a public policy to counterbalance that,\nCongress can always do that, if it wants; but it didn't --\nit thinks that you need these provisions to protect the\npatent holders.\nMR. KESTER: But, Mr. Chief Justice,\nCongress can also amend the Declaratory Judgment Act, if\nit wants. And Congress was proud of the Declaratory\nJudgment Act when it was passed in 1934. And the\nlegislative history of it -- and nothing in the text is\ncontrary, says the purpose of this is so that contracts\ncan be resolved without breach, and judicial\ndeterminations can be had. It's like a noninvasive, a\nless invasive kind of surgery.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Kester, may I ask you this\nquestion? Is it your view that Gen-Probe represented a\nchange in the law?\nMR. KESTER: Absolutely.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Were there -- before Gen-Probe\nwas decided, were there any cases, like this case, that\nwere decided?\nMR. KESTER: There were many, Your Honor, and\nthey were decided --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Where the -- where the\nlicensee brought suit challenging validity while the\nlicense was still in full --\nMR. KESTER: We --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- force?\nMR. KESTER: We had suits in the Third Circuit,\nthe Seventh Circuit, the Second Circuit, and even in the\nFederal Circuit, in its early days, where it quoted those\ncases which said, \"It is not necessary for the licensee to\nstop paying payments in order for Article III to be\nsatisfied.\"\nThis case came as a shock in 2004. And, in\nfact, the judges below, in this series of cases, all said,\n\"We thought it was settled law the other way.\" All this\ncase represents, from our point of view, is, \"Let's go\nback to the way it has always been.\"\nI'd like to reserve the balance of my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Kester.\nMs. Maynard.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF DEANNE E. MAYNARD\nON BEHALF OF PETITIONER\nMS. MAYNARD: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThere is a concrete dispute between the parties\nabout their legal rights and obligations. If that dispute\nis resolved, money will change hands. That is an Article\nIII case or controversy.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How do you ever end\nthese things? Let's say they have this dispute, they\nbring the litigation, and they settle it. They're saying,\n\"Okay, we're going to settle it. Instead of paying a\nlicense fee of 50 cents, it's going to be 40 cents, and\nwe'll go on.\" Then they can sue again, I take it.\nMS. MAYNARD:: In that situation. Recognizing\nthat's not the situation we have here --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Can they settle that, by\nthe way? Is it all right to settle it, or is -- that\ninterfere with the policy that patents have to be open to\nchallenge?\nMS. MAYNARD: May I -- if I can answer the first\nquestion first.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Either one.\nMS. MAYNARD: If there were to be a settlement,\nin the second case, the -- it would not be an Article III\ncase or controversy problem with the second case. And\nthat suit should not be dismissed under 12(b)(1).\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay.\nMS. MAYNARD: The -- in that case, the patent\nholder might have a valid 12(b)(6) defense, and the suit,\nlaying aside enforceability issues that you raised, may be\neasily resolved, on that ground. But, in terms of the\nquestion before the Court today, that wouldn't be an\nArticle III matter.\nI think, as a policy matter -- so, moving off\nthe question before the Court right now -- as a policy\nmatter, the -- it's not clear from this Court's cases\nexactly what types of agreements would be enforceable. I\nthink there's a spectrum of cases one can imagine, ranging\nfrom Pope -- the type of promise that was extracted in\nPope, which this Court held was unenforceable --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I think you\noverread Pope. All Pope said was that they're not going\nto grant specific performance. In fact, they've said,\n\"Whatever you may think of the policy here, we don't --\nspecific performance calls on the equitable discretion,\nand we're not going to do it.\" But, I don't read Pope as\nholding that the clauses are otherwise unenforceable. In\n--\nMS. MAYNARD: Well --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- other words you're\nmaybe entitled to damages. And that may be measured by\nthe license fee that you agreed to pay.\nMS. MAYNARD: Well, there certainly would be a\nquestion, though, the way that Lear read Pope, and under\nLear, about whether a bare agreement not to challenge\nlicenses, especially ones like in Pope, where they agreed\nnot to challenge the license, even beyond the term, would\nbe enforceable. And the Government thinks there's a\nspectrum. One -- at one end of the spectrum would be\nlicenses like those in Pope, and at the other end of the\nspectrum would be a consent decree entered after\nsettlement of a bona fide patent infringement suit where\nthe -- which included an agreement not to settle. Now,\nthat's clearly not what we have here.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Now, is -- if -- I guess there\nare three possible positions on the question of whether a\nlicensee can attack a contract, a patent where he has a\nlicense and wants to keep the contract. One, he can never\ndo it. Two, he can always do it. Three, it depends on\nwhat the contract says. Now, do any of those questions\nhave anything to do with the question before us, which is\nwhether it is a case or controversy?\nMS. MAYNARD: No, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. If we were to reach\nthe question, which is very interesting, \"What is the\nGovernment's position as to which of those three positions\nis the right position?\" -- were we to reach it -- I agree\nwith you, I don't see it in front of us; but maybe it is\n-- if it were, what would be your view?\nMS. MAYNARD: The Government's view is that\nthere's a spectrum along the spectrum, and it would have\n-- you would have to consider each case on its terms. And\nit's not clear, from this Court's cases, where the\npolicies in that --\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. So, basically,\nthough, you're not certain. The Government's view would\nbe, it is a matter as to whether you can sue claiming the\npatent is invalid, whether the licensee can do it, that\nprobably -- but you're not certain, and you haven't made\nup your mind definitely, because it is not in this case --\nbut you think it's going to be something they could\nregulate themselves by contract.\nMS. MAYNARD: It's certainly not foreclosed by\nthis Court's precedent, and it's an open question where\nthe policies -- how they would weigh out. There's no\nlanguage in this license, however, suggesting any type of\nsettlement. And, moreover, I think it's important to\nrecognize that the parties here actually have a concrete\ndispute about what the licensing agreement means. Count\none in the complaint is asking for a declaration --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, you don't think\nthat matters, though, do you? I mean, even if they all\nagree there's no dispute about what the license agreement\nmeans, your position is still the same, right? There is\nan Article III controversy because they challenge the\nvalidity of the patent?\nMS. MAYNARD: If the parties have a concrete\ndispute about the validity of the patent, and it would\naffect their rights and obligations in the way that it\nwould here -- in other words, that money will no longer be\ndue to the Respondents if the patent's invalid --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is --\nMS. MAYNARD: -- and the --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- that always the case?\nI mean, could -- can you enforce a license agreement based\non an invalid patent? You thought it was valid -- parties\nhad a dispute about it -- whether it is valid. You\nentered into agreement, say, \"Well, let's split the\ndifference. We'll -- you know, 50 cents rather than a\ndollar or nothing.\" It's determined that the patent is\ninvalid. Can the patentee then still say, \"Well, you\nstill owe me the money. We've, kind of, cut -- split the\ndifference. That was part of the agreement\"?\nMS. MAYNARD: It might depend on whether there\nwas consideration beyond the patent itself. In the -- in\nthis -- in this case, though, the Petitioner claims that\nif the -- if the patent is invalid, they no longer owe\nlicensing fees, and, under Lear, they would be entitled to\nthe licensing fees, that they've paid since they began\nchallenging, back. So, it's clear that under either the\ncontract or a question of --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Contractually? They say that\nthat's their contractual right?\nMS. MAYNARD: They claim that, under the\nlicensing agreement, they only owe royalties on valid\nclaims. That's count one of the complaint, in the (j) --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Where does that appear in the\nlicensing agreement? Or --\nMS. MAYNARD: Where does it appear in the\nlicensing agreement?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, I took them as just\nasserting a general proposition of law -- that, where\nthey've agreed to pay royalties because of a patent, if\nthe patent is invalid, they don't have to pay royalties --\nnot because there's some special provision in this\ncontract.\nMS. MAYNARD: The parties actually have a\nconcrete dispute about the meaning of the licensing\nagreement in that regard, Justice Scalia. On page 399 of\nthe joint appendix is the provision about which they have\na dispute. And the language in there provides that they\nwill pay on substances which would, if not licensed under\nthis agreement, infringe one or more claims of either or\nboth of the Shamir patents, or coexpression patents, which\nhave neither expired nor been held invalid by a court or\nother body of competent jurisdiction. There was similar\nlanguage in --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So, there's really not much at\nissue in this case. And that's clearly a case of\ncontroversy, isn't it? There is a dispute over the\nmeaning of that provision of the agreement.\nMS. MAYNARD: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Gee, there's less here than\nmeets the eye.\nMS. MAYNARD: That's what the Government\nbelieves, Your Honor.\nIt's also -- the licensee also does not need to\nbreach the licensing agreement in order to create a case\nor controversy. The licensee is currently paying\nroyalties that it does not believe it owes and that it\nbelieves it would be entitled to have back if it should\nprevail on its interpretation of the -- of the patent and\nthe licensing agreement. It doesn't have to make that\ninjury more severe by breaching. That's clear from this\nCourt's decision in Altvater. In Altvater, royalties were\nbeing demanded and royalties were being paid, but,\nnevertheless, this Court held --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but that -- it's\nbeen pointed out that was pursuant to an injunction.\nMS. MAYNARD: Yes, it was pursuant to\ninjunction, but that was not important to the Court's\nreasoning. What the Court said is, \"You need not suffer\npatent damages in order to bring the suit.\" Not a\ncontempt. \"You need not breach the injunction and put\nyourself at risk of treble damages for infringement.\" It\nwas the patent damages that put the licensee at risk, and\nthat's the same risk that the Petitioner faces here and\nshould not have to bear in order to bring suit.\nThe case or controversy is whether or not the --\nthey owe the royalties. The whole point of the\nDeclaratory Judgment Act was to allow contracting parties\nnot to have to sever their ongoing contractual relations\nin order to get disputes resolved between --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you think --\nMS. MAYNARD: -- themselves.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you think there would\nbe a case or controversy if Genentech were suing to\nestablish the validity of its patent?\nMS. MAYNARD: In the situation that we have\nhere, Your Honor?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes.\nMS. MAYNARD: Yes, I do. Where the Petitioner\nclaims that the patent is invalid, that they could -- that\nthe Petitioner's claims unsettles their right, damages\ntheir property value, potentially, and that they could\nbring a declaratory judgment action of validity.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And what would their -- what\nwould their concrete injury be? What is the threatened\nimminent injury that they would assert in that -- in that\naction?\nMS. MAYNARD: Well, right now --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You have a licensee who's\npaying the license fees. What is their concrete injury?\nMS. MAYNARD: It -- from the moment -- the\nPetitioner has an argument that from the moment it ceased\n-- it starts claiming that the patent is invalid and pays\nunder protest, that it is entitled to those royalties\nback.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But --\nMS. MAYNARD: The --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- so long as they're still\npaying the royalties, isn't that sort of an abstract\ndisagreement? I mean, it's sort of like the ACLU saying\nthat the patent's invalid. You know, it's a nice\ntheoretical question that we can argue about, but as long\nas they're paying the royalties, where's the concrete\ninjury?\nMS. MAYNARD: Well, I think, technically,\nJustice Scalia, they probably have a claim for patent\ninfringement, to which the defense, as Justice Ginsburg --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I --\nMS. MAYNARD: -- points out --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I find it --\nMS. MAYNARD: -- would be an easy defense.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I --\nMS. MAYNARD: So, there's not an Article III\nlack of case or controversy, which is --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I find it --\nMS. MAYNARD: -- what's the question before --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- very difficult --\nMS. MAYNARD: -- the Court.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- to see how there would be a\nproper declaratory judgment action brought by the patentee\nhere. It's just not the kind of a situation where you can\nhave a mirror-image suit. I don't see what the --\nMS. MAYNARD: Well, you need --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- patentee --\nMS. MAYNARD: You -- may I answer that question?\nYou need not have a mirror-image suit, in that sense,\nJustice Scalia. And Altvater makes that clear. In\nAltvater, the patentee's claim was --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's fine.\nMS. MAYNARD: -- much narrower than the\ncounterclaim; and, nevertheless, the Court allowed that\ncounterclaim to proceed.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel.\nMs. Mahoney.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MAUREEN E. MAHONEY\nON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT\nMS. MAHONEY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nI'd like to start with the fact that there are\nfour counts in the complaint for declaratory relief. The\nfirst one is styled as a -- contractual relations claims.\nThe other three are styled as patent law claims. And it's\nimportant to emphasize, at the outset, that this Court, in\nSkelly Oil, in Calderone, and in, really, all of the\ncases, has said it's very important to look behind the\nlabels that a Declaratory Judgment Act plaintiff puts on\ntheir claims. We need to actually see what is the cause\nof action they're trying to adjudicate so we can do an\naccurate assessment of justiciability -- standing,\nripeness, Federal-question jurisdiction.\nI want to start by explaining why there is no\ncontract claim at issue here. You heard today, they're\ntrying to salvage this, say that there's a contract\ndispute, a dispute about the terms of the contract. They\ndidn't argue that below, and with good reason. And I'd\njust point you to the briefs in the Federal Circuit.\nRoman numeral I, which is all about the improper dismissal\nof the Declaratory Judgment Act claims, refers to the fact\nthese are, quote, \"patent-law claims,\" end quote, at page\n27. Nowhere do they say that there is a dispute about the\nproper interpretation of the contract terms. And let me\nexplain why.\nThe contract terms, which were just read to you,\nis Section 110 of -- 1.10 at JA-399 of the license -- says\nthat there is an obligation to pay royalties for Synagis\non any claim -- not any valid claim, any claim -- that has\nnot been held invalid by a court or other competent\njurisdiction from which no appeal has, or may, be taken.\nNow, they never said, below, \"That clause means that we\ncan come to court and have the court decide whether this\npatent is valid, and, depending on whether we win or not,\nthen we can stop paying.\" And the reason they didn't make\nthat argument is, it was rejected by this Court a hundred\nyears ago, in United States versus Harvey Steel. Very\nsimilar clause. The United States says, \"This means that\nwe don't have to pay if the patent is invalid.\" And, in\nan opinion by Justice Holmes, this Court rejected it out\nof hand by -- and said, \"This was a conventional proviso.\nWe don't even need to look to evidence of the party's\nintent, because this is the standard proviso. It does not\nmean\" -- and they said it was a \"twisted interpretation\"\nthat the Government was offering -- it doesn't mean that\nthe licensee, quote, \"thought the patent bad and would\nlike to have the Court say so now,\" end quote. Yet that\nis exactly --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Was that a case about Article\nIII case or controversy?\nMS. MAHONEY: It is, in the following sense,\nYour Honor. They can't just show up here today and say,\n\"Well, there really is a dispute about the contract.\" But\nthey never argued, below, and is foreclosed --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Shouldn't we send that back? I\nmean, I thought we were here to decide one question, that\nthe Federal Circuit has said that, \"Unless there is a\nreasonable apprehension of a lawsuit, you can't bring a\ndeclaratory judgment action, because of the Constitution\nof the United States.\" Now, I have to admit, I've looked\nup, or I've had my law clerk look up, probably now\nhundreds of cases, and we can't find, in any case, such a\nrequirement. Indeed, the very purpose -- as I -- we've\njust heard the SG say, of this act, the Declaratory\nJudgment Act, seems to be to allow people who -- a\ncontract -- who are in a real concrete disagreement, to\nget a declaratory judgment without getting rid of the\ncontract. But I might be wrong about that.\nBut you've now argued a different point.\nMS. MAHONEY: Well --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So, isn't the right thing for\nus to do, to decide the issue in front of us and then send\nit back? If you're right that they have to pay, whether\nthey win or lose; if they're right that they promise not\nto sue; if you're right on 14 other grounds, you might\nwin. But should we decide those grounds today? Why?\nMS. MAHONEY: Well, first of all, with respect\nto this issue, whether there would be jurisdiction over a\nreal live contract dispute, they never argued it, Your\nHonor. It's not part of this case. The Federal Circuit\ndidn't address it, because they didn't argue it, because\nit's foreclosed by --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But the question --\nMS. MAHONEY: -- a precedent a hundred --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The question that is\npresented to us -- whatever they suggested at this oral\nargument that wasn't in III, the question it presented to\nus is, Was the Federal Circuit right when they said, \"You\nhave no access to a declaratory judgment unless there is a\nreasonable apprehension that you will be sued\"?\nMS. MAHONEY: Your Honor, that is the right --\nthat is the right starting point for a test, depending on\nthe cause of action they're seeking to adjudicate. In\nhere, what the Federal Circuit properly understood is that\nthey are seeking to adjudicate affirmative defenses to an\ninfringement action under the patent laws.\nAnd, just like in Steffel, if you're trying to\nadjudicate, on an anticipatory basis, an enforcement\naction, you have to show that you would reasonably fear\nthat enforcement action. And, in fact, Steffel uses that\nlanguage, and Poe versus Ullman dismisses a case for\nfailure to establish a genuine fear of prosecution. But\nthen, you have to go one step beyond, and that is to say,\nAre they -- is the cause of action not ripening because\nthe declaratory judgment plaintiff is forfeiting their\nlegal rights in order to avoid some very severe harm that\nwould be cognizable coercion? That's the test that's used\nin Steffel for -- in essence, being able to test a --\ndefenses to a cause of action that --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And why --\nMS. MAHONEY: -- an enforcement action.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- doesn't that work here?\nMS. MAHONEY: It doesn't work here, for several\nreasons. Most fundamentally, this is a settlement. I\nmean, Mr. Steffel did not enter into a settlement or a\ncompromise with the prosecutor. He wasn't complying\nbecause he was under an agreement to do so. Here, it has\nbeen settled for -- forever, that if a -- an agreement --\nif you're making payments pursuant to an agreement, in the\nnature of a compromise, you can't come and say that it's\nbeen coerced or it's a form of duress.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What is the --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Why should we accept the\ncharacterization that it's a compromise? As I -- and\nmaybe I'm just factually wrong here? I thought, at the\ntime they entered into the license agreement, they had\nsome disagreements about the scope of the then-patent, the\nscope of the anticipated patent, and so on, and they\ncouldn't very well be resolved. But they were -- they\nwere not settling, in the -- in the classic sense of the\nword, a -- let us say, a focus claim, one against the\nother.\nMS. MAHONEY: I think the answer, Your Honor,\nis, they weren't settling, for all time, in the sense that\nthey could never get out of the deal. Certainly, they\ncould repudiate and then go ahead and sue. But yet, at\npage 3 of their petition, they expressly say, the reason\nthey entered into this agreement was in order to avoid the\ncosts and risks of litigation. It is the reason --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But had they gotten to the\npoint, prior to the execution of the contract, in which\none party was saying, \"You may not do this,\" and the other\nparty was saying, \"Oh, yes I can,\" so that there -- there\nwas a focus controversy that would have been the subject\nmatter of a conventional lawsuit, then and there, had\nthere not been this license agreement?\nMS. MAHONEY: Not exactly, but what they did was\nthey headed it off at the pass. They understood that --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But the question is, How far\nahead of the pass can they get and still call it a\nsettlement?\" in the sense that you're using that term.\nMS. MAHONEY: It's a compromise. It's a\ncompromise of the very claims they're trying to adjudicate\nhere. What they want to adjudicate are affirmative\ndefenses to a patent infringement action. That is not a\nripe claim, and there is not sufficient immediacy, because\nthey are preventing that claim from ripening by continuing\nto make voluntary payments --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But --\nMS. MAHONEY: -- under their --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But you --\nMS. MAHONEY: -- agreement.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Right. But you were saying\nthat the status of that agreement, for purposes of the\njurisdictional question here, is exactly the same as the\nstatus of an agreement that they might have entered into\nafter one party had brought suit against the other. And\n--\nMS. MAHONEY: Well --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And they -- they had settled.\nAnd then, later on, somebody wanted to repudiate the\nsettlement.\nMS. MAHONEY: I don't know if it's exactly the\nstatus. For instance, in a settlement after litigation\nhas been filed, I think that Lear would say that you can't\neven repudiate that. But certainly -- so, there might be\nsome differences -- but from --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: In any event --\nMS. MAHONEY: -- the standpoint of coercion --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- it's equivalent to a\nsettlement after a formal demand has been made.\nMS. MAHONEY: It is equivalent to that, in the\nfollowing sense. They understood that if they -- if they\ndidn't get a license, that they would be exposed to\nGenentech's claims under the -- under the infringement\nlaws. And in order to avoid that exposure, even though\nthey had all the information they needed to assess the\nvalidity of this patent at the time --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose they didn't have all\nthe information. Suppose you enter into a license\nagreement -- you're convinced, as the one that's going to\npay the license fee, that it's a good patent -- after the\nagreement's signed, the technological advances, other\ndisclosures, indicate that the patent is deficient. Could\nyou sue then?\nMS. MAHONEY: No, I don't think so, unless --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but then -- so then, the\nargument that you've made is just not --\nMS. MAHONEY: No, I --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- relevant for us, the fact\nthat they knew everything --\nMS. MAHONEY: They did.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And it also means that this\nisn't really a settlement, in any respect.\nMS. MAHONEY: It's a compromise of claims that\ncould be brought.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Ms. Mahoney, can I ask this\nquestion? Supposing at the time they negotiate the\nlicense agreement there's some uncertainty about whether\nthe patent is valid or not. So, at the end of the license\nagreement -- they agree on the royalties, the term, and\nthe -- everything it covers, but they put in a provision\nand say, \"We're not entirely sure the patent is valid, so\nwe reserve the right to bring an action challenging the\nvalidity of the patent. We will pay royalties in the\nmeantime, and the -- you will accept these royalties as\nsufficient for the use of the patent, that, if we win, you\ndon't have to pay royals, if we lose, you do.\" Would that\nbe a valid provision?\nMS. MAHONEY: I don't think so, but that would\ncertainly be a closer case if there --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But would it --\nMS. MAHONEY: But I --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- not be precisely the same\nissue as a jurisdictional matter as to whether there's a\ncase or controversy?\nMS. MAHONEY: No, I don't think so, because the\nreal issue, in terms of Steffel, is whether you can say\nthat the party is being coerced. And, at least in your\nhypothetical, you could say that they have --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: He's not being coerced, but\nhe's bargaining a little better royalty rate than he'll --\notherwise would have to pay.\nMS. MAHONEY: Well, in terms of whether they're\n-- if the parties expressly agreed that that was part of\ntheir deal, then you at least wouldn't say that there was\nan issue of coercion. But here, that isn't what happened.\nInstead, they used --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: No, I'm really asking --\nMS. MAHONEY: -- a standard proviso --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- whether the parties could\nagree to create a case or controversy.\nMS. MAHONEY: I think probably not, Your Honor.\nI think --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Let's suppose --\nMS. MAHONEY: -- that that's one of the --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well --\nMS. MAHONEY: -- one of the problems --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Will you assume Justice\nStevens' hypothetical? Assume it, take it as given. They\ndid put that in. I know you think they didn't, but I want\nto assume it.\nMS. MAHONEY: Uh-huh.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Now, I'd like to also assume --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Could I have a review of the\nbidding? What --\n[Laughter.]\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Go back -- what is the\nhypothetical --\nJUSTICE BREYER: The hypothetical is --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Continue on.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- that they write into the\ncontract -- the party who's the licensee says, \"And we\nstipulate that the licensee thinks that the patent is\ninvalid.\" Nonetheless, the licensee wants a license, for\nbusiness reasons. Therefore, the licensee and the\nlicensor agrees that, after they sign the contract and\nhe's paying a thousand dollars a month in royalties, he\ncan go into court and challenge the patent.\" So, we\nassume that's written into the contract.\nMS. MAHONEY: Uh-huh.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And now, let us also assume a\nstate of the law. The state of the law is that there is\nno public policy or any other policy that forbids such a\ncondition in a contract. All right?\nNow, on those two assumptions, the next thing\nthat happens is that the licensee asks for a declaratory\njudgment that the patent is invalid.\nOn those assumptions, is there a case or\ncontroversy under the Federal Constitution? If not, why\nnot?\nMS. MAHONEY: I don't think so, because I think\nwhat they're really asking for is advice about a business\ndeal under those circumstances.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But he says, by the way, \"If I\nwin, I will, in fact, save $42 billion a year in licenses\"\n--\nMS. MAHONEY: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- \"I would other have to pay.\"\nAnd the other side will -- or -- I was a thousand dollars,\nI meant 42 billion, okay?\n[Laughter.]\nMS. MAHONEY: But -- you know, but now -- but\nnow, can they come even before they sign the deal? In\nother words, what's --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No. Now, that's --\nMS. MAHONEY: -- the line?\nJUSTICE BREYER: I'm not asking --\nMS. MAHONEY: In other words --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- your hypothetical.\nMS. MAHONEY: -- I -- no. Oh, no, I'm just\nsaying --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I'm asking --\nMS. MAHONEY: -- I think that --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- my hypothetical.\n[Laughter.]\nMS. MAHONEY: I think the problem -- I think the\nproblem is, it -- is, it leads notion that parties can\nsimply, sort of, set up a -- even if there's not true\nadversity, and come to court for answers to legal\nquestions. And that has --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, isn't there --\nMS. MAHONEY: -- is something --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- true adversity? I\nthought the assumption underlying the -- everybody's\nhypothetical is that, if the patent is determined to be\ninvalid, that the license -- then the license agreement is\nalso invalid. Is that -- is that right?\nMS. MAHONEY: I don't think so. I don't think\nthe license agreement itself is invalid. It simply --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Can you -- can you --\nMS. MAHONEY: -- means --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- can you collect --\ncan a patentee collect license fees based on an -- patent\nthat has been determined to be invalid?\nMS. MAHONEY: Not on that patent. Right. The\nlicense --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It would --\nMS. MAHONEY: -- made.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It would be pursuant to\nthe agreement.\nMS. MAHONEY: If the patent has been -- under\nLear and other cases, if a patent has been held to be\ninvalid by a final decision of a court, then I think it is\nimproper for a licensee to seek to obtain --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Collective --\nMS. MAHONEY: -- royalties --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Even if --\nMS. MAHONEY: -- for that.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- the royalty agreement\nsays, you know, \"We have a dispute about the validity of\nthis patent. We don't know. We disagree. And so, we've\nentered into a compromise royalty rate that reflects the\nuncertainty.\" But once it's determined to be invalid, the\nlicense fees are not collectible.\nMS. MAHONEY: I think that that is correct, Your\nHonor, under the -- under the current state of the law.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: One further -- on further\nwrinkle. What if the contract goes the further step and\nsays, \"Even if the patent were determined, in any action,\nto be invalid, there will still be a royalty payable,\nbecause that's what -- that's -- that is consideration for\nthe fact that we are not going to start any controversy\nnow.\" Let's assume they assume, precisely, the\ninvalidity. Would you say the contract is unenforceable\nthen, and the -- and the --\nMS. MAHONEY: Well --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- and, for jurisdictional\npurposes, there would be no case or controversy then?\nMS. MAHONEY: That if, under the -- I'm sorry,\nto --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: The --\nMS. MAHONEY: The --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Take the Chief Justice's\nhypothetical, add the following. There is a provision in\nthere to the effect that if, during the term of this\ncontract, the license is determined to be invalid,\nroyalties will still be payable under this contract --\nMS. MAHONEY: Uh-huh.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- because that is one of the\ncontingencies, which is a consideration for our bargain.\nWould you say, in those circumstances, that your answer\nwould be the same, that there's no -- there's no case or\n--\nMS. MAHONEY: Well, I don't know what the\ndispute would be about, Your Honor, because it sounds like\nthe contract terms would be clear. And if the contract\nterms are clear, they would simply go in accordance,\nunless they have an argument that the contract is --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, but I'm talking about\njurisdictional purposes.\nMS. MAHONEY: -- unenforceable. If the -- if\nthe point is that it is actually invalid, illegal, that --\nthat may be a different case, although I think there would\nstill be an estoppel argument, that they should not be\npermitted to bring that action without giving up the\nbenefits of the bargain, which is the immunity from suit.\nI mean, that is one of the fundamental problems with this\ncase.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But do you see --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I thought your argument\n-- I'm sorry.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, if -- do you see a\ndifference between -- I guess you're saying there's no\ndifference between my added wrinkle on the hypo and the\nChief Justice's hypo, for jurisdictional purposes.\nMS. MAHONEY: I don't think that there's a\ndifference, from a jurisdictional perspective --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.\nMS. MAHONEY: -- but I think, here, that the\nmajor problem, from a jurisdictional perspective, is that\nthere is not anything in the language of the contract that\ngives them a right to come to court to dispute validity.\nInstead, we're --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What about the fact that\nit's under protest?\nMS. MAHONEY: That makes no difference, Your\nHonor. The fact is that they are making the payments\npursuant to an agreement. They're not under compulsion of\nan injunction. They're doing it because they voluntarily\nentered into it. Altvater is completely different.\nThere, there was no license agreement in force. The\ncourts found that it -- that the reissue patents were\nnever part of the agreement, to begin with. In other\nwords, Altvater never agreed to pay royalties. Altvater\nhad been sued, so there wasn't a counterclaim for\ninvalidity.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Could the --\nMS. MAHONEY: And --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- patent holder take the\nposition that, \"I -- Sooner or later, I'm going to have to\nfight out validity with someone, and might as well do it\nsooner rather than later, so I am not going to raise the\nlicense as a defense\"? Would that be a \"case or\ncontroversy\"?\nMS. MAHONEY: I don't think that the patent\nholder is allowed to come to court and seek a declaration\nof validity. I don't think any court has ever allowed\nthat.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Is it -- it's -- no, the\npatent -- the licensee is coming into court and wants a\ndeclaration of invalidity so it can manufacture without\nthe fear of an infringement suit.\nMS. MAHONEY: And they're under a license?\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes.\nMS. MAHONEY: Yes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And the patent holder chooses\nnot to plead the license -- chooses not to plead the\nlicense. Wouldn't the patent holder have that option?\nMS. MAHONEY: Yes, the patent -- well, no. I\nmean, not necessarily. Their view is that, because of the\nterms of the agreement, that the patent holder has no\nchoice but to -- because they're receiving the royalties,\nto simply --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I don't mean their view. I\nmean, they start a lawsuit. They say, \"We're -- we want\"\n--\nMS. MAHONEY: But that is -- that's what\nhappened here.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- \"we want a declaration of\ninfringement.\" And the patent holder doesn't take the\nposition that you're taking; instead says, \"I'm prepared\nto fight this out now. I know that I have the license,\nwhich could be an affirmative defense, but I'm not going\nto raise it. I'm going to go head to head on the validity\nof this patent.\" Would that be a case or controversy?\nMS. MAHONEY: I don't think so, Your Honor,\nbecause I don't think the parties are allowed to just\ndecide, \"Well, we'd like to do this now,\" when they're --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So, even --\nMS. MAHONEY: -- they've treated --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- even if the patent holder\nchooses not to raise the license, the court would have to,\non its own motion, say, \"Sorry, you didn't -- you're not\nthe master of your defense. We decide that you have to\neffectively plead the license.\"\nMS. MAHONEY: I think the plaintiff has to show\nthat they are here pursuant to -- that they have a legal\nright that permits them to adjudicate the issue of\nvalidity. What the -- what the patent owner does, or not,\nI don't think turns this into a case or controversy; that,\ninstead, we have to start with the fundamental question,\n\"What is the cause of action that they are attempting to\nadjudicate? Is it a contract action or is it a -- an\naction under the patent laws? Is it an infringement\naction?\" Here, I don't think there's any question but\nthat it is -- they're trying to adjudicate an action for\nan infringement that can't arise, because they're immune\nfrom suit, because they continue to make their payments.\nAnd, under those circumstances, it is not sufficiently\nimmediate to establish jurisdiction in --\nJUSTICE BREYER: It is --\nMS. MAHONEY: -- this Court.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- it is, under other fields of\nthe law, isn't it? I mean, I imagine that the very -- we\nsee, all the time, declaratory judgments where a State\npasses a law and the individual says, \"Well, I think this\nis unconstitutional, but my preferences are not to go to\njail; my preferences are not to be penalized. So, my\nfirst choice is unconstitutional and my second is to obey\nit.\" There's no possibility in the world that he will\nviolate that law. And yet, we've often held that, with\nregulations, you have to have the other requirements. You\nhave to have the requirements that it's concrete, it's not\njust ideological, there's real harm. But, if those other\nrequirements that are fulfilled, I've never seen any where\nit said that there also has to be a reasonable\napprehension of a lawsuit in the absence of the\ndeclaratory judgment. I've just never found that phrase,\nand I can't imagine why it would be part of the law.\nMS. MAHONEY: Your Honor, Poe versus Ullman,\nthis Court actually dismissed a declaratory judgment --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Oh, there are many dismissed,\nfor the reasons that they aren't concrete, definite --\nthere are a lot of reasons why to dismiss it. I'm just\nwondering if there is an additional reason that there has\nto be a reasonable apprehension of a lawsuit in the\nabsence of the declaratory judgment action. It's that\nphrase that I've never found anywhere --\nMS. MAHONEY: We --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- and can't think of any\nreason why that would be an additional constitutional\nrequirement. And I'm putting that directly to you,\nbecause I want to hear you give me the counterexamples.\nMS. MAHONEY: Well -- but in Poe versus Ullman,\nit was a declaratory judgment action. They were seeking\nto have a statute declared unconstitutional. And this\nCourt did dismiss, because they didn't have a reasonable\nfear that they would actually be prosecuted. Dismissed\nfor lack of jurisdiction.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And you say there has never\nbeen a declaratory judgment action, except in the instance\nwhere, in the absence of the action, the person would have\nviolated the law, if it's a Government law. In other\nwords, if they're -- so, it's really not --\nMS. MAHONEY: Even --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes.\nMS. MAHONEY: Well, you could -- you could --\nI'm not -- it is possible that that framework could be\nextended. I -- it has not been done to date, and it would\nbe --\nJUSTICE BREYER: As I think as we --\nMS. MAHONEY: But --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- both know --\nMS. MAHONEY: But --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- in the Government area, it\nhappens --\nMS. MAHONEY: It --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- a lot.\nMS. MAHONEY: It does.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes.\nMS. MAHONEY: But there is always a reasonable\napprehension, and there was always a finding of coercion.\nPoe versus Ullman says you can't do it unless there is --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Do I remember that --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, Poe versus Ullman was a\ncase in which, even if there was a violation of the law,\nthere was going to be no prosecution.\nMS. MAHONEY: That's why they didn't --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: He -- but, in this -- in this\ncase, if there's a failure to -- of -- conform to the\nterms of the license agreement, there's going to be a\nlawsuit. So, I think Poe versus Ullman is just not\nrelevant.\nMS. MAHONEY: That -- it goes to the next point,\nwhich is that there still has to be a coercive choice.\nYou have to choose -- there, they're choosing to give up\nconstitutional rights in order to avoid jail and\nimprisonment, arrest and prosecution. Here --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: No, but --\nMS. MAHONEY: -- what's at issue --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- but, in Poe versus Ullman,\nthe ultimate action was basically like violating the\ncontract here, and that's why it's not an applicable\nprecedent.\nMS. MAHONEY: I don't -- I don't think it's like\nviolating the contract here, though, Your Honor, because,\nWhat are the consequences here? What is the choice?\nFirst of all, they actually owe the royalties under the\nagreement, so they're trying to escape their bargain, not\nenforce it. That's number one. So, they're not\nforfeiting any rights under the contract, they're simply\ntrying to get out of the contract.\nNumber two, the consequences here, the choice\nthey're talking about, isn't in the nature of coercion.\nAgain, they're not being arrested or prosecuted. All\nthey're going to do if they walk out of this agreement, if\nthey stop paying royalties -- yes, they may well be sued\nfor infringement -- but, if they do, all they face is the\nloss of their discount.\nJUSTICE ALITO: But your argument seems --\nMS. MAHONEY: That's --\nJUSTICE ALITO: -- to be based on their having\nimplicitly given up their right to sue. Isn't that right?\nThat was your main argument. This is a settlement. This\nis in the nature of the settlement. As part of the\nbargain, the patent holder promises not to sue for\ninfringement.\nMS. MAHONEY: It's not based on them giving up\ntheir right to sue, in the sense that all they have to do\nis stop paying royalties, and they can sue. They have to\n--\nJUSTICE ALITO: But in answer to the\nhypotheticals, you seem to say it wouldn't matter if they\nexplicitly did not give up their right to sue. So, what\nis left of this argument that what's involved here is\nessentially a settlement?\nMS. MAHONEY: Well, it is in the nature of a\ncompromise, Your Honor, and there's nothing in this\nagreement that gives them a right to sue. They have to\nfind some legal right. What they're really saying -- what\ntheir argument has always been is that Lear actually\ncreates an implied right of action for a licensee to sue\nat any time of their choosing. That's been their argument\nfrom the beginning.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, their concrete\nright is, as I thought you conceded earlier, that if the\npatent is declared invalid, they will not owe license\nfees.\nMS. MAHONEY: That's true. But that's getting\nthe cart before the horse. What this Court said in --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's what --\nMS. MAHONEY: -- U.S. v. Harvey Steel is --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- a declaratory\njudgment action does, though, isn't it?\nMS. MAHONEY: Well, I don't think so, Your\nHonor. I think every single contract case in the lower\ncourts where they have allowed a suit to be brought on a\ncontract prior to breach, there was a genuine dispute\nabout the interpretation of the terms. Here, what they're\ntrying to do is adjudicate a cause of action outside of\nthe contract. They're trying to adjudicate an\ninfringement action and then say, \"Aha, see what I have?\nI have a judgment that the patent's invalid. And so, now\nI'd like to say that I don't have to pay royalties under\nmy contract.\"\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Ms. Mahoney, the patent bar is\nsort of specialized -- more than \"sort of\" -- it's a\nspecialized bar, and I've never -- I've never been a part\nof it. Do you agree with the statement of the\nPetitioner's counsel that Gen-Probe came as a -- as a\nshock to the --\nMS. MAHONEY: As a -- I do not agree that it\ncame as a shock. And, in fact, I think that Warner\nJenkinson, which is a Second Circuit case that allowed\nthis kind of action back in the '70s, was one of the only\ncases ever that allowed it. And other reasons were found\nto dismiss similar kinds of claims. In Gen-Probe, it was\na surprise that a licensee could do this. It -- the law\n-- by the time that this license was executed in the\nFederal Circuit, there was a case, called Shell Oil, where\nthe Court specifically held that a licensee cannot take\nadvantage of the protections of Lear until it has\nrepudiated the license, stopped paying, and said that it\nwants to challenge validity. So that was the background\nrule that was in force at the time of this license. And\nthen, when you couple that with the fact that --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But that wasn't -- the\nDistrict Court, in this very case, seemed to say, \"I think\nthis suit should go forward, but there's Gen-Probe, and I\nmust follow Gen-Probe.\" The District Court, at least as I\nread it, seemed to think that Gen-Probe moved in a\ndifferent direction from where the Federal Circuit was\nbefore.\nMS. MAHONEY: In all of the prior Federal\nCircuit cases, the licensee had stopped paying royalties.\nAnd what the Court explained in Gen-Probe is that that is\nthe sine qua non, that a licensee can't establish\njurisdiction, and it can't establish a right to challenge\nvalidity, if it's still paying royalties.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Ms. Mahoney, you argue,\nin the alternative, that we should dismiss it on the basis\nof equitable considerations under the Declaratory Judgment\nAct. We can't reach that argument unless we rule against\nyou on the Article III question. Is that right?\nMS. MAHONEY: I don't think so, Your Honor. I\nthink you can, because I think that you can do it as an\nalternative threshold prudential jurisdictional dismissal\nin the nature --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We would have to be\nassuming that we had jurisdiction, wouldn't we?\nMS. MAHONEY: I think that --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Under Article III?\nMS. MAHONEY: I think that a prudential\ndismissal under Article III would also be fine, and that\nSteel Co. would allow for that kind of dismissal, because\nWilton said that you can dismiss for lack of jurisdiction,\nat the front end, on prudential grounds if you know that\nthere would not be relief allowed at the back end.\nAnd I think that there's no need for a remand to\ndo this. We are really talking about an equitable rule\nthat has governed equitable actions for 300 years. It is\na --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But what -- but jurisdiction\nis a question of power, Does the Court have the power to\ndo this? A discretion question is different. It's, \"We\nhave the power to entertain this case, but, as a matter of\nequity, we're not going to do so.\" The power question, I\nthink, is a -- one that's -- it's either yes or no, either\nthe court has the power, or doesn't.\nMS. MAHONEY: But I don't think that the Court\nhas to answer that question in order to dismiss on a\nprudential ground, a prudential jurisdictional ground, and\nnor is there a need for a remand in Samuels versus\nMackell, and in Cardinal, for instance. Those are cases\nwhere the Court adopted prudential rules and went ahead\nand applied them without remand. I -- and no remand's\nnecessary. The Federal Circuit has already looked at\nthis. They --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Ms. Mahoney, can I ask you one\nquestion before your light goes off? I know it's not --\ngoes to the \"case or controversy\" issue, but, in your\nview, was the bringing of this action a material breach of\nan implied condition of the contract that would justify a\ntermination of a license?\nMS. MAHONEY: It would depend on whether there\nis an implied covenant, Your Honor. It wasn't --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I'm asking you whether --\nMS. MAHONEY: -- argued below.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- you think there was.\nMS. MAHONEY: I think it -- it may well be, but\nI don't think the answer in this case turns on it, because\nI think they have to have their own right to bring the\naction, whether it's a breach or not, and that they don't.\nBecause they don't have an implied right of action under\nLear, they don't have a right to bring this action. And\nthat is an essential component of their ability to\nchallenge the issue of validity. So, I think that's the\nfirst and fundamental --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, if that's so, and it's a\nsuper-violation of an implied covenant, and I guess you\ncould get damages.\nMS. MAHONEY: I think that their theory, Your\nHonor, is that a licensee can do this at any time, and\nthat --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But I think that your theory\nis that it's a super-violation of an implied covenant.\nMS. MAHONEY: Your Honor, I don't think --\nwhether it's an implied covenant or not --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: \"Not only did we agree to it,\nbut we you can't even do it if you agree to it.\"\nMS. MAHONEY: I think that an additional factor\nthat bears on this analysis is also the fact that Congress\nhas never created an implied right of -- has never created\na right of action --\nThank you, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Ms. Mahoney.\nMr. Kester, you have 3 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN G. KESTER\nON BEHALF OF PETITIONER\nMR. KESTER: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Just\nseveral quick items.\nI think -- I think, Mr. Chief Justice, you were,\na while ago, putting the horse in front of the cart, which\nwas right where it belongs. The contract claim is clear\nin the record. It's at page 136 of the joint appendix. I\ndon't think more needs to be said about it.\nHarvey Steel, on which Respondents rely, was, of\ncourse, overruled --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Wait, wait. Before you leave\nthat, do you agree that it was not raised below?\nMR. KESTER: No, we don't.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Where -- can you tell us where\nit was raised below?\nMR. KESTER: Well, it -- it's raised in the --\nin the first remanded complaint. It's been a -- it's been\nhere throughout. If it -- if it even matters. I mean, we\nwouldn't concede that that -- that that would even matter.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But was it raised before\nthe Federal Circuit?\nMR. KESTER: Yes. The whole record was -- you\nmean was it argued --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes.\nMR. KESTER: I believe it was. I'd have to go\nback and -- you mean in terms of the oral argument. It\nwas certainly in the briefs. It was certainly not waived.\nThere was never, of course, any -- anything in\nthe license, or anyplace else, where Petitioner gave up\nthe right to sue. Petitioner doesn't need permission in\nthe license to sue.\nAnd as for the shock in the lower courts when\nthis case was decided, I would call to your attention what\nthe Federal Circuit, in 1983, itself, said, and it quoted\nthe Warner-Jenkinson case, which was the Second Circuit\ncase that my friend dismissed somewhat. The C.R. Bard\ncase -- this is Federal Circuit, early -- starts out, the\nopening line -- it says, and I quote -- this is 716 F.2d\n875 -- \"We hold that a patent license need not be\nterminated before a patent licensee may bring a Federal\ndeclaratory judgment action,\" close quote. And the last\nwords of the same opinion, at 882 of 716 F.2d, are, \"We\nhold that a patent licensee may bring a Federal\ndeclaratory judgment action to declare the Federal -- to\ndeclare the patent subject to the license invalid without\nprior termination of the -- of the license.\" That was\n1983. Gen-Probe was 2004. Something happened in the\ninterval.\nFinally, the discussion of settlements here\nstrikes me as, indeed, strange, because if this -- if a\nlicense were to be redesignated as a settlement, we would\nhave the situation here where -- a license was signed in\n1977; the only patent at issue in this case was not even\nissued until 2001.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Kester.\nMR. KESTER: Thank you, Mr. --\n"
