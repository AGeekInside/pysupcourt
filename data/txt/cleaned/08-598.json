MIZER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThree separate lines of double jeopardy\nanalysis lead independently to the conclusion that the\nDouble Jeopardy Clause commits the Ohio postconviction\ncourt to hold a hearing to determine whether Mr. Bies is\nmentally retarded for purposes of Atkins.\nFirst, there has been no acquittal in this\ncase. Second, there is no successive jeopardy; and,\nthird, even if collateral estoppel analysis applies\nunder Ashe versus Swenson, the Atkins issue has not\nactually and necessarily been decided. Each of these\nfactors shows that the Ohio court's decision to go\nforward with the Atkins hearing was reasonable, and this\nCourt therefore should, consistent with AEDPA, give the\nOhio courts their first chance to adjudicate Mr. Bies's\nAtkins claim.\nMuch of the dispute in this case centers on\nthe parties' disagreement over the meaning of Ashe\nversus Swenson and its application. But Mr. Bies cannot\nbenefit from Ashe because Ashe -- the Ashe collateral\nestoppel rule only operates to benefit defendants who\nhave in hand an earlier acquittal, and Mr. Bies has\nnever been acquitted of the death penalty in any sense\nof the word.\nThis Court, beginning in Bullington and\nextending through Sattazahn, has defined an \"acquittal\"\nin a death penalty context as a finding by the sentencer\nthat the death -- that the sentence of death is\nwarranted in a particular case. And the -- the jury and\nthe trial judge in this case agreed that death was\nwarranted, and, in fact, the Ohio Supreme Court and\nevery reviewing court has agreed that death was\nwarranted.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But they all agreed that\nhe was mentally retarded, and that was a mitigator.\nThey all agreed to that. But assuming you're right on\nissue preclusion, what more -- the State says, yes, we\nrecognize \"mental retardation\" means you can't\nadminister the death penalty. But what would the State\nshow at an Atkins hearing that is not already in the\nrecord of this case? I mean why do it again?\nMR. MIZER: The reason to do it again, Your\nHonor, is because the -- the standard set forth by the\nOhio Supreme Court in Lott when it was implementing this\nCourt's decision in Atkins contained three definitions\n-- three elements of the Atkins definition, of the\ndefinition of \"mental retardation.\" And those three\nelements were not carefully demonstrated by Dr. Winter.\nAnd, in fact, the -- the record here -- the Ohio\npost-conviction court has concluded -- doesn't suffice\nto make the post-Atkins Lott determination.\nThe -- at pages 101a to 104a of the Petition\nAppendix, the State postconviction court looks at all\nthe evidence, including Dr. Winter's testimony, and says\nthat there needs to be a hearing where experts will be\ncalled in order to determine whether Mr. Bies not only\nsuffers from significant intellectual limitations, which\nincludes IQ, but there is conflicting IQ evidence in the\nrecord. It also includes findings that he suffers from\nsubstantial limitations in adaptive skills, the skills\nneeded for daily life, which Dr. Winter never\nspecifically spoke about. She spoke only about IQ when\nshe was talking about mental retardation.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I don't want to take you\ntoo far outside the record, and you can come back to it,\nbut I -- I just have this question. Suppose that in a\njury case the jury -- pre-Atkins, the jury says, we find\nthat the defendant has a 65 IQ, but that in light of the\nheinous nature of the offense, this is not a mitigating\nfactor, and that he should be sentenced to death.\nIn a subsequent Atkins proceeding, can the\njury finding with reference to the IQ be conclusive?\nMR. MIZER: No, it cannot.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Or must that be reopened?\nMR. MIZER: It can, Your Honor, for two\nreasons.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: It can -- can be reopened?\nMR. MIZER: It can be. Yes, I'm sorry. It\ncan't be preclusive. It can be reopened for two\nreasons, one relating to the definition of \"mental\nretardation\" post-Atkins and the other relating to the\ndifferent issues.\nFirst, with respect to the definition, the\nOhio Supreme Court has made clear in Lott that IQ is not\nenough to determine mental retardation. In fact, the --\nthe clinicians and the American Association of Mental\nRetardation say that IQ is not enough, particularly in a\nborderline case where IQ is close to the line. And\nthere you need to look very carefully at adaptive\nskills. Moreover --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But could the -- could the\ndefendant argue the -- that -- the accused argue that at\nleast as to the finding of the 65 IQ, that that is a\ngiven.\nMR. MIZER: And --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And that that issue, i.e.,\nthe level of IQ, cannot be relitigated, the number?\nMR. MIZER: And the answer to that is no,\nYour Honor, for issue preclusive purposes, because the\nissue is completely different in the mitigation context\nfrom the post-Atkins context. And I think that\ndifference is highlighted by the difference between\nPenry and Atkins. Pre-Atkins what the sentencer was\ntalking about, the jury and then the Ohio Supreme Court\nwhen it affirmed, was what this Court told it to talk\nabout in Penry.\nIt was talking about mental retardation as a\nmitigating factor, and the State of Ohio and the Ohio\ncourts had to know the definition of \"mental\nretardation\" pre-Atkins. In fact, I think if there had\nbeen a definition and if the courts had excluded\nevidence from the jury that didn't rise to a certain\nlevel of severity, then we would have run into a -- a\npost -- a Penry and Tennard problem. And so all of the\nevidence was allowed in, and it was treated as\nmitigating.\nAnd so what the Ohio Supreme Court was doing\nwas what Penry told it to do: Considering mitigating\nevidence of mental retardation. But post-Atkins the\ninquiries are different, because Atkins effectively\nconstitutionalized a clinical judgment in making -- in\ndefining a categorical bar on executing the mentally\nretarded.\nAnd so post-Atkins it is necessary to be\nvery careful about the clinical judgment, and this\nrecord does not suffice for that clinical judgment. And\nI think it -- think it does not behoove either party to\nsuggest that the record --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, when you say \"the\nclinical judgment,\" you mean the specific finding of a\n65 IQ?\nMR. MIZER: The -- the clinical judgment\nthat I refer to, Your Honor, is that required by -- by\nLott. It looks not only at IQ, but also at the adaptive\nskills limitation.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. I grant you that\nunder -- under the earlier case the 65 IQ was not\ndispositive, and I mean that was the -- the case in\nJustice Kennedy's hypothetical. But it was necessary\nunder the early case to come to a determination of what\nthe IQ was, even though that determination was not\ndispositive of the result. And because it was necessary\nto come to a determination, why shouldn't there be a\npreclusion?\nMR. MIZER: Because, Your Honor, I think\nthere are two different meanings of \"necessary.\" It was\n-- it was necessary in the sense that it had to be done,\nbut it wasn't necessary in the issue preclusive offense\nbecause it -- it was --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: It wasn't necessary to\nreach that particular -- in other words, the\ndetermination of 65 was not necessary to reach the\nconclusion that they reached.\nMR. MIZER: Correct.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And you -- you are saying\nthe very fact that it was not dispositive of the result\nmeans that it cannot be preclusive now?\nMR. MIZER: That's correct, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.\nMR. MIZER: And -- and --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: May I ask how it worked\npre-Atkins when mental retardation was a mitigator? We\nare told that the appellate courts independently\nreviewed. We have a finding at the trial level that,\nyes, there is a mitigator mental retardation, but it\ndoesn't overcome the aggravator, so the jury comes in\nwith a death sentence.\nThen at the appellate level, is there a\ncontinuing adversary contest about whether retardation\nexists and, therefore, is a mitigator, or is it just the\n-- the judge, the appellate judge, looking over the\nrecord that has been made at trial?\nMR. MIZER: The -- the appellate courts\nengaged in a de novo record and new -- new evidence\ndoesn't come into the record on direct review. But\nthere is still argument -- the parties are still in an\nadversarial posture.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So -- so that the\nprosecutor could still argue that was unreasonable for\nthem to find mental retardation, so there shouldn't be\nthat mitigator?\nMR. MIZER: That's correct, Your Honor, but\nthere wasn't at the time a -- a great deal of incentive\nto litigate that question because the Ohio Supreme Court\nhad said that mental retardation only merited some\nweight in mitigation. And, in fact, the -- the\nappellate briefs on direct review are in the Joint\nAppendix and -- excerpts of those briefs. And Mr. Bies\nhimself on direct review didn't vigorously argue his\nmental retardation evidence. In fact, he said that the,\n\"arguably,\" in his words, \"the most persuasive\nmitigating evidence\" was his lack of a prior record and\nhis lack of prior violent history.\nAnd so none of the parties thought that\nmental retardation in 1992 through 1996 was very\npersuasive, because the courts didn't treat it and the\njury didn't treat it as very persuasive, Perhaps for the\nreasons that this Court underscored in Atkins, where the\nCourt said that, as it had said in Penry, that mental\nretardation evidence presented to a jury in mitigation\ncould be a two-edged sword, because some jurors might\nperceive and the prosecutor might argue that that\nevidence went to future dangerousness, and therefore the\n-- the State of Ohio argued that the mental retardation\nevidence here was simply not persuasive and it was\noutweighed by the -- the aggravating factors that the\njury had found. Atkins told the --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I interrupt right\nthere, Mr. Mizer? Is it fair to interpret the jury's\ndecision to impose the death penalty as having found\nthat he was not mentally retarded and therefore was not\na mitigating factor, or that even though he was -- a\nmitigating factor, the aggravating factors outweighed\nthat factor?\nMR. MIZER: I think, Your Honor, that it's\nfairest and the record that's easiest to go by is what\nthe Ohio Supreme Court said, because the jury didn't\nmake any specific remarks about mental retardation as a\nmitigator; the Ohio Supreme Court did.\nBut the -- the jury's verdict and then the\nOhio Supreme Court's affirmance should best be read as a\ndetermination that the aggravating factors outweigh the\nmitigating factors beyond a reasonable doubt, and that\nmental retardation was one of those mitigating factors.\nBut it should not be read as a mini-verdict on the\nexistence of or the question of whether Mr. Bies is\nmentally retarded. Because --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: If they didn't make a\nfinding on mental retardation, how -- how could the\nappellate court determine that it was a mitigator but\noverwhelmed by the aggravating -- what did the judge\ncharge the jury about mitigators and aggravators?\nMR. MIZER: The judge charged the jury that\n-- first of all, Your Honor, the mitigating evidence\nintroduced by Mr. Bies was not extensive. He -- he\nintroduced an unsworn statement by himself and then Dr.\nWinter testified, and that was the extent of the case in\nmitigation. So the jury was charged with the various\nstatutory mitigating factors in Ohio, which is found in\nOhio Revised Code 2929.04.\nThe mental retardation evidence was relevant\nunder two of those mitigating statutory factors, one,\nfactor 3, which went to mental disease or defect, and\nthen the catch-all, factor 7. But the -- but I think\nPoland helps to illuminate what the -- not only what the\njury was doing, but also what the Ohio Supreme Court was\ndoing when it --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: First go back to the\njury. How do we know that the jury found mental\nretardation as a mitigator?\nMR. MIZER: We don't, Your Honor. All that\nwe know is that the jury determined that the aggravating\nfactors outweighed the mitigators beyond a reasonable\ndoubt. What we do know and what the Sixth Circuit hung\nits hat on was the statement by the Ohio Supreme Court\non direct review that Mr. Bies's mental retardation\nmerits weight in mitigation.\nPoland explains that that -- that statement\nby the Ohio Supreme Court should not be treated as a\nmini-verdict on the mitigating factor, but instead it\nshould be read as an Eighth Amendment-required marking\nof the guidepost, the very guidepost that this Court in\nPenry said must be marked, the relevance of mitigating\nevidence of mental retardation.\nBut -- but Poland says it's wrong to think\nof that marking of that Eighth Amendment guidepost as a\nmini-verdict on mental retardation, and instead it\nshould just be thought of as one of the factors that was\nbounding the discretion of the sentencer. And so Poland\ninstructs that Mr. Bies and the Sixth Circuit are wrong\nto think of mental retardation as actually having been\nfound in some sense that affords preclusive effect,\nbecause instead it was just an Eighth Amendment\nbalancing.\nAnd instead what Atkins tells us is that the\nState of Ohio, just as the States were given the\nopportunity after Ford v. Wainwright in the insanity\ncontext, should be given the opportunity for the very\nfirst time in this case to implement Atkins to\ndetermine, given clinical expert judgment, whether or\nnot Mr. Bies is in fact mentally retarded under the\nthree-part --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I understand the argument\nthat the issues are not quite the same, that the Atkins\nissue of mental retardation is not quite the same as the\nissue that was litigated. Let's try and get that out of\nthe case. I think that's where Justice Kennedy was\ngoing.\nSuppose it was a gun case and the Supreme\nCourt originally thought you could convict people who\nsell drugs of simple possession of a gun. There's a\nfinding, because it's a bench trial, that he simply\npossessed but did not otherwise use the gun. Then the\nSupreme Court holds that that isn't enough under the\nstatute. So now the State wants to argue, because the\nproceeding on appeal or whatever is still going on, we\nwant a second shot at this; we want to show he did more\nthan simply possess. Is the State bound by what it\npreviously lost on or can the State -- can he get a\nsecond shot?\nMR. MIZER: The answer is that the State is\nnot bound, for two reasons, the first relating to issue\npreclusion and the second relating to the double\njeopardy doctrine in Ashe. On issue preclusion, the --\nthe finding with respect to the gun doesn't carry\npreclusive effect because this Court said in --\nSunnen and other cases that when there is a change in\nlegal consequences, that change is enough to prevent the\noperation of preclusive rules.\nBut on the double jeopardy doctrine --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I'm not -- I'm not going to\ngo into double jeopardy. I don't think necessarily that\nit's double jeopardy that -- that is relevant here. But\nI have a -- have you run into this in a different\ncontext? They wouldn't use the word \"double jeopardy.\"\nIt would be some kind of due process problem. Maybe\nthere isn't a problem. Have you run in your research to\nanything like what I described?\nMR. MIZER: No, Your Honor, because it is\nimportant to remember that this is -- this is a double\njeopardy case because of Ashe, and because this is in\nFederal habeas.\nWith respect to your question about due\nprocess or -- or other rules aside from due process,\nit's possible that the State could have more expansive\ncommon law or State law interpretations of the\ncollateral estoppel rules, and maybe those would benefit\nthe defendant. This Court in -- in the Hoag case\ndeclined to use due process to incorporate collateral\nestoppel rules constitutionally. So in your case the\ndefendant would only be left with the hope that the\nState would have more expansive collateral estoppel\nrules.\nBut to return to Ashe, the defendant here is\nclaiming that he is entitled to a constitutionalized\nversion of collateral estoppel because of Ashe, but he's\nnot entitled to that protection because Ashe applies\nonly where a defendant has previously been acquitted,\nand he has not.\nIt also applies only in a case where the\ndefendant is facing a successive jeopardy of some sort.\nNow, Mr. Bies's sentence is -- is surely at issue in\nthis case, but it's at issue in the sense that it would\nbe at issue in, say, a direct appeal. It's only --\nthere has only been one prosecution. The State has only\ntaken one crack at convicting him or imposing a\nsentence, and that one sentence is what's at issue here.\nAnd so there is not anything successive\nabout this case, and so the Double Jeopardy Clause,\neither through the put-in-jeopardy text or through the\nacquittal requirement, simply has nothing to offer Mr.\nBies in the way of assistance.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Could I ask you about --\nabout exhaustion? What should we do about exhaustion\nhere? I take it you don't -- you're not waiving\nexhaustion?\nMR. MIZER: Your Honor, we're not contending\nthat the Ashe claim is unexhausted. We agree that\nthat's exhausted because in the Ohio courts it is not\npermissible to take an interlocutory appeal when a\ndouble jeopardy claim has been denied, as it was in this\ncase.\nAnd so we are fine with the Sixth Circuit\nprecedent that holds that in that case the Federal\ncourts can act in habeas to prevent exposure to a double\njeopardy. We simply maintain that there is no second\njeopardy here. But the Atkins claim itself is\nunexhausted, and the Federal magistrate that first dealt\nwith this case in Federal Court held that it was\nunexhausted. And so now this case needs to go back down\nto the Ohio postconviction court, for what that court to\ndo what it was about to do, which is to hold an Atkins\nhearing for the very first time in this case.\nIf there are no further questions, I'll\nreserve the balance of my time.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Let -- let me just ask,\ndoes the State have any position now as to his IQ?\nMR. MIZER: No, Your Honor. The Ohio\npostconviction court said at pages 101 to 104a of the\nPetition Appendix that the IQ remains in question. Dr.\nWinters testified at trial that it was 68 or 69; she\nwasn't perfectly consistent. But other record evidence\nintroduced later on postconviction proceedings is not\nconsistent with that, and so that still needs to be\ndefinitively --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Wasn't there some\ntestimony that one test was only 50?\nMR. MIZER: That evidence is in the JA, and\nit was introduced after -- after the Ohio Supreme Court\nhad issued the decision at issue in this case. So that\nevidence is in the record, but it is not part of the\nOhio Supreme Court's finding. It was introduced on\npostconviction review. So it needs to be considered by\nthe experts and by the postconviction court when this\ngoes back to --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Will the State -- would\nyou say the State has an independent obligation to -- to\nensure itself that he has an adequate IQ?\nMR. MIZER: Absolutely, Your Honor, in order\nto be constitutionally consistent with -- with Atkins.\nBut that would be borne out through the -- the\nadversarial process in the Atkins hearing that hasn't\noccurred yet.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Blume.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN H. BLUME\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. BLUME: Mr. Chief Justice, may it please\nthe Court:\nMuch of the discussion so far has focused on\nissues which did not form the basis of the panel's\ndecision. The panel decided this case under 2254(d)(2).\nAnd what the panel determined was that the State court's\ndecision that Dr. Winter, who was the testifying\npsychiatrist, did not apply the clinical definition of\nmental retardation in forming her opinions and rendering\nher conclusions was an unreasonable determination of the\nfacts in light of the evidence presented in the State\ncourt proceeding.\nAnd it was on that basis the court went\nthrough the evidence and determined that, in fact,\nDr. Winter had used the clinical definition of mental\nretardation in rendering her opinion, and that that\nmeant that the Ohio Court of Appeals and the Ohio\nSupreme Court made a finding of mental retardation based\non the clinical -- the clinical definition of mental\nretardation.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But even -- even if that's\nso, that's not necessarily an -- an Atkins finding,\nisn't that correct?\nMR. BLUME: No, I think it is. It's not as\nif there's something --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Atkin -- Atkin -- we didn't\ndetermine what the definition of retardation was. We --\nwe operated in Atkins on a broad conception of\nretardation and we came down with a general rule. But\nwe left it for later litigation, starting in the States,\nto determine exactly how that line ought to be drawn.\nWe didn't know where the line ought to be\ndrawn at that point and certainly the clinical\npsychologists didn't know, regardless of what the --\nwhat definition was being used.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And the Ohio Supreme\nCourt acting years before Atkins.\nMR. BLUME: Pardon me?\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The -- wasn't the Ohio\nSupreme Court decision in this case pre-Atkins?\nMR. BLUME: Yes, it was. But the --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And it was dealing with\nretardation as a mitigator, not retardation as\nconclusive that there can be no death penalty.\nMR. BLUME: That's true, but the -- the\nimportant point, I think, that formed the basis of the\nSixth Circuit opinion was that in Lott versus -- which\nis the Ohio decision post-Atkins, in Lott they said\nwe're embracing the clinical definition of mental\nretardation.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But before you get to\nwhether -- anything like that, you are urging issue\npreclusion against the winner. It was a death sentence\nin this case. And I am not aware of issue preclusion\noperating against a judgment winner. Issue preclusion\nis for the party who fought this out and won.\nHere we have a death sentence. So there --\nthe ultimate determination, whatever intermediate\ndeterminations might have been made on the way, like\nmental retardation exists and was a mitigator, the\nultimate judgment is death. And I am not aware of, in\nall of issue preclusion, where a judgment winner is\nprecluded.\nMR. BLUME: Well, clearly that is the more\ntypical procedural context, and it happens normally in\nthe criminal context of someone that's been acquitted.\nBut the procedural posture here is unique, because what\nyou have is a prior finding of mental retardation\npre-Atkins, and clearly, at least according to the\npanel, using the definition of mental retardation which\nis now in effect in Ohio.\nThen subsequent to that you had this Court's\ndecision in Ohio -- I mean this Court's decision in\nAtkins, which creates a retroactive new rule which says\nthat people with mental retardation can't be executed.\nThe essence of a retroactive new rule is that it\nattaches new legal consequences to prior conduct.\nSo it is both the rule of Ashe, which says\nwhen an issue has been determined in a final proceeding,\ncombined with this Court's decision in Atkins placing a\ncategory of people --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But the question is what\nis the issue, and an intermediate finding, say\nmitigation, on the way to the ultimate conclusion, life\nor death, is not the same issue as if retardation is\nfound, no death penalty. It's -- it's the ultimate\nissue in the case that was before the Ohio Supreme Court\nis, do the aggravators outweigh the mitigators? That's\nthe ultimate determination, and that's what would have\npreclusive effect, not the many intermediate findings\nthat may have been made on the way to the ultimate\ndetermination of death.\nMR. BLUME: Well, Justice Ginsburg, I think\nthat minimizes or does not give adequate significance to\nwhat the Ohio Supreme Court describes as its role in --\non the appellate review. And they describe their role\nas being that they engage in an independent reweighing\nof the mitigation against the aggravation. A first step\nof that is the identification of the mitigating\ncircumstances.\nSo they have taken it upon themselves to\nidentify the mitigating circumstances, and they have to\ndo that by a preponderance of the evidence, which is the\nsame standard which exists now in a Lott proceeding.\nIn the course of reviewing Mr. Bies's\nsentence on appeal, intermediate appeal of the court of\nappeals, and then the Ohio Supreme Court, both courts\nfound that Mr. Bies had mental retardation. It's not\nalso -- I mean, they have described this as an essential\nfunction of their role, and they also don't do it\nuncritically.\nThere are other cases, State v. White for\nexample, in which they made an express finding that the\nindividual had not proven his mental retardation.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: In -- in response to\nJustice Ginsburg's question, I don't see why it makes\nany difference which court is doing what. She -- she\nraised two objections. Number one is that so far as the\nissue being determined in the prior proceeding, the\ncharacterization of his mental state as retardation was\nat most a subsidiary, not an ultimate fact.\nNumber two, the conclusion of that prior\nproceeding was that he lost. And she's saying in those,\nin either of those circumstances, the subsidiary finding\nis not preclusive and any finding is not preclusive in\nthe manner in which he wishes to use it here.\nI don't see what difference it makes whether\nwe're talking about court A or court B. What is -- what\nis your response to those two objections?\nMR. BLUME: Well, on the first point, I\ndidn't mean that it necessarily matters which court it\ndid. I was saying that -- trying to describe -- usually\nthe necessary part, which is in some ways what we're\ntalking about here, was it necessary, turns on two\nconsiderations. And the necessary -- it's designed to\ndetermine, as I understand it, one, was the issue\ndecided; and, two, was it decided with some care for its\nsignificance to the proceeding?\nAnd I think, given the unique way in which\nOhio does the sentence review, both of those concerns\nare satisfied. As for --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: If -- if the Ohio court had\nfound, the court of first instance had found, that the\nIQ was at some different level, it could have come out\nexactly the same way it came out in this case, couldn't\nit?\nMR. BLUME: Yes, it could have.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So the finding was not\nnecessary to the result?\nMR. BLUME: Well --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I mean, we went through\nthis with your brother, and he pointed out, yes, it was\nnecessary to -- to consider the issue and to make some\nkind of a finding -- I don't know how precise it had to\nbe -- but the finding that it made, the -- the actual\nnumber that was used or the characterization that was\nused to describe that number was not necessary in order,\nin fact, to impose the death penalty.\nMR. BLUME: Well, I --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And -- and the sense of\nnecessity which is used normally in -- in this kind of\npreclusion analysis just doesn't apply here.\nMR. BLUME: Well, that is not my reading of\nthe necessary cases. I read that the function that the\nnecessary prong serves as trying to serve two goals.\nNumber one, was the issue, the question, the issue --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: How do you say you\nhave -- you don't find that in the cases when you said\nto me, and I think frankly you were right, that issue\npreclusion -- and there are many, many cases on issue\npreclusion -- is something that a judgment winner uses,\nnot a judgment loser, and here the Ohio -- yes, they\nweighed and they found retardation, but they also found\noverwhelmed by the aggravating circumstances. So the\nultimate determination of that, of all the courts, is\ndeath?\nI don't see how you get to elevate an\nintermediate determination -- there are many; some go\nfor one party, some go for the other -- to become the\noutcome determinative factor. The outcome determinative\nfactor is that the aggregators outweighed whatever\nmitigators there were.\nMR. BLUME: Well, I mean -- again, that is\nnot my understanding of the role the necessary clause\nplays.\nBut now, on to the winner point. So if\nthat's necessary -- I don't think there's anything in\nAshe v. Swenson that says you have to win on the\nultimate outcome. It's do you win on the fact. If\nthat's right -- and let's imagine --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But Ashe is about\nsomebody who was acquitted. He won. There was no doubt\nthat he won.\nMR. BLUME: I understand.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: It didn't say anything\nabout, well, suppose he didn't win.\nMR. BLUME: But the Ashe rule is stated in\nterms of when an issue of fact has been determined in a\ndefendant's favor it's binding in any subsequent\nlitigation.\nBut if the Warden is right -- and let's\nimagine now Mr. Bies goes back for his mental\nretardation hearing, and the court says: Yes, Mr. Bies\nis mentally retarded; on the other hand, I think Atkins\nwas wrongly decided.\nIt goes up on appeal to the Ohio Supreme\nCourt and they say: Yes, Mr. Bies is mentally retarded,\nbut we think Atkins was wrongly decided. The case comes\nto this Court, and you summarily reverse and say Atkins\nis still the law of the land.\nNow it goes back, and the Warden could then\nsay: Well, now that we know you're serious about\nAtkins, we want to reopen the judgment and we want\nanother shot --\nJUSTICE BREYER: It's not reopen -- it's --\nit's the same problem. And maybe you found some\nauthority to the contrary, other than statements, but\nactual authority. The defendant loses. He appeals. He\nsays they made a mistake. And the normal remedy is you\ngive him a new trial. Does it matter that it's a\ncollateral proceeding? I don't think so. They go to\nthe Federal court: Judge, they made a mistake at my\ntrial. You give him a new trial. Everything's up for\ngrabs normally at the new trial. I can't think of an\ninstance where it isn't.\nHere, they are saying: Judge, they made a\nmistake. They should have applied the mental\nretardation rule of Atkins. So give him a new trial.\nNow, what I'm looking for is just one\nexample somewhere that supports you --\nMR. BLUME: Well --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- that didn't proceed on\nthe theory I've just announced or just said.\nMR. BLUME: Well, I -- I mean, I can't give\nyou a case exactly like that, but, again, I think the\nprocedure --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, I want a case even\nvaguely like that.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. BLUME: I think what you have are the\ncases -- you had the cases which essentially are the\nlegal equivalent of insufficient evidence on appeal.\nNow, that's not technically an acquittal, but it's\ntreated as an acquittal. But what you have here is a\nfinding of fact combined with a later decision on the --\nestablishing a retroactive new rule, moving people\noutside --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How far -- how far\ndown do you go on applying the issue preclusion? Let's\nsay there's a ruling by the court that a particular\nexpert was not credible. I mean, is that binding in a\nsubsequent proceeding?\nMR. BLUME: No, Mr. Chief Justice. I think\nit would have to do one of two things. It would either\nhave to absolve the criminal defendant of liability,\nwhich is sort of the common rule under Ashe, or it would\nhave to render him ineligible for the death penalty,\nthough the definition of acquittal used in Sattazahn is\nhad there been a finding which -- legally sufficient to\nlegally entitle the defendant to a life sentence. And\nit is Mr. Bies's position that the finding of mental\nretardation --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's\nnarrowing it to your particular context. I would have\nassumed that the theory has to be more generally\napplicable, and not just applicable in the particular\nAtkins context. If you can have issue preclusion with\nrespect to an underlying factual question under which\nthe loser can assert that, I don't see why it wouldn't\napply more generally. That's a theory of the Double\nJeopardy Clause, not of Atkins.\nMR. BLUME: Well, it's a theory of\ncollateral estoppel which is based in the Double\nJeopardy Clause, which is what -- the issue on which the\npanel resolved this question. And I think that -- as I\nread the collateral estoppel cases, again and even in\nthe context of capital sentencing and double jeopardy,\nthe finding would have to be either at the -- at the\ncriminal liability stage, would it absolve the defendant\nof liability, like in the Ashe context. The finding was\none of identity. In the first trial, the jury\nacquitted. The only issue was identity. When this\ncourt looked at the record as a whole -- and then they\nsaid, okay, you can't subsequently litigate the prior --\nthe nuts crimes on the issue of identity. In the\ncapital sentencing context, at least here, a finding of\nmental retardation is a finding sufficient to entitle\nthe defendant --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Your argument, then --\nwe're getting somewhere maybe.\nMR. BLUME: Pardon me?\nJUSTICE BREYER: You're saying to me, think\nof Jackson and Denno, If you're in a collateral\nproceeding and the Federal judge said there wasn't\nenough evidence to convict him under the Constitution,\nlike the Shuffling Sam case, there isn't enough\nevidence; it isn't that he gets a new trial. The\nConstitution entitles him to acquittal, and therefore\nthere is no new trial because of the Double Jeopardy\nClause, right?\nMR. BLUME: That's correct.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. So you're\nsaying here, the evidence the first time was such that\nthey couldn't give him the death penalty under the\nConstitution as later interpreted. So if that's what\nyou discover on the collateral appeal, a similar\nreasoning would somehow lead you to the similar result.\nIs that the argument?\nMR. BLUME: That's more or less the\nargument. And the panel --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But if that is the\nargument, then what is being preclusive here is not the\nfirst judgment. I mean, in preclusion cases it's the\nfirst judgment that precludes, and we identify a\njudgment which is preclusive in the way we've been\ndescribing. But in the hypothetical that Justice Breyer\ngave you, there's nothing preclusive about the first\njudgment because the first judgment stands and properly\ncan stand. And you're saying there can't be a second\njudgment, but you are not depending upon a rule of\npreclusion that turns on the first. So whatever your\nargument is, it's not -- it's not issue preclusion.\nMR. BLUME: Well, it is the combination of\nthe determination that Mr. Bies is a person with mental\nretardation using the same definition according to the\npanel, which is now in effect in the State of Ohio,\nwhich would apply in a Lott proceeding if he were to\nhave it tomorrow.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Sure, but you're coming up\nwith a brand new rule. Whatever your rule is, it's not\na rule of double jeopardy and it's not -- it's not the\ntraditional rule of issue preclusion.\nMR. BLUME: Well, it is the combination of\nthat factual determination with the subsequent rule, a\nretroactive new rule. I mean, it's unusual because\nthere are very few retroactive new rules of procedure\nwhich place someone outside --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, but what your rule is,\nas I understand it in your response to Justice Breyer's\nquestion, is if there was a subsidiary fact\ndetermination in the first case, even though it was\nentirely consistent with the judgment against your\nclient, that's subsidiary fact determination can be used\nas a defense by your client in the second case. That's\nyour rule, as I understand it, and that is not the rule\nof Ashe v. Swenson and it is not the rule of issue\npreclusion.\nMR. BLUME: It could be used if there is a\nlater legal ruling which means the significance of that\nfact would either absolve the criminal defendant of\nliability or make him ineligible for death.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, you -- do you agree\nwith me that you're asking for a brand-new rule here?\nMR. BLUME: I don't think it is a brand-new\nrule.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: We have never held this,\nand I don't know of any court that's ever held this.\nMR. BLUME: But I think the reason you\nhaven't isn't --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, why isn't it brand\nnew?\nMR. BLUME: It's because of the unique\nprocedural posture of this case.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, maybe the unique\nprocedural posture is precisely the reason that the rule\nis brand new. If it's unique, we've never had it\nbefore.\nMR. BLUME: But --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: We have the factor that\nyou would preclude Ohio from doing, when we expressly\nsaid that here is the rule: You can't execute the\nmentally retarded. However, we are going to leave it to\nthe State to shape the procedure, and what are the\nelements of retardation? You would take all that away\nfrom Ohio because in a different context, the context of\nweighing mitigators against aggravators, the Ohio\nSupreme Court said there was retardation, it is\nmitigating; however, it was overwhelmed by the\naggravators.\nIt's an entirely different operation than,\nStates, here's the rule; the procedure for doing it is\nup to you. Ohio didn't have a procedure for doing\nAtkins. It couldn't until Atkins was decided. And now\nyou're saying, oh, Ohio, because you, in the context of\nweighing mitigators against aggravators, found this\nmitigator, you cannot shape the Atkins procedure as\nevery other State can.\nMR. BLUME: Well, I don't think that's a\nfair determination of what the panel did in this case.\nWhat the panel said is, number one, that we look at the\nprocedure and definition of mental retardation that Ohio\nhas adopted. Now, it is the same as the definition of\nmental retardation which was used by Dr. Winter in her\ntestimony in Mr. Bies's trial, and is the -- that is the\nsole basis for the determination. And they said the\nburdens of proof are the same. He had the burden of\nestablishing this fact of mental retardation by a\npreponderance, and that's the same. So, therefore, on\nthat basis, they decided he --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But the incentive is\nvastly different, which is an important factor in issue\npreclusion. That is, if the prosecutor thinks that\nthere's overwhelming evidence of the aggravators, the\nnature of the crime, the prosecutor is not going to care\nso much about, so there is mental retardation as a\nmitigator; but when it's a difference, when the\nprosecutor wants to go for the death penalty and it\nthinks that it's got a secure case on the atrocious\nmatter in which the crime was committed, there isn't the\nsame incentive to litigate as there is when it is the\nultimate question, not an issue on the way to reaching\nthe ultimate judgment.\nMR. BLUME: Well, I don't think, Justice\nGinsburg, the incentives have to be identical, but\ncertainly prior to Atkins the prosecution had the\nincentive to contest the mental retardation question,\nand in fact in this case the failure to more adequately\ncontest it wasn't due to a lack of incentives, it was\ndue to a lack of evidence. There were three experts\nthat evaluated Mr. Bies, all of whom came to virtually\nidentical conclusions. About his mental state.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, this strikes\nme as the sort of case where their incentives might well\nbe different, as Justice Ginsburg suggested. If you're\ndealing with a borderline case, you don't -- and you\nthink you have very compelling aggravating factors, you\nknow, why call attention to the -- the mitigating factor\nof the mental condition when your case can be won on the\nothers?\nMR. BLUME: Well, I think for three reasons,\nMr. Chief Justice. Number one, as this Court recognized\nin Atkins, in cases where there was evidence of mental\nretardation, the jury was much less likely to impose a\ndeath sentence; that in part was part of the basis of\nthis Court's decision in Atkins. Second, on appeal, by\nnot contesting the evidence -- the State of Ohio did\ncontest it here -- you ran the risk that the Ohio Court\nof Appeals or the Ohio Supreme Court would reach a\ndifferent conclusion, number one, on the balance of\naggravation and mitigation; or, number two, on whether\nthe death sentence was disproportion. And the Ohio\nSupreme Court had done that in several other cases.\nBut here also, right, you had not only the\ndirect appeal and the findings, but you have additional\nfindings and concessions in State postconviction, where\nMr. Bies goes in in State postconviction, and he raises\na pre-Atkins categorical bar claim, and says I'm a\nperson with mental retardation; since this Court's\ndecision in Penry, things have changed; and I believe my\ndeath sentence is disproportionate under the Ohio and\nthe United States Constitution.\nIn response to that, the State, number one,\nconceded mental retardation and said we agree the record\nreveals Mr. Bies is a person with mental retardation,\nand the postconviction court then enters a finding of\nfact.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Did they admit that as a\nfinding of fact, or did they say that mental retardation\nhad been found as a mitigator by the Ohio Supreme Court?\nMR. BLUME: No, they said the record reveals\nMr. Bies to be a person with mental retardation, with an\nIQ of 69. It is not that there was, we assume for the\nsake of argument, it was nothing like a mitigating. It\nwas a finding of fact, now that Mr. Bies was a person --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: It was an admission; it\ncouldn't have been a finding of fact. You said that\nthat's what the State claimed. Where is the admission\nof the State in this State postconviction proceeding\nthat Mr. Bies is mentally retarded?\nMR. BLUME: It is in the Joint Appendix at\n153. This is actually the State court order, the\nfinding of fact, and it says: Findings of fact. The\ndefendant is shown by the record to be mildly mentally\nretarded with an IQ of 69.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You told me that this --\nthat State conceded that the defendant was mentally\nretarded, and I'm -- that's what I asked you.\nMR. BLUME: I'm sorry, that is both at JA\n143 where -- JA 143 in the State's motion, response for\njudgment: \"The record reveals defendant to be mildly\nmentally retarded with an IQ of 69.\" And that\nconcession is repeated in the post conviction appeal at\npage 160 of the Joint Appendix.\nJUSTICE ALITO: What does that have to do\nwith issue preclusion? The State can't -- that may\nraise an issue of judicial estoppel. Is that\nconstitutionally required?\nMR. BLUME: I think it primarily does raise\na question of judicial estoppel, which we raised, which\nis -- and that is not a technical basis on which to\ngrant habeas. It is a reason that the writ should be\ndismissed as improvidently granted.\nThere have been multiple concessions after\nthat. This was raised by Mr. Bies in his, sort of --\nwhen he asked for estoppel, he asked for it on multiple\nbases. Just as the fact that the warden, the panel\nagain decided this under 2254(d)(2) grounds. The warden\ndid not raise an issue under 2254(d)(2) in this Court.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But I'm not sure that\nthere's even anything -- I mean, it does raise a\njudicial estoppel issue, but I'm not sure there is a --\na record hereupon which a -- a judicial estoppel claim\ncould be maintained, because in the passages that you\nreferred us to, first the State's concession and\nsecondly the finding which -- which followed from it, it\nwas a reference to mild mental retardation and a\nspecific reference to an IQ of 69.\nI think it's a stretch, would be a stretch,\nto go from saying that a concession of mild mental\nretardation for purposes of mitigation analysis should\nbe taken as a concession for dispositive mental\nretardation for Atkins purposes. So I -- I have\ndifficulty in seeing any clear inconsistency in the\nState's two positions.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The very next sentence is\nas a matter of law -- the law as it was then -- such a\nperson may be punished by execution. So, again, it's --\nthe stakes are quite different.\nMR. BLUME: Well, not in regard to this\nparticular claim. The claim that we're talking about\nwhere this concession was made and where this finding\nwas made wasn't -- this wasn't the brief on mitigation,\nthis was a postconviction challenge to his death\nsentence as a matter of law, saying --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But that must have been,\nthe page you called my attention to must have been\npre-Atkins.\nMR. BLUME: It was pre-Atkins, but the claim\nwas a pre-Atkins Atkins claim. The claim was not - was\nI am categorically ineligible for the death penalty, and\nI am ineligible because since the Court's decision in\nAtkins, things have changed.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: No, no, we're back --\nwhat you called my attention to was pre-Atkins. It was\nthe application made to the State court before Atkins\nwhich put two sentences together. One was the record\nreveals defendant to be mildly mentally regarded with an\nIQ of about 69. As a matter of law, such a person may\nbe punished by execution. This is all pre-Atkins.\nSo one statement has to be read in the light\nof what was its significance, and it wasn't the\nconclusive factor at the time of that motion.\nMR. BLUME: Well, that was the claim. His\nclaim was it violates the Eighth Amendment to excuse\npeople with mental retardation. This was not -- this\nwas after the direct appeal. He now filed for post\nconviction and he goes in and says, look, I've been sort\nof tracking things since Atkins; States have -- adopt\nnew laws.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Since Atkins, we're\ntalking about --\nMR. BLUME: I'm sorry, since Penry. Since\nPenry there have been new developments, and I believe\nthat a new consensus exists, the one that this Court\nsubsequently embraced, and it violates the Eighth\nAmendment and the Ohio Constitution to execute persons\nwith mental retardation. And it was in response to that\nclaim that the State conceded the fact of mental\nretardation, and it was in response to that claim that\nthe State court found again Mr. Bies to be a person with\nmental retardation.\nThat wasn't in some question of the balance\nof aggravating circumstances. That was a straight claim\nthat you cannot execute me because I have mental\nretardation.\nAnd so I was really responding more to\nJustice Souter's questions of judicial estoppel and was\nit the same issue in this, and I think it clearly was at\nthat time in this particular context.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Mizer, you have ten minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF BENJAMIN C. MIZER\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. MIZER: First, with respect to the\njudicial estoppel arguments and the State's purported\nconcessions, as Justice Ginsburg noted, the statement to\nwhich Mr. Bies points was pre-Atkins, and Mr. Bies's\nargument ignores that Atkins changed things in two ways:\none consequential, by enacting, by placing a categorical\nbar on the States; and the second, definitional. So for\nthe reasons stated of our -- in our yellow brief at\npages 16 to 18, the judicial estoppel argument fails for\nall kinds of reasons.\nBut more to the point, judicial estoppel\nshouldn't apply here also because the State, whatever it\nwas saying at the time, was not talking about the\nthree-part post-Atkins definition of mental retardation\nin Ohio.\nMr. Bies also argues that 2254(d)(2) is\nenough to give support to -- to the Sixth Circuit's\ngrant of relief -- of relief here, but there are two\nproblems with that argument. The first problem is that\nthe Sixth Circuit disregarded the reasonable\ndetermination by the State's postconviction court that\nthe Atkins standard had never been applied. The second\nproblem is that we shouldn't even get to 2254(d)(2)\nbecause there are legal problems with the Sixth\nCircuit's reasoning that should have prevented it from\ngranting the writ under 2254(d)(1). Mr. Bies argues\nthat there is not a legal problem because there was an\nacquittal in this case, because the Ohio Supreme Court's\nstatement on direct review that Mr. Bies -- that Mr.\nBies's mild to borderline mental retardation merits\nweight and mitigation was enough to entitle him to a\nlife sentence. But that's not an acquittal, and it's a\nsevere distortion of what this Court said in Sattazahn\nabout an acquittal.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Mizer, can I just get\none clarifying question? The concession at page 160 of\nthe record, \"The record reveals the defendant to be\nmildly retarded with an IQ of about 69,\" and then they\nargue as a matter of law that he cannot be -- he may be\npunished. Is it your position that the further\nproceeding in the Ohio trial court, that the State\nintends to argue that a person who is mentally retarded\nwith an IQ of about 69 may be executed?\nMR. MIZER: No, Your Honor, the -- this\nstatement will be beside the point, and the question now\npost-Atkins --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: So you'll offer evidence\nto show that statement is inaccurate?\nMR. MIZER: The -- the question is, the\nquestion posed in Atkins doesn't hinge so narrowly on\nIQ. IQ is one of the three elements, and so the experts\non -- on postconviction review will now determine what\nhis IQ is.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I understand that. The --\ncould well be different. But is it Ohio's intent to\ndisagree with that statement insofar as it recites\nfacts? That the record reveals the defendant to be\nmildly mentally retarded with an IQ of about 69? I\nunderstand you will argue that that's not sufficient to\n-- to come within Atkins. But do you intend to say --\nto challenge the accuracy of that factual statement?\nMR. MIZER: Yes, Your Honor, as the State\npostconviction court stated in this case, that -- the\nrecord evidence pertaining to IQ is not clear; and so\nIQ, among all of the other elements of the mental\nretardation, will be up for determination.\nIf there are no further questions, we would\nask that you reverse the Sixth Circuit.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
