SEB S.A.\nMr. Dunnegan.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM DUNNEGAN\nON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS\nMR. DUNNEGAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe standard for the state of mind element\nfor a claim for inducing patent infringement should be:\nDid the accused inducer have a purpose to induce a third\nparty to engage in acts that the accused inducer knew\ninfringed the patent? That's what I'll call the\npurposeful, culpable test.\nThe Federal Circuit applied a standard of\nwhether Pentalpha was deliberately indifferent to a\nknown risk that a patent may exist. The Federal\nCircuit's deliberate indifference test was not a willful\nblindness test. Willful blindness would have required\nboth an awareness of a high probability that a patent\nwould exist and a deliberate effort to avoid learning\nthe truth.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And that's okay, as far as\nyou're concerned? You would consider that comes within\nyour first test?\nMR. DUNNEGAN: Your Honor, deliberate\nindifference would not fall -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Would not, but willful\nblindness would?\nMR. DUNNEGAN: No, Your Honor. Willful\nblindness would not fall within our purposeful, culpable\ntest.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So even willful blindness\nwouldn't be enough?\nMR. DUNNEGAN: Willful blindness in not a\npurpose, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You said that the\nparticular patent -- the defendant would have to know\nthat the device infringed the particular patent. I\nthink that would be a standard that would be impossible\nto meet. We have to know if it was patent number,\nwhatever it was, '312.\nMR. DUNNEGAN: Well, you wouldn't have to\nknow the patent number, Your Honor, but what you would\nhave to know is that your -- the product which you are\ninducing a third party to make, use, or sell would be\nwithin the scope of a -- of the claims of a particular\npatent. If you don't know that, then you're\nliterally -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But you can keep yourself\nignorant of it. I mean, for example, you pointed out\nthat the -- that the device that was copied was\npurchased in Hong Kong, so it didn't have any marking,\nbut the same Pentalpha could have bought the device in\nMontgomery Ward, looked to see if it had a patent\nmarking; didn't do that.\nMR. DUNNEGAN: It didn't do that, Your\nHonor. What it did was better. It hired a United\nStates patent attorney to conduct a search to see if\nthere was any patent which was infringed.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But didn't tell that\npatent attorney that they had reverse-engineered a\nparticular product. If the attorney had been told this\ndevice copied the SEB fryer, isn't it 99 and 44/100ths\npercent sure that the attorney then would have found\nthis patent?\nMR. DUNNEGAN: We don't know, Your Honor.\nWe don't know why the patent search failed. It could\nhave failed for a number of reasons.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But I didn't ask you\nabout this patent search. I said if they had told the\npatent attorney we have copied a particular fryer, it's\nSEB's fryer, now find out if it infringed any patent -\ndo you think an attorney would not have found the SEB\npatent?\nMR. DUNNEGAN: It's possible that he\nwouldn't have. Maybe it's more probable that he would\nhave. There's just no evidence on that in the record,\nYour Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, why -- why wouldn't\nyou tell him? If you're -- if you're honestly\ninterested in finding out whether there is a patent that\nyou're infringing, why wouldn't you tell me the reason\nwe're concerned is that we have reverse-engineered this\nfrom somebody else's product? Just check to see if SEB\nhas a patent on any of this stuff that we've\nreverse-engineered. That's what I would have done.\nMR. DUNNEGAN: Your Honor, maybe that's what\nyou would have done. Maybe that's what I would have\ndone, but there's no -- but the standard of that\nbusiness -- what they had done in the past was to give\ntheir design drawings to the patent attorney and say\nobjectively check these design drawings. Their practice\nwas not to notify the attorney.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Was their practice to\nreverse-engineer from other people's products?\nMR. DUNNEGAN: Yes -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, I can understand\nwhen you have a new product of your own; of course, you\njust give it to an attorney. But when you have\nreverse-engineered, not to tell them that it was\nreversed-engineered seems to me really trying to keep\nyourself in the dark. What you want to get from the\nattorney is a piece of paper that he can show to\nMontgomery Ward that, yes, this product is not -- as it\nturns out, Montgomery Ward did accept it and got hit\nwith liability for infringing a patent. I -- I find\nthat really incredible that, in an honest attempt to\nfind whether there was any patent infringement going on,\nyou wouldn't even tell the patent attorney that you've\nreverse-engineered somebody else's product.\nMR. DUNNEGAN: Your Honor, looking back at\nthis in hindsight, there's -- there's no question that\nif they had to do it again, they would have taken the\nadditional step.\nBut -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No, they wouldn't.\nMR. DUNNEGAN: No -- well, from an objective\nperspective, Your Honor, if you're giving the design to\nthe -- to the attorney and you're saying do a complete\nsearch, it seems to me that that's the antithesis of\nbeing willful blind, because you're hiring a specialist\nto go out and look for the answer for you. Now, the\ngold standard was not met, but the gold standard would\nrarely be met in any of these cases.\nJUSTICE ALITO: But your position is that\neven willful blindness is not enough. You have to have\nactual knowledge that -- that the item is patented,\nright?\nMR. DUNNEGAN: That is correct, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE ALITO: So if the attorney had\ncalled up your client and said, I have an answer for\nyou, and the client said, well, you know what, on second\nthought, I really don't want to know, because if I -- if\nI have actual knowledge, that may put me in a box; so\nforget about it. Then there's no liability.\nMR. DUNNEGAN: Well, I would disagree in\nthat situation, because most probably the knowledge of\nthe attorney in that situation, because he has been\nhired by the client, would be imputed to the client. So\nI could see a different result in the hypothetical that\nyou posited.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Why would we -- wouldn't\nthe rule that you're setting forth, willful blindness\nnot being a part of it, mean that nobody would ever get\na patent search, because what would be the inducement to\ndo that?\nMR. DUNNEGAN: Well, Your Honor, right now,\nunder -- under the Seagate case in the Federal Circuit,\nthere is no inducement to go get a patent search. Under\nthe Seagate decision, if a party -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No, but you're not\npresumed to copy other people's items, which is the\ndifference.\nIs there -- let me just ask you something.\nAssuming we were to find the willful blindness test to\nactual knowledge, the facts of your case, the fact that\nthey did not give the name of the product that they\ncopied to their patent attorney, is that just, as a\nmatter of law, willful blindness?\nMR. DUNNEGAN: No, Your Honor, I don't think\nthat is willful blindness as a matter of law. Willful\nblindness under the -- under the Santos standard has two\ndistinct elements. One would be that there's a high\nprobability that there would have been a patent on that\nparticular product.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Do patents -- are\npatents -- can you do a patent search on the basis of\nthe name of the holder?\nMR. DUNNEGAN: Yes, you can, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And the product that\nthey copied, did it have the name of the holder of the\npatent?\nMR. DUNNEGAN: Yes, it did, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So what is the\nlikelihood that if they had actually given the attorney\nthe name of the product, that he would not have found\nthe patent?\nMR. DUNNEGAN: We don't know for sure, but\nthe probability would be greater than 50 percent, Your\nHonor.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I think it would be\nprobably 90 percent, assuming -- because there's always\nerrors in searches. So -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But didn't we take this\ncase to determine whether or not deliberate indifference\nis the standard? I mean, willful blindness -- I don't\nthink an opinion for this Court has ever sustained.\nSantos was a judgment -- was not a majority opinion.\nThat's just a subset of knowledge.\nIf we leave that out from it, isn't the\ndichotomy that you present to us the difference between\ndeliberate indifference and knowledge or -\nMR. DUNNEGAN: Purpose.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- or purposeful, culpable\nexpression, the -- the Grokster standard?\nMR. DUNNEGAN: Yes. The -- well, I think to\nanswer the question presented in a cert petition, you\nreally need to determine what the standard is. Now, I\nthink we can also decide that it should not be -- or we\ncan agree that it should not be a deliberate\nindifference to a known risk that a patent exists,\nbecause that would be met in virtually every situation\nwhere there was not actual knowledge of a patent.\nJUSTICE ALITO: When I look at the language\nof the statute, I see no scienter requirement\nwhatsoever. Whoever actively induces infringement of\nthe patent -- infringement is strict liability. So if\nyou actively induce somebody to engage in conduct\nconstituting infringement, you're -- you're liable as an\ninducer.\nMR. DUNNEGAN: Let me explain to you why\nyour -- why the language of the statute should not\nsupport the interpretation which Your Honor just gave.\nLet's begin with the word \"induces.\"\n\"Induces\" connotes some degree of intent, arguably.\nMr. Cruz agrees with that at page 20 of his brief. If\nyou put the word \"actively\" in front of the word\n\"induces,\" then you have a heightened intent standard -\nJUSTICE ALITO: You have intent, but intent\nto do what?\nMR. DUNNEGAN: Exactly, Your Honor. That\nbrings you to the word \"infringement\" in the statute.\nNow, I think it's critical that (b) uses the word\n\"infringement.\" It does not go back to (a) and say\nanyone who actively induces the making, using, selling\nof a patent device is an infringer.\nJUSTICE ALITO: What difference does that\nmake? Because making, using, and selling equals\ninfringement.\nMR. DUNNEGAN: Because those are the acts,\nYour Honor. If Congress's intent had been to say we\nonly want to induce acts, it would seem to me the\nclearest way they could say that is to say \"making,\nusing, or selling.\" If they wanted to create a standard\nwhich was inducing the actual infringement of a patent,\nas opposed to the acts which constitute the\ninfringement, then they use the word \"infringement.\"\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, I don't see that. And\nnot only that, I don't understand why the scienter\nrequirement for inducing should be higher than the\nscienter requirement for a direct infringement. Isn't\nthe standard rule for aiding and abetting that the aider\nand abetter -- if (b) is an aiding and abetting\nprovision, as one of the congressional reports said, the\n-- the scienter for aiding and abetting is the scienter\nof the underlying offense? So if the underlying offense\nis a strict liability offense, then the inducement\nshould be strict liability as well.\nMR. DUNNEGAN: That's not necessarily clear,\nYour Honor. When you look at 18 U.S.C. section 2,\nthere's very little case law dealing with strict\nliability offense and inducements of those. We have\nbeen able to identify one Sixth Circuit case from 1989\nwhich deals with the issue, and in that case, it holds\nthat there's actually a purpose to -- a purpose to cause\nthe underlying crime or violation, not necessarily\nstrict liability, not strict liability.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is your -\nMR. DUNNEGAN: I -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry.\nMR. DUNNEGAN: No, please, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is your position\nwhen you're -- when you're talking about willful\nblindness or purpose, whatever, is that with respect to\na particular patent, or is it with respect to\ninfringement of a patent?\nI don't think it's true with deep fryers,\nbut in some areas, you almost always know you're going\nto hit something, that given the nature of the industry,\nyou're going to infringe something. Is that enough?\nMR. DUNNEGAN: If there is an area -- for\nexample, semiconductors, where some amici have stated\nthat there's -- there's 420,000 patents dealing with\nsemiconductors. And you know that, and you know that if\nyou do virtually anything, and especially if you copy,\nyou're going to hit a semiconductor patent owned by\nsomebody, I think that, in that rare situation,\nknowledge that you're infringing someone's intellectual\nproperty rights should probably be enough of a -- of a\ndirected intent. If you -- that would be the basis for\ninferring a purpose.\nBut here, we have to -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But that's -- I\nmean, I understand you're in the deep fryer industry,\nbut that standard would bring the semiconductor industry\nto a halt.\nMR. DUNNEGAN: No. No, Your Honor. If you\ncopied a semiconductor and you knew that there were\n420,000 patents that were unexpired out there, that\nwould make it -- if you didn't do your -- your\ndiligence, perhaps -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I think the -- the\nproblem is, even if you do do your diligence, given the\nway patents are these days, if there are 420,000, you're\nnever going to know with any degree of comfort that\nyou're not going to infringe something.\nMR. DUNNEGAN: That is very, very true, Your\nHonor. And even in the -- in the deep-fryer industry,\nit is going to be different, because there's very few --\nI mean, compared to semiconductors -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, we're not going to\nadopt a special rule for the deep-fryer industry.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. DUNNEGAN: Agreed.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Especially -\nMR. DUNNEGAN: Completely agreed.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But we might decide\nthat it's more important to consider what's going to\nhappen to the semiconductor industry in articulating our\nstandard than what's going to happen to the deep-fryer\nindustry.\nMR. DUNNEGAN: That's exactly correct, Your\nHonor.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. DUNNEGAN: That's exactly correct. And\non balance -- I think there's one point that I should\nmake sooner rather than later, and it's is the standard\nthat I'm -- the standard that we are proposing is not\nunique to us. It's the -- it's the standard that\nGrokster developed. And with respect to willful\nblindness, we believe that the standard -- the balance\nwas already struck, and it was struck in favor of\neliminating a willful blindness standard.\nI'd like to -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Dunnegan, suppose I\ndisagree with you on that, and suppose I think that\nactual knowledge of a patent or willful blindness as to\nwhether a patent exists is the right standard. Could a\nreasonable jury have found that in this case?\nMR. DUNNEGAN: We don't think that a\nreasonable jury could have found willful blindness\nbecause, first of all, there wasn't a high probability\nthat a patent would be found. Second, we do not think\nthat there was active -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: A reasonable jury couldn't\nhave looked at the facts that Justice Ginsburg\nsuggested -- you know, you do not tell the lawyer that\nyou, in fact, have copied the product and say that's -\na reasonable jury -- that's willful blindness.\nMR. DUNNEGAN: I don't think so, Your Honor,\nbecause what we have done in that situation was, first,\nwe have done more than the law required. We went out to\nget a patent. We gave the lawyer our actual patent\ndrawings and tell him to do his work.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But if you really wanted\nto know, wouldn't you have gone into Montgomery Ward and\nbought one of the fryers and turned it around to see if\nit had a patent number on it?\nMR. DUNNEGAN: Your Honor, we have so many\nproducts that you couldn't practically expect the\ncompany to do that, I don't think.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Listen, the -- the reason\nyou got the opinion from the lawyer was -- was not to\nmake sure that there were no patents. It was to show\nthat opinion to Montgomery Ward.\nMR. DUNNEGAN: But your -- your -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: As a practical matter, you\nneeded an opinion from a lawyer, because otherwise,\nMontgomery Ward was not going to sell this stuff.\nMR. DUNNEGAN: Your Honor, I take issue with\nyou for the following reason: I don't think there was\nany intention on the part of our client to -- to\ninfringe a patent at all, because if it knew about the\npatent, it could have designed around it if it knew what\nit was doing. There's no benefit to our client of\ngetting Montgomery Ward or Sunbeam or Fingerhut in\ntrouble for patenting infringement. We really want to\nknow what patents are out there.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But isn't -- isn't it\ntrue that Sunbeam was the party that asked for the\npatent search?\nMR. DUNNEGAN: I don't believe that's in the\nrecord, Your Honor. I believe the record shows that\nSunbeam was given a copy of the patent search, but\nMr. Sham testified -- and I believe this is about at\npage 50 of the joint appendix -- that the purpose of the\nsearch was to find out whether or not there was an\ninfringement of any patent through this deep fryer.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And there's nothing in\nthe record that says who -- who asked Pentalpha -\nMR. DUNNEGAN: Not that I'm aware of, Your\nHonor.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- to get -- to get a\nletter?\nJUSTICE ALITO: If this is not willful\nblindness, I don't know what willful blindness is. Now,\nmaybe you can explain what more would have been required\nto permit a reasonable jury to find willful blindness.\nMR. DUNNEGAN: Okay. I think you'd need two\nthings, Your Honor. The first that you would need is\nevidence that they were going to bump into a patent if\nthey -- if they proceeded. Is there the high\nprobability of finding a patent?\nNow, if you -- if you just consciously avoid\nknowledge in the absence of a high probability, that's\nnot willful blindness. That's not even culpable.\nJUSTICE ALITO: But your client -- I don't\nknow whether you're using your time most effectively by\narguing this point, but your client thought that making\na deep fryer that wouldn't burn people's hands if they\ntouched it would be profitable, because there wasn't a\nlot of competition in that market. This was a useful\nproduct and apparently one that was different from other\ndeep fryers. Isn't that in itself -- doesn't that in\nitself suggest, gee, there might be a patent on -- on\nthis?\nMR. DUNNEGAN: No, I -- well, is there -\nJUSTICE ALITO: One company is making this\nand it seems to be better than what the other companies\nare making; maybe it might be patented.\nMR. DUNNEGAN: Your Honor, the record is\nthat there were six or so deep fryers which were the\ncool-touch deep fryers which they -- which they used as\nreferences. SEB was not the only cool-touch deep fryer\nthat was available.\nNow, to turn back to the issue of whether or\nnot Grokster actually found that willful -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Before -- before you pass\nthat question, then why as in '607 did they pick the SEB\nfryer to reverse-engineer?\nMR. DUNNEGAN: They reverse -- they looked\nat all of them, Your Honor. They reverse-engineered all\nof them. If you look at -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And then they copied the\ndesign of the SEB.\nMR. DUNNEGAN: Actually, Your Honor, they\nimproved it. There's functional features that went\nbeyond and were better than what were in the SEB\nproduct. For example, they used better metal to make\nthe cast iron pan. They put the -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But there was a finding\nthat it was an infringement, that the Pentalpha fryer\ninfringed the SEB.\nMR. DUNNEGAN: The jury did find that, Your\nHonor.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Dunnegan, could I take\nyou to the standard? Because in Aro II we said that the\nappropriate standard in subsection (c) was actual\nknowledge. Why shouldn't we just say it's the same?\nWhether it is (b) or (c), these are just two means of -\nof doing a contributory infringement, and the\nknowledge/willful blindness standard, once we've said it\napplies to (c), it applies to (b) as well?\nMR. DUNNEGAN: The reason that you shouldn't\ntake the standard from (c) is because (c) deals with\nnonstaples and (b) deals with staples. Someone can be\nliable under (b) if they -- if they sell a staple\narticle of commerce, when they can't be libel under (c),\neven if they meet -- even if they meet the higher -\neven they meet the state of mind element under (c),\nwhich is knowing the patent and knowing that the\ncombination would be an infringement. Therefore, to\nmake sure that (b) does not swallow (c), it's very\nimportant that (b) have a higher state of mind.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: No, (b) and (c) have\ndifferent standards as to -- not the knowledge of the\npatent but -- but what the person is -- the acts that\nconstitute infringement. But that's a different thing\nfrom whether they should have different standards as to\nthe knowledge of the patent.\nMR. DUNNEGAN: Well, when you say there's\ndifferent standards, the sale of an -- of a staple\narticle under (b) in itself with a proper state of mind\ncan be an inducement. The sale of a nonstaple article\nwith certain additional conditions can be a violation of\n(c). The action element for (b) and (c) is -- is\nessentially the same for the sale of components, and it\nwouldn't make any sense to raise it for (b) because all\nyou would be doing in that situation is -- is\nencompassing sellers that were helping their customers\ndo business more effectively, and you wouldn't be\ngetting any more bad guys.\nThe purpose of (b) is let's get the morally\nculpable actors. Now -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I had thought that you\nwanted us to take the knowing standard in (c) and apply\nit to (b).\nMR. DUNNEGAN: No, Your Honor, I -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Correct me if I'm wrong.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No, more than that.\nMR. DUNNEGAN: I would think you have to go\nwith the Grokster standard, Your Honor. And the reason\nfor that is, one, in Grokster you found what the state\nof mind standard was for inducing infringement under\n(b), and you moved that into the copyright law. Then,\nunder the -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: But, Mr. Dunnegan, in\nGrokster, there was no question as to whether they knew\nthat the -- that the things were copyrighted.\nMR. DUNNEGAN: That was conceded in that\ncase, Your Honor. Yes.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: So why is Grokster relevant\nhere? They conceded the very thing that we're arguing\nover.\nMR. DUNNEGAN: Well, it's -- it's -- it's\nrelevant because it deals with the standard what is -\nwhat is the state of mind element for inducing copyright\ninfringement.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And you say it's\npurposeful, culpable.\nMR. DUNNEGAN: Purposeful, culpable conduct\n-- yes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And why is that -\nhow is that different from knowing? I -- I -- my\nimpression was the same as Justice Kennedy's. I thought\nyou wanted the knowing standard.\nMR. DUNNEGAN: Knowing, well -- the way I\nunderstand knowing, Your Honor, is that in Sony, for\nexample, there was no liability even though Sony knew\nthat some people were going to use the VCR to infringe\ncopyrighted works. That was collateral damage even\nthough they knew it; it wasn't the basis for liability.\nIn Grokster, the basis for liability was\neven though the defendant knew that there were going to\nbe some infringements, it couldn't be liable for\ncontributory copyright infringement, the equivalent of\n271(c), because there was substantial noninfringing uses\nfor the Grokster software. Grokster was -- was allowed\nto be found liable because the defendants had a -- a\nculpable objective -- they had a culpable purpose, or at\nleast a jury could so find, that they wanted to\nencourage infringements.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm -- I'm a little\nconfused. If you knew that there was a patent under\n(b), and you still gave the fryer -- patented the fryer\nthat you know it is a patented fryer to Montgomery Ward\nor Sunbeam to sell, you're not liable under (b), because\nwhy? What act of yours was not purposeful?\nMR. DUNNEGAN: Your Honor, I believe the\nfirst sentence of your question was if you knew that\nthere was a patent. Is that a hypothetical?\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Yes.\nMR. DUNNEGAN: Okay. If we knew that there\nwas a patent and we knew the claims of the patent and we\nread them and we -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, we'll go as to -\nlet's -- let's just stop there. Justice Kennedy and I\nbelieve the Chief have asked you, isn't your entire\nargument that we should move the knowing knowledge of\n(c) into (b)? And you said no.\nMR. DUNNEGAN: No.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Explain to me -\nMR. DUNNEGAN: Because it should be -- it\nshould be higher. It should be the Grokster standard of\npurposeful, culpable conduct. And -- me the reason for\nthat -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, then explain to\nme -\nMR. DUNNEGAN: Okay.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- what's not purposeful\nor knowing -- what's not purposeful, culpable conduct,\nif you know there's a patent or -- you can decide\nwhether knowledge includes willful blindness or not, but\nit's not my issue. If you know there's a patent and you\ngive the product to someone else to sell, how can you\nnot be culpable for it?\nMR. DUNNEGAN: Because, Your Honor, if -\nyou could or you could not be, depending on what your\npurpose is with respect to infringement. If you had a\nlegal opinion which told you that the sale of that\nproduct would not infringe the patent, then you wouldn't\nhave a purposeful -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So you're introducing a\nmistake of law defense to knowledge. You're saying, I\nreally didn't know that it was unlawful. I knew that\nthere was a patent, but I really thought that it wasn't\na legal patent, so I was going to violate what I know\nwasn't legal. Is that what you're saying?\nMR. DUNNEGAN: Well, not exactly, Your\nHonor, because if you're reaching the conclusion that\nthe product is not within the scope of the claims of the\npatent, I don't think that's law. That's fact. The\nreason it's not law is that -- it couldn't be repealed.\nIt's -- you can't pass a law abrogating a patent.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, you're\ntalking -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Why do you get off the\nhook for making a mistake of law?\nMR. DUNNEGAN: A mistake of law -- generally\nyou don't get off the hook. What we have here is a\nmistake of fact concerning the scope of the claim of the\npatent. Now, granted, under -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You would never have any\npatents enforced under your theory.\nMR. DUNNEGAN: Yes, we would, Your Honor.\nLet's take the situation that there was a prior\nadjudication that the direct infringer was directly\ninfringing. Let's take the situation where there's\ngoing to be advertising which references the patents, as\nthere was in Grokster and says go infringe it. Let's\ntake the situation where there's internal documents at\nthe company suggesting that there is a purpose to\ninfringe, as there was in Grokster.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But if you're -- I'm\nsorry. I do not want to interfere with your time.\nMR. DUNNEGAN: No, Your Honor. Please.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'll wait.\nMR. DUNNEGAN: If the Court has no further\nquestions, I would like to reserve my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Cruz.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF R. TED CRUZ\nON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT\nMR. CRUZ: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nWhatever test that this Court adopts for\ninducing infringement, the central objective of that\ntest will be to separate culpable bad actors from\ninnocent corporate behavior actors. And by any measure,\nPentalpha in this case was a culpable bad actor. In\nfact, we've got really extraordinary testimony in this\ncase -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: So would you have any\nobjection to an actual knowledge willful blindness\nstandard? Would that be all right with you?\nMR. CRUZ: I think that is one of multiple\nstandards this Court could adopt if this Court were to\nadopt actual knowledge. I do not think actual knowledge\nis in the statute, but if this Court were to adopt\nactual knowledge and conclude also that willful\nblindness is a long-recognized means of demonstrating\nactual knowledge, that would support the judgment.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: I take it that we would do\nthat on the basis of Aro II? We would just say that's\nthe standard for (c) and that should be the statement\nfor (b)?\nMR. CRUZ: Respectfully, Justice Kagan, I\ndon't think that would be an interpretation that is\nfaithful to the text of 271. There is an enormous\ndifference between 271(c) and 271(b). 271(c) includes\nthe word knowing. 271(b) does not include the word\nknowing and your question assumes essentially -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Well, 271(c) includes the\nword knowing, you have to know that an item has no\nnoninfringing uses. That is a different kind of\nknowledge than the knowledge that we are talking about\nhere.\nMR. CRUZ: Respectfully, in Aro II what the\nCourt did and it was, as you know, a splintered majority\nin Aro II where the dissenters flipped back and forth,\nbut with the particular paragraph that addressed the\nholding on what had to be demonstrated, the Court\nconcluded that that word knowing effectively modified\nboth the knowledge that the nonstaple article had no\nnoninfringing use and, and that it would cause the\ninfringement. That is how the Court read knowing, as\nmodifying everything that follows it in 271(c).\nJUSTICE KAGAN: And because of the\ninfringement, but not necessarily that there was a\npatent, not necessarily the legal effect as opposed to\nthe act.\nMR. CRUZ: Well, that is necessarily part of\nwhat the Court held in 271(c). And I would agree, this\nwould be a very, very different case if 271(b) had the\nword knowing. I mean Aro in many ways was a much easier\ncase, but the question is do you have to demonstrate\nthat something is knowing and the statute says it must\nbe knowing, then that is -\nJUSTICE BREYER: How do you say, I am not\ncertain that willful blindness would support the\nconclusion below. The standard, the district court or\nthe trial court said really, negligence, as I read it.\nThe circuit said deliberate disregard of a known risk.\nWell, how much of a risk? I mean, the business world\nthere is always a risk and we are talking about a\ncomplicated world, probably quite a lot of risk. And so\nI think that standard would create a great deal of\nuncertainty. Willful blindness has a tradition. So are\nyou okay with willful blindness and we say we are afraid\nthey did not do it, i.e., we are afraid, we do not know\nwhat they really meant here and so send it back and do\nit again. I am sure you wouldn't be overjoyed. But do\nyou think that would be a reasonable result?\nMR. CRUZ: I think if the conclusion were to\nsend it back and do it again, I don't think that would\nbe a reasonable result.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What are you supposed to\nsay known risk, sure he says he looked at five. And he\nsays anybody can figure this thing out, all you do is\nput the little gizmos between the two sides, you know,\nand you have an inside and outside and you just suspend\nthe inside with little bars of some kind. I do not know\nwhat, chewing gum or something, and he says anybody\ncould figure that out, it couldn't possibly be bad. And\nso that is their view, but how much of a risk, they will\nsay little risk, big risk. So you see why I think we\nshould send it back. Now you tell me why that is not -\nMR. CRUZ: That is what they argued to the\njury and that's -\nJUSTICE BREYER: I am not saying they are\nright in that, I bet they would lose. But my problem is\ndo I accept the words deliberate disregard of the known\nrisk or do I say the more traditional accompaniment to\nknowledge is willful blindness, which for all its\nobscurity, at least has a history.\nMR. CRUZ: The jury heard those arguments,\nthe jury rejected those arguments. The argument that\nwas presented to the jury, although the precise words\nwillful blindness weren't used, the argument that was\npresented to the jury was willful blindness argument.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How was the jury\ninstructed?\nMR. CRUZ: What the jury was instructed was\nseveral things and the jury instructions are at RA 26\nand 27. The jury instruction that was used, by the way,\nwas the model jury instruction that has been used since\n1998, has been unchanged and has included largely this\nlanguage since 1998 over and over again. That is the\njury instruction we are dealing with.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I am still waiting\nto hear what it was?\nMR. CRUZ: It is a complicated instruction,\nso part of what -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I thought\nthere was some question about that it was so low that it\nin effect amounted to a negligence standard.\nMR. CRUZ: That is part of the argument\nPentalpha presents. I don't believe that is accurate.\nNumber one, the jury was instructed that plaintiff had\nto prove by preponderance of the evidence that defendant\nactively and knowingly aided and abetting the direct\ninfringement. That is part of the instruction. That\nthey actively and knowingly.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Where are you reading\nfrom, Mr. Cruz?\nMR. CRUZ: RA 26 and 27. It is the end of\nthe red brief.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I don't think that is the\npart they are complaining about.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: It is in the red brief,\nthe Respondent's brief, page 26, toward the bottom it\nsays if you find, I have a problem that I do not know\nthat they preserved this objection, but let's talk about\nwhat the standard ought to be. At the bottom it says,\nif you find that the someone has directly infringed a\npatent and that the defendants knew or should have known\nthat its actions would induce direct infringement. So\nthis means to me that in order to be liable for an\ninducement you can be liable if you knew or should have\nknown. Now, if we can just discuss this for a moment.\nIt seems to me that this is the important point in the\ncase because if you say should have known, then you have\na standard that is less than intentional for inducers.\nAnd that means that every supplier, every business\nperson that takes a product from a manufacturer has the\nduty to inquire and to find out if there is a patent.\nAnd it is a standard that is less than intentional and\nthat is a very substantial change or a very substantial\nburden to impose on those who are selling and\ndistributing products.\nMR. CRUZ: Justice Kennedy, I don't believe\nthat is correct. Number one, we are certainly not\nadvocating a general burden on all producers to do a\npatent search. That is not remotely the position we are\npresenting.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, if you say should\nhave known, that is the necessary consequence of the\nholding.\nMR. CRUZ: What I would suggest the import\nof that language is, is to allow constructive knowledge.\nIs to allow essentially willful blindness, which was the\nentire way it was argued to the jury.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, as you say, willful\nblindness was never used really until this Court and\nthis Court has never in a full opinion for the Court\nadopted it even in the criminal context. So can we talk\nabout knowing as opposed to should have known.\nMR. CRUZ: The argument that was presented\nto the jury, in closing what trial counsel said and this\nis the trial transcript, page 929 through 31, which is\nnot in one of the appendixes in front of you. I\napologize for that. But what the transcript says is\nthat Mr. Sham, the CEO, never told his patent lawyer,\nlook, what we are doing is copying this SEB product.\nWhat he did, I suggest to you, is he set Mr. Levy up to\nfail. He set him up to fail by not telling him he had\ncopied the product. That was the theory that was argued\nas to why they should have known, because this was in\neffect a sham, that not telling the lawyer about the\nproduct, it wasn't an accident.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But you're presenting to\nus the proposition, I take it, correct me if I am wrong,\nthat we should write an opinion that is saying that know\nor should have known is the standard for an inducer.\nAnd I question whether that is a wise interpretation and\na necessary interpretation of (b), especially as we are\ninformed through (c) as to what (b) might mean.\nMR. CRUZ: Justice Kennedy, we are not\nproposing that, and I would say two things. Number one,\nthere is an entire instruction on inducement and there\nis also the language I read before that is part of the\njury charge on inducement. And I don't think the jury\ncan be presumed to have only listened to one snippet of\nthe instruction without the entire instruction.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: If we are arguing about\nwhether or not you can protect your judgement based upon\nall that's in the record, I think you may have a strong\npoint. But I am interested in what the standard ought\nto be. I'd like you to know what a properly instructed\njury should be told with reference to knowledge or\nsomething less than knowledge.\nMR. CRUZ: I would suggest with respect to\nthe language knew or should have known, that if there is\nnot an actual knowledge requirement, which in my\njudgment is nowhere in the statute, then you have to\nhave something like should have known because I do not\nknow what you alternative instruct. If it is not actual\nknowledge then there is a situation where someone is\nallowed to have constructive knowledge.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So you're saying that (b)\nshould have a lesser standard of culpability than (c)?\nMR. CRUZ: Absolutely. I don't think the\nstatute makes any sense unless (b) is understood to have\na lesser standard. Otherwise, the inclusion of the word\n\"knowing\" is given no effect.\nJUSTICE BREYER: The difference, they say,\nbetween (b) and (c) is that (c) applies to a person who\nmakes some really special thing that looks like a\nJapanese kabuki theater costume, and it's actually made\nout of metal and it's really -- has a very bizarre\nthing, and it is only used -- good use is to do this\ninfringing thing.\nBut (b) could apply to somebody who makes\nplastic shields. (B) can apply that -- (b) could apply\nto anybody who makes anything; is that right?\nMR. CRUZ: Justice Breyer, under that\nargument, the statute would be interpreted identically\nif the word \"knowing\" were added to (b). And given that\nthey added it to (c) and not to (b) -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, the argument is that\nthe words \"actively induced\" are meant to be something\ngreater than knowing, not something less than knowing.\nBecause otherwise, you're going to hold Aluminum Company\nof America, if that still exists, liable when it makes\nthese aluminum sheets, because somebody uses an aluminum\nsheet apparently, et cetera. You see the problem.\nIt is quite different when you make this\nweird kabuki-looking thing that only has one use,\nand they -- and that's why it should be -- it should be\nharder to hold that person to contributory infringement,\nnot easier.\nNow, that's their argument. What do you\nsay.\nMR. CRUZ: Justice Breyer, that -- that may\nbe a reasonable policy argument. However, that is also\na reasonable policy argument for modifying A, because\nright now, the aluminum company is liable under strict\nliability for direct infringement today.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I'd like to get, really, an\nanswer from you on Justice Kennedy's question, because\nat the moment I am not worried about your case. You, of\ncourse, are. I understand that.\nBut the -- I am worried about Alcoa or the\nlittle backyard maker of clay pots, or -- I mean,\nmillions and millions of people make things that are\nused in millions and millions of ways. And I am worried\nabout what kind of burden we are supposed to impose on\nthem.\nI see three candidates. One is, you're\nliable if you should have known. Two is, you're liable\nif you consciously disregarded a -- a risk, a known\nrisk; that is sort of like a -- you know, the Model\nPenal Code, sort of. And third is willful blindness.\nIs there a fourth? And if there is not,\nwhat do you choose among those three? No, not what you\nchoose. What should we choose?\nMR. CRUZ: We have suggested three possible\nstandards to be the rule in this case. The first, the\nCourt could choose to adopt the standard that was\nadopted in Grokster, and we have argued at considerable\nlength that under the standard this Court adopted in\nGrokster, the plaintiffs -- the defendants, rather,\nwould be liable and it would uphold the judgment below.\nThat is the broadest standard the Court could adopt.\nA more narrow standard the Court could adopt\nis that at a minimum, willful blindness of the patented\nissue suffices to allow inducement liability. That is a\nmore narrow standard. It would cover a much narrower\nuniverse of conduct. It would exclude much of the\nconduct both Justice Breyer and Justice Kennedy are\nsuggesting. That is the second way this judgment could\nbe affirmed and a more narrow rule.\nThe most narrow rule we have suggested this\nCourt could adopt is in the limited circumstances when a\ndefendant deliberately copies another commercial\nproduct, at a minimum, that defendant has an obligation\nto ascertain if that specific product has protected U.S.\nintellectual property, that it is a very minor\nobligation that is triggered only when you take a\ncommercial product on the marketplace, reverse-engineer\nit, and copy it, because it is a situation that is\nhighly likely to be indicative of bad conduct, to be\nrisking a very substantial infringement of someone\nelse's IP, and in terms of a low-cost avoider, one of\nthe things at footnote 20 of our brief -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Wait. Before you go -\nbefore you go further, what if you do that, okay? And\nyou get an opinion from a lawyer, as they did here,\nsaying you're not violating any copyright or any -- any\npatent?\nMR. CRUZ: If they had said three words\ndifferently, this would be a very, very different case.\nIf they had simply, in talking to their lawyer, said:\nWe copied SEB.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. You have to tell the\nsearcher that you copied.\nMR. CRUZ: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That is part of your test,\nright?\nMR. CRUZ: If you specifically copy a\nproduct, you have to look to see if that particular\nproduct is protected by IP.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So is that -- is that\nanother standard? Maybe that is an example of what it\nis to be willfully blind. If, in fact, you go out and\nyou copy something, it could well be patented, and you\ndo not tell your lawyer, go look up this one, that is\nwillfully blind.\nMR. CRUZ: Well, and -- and that -\nJUSTICE BREYER: That is why you say they\nare the same. I don't want to put words in your mouth.\nMR. CRUZ: Well, the Court could certainly\ncraft the rule at least narrowly tailored to the facts\nhere, which is copying. And look, copying is not a\nunique problem. It is a serious problem\ninternationally, with U.S. intellectual property being\nstolen, copied, and marketed. And if Pentalpha were to\nprevail, if this Court were to conclude unless you had\nactual knowledge, you know to a hundred percent\ncertainty, this violates patent '312, you're immune from\nliability, that decision of this Court would serve as a\nroadmap.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: You're not immune from\nliability for direct infringement. You're immune from\nliability, under the hypothetical, for actively\ninducing. And that is where there is a very substantial\npolicy difference.\nMS. BLATT: But, Justice Kennedy, the reason\nin this case why we brought a cause of action for both\ndirect infringement and active inducing is because the\nargument of Pentalpha was their conduct was all\noverseas, and so they weren't covered by 271(a). The\nentire reason for the inducing strategy is they may well\nprevail in another case on saying, we stole your\nproperty overseas so you can't get us for direct\ninfringement. And in that instance, inducing is the\nonly way to get the actual mastermind. I mean, that was\none of the phrases Giles Rich used in defense of 271.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So are you saying that the\nstandard of knowledge would be the same for direct\ninfringement as for active inducement?\nMR. CRUZ: I think there is a reasonable\nstatutory argument to be made that it is the same,\nnamely, that it is strict liability. We are not\npressing that as the only way to prevail, but I think\nthere is certainly a reasonable statutory argument.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I am a little\nconfused about the relationship between knowledge and\nthe Grokster standard. You think knowledge is a more\nfavorable standard for Petitioner than Grokster. You're\nwilling to accept Grokster, but not willing to accept\nactual knowledge.\nMR. CRUZ: I do, and I will tell you why.\nBecause -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, before you\ntell me why, do you understand -- it's unfair to ask\nyou, I guess, but I understood Petitioner to take the\nopposite position: That Grokster was a more favorable\nstandard for him than actual knowledge.\nMR. CRUZ: I agree with you that is what\nPetitioner said here. My understanding of Petitioner's\nposition was the same as yours, Mr. Chief Justice and\nJustice Kennedy, that they are effectively requiring\nactual knowledge, that that's what their urging is.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Why aren't you both wrong,\nthat Grokster didn't deal with the question that we are\ndealing with, which was knowledge of a patent or\nknowledge of a copyright, that Grokster dealt with\nwhether there was specific intent or whether there\nneeded to be specific intent to encourage infringing\nacts. That is what Grokster was about, an entirely\nseparate question.\nMR. CRUZ: Let me answer both your question,\nJustice Kagan, and the Chief Justice's question\ntogether.\nGrokster used language about purposeful\nculpable conduct, but it went further. It specified how\nyou ascertain whether that standard is met, and it said\nas shown by other affirmative acts to encourage\ninducement. Now, in Grokster, part of the argument\nGrokster made was, we do not know what copyrights are\ngoing to be violated. We do not know what is going to\nbe -- they made the same argument Pentalpha is making:\nWe have no idea of any specific copyright that will ever\nbe infringed. They argued, we do not have actual\nknowledge of the specific copyrights. And this Court\nsaid: That doesn't matter.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, one of the -- one of\nthe briefs -- one of the amicus briefs in this case\npoints out that that argument is a lot less plausible in\ncopyright than it is in -- in patents. It is very easy\nto find out whether you're infringing a copyright. It\nis very difficult to find out whether you're infringing\na patent, especially in the modern age of warehouse\npatents. I am not sure that we -- that we want to use\nthe same test for copyrights that we use for -- for\npatents.\nMR. CRUZ: That policy differential -- there\nmay well be differences between patent law and copyright\nlaw that are implicated in other cases. Here, what\noccurred is an entire commercial product was copied. It\nis much more akin to copyright infringement, where the\nentire product was copied and they just changed the\ncosmetic features.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that's fine. I am\njust -- I am just expressing reservations about your\nsuggestion that we simply take Grokster wholesale and\napply it to this situation.\nMR. CRUZ: Let me be -- let me be clear,\nJustice Scalia. I am not advocating this Court do so.\nWhat I am saying is if this Court were to apply the\nGrokster test, we believe we prevail under it, and in\nfact any comparison of Grokster to Pentalpha, Pentalpha\nis clearly the more culpable actor. In Grokster, the\nindividuals violating the copyrights were the ones who\nmade the choice to directly and deliberately violate the\ncopyrights and Grokster simply provided the tool to do\nso. Here the only bad actor was Pentalpha. Sunbeam,\nMontgomery Ward, they had no idea of the infringement.\nPentalpha was the mastermind behind the entire patent\nviolation, and in fact because of its actions procuring\na right to use opinion, by keeping the relevant\ninformation from its patent lawyer, it lured, it induced\nSunbeam and Montgomery Ward and Fingerhut into\ncommitting the bad act.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Would you say, even though\nyou -- I think you disagree with this in this case,\nwould you say that there is a reasonable argument in our\nprecedent for saying that the standard of knowledge\nunder (b) should be greater than reckless disregard?\nMR. CRUZ: I do not believe there is in the\nprecedent. For one thing, reckless disregard is the\nstandard now. Willfulness and recklessness are the\nstandard right now for enhanced damages and attorney's\nfees; and if it were the case that every violation of\n271(b) required willfulness or recklessness, it would\nalso mean that every violation would qualify for\nenhanced damages or attorney's fees. I don't think\nthat's consistent with the statutory standard. That's\nnot the language Congress adopted.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: All right. Would you say\nthat there is substantial authority for the proposition\nthat it should -- the state of mind should be greater\nthan \"should have known\"?\nMR. CRUZ: You know, I do not believe there\nis. Particularly how \"should have known\" was used in\nthis case, A, the jury was -- the way the jury was\ninstructed, I would suggest it was effectively a\nconstructive knowledge instruction.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: They're dealing -\nMR. CRUZ: If you look at -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: They're dealing with a\nFederal Circuit decision, they're reviewing that\ndecision, the Federal Circuit had a formula. It said\nstandard is deliberate disregard of a known risk. One\nthing you must surely do is to say whether that standard\nis right or wrong.\nSo the Federal Circuit, whatever the jury\nfound, Federal Circuit said the law is that you are\nliable under 271(b) if you are deliberately -- if you\ndeliberately disregard a known risk. Is that standard\nthe right one?\nMR. CRUZ: I agree the Federal Circuit had\nthat language. I would not suggest that standard was\nthe wrong standard, but what I would say, what the\nFederal Circuit in fact did is it applied willful\nblindness. If you look at the cases it cited, if you\nlook at how it in fact interpreted it, although it used\nthe deliberate indifference language, which I will\nconcede was somewhat confusing in its reasoning. If you\nlook at it, it framed it as whether Pentalpha had\nconstructive knowledge of the patent, and it then cited\nwillful blindness cases from other circuits that focused\nit on actively disregarding a known risk and deliberate\navoidance and consciously avoided knowledge. All of\nthat is willful blindness knowledge.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Mr. Cruz, while we are\ncertainly interested in what the standard should be.\nBut in terms of the deposition of this case, maybe you\ncould help me with this. The -- the instruction to\nwhich there was an objection on, 124A to -- well,\nwherever it is in the joint appendix -- was the newer\nshould have known, right?\nMR. CRUZ: Correct.\nJUSTICE ALITO: And the objection that I see\nwas that the words \"or should have known that their\nactions\" -- this is 135A of the joint appendix -- should\nhave been stricken. So am I right that the only issue\nthat was preserved is the question whether actual\nknowledge was required? Because that was the only -\nthat was what -- that was the error, the alleged error\nthat was identified by Mr. Dunnegan.\nMR. CRUZ: I agree with that entirely.\nJUSTICE ALITO: So if he is wrong on that,\nthen the judgment should be affirmed.\nMR. CRUZ: I agree with that entirely, and\nindeed we have suggested the central issue, the question\nbefore this Court is, is there a requirement of actual\nknowledge of the specific patent? And in my judgment\nthere is no reasonable argument from the statutory\nlanguage that in order to be liable under 271(b) you\nmust specifically know to 100 percent certainty this is\nviolating patent number 312. That is the issue they\nobjected. That is the issue that has been brought\nbefore this Court. Is -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- do so, because we\nstill have to define knowledge. If we accept that\nactual knowledge can have a different definition, just\nnot the should have known definition -\nMR. CRUZ: Well -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Do we have to define\nwhat knowledge -- what kind of knowledge we are talking\nabout?\nMR. CRUZ: If it is a case that you must\nspecifically know the specific patent, it will ensure\nthat unscrupulous -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I agree. We can say\nthat. But how does it help -\nMR. CRUZ: Well -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- the development of\nlaw for us to simply say you -- it is not so much\nknowledge that you have to know the specific patent by\nnumber.\nMR. CRUZ: I am going to suggest it is a\nbinary choice. It is either actual specific knowledge\nof the patent, or it is some form of \"should have known\"\nthat allows constructive knowledge.\nJUSTICE BREYER: That is where I am. At the\nmoment, the should have known or willful blindness, the\ndisregard -- the problem, and it seems like a real\nproblem, is know what, exactly? Well, know there is a\nrisk. Well, at that point half the country in the\nbusiness world is very upset because there is always a\nrisk.\nMR. CRUZ: But, Justice Breyer -\nJUSTICE BREYER: And the other problem is if\nyou -- as you move away from that and say, no, no, I\nmean a real risk -- I mean a huge risk -- I mean a risk\nthat in fact, you almost knew that this was it -- now I\ncan do it with my tone of voice, but I need the words to\nput in there that are going to calm people's fears that\nthey are not suddenly going to be held liable because\nthere is some fairly small risk of this. So what words\nwould I use?\nMR. CRUZ: In this case, you had unusual -\nJUSTICE BREYER: I know this case; I am not\nworried about. I am worried about what I said.\nMR. CRUZ: Well, let me suggest what words\nyou could use to resolve this case. Because -\nJUSTICE BREYER: I do not want to just\nresolve the case.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: The reason we took the case\nis because there seemed a bunch of standards floating\naround. Now I know our interests differ in this matter,\nbut I would appreciate any help you can give me about\nwhat I am thinking now is words that will quantify the\nrisk that you had to have known about, a risk; so that\nit doesn't look like some small thing that is always\nthere that looks like some giant thing that is pretty\nclose to actually -\nMR. CRUZ: The language that -- that was\nused in Santos was that willful blindness is that when a\nparty aware of a high probability of a fact deliberately\navoids learning the truth.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, I've heard about\nthat.\nMR. CRUZ: That language would encompass\nthis case -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes, it would.\nMR. CRUZ: And it would not bring in\ninnocent actors.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- my problem, is a high\nprobability that. You have to be -- you have to\nconsciously, that is the model penal code, that is the\n-- you know, torts -- you have to consciously disregard\na high probability that this item was patented and also\nmeet the other requirements that are part of active\ninducement. That is what your thought is?\nMR. CRUZ: I think that would be an\nacceptable test this Court could -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: A high probability\nof what? A high probability that you will infringe\nthis -- a patent or any patent?\nMR. CRUZ: A -- with respect to what was\nhappening here, when you copy a commercial product,\nthere is a high probability that product is protected by\na patent, and when you engage in what the district court\ncharacterized -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: He is not interested in\nwhat happened here. I mean, we are still talking about\na general test.\nMR. CRUZ: I -- what I would suggest and\nthat is one of the reasons we proffered the narrow test\nthat is keyed on copying, because copying of completed\ncommercial products is the most egregious. If the Court\nis concerned about unintended consequences, that narrow\nrule is the most narrow rule. Let -- if I could briefly\nsuggest -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Forget the narrow rule.\nWhat do you think the rule should be to articulate what\nJustice Breyer would like?\nMR. CRUZ: With respect, my client doesn't\ncare -\n(Laughter.)\nMR. CRUZ: -- as long as the result is at\nthe end, the opinion is affirmed.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I know your client doesn't\ncare. But still we have to write this. So what about\nthe answer?\nTo follow it up a little bit, it is\nknowledge -- you're familiar with these areas, so you're\nhelpful, and -- and it is a knowledge or a known -- or\nconsciously disregarding a known risk where the risk\nconsists of a high probability that that item that you\nare inducing to be produced will infringe a patent.\nMR. CRUZ: I agree that would suffice.\nWith respect to why this Court should not\nremand, if I may very briefly make three points. Number\none, this case has been going on for 12 years. To\nremand for a new trial would drag it on to more endless\nlitigation for no purpose. The district court observed\nbelow this case was not a close case. It took the jury\n109 minutes to resolve against Pentalpha on every single\nground that was presented to it.\nNumber two, the jury charge that was sent to\nthe jury was more than sufficient under any of these\nstandards. But number three, the alternative argument\nwe made, there was a finding of direct infringement.\nThat finding of direct infringement is also supported by\nthe damage award and that is an alternative ground to\nremand it. Now, in the reply brief Pentalpha says,\nfocuses on the same differential that the Federal\nCircuit did between the language of the jury charge and\nthe language of the verdict form, but the only evidence\nthe jury had of the number of units sold by anybody was\nthe stipulation. In their reply brief they say, well,\nthere could have been some sold in Canada. That was\nlawyer argument. The only evidence, which everyone\nagreed, was the stipulation and if that is true that\nsupports the damage award.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Cruz.\nMr. Dunnegan, you have four minutes\nremaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM DUNNEGAN\nON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS\nMR. DUNNEGAN: Five points in rebuttal, I\nbelieve, Your Honor. The first is what should the\nstandard be with respect to willful blindness. And I do\nwant to call the court's attention to one sentence in\nGrokster appearing at page 941 of the opinion. And it\nprovides, this is worth reading, I believe. If\nliability for inducing infringement is ultimately found,\nit will not be on the basis of presuming or imputing\nliability, excuse me, fault, but from inferring a\npatently illegal objective from statements and actions\nshowing what that objective was.\nNow, in the context of an amicus brief from\nthe solicitor general in that case suggesting a willful\nblindness standard, it seems to me that that language is\na rejection of imputing a willful blindness standard.\nJUSTICE ALITO: So you want actual knowledge\nof the patent? That is your test?\nMR. DUNNEGAN: The test that we are looking\nfor is the Grokster test. Is there purposeful, culpable\nconduct.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Do you want actual knowledge\nof the patent?\nMR. DUNNEGAN: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE ALITO: And that is the issue you\npreserved with your objection?\nMR. DUNNEGAN: Not precisely. We preserved\nother issues beyond that. We preserved both the jury\ncharge by objecting at 135A of the joint appendix and we\nobjected to the judgment as a matter of law motion by\nmaking it and saying specifically there is no evidence\nhere that there was actual knowledge of the patent\nbefore April 9th of 1998. Now -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And after that date you\nadmit you -- because you continued to sell the product\nto the retailers?\nMR. DUNNEGAN: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So after Sunbeam sued,\nthen you are actively inducing infringement?\nMR. DUNNEGAN: No, Your Honor. At that\npoint we have actual knowledge of the patent and the\nanalysis has to go to what was our purpose. For the\nbulk of that period of time, we had a legal opinion from\na very competent New York City lawyer stating that we\ndid not infringe. And the jury, I guess the second\npoint I was trying to make is the jury never evaluated\nany standard higher than new or -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought that opinion\nwas after the first finding of infringement, that you\nredesigned the product and that, the evidence you got\ndealt with the redesigned products.\nMR. DUNNEGAN: I believe your timing is\ncorrect, Your Honor. The -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But after just\noriginally, Sunbeam is suing for infringement. Sunbeam\nnotifies Pentalpha. At that point, Pentalpha is\ncontinuing to make sales. Is it infringing? Is it\nactively inducing infringement.\nMR. DUNNEGAN: That is a question of fact,\nYour Honor. The jury resolved it against us, but the\npoint I was trying to make is that for some period of\ntime after that we had a legal opinion saying we did not\ninfringe and we believe that legal opinion from the New\nYork City attorney would prevent or should prevent, as a\nmatter of fact, a finding of purposeful, culpable\nconduct. Now, the second standard I wanted to address\nwas -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You admitted there was\npurposeful, culpable conduct when you did not, when you\nhad the original design and that was, and you were sued\nfor actively inducing infringement of that design, by\nthat design.\nMR. DUNNEGAN: No, Your Honor. We would\nnever concede that we were purposefully -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But you think a jury\ncould have found that from the facts?\nMR. DUNNEGAN: Yes. We are not seeking\njudgment as a matter of law for any claims that arose\nafter April of 1998 when we had actual knowledge of the\npatent, only before we had actual knowledge of the\npatent are we seeking judgement as a matter of law.\nNow, going to the issue of whether willful blindness\ncould be found by the failure of someone to tell the\npatent attorney that there was a copying -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I am sorry. Why are you\ndoing that? I thought that you came in arguing that you\nhave to have actual knowledge of the patent.\nMR. DUNNEGAN: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: By number, and that was\nthe conversation we had earlier, and that the patent\ncovered the scope of your invention.\nMR. DUNNEGAN: Yes, Your Honor. That's our\nprimary argument, but if the court were to adopt willful\nblindness as being enough, then I would question whether\nor not simply not telling the patent attorney what\nreferences were used or even which ones were copied\nwould be enough. Because in that situation, the company\nhas taken an effort to find out what the truth is and it\nsimply failed to meet the gold standard in meeting that\nobligation.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
