        "content": "(10:07 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument\nfirst this morning in Case 10-1259, United States v.\nJones.\nMr. Dreeben.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. DREEBEN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nSince this Court's decision in Katz v.\nUnited States, the Court has recognized a basic\ndichotomy under the Fourth Amendment. What a person\nseeks to preserve as private in the enclave of his own\nhome or in a private letter or inside of his vehicle\nwhen he is traveling is a subject of Fourth Amendment\nprotection. But what he reveals to the world, such as\nhis movements in a car on a public roadway, is not.\nIn Knotts v. United States, this Court\napplied that principle to hold that visual and beeper\nsurveillance of a vehicle traveling on the public\nroadways infringed no Fourth Amendment expectation of\nprivacy.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Knotts, though,\nseems to me much more like traditional surveillance.\nYou're following the car, and the beeper just helps you\nfollow it from a -- from a slightly greater distance.\nThat was 30 years ago. The technology is very\ndifferent, and you get a lot more information from the\nGPS surveillance than you do from following a beeper.\nMR. DREEBEN: The technology is different,\nMr. Chief Justice, but a crucial fact in Knotts that\nshows that this was not simply amplified visual\nsurveillance is that the officers actually feared\ndetection in Knotts as the car crossed from Minnesota to\nWisconsin. The driver began to do certain U-turns and,\nthe police broke off visual surveillance. They lost\ntrack of the car for a full hour. They only were able\nto discover it by having a beeper receiver in a\nhelicopter that detected the beeps from the radio\ntransmitter in the can of chloroform.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But that's a good\nexample of the change in technology. That's a lot of\nwork to follow the car. They've got to listen to the\nbeeper; when they lose it, they've got to call in the\nhelicopter. Here they just sit back in the station, and\nthey -- they push a button whenever they want to find\nout where the car is. They look at data from a month\nand find out everywhere it's been in the past month.\nThat -- that seems to me dramatically different.\nMR. DREEBEN: But it doesn't expose\nanything, Mr. Chief Justice, that isn't already exposed\nto public view for anyone who wanted to watch, and that\nwas the crucial principle that the Court applied --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, under that\nrationale, could you put a beeper surreptitiously on the\nman's overcoat or sport coat?\nMR. DREEBEN: Probably not, Justice Kennedy;\nand the reason is that this Court in Karo v. United\nStates -- United States v. Karo -- specifically\ndistinguished the possibility of following a car on a\npublic roadways from determining the location of an\nobject in a place where a person has a reasonable\nexpectation of privacy.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Oh, no. This is a special\ndevice. It measures only streets and public elevators\nand public buildings.\nMR. DREEBEN: In that event, Justice\nKennedy, there is a serious question about whether the\ninstallation of such a device would implicate either a\nsearch or a seizure. But if it did not, the public\nmovements of somebody do not implicate a seizure.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well -- and on that latter\npoint, you might just be aware that I have serious\nreservations that there wasn't -- that there -- about\nthe way in which this beeper was installed. But you can\nget to that at -- at your convenience.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Dreeben, I'd like to\nget to it now.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. DREEBEN: Happy to, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I have to give a little\nprologue to my question. When -- when wiretapping first\ncame before this Court, we held that it was not a\nviolation of the Fourth Amendment because the Fourth\nAmendment says that the -- the people shall be secure in\ntheir persons, houses, papers, and effects against\nunreasonable searches and seizures. And wiretapping\njust picked up conversations. That's not persons,\nhouses, papers, and effects.\nLater on, we reversed ourselves, and, as you\nmentioned, Katz established the new criterion, which is,\nis there an invasion of privacy? Does -- are you\nobtaining information that a person had a reasonable\nexpectation to be kept private? I think that was wrong.\nI don't think that was the original meaning of the\nFourth Amendment. But, nonetheless, it's been around\nfor so long, we're not going to overrule that.\nHowever, it is one thing to add that privacy\nconcept to the Fourth Amendment as it originally\nexisted, and it is quite something else to use that\nconcept to narrow the Fourth Amendment from what it\noriginally meant. And it seems to me that when that\ndevice is installed against the will of the owner of the\ncar on the car, that is unquestionably a trespass and\nthereby rendering the owner of the car not secure in his\neffects -- the car is one of his effects -- against an\nunreasonable search and seizure. It is attached to the\ncar against his will, and it is a search because what it\nobtains is the location of that car from there forward.\nNow, why -- why isn't that correct? Do you deny that\nit's a trespass?\nMR. DREEBEN: It may be a technical\ntrespass, but it was equally a technical trespass in the\nUnited States v. Karo, when a can of ether was\ntransferred to somebody that had -- and it had a radio\ntransmitter --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but the owner of the\ncan at the time it was installed consented, and that is\nnot this case. There is no consent by the owner of the\nproperty to which this device was affixed. In fact, it\nwas done, as Justice Scalia indicated, surreptitiously.\nMR. DREEBEN: But there was no consent to\nthe owner of the can once he acquired it to have it\ncontain a foreign item installed by the government.\nAnd --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that's too bad. That\ndoesn't make it a trespass. I mean --\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, this Court thought that\nit --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It may be a sneaky thing to\ndo, but -- but every sneaky thing is not a trespass.\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, this Court thought that\nit was a technical trespass in Karo and said that made\nno difference because the purpose of the Fourth\nAmendment is to protect privacy interests and meaningful\ninterferences with possessory interests, not to cover\nall technical trespasses. And the case that I --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So, we've narrowed the\nFourth Amendment?\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, I think the Court --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So, the -- the privacy\nrationale doesn't expand it but narrows it in some\nrespects.\nMR. DREEBEN: It changes it, Justice Scalia.\nAnd I think the case that most clearly illustrates the\ndistinction between trespass and Fourth Amendment\nprotection is Oliver v. United States, the case that\nreaffirmed the open fields doctrine. In that case,\nthere was absolutely no doubt that the police committed\na trespass under local law. They entered, they crossed\nfences, they ignored big \"no trespassing\" signs; and\nthis Court held that the interests that are protected by\ntrespass law are distinct from the interests protected\nby the Fourth Amendment.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Undoubtedly, but the\nrationale of that case was that it was not an\nunreasonable --\nMR. DREEBEN: No, the rationale was that --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- it was not an\nunreasonable search.\nMR. DREEBEN: -- there was no search,\nJustice Scalia. The rationale of that case was that\nopen fields are not among the things that are protected\nby the Fourth Amendment. And the Court was very\nspecifically focused on the distinction between trespass\nlaw and Fourth Amendment law.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You think there\nwould also not be a search if you put a GPS device on\nall of our cars, monitored our movements for a month?\nYou think you're entitled to do that under your theory?\nMR. DREEBEN: The Justices of this Court?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. DREEBEN: Under our theory and under\nthis Court's cases, the Justices of this Court when\ndriving on public roadways have no greater expectation\nof --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, your answer is\nyes, you could tomorrow decide that you put a GPS device\non every one of our cars, follow us for a month; no\nproblem under the Constitution?\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, equally, Mr. Chief\nJustice, if the FBI wanted to, it could put a team of\nsurveillance agents around the clock on any individual\nand follow that individual's movements as they went\naround on the public streets, and they would thereby\ngather --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, that seems to get --\nto me to get to what's really involved here. The issue\nof whether there's a technical trespass or not is\npotentially a ground for deciding this particular case,\nbut it seems to me the heart of the problem that's\npresented by this case and will be presented by other\ncases involving new technology is that in the\npre-computer, pre-Internet age, much of the privacy -- I\nwould say most of the privacy -- that people enjoyed was\nnot the result of legal protections or constitutional\nprotections; it was the result simply of the difficulty\nof traveling around and gathering up information.\nBut with computers, it's now so simple to\namass an enormous amount of information about people\nthat consists of things that could have been observed on\nthe streets, information that was made available to the\npublic. If -- if this case is decided on the ground\nthat there was a technical trespass, I don't have much\ndoubt that in the near future, it will be possible -- I\nthink it's possible now in many instances -- for law\nenforcement to monitor people's movements on -- on\npublic streets without committing a technical trespass.\nSo, how do we deal with this? Do we just\nsay, well, nothing is changed, so that all the\ninformation that people expose to the public is -- is\nfair game? There's no -- there's no search or seizure\nwhen that is -- when that is obtained because there\nisn't a reasonable expectation of privacy, but isn't\nthere a real change in -- in this regard?\nMR. DREEBEN: I don't think, Justice Alito,\nthat there's a particularly dramatic change in this case\nfrom what went on in the Karo and the Knotts cases.\nIt is possible to envision broader advances\nin technology that would allow more public information\nto be amassed and put into computer systems. But I\nthink that the remedy for that -- if this Court agrees\nwith the principles in Knotts and Karo and applies them\nto this case, the remedy is through legislation, just as\nwhen the Court held that amassing pen register data, all\nof the numbers that you dial on your telephone, the\nlengths of the times of the calls. The Court was\nconfronted in that case with Justice Stewart's view in\ndissent, that --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: There was a third party\ninvolved in the telephone -- in the pen register case.\nAnd, here, it's the police. Essentially, I think you\nanswered the question that the government's position\nwould mean that any of us could be monitored whenever we\nleave our homes. So, the only thing secure is the home.\nIs -- I mean, that is -- that is the end point of your\nargument, that an electronic device, as long as it's not\nused inside the house, is okay.\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, we're talking here about\nmonitoring somebody's movements in public. We're not\ntalking about monitoring their conversations, their\ntelephone calls, the interior of their cars, their\nprivate letters or packages. So, there are enclaves of\nFourth Amendment protection that this Court has\nrecognized.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What -- what is the\nquestion that I think people are driving at, at least as\nI understand them and certainly share the concern, is\nthat if you win this case, then there is nothing to\nprevent the police or the government from monitoring 24\nhours a day the public movement of every citizen of the\nUnited States. And -- and the difference between the\nmonitoring and what happened in the past is memories are\nfallible; computers aren't.\nAnd no one, or at least very rarely, sends\nhuman beings to follow people 24 hours a day. That\noccasionally happens. But with the machines, you can.\nSo, if you win, you suddenly produce what sounds like\n1984 from their brief. I understand they have an\ninterest in perhaps dramatizing that, but -- but maybe\noverly. But it still sounds like it.\nAnd so, what protection is there, if any,\nonce we accept your view of the case, from this slight\nfuturistic scenario that's just been painted and is done\nmore so in their briefs?\nMR. DREEBEN: Justice Breyer, first of all,\nthis is exactly the argument that was presented to the\nCourt in Knotts. If you go back to 1983, the beeper\ntechnology in that case seemed extraordinarily advanced,\nand there was a potential for it to be used. The\nRespondent --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Of course, that's true.\nAnd they do have a limit. In this case, they say Knotts\ninvolved a single journey, or let's say it involved four\njourneys. And let's say it involved four journeys in\n2 days. This involves every journey for a month. So,\nthey say whatever the line is that's going to protect\nus, it's short of every journey in a month.\nSo, I'm not asking -- I'm saying I accept\nyour point there. And what do you say is the limit?\nMR. DREEBEN: I first want to address the\nsuggestion that you could draw a line somewhere between\na month and a trip and have a workable standard for\npolice officers to use. Police officers use a variety\nof investigative techniques which in the aggregate\nproduce an enormous amount of information. Pen\nregisters, trash pulls. They look at financial records.\nThey conduct visual surveillance. And under a principle\nof law that says 1 trip is okay but 30 trips is not,\nthere is absolutely no guidance for law enforcement in\nhow they are --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, there is the same\nkind of guidance that you have in any case of this Court\nthat uses the technique which is used sometimes, and I\nthink it's used for example in the bribing the judge\ncase, you know, with campaign contributions. You draw\nan outer limit, you say you can't go beyond that. We\nknow within that, there is no standard. We'll leave it\nfor the lower courts to work out, and we'll review it\nover time.\nThat's not necessarily desirable, but that\nis a method this Court has sometimes used.\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, I --\nJUSTICE BREYER: But even if it's wrong, I\nwant to know, are you saying there is no limit or are\nyou suggesting one?\nMR. DREEBEN: I'm suggesting that the Court\ndo the same thing that it did in Knotts. This case does\nnot involve 24-hour surveillance of every citizen of the\nUnited States. It involves following one suspected drug\ndealer as to whom there was very strong suspicion, for a\nperiod of time that actually is less than a month,\nbecause the beeper technology failed during --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, then you're --\nyou're moving away from your argument. Your argument is\nit doesn't depend how much suspicion you have; it\ndoesn't depend on how urgent it is. Your argument is\nyou can do it, period. You don't have to give any\nreason. It doesn't have to be limited in any way,\nright?\nMR. DREEBEN: That is correct, Mr. Chief\nJustice.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, isn't the\nnormal way in these situations that we draw these limits\nhow intrusive the search can be, how long it can be, is\nby having a magistrate spell it out in a warrant?\nMR. DREEBEN: When you're talking about the\nmovements of a car on a public roadway, which even\nJustice Breyer's question seems to concede could be\nmonitored for a day or perhaps 4 days, there is no\nFourth Amendment search, unless --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, you're talking\nabout the difference between seeing a little tile and\nseeing a mosaic. The one gives you information; the\nother doesn't.\nMR. DREEBEN: So does a pen register. So\ndoes a garbage pull. So does looking at everybody's\ncredit card statement for a month. All of those things\nthis Court has held are not searches. And the --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Dreeben, this case\nstarted out with a warrant. There was a warrant, and\nthe limits weren't followed. The warrant said 10 days,\ndo this in 10 days, and the police took 11. They were\nsupposed to do it in D.C. Instead, they did it in\nMaryland.\nSo, the police could have gotten permission\nto conduct this search. In fact, they had received it.\nNow, I take it that the practice had been, because it's\nin the electronic surveillance manual, better get a\nwarrant. Was there any problem about -- when this kind\nof surveillance is wanted by the government, to get a\nwarrant? Were they encountering difficulty getting\nwarrants?\nMR. DREEBEN: In this case, there would not\nhave been any difficulty getting a warrant, Justice\nGinsburg. And the warrant authorized things beyond just\nmonitoring the car. It authorized entering the car in\norder to install it, which wasn't necessary here. It\nalso authorized monitoring the car in a location where\nthere was a reasonable expectation of privacy. This\ncase is only about monitoring a car on public streets.\nBut I think it's very important to keep in\nmind that the -- the principal use of this kind of\nsurveillance is when the police have not yet acquired\nprobable cause but have a situation that does call for\nmonitoring. And I'd like to give an example.\nIf the police get an anonymous phone call\nthat a bomb threat is going to be carried out at a\nmosque by people who work at a small company, the bomb\nthreat on an anonymous call will not provide even\nreasonable suspicion under this Court's decision in\nFlorida v. J.L.\nBut you can hardly expect the FBI to ignore\na credible, detailed-sounding piece of information like\nthat. Now, the --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If you get an\nanonymous tip that there's the same bomb in somebody's\nhouse, do you get a warrant or do -- do you just go in?\nMR. DREEBEN: You do neither, because\nwithout probable cause you cannot enter the house.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right. Well, why\nare you asking for a different rule in this situation?\nMR. DREEBEN: Because the -- the police in\nthis situation have the traditional means available to\ninvestigate these sorts of tips. They could put teams\nof agents on all the individuals who are within the pool\nof suspicion and follow them 24/7. And that would\nraise --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You're -- you're now\nsuggesting an answer to Justice Kennedy's question,\nwhich is it would be okay to take the computer chip, put\nit on somebody's overcoat, and follow every citizen\neverywhere they go indefinitely. So -- under your\ntheory and the theory espoused in your brief, you could\nmonitor and track every person through their cell phone,\nbecause today the smartphones emit signals that police\ncan pick up and use to follow someone anywhere they go.\nYour theory is so long as the -- that all --\nthat what is being monitored is the movement of person,\nof a person, they have no reasonable expectation that\ntheir possessions will not be used by you. That's\nreally the bottom line --\nMR. DREEBEN: I think that --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- to track them, to\ninvade their sense of integrity in their choices about\nwho they want to see or use their things. That's really\nargument you're making.\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, Justice Sotomayor, I\nthink that that goes considerably farther than our\nposition in this case, because our position is not that\nthe Court should overrule United States v. Karo and\npermit monitoring within a private residence. That is\noff limits absent a warrant or exigent circumstances\nplus probable cause. And monitoring an individual\nthrough their clothing poses an extremely high\nlikelihood that they will enter a place where they have\na reasonable expectation of privacy.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Cars get parked in a\ngarages. It happened here.\nMR. DREEBEN: Yes, but a car that's parked\nin a garage does not have a reasonable expectation of\nprivacy as to its location. Anyone can observe --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Neither does the person.\nMR. DREEBEN: Well --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: A person goes home, and\ntheir overcoat gets hung on a hanger. What's the\ndifference.\nMR. DREEBEN: Once the -- once the effect is\nin the house, under Karo there is an expectation of\nprivacy that cannot be breached without a warrant, and\nwe're not asking the Court to overrule that.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Tell me what the\ndifference between this and a general warrant is? I\nmean --\nMR. DREEBEN: A general warrant --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- what motivated the\nFourth Amendment historically was the disapproval, the\noutrage, that our Founding Fathers experienced with\ngeneral warrants that permitted police indiscriminately\nto investigate just on the basis of suspicion, not\nprobable cause, and to invade every possession that the\nindividual had in search of a crime. How is this\ndifferent --\nMR. DREEBEN: A warrant authorizes --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- this kind of\nsurveillance where there's no probable cause, there's\nnot even necessarily reasonable suspicion in --\nMR. DREEBEN: A warrant authorizes a search.\nThis authorizes the ability to track somebody's\nmovements in a car on a public roadway, a subject as to\nwhich this Court said in Knotts that no individual has a\nreasonable expectation of privacy because when they go\nout in their car, their car is traveling on public\nroads. Anyone can look. The police have no obligation\nto avert their eyes from anything that any member of the\npublic --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if we -- I give\nyou that, that it's in public. Does the reasonable\nexpectation of privacy trump that fact? In other words,\nif we ask people, do you think it's -- it violates your\nright to privacy to have this kind of information\nacquired, and everybody says yes, is it a response that,\nno, that takes place in public, or is it simply the\nreasonable expectation of privacy regardless of the fact\nthat it takes place in public?\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, something that takes\nplace in public isn't inherently off limits to a\nreasonable expectation of privacy. That's essentially\nthe holding of Katz. You go into a phone booth, you're\nin public; making your calls within the phone booth is\nsubject to a reasonable expectation of privacy.\nBut this Court, with full awareness of that\nholding, in Knotts and in Karo recognized that\nsurveillance of a vehicle traveling on the public\nroadways doesn't fit that description.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You can see, though,\ncan't you, that 30 years ago if you asked people does it\nviolate your privacy to be followed by a beeper, the\npolice following you, you might get one answer, while\ntoday if you ask people does it violate your right to\nprivacy to know that the police can have a record of\nevery movement you made in the past month, they might\nsee that differently?\nMR. DREEBEN: They probably would also feel\ndifferently about being followed 24/7 by a team of FBI\nagents, who gain far more information than a GPS device\nproduces. GPS only gives you the approximate location\nof the car as it drives on the roads --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And the speed as well.\nMR. DREEBEN: The approximate speed, the\nlocation traveled, the -- that -- that is what the GPS\nprovides. It doesn't show you where the car stopped.\nIt doesn't show you who was driving the car. It doesn't\nshow you who was --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: An easy way to pick\nsomeone up for speeding when you suspect something far\nworse but have no -- no probable cause.\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, this Court held in Whren\nv. United States that when the police have probable\ncause to stop someone for a traffic violation, they can\ndo that. There are protections --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: That was -- that is when\nthe police came upon the violator. But this is -- it's\nall in a computer. The police can say we want to find\nout more about X, so consult the database, see if\nthere's an indication that he was ever speeding in the\nlast 28 days.\nMR. DREEBEN: Justice Ginsburg, it's not\nvery hard for police to follow somebody and find a\ntraffic violation if they want to do that. But to\nanswer in part Justice Breyer's earlier concern about\nlimiting principles, this Court recognized in the Whren\ndecision that, although the Fourth Amendment is not a\nrestriction on discriminatory or arbitrary or oppressive\nstops that are based on invidious characteristics, the\nEqual Protection Clause is. The First Amendment also\nstands as a protection. If this Court believes that\nthere is an excessive chill created by an actual law or\nuniversal practice of monitoring people through GPS,\nthere are other constitutional principles that are\navailable.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But the Fourth Amendment\nprotects us against unreasonable searches and seizures.\nAnd if I were trying to explain to someone, here's the\nFourth Amendment, the Fourth Amendment says -- or it has\nbeen interpreted to mean that if I'm on a public bus and\nthe police want to feel my luggage, that's a violation;\nand yet, this kind of monitoring, installing the GPS and\nmonitoring the person's movement whenever they are\noutside their house in the car, is not? I mean, it just\n-- something about it that -- just doesn't parse.\nMR. DREEBEN: I'm quite sure, Justice\nGinsburg, that if you ask citizens whether the police\ncould freely pick up their trash for a month and paw\nthrough it, looking for evidence of a crime, or keep a\nrecord of every telephone call that they made for the\nduration and the number that it went through, or conduct\nintense visual surveillance of them, that citizens would\nprobably also find that to be, in the word that\nRespondents choose to use --\nJUSTICE BREYER: But they won't -- they\nwon't and probably couldn't physically.\nStart with the other end. Start -- what\nwould a democratic society look like if a large number\nof people did think that the government was tracking\ntheir every movement over long periods of time. And\nonce you reject that, you have to have a reason under\nthe Fourth Amendment and a principle. And what I'm\nlooking for is the reason and the principle that would\nreject that, but wouldn't also reject 24 hours a day for\n28 days.\nMR. DREEBEN: I think --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Do you see where I'm -- and\nthat's what I'm listening very hard to find.\nMR. DREEBEN: All right. Justice Breyer,\ntwo things on that. First of all, I think the\nline-drawing problems that the Court would create for\nitself would be intolerable, and better that the Court\nshould address the so-called 1984 scenarios if they come\nto pass, rather than using this case as a vehicle for\ndoing so.\nSecond, if the Court --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: This case is not that\nvehicle.\nMR. DREEBEN: If the Court --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The GPS technology today\nis limited only by the cost of the instrument, which\nfrankly right now is so small that it wouldn't take that\nmuch of a budget, local budget, to place a GPS on every\ncar in the nation.\nMR. DREEBEN: Oh, I think that would be --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Almost every car has it\nnow.\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, I think it would be\nvirtually impossible to use the kinds of tracking\ndevices that were used in this case on everyone\nbecause --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Don't we have any\nlegislatures out there that can stop this stuff?\nMR. DREEBEN: I think that -- Justice\nScalia, the legislature is a safeguard, and if the Court\nbelieves that there needs to be a Fourth Amendment\nsafeguard as well, we have urged as a fallback position\nthat the Court adopt a reasonable suspicion standard\nwhich would allow the police to conduct surveillance of\nindividuals in their movements on public roadways, which\nthey can do visually in any event, and would allow the\npolice to investigate leads and tips that arise under\ncircumstances where there is not probable cause.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Who would be under your\ntest the judge of the reasonable suspicion?\nMR. DREEBEN: As in most reasonable\nsuspicion cases, it's the police at the front end and\nit's the courts at the back end if there are motions to\nsuppress evidence. But fundamentally, just as in the\npen register example and in the financial records\nexample, if this Court concludes, consistent with its\nearlier cases, that this is not a search, yet all\nAmericans find it to be an omen of 1984, Congress would\nstand ready to provide appropriate protection.\nIf I may save the rest of my time for\nrebuttal.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you. Your --\nour questions have eaten into your rebuttal time. So,\nwe'll give you the full time.\nMr. Leckar.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN C. LECKAR\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. LECKAR: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nI want to talk about the one issue that the\nUnited States didn't talk about, which is whether this\nis a seizure. This case can be resolved on a very\nnarrow basis, a very narrow basis: What are the\nconsequences when the police without a warrant install a\nGPS secretly on the car of any citizen of the United\nStates, and they want to use the evidence gained that\nway in a criminal trial? Our position is that's a\nseizure.\nJUSTICE ALITO: What is the size of this\ndevice?\nMR. LECKAR: I'm sorry, Your Honor?\nJUSTICE ALITO: What is the size of this\ndevice?\nMR. LECKAR: In -- the record doesn't show\nin this case, but we know -- we learned last week,\nJustice Alito, from the NACDL that there's now a GPS on\nthe market that weighs 2 ounces and is the size of a\ncredit card. Think how easy it would be for any law\nenforcement agent of the 880,000 in the United States to\nstick one of those on anybody's vehicle.\nJUSTICE ALITO: And what if it was put on\nthe license place? Would that be a technical trespass?\nIs that the property of the driver?\nMR. LECKAR: Well, a license plate, as I\nunderstand it, is the property of the State, and driving\nis a privilege. But it's not a technical trespass in\nthis particular case. Mr. Jones had the --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Is that right? I don't own\nmy license plate? I didn't know that. How do you know\nthat?\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SCALIA: How do you know that? I\npaid for my license plate.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: We don't need to get into\nit, but \"Live Free or Die\" was spelled on the license\nplate.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. LECKAR: What I'm saying, Justice\nKennedy and Justice Scalia, is this: That the issue\ninsofar as the seizure is concerned is, is it\nmeaningful. Everybody agrees here that there is -- that\nAntoine Jones had the right to control the use of his\nvehicle. The question is, was the interference a\nmeaningful deprivation of his possessory interest?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I didn't -- I didn't\nhear an answer to Justice Alito's question. What is\nyour position on the placement of the GPS device on the\nState-owned license plate?\nMR. LECKAR: They can't do it. They can't\ndo it, Your Honor. It's a seizure.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's a --\nMR. LECKAR: If -- I'm sorry. If the\ninstallation --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: My understanding is\ncorrect that it's the State's license plate they require\nyou to have. So, your trespass theory, it would seem,\nfalls apart with respect to that particular scenario.\nMR. LECKAR: Well, first of all, Justice --\nChief Justice Roberts, my -- you would probably see the\nGPS, and in that case, you might have --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No. It's the size\nof a credit card. You slip it behind the license plate.\nMR. LECKAR: In that particular case, what\nyou have done is you have -- the installation of the\nGPS, it is a seizure. What makes it meaningful is the\nuse of that GPS --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, this is ridiculous.\nLook at -- you give the State permission to put the\nlicense plate -- to carry -- to have your car carry the\nState's license plate. You do not give anybody\npermission to have your car carry a tracking device.\nMR. LECKAR: That's correct.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And whether it's put\ndirectly on the car or directly on something that the\ncar is carrying doesn't seem to me to make any\ndifference.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I thought it made a\ndifference under your theory, which focused on the\nquestion of trespass, because it was attached to an\neffect owned by somebody else. This is an effect not\nowned by the individual.\nMR. LECKAR: That's correct.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, the trespass\ntheory anyway doesn't seem ridiculous to me.\nMR. LECKAR: But it's an effect, Your Honor.\nThe Fourth Amendment protects effects. It protects\npeople. If you put it on somebody's briefcase, you put\nit on somebody's car, you have affected their possessory\ninterest. Then the question becomes --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Leckar, I guess I'm not\nsure I quite understand the argument, because a trespass\nis accomplished no matter what you put on somebody's car\nor somebody's overcoat or what have you. You could put\na nonworking device in somebody's car, and it would\nstill be a trespass, but surely the same constitutional\nproblem is not raised. So, how do you get from the\ntrespass to the constitutional problem?\nMR. LECKAR: As I -- thank you, Justice\nKagan. As I said moments ago, what makes it meaningful,\nwhat makes it a meaningful deprivation of a -- of a\npossessory interest, is once the GPS gets activated. We\nlook at reality. We follow what Silverman v. --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That doesn't make it a\nseizure. That doesn't make it a seizure. It makes it a\nsearch.\nMR. LECKAR: Your Honor --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, you can say that\nthere's a trespass for the purpose of obtaining\ninformation, which makes it a search. But I don't see\nhow it's a seizure. A seizure -- you have to bring\nsomething within your control. You have to stop the\nperson or stop the vehicle. What has been seized when\nyou -- when you slap a tracking device on a car?\nMR. LECKAR: What has been seized is\nAntoine's data. Data is seized that is created by the\nGPS. Antoine Jones had the right, Your Honor, to\ncontrol the use of his vehicle. And what the government\ndid was surreptitiously deprive him of the use of\nthat --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Do you have any case\ninvolving seizure of data floating in the air as opposed\nto papers?\nMR. LECKAR: The closest case I could come,\nYour Honor, would be Silverman, where the Court called a\nFourth Amendment violation where the spike mike just\ntouched -- touched the ventilator unit.\nJUSTICE BREYER: It's not a violation\nunless, in addition to a search, it is an unreasonable\nsearch. And since you already -- and the same is true\nof seizure, isn't it?\nMR. LECKAR: That's right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So, you already have --\neverybody agrees it's at least a search. So, what do\nyou care whether there's the -- and there's a case\ncalled Karo which says whether it's a trespass doesn't\nreally matter. The question is the reasonableness of\nit. And that's what I think -- I mean, you can argue\ntrespass as much as you want, but I'll still have in\nmind is it reasonable.\nMR. LECKAR: That's right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And I think that's the\nquestion we've been debating. And I would like to know\nfrom you -- what they are saying is that the parade of\nhorribles we can worry with -- worry about when it comes\nup; the police have many, many people that they suspect\nof all kinds of things ranging from kidnappings of lost\nchildren to terrorism to all kinds of crimes.\nThey're willing to go as far as reasonable\nsuspicion in a pinch. And they say at least with that,\nyou will avoid the 1984 scenario, and you will in fact\nallow the police to do their work with doing no more\nthan subjecting the person to really good knowledge of\nwhere he's going on the open highway. Now, I -- they\nprobably put it better than I did, but I'd appreciate\nyour views on that.\nMR. LECKAR: Reasonable suspicion, Justice\nBreyer, is something that the Court has adopted for\nlimited intrusions. And I refer you to the United\nStates v. Place. Every 10 seconds of the day for 28\ndays is by no person's lights a -- a limited intrusion.\nThat said, what -- what happened here, society does not\nview as reasonable the concept that the United States\nGovernment has the right to take a device that enables\nthem to engage in pervasive, limitless, cost-free --\ncost-free surveillance -- that completely replaces the\nhuman equation --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How do you know\nthat?\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Why does it have to be\ncost-free? Suppose the police department says: We've\ngot two things; we can put 30 deputies on this route and\nwatch this person, or we can have a device with a\nwarrant. What difference does it make?\nMR. LECKAR: What happens is the police have\nthe capacity with GPS to engage in grave abuse, grave\nabuse of individual and group liberties, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But suppose what they got\nis nothing more than what they would have had if they\nhad 30 deputies staked out along the route. That's all.\nThey'd get the same from 30 deputies. A constitutional\nviolation?\nMR. LECKAR: Yes, if they use a GPS, Your\nHonor. Any placement of a GPS on anybody's car or this\ncar --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, no. We're assuming\nthat there's no initial trespass, which is a problem in\nthis case.\nMR. LECKAR: All right.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: You're saying it's -- it's\nthe quantity and -- of the information seized and the\ntime over which it's seized. And that's the proposition\nwe're testing. And it seems to me what you're saying is\nthat the police have to use the most inefficient\nmethods.\nMR. LECKAR: No, Your Honor. I'm not\nasking --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm fully aware of the\n1984 ministry of love, ministry of -- of peace problem.\nBut this -- your argument, it seems to me, has no\nprincipled distinction from the case that I put.\nMR. LECKAR: I think I can help you with\nthat. We're not asking to make the police less\nefficient than they were before GPS came into effect.\nWe're simply saying that the use of GPS has grave\npotential -- grave threats of abuse to privacy; that\npeople have an expectation, Justice Kennedy, that their\nneighbor is not going to use their car to track them.\nPeople have an -- under Rakas -- and I refer the Court\nto footnote 12 in the Rakas case. Antoine Jones had\ncontrol of that car. Control of that -- of the vehicle\nmeant that he had a reasonable expectation that society\nis prepared to view as objectively reasonable. The\ngovernment --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But he -- he wouldn't be\nprotected against a surveillance camera that could get\ninformation. And is this really different in kind from\nthe surveillance camera?\nMR. LECKAR: Yes. First of all, you have a\nphysical invasion. That's Bond v. United States. You\nhave an invasion of his possessory interest, placement\non the car. Physical invasion of a possessory interest,\nJustice Ginsburg, is more significant. It has always\nbeen viewed by this Court as more invasive than mere\nvideo -- mere visual surveillance.\nAnd even with a camera, it depends on the\ntype of the video camera. We're not saying that the\npolice are prohibited from having individual video\ncameras or several video cameras to surveil people.\nWhat we're saying here is this device, this device that\nenables limitless, pervasive, indiscriminate --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: But what is the difference\nreally? I'm told -- maybe this is wrong, but I'm told\nthat if somebody goes to London, almost every place that\nperson goes there's a camera taking pictures, so that\nthe police can put together snapshots of where everybody\nis all the time. So, why is this different from that?\nMR. LECKAR: It's pretty scary. I wouldn't\nwant to live in London under those circumstances.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it must be\nunconstitutional if it's scary.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, what is it, the\nscary provision of what article?\nJUSTICE BREYER: And, in fact, those cameras\nin London actually enabled them, if you watched, I got\nthe impression, to track the bomber who was going to\nblow up the airport in Glasgow and to stop him before he\ndid. So, there are many people who will say that that\nkind of surveillance is worthwhile, and there are others\nlike you who will say, no, that's a bad thing. But that\nisn't the issue exactly in front of us.\nMR. LECKAR: That's correct, Your Honor.\nWhat we have here is a physical --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And what Justice Kagan\nwanted to know is why not.\nMR. LECKAR: Because you have a physical\ninvasion of property.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Oh, my goodness. Here, I I\ncan read -- sorry, I just had that expression because\nI'm reading: \"The existence of a physical trespass is\nonly marginally relevant to the question of whether the\nFourth Amendment has been violated, however, for an\nactual trespass is neither necessary nor sufficient to\nestablish a constitutional violation.\" That's Karo.\nSo, you can talk if you'd like. It's your\nhour. But I would really be very interested in hearing\nyou on the assumption that the real issue here is\nwhether this is reasonable.\nMR. LECKAR: It's not, Your Honor. This is\nnot a Karo case. First of all, in Karo the installation\nwas essentially consented to. You took -- the package\ncame in by virtue of somebody who was working for the\ngovernment. So, the installation was not unlike this\ncase -- was unlike this case, where it was surreptitious\nand directly engaged in by a government agent.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But you're --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: You're mixing -- you're\nmixing two things. You're the one that -- I thought\nyour position was that the initial trespass is not\nimportant. That's the narrow way to decide the issue.\nYou don't want us to do that. So, now we ask you about\nKaro, and you say, oh, well, there was a trespass. So,\nthat's -- that's not -- that's not a responsive answer.\nMR. LECKAR: Well, but technology, as you\nobserved, Justice Kennedy, is dramatically different\nwith GPS than was present in Karo.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But it's going to be\ndramatically different in the next step. There are now\nsatellites that look down and can hone in on your home\non a block in a neighborhood. I don't see that far in\nthe future when those cameras are going to be able to\nshow you the entire world and let you track somebody on\nthe camera from place to place.\nMR. LECKAR: Well --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, if -- give us a\ntheory. Is that okay for the police to access those\ncameras and look at you moving from place to place? And\nif that's okay, then why is this not okay? What is your\ntheory of your case?\nMR. LECKAR: Our theory, Justice Sotomayor,\nwith respect to video camera, if they're targeting an\nindividual -- this presents a grave question. It's a\nquestion that need not be resolved given this case. But\nif the Court wanted to address that question, once the\npolice target somebody, they want to engage in\nindividualized targeting for use of a pervasive network\nof cameras, and GPS is like a million cameras. That's\nthe -- the New York Court of Appeals pointed that out,\nand this --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I think there's about 28\nsatellites up there, but okay.\nMR. LECKAR: All right. It's 28 cameras,\nbut the equivalent of a camera tracking you every street\ncorner you're on everywhere. Once you have\nindividualized suspicion like that, if a court wanted to\ndeal with it, I believe you would have to have a\nwarrant.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Leckar, your -- all of\nthis discussion -- you're going into it, but the\nquestioning leads you into it -- it seems to me leaps\nover the difficult part of your case. The issue before\nus is not -- not in the abstract whether this police\nconduct is unreasonable. The unreasonableness\nrequirement or the unreasonableness prohibition does not\ntake effect unless there has been a search. And our\ncases have said that there's no search when -- when you\nare in public and where everything that you do is open\nto -- to the view of people. That's the hard question\nin the case, not whether this is unreasonable. That's\nnot what the Fourth Amendment says, the police can't do\nanything that's unreasonable. They can do a lot of\nstuff that's unreasonable without violating the Fourth\nAmendment, and the -- the protection against that is the\nlegislature.\nBut you have to establish, if you're going\nto go with Katz, that there has been an invasion of --\nof privacy when all that -- all that this is showing is\nwhere the car is going on the public streets, where the\npolice could have had round-the-clock surveillance on\nthis individual for a whole month or for 2 months or for\n3 months, and that would not have violated anything,\nwould it?\nMR. LECKAR: No.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why? Because there's no\ninvasion of privacy. So, why is this an invasion of\nprivacy?\nMR. LECKAR: Because it is -- it is a\ncomplete robotic substitute. It's not a -- it's not a\ntail. And interestingly enough, Your Honor. The\ngovernment only cited in its brief one instance of a\n24-hour surveillance for all of 2 days. What you have\nhere, Justice Scalia, is -- I'm going to refer to your\ndissent.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: A hundred times zero equals\nzero. If -- if there is no invasion of privacy for 1\nday, there's no invasion of privacy for a hundred days.\nNow, it may be unreasonable police conduct, and we can\nhandle that with laws. But if there's no invasion of\nprivacy, no matter how many days you do it, there's no\ninvasion of privacy.\nMR. LECKAR: Justice Scalia, what -- I'm\ngoing to refer to your dissent along with Justice Breyer\nin Bond v. United States. A GPS in your car is like --\nor anybody's car, is like -- without a warrant, is like\nhaving an -- it makes you unable to get rid of an\nuninvited stranger. That's what it is. Now, what --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So is a tail. So is a tail\nwhen the police surveil -- surveil you for -- for a\nmonth.\nMR. LECKAR: The question we have to answer\nin this case, Justice Scalia, is this: A tail -- if\nthey can -- if they want a tail, if they want to commit\nthe resources, that's fine. But what a GPS does, it\ninvolves -- it allows the government to engage in\nunlimited surveillance through a machine, through a\nmachine robotically. Nobody is even involved monitoring\nit. The record in this case showed that many times the\npolice officers just let -- let the machine go on.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, where would you draw\nthe line? Suppose that the GPS was used only to track\nsomebody's movements for 1 day or for 12 hours or for 3\nhours. Would that be all right?\nMR. LECKAR: Our position, Justice Alito, is\nno circumstances should a GPS be allowed to be put on\nsomebody's car. But we recognize --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Put aside -- put aside the\ntrespass question.\nMR. LECKAR: I'm not addressing it purely as\na trespass. Our view is the -- the use of a GPS as a\nsearch in and of itself should be -- is -- should be\nviewed as unreasonable. But if the Court were\nuncomfortable with that, if the Court had concerns with\nthat, we suggested in our brief some -- some\npossibilities: One day, one trip, one person per day or\ntrip, or perhaps when you use it exactly as a beeper,\nwhen you follow it, when you actually physically follow\nit.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, that sounds like a\nlegislative line. But what is the difference between\nfollowing somebody for 12 hours, let's say, and\nmonitoring their movements on a GPS for 12 hours? You\nwould say that the latter -- your first argument is\nthere's a problem with the latter but not with the\nformer. But what would the reason for that be?\nMR. LECKAR: Because it's an unreasonable\ninvasion of privacy, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE ALITO: There's no more -- what --\nwhat is the difference in terms of one's privacy whether\nyou're followed by a police officer for 12 hours and you\ndon't see the officer or whether you're monitored by GPS\nfor 12 hours?\nMR. LECKAR: Because -- because what you\nhave here is society does not expect that the police,\nthe human element, would be taken out of -- would be\ntaken out of the surveillance factor.\nJUSTICE ALITO: You know, I don't know what\nsociety expects, and I think it's changing. Technology\nis changing people's expectations of privacy.\nSuppose we look forward 10 years, and maybe\n10 years from now 90 percent of the population will be\nusing social networking sites, and they will have on\naverage 500 friends, and they will have allowed their\nfriends to monitor their location 24 hours a day, 365\ndays a year, through the use of their cell phones. Then\n-- what would the expectation of privacy be then?\nMR. LECKAR: Well, the use of a cell phone,\nthere are two ways of looking at it. As Justice Kennedy\nobserved in Quon, cell phones are becoming so\nubiquitous, there may be privacy interests.\nOur view is that currently the use of a cell\nphone, that's a voluntary act. People nowadays\nunderstand that there are ways to monitor by way of a\ncell phone.\nBut I started my oral argument with this\nbasic precept, Justice Alito: This case does not\nrequire us to decide those issues of emerging\ntechnology. It's a simple case at the core: Should the\npolice be allowed surreptitiously to put these machines\non people's cars and either -- call it a seizure, call\nit a search, call it a search and seizure in the words\nof Katz, or call it a Fourth Amendment violation.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, that -- maybe that's a\ngood way to decide the case. But I just wonder, would\nMr. Jones or anybody else be really upset if they found\nthat the police had sneaked up to their car and put an\ninert device the size of a credit card on the underside\nof the car? What would they say about that, other than\nthe fact that the police are wasting money doing this?\nMR. LECKAR: If it were nothing more than a\nnote, say, or even a bumper sticker like you get at\nSouth of the Border, probably nothing, but this --\nJUSTICE ALITO: You don't even see it. It's\njust a little wafer. They put it under the car. It\ndoes nothing.\nMR. LECKAR: It's a little wafer that's got\nan enormous capacity. Look at the --\nJUSTICE ALITO: No, but this one does\nnothing, and you -- so you would go -- you would sue --\nyou would bring a trespass action.\nMR. LECKAR: No, heavens, no, Your Honor.\nIf it did nothing, first, it wouldn't be a Fourth\nAmendment problem.\nJUSTICE ALITO: So, what's you're concerned\nabout is not this little thing that's put on your car.\nIt's not this invasion of your property interest. It's\nthe monitoring that takes place.\nMR. LECKAR: The monitoring makes it\nmeaningful. Putting it on enables them to make --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: But to ask Justice Alito's\nquestion in a different way, suppose that the police\ncould do this without ever committing the trespass.\nSuppose that in the future all cars are going to have\nGPS tracking systems, and the police could essentially\nhack into such a system without committing the trespass.\nWould the constitutional issue we face be any different?\nMR. LECKAR: If, as I assume, that's because\nof manufacturers doing it, or because Congress has\nlegislated it, Justice Kagan? Under either\ncircumstance, people would know. They would know that\ntheir privacy rights had been taken away. Whether that\nwould be possible to be -- to go through Congress, I\nseriously doubt, but people would know.\nIn this particular case, Antoine Jones had\nno idea whatsoever that his possessory interest in that\nproperty was about to be deprived by the government in a\nmeaningful way to allow them to get information they\ncouldn't have otherwise have gotten.\nJustice Alito, what happens here, GPS\nproduces unique data. When you and I drive down the\nstreet, we don't emit GPS data. What makes GPS data\nmeaningful is the act -- is the use and placement of the\nGPS device, that was in this case, in this case,\nunconsented to by Antoine Jones, unknowingly. And the\ngovernment knew that. That's why they went and did it\nsurreptitiously, because they couldn't get it any other\nway.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Lots of communities have,\nincluding Washington, cameras on -- at intersections on\nstop lights. Suppose the police suspected someone of\ncriminal activity, and they had a computer capacity to\ntake pictures of all the intersections that he drove\nthrough at different times of day, and they checked his\nmovements and his routes for 5 days. Would that be\nlawful?\nMR. LECKAR: I think that would be\nallowable, Your Honor. I don't think --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: You think it would be?\nMR. LECKAR: I think that would be\npermissible, Your Honor. First of all, you don't have\nan invasion of -- you don't have a physical intrusion,\nunlike this case. People nowadays --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: You have -- you have a\ntargeted invasion. It's over a period of time. It's\nover a long -- it's over a wide space, and it seems to\nme that -- it seems to me you have to answer my question\n\"yes\" to be consistent with what you've said earlier.\nMR. LECKAR: No, Your Honor. As I said\nearlier, you can have an -- you can have an occasional\nvideo camera out there. People understand nowadays that\nthere may be video cameras out in public space. The --\nbut we don't have any -- society does not expect -- view\nit as reasonable to have the equivalent of a million\nvideo cameras following you everywhere you go.\nA few video cameras, people know. They've\ncropped -- they've cropped up, and they've been\naccepted. But this is a horse of an entirely different\ncolor. This is a small device that enables the\ngovernment to get information of a vast amount of --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What an --\nMR. LECKAR: The camera is one site, one --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What an unworkable rule\nwith no -- tethered to no principle.\nMR. LECKAR: I'm sorry.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What an unworkable rule\ntethered to no principle. A thousand video cameras may\nor may not be okay, depending on how large the city is?\nMR. LECKAR: No, Justice Sotomayor. I think\nthe workable rule and the simplest rule that should be\nadopted is this: I think the Court should say to the\nlaw enforcement agency you came here looking for a rule;\nwe're going to give you a rule. If you want to use GPS\ndevices, get a warrant, absent exigent circumstances or\nanother recognized exception to the Fourth Amendment;\nbecause of their capacity for -- to collect data that\nyou couldn't realistically get, because of the\nvanishingly low cost, because of their pervasive nature,\nthat you should get a warrant any time -- you must get a\nwarrant any time you're going to attach a GPS to a\ncitizen's effect or to a citizen's person.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that gets back\nto Justice Scalia's question, which is you've got to\ndetermine that there has been a search first before you\nimpose the warrant requirement. And it seems to me that\nyour -- the warrant requirement applies only with\nrespect to searches, right?\nMR. LECKAR: And seizures.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay. And seizures.\nSo, while it might seem like a good idea to impose the\nrequirement on this particular technological device, you\nstill have to establish that it's a search.\nMR. LECKAR: But if you know, if you the\npolice agents know -- this is the deliberative process.\nThese devices aren't used for just quick one-off\nsurveillance. They're used to track people over time,\nas witness this case, every 10 seconds of the day for 28\ndays.\nIf you know you're going to do that and you\nknow, Justice Roberts, that this device -- this device\nhas an amazingly invasive power and capacity. If you\nknow you're going to do that and you're a law\nenforcement agent, then you do what they did originally.\nYou get a warrant.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Now, we pushed your\n-- we pushed your friend to the limits of his theory.\nYour theory, I take it, would apply if you're going to\ndo it for 3 minutes, right? Where's the car? You push\na button; it's 3 minutes. You say that's still a Fourth\nAmendment violation?\nMR. LECKAR: Yes --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay. Well, then\ndon't talk to me about how long they're going to be\ndoing it or all the information. We have to test the\nvalidity of your theory on the proposition that it\nviolates the Fourth Amendment to do this for 3 minutes.\nMR. LECKAR: I -- I think it does, Your\nHonor, because of the -- society does not expect --\nsociety views it as objectively reasonable not to\nexpect --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You have said that\nseveral times. How do we tell? I mean, I don't know\nwhat society expects. I suppose if you ask people do\nyou think it's a violation of privacy for the police to\ndo this for no reason for a month, maybe they'd come out\none way. If you asked the people do you think the\npolice have to have probable cause before they monitor\nfor 5 minutes the movements of somebody they think is\ngoing to set off a huge bomb, maybe you get a different\nanswer.\nMR. LECKAR: You look to -- you look to the\ncommon law. You look to well-established case law. You\nlook to statutes in several jurisdictions. I think\nthere are seven or eight that said this sort of practice\nshould be prohibited.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Excellent. Yes. Of\ncourse, a legislature can take care of this, whether or\nnot there is an invasion of privacy. And they can pick\n5 days out of the air. You can't do it for any more\nthan 5 days, or you can't do it to more than -- than 50\npeople at a time. They can take care of all of that\nstuff.\nWe can't do that in a decision under the --\nunder the Fourth Amendment.\nMR. LECKAR: We have --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why isn't this precisely\nthe kind of a problem that you should rely upon\nlegislatures to take care of?\nMR. LECKAR: That's the same -- that's the\nsame -- same problem that the United States advanced\nbefore this Court in the United States v. District\nCourt; give it to Congress. And what this Court there\ndid, it held a Fourth Amendment violation so far as\ndomestic security is concerned and gave Congress\nsuggestions. In this particular case, I could probably\ngive you 535 reasons why not to go to Congress --\n(Laughter.)\nMR. LECKAR: -- but let me suggest\nsomething, Justice Scalia. What happened was the United\nStates has adopted a shifting position. They came to\nthis Court, and they said we want a workable rule; give\nus a workable rule. You either overrule the D.C.\nCircuit, which you should not do, or give us a workable\nrule. Now they've said in their brief, oh, let's take\nit to the legislature. They can't have it both ways.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Can you take it to Congress\nthe other way? I mean, can you say that a general\nsearch of this kind is not constitutional under the\nFourth Amendment, but should Congress pick out a subset\nthereof, say, the -- terrorism or where there is\nreasonable cause or like the FISA court or special\ncourts to issue special kinds of warrants, that that's a\ndifferent question which we could decide at a later\ntime?\nThat's a negative way of -- I mean, that way\nfavors you in the result, but I've -- I've been looking\nfor -- if there is a way of going to Congress to create\nthe situations where they can do it, rather than the\nsituations where they can't.\nMR. LECKAR: Justice Breyer, that was\nexactly what Congress -- what happened when the foreign\nintelligence surveillance courts were created. You hit\nit right on the nail. All this Court has to do is\ndecide the narrow question before it, which I've\narticulated several times.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't see why it's any of\nCongress's business if it's a -- if it's a purely\nintrastate operation. Congress can control police\npractices that don't violate the Fourth Amendment\nthroughout the country? I mean, maybe interstate,\ninterstate beepers and interstate tracking devices, yes,\nbut so long as you track within -- within the State\nisn't that okay?\nMR. LECKAR: No, Your Honor. First of all,\nlet me refer to Chief -- to Justice Frankfurter's\ncomments a long time ago in Watts v. Indiana: Justices\nare not ignorant of the law, of what they know to be\ntrue as men and women.\nBut other legislatures would follow\nCongress. But what we have here -- what we have here is\na live case of controversy in which Antoine Jones'\ncontrol of his vehicle was usurped and his car was\nconverted into an electronic GPS transceiver serving the\ngovernment.\nSo, that case is here, and it -- it needs to\nbe decided. One doesn't need to address technologies\nthat aren't here before the Court today. You could; we\ncould venture down that road. We could discuss drone\nsurveillance. We could discuss balloon surveillance and\nother types of surveillance. But we don't have to.\nIt's a narrow --\nJUSTICE ALITO: There was a warrant -- there\nwas a warrant in this case. This is a puzzling aspect\nof the case to me, and maybe there -- it's irrelevant\nfor present purposes. There was a warrant, and the two\nviolations are violations of a statute and a rule,\nneither of which may carry an exclusionary rule sanction\nwith them or an exclusionary rule penalty with them.\nIt's not clear at all that there was a\nviolation of the Fourth Amendment. So, it's a little\nstrange that we're deciding whether a warrantless search\nhere would have been unconstitutional, when there was a\nwarrant.\nMR. LECKAR: They had the choice. They\ncould have easily -- they could have gone back to the\ndistrict judge and said -- given the district judge\nreasons --\nJUSTICE ALITO: No, that's not my point.\nThe point is that the violation of the 10-day rule and\nthe violation of the statutory prohibition on -- or\nmaybe it's in the rule -- the prohibition on the judge\nin the District ordering the installation only in the\nDistrict are not Fourth Amendment requirements.\nMR. LECKAR: No. That's correct, Your\nHonor, but what we have -- what we have here is a\nwarrantless intrusion. When -- when the warrant --\nJUSTICE ALITO: It is not a warrantless\nintrusion; there was a warrant.\nMR. LECKAR: But the warrant was not in\neffect. At the -- at the time the -- the GPS was\nplaced, Justice Alito, there was no warrant. There's a\ncase this Court decided in the --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I think that's conceded\nby both sides, and that's accepted by both sides. The\nwarrant expired. There was no warrant. The government\ncertainly could have gone back and said, judge, we\ndidn't make it; we need a little more time; give us 10\nmore days.\nMR. LECKAR: They could -- they could\nconceivably have gone back there and explained to the\ndistrict judge why they couldn't have installed it in\nthat period of time. The --\nJUSTICE ALITO: I think if you look at the\nlower court case law, you will find that a violation of\nthe 10-day rule is not necessarily a violation of the\nFourth Amendment. And --\nMR. LECKAR: I understand that.\nJUSTICE ALITO: -- it doesn't vitiate the\nwarrant. The warrant doesn't necessarily dissolve or\nevaporate when the 10 days expire.\nMR. LECKAR: Your --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Maybe those cases are wrong.\nMR. LECKAR: There's a 1920 Supreme Court\ndecision decided during the Prohibition era that\nspecifically said that when a warrant expires, there is\nno warrant. When the 10-day rule in that case had\nexpired, there's no warrant. We have a warrantless\nintrusion here. The government didn't have to do a\nwarrantless intrusion. I ask --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMR. LECKAR: -- the Court to affirm.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Dreeben, 5\nminutes.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. DREEBEN: Mr. Chief Justice, advancing\ntechnology cuts in two directions. Technological\nadvances can make the police more efficient at what they\ndo through some of the examples that were discussed\ntoday: Cameras, airplanes, beepers, GPS. At the same\ntime, technology and how it's used can change our\nexpectations of privacy in the ways that Justice Alito\nwas alluding to. Today perhaps GPS can be portrayed as\na 1984-type invasion, but as people use GPS in their\nlives and for other purposes, our expectations of\nprivacy surrounding our location may also change. For\nthat --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Dreeben, that -- that\nseems too much to me. I mean, if you think about this,\nand you think about a little robotic device following\nyou around 24 hours a day anyplace you go that's not\nyour home, reporting in all your movements to the\npolice, to investigative authorities, the notion that we\ndon't have an expectation of privacy in that, the notion\nthat we don't think that our privacy interests would be\nviolated by this robotic device, I'm -- I'm not sure how\none can say that.\nMR. DREEBEN: Justice Kagan, I think the\nCourt should decide that case when it comes to it. This\nwas my fundamental point: This case does not involve\nuniversal surveillance of every member of this Court or\nevery member of the society. It involves limited\nsurveillance of somebody who was suspected of drug\nactivity --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: You probably haven't had\nthe opportunity to go into the cases. A hypothetical.\nSuppose exactly these facts, only the police aren't\ninvolved. A neighbor does it to another neighbor in\norder to see where that neighbor is going, and when he\nfinds out, he tells his wife and other neighbors. Do\nyou think that in most States, that would be an invasion\nof privacy?\nMR. DREEBEN: I'm willing to assume that it\nmight be, Justice Kennedy, but I don't think that this\nCourt measures the metes and bounds of the Fourth\nAmendment by State law invasions of privacy. The Court\nhas --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: We measure it by\nexpectations of privacy under the Katz test if -- that\nmay or may not be controlling.\nMR. DREEBEN: Yes, but in Greenwood, the\nCourt dealt with a case where California had outlawed\ntaking somebody's garbage, and this Court said that did\nnot define an expectation of privacy for purposes of the\nFourth Amendment --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: It found that there was no\nexpectation of privacy.\nMR. DREEBEN: Correct.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I am asking you about this\ncase, whether there would be an expectation of\nprivacy --\nMR. DREEBEN: Oh --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- as a general matter\nunder tort law.\nMR. DREEBEN: No, I don't think so. And --\nand the fact that something may be a tort for a private\nperson doesn't mean that it's a problem for the police\nto do it. For example, in the Dow Chemical case, where\nthe police used -- EPA in that case actually used\ncameras to surveil an industrial plant. There was a\nclaim that it would have violated trade secret law for\nanybody else to do that. And the Court accepted that\nand said tort law doesn't define the boundaries of the\nFourth Amendment.\nIn Knotts, the Court was very careful to\nreserve the possibility of 24-hour surveillance of every\ncitizen in their persons and in their residences, saying\nwe haven't seen that kind of abuse. If that kind of\nabuse comes up, the legislature is the best-equipped to\ndeal with it, if in fact our society regards that as an\nunreasonable restriction on --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Do you have any idea of\nhow many GPS devices are being used by Federal\nGovernment agencies and State law enforcement officials?\nMR. DREEBEN: The Federal Government I can\nspeak to, and it's in the low thousands annually. It's\nnot a massive universal use of an investigative\ntechnique. The FBI requires that there be some\nreasonable basis for using GPS before it installs it.\nAnd as a result, this is a technique that basically\nsupplements visual surveillance rather than supplanting\nit all together.\nThere was visual surveillance that was\ndirected at Respondent. The GPS allowed it to be more\neffective. As Justice Kennedy and, I think, Justice\nScalia's hypotheticals illustrated, Respondent is\nessentially conceding that around-the-clock visual\nsurveillance through teams of agents would not have\ninvaded any expectation of privacy.\nThis Court said in Knotts that police\nefficiency has never been equated with police\nunconstitutionality. The fact that GPS makes it more\nefficient for the police to put a tail on somebody\ninvades no additional expectation of privacy that they\notherwise would have had. The technology doesn't make\nsomething private that was previously public. When we\ngo out in our cars, our cars have driver's licenses that\nwe carry. We have license plates on the car. These are\nfor the purpose of identification --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You don't seriously\nargue that there isn't a possessory interest in who puts\nsomething on your car and who -- like a -- a sign of\nsome sort.\nMR. DREEBEN: Oh, I think there would\nprobably be some sort of State law possessory interest\n-- Mr. Chief Justice, may I finish? But there is no\nseizure for the very reason that Justice Breyer\ndescribed under the Katz case. This Court has said that\ntrespass is neither necessary nor sufficient to create a\nFourth Amendment violation.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Dreeben, counsel.\n"
