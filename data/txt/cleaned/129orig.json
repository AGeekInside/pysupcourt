BAIDA\nON BEHALF OF THE PLAINTIFF\nMR. BAIDA: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and\nmay it please the Court:\nThere are two reasons why the State of Maryland\nhas the authority to regulate Virginia and its citizens\nwhen they seek to place structures in and withdraw water\nfrom the Potomac River.\nFirst, as confirmed by the Black-Jenkins Award\nof 1877 and this Court's decision in Morris v. United\nStates, the State of Maryland is and has been the owner of\nthe Potomac River since 1632, and Maryland has never --\nQUESTION: Mr. Baida, before you get into your\nargument, can I just ask you a preliminary question? I\nmade the mistake of reading the Master's report before I\nread the briefs. There's an awful lot of discussion of\nthe entire river issue in there. Is that -- you're no\nlonger making that point?\nMR. BAIDA: Correct, we are not.\nMaryland is and has been the owner of the river,\nand it has never relinquished the sovereign authority that\nits title to the river gives it to regulate what takes\nplace on and over the bed.\nAnd the second reason --\nQUESTION: Do you think the compact covers\nwithdrawals of water by Virginia? I mean, does it\ndirectly cover that at all?\nMR. BAIDA: It's not the privilege of making and\ncarrying out orders, Justice O'Connor, although that\nprivilege would seem to apply to building something into\nthe river to exercise a riparian right, and there is a\nriparian right to withdraw water.\nQUESTION: Well, do you -- do you take the\nposition that Maryland could reject every effort by\nVirginia to withdraw water from the river?\nMR. BAIDA: No, Justice O'Connor. We -- we have\nnever taken that position.\nQUESTION: What is your position then?\nMR. BAIDA: That Virginia has riparian rights\nwith respect to the Potomac River.\nQUESTION: Which includes the right to use some\nof the water.\nMR. BAIDA: Correct.\nQUESTION: And take it out of the river.\nMR. BAIDA: Correct.\nQUESTION: With your permission.\nMR. BAIDA: Correct.\nQUESTION: But only with your permission.\nQUESTION: It's only the last step that's the\nproblem.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: Is that right? Only with Maryland's\npermission --\nMR. BAIDA: Subject to a standard of\nreasonableness, Justice O'Connor.\nQUESTION: Is that reasonableness in part\nassessed by the fact that Maryland is a sovereign?\nMR. BAIDA: It's --\nQUESTION: Pardon me.\nsovereign?\nMR. BAIDA: No. It's assessed by the fact that\nMaryland owns the river, but that Virginia, as -- as a\nriparian owner, has rights with respect to the river that\nMaryland must be reasonable with respect to which in its\nregulations.\nQUESTION: Virginia rights are -- Virginia\nrights are no greater than any private landowner?\nMR. BAIDA: That's precisely correct.\nQUESTION: Even -- even assuming that's true, I\n-- I thought a right is a right. I -- I thought we have a\nright to something. It doesn't mean somebody can turn it\ndown.\nMR. BAIDA: And -- and --\nQUESTION: And riparian rights include the right\nto take the water. That's clear.\nMR. BAIDA: And --\nQUESTION: And that's the right to take water,\nnot -- not the right to come and beg Maryland to take\nwater.\nMR. BAIDA: The river, Justice Scalia, is\nentirely within the State of Maryland, and that is\nundisputed from the -- the language of the Maryland\ncharter back from 1632. The entire river is in Maryland.\nQUESTION:\nof Virginia and its citizens riparian rights. If riparian\nrights include, as I think they do, the right to take\nwater, it seems to me that aspect of the case is -- is\nquite easy to decide.\nMR. BAIDA: Maryland's ownership of the Potomac\ngives it to right -- gives it the right to regulate what\ntakes place on and over the bed. There are riparian\nrights, but as this Court has recognized, those riparian\nrights have always been subject to government regulation.\nQUESTION: I'm mixed up. I'm sorry. Maybe -- I\ndidn't think the case was basically about taking water out\nof the river. I thought it was about building something\nfor the purpose of taking water out.\nMR. BAIDA: There --\nQUESTION: Is -- is it actually that you're\nsaying -- I may have misread this and so is it actually --\nyou're saying if -- if somebody -- if the Governor of\nVirginia goes to the river with a bucket and takes water,\na little bit of water, to wash some pans that he has, that\nthey have to get Maryland's permission? Is it about\ntaking the water out of the river? Is it about building\nsomething, or both?\nMR. BAIDA: It's about both.\nQUESTION: All right. So now you're just\naddressing the problem of taking water out of the river.\nSo can a person who lives next to a river under the common\nlaw from 1302 or whatever -- now, can he go to the river\nand just take some water when he's thirsty?\nMR. BAIDA: Yes.\nQUESTION: Yes. All right. So Virginia is just\ntaking water when they happen to have a lot of people who\nare thirsty.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: So what's the -- what's the special\nthing about the water? I thought it was building a water\nintake system.\nMR. BAIDA: It's -- it's about both. The right\nto build into the Potomac which the compact --\nQUESTION: All right. Let's imagine there were\nno building. Then would you have an objection?\nMR. BAIDA: Yes, because --\nQUESTION: Because you can't take water out when\nyou're thirsty.\nQUESTION: There are too many thirsty people is\nwhat your objection is. Right?\nMR. BAIDA: The -- the objection is simply that\nMaryland has the right to regulate what takes place in its\nterritory, and what takes place --\nQUESTION: It doesn't. What they do is they --\nthey build a -- a hole which fills up with the water from\nthe Potomac and that hole, which happens to be in\nVirginia, is filled up with water and they drink it. Now,\nis there any objection? They haven't built a thing.\nMR. BAIDA: I think that's a different question.\nThat's --\nQUESTION: No. I'm asking you, are you\nobjecting to the building or are you objecting separately\n-- because I hadn't focused on that -- to just taking\nwater without building anything?\nMR. BAIDA: If they're taking -- if they are --\nthe low-water mark on the Virginia side --\nQUESTION: No. They have nothing built over\nthere. What happens is water comes up out of the Potomac\ninto Virginia and they drink it.\nMR. BAIDA: But I'm trying to understand the\nnature of your question, Justice Breyer. When they build\na hole, are they building the hole in Virginia?\nQUESTION: In Virginia.\nMR. BAIDA: So they're building a trench in\nVirginia.\nQUESTION: Yes, that's right.\nMR. BAIDA: Maryland may have some objections to\nthat at some future point in time, but that's activity\nthat's taking place in Virginia.\nQUESTION: Yes.\nwas about.\nQUESTION: Unless the trench creates a new low-\nwater mark for the Potomac. I mean, I think that's what\nMaryland's argument would be, that when you make an inlet\ninto Virginia, that's -- that's the low-water mark of the\nPotomac.\nMR. BAIDA: Well, that may -- that -- I don't\nknow whether that would actually change the --\nQUESTION: I didn't want to get it mixed up.\nAll I wanted to do is I focused on this case as a matter\nof building something. I didn't focus on it as a matter\nof taking water out. And I'm -- and that's -- that was my\nproblem. Now, maybe just forget my problem. Maybe I'm\nthe only one who had it. So skip --\nQUESTION: Let -- let me ask you this. There's\na Potomac River Flow Allocation Agreement of 1978. Does\nit deal with the right of Virginia to use water or take it\nout?\nMR. BAIDA: That imposes restrictions on the\nthree major users of the Potomac River, the Washington\nAqueduct, the Army Corps of Engineers, the -- the Fairfax\nCounty Water Authority and the Washington Sanitary --\nSuburban Sanitary Commission, and imposes limitations on\nthe amount of water that they can take --\nQUESTION:\nMR. BAIDA: -- in periods of low flow.\nQUESTION: -- that water can and will be removed\nby Fairfax County?\nMR. BAIDA: Subject to a permitting system that\nwas in place at the time and still is in place. And the\nonly permitting system that's ever been in place with\nrespect to the Potomac River has been the permitting\nsystem established by the State of Maryland.\nAnd I think I'd like to just go back to the\ninitial point I tried to make at the beginning, which is\nwhy Maryland has the right to do what it's doing here.\nQUESTION: Before you do that, can I ask a\npractical question? How is Maryland, if it is, adversely\naffected by this pipe and the water intake? Is there any\nadverse impact on Maryland or is Maryland just trying to\nsay, we are the sovereign? So even though our people are\nnot being adversely affected, you need to get a permit\nfrom us. Is there any adverse impact on Maryland or its\nresidents?\nMR. BAIDA: Well, the Maryland administrative\nand judicial review proceedings answered that question\n\"no.\"\nBut the reason why Maryland took the -- the\naction that it did was because Fairfax County already had\nan existing waterway intake pipe in the -- in the river.\nThey wanted to build another intake pipe 725 feet into the\nriver, and the edge of it would be 30 inches above water\nwith a 5-foot walkway. Maryland took the position let's\nsee if there are less intrusive alternatives that are\navailable.\nVirginia wanted to do this. Fairfax County\nwanted to do this because it was concerned about the\neffect of the -- the water on the shoreline which is where\nthe existing intake pipe was and wanted to get cleaner\nwater from the -- from the middle of the river. And so\nMaryland took the view, well, let's see if there are less\nintrusive alternatives available, and --\nQUESTION: Why?\nQUESTION: Yes.\nQUESTION: Because -- because there wasn't\nenough water for the people in -- in Maryland? That's --\nit -- one thing is, well, we're sovereign and you -- we\nhave to give our permission. Another is our people are\nnot going to have enough water if Virginia does this. I\nthink you're saying Maryland had no such objection.\nMR. BAIDA: Maryland had no objection to the\nFairfax County Water Authority withdrawing water.\nMaryland's objection was to minimize the impact on the\nPotomac River.\nQUESTION:\nminimize the impact? The compact between the States gives\nthe State and its citizens riparian rights, including the\nright to build structures into the river so long as they\ndo not impede navigation. Was Maryland's objection that\n-- that this new structure would impede navigation of the\nriver? It's a -- it's above the navigable portion anyway,\nisn't it?\nMR. BAIDA: Yes, it is.\nQUESTION: So. So what was your objection?\nMR. BAIDA: Because the riparian rights that --\nQUESTION: It was ugly?\nMR. BAIDA: Well, there was -- that was part of\nit because it -- it was in the scenic portion of the\nPotomac River.\nQUESTION: Well, you should have reserved that\nright in the -- in the compact. The compact could have\nsaid, you know, provided it does not impede navigation or\nbe ugly.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. BAIDA: What the -- what the compact does,\nJustice Scalia, is it provides that the Potomac River\ncould be used as a common highway by the citizens of both\nStates, and it also secures important private property\nrights. Private property rights, again for the citizens\nof both States.\nQUESTION: All right. Let -- if I may, let me\ninterrupt you there. Do you concede that the State has\nany rights under article VII of the compact?\nMR. BAIDA: That the States?\nQUESTION: The State, the State of Virginia, the\nCommonwealth of Virginia. Article -- article VII talks\nabout citizens.\nMR. BAIDA: That --\nQUESTION: It doesn't talk about the\ncommonwealth.\nMR. BAIDA: That's exactly what this Court has\nsaid in --\nQUESTION: Well, is that -- I mean, is that a\npremise of your argument?\nMR. BAIDA: Yes.\nQUESTION: Do you -- do you also deny that the\nState with respect to withdrawal of water for its citizens\nthat the -- do you deny that the State stands in the shoes\nof its citizens?\nMR. BAIDA: The -- the State -- the Commonwealth\nof Virginia brought this action on behalf of its citizens\nto seek --\nQUESTION: No. I realize that, but are you\ndenying that it may properly do that?\nMR. BAIDA: No. No, we are not.\nQUESTION: So, in effect, are you saying the\nState -- it -- it is just as though the State had express\nrights under article VII because in making the claim that\nit's making, it stands in the shoes of its citizens, and\nits citizens do have rights. Is -- is that -- do you\nconcede that?\nMR. BAIDA: Yes. The -- we've never denied that\nthe --\nQUESTION: Then it's irrelevant that the -- that\narticle VII speaks only of citizens and not of the State.\nIs that correct?\nMR. BAIDA: No, it's not irrelevant, Justice --\nQUESTION: Then what -- what difference does it\nmake?\nMR. BAIDA: Because all that the compact does,\nit secures -- it -- it makes a -- there is -- the compact\ndrafters recognized the difference between jurisdiction\nand sovereignty and private property rights, and when they\nwanted to, they knew exactly how to go about addressing\nissues of sovereignty.\nQUESTION: Now, one of my questions in this case\nis this. You've answered Justice Souter and he posed his\nquestions this way based on article VII or paragraph --\nclause VII of -- of the compact. But must we not\ninterpret that too according to the Black-Jenkins Award,\nparticularly paragraph 4 at page C-4 of -- of the -- of\nthe Special Master's appendices? That uses the -- that\nsays Virginia -- not citizens. That says Virginia has\nriparian rights, and both of those two phrases are not\nused in the compact. The phrase, riparian rights, I don't\nthink is used in the compact, and the compact talks about\ncitizens.\nBut the Black-Jenkins Award goes -- it seems to\nme, interprets authoritatively -- and you correct me if\nI'm wrong -- what the compact means. And I read the Black\n-- at least I think it's a permissible reading -- to say\nthat Virginia -- and we'll argue about as a sovereign.\nThat -- that's -- that's a phrase I add -- has riparian\nrights. So we really do have to focus not just on section\nVII, but on part 4 of the Black-Jenkins Award, do we not?\nMR. BAIDA: Yes. And we -- Maryland's view is\nthat that part of the award confirms Maryland's rights\nover the river. And I'd like to explain this a little bit\nmore fully.\nWhat the Black-Jenkins arbitrators did was they\nrejected Virginia's claim to any right in the soil -- any\nright in the soil -- beyond the water mark, any right to\nany of the islands in the river, and any right to any part\nof the bed of the river. Now --\nQUESTION:\nout, that Virginia was given a proprietary right and a\nprivilege to erect any structures necessary to the full\nenjoyment of Virginia's riparian ownership, which\npresumably encompasses taking out water.\nMR. BAIDA: And the presumption, Justice\nO'Connor, is overcome by looking at the rest of the award,\nand what the -- the arbitrators did, they did give\nVirginia title to the middle of other bodies of water,\nnamely the -- the Tangier Sound, the Pocomoke Sound, and\nthe Pocomoke River. But they specifically rejected --\nQUESTION: Yes, but do you deny that Virginia\nhas riparian ownership up to the low-water mark of the\nPotomac?\nMR. BAIDA: The arbitrators said that Virginia\nhas full dominion over this right in the soil up to low-\nwater mark, but beyond that point, Virginia only has a\nright to use the river. A right of use is not dominion,\nit's not title, it's not sovereignty.\nQUESTION: But it says --\nQUESTION: Why? But it is a right of use, and\nthat's what you're -- and that's what you're contradicting\nhere. That's all they want. They're not trying to govern\nthe river. They just want to use it.\nMR. BAIDA: A right of use, Justice Scalia, is\nsubject to governmental authority and regulation, and\nthat's exactly what this Court said --\nQUESTION: Well, but it says here in the Black-\nJenkins Award and in the earlier compact, the privilege to\nerect structures necessary to the full enjoyment of the\nriparian ownership. That might mean a pipe to take water\nout.\nMR. BAIDA: This Court has said in, for example,\nMassachusetts v. New York that Massachusetts' right to use\nLake Ontario was still subject to the regulatory authority\nof New York because New York had title to the bed of Lake\nOntario.\nQUESTION: Mr. Baida, can I ask you sort of a\nbasic question? In your view is there any difference\nbetween the right that Virginia has, the riparian rights\nof Virginia, on the one hand, and the riparian rights of\nMaryland's citizens who -- who own the property on the\nMaryland shore of the river? Do -- are they equivalent?\nOr what is the difference between the riparian rights of\nthe people on the opposite sides of the river?\nMR. BAIDA: The -- Maryland is to treat them\nidentically, and that's set forth clearly in article VII\nof the compact.\nQUESTION: So that either -- on either side of\nthe river, a property owner could stick a pipe in and\ndrain the river.\nMR. BAIDA: Not -- not if it has any kind of\nadverse impact from Maryland's perspective, whether it's\nin Maryland -- if -- if the City of Rockville wanted to do\nthis, it would encounter presumably exactly the same kind\nof reaction that Fairfax County initially did.\nQUESTION: You say the riparian rights on either\nside of the river are subject to the paramount authority\nof the Maryland -- the State of Maryland to -- to govern\nwhat happens to the water.\nMR. BAIDA: Yes.\nQUESTION: And -- and in the exercise of that\nauthority, could Maryland give a higher priority to the\ncitizens of Rockville than to the citizens of Vienna,\nVirginia?\nMR. BAIDA: No, and this Court said in Yates v.\nMilwaukee that -- that the riparian right cannot be\narbitrarily and capriciously denied. And that --\nQUESTION: No. It's not arbitrary and\ncapricious. They make a lot of findings and they said\nthere's too much traffic in Virginia. Virginia would be\nbetter off if it's rural.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. BAIDA: Well, Your Honor, I think --\nQUESTION: And -- and what is -- what is the\nsource for your statement that Maryland has to be non-\narbitrary? Is this riparian water law or is this some\nconstitutional obligation that one State owes to another?\nMR. BAIDA: I -- I think it's again set forth in\nYates v. Milwaukee where the Court said that a State\ncannot -- or a government -- municipality cannot\narbitrarily and capriciously deny someone the exercise of\na riparian right.\nQUESTION: So in your opinion --\nQUESTION: But -- but that's based on -- on --\nthat's a statement of riparian law?\nMR. BAIDA: Yes. I think -- I mean, it's a\nproperty right. It is a property right, and it can't be\narbitrarily --\nQUESTION: So we're talking about -- all we're\ntalking about is property rights here. We're just talking\nabout the definition of what a riparian right is.\nMR. BAIDA: Yes.\nAnd just so I'm clear, Justice Kennedy, the rule\nof law, not administrative hyperbole, is what governed the\njudicial and the administrative review proceedings that\nled to Fairfax County getting this waterway intake pipe\npermit. I mean, it -- there was -- it went through the\nprocess. Maryland thought it had valid reasons for\nrestricting the -- the permit, and Maryland was -- was\noverruled, and the permit has since issued. And so this\nis not a case of Maryland just arbitrarily deciding, well,\nwe don't like what's happening over there, and -- and\nthen --\nQUESTION: So your opinion is --\nQUESTION: You -- you used the word arbitrary.\nI didn't. I just want to know the source of law which\ngoverns Maryland's obligation under your point of -- under\nyour submission to make these determinations. And you\nsaid it has to just be fair among riparian owners because\nthis is what riparian law requires it to do.\nMR. BAIDA: And I think it's also required by\nthe Constitution.\nQUESTION: Your -- your point --\nQUESTION: What provision of the Constitution?\nMR. BAIDA: I think the Due Process Clause.\nMaryland just can't arbitrarily and -- and capriciously\ndeprive someone of a property right.\nQUESTION: Oh, but that's just an obligation it\nhas as to all of its citizens. Virginia doesn't have any\nspecial standing as a State.\nMR. BAIDA: No. And -- and again, it's because\nof what Maryland gave up in this compact and -- and what\nthe Black-Jenkins Award provided.\nAnd again, we have to go back -- and the -- the\nproblem with -- with the Special Master's recommendation\nfrom Maryland's perspective is that he began at the wrong\nplace in history. He began with the compact. He should\nhave begun with the charter because the plain language of\nthe charter gives Maryland this river, and -- and so the\nquestion at that point, since Maryland owns this river,\nMaryland does have sovereign authority over it. So --\nQUESTION: What was wrong with the Special\nMaster saying, yes, Maryland has this 1632 decree. It\nlooks -- this grant. It looks pretty good. But Virginia\nhas these other grants. And I think that they're both\narguable. So the States sensibly twice dealt with it.\nBut your argument seems to hang on that 1632\ndocument indisputably was it, and that everything else\nflows from there. The Special Master said, not\nnecessarily so. They couldn't even resolve it in 1785.\nThey finally resolved it in 1877, but it wasn't an\ninevitable truth that it was 1632 rather than the Virginia\ngrants.\nMR. BAIDA: Justice Ginsburg, the -- the flaw in\nthe reasoning is that it ignores the plain language of the\ncharter which this Court said includes the Potomac River\nin unmistakable terms to the further bank. It doesn't\nmatter what kind of competing claims existed as of 1785\nwhen the compact was written.\nWhat matters is who had title, and under\nVirginia's view, Maryland was a -- this -- Maryland was\nbasically a deed holder. This was a royal deed, and under\nVirginia's view, this royal deed could not create rights\nuntil it was interpreted by either the arbitrators or this\nCourt.\nQUESTION: But there were other royal deeds too,\ndifferent kings, but there were royal decrees that -- that\nVirginia had.\nMR. BAIDA: Which this Court noted did not do\nanything to divest Maryland of the authority it had under\nthe -- Maryland was first in time. First in line, first\nin time. And so it had it in 1632. There was a\nsubsequent deed that was given by --\nQUESTION: I thought there was -- the earliest\nin time was in, wasn't it, 1609 or something? The --\nMR. BAIDA: But in -- yes, in 1609 Virginia was\ninitially set up but then its charter was annulled in\n1624. It converted to a royal colony which meant that\nKing Charles I in 1632 had the right to carve Maryland out\nof Virginia, which is what he did. He created Maryland as\na proprietorial colony. At that point, the only way that\nMaryland could lose any rights it had under its charter\nwas through a quo warranto proceeding. It was initiated\nin 1685. It never resulted in anything, as the\narbitrators in 1877 noted.\nQUESTION: But -- but are you saying that the\ncompact in 1785 and the Black-Jenkins Award in 18 -- were\n-- were simply wrong because they didn't follow that\ninterpretation that you're giving now?\nMR. BAIDA: No, I'm not saying the compact was\nwrong at all, Mr. Chief --\nQUESTION: Are you saying the Black-Jenkins\nAward was wrong?\nMR. BAIDA: No. The -- I think -- all -- all\nI'm saying is that Maryland had this authority as a result\nof the plain language in the charter.\nQUESTION: Well, are you saying that the\nimplicit assumption at least of both the 1877 Black-\nJenkins Award and the 1785 compact -- the implicit, if not\nexplicit, assumption was that Maryland owned the river?\nMR. BAIDA: No. I think a fair reading of that\ndocument -- of -- of the -- the 1785 compact and the 1877\naward was that reasonable minds may have differed. And so\nthe States decided this is how we're going to address\nissues of navigation.\nQUESTION: Well, but I thought I was arguing --\nmaking your argument for you. So -- so you -- but then,\nit seems to me, that justifies the Special Master's\napproach. You -- I thought you were saying, oh, now, he\nproceeded on the wrong premise. This -- the -- the\nboundary line was settled. All -- all we're talking about\nis -- is the rights -- or -- or ownership and stuff. But\nyou're saying no. If it's everything is up for grabs,\nthen the 1785 compact and the Black-Jenkins Award, what do\nwe look to?\nMR. BAIDA: If I said that, let me retrieve it\nimmediately because that was not what I meant to say.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. BAIDA: What I -- what I meant to say was\nthat Maryland's title has not changed one iota in almost\n400 years.\nQUESTION: Mr. Baida, maybe I'm missing\nsomething here, but I did not understand that the State of\nVirginia is contesting the ownership of Maryland of the\nbed of the river. Is -- is that -- is that contested by\nVirginia? I thought that they concede that the river\nright up to the low-water mark on the southern shore of\nthe Virginia shore belongs to Maryland. But that -- but\nthat does not answer the question of whether the riparian\nrights given to the citizens of Virginia and to the State\nof Virginia requires that -- that they obtain permission\nfrom Maryland before withdrawing water or creating a\nstructure to withdraw water.\nMR. BAIDA: I agree, Justice Scalia, but it goes\na long way in resolving that question because by\nacknowledging that -- that the boundary is not in dispute,\nby acknowledging that Maryland does, indeed, have title to\nthis river, Virginia has acknowledged Maryland's\nregulatory authority --\nQUESTION: No, it hasn't because it --\nQUESTION: No, it hasn't.\nQUESTION: But it's all -- it's all subject to\nthe fact that the owners on both sides of the river have\nriparian rights. Right?\nMR. BAIDA: Correct.\nQUESTION: Now, my question -- Justice Kennedy\nasked it earlier, and I'm not sure you got an answer. Who\ndefines the riparian rights? I guess on Maryland's side\nof the river Maryland can define the riparian rights. Who\ndefines the riparian rights on the Virginia side of the\nriver? Do you think Maryland has the authority to do\nthat, or is there a common law that's binding on us or\nsome kind of overriding Federal constitutional principle\nat stake?\nMR. BAIDA: I think a fair reading of the\ncompact is that both States agreed that they couldn't\nagree on where the boundary was, and so they decided --\nQUESTION: I think the fair reading is that\neverybody thought there would be plenty of water, so we\ndidn't have to decide this. All we're worried about is\ntransportation down the river, and it's not -- and now\nwe've got a -- a possible problem on what is enough water\nto go around.\nMR. BAIDA: And -- and --\nQUESTION: And I don't know that the compact\naddresses the question of who defines the riparian rights\non the Virginia side of the river.\nMR. BAIDA: And I think that both States agreed\nthat wherever the boundary was, the citizens of both\nStates would have the same rights of access to the river.\nAnd -- and for that reason, they -- they --\nQUESTION: Does that mean that because Maryland\ncan define the rights on the Maryland side of the river,\nit may also define them on the Virginia side?\nMR. BAIDA: I think that the -- the view -- a\nfair reading would be that wherever the boundary was --\nQUESTION: But is it your contention that that's\nwhat it is?\nMR. BAIDA: If -- if at the end of the day the\nboundary is on Virginia's side, yes, Maryland gets to\ndecide because it's activity occurring in Maryland. This\nis Maryland --\nQUESTION: What if -- what if the Virginia\nlegislature passed a statute governing riparian rights on\n-- all over the State in other bodies of water, not\nlimited to the Potomac? Could that statute govern the\nriparian rights of Virginia property owners on the\nPotomac?\nMR. BAIDA: Not if Virginia does not own the\nPotomac. And I'd like to --\nQUESTION: May I ask just one quick question\nbefore you sit down?\nQUESTION: I just think it's not --\nQUESTION: Does -- does Maryland require\nVirginia's citizens to have a Maryland fishing license to\nfish in the Potomac?\nMR. BAIDA: No, because that's settled by\narticle -- I think article VIII of the compact.\nQUESTION: It just says that they have rights to\nfish, but just as you argue that riparian rights and\nrights to take water can, nonetheless, require prior\npermission, you could also take the -- you ought to also\ntake the position that the right to fish requires prior\npermission. So you ought to get a Maryland fish -- I'm\ndarned if I'm going to get a Maryland fishing right --\nfishing license --\nQUESTION: Do you want to reserve the rest of\nyour time, Mr. Baida?\nMR. BAIDA: I would. Thank you, Mr. Chief\nJustice.\nQUESTION: Very well.\nMr. Raphael, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF STUART A. RAPHAEL\nON BEHALF OF THE DEFENDANT\nMR. RAPHAEL: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe Special Master correctly decided the\nregulation issue for two reasons. First, the language of\nthe compacts in question is plain and unambiguous, and\nsecond, for more than 180 years, Maryland never disputed\nthat it was entirely --\nQUESTION: Does that plain language tell us what\nriparian rights are?\nMR. RAPHAEL: The plain language of article IV\nof the Black-Jenkins Award uses the term riparian\nownership.\nQUESTION: But you said plain language of the\ncompact, and now you're all of a sudden talking about\nBlack-Jenkins.\nMR. RAPHAEL: It's both.\nQUESTION: The compact does not use the word\nriparian.\nMR. RAPHAEL: That -- That's correct. But we\nthink that the plain language --\nQUESTION:\nthe compact with the gloss of the Black-Jenkins Award.\nMR. RAPHAEL: We think it's both.\nQUESTION: What do you make -- and I don't have\nthis in front of me, so maybe I -- I'm missing something.\nBut I thought the Black-Jenkins Award also put a --\nincluded a disclaimer that it wasn't, in fact, modifying\nanything in the 1785 compact. Am I right?\nMR. RAPHAEL: That's -- that's correct because\nthe enabling legislation for the Black-Jenkins Award\nprovided that neither of the States would be deprived of\nany of the rights or privileges, nor would the citizens be\ndeprived of rights or privileges that they had under the\nCompact of 1785.\nQUESTION: How -- I'm sorry.\nAssuming that then, how do we get from the\nlanguage of article VII in the compact that refers to\ncitizens to the language in Black-Jenkins that talks about\nthe States?\nMR. RAPHAEL: Your Honor, the citizens in\nVirginia only had those rights under the compact because\nVirginia as a sovereign entered into an interstate compact\nwith Maryland.\nSecondly, Maryland recognized in the enabling\nlegislation that provided for the Black-Jenkins Award that\nthe rights were the rights not only of citizens, but of\nthe States. That language is used in the enabling act.\nQUESTION: So you -- you say that in\ninterpreting the Black-Jenkins Award, Virginia's riparian\nownership is -- is defined by its -- in part by its\nsovereign status?\nMR. RAPHAEL: Yes, that's correct.\nQUESTION: So that sovereignty is inherent in\nownership?\nMR. RAPHAEL: I think that's correct. If -- if\nyou look at the opinion that accompanied the Black-Jenkins\nAward, the arbitrators said that Virginia had proven her\nuse of the Potomac River since her earliest days and that\nher rights were, therefore, indisputable and that Maryland\nassented to Virginia's use when she signed the Compact of\n1785.\nNow, that compact, Your Honor, was entered into\nat a time when the boundary was disputed, and regardless\nof where the boundary was set -- I think Mr. Baida admits\nthis -- it was recognized that that compact did not set\nthe boundary, but each State agreed that wherever the\nboundary ultimately would be set, the citizens of each\nState and the States themselves would have certain rights,\nand those rights included the right to property in the\nshores, and all advantages and emoluments thereunto\nbelonging, and the privilege of making and carrying out\nwharfs and other improvements.\nQUESTION: Except for the sense of the document,\nat least of the compact, as I read it, is that the State\nis treated just like any other owner.\nMR. RAPHAEL: I don't think that that's correct,\nYour Honor, because article --\nQUESTION: Well, can you point me to\nsomething --\nMR. RAPHAEL: Yes.\nQUESTION: -- in the compacts or the -- or the\nBlack-Jenkins Award to the contrary?\nMR. RAPHAEL: Well, the Black-Jenkins Award\nclearly deals with Virginia as a State. The compact deals\nwith Virginia as a State in article VIII, for example,\nwhere it requires that neither State could regulate\nfishing or navigation without the concurrence of the other\nState. Articles X and XI and XII also deal with the\nrights of the citizens. Wherever the compact involved a\nmatter in which a State would touch the activities of the\ncitizens of the other State, it said so expressly.\nAnd it's inconceivable to think that the -- the\ndrafters of the compact would have agreed that concurrent\nlegislation would be required for fishing and navigation,\nbut Maryland could somehow regulate Virginia's right to\nbuild improvements from the shore. It's inconceivable\nthat they would have ratified the compact if that had been\nrequired.\nQUESTION: Why -- why is it concurrent for\nfishing? Article seventh says that the -- that the\ncitizens of both States -- the right of fishing in the\nriver shall be common to and equally enjoyed by the\ncitizens of both States.\nMR. RAPHAEL: That's correct, Your Honor.\nArticle VIII requires concurrent legislation for fishing\nand navigation rules in the Potomac River.\nQUESTION: For the preservation of fish or for\nthe performance -- for preserving and keeping open the\nchannel?\nMR. RAPHAEL: That's correct.\nQUESTION: Has -- has Virginia issued -- is a\nVirginia fishing license valid in the -- in the Potomac?\nMR. RAPHAEL: Your Honor, until 1957, the States\nhad concurrent legislation governing fishing in the\nPotomac River. In 1957 -- and that was based on article\nVIII of the compact. In 1957, Maryland attempted to\nabrogate that requirement and to assume unilateral\nauthority over the Potomac River. Virginia filed suit\nhere. This Court appointed a special master to hear the\ncase. The States resolved their dispute as to the tidal\nPotomac with the creation of the Potomac River Fisheries\nCommission, which is a bi-State agency that now regulates\nfishing in the -- in the tidal Potomac.\nAs to the non-tidal Potomac, since 1957 each\nState has had laws on the books that recognize permits\nissued or licenses issued to citizens of the other State\nas valid licenses for fishing in the non-tidal Potomac.\nQUESTION: What's left of the dispute now? Is\n-- does Virginia now have a permit to withdraw the water?\nMR. RAPHAEL: The -- the permit, Justice\nO'Connor, was issued to the Fairfax County Water\nAuthority.\nQUESTION: Yes. Is that all you're arguing\nabout?\nMR. RAPHAEL: No, Your Honor, because we contend\nthat no permit was required in the first instance, and we\nalso challenged that specific permit because the Maryland\nlegislature required that it contain a condition requiring\nthe water authority to put a flow restrictor into the\npipeline for the sole purpose, the Maryland legislature\nsaid, of allowing Maryland to control growth and\ndevelopment in northern Virginia. We object to that. The\nauthority objected to that subject to the outcome in this\ncase. We object to any --\nQUESTION: So we're -- we're talking now about a\nflow restrictor in the pipe?\nMR. RAPHAEL: That's correct.\nQUESTION: I mean, that's what it comes down to.\nMR. RAPHAEL: That's correct. And --\nQUESTION: Well, but Virginia objects on general\nprinciple, I take it, to the idea that Maryland can\nrestrict the amount of water it takes out of -- of the\nPotomac.\nMR. RAPHAEL: That's exactly right, and I don't\nmean to say my answer is limited to just the Fairfax\nCounty Water Authority. We object to the continuation by\nMaryland of a permit system that requires Virginia to get\nMaryland's permission anytime we want to withdraw water\nfrom the Potomac River or build improvements appurtenant\nto the shore.\nQUESTION: But do you -- what about the general\nright of a riparian owner on a river to withdraw water?\nWould you say that right includes the right to withdraw an\nunlimited quantity of water?\nMR. RAPHAEL: I don't believe that that would be\na riparian right, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Well, then who decides what limit can\nbe -- can be imposed on the riparian owner's right to\nwithdraw water?\nMR. RAPHAEL: With respect to the Potomac River,\nthere's a low flow allocation agreement in place that\nCongress required which allocates the flows during periods\nof low flow. There is a water coordination agreement of\n1982 in place by which the three main utilities in the\nDistrict of Columbia have agreed to provide for a future\nwater supply.\nThis Court said in Colorado --\nQUESTION: But assume there are no agreements.\nQUESTION: -- riparian question that's not\ncontrolled by those documents.\nQUESTION: Assume there are no agreements at\nall. Would Maryland have the right to say no more than X\namount of water may be withdrawn by any riparian owner in\nMaryland or Virginia?\nMR. RAPHAEL: No. We don't believe they do have\nthat right.\nQUESTION: Could you drain the river?\nMR. RAPHAEL: Not under the low flow agreement\nand not under the water supply coordination agreement,\nabsolutely not.\nQUESTION: No. But let's assume there were\nnone.\nQUESTION: We've -- in some original\njurisdiction cases, we have decided on amounts of water.\nIn fact, in the Texas against New Mexico case, there's a\n-- there's a river master on the Pecos River operating\nunder one of our decrees.\nMR. RAPHAEL: Yes, Mr. Chief Justice. This\nCourt said in Colorado v. New Mexico that before this\nCourt will enjoin any State from diverting water from the\nPotomac River, the State --\nQUESTION: Well, they weren't talking about the\nPotomac River.\nMR. RAPHAEL: I'm sorry. That was the Vermejo\nRiver. This Court requires a showing that the diversion\nwould cause clear -- by clear and convincing evidence that\nthe diversion would cause injury to the State seeking to\nprevent the diversion.\nIn this case, Maryland has circumvented that\nrequirement by controlling the tap. Maryland doesn't\ncontend that anything Virginia has done to date injures\nthe river.\nQUESTION: No, but I mean, your -- your --\nQUESTION: If they did so contend, could they\nenforce that contention?\nMR. RAPHAEL: There -- there would be many\nplaces where they can raise that issue if Virginia\nprevails in this case. They can raise it in the context\nof the Federal and Virginia permitting requirements, the\n404 and section 10 permitting requirements.\nQUESTION:\nhave an original jurisdiction case involving a fight\nbetween two States. And assume nobody had made any\nagreements other than those determining the ownership of\nthis river. Would then Maryland have no right to -- to\nlimit the amount that Virginia could withdraw?\nMR. RAPHAEL: If -- if Maryland has a claim that\nVirginia's withdrawals injure it, it has a place where it\ncan raise that claim.\nQUESTION: And that's here.\nQUESTION: That's --\nMR. RAPHAEL: It could be here.\nQUESTION: -- just what it's doing here.\nMR. RAPHAEL: It could be in the Army Corps of\nEngineers permitting process.\nQUESTION: Now, well, let's -- let's forget\nthe --\nQUESTION: -- findings. I'm trying to put to --\nQUESTION: Assuming that the one --\nQUESTION: -- one side all the agreements and\njust have a brand new problem. Maryland or Virginia are\nfighting about who can control withdrawals of water from\nthis river. And is there any principle that -- that says\nthat someone other than the owner of the river can make\nthat decision?\nMR. RAPHAEL:\nthat, as this Court said in Colorado v. New Mexico. The\nfact that that the river was in Colorado didn't give\nColorado a right to withdraw water from that river.\nQUESTION: Well, Virginia would have the same\nclaim against Maryland if Maryland took out too much\nwater.\nMR. RAPHAEL: Yes, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: And that's Federal common law because\ntwo States are involved?\nMR. RAPHAEL: That's correct. They're co-equal\nsovereigns contending about an interstate river that\nsupplies water to the citizens of -- of both States.\nQUESTION: All right. Let --\nQUESTION: What about a citizen of Virginia who\nowns property on the -- up to the low-water mark of the\nriver and wants to build a dock and a pier out, that\nextends out into the river? Does that citizen have to get\npermission from Maryland to do that?\nMR. RAPHAEL: Under -- under our view of the\ncase, no, because the compact gave that citizen the right\nto do it, subject to Federal regulations, subject to\nVirginia regulation. And Maryland can contend either in\nthe permitting process or independently that any action by\na Virginia citizen that -- that it can show causes injury\nto Maryland shouldn't be allowed. But --\nQUESTION: Is that what the Special Master\nspecifically held in your view?\nMR. RAPHAEL: The Master ruled that under the\ncompact and the award, Virginia and its citizens have the\nright to withdraw water and to construct improvements\nappurtenant to the shore without having to get permission\nfrom Maryland. Yes.\nQUESTION: What if Maryland takes the position\nthat it obstructs navigation? Who's going to decide that?\nVirginia?\nMR. RAPHAEL: No, Your Honor. The primary place\nwill these -- where these disputes will be decided is in\nthe -- as a practical matter is in the Federal permitting\nprocess. It's very much like then-Associate Justice\nRehnquist wrote for the Court in Milwaukee v. Illinois,\nthat the Federal permitting process -- that was a -- a\nFederal water pollution control act case -- that the\nFederal permitting process provides an adequate forum for\nthe State to raise concerns that it has about --\nQUESTION: Because this is a navigable river,\nthe Federal Government has such a scheme in place.\nMR. RAPHAEL: That's exactly right.\nQUESTION: But if -- if it did not, I -- I take\nit the answer would be in -- in a Federal question suit\nbrought by Maryland against the Virginia citizen?\nMR. RAPHAEL: That's correct.\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. RAPHAEL: I think the key evidence of -- let\nme move beyond what we think is -- is the plain language\nand -- and discuss also what the Master looked at with\nrespect to Maryland's practice historically.\nThe -- the key evidence here comes from 1873.\nThis is at a time when Maryland and Virginia were trying\nto settle their boundary dispute. In the boundary\narbitration, Maryland contended that the boundary line\nshould be on the Virginia side at the low-water mark and\ngo around any improvements then existing or which, quote,\nmay hereafter be extended by authority of Virginia,\nunquote. That's at page 130 of the Virginia lodging.\nIn the Maryland view in 1873 and in the view\nthey maintained in the arbitration, it was entirely up to\nVirginia to decide when, whether, and where to build\nimprovements from the shore. And they actually thought\nthat would alter the boundary line.\nQUESTION: Could you answer this question for\nme? And in part, I'm going back on the ground that we've\nbeen traversing already.\nWhat is there in -- in the documents before us\n-- by that, I mean the compact and the Black-Jenkins\nagreement, number one, or in the law generally, number two\n-- that gives Virginia special rights as a sovereign to\nwithdraw water for its people as opposed to the right it\nwould have simply as an owner of -- of property to\nwithdrawal rights for that property that it owns?\nMR. RAPHAEL: I think, Your Honor, all of the\nCourt's equitable apportionment cases recognize that the\nState has a sovereign interest in protecting the water\nsupply of its citizens where that water supply is served\nby an interstate river.\nQUESTION: But -- but those are cases -- correct\nme if I'm wrong -- in which the State owns out to the --\nto the centerline of the river.\nMR. RAPHAEL: Most of the cases --\nQUESTION: Correct me if I'm wrong.\nMR. RAPHAEL: Justice Kennedy, most of the cases\ninvolve a river which goes from one State into another\nState, and we don't --\nQUESTION: Yes, in which each State has an\ninterest in the river. But here --\nMR. RAPHAEL: That's right.\nQUESTION: -- Virginia owns only to the -- to\nthe low-water mark. And I want you to show -- tell me\nsomething in these documents which says that Virginia has\na special right -- special rights as a sovereign --\nMR. RAPHAEL: Article IV of the Black-Jenkins --\nQUESTION: -- other than what I just -- other\nthan we know that Virginia is a party.\nMR. RAPHAEL: Your Honor, article IV of the\nBlack-Jenkins Award says Virginia has a right to the use\nof the river beyond the line of low-water mark as being --\nas may be necessary to the full enjoyment of her riparian\nownership. And Maryland stipulated --\nQUESTION: But her -- but does her riparian\nownership give it any rights that are different and\ngreater than a private owner of land?\nMR. RAPHAEL: Absolutely. It absolutely does.\nQUESTION: And what is the source?\nQUESTION: And -- and what is your support for\nthat proposition?\nMR. RAPHAEL: This Court's Federal common law\ncases that distinguish between the rights of States with\nrespect to a water supply and the rights of individual\ncitizens.\nQUESTION: But those are cases in which the\nStates have an ownership interest -- an equal ownership\ninterest in the river.\nMR. RAPHAEL: I don't think that --\nQUESTION: And is just riparian ownership.\nMR. RAPHAEL: Colorado v. New Mexico is a good\nexample.\nColorado, and it then flowed into New Mexico. But this\nCourt effectively denied Colorado any use of that river\nregardless of the fact that she owned the river.\nOwnership is not dispositive in -- in a dispute between\nStates over a -- a water supply that supplies the citizens\nof both States.\nNow, the Potomac River is an interstate river.\nThe Congress recognized that in 1976 when it required the\nwaters to be allocated. A drop of water that begins in\nthe Shenandoah is not a Virginia drop of water anymore\nthan it's a Maryland drop of water when it's in the main\nstem of the Potomac.\nQUESTION: I think at the -- I think at the\nleast, would you concede or would you -- that the Black-\nJenkins agreement goes a step beyond the -- the compact in\nthis regard?\nMR. RAPHAEL: We think it's at least coextensive\nwith the compact, but I -- I don't -- I think that that\nposition would be defensible but it does go beyond --\nQUESTION: Well, isn't it --\nQUESTION: But you --\nQUESTION: -- isn't it limiting in this extent?\nThere is something in this fourth article of the Black --\nof the 1877 arbitration award that refers to without --\nwithout impeding navigation -- that's been there\nthroughout -- or otherwise interfering with the proper use\nof it by Maryland. What would those words suggest other\nthan Maryland can permit the use to assure that its proper\nuse is not interfered with?\nMR. RAPHAEL: Your Honor, those words give\nMaryland a right of action and a cause of action against\nVirginia or the user if it -- if the use interferes with\nMaryland's use of the river. That doesn't mean Maryland\ngets to decide. No State can control another State's\naccess to the water supply and no State can be a party to\na dispute and -- and then fairly decide that dispute.\nQUESTION: But you are depending then on what\nyou referred to as Federal common law and not the words of\nthe compact and not the words of -- of the -- the Black-\nJenkins.\nMR. RAPHAEL: No. Your Honor, we rely on -- on\nthe -- the plain language of the compact and the Black-\nJenkins Award which clearly give Virginia the right to the\nuse of the --\nQUESTION: But I -- I thought when Justice\nKennedy pressed you, your -- you ultimately rested on\nFederal common law.\nMR. RAPHAEL: My understanding of Justice\nKennedy's question was whether there's a distinction\nbetween riparian -- the rights of -- of riparian users as\nprivate users and the rights of States as riparians. And\nI was answering that question that yes, there is a\ndifference, as this Court has repeatedly said. The civil\nlaw as between riparian users does not bind States with\nrespect to their use of an interstate stream. That was\nthe question I -- I was answering.\nQUESTION: Mr. Raphael, what -- it's your\nposition that if -- I believe, that if a private\nlandowner, riparian owner on the Virginia side, the\nsouthern shore, wants to build a pier out into the river,\nthat pier would be permitted by Virginia?\nMR. RAPHAEL: That's correct.\nQUESTION: Why?\nMR. RAPHAEL: It --\nQUESTION: You see, I can understand the\nauthority for Maryland to permit it since Maryland owns\nthe river bed. What -- what is the authority for Virginia\nto demand a permit from its riparian owners?\nMR. RAPHAEL: Virginia has the right to regulate\nits citizens' use of the river, and it -- it has been\ndoing that for many years through the local building\npermit requirement that you can't build a -- a pier or a\nwharf on the Virginia side, even though it goes beyond\nlow-water mark, without getting a -- a building permit\nfrom the -- from the county.\nQUESTION: Because of its State riparian\nsovereignty over -- because of its State sovereignty over\nthe bank.\nMR. RAPHAEL: That's correct. And Virginia has\nenacted, subject to the resolution of this case, a -- the\nVirginia water permit protection requirement applicable to\nVirginia users of the river. So if -- if Virginia\nprevails in this case, Maryland will regulate its users of\nthe river and Virginia will regulate its users of the\nriver.\nQUESTION: But what if there's a -- a pier going\nout into the river that's been there for 5 years and the\nowner wants to modify it, wants to build something more at\nthe end of the pier? From whom would he get authority to\ndo that?\nMR. RAPHAEL: He would get that authority from\nVirginia.\nQUESTION: But that's -- it's in the State of\nMaryland.\nMR. RAPHAEL: The -- the construction --\nQUESTION: The end of the pier I'm talking\nabout.\nMR. RAPHAEL: Your Honor --\nQUESTION: The pier is not part of Virginia, is\nit?\nMR. RAPHAEL: The pier is appurtenant to\nproperty on the Virginia shore, and --\nQUESTION: Yes, but the pier is located in the\nState of Maryland.\nMR. RAPHAEL: That's correct.\nQUESTION: Then why wouldn't he have to get the\nauthority to make the modification from the State of\nMaryland? I guess the -- when they enforce the gaming\nlaws or whatever they are, the Maryland police are the\nones that have jurisdiction, aren't they?\nMR. RAPHAEL: I think you have -- we distinguish\nbetween uses that are riparian and uses that are not\nriparian. 99 percent of everything that's ever been built\nthere --\nQUESTION: Well, repairing the end of a pier, is\nthat a riparian use or a non-riparian?\nMR. RAPHAEL: That would be a riparian use.\nOperating a casino on the pier would not be a riparian\nuse, and that's why Virginia has not objected to a wide\nvariety of activities by Maryland on its side of the line\nthat don't go to whether Virginia has the right to build\nthe riparian structure in the first place.\nQUESTION: And for that answer, I take it, you\n-- you do rest on article VII of the 1785 compact.\nMR. RAPHAEL: Article VII and article IV of the\nBlack-Jenkins Award.\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. RAPHAEL: That's correct.\nQUESTION: What about operating a fishing pier,\ncharging for -- who -- who would have the authority to tax\nthe fishing pier? Is that a riparian use or not riparian?\nMR. RAPHAEL: Well, there may be uses that are\nin between in gray as to whether it's a riparian use --\nQUESTION: Yes. I tried to pick one.\nMR. RAPHAEL: Let me -- here's -- I'm not sure\nhow the question would be answered, but let me tell you\nwhat the guiding principles would be. Most of the uses,\nthe States are going to agree, are riparian uses,\ntraditional things, bulkheads, piers, wharfs, docks, water\nintakes, as the Master found. There are a number of uses\nthat, we'll agree, are non-riparian. Building a casino in\nthe middle of the river. If there's a gray area in\nbetween and -- and we've got an argument that it's\nriparian and Maryland has an argument it's not, that issue\nmay have to be litigated if we can't resolve it. But\nthat's the framework I think that answers these questions.\nNow --\nQUESTION: Is that why the Special Master said\ngambling, safety rules, health, tax, licensing, all of\nthat is irrelevant to this case?\nMR. RAPHAEL: That's -- that's exactly right,\nJustice Ginsburg, because after Maryland -- after the\nboundary was set on the -- on the Virginia side at low-\nwater mark in 1877, Virginia doesn't dispute that Maryland\nacquired a wide range of police powers on its side of the\nboundary, but that specifically did not apply to those\nrights that Virginia and its citizens enjoyed under the\nCompact of 1785 and which were preserved as a condition of\nthe Black-Jenkins Award and which Maryland historically,\nat least until 1957, recognized was entirely up to\nVirginia to decide what to do on Virginia's shore.\nQUESTION: Does Maryland or Virginia tax the --\nthe value of a -- of a major pier that goes out into the\nriver? I mean, it's worth something, and I assume there's\na tax on it. Anything that's worth anything is taxed.\nMR. RAPHAEL: Your Honor, there are something\nlike 340 piers extending from the Virginia side of the\nPotomac River. All -- all of them are taxed by the -- by\nVirginia. Only -- there are only three properties that\nare taxed by Maryland and those are unique. They're\nrestaurant properties that are sited on property that's --\nthe fee simple title to which is recorded in Maryland.\nThose are on the Maryland side of the line. So Virginia\ntaxes 99 percent of those improvements.\nMaryland argued that -- that you should -- the\nCourt should look at its taxation of those three\nrestaurant properties. We think that that is the\nexception the proves the rule. Maryland doesn't tax 99\npercent of everything that Virginia has ever built.\nThe Maryland construction in 1873 that it was\nentirely up to Virginia to decide when and whether and\nwhere to build improvements remained their construction\nuntil at the earliest 1957. And it was in 1957 when the\nfirst permit was issued to a Virginia user that was\nFairfax County, but the record is undisputed that that\npermit was not known to Virginia State officials.\nQUESTION: In the -- in the compact beginning\nwith article or clause VIII, there's some very particular\nassignments of sovereign powers, abrogation of sovereign\npower, but that doesn't apply in VII. And it seems to me\nthat that helps Maryland in this case. When the compact\nwanted to provide Virginia would have very specific police\npowers, it provided it, but it didn't provide that with\nrespect to riparian rights. In fact, it doesn't even\nmention riparian rights. It just talks about wharfs.\nMR. RAPHAEL: It refers to the advantages and\nemoluments.\nQUESTION: Referring to the compact.\nMR. RAPHAEL: Right. The article VII refers to\nthe advantages and emoluments of the ownership of land.\nQUESTION: But that -- it doesn't use the word\nriparian.\nMR. RAPHAEL: That's -- that's exactly right.\nBut the answer to your question, Your Honor, is that there\nwas no need in article VII to address that specific\nquestion because it was -- everybody would have assumed\nthat each State retained the authority to regulate its own\ncitizens.\nQUESTION: Well, I'm -- I'm not so sure. If --\nif three or four provisions of the contract -- of the\ncompact have very specific abrogations or assignment of\nsovereignty and the other one doesn't, I -- I would assume\nthat there is -- that that provision has not been made.\nMR. RAPHAEL: But, Your Honor, it's -- to our\nthinking it would be inconceivable that George Mason who\n-- who negotiated that compact on behalf of Virginia, who\nopposed the Federal Constitution because it gave Congress\ntoo much authority over -- over commerce, that he would\nhave signed an agreement with the understanding that\nMaryland had the authority to decide when and where\nVirginia could make use of the river.\nQUESTION: Well, other than he's operating from\nthe baseline where Maryland owns the river.\nMR. RAPHAEL: That's -- but history is the other\nway.\nevery stick in the bundle of sticks, but historically\nthat's not the case because there were prior and\nsubsequent grants to Virginia which included the Potomac\nRiver. Five monarchs disputed Maryland's claim. And the\nissue was in controverse, as this Court has twice said in\nMorris v. United States and Marine Railway, and they\nagreed in 1785 that the bundle of sticks was over here and\nthe two States agreed that regardless of where the\nboundary would be set, each State would have equal sticks\nfrom that bundle representing the right of equal access to\nthe river, and they further agreed that as a condition of\nthe award, those sticks in that bundle would never be\ndeprived of either State. And if Maryland didn't have the\nauthority to take away or regulate Virginia's rights prior\nto 1877, they could not have gained that authority by the\nBlack-Jenkins Award.\nQUESTION: Yes, but it seems to me that as a\nmatter of sort of looking at history and all, at the time\nthese documents were negotiated and prepared, I don't\nthink anyone contemplated the possibility that a diversion\nof water from the river would be so great that it might\nlower the low-water mark. And is it your view that --\nthat Virginia could syphon off enough water to reduce the\n-- move the low-water mark about, say, a foot, but not\nobstruct navigation?\nmuch out. But could they change the State -- the boundary\nof the State by doing that?\nMR. RAPHAEL: Part of that question, Your Honor,\ngoes to the -- goes to whether the boundary is at the\nhistoric low-water mark or at the mean low-water mark.\nQUESTION: I see.\nMR. RAPHAEL: And I don't think the Court has\nanswered that question, and that may require resolution in\nthe future. But --\nQUESTION: I don't know how you'd know what the\nhistoric low-water mark was if you --\nMR. RAPHAEL: This Court determined in Ohio v.\nKentucky what the low-water mark was as of 1792.\nQUESTION: We can do that kind of stuff.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: You -- you would say -- but assuming\n-- assume there is a -- a -- now an understanding of what\nthe border is and it's a fixed border. Could Virginia\nchange that by drawing -- withdrawing water in your view?\nMR. RAPHAEL: Again, I think it's going to\ndepend on whether it's the historic low or the mean low,\nand if -- you have to answer that question before I think\nyou can answer the question.\nQUESTION: But you do say that even if it might\nnot change the boundary of the State, they could withdraw\nas much water as they want as long as it doesn't interfere\nwith the transportation on the river.\nMR. RAPHAEL: And as long as it doesn't\ninterfere with Maryland's use, and once it does, Maryland\nhas a remedy. It can object in the permitting process.\nIt can file an original action. It could sue the Virginia\nuser making use of that water.\nThe issue, though, is whether Maryland gets to\ndecide in the first instance what Virginia's rights are,\nand this Court has never given one State the authority to\ncontrol another State's water supply.\nQUESTION: Well, generally riparian owners are\nown -- have the -- the right to withdraw water subject to\nthe overriding control of the governmental body that\ncontrols the -- the lake or the river, whatever it is.\nMR. RAPHAEL: That's right.\nQUESTION: But you're saying that's not true\nhere.\nMR. RAPHAEL: It is true here. Virginians can\nwithdraw water subject to paramount Federal control and\nsubject to Virginia's control.\nQUESTION: But not subject to the control of the\nowner of the river.\nMR. RAPHAEL: They can withdraw water subject to\nVirginia's control.\nQUESTION: But riparian ownership usually\ncontemplates beneficial use of the waters on the riparian\nland, not just general withdrawal for inland uses.\nMR. RAPHAEL: That's correct, Your Honor. But\nthis Court has said in a number of cases, including New\nYork -- New Jersey v. New York, Connecticut v.\nMassachusetts, that a common law limitation that may limit\nit to the shoreline use of the riparian use would not\napply as between States. And article VII of the --\narticle IV of the Black-Jenkins Award refers to Virginia's\nrights as a sovereign to the use of the Potomac.\nQUESTION: Strictly speaking --\nQUESTION: No, it doesn't say as a sovereign.\nIt -- it says Virginia. It does not say as a sovereign.\nThis is very important.\nMR. RAPHAEL: Well --\nQUESTION: I'm right.\nMR. RAPHAEL: It doesn't use the word sovereign,\nbut I don't -- I fail to see the distinction --\nQUESTION: Of course, it does not use the word.\nMR. RAPHAEL: -- because both in the award and\nin the -- in the opinion, the arbitrators were talking\nabout Virginia as a commonwealth, as a State, not -- not\nVirginia as -- as a mere property owner.\nQUESTION:\nVirginia as a sovereign when it has a right to regulate,\nbut the question is whether they were talking about\nVirginia as a sovereign when it withdraws water.\nMR. RAPHAEL: Well, the issue of withdrawing\nwater, whether that's a riparian use, has been -- has been\nstipulated. The Master said at page 12 of his report that\nMaryland never disputed that this was a riparian use or a\nuse covered by the compact. So that's not an issue.\nQUESTION: I think it's fair to say that article\nfourth acknowledges that Virginia is what you might call a\nriparian sovereign. It has sovereign rights over -- over\nthe bank of the river. It says is entitled not only to\nfull dominion over the soil to low-water mark, blah, blah,\nblah, blah, but such use of the river beyond the line of\nlow -- as may be necessary to the full enjoyment of her\nriparian ownership.\nMR. RAPHAEL: That's correct.\nQUESTION: And I think that's referring to\nsovereign ownership.\nMR. RAPHAEL: I -- I agree with that, Justice\nScalia.\nI'd like to correct one misstatement I think my\nfriend, Mr. Baida, made with respect to the Low Flow\nAllocation Agreement. That agreement and the -- the\nenabling legislation that provided for it was amended to\nmake clear that Maryland did not have the authority to\ncontrol Virginia's withdrawals. That issue was put aside\nto another day, and the Low Flow Allocation Agreement, for\nexample, says that no party can withdraw water from the\nPotomac River without being subject to a permit which\nimposes the low flow conditions or becoming a member party\nto the agreement. And we point out in our papers the\nnumerous instances in the 1970's where Virginia went on\nrecord saying Maryland did not have the authority to\nregulate Virginia's water withdrawals.\nWhether you look at this case under the -- under\nthe compacts in question or under the -- under Federal\ncommon law, you cannot give one State the authority to\ncontrol another State's water supply. This case is\nimportant not only because of Virginia's rights to build\nwharfs and improvements. It's important because if\nMaryland prevails, they can control growth and development\nin -- in Virginia. Under Mr. Baida's theory, as long as\nthey treat everybody equally, they can do anything they\nwant, and that would include things like in 2001 when\nthere was legislation before the Maryland General Assembly\nthat would have made users of the -- of the waters pay for\nwater withdrawal. Maryland could decide that it doesn't\nlike growth and development on either side of the river,\nand therefore it's treating each State equally by not\nallowing any use. It's impossible to square that type of\nposition with the plain language of article IV of the\naward or article VII of the compact.\nAnd if there are no further questions, thank you\nvery much.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Raphael.\nMr. Baida, you have 3 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW H. BAIDA\nON BEHALF OF THE PLAINTIFF\nMR. BAIDA: Prior to this case, Virginia has\nnever taken the position that it has any authority to take\nany kind of regulatory action at all with respect to piers\nand wharfs beyond the water mark. And in fact, what\nVirginia has done is it has sent hundreds of its citizens\nto Maryland and it has told its citizens that their\nconstruction projects from the Virginia side of the\nPotomac River fall outside of Virginia's jurisdiction but\nfall within Maryland's because Maryland owns the bed of\nthe river. That ownership gives Maryland the right,\nputting aside just for the moment any agreements -- it\ngives Maryland the right to regulate withdrawals of water\nfrom Maryland.\nAnd so what we're left with at this moment is\narticle VI, the fourth paragraph, of the Black-Jenkins\nAward, and it says it does give Virginia full dominion\nover the right in the soil, but Justice Scalia, I would\ndisagree it gives Virginia any sovereign rights to use the\nriver beyond that point because if it gave Virginia the\nunrestricted right to use the Potomac River beyond that\npoint, that's called quiet title. That means Virginia\ngets to do what it wants. Maryland can't regulate it, and\nthis Court said in Idaho v. Coeur d'Alene Tribe that that\nkind of regulatory action, if unrestricted, is the\nequivalent of a quiet title action.\nThe Black-Jenkins arbitrators rejected\nVirginia's claim to any title to the middle of the river.\nThey set Virginia's boundary at low-water mark on the\nVirginia side. They could have done the boundary line.\nThey could have drawn it around the piers and wharfs.\nThey showed an unbelievable dexterity in drawing the\nboundary through Smith Island. They went from the bottom\nof the Chesapeake Bay up through the bottom third of Smith\nIsland and back down again. They didn't do that on the\nVirginia side of the Potomac. They set low-water mark on\nVirginia's side.\nTitle to -- Virginia has title to low-water\nmark, but only a right of use beyond that point. It has\nnot an unrestricted right of use. The right of us is\nsubject to governmental authority. The government that\ngets to regulate it is the government that owns it.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr. Baida.\n"
