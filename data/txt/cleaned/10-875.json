FREEMAN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMS. FREEMAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nBankruptcy estates incur taxes when they\ngenerate income. The Government's attempt to limit the\neffect of the farm sale statute, section 1222(a)(2)(A),\nalters that fundamental principle in corporate chapter\n11 cases and in all bankruptcy cases, as it requires\nthis Court to construe the administrative section in the\npriority section of the Bankruptcy Code that do apply in\nall of those cases.\nIn a chapter 12 case, the bankruptcy estate\nconsists of more than just the assets that existed as of\nthe date of filing. They also consist of all of the\nincome that is earned thereafter, wages -- Mrs. Hall's\nwages as a convenience store clerk are part of the\nbankruptcy estate -- the proceeds from selling crops --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Does it include debts\nincurred after the filing?\nMS. FREEMAN: From the period -- from the\npetition filing date until the confirmation of the plan,\nyes, it does. Those debts are incurred in the operation\nof the estate --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Debts -- debts that were\nincurred after that date?\nMS. FREEMAN: Yes, Your Honor. So that, for\nexample, in operating an estate, you would incur a light\nbill as well as incurring taxes. All of the operating\nexpenses are incurred by the bankruptcy estate and are\npayable from the income and from the estate assets\nduring that period from the petition filing date until\nthe confirmation of the plan.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Is that true of --\nMS. FREEMAN: That's the administrative\nperiod.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Is that true of State --\nyou said taxes. Is it true of State taxes?\nMS. FREEMAN: Yes, Your Honor, it is true of\nState taxes as well as Federal taxes. County taxes, for\nexample. Property --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So, in this -- in this --\nwe're dealing with a capital gains tax on the sale of\nthe farm. Suppose a State had a similar tax; it also\ntaxed the gain on the sale.\nMS. FREEMAN: Correct, Your Honor, and it\ndid in this particular case. So, there would be State\ntaxes on the capital gains, and those would also be\nadministrative expense priorities, except for the farm\nsale provision here, which demotes that priority if the\ndebtor is able to earn a discharge. And if so, then\nthose farm sale taxes are demoted in priority and may be\ndischarged under a plan of reorganization. They would\nshare pro rata with the other prepetition claims of the\nbankruptcy estate.\nJUSTICE ALITO: And who would file the State\ntax return? Would it be filed by the estate or would it\nbe filed by the debtor?\nMS. FREEMAN: The debtor and the estate are\none in a -- in a reorganization case. And so, the\ntaxpayers, Lynwood and Brenda Hall, would file the tax\nreturn. The way that it would actually be administered,\nYour Honor, is shown by the Knudsen case. And,\nbasically, there would be a tax return that includes all\nof the income, the wages, the crop sale proceeds and so\nforth. And then it would compute it with the capital\ngains tax, and there would be a separate pro forma\nreturn that does not include the capital gains tax.\nThose would be sent to the Special\nProcedures Unit of the IRS, so that somebody there would\nknow how to deal with it and would be able to count the\ndifference.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, how do you deal\nwith section 346?\nMS. FREEMAN: Section 346, Your Honor,\nbasically makes the State taxes consistent with the\nFederal taxes. When you have --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I read 346(b) to say\nthat, unless the estate is a separate tax entity under\nthe code, that the debtor, not the estate, pays State\nand local taxes. This is totally contrary to what\nyou're saying, but the language of 346(b) --\nMS. FREEMAN: Your Honor --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- basically answers the\nquestion against you with respect to State and local\ntaxes.\nMS. FREEMAN: Justice Sotomayor, I do not\nthink it does, in the sense -- in this sense: The\nbankruptcy -- section 346(b) made the State and local\ntaxes consistent with Federal taxes, and when you have a\nbankruptcy estate that consists only of assets on the\npetition filing date, then you have a separate taxable\nentity with a separate tax I.D. number that is set up.\nBut under the Federal bankruptcy -- under the Federal\ntax code, under section 1399, whenever the bankruptcy\nestate had income during the course of the estate,\nduring the administration period, as well as the assets\non the petition filing date, then it's a single taxable\nentity. And so, that single taxpayer would pay it.\nSection 346 doesn't say what assets are used\nto pay the tax. That's a matter of bankruptcy law. The\ndebtor, the individual taxpayer, is going to file the\ntax return under State and local and Federal law, but\nhe's going to use the estate assets because that's all\nthere is. He doesn't have any other assets.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, the debtor is going\nto pay.\nMS. FREEMAN: The debtor pays --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And so, when this says\nwhenever the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 provides that\nno separate taxable estate shall be created in a case\nconcerning a debtor under this title --\nMS. FREEMAN: Right.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- chapter 12 doesn't\ncreate a separate taxable estate.\nMS. FREEMAN: Correct.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And that the income,\net cetera, shall be taxed to or claimed by the debtor\nunder State or local law.\nMS. FREEMAN: That's correct, Your Honor.\nIt's going to be on the debtor's tax return. The\ndebtor's the one who will have the deductions, and the\ndeductions would include administrative expenses of the\nbankruptcy estate.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: This -- this is hard for\nme to understand, given the last line. \"The estate\nshall be liable for any tax imposed on such corporation\nor partnership, but not for any tax imposed on partners\nor members.\"\nBy the logic of that last sentence, it seems\nto me that the preceding section is not looking to the\nestate, but to the debtor, to pay the taxes.\nMS. FREEMAN: The debtor pays the taxes, but\nwith estate assets because those are the only assets\nthat exist.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, why -- why would the\nlast sentence be necessary?\nMS. FREEMAN: The last sentence, I believe,\nYour Honor, deals with a partnership, and in a\npartnership case, just as outside the bankruptcy, the\npartnership files the tax return and the partners\nindividually are the ones who pay the taxes. But they\npay the taxes. If a partner is in its own bankruptcy\nestate with the only assets that exist -- all of his\nincome, all of his wages, all of those are property of\nthe bankruptcy estate, and he would use it to pay the\ntax. He's not individually liable any more than if a\ntrustee were individually liable. The trustee in a\nbankruptcy case uses estate assets to pay taxes. And\nso, what --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But it says the estate --\nthe estate's not liable for the tax imposed on the\npartners. So, if it's not liable, how can it ask for a\ndischarge?\nMS. FREEMAN: The -- the debtor ultimately\nis the one who receives a discharge. Discharge\nprovisions are separate than the -- than the tax payment\nissues. Tax payment deals with what moneys are used to\nmake the payments of taxes during the course of\nadministration of a bankruptcy case. The debtor\nreceives a discharge in a chapter 12 case if it\ncomplies -- if he complies with all of the provisions of\nhis plan of reorganization and then receives a\ndischarge.\nThere are exceptions to the discharge.\nCertain prepetition taxes are excepted from a discharge\nand would carry through during the -- postpetition. But\nthe farm sale statute provides that these particular\nadministrative expenses would be subject to a discharge\nif he complies with the rest of the provisions of the --\nof his plan of reorganization.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What happens in a 12 or 13\ncase, just your typical case -- and this must arise\nfairly often -- in year 1, on January 1, the farm or the\nship or whatever is the subject goes into chapter 12 or\n13. They have a lot of pre-1 debt. Then in year 2 and\nyear 3, the proceedings are going on, but the farm is\noperating, so is the ship, or whatever. And they\nearn -- they run up debts during that time. People give\nthem fertilizer -- they give them, you know, all kinds\nof things. So, they have a lot of debts that they've\nrun up in that time. Now it draws to a close, at the\nend of year 3.\nNow, what about those debts that have been\nrun up during that time? There isn't a separate\nbankruptcy estate for tax purposes, I understand. But\nif Joe Smith has loaned his farm some money during that\ntime, and it comes time to look at the future income to\nsubtract the prepetition debts, does his debt get wound\nup and get some priority in that process, or is he just\nat the end of the queue?\nMS. FREEMAN: He does get priority in that\nprocess, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. Well, if he\ngets priority, then why in heaven's name shouldn't a tax\nget priority?\nMS. FREEMAN: Your Honor --\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's your point.\nMS. FREEMAN: -- it does have that priority.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And if it does, then, of\ncourse, the exception that Senator Grassley put in\napplies to that. So, that's a question I should ask\nthem, given your answer.\nMS. FREEMAN: Yes, Your Honor.\nAnd, in fact, those taxes, along with the\nlight bill and any other administrative expenses, would\nbe paid when due over that 2- or 3-year period. And\nthat's certainly what happens in the large chapter 11\nbankruptcy case, like a Delphi bankruptcy case or, you\nknow, a General Motors, for instance.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but I mean,\nyour -- it is a question for you, because these things\ndon't go for 2 or 3 years, do they? I thought typically\nthey are wrapped up very quickly, and that's to the\nadvantage of the debtor. And your position with respect\nto postpetition taxes has the potential of extending\nthem beyond the kind of quick turnaround that helps\neverybody.\nMS. FREEMAN: Respectfully, Mr. Chief\nJustice, in chapter 12 cases, often the bankruptcy\nestate will drag on for 2 or 3 years, and certainly for\nlonger than 1 year and much longer than a chapter 13\ncase, because you do have sales of assets. You have\ndebts that need to be restructured. You have leases\nthat end up getting rejected. You have a -- new crop\nsubsidies that are applied for and received. The\nchapter -- the -- the amicus curiae brief of the\nprofessors has a study, and shows how long chapter\n12 cases generally last.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How long was this --\nthis one?\nMS. FREEMAN: This case, Your Honor, because\nof this appeal, has lasted from 2005 through today. So,\na considerable period of time. And all of the taxes\nduring that period of time and all of the operating\nexpenses during that period of time are administrative\nexpenses and are payable in the ordinary course.\nThere's an administrative expense claim if in fact they\nhaven't been paid.\nAnd if -- if one of the creditors has not\nreceived payment or if a taxing authority has not\nreceived payment, it can move for payment as an\nadministrative priority. It can ask that it be paid\nnow, and it can ask that the case be dismissed if it\nhasn't been paid. So, you do have that highest\npriority, and this is consistent with the Court's\nNicholas case, 1966, which preceded the Bankruptcy Code\nand which the Bankruptcy Code really incorporated and\ncontinued with.\nIn the Nicholas case, the Court said that\nall taxes incurred by a debtor-in-possession and\nincurred during the administration period have\nadministrative expense priority, and they are payable by\nthe debtor-in-possession as an officer of the court, as\n-- as the administrator of the estate under 28 U.S.C.\nsection 960, which is still in effect today, and which\nrequires that the person in control of the bankruptcy\nestate, whether it's a trustee or a\ndebtor-in-possession, pay those taxes, but not pay them\nwith his own money.\nAs the Court said in the Nicholas case, you\npay them with the assets of the estate. The individual\ntrustee is not responsible; the individual\ndebtor-in-possession is not responsible. The\nresponsibility of the debtor-in-possession really is a\nmatter of the discharge provisions, whether he's going\nto be separately discharged or if he has responsible\nperson liability because he's -- he's -- you're dealing\nwith trust fund taxes, with wages from some other\nperson --\nJUSTICE BREYER: The -- what you say to me\nmakes a great deal of sense, but I think one of their\nstronger arguments is, it may make sense. But,\nunfortunately, even if Senator Grassley and the others\nwanted it, they didn't do it right technically. They\ndidn't amend the right provision of the code, and\nwhoever's fault that is, is beside the point. So,\nthere's no way to get the words to get to the result\nthat you want.\nI'll tell you the best I could do -- and I\nsee a problem with it -- is you say that -- you go to\n1226(b)(1), and it says that any unpaid claim of the\nkind specified in 507(a)(2); and 507(a)(2) talks about\nadministrative expenses and refers you to 503; and 503\nincludes taxes and administrative expenses; and then you\nsay it's -- at 1220 whatever it is, what did I just say?\nMS. FREEMAN: 1226?\nJUSTICE BREYER: 1226.\nMS. FREEMAN: Uh-huh.\nJUSTICE BREYER: It's like an Abbott and\nCostello movie.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: The -- the -- you get to\n1226(b)(1), and it says that that's -- shall be paid any\nunpaid payments of that kind, including administrative\nexpenses. And -- and so, then you have 1222(a), which\nrefers to that, and then the amendment applies to that.\nBut, now, what I did was I sloughed over by\ntalking too quickly -- it talked about \"claim\" -- of a\n\"claim,\" it says, any unpaid claim of the kind specified\nin 507(a)(2). And when you look to 507(a)(2), it talks\nabout claims and expenses; and then in (2) there, it\nrefers to administrative expenses. And so, I think the\nGovernment says they left out what was key to you, the\nword \"expenses.\"\nAll right? Now, I don't know what I'm doing\nwhen I start tinkering with this Bankruptcy Code. And\nis that just true, what they say? It does leave out the\nword \"expenses.\" Will -- will we cause untold harm if\nwe were to read the word \"claims\" there to include\nexpenses?\nMS. FREEMAN: Your Honor, respectfully, you\nwould cause untold harm because this provision applies\nin corporate chapter 11's and in all bankruptcy cases.\nThey all have the administrative expense provision, 503,\nand they all have section 507. So, you would stop taxes\nfrom being payable in a big Delphi --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, but I was thinking,\nsuppose I do it by reading the word \"claims\" --\nMS. FREEMAN: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- in 5 -- in 1226, when it\nsays \"any unpaid claim\" --\nMS. FREEMAN: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Which is what you want to\nhave include taxes --\nMS. FREEMAN: And claim --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- to read that word as\nincluding both the 507(a) claims, which are in (1)(a),\n(1)(b), and -- and also administrative expenses in (2).\nCan I do that?\nMS. FREEMAN: You can, Your Honor, because\n\"claim\" is defined in section 101 of the code as right\nto payment. \"Creditor\" is defined as someone who has a\nclaim that arose prepetition, which necessarily means\n\"claim\" is broader and not just one that arose\nprepetition.\nThere are numerous provisions of the\nBankruptcy Code that refer to administrative expenses as\nclaims, including 1226. And so, the Court can see that\nthose are interpreted consistently.\nThis Court, in the Hartford Underwriters\ncase, referred to administrative claims, calling them\nclaims as well as administrative. And really what the\nGovernment's argument here is that administrative\nexpenses are outside of bankruptcy altogether, that\nthey're not part of what get paid in a bankruptcy case.\nAnd that's simply untrue.\nIf the Court looks at the provisions with\nrespect to requirements of a plan, including 1222(a),\nwhich apart from the exception, it says that\nadministrative expenses are required to be paid.\nSection 1228 says that a plan discharges all debts\nincluding debts provided for -- allowed under section\n503. Debt is a liability on a claim.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But that doesn't answer my\nfirst question, what actually happens? I mean, this\nisn't the first year of chapter 12 and 13.\nMS. FREEMAN: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And there must be instances\nwhere the -- where the debts run up postpetition are\npretty big --\nMS. FREEMAN: And --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- and there isn't enough\nmoney to go around, and they're going to have to be paid\nout of future income along with the prepetition debts.\nAnd it can be done, but there is a question of\npriorities, and the Government is saying there is no\npriority -- I think they're saying that -- for a\npostpetition debt. And -- and you're saying, oh, but of\ncourse there is.\nSo, what actually happens? There have been\nperhaps thousands and thousands of cases, haven't there?\nMS. FREEMAN: And administrative expenses do\nget paid in the ordinary course. And if the taxes\naren't paid --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Get paid, if necessary, by\nassigning priorities?\nMS. FREEMAN: Yes. They have administrative\npriority, and they do get paid.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And so, to look to a\nhornbook on bankruptcy law which just tells me what\nyou've just said, I would look where?\nMS. FREEMAN: We -- we've cited a number of\nhornbooks that have exactly that provision. What's\nparticularly interesting with respect to the\nGovernment's position here is that, at the Government's\nurging, section 507(a)(8) of the Bankruptcy Code, that\nprovided for prepetition priority, eighth priority, for\nprepetition taxes within a short period before the\nBankruptcy Code, was amended; so that all of those\neighth priority taxes during the year of the filing, the\nstraddle year -- here the Halls filed their bankruptcy\ncase in August; so, during the entire period from\nJanuary 1 through August when they filed -- are treated\nas administrative expenses. And yet, now they say\nadministrative expenses mean nothing, and they don't get\nany payment as administrative expenses.\nWhy urge the change? Why make all of those\nyear-of-filing taxes into administrative expenses and\nthen say administrative expenses have no meaning?\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm going to ask the\nGovernment this, but are you aware of any circuit split\nor any cases below that have accepted the Government's\narguments that chapter 12 involves prepetition debts\nonly and that don't pay administrative expenses\npostbankruptcy?\nMS. FREEMAN: There are several cases that\nhave interpreted section 1222(a)(2)(A). None of them\nhave addressed the change in 507 or what that means.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: A different question.\nMS. FREEMAN: Okay.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The Government's now\nsaying that chapter 12 involves only prepetition claims.\nMS. FREEMAN: Right.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And it's basically, by\nthat argument, saying it doesn't involve and can't\ninvolve administrative expenses. That's how I read\ntheir argument.\nMS. FREEMAN: I think that's --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And so, I'm asking is --\nare there any courts that you're aware of below who have\nbeen presented with this argument, outside of the tax\nsituation, who have accepted it?\nMS. FREEMAN: I --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Who have failed to give\npriority to administrative expenses?\nMS. FREEMAN: None outside of this tax\nsituation. And, Your Honor, I don't believe that any of\nthe cases that have followed the Government's\ninterpretation of this farm sale statute, 1222(a)(2)(A),\nhave addressed the impact on other administrative\nexpenses and other tax claims. The wages -- the taxes\non wages that are incurred, the lottery winnings that an\nindividual farmer might have, and the fact that those\nhave administrative priority and that those would need\nto be paid off the top as administrative expenses --\nnone of the cases address those.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm not asking you to\ndefend their position.\nMS. FREEMAN: Okay.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It's just such a broad\nposition that I'm trying to understand if there's a\nsplit out there that we are unaware of.\nMS. FREEMAN: And the problem, Your Honor,\nis that it does have these broad impacts, and none of\nthe courts have really addressed it. And I don't\nbelieve that certainly the --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, can we go back to\nthe issue that gives me trouble?\nMS. FREEMAN: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How to read \"incurred by\nthe estate.\" If the estate doesn't pay taxes --\nMS. FREEMAN: To incur --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- how could it be\nincurred by the estate when Congress, if it intended\nwhat you're saying it intended, could have said\n\"incurred during bankruptcy\"?\nMS. FREEMAN: Incurred -- to incur is to\ntake on liability. So, at the point in time that income\nis generated during a bankruptcy case, then liabilities\nare taken on at the same time, the operating expenses,\nthe taxes. Here, you had a clear estate asset, the Hall\nfarm. It was sold. That generates an income tax\nliability, a capital gains liability. And so, that\nis -- it's tied to the income, which is here property of\nthe estate. The -- the important thing is --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But -- but the problem is\nthat, with an exception that -- that's not applicable\nhere, section 1399 of the Internal Revenue Code provides\nthat no separate taxable entity shall result from the\ncommencement of a case under Title XI of the United\nStates Code.\nHow can you incur a tax when you are not a\nseparate taxable entity?\nMS. FREEMAN: Your Honor, because you are a\nsingle taxable entity instead of a separate taxable\nentity. The whole reason for the separate taxable\nentity section was when you had a bankruptcy estate that\nconsisted only of the assets on the petition filing\ndate, and the debtor earns income independently. So,\nthe debtor would independently have tax liability, and\nthat would be separate from the estate.\nBut when you have a reorganization case, a\ncorporate chapter 11 or a chapter 12, then the estate\nand the debtor are a single taxable entity, and the\ndebtor is the one that files the tax returns or the\ndebtor-in-possession, the trustee, if there's a trustee\nin control --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, if -- if that\nexception were intended, the provision I read contains\nan exception. It says \"except in any case to which\nsection 1398 applies.\" 1398 applies to chapter 7 and\nchapter 11 where the debtor is an individual.\nMS. FREEMAN: That's --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Now, if there is an\nadditional exception for chapter 12 of the sort that you\nallege, why wasn't that put in there?\nMS. FREEMAN: There is no exception, and\nthere shouldn't be an exception, Your Honor. They're\nwithin section 1399, just like corporate chapter 11\ndebtors. The debtor is the one that files the tax\nreturn. The debtor and estate are one. All of that\ncorporate earnings, all of the wages, the lottery\nwinnings, the farm sale proceeds, all of those are part\nof the estate. And so, those --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What does it mean, then, to\nsay that no taxable -- \"no separate taxable entity shall\nresult\"? What does it mean, unless it means that it is\nnot the estate which incurs the tax?\nMS. FREEMAN: Your Honor, respectfully,\nthere's a difference between taxable entity and estate.\nThe estate is a collection of property. That is the\ncollection of property that's operated by the\ndebtor-in-possession or trustee in a reorganization\ncase.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, but they -- but they\nwould not have needed the exceptions for chapter 7 and\nchapter 11 where the debtor is an individual if what you\nsay is true, if indeed a bankrupt estate is, as you say,\nnot an entity at all.\nMS. FREEMAN: You need that exception, Your\nHonor, in a chapter 7 case for an individual because the\nindividual earns income that is wholly independent from\nthe estate, that's not part of the estate. So that the\nbankruptcy estate consists of the assets the individual\nowns on the petition filing date. The trustee\nadministers those, sells the assets, may incur some\nliability for selling the assets for taxes, pays those,\nand deals with those, while the individual continues to\nearn income postpetition that's his own income. And so,\nyou need to have a separate taxable estate in those\ninstances.\nBut when the income that's earned during\nthis whole period of administration, from the petition\nfiling date to the confirmation date of the plan, is all\nproperty of the estate, then the debtor, the corporate\nchapter 11 debtor or the -- the corporate chapter 12\ndebtor or the individual chapter 12 debtor is incurring\nthat income as part of the estate. It's all property of\nthe estate in a chapter 12 case. Section 1207 says\nthat.\nAnd so, the debtor is the one that files the\ntax returns, and the debtor uses the estate assets to\nmake the payments of the taxes and to make the payments\non the light bill and to make the payments on all of the\nother expenses of administration during this period of\nadministration. That's what this Court held in\nNicholas, and that continues on in effect today.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: But, Ms. Freeman, wouldn't\nit be fair to say then that the taxes are incurred by\nthe debtor and payable out of the estate? Why would it\nsay \"incurred by the estate\"?\nMS. FREEMAN: It uses the term \"incurred by\nthe estate\" I think based upon the same kind of language\nthat this Court used in Nicholas, as incurred by the --\nincurred during the administration period, incurred by\nthe debtor-in-possession. It's -- it's really a broad\nsense of all of the kinds of bankruptcy estates in a\nchapter 7 case. It -- this refers to all bankruptcy\ncases.\nAnd so, in a chapter 7 case, it's going to\nbe just the assets that exist there on the petition\nfiling date. If it's a corporate case, it's going to be\nthe -- all of the assets that are generating the income\nduring the course of the administration of the chapter\n12 or the chapter 11 case or even the chapter 13 case.\nIn chapter 13 cases, you have a specific\nadditional provision, section 1305, that deals with\ntaxes payable postpetition, and it also includes\npostconfirmation. So, it gives the government a broader\nkind of right so that --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The argument that is made\nagainst your position -- 1305 was one of the provisions\nthat was featured, I think, both in the Ninth Circuit\nand the Tenth Circuit, and their position seems to be\nthat 1305 gives the government an election.\nMS. FREEMAN: It does, Your Honor, provide\nfor an election for the government. What's important is\nthat in a 13 case, unlike a 12 or an 11, you have a very\nshort period of administration. They have to file their\nplan within 15 days. It's confirmed within a month or\ntwo. And it's very unlikely that April 15th is going to\nfall within that short period of time, and that's when\nthe Government says that your taxes are incurred. So,\nyou're going to have a -- it's unlikely you're going to\nhave an administrative expense claim for your income\ntaxes during the period of administration of a chapter\n13. It's a very short period.\nSo, the government has the option not only\nduring the administration period, but also during the\nwhole period of the plan, to elect to say: All right,\nthere have been some big commissions earned here, and I\nwant to go ahead and collect from the estate rather than\njust wait and see what the debtor earns afterwards. And\nso, it then can go ahead and file a claim and ask to\nhave that claim paid out of the bankruptcy estate, and\nit really gives the government much broader rights than\nit does in a normal chapter 11 or a chapter 12 case or a\n7.\nIf I may reserve the remainder of my time\nfor rebuttal.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMs. Freeman.\nMS. FREEMAN: Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Shah.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF PRATIK A. SHAH\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. SHAH: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe postpetition income tax liability at\nissue in this case is not subject to section\n1222(a)(2)(A) and thus cannot be treated as a\ndischargeable nonpriority debt for two reasons. First,\nconsistent with the structure of chapter 12, a chapter\n12 plan is limited to prepetition debts and does not\ncover postpetition debts, including administrative\nexpenses. Rather, postpetition administrative expenses\nare paid separately through section 1226(b)(1), which\ncontains no farm sale exception. Because section\n1222(a)(2)(A) strips priority only from a subset of\nclaims covered by a chapter 12 plan and does not alter\nwhich debts fall within that plan, it cannot apply to\nthe postpetition tax liability at issue.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So, what -- what farm\nsales would be included? What farm sales would get this\nbenefit that Senator Grassley obviously wanted them to\nhave?\nMR. SHAH: Your Honor, it would be\nprepetition sales. That is, any capital gains tax\nincurred from a prepetition sale, those would be\npriority expenses covered under a chapter 12 plan under\nsection 1222(a)(2), because they fall under -- they're\nan -- they're a priority claim under section 507(a).\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Does that -- does\nthat make sense, though, in terms of if you're talking\nabout farmers and fishermen and you're talking about the\ntreatment of their central asset, whether it's the farm\nor typically the boat, and they either want to try --\nthey want to try to save the farm or the boat, and they\ngo into bankruptcy, and the big issue is how that\nasset's going to be treated. And your position is it's\nnot in the bankruptcy at all; it's outside of it. That\nseems to me to be at least counterintuitive.\nMR. SHAH: Well, Your Honor, two points:\nOne, as a practical matter, chapter 12 is a\nreorganization provision. This is not a provision just\ndesigned to allow farmers to get out of the business of\nfarming. So, often what will happen is that farmers\nwill try to reorganize some of their farm sale assets,\nsell some of their livestock, change their farming\noperation, to see if they can save it outside of\nbankruptcy first.\nAll of those sales -- an example of that is\nthe Knudsen case. Knudsen is the only circuit case to\ngo Petitioners' way. In Knudsen, it not only involved\nthe postpetition tax liability of the type at issue in\nthis case; it also had a significant prepetition tax\nliability component in that case based upon just what I\nwas explaining, the farmer trying to -- trying to change\ntheir farming operation to save the farm without having\nto go into bankruptcy.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But also, I gather,\nit's a fairly typical situation where you have farmers\nthat might want to sell part of the farm. You know,\nthey have dairy and corn operations or something, and\nthey sell one to try to preserve the other. And that's\n-- that's exactly the sort of thing that should be\nconsidered in the bankruptcy context. And yet, your\nposition says we're going to treat it outside the\nbankruptcy.\nMR. SHAH: Well, Your Honor, it certainly\nhappens within the bankruptcy, and I'm not disputing\nyour point that that may -- that may arise in a\nbankruptcy case just like it arises in this case. And\nit will be dealt through the bankruptcy. That is, the\nsale will happen, and it will be approved by the\nbankruptcy court. The question is, how do you treat the\ncapital gains tax arising --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But that's a big\ndeal if you're deciding how the plan's going to work,\nwhether they -- I mean, what the amount was here was big\nfor the farmer, and the idea of, well, we're going to\npretend that's not at issue here seems to me to be --\nagain, not -- not to make a lot of sense.\nMR. SHAH: Your Honor, we're not asking, to\nbe clear, to pretend that that's not there. How the tax\nliability would be dealt with under the Government's\nview is at the time the debtor moves to sell the farm\nasset during the bankruptcy case -- like in this case,\nthat sale of the farm asset generated $960,000. That\nwas the sale price. The capital gains tax liability in\nthis case is $29,000. If they would have set aside from\nthat $960,000 sale price $29,000 to pay the capital\ngains tax debt, that would resolve the issue. We're not\nsaying that you ignore it.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: But there's every reason to\nthink, Mr. Shah, that what Congress was worried about\nhere was cases in which the bankruptcy plan would not be\napproved at all because there were very high capital\ngains taxes that would result from a sale and that that\nwas the problem that everybody was focused on, was\nmaking sure that farmers could take advantage of section\n12. So, it's a little bit odd -- it's actually more\nthan a little bit odd. It's a lot odd to read the\nstatute to apply not in that context but only as to\npeople who have somehow managed to sell their property,\nyou know, 18 months before going into bankruptcy.\nMR. SHAH: Sure. So, Your Honor, when you\nsay that everybody was focused on this problem, we have\nthe evidence of exactly one person as to what one\nlegislator thought that this bill would do. That's\nSenator Grassley. Now, admittedly, Senator Grassley's\nstatements do indicate an intent on his part to reach\npostpetition taxes. But the pre-existing statutory\nframework does not permit that result.\nWhat section 1222(a)(2)(A) does is it allows\nthe debtor to strip priority from a certain subset of\ngovernmental claims, such as prepetition taxes, and\nthere is no doubt that Senator Grassley correctly\nunderstood that's how section 1222(a)(2) --\nJUSTICE ALITO: But it's not just Senator\nGrassley. Your interpretation makes this provision,\n1222(a)(2)(A), of very, very little practical value.\nAnd you think that's what Congress intended? Not only\nwould it -- would it mean that postpetition capital\ngains on the sale of part of the farm or the entire farm\nwould -- would be outside of the bankruptcy, outside of\nthe bankruptcy, but all of the prepetition capital gains\nwould be outside of it too, unless they occurred in a\nprevious taxable year.\nMR. SHAH: A couple of responses, Your\nHonor. First of all, I don't think it's sort of a null\nset or a vanishingly small set. There's the Knudsen\ncase which qualifies. Of -- in the professors' amicus\nbrief, on page 10a of their amicus brief, they provide a\nchart of representative cases involving postpetition tax\nliabilities. They cite eight cases in their chart on\npage 10a. Three of those eight cases involve\nsignificant prepetition tax liabilities, even under the\nnarrower definition of \"prepetition.\"\nBut -- but to get to your larger point, even\nto the extent it might be narrower than what Congress\nintended, Congress certainly knew how section 1222\noperated in the sense that it would strip priority from\ncertain claims that are already entitled to priority\nunder a chapter 12 plan, such as prepetition taxes. And\nboth sides agree that that's how section 1220(a)(2)(A)\nworks. There's no dispute about that.\nThe dispute is about whether this\npostpetition tax liability comes within the chapter 12\nplan in the first place. That dispute turns on\npre-existing code provisions, part of the 1978 Act, part\nof the 1980 Act, and the 1986 Act. Whatever deference\nSenator Grassley is owed as to the operation of section\n1220(a)(2)(A) itself, he's owed no deference whatsoever\nas to the proper interpretation of those pre-existing\ncode provisions.\nIt's our position that those pre-existing\ncode provisions, section 503(b), section 346, and\nsection 1398, 1399, all lead to the result that\npostpetition tax liabilities are not an administrative\nexpense within the meaning of the code.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: How about employment tax?\nEmployment taxes?\nMR. SHAH: Your Honor, employment taxes\narguably could be treated differently. Now, as a matter\nof discretion, the IRS has chosen not to treat them\ndifferently. That is, they don't try to seek those as\nadministrative expenses. I think there would be an\nargument -- and we set this -- set forth the argument in\na footnote of our brief. What the potential argument\nwould be is that they could be deemed an administrative\nexpense not because they're incurred by the estate, but\nunder the other part of the definition of an\nadministrative expense under 503(b)(1)(A).\nJUSTICE BREYER: Just following up on\nthat --\nMR. SHAH: Sure.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- I'm looking for what I'd\ncall past practice, where there must be a lot --\nMR. SHAH: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- that would shed some\nlight on this. So, I see -- your point that we cannot\ncall these taxes administrative expenses is because when\nthat's defined in 503 for the entire code --\nMR. SHAH: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- it talks about\nadministrative expenses incurred by the estate.\nMR. SHAH: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And so, you're saying here\nare three people who incurred their own taxes. One is\nsection -- section 12; one is section 13; and one is\nindividuals in section 11. Is that right?\nMR. SHAH: Ah --\nJUSTICE BREYER: At least that's my --\nMR. SHAH: Yes. Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes. Okay. So, we have\nthree categories of people that -- where the taxes,\nliterally taken, they incur postpetition taxes. Now,\nthe bite would come up if it turned out, when they were\ngetting around to settle these things, that there isn't\nenough money to pay fully the postpetition or let's --\nno, to pay fully domestic support obligations, wages,\nand also Federal taxes.\nIsn't that -- that's where it's going to\nshow up, because the question will be, do you have to\nshave the Federal taxes because they're coming in to be\npaid as an administrative expense priority which is\nonly there as number 2, I think, in light of number 1.\nOr do you not shave them at all? If they're liable\npersonally, there isn't any reduction in the amount of\nthe Federal Government -- if they're allowed because\nit's one of the estate's expenses basically, using the\nestate very, very loosely, then they would have to take\na reduction, too. Am I right? Are you following it?\nMR. SHAH: I think so. Let me try to say\nwhat I think what you're saying. Under chapter 12 and\n13, if it is in fact a priority claim, whether it's a\npriority claim or an administrative expense, those have\nto be paid in full. There isn't an ability for the\ncourt to shave those --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No. The administrative\nexpenses don't have to be paid in full if there isn't\nenough money for them too in unsecured claims for\ndomestic support obligations, because administrative\nexpenses is the second priority; it isn't the first.\nMR. SHAH: Okay. So, Your Honor, there is a\nmisunderstanding I think in what you are saying. That\nis, in a chapter 12 plan, the priorities matter more in\nterms of the relative priority between category 1, 2, 3,\n4, 5, 6, 7, and 8. They matter more in a chapter 7\nliquidation where there's a finite set of assets being\nliquidated, and then those will be paid out in the\npriority that you're talking about. In a chapter 12 or\n13 case, there's going to be a plan proposed, and that\nplan will be confirmed.\nNow, under 1222(a)(2), any of those priority\nclaims, whether it's first priority or eighth priority,\nhas to be set out and to be paid in full in order for\nthe plan to be confirmed.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay.\nMR. SHAH: So, the plan won't be confirmed\nat all. There isn't a matter of ordering the priorities\nin a chapter 12 or 13 case.\nNow, if I could turn back to Justice\nSotomayor's question.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could you turn back\nto -- before you answer my other question, could you\nfinish your thought on what you're doing with wages?\nAre they given priority or aren't they? If you're\nsaying they're not -- if we accept your reading of this,\nemployee wage taxes are not administrative expenses.\nMR. SHAH: Right. Well, Your Honor, they're\ncertainly not administrative expenses under the\ndefinition of incurred by the estate. That would be the\nrelevant issue in this case. They may come under the\nother definition of administrative expense; that is, the\ncosts -- necessary costs of preserving the estate, like\nwages. If you consider the employment payroll tax\nthat's paid simultaneously as the wage, as part and\nparcel of the wages, you could get at it that way. But,\nagain, that doesn't have anything to do with the\n\"incurred by the estate\" language.\nThe \"incurred by the estate\" language, as\nyou properly point out, is relevant -- the most relevant\nprovisions as to whether a tax is incurred by the estate\nare sections 346(b) and 1398 and 1399 --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: How does that work,\nMr. Shah? Because this was a part of your argument that\nI have to say sort of tripped me up --\nMR. SHAH: Okay.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: -- because you define\n\"incurred by the estate\" by reference to those\nprovisions, but those provisions were enacted 2 years\nand 4 years after the phrase that you are trying to\ndefine.\nMR. SHAH: Sure.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: So, it must have been a very\nprescient Congress.\nMR. SHAH: Well, Your Honor it was a\nprescient Congress, because in the legislative history\nthat we cite, they say -- and it's not true that all of\nthe -- separate taxable entity rules weren't implemented\nuntil afterwards. There -- section 346, which dealt\nadmittedly only with State and local taxes, they set up\nrules, the same separate taxable entity rules that\nCongress later enacted 2 years later, to apply to State\nand local entities. And that's the provision 346 that's\nreprinted in our appendix at page 2.\nWhat Congress said when they passed 346 is\n\"we fully\" -- \"we fully expect\" -- and as they had\noriginally drafted them in the 1978 Act, to also apply\nto Federal taxes. But it decided to pull them out of\nthe Act so as not to step on the shoes of the\njurisdiction of the Ways and Means Committee. That's\nthe explanation that Congress provided and then 2\nyears --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: But you're saying that as of\n1978, there was kind of an idea in people's heads about\nthis separate tax entity or at least in some people's\nheads, but that idea had never been converted into any\nstatutory language. And you're suggesting that we\nshould take this phrase \"incurred by the estate\" and\nread it as if they were referring to something real that\nwas in a statute.\nMR. SHAH: It's not simply taking out of\ntheir head, Your Honor; the section 346 rules which are\nparallel and apply to State and local taxes, those\ndidn't come out of nowhere. Those came out of prior IRS\nrulings as to when there is a separate taxable entity in\na bankruptcy case.\nThere were pre-existing -- before the 1978\nAct, in particular, there was a 1972 IRS revenue ruling\nwhich set forth the rules about when there is a separate\ntaxable entity, whether the Act should -- whether the\ntax should be taxed to the estate or to the debtor.\nSection 346 in the 1978 Act codified those rules for\nState and local income taxes.\nIn the intervening 2 years between 1978 and\n1980 when Congress consummated the step and extended\nthose to Federal taxes, the IRS was still applying its\npre-existing practice based on its revenue ruling. So,\nthere wasn't a gap where there was no guidance as to\nwhether -- how to determine whether these were incurred\nby the estate or not.\nCourts may -- courts readily would have\nlooked, I presume, to the 1972 Treasury ruling and the\nparallel 346 rulings in that gap time until the\nlegislative guidance came along and then codified that\nresult with respect to Federal taxes.\nNow, I think to --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Can I ask another\nquestion --\nMR. SHAH: Sure.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: -- while we are on this?\nBecause the 1398, 1399 would suggest that we're looking\nto this separate taxable entity, but if I understand\ncorrectly, in the corporate context, the IRS actually\ndoes not look to that. It looks to just the question of\nwho's filing the tax return.\nSo, if that's the case, aren't you, in that\nvery large bankruptcy context, losing your textual\nanchor entirely?\nMR. SHAH: No, Your Honor. There are two\nways that a bankruptcy estate can incur a tax. One is\nif it's a separate taxable entity, then it -- then it's\nresponsible for the taxes. All the taxes are taxed to\nthe estate, and it has to file the return and pay it.\nThe other way is if it has the duty to file\nthe return. That's a different provision of the\nInternal Revenue Code, section 6012(b)(3). 6012(b)(3)\nalso appears in the Government's -- in the appendix to\nthe Government's brief. What 6012(b)(3) on page 14a\nsays is that, in a bankruptcy case, the trustee of a\ncorporate bankruptcy estate shall make the return for\nincome in a corporation.\nWhat this Court held in Holywell, which both\nsides cite and both sides agree, is that when a\ncorporate trustee has a duty to file a return under\n6012(b)(3), it also has a duty to pay the tax. That is,\nit incurs -- it's liable for or incurs the tax.\nSo, there are two ways to incur the tax:\nOne is separate taxable entity; the other way is if the\ncode imposes an obligation on the bankruptcy estate\nto -- to file and pay the tax return. That's the other\nway to interpret it, and that's why all the chapter 7\nand 11 corporate cases that are cited by Petitioners are\ninapt. In those cases, the postpetition tax liabilities\nare, in fact, incurred by the estate.\nWhat's remarkable is that Petitioners do not\ncite a single chapter 12 case in which a postpetition\ntax liability has been treated as an administrative\nexpense. Chapter 12 has been around since 1986, and\nyet, there is not -- if this was such a big problem that\nCongress was trying to get at it through this way, you\nwould have expected at least a single case in which a\npostpetition tax liability had been treated as an\nadministrative expense.\nJUSTICE BREYER: How would it show up? I\nmean, what difference -- suppose -- suppose you -- in 11\nindividual, 12, or 13, what's the difference whether you\ntreated it as an administrative expense or not, as long\nas they all have to be paid anyway, you say?\nMR. SHAH: Sure. So, the difference is, in\nchapter 12 and 13, they are treated outside of the\nbankruptcy plan itself, but they do need to be paid up\nfront. And, in fact, they receive a special --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No. I mean, how would we\nknow? How would we know --\nMR. SHAH: Oh, that they're treated\ndifferently?\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes.\nMR. SHAH: Through the code. So, in chapter\n12 and 13, 1226(b)(1) and 1326(b)(1), the parallel\nprovisions in chapter 13, they pull out administrative\nexpenses. They pull them out --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I know. Let's imagine\nyou're absolutely right. They mean to treat them\ndifferently.\nMR. SHAH: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: They mean to treat the\npostpetition tax obligation to the Federal Government\nnot as an administrative expense. But this is an\ninstance where the business will continue, and,\ntherefore, you have said in order to continue, you have\nto pay all your tax liability and all your\nadministrative expenses.\nMR. SHAH: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Therefore, what difference\ndoes it make whether you do or whether you don't treat\nthem as administrative expenses? What is the\noperational difference?\nMR. SHAH: Sure. Your Honor, it would be to\nthe government's advantage if these were in the ordinary\ncourse -- at least before section 1222(a)(2)(A) was\nenacted that stripped priority, it would have been in\nthe government's advantage to take the position that\nthese were administrative expenses. And the reason why\nit's favorable to the government is, those have to be\npaid up front as part of the bankruptcy.\nIf you don't treat them as administrative\nexpenses -- and the government took the self-denying\nposition here in the years leading up to 2005,\nconsistently taking the position these were not\nadministrative expenses, even though it was to the\ngovernment's disadvantage, because the code required\nthat interpretation. And the disadvantage is you don't\nget -- the government didn't get them paid up front as\nadministrative expenses. They would have to collect\nthem outside of the bankruptcy. And when you go to\ncollect them outside of the bankruptcy, there's much\nmore uncertainty. There may not be any --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, it's certainly\nnot a self-denying position now, right? You're arguing\nthat these are -- that the taxes of this sort are\nadministrative expenses when that puts you at the head\nof the line. You're arguing that they are not\nadministrative expenses, same type of taxes, when it\nputs you at the back of the line, even though the\nprovision that puts you at the back of the line was\ndesigned to particularly help the fishermen and -- and\nfarmers.\nMR. SHAH: Your Honor, that -- that's just\nnot true. Dating back to 1998 -- and these are cited in\nthe Government's brief at pages 16a to 18a. Dating back\nto 1998, the government had consistently taken the\nposition that postpetition tax liabilities --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, I'm talking\nabout the position you're taking now. You argue for --\nMR. SHAH: We have maintained our --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- different\ntreatment of these taxes as to whether or not they're\nadministrative expenses -- not solely, but it leads to\nthe result that you get the money first either way.\nMR. SHAH: Because Congress -- the\ngovernment has stayed consistent in its position.\nBecause Congress has changed the rules, it turns out\nthat that same interpretation --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but then\nyou're saying that Congress changed the rules in a way\nthat, as Justice Alito's question suggested, really\ndoesn't do much at all, when what they wanted to do was\nprovide some real protection for farmers and fishermen.\nMR. SHAH: I can't speak to what Congress\nwanted to do. If in fact they wanted to do that, then\nthey did it the wrong way. They could have --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What would be -- what\nwould be the right way?\nMR. SHAH: You could easily enact a separate\nprovision within 1222 that said something like -- use\nthe language something like section 1305, that said any\ntaxes that become payable after of the filing of the\npetition shall be treated as non-dischargeable,\nnonpriority debts and paid that way.\nBut they didn't do that. And I think\nsection 1305 is critical here, and this goes to your\nquestion, Mr. Chief Justice, as well, that the\ngovernment is trying to take advantage here. The --\nadopting Petitioners' position would have a significant\nripple effect in chapter 13. This is not simply a\nmatter of trying to get to the result that Senator\nGrassley intended by narrowly interpreting\n1222(a)(2)(A), and it won't have any other effects in\nthe code. It will have a significant effect in the\nintended operation of chapter 13.\nAnd -- and the reason why that's important\nis, is to put this in perspective, there are about 600\nto 700 total chapter 12 filings each year. There's\nsomewhere on the upwards of 400,000 chapter 13 filings\neach year, and here's where it would throw a wrench into\nchapter 13. If you look at section 1305 of chapter\n13 -- and that's reproduced on page 11a of the\nGovernment's appendix. What 1305(a)(1) does is it\nprovides a special procedure for the government to file\na claim for postpetition taxes, exactly the type of tax\nat issue in this case. It says: Government, you can go\nfile a claim to have that included within the bankruptcy\nplan.\nIf -- if you adopt Petitioners' position,\nthere would never be a case in which the government\nwould ever have any occasion to invoke 1305(a)(1),\nbecause they would --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: But why would that be a\nproblem? You said that there would be a significant\nripple effect and practical difficulties. And I\nunderstand your argument about 13 shows that you have to\ndo this and why would 13 be necessary if Petitioner were\nright, but you started out, I thought --\nMR. SHAH: It -- yes.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: -- by trying to show us that\nit would be a significant practical problem --\nMR. SHAH: I said it would be a significant\ndisruption to the intended operation of chapter 13. In\npractice, it would actually mean that the government\ncomes out better under chapter 13 than in the\ngovernment's current position, because what Petitioners'\nposition would do, if you read --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: So, it just does\nautomatically for the government what is now done by --\nby some kind of government filing?\nMR. SHAH: Well -- well, not even that, Your\nHonor, because under -- the reason why 1305(a)(1) would\nbe dead letter -- you could just rip that page out of\nthe code and throw it away if you accept Petitioners'\nreading. The reason why that's true is because under\ntheir reading, it would get administrative expense\npriority, which are paid up front, super-priority, even\nbefore anything else; but under 1305(a)(1), it doesn't\nget administrative expense priority; it may not even get\nany priority at all.\nAnd so, it's a significant change in the\noperation of how the government would be seeking\npostpetition tax liabilities. Now, it would work to the\ndetriment of the debtor in chapter 13 cases, the upwards\nof 400,000 chapter 13 cases that would --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But those are --\nthose are small potatoes compared to the sale of a farm\nand a boat, right?\nMR. SHAH: I would -- I would --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Would there -- this\nparticular issue of large capital gains from a sale of\nsignificant assets doesn't typically arise in the\nchapter 13 cases.\nMR. SHAH: Sure, the capital gains tax\nwouldn't, but there's all sorts of postpetition income\ntaxes that would arise in a chapter 13 case. In a\nchapter 13 case, those are wages that are being incurred\nafter the filing of the petition. All of the taxes on\nthose wages after the petition would be the -- the type\nof -- would be eligible for postpetition tax treatment.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, in chapter --\nchapter 13 cases are the ones that you -- that are\ntypically resolved very quickly, right?\nMR. SHAH: Your Honor, it is true that --\nfrom the statistics that I have seen, on average we're\ntalking about 4 months in a chapter 13 case. On average\nin -- in a chapter 12 case, according to the professors'\namicus brief, median time is about 8 months.\nWhat's clear from the legislative history,\nthe reason why Congress set up the chapter 13 rules as\nto make the tax incurred by the debtor rather than by\nthe estate is because Congress expressly said in the\nlegislative history, which is cited in our brief, that\nthey expected the confirmation time to be relatively\nquickly in a chapter 13 case.\nWe know that they made the same assumption\nin the chapter 12 case because, one, they enacted the\nsame separate taxable entity rules; and, two, they put\nin actual deadlines in the code for chapter 13: 90 days\nto propose a plan, 45 days to confirm it. So, roughly\n4 months is what Congress had extended.\nNow, in practice, it's been the case that\nbankruptcy courts have extended that time beyond the\nstatutory deadlines. So, perhaps they are open a couple\nmonths longer than what Congress had expected. But that\nwasn't the intent that Congress had enacted this with,\nand if Congress wants to change that, it can go back and\nrewrite the rules to -- to make that change.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, before you\nfinish, could you answer my question of what impact your\nbroader reading, your chapter 12, affects only\nprepetition debts? What else is that kind of holding\ngoing to affect? Your narrow alternative holding\naffects just this issue. That broader reading -- I\nworry about a broader reading when I don't know its\nimpact.\nMR. SHAH: I don't think it would have -- I\nthink -- I don't think it would have any adverse\neffects. And the reason is this: The administrative\nexpenses, whether they're included in the plan or not,\nare still going to be paid up front. If you take\nPetitioners' reading that administrative expenses are\nreally part of the plan under 1222(a)(2), rather than\n1226(b)(1), you now have a conflict between 1226(b)(1),\nwhich is on page 10a, which expressly addresses and only\naddresses administrative expenses, and states that --\nthis is on page 10a. It said those will be paid \"before\nor at the time of each payment to creditors under the\nplan.\"\nNow, if you also said that they come under\n1222(a)(2), which is the only way that Petitioners could\nwin -- if they also came under 1222(a)(2), 1222(a)(2)\nsays that their -- they must be provided for full\npayment in deferred cash payments. So, deferred\ninterest-free payments over the life of a 3- to 5-year\nbankruptcy plan. That's very different than having them\nget super-priority treatment under 1226(b)(1) and be\npaid in front -- up front, separate from the plan.\nSo that -- that is one significant piece of\ntextual evidence that Congress thought that these should\nbe paid outside of the plan.\nThe other piece of textual evidence is\nsection 1227(a), which appears on page 10a as well, and\nwhat it says is that the confirmed plan shall be binding\non each creditor. That's the only potentially relevant\ncategory to the government.\nBut section 101 defines \"creditor\" -- and\nthis is on page 1a of our appendix -- as \"entity that\nhas a claim against a debtor that arose at the time of\nor before the order for relief concerning the debtor.\"\nThat is a holder of a prepetition claim.\nIf a confirmed chapter 12 plan is only\nbinding on the holder of a prepetition claim, it makes\nno sense to include postpetition claims within a\nchapter 12 plan. I don't even know what it would mean\nto have a confirmed -- to have a plan included that and\nnot have that plan binding on the government.\nAnd so, I think if you take those two pieces\nof textual evidence together, I think that strongly\nsupports the interpretation of 1222(a)(2) that when it\nsays a claim of the type specified in section 507, it\nmeans \"claim\" and doesn't mean \"claim and administrative\nexpense.\"\nNow, admittedly, Congress has not been\nperfectly clear in using that term. It uses --\nsometimes it uses the term \"claim\" to mean claim and\nadministrative expense. Sometimes it means it to only\nmean claim. But we should give effect to the\ndistinction between claim and administrative expense in\nlight of section 1226(b)(1), which specifically already\naddresses administrative expenses.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But the problem with\nthat argument is that the two are used interchangeably\nby everyone. Congress, the Court --\nMR. SHAH: Yes, Your Honor. And if --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The government in many\nsituations, given the broad definition of \"claims\" --\nMR. SHAH: Sure.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- the only logical\nconclusion is that it includes a subset, a liability\ncreated by administrative expenses.\nMR. SHAH: Your Honor, and if you are only\nconstruing that language in isolation, if it only said\n\"claim\" in 507(a)(2) and 1226(b)(1) didn't exist, I\nwould be in full agreement with you that you would read\nit to mean \"claim and administrative expense.\" Because\nwe know that administrative expenses have to be paid in\nsome way through the bankruptcy case.\nBut 1226(b)(1) does exist in this code, and\nwe need to give that provision effect.\nThe last point I would make is Congress\nknows how to include administrative expenses within a\nbankruptcy plan when it wants to. If you look at the\ncorresponding provision in chapter 11, as opposed to the\nprovisions in chapter 12 and 13 -- this is section\n1129(a)(9)(A) -- it expressly provides for the payment\nof administrative expenses within the context of the\nchapter 11 plan. Chapter 12 and 13 take a different\napproach, and the Court should give effect to the choice\nthat Congress made to treat administrative expenses\noutside of the bankruptcy plan.\nIf there are no further questions?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Shah.\nMR. SHAH: Thank you, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Ms. Freeman, you\nhave 2 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF SUSAN M. FREEMAN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMS. FREEMAN: Your Honor, one of the first\nthings that Mr. Shah said was that the debtor should\nhave set aside $29,000 from the sale proceeds to pay the\ntaxes. That's $29,000 in sale proceeds are property of\nthe estate. And, yes, those are ordinarily set aside to\npay the taxes. That's how bankruptcy cases work.\nBecause you have 1222(a)(2)(A), that $29,000\ndidn't need to be used to pay the taxes, and instead was\nset aside to be treated under the plan of\nreorganization, where that tax claim could be demoted in\npriority to a prepetition claim and discharged.\nBut the ordinary course is that the sale\nproceeds are used to pay the taxes, the administrative\nexpenses. That's how bankruptcy works. And the\nGovernment's argument here completely undercuts that.\nWith respect to section 1305, the language\nis different because it uses the word \"payable.\" It\nincludes all postpetition, postconfirmation, all the way\nthrough to the end of the bankruptcy case. Not just the\nshort period of administration.\nIn chapter 13 cases, you still have to pay\nadministrative expenses. It's just that it's pretty\nrare that you have a tax that is incurred during that\nshort period of administration. And so, you have a\nseparate statute that covers the whole period through\nthe entirety of the plan of reorganization.\nThe Court was -- Mr. Shah was asked about\ncases where -- and in fact an administrative expense\nclaim was incurred for a capital gains tax in a\nchapter 12 case. We would cite the Court to the Specht\ncase. A copy of that is attached to the professors'\namicus brief. And that shows where a plan was defeated\nbecause of the large capital gains tax from the sale of\nthe family farm. And that, in fact, is cited in some of\nthe -- some of the legislative -- not the legislative\nhistory, but some of the commentary about one of the\nreasons why Senator Grassley supported section\n1222(a)(2)(A) and drafted it in the first place.\nThis prevents a plan from being confirmed.\nIn so many chapter 12 cases, family farmers are not able\nto go through with their plans. And that's why you have\nthe demotion in priority.\nIt does have very little practical value if,\nin fact, it only applies to prepetition sales -- and not\njust prepetition but more than a year prepetition in\nmost instances. The professors' amicus brief just\nrefers to prepetition, and its little chart doesn't say\nthat those are not within the scope of 507(a)(8), and\nthose eighth priority -- I'm sorry, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
