ARCENEAUX, III\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. ARCENEAUX: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThis case presents a simple issue, whether the\nFourth Circuit's decision in this case that a party is not\na prevailing party unless they obtain a judgment, consent\ndecree, or settlement is in accordance with this Court's\nprior decisions and the intent of Congress in establishing\nthe term, prevailing party, in the Civil Rights Attorneys'\nFees Award Act of 1976, commonly referred to as section\n1988, and the two statutes at issue in this case, the Fair\nHousing Amendments Act, and the Americans With\nDisabilities Act.\nWhen Congress enacted all three of these fee-\nshifting statutes, it did not condition an award of fees\nonly upon the result of a judgment, consent decree, or\nsettlement. In fact, nowhere in these --\nQUESTION: Well, the language of the statutes in\neach case, does it not, refers to prevailing party?\nMR. ARCENEAUX: Yes, Your Honor, it does.\nQUESTION: So we do have to be satisfied that\nthe person seeking fees is a prevailing party.\nMR. ARCENEAUX: Absolutely.\nQUESTION: And how is that to be determined\nwhere the case is dismissed as moot?\nMR. ARCENEAUX: Well, I think in that situation,\nwe have a declaration that the case is moot, so -- in this\nparticular case we had that as well -- and then we can\nlook and see under what is known as the catalyst theory,\nwhether that lawsuit caused the defendant to act to render\nthat suit moot.\nQUESTION: I would have thought the language,\nprevailing party, suggests something else, that there\nought to be some nominal damages, or some judgment, or\nsome indication that the person seeking fees did, in fact,\nprevail in a judicial proceeding.\nMR. ARCENEAUX: If we look just to the word,\nprevail, I believe it is a broad word, and this is my\npoint. Congress didn't say prevail by judgment, consent\ndecree, or settlement, Congress said prevail, and I\nbelieve that --\nQUESTION: But the term, prevailing party, has a\npretty well-established meaning in the law, doesn't it?\nIt means you prevailed by getting something in a lawsuit.\nMR. ARCENEAUX: Yes, and I think that's a fine\nway to put it. If I sued someone for damages I think is\nan easy way to put it, if I sue them for $50,000, and they\nhand me $50,000 and say, go dismiss this lawsuit, I don't\nhave a judgment, I don't have a consent decree, I don't\nhave a settlement, but I have the $50,000.\nQUESTION: But that's not the way lawsuits are\nordinarily settled. If someone sues you for $50,000, you\nwill probably pay it, but you'll get a stipulation and\norder dismissing the thing. It will be a matter of court\nrecord --\nMR. ARCENEAUX: That's correct.\nQUESTION: -- that it was dismissed not because\nof mootness but because you're paid.\nMR. ARCENEAUX: That's right, but -- and that's\nthe same thing in this situation, where, when I sue\nsomebody and I say, don't shut down my home, don't throw\nthe residents out of the home, and they say, okay, we\nwon't do that, now, I don't have a judgment, consent\ndecree, or settlement, but I have the same effect, the\nsame result as if they had handed me the $50,000.\nQUESTION: But that's not what the statute says.\nIt says you have to be a prevailing party, and I think\nprevailing obviously means prevailing in the lawsuit,\nnot -- it doesn't say the happy party, you know, the party\nwho goes away smiling. It says the prevailing party. I\nthink it means prevailing in the litigation, and to\nprevail in the litigation there has to be something that\nties the result to the litigation, it seems to me --\nMR. ARCENEAUX: And --\nQUESTION: -- other than simply, it came out the\nway the plaintiff would have liked.\nMR. ARCENEAUX: And that is one of the factors\nthat is looked at, whether there is a causal relationship\nbetween --\nQUESTION: But you would have to establish it.\nIt's not just a factor. You would have to show --\nMR. ARCENEAUX: Absolutely.\nQUESTION: -- that the litigation caused the\nresult, caused, in this case, the homes to remain open,\neven though they didn't have the --\nMR. ARCENEAUX: Absolutely, and that is what we\nintend to do. We were not given our day in court, so to\nspeak, because we were not allowed to proceed with any\nfactual development of that, but we think that we have a\nvery strong case, and we will absolutely be able to\nestablish the causal relationship.\nQUESTION: All right, suppose I sue my next-\ndoor neighbor for making loud music at night and keeping\nme awake, all right. He turns off the music, and I drop\nthe lawsuit. Why am I the prevailing party? I mean, we\nboth -- everybody agrees on the facts. I got exactly what\nI wanted, but also there is no piece of paper in the suit\nthat says anything. All it says is, the suit is dropped.\nNow, I think the Chief Justice and Justice\nO'Connor and I wanted to know why that's a prevailing\nparty within the meaning of the word prevailing in this\nstatute. Nobody doubts you got what you wanted, but why\nis that sufficient?\nMR. ARCENEAUX: When you look to the prior\ndecisions of this Court, the definition of prevailing\nparty under the cases has been, they personally achieve\nsome of the benefits they sought in bringing the suit.\nTheir lawsuit completely changed the defendant's behavior\ntowards the plaintiffs, and in this case and in your\nexample --\nQUESTION: And those are cases in which there\nwas no piece of paper saying anything?\nMR. ARCENEAUX: Sometimes there are settlement\nagreements --\nQUESTION: No, but the question is, is there a\ncase which, the person got just what he wanted, but there\nis no piece of paper saying anything in the lawsuit. All\nthere is, is that the plaintiff dropped it.\nMR. ARCENEAUX: Right. I mean, this is a case\nof first impression. There's not been a case from this\nCourt.\nQUESTION: All right.\nMR. ARCENEAUX: There are obviously numerous\ncases in the courts of appeals.\nQUESTION: Then we're back to my question. Why,\ngiven this statute, is the word prevailing party here to\nbe interpreted to mean you are a prevailing party, even\nthough there is no piece of paper saying anything in the\nlawsuit --\nMR. ARCENEAUX: Right.\nQUESTION: -- but for a piece of paper that\nsays, I terminate the lawsuit?\nMR. ARCENEAUX: Two reasons.\nQUESTION: That's the basic question --\nMR. ARCENEAUX: Yes.\nQUESTION: -- in the case, and I want to hear\nyour answer.\nMR. ARCENEAUX: Two reasons. First, because I\nthink it's consistent with the meaning of the word,\nprevail, which can also mean persuade, induce, or\ninfluence another to act, and second, because I believe\nthat's what Congress intended.\nWhen one looks at the House report, for\ninstance, it says similarly, after a complaint is filed,\nthe defendant might voluntarily cease the unlawful\npractice. A court might still award fees, even though it\nmay conclude as a matter of equity that no formal relief\nsuch as injunction is needed, and the legislature then\ncites to the decision of Parham v. Southwestern Bell\nTelephone Company.\nQUESTION: I'm sure every Member of Congress\nread that case. They ran to their library and looked up\nthat case. You really think that anybody who voted for\nthat bill had the slightest idea what that case held?\nMR. ARCENEAUX: I think that that --\nQUESTION: How many people do you think knew\nwhat that case held? Two? You think -- I think two would\nbe an extravagant number.\nMR. ARCENEAUX: I think that it is consistent --\nQUESTION: There is a presumption that we follow\nthat the Congresspeople know what the law is, isn't there?\nMR. ARCENEAUX: Yes.\nQUESTION: We said that in some of our opinions.\nMR. ARCENEAUX: Yes.\nQUESTION: Cannon, for example.\nMR. ARCENEAUX: Yes, and I think that had\nthey --\nQUESTION: Do they know what the court of\nappeals law is? They know what the court of -- lower\ncourts have been holding as opposed to what this Court has\nheld?\nQUESTION: The Marr case was a Supreme Court\ncase, wasn't it?\nMR. ARCENEAUX: Yes, and this was section 1988.\nwhere this Court had said in Alyeska that we were not\ngoing to have attorney's fee award under what was called\nthe Private Attorney General, and so Congress intended to\nhave these type of civil rights lawsuits filed, and they\nwanted to encourage these type of lawsuits. That's what\nthe language says, and this is what is under the\ndiscussion of prevailing party, and so the issue is, is\nthat what Congress intended, we think that you can look to\nthe legislative history and to the plain meaning of the\nterms, prevailing party, and say that yes, that is what is\nintended here.\nQUESTION: Mr. Arceneaux, in the event of\nambiguity, I am reluctant to read a term in a way that's\ngoing to get courts into areas that it's very difficult\nfor them to maneuver in.\nIn the present case, you want the opportunity to\ndemonstrate below that an act of legislation, right -- I\nmean, what happened was that the law was changed.\nMR. ARCENEAUX: Yes.\nQUESTION: And you want to show that the\nlegislators who change the law were motivated by this\nlawsuit. This is a very peculiar area for courts to be\nfunctioning in, to try to figure out what prompted\nlegislators to enact a particular law.\nI mean, would it be enough to be a catalyst, for\nexample, if one legislator found out about this lawsuit\nand said, why, that's outrageous, that the law should be\nthat way. In other words, they weren't worried about\nlosing money. All they were worried about is, all the\nlawsuit did was bring to their attention a disposition\nthat seemed to them outrageous, and so they said, let's\nchange the law. Is that enough to be a catalyst?\nMR. ARCENEAUX: I do not think that we have to\nmake that inquiry, Your Honor. I think that while --\nQUESTION: Well, I'm happy to hear that.\nMR. ARCENEAUX: Yes.\nQUESTION: But I'd like to know why.\nMR. ARCENEAUX: And I will tell you,\nYour Honor, because West Virginia is unique. It is unlike\nthe Federal Government or most States in that\nadministrative agencies cannot promulgate regulations. We\ndon't think that the inquiry in this case, the facts rule\ninvestigation that we're trying to establish here, will\ninvolve the legislature whatsoever. Certainly we have no\nintent, as one of the amici suggests, that we need to go\nout and depose legislators. This is not going to be an\ninquiry about a legislative activity.\nQUESTION: What will you do? How will you prove\nit?\nMR. ARCENEAUX: We think that we have an\noverwhelmingly strong case, because what happened here, we\ntook the deposition of the State fire marshal in March of\n1997. He said that it was absolutely impossible for the\nState of West Virginia to adopt this rule. Six to eight\nweeks later, he changed his mind. He made the decision to\npromulgate the rules and change the rules as we were\nrequesting in the lawsuit. What happened in that interim?\nWe took the deposition of Dr. Bernard Levin, who was the\nexpert who explained how the States had all abandoned the\nposition that he was taking.\nQUESTION: But he had no authority to change the\nrules. It had to be done by the legislature.\nMR. ARCENEAUX: But he had to initiate the\nprocess.\nQUESTION: You said, I thought, that you\nwouldn't have to deal with the legislature at all, but\nhere it had to be passed by the legislature.\nMR. ARCENEAUX: That's correct, but we don't\nbelieve that in looking at the causation analysis we need\nto look at what the legislature did. It is not the\nlegislature that made the decision to change the rule.\nQUESTION: Well, I'm amazed that you say that.\nI would have thought that anything the legislature\nenacted, you would say the legislature made a decision to\nenact it. Do you think not?\nMR. ARCENEAUX: Clearly they did, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Okay, well, how do you get from the\nfire marshal's change of mind to the legislature's\nlegislation? What's the interim step?\nMR. ARCENEAUX: The unique process of the\nrulemaking process that's in West Virginia. These rules\nare just all batched. Hundreds of agencies all --\nQUESTION: Just tell me what -- tell us what\nhappened in this case. What happened? What did the fire\nmarshal do?\nMR. ARCENEAUX: And all of the exhibits that are\nattached to our motion for attorney's fees has this all\ndocumented in it.\nQUESTION: Okay, but we want to know here and\nnow.\nMR. ARCENEAUX: Yes. The fire marshal changed\nhis mind, made a decision to promulgate these new rules.\nHe has to go to the fire commission and then the fire\ncommission presents it to the legislature.\nQUESTION: Well, is that what he did?\nMR. ARCENEAUX: Yes.\nQUESTION: Did he go to the fire commission and\nsaid, I want to change these rules?\nMR. ARCENEAUX: Yes.\nQUESTION: And the fire commission says, we\nagree, we will change these rules?\nMR. ARCENEAUX: Yes.\nQUESTION: And the fire commission then did\nwhat?\nMR. ARCENEAUX: Then the fire commission has to\npromulgate the new rules, and then they submit them to the\nlegislature.\nQUESTION: And what --\nMR. ARCENEAUX: There's a special committee.\nQUESTION: Was the legislation that was passed\nin effect the verbatim embodiment of what the fire\ncommission proposed?\nMR. ARCENEAUX: I believe that to be the case,\nand that is why I referred to the legislature in this\nprocess as merely a rubber stamp.\nQUESTION: Now, do you think the fire\ncommissioner changed his mind because he was afraid of\nlosing the lawsuit, or because he was persuaded that it\nwas a good idea?\nMR. ARCENEAUX: We think he was motivated by the\nlawsuit.\nQUESTION: Can you prove that? Is there any\npossible way of proving it?\nMR. ARCENEAUX: Well, as some of the courts have\nnoted -- I don't know what is in his mind.\nQUESTION: Exactly. That's the problem.\nMR. ARCENEAUX: Yes.\nQUESTION: What if your lawsuit -- what if he\nhad nothing to do with the lawsuit. It may be against his\nagency, but he happens to read about the lawsuit in the\npaper and he says, this -- what, this is an outrageous\nthing. You mean, that's what our rules say? And then,\nmotivated by your lawsuit, okay, he does the same thing\nyou said he's done here and gets the rule changed. Does\nthat make your case a catalyst? I guess it does, in a\nsense.\nMR. ARCENEAUX: Well, we have two distinctions\nthat I would draw. One is, he knew about the case, and he\nwas deposed in the case. He was active. He attended\nevery deposition, so it's not like he's sitting back in\nhis office, okay, and the -- I've lost my second point,\nbut also there is this intervening deposition of our\nexpert that he's in attendance and he hears what they have\nto say.\nUnlike the regular --\nQUESTION: Instead of reading it in the paper.\nI mean, what difference would that -- I don't see what\ndifference it makes.\nMR. ARCENEAUX: Well, most of the cases that\nI've seen where they talk about the legislature -- and\nthere are some cases that are simple. Some cases they\nhave found, and it's right there in the legislative\nhistory, they enacted this provision -- Paris is an\nexample, where they say in the legislative history, we\ndon't have documented legislative history. What we're\nsaying is, there should not be a per se rule just when the\nlegislature acts that we cannot then present our evidence.\nThe second thing is, unlike a lot of the\nlegislative cases, when they talk about the legislative\ncases they talk about intervening causation, that here is\nsome third party that has taken the lawsuit away, the\nlegislature has acted.\nWe don't believe there's any intervening\ncausation here, because we were suing the fire commission\nand the fire marshal, and they're the ones that made the\ndecision to change this.\nQUESTION: Do you rely at all on your warding\noff the cease and desist order?\nMR. ARCENEAUX: Yes.\nQUESTION: Which, if you had done nothing would\nhave surely followed, and then you would have been the\nobject of an adverse judgment.\nMR. ARCENEAUX: Yes, and we believe that we\nprevailed. We were under cease and desist orders, and the\nhomes were going to be shut down, and all the residents\nwere going to be thrown out, and we presented expert\ntestimony -- these were clients that were 102 years old,\nand that they could suffer transfer trauma just by the\nvery act of them being moved into another home. We went\nin on a TRO. We were able to obtain an agreed order.\nThat agreed order remained in place for the duration of\nthe litigation, and no one was ever thrown out of the\nhome. The homes were never shut down.\nQUESTION: Well, my goodness, you don't become a\nprevailing party by getting a preliminary order just\nleaving the status quo in effect while the case is being\nadjudicated. I mean, is that all it takes to prevail?\nMR. ARCENEAUX: We think that it is part. We\nunderstand that it was only a interim relief.\nQUESTION: Does it matter to your case whether\nthe fire -- whatever it is, the fire marshal's judgment,\nor for that matter the legislature's judgment, was based\non the fact that they thought the law was outrageous, as\ndistinct from the fact that they may not have wanted to\ntake a hit by losing this case? Does it matter one way or\nthe other?\nMR. ARCENEAUX: Well, we think that our lawsuit\nbrought that to their attention.\nQUESTION: But that's not my question. Does it\nmatter, on your theory --\nMR. ARCENEAUX: I think we have to show --\nQUESTION: -- whether they simply said, we're\nsuddenly aware of the law and we think it's bad and it\nought to be changed, or on the other hand they say, we\nthink the law is great, but we don't want to lose this\nlawsuit, so we're going to change the law? Does it matter\nto your case?\nMR. ARCENEAUX: I think that it would relate to\nthe causal relationship. We do recognize that we would\nhave to establish a causal relationship, so in your one we\nmay not be able to do so.\nQUESTION: But why isn't --\nMR. ARCENEAUX: Your Honor --\nQUESTION: Why isn't -- each case why isn't\nthere a causal relationship? That's what I don't\nunderstand. I think he's trying to help you, in other\nwords. I don't think you realize that.\nQUESTION: I really was.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. ARCENEAUX: Maybe I'm --\nQUESTION: I'm with you. I think he was trying\nto hurt you.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. ARCENEAUX: Maybe I was just distracted by\nthe light. I was going to --\nQUESTION: Isn't there causation in either case?\nMR. ARCENEAUX: Yes.\nQUESTION: The one cause, the lawsuit brings it\nto the attention, but for the lawsuit it would not have\ncome to the attention, it wouldn't have been changed.\nIn the other case, there's a different chain of\ncausation, but it's still the same causation. They say,\nin order to avoid losing, we get rid of the lawsuit. Is\ncausation in each case?\nMR. ARCENEAUX: Yes, I agree.\nQUESTION: Then why not, just reading about it\nin the papers, the legislators read about this lawsuit,\nand but for this lawsuit they would never have known about\nthis outrageous law, and that's enough, right?\nMR. ARCENEAUX: Yes. We think --\nQUESTION: The fire marshal had nothing to do\nwith it. He never ran to the legislature. They just read\nabout it in the paper.\nMR. ARCENEAUX: That would be a different case.\nQUESTION: I know it would be a different case,\nbut why would it be different as far as your claim is\nconcerned?\nMR. ARCENEAUX: We think as long as we have the\nopportunity to establish causation we should be able to do\nso.\nQUESTION: And that's causation. They would not\nhave known about this thing except, because of your\nlawsuit, it gets in the papers. They read about it, they\nthink, gee, that's a stupid law, let's change it.\nMR. ARCENEAUX: Your Honor, may I reserve the\nremainder of my time for rebuttal?\nQUESTION: Very well, Mr. Arceneaux.\nMs. Brinkmann, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF BETH S. BRINKMANN\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,\nSUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS\nMS. BRINKMANN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe categorical rule adopted by the court of\nappeals that allows fees only in a case where there is a\njudgment, consent decree, or settlement, is contrary to\nthe text, history, and purpose of the civil rights fee-\nshifting statutes. That rule would deny fees in the most\nmeritorious case that directly obtains all of the relief\nsought in that case if the defendant on the eve of trial\ncomplies with the demand without a court order.\nQUESTION: In this case, was the matter moot as\na matter of Article III jurisdiction, so the judge had no\nchoice, or would the judge have had some discretion to\nretain jurisdiction to enter some sort of declaratory\nrelief?\nMS. BRINKMANN: It appears, Your Honor, that it\nwas, in fact, moot because of a legislative change under\nthis Court's standards in Laidlaw and City of Mesquite.\nThere's such a minuscule likelihood that that law would be\nchanged back.\nThe plaintiff did contest mootness at the trial\ncourt level --\nQUESTION: I take it the usual rule is that it\nmust be absolutely clear that the alleged wrongful conduct\ncannot recur before the case can be dismissed, is that the\nway the rule works?\nMS. BRINKMANN: Yes, for mootness, Your Honor.\nThat's under the Laidlaw case from last term and also the\nCity of Mesquite case, that's correct.\nQUESTION: Could the plaintiff here have asked\nfor nominal damages in order to keep the case alive?\nMS. BRINKMANN: No, Your Honor, because this is\nEx parte Young case against State officials enforcing a\nlaw.\nQUESTION: Oh, okay.\nMS. BRINKMANN: That's often the situation.\nAlso, there are several statutes that we cite in a\nfootnote of our brief that limit relief in civil rights\ncases to injunctive relief, and those are often the most\nimportant kinds of cases that the fee-shifting statutes\nare intended to get at, where a plaintiff has a\nmeritorious claim for injunctive relief to enforce a civil\nrights law, but does not have the money to pay an\nattorney, and no possibility of a damages relief that\ncould perhaps pay those attorneys' fees.\nThe court of appeals' categorical rule\nundermines that.\nQUESTION: Ms. Brinkmann, what if I were a\nmember of the West Virginia legislature and I know this\nsuit has been pending for a long time, and they have hired\nvery expensive lawyers to sue the State, there's a lot of\nmoney involved, and I would really -- I think this is a\ndumb law that's on the books, and I would really like to\nchange that law, but then the fire marshal comes to me and\nhe says, you know, if you change that law, the State is\ngoing to be liable for millions of dollars in attorneys'\nfees, because it will be held that the suit was the\ncatalyst for the change, and we'll have to pay all this\nmoney.\nWhy would we want to distort the legislative\nprocess in West Virginia by making a change in the law\nthat the members of the legislature think desirable costly\nbecause of the existence of a lawsuit, even though the\nState believes it can win the lawsuit?\nMS. BRINKMANN: A couple of --\nQUESTION: They don't think they're going to\nlose. They just say, if we change the law because it's a\nbad law, we're going to have to pay all this money in\nattorneys' fees.\nMS. BRINKMANN: A couple of responses, Your\nHonor. First of all, I just want to make clear that, of\ncourse, the catalyst rule does not just apply to\nlegislative change, and also a point I want to get to\nlater that it also applies in settlements and consent\ndecree cases, but talking about the application of that to\na situation in which there is a legislative change that\nwould -- the legislature would want to make as a matter of\npolicy, there are several approaches that the defendant\nhas available.\nFirst of all, the defendant has it within his\ncontrol, if they make that decision promptly, to avoid the\nbuild-up of attorneys' fees. Indeed, that's what often\nhappens in Government cases. The most meritorious of\nclaim may come in. There may be a settlement within a\nweek.\nQUESTION: I understand.\nMS. BRINKMANN: In addition to that, the\ndefendant is able to defend against the causation and the\nmerits issue in this type of litigation. For example, if\nthe legislature has another reason, they were already\nconsidering it, policy reasons, the plaintiff will not be\nable to establish causation.\nQUESTION: Do you have to show, in order to\nestablish the causation you're talking about, that the\nlegislature made the change because it knew it would lose\nthe lawsuit? Is that a condition, you have to show that\nthe legislature made the change because it realized that\nits law was contrary to Federal law?\nMS. BRINKMANN: No. You would have to show that\nthe claim was not meritless. Our proposition is --\nQUESTION: Ah, well --\nMS. BRINKMANN: -- that you would have to show\nthat the merit -- that --\nQUESTION: So they could have changed it for a\nreason that has nothing to do with their -- with the\nlawsuit, except that the lawsuit brought the matter to\ntheir attention, even though they weren't worried about\nlosing the lawsuit.\nMS. BRINKMANN: That would not --\nQUESTION: They knew they could win the lawsuit.\nMS. BRINKMANN: That would not establish the\ncausation requirement, and I want to --\nQUESTION: Wait, that -- it --\nQUESTION: Why wouldn't it, Ms. Brinkmann?\nMS. BRINKMANN: Because it would not establish\nthat that change was made as a result of the lawsuit.\nThere's two aspects of the causation, Mr. Chief\nJustice. There's the causation as a matter of fact, but\nthen there's also the question more of a proximate\ncausation, that that change has to be because of the\nclaim, not because of the nuisance value of the lawsuit,\nfor example. That's why there is -- the lower courts have\nalways applied the type of frivolousness standard, and we\nsuggest it should be a standard where you state a claim\nupon which relief could be granted.\nAnd if I could, Your Honor, I want to really\nmake the point clear that that is the same standard the\ncourts currently, and have for a long time, applied to\ncases involving consent decrees and settlements. There's\nno reason to treat this case differently because --\nQUESTION: Well, except that the statute says,\nprevailing party, and it's quite logical, I think, to read\nthe term, prevailing party, as meaning that you should\nhave something to show from the lawsuit itself.\nMS. BRINKMANN: And you do have something to\nshow in these cases. You obtained the relief that you\nsought. In this particular case, you have a law to\nenforce, a regulation to enforce --\nQUESTION: Yes, but it's not a part of any\ndecree.\nMS. BRINKMANN: No, Your Honor, and in a\nsettlement, it is very analogous to a settlement and a\nconsent decree.\nQUESTION: Yes, but except that a typical\nsettlement, you'll get some document from the court.\nMS. BRINKMANN: But it's simply a contract, Your\nHonor, just as the law here, a separate lawsuit would have\nto be brought to enforce that, in fact, under this Court's\nopinion in Kincannon, it's not even clear there would be a\nFederal cause of action to enforce that.\nMoreover, even --\nQUESTION: If you get a settlement approved by\nthe court, the court will enforce that settlement, won't\nit?\nMS. BRINKMANN: As your opinion explains --\nQUESTION: So you really have to prevail. You\nhave some judicial power behind that contract. It's just\na contract, but this is one that the Court is behind.\nMS. BRINKMANN: But, Your Honor, it depends. If\nthe court incorporates that, otherwise you just have a\ncontract. You have to go prove the validity of that\ncontract. Here, they have a cease and desist order that\nwas pending against them before the lawsuit that can no\nlonger be enforced. They have a statute and a regulation\nthey can enforce.\nI also want to point out that in both the\nconsent decree and settlement situations, there is no\nrequirement of a determination of any violation of law,\nany determination of liability. In fact, as this Court\nrepeatedly has recognized, that's one of the motivations\nfor settlements, consent decrees, to be able to resolve\nthe case without an admission of liability.\nQUESTION: Ms. Brinkmann, correct me if I'm\nwrong, I think there's a difference between your position\nand Mr. Arceneaux's. As I understood his argument, it\nwould be enough if the legislature learned about this bad\nlaw through the lawsuit, and you insist that the\nlegislature must have changed the law because it was\nworried about losing the lawsuit?\nMS. BRINKMANN: No, Your Honor, I'm sorry.\nQUESTION: No?\nMS. BRINKMANN: I must have misspoken.\nQUESTION: Okay.\nMS. BRINKMANN: I thought your question to me\nwas a situation in which there were other policy reasons\nthat the legislature had taken into account to change the\nlaw. If the lawsuit is a factual causation for the\nrelief, the relief is something that the plaintiff sought,\nand if the claim is not meritless, that does meet the\nstandard for --\nQUESTION: Even if the legislature just read\nabout it in the newspapers?\nMS. BRINKMANN: If it --\nQUESTION: That's a factual predicate. That's\nhow they learned about it, and it was not a meritless\nlawsuit, and that's all that's needed?\nMS. BRINKMANN: If the lawsuit brought that\nabout. I have to emphasize --\nQUESTION: We'd have to read the Palzgraf case\nin order for this all to work out?\n(Laughter.)\nMS. BRINKMANN: Proximate causation does come to\nmind, Your Honor, when we talk about the fact that it\ncannot be a frivolous or a meritless claim --\nQUESTION: But it sounds like but-for causation,\nnot proximate cause, that you're talking about.\nMS. BRINKMANN: Well, I think, Your Honor,\nthat --\nQUESTION: Why wouldn't that enable an astute\nlawyer to kind of spot administrative or legislative\nchanges in the offing and file some suit so they can run\nin and get some kind of attorney's fees?\nMS. BRINKMANN: Your Honor, the lower courts\nhave rejected just those types of claims --\nQUESTION: You don't object to tough causation\nrequirements?\nMS. BRINKMANN: No, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: All right.\nMS. BRINKMANN: We believe that that's the\nmeaning of the statute --\nQUESTION: And you respect Justice Scalia's\npractical point, which I thought was correct, isn't it?\nIt's a correct point that sometimes the legislature would\nbe in just the situation he mentioned. I wonder if that's\nneatly counterbalanced by what I would think would be a\nworse problem the other way, namely, the plaintiff has to\nfight to the last ditch, because if -- he can never\nsettle, because if he doesn't push his most unreasonable\nclaim, he won't get any attorneys' fees.\nMS. BRINKMANN: Exactly, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: That also is a practical problem,\nisn't it?\nMS. BRINKMANN: Exactly, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Is it a practical problem also for\nthe legislature to be caught in what I'd call a formal\nsettlement, with a Government department? I've seen a few\nof those, and if the only way you get attorneys' fees is\nto force the court to enter some kind of complex\nsettlement decree, is it clear what happens later in State\ngovernment? I mean, I've seen an awful lot where the\nlegislature feels bound by a settlement decree of private\nparties, with a separate -- do you see my problem? I\ndon't know if it's a practical problem, but I'd like you\nto comment on it.\nMS. BRINKMANN: I'm not sure I understand your\nquestion.\nQUESTION: If you recover only if a there's a\npiece of paper called, settlement, that means there are\nwords on a piece of paper --\nMS. BRINKMANN: Yes.\nQUESTION: -- filed in court, those words can\nsometimes extend to thousands of pages, and legislatures\nand Governments don't like to be subject to such decrees.\nMS. BRINKMANN: That's absolutely correct, and\nthis is the most efficient -- may I respond to that --\nQUESTION: No, I think that's enough, Ms.\nBrinkmann.\nMS. BRINKMANN: Thank you, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: We'll hear from you, Mr. Cleek.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID P. CLEEK\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. CLEEK: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please\nthe Court:\nLet me say at the outset I want to respond to a\ncouple of the remarks that have been made in the arguments\nby counsel for the United States and also for the\npetitioner's counsel. It was an inaccuracy, and I'm\ncertain an inadvertent inaccuracy, by counsel that this is\nan Ex parte Young situation where you only have injunctive\nrelief requested. There was actually a demand in this\ncase for punitive damages and compensatory damages, and\nthat claim was voluntarily dropped by the plaintiff.\nNow, in response to Justice Kennedy's\nquestion --\nQUESTION: May I just ask for a clarification?\nI thought that to the extent that the action was against\nthe State, it couldn't be brought, you couldn't get\ndamages. The only thing you could get against the State\nwas injunctive relief.\nMR. CLEEK: That's right. The damage claims\nwould have been against the individuals in their personal\ncapacities.\nQUESTION: And is -- that would be rather\nstrange, wouldn't it, to say these officials, who were\nclearly acting in their official capacity in having a fire\ncode and a cease and desist order, that they were doing\nsomething in their personal capacities?\nMR. CLEEK: I believe, Your Honor, that that's\nthe only way a damage claim could have been returned in\nthis case, in view of the rule of the Eleventh Amendment,\nand nonetheless those claims were made, punitive and\ncompensatory damage claims were made in the original\ncomplaint and the amended complaint.\nI should also point out to the Court that, with\nregard to the issue of the --\nQUESTION: And on what ground were they\ndismissed?\nMR. CLEEK: They were dismissed by a voluntary\naction of the plaintiff. I don't know the motivation for\nthat.\nQUESTION: You hadn't put in a defense to it?\nMR. CLEEK: To the damage claims?\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. CLEEK: Those had not been addressed, Your\nHonor. As a matter of fact, as I recall, with regard to\nthe discovery in this case, the only people who had been\ndeposed were two persons from the fire commission, the\nfire marshal and an assistant, and some experts.\nQUESTION: I mean, an answer. I mean, you said\nthey made a complaint that included a request for punitive\ndamages and compensatory damages --\nMR. CLEEK: Yes, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: -- against the defendants.\nDefendants put an answer in --\nMR. CLEEK: Yes, ma'am.\nQUESTION: -- to that claim?\nMR. CLEEK: Yes, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: And what was the answer?\nMR. CLEEK: We denied that there was -- it was a\ndenial that there were any damages due.\nQUESTION: On what ground, because this was a\nclaim about State action.\nMR. CLEEK: There was an Eleventh Amendment\ndefense asserted, but with regard to those damage claims,\nI assumed, from reading the complaint, that they were\nagainst individuals in their personal capacity, otherwise\nthey couldn't be returnable against the State.\nQUESTION: I don't want to deflect you on this,\nbut to the extent that they were seeking injunctive relief\nit was a pure Ex parte Young case?\nMR. CLEEK: Yes, Your Honor, that's correct, and\nlet me respond for a moment about the issue about the\nintrusion into legislative prerogative here that this\ncatalyst theory may engender.\nMr. Arceneaux, the petitioner's counsel, on page\n44 and 45 of the initial brief in this case, sets out that\nif he is entitled to review in front of the district\ncourt, some theory under the catalyst theory that he's --\nhe motivated by his lawsuit the State to take some\nvoluntary action here, he suggests in his initial brief\nthat the legislative enactment would be part of his\ninquiry.\nIn his reply brief, for the first time, he\nsuggests that that's not going to happen, and that it's\ngoing to be an agency issue, and the legislature will not\nbe addressed. For the first time in the reply brief we\nalso find that petitioners have suggested that they\nprevailed because they got this agreed order. That's\nnever been a demand to the district court for attorneys'\nfees in any case.\nQUESTION: Mr. Cleek, Mr. Arceneaux was queried\nextensively about some of the practical problems with his\nposition. What about the practical problems with yours?\nWhat do you do about the agency that is really guilty as\nsin, and they're going to lose this case. They know\nthey're going to lose it, so after dancing the plaintiff\naround for several years, causing great expense in\nattorneys' fees, when the case is about to come up for\njudgment, they just fold, and revise the regulation that's\nbeen under challenge -- don't enter a settlement, they\njust revise the regulation that's under challenge.\nMR. CLEEK: There are two means --\nQUESTION: Attorneys' fees payable? No.\nMR. CLEEK: Two means to address that issue,\nYour Honor. Firstly, if the district court decides that\nthe voluntary action that ceases whatever activity there\nis --\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. CLEEK: -- just enforcement of this\nregulation, or whatever, does not moot the case, then you\ncan proceed to merits.\nQUESTION: Oh, no, it moots the case. That's\nwhy they do it. They do it to moot the case.\nMR. CLEEK: In that case, that is the one area\nin which it would appear that unless Congress has approved\nthe catalyst theory, assuming the catalyst theory is the\nonly means of addressing that mootness issue, unless\nCongress has approved the catalyst theory, there's no\nrelief there.\nQUESTION: Okay.\nQUESTION: The problem goes one step further,\ndoesn't it, because we have indicated that settlements may\nqualify, a settled case may have a prevailing party within\nthe meaning of the rule, and I would suppose that if you\nprevail in any case in which the settlement would\notherwise give the plaintiff the relief that the plaintiff\nwas seeking, there just won't be any more settlements.\nThere will simply be the voluntary provision of the\nrelief, whether it be affirmative, or the cessation of\nsomething the plaintiff is objecting to, and we're not\ngoing to get any more settlement cases in instances in\nwhich the plaintiff ends up getting what the plaintiff\nwants.\nMR. CLEEK: Your Honor, this Court has\nrecognized in Maher and Farrar as well, and also it's\nindicated in the legislative history, that settlements\nconstitute prevailing party status.\nNow, if your question is, if the State or any\ngovernmental body can simply say, we're going to stop, and\nnot enter into an enforceable agreement, is that going to\nprevent settlements? As a matter of judicial policy, of\ncourse, settlements are preferred. Would it cut down on\nthem? There's the possibility, but I think --\nQUESTION: Well, it's not going to cut down on\nsettlements in which in effect they in some ways split the\ndifference, but when, in fact, you have a case that\ntraditionally would have resulted in a settlement, there\nwould be an orderly process, they'd sign a neither party\ndocket marking, whatever, and give it to the judge, the\njudge would approve it, and the defendant agrees in that\nkind -- in a settled case to provide exactly what the\nplaintiff wants, there'll be no more settlements.\nSo it won't affect the split-the-difference\nsettlement, but it will affect the give-them-what-they-\nask-for settlement.\nMR. CLEEK: It could affect, in candor, a\nsettlement where a regulation is involved or where a\npolicy is involved, because in that case it is arguable\nthat the governmental body could simply stop the conduct\nand moot the case.\nQUESTION: Well, how many settlements are you\naware of that are not split-the-difference settlements? I\nmean, what advantage is there to entering into a\nsettlement if you're coughing up everything that the\nplaintiff has asked for?\nMR. CLEEK: Your Honor --\nQUESTION: In my experience, at least, when you\nsign a settlement agreement you get something in exchange\nfor that settlement agreement. If you're just going to\ncut and run, just cut and run and save the attorneys' fees\nin drafting the settlement agreement.\nMR. CLEEK: I have been litigating these cases\nfor 27 years, even before the Attorneys' Fees Act, and I\nhave not had the occasion to see any cases where they\nweren't --\nQUESTION: Well, isn't this such a case?\nQUESTION: You're in such a case.\nQUESTION: Isn't this an example of that case?\nMR. CLEEK: This is an example of it --\nQUESTION: The State totally abandoned its\nposition.\nMR. CLEEK: Yes. It's an example of the worst\nthat can happen under a circumstance where there's an\nargument, at least, to be made by someone who suggests\nthat there was a but-for element of the Government's\naction that is related to the lawsuit.\nThis case that you have before you is the kind\nof case that suggests that there ought to be some other\navenue to address a case where some voluntary action moots\nthe case. However, if Congress hasn't provided for that,\nJustice Stevens, then it doesn't exist and, as the Court\npointed out earlier, if you connect these fee-shifting\nstatutes in any action a prevailing party may be entitled\nto fees, it has to be within the action. We're talking\nhere, Your Honor, about a nonparty who takes the action.\nQUESTION: Well, if you say -- if we're at that\npoint, that is, if you agree -- given your answer to\nJustice Scalia I think you do agree that if you look at\nthe practicalities, for every bad thing you can find one\nside you can find a bad thing the other side. We can\nmatch example for example. Then you're back to the\nlanguage.\nAll right, what about the language? Prevailing\nparty covers their case literally. Then you have Farrar,\nwhich favors you. Then you have, I take it, Hewitt, which\nuses an example of where you could recover where there is,\nquote, a change in conduct that redresses the plaintiff's\ngrievances, and then we have the statutory legislative\nhistory where they define in the House report, prevailing\nparty, they say, a court should still award fees where,\nafter a complaint is filed, a defendant might voluntarily\ncease the unlawful practice.\nAll right. Is that it? It seems to me we now\nhave the whole case, and you have to balance the\npracticalities and decide whether you're going to give\ncredit to that House report. Is that right?\nMR. CLEEK: Your Honor, you're quite right. The\nHouse report refers to the voluntary cessation of an\nunlawful act. Obviously, if Government quits a lawful\nact, even if it's accused -- even if the allegation is\nit's an improper act, then attorneys' fees would not be\nappropriate. Where an unlawful act is used there, this\nCourt has repeatedly, from Hanrahan, to Hewitt, to Farrar,\nsaid -- and Hewitt says this as well, by the use of\nordinary language, prevailing party means that you must\nget some success on the merits. The catalyst theory\ndoesn't provide for that.\nQUESTION: What about the House report? I took\nit that Hewitt and the House report in particular are\nthinking of the case where a complaint is filed charging X\nas unlawful, and before there is an adjudication the\ndefendant ceases the unlawful practice, and it says in\nthat instance the Court should still award fees, even\nthough it concludes that no formal relief is necessary.\nNow, as I read that report, I thought it\ncertainly favors your opponents, and then the question\nwould be whether this Court should credit it. Now, I'm\nasking you that because I want to -- you know, I want you\nto point out why I'm wrong, if I'm wrong.\nMR. CLEEK: Your Honor, I think that you're\nwrong for this reason. The whole background for 1988, and\nof course we're interpreting the two statutes here for\nprevailing party considerations based on 1988, the whole\nbackground for 1988 is Alyeska. The United States\ndistrict courts don't have equity power to give attorneys'\nfees, so Congress must explicitly set out what the\nparameters of that power is and describe, pick who gets\nit. Congress decided in this case prevailing parties got\nit.\nNow, the House report does refer to informal\nrelief, but the informal relief, Your Honor, could be a\nsettlement. The informal relief could be a consent\ndecree.\nQUESTION: Mr. Cleek, I'm not --\nQUESTION: Well, in looking -- right in this,\nwhere it says voluntarily ceasing, I didn't think it was\nformal, but then I thought many of these statutes were\npassed at a time where civil rights violations all over\nthe country were common, and many of the statutes were\npassed to end widespread violations of civil rights.\nNow, with that in the back of my mind, would I\nthink that Congress would want plaintiffs to get their\nattorneys' fees where they led to the cessation of civil\nrights violations? I would think yes. But that's a\ngeneral comment, and I want you to respond to that, to\ncorrect me if I'm wrong about that.\nMR. CLEEK: All right, sir. Let me respond in\nthis manner. The Hewitt case does suggest, particularly\nin declaratory judgment case, that a voluntary change that\naffords the relief might make the person prevailing in\nthat circumstance. I believe that Hewitt has to be read\nwith the other cases that this Court has considered, from\nHanrahan to Hewitt, and including Hewitt, that say you\nmust get success on the merits.\nNow, that voluntary change, success on the\nmerits, and then we have Texas Teachers v. Garland two\nyears later that says there must be a material alteration\nof the legal relationship of the parties, and then Farrar,\nthat says it must be formalized in some fashion, all those\nmust be read together.\nIf you read Hewitt by itself, it does support an\nargument for the other side. I can't deny that. But\nHewitt must be read with all of these other\nconsiderations, and when you read it with all those other\nconsiderations, it does not support the catalyst --\nQUESTION: Mr. Cleek, I'm not a big fan of\nattributing a House report to the entire Congress. I\nwould much rather look to the language of the statute, but\nisn't it -- if you look to the reports, isn't it possible\nthat when whoever wrote it was speaking about voluntary\ncessation of the unlawful conduct, he was talking about\nvoluntary cessation of conduct acknowledged to be\nunlawful, that there's a difference between ceasing it\nbecause oh, yeah, you got us, and we'll -- you know, I\nagree that this was wrong, and ceasing it because, my God,\nthis lawsuit is going to cost us another $2 million, it is\nsimply not worth it?\nBy the way, I'm not sure whether that makes the\nlawsuit a catalyst or not. It probably does. You know,\nthere's something to the claim, but it's just not worth\nfighting it for another 3 years and $2 million in fees.\nLet's throw in the towel, forget about it, even though I\nthink what we're doing is lawful. I suppose that would be\na catalyst.\nBut can't you read the House reports as meaning\nvoluntary cessation of conduct acknowledged to be\nunlawful?\nMR. CLEEK: Your Honor, I think that you can do\nthat, and as a matter of fact it makes eminent good sense,\nbecause otherwise the use of unlawful would have been\nunnecessary.\nQUESTION: But the dividing line that you put\nwith a settlement -- now, a settlement, many of these\nsettlements, am I not right, say, I don't admit that I did\none thing wrong, but I'm settling this lawsuit, and the\nCongress would make a distinction between that kind of\nsettlement just because it's on a piece of paper filed in\ncourt, where the defendant said, I am paying the plaintiff\nout of the goodness of my heart, but we were never any\nwrongdoers. We never violated any law. That counts for\nthe catalyst, because it's a settlement, and then to say\nif the same exact thing happens, it doesn't count, that\nseems irrational to me.\nMR. CLEEK: Your Honor, that argument has been\nmade by the petitioners and their amici in this case, and\nwhat I think you're suggesting is, if you have a\nsettlement that Congress has recognized and this Court has\nrecognized grants prevailing party status, then if you\nhave a voluntary act that affords the same sort of relief,\nhow is that any different.\nThe difference is this. A settlement, of\ncourse, clearly, obviously, is tied to a litigation. We\ndon't need to have district courts deciding whether 52\nlegislators met by their action --\nQUESTION: Well, that means that the causation\nproblem is not a problem. The causation problem is not a\nproblem, but it doesn't strike it out if there is -- this\ncase is difficult because of the legislative action, but\nthere are other cases where it's just as clear that the\nplaintiff propelled this action on the part of defendant.\nMR. CLEEK: Your Honor, the only way I can\nrespond to that sensibly is that Congress had the right to\nchoose. They chose settlement.\nQUESTION: Why couldn't you respond to it by\nsaying that where you have a written settlement you don't\nhave to acknowledge liability because the written\nsettlement is what ties it to the litigation? Where you\ndon't have that tie to litigation, the only thing that\ncould possibly tie it to the litigation is the\nacknowledgement that the litigation was correct.\nThe acknowledgement, since you don't have a\nwritten settlement, that, indeed, our action was unlawful\nand therefore we're going to stop it, at least that ties\nit to the litigation somehow.\nMR. CLEEK: That would be correct.\nQUESTION: Whereas just stopping it, without any\nacknowledgement that what you were doing was wrong, you\nhave no idea whether the litigation was what produced it,\nor whether the West Virginia legislature just decided this\nwas a stupid law, which is frankly what I think it\nthought.\nMR. CLEEK: Your Honor, and let me follow up\nthat with this comment. If Congress, when it enacted\n1988, understood the difficulties that the courts faced in\ncontrolling their dockets, and congested dockets, if they\nunderstood the difficulties that this catalyst theory\nmight present in this kind of case, where you may be\nhaving the legislators' motives inquired into, and\ndepositions of those officials, if Congress understood\nthat, and if Congress appreciated those problems as well\nas what we have in circuit courts -- we have all sorts of\ndifferent requirements for proving catalyst theory, from\nprovocative in the First Circuit --\nQUESTION: May I interrupt you, Mr. Cleek?\nLet's assume there's a special problem when you have to\nprove it through a legislature, but as I understand your\nposition, you would take precisely the same position if\nthe fire marshal had had the authority on his own to\nchange the regulation and just not say anything about it.\nYou'd still say there's no entitlement to fees.\nMR. CLEEK: Yes, I would.\nQUESTION: Isn't that right?\nMR. CLEEK: Yes, I would, and the reason, Your\nHonor, is, that I believe --\nQUESTION: So that it is not important for us to\ndecide whether the legislature has to be involved, because\nyour theory doesn't really depend on legislative action.\nIt just happens to be what is true of this case.\nMR. CLEEK: I think, Your Honor, that the only\nreason this Court should address the legislative\ndifficulties and the concerns about intrusions into the\nmotivations of legislators is that that is such an\nimportant issue that if the Court accepts the catalyst\ntheory that if there's an exception to be made for that\narea, then it ought to be made, but with regard to your\nfirst question about whether or not, if the fire marshal\nhad simply changed the rule and been motivated by the\nlawsuit there would have been recovery, the answer is\nstill no, because the catalyst theory is not recognized,\nin our view, under the prevailing party designation in\n1988 or any of the other fee-shifting statutes. It does\nnot include --\nQUESTION: No, I understand your position. I'm\njust suggesting your position really doesn't require a\nlegislature to be involved in order to have a valid\nobjection to the fees, but I don't really get, except you\nsay we ought to read a lot of other cases, what is your\nresponse to the rather clear language in the Helms case\nthat a monetary settlement or a change in conduct that\nredresses the plaintiff's grievances, when that occurs,\nthe plaintiff is deemed to have prevailed despite the\nabsence of a formal judgment in his favor.\nI mean, it seems to me that reads on this case.\nThere's a fact question, of course, but it certainly\ndoesn't say there's got to be a settlement. It says,\ndespite the absence of a formal judgment, and it doesn't\nrequire a settlement or a change in conduct that redresses\nthe plaintiff's grievances. You just say we should\nabandon that language.\nMR. CLEEK: No, Your Honor, I'm not suggesting\nthat at all, and I think that I addressed that issue\nearlier with --\nQUESTION: You say read a lot of other cases and\nread it in context, is what your answer is.\nMR. CLEEK: That is the only means that I can\naddress that language and explain it. That language\nsuggests that you would prevail if there was a voluntary\nchange by the defendant in the course of the litigation.\nThe only way that I can respond to that is to suggest what\nI suggested to Justice Breyer's question, is that all\nthese cases must be read in context. If you isolate that\nlanguage out, then you have difficulty.\nQUESTION: Wasn't that language dicta?\nMR. CLEEK: It was, Your Honor. It was not\nnecessary for the resolution of that case.\nAnd let me say this about Hewitt, and Your\nHonor, of course, this is perhaps suggesting hypotheticals\none ought to be entertaining from the Court, but if we\ntook Hewitt out, let's assume that Hewitt never happened,\nand you read Hanrahan and Hensley and Rhodes and Texas\nTeachers and Farrar, there is no support in any of those\ncases for the catalyst theory. The only support --\nQUESTION: Well, it wasn't at issue. It wasn't\nat issue in Farrar. There was a judgment. There was a\njudgment, but it was just for $1, so anything that Farrar\nsaid would have been the clearest dictum, because there\nwas a prevailing party, not by much, and there were no\nfees, because the Court said, I'm not going to give you\nattorneys' fees for a $1 judgment.\nMR. CLEEK: That's correct, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: But there was no doubt that there was\na prevailing party in that case.\nMR. CLEEK: In fact, this Court found that they\nwere a prevailing party because even the $1 caused a\nchange in the legal relationship between the parties,\nbecause the defendant had to pay something to the\nplaintiff he otherwise wouldn't have had to pay, but\nFarrar still -- and you know, if we have dicta in Hewitt,\nand dicta in Farrar, both sides are arguing that they have\nsome value, but if we look at Farrar just for the purpose\nof establishing what this Court said is a definition of\nthe parameters of prevailing party, if we look at it just\nfor that purpose alone, then I think that the argument\nthat we made that it's not consistent with the catalyst\ntheory is very easily made and very easily understood.\nNow, if the Court was willing to say --\nQUESTION: Well, I thought you accepted that\nthis Court had said in Friends of the Earth that the\ncatalyst theory remained an open question and that Farrar\ndid not deal with it. That's what the Court said in\nFriends of the Earth, and I didn't think --\nMR. CLEEK: Yes.\nQUESTION: -- you were quarreling with that.\nMR. CLEEK: I'm not quarreling with that. The\nlanguage is clear in Friends of the Earth that Farrar was\nnot a catalyst case, and I'm not arguing that Farrar was a\ncatalyst case. What I'm arguing is that Farrar set out\nparameters for prevailing party which has to be utilized\nby this Court and analyzed in any sort of attorneys' fees\nmatter before the Court.\nSo we have --\nQUESTION: -- simply whether or not someone who\nreceived the nominal damages a prevailing party?\nMR. CLEEK: That's correct, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Okay.\nMR. CLEEK: And the Court found that they were a\nprevailing party --\nQUESTION: And the holding below was that they\nwere not a prevailing party?\nMR. CLEEK: That's correct and, of course, the\nCourt continued to say that under those circumstances,\neven to be given that designation was insufficient to\naward fees, because there were just some cases where there\nwas no entitlement.\nQUESTION: Refresh my memory. In Farrar, did\nthey affirm or reverse the judgment?\nMR. CLEEK: You reversed the lower court, I\nbelieve, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: We held there was a prevailing party,\nbut didn't we say there were no fees that were due?\nMR. CLEEK: That's correct, and I think what the\nlower court had said, that there wasn't prevailing party\nstatus, that's my recollection, and there was some\ndifference there. We had -- essentially the lower court\nhad found that there were no fees, no entitlement to fees\nand, of course, Farrar found that there were no\nentitlement to fees as well.\nIf there are no further questions --\nQUESTION: The lower court found no entitlement,\nwhy? I don't recall that. Why did the lower court find\nno entitlement?\nMR. CLEEK: It seems to me, Your Honor, in\nFarrar that --\nQUESTION: Because not a prevailing party.\nMR. CLEEK: Right, that it was just such a --\nQUESTION: And we found no entitlement because\nwhy? We found it was a prevailing party, but no\nentitlement because of --\nQUESTION: Didn't prevail enough.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: No, we found that they were a\nprevailing party but there was nominal damages, so the\nattorneys' fees were reduced. There were -- the court\nawarded $1 --\nMR. CLEEK: It was a de minimis --\nQUESTION: -- and we said it was not because\nthey were not a prevailing party, but rather that it was\nnominal damages.\nMR. CLEEK: That's correct.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Cleek.\nMR. CLEEK: Thank you, Your Honor.\nMr. Arceneaux, you have 2 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF WEBSTER J. ARCENEAUX, III\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. ARCENEAUX: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nMr. Cleek was assuming a hypothetical. I want\nto assume a hypothetical for the Court as well.\nLet us assume this Court does not accept the\ncatalyst theory. This Court is concerned with the issue\nof administration of justice, and I am concerned that if\nthis Court does not accept the catalyst theory, then the\ngame's been shifted we talked about that Justice Scalia\npointed out, where a defendant that might be incredibly\nguilty on the eve of trial, after the plaintiff has\nincurred a lot of expenses, can moot the case out.\nOn the other hand, there may be motivation on\nthe plaintiff's part to start engaging in gamesmanship.\nWe recognize that once we had the consent or the agreed\norder, we did not have damages. The home wasn't shut\ndown, the people weren't thrown out, we had no damages, so\nwe stipulated to take damages out of it.\nHad we known that this rule might have jumped up\nat us, we might have thought otherwise about the damages\nissue, so there can be gamesmanship on both sides if we\ndon't have the catalyst theory.\nWe think -- and one of the points that seems to\nget lost, we often talk about this as if the catalyst\ntheory doesn't exist, but the fact of the matter is, the\ncatalyst theory has existed. It has been applied for 30\nyears, and the courts have not had trouble. When you look\nat the cases, the courts are able to apply the causation\ntest. They are able to deal with these issues.\nThe district courts are equipped to make these\ndecisions, and they have made these decisions for 30\nyears, and we think that the Fourth Circuit is wrong, and\nthis Court should find, inasmuch as it did in the Laidlaw\ncase, that Farrar had no catalytic effect, that the Fourth\nCircuit has misread Farrar, and that we should have our\nopportunity, our day in court to present the motion for\nattorneys' fees.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr.\n"
