HORNE\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. HORNE: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nThe NVRA should not be construed to preempt\nArizona's Proposition 200 for three reasons. First,\nprohibiting a State from effectively enforcing the\ncitizenship requirement is so far-reaching that if\nCongress had intended that, it would have put the\nprohibition in the statute expressly, which it did not\ndo. Congressional silence should not disable States\nfrom taking sensible precautions to exclude noncitizens\nfrom voting.\nSecond, when Congress wanted to expressly\nprohibit something, it knew how to do it. It expressly\nprohibited notarization and other forms of\nauthentication. This Court has frequently held that\nstatutory language that indicates -- that prohibits one\nthing indicates there's no other implicit prohibition:\nThe expressio unius rule.\nThird, Proposition 200 is consistent with\nthe purposes and objectives of the NVRA because the\npurpose of the NVRA -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: If I see the purpose of\nthe NVRA to simplify registration -\nMR. HORNE: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- how is Arizona's\nprovisions consistent with that objective and purpose?\nMR. HORNE: Your Honor -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Given that some of the\namici explain that many people don't have the documents\nthat Arizona requires?\nMR. HORNE: Yes, Your Honor. First of all,\nthe -- simplifying the procedure is one of two important\npurposes of the NVRA. The other is the integrity of the\nsystem -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, but why does one\ntake precedence over another?\nMR. HORNE: I would say, Your Honor, that\nneither takes precedence over the other. They're both\nequally important. And so -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, if something you do\nconflicts with one of those purposes, why isn't it\npreempted by the Federal law?\nMR. HORNE: Your Honor, I think the question\nis, if you take the two purposes together, does -- does\nthe Proposition 200 strongly fulfill one and have a\nminimal burden on the other? And, Your Honor, I would\nrely on the findings of the -- of the district court in\nthis case. In fact, this Court instructed the Ninth\nCircuit to defer to the factual findings of the district\ncourt in the Purcell case, which was this case in an\nearlier stage.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Why would you think that\nCongress, in doing the short form registration, didn't\nconsider the issue of fraud, and decide that it had\narrived at the balance it wanted?\nMR. HORNE: Because, Your Honor, the -- the\nCongress did not specify what the States could or could\nnot do.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But it did -- but\nCongress did specify how citizenship was to be handled.\nAnd it was to be an attestation, a signed attestation\nsubject to -- to the penalty of perjury. So it's not as\nthough the Federal form didn't relate to citizenship.\nIt did. And it said this is the way we deal with\ncitizenship. Then Arizona adds something else.\nSo I would like, General Horne, for you to\nrespond to a question that's already been raised in -\nby the -- the panel that decided this case originally,\nwhich was, the statute said -- says each State must\naccept and use the Federal form, period. That's the end\nof it.\nAnd then it says, in addition to that, the\nState can do other things. The judge who asked that\nquestion thought it was perfectly clear, you use the\nFederal form, and if you want to do something in\naddition -- but you must use and accept the Federal Form\nand not add something to it.\nMR. HORNE: Yes, Your Honor. I think it's\nvery clear that this statute does not say the signature\nis the only thing that the States can use to verify the\neligibility of the applicant. Now, in -- in using the\nterm \"accept and use,\" Your Honor, accept and use in\nordinary language -- we've given lots of examples in our\nbriefs -- one can accept and use a form for a particular\npurpose without that form being sufficient to accomplish\nthat purpose.\nI came here from Arizona on an airplane. If\nthe airline said we accept and use an e-mail ticket, you\ndon't need to bring a paper ticket. And then I got\nthere and they said, we want to see identification to\nprove that you are who you say you are, that would not\ncontradict the statement that they are accepting and\nusing the e-ticket. They are accepting and using the\ne-ticket for a specific purpose -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: But, General Horne, wouldn't\nit contradict it if instead of saying well, we'd like\nyou to offer identification, saying, well, we'd like you\nalso to have a paper ticket.\nMR. HORNE: Yes, Your Honor. If they -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: That would be inconsistent\nwith the accept and use language, isn't that right?\nMR. HORNE: That's correct, Your Honor.\nYes, Your Honor. And if I take that analogy to our -\nto our facts, if we had changed the Federal form, I\nthink we would have been in violation. But we did not\nchange the Federal form. We used the Federal form\nexactly as it's printed by the Federal government. And\nwe -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Well, you have done\nsomething to the Federal form, and that essentially\ncreates a new set of requirements and a new form.\nMR. HORNE: Your Honor, we -- we accept and\nuse the Federal form. We ask, in addition to that, for\nevidence that the person is a citizen, that they're\neligible to vote. The form is not exclusive. The form\ndoes not bind us to use only the form and nothing else.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Do you -- do you think that\nyou could have said -- you know, we have our own State\nform, which we're allowed to have under the statute.\nAnybody who requires the Federal form has to append the\nState form as well.\nCould you have done that?\nMR. HORNE: I think not, Your Honor, because\nI think that would have been contrary to the purposes\nand objectives of the Act. I think what we did is\nconsistent with the purposes and objectives of the Act.\nBut if you -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Well, how do we draw the\nline? Where does the line get drawn between adding just\nyour own form, and adding a new set of requirements,\nwhich -- you know, you could just as easily have called\na form?\nMR. HORNE: Because the statute contemplates\nthat it -- that it is the burden of the States to\ndetermine the eligibility of the voters. The -- the EAC\nwas given the duty to develop the form, and we don't\nargue with the fact that the form belongs to the EAC.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So that form should have\nincluded the eligibility requirements that your State\ndemands. And it seems to me your complaint is that the\nFederal form does not require proof of citizenship,\nunless you consider just the statement that I'm a\ncitizen to be proof of citizenship.\nBut why didn't you challenge the form? I\nmean, that's -- that's my problem with this. I frankly\nthink that Federal form doesn't make much sense unless\nit's -- unless it's to be exclusive for Federal voting.\nAnd -- and why didn't you challenge the -- the refusal\nof the Commission to include on the form, as additional\nState requirements, the proof of citizenship?\nMR. HORNE: Your Honor, under Section\n6(a)(1) of the statute, the burden of determining\nwhether the citizen is eligible rests with the State.\nThat -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Sure. Sure.\nMR. HORNE: The form belongs to the EAC.\nThe determination of whether the applicant is eligible\nbelongs to us. So whether or not they put what -- what\nwe're asking for on the form doesn't matter. We are\nfulfilling our duty under Section 6(a)(1) by determining\nthe eligibility of the applicant by asking for\nadditional evidence of citizenship.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you're -- you're\nsimply denying then that the Federal government can, so\nlong as it protects the requirements that your State\nimposes, you're -- you're saying the Federal government\ncannot prescribe a single form for -- for voter\nregistration.\nMR. HORNE: Your Honor, the Federal\ngovernment can prescribe the form, but the form is not\nexclusive. The responsibility to determine the\neligibility -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why -- why can't it make it\nexclusive? Let's assume -- I think -- I think that -\nthat accept and -- and employ, whatever the language\nis -\nMR. HORNE: Accept and use.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- suppose -- suppose I\nthink that that does mean that it's supposed to be\nexclusive. What harm is there so long as the Federal\nCommission requires, as part of the Federal form, all of\nthe necessary proofs of -- of qualification that the\nState imposes?\nMR. HORNE: Well, Your Honor, the -- the\nform is -- cannot be exclusive. I mean, even the ITCA\nRespondent and the United States Respondent admit that\nwe can look to external evidence to determine whether\nthe voter is eligible. The argument is, they say we can\nlook at external evidence, but we can't ask the\napplicant himself, who has the most information, to pull\nout his driver's license and write down a number.\nThere's no -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: General Horne, there -\nthere are a whole list of State-specific requirements\nthat get appended to the form. And I think Justice\nScalia was raising the question, did you ask to have\nArizona's requirement -- just as the other\nState-specific requirements -- did you ask the Federal\nCommission to include, as a State-specific requirement,\nthis proof of citizenship?\nMR. HORNE: We did, Your Honor, and the\nCommission itself took no action. The executive\ndirector rejected our request. The executive director\nhas no power to make determinations. Congress\nexplicitly stated that the EAC can act only by a vote of\nthree out of four of its members.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And you did nothing more\nabout that?\nMR. HORNE: Yes, sir.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You -- you didn't go to\ncourt to say you have to include this as one of the\nState-specific requirements.\nWhy didn't you do that?\nMR. HORNE: Your Honor, that -- that was\nunder a predecessor of mine, so I don't know the reason.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Oh. Okay.\nWhy didn't he do it?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. HORNE: I'm -- I'm not sure I would be\ncompetent to answer for him, Your Honor. But I think -\nbut I don't think it makes any difference because the\nform is -- is one thing that we accept and use to\ndetermine the eligibility of the voter, but it's not the\nonly thing.\nMy friends on the other side -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I have a -- I have a\nhugely great difficulty, which is, the NVRA says that\npeople can mail in this form.\nMR. HORNE: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I don't know how your\nrejection of the mail-in, how you're accepting and using\nit when you're refusing to register someone when they do\nexactly what the Federal law permits them to do: Mail\nit in. There -- there's -- I don't -- I have a real big\ndisconnect with how you can be saying you're accepting\nand using, when you're not registering people, when they\nuse it the way the Federal law permits them to.\nMR. HORNE: Yes, Your Honor. That is the\nposition that the executive director took, that if the\nform is fully filled out and on its face it shows the\nperson is qualified we must accept the application. We\nthen pointed out in our brief that that would mean that\neven if we had documentary proof that the person was not\na citizen, we'd still have to accept the application.\nIn response to that, the Respondent ITCA and\nthe Federal government said, no, you can look at\nexternal evidence, if it shows that the person is not a\ncitizen. So the only question remaining then is there\nany basis in the statute for drawing a distinction\nbetween our looking to external evidence that we have\nand our asking the applicant to write down a -- a number\nfrom his driver's license.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Could you also ask for an\naddress, for proof of the address, or proof of date of\nbirth?\nMR. HORNE: If that were consistent with the\npurposes and objectives of the Act we could, Your Honor.\nAnd in determining that, one would have to weigh our\ninterest in the integrity of the system versus what\nburdens that places on the -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But then again, it seems\nto me the Federal form, as some of my colleagues have\nindicated, is not worth very much.\nMR. HORNE: Your Honor, the Federal form\nsets forth certain minimum requirements that -- that\nhave to be met. In fact, the -- the Act says\nspecifically in Section 7(b)(2) that they must ask for\nthe signature under oath of the applicant. The Federal\nform also provides under 7(a)(1) that additional things\nthat are necessary to determine the eligibility of the\napplicant can also be put on the form.\nThe EAC chose not to put anything additional\non the form, which was their right. It was permissive.\nBut they did set -- set up a system of State-specific\nrequirements. I think that reflects the fact that the\nStates have the burden of determining whether or not the\neligible -- the applicant is eligible.\nThat's -- that's our burden. We must accept\nand use the Federal form as a tool in doing that, but it\nis not the exclusive tool, and my friends on the other\nside have admitted that it's not the exclusive tool\nbecause they've admitted that if we have documentary\nevidence the person is not a citizen, we can reject the\napplication.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: How could you establish\ncitizenship without having something mailed in, in\naddition to the form? What are the other State-specific\nrequirements? You have to put down your driver's\nlicense number or some other numbers? I -- I guess you\ncould -- you could make them check off place of birth\nand if that place of birth is not the United States, you\ncould require them to write down some number of -- of\ntheir admission to citizenship. Are there -- are there\nnumbers that you could demand?\nMR. HORNE: Well, some States require the\nSocial Security number -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Okay.\nMR. HORNE: -- which is not -- which is not\nprovided for in the statute.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Right.\nMR. HORNE: But the -- but it's not\nprohibited. And the States were held in -- in the cases\nthat were brought under that, the States were held that\nthey could add it because it's not prohibited.\nThe State of Louisiana -- inconsistently on\nthe part of the EAC, the State of Louisiana has a\nrequirement that was approved by the EAC and is in the\nform that says, \"If the applicant has neither a\nLouisiana driver's license, a Louisiana special\nidentification card, or a Social Security number, the\napplicant shall attach one of the following items to his\napplication: A copy of a current and valid photo\nidentification, a copy of a current utility bill, bank\nstatement, government check, paycheck or other\ngovernment document.\" So -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, that's the kind of\nthing you should have had and that your predecessor\nshould have asked for to be included in the Federal\nform.\nMR. HORNE: Your Honor, the Federal form is\nnot exclusive.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: But -- but, General, doesn't\nthe -- the statute make the EAC the decisionmaker with\nrespect to what can be added to the Federal form? The\nFederal form -- form, you're exactly right, sets a\nfloor. But if you look at Section 7, what Section 7\ndoes is to say the EAC gets to decide the minimum\nnecessary, and it consults with the States and the\nStates can come to it and tell it what it needs, and the\nEAC can take action. But the EAC is driving the bus,\naccording to Section 7 of this statute.\nMR. HORNE: Yes, Your Honor. The EAC is\ndriving the bus as to the form, but the States are\ndriving the bus as to what is necessary to determine the\nultimate -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I don't think they're\ndriving the bus as to the form. They can't drive it\ninto a ditch. They're -- they're -- they're subject to\narbitrary and capricious limitations, just as any other\nagency is. And to allow Louisiana -- to include what -\nwhat they've allowed in Louisiana to include and to say\nthat the only proof of citizenship -- there is a\nprovision in the statute which says consistent with\ndetermining, the States being able to determine the\nqualifications.\nIsn't there a provision which makes it clear\nthat the Federal form has to make allowance for the\nStates determining the qualifications?\nMR. HORNE: That's correct, Your Honor. And\nthe -- and the -- but the -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Now -\nMR. HORNE: The -- the duty of the States,\nYour Honor, to determine whether or not a voter is\neligible, that is a duty that rests with the State, not\nwith the EAC.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's true.\nMR. HORNE: The EAC can only -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But the form has to enable\nthe State to do that. And it seems to me you were quite\nable to argue that in -- in refusing to allow you to\ninclude in the -- in the Federal form in Arizona some\nindication of proof of citizenship requiring nothing\nelse except oh, I'm a -- check off, I am a citizen,\nright? So it's under oath. Big deal. If -- if -- if\nyou're willing to violate the voting laws, I suppose\nyou're willing to violate the perjury laws.\nMR. HORNE: That's exactly right, Your\nHonor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So I think you should -\nyou should have challenged the commission's refusal\nto -- to place that evidence in the Federal form.\nMR. HORNE: Your Honor, the Federal form\nis -- is a tool that we have to use to determine the\neligibility of the voter, but the ultimate\nresponsibility under -- under Section 6(a)(1) of -- of\nthis very Act is with the States to determine the\neligibility of the voter.\nMy friends on the other side are admitting\nthat the -- that we're not stuck with the four corners\nof the form because -- because we've pointed out that\nwould result in a ridiculous conclusion that we could\nhave documentary proof that the person is not eligible.\nSo, if we're not bound by the four corners of the form,\nas in the ordinary use of the term \"accept and use,\" we\naccept and use the form for a specific purpose, but it\ndoes -- it is not sufficient to satisfy that purpose.\nAll parties agree to that.\nThe only question is, is there a\ndistinction, which we do not find in the statute,\nbetween using external evidence that we already have and\nasking someone to write down the -- the number on his\ndriver's license, which he is the one that has the most\ninformation. It's the logical way to do it. In fact,\nthere is no Federal register of American citizens.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: I'm a little bit confused.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I take it -- I take\nit that -- that counsel on -- on -- on the other side\nwill disagree with that and they say, well, this is -\nthis is the line to be drawn. The -- the postcard is\npresumptive evidence of registration and -- and of\nqualification. And if you have evidence to the\ncontrary, then it's different. But otherwise, the whole\nutility of the single form is missing -- is gone.\nMR. HORNE: Your Honor, there -- there is\nnothing in the statute to draw a distinction between our\nhaving other extrinsic evidence, which they agree we can\nuse outside of the form and our asking people to say,\nwrite down -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Other than the statutory\nwords that authorize the use of the form.\nMR. HORNE: Yes, but -- but they don't make\nthe form exclusive. Congress could have said the form\nis exclusive and you can't ask for anything else. They\ndidn't do that. And they had shown when they dealt with\nauthentication that they knew how to prohibit something\nif they wanted to prohibit it. They chose not to\nprohibit this exclusively and -- and so therefore, it\nrests with the States -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Some of us have -- do\nbelieve in legislative history. Some of my colleagues\ndon't.\nMR. HORNE: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. But at least\none of -\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Did he point to himself?\nOne of the concurring judges below said that\nhe found the statute ambiguous, but that with the -- the\nlegislative history there just could be no conclusion,\nbut that Congress rejected your reading. Legislation\nhistory is very clear that this issue of what States\ncould add to the form was raised and permission to do so\nwas proposed explicitly and rejected.\nHow do you -- assuming that I believe in\nlegislative history, don't argue to me that I shouldn't,\nokay?\nMR. HORNE: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How do you get around\nthat?\nMR. HORNE: Your Honor, if the -- if the\nlegislative history were consistent, I would -- I would\nsay that was an argument that could be made. But the\nlegislative history here is extremely self-contradictory\nand one cannot conclude from any part of that\nlegislative history what was the intent of the majority\nof the Congress.\nThe House committee which dealt with the\nvery act that -- that we have said, \"Only the elected\nofficials designated and authorized under State law are\ncharged with responsibility to enroll eligible voters on\nthe list of voters. The NVRA should not be interpreted\nin any way to supplant that authority. The committee is\nparticularly interested in ensuring that election\nofficials continue to make determinations as to\napplicants' eligibility, such as citizenship, as they're\nmade under current law and practice.\"\nAnd the FEC, which is a predecessor to the\nEAC, relying on that House committee report, said that\nan application received by a local voter registration\nofficial is only an application and be subject to\nwhatever verification procedures are currently applied\nto all applications.\nIn addition, Your Honor -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Gee, if I believed -- if I\nbelieved in legislative history, I would find that very\npersuasive.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. HORNE: Thank you, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Could I ask a different -\ncan I ask -\n(Laughter.)\nMR. HORNE: Could I just add one quick\npoint, and that is that the sponsor of the bill was\nopposed to that amendment in conference committee,\nsaying it wasn't necessary, that the States could\nalready verify applicants under the existing law, as it\nwas written before that amendment.\nJUSTICE BREYER: There's probably a\nperfectly good answer to this, but I -- I notice that in\nthis Federal law in 7(b), it says what the registration\nform shall contain.\nMR. HORNE: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Now, there are four\nsubsections and only one of those refers to a particular\nthing, and that is, identifying information. It shall\ninclude a statement, including citizenship, saying -\nthat contains an attestation the applicant meets that\nrequirement.\nMR. HORNE: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And under perjury.\nMR. HORNE: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: It says that. Then I look\nat the Arizona law and it says in Arizona, you have to\ninclude like in immigration -- you know, a passport, a\nbirth certificate, and then you have a couple of other\nthings that show you're a citizen, correct?\nMR. HORNE: Yes, those are very unusual.\nNormally, you just write down the number from your\ndriver's license.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes, okay. That's not my\nquestion.\nMR. HORNE: Okay, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I'm saying given these five\nor six specific things -\nMR. HORNE: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- that show you're a\ncitizen -\nMR. HORNE: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- what use does Arizona\nmake of that attestation under perjury?\nMR. HORNE: Well, there have been -\nactually, there have been prosecutions for perjury, Your\nHonor. But it's not -- it's not at all a verification\nof the eligibility of the citizen because -\nJUSTICE BREYER: I didn't say it wasn't. I\njust want to know, since you have right in front of you\na birth certificate or the equivalent, what use are you\nmaking of the Federal provision that's there in the\nform: I am a citizen. What use are you making of that?\nMR. HORNE: Well, Your Honor, we are making\nuse of it and I just mentioned -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, I know -- I'm sure\nyou are and then my question is how?\nMR. HORNE: By prosecuting -- there have\nbeen ten prosecutions in one year alone of people who\nswore falsely. Out of the hundreds that were caught\nswearing falsely, ten, in fact, were prosecuted.\nJUSTICE BREYER: By?\nMR. HORNE: But that -- but that is not a -\nthat is not a sufficient use or that is not a sufficient\nmeasure of determining eligibility because literally\nhundreds have been caught swearing jury -- jury\ncommissioner forms -- swearing they are not citizens\nafter they had already registered to vote. Other people\nwere caught in their applications to citizenship when\nthey checked and found that they had previously\nregistered to vote and voted.\nSo -- so we are making use of it, but it is\nnot a -- it is not a functional way to determine\neligibility. And in 7(a)(1), Congress said that -- that\nboth the Federal form and the State form as incorporated\nunder Section 4 may ask for such additional information,\nonly such additional information as is necessary to\ndetermine the eligibility of the voter. That shows that\nCongress did not intend to prohibit us from getting\nadditional information as is necessary to determine the\neligibility of the voter.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: General, could -- could I\ntake you back to this distinction that you're making.\nYou said you can't append an additional form, you can't\nuse an additional form, but you can require additional\ninformation.\nMR. HORNE: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: So how do -- what's the\ndifference between requiring additional information and\nrequiring an additional form? Isn't -- when you say you\nneed information A, B, C, D, E, that's just a form,\nisn't it?\nMR. HORNE: No, Your Honor, it's not a form.\nIt's -- it's an instruction to -- to write down on the\nFederal form a number. And there is -- item six on the\nFederal form has a block where you write down the number\nand if you don't have either number -- you can write\ndown a -- a driver's license, you can write down a\nnaturalization number, you can write down an Indian\ntribal identification number. If you don't have any of\nthose numbers, then you can send in one of these\nadditional documents.\nBut that is not an additional form. The\nreason -- the distinction I draw between the -\nincorporating another form or the State form and asking\nfor additional information is the purposes and\nobjectives of the Act. The Act indicates that the State\nform is an alternative to the Federal form, but cannot\ntake its place. So I'm saying it would not be\nconsistent with the purpose and objectives of the Act to\nattach the form, but it is consistent -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Well, what is the -- what\nwould be the purpose of requiring a Federal form if you\ncould just say, and in addition to that, you have to\ngive ten more items of information? I mean, then the\nFederal form just becomes another hoop to jump through.\nMR. HORNE: No, Your Honor. I -- I don't\nthink that's correct. First of all -- for two reasons.\nFirst of all, the Federal form does provide minimums.\nYou must -- you must answer the questions set forth in\nthe Federal form.\nBut secondly, to the extent we add things to\nthe Federal form, those things must be consistent with\nthe purposes and objectives of the Act. And I -- and\nI -- and I justify my assertion that Prop 200 is\nconsistent with the purposes and objectives of the Act\nby relying on the findings of the trial court that\nrelate exactly to that question, finding that it was a\nminimal burden, overcome by a major interest that the\nState have -- has in protecting the integrity of the\nsystem, where the -- where the trial judge found a lot\nof evidence to show that there was voter fraud going on,\nalthough not the fault of the individuals, the fault of\nthe organizations that often fool people into signing\nthe form when they don't intend to -- or they don't\nintend to break the law; but as -- but as against that,\nthat the -- that the burdens are minimal.\nAnd the trial court, the district court, had\na lot of findings justifying the statement that the\nburdens are minimal, including the fact, for example,\nthat if all the rejected forms had been accepted, the\nincrease in Hispanic registration would have only have\nbeen .1 percent, which is statistically insignificant,\nincluding the fact that out of a population of $6\nmillion, the plaintiffs, who have all the resources one\ncan imagine, if you look at the list of plaintiffs,\ncould only find one person out of six million people\nthat could not satisfy -- who was entitled to vote, who\ncould not satisfy the requirements of the Act; and a lot\nof other findings by the trial court.\nAnd this Court instructed the Ninth Circuit\nto give deference to the factual findings of the trial\ncourt in the Purcell case, and the Ninth Circuit ignored\nthat. And what I'm saying is if you look at the factual\nfindings of the trial court, our position is consistent\nwith the purpose and objectives of the Act.\nAnd I'd like to -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: General -\nMR. HORNE: Could I reserve time for\nrebuttal, Your Honor?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- I'm still having a\nproblem.\nMR. HORNE: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Both the Federal law and\nthe State law require an individual to be a citizen.\nMR. HORNE: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's the basic\nqualification.\nMR. HORNE: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Both agree that that's\nessential.\nMR. HORNE: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How do you fit in the\nquestion of what documents you use to prove that with\nestablishing the qualification? Meaning citizenship,\nyou either have it or you don't. That's why the Federal\nform says are you or aren't you.\nMR. HORNE: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So there's -- that\nqualification has been set by Arizona and the Federal\nsystem.\nMR. HORNE: The qualification has, but\nour -- our objection to the Ninth Circuit decision\npreempting Proposition 200 is that it leaves us unable\nto enforce our qualification requirement, which under\nthe Constitution clearly is a State function.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, you have proof,\nthere are people that you have rejected, even without\nthese forms?\nMR. HORNE: It's extremely inadequate, Your\nHonor. It's essentially an honor system. It does not\ndo the job.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, that's what the\nFederal system decided was enough.\nMR. HORNE: That's what they decided as a\nminimum in the Federal form, but they did not say that\nwe could not ask for additional information. Congress\ncould have said that, just as they said we can't ask for\nnotarization. They chose not to say that.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, you admit that it\ndoesn't let you add things. You have to accept and use\nthat form.\nMR. HORNE: We have to accept and use the\nform and we can't change the form, but we can ask for\nadditional evidence to perform our function of\ndetermining that citizens -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I go back to Justice\nKagan. If you don't have a driver's license to put a\nnumber down -\nMR. HORNE: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- this list of things\nsays you have to append to the form other items: A copy\nof your birth certificate, a copy of your naturalization\ncertificate. Why isn't that just creating another form?\nMR. HORNE: Your Honor, incidentally, there\nhave been references to a postcard. The EAC itself says\nput the form in an envelope. And -- and just as you put\nthe form in an envelope, you can put a copy of your\nbirth certificate in an envelope. But I would point out\nunder Crawford v. Marion County, the holding in this\ncase, if there's a minimal burden on the great majority\nof the people and a somewhat higher burden on a few\npeople, that does not negate the interests of the State\nand the integrity of the system.\nMay I reserve time for rebuttal, Your Honor?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes, you may.\nMR. HORNE: Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Ms. Millett?\nORAL ARGUMENT OF PATRICIA A. MILLETT\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMS. MILLETT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nArizona simply disagrees with the balance\nthat Congress drew. And when it comes to registration,\nJustice Kennedy and Justice Kagan, you're both correct,\nthe whole point of the Federal form is that Congress had\nto draw a different balance. It confronted a situation\nin which 40 percent of eligible voters were not\nregistered because State procedures and burdens were\nstanding as an obstacle, a barrier between -- in the\ndirect line of accountability between individual\ncitizens and their Federal government.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And enclosing your driver's\nlicense number is that immense barrier, right?\nMS. MILLETT: First -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's what's keeping 40\npercent of eligible voters away?\nMS. MILLETT: First of all, with -- with\nrespect to the driver's license, it's only driver's\nlicenses issued after 1996, October 1996, and those that\nwere not -- that someone did not obtain when they became\nnaturalized. So you have to be about 33 years of age.\nAnyone older than that, their driver's license isn't\ngoing to work. And, in fact, Mr. Gonzalez in this case\nused his driver's license number and got bounced.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I still think that's a\nrelatively few number, and -- and if you don't have the\ndriver's license, then you can use your naturalization\ncertificate.\nMS. MILLETT: You can -- Mr. Gonzalez did\nthat as well and the naturalization certificate got\nbounced because the naturalization certificate, when put\ninto the computer, does not produce records. It is a\nmistake in Arizona's Proposition 200. Neither way is -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you can say that\nabout any certification procedure that, now and then\nthere will be a mistake. I mean the fact that there is\none person where -- where the computer spit out the\nwrong number or something, that is the basis for\nrejecting the entire system that Arizona proposes?\nMS. MILLETT: Joint appendix page 263, the\ndistrict court found that 31,550 people were rejected\nfrom voting because of Proposition 200. Even on that\nsame page he finds that 11,000 of them subsequently\nregistered, but they had to do the double gauntlet that\nCongress was trying to eliminate. The other 20,000\nswore under oath that they were citizens and Mr. Horne,\nbefore the Ninth Circuit, conceded he had no evidence\nthat they were not citizens -\nJUSTICE ALITO: The statute -\nMS. MILLETT: -- of the United States.\nJUSTICE ALITO: The statute says that\nArizona must accept and use the Federal form. What does\nthat mean? Let me give you two possible definitions:\nOne, the person must be registered if the Federal form\nis properly completed and submitted; two, the State may\nnot make any further inquiry of the person who submits\nthe form.\nMaybe you have other definitions, but what\nis the -- what do you interpret \"accept and use\" to\nmean?\nMS. MILLETT: We interpret \"accept and use,\"\nit's mainly the latter, your second one, and that is\nthat it is a limitation on what can be asked of the\nindividual and that's not just from the Section 4\nlanguage where accept and use comes from. But what's\ncritical here is Section gg-7 which is on 26H of the\npetition appendix here. And that's where they say on\nthis form.\nThe form may require only, may require\nonly -- from the applicant, I'm adding that in -- such\nidentifying information essentially as the Commission\ndetermines is necessary to allow the State to make its\ndecision.\nNow this is not just a ticket into the\nState's own registration process so they can go thank\nyou very much for throwing it in the garbage can, now do\nwhat we would like you to do. It is a registration\nform, and when filled out completely and submitted under\noath, it has the same legal -\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, let me give you this\nexample -\nMS. MILLETT: -- as the registration form.\nJUSTICE ALITO: A person rides up to a place\nto register on a bicycle and gets out and hands in the\nFederal form. This -- this boy looks like he is 13\nyears old and he is carrying school books, he is wearing\na middle school t-shirt, but he has filled out the form\nproperly.\nAre they required to register him or can\nthey ask him, could you show me some proof of age, like\nhe would have to if he tried to buy alcohol or\ncigarettes?\nMS. MILLETT: They may not require anything\nelse from the applicant, but they can certainly apply\ntheir own evidence that they obtain, whether it's from\ntheir own eyeballs or whether it is through records or\ndatabases that they run these through, which is the more\ncommon one, and make a decision.\nNow a decision, the decision isn't simply we\nwould like more from you. That's not an appropriate\ndecision.\nJUSTICE BREYER: His point is, he keeps\nmaking the point, your colleague, and he says, no, that\nisn't what it says. What the statute says is it may\nrequire only such identifying information as is\nnecessary to assess eligibility. In other words, it's\ntelling the people who write the form what they can put\non it. And they can't put other things on it. But it\nnowhere says that the State can't do other things.\nNow that's his point. And when I asked him,\nwell, how are you -- how are you using -- you have to be\nable to use, oh, he says, we use it. We use the citizen\npart and these things on the form to prosecute people\nfor perjury. So we're doing what it says, we're using\nit and it doesn't say we can't add a few other things.\nOkay. Now, that's his argument. Now, your\nanswer, which would be very helpful to me, is?\nMS. MILLETT: My answer is when you look at\n26H it's talking about the form. And first, we know\nthat the commission is the one that decides what is\nnecessary on this form, a decision that wasn't\nchallenged -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Is that conclusive or can\nthat be challenged?\nMS. MILLETT: It can certainly be challenged\nunder the Administrative Procedure Act. It was not in\nthis case.\nBut it says what is necessary on the form.\nNow, when you give a -- now when you say what's\nnecessary on a form you're talking about from the\napplicant. So this defines what is necessary from the\napplicant, what can be requested or demanded from the\napplicant -\nJUSTICE BREYER: On the form.\nMS. MILLETT: -- on the form, exactly. On\nthe form. And that is the necessary information to let\nthem apply their own tools and make the decisions that\nthe States make -\nJUSTICE BREYER: But his problem is how do\nyou get to that conclusion? He says you can't get there\nfrom the language because the language doesn't say that.\nIt says what the Commission can put on the form. It\ndoesn't say anything about whether some other agency,\nsuch as a State or -- you know, sovereign, can add\nsomething.\nNow, that's his problem. And I would like\nto hear very succinctly, the reason he is wrong about\nthat is?\nMS. MILLETT: The Commission, let me just -\nif we turn to 26H at the very top line -\nJUSTICE BREYER: 26H.\nMS. MILLETT: 26H, where it has a number 1,\nlet's insert the Commission before I get to the word\n\"may.\" And that's all you need to do. We know from the\nprior page the Commission is the one doing this. The\nCommission may require only from the applicant.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes.\nMS. MILLETT: That's all the Commission is\nallowed to require from the applicant.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Correct.\nMS. MILLETT: And then the burden shifts to\nthe State to do it. If, Justice Breyer, if the question\nis they may require that, and then the State can require\nanything else it wants, it is an utterly pointless form.\nAnd what we know from six -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me, they may require\nit. It doesn't say they must require it. So it leaves\nit open to the Commission, does it not, to decline to\nrequire some materials that is necessary to enable the\nappropriate State election official to assess\neligibility? Isn't that -- isn't that what the language\nmeans?\nMS. MILLETT: I don't think that's a fair\nreading of what Congress would have assigned to them.\nBut even if it were, Justice Scalia -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: May means may.\nMS. MILLETT: -- that's something to be\nchallenged through the Administrative Procedure Act -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No, no, no, we're talking\nabout -- right now we are talking about the consequences\nof that language, not -- and the consequence of the may\nis may. It does not even require the Commission to\ninclude within the form everything that's necessary for\nthe State to determine eligibility.\nNow, why would Congress ever create such a\nsystem where the Commission need not require what's\nnecessary for eligibility, and nonetheless, the State\ncannot, cannot require anything further than what the\nCommission says?\nMS. MILLETT: The relevant phraseology is\nmay require only, and that is not your normal permissive\nlanguage. It's actually Congress -- it is language of\nlimitation when used that way. \"You may require only\"\ndoes not mean that you may -- that you may do what you\nwant, and they have further down -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It says what you only may\nrequire. It doesn't say what you only shall require.\nMS. MILLETT: But you may require what is\nnecessary to enable. So the language here, I think any\nfair reading -- and we don't strain the language in this\ncontext -- the natural reading is that they may require\nonly the information from the applicant that's necessary\nessentially to shift the burden.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Where you're going is this,\nas I heard you before: It is true that there is no\nspecific language saying the State can't do this, can't\nadd things. But it does make a huge point approving\ncitizenship in a particular way on the form. What would\nthe point of that be if the State could add things?\nSo we must look back to the purpose, not\nnecessarily exclusively the language, of deciding what\nthat particular provision be, in particularly one as you\nquote adding to, what could it have been? And there the\nlegislative history in my view is helpful because it\nmakes clear, for example, in at least one place that\nCongress did think they shouldn't add a provision that\nallows the State to do just what it's doing here because\nthat wouldn't be consistent with the purpose of the Act.\nSo I'm putting words in your mouth, but\ndon't accept them because I put them there.\n(Laughter.)\nMS. MILLETT: I would just like to add to\nthat, Justice Breyer, two points, and that is with\nrespect to citizenship in particular, not only does the\nstatute, the NVRA flag it, but the Help America Vote Act\nin 2002.\nSo even if you don't want to go just with\nthe legislative history, Justice Scalia, in 2002\nCongress revisited the citizenship requirement for the\nFederal form and it added a box that you have to check\nthat you are a citizen -- that you are a citizen. So\nCongress revisited this issue after the statute had been\nin effect for nine years.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Ms. Millett, I want to\ngive up -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Ms. Millett, is\nthere -- I take it under your theory what the EAC\nallowed Louisiana to do was wrong.\nMS. MILLETT: It's unclear. It's a little\ndifferent in that context, in two ways. First of all,\nthe Commission made the decision so they have that.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes, I know. I'm\nassuming that, and I'm saying they were wrong.\nMS. MILLETT: Oh, I'm sorry. And then the\nsecond thing is the information that's required there is\ninformation, for the most part, that is -- that the Help\nAmerica Vote Act allows States to require of\nindividuals. Now, in the Help America to Vote Act, it's\nan either do it at the polls or do it in the\nregistration.\nMaybe the Commission thought it could\nforward it, but at least there you have two profound\ndifferences and that is it's at least information that a\nseparate statute has said States can require from\nindividuals.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And those are -\nMS. MILLETT: But I think it's -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What are they?\nMS. MILLETT: That is the -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What are the\nadditional -- the question here is, is proof of\ncitizenship an additional thing the State can ask. Now\nyou're telling us that there are some additional things.\nMS. MILLETT: No, it's not proof of\ncitizenship. What it is, is an identification\nrequirement that can be applied at the polls or the Help\nAmerica Vote Act says at the time of registration.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Can you -- can you\nexplain -- it's puzzling. You have all these\nState-specific and pages of State-specific requirements.\nWhat State-specific requirements are permitted and what\nState-specific requirements are not permitted? You're\nputting the citizenship on the not permitted side of the\nline. What is permitted and what is not permitted and\nwhat's the difference in the two categories?\nMS. MILLETT: Okay. First of all, the State\nrequirement of citizenship, it's permitted in the sense\nthat Congress requires in three different ways that\ncitizenship be affirmed. It's simply disagreeing about\nproof. So it's not as though citizenship is left off\nthis form, it's simply a question of how it's proved.\nBut the Help America -- just to get right to your\nquestion -- there's two aspects to the Help America Vote\nAct that change this form a little bit.\nWhen you go through those instructions, what\nyou will see -- here's what those State-specific\ninstructions are: They are the requirement that you put\nin an ID number that is required by the Help America\nVote Act required. Required. So clearly, that is to be\non the form because another statute requires it. And\nthen you put on -- it says to put on party\nidentification for the States that have it. Some States\nhave race identified, and then the instructions tell you\nabout the different filing deadlines -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Is all that stuff required\nby the Vote America Act? All that stuff?\nMS. MILLETT: No, no -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Just the first thing you\nmentioned for us.\nMS. MILLETT: Just the\nidentification number.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And the rest is -- is what?\nMS. MILLETT: Well, there's two -- those are\nthings that are in the State -- when you look at those\nState-specific instructions, they are not add-ons. They\nare not adding attachments.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Ms. Millett, I mean, suppose\nit were true that the EAC has been inconsistent in this\nrespect. That would be a different kind of lawsuit.\nMS. MILLETT: That would be a very different\nlawsuit that was never brought in this case. And this\njust -- the Louisiana thing just happened in -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You've got a great\ndeal of reliance on what the EAC has done, and I'm\nsaying if it's not doing a very good job, I'd be -- I'd\nquestion whether or not the fact that the EAC is going\nto implement it is sufficient assurance that the Act\nreads the way you say it does.\nMS. MILLETT: But the Act, I think, by -- by\nits own plain language and by its normal -- it can't\nhave no -- there is only two ways to look at this\nstatute. It either created a form that is simply to be\nthe servant of every State and they can pile on to it\nanything else they want, and that is utterly\nirreconcilable to Congress's findings and the entire\npurpose of this statute, or this is Congress's\nregistration mechanism that it shows exercising its\npower.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Not anything else that they\nwant. Not anything else that they want. But what is,\nin the words of the statute, necessary to enable the\nappropriate State election official to assess the\neligibility of the applicant? It's clear that the\nstatute intends the States to be able to do that. And\nyou say, well, the -- you know, the Commission has -\nhas required its -- its own proof and the State wants a\ndifferent kind of proof. The proof the Commission\nrequires is simply the statement, I'm a citizen. This\nis proof?\nMS. MILLETT: This is -- statements -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: This is not proof at all.\nMS. MILLETT: Statements under oath,\nstatements under oath in a criminal case -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Under oath is not proof at\nall. It's just a statement.\nMS. MILLETT: Statements under oath in a\ncriminal case are proof beyond a reasonable doubt by\nwhich we execute them.\nJUSTICE ALITO: What do you make of the fact\nthat -\nMS. MILLETT: It's a very serious oath -\nI'm sorry.\nJUSTICE ALITO: I didn't mean to interrupt\nyour sentence. What -- what do you make of the fact\nthat States can create their own forms? Arizona has its\nown form, right? And I don't believe you argue that its\nform is illegal. Maybe you think it is and you'll\nexplain that.\nBut what -- how -- and Arizona could put on\nits own form a demand for the information that it -- it\nwants to apply to people who submit the Federal form.\nIt seems like a very strange system. So, if somebody\nhappens to fill out the Arizona form, their application\nmay be rejected; whereas if they had filled out the\nFederal form, it would be accepted. How can that be?\nMS. MILLETT: Well, there is two responses.\nOne, it's an open question whether what -- whether the\nState form, for purposes of Federal elections, can add\nnew requirements, but we haven't challenged it, we\nhaven't challenged here and I think it's -\nJUSTICE ALITO: What statutory provision\nwould you challenge that under? There's -- there's a\nprovision under the statute, the numbers are complicated\nand I don't have it on the tip of my tongue, it says\nwhat the State form must do and I didn't see anything in\nthat that would -- that would preclude their requiring\nthis additional proof.\nMS. MILLETT: I think -- I think it's\nactually a very complicated question. And so to be\nclear, there is statutory language, I think, going both\nways on this question. There is in 4(a)(2), which says\nthe State form has to meet the criteria of 7(b), but\nthen -- and then there is in 5(a)(6), which says, if\nyou're going to be handing it out as your public office,\nit's the public agencies that have to provide the form,\nit has to be equivalent.\nBut then in Section 2 -- I'm sorry to throw\nall these numbers, but I'm just trying to show you how\nit's complicated. In Section 2, the very background for\nthe Federal form is that it's in -- it's in addition to\nwhatever the States are already doing -\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, I've read all those\nprovisions and -- all right. Let's assume for the sake\nof argument that Arizona could do this on its own form.\nYou haven't argued that their form is illegal.\nMS. MILLETT: Correct.\nJUSTICE ALITO: This seems to me like a\ncrazy system. This is like the -- you know, the IRS\ncreating two different tax returns with different -\nwith different tax rates and different tax tables and\nhow much you pay would depend on which particular form\nyou happened to pick up and submit.\nMS. MILLETT: No, not -- not in this sense.\nFirst of all, it would be very respectful of the States\nand Congress to arrive at a balance here, if it did\nthat. But Congress has made clear that there is this\nessentially safe harbor role for the Federal form and\nthat -- and they can't hide it away. It has to be\navailable for the -- the driver's license and motor\nvoter process.\nIt has to be handed out at the relevant\npublic agencies, and the mail form is available to be\nhanded out or online for people to find. And so yes,\ncould it be different -- it's an open question whether\nthat's what Congress wanted for Federal elections or not\nor whether -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's not just\ndifferent forms. You'd have different voter rolls then,\nright, depending on which form?\nMS. MILLETT: No.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No?\nMS. MILLETT: Oh, I'm sorry.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I would have thought\nsince you allow -- contemplate a State form that has\ndifferent requirements than the Federal form, you would\nthen end up with two different voter rolls.\nMS. MILLETT: No -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Some people that\nregistered under the State form, some people that\nregistered under the Federal form.\nMS. MILLETT: As -- as of now, Arizona is\ndoing it as a unitary system. Because anyone who fills\nout the State form necessarily satisfies the requirement\nof the Federal form.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes, but it doesn't\nwork the other way.\nMS. MILLETT: It doesn't work the other way.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You can satisfy the\nFederal form, so you're on the Federal list, but not\nsatisfy the State form, so you're not on the State list.\nMS. MILLETT: It doesn't work the other way\nat least for State elections. For Federal -- for\nFederal elections, it has to be the same. And so for\nFederal elections, it's a single roll. It's up to\nStates to decide how they want to deal with the State\nform. At the time the Congress enacted this statute,\nabout half of the States in 1993, including Arizona, had\na postcard form where you just attested to citizenship\nunder oath.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: The Court of Appeals said\nthat there's a different preemption test under -- for\nthis law under this Constitutional provision than there\nis under the Supremacy Clause. It seems to me that that\nignores the proposition that the State has a very strong\nand vital interest in the integrity of its elections,\neven when those, and perhaps especially when those are\nelections of Federal officials. And it seems to me the\nNinth Circuit's new test did not give sufficient weight\nto that interest.\nMS. MILLETT: Well, first of all, the Ninth\nCircuit's test came out of this Court's language in\nSiebold. It had both conflict language and\nharmonization, both of which appear in this Court's\ndecision in Siebold. But to get directly to your\nquestion of whether there should be a different test, I\ndon't think it matters on the outcome in this case\nbecause the preemption is in those 31,550 people who\ncouldn't register.\nBut, I think the Election Clause is going to\nbe very different in this sense -- in two critical\nsenses. And that is that the Elections Clause involves\nan authority in the States that is conferred by the\nConstitution itself.\nMay I finish?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Please.\nMS. MILLETT: It -- it has no reserve power\nthat's being protected there, and by the very nature of\nthe Election Clause is that Congress only acts when it\nmeans to displace or change what the States are doing.\nAnd so the necessity of having a presumption makes no\nsense in this context, particularly when you're talking\nagain about a Federal form for Federal elections of\nFederal officials by Federal voters who need a direct\nline of accountability.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMS. MILLETT: Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Srinivasan?\nORAL ARGUMENT OF SRI SRINIVASAN,\nFOR THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,\nSUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Thank you, Mr. Chief\nJustice, and may it Please the Court:\nThe National Voter Registration Act aims to\nstreamline the process of registration for applicants,\nand the provisions that provide for the establishment of\na Federal form embody that objective.\nAnd I'd like to point to three features of\nthe relevant statutory language that I think support our\nreading. And the particular critical provision is at\npage 22A of the appendix to the government's brief. And\nI'm sorry, I know that the provisions are located in a\nnumber of areas, but the gray brief at page 22A has the\ncritical provision in our view, which is one that\nMs. Millett was pointing to. And that's gg-7(b)(1).\nNow, what this provision embodies is this\nunderstanding: That the EAC is the one who determines\nwhat the content of the Federal form is. Not the\nStates, but the EAC. The States do have a role in this\nscheme, and I think it's important to understand what\nthat role is.\nThe States have a consultative role at the\nfront end. And this is back at page 21A -- I'm sorry\nfor skipping back. But at page 21A at the bottom of the\npage, the EAC is to develop a form in consultation with\nthe chief election officers of the States.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Srinivasan, the problem\nthat I have with that is that the provision you're\nalluding to says that -- not that the State shall -- not\nthat the commission \"shall\" require the information\nnecessary to enable the appropriate State election\nofficial to assess eligibility, but it simply says that\nit \"may\" require only that information. Now, is it\nconceivable that Congress intended that the Commission\nmay not require some information that is necessary to\nenable the appropriate State election official to assess\neligibility, but that the State may not require it\neither?\nIs that a conceivable disposition of\nCongress?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: I don't think it is,\nJustice Scalia, but I think the problem with that is in\nthe premise. I grant you that the statute says \"may\nrequire,\" but it says \"may require only,\" and I think\nthe only fair way to read this provision is that the\ncommission is to require the information that's\nnecessary, but -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You think \"may require\nonly\" means shall require only? Is that -- is that your\nsubmission? \"May require only\" means shall require\nonly?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: It \"may require only,\" in\neffect, means shall require information that's\nnecessary, but may only require that information. I\nthink the statute would make very little sense if the\nEAC discharged its statutory responsibility by having a\nFederal form that required nothing other than the name.\nThat wouldn't be within anybody's conceivable conception\nof a rational objective of Congress that would enable\nthe EAC to satisfy -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It would not be a problem\nif the State could require it. It would not be a\nproblem. When -- when the commission fails to do\nwhat -- what enables the State to assess qualifications,\nthe State will do it. No problem.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: But I think the whole point\nof this, Justice Scalia -- and this is where I started,\nwith all due respect -- is to come forward with a\nFederal form that streamlines the process of\nregistration for applicants. And if the regime that\nresulted were one in which the Federal form served very\nlittle purpose other than to set a floor, but then each\nof the 50 States could superimpose whatever additional\nrequirements they wanted to, I think that would largely\ndefeat the entire purpose of the Federal form.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And that's the grand\npurpose -- to go back to your -- I see that as your\ngrand purpose. That's the grand purpose argument. And\nthen there is the subsidiary purpose argument, which you\nstarted to make, which I wanted to hear, which has to do\nwith (b). It says may require only such identifying\ninformation. So I thought, well, they could require\nless, less than what's necessary. They could. It says\nyou can't require more. They could require less.\nBut suppose they put a statement in and they\nsay, in respect to this qualification, nothing to do\nwith citizenship: This is what is necessary. No more.\nBut we've done everything that is necessary. Then could\na State come along and say, we think more is necessary?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: I don't think so, Justice\nBreyer.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And it's the word\n\"necessary\" that you thought -- that that would be\ndependent upon?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Coupled with the statutory\nobjective because what this provision says is that the\nEAC, in consultation with the States, is supposed to\ncreate a form that imposes the following burden on\nindividuals, on individuals. That's the key.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, I know I'm not -- I'm\njust not quite -- the last step of what I wanted you to\nthink up was this -\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Sure.\nJUSTICE BREYER: It does say \"may require\nonly\" -\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Correct.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- \"that which is\nnecessary.\" So if they said -- and this what is\nnecessary. Fine. Pretty tough for the State to say I'm\ngoing to add some things. But the very next subsection\ndoes use the words \"shall include.\" So I wonder -- and\nthat has to do with citizenship. So I wonder if that is\na statement by Congress that in respect to citizenship,\nthat is what is necessary.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: I do think that that's what\nCongress contemplated was necessary, but it's not to the\nexclusion of this, which is that if a State comes\nforward to the EAC, which is a body that's charged with\nresponsibility for defining the contents of the Federal\nform, and says we think something more is necessary.\nTake a look at what we want to submit to you, and you\nshould amend the Federal form, or you should at least\namend our State-specific portion of the Federal form to\ninclude this requirement in it, the EAC could make that\ndetermination.\nCongress made that responsibility -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Srinivasan, I think\nGeneral Horne told us that -- that the State did ask the\nCommission, but the Commission had only two members; the\nCommission didn't act on it. Only the legal director.\nSo how could they get court review of an agency decision\nthat was never made?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: No, Justice -- Justice\nGinsburg, to be clear, I don't -- I don't think General\nHorne would disagree with this, the executive director\ninitially responded to the request by rejecting it, but\nit did go to the full Commission, and at that point,\nthere was a fully-constituted Commission. The\nCommission divided by a vote of 2-2.\nAnd so in that instance, the Commission took\nno action. But a 2-2 vote is a -- qualifies as a\nrejection. And that is something that could -\npotentially could have been the subject of judicial\nreview. Now, I'm obviously not going to give away any\nFederal defenses, but -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes. And since you believe\nthat \"may require only\" means \"shall require only,\" in\njudicial review, a determination before the -- the Court\nwould be whether indeed this information is necessary to\nenable the State to assess the qualifications, right?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Well, that -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And the district court here\ncertainly thought that was necessary. So you're going\nto be in -- in bad shape -- the government is going to\nbe -- the next time somebody does challenge the\nCommission determination in court under the\nAdministrative Procedure Act.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: I mean, obviously, I'd\nrespectfully disagree with that. I think we'll be in\nperfectly good shape. And I think part of the reason is\nthat this -- requiring a statement under penalty of\nperjury is the traditional way in which States enforce\ntheir qualifications.\nThe legislative history shows that Congress\nunderstood that that was the traditional way. What the\nState seeks to do here is do something over and above\nthe traditional way to enforce qualifications.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: As -- as Louisiana\nhas done.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Well, Louisiana is not -\nis not citizenship-specific here, Your Honor, as\nMs. Millett was pointing out -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But it's certainly\nthings that were not required in the Federal form.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: That's correct. And that\nwas submitted to the EAC, and the EAC approved of it.\nAnd I think that's the critical distinction here.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How is that\nconsistent with the statutory purpose to streamline\nregistration?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Because the statute -- the\nstatute seeks to streamline registration, but it's not\ndirected to the exclusion of all other objectives. And\nthe EAC is charged with balancing the various competing\nstatutory objectives. And it concluded in -- with\nrespect to the Louisiana submission -- that that one was\nokay. I do think that's different. A, because the EAC\napproved of it; and B, because the specific forms of\nidentification that are outlined in Louisiana addition\nwere exactly those forms of identification that Congress\nalready said was okay at either the registration stage\nor the voting stage.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You got to stop saying the\nCommission approved of it. 2-2 is not approving. You\ncould say the Commission was unable to disapprove of it.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Well, I think we are\ntalking about two different things, Justice Scalia. I'm\ntalking about Louisiana.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I'm sorry. I'm sorry.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: I was trying to answer the\nChief Justice's question.\nIn Arizona, it was 2-2.\nNow, I want to point out one other critical\nfeature of the statute, and General Horne alluded to\nthis and said that there's no way to look in the statute\nand see a distinction between on one hand what the\nindividuals can be required to provide, and on the other\nhand what the State can then do with the individual\ninformation to crosscheck it.\nAnd the statute presupposes that the State\ncan conduct its own investigation to crosscheck the\ninformation that the individual supplies. And maybe the\ncritical provision to see that is at page 19A of the\nappendix to the government's brief. And that's a\nprovision that deals with a different qualification,\nfelony history. But it operates on this assumption that\nStates can conduct their own investigation, which makes\nall the sense in the world.\nThis one -- this provision that's in\nsubsection (g) at the top of the page, which is 1973\ngg-6(g), what this does is it tells the United States\nAttorney's Offices that when there is a Federal\nconviction of a felony, the U.S. Attorney's Office is\nsupposed to give written notice of that conviction to\nthe chief State election official.\nAnd what's the State -- chief State election\nofficial going to do with that? Well of course, what\nthey're going to do is they're going to take a look at\nthe Federal form, they're going to see what the\nindividual said about their felony history, and they're\ngoing to crosscheck it -- this information that they got\nfrom the United States Attorney -- to make sure that the\ninformation on the form is accurate.\nJUSTICE ALITO: May I ask you a question\nthat I asked Ms. Millett? Does the United States think\nthat the Arizona form is illegal? And if it is not,\nwhat sense does it make to have a system in which\nwhether or not someone will successfully register\ndepends on the happenstance of the particular form that\nthe person fills out.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Here is the sense it would\nmake -- even if -- if Arizona had the authority to add\nto the Federal requirements on its own State form, the\nsense it would make is this: That the Federal form\nalways operates as a floor.\nIt's always there for somebody to use to\nregister, regardless of what the State form might do in\naddition. And that has -- I take Your Honor's\nassumption -- if I can just briefly finish -- I\nunderstand Your Honor's point that there is a practical\nquestion about whether that would ever be practicable or\nuseful, given that an individual would want to use the\nState form for State, local and Federal elections, but\nthere is also the -- the well-understood practice of\norganizations that go out to register individuals to\nvote.\nAnd they can use the Federal form, and the\nFederal form would suffice.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nGeneral Horne, two minutes.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS C. HORNE\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. HORNE: Thank you, Your Honor, and I'll\napologize in advance for talking really quickly. The -\nmy friend says in discussing Section 7(b)(1) that it\nwould not be rational to require only the signature.\nBut that's exactly what they did. All they required was\nthe signature, and 7(b)(1) has nothing to do with that;\n7(b)(2) requires a signature. So what the EAC chose to\ndo under 7(b)(1) was exactly nothing, zero, which -\nwhich emphasizes the point that this is the\nresponsibility of the States, and that's how they\nunderstood it.\nWith respect to the license having -- we\ncited ARA Section 28-3173, an Arizona statute in our\nreply brief that provides that you -- you must renew\nevery 12 years. So by 2004, the problem that my friend\nspoke about was completely erased. Everybody had a new\nlicense which would be sufficient for this purpose, 100\npercent.\nThey admit that we can reject applications\nby reference to other -- by reference to other\ndocumentation, but they try to draw a distinction\nbetween that and asking the person to write down the\ndriver's license number. But there is nothing in the\nstatute that justifies that distinction. A reference to\ncriminal history has nothing to do with -- with whether\nor not there is a distinction with respect to\ncitizenship between looking at other documents and\nasking the person for their driver's license numbers.\nIn both cases, it's something outside of the form and\nthey have admitted we can go outside the form.\nWith respect to legislative history, Your\nHonor, I think the key thing -- Mr. Justice Breyer, in\nyour question was, it's only in one place. There are a\nlot of other places that go the other way. So we cannot\nconclude from that one place what the majority of\nCongress expected.\nWith respect to HAVA, in HAVA, the Congress\nhad another opportunity to expressly state that the\nState could not look to external evidence and ask for\nadditional evidence, and they chose not to do that. And\nso I would say that HAVA is further evidence that\nCongress was not choosing to prohibit us from asking for\nadditional information to fulfill our function, if it's\nnecessary, of being sure that the applicant is eligible\nto vote.\nWith respect to the Siebold case, the court\nin Siebold specifically said there will be no preemption\nunless there is a direct conflict and only to the extent\nof that conflict, and in that connection -- one last\nsentence, Your Honor -- if there are two plausible\ninterpretations, ordinary principles of Federalism say\none should not choose the interpretation that results in\npreemption, and the same thing applies with respect to\nthe canon of constitutional accordance.\nThank you, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
