WAXMAN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. WAXMAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThis case involves a regulation promulgated by\nthe Federal Reserve Board to govern the disclosure of fees\nimposed for exceeding a credit limit. It does not involve\nany challenge to the fees themselves or any contention\nthat the fees were not disclosed. Unquestionably they\nwere. This case concerns only how such fees should be\ncharacterized when they are disclosed.\nQUESTION: Would you enlighten us on just how\nthis transaction gets authorized in the ordinary course of\nevents and in this event? Is there any special call made,\nor is the credit card just submitted to the store and the\nstore processes it and if it's not rejected, it goes\nthrough? What happens?\nMR. WAXMAN: Well, as the Solicitor General has\nexplained in his brief for the Federal Reserve Board,\nordinarily the arrangement between banks -- that is, the\nbanks that issue the cards and the banks that do the\ncorresponding relationship with the merchants -- have an\nagreement between the merchants and the banks where the\nmerchant will be liable for fraudulent use of the card or\nthe other unless it obtains authorization to process the\ncharge. And so in the ordinary practice, the board has\nexplained, a merchant may or may not, is not required to,\nbut may well call in the charge or submit the account\nnumber to the issuing bank via the correspondent bank and\nget an approval, yes or no, to process the charge.\nNow, the board has explained that when the\nissuing bank authorizes the merchant to process the\ncharge, that two important things don't happen. One, it\ndoes not in any way represent a renegotiation between the\nconsumer and the issuing bank, and it says nothing about\nthe overall credit limit. And two, the issuing bank often\nwill have no idea whether the charge being authorized will\nor will not trigger a credit limit of the consumer for a\nvariety of reasons, not the least of which is that, as the\nboard explains, credits and payments aren't instantly\nreflected, merchants often don't put the true amount of\nthe charge in. They may, as hotels and -- and rental car\ncompanies do -- often block very large amounts because\nthey don't know what the ultimate charge will be.\nAnd there is also a recognition in the industry,\nthe board explains, of a certain tolerance. That is, the\nmerchant -- the credit card company won't always want to\ncut somebody off whenever it has a suspicion that they may\nhit their credit limit because the merchant has a\nrelationship with the customer. And since the system of\ninformation is so imperfect, the issuing bank also has a\nrelationship with its consumer and doesn't want to\nembarrass the consumer.\nSo the short answer to that -- the short version\nof the very long answer is in the ordinary course,\nmerchants have an incentive to seek authorization, but\nthey're not required to, and the authorization that's\ngiven doesn't reflect knowledge by the issuer that a\ncredit limit will be exceeded.\nQUESTION: But, Mr. Waxman, is it not true that\nthere are many occasions on which the credit limit will,\nin fact, be exceeded and there will, nevertheless, come\nback an approval, and that the customer in those cases may\nor may not know that his -- that, A, his limit was\nexceeded, and B, that he's going to be charged for it?\nMR. WAXMAN: Well, the creditor -- the consumer\nmay or may not know that his or her credit limit was\nexceeded, but of course, that information is entirely\nwithin the knowledge of the -- the potential knowledge of\nthe consumer because the consumer does know what or -\nwhat charges he or she has made and what payments he or\nshe has made.\nQUESTION: Well, not necessarily. You can have\na card owned by two or three people in the same family and\nmaybe the husband spent some money that the wife didn't\nknow about while this was going on. So it's at least\npossible that they would exceed the credit limit without\nthe credit cardholder knowing it, their not being aware of\nit, not keeping track of it.\nMR. WAXMAN: Well, the -\nQUESTION: And -- and I'm just asking you, is it\nnot true that it is possible that he will receive an\naffirmative answer to using the card without knowing\nwhether or not he exceeded the limit and therefore is\ngoing to be -- be charged for it?\nMR. WAXMAN: It's possible either because he\ndoesn't keep good track or he doesn't -- he's not accurate\nor he's allowed a child or a spouse to use the card and\nisn't keeping track or control of that.\nBut one thing that you said, Your Honor, that is\nnot true is the issuing -- the credit card issuer is not\ngiving permission directly to the consumer to do anything,\nand most particularly if -\nQUESTION: Well, but I'm not sure that's right.\nIf the -- if the credit card issuer is informed of the\novercharge, that it's over the limit, and decides this is\na good customer, well, let's not charge him for it or\nlet's okay it anyway, he gives that information to the\nmerchant and the merchant may not tell the customer\nanything about it.\nMR. WAXMAN: The merchant -\nQUESTION: Isn't that true?\nMR. WAXMAN: The merchant won't know. The\nmerchant isn't going to tell the customer anything.\nQUESTION: No.\nMR. WAXMAN: And the credit card issuer may not\nknow.\nQUESTION: But he may know.\nMR. WAXMAN: But you're positing -\nQUESTION: That's my point.\nMR. WAXMAN: Yes.\nQUESTION: The credit company may know and he\nwill not pass that information on to the consumer.\nMR. WAXMAN: There is a credit -- there is an\nagreement that must be accepted -\nQUESTION: Well, am I correct on my facts?\nMR. WAXMAN: You're --\nQUESTION: Is it not possible?\nMR. WAXMAN: You are correct that it is possible\nthat the consumer won't realize it and the issuer may\nknow. And in that instance, the issuer, which has no\nrelationship directly with the consumer, doesn't tell the\nmerchant to tell the consumer.\nQUESTION: Correct.\nMR. WAXMAN: But, Justice Stevens -\nQUESTION: And so the consumer may end up paying\na charge that he didn't realize he'd incurred.\nMR. WAXMAN: Well, the -\nQUESTION: Is that correct or not?\nMR. WAXMAN: That is only partially correct.\nIt's correct factually given the hypothetical that you've\narticulated. It's incorrect legally because the credit\nagreement -- it must -\nQUESTION: If he has -- if he knows two things.\nHe knows the fine print on the credit agreement and, two,\nhe knows the status of his balance.\nMR. WAXMAN: I -\nQUESTION: But if he doesn't have either of\nthose in mind, it could occur -- it could occur that he\nwould run an overcharge and be charged $15 or $20 or\nwhatever it is without realizing he's incurred the charge.\nMR. WAXMAN: It is true with the following\ncaveats. I'm not trying to fight the hypothetical. I\njust want to make sure -\nQUESTION: It seems to me you're unwilling to\ngive me a categorical yes answer when the answer is yes.\nMR. WAXMAN: And I can't, and here's why,\nJustice Stevens. I -- I mean no disrespect. But many,\nmany credit card issuers do not imply an over-limit fee on\na transactional basis. They apply it, for example, if at\nthe end of the month the balance exceeds the limit as\nopposed to whether a particular transaction sort of spikes\nit over the limit one time. And so I'm just trying to be\ncompletely accurate.\nNow, the term -- I think it's very important -\nQUESTION: Well, you've given me lots of\nexamples where the charge would not be incurred. I'm\nmerely trying to get you to acknowledge there will be some\ncases in which a person who is not fully familiar with the\n-- with the balance in his account doesn't realize he's\ngone over the amount and is being charged for an extra\ncredit charge.\nMR. WAXMAN: I think that must -- there must be\ninstances in which that is true.\nBut the term, credit limit, Your Honor, is a\nterm of art that is recognized in the industry, that is\nreflected in the Federal Reserve Board regulations, and it\ndraws an important distinction between increasing a credit\nlimit, an established credit limit, upon an application\nand authorizing a point-of-sale transaction.\nQUESTION: Well, now, Mr. Waxman, exactly what\nhappens when a point-of-sale transaction is authorized?\nThe merchant is then off the hook?\nMR. WAXMAN: The merchant has a safe harbor,\nYour Honor. The merchant is told, if you pay this charge\nand it turns out not to be collectible for any reason, we\nwill hold you harmless. And that's the reason that this\nbusiness -- contractual relationship is established\nbetween issuers and merchants, as a way to encourage\nmerchants to allow use of the card.\nNow -\nQUESTION: Mr. Waxman, is -- I'm sorry.\nMR. WAXMAN: No.\nQUESTION: Is the -- is the event of exceeding\nthe -- the limit defined in these agreements\ncharacteristically as an event that can occur at any time\nduring the billing period, or is it an event that is\ndefined as -- as occurring only at the end of the billing\nperiod when all the credits and -- and all the debits are\n-- are accounted for?\nMR. WAXMAN: My understanding, Justice Souter,\nis it varies depending on issuer and card, but that is,\nsome -- some cards will -- all -- all -- well, there are\nsome credit cards and charge cards that don't have limits,\nbut when they have a limit, the limit is required to be\nexplicated in the initial disclosures. And in the\nsolicitation, the disclosure, and all periodic statements,\nthe lender, the credit card issuer, is required to\nidentify the credit limit and specify that fees that are\ncharged for exceeding a credit limit will be the following\namount.\nQUESTION: Mr. Waxman, will you explain what the\nconsequence is? It's -- this is not a question of\ndisclosure or not because either it will be part of the\nfinance charge and disclosed as such or the -- whatever\nyou call OCL. What difference does it make? It's not\nnotice. If it goes -- if it's part of the finance charge,\nhow is the consumer benefitted?\nMR. WAXMAN: Well, I don't -- I will explain\nwhat difference it makes. No one has yet explained,\nneither the respondent in this case nor the Sixth Circuit,\nhow the consumer is benefitted by the rule that she's\nadvocating or the Sixth Circuit's rule, but here's how it\nworks.\nIn the open-end credit relationship, the credit\ncard or charge card relationship, there are three relevant\nevents.\nOne is the solicitation or advertisement to\ninvite someone to enter into a relationship. That's\ncalled the solicitation.\nThe -\nQUESTION: Are you talking about solicitation\nfor a purchase of a credit card or for purchase of\nmerchandise?\nMR. WAXMAN: For a purchase of a credit card.\nYou get a letter in the mail saying buy a -- open a\nCitibank card, and there are certain disclosures that are\nrequired in those solicitations.\nIf you send back something that says, yes, I\nwant to have a -- I want one of your credit cards, the act\nand the regulations require that certain disclosures be\nmade at that point, and that's called the initial\ndisclosure.\nAnd then the third event is the periodic\nstatement, when you get your statement every month or so.\nNow, with respect to the solicitation and the\ninitial disclosure, the consequences of calling this a\nfinance charge or a component of the finance charge versus\nan other charge are zero. That is, in both of those\ninstances, the lender, the issuer, must disclose that\nthere will be charges paid -- fees assessed for exceeding\na credit limit and how much it is. And they're not\ncharacterized there as part of the finance charge or\notherwise.\nThe -- on the -- those documents require a\nstatement of what the APR, the annualized percentage rate,\nis, but the APR in those statements refers only to the\nperiodic rate, the interest rate that's going to be\ncharged to all -- applied to all charges. In the -\nQUESTION: That's the only thing it could occur\nto.\nMR. WAXMAN: Yes.\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. WAXMAN: Because you don't know whether\nthere will be late charges or over-limit charges.\nQUESTION: Is -- is it a consequence of -- of\nthe other position that they would somehow have to try to\ndo the impossible?\nMR. WAXMAN: Not at those two stages, but at the\nthird stage, that is, the periodic statement, when you get\nyour bill every month, there is a difference there. In\nboth instances, there will be a specification of over\nlimit charge, but if the Sixth Circuit is right, in those\ninstances in which the issuer actually knew that the\ncharge it authorized the merchant to process resulted in\nthe consequence of an over-limit charge, it would be\ncalled over-limit charge finance charge. That is, there\nwould be a line item that specifies what it is, just like\nany other charge or any other purchase or payment, and the\namount. But it would affect the annual percentage rate,\nwhat's called the historical annual percentage rate, in\nthe periodic statement.\nQUESTION: Are there any other -- other\ninstances in the act where the APR, calculated\nretroactively on the monthly statement, is higher than\nwhat was the APR that was disclosed?\nMR. WAXMAN: Yes, there -- yes, there are,\nJustice Stevens, because there are certain types of\ncharges that may or may not occur. For example, if you\nuse your card to get cash at the cash machine or something\nthat will be -- will -- that are charged in the finance -\nthat are part of the finance charge and will, therefore,\naffect the APR on the monthly statement, but won't be\ndisclosed to the -\nQUESTION: So -- so then the respondent's theory\ncould -- and that's consistent with the act, I take it.\nSo then respondent's theory could work.\nMy concern was that respondent's theory couldn't\nwork because you had -- couldn't hypothetically calculate\nan annual percentage rate not knowing whether charge would\nbe made.\nMR. WAXMAN: Well -\nQUESTION: But if you can and -- and do have an\nadjustment of the APR that's permitted under the act, on\nthe disclosure statement, then her theory at least can\nwork.\nMR. WAXMAN: Well, her -- I'm not saying that\nher theory or the Sixth Circuit's rule couldn't work. It\nwould require a great deal of additional rulemaking by the\nFederal Reserve Board because the APR is a -- is a\nfraction, is a percentage, the numerator of which is the\ncomponent of all the individual charges and the\ndenominator is something that, in the context of an over\nlimit fee, is unclear. Does it apply to the transaction\nthat it was applied to? Is it the average monthly\nbalance? Is it for the whole month or part of the month?\nIt's not impossible.\nBut what it -- what it is is directly contrary\nto the two objectives of TILA. The purpose of TILA is to\ncome up with bright line classifications that are readily\ncomplied with by issuers and that help consumers compare\ncompeting costs of credit. That is manifest in Congress'\npurpose, and a rule that requires the treatment month to\nmonth, charge to charge depend on what the issuer knew at\nthe time it authorized some charge that may later be\ndetermined to have triggered at -- the -- allowing the\nborrower to exceed the credit limit would cause these\nmonthly APR's to vary widely and, it seems to me, can only\ncreate confusion and inability to say, well, gee, I just\ngot an application or a -- a thing in the mail from, you\nknow, Citibank saying 17.3 percent, but I just looked at\nmy statement and it's 79 percent.\nQUESTION: Mr. Waxman, I don't think you\nfinished the answer to the question I asked, and what I\nwanted to know is if it's labeled a finance charge, then\nthere won't be interest on it; whereas, if it's treated as\na debit like any purchase, then the interest would run on\nit in the future. So could -- it could be a difference\nfor the consumer, could it not?\nMR. WAXMAN: Well, yes, in the month in which it\nhas occurred because, with respect to the next month,\nwhatever finance charge was applied and -- and continues\nas a balance will also have applied to it the finance\ncharge, that is, the interest rate that would apply. So,\nbut with -- there is a consequence in the month in which\nit is applied; that is, for whatever days it's\noutstanding, up until the -- the end of the -- the card's\ngrace period, a finance charge could be applied to that\nother charge.\nQUESTION: So it could be -- it could be -\nQUESTION: Why isn't it carried over from month\nto month? In other words, I -- I get a late -- this --\nthis special charge, but I just pay the minimum, so I'm\nreally carrying part of the special charge over to the\nnext month. I pay interest on that too, I take it.\nMR. WAXMAN: These cards typically have a grace\nperiod in which you can pay off your balance and you don't\nhave to pay any finance charge, but if you don't, whatever\ncharges are carried forward, whether they derive from\npurchases of over-limit charges or late fee charges or --\nor finance charges in the previous month, something is\ncharged against it.\nMay I reserve the balance of my time?\nQUESTION: Very well, Mr. Waxman.\nMs. McDowell, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF BARBARA B. McDOWELL\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,\nAS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS\nMS. McDOWELL: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nCongress has given the Federal Reserve Board\nbroad authority to implement the Truth in Lending Act.\nThe regulation at issue here is the permissible exercise\nof that authority.\nThe board has addressed the disclosure of fees\nfor exceeding a credit limit with a clear bright line rule\nwhich requires all such fees to be disclosed clearly and\nconspicuously but separately from the finance charge and\nAPR.\nTo use the Court's own terminology, that\napproach is neither obviously repugnant to the statute nor\ndemonstrably irrational. To the contrary, the rule is a\nsensible one that, in the view of the expert agency,\nprovides meaningful disclosure to consumers and clear\nguidance to creditors. There's no merit to the court of\nappeals' and respondent's contrary approach which would\nonly impose exorbitant compliance costs on creditors\nwithout any meaningful benefit in terms of disclosure to\nconsumers.\nThe board's rule is not foreclosed by the\nstatutory text. The act does not speak expressly to\nwhether over-the-limit fees are or are not finance\ncharges. Nor is that question resolved by the act's\ngenerally phrased definition of finance charges as charges\nimposed as an incident to the extension of credit. That\nphrase is ambiguous as to whether it encompasses charges\nthat are imposed not as the cost of the credit that the\ncreditor has contractually obligated itself to provide,\nbut instead as a penalty for the consumer's obtaining some\nadditional credit that she had no contractual right to\nobtain.\nThe board's rule is rational. As the board\nrecognized over-the-limit fees -\nQUESTION: Ms. McDowell?\nMS. McDOWELL: Yes.\nQUESTION: Would you -- as I understand the\nrespondent's brief, it asks us to draw a line between the\nover-the-limit fees that are imposed for acts of default\nand those that are imposed for extension of the credit\nlimit and says that Regulation Z draws such a distinction.\nWould you comment on that argument?\nMS. McDOWELL: That argument is incorrect, Your\nHonor. The relevant provision of Regulation Z, which is\nat page 2 of the petitioners' brief, contains no limit of\nthat sort. It speaks of charges for actual unanticipated\nlate payment for exceeding a credit limit and for\ndelinquency, default, or similar occurrences. It thus\nspeaks in a categorical manner of charges for exceeding a\ncredit limit. It doesn't condition them on whether it was\nunanticipated or whether it's tantamount to a default.\nThe board has acknowledged that there are\nhypothetical situations at least in which a -- a charge\nmight be labeled an over-the-limit charge when it actually\nis not, when there actually, for example, is no\ncontractual credit limit and -- and a charge is simply, in\nthat context, labeled inaccurately an over-the-credit-\nlimit fee. However, when a charge is, in fact, imposed by\nthe creditor as a consequence of the consumer's exceeding\nthe contractual credit limit, it is validly within this\nregulation.\nQUESTION: Was this an account that carried a\nfinance charge? Because the regulations describe\nsomething called charge card that doesn't have finance\ncharge, but could have an over-the-limit charge.\nMS. McDOWELL: That's -- the particular account\nat issue in this case was a credit card.\nQUESTION: Which did have a finance charge, or\nyou don't know?\nMS. McDOWELL: Yes, it does impose a periodic\ncharge if all charges that are run up during a particular\nmonth are not paid within the grace period.\nQUESTION: If I understand the other side, they\nmake kind of a plain language argument. They -- they talk\nto the merchant. The merchant sends in -- they want\napprove a $200-purchase and they get back, well, it'll go\nover the limit and is it okay. And they say, yes, let\nthem go over the limit, and so they've extended additional\ncredit. And -- and they, if they're going to charge them\n$15 to do it, that would be a finance charge -- I mean,\nthat would be a charge for an extension of credit. Why\ndoesn't it fit the plain language?\nMS. McDOWELL: We don't disagree with you,\nJustice Stevens, that it is, at some general level, a\ncharge imposed incident to the extension of credit. There\nwas necessarily an extension of credit here.\nQUESTION: In -- in exchange for the higher\ncredit limit, yes.\nMS. McDOWELL: The -- but -- but the term,\nincident to the extension of credit, is an ambiguous one.\nThe Court construed similar language in the Holly Farms\ncase and recognized it to be ambiguous. It doesn't\naddress precisely the nature or -- or the extent to which\na particular charge has to be connected to an extension of\ncredit. And here, the board has reasonably viewed over\nthe-limit fees like late payment fees and other default\nfees as being imposed for a violation of the terms of the\ncredit agreement rather than as -\nQUESTION: And then the -- but wouldn't the\ncustomer say, well, I didn't violate anything? You told\nme I could do it. Why is it a violation?\nMS. McDOWELL: In the first place, there was no\ncommunication in this case, and there typically is no\ncommunication when we're speaking only of the\nauthorization process.\nQUESTION: But what if there were -- what if\nthere had been a communication? Would it be different?\nWould it be a different case if the merchant put the bank\nofficer on the phone and said, you're over your limit, and\nthe -- and the customer said, is it okay for me to pay the\nextra 15 bucks for this -- go over the limit $15? He\nsays, yes, we'll -- we'll okay it. And then they hang up.\nAt the end of the month, he gets a $15 charge for that.\nWould that be -- that would not be an extension of credit\nin your view if they talked on the phone and agreed to it\ninstead of having to just go through these anonymous\ncommunications.\nMS. McDOWELL: It would look more like an\nextension of credit, I -- I might grant you, but the board\nis still entitled to draft categorical rules by virtue of\nits authority under section 1604(a) to make classification\nadjustments and exceptions.\nQUESTION: There's no duty on the -- on the part\nof the bank to say, of course, if we okay it, you have to\npay an extra 15 bucks.\nMS. McDOWELL: Well, Your Honor, you're raising\na policy question that Congress or the board could address\nwhether additional disclosures are required at the point\nof purchase. Here we're talking about disclosures that\noccurred later, days or weeks later, when the customer\nreceives her periodic statement.\nQUESTION: Just a bill that said, you didn't\nrealize it, but you just earned a -- you just -- you owe\nus $15 that you should have realized.\nMS. McDOWELL: Well, and whether it's imposed as\na finance charge or -- or as an other charge, the consumer\nis still going to have the -- the kind of surprise that\nyou referred to. And in the board's view, it doesn't make\nany meaningful difference whether, at that point when the\ncustomer receives her periodic statement, it is identified\nas one or the other. Indeed, it could confuse the\nconsumer to have the over-the-limit fee included in the\nhistoric or actual APR on her periodic statement. If she\nwere, for example, comparing that statement with a\nsolicitation that she received by direct mail, she might\nbe inclined to think that -- that the solicitation offered\nbetter terms when it really did not.\nQUESTION: Would you agree that -- that it would\nbe to the consumer's advantage to have this categorized as\na finance charge because then she wouldn't have to pay\ninterest on that in -- in future charges?\nMS. McDOWELL: No, Your Honor. She would still\nhave to pay interest on it. Whether it's labeled a\nfinance charge or not makes no difference in that regard.\nIt only has to do with how it's labeled and whether it's\nincluded in the actual APR on the -- the customer's\nperiodic statement. Even if it's labeled a finance\ncharge, in other words, she can be charged additional\ninterest. The periodic rate can be applied to it.\nSo, in fact, the board has concluded that --\nthat there's no benefit to consumers to treating over\nthe-limit fees generally as finance charges, and the Sixth\nCircuit's rule, in particular, would make no sense because\nit would depend on the creditor's subjective knowledge\nwhether a particular charge was or was not included in the\nAPR in the particular month. That would impose\nsignificant compliance costs on creditors and would not\ntell consumers anything that's particularly meaningful to\nthem.\nWhen the board revised Regulation Z in the 1980\n81 period, after the TILA Simplification Act, the board\nsought to focus on legally enforceable relationships, not\non unenforceable understandings that a consumer might have\nas a result of a course of dealings with the credit card\ncompany.\nAnd understanding this particular provision,\nconsistent with its plain terms, as applying to all\ncharges imposed or exceeding a credit limit is consistent\nwith that approach. It provides the meaningful disclosure\nand it avoids imposing unwarranted compliance costs.\nIf there are no further questions -\nQUESTION: Thank you, Ms. McDowell.\nMs. Goldsmith, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF SYLVIA A. GOLDSMITH\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMS. GOLDSMITH: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThis case has come full circle. It started 4\nand-a-half years ago with the filing of a complaint, a\ncomplaint that says if you authorize the request of a\nconsumer to have more credit and you tie a fee for that\nauthorization, that fee is a finance charge.\nThe question presented here is whether or not\nthe Sixth Circuit has the right or should have invalidated\na provision of Regulation Z with respect to the exclusion\nof certain over-limit fees, and we believe that resolution\nof that question brings us back to the complaint. What\ndoes the complaint say in that regard?\nQUESTION: Are -- are you fully defending the\ndecision of the Sixth Circuit, Ms. Goldsmith?\nMS. GOLDSMITH: We -- yes. We believe that the\nSixth Circuit's decision is that this fee, the fee in this\ncase, is a finance charge, and we stand behind that\ndecision 100 percent. We have stated in our complaint\nthat this fee -- and -- and it's important to remember\nthat -\nQUESTION: Ms. Goldsmith, before you continue,\nthe Sixth Circuit said a portion of Regulation Z is\ninvalid because it's incompatible with the statute. Are\nyou defending that invalidation?\nMS. GOLDSMITH: In theory, yes. We -- we feel\nthat -\nQUESTION: How about in practice?\n(Laughter.)\nMS. GOLDSMITH: We feel that perhaps the court\ndid not need to go there, that -- in -- in looking at the\nsituation now, we -- we have always -\nQUESTION: But you asked -- you asked the court\nto do that.\nMS. GOLDSMITH: Yes, we did.\nQUESTION: When you argued the case before the\nSixth Circuit, you made it very clear that you were\nseeking a holding that a portion of Regulation Z was\nincompatible with the statute.\nMS. GOLDSMITH: I think to the extent that\nRegulation Z says that anything you call an over-limit fee\nas excluded from the finance charge, that is incompatible\nwith the regulation. And we stand by our lower court\nargument that if that is the case, then that regulation\ncannot stand.\nAnd -- and once the Government stepped in, we\nrealized -- a significant part of their argument is that\nthe -- that the Federal Reserve Board could say that. The\nFederal Reserve Board could say that all over-limit fees\nare excluded from the finance charge and we took that as a\n-- as a tacit concession that the -- the Federal Reserve\nBoard didn't actually do that. What they said, within the\ncontext of section 226.4(c)(2), is that fees, penalty\nfees, fees for unilateral acts of default, need not be\ndisclosed as part of the finance charge. And so while we\nsupport the Sixth Circuit's decision, this is a finance\ncharge -- no matter how you get there, you have to get to\nthat point -- alternately, as an alternate basis to\nsupport the decision, we realize that the regulation is\nnot necessarily triggered in this instance.\nQUESTION: But that's an argument you didn't\nmake before the Sixth Circuit. The Sixth Circuit -- you\ntold them that this regulation was incompatible with the\nstatute.\nMS. GOLDSMITH: That is correct. And I -- I\nhave to fall on the sword in that regard, that honestly,\nuntil the Government stepped in and helped clarify that\nissue for us, we did -- we were fighting a battle we\ndidn't need to fight. And ultimately -\nQUESTION: But they clarified it in the Sixth\nCircuit. So why didn't you say, oh, Sixth Circuit, we've\nnow seen the light and we -- we don't want the regulation\ndeclared invalid?\nMS. GOLDSMITH: I don't believe that the\nGovernment clarified that for us in the Sixth Circuit.\nWhat -- what clarified it for me was the Government's\nbrief, the merit briefing in this case, where they said, I\nbelieve 28 pages into a 30-page brief, if the Federal\nReserve Board wants to exclude all over-limit fees, they\ncould, and that's sort of when the light bulb went off.\nThey didn't. And that -- that's sort of what took us\nwhere we are.\nAnd ultimately, I think there's precedent for\nthis Court to review the ultimate basis to support this\ndecision based on making sure that the -\nQUESTION: Well, you used the word review. We\nwouldn't be reviewing it. We would be taking a first view\nof it.\nMS. GOLDSMITH: I'm sorry.\nQUESTION: But you didn't -- you -- we would not\nbe reviewing anything that the court below determined. We\nwould be accepting a new argument that has not been aired\nbelow, and that's not review.\nMS. GOLDSMITH: I think that in Connecticut v.\nDoehr, for instance, this Court acknowledged that there\nare circumstances that this Court wants to make sure that\nthe right rule of law is handed down. And if the\nquestions are intertwined, the -- the issues that were\nraised below and an alternate argument in support of the\ndecision is raised before this Court, if it's a matter of\nimportance, if it's a matter that the lower courts need\ndirection on, if it's a matter that has been -\nQUESTION: Usually if we're asked to affirm on\nan alternate ground, it's a ground that the court of\nappeals passed on as kind of an alternate ground. Here,\nthe court of appeals didn't pass on this at all.\nMS. GOLDSMITH: I agree. And like I said, I -\nI believe in the Connecticut v. Doehr case, this Court\nacknowledged that alternately we cannot put form over\nsubstance, and we need to make sure that the right rule of\nlaw is passed down.\nAnd I believe Justice Scalia, as a concurring\ncomment in U.S. v. Burke, said there's got to be play in\nthe joints, that even if it is not something that came to\nthe Court procedurally, if it is something that -- that\nmeets the three factors I was enumerating from Connecticut\nv. Doehr, the Court will entertain an argument.\nQUESTION: It isn't just a procedural point, Ms.\nGoldsmith. We do better if we have an opinion of the\ncourt of appeals on the subject than if we're just\nlaunching it into -- for the first time ourselves.\nMS. GOLDSMITH: And I would agree, and -- and\nthe only defense that I have to that is that this is a\nmatter that has been fully briefed and argued by counsel\nbefore this Court. And when -- when the case got taken in\nby this Court, everyone said to me, you have to remember\nwhy they took it in, and -- and my understanding is is\nbecause the regulation has been challenged. And -\nQUESTION: What other argument is there? I\ndon't understand. I thought -- and I'm just mixed up\nabout this. I thought that there is a Z regulation. It's\ncalled Regulation Z. And I thought Regulation Z says the\nfollowing is not part of the finance charge, a charge for\nexceeding a credit limit. Now, are we talking about\nsomething in this case that is not a charge for exceeding\na credit limit?\nMS. GOLDSMITH: I believe so.\nQUESTION: What?\nMS. GOLDSMITH: I think that a fee denominated\nan over-limit fee that is actually an anticipated cost for\napproving an extension of credit is in fact a finance\ncharge.\nQUESTION: Does it say on the paper this is a\ncharge for exceeding a credit limit?\nMS. GOLDSMITH: I believe they called it an\nover-limit fee assessment.\nQUESTION: All right. And so it's called an\nover-limit fee assessment and you pay it if you exceed the\ncredit limit. You don't pay it if you exceed the credit\nlimit, or do you?\nMS. GOLDSMITH: I think that's a factual\nquestion. I -- I think -\nQUESTION: Oh, okay. Well, what is the answer\nto the factual question? Do you pay for exceeding the\ncredit limit or do you not pay it for exceeding the credit\nlimit?\nMS. GOLDSMITH: I believe the facts of this case\n-- this is not a fee that was imposed for the unilateral\nact of exceeding a credit limit.\nQUESTION: Okay. So -\nQUESTION: It depends, doesn't it, on -\nQUESTION: -- there's a new argument, the first\ntime in this Court, that this is not a fee for exceeding a\ncredit limit. Was it made below in any form?\nMS. GOLDSMITH: I believe the allegations of our\ncomplaint have always been clear.\nQUESTION: Oh, yes, but, I mean -- that may be.\nI'm just asking, have you ever told any court before today\nthat this is not the -- I'm not -- it sounds sarcastic,\nbut I don't mean it to be sarcastic. I want to know.\nHave you ever before argued in this case, told a judge and\n-- that this is not a fee, quote, for exceeding a credit\nlimit? End quote.\nMS. GOLDSMITH: No.\nQUESTION: No.\nQUESTION: Ms. Goldsmith, we wouldn't resolve a\nwhole lot in this case, however, if we didn't reach that\nquestion, would we?\nMS. GOLDSMITH: I don't believe we would.\nQUESTION: We -- we'd just have another case a\nlittle bit down the line, perhaps with the same parties\nbefore the Court, arguing this -- this follow-on question.\nRight?\nMS. GOLDSMITH: I believe absolutely. I think\nthat what we realized is that the arguments that we were\nmaking in the court below, which -- which we stand by,\nwere premature.\nQUESTION: If we don't resolve it, we've\nessentially wasted our time.\nWhat -- what -- doesn't it depend upon what the\nregulation means by credit limit? It could mean that\nlimit set forth in the -- in the agreement with the credit\ncard company, past which there is no obligation on the\npart of the company to extend you any further credit. It\ncould -- it could reasonably mean that. Indeed, that --\nthat's what I would normally think it does mean. Or it\ncould mean what you want it to mean, whatever limit the\ncompany later places upon your desire to -- to go ahead.\nNow, why should we accept your interpretation of\nit rather than the interpretation of the agency? We\nusually do accept the agency's interpretation of its own\nregulation.\nMS. GOLDSMITH: I don't believe that our\ninterpretation conflicts with that of the Federal Reserve\nBoard. If -- if we look at the plain language of the\nregulation -\nQUESTION: We wouldn't be arguing here. I\nmean -\nMS. GOLDSMITH: I believe what the -- what the\nFederal Reserve Board has said is that when you have a fee\nfor a unilateral act of default, that that fee is properly\nexcluded from the finance charge. I believe in the -\nQUESTION: Well, don't we have to accept the\nGovernment's position? It's representing the agency, is\nit not?\nMS. GOLDSMITH: Absolutely.\nQUESTION: So it is the agency position.\nMS. GOLDSMITH: I don't believe that you will\nfind in the Government's brief an argument that the fee\nalleged in this case necessarily fits within the terms of\nsection 226.4(c)(2). In fact, I believe several times,\npages 17, 18 of the Government's brief, they talk about\nhow over-limit fees were included as a penalty fee in that\nportion of the regulation.\nThat gets us back to the complaint. Was the fee\ncharged here a penalty fee or was it a fee for an\nanticipated, approved extension of credit?\nQUESTION: I didn't think that was the\nGovernment's argument in my -- as I read it. I thought\nthere are some words here. For exceeding a -- it says,\nfor exceeding a credit limit. And as I understood the\nargument -- I might not have perfectly well -- is -- I\nthought that their argument is basically when you exceed a\ncredit limit, the company doesn't want you to do it.\nOkay? So it says, no. And if you do it, we're not going\nto cancel you out, but we will charge you a penalty. Now,\nsometimes it's what you say. Sometimes the company would\nlove you to do it and get the extra money. In fact, they\nmight make profits on that. So they'd love you to do it.\nBut trying to distinguish between those two instances is\ntoo difficult, and because it's too difficult, we are\ngoing to have a blanket rule, and the blanket rule is if\nyou fall within these words, exceeding a credit limit,\nthis is not a finance charge.\nNow, that's what I understood it to be, a\ntypical administrative agency argument. And they say\nChevron, Mead, et cetera, we win. All right.\nNow, suppose let me -- for the purpose of\nanswering, please assume that you do have a charge here\nthat falls within the term, exceeding a credit limit.\nWhat is your response to the argument that I just made?\nMS. GOLDSMITH: I think if we assume that this\nfee is a fee for exceeding a credit limit, then we need to\nlook at the nature of the fee and determine whether or not\nthat is obviously repugnant to the statute. And I think\npart of -- of what we have been accused of doing is\ncreating an impossible factual distinction. Some would be\ndisclosed as a finance charge, some would not.\nAnd I direct the Court to the regulation itself\nthat draws that factual distinction as to late fees. The\n-- the Federal Reserve Board went out of its way, in both\nthe language of the regulation and the commentary, to say\nif this is a unilateral act of default, you have paid late\nor not in the amount that you were supposed to pay and we\nabsolutely did not authorize that, that must -- that would\nbe excluded from the finance charge. But if the creditor\nacquiesced in that in any way, that is a finance charge.\nAnd what our position is is that a late fee -\nQUESTION: I mean, you say the agency said this?\nWhere -- where did the agency say that?\nMS. GOLDSMITH: In both the regulation itself\nand the commentary. In the commentary -\nQUESTION: What -- what portion of the\nregulation says that?\nMS. GOLDSMITH: Section 226.4(c)(2) in the\nportion that says actual unanticipated late payments. And\nin the commentary, the -- the board has defined actual,\nand it's the qualification of actual unanticipated goes to\nthe question is this a unilateral act of default or is\nthis something that the creditor acquiesced in. So our -\nour point is is that if you look at -\nQUESTION: I suppose that depends on what --\nwhat time period unanticipated refers to.\nMS. GOLDSMITH: I believe that the commentary\nhelps explain that for us.\nQUESTION: Okay. What does the commentary say?\nMS. GOLDSMITH: The commentary says if this is\ntruly a late fee because you have paid and the creditor\ncould do nothing about it, then that is going to be an\nactual unanticipated late fee. But if this is something\nthat month after month after month you paid late every\nmonth and they could be deemed to have acquiesced in that\nlate payment, that must be disclosed as part of the\nfinance charge.\nQUESTION: Where -- where is that in -- in your\nbrief?\nMS. GOLDSMITH: The portion of the commentary -\nto be perfectly honest, I don't know if the -- if the\ncommentary is reprinted in the appendix. The regulation\nlanguage is -\nQUESTION: Gee, if it's that central, I would\nhave thought it ought to have been there. It's new to me.\nWhere -- where is it?\nMS. GOLDSMITH: I don't know, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: You don't know what you just said?\nMS. GOLDSMITH: I don't know where in the\nappendix it is is what I don't know. I know that section\n226.4(c)(2) -- the commentary specifically outlines the\nfact that there is a distinction between acts of default\nand -- and acquiesced -- oh, thank you very much.\nWhat counsel was handing me is the actual CFR.\nI mean, the commentary is at 12CFR Section 226.4(c)(2).\nWhat I don't believe is that is reprinted in full anywhere\nin the appendix or in the briefing. I thought that's what\nyour question was.\nQUESTION: Yes, sort of. I -- I'd like to know\nwhat it is that you're -- you're saying makes your case.\nI -- I don't have the text in front of me and you say it's\nnowhere to be found in all of these voluminous materials\nthat we have for this case.\nMS. GOLDSMITH: I was trying to give an analogy\nas to late fees which is somewhat tangential to the issue.\nWhat the point is is that a late fee -- you have to start\nwith what the concept of an extension of credit is. And\n-- and we do outline this in our brief, that we're talking\nabout each and every time a consumer seeks to make a\npurchase, they're essentially saying may I have an\nextension of credit to cover this purchase.\nQUESTION: May I ask you a question about that?\nIf -- if you are correct in your analysis, why isn't the\nanswer to the problem that you raise here is simply that\nthey are not entitled to charge you any fee at all, no\nmatter what you call it? Because if I understand your -\nand I may not, but if I understand your argument, your\nargument is they agreed to my charging beyond the limit in\nthe agreement as we originally negotiated it. They said\nit's okay. And if that is the case, why isn't your\nargument and your remedy simply they can't charge me any\npenalty at all for that? They agreed to it. And we never\neven get into the question that we've got in this case.\nMS. GOLDSMITH: I think the answer to the\nquestion is is that this is really no different than a\nrequest to -- to -- a request to make a purchase below the\ncredit limit versus a request to make a purchase above it.\nEither way, they could charge you a fee. I mean, that's\n-- that's what -\nQUESTION: No.\nMS. GOLDSMITH: -- credit is.\nQUESTION: But if your point -- and I think I'm\nnot getting your point, but if your point is that they\napproved this in the sense that they said, yes, we will\nhonor this -- they're telling you in -- in effect -- we\nwill honor this charge and that that, in effect, is a\nrenegotiation of your credit limit with the bank, then it\nwould follow that they can't charge you any penalty at\nall. The only thing they can make you do is pay what you\nhave charged. And if that's the case, we don't need to\nget into this -- this complicated question about\nRegulation Z. All you have to say is, I don't owe you a\ncent for exceeding the credit limit. Why isn't that the\nanswer to your question or to your problem?\nMS. GOLDSMITH: I think two things. First of\nall, we have never claimed that this is a renegotiation of\nthe credit limit. We have always taken the position that\nthere is a distinction between renegotiating your credit\nlimit and getting an extension of credit that happens to\ntake you over your credit limit. So that -- that's the\nfirst issue.\nThe second issue is -\nQUESTION: So you're saying, yes, it violates\nthe contract, but it's okay to violate the contract\nbecause they -- they approved in advance this charge.\nMS. GOLDSMITH: We do not feel that it's a\nviolation of the contract if they allow you to do it.\nQUESTION: Then if it's not a violation of the\ncontract because they allowed you to do it, why do you\nconcede that they can charge you any fee at all for doing\nthat?\nMS. GOLDSMITH: I'm not conceding that they can\ncharge you a penalty on top a finance charge, but what I'm\nsaying is that anytime a creditor extends credit, they may\ncharge a fee and -\nQUESTION: Okay.\nMS. GOLDSMITH: -- as a credit.\nQUESTION: They may, but in the original\ncontract with you in the -- the -- at the -- at the\nbeginning of your relationship with the bank, they didn't\nspell out the particular situation that you're describing\nhere. They said, in -- if I understand it, if you go over\nthe limit, we charge you X dollars, and -- and that was\nthe extent of it. You're fighting about whether the X\ndollars should be classified as a finance charge or\nsomething else, but your argument now is a different kind\nof argument.\nYour argument now is they, in some sense,\napproved my going over the limit. If that does not change\nthe original agreement, then what difference does it make?\nIf it does change the original agreement, then why isn't\nyour remedy simply to say you can't charge me a fee at all\nfor going over the limit?\nMS. GOLDSMITH: I believe what we have always\nsaid is that this extension of credit was like any other\nextension of credit on the card. Whether Ms. Pfennig goes\nin 2 weeks before her -- her credit limit was exceeded and\nsays, may I have enough credit to make this purchase, and\nthey say, yes, and contractually we know -\nQUESTION: Yes, but your -- your argument is\nthat the extension of credit in this case is an agreement\nto exceed the credit limit. Isn't that your argument?\nMS. GOLDSMITH: I don't think so.\nQUESTION: I thought your argument, Ms.\nGoldsmith, was that the contract provides that any\nextension of credit over the credit limit shall be subject\nto the regular percentage plus the $15 penalty. Right? I\nmean, you acknowledge that there is an agreement at the\noutset as to what the finance charge will be for this\nadded extension of credit. It'll be the regular rate plus\nthe penalty.\nMS. GOLDSMITH: I don't -\nQUESTION: If that's not your argument, then -\nthen I think Justice Souter has to be correct.\nMS. GOLDSMITH: I think at this stage of -- of\nthe litigation, since we have not conducted any discovery,\nwe have not seen the actual cardholder agreement to know\nwhat it says with regard to over-limit fees. So I don't\nthink I can answer the question in that regard.\nQUESTION: Didn't -- didn't Ms. Pfennig get a\ncopy? I mean, the -- isn't it on her monthly bill?\nMS. GOLDSMITH: On her bill it will tell her\nwhat her contract rate is, but the initial disclosures -\nI believe she had this card 7-8 years before this happened\nand it is not in the record.\nQUESTION: I thought -- I thought the terms have\nto be disclosed monthly in addition to when the credit\ncard is new.\nMS. GOLDSMITH: What has to be -- and -- and I\nbelieve that -- that Mr. Waxman explained this, that you\nhave your initial disclosures that come with the card when\nyou originally get it. What has to be disclosed on a\nperiodic basis is an itemization of each extension of\ncredit that you've received, a total that you've received,\nplus your -- your APR. Those types of terms of what the\ncost of credit is on a monthly basis are going to be on\nyour periodic statement.\nI believe what -- what Justice Scalia's question\nwas is what does the credit card agreement say as to is\nshe going to be charged a flat fee, is she going to be\ncharged a flat fee plus the finance charge, and that is\nnot in the record. We don't have that.\nQUESTION: And if that's not in the record, how\ncan you make the argument you're making? Because the\nargument you're making depends on whether, in effect, the\n-- the agreement is Justice Scalia's suggestion or my\nsuggestion. And if that's not in the record and you don't\nknow, how do we get into this at all?\nMS. GOLDSMITH: I think the confusion is coming\nin because ultimately what is or is not labeled in an\nover-limit fee may not be a fee for exceeding a credit\nlimit as that term has been used in the regulations.\nQUESTION: And the only way we can tell that is\nto look at the contract, isn't it?\nMS. GOLDSMITH: I don't believe so.\nQUESTION: No?\nMS. GOLDSMITH: I believe that if you look at\nsection 1637(b)(2) that describes how each and every\nextension of credit needs to be itemized, we're talking\nabout a singular event, an extension of credit. She says\nmay I make this purchase. May I have an extension of\ncredit to cover this purchase, and they say yes. And in\neveryday experience, we all know that means you're going\nto be charged something for that extension of credit.\nIt's going to be charged a finance charge.\nQUESTION: Are you talking about just an\nordinary credit card transaction where you go in and say,\nlook, I'm buying a pair of gloves and I want to put them\non my credit card? This you're describing as a request\nfor an extension of credit?\nMS. GOLDSMITH: Absolutely.\nQUESTION: Okay. So we're starting back that\nsimply. Then how did we get so complicated?\nMS. GOLDSMITH: I'm not quite sure.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: Well, one reason it's complicated, if\nI understand your position, you're objecting both to the\nfee and to the later statements imposing an interest\ncharge on the fee, aren't you?\nMS. GOLDSMITH: I think it's triple dipping,\nyes. I think that, as Justice Ginsburg pointed out, they\n-- they charge you for the extension of credit. You get a\nfinance charge on your actual extension of credit. They\nimpose a penalty fee, and then they charge a finance\ncharge on the penalty fee -\nQUESTION: If that's in the contract, so what?\nA deal is a deal. If you agree, I pay 10 percent up to\nthis amount, if I go over that amount, I pay 10 percent\nplus $15, if that's in the contract, isn't that perfectly\nfair?\nMS. GOLDSMITH: I think -\nQUESTION: And you don't know whether it's in\nthe contract. So you can't say it's unfair.\nMS. GOLDSMITH: But this is not a breach of\ncontract case. This is a Truth in Lending Act case, and\nthe only thing the Truth in Lending Act -\nQUESTION: Whether it is or not, you shouldn't\ncall it unfair if you don't know.\nMS. GOLDSMITH: I don't recall using the word\nunfair. I'm sorry.\nI -- I believe that Truth in Lending is about\ndisclosure as to whether or not they have to -\nQUESTION: Could I interrupt with this one\nquestion? I want to be sure I get it out before the\nargument is over. Would you explain to me what difference\nit makes, in terms of notice to the consumer, whether one\ncalls it a -- an other charge or a finance charge? In\neither event, doesn't the consumer get exactly the same\nnotice?\nMS. GOLDSMITH: I don't believe so because when\nit is charged as a flat fee as an other charge, besides\nthe fact that there's interest charged on top of it, the\nconsumer is in a position that they then need to compare\ncost of credit, one, as a dollar figure, the other as an\nAPR. And while I believe Ms. McDowell said that the\nprimary purpose of TILA is to create bright line rules for\nthe credit card industry, I think there is significant\nsupport, as this Court has stated, that one of the primary\nobjectives is making sure the consumer can understand the\ncost of credit. And -- and Congress has said we -\nQUESTION: But why would the consumer understand\nthe cost of credit any better by labeling it a finance\ncharge rather than an other charge? That I haven't -- you\nhaven't explained to me.\nMS. GOLDSMITH: Because Congress said we want\nthat to be an apples-to-apples comparison. So Ms. Pfennig\ncan know that the extensions of credit she received up\ntill now were charged at 18.49 percent. She knows that\nthe extension of credit she received over her credit limit\nwas $29 -\nQUESTION: So how does that work? I -- I exceed\nmy credit by $15. My colleague exceeds his credit by $42.\nEach of us is charged a $15 late fee. What's the interest\nrate? And, of course, there are an infinite number of\npossibilities. So I guess I'd get a -- a statement that\nwould be every conceivable possibility of how much I go\nover with interest rates ranging from like .2 percent to\n48,000 percent. So, I mean, how -- how is this supposed\nto work?\nMS. GOLDSMITH: The simple answer is I don't\nknow. Ultimately I think the Federal Reserve Board does\nhave to offer the direction of how this will be disclosed,\nbut I think the important thing -- and I believe -\nQUESTION: I think that's why Justice Stevens\nmight have thought it's going to confuse the consumer if\nyou win, not help the consumer.\nQUESTION: I would think it's much more\ninformative to the consumer to know that my interest rate\nfor all of the things up to the -- my credit limit has\nbeen this past month so much, and -- and then see a\nseparate charge, God, I got socked 15 bucks for going over\nmy credit limit. You think you're helping the consumer by\n-- by taking that $15 separate charge and just mushing it\ninto the general overall credit limit so that instead of\nthinking he's being charged 10 percent, he thinks he's\nbeing charged 11 -- 11 percent, and he doesn't know\nanything about the late -- about the -- the going over his\nover limit fee? I don't think that helps him at all.\nMS. GOLDSMITH: But I don't believe that that's\nnecessarily how it would be done. I believe that, Justice\nBreyer, you had said earlier about how certain -- there\nare instances where certain fees are disclosed\ndifferently. You can have a situation where a cash\nadvance is calculated at a different APR than the contract\nrate of the finance charge. An ATM fee might be charged\nat a different -- a different APR than something else.\nAnd those are itemized at the bottom. You wouldn't\nnecessarily not let them know that this was a charge\nincident to something over the credit limit, but you would\nput it in apples-to-apples comparison, which I believe -\nQUESTION: But, of course, the difficulty for\nyou is all you have to say is that the view I was taking\nsomewhat by argument is a reasonable one, and if it's a\nreasonable one, I guess it's a reasonable interpretation\nof the statute. And therefore, Regulation Z doesn't\nviolate it.\nNow -- now, you haven't been able to show us how\nwe'd get on the opposite interpretation. We didn't even\nknow what the statement would look like. So it's very\nhard for me to say it's not reasonable what the -- what\nthe -- that Regulation Z, isn't it?\nMS. GOLDSMITH: I think that ultimately depends\non -- on the construction of the regulation. We -- we\nseem to want to parse out for exceeding a credit limit\nwithout looking at the context of the regulation that\nthese are acts of default. And what we have alleged in\nthe complaint, which ultimately is controlling here, is\nnot an act of default. So in that instance, the\nregulation is not triggered and it's premature for us to\ndecide whether or not it was rationally based.\nQUESTION: The one thing that the -- the board\nhas said is we don't want these individual to make every\nextension of credit or what -- to do this kind of thing on\na case-by-case basis. That's why we're establishing these\ncategories. And your interpretation was making the credit\ncard company has to know and every one is going to be a\nknock-down, drag-out, specific facts of the case. And\nthat's exactly, it seems to me, what the board didn't want\nto have happen.\nMS. GOLDSMITH: And I think that gets back to\nJustice -- Justice Kennedy's question of quite some time\nago. Where I was trying to go is that there is a\ndistinction in the nature of a late fee and an over-limit\nfee. And the -- the Federal Reserve Board went out of its\nway to create that factual distinction as to late fees.\nAnd late fees, by nature, are on the periphery of the cost\nof an extension of credit. While the total has to be\ndisclosed and your late payment is associated with whether\nor not you paid toward the total, an over-limit fee by its\nnature is tied to a specified extension of credit. May I\nhave this extension of credit, which happens to take me\nover the credit limit? Yes, you may, but we are going to\ncharge you a fee for that.\nAnd I think that's the distinction, is that to\nthe extent we have to get to -- let's just assume the\nregulation controls here. Does it make sense? Is it\nrationally based to create a factual distinction as to\nlate fees which are on the periphery of the cost of an\nextension of credit and not do so for an over-limit fee\nthat goes to the very core of what the finance charge is\nsupposed to disclose?\nQUESTION: Now you're going back to the\nregulation itself is no good.\nMS. GOLDSMITH: To the extent that it controls\nhere, which I'm not sure it does, I think yes. And that\n-- that decision comes down the nature of the fee and\nwhether or not it is so integrally tied to the cost of an\nextension of credit that it has to be disclosed as part of\nthe finance charge, and we think that it does.\nQUESTION: Ms. McDowell said that -- that in\ndollars and cents, there's no difference to the customer\nusing -- there is a dollars and cents difference, I take\nit, and would you explain what it is?\nMS. GOLDSMITH: Yes. With all due respect, I\nbelieve she said -- may I finish the question?\nQUESTION: I think you've answered it.\nMr. Waxman, you have 3 minutes remaining.\nMS. GOLDSMITH: Thank you.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. WAXMAN: The question of whether or not we\ndisclosed this fee properly within the regulation was\npassed on by the lower court. It is the law of the case.\nThe lower court held, as the second part of its ruling,\nthat, quote, unequivocally the regulation required us to\ndisclose this fee as an other charge.\nNow, Justice Scalia is correct that how you\ninterpret the Fed's bright line regulation which says, at\npage 2 of our blue brief, the following charges are not\nfinance charges. Charges for exceeding a credit limit, of\ncourse, depends on what credit limit means, and credit\nlimit is a term of art. Everybody in the industry\nunderstands it. Even the respondent at page 1 of her\nbrief, she says, quote, in the middle of the page, a\ncredit limit represents the amount of credit the card\nissuer has preapproved the consumer to obtain. There's no\npossible allegation in this case that she ever asked for\nan extension of her credit limit or received an extension\nof her credit limit.\nAnd there is a reason that the board came up\nwith an absolute bright line rule, and the reason is that\nbefore 1980, when Congress mandated classifications in\norder to simplify things for creditors and consumers, the\nFederal Reserve Board confronted -- confronted questions\nlike many of the hypotheticals that Justice Stevens and\nothers have asked here. Well, what if -- what if they\nknew that it was going to exceed it and what if somebody\nactually called and asked permission. I don't want to be\nembarrassed in the store. Will you authorize this?\nThe board literally -- and some of -- many of\nthese letter interpretations are cited in the briefs in\nthis case, although not all of them. The board drove\nitself crazy trying to answer all of these hypotheticals\nand came up with a set of letter rulings, exacerbated by\nthe Federal courts also trying to come up with their own\ninterpretations, that made it impossible for issuers to\ncome up with formulaic disclosures that would prevent them\nfrom being socked with huge class action awards and\nallowed them to present information that consumers could\ncompare.\nAnd so Congress said in 1980 we want bright line\nclassifications, and that's exactly what the board did.\nIn 1980, the board said that it was amending its\nregulations to, quote, substitute where possible precise,\neasily applied rules for principles that create ambiguity\nand -\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Waxman.\nMR. WAXMAN: Thank you, Your Honor.\n"
