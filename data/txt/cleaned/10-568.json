        "content": "(10:09 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Our last argument of\nthe term is in Case 10-568, Nevada Commission on Ethics\nv. Carrigan.\nMr. Elwood.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN P. ELWOOD\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. ELWOOD: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nNeutral laws requiring official recusal for\nconflict of interest do not abridge free speech because\na legislator's vote, however expressive, is not\nprotected speech. It is, rather, a legally binding\nexercise of State power that he wields as an incident of\npublic office.\nThe Nevada Supreme Court concluded that\nRespondent did have a free speech right to vote, and\nthat overrode the Nevada recusal statute. For four\nreasons, that holding was error.\nFirst, since the earliest days of the\nRepublic recusal rules have been understood to serve\nimportant interests unrelated to any views a legislator\nmay want to express, by requiring disqualification when\ncircumstances indicate that private interests may have\naffected his independence of judgment.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: The -- the -- the case\nis -- is presented to us with briefs that seem to pass\nin the night. Your emphasis was on whether or not there\nwas a right to vote that's protected under the First\nAmendment, and -- which is what the Nevada court held\nand you're quite correct to address it. But the\nRespondent says: Well, this interest has a chilling\neffect on -- on protected speech. I think we have to\nreach both parts of that argument.\nDo you -- DO you agree with me?\nMR. ELWOOD: I think that the Court could\nsimply address what the Nevada Supreme Court did and\ntell it whether it got it right or got it wrong, whether\nthere's a speech interest, and what -- whether that is\nsubject to strict scrutiny or not.\nBut I think that, even though that argument\nI don't think was raised or passed on below, that the\nCourt would have discretion to address that. I think it\nwould give additional guidance to the Nevada Supreme\nCourt.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, if we -- if we say\nthat intermediate scrutiny is the test, even under that\ntest, certainly under that test, the regulation cannot\nchill speech any more than necessary to fulfill the\ngovernmental interests, even under the intermediate\nstandard.\nMR. ELWOOD: I -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And -- and it just seems\nto me it's difficult for it to just address the standard\nof proof without deciding the case. Maybe you're right.\nMaybe we can just answer the -- the question that was\ncertified and -- and send it back, if -- if you prevail.\nI'm not sure.\nMR. ELWOOD: I think -- I think you're\nright, Justice Kennedy, that it would provide more\nguidance to the Nevada Supreme Court. It would be a\npretty narrow reversal and remand, assuming that the\nCourt merely reached the speech question.\nBut on the associational question, I think\nit's important to emphasize from the outset that I think\nthis would have a negligible effect on association,\nbecause it simply would not apply all that frequently.\nIn order for the recusal statute to apply, two\ncircumstances have to be simultaneously met. First,\nthere has to be a qualifying relationship which is close\nand ongoing, and simultaneously it must have the -- it\nmust -- the third party must have a private, usually\npecuniary, interest before that same legislator.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: As I understand the\nobjection, it's not to the recusal rules in general, but\nit's to the vagueness of this particular one. As I\nunderstand it, there's no concern about the specific\ncategories that were mentioned, like family member or\nemployer.\nMR. ELWOOD: That is correct, Justice -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So we're dealing not with\ncan you have recusal rules. Everybody believes, yes,\nyou can. It's the degree of specificity.\nMR. ELWOOD: Well, that was the basis of the\nholding of the Nevada Supreme Court, was that those\nimplicated speech rights and that all of them would be\nsubject to strict scrutiny. So from the outset, we may\nall be agreed that the court below applied fundamentally\ntoo high a level of scrutiny.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But the -- the objection\nto the statute on the grounds that it's vague doesn't go\naway simply because intermediate scrutiny applies, does\nit, assuming intermediate scrutiny?\nMR. ELWOOD: No, but I think that the -- our\nresponse to the vagueness argument is that Respondent\nconcedes that the four categories for members of your\nhouseholds, relatives, employers, and business\nrelationships are clear. He says that on page 2 of his\nbrief. So the question is whether the \"substantially\nsimilar\" language gums up the works, essentially.\nNow, \"substantially similar\" is a statutory\nphrase that has had to have been used by every State\nlegislature in the country and by Congress.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But not in this context.\nAnd you don't disagree that -- I forgot which brief told\nus that there's no State has a similar catch-all.\nMR. ELWOOD: Well, first, I would disagree\nwith the characterization of it as a catch-all, because\nit only sweeps in relationships that are substantially\nsimilar. But Seattle, for example, has a, what is a\ntrue catch-all, which sweeps in -- it applies \"whenever\nit could appear to a reasonable person having knowledge\nof the relevant circumstances that the covered\nindividual's judgment is impaired because of either a\npersonal or business relationship not covered under\nsubsection A or B above,\" which lists the covered\nrelationships, \"or a transaction or activity engaged in\nby the covered individual.\"\nSo while Nevada may be the only statute that\napplies \"substantially similar\" to these four\ncategories, it is not alone in that structure. And I\nthink more importantly, it is not anywhere close to\nalone in its breadth. The New Jersey statute is I\nthink, if anything, broader: \"A direct or indirect\nfinancial or personal involvement.\" There are numerous\nState statutes which apply to business associates.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, I found this statute\nvery difficult to understand, but maybe you can explain\nwhat's -- what I found a bit puzzling. The statute\ntalks about a commitment in a private capacity to the\ninterests of others.\nNow, I take it that that commitment doesn't\nhave to be something contractual. When you're talking\nabout relatives, that would assume -- that that would\ninclude emotional commitments to the relatives who are\nlisted; is that correct?\nMR. ELWOOD: I think it would include the\nthings -- the same things that are covered by\nordinary -- every other recusal statute, which is very\nclose personal relationships and relationships that give\nrise to a financial interest on the -- for the public\nofficial. And we're not talking about, you know -\nJUSTICE ALITO: Not -- not a financial\ninterest of the public official, a financial interest of\nthe -- the relative or the person who is substantially\nsimilar to a relative. Or is that wrong?\nMR. ELWOOD: Well, I think that in the case\nof the relative, yes, it's the financial interest of the\nrelative, and that's why the very close personal\nrelationship. But all of the other relationships for\nmembers of the household, who are presumably part of the\nsame economic unit, and for employers, in whom the\nofficer has obviously a very close financial interest\nand they're tied together, and for business\nrelationships, all of those are to get at the financial\ninterests of the officer, not of the third party.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Maybe if I give you an\nexample it will be clearer. Let's take somebody who is\nwithin the third degree of consanguinity. So that would\ninclude second cousins?\nMR. ELWOOD: Yes.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Okay. Now, let's say a\npublic officer is considering something that would\naffect everybody's property taxes in town or a measure\nthat would affect the benefits or the wages of everybody\nwho works for the town. And this official has a second\ncousin whose property taxes would be affected or works\nfor the town, and the second cousin's wages or benefits\nwould be affected. Now, would that person have to\nrecuse?\nMR. ELWOOD: I think that the -- it would\ndepend on a couple of things. First of all, it is a\ncovered relationship, the second cousin would be a\ncovered relationship. And -- and I think the interest\nthere I think would be the subject of some debate\nwhether it is a private interest because it is a broadly\nshared interest. But I suppose because his property\ntaxes might increase, it would be a private interest.\nThere is still the question of whether a\nreasonable person under those circumstances would view\nhis -- his judgment, his independence of judgment, as\nbeing materially affected.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, if I were a public\nofficer I would find it very difficult to figure out\nwhether a reasonable person would think that an effect\non my second cousin's property taxes would require -\nwould materially affect my judgment. But it's even\nworse than that because of the \"substantially similar.\"\nSo the public officer not only has to think about second\ncousins; the person has to think about everybody who is\nlike a second cousin to him or her. I have no idea how\nyou -- how you go about that.\nMR. ELWOOD: Well, the way that that has\nbeen defined, and this appears -- this is not just a\nNevada Commission on Ethics interpretation. This is\nwhat the legislature understood it to mean, if you look\nat the legislative history, when they added the statute\nin 1999. What they were looking for by adding the\n\"substantially similar\" relationships were relationships\nthat were substantially similar to household and\nsubstantially similar to family. And what is at issue\nthere is not the fact that you have a genetic similarity\nmakes you more likely to see things their way, but that\nfamilies are presumed to be among your closest\nrelationships.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose that you spent\nyour life in the civil rights movement or the right to\nbear arms movement or one or the other sides of the\nabortion debate, and these are your acquaintances, this\nis your -- it's been one of your principal activities,\nnot for pay, but just because of your civic commitment.\nAnd then you are elected to the legislature and under\nthis Nevada statute that controls, must you recuse\nwhenever an officer of that association has -- is paid?\nMR. ELWOOD: No, Your Honor. Because, to\nbegin with, a personal relationship, it only covers the\nvery closest personal relationships. So your most\nintimate and closest relationships on earth would be\ncovered.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: They have coffee together\nevery morning and they're in the same book club.\nMR. ELWOOD: And even that, Justice Kennedy,\napplies with extraordinary rareness. The last case that\nI'm aware of where personal interests alone justified\nrecusal was in 1999 before the statute was amended.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Elwood, for me at least\nwe've -- we've jumped way ahead. I'm not so much\nconcerned about the vagueness as I am about the\nproposition that ethical rules adopted by legislatures\nfor voting are subject to review by this Court or by any\ncourt under the First Amendment. This is the first case\nI'm aware of that we've ever had which makes such an\nallegation or -- I'm not even aware of any other case in\n220 years in Federal courts.\nAnd it's certainly not because legislative\nrules have not been vague. The first Congress adopted a\nrule that, quote, \"No member shall vote on any question\nin the event of which he is immediately and particularly\ninterested.\" I don't consider that very precise. And\nthe rules adopted by Thomas Jefferson for the Senate,\n\"Where the private interests of a member are concerned\nin a bill or question, he is to withdraw.\" \"The private\ninterests,\" what does that mean? \"And where such an\ninterest has appeared, his voice is disallowed, even\nafter a division.\"\nNow, that's been around in our Congress\nforever, but our Constitution provides that -- that the\nrules of the legislature are to be determined by\nCongress and not by this Court, and I am sure we would\nnot, we would not review those rules. Now, is there a\ncontradiction between leaving those rules to Congress\nand the First Amendment? Do you really think that -\nthat the two are set in opposition to each other?\nMR. ELWOOD: Certainly, Justice Scalia, I\nwould not think so. And this is the first case that I'm\naware of, it's the first time anyone has said it to my\nknowledge. I don't even know of law review articles\nthat said it before basically the decision that is under\nreview for neutral laws of general applicability.\nBut to return to Justice Kennedy's question,\nwhat this law -\nJUSTICE BREYER: You agree with Justice\nScalia?\nMR. ELWOOD: I agree emphatically with\nJustice Scalia, except that I could never put it as well\nas he did.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You're ending up\nskirmishing on what seems to me a less significant\naspect of this case. This case is enormously important\non that major question. I'm not inclined to resolve it\non the question, well, you know, this is too vague. I\nmean, it's even vaguer than what the first Congress\nadopted. It seems to me that just opens, opens the door\nto future litigation challenging ethical rules, which -\nwhich does not make me happy.\nMR. ELWOOD: It is true. And in addition to\nthat, to expand it even more, apply it even more\nbroadly, with the exception of essentially the D.C.\nCircuit's opinion in Clarke v. United States, this is\nthe first opinion I'm aware of where anyone has even\nheld that there is a First Amendment interest in any\nsort of expressive official act.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You modified your\nanswer to Justice Scalia by saying you're not aware of\nany case that applied the First Amendment to rules of\ngeneral -- neutral rules of general applicability, I\nthink. But if the First Amendment doesn't apply, that\ndoesn't matter, does it? You can't limit your -- the\ntype of rules that you say are not -- are okay and are\nnot if the First Amendment doesn't apply at all?\nMR. ELWOOD: I'm not sure I understand your\nquestion, Justice, but I think -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, if the First\nAmendment doesn't apply to this type of activity, then\nyou would have no First Amendment objection to biased\nrules of specific applicability.\nMR. ELWOOD: Oh, absolutely we would,\nbecause I think R.A.V. v. City of St. Paul speech that\nis subject to prescription can't be regulated in a\nviewpoint-based manner.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I thought your\nposition was that this wasn't speech protected by the\nFirst Amendment.\nMR. ELWOOD: But even speech that is not\nprotected by the First Amendment, such as fighting words\nin R.A.V., can't be regulated in a viewpoint-based\nmanner.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So someone can\nchallenge one of these rules on the grounds that it's\nnot neutral, that it applies in a disproportionate way\nto particular members of the legislature?\nMR. ELWOOD: I think they could challenge it\nin a way -- alleging that it was viewpoint-based if it\nwere only applied to Democrats or Republicans. But I\ndon't think that if it were an otherwise normally\napplicable rule that it would be subject to challenge on\nthat basis. That is the relevance of neutrality.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: I'm not sure why you should\nconcede even that, Mr. Elwood. If this is just conduct,\nif this is not proscribable speech of the kind that\nR.A.V. was talking about, why should we care about the\nviewpoint based doctrine that's arisen in First\nAmendment law?\nMR. ELWOOD: Well, in the event, Justice\nKagan, that is how I interpret R.A.V., that it would not\nbe an available option to have a viewpoint-based recusal\nstatute that affected things differently depending on\nviewpoint.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you think that\nthe rules in the House of Representatives allocating\ntime on the floor or committee membership are neutral?\nThey're biased in favor of whichever party happens to be\nin the majority.\nMR. ELWOOD: They are -- I think that\nthey're -- I think that they're neutrally applicable. I\ndon't know that they would -- I am not aware of them\napplying different amounts of time to majority and\nminority members. I may be incorrect about that.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, and if they did we\nwould review it.\nMR. ELWOOD: I think that any time you're\ntalking about -- I mean, depending on what the house is,\nthere's an extra measure of deference when you're\napplying, obviously, to the houses of Congress.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Isn't that nice. But the\ncases come up here anyway, right?\nMR. ELWOOD: They certainly do come.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Look, fighting words are\nwords. They are speech. There's no doubt that they're\nspeech. And it's a considerable question whether the\nvote of a legislature is speech for purposes of the\nfirst -- is speech at all, not whether it's a fighting\nspeech or something else, whether it's speech. It's a\nvote.\nMR. ELWOOD: But in any event, all the Court\neven needs to get to is whether laws of neutral\napplicability would be covered, because that's all this\nstatute is.\nJUSTICE ALITO: This statute doesn't apply\njust to voting. It says that the public officer shall\nnot vote upon or advocate the passage or failure of the\nmessage.\nMR. ELWOOD: But that is essentially -\nJUSTICE ALITO: Advocating the passage or\nfailure of the message is surely speech in the ordinary\nunderstanding of the concept.\nMR. ELWOOD: But that is to essentially\ncomplete the disqualification just as under Thomas\nJefferson's recusal rule. When you were disqualified\nunder Jefferson's rule, you were out of it. You\ncouldn't essentially function as a legislator, and\nthat's all that attempts to do. It hasn't been applied\nto Mr. Carrigan.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: It doesn't apply to\noutside advocacy? It just applies to advocacy within\nthe limits -\nMR. ELWOOD: Absolutely. It does not apply\nto advocacy as a citizen outside the legislature.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But even if you have a law\nwhich is not directed to speech and is directed at\nconduct which is not speech, that law is still -\ncorrect me if I'm wrong -- even under intermediate\nscrutiny, subject to invalidation if it has a chilling\neffect on -- on speech as an incidental matter, if that\nchilling effect is more than is necessary to accomplish\nthe purpose of the statute. Isn't that correct?\nMR. ELWOOD: I -- if it is reviewed -- I\nmean, it depends on the test you use. We don't think\nthat O'Brien, which is a test that some of the amici\nhave proposed, is an appropriate standard, because even\nO'Brien is talking about laws that have a much greater\neffect on expression because, after all, burning a draft\ncard, one of the main reasons you would want to do that\nis an expressive reason.\nWhereas these really are laws that have\nnothing to do with what views people think you are going\nto be expressing. And we think that a closer analogy\nare cases like Burdick, where there are laws of neutral\napplicability that States use to regulate their\nprocesses of self-government. And those, unless they\nhave a severe burden on association, have been subject\nto review for reasonableness under Burdick and Timmons,\nand that entire line of cases. We think that furnishes\na much more appropriate analogy for this case.\nJUSTICE BREYER: The statute says \"or\nadvocate the passage of.\" So I guess that's speech.\nMR. ELWOOD: But, Justice Breyer -\nJUSTICE BREYER: And the -- I mean, the\nbasic question is, again, do you agree with Justice\nScalia's question, the import of it; or don't you?\nMR. ELWOOD: But Justice -\nJUSTICE BREYER: If it doesn't apply, if\nvoting is not speech, then no matter how outrageous the\nlaw or rule, it doesn't fall within the First Amendment;\nand if it is speech, then you get into some of the\nquestions that were raised, is this too vague or is it\nnot?\nSo which is it?\nMR. ELWOOD: Justice Breyer, I don't think\nwe have to get as far as the position that Justice Kagan\nwas suggesting, that I think Justice Scalia is\nsuggesting, because we're willing to abide by R.A.V. and\nrequire neutrality in the regulations of this. I think\nthe -\nJUSTICE BREYER: We might have to write an\nopinion, irrespective -\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- which says -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You may be willing to, but\nI'm not.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- either it is speech or\nnot, and so that's why we're asking the question, to get\nyour opinion -\nMR. ELWOOD: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- which is an informed\nopinion, about how we should write that paragraph. Do\nwe say that voting is within the First Amendment scope\nor do we say it is not?\nMR. ELWOOD: I think you would say that it\nis not, that it is not -- voting -\nJUSTICE BREYER: In that case, the most\noutrageous law you can think of -\nMR. ELWOOD: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- in respect of voting is\nnot covered by the First Amendment?\nMR. ELWOOD: I -- Justice Breyer, we again\nare willing to bite off -- we are willing to abide by\nR.A.V. -\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, I'm not asking for\nwilling to do -\nMR. ELWOOD: It can be a neutral restriction\non voting, which is not itself -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Elwood, why is that\nextraordinary? Why aren't you willing to accept that?\nI mean, if -- if the Speaker of the House counts the\nvotes wrong and he says the ayes have it when it's\nobvious that the ayes don't have it, do we review that?\nMR. ELWOOD: I think that that represents -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Is there any greater\nviolation of the principles of democracy than counting\nthe votes wrong in the legislature? Yet that matter is\nnot reviewable here, is it?\nMR. ELWOOD: I -- I don't believe that it\nwould be.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So why is it extraordinary\nthat this one should not be reviewable?\nMR. ELWOOD: Justice, I just think that\nthere are certain things that you don't -- there's a -\nthere's a sort of principle when you're dealing with\nother branches of government that you don't look behind\nit when they certify things. This Court has held that\nin various contexts. And I don't think -- you know, it\nmay well be that that would support an even -- a\nstronger rule than we are advocating; but, you know, all\nwe are here to defend is a neutral law on the part of\nthe State of Nevada.\nJUSTICE ALITO: In several recent cases the\nCourt has taken pains to make the point that it is not\ngoing to recognize any new categories of unprotected\nspeech. But the argument that you seem to be endorsing\nnow in response to some questions is that there is this\nnew category of unprotected speech, which is advocacy of\nthe passage of legislation when a recusal statute comes\ninto play.\nMR. ELWOOD: But I think that if there's any\nlaw that has a better claim to -- to be added to that\ncategory, it's one that would be consistent with a law\nor a rule that was adopted by the first Congress 7 days\nafter they first achieved a quorum. I mean, those were\nthe people who were the people who proposed and framed\nthe First Amendment, and they never indicated that they\nthought any sort of personal First Amendment right was\nimplicated by recusal rules, either by them or Thomas\nJefferson's rule, which was not even a rule adopted by\nthe whole House.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, just to clarify\nthis issue, because I don't know that I've heard you\nstate it explicitly, the second part of this recusal\nstatute that bars the advocacy of a measure in which\nthere's an interest prohibited by the statute, it is\nyour position that's advocacy in the legislative body?\nMR. ELWOOD: Absolutely.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So it's only limited to\ngetting up on the floor and talking about that?\nMR. ELWOOD: That is absolutely correct. We\nview it as basically completing the disqualification and\nsaying you are just not, you cannot act as a legislature\nin deciding whether this bill will be passed.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That person can still go\noutside and give all the press releases they want?\nMR. ELWOOD: Absolutely, they can.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What do we do with cases\nlike Miller v. Town of Hull and Colson v. Grohman that\nhave recognized retaliation claims because of speeches\ngiven during the casting of a vote? Would those cases\nstill be viable if we decide that there is no First\nAmendment right in voting?\nMR. ELWOOD: I -- I think they would be\nviable under the -- the way we are framing it, which is\nthat basically if it's a law of general applicability\nthat you could still bring a claim of retaliation,\nwhich -- those kind of claims are problematic for other\nreasons because there's a lot of what would be called\nretaliation that is itself protected by the First\nAmendment.\nBut if you're talking about a official who\nis a civil service employee, assuming you need to even\nget there because they have their own civil service\nrights to be there, they would still have the claim that\nit was based on viewpoint-based discrimination, and\nunder the rule we are proposing -- or the rule that we\nare willing to abide by, certainly -- R.A.V. v. City of\nSt. Paul would protect those people for a retaliation\nclaim.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Carrigan -- if -- if we\ndid not review any of these ethical rules applicable to\na legislature, at least where the rule is adopted by the\nlegislative body itself, as -- as opposed to being\nimposed upon it by -- by some other body, there is the\nprotection that all of the legislators are subject to\nit. So if it's vague for Mr. Carrigan in this case,\nit's vague for everybody else as well.\nMR. ELWOOD: That is true, Justice Scalia.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And so it's sort of a\nself-regulating mechanism. You -\nMR. ELWOOD: That's true.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You have to be willing to\nabide by whatever -- whatever vagueness and whatever\nethical rules you -- you have opposed -- imposed on\nsomebody else.\nMR. ELWOOD: That is true, and this law\napplied -- for the better part of 30 years, it applied\nto every legislator in the State of Nevada. In July of\n2009 the State Supreme Court struck it down as applied\nto members of the legislature. But this was the rule\nthey lived under and they didn't think it was ambiguous,\nthey didn't think that it chilled their associational\nrights. They seemed to think it was just -- that it was\njust fine.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I suppose you would\nhave a First Amendment claim under your theory if the\ngenerally applicable rule was applied in a\ndiscriminatory manner; it turned out, you go back and\nlook and over the last 2 years the only people who have\nbeen sanctioned for violating the ethics rules have been\nmembers of the minority party.\nMR. ELWOOD: I think that that is another\none of those -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That would be a\nviable First Amendment -\nMR. ELWOOD: Those sort of discriminatory\nenforcement claims are whole 'nother ball of wax. And I\nmean, they're certainly, you know, very hard to prove;\nand they bring up all those sort of Armstrong issues\nabout, you know, presumptive regularity and that people\nare acting in good faith.\nI don't know that that would be a First\nAmendment claim, but perhaps a equal protection claim.\nBut it's certainly not presented here. There's never\nbeen any allegation that these laws have been enforced\ndiscriminatorily. In fact, arising from the same vote,\nthe Nevada Commission on Ethics sanctioned an opponent\nof the Lazy 8 Casino because he had an undisclosed\ninterest in -- business interest in the Nugget, which\nwas a political opponent of this.\nIf I could reserve the remainder of my time\nfor rebuttal.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.\nElwood.\nMr. Rosenkranz.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JOSHUA E. ROSENKRANZ\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Thank you, Mr. Chief\nJustice, and may it please the Court:\nThe core problem with this statute which the\nCourt has been grappling with is this: an elect -- an\nunelected commission has arrogated to itself essentially\nthe right to invalidate an election result and to do it\nin a way that treats core political association as\ncorrupting. If the police of political purity are going\nto tell an elected official that he cannot cast the vote\nthat he ran on and was elected to cast, they have to do\nit clearly, they have to do it prospectively, and they\nhave to do it for an important reason.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So if the\nlegislature adopts a rule that says from now on we're\ngoing to require a four-fifths majority for a bill to\npass, that lowers the effectiveness of the speech of\nsomeone in the minority, and you can challenge that on\nFirst Amendment grounds?\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: I think not, Your Honor,\nbecause that is a way of organizing the institution that\napplies equally to all members of the institution.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So does this.\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Well, this will -- this\nwill single out individuals at any particular moment in\ntime who are specifically isolated and told that\nthat particular individual cannot vote.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How is that different\nfrom the minority people in the Chief Justice's? It\nonly affects them when they're in the minority?\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Well, yes, Your Honor. And\nI think -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So it only affects\nsomebody if they fall within the strictures of the\nstatute?\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: And my -- my point is\nsimply that this takes one particular legislator and\nsays, you cannot vote. And those rules are completely\nfine in certain circumstances, but not when the effect\nis to tell someone that the rationale, the reason that\nyou are being isolated is because you associated with\nsomeone politically who helped you win an election.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Rosenkranz, you are\nnot -- is it right that you are not challenging any part\nof this statute except the one that -- that says\n\"substantially similar\"? The rest you have no\nconstitutional objection to; is that right?\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: That is correct, Justice\nGinsburg. And more precisely, we are challenging the\nuse of that \"substantially similar\" provision to expand\nthe statute to -- to relationships that bear no relation\nto the actual text of the statute.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Rosenkranz, is -- is\nthe vote of a judge in a case like the vote of a\nlegislator? Is -- is that speech? Because judges are\nsubject to ethical rules which -- which prohibit their\nparticipating if there would be, quote, \"an appearance\nof impropriety.\" If there's anything vaguer than that I\ncan't imagine what it might be. Can I get out of all\nthat stuff?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Here's -- here's what you\ncan get out of, Your Honor. You can get out of -- for\nexample, if you are, in addition to being a judge, a law\nprofessor at a State university and that university\nfires you because of an opinion that you issued, that\nopinion is speech. That vote has speech aspects to it.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Are you answering my\nquestion? I want to know whether I can get out of this\nappearance of impropriety stuff.\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: The answer is no.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why?\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: For two reasons. One is\nthat judges are just plain different from legislators.\nJudges are supposed to bring no political loyalties at\nall to them when they are sitting on the bench.\nLegislators are actually not only allowed to, but\nexpected, to bring political loyalties when they -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What does that have to do\nwith whether the First Amendment applies, with all of\nits prohibitions against vagueness?\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: The answer again, Your\nHonor, is when it comes to judges, we tolerate quite a\nbit more by way of chill of a judge's vote precisely\nbecause judges are supposed to act judicial and purge\ntheir vote of all extraneous effects.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's too bad, because I\nwould have been much more attracted to your position.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: I -- I understand, Your\nHonor.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: And -- and Mr. Rosenkranz,\nwhat about officials in the Executive Branch? When the\nSecretary of Defense gives a speech and the President\ndoesn't like it and the President fires the Secretary of\nDefense, does the Secretary of Defense have a First\nAmendment action?\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: The Secretary of Defense\nhas a First Amendment argument. It would be a very weak\none under -- under this Court's opinion in Garcetti.\nBut his First Amendment rights are implicated if it's a\nspeech that he's giving not in the line of his duty.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: So all the official acts in\nthe legislature, in the Executive Branch, you're somehow\nsaying courts are different, so I guess we don't have to\nworry about that, but official acts across the\ngovernment are now subject to First Amendment analysis?\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Absolutely not, Your Honor,\nand that was this Court's holding in Garcetti. And the\nreason this Court held that in Garcetti was that there\nthe government is acting as employer. The government is\nentitled to discipline its own employees like any other\nemployer can. But we all agree government as employer,\nthat Pickering standard, doesn't really work in the\ncontext of regulation of political activity.\nJUSTICE ALITO: What about the rules of\ncivility in the houses of Congress? There are things\nthat a member of the Senate, for example, cannot say\nabout another Senator, or make a personal attack. That\nwould be protected by the First Amendment if the Senator\nstepped outside the door. Are those -- is there First\nAmendment protection for that? Do they have -- do those\nrules have to pass First Amendment scrutiny?\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Within the chamber, Your\nHonor, no, if it's just the chamber that's sanctioning\nsomeone. And the reason is those are Roberts Rules of\nOrder that apply to everyone and that -- that\norder the -- the debate. But I -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Well, I don't understand\nthat. I mean, this rule applies to everyone, too. It\nmight apply to one person on one vote and to another\nperson on another vote, but everybody at every vote has\nto look at these ethical rules and decide whether they\nhave to recuse themselves as a result.\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: And -- and so this is a\nrule, though -- we have to go back to what its effect is\noutside of the legislature. This is a rule that takes\npolitical associations and treats them as corrupting,\ncore political associations, volunteering of the sort -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Well, do you think that if\nthere were a statute -- let's take out the vagueness\naspect of this. If there were a statute that said you\ncan't vote on anything where you have yourself some\nmonetary gain attached to it or if a very close family\nmember or if a close business associate or campaign\nmanager of your campaign, do you think that would be\nunconstitutional?\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: It would not be vague, Your\nHonor. But it would be unconstitutional, unless the\nState demonstrates why a campaign manager is corrupting.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Because the -- the State -\nwhat the State thinks is that a campaign manager is just\nlike a business partner.\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: And -- and the answer to\nthat is no. A volunteer campaign manager is not just\nlike a business partner. There is no pecuniary gain to\nthe -- to the candidate or the legislator as there is in\na relationship with a business partner. There's\npersonal political loyalty. That's what the Ethics\nCommission said was wrong -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- no -- there's no -- I\nthought this -- the -- the only reason that we have this\ncase is that the three-time campaign manager was -- did\nhave a financial stake in this vote because the project\nwas approved.\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: No, Your Honor, that's not\nwhy we're here. That's not why the commission said we\nare here in the first instance. The commission is now\nsaying we're here because of that, but what the\ncommission said was it's the closeness of this\nrelationship, without regard to the financial gain,\nwhich the commission accepted was zero for this\nparticular lobbyist. Regardless of the financial gain,\nit was the political loyalty. This guy helped you win.\nBecause he helped you win, you will be beholden to him\nand do him more favors.\nWell, lots of political activists help a\ncandidate win. But on that -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But it -- it seems to me\nthat if you're going to make this argument -- and this\nis the point we discussed with Mr. Elwood -- there are\ntwo ways to do it. Number one, say this infringes the\nright to vote, which is a First Amendment right; or you\ncan say that this impinges unduly on necessary rights of\nassociation that preceded your election to the\nlegislative post.\nIt seems to me that the latter is the only\nway that you can make your case and to avoid the force\nof the argument that the Petitioner makes.\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, it is certainly\ncorrect that the latter is far narrower. This is an\noutlier statute. No other legislature has ever adopted\na statute that says campaign manager or political\nloyalty is corrupting. And so this Court could very\neasily say, look, this is just different from all of the\nother recusal statutes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: It doesn't seem to be\ndifferent from the ones that Mr. Elwood read to us. I\nthink he read probably one from New Jersey and -\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, he -- he cited\none case from New Jersey. The statute does not refer to\npolitical loyalty. And in that case it was a close\nfriendship, and in the course of describing the close\nfriendship the court, after listing multiple factors,\nsaid one of them was that they were both part of the\nsame political club. They also vacationed together.\nThat's a completely different application.\nNo State and no commission -- so far as we\nknow from the briefs, there's no case cited where any\ncommission has said this relationship between a\nvolunteer and a candidate is itself so corrupting that\nwe have to disqualify the candidate from casting the\nvote, the vote that he ran on, that the voters elected\nhim to cast.\nAnd if this -- if this is accepted, it\nplaces an impossible drag on the associational rights.\nThe candidate will have to think twice before ever\nhiring or enlisting a volunteer who is a political\nactivist. He will want to recruit the best, the most\ntalented, the most savvy, but he will always have to ask\nhimself: What will this person do 3 years from now that\nmight disqualify me from -- from embarking on my duty\nthat I was elected to engage in?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's rather exaggerated.\nI mean, you have to worry he's going to buy a casino\nor -- or something like that? I mean -\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: No, Your Honor. Let me\ngive you a concrete example from real life that happens\nall the time. If the NRA or NARAL decide that they\nbelieve strongly in a piece of legislation and they hire\na lobbyist, so there's benefit to the lobbyist from this\nrelationship, and that lobbyist says \"I, too, am on\nmission; I continually lose in the legislature because\nit hangs in the balance, I'm going to work for\ncandidates who will tip the balance for me, the\ncommission's opinion says that that lobbyist, because\nhe's worked on that campaign and wins, will by that very\nact invalidate the vote of the legislator.\nThat's just untenable, and there's no way to\ninterpret the -- the opinion that the commission\nactually wrote to make that anything other than the\nnatural consequence of its -- of its opinion.\nAnd worse yet, from the -- from the -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: If that's what it means,\nyou would think the legislature would change it,\nwouldn't you?\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Well -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, it doesn't just\nhurt Mr. Carrigan. That -- you know, that -- that would\nbe something every legislator would -- would worry about\nand say, oh, boy, we've got to change this.\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Yes, Your Honor -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So why don't we let them\nchange it?\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Yes, Your Honor. Yet the\nlegislature comes in with an amicus brief to this Court\nand says that its interpretation of this statute is all\nit needs to have is a relationship that is analogous or\nparallel to those -- this is on page 32 of their amicus\nbrief -- analogous or parallel, and they are defending\nthe application of this statute to political loyalty.\nBut let's look at the other side of the\nequation; that is the -- the Vasquezes of the world, the\nNRA advocate. On that side of the equation, anyone who\ndeeply holds a view that's political -- let's say it's\nMr. Vasquez, he is pro-development. They will refrain\nfrom joining campaigns out of fear that when they join\nthe campaign, they will get the candidate disqualified.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So why -- I mean, what the\ncommission says is Mr. Vasquez has been a close personal\nfriend, confidante, and political advisor throughout the\nyears. So that doesn't sound like any volunteer. It\nsounds like somebody sitting on a case where his best\nfriend is likely to gain millions of dollars.\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: That -\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's what it seems when I\nread that opinion, that they're thinking all these\nthings combined is what causes this to fall within the\ncategory of a reasonable person might have doubts about\nthe independence of judgment.\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, they gave a\ngestalt at the end.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes.\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: They lead with\n\"instrumental in the success of all three of Councilman\nCarrigan's campaigns,\" and they go through a long\nnarrative about the political relationship. These were\nnot -\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's part of it. But\nmy -- my basic question is, as you know, with judges,\nand I guess you have a very vague statute which was\nquoted to you, and what we have are subsidiary rules\nwith ethics commissioners. I have in my office -\nthey're not commissioners; they're committees of judges.\nAnd I have in my office seven volumes which\nI look at when there's a question, as others do, and\nthose seven volumes contain dozens of opinions of a\ncommittee trying to apply vague statutes and vague\nrules -- not constitutionally vague, but generally.\nSo what's wrong with Nevada doing exactly\nthe same thing here?\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Because the difference,\nYour Honor, is judges are a -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Oh, so you're saying that\nthe difference is that we're judges?\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: You mean Congress and\nlegislators and Executive Branch people couldn't have\nexactly the same system?\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: So -\nJUSTICE BREYER: And they have general\nrules? It's called the common law system.\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: The answer is no, not when\nit affects associational rights. So let me just\ndistinguish -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Did you argue\nassociational rights below?\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Oh absolutely, Your Honor.\nAnd the commission -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Why do you think the\ncourt didn't address it? Because it relied on the First\nAmendment analysis?\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: I don't know why the court\ndidn't address it. It was front and center. It was a\nsection -- it was called overbreadth, but for eight\npages, from page 9 to page 18, there is extensive\ndiscussion that what they meant by overbreadth is this\nreaches too broad, this reaches relationships that\nshould not be reached. It was not in the cert\nopposition, but it was front and center before the\nNevada Supreme Court.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Is there any catch-all\nthat you would say would pass your constitutional test?\nYou told us that the four specific categories, member of\nthe household, employer, that those are all right\nbecause they're specific. But you don't like the\n\"substantially similar.\" Is there any catch-all that a\nlegislature could adopt that would pass what you -\nwhat's constitutional?\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: I -- it's hard to imagine\none. Let me just point out, no -- it is very, very rare\nfor a legislature to do anything other than what's in A\nthrough D.\nAnd the problem with this catch-all, which\nby the way is the term that was used by both the courts\nbelow -- the problem with this catch-all is perhaps the\nwords are okay, maybe. I mean, I can imagine someone\ninterpreting those words so narrowly that they're okay.\nBut what this catch-all does is to add language to the\noriginal four criteria, so it's not just family members\nand business associates. It's now friends, close\nfriends.\nJUSTICE BREYER: You didn't answer my\nquestion, which is since the Judiciary uses what's\ncalled the common law method, why is it impermissible\nfor the Executive Branch or the Legislative Branch also\nto use a common law, case-by-case method of elucidating\nthrough example what a general -- what a general\nprovision means?\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: The answer, Your Honor, is\nthe Judiciary does not engage in political activity\noutside -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, I -- so you're saying\nthat one who engages has to use a -- a definitive\nrule-based method rather than a common law method? So\nmy question there would be, assuming your difference\nbetween the branches is right, still why?\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: And the answer is that the\ncandidate and the volunteer have to know ex ante whether\nto engage in this relationship or not.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: But why do they have to know\nex ante? There was an advisory process that was set up\nby the Nevada commission here.\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: And the -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Carrigan chose not to\nuse it. But he could have gone to the commission, said:\nWhat do you think about this relationship? Does it fit\nor does it not fit?\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, the advisory\nprocess, the problem with it is that it comes too late.\nThe relationship was already in place. If you're -- if\nthe -- if the commission is going to invalidate the\nresult of an election, where everyone is talking about\nthis issue and everyone knows about this relationship,\nthey've got to tell them before they're engaged in the\nrelationship. Mr. Carrigan would have dropped Mr.\nVasquez.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I mean, but that -\nbut that's unworkable to say, you know, that every\npotential -- I think I might run for office next year\nand so I'm going to get advice from some committee as to\nwho I can associate with? That just is unworkable.\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: My point exactly, Your\nHonor. You cannot -- you -- you don't know in advance,\nbecause you can't know what's going to come out 3 years\nlater. You can't know what conflicts will arise, and so\nyou don't know in advance. You can't present the\nquestion to the -- to the commission.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, I've kind\nof lost the thread of your argument. Is this a\nvagueness claim or a First Amendment claim? I gather\nyour claim is going to be the same even if the statute\nclearly said family members, you know, business\npartners, and political consultants.\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Correct, Your Honor; and it\nis both. There are basically two halves to it. One is,\neven if statute were perfectly clear, this is a\nrelationship that the State is not allowed to view as\ntoxic, because it is not a toxic relationship in a\ndemocratic process; and secondly, this is also vague, so\nthere was no notice up front as to the fact that the\ncommission would later invalidate the result of the\nelection on this basis.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is your vagueness\nargument, is that a First Amendment argument of its own?\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: It is a baseline vagueness\nargument on due process grounds, but it gets elevated\nbecause of the First Amendment interest.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So we can decide\nyour vagueness -- if we agree with you on vagueness, we\ndon't have to determine whether the First Amendment\napplies in this type of situation?\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Oh, that is correct, Your\nHonor, absolutely.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: In the -- in the Nevada\ncourt you argued overbreadth. That was the -- at least\nhow the court understood your challenge, and here\noverbreadth takes a back seat, and vagueness is the\nprinciple on which you rely dominantly.\nSo what accounts for the shift? You were\narguing overbreadth before the Nevada Supreme Court.\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: The answer, Your Honor, is\nthat the Nevada Supreme Court shifted. So before the\nNevada Supreme Court, everything was on the table.\nThere was vagueness, there was overbreadth, there was\nextended relationships -- extending to a relationship\nthat's First Amendment-protected.\nThe two key pieces, first was vagueness and\nthen second was this overbreadth argument as I've\ndescribed it, which really was about the protected\nrelationship. The Nevada Supreme Court called it\noverbreadth, but if you look carefully at what it\nactually says, it is vagueness at every step of the way.\nIt is talking about -- this is on pages 14 to 15 on to\n16 and 17. It is talking about the Constitution\ndemanding a high level of -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: What's the standard for\nvagueness that we apply? We apply vagueness to First\nAmendment prohibitions or restrictions on speech. We\napply vagueness to criminal statutes. This isn't a\ncriminal statute. It does have a civil penalty. What\nis the case that I consult to see what standard of\nvagueness I apply?\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Gentile, Your Honor.\nGentile is a case that is about sanctions. It's about\nsanctions for First Amendment-protected activity. And\nthe standard really is -- I mean, it's articulated the\nsame way in all these circumstances, but it really is,\ncan a reasonably intelligent person know in advance that\nthey are going to be sanctioned for this?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Here we're talking\nabout penalty for participating. What -- what if it's a\ndisclosure rule saying, you know, you can participate,\nyou can vote, you can advocate, you just have to\ndisclose interest of this sort.\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: I think -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is that problematic\nunder -\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Not at all, Your Honor.\nThat's perfectly appropriate. That is in fact what Mr.\nCarrigan did right at the outset of -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right. Well,\ndoesn't that burden his First Amendment rights?\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: A lot, yes; but a lot less\nso. And this Court has -- is very comfortable with\ndisclosure when you're talking about public officials as\nlighter medicine, less severe medicine than an outright\nban or a punishment for that association. That's the\nway it should work in the political process. Everyone\nin this election was aware of Vasquez's role. It was\nfront page news when the hearing was going on. And so\nfor a commission -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: If the relationship\nwasn't particularly special, no more special than any\nother political volunteer, why did that become front\npage news?\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Oh -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And if your client\ndidn't have a suspicion that he was on the edge of a\nlaw, why did he bother going to the city attorney to get\nan opinion?\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Because as he testified,\nand the commission did not disagree, this guy is a Boy\nScout, Your Honor. He does everything to avoid any\nappearance of impropriety. And he said: I did that\nbecause I just wanted to make sure; I am not a lawyer.\nAnd the city attorney, of course, gave an opinion\nthat gave him a clean bill of health, said: Yes, go\nforth and do this.\nNow, if the lawyer doesn't know and the\ncommissioners can't settle on which of these things the\nrelationship is most similar to, and the district court\ncan't choose one, how is it possible for someone in\nMr. Carrigan's position to know ex ante -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How will we ever\nwrite -- how will the Congress ever write a law that\nwould be so clear that clients would never have to go to\nlawyers -\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- or that lawyers\ncouldn't disagree about? We would have to invalidate\nvirtually every law as vague.\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Less so in the First\nAmendment -- I mean, more so in the First Amendment\ncontext. In all the other contexts, the standards are\nlightened -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But you're not -- you're\nnot denying that most laws would be vague -\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Under that definition?\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: And there is a -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That lawyers disagree on\nthe conclusion of what the law means?\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: And -- and there is a big\ndifference between ambiguity of particular words and\nwhat the commission did here, which was to say we see\nthese four categories, we are not applying any of these\nfour categories. We're saying -- we're extracting a\nprinciple. It's a principle of closeness.\nNow, close enough for government work when\nit comes to relationships that are First Amendment\nprotected just isn't good enough when it -- when you're\ntalking about that context.\nSo I did want to talk just for a moment\nabout the degree of burden that we're talking about\nhere, because the commission seems to be saying no big\ndeal, this is just a disqualification provision. It's\nnot actually a burden at all.\nNow, I think we all agree that if the State\nof Nevada declared that anyone who is a campaign manager\ncan never lobby the legislature, that would be\nunconstitutional, and they'll fine them for it, where\nthe strict scrutiny would also apply if the State passed\na law fining a candidate for choosing a campaign manager\nwho lobbies the legislature.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: I'm not sure I understand\nthat, Mr. Rosenkranz. There are many laws out there\nthat say people who serve in certain government\ncapacities, when they leave those jobs, can't lobby for\na certain number of years. How is that any different?\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: It would be subject to\nscrutiny for sure. It would be subject to First\nAmendment scrutiny. And that would be justified on the\nground not of the closeness of relationships that are\nformed, but on the ground that you don't want\nlegislators here and now as they are sitting in the\nchamber thinking about generating business with their\nfuture clients and changing their votes because of that.\nThat's the justification.\nBut there's no such justification here. The\ncommission has never articulated why political loyalty\nis so toxic that it needs to be banished from politics.\nAnd so, just on the -- on the directness of the burden\nyet, for a political activist who is engaged in these\nsorts of relationships, the burden of being told, you've\ngot to choose right at the outset, are you going to\nrepresent -- are you going to help this candidate get\nelected or are you going to lobby? That is worse than a\nfine, because a political activist wants to do both\nprecisely because they care about the ultimate results.\nAnd for the candidate himself who is\ndeciding right upfront which of the universe of players\nam I going to take as volunteers, they need to know\nupfront whether this relationship will be viewed as\ntoxic, and if it is, they will not engage in that\nrelationship.\nThis is no less direct than the burden that\nthis Court recognized as unconstitutional in the Davis\ncase, the Millionaire's Amendment Case, or in Burdick,\nwhere the only burden was that the paid petitioner would\nhave to register to vote, which is a nominal burden, but\nthose whose consciences were affected by a registration\nwere kept out of the process.\nIf there are no further questions, I\nrespectfully request that the Court affirm the judgment.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Elwood, you have 5 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN P. ELWOOD\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. ELWOOD: Now, my colleague argues that\nthe Nevada recusal statute targets political\nassociation, and that is simply not the case. Nothing\nin the statute about politics. Mr. Carrigan was recused\nbecause he had a business relationship with Mr. Vasquez.\nWholly apart from the personal relationship and the fact\nthat he was his three-time campaign manager, he was also\nthe firm -- the campaign's main outside vendor, and 89\npercent of the Carrigan campaign expenditures were paid\nthrough his advertising firm. That is -\nJUSTICE BREYER: I think his argument is --\nI don't see -- that the Ethics Commission at least in\npart relied upon the fact that he was the campaign\nmanager, and he is saying, I think, as I understand it,\nor at least I have this question, that an ethics\ncommission cannot disqualify a legislator on the ground,\neven in part, that an individual had a political\nassociation with him previously.\nMR. ELWOOD: I think that -\nJUSTICE BREYER: It may be a new argument in\nthis Court, I don't know.\nMR. ELWOOD: I think the fact that this\nhappened to be a political relationship was incidental.\nIf Mr. Carrigan -- Mr. Vasquez does two things, he's a\ncampaign manager, he's a -- he assists in development.\nIf Mr. Carrigan had had exactly the same relationship,\nbut had just been working with him on the development\nside, it would have been exactly the same situation. If\nhe had helped him with past -- I think the fact that -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Is that a new argument in\nthis Court, as I've stated it to you?\nMR. ELWOOD: I -- I don't believe so. That\nthey've made that argument -\nJUSTICE BREYER: You made that argument\nbelow?\nMR. ELWOOD: That -- right. What we have\nhere -- I don't know if they use the term that it was\nincidental. But I mean they -- if you look at the\nopinion at pages 105 to 106 of the Pet. App, it's clear\nthat they're looking at the business relationship. It's\nrelevant, certainly, to have helped him win three\nelections, because that's relevant to the closeness of\ntheir personal relationship, but -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I think Justice Breyer's\nquestion -- he can tell me if I'm wrong -- is whether\nthat argument by them was actually raised below the way\nhe is stating today?\nMR. ELWOOD: I'm sorry? I -- the argument\nby the -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Whether that\nassociational right of the political -\nMR. ELWOOD: Oh. My understanding, the way\nI view the briefs is there two references to an\nassociational right in the briefs, and the opening brief\nbefore the Supreme Court, I think it's page 918 -- and\nit was in the context of making a vagueness argument. I\nlooked through it, you can look through it and see what\nyou think, but I did not see that as an argument that\nthis is burdening our associational rights. But I\nthink -\nJUSTICE ALITO: If they based their decision\nsolely on the -- on the fact that Vasquez had been the\ncampaign manager in the past and he was a great campaign\nmanager, and perhaps Carrigan would like him to be his\ncampaign manager in the future, would there be a problem\nthen?\nMR. ELWOOD: I think that -- I think\nprobably not, because if the question is whether it -\nit burdens associations so much that it's chilling, and\nI mean, basically I think that's a -- an empirical\nquestion. And because you have to have a particular\ninterest, a private interest in order to be recused, I\nthink that it wouldn't arise so frequently that it would\nbe a problem; but I think more fundamentally here, or at\nleast for purposes of this case, because it comes here\nat least Respondent says this as an as-applied\nchallenge.\nWhat we have here is a relationship that was\nfront page news, because this isn't just some plain\nvanilla campaign volunteer. This is somebody with whom\nhe has a very intimate business relationship that -\nthat involved this expenditure of $46,000.\nAnd I think another thing that is worth\nnoting is that in 10 years on the books this law has\nnever been applied to campaign volunteers. It's -- in\norder -- campaign volunteers specifically come up in the\nlegislative history of the '99 Act, and they would say\nwould not, without more, be covered, because what this\ncovers is the same types of relationships that every\nother recusal statute covers -- very close relationships\nand relationships that give rise to a financial interest\nin the public official.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, suppose somebody had\nmade extensive independent expenditures in support of\nthe -- the public officer's prior campaign, and the\npublic officer may hope that they -- similar\nexpenditures will be made in the future. Would that be\na basis?\nMR. ELWOOD: I don't think it would be a\nbasis under the Nevada law. Because that's a law -\nJUSTICE ALITO: Why not?\nMR. ELWOOD: Because it's not a -- it's not\na personal relationship, it's not household, it's not\nrelative, it's not employer, and it's not a business\nrelationship.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Is there a way to get\nadvice as to -- I think you said he went to the county\nattorney, he could have gone to -- to the ethics\ncommission, and they were told ethics commissions can\ngive advice only after the -- is in office, they don't\ngive -- they are not obliged to give advice to\ncandidates. So when Carrigan is running he apparently\nhas no access to the ethics commission?\nMR. ELWOOD: I think that that's right. The\nethics commission only has authority to give opinions to\nsitting candidates.\nIf there are no further questions -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
