RASHKIND\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. RASHKIND: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nWe confront today the Eleventh Circuit's\ncategorical and jurisdictional prohibition of rule 60(b)\nin habeas corpus cases absent fraud. That is a rule that\nhas been rejected by nearly all of the other circuits and,\nin fact, has been rejected by the United States in its\namicus brief filed in this case.\nWe urge the Court to adopt instead the approach\nof the other nine circuits that have commented on this\nissue, the functional approach, in which a court is deemed\nto examine each motion individually to determine whether\nor not the motion comports with both rule 60(b) and AEDPA.\nI think the test we proposed here is a fairly\nsimple one, although I'm not sure in the briefing it comes\nacross as being as simple as it really is, but the test we\nare proposing, as opposed to the test proposed by the\nUnited States, is the one being used in nearly all of the\nother circuits and it has percolated through the system as\none that seems to work very well. It's a two-part test\nand it's very simple I think.\nFirst, does the motion that's filed challenge\nthe Federal judgment on a ground cognizable under one of\nthe six prongs of rule 60(b)? If not, if it's really a\nnew claim, if it is not within one of the six prongs of\nrule 60(b), then simply the district court denies it.\nIf, on the other hand, the motion is a true\n60(b) motion, as ours was in this case, then the court\ngoes to step two, which is to examine which is the six\nprongs is implicated, what is the jurisprudence regarding\nthe six -- that particular prong, and how would it apply\nin this particular case. That's the functional approach\nthat most of the circuits have been using.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: At that point when the court\nmakes that examination under your rule and it comes to\npoint six --\nMR. RASHKIND: Yes.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- does it refer at any point\nor in any circumstance to AEDPA?\nMR. RASHKIND: It does not but -- but point six\nhas been cabined by jurisprudence. Although point six\nappears to be a wide-open door for any motion to be filed\nand granted, the courts, even before AEDPA, have treated\ncategory six as one that requires extraordinary\ncircumstances.\nWe have been able to quantify. Both an amicus\nwho filed on behalf of the petitioner and the United\nStates and the respondent have quantified the number of\ncases that have gone through the rule 60(b) process.\nThere have only been, since AEDPA was passed, 28\nsuccessful motions that we can quantify, that are\npublished in any way. And we would like to think, at\nleast, that if the State or the Federal Government thought\nthere was an inappropriate application, it would have been\nraised on appeal and we'd have that statistic. 28 in the\n9-year history of the statute means fewer than 3 per year\n-- or slightly more than 3 per year for the whole country,\na fraction for circuits.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, if we were to make\nclear that 60(b) is widely available, even category six,\ndon't you think -- and as a result the AEDPA restrictions\ndon't apply, don't you think that number would increase\nrather dramatically?\nMR. RASHKIND: I do not. And I do not because\nat this point apparently nine circuits are following the\nrule we propose, and so the statistics that both the\nrespondent that we bring to you are that small, are that\ninfinitesimal because the courts have always treated 60(b)\nas a last ditch, extraordinary circumstances required.\nOne can go through each of the six prongs and easily\nhypothesize examples that are appropriate, (b)(1),\n(b)(2) --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, there's no language in\ncategory six referring to extraordinary circumstances, any\nother reason justifying relief.\nMR. RASHKIND: The Court in the Ackermann\ndecision -- there were two early decisions construing\n60(b). The first was the Klapprott decision in which the\nCourt recognized that 60(b) is intended to correct the\nkind of errors that might occur that are important. The\nAckermann decision followed a year later and said,\nhowever, this is not a wide-open door. Extraordinary\ncircumstances are required.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: But it's still very\nvague.\nMR. RASHKIND: It is but it isn't. It's vague\nin terms of reading the simple rule, but it's not vague if\none considers the jurisprudence that surrounds the rule.\nOne cannot ignore a half-century of -- of decisions, which\nhave rejected 60(b)(6) and other 60(b) --\nJUSTICE BREYER: All that is true, but I think\nthat the court below and the other parties say -- almost\neverybody is on your side. However, they also note a\nproblem, and the problem is that given the very rigid\nstructure of AEDPA and the imagination of lawyers, that if\n60(b) hasn't proved an escape hatch for getting around the\nAEDPA restriction, it will, and that what the lawyers will\ndo is they will reconstruct what they'd like as a second\nhabeas and put it in the form of a 60(b).\nAnd so I can accept everything you say, but if\nthat in the back of my mind is a concern running around\nCongress in this way, what form of words could you put in\nto restrict 60(b) to its domain which is the domain in\nwhich it's been used so far?\nNow, the Criminal Justice Legal Foundation filed\na brief in which they tried to do that. I thought that\nwas a constructive effort. So what's your opinion --\nMR. RASHKIND: Well, I would --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- about how best to do that?\nMR. RASHKIND: I would prefer to rely upon the\nCourt's principles in this regard.\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, but that's --\nMR. RASHKIND: Rhines -- Rhines v. Weber is of\ngood help here. Rhines v. Weber, that the Court delivered\njust very recently, considered the interaction of a rule\nand of AEDPA, and I thought it very clearly set forth\nthree principles which work well within the test here.\nFirst, that there has to be good cause and good\ncause, of course, is clear in the jurisprudence here, that\nwe're talking about extraordinary circumstances, not a\nsimple legal error. In this case, for example, the\nextraordinary circumstance is that, for all intents and\npurposes, my client has been denied his first petition of\nright because the court foreclosed the issues erroneously.\nSo good cause is the first thing that I learned from\nRhines.\nSecondly, that there have to be potentially\nmeritorious underlying issues. Now, that's going to\nfilter out a lot of the cases because you can't come into\ncourt with another issue that might not be good, it\nmightn't be an unexhausted issue, it might be --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's pretty flabby.\nMR. RASHKIND: -- one procedurally defaulted.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's pretty flabby.\nPotentially meritorious? Not probably, potentially.\nMR. RASHKIND: Well, it is -- it is the\nterminology used in Rhines. And what I'm trying to do\nhere for the Court is to draw upon your own authority, the\nwords you've spoken, as opposed to the test proposed by\nthe Criminal Justice Foundation and by the United States,\nwhich are interesting tests but in no way depend upon the\nCourt's own jurisprudence. I'm trying to offer the Court\nits own tests that have worked.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: But this is going to\nbe taken up by some 800 district judges and a couple\nhundred appellate judges, and they're the ones who have\nthe final say in most of these cases just because we\ndecide so few.\nMR. RASHKIND: And I think that's why this test\nworks.\nThe third point would be that there be\ntimeliness.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, aren't we dealing here\nwith a time bar issue?\nMR. RASHKIND: We are.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: I mean, there -- there was\nnot a determination below, but an extraordinary amount of\ntime expired before the application was made. Why would\nthat count as some extraordinary circumstance? Why\nshouldn't the petitioner be stuck with the time bar? I\ndon't see how this fits even under your proposed rule.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I was going to ask the same\nquestion. It's about as pedestrian an issue as you could\nget. It comes up all the time. I mean, this is not a\ncosmic legal issue.\nMR. RASHKIND: It really isn't as pedestrian as\nit may have seemed. We underwent a change in the law, in\nAEDPA, that the Court has recognized is not fully clear.\nAnd so this was one provision the Court had to clarify in\nArtuz v. Bennett, and there was a very small number of\ncases. I think we totaled eight in which relief was\ngranted because district courts had incorrectly barred a\npetitioner from the first petition because it really\nwasn't a violation of -- of the statute of limitations.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Why -- why did Florida deny\nrelief in -- in the post-conviction? I mean, one reason\nthat looks like it might apply is that Florida had a 2-\nyear statute of limitations and this was brought up 14\nyears later.\nMR. RASHKIND: Well, it wasn't a 2-year statute\nof limitations, Your Honor. In fact, it was slightly\ndifferent from the Federal statute of limitations as well.\nThere is a provision that allows for newly discovered\nevidence to bypass the standard 2-year statute of\nlimitations, which by the way, the Florida statute of\nlimitations wasn't even adopted until well after my client\nwas convicted.\nAs you know, he says that he was told at his\nsentencing proceeding, you'll serve 13 years, thereabouts,\non a 99-year sentence, and that induced his plea of guilty\nin this case. And when 13 years came about, he inquired\nwhat's happening and they said, no, that's not going to\nhappen. You have a release date of 2057.\nAnd as I think the Court knows from its decision\nin Linz v. Mathis, Florida -- Florida statutes really\nchanged in that way. Gain time was reduced gradually and\nthen much more quickly so that someone who might have\nserved 13 years in 1982 is really looking at serving the\n99.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Are you saying that counsel\n-- what -- what he alleges counsel told him was, in fact,\naccurate at the time counsel said it, that somebody who\ngot a 99-year sentence wouldn't have to serve more than 13\nyears?\nMR. RASHKIND: To be clear -- and -- and I want\nto be clear about his allegation is -- because he does not\nspeak English -- that the interpreter told him this, and\nthis was not during a plea colloquy. This was during\ndiscussions between the lawyer and the client through an\ninterpreter in advance of the plea itself. And so his\nallegation has consistently been that that's what the\ninterpreter told him his lawyer said.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: But has that been\ndetermined --\nMR. RASHKIND: No.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- by some court? That's the\nallegation --\nMR. RASHKIND: Correct.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- pure and simple --\nMR. RASHKIND: Correct.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- yet to be determined.\nMR. RASHKIND: And it's never been.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: And so we have to know how\nthe time bar element folds in here, and in an ordinary\ncivil case, a time bar would be an adjudication on the\nmerits. I mean, that -- that would end the case, and why\nwould it be a different, more liberal rule in habeas?\nMR. RASHKIND: It is because that's the way the\nCourt has treated the rule. The Court has always --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But you're -- you're saying it\nis extraordinary.\nMR. RASHKIND: In a different sense I'm saying\nit. In terms of computing whether a time bar is on the\nmerits, the Court has not used that concept, which does\nrelate to some sort of civil proceedings. Plaut would\nmake it appear first to money judgment type cases. But\nthe Court has not used that standard, for example, in\nMartinez-Villareal, has not used it in Slack v. McDaniel.\nInstead, the Court has not looked at the\nnomenclature of the order that dismissed the case or\ndenied this case. Instead, the Court looks to did the --\nthe court below address the claims of the petitioner. And\nof course, a claim of statute of limitations is not a\nclaim of a petitioner. That's an affirmative defense of\nthe State.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. Counsel, what -- that --\nthat brings me to a question that I don't understand about\nyour argument. It seems to me you're biting off more than\nyou have to bite off here. Would you win on the following\nargument? And I will tell you in advance that it looks to\nme as though you would. But maybe there's some reason\nyou're not making it.\nNumber one, your statute of limitations claim is\nnot the kind of claim that AEDPA is concerned with when it\ndeals with limits on second and successive petitions.\nNumber two, although a statute of limitations\nissue is on the merits, it is not on the merits in the\nsecond or successive petition category. In this case, you\ndon't have to worry about making a -- an -- an AEDPA end\nrun so far as second or successive goes, and therefore,\n60(b) can be used simply not as a wide-open door, but as a\ndoor that could be opened when your claim is a claim about\na rule that barred you from getting into Federal court,\nwhich is what the statute of limitations rule does.\nThat's all you're asking for.\nMR. RASHKIND: That's right.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And finally, you have an\nextraordinary situation here because you have a later\ndetermination in Artuz which declared the law not as a\nchange in the law, but as what the law presumably meant\nfrom day one.\nAs I understand it, if we accepted that\nargument, you would win. Do you agree?\nMR. RASHKIND: Yes, sir.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Then why don't you make that\nargument?\nMR. RASHKIND: I do make that argument, and to\nthe extent -- and -- and I make that argument, but that\nargument was rejected in the court below which addressed\nit with a completely different approach. And so I begin\nin this Court by having to address where I was in the\nEleventh Circuit Court of Appeals.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Can you go back to the\ndistrict court before the Eleventh Circuit? You've now\ntold me that the ground on which the Florida court denied\nrelief was not based on the statute of limitations.\nRight?\nMR. RASHKIND: Correct.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: In the Federal court, what is\nthe ground on which relief was denied and how would Artuz\naffect that decision?\nMR. RASHKIND: In the Federal court, the\ndistrict judge said that the tolling provision would not\napply here because it was the district court's\ndetermination that it was untimely when filed in the State\ncourt. That was not, however, the position of the Florida\ncourts.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, but your -- your immediate\nconcern is how do I get into a Federal court. Whether you\nwin or lose once you get in there is another problem, but\nI -- as I understand it, that's not what we're dealing\nwith here. And -- and the -- you -- you were kept out of\nthe district court on a statute of limitations issue. If\nyou can say -- if you argue all I've got in front of you,\nus, is a statute of limitations issue, that's all I want\nunder -- to raise under 60(b) and I have an extraordinary\nclaim here because of the subsequent Artuz decision, that\nwill get you into Federal court, if we accept that\nargument. Whether -- whether you win or lose, once you\nget there, I don't know, and I don't know that that's\nbefore us.\nMR. RASHKIND: And it is not clear. I wish it\nwere because that's precisely what my pro se client wrote\nin his rule 60(b) motion. He said I have been denied my\nright to a first petition because of an incorrect\ndetermination on the statute of limitations, that the\nArtuz decision makes clear that I was entitled to a\ntolling period that I was not awarded, and I would like\nthe judgment modified or reopened. And that's as clear as\na pro se litigant can make that claim. That's what the\nclaim has been from the very beginning, long before I was\never his counsel.\nJUSTICE BREYER: You -- you had a question.\nRemember my -- you were giving me the three principles to\nprevent the end run.\nMR. RASHKIND: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And the first was good cause.\nThe second was potentially meritorious underlying issues,\nand the third is?\nMR. RASHKIND: No indication of dilatory tactics\nby the plaintiff.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Thank you.\nMR. RASHKIND: And this is very helpful I think\nbecause it gives those three rules, which the Court has\ngiven us in Rhines, helped us and helped the district\ncourt to sort out the things that shouldn't be stopping or\nreopening proceedings.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May -- may I ask you a\nquestion that may be a little bit collateral? There was\ndisagreement on the court of appeals, as I remember it, as\nto whether or not a COA requirement applies to a denial of\na 60(b) motion. What is your view on that issue?\nMR. RASHKIND: Well, I actually argued and I do\nbelieve that it shouldn't require a COA. And the reason\nis because -- part of the reason is because this case\nbegan before Slack v. McDaniel and continued after. And I\nthink that's where Judge Tjoflat's opinion came from. How\ncan someone whose case is dismissed procedurally ever get\na COA? It's impossible because there's never going to be\na constitutional issue. By virtue of the procedural\nruling, the constitutional was not addressed.\nAnd Judge Tjoflat continued that dissenting\nposition through the en banc decision, and I share the\nview that it is virtually impossible, if not completely\nimpossible, in the typical case of a procedural resolution\nof the case, to ever get a COA.\nIn this case, majority would point to the\nfact the my client did receive a certificate of\nappealability, but I don't think there are many others who\nwill every get it because the question presented was, is a\nrule 60(b) still viable post AEDPA? And that question\nwon't recur, certainly not after the Court rules here.\nAnd I think the very genuine concern that Judge Tjoflat\nhad was and that he -- that he articulated is it's\nvirtually impossible to get appellate review.\nOne of the things we know about habeas corpus\nis --\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Well, we're not\ntalking about ordinary appellate review. We're talking\nabout an appeal from an adverse decision by a Federal\nhabeas court.\nMR. RASHKIND: Correct.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: So that isn't quite\nas strange as you make it sound.\nMR. RASHKIND: It is for this reason, Mr. Chief\nJustice. Before, you could file successive applications.\nIn the early days of habeas corpus, you could file\nsuccessive applications. And the reason given was there\nwas no appeal. And so you could go from one judge to the\nnext judge because there were no appeals. Then, of\ncourse, we had appeals, and the reason for having\nsuccessive petitions would diminish.\nBut what has happened to the appeal in a habeas\ncorpus case is it has become so constrained that in many\nrespects it doesn't exist, and that's what happened here.\nHere's my client who faces a situation in which he has\nclearly been thrown out of court improperly, and he goes\nto the court of appeals to have that decision reviewed and\ncan't get past the gateway of the certificate of\nappealability. And so he has no opportunity to really\nhave an appellate review. He has none.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Well, but maybe that's\nwhat Congress wanted.\nMR. RASHKIND: I don't think Congress did intend\nthat. When we looked --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: But why isn't that always the\ncase if it's time-barred?\nMR. RASHKIND: If it is time --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: If it's time-barred, you\nnever have your chance to have the merits argued.\nMR. RASHKIND: Well, that's one of the ways in\nwhich a case could be dismissed procedurally, but it's not\ntime-barred if the court rules it was erroneously. And\nthat's the concern that I think my client has here.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: But at what point do we bring\nthis all to a halt? I mean, there's always one more argument\nto make that the last court to rule against me was wrong.\nMR. RASHKIND: One of the nice things about rule\n60(b) is it really is a disciplined approach to a court\nexamining its own mistakes. It isn't a wide-open door in\nany respect. It is a disciplined approach. There are six\nspecific grounds, and even though the sixth one looks like\nit's wide-open, it certainly isn't under the jurisprudence\nof the Court.\nAnd so what this does is provide a very\nimportant opportunity for a judge to be able to look at an\nintervening decision from the Supreme Court of the United\nStates and say, I have denied this person what Congress\nwanted them to have. There's no question. One reads\nAEDPA and one thing is very clear. They -- Congress\nintended for a person who has exhausted claims, not\nprocedurally defaulted them in State court, and has filed\na timely petition, that person under 2254 is entitled to\nhave the claim entertained. And when a court makes a\nmistake, a procedural mistake, that forgoes or eliminates\nthe opportunity for review, and that's barely reviewable on\nappeal, depending on how the certificate of appealability\nmay be phrased -- and often these folks are pro se -- I\nthink what happens is 2254 has failed and what Congress\nintended to happen isn't going to happen. The person was\nentitled to one petition, one bite at the apple and never\nreceives that bite at the apple.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, now, the Federal\nGovernment has a different proposed rule than yours. Are\nyou going to comment on their proposal?\nMR. RASHKIND: I will. With due deference to my\ncolleagues, it's 177 words long, over two pages. And\nthat's why I thought that the approach that we brought to\nthe Court from the other nine circuits is a simpler --\nwhat I would call a simple two-step.\nTheir approach actually can be read, as we did\nin our reply brief, to fit within our own rule, but I\nthink the problem with the Government's rule is it is so\nbroad and it does not rely upon any of the Court's\nprecedents in -- in its writing. And so what you do, if\nyou adopt a rule like that, first of all, is create\nconfusion. And secondly, what you do is you make a whole\nnew set of rules that are separate and apart from what you\n-- the Court has previously done in its AEDPA\njurisprudence.\nTo be able to touch upon Slack v. McDaniel, to\nbe able to draw upon Martinez-Villareal, to be able to\ntake from Rhines v. Weber, create a formula and a package\nthat's familiar to the courts, to take a rule that's 177\nwords long that the Government puts together that I\ninterpret as being favorable to my client and they\ninterpret as being unfavorable to my client, I think just\nputs the kind of difficulty in the courts that this case\nshould try to avoid.\nSo my comment on it is that it may well, if it's\nread as we did in our reply brief, be the same thing that\nwe're saying and what I refer to as a simple two-step\ntest. And if not, it's just going to be a source of great\nconfusion.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What about the -- you -- you\nsaid 60(b) fits this like a glove because it's the\ndistrict court correcting its own errors. But it isn't\nusually -- 60(b) was framed with the idea of the district\ncourt being the very first instance court. And here you\nwill have the district court as the third going up the\nladder. So -- and -- and given that the habeas rules say\nthat -- that civil rules are applicable but have to be\nmodified to be compatible with habeas jurisdiction.\nMR. RASHKIND: I think it's very important to\nrealize that both rule 81 of the Federal Rules of Civil\nProcedure and rule 11 of the rules of habeas procedure,\nwhich the State would have us use as a constraint, really\nare the first things that tell us that there's supposed to\nbe a functional approach. Both of those rules tell us\nthat the rules apply to the extent that they're\ncompatible, and so that's certainly not a categorical\napproach. That is a functional approach.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But the -- the Government, by\nthe way, seems a broader rule than yours. The only thing\nit rules out is new legal claims or new evidence. I don't\nsee anything in your -- tell me if I'm wrong, but I don't\nsee anywhere where you say we should be able to bring a\n60(b) motion based on new legal claims or new evidence.\nMR. RASHKIND: New legal -- this is the part\nthat I think we have to look both at 60(b) and the\nstatute. New claims -- new claims -- are brought under\n2244(b)(2). Same claims are either going to be barred by\n(b)(1) or, if heard at all, under 60(b).\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's what I said. I don't\nsee how the Government hurts you. I think -- I think if\nyou the Government's, you're even better off.\nMR. RASHKIND: Well, I think that they're --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I mean, it's even -- but I want\nto know why -- why -- there's some reason you don't like\nthe Government, and -- and -- other than fact that they\nmust hurt you in some way. I don't see how it hurts you.\nMR. RASHKIND: Well, I don't think it does, but\nthey do. So that troubles me.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- make us --\nMR. RASHKIND: They make an argument that under\ntheir test, my client should not prevail. I can make an\nargument under our test my client prevails.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And under their test too, you\nsay it's applying the same rule of -- it's not a new\nclaim. It's the same claim as -- as -- just that they --\nshows that the district judge got it wrong.\nMR. RASHKIND: I think the heart of the\nGovernment's position is it requires a much more radical\ndeparture from general procedure than a simple change of\nlaw. But I don't think it's a simple change of law, for\nexample, when it is an intervening decision that\ninterprets a statute that was in effect and that the\nmistake of not interpreting correctly is to effectively\nbar the first bite at the habeas apple.\nNow, the Government does not give that ground in\ntheir test, and I think it's important that the Court\nleave that door open. And that's why I think our test is\nbetter and theirs in inadequate.\nI think ultimately we come down to three issues\nthat support the position that we're taking. Chief Judge\nEdmonson made note of this in his concurring and\ndissenting opinion. He was troubled that we were not\ngiving effect to both laws that Congress had approved,\n60(b) and AEDPA. By virtue of the majority rule, 60(b)\nhad been categorically eliminated. And I think the\nposition we take before the Court today is that the Court\nshould honor both provisions that Congress has adopted.\nMay I reserve the balance of my time?\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Very well, Mr.\nRashkind.\nMR. RASHKIND: Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Mr. Kise, we'll hear\nfrom you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF CHRISTOPHER M. KISE\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. KISE: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may\nit please the Court:\nThis case presents a fundamental inconsistency\nto this Court. Congress said through AEDPA that a habeas\npetitioner is to take all their claims, put them in one\nbasket, bring them to court within 1 year, and a sovereign\nState is going to defend that judgment in Federal court\none time. Rule 60(b) says, petitioner, use as many\nbaskets as you need, take as long as you like, and the\nState, you're going to have to keep coming back over and\nover and over again.\nAnd this case here presents that -- that very\nproblem.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Isn't that an exaggeration of\nhow 60(b) works in practice? It isn't that every civil\njudgment can come back and back again with 60(b) motions.\nThe district courts have been rather disciplined in\nhandling 60(b) motions. So I think you have exaggerated\nwhat 60(b) does in the ordinary civil rules context.\nMR. KISE: Well, respectfully, Justice Ginsburg,\nI -- I would disagree with that in this sense. I would\ndisagree with it in the sense that as Justice O'Connor\npointed out, if this Court were to open that door, I think\nyou would see that sort of abuse. I think you would see\nthat sort of manipulation of the process. I think you\nwould see that sort of --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But have we seen it in the --\nthere are other circuits who do adopt that rule, aren't\nthere? And have we seen the abuse you're describing?\nMR. KISE: We have not yet, but I would submit\nto Your Honor that that is because there is still this\nuncertainty because this case is here before this Court,\nand -- and because this has not yet been approved. If\nthis is approved by this Court, then you're going to see\nsovereign States like Florida dragged back in here nearly\n25 years later --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, that depends --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I had the same comment\nor the same reaction as Justice Ginsburg. Forget about\nthe habeas area. Just in -- with general civil judgments,\nhave there been Law Review articles saying that rule 60(b)\nundermines finality? People kept going back, back, and\nback. I -- I thought quite the opposite, that we were\nliving very well with rule 60(b).\nMR. KISE: Well, in -- in the ordinary civil\ncontext, that's perhaps correct, Your Honor, but -- but\nthis isn't the ordinary civil context. This is the habeas\ncontext. And Congress has said that this is the structure\nthat we want to take. This is the rule that we want to\ntake. And as this Court has recognized that -- that AEDPA\nwas passed with -- with this enduring respect for\nfinality, this respect for the sovereignty of States.\nState, you're only going to have to come back here one\ntime. You're only supposed to litigate one time, one --\nall the claims in one basket. They're brought within 1\nyear, and the State is to defend its judgment one time\nbecause --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. But his -- his whole\nargument is you, State, get exactly what you're entitled\nto if I win on 60(b) because what I was entitled to and\nwhat you were entitled to was the 1-year statute but\nsubject to the rule in Artuz. That's all you get, State.\nAnd what he is saying is, I want to get back into court so\nthat I can have the statute of limitations -- the benefit\nof the statute of limitations as Artuz construed it. That\nmeans you, State, get what you want and I get my one\nchance. How is that an open door to the abuse that you're\ntalking about?\nMR. KISE: Well, Your Honor, again, there --\nthere has to be some finality to the process, and -- and\nhere what the petitioner got was at the time a\nperceptively correct view of the law.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: He got what Artuz said was an\nerroneous view of the statute of limitations.\nMR. KISE: 2 years after the district judge made\nhis ruling in this particular case. And it -- it was in\nthis particular case 2 years. It could be 10 years. It\ncould be 15 years, and that's the problem that we see is\nthat if --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And do you -- do you think that\nthere is -- that there is this -- this sort of tidal wave\nof -- of erroneous statute of limitations determinations\nthat, if Artuz is applied, will suddenly be coming 5, 10,\nand 20 years into Federal court? I mean, it -- it -- your\nargument, in relation to his particular claim seems\nexaggerated.\nMR. KISE: Well, Your Honor, it's not\nexaggerated when you look at it from the standpoint that\n-- that Congress intended us to be in court one time to\ndefend this judgment in Federal court. We were there. He\nreceived a --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: You -- you were there for the\npurpose of getting him booted out. I mean, you didn't --\nyou didn't get into the merits of anything.\nMR. KISE: Well, he received a -- a final\ndisposition on the non-technical procedural basis which\nwas the applicable law at the time. He received that\nadjudication and --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, it was not the\napplicable law at the time. The decision related back to\nbefore that hearing.\nMR. KISE: Well, Your Honor, then that would,\nrespectfully, eviscerate any -- any notion of -- of the\nstatute of limitations --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: No. Sometimes there are law-\nchanging decisions, but this was not a law-changing\ndecision. It's a decision interpreting what the law was\nfrom the date of its enactment.\nMR. KISE: But based on that, Your Honor, then\nthere would be no statute of limitations. If -- if that\ndecision came out 10 years from now, we would then be back\nin this Court on a 60(b) motion, which I would submit is\nfundamentally inconsistent with what Congress intended.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: If there had been an Artuz\nviolation and not every statute of limitations\ndetermination implicates Artuz.\nMR. KISE: That's correct, Your Honor. But at\nthe same time, there may be some other mistake or some\nother excusable neglect or some other issue that comes up.\nI mean, what Congress intended to prevent is not\njust the successful filing of a 60(b) or the successful\nrevisiting, if you will, of the judgment. It -- it\nintended to prevent the actual attempt itself. I mean,\nthe idea is -- is that once this judgment is adjudicated,\nonce we've had this adjudication, you are not to come\nback. You are not to --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, what -- what Congress was\nprincipally concerned with -- Congress was concerned with\ntwo things. It was concerned with second and successive.\nThat's not what is before us. Congress was also concerned\nwith a 1-year statute of limitations. What is before us\non that point is that this guy did not get the benefit of\nthe statute of limitations that he had a right to get the\nbenefit of, that there was a flat mistake of law. So by\n-- by recognizing his statute of limitations claim, we do\nnot open the door to second and successive litigation. We\nopen the door simply to Artuz problems on statute of\nlimitations rulings and that's a pretty narrow category it\nseems to me.\nMR. KISE: But I would -- I would respectfully\ndisagree with Your Honor's premise that -- that he -- he's\nnot seeking to revisit an adjudicated petition. He did --\nhe is seeking, as -- as we see it, to --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Sure. Sure, he does. And if\nit's second and successive, he's going to get thrown out\nagain.\nMR. KISE: And we would submit that it is second\nand successive because it's seeking to revisit that\nadjudication, an adjudication that was had on a non-\ntechnical procedural basis.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So that's the --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: You may -- you may be right,\nbut that's what district courts are there for.\nMR. KISE: But -- but the Congress intended to\ntake that discretion away from the district courts.\n2244(b)(1) says you will not look at it again, and\n2244(b)(3) says, in fact, that when you do go back to\npotentially revisit an issue, when you do go back to\npotentially look at a second or successive, that it's not\neven the same district judge that makes that\ndetermination. As in 60(b), you go back to the same\njudge. 2244(b)(3) says, no, a three-judge panel of a\ncircuit court of appeals must first determine whether or\nnot you even have a right to get in --\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's also true of (b)(3).\nMR. KISE: Yes, Your Honor --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And not even the Eleventh\nCircuit said (b)(3). And therefore, you want to say\nabsolute, or are we really talking about which 60(b)\nmotions escape the strictures of AEDPA?\nMR. KISE: Well, I -- I think we're talking\nabout which 60(b)(3) motions -- or 60(b) motions do escape\nthe strictures of AEDPA.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And you're prepared to defend\nthe -- the Eleventh Circuit.\nMR. KISE: I -- I am , Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Correct, though you're alone on\nthat because even the Government doesn't and nor does the\ncriminal justice.\nBut if you're prepared to defend them, I guess\nyou'd say why is it that they will allow (b)(3), fraud on\nthe court by the adverse party, to escape, but should your\nown witness turn out to have been committing his own fraud\nfor whatever set of reasons, you can't.\nMR. KISE: Well, I would -- I would say why\nfraud -- to answer your question, Your Honor, why fraud --\nlet me back up first to the premise that -- that our\nposition and the Government's position are that far apart.\nI would respectfully say that -- that we are not that far\napart. I do not see that much light between the\npositions, although I know their brief leaves some room --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, under I guess the\nGovernment, you can bring everything under 60(b). By the\nway, if they do bring a motion to reopen under 60(b)\nbecause of change of law, they're almost bound to lose.\nThere are hardly any cases which find that an adequate\nground under 60(b).\nBut they let you do anything under 60(b), I take\nit, as long as the claims presented do not -- as long as\nthey are not trying to obtain relief on the basis of new\nlegal claims or new evidence.\nNow, I just noticed there's another one here.\nDo not support habeas relief. Maybe that's the problem.\nMR. KISE: Perhaps I --\nJUSTICE BREYER: You explain. I -- I thought\nwhen I first read this, that this was quite broad, but I\nmay not have read it perfectly.\nMR. KISE: Well, and I don't want to pretend to\nspeak for the United States because -- because that --\nthat might cause me to misspeak.\nBut to answer your question about why fraud is\ndifferent, I -- I have three bases for why fraud is\ndifferent and why we think that that exception is the\nright exception.\nOne, this Court has said in the past that fraud\nis different than other things. In the Hazel case that's\ncited in Calderon, this Court has said that tampering with\nthe administration of justice through fraud involves more\nthan an injury to a single litigant. It is a wrong\nagainst the very institutions designed to safeguard the\npublic, institutions that cannot tolerate fraud.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So is that also true if his own\nwitness has committed the fraud?\nMR. KISE: Well, I -- I would -- our fraud\nexception that -- that we -- we are delineating here is\nmaterial, intentional conduct that subverts the process.\nAnd it can't be just anyone, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes.\nMR. KISE: It needs to be someone in a position\nto subvert the process for -- for a purpose like the\nGovernment or the court if you -- if -- a judge that's\nbeen bribed in the unusual example of that, or -- or the\n-- the subornation of perjury in the Hazel sense. Those\nexamples -- that would be fraud that I think is what this\nCourt was talking about in Hazel --\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: What about a claim\nthat a witness perjured himself, a witness for the\ngovernment, during trial?\nMR. KISE: Well, a witness for -- a -- a claim\nthat a witness for the government perjured himself during\nthe trial would certainly implicate material, intentional\nconduct designed to subvert the process. And one of the\nadvantages to using fraud is -- is that it is a familiar\nbright line, workable standard for district courts. And\nwith fraud, you have to plead a little bit more\nparticularly, and so you would avoid in some respects some\nof the question marks that would come up --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And all I'm saying is exactly\nwhatever criteria is met, that it happens to be his own\nwitness, and sometimes your own witnesses do have their\nlittle games, you know, with prisoners, and so it's the\nsame thing.\nMR. KISE: Well --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Does that not count too?\nMR. KISE: Well, Your Honor, I think that would\nleave so much room for mischief, it would not be possible\nto contain the potential for -- for abuse. I mean, if\nevery jailhouse snitch were -- were subject to -- to the\n-- the 60(b) exception that we're -- we're articulating\nhere, if every -- every petitioner could simply say, well,\nmy own witness that I put up on the stand -- that -- that\nwitness perjured himself or herself, then -- then the\nopportunity for mischief would abound, and we would be\nback in the same position that we would be in general with\n-- with States having to respond again.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Kise, this may be\nimportant. Do you agree with Mr. Rashkind that in the\nFlorida court the dismissal or the denial of relief was\nnot on the Florida statute of limitations --\nMR. KISE: No, Your Honor. We -- we would\nsubmit that it is on the statute of limitations, that --\nthat rule 3.850 provided the petitioner with 2 years\nwithin which to apply, and both of his petitions were\ndismissed on statute of limitations grounds. And I don't\nknow that that matters --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But it's not -- not clear\nfrom --\nMR. KISE: -- to the end result here, but -- but\nthat -- that's our position.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: That's not what the -- this\nis -- the -- the form of dismissal in the Florida Supreme\nCourt doesn't tell us that. It just says something about\nallegations contained therein do not constitute legal\ngrounds for granting the new trial.\nMR. KISE: Your Honor may be referring to the\nsecond 3.850 dismissal, and that second 3.850 didn't meet\nthe requirements of the successive rule. There -- there\nwas a first --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The first one was on the\nstatute of limitations?\nMR. KISE: Yes, Your Honor, and then the second\none was also on the statute of limitations in addition to\nthe fact that it did not meet the requirements of -- of\nthe successive rule because it was essentially the same\nclaim raised again. He raised the same claim a second\ntime.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Do we have that anyplace at\n-- in the papers before us, the first -- the first\ndismissal in the Florida -- in the Florida trial court?\nMR. KISE: I'm not sure exactly where it is in\nthe appendix, Your Honor. Let me see. I -- I don't know\nthat we do. I know we have reference to it, but I don't\nknow that we have the actual language.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But you said --\nMR. KISE: It is -- it is in the Eleventh\nCircuit opinion, I believe, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- that it was based on the\nFlorida 2-year statute of limitations.\nMR. KISE: Yes. I believe -- when I said\nopinion, I'm sorry. The Eleventh Circuit record, Your\nHonor. It is in the Eleventh Circuit record, the -- the\ndecision of the Florida court. But it is not in the\nappendix before this Court.\nBut returning again to Justice Breyer, because I\ndon't think I finished my three reasons.\nThe first was because this Court said and says\nfraud is different.\nThe second is because there never was a first\nreview in that sense. I mean, they never obtained the\nfirst review that they -- they were seeking.\nAnd the third is -- is the State's finality\ninterest, which this Court has -- has recognized as -- as\nnear paramount under certain circumstances, must yield\nwhere you have the presence of fraud. And -- and so\nthat's why Florida maintains that this is the correct and\n-- and only exception. And -- and there are several\nreasons that we maintain that this is the correct and only\nexception.\nThe first and -- and most important, and -- and\nas I started this presentation, is that this is the only\nexception that preserves congressional intent.\nThe second is -- is that AEDPA and rule 60(b)\ncannot coexist except in very narrow circumstances because\nthey address the same subject matter in fundamentally\ndifferent ways.\nAnd the third is, as I mentioned before, because\nthe court --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But is it correct that they\naddress the same subject matter? Isn't 60(b) directed at\nthe integrity of the habeas proceeding, whereas AEDPA is\ndirected at the integrity of the original conviction?\nMR. KISE: Well, I -- I would respectfully\ndisagree with Your Honor because 2244(b)(1) does deal with\nthe -- the revisiting of the Federal habeas petition. The\n2244(b)(1) specifically applies to the revisitation of the\nFederal habeas petition. And in -- in terms of how they\ndeal with the same subject matter in different ways, as I\nbegan, AEDPA's whole purpose is to provide one basket of\nclaims within 1 year so the State has to defend one time,\nand 60(b) allows for the potential -- and -- and I would\nsubmit to you more than just the potential if this Court\nwere to approve a standard -- for -- for repetitive\nclaims, many baskets, many -- many years, and -- and many\ntimes that the State has to come back.\nAnd as I say, in this case the -- the principle\nof finality is all but abolished in this case and all be\neviscerated simply by the fact that nearly 25 years later\nFlorida is still in this Court defending this judgment\nthat was based on a guilty plea, not even a -- a\nconviction. And -- and as this Court recognized, albeit\nnot as part of the holding, but -- but mentioned in -- in\nCalderon with respect to the enduring respect for\nfinality, this is something that has survived both direct\nand post-conviction review in the State court system.\nI mean, this is -- this is Federal review of a\nsovereign State's determination as to the application of\nits criminal laws, and Congress has made a policy\ndetermination that -- that that Federal review must be\nlimited because State -- State exercise of its -- of its\npolice power and -- and the enforcement of its judgments\nis something that needs to be respected.\nAnd Congress -- because the power to grant\nhabeas is given by written law, Congress has the power to\nmake that policy determination. And while the petitioner\nargues that 60(b) somehow strikes a balance, I would\nsubmit to this Court that Congress has already struck that\nbalance. Congress has already made that determination.\nThere isn't another balance to be struck by the use of\n60(b), but that a balance has already been struck by\nCongress and Congress has made a determination that in\nmost circumstances finality is going to trump.\nAnd this isn't a perfect system. There are\ngoing to be exceptions with any bright line rule. With\nany bright line rule that this Court has ever carved\nout --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Didn't Congress rule -- rule\nout 60(b) in -- in death cases?\nMR. KISE: I'm sorry, Your Honor. Specifically\nrule out 60(b) --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, yes.\nMR. KISE: -- in -- in capital cases.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes.\nMR. KISE: I don't know -- under the statute?\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes. I may be wrong about\nhaving --\nMR. KISE: I'm not certain. We -- we're\nsubmitting that the Congress under -- under AEDPA ruled\nout 60(b) in all cases with the exception of -- of the\nfraud.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought there was a special\nprovision for capital cases.\nMR. KISE: I don't believe so, Your Honor.\nBut with respect to the bright line rule that --\nthat we submit is necessary to effectuate congressional\nintent, as I was saying, that it's not a perfect system.\nAnd the petitioner can come up with all manner of examples\nthat -- that seem to implicate various policy\ndeterminations about what should or should not happen in a\ngiven situation.\nBut -- but our position -- and we believe the\nposition of the Eleventh Circuit is -- is that Congress\nhas already weighed that now. Congress has already made\nthat determination. Congress has already told us where\nthe line is going to be drawn and it's going to be drawn\non the side of finality and it's going to be drawn on the\nside of respect for State sovereignty.\nAnd I would -- would also submit that -- that\nthe Sixth Circuit test and the functional equivalent\napproach test that's advanced by the petitioner ignores\nreally both the statute and it ignores reality. It\nignores the statute because AEDPA tells us you can't\nrevisit an adjudicated habeas petition unless there are\ncertain limited circumstances that are met. And it\nignores reality because the only reason to revisit a\nhabeas petition is to ultimately revisit the underlying\nState court judgment. And the only purpose for being\nthere is to ultimately get at that State court conviction\nthat is -- that is under siege.\nWith respect to the coexistence, the petitioner\nmade a point about this case is somehow like the Rhines\ncase that was decided recently by this Court. But in the\nRhines case, this Court was balancing the exhaustion\nrequirements with the statute of limitations provisions.\nHere there's nothing to balance. Here this is just simply\na prohibition. Congress says you cannot revisit except in\nthese isolated, limited circumstances. And so rule 81,\nhabeas rule 11, and this Court's decision in Pitchess all\nsay that 60(b) does not trump if the habeas statute holds\ndifferently.\nAnd finally, the courts do need a bright line\nthat's not subject to variance, as I mentioned earlier.\nThis is a workable standard. They're familiar with fraud.\nIt's well defined in the case law. It requires more\nparticularized pleading which makes less room for\nmischief, and it -- it gives the courts an easily\nidentifiable standard by which they can effectuate that\ncongressional policy, that congressional policy of one\nbasket of claims within 1 year and the State will come\ninto this Federal court one time to defend its sovereign\njudgment.\nIf there are no further questions, thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr. Kise.\nMs. Millett, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF PATRICIA A. MILLETT\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,\nAS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENT\nMS. MILLETT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nJustice Breyer, let me assure you that our\nposition is, if not as strict, only marginally less strict\nthan the State of Florida's.\nJUSTICE BREYER: On page 24, I read the or\nwrong.\nMS. MILLETT: Okay.\nJUSTICE BREYER: It's -- you meant the things on\nboth sides of the or.\nMS. MILLETT: It's very --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And I was thinking the first\nside you'd allow, the second side you wouldn't. But if\nit's very, very strict, which now I understand it, because\nI read the or correctly when I went back.\nMS. MILLETT: All right. I wanted to make\nsure --\nJUSTICE BREYER: My question would be why.\nMS. MILLETT: Yes. And -- and if you want a\nshorter statement -- I mean, a brief is a brief -- a short\nstatement of what our test is, Justice Breyer, it's quite\nsimple, and that is a rule 60(b) motion that seeks to set\naside a denial of habeas relief on the grounds that it was\nincorrectly decided is barred. That is the territory that\nAEDPA occupies. That includes, Justice Souter, not just\ndeterminations on the --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Would you say that again?\nMS. MILLETT: A rule 60(b) motion that seeks to\nset aside a final judgment denying Federal habeas relief\non the grounds that it was incorrectly decided is a second\nor successive petition under AEDPA. It can proceed only\nunder AEDPA's terms, which change not only the standards\nfor a second decision, but the decision-maker, the\ngatekeeper.\nJustice Souter --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Is that a statement of when\nit's not available? I want to be sure I -- are you\nstating it positively or negatively?\nMS. MILLETT: It --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: It is not available in the\ncircumstance you described. Right?\nMS. MILLETT: That's right. It is -- it is --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Now, would you state -- tell\nus when it is available?\nMS. MILLETT: Okay. The flip side of that, if I\ncan -- the -- the title of section 2244 is finality of\ndetermination. If you are seeking to upset a final\ndetermination, you are governed by 2244 not 60(b).\nIf you are not seeking to upset a final\ndetermination, let me give you the two -- the two\ncircumstances that come to mind right away.\nOne is the fraud exception recognized by the\ncourt of appeals, and there could be similar errors like\nthat -- and this is what we talk about in our brief -- that\nessentially vitiate the existence of a determination in\nthe first place. They are that profound and that\nrudimentary. Then you are not upsetting what our system\nrecognizes to be a determination and what Congress wanted\nyou to have.\nThe other exception is essentially 60(a),\nclerical -- you're not -- errors. You're not really\nupsetting anything. You're actually trying to implement\nor effectuate the actual ruling by the court of appeals.\nThe only gap -- I'm not sure it's a gap at all\nafter the argument here -- is that we don't limit it to\nfraud. We recognize that there are some other\nfoundational, rudimentary, fundamental errors that\nconceivably could occur. I'm not aware of them happening,\nbut something like a biased judge addressed by this Court\nin Toomey v. Ohio.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But now you're into -- I mean,\nyou can use a tone of voice. You know, it sounds very\nstrong. But I thought 60(b)(6) is weird things happen,\nand 60(b)(1) is there are all kinds of mistakes. You\nknow, some of them can just be accidental. The lawyer was\nhit by a trolley. And in fact, all of 60(b) is meant to\ncapture that kind of thing.\nSo it sounds like what you're saying is, sure,\nfollow 60(b), maybe not the evidentiary, maybe not the new\nevidence part, follow it, but be sure you do so strictly.\nAre you saying more than that?\nMS. MILLETT: I am saying a lot more than that,\nand that is, first of all, because the vast majority of\nthings that are covered by 60(b) do not qualify as\ntantamount to fraud or a biased judge.\nAnd -- and the second incredibly important thing\nis that Congress changed the decision-maker. Under 60(b),\nyou have 645 individual district court judges applying the\nhistoric equity power to -- to overturn final judgments.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Where -- where do you disagree\nwith Judge Carnes?\nMS. MILLETT: With Judge?\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: With -- with the majority of\n-- in -- in the Eleventh Circuit.\nMS. MILLETT: If that opinion is read -- and I\nthink fairly it has to be -- as saying only fraud and not\nerrors of similar magnitude like a biased judge or some\nother complete breakdown so that our system doesn't\nrecognize that to be a judgment -- it's not what Congress\nthought it was giving you -- then that would be -- I can't\ntell you there's cases where this happens, but that -- but\nthe -- the rationale for including fraud would exclude --\ninclude some other similar errors of magnitude. That's\nour only --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Now, how do you apply it in\nthis case, the Artuz problem?\nMS. MILLETT: In -- in this case, the Artuz\nproblem is only an argument, and I -- we're not even\naccepting that it's accurate, but only an argument that\nthe court made a mistake of law. A mistake of law is not\na fundamental breakdown in our system. It does not mean\nthe court didn't act as a court. This Court reverses in\n-- or vacates in about 75 percent of its cases. It doesn't\nmean all the lower courts were not operating as courts as\nwe recognize them as at the same level of fraud. It's\nroutine to have mistakes of law --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, suppose Artuz had been\ndecided and it was in the mail and the judge forgot to\nopen his advance sheets that day. And so he goes back to\nhis office, says, oh, my God. You know, I mean, a weird\nthing like that. And of course, he says nobody has been\nhurt yet. I'll reopen it. Okay? Is that all right?\nMS. MILLETT: If he does it within 10 days under\nrule --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, it's 10 days and a half.\nMS. MILLETT: 10 --\n(Laughter.)\nMS. MILLETT: Then, Justice Breyer, the nature\nof lines is somebody falls on the other side sometimes.\nThere's an appeal process to deal with exactly that.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And the reason that it's\nhappened is because all the lawyers were hit by four\ntrolleys.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: I mean, you see what I'm doing?\nI'm simply trying to find cases that fit within the\nlanguage, but they're very weird and justice cries out for\na reopening. Now, that's what it seems to me one is\nabout. Two is about. Three doesn't really. Three you\nagree applies. Two may not apply. Three you agree\napplies. Four I think you probably agree applies or not\nat all. Five doesn't apply at all, and six is anything\nunder the sun.\nMS. MILLETT: Justice Breyer, the problem is --\nand -- and Justice Souter, you referenced this. There\nhave been many references to this, that 60(b) is not a\nproblem. It's already cabined out there. In fact, it's\nnot. It's abuse of discretion review in courts of\nappeals.\nWe cite a case, Hamilton v. Newland, from the\nNinth Circuit where they used 60(b)(6). The -- the\npetitioner filed his claims. They were clearly barred by\nthe statute of limitations, not an Artuz problem. So he\nsaid, all right, I'm going back to Federal court with a\n60(b)(6) claim. I'm actually innocent. That puts me in\n60(b)(6). I admit actual innocence. It's -- it's a very\nweak claim. I can't been get relief on it. But the\ndistrict court said, come on in. I'm going to decide your\nclaims.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, maybe --\nMS. MILLETT: And the -- and the --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- maybe the district court\nshouldn't have done that, but whatever -- whatever was\nwrong there, it was merely a classic application of -- of\nreview of a statute of limitations point. There -- there\nwas much else involved and maybe it was improper.\nMy question, I guess, is why do you say that the\n-- why do you assume that the policy animating applying\n60(b) to a gatekeeping issue like statute of limitations,\nwhere there is an unusual circumstance as in Artuz, should\nbe the same policy that animates applying 60(b), let's\nsay, when there is an attempt to -- to make an end run\naround the second and successive rules?\nThe latter I think we can all understand pretty\nreadily. I mean, it's very important. You've got the --\nthe -- AEDPA if you allow that.\nWith respect to this kind of a statute of\nlimitations problem, what the guy is asking for is what he\nwas entitled to under AEDPA as a matter of timing and\ngatekeeping. Why is the policy under 60(b) the same in\nthose two cases?\nMS. MILLETT: Justice Souter, there's two\nanswers to that. The first is that this won't be -- it\nwill be hard to limit this to a statute of limitations\nbecause the next argument is going to be procedural\ndefault, and the next argument is going to be\nmisapplication of Teague's non-retroactivity principle,\nand the next one is going to be mistake in applying\nadequate, independent State grounds.\nThe -- a bulk -- a huge percentage of Federal\ncourt decision-making in habeas cases is procedural rules\nbecause Federal habeas is not a roving commission for\nerror correction. You have to -- at -- in the same breath\nthat you establish a constitutional violation, you have to\nshow it's proper for Federal courts to act. Procedural\ndefault and statute of limitations are as much your job to\nshow to have Federal relief as it is to show that\nsomething went wrong under the Constitution. It's a --\nthere's a dual character to Federal habeas relief. So\nthis, in fact, is exactly part of the habeas -- this is\npart of the second or successive determinations that --\napplications that Congress wanted to bar.\nAnd we have to step back and think about what\nwould happen here. What we have is the State of Florida\ncoming up 23 years after a guilty plea not because to\ndefend -- once again, it's judgment. It's conviction not\nbecause of anything they did in the conduct of the trial,\nnot because the guy claims to be actually innocent, but\nbecause almost 2 decades after the plea, a Federal court\nallegedly made a mistake of law that wasn't cleared up\nthrough the appellate process. That's not the point of\nFederal habeas corpus. That's not what it's supposed to\nbe about.\nBut if we open the door, if we let the camel's\nnose in the tent, a camel is going to come behind it, and\nit's going to be procedural default, non-retroactivity of\nTeague, and all of the multiple other grounds on which\nFederal habeas decisions are made by courts.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Did the Federal court make a\nmistake of -- of law if the -- if the Florida court\ndismissed under the Florida 2-year statute of limitations?\nMS. MILLETT: Did -- did the Florida make a\nmistake of what --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: No, no. Did the Federal\ncourt. And suppose that the --\nMS. MILLETT: No. I guess -- I think this Court\nis going to tell us. I think the -- the Pace v.\nDiGuglielmo case that this Court heard -- I think it was\nlast month --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: It's sub judice, before us\nnow.\nMS. MILLETT: Right.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But do you agree with Mr.\nKise that the first dismissal in the Florida court, the\nfirst denial was on the Florida 2-year statute of\nlimitations?\nMS. MILLETT: My -- the order from the court, my\nunderstanding, simply denied it on the grounds of legal\ninsufficiency, and it didn't give a further explanation.\nIt doesn't say what exact grounds was, but if you look to\nwhat was argued by Florida, they were arguing on\ntimeliness.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Ms.\nMillett.\nMr. Rashkind, you have 4 minutes left.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL M. RASHKIND\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. RASHKIND: Thank you, Your Honor.\nIf I may begin by correcting what I think are\ntwo inadvertent mistakes, but important ones.\nJustice Ginsburg, in answer to your question\nabout the first State habeas, these are -- these documents\nare contained in -- in your record. They're noted at\njoint appendix 2-5.\nThe first State habeas was dismissed because it\nwas not notarized. That's the sole basis for its\ndismissal: it was not notarized.\nThe second one was brought and denied, and the\ncourt specifically notes, as we note in the yellow brief,\nfootnote 7 on page 12, it set forth the -- the court's\ngrounds. It says the motion does not state grounds for\nrelief.\nAt no point does Florida ever adopt the State's\nposition that either of the petitions was untimely. The\nState court addressed them directly on the merits.\nJustice Breyer, if I may, I can actually\nhypothesize several examples under subsection (5), of\nsubsection (4), and perhaps even subsection (2) of rule\n60(b), which would be permissible. For example, under\n(5), a judgment that should no longer have continuing\neffect might be that the district court entered an\nalternative writ of habeas corpus, tried the defendant\nwithin 60 days or 90 days, or set him free. And when\neveryone gets back to State court, it becomes plainly\napparent that can't be done within 60 days, and either the\nState or the defendant might go back and say, please,\namend that order out of time. It's a final order. Please\namend it to make it 180 days.\nWe can come up with examples, I think, for each\nof the provisions, and I think that's really what's\ninteresting about this rule. It is written in a way\nthat's durable against AEDPA, and it conforms nicely with\nAEDPA. And it does not take a lot of extra thought, it\ndoes not take a lot more than adopting the Court's\nprevious holdings for us to be able to make it workable\nwithin AEDPA.\nThe fact that this case is now in its 25th year\nis a result of law and not of delay. Mr. Gonzalez alleges\n-- and no one has ever been able to say otherwise because\nwe've never had a hearing -- that it took him 13 years to\nfind out about the newly discovered evidence. He\nexhausted his claims for 4 years. He was only in Federal\ncourt for 1 year before the State raised a bar, a statute\nof limitations bar, which turns out to be incorrect. In\nthe last 7 years, there's been litigation both in the\ncourt of appeals and now before this Court caused by the\nState's argument that the case should have been dismissed\non the statute of limitations.\nMy client is not responsible for the fact that\nit's the 25th year, but what we do know about this case is\nhe has approximately 76 years remaining on his 99-year\nsentence. And unless he gets one bite at the habeas\napple, he has not gotten what Congress directed he\nreceive. Congress made one thing clear in AEDPA, and I\nthink it's a good thing, and that is, if a defendant goes\nthrough and does what he's supposed to do in State court,\nhe does not procedurally default the issues, he exhausts\nfully, and he timely files a petition, that was the\ncandidate Congress wanted to have to get habeas review.\nIn this case Aurelio Gonzalez did all of those\nthings, and he sits on the outside, having been told you\nget no bite at the apple, it's too late. And that's just\nplain wrong. And there's something wrong about that, and\nthat's why there's rule 60(b).\n60(b) is nothing but a coalescence of many great\nwrits that were designed for one purpose and one purpose\nalone and that was to correct mistakes in extraordinary\ncircumstances. There can be no more extraordinary\ncircumstance than that a person is denied their right to\nhabeas review, and that's what's happened here. And we\nrespectfully submit that rule 60(b) is the only and best\ntool to remedy the error made within the discretion of the\ndistrict court, and we ask for that result.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr.\nRashkind.\n"
