CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument

Friction Products Corporation.
Mr. Frederick.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID C. FREDERICK
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. FREDERICK: Thank you, Mr. Chief
Justice, and may it please the Court:
Congress enacted the Locomotive Inspection
Act to ensure the safety of locomotives in use on
railroad lines, not to regulate hazards to mechanics
conducting repairs of locomotives.
The doctrine of implied --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, what do you -- what
do you make of the ICC in 1916, in the Tiller case,
regulating the lights that railroads had to have,
locomotives had to have in the yard, and that those
lights had to differ when the railroad was in use?
MR. FREDERICK: That was actually I think
pursuant to the Safety Appliance Act, Justice Sotomayor,
if I'm not -- if I'm not mistaken. And the principle
behind the safety in use regulation that this Court
construed in Napier was to ensure that locomotives were
safe for fit use on the line. And that was the
consistent construction both in the ICC's statement that
it made in 1922 and in this Court's post-Napier --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm not sure I
understand. It prescribed different lights when the --
when the locomotive was in the yard.
MR. FREDERICK: Yes.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That had nothing to do
with safety in use. It had to do with safety in repair.
MR. FREDERICK: Our position is that it was
not pursuant to the Locomotive Inspection Act that the
ICC promulgated that rule. As the Court has said in
numerous cases, the ICC had rules in place with respect
to different aspects of the train at different points in
time, but the Locomotive Inspection Act was designed to
address a very specific problem, which was boilers
exploding on the line when the train was in operation.
And that is the consistent way that the ICC, and
subsequently the Federal Railroad Administration, has
construed the Act.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Distinguish for me our
reasoning in the Ray case.
MR. FREDERICK: I'm sorry.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Distinguish for me the
difference in the Ray case, that had to do with
navigation and where we held that the agency, in
ensuring safety in navigation, controlled design
completely, whether in repair or not. So, how do we --
why don't we apply the logic of Ray to this case?
MR. FREDERICK: Well, of course in Ray you
addressed the Port and Tanker Safety Act, as well as the
Port and Waterway Safety Act. And in the United States
v. Locke case, the Court subsequently looked at Ray in
terms of design in a statute that also specifically
included the word "repair and maintenance," which is
absent here.
But what the Court was getting at in Ray was
to ensure that States were not using their law to
interfere with the design of equipment. Of course, that
was for --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's the argument
here, which is --
MR. FREDERICK: No.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- once you regulate
what -- what the design or use of asbestos is, you're
interfering with what available components there are for
locomotives.
MR. FREDERICK: If I could make two points
about that, Justice Sotomayor. That's not actually
correct. The first is anything that the Court might
think about design does not impair our failure-to-
warrant claims, which entail no challenge to the design
of a locomotive at all, only to the instructions for its
safe use. But to the --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, you're giving up all
of your other claims?
MR. FREDERICK: No. My second argument is
that the design claim here involves repair work or
problems uniquely; it does not include or intrude on the
fitness for service standard that this Court announced
in Napier or that has consistently been applied. The
asbestos harms that the repair workers here faced are
unique to the repair process, where they are scraping
off the --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but, counsel,
looking at Napier, the power that Justice Brandeis said
was conferred in that case was to specify the sort of
equipment to be used on locomotives, right?
MR. FREDERICK: Yes, but on --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, this is
equipment that was used in locomotives.
MR. FREDERICK: Yes, but, Mr. Chief Justice,
it also says on page 612 that the power delegated by
Congress is to determine fitness for service. So, the
words about the --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes, but that's the
same -- that's the same thing, I'll give you that,
fitness for service.
MR. FREDERICK: No, it's not --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It doesn't say
something that's going to cause harm while it's actually
being used.
MR. FREDERICK: But, Mr. Chief Justice, the
principle here is to ensure that the locomotives, when
they are outside the repair yard and are on the
locomotive -- on the railroad line, are -- are safe to
operate. That standard in Napier had --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why does it
depend -- you want to know if this equipment is safe to
operate, right? To be used, whether -- whether it's
going to be used. If you have a --
MR. FREDERICK: Not to be broken down.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If you have a boiler
that's going to be used, that's within the power that
was confirmed. It's not merely to inspect as, again,
Justice Brandeis said.
MR. FREDERICK: But the point here is that
it is not to be broken down. And the locomotive repair
workers here face unique hazards in repairing
locomotives whose safety standards are to ensure that
they work properly on the railroad line, not when
they're being taken apart and repaired. That they --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I guess your
argument isn't limited to being taken apart. Your
argument does depend on the fact that the asbestos
doesn't come out during use; right?
MR. FREDERICK: That's absolutely correct.
That's why this is --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, how do we know
that --
MR. FREDERICK: -- a unique hazard faced by
the repair workers.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes, but if there's
an accident or something, does the asbestos come out
during the use of the locomotive?
MR. FREDERICK: If it did, it would be
covered under the Locomotive Inspection Act safety
standard, and that would be covered by Federal law.
JUSTICE SCALIA: You -- you would say once
there's an accident and the locomotive is disabled, it's
no longer in use. I suppose that's what you'd say.
MR. FREDERICK: That's correct, and --
JUSTICE SCALIA: It's unrealistic, but
that's what you'd say.
MR. FREDERICK: No. Well, it's governed by
a different statute, which is found at 49 U.S.C. 303.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's the old
insurance cases we've had, that, you know, when the car,
you know, slams into a pole or something, it's not being
used as a car anymore; and, therefore, the insurance
doesn't cover it.
MR. FREDERICK: Well, if I could finish my
answer to your previous question, Mr. Chief Justice,
there's a specific statute on that point, and it
predated the Locomotive Inspection Act, and it provided
that when there was a crippled locomotive, the railroad
did not face liability, civil penalties, to bring the
crippled locomotive back to the yard, but it
specifically said if a worker was injured during that
process, the railroad would face liability.
Our point here is that the Locomotive
Inspection Act's field should be construed narrowly
because in 1970 Congress expressly and comprehensively
legislated in the Federal Rail Safety Act and provided a
conflict pre-emption regime in which if a State had a
rule in place, that rule would be permitted to survive
unless and until the Federal Rail Administration issued
a regulation. And there has never been a regulation on
asbestos.
JUSTICE BREYER: What I'm concerned about I
think is the same thing that the Chief Justice
mentioned, the particular language in Napier. And
whatever -- however this might come out today if Napier
were decided again, it did come out the way it did. And
Justice Brandeis did write it, and it's been the law a
long time.
And the argument is made in Napier that this
particular State regulation is aimed at preventing
sickness and disease, not at making locomotives safe,
and, therefore, it's not pre-empted. And the answer to
that was not sickness and disease are an object of the
statute, too. The answer was the Federal and the State
statutes are directed to the same subject, the equipment
of locomotives; and, therefore, it is pre-empted.
Now, how could we come out in your favor
without overturning what seems to be that key sentence
in Napier? That is the problem that's bothering me.
MR. FREDERICK: Well, first, I would urge
you not to read Napier like a statute, although Justice
Brandeis is obviously --
JUSTICE BREYER: I see. Okay. That's a --
the problem with (a) is that it's been followed and
followed and followed and followed, and really read for
all its worth, and so forth. So -- so one question is,
to what extent can I go back and revise that sentence?
That's (a). Okay? What's (b)?
MR. FREDERICK: (B) is that he was
addressing himself to fitness for service standards on
the line, the Wisconsin and Georgia statutes at issue
there purporting to regulate what the locomotive could
do while it was in operation on the line. That's not
what the claims in this case entail.
JUSTICE BREYER: Not -- now, is there any
way that you could win your case -- reasonably, in a
reasonable way, not some far-out way -- but you win your
case on this, and it does not affect the manufacturers'
way of dealing with their equipment?
MR. FREDERICK: Yes.
JUSTICE BREYER: What is that?
MR. FREDERICK: First is if you accept our
proposition that warning claims are valid negligence
claims. The warning claims are not -- do not affect the
equipment, how it is made at all. It's simply how do
you use the equipment safely.
Secondly, the design claims here go to the
unique hazards faced by repair workers. You could use
asbestos, under our theory of the case, on the
locomotive in exactly the same way that the locomotive
equipment manufacturers have done, so long as there's a
safer way to take the asbestos off the locomotive in the
repair yard.
That is a distinct kind of design claim that
doesn't go to the safe operation of the locomotive; it
goes to what hazards are created when a repair worker is
doing maintenance work on it.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm not sure I
understand this. Are you talking about wearing a
particular hazard suit?
MR. FREDERICK: That would be --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Are you talking about
blowing out air? Are you talking about changing the
design so the asbestos comes off without the dust cloud
that's generally created?
MR. FREDERICK: Both. The dust cloud is
something that can be warned against and protected
against with protective gear that has nothing to do with
the design of a locomotive. There are, and there is
evidence that there are, safer and were safer ways -- I
remind you that asbestos isn't used on locomotives
anymore, so this is part of an historical debate here --
but in ways that could be removed that would not create
the cloud dust. That's the essence of the design defect
claim. And the LIA and the FRA do not regulate in the
repair shop. So, there's a complete gap here in
terms --
JUSTICE KAGAN: Let me make sure I
understand you. Is -- if the Secretary tomorrow decided
to issue a regulation saying railroads should no longer
use these asbestos-containing brakes because of the
hazards in the repair shop, do you think the Secretary
could not do that under the statute?
MR. FREDERICK: No. Absolutely --
absolutely can do that under the Federal Rail Safety
Act, which, again, empowers the Secretary.
JUSTICE KAGAN: But the Secretary cannot do
that under LIA? Is that the idea?
MR. FREDERICK: It -- it very well could
because it's a fitness for service standard. But it
always -- and if you look at its regulations, in parts
229 and part 230 of 49 C.F.R., it always issues these
regulations under both authorities because the FRSA
expanded it.
JUSTICE KAGAN: Okay, then I'm a little bit
lost. If the Secretary can issue such a regulation
under LIA, L-I-A, then isn't it in the scope of
regulation, and then isn't it also in the scope of
what's pre-empted?
MR. FREDERICK: It would have to do so under
the B&O Railroad case in the early 1930s -- there was
another Justice Brandeis opinion -- in which it would
have to make a finding that to make that regulation that
you posit, Justice Kagan, was necessary to avoid
unnecessary peril to life or limb. In that case, the
Court struck down the ICC's attempt to issue a
regulation on a particular type of equipment because the
ICC could not make that demonstration.
So, in the current world, the FRA would
regulate under the FRSA; it would not regulate under the
LIA because under this Court's jurisprudence it is a
harder standard to meet to implement a regulatory
standard. That's our point.
The regulatory field here does not need to
be read as expansively as the other side posits, because
the FRA has all the authority it needs under the FRSA if
it chooses to promulgate those rules, and it has not
chosen to promulgate those rules. The FRA can use
conflict pre-emption to displace any State rule, but
what they are seeking to do is to take the doctrine of
implied field pre-emption, gain immunity from State law
liability, and not be subject to any Federal rules. And
it's that proposition that is an extraordinary
proposition of implied field pre-emption. We found no
case from this Court that goes that far.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Frederick, could
you -- could you clarify what is at stake for the worker
here? The railroad worker ordinarily has the FELA
claim, but the FELA claim in this case was dismissed.
So, can you tell us what recourse -- if you lose, what
recovery can this plaintiff get? And also explain to me
why the FELA claim was dismissed.
MR. FREDERICK: If we lose this case,
Justice Ginsburg, the decedent's family gets nothing,
takes nothing, because the FELA claim was rendered
summary judgment on the finding that there was no
negligence by the railroad. The only claim that the
decedent's family has here is a third-party claim
against the manufacturer for failing to warn or design
defect on the basis of State law.
JUSTICE BREYER: You just -- you just said
that, which I think you certainly have the right to
bring a claim, don't you, to say the repair shop doesn't
have adequate warnings. And if -- if that's -- if the
railroad's at fault in that, or the manufacturers or the
owner of the repair shop, everybody who ever puts the
asbestos in there is negligent in not putting up
adequate warnings.
What's wrong with that?
MR. FREDERICK: Well, here -- ordinarily,
you'd bring a failure-to-warn claim directly against the
manufacturer for not putting in the manual or stamping
on the equipment --
JUSTICE BREYER: What about -- what about
not --
MR. FREDERICK: -- or providing instructions
for safe use.
JUSTICE BREYER: What about getting away
from the equipment and saying the failure here is not to
fail to put it on the equipment; it's to fail to put it
in the repair shop?
MR. FREDERICK: It's both.
JUSTICE BREYER: There's something I'm not
seeing.
MR. FREDERICK: No. It's -- it's both.
Manufacturers routinely are held liable for failing to
warn if in their manuals or in their other instruction
materials they do not provide for instructions for the
safe use of their equipment.
If I could save the balance of my time.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,
Mr. Frederick.
Ms. Harrington.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF SARAH E. HARRINGTON
ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,
AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS
MS. HARRINGTON: Mr. Chief Justice, and may
it please the Court:
I think it's helpful in this case to try to
separate out the field pre-emption issues from the
conflict pre-emption issues. In the Government's view,
the only issue properly presented in this case is
whether Petitioners' tort claims fall within the field
pre-empted by the LIA, and our view is that they do not
because they arise from injuries that occurred when the
locomotive was not in use.
Now, Respondent would have the Court expand
the field that's pre-empted by the LIA to include any
claim that has anything to do with locomotive equipment,
regardless of whether the equipment or the locomotive
was in use at the time injury occurred.
But it doesn't make sense to --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Don't you think that one of
the purposes of the legislation, which everybody
understood, was to enable engine manufacturers to be
able to construct their engines without having to worry
about a variety of different State requirements?
Railroading is a national transportation industry, and
whoever makes the engine has to know, if I do it this
way, it's going to be okay.
MS. HARRINGTON: Absolutely.
JUSTICE SCALIA: And you're saying it won't
be okay because, although every State may have -- every
State's requirements may be pre-empted when the -- when
the locomotive is in use, all 50 States can have
different requirements with respect to what the design
has to be in order to make the engine safe when it's
being repaired. I think that truly frustrates the
purpose of the Act.
MS. HARRINGTON: I completely agree with
what you're saying. And -- and I'm sorry if you
missed -- if we didn't state our position clearly in our
brief. Our view is that those kinds of requirements --
requirements that go to the design, construction, or
materials on a locomotive that will be used, if those
requirements are directed at the repair shop, then they
would be conflict pre-empted.
But they wouldn't fall within the field
that's governed by LIA because the LIA's substantive
standard of care only applies to locomotives that are in
use.
JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm not -- I'm not
concerned about conflict pre-emption. I'm not concerned
about State requirements that conflict with the Federal.
I'm talking about 50 State requirements that conflict
with each other, so that the manufacturer has to look to
all 50 States instead of looking to the Secretary here,
which says your engine is safe if you do this. And
you're telling me the manufacturer can no longer assume
that.
MS. HARRINGTON: No, I'm sorry. And let me
clarify. I appreciate the opportunity to clarify. In
our view, what the conflict is, is not a conflict with a
Federal rule saying you have to use this piece of
equipment and you can't use that piece of equipment.
The conflict is with one of the purposes of the LIA,
which is that the Federal Government be the only
regulator of equipment that will be used on a
locomotive.
And so, what that means is if -- if the
Federal Government hasn't spoken as to whether piece of
equipment A can be used on a locomotive, that means that
it can be, that the manufacturers know that it's okay.
And if you have a State rule that would have the effect
of dictating the equipment that can be used on a
locomotive, that would conflict with the single
regulator objective of the LIA.
JUSTICE BREYER: So, what's the difference
then? How do you do it? How do you -- how do you --
what is it you're thinking of that the manufacturer's
going to have to do in respect to his locomotive in
order to comply with the State law about warning that is
not going to mean that he changes the locomotive when it
runs on the railroad?
MS. HARRINGTON: Well, I think it depends on
what the warning claim is.
JUSTICE BREYER: Well, give me an example.
MS. HARRINGTON: Well, under the -- under
the Respondents' -- under the Respondents' view of the
field that's pre-empted, a State could not regulate the
disposal of equipment that's removed from a locomotive
during their repair process, even though --
JUSTICE BREYER: Does that have anything to
do with this case, the removal, never further -- no
further use of a bit of a locomotive?
MS. HARRINGTON: No. But also --
JUSTICE BREYER: No. Okay. Let's get to
this case.
MS. HARRINGTON: Also, in Respondents' view
a State could not regulate workplace hazards, such as by
requiring that workers wear goggles or masks.
JUSTICE BREYER: Oh, I didn't know anybody
denied that, that the State could regulate the repair
shop, indeed require what warnings they wish, indeed
require what equipment workers have to have. I thought
we're only talking about those rules of State law that
would affect what the manufacturer has to put by way of
design in his locomotive.
MS. HARRINGTON: Yes, but when you're --
JUSTICE BREYER: And that's what I'm having
trouble thinking of one that would only affect repair
shops and repairs, but -- maybe there's some kind of
equipment that you could stick on the front of it, and
it is a hook or something -- and it holds something, and
before it goes back on the line, you take it off and put
it in a locker. And -- but, you know, the more I
thought along those lines, I thought I'm getting into
outer space. This isn't reality. So --
MS. HARRINGTON: No. I think you could --
I'm sorry. I think you could imagine a world where a
State says when a locomotive comes into a repair shop,
the railroad or the repair shop has to attach a certain
kind of clamp on the wheels, a certain kind of brake,
that makes sure that the locomotive won't move while
it's in the repair shop. And when you're done repairing
the locomotive, you take them off, and the locomotive
goes back --
JUSTICE BREYER: All right. Now, does that
have more than theoretical value in this case?
MS. HARRINGTON: Well, I think in this case
the claims that we say would not be conflict pre-empted
or within the field are claims -- are the
failure-to-warn claims. Now, how a manufacturer
actually issues the warning that would be required I
think is a question that could be worked out as the case
proceeds.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: If the manufacturer is
really not controlling the repair shop, of what value is
this failure-to-warn claim?
MS. HARRINGTON: Well, again, I think it
depends how the warning is issued. You could require
that the manufacturer tell the purchaser of the products
to pass the warning along, to post warnings in a repair
shop. You know, there --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How -- they can't
control whether they do or don't.
MS. HARRINGTON: They could require it
contractually through the sale of the products. I think
those sorts of detailed issues would be things that
would be worked out on remand in this case.
Again, in our view, the only question
squarely presented in this case is the field pre-emption
question. And --
JUSTICE KAGAN: So, on that question, Ms.
Harrington, I'm still confused about the scope of your
regulatory authority and whether you think you have the
capacity to issue rules that are meant to protect repair
workers on railway equipment. So, can you issue a rule
under the LIA that says no asbestos-containing brakes
because we're afraid that these brakes injure the -- the
guys in the roundhouse.
MS. HARRINGTON: No. The LIA -- the
standard of care under the LIA only goes to whether a
locomotive is safe for use, and that is also the limit
of the FRA's regulatory authority. This Court, in the
United States v. B&O, addressed that issue. The ICC at
the time had issued a regulation requiring a certain
kind of reverse gear instead of a different kind of
reverse gear.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, what -- what
self-abnegation by the Federal Government, that "safe
for use" does not include safe for use when it's being
repaired.
MS. HARRINGTON: Because the statute says
safe for use on -- safe for use on the line. It's safe
for use on lines of interstate commerce.
JUSTICE KAGAN: But this does seem a very
limiting construction. Napier seems to have a broader
construction, and if I read some of your history right,
you've taken a broader understanding of your regulatory
authority in the past. So, why this narrow view?
MS. SMITH: I'm not aware that we've taken a
broader view of our regulatory authority under the LIA.
In Napier, again, what's important to remember is that
the State statutes at issue applied only to locomotives
that were in use. And so, I think it's hard to take any
-- any broad statements that were made in Napier and
read them as applying outside that context.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but if you're
talking about -- I bet there are a lot of things on
railroad cars that you can fix in the shop or you can
fix while it's under way, right? We're not always
talking about brakes. So, let's suppose there's one of
those things. You get to the shop and the guy says:
Boy, you got to fix this. And they said: Well, the
train's leaving, and we're going to go in 10 hours. And
he says: Okay, I can fix it during the -- while it's in
use. Is that covered or not?
MS. HARRINGTON: Well, again the LIA only
applies to the locomotives. So, if the thing that's
broken that you could fix while it's in use would not
make the locomotive unsafe to use, then it would not be
a violation of the statute to use it while --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, the line you've
been talking about between the repair shop and the
locomotive on the tracks, that's not really the line at
all.
MS. HARRINGTON: The line is in use versus
not in use. And that tends to match --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, then -- well,
then what's the answer to my question? This is
something you can fix in either place. It's covered
while it's -- if you fix it while the train is under
way, but it's not covered if you wait until it's in the
shop?
MS. HARRINGTON: Well, if it's -- if the
fact that it's broken makes the locomotive unsafe to
use, then the railroad cannot use it, cannot repair it
while it's in use.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, then it's not
whether it's in use or in the shop. It's whether it is
something that affects whether the locomotive can go,
whether it's --
MS. HARRINGTON: That's right. But here the
injuries occur when the locomotive is not in use because
it's in the repair shop. And in those situations, the
LIA's substantive heightened duty of care doesn't even
apply. And so, it doesn't make sense to think of those
claims as being within the field that's pre-empted by
the LIA because they're not governed by the LIA. Now,
those claims might bump up against the LIA in a
different way by conflicting again with the --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Do you have any --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Can you explain --
JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm sorry. Go ahead.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Can you explain the
difference -- you make a distinction between field
pre-emption and conflict pre-emption. Does that have
any practical significance at all in this case, because
I thought you agreed that the design defect claim would
be barred?
MS. HARRINGTON: Well, we agree that they
might be barred. I think, you know, this case comes to
the Court without any real development of the
plaintiffs' claim. All we have is what they stated in
their complaint. Their complaint incorporates a master
complaint which applies to all sorts of different kinds
of plaintiffs. And so, I think it's really hard to
understand exactly what their claims are, what the
effect of their claims would be with respect to the
design defect claims. And so, in our view, they would
-- the design defect claims would be pre-empted if they
would have the effect of dictating the character of
equipment that could be on a locomotive while it was in
use.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
MS. HARRINGTON: Thank you.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Hacker.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JONATHAN D. HACKER
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. HACKER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
The LIA as construed by this Court in
Napier, in particular in the passage quoted by Justice
Breyer, delegates to the DOT the exclusive authority to
determine the design and the materials of locomotive
equipment. Petitioners, however, argue that States in
fact may dictate locomotive design and materials so long
as they do so for some purpose other than safety of use
on the line.
But, again, in the passage Justice Breyer
pointed out, Napier holds that LIA pre-emption is not
about the purpose of locomotive equipment regulation and
is not about the geographic location of the locomotive
on or off the line when the regulation is enforced. As
Justice Sotomayor pointed out in the earlier argument
this morning, regulatory power is broader than purpose.
As Napier says, under the LIA, pre-emption is about the
locomotive equipment itself, what Napier referred to as
the physical elements of the locomotive.
JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, Mr. Hacker, could you
explain to me -- I wasn't sure reading your brief
whether you agree or disagree with the Government's
point that the agency cannot, under the LIA, issue the
kind of rule that I suggested just, you know, saying no
asbestos-containing brakes because of the danger that
those brakes pose to the repairmen.
MR. HACKER: I -- frankly, I would have
thought it possible. I would have to defer to the -- to
the DOT's view. It seems to me it would have been
within DOT's power under the LIA to say a locomotive is
not safe to operate if it can't be safely repaired.
Because there's no point in having a locomotive ready to
go on the line if it -- as soon as it comes off the line
with a problem it's going to injure those who work with
it. But we don't need to assert that position to defend
the proposition we have now --
JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, how is that? If they
are right as to the scope of their authority -- and
maybe they're not right, but if they are right about the
scope of their authority, why doesn't it follow that
these claims would not be field pre-empted; might be
conflict pre-empted but would not be field pre-empted
because we're no longer in the field?
MR. HACKER: Because the field is not --
it's not about the repair shop versus not the repair
shop. The field is the physical elements of the
locomotive itself. What States cannot do -- what DOT
has exclusive authority over is the design, the
materials, and the construction of the locomotive.
JUSTICE SCALIA: But only the design,
materials, and constructions for use. If you make that
concession, it's only those aspects of design,
materials, and construction that pertain to use. And if
you take the position that use includes only use on the
line and not use when it's being repaired in the repair
shop, I think you're in trouble.
MR. HACKER: I think we're not, Your Honor,
because the design doesn't change between the line and
the repair shop. And that's the key. If a State comes
in and says --
JUSTICE SCALIA: It's design for use.
MR. HACKER: I understand, but --
JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm not talking about the
word "design"; I'm talking about "design for use."
MR. HACKER: But the statute -- the reason
the statute gives power to the DOT is to ensure that
locomotives are safe for use on the line. But in order
to accomplish that objective, the power they have is
plenary over the design itself. They -- only one entity
gets to decide what the design is, and that's DOT. A
State can't come in and say --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: It's not -- it's not
clear --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, you're okay --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: It's not clear to me why a
railroad executive couldn't say, now I need to use 10
locomotives in this division because I will be using two
of them every week in the repair shop to repair them,
right? I don't know why that isn't use, but you
don't -- you don't seem to agree with that.
MR. HACKER: Well, I don't necessarily
disagree. We would certainly accept that proposition.
We're just saying you don't have to go there.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Now, I know it's use on
the line, but it seems to me that the repair shop is an
obvious extension of the line. Everybody knows that
it's going to have to spend, I don't know, 1 day a month
in the repair shop, and that's just part of -- of the
use.
MR. HACKER: We don't disagree with that.
JUSTICE BREYER: Why would their law be
pre-empted, a State law that says since the railroad
knows that asbestos is dangerous when revealed and since
it would be revealed in a repair shop, the railroad has
to provide the repair shops with appropriate worker
safety equipment; or alternatively, and lesser, the
railroad has to provide for the repair shop's documents
to be given to the workers which explain the risks and
how they can overcome them.
Now, in respect to that, which I'll lump
under various kinds of failure-to-warn claims, how does
the Act pre-empt those? It doesn't affect design of the
railroad, nor does it affect the use. Neither.
MR. HACKER: I would say two points, Your
Honor. First of all, it does affect the design because
a way to comply with that regulation is to use something
other than asbestos, to change the design. It's the
State saying, because you're using this design, you can
only use it lawfully in this State if you do the
following two or three things.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought that that was
not the nature of the notice claim. The design is
whatever it is. But the manufacturer has to issue
warnings so that the worker can protect himself against
that hazard. So, I thought that the defective design --
yes, I understand your argument. You would have one
standard for on the line and another when it's in the
repair shop. But this is not telling them to change the
design in any respect. It just says: Asbestos -- you
could take these measures to protect yourself.
MR. HACKER: At common law, a design -- a
failure-to-warn claim was a type of design defect claim.
It was a way of saying you can't use that design
lawfully unless you have the following type of warning.
If you -- you can't assume away the design aspect of it
because it still turns on -- it's a State conditioning
the design.
The LIA and the FRSA and SCAA and OSHA all
together solved this problem by -- and FELA, solved this
problem by saying it is the repair shop's responsibility
to ensure the safety of workers. We are not, to be
absolutely clear -- Ms. Harrington was incorrect when
she said: We don't believe that repair shop -- States
have the power to impose workplace conditions to protect
employee safety in the repair shop. They do.
JUSTICE BREYER: But -- no, no, no. That
argument would prevent States doing what they can do
lawfully, which is to regulate the repair shop because
with any given repair, with many of them, you could say,
well, we wouldn't have to -- we can just change the
locomotive design, for example. It carries beds with it
so that the workers who are repairing it get adequate
sleep. I mean, that isn't an answer to the argument
that it doesn't affect design to say, well, they could
comply with it by changing design, I don't think.
MR. HACKER: Well, what we would say is that
generally applicable laws that govern the repair shop --
States have authority -- to the extent not pre-empted by
OSHA, States have authority to require workplace
conditions and to require employers to protect employees
working. But what they can't do is tell manufacturers
here's the conditions under which you can use this
design, sell this design, distribute the design and
these materials lawfully within the State --
JUSTICE SCALIA: What would apply to the
repair shop would also apply to the locomotive in use,
I suppose, and it would be of little comfort to the
manufacturer that although the engine he has
manufactured has been certified as safe for use by the
Secretary, he is liable unless he warns the engineer:
Oh, it isn't safe for use in these circumstances; I have
to give you warning.
I mean, I cannot imagine that that's what --
that that's what the statute means as applied, at least
to the use of the engine on the -- on the tracks.
MR. HACKER: Well, we agree with that, but
we also think it applies with respect to manufacturers'
liability in the repair shop for the reason I said
earlier. The locomotive doesn't change. So, when it's
certified as safe for use on line, it can't be -- and
the locomotive manufacturer knows everything they know
by looking at DOT regulations. It can't be that a State
can come along and say: No, no, you can't use any of
that design; you have to use this completely different
one --
JUSTICE BREYER: No, what they're saying
is --
MR. HACKER: -- because this will make it
safe in the repair shop.
JUSTICE BREYER: What they're saying is
because when you open up the box, something no one does
on line, you will expose yourself to risk, and what we
are saying is, therefore, you must post a notice that
tells workers about those risks. And, indeed, if there
is a conflict, conflict pre-emption will take care of
it. But why should that kind of thing fall within the
scope of field pre-emption even under Napier, which, of
course, referred to equipment while this rule doesn't?
It refers to a sign. You're not going to change the
equipment.
MR. HACKER: Well, for the reason I said
earlier, Your Honor, which is, you don't know in
advance. If you say, in theory, a State can adopt a
warning requirement specific to a design otherwise
approved by the DOT, you don't know in advance whether
the warning requirements -- the manufacturers will be
able to easily comply with all 50 different types of
warning requirements and whether or not the warning
requirements -- some will be so stringent that it will
be easier to simply adopt a different design. The point
of the LIA is to take that kind of decisionmaking out of
the State's hands and put it into a Federal authority
which can make the relevant and appropriate decisions --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose --
MR. HACKER: -- as to what designs are
unlawful.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose the allegation is
there's a failure to warn workers to use a special kind
of mask that's very important if you're working near
asbestos. That's the claim they want. Now, are you
saying that the manufacturer cannot be required to give
that warning?
MR. HACKER: That's correct.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Are you also saying the
railroad cannot be forced to give that warning in its
repair shop?
MR. HACKER: The railroad can be required to
ensure the safe protection of employees that work there.
A workplace safety claim isn't really a warning claim.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: No, no. That was my --
can the railroad be held liable for failing to tell the
worker to use the mask?
MR. HACKER: It can be under OSHA, be held
liable for that.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Can the manufacturer be
held liable for failing to tell the railroad?
MR. HACKER: No. That would be a failure
to --
JUSTICE SCALIA: How is the railroad going
to know whether it's unsafe or not?
MR. HACKER: Because they have the --
JUSTICE SCALIA: How is the railroad going
to know whether there's asbestos in there unless the
manufacturer at least tells the railroad, even it
doesn't have to tell the worker?
MR. HACKER: Railroads have a duty under
FELA to ensure a safe workplace environment. That's
clear. And so, they have adequate incentives to ensure
that their employees have a safe work environment. If
they're -- if a worker is exposed to asbestos --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: But you could -- could
State law say you need a special kind of mask?
MR. HACKER: Well, not under the current
regime because FELA would pre-empt any claim by a
railroad worker. So, there wouldn't be -- there isn't
room for State law already.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: What about an independent
contractor who's not covered by FELA?
MR. HACKER: Could be -- could not have a
claim against the manufacturer. An independent
contractor would not have claim against the manufacturer
for failure to warn.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Under State law which by
hypothesis says you need this very special kind of mask.
It's required only in Illinois.
MR. HACKER: Right. The manufacturer could
not be held liable under that State law. That would be
a condition on the design, an effort by the State to
prescribe the condition, the type of design that could
be --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Could the railroad be held
liable for failure to give that kind of mask under State
law if it's not a FELA worker?
MR. HACKER: If it's a generally applicable
law about asbestos use, yes. I would say at some point
a law like that that's directed at a particular type of
equipment becomes potentially conflict pre-empted
because it puts a condition on the design of the
particular equipment. States are free to enforce
generally applicable laws about safe workplace
environments, asbestos handling --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Let me ask this question:
Is it your position that the -- that the engine is as
much in use when it's in the shop as when it's running
on the track? Is that your position?
MR. HACKER: We don't have a problem with
that position. We don't have -- we don't have a --
because we don't believe you have to establish that it's
in use in the repair shop to establish that the
pre-emption described by Justice Brandeis in Napier
controls, because the pre-emption he was describing
was -- the regulatory authority was over the equipment
itself which is the same exact equipment. A railroad --
a locomotive designed a particular way doesn't change
when it enters the repair shop; so, it's designed to be
fit for service.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, the reason it seems
to me somewhat important is that I can't conceive of 50
different State regulations for the kind of gloves and
things that the engineer has to wear on -- when he's
running the train on the track. And if that's so, it
seems to me it would help you to say that the shop was
the same, but you seem to say the shop was different.
MR. HACKER: Well, I only mean to say that
our position doesn't change whether or not the shop is
different because it's not -- the LIA pre-emption -- LIA
regulation isn't about repairing. The DOT may well have
authority -- they seem to think not -- over repairs
under the LIA, but what the LIA is about is the design
and the materials themselves. And States can't say for
themselves what a better or more preferable or -- a
locomotive design is for any other reason. The
Respondents' brief and reply brief on page 5 makes an
interesting point. They think they've proved their case
when they say the LIA doesn't for example permit the DOT
to impose a U.S. steel requirement, a domestic content
requirement, on locomotives. The implication would be,
of course, that a State could because it's outside the
field as Petitioners define it, that a State could say
locomotives can only be used within our State if they're
made of U.S. steel.
I don't think that makes any sense at all.
It can't possibly be right, and the reason it's not
right is that it misunderstands pre-emption under the
LIA as described by Napier. Of course, it's within the
general authority of the DOT to determine that a
locomotive should be made with U.S. steel, but that
authority can be abused. It might be arbitrary and
capricious; it's not permissible for them to do that.
But the content of locomotives is exclusively within the
jurisdiction of the DOT, and States can't decide for
themselves that a locomotive otherwise compliant under
Federal regulations is --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, they're -- they're
not saying here you have to manufacture it a certain
way. They're just saying if you manufacture it in a
manner that we consider unsafe, you have to warn people.
MR. HACKER: Well, that's part of their
argument, but their main claim is the first one, which
is that you are prohibited in this State from using
asbestos. It can't happen, even though Federal
regulations said you could. That's the main part of
their claim. They have a secondary claim, which is
failure to warn and which we submit is essentially a
type of design defect claim that says if you're going to
use asbestos, then you have to warn.
And we don't even know -- as Ms. Harrington
was describing, there's a lot -- there would be a lot to
be determined if conflict pre-emption applies to failure
to warn in a given case. That's the whole problem, Your
Honors, is that the LIA was saying we don't want to
expose manufacturers to the potential of future State
court litigation.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, do we have to reach
this failure-to-warn problem in this case?
MR. HACKER: I think it's presented here. I
mean, we think it's completely caught up in the design
defect issue, but the other side is -- is trying to
defend by saying we have a design defect claim, but we
also have a failure-to-warn claim. But we submit the
two are bound up together.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I -- if I'm
understanding your argument correctly, you're saying
that if Napier controls the design of -- and a
locomotive part, that includes any design defect that's
encompassed by State law, whether it's design in its
traditional sense or failure to warn.
MR. HACKER: That's correct.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's basically what
the court below said.
MR. HACKER: That's correct, and that's what
Judge Kozinski said in the Law case, and Judge Winter
said in Oglesby.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Just as a practical
matter, I'm assuming that some railroad repair yards are
owned by the railroad itself, so the railroad repair
people are railroad employees, correct?
MR. HACKER: I -- I think that's right, yes.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Are there some that are
not?
MR. HACKER: Well, they might --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: They are not considered
railroad employees, but they're considered something
else?
MR. HACKER: I don't -- two things I would
say. I don't know the answer for sure, but I think they
probably are, but there are also repair shops that then
-- that are owned by other railroads, and that's part of
a problem that manufacturers have, is you don't know,
when you sell the -- the locomotive to a railroad, who
is going to be --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Just to be --
MR. HACKER: -- repairing under what
conditions.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Just to be clear, under
your view of the LIA, there could be other laws that
pre-empt it or prohibit it? States can tell railroad
yards put signs up, wear protective equipment, do
whatever it is to protect the worker from this repair.
MR. HACKER: Yes.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: They just can't tell
them --
MR. HACKER: Yes.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- include a warning on
the brake, or to --
MR. HACKER: Specific to the equipment
itself.
What we would say is the State has to take
the locomotive equipment as a given. It is what it is.
And then if that locomotive equipment creates risks for
workers, the employer may have to do things to account
for those risks, but the equipment can't be regulated by
the State. The equipment itself can't be regulated by
the State in any respect.
JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Hacker, do you think we
would decide Napier the same way if it came to us today?
MR. HACKER: I do think so, Your Honor. Of
course, I don't think that matters because Napier is
what it is and has been relied upon for 85 years. But I
think there would be a very good argument that it would
be decided the same way today under the Ray case that
Justice Sotomayor mentioned. That was a very similar
kind of delegation of regulatory authority, and the
Court held that there was the same kind of field
pre-emption. There are some differences one could
discuss, but Napier is what it is, as I say.
If The Court has no further questions, I'll
cede the balance of my time.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
Mr. Frederick, you have 4 minutes.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT BY DAVID C. FREDERICK
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. FREDERICK: Manufacturers clearly have
the best information about the dangerous aspects of
their products, and they issue warnings and instructions
in manuals and provide all kinds of information so that
persons working on their equipment are going to know the
special hazards. It doesn't make sense to inoculate
those manufacturers from liability where they have the
best information to ensure that repair workers are not
going to be exposed to risks.
With respect to the point about being on the
line, the whole idea behind the Locomotive Inspection
Act was not just for use, Justice Kennedy, but also safe
to operate on the railroad line. Under the
regulations -- and this is well established -- yard
limits are drawn outside the bowl where switching
operations and repair operations occur, so that
everybody knows where the Federal LIA standard applies
and where it doesn't.
And the reason why the LIA has had this kind
of history with respect to repair work goes to the
history of -- behind this Court's recognition of the
commerce power. Up until the New Deal era, it was well
settled that Congress could not legislate on intrastate
activities, which are peculiar to repair yards. And so,
this Court when it decided the Shanks case in the mid
1910s held that a railroad worker could not bring an
FELA claim because his work was not in interstate
commerce; it was only in intrastate commerce. And that
is why the ICC throughout this entire period never
devoted regulations to repair yards, because this
Court's Commerce Clause jurisprudence precluded Federal
regulatory activity for that.
So, if you look at this case from an
historical perspective, Justice Kagan, it's not clear
that the full parameters of the way the Court would
explain Napier would be the same, because its approach
to field pre-emption is so different after the New Deal
era than it was before the New Deal era. And that is
also why when this Court looks at regulatory
implications of common law claims, it has had no problem
allowing State law to have design defect claims with
respect to planes, cars, motorboats, and trucks, even
though the implications of a State law claim might find
liability for the insufficiency of the design imposing
an unreasonable risk to the person who is exposed to
that risk with respect to that interstate modality.
There's no reason why you have to have a
broad and expansive view of the field here because
Congress subsequently has enacted in this very area to
give the Federal agency pre-emptive authority when it
deems that authority appropriate. And as the Federal
Government says --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And it knows -- it
knows about Napier and what's been going on for 85
years, and if it wants to pull back on the pre-emptive
effect of the provisions interpreted in Napier, it's
free to do that, too.
MR. FREDERICK: It did so, though, Your
Honor in 49 U.S.C. 20106, where it said that unless and
until the Federal Government issues a regulation in a
particular field, the States are allowed to have their
rule be in effect.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But that was -- that was
the Safety Act, and they didn't amend the Locomotive
Act. The Locomotive Act is what it was, and they didn't
put that clause in it.
MR. FREDERICK: But that's why, Justice
Ginsburg, the point here is how broadly do you define
the scope of the field, and Napier defined it in an
historical context that we just don't live in anymore.
And there's no reason to give manufacturers a complete
pass from liability when they have the best information
to advise railroad -- railroads and railroad workers how
to work on their equipment in a safe way without
exposing their workers to unnecessary risks.
Thank you.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
