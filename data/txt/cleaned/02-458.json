HOLIFIELD\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. HOLIFIELD: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nPetitioners believe that a sole owner may be a\nparticipant in an employee benefit plan if another common\nlaw employee participates in such plan, regardless of\nwhether that corporation or entity transacts business as a\nsole proprietorship, partnership, or corporation. This\nbelief is based on a plain reading of ERISA, the plan\nlanguage in question here, the statutory scheme of ERISA,\nthe DOL regulations and the policy considerations beside\n-- excuse me -- behind such regulations.\nWhen ERISA was passed, it incorporated the term\nemployee. This Court dealt with that term in Nationwide\nv. Darden and held that the term employee includes a\ncommon law employee. And -- and the term participant in a\nplan says if you're an employee with a right to a benefit,\nthen you've met the definition of participant. In just\nlooking at these two terms alone, Yates was a participant\nin this plan and it's the petitioners' position as such he\nhad the rights to enforce the rights of ERISA.\nIf you further read, the terms of the plan in\nand of itself support this. This was an IRS prototype\nplan and the plan allowed for sole owners, sole\nproprietors, partnerships, or even incorporated entities\nto participate as sole owners in the plan if they covered\nother common law employees.\nOn top of this, if you look at the ERISA\nstatutory schemes, when ERISA was passed, title I\naddressed many different concerns. As I've already\nexplained the definition of employee and participant\nspecifically include the person such as Yates as allowing\nhim to participate because he is an employee.\nFurthermore, if you look at, for instance, ERISA\nsection 1103(b), that provision excludes as an exclusion\nfor certain aspects to the trust requirements of ERISA.\nOne of those specific exclusions if -- is that some or all\nemployees are employees as defined in the Internal Revenue\nCode, and a specific reference is made to 26 U.S.C.\n401(c)(1). And so you -- you see a pattern here that the\nIRS Code and the ERISA law being congruent in its\nadministration of plans and a specific reference to a\ndefinition of working employers that includes self-\nemployed individuals, partnerships, and -- and people such\nas that.\nWhen ERISA was passed, title II of ERISA\nspecifically dealt with changes to the tax code. It dealt\nwith specifically amendments to code section 401.\nSince --\nQUESTION: Mr. Holifield, I'm curious whether if\n-- if we were to agree with you that the petitioner could\nbe considered an employee under ERISA, do we have to then\ngo on and address the rest of this rather complicated\nquestion on the alienation issue and so forth, or would we\nremand on that?\nMR. HOLIFIELD: Your Honor --\nQUESTION: It wasn't dealt with below, was it?\nMR. HOLIFIELD: No, it wasn't, Your Honor. And\nit -- it's -- certainly I could make an argument here that\nPatterson and Guidry is controlling on that matter of\nanti-alienation, but that issue wasn't the particular\nissue --\nQUESTION: No.\nMR. HOLIFIELD: -- raised in this Court, and --\nand not addressed in the lower courts.\nQUESTION: What is the -- what is that issue?\nBecause I saw some -- I'm not sure that we're talking\nabout the same issue. What is the issue that you say\nwasn't addressed?\nMR. HOLIFIELD: The issue that was not addressed\nin the lower courts is there is the maybe potential\nconflict with the Bankruptcy Code as far as preference\nlaws and the ERISA anti-alienation provision.\nQUESTION: In other words, this $50,000 wasn't\nput back until the eve of bankruptcy so even if -- even if\nwe agreed with you that Yates can be an employee, this\n$50,000 still might constitute an unlawful preference.\nMR. HOLIFIELD: Your Honor, it -- it might.\nThere's certainly language, I believe, in the Sixth\nCircuit opinion and the district court opinion that they\nboth held that had -- certainly indicated it would be\ndicta that had Yates been declared a participant in the\nplan, they would have enforced the anti-alienation\nprovisions, but there was no specific holding on that\npoint.\nQUESTION: And even if there was, that's not\nbefore us.\nMR. HOLIFIELD: Yes, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: We -- theoretically we could agree\nwith you that he's a participant and so forth but still\nsay send it back for the bankruptcy issue.\nMR. HOLIFIELD: That is within the prerogative\nof this Court, Your Honor.\nWhen title II was enacted, it was enacted with\nthe -- an understanding that in 1942 the Revenue Act of --\nwas passed that allowed shareholder employees to\nparticipate in a plan. In 1962, Self-Employed Individuals\nTax Retirement Act was passed and that allowed sole\nproprietors or partnerships to form a Keogh plan in which\n-- and whether they could participate in a plan that only\ncovered themselves or allowed it if it covered other\nemployees.\nERISA was passed in '74, and it was passed with\nan understanding that these tax code provisions were\nthere. When Congress was amending title II of ERISA to\namend the tax code, it did not change any of these\ndefinitions. It clearly allowed these sole owners, these\nworking owners, if you'll let me call them that, to\nparticipate in these plans and had Congress wanted to\nexclude them, they could have. They knew how to exclude\npeople.\nQUESTION: Does it have to be a working owner?\nCould it be someone who just owns shares and doesn't work\nin the business?\nMR. HOLIFIELD: Possibly, Your Honor. Yes. I\nmean, that is -- very rare does that occur. Typically you\nmay see that in a group health plan, but not typically in\na retirement plan. You may see those types of things, but\nthere's nothing to prevent that.\nQUESTION: That -- that would be pretty far\nafield from the word employee. I mean, one could be --\nfor example, did -- did Yates -- he was a -- a working\nowner.\nMR. HOLIFIELD: Yes, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Was -- were FICA and FUTA taxes paid\nfor his labor?\nMR. HOLIFIELD: Yes, Your Honor. In the terms\nof -- I think the record is critical on this that he's a\ncommon law employee. The retirement plan in and of itself\ndefined compensation as W-2 compensation, which means FICA\nand FUTA, as you're inquiring, was withheld. And so as a\nW-2 employee, the monies that were contributed to this\nplan were based on a percentage of his W-2 compensation.\nSo from a common law standpoint, just pure corporate law,\nhe was an employee of that corporation who was handed a\nW-2 as an employee of the Yates P.C., and it was based on\nthat compensation that his contributions were made to the\nplan.\nIn title IV of ERISA, there's an exclusion for\nplans maintained solely for substantial owners. And the\npoint I'm making, whether you look at title I, title II,\nor title IV, you see references to sole owners being in\nthere or not -- possible ways they could be excluded, but\nnone of them that would prevent them from participating in\nplans such as this.\nAnd I think if you look at that, as well as look\nat the DOL regulatory scheme that has come out of this,\nthe DOL opinion letters report this conclusion, be that\n79-08A which is in the record at J.A. -- the joint\nappendix at 271 and 273, the opinion letter 99-04A at 274a\nand 283a. You see an information letter that's actually\nis part of UNUM Providence brief at appendix 1, and that's\na letter from Robert Dole to Susan Hoffman. Each of these\nis where the DOL has opined an opinion that people that\nare working owners can be a participant in an employee\nbenefit plan. And so I think the case law on that point\nis pretty clear.\nAnd I think where the confusion comes into play\nis this definition of employee benefit plan in a reg that\nhas been misread by, I believe, two circuits on that\npoint. And I think just a plain reading of the reg in and\nof itself shows that working owners were intended to be\nincluded in these plans if they had another participant in\nthe plan. And --\nQUESTION: Here there were a couple of other --\nMR. HOLIFIELD: Yes, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: -- plan participants at all times?\nMR. HOLIFIELD: Yes, Your Honor. The\nstipulation of facts point that -- that there were always\nother participants in the plan besides the working owner\nsince these plans were formed in 1989.\nAnd so just for the policy reasons behind that\nis I think the preambles to the reg further shed light\nabout the definition of employee benefit plan. And what\nthe Department of Labor was weighing here was do you\nreally want to have working owners that are the sole\nowners, sole participants of the plan, have to comply with\nthe ERISA burdens. In other words, is there a need to\ntell the working owner, even though there's no one else in\nthe plan, you need to give yourself a summary plan\ndescription? You need to file an annual tax return\nreporting about the plan. You need to communicate COBRA\nrights for a health plan to yourself.\ncreated that plan, you are in a situation that you are\naware of the benefits of the plan. But as soon as you\nhave one other employee, then there's a necessity for you\nto communicate those rights and benefits and explain the\nterms of the plan.\nAnd that seems to be a pretty reasonable reading\nof what the DOL was trying to balance here. In their\npreambles, they even said, one, there's no reason to\nprotect any abuse here, and secondly, that's not a good\nuse of our resources to administer sole owner/sole\nparticipant plans. And given that background, I think\nthat's how that reg should be read.\nQUESTION: How does it come in? I'm -- I'm --\njust if you could clarify. This is a little --\nMR. HOLIFIELD: Sure.\nQUESTION: -- complicated in my mind.\nBut basically -- so we have all the\ncharacteristics of a plan. Now, you have to start first\nby saying that Dr. Yates is an employee of the corporation\ncalled Raymond Yates, P.C. And then it's not a plan,\nhowever, because he's -- wait a minute. It's not a plan\nunless -- if there are no employees.\nMR. HOLIFIELD: Yes, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: And an owner is not an employee for\nthat purpose.\nMR. HOLIFIELD: Correct.\nQUESTION: And so we look to see. There is\nanother one, and therefore, what section 25103.3 took away\nunder (b) -- under (c) it gave back under (b).\nMR. HOLIFIELD: Yes, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Or it gave back because there was\nsomebody else.\nMR. HOLIFIELD: Yes.\nQUESTION: But step one of that, we had to say\nthat he was an employee of the corporation.\nMR. HOLIFIELD: Yes, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: And where does step one come from?\nMR. HOLIFIELD: Well, step one is just based on\ncommon law and the work -- and that is what this Court\nheld in Darden. If you look at that, that --\nQUESTION: Okay. So we have to say -- we have\nto find -- we have to first find that he is an employee\nand, in fact, these regs don't give a definition of that.\nMR. HOLIFIELD: Exactly.\nQUESTION: So we have to appeal to the common\nlaw to say he's -- he's an employee under common law\nprinciples of the corporation.\nMR. HOLIFIELD: Yes, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Then (b) says -- (c) says he isn't\none for purposes of ERISA, and (b) says that really wrecks\nthe whole thing unless there's somebody else.\nMR. HOLIFIELD: Correct.\nQUESTION: And that's how it works.\nMR. HOLIFIELD: Exactly, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Okay.\nMR. HOLIFIELD: And I think if you look at --\nwhat the -- the holding in the Sixth Circuit, I really\nthink it really creates some policy problems for employee\nbenefit plans that are -- are pretty significant. For\ninstance, the holding was that there is an employee\nbenefit plan here which -- with the issue you just raised.\nAnd then it said, but there's not a participant -- Yates\nis not a participant in that plan. So you have this -- I\ndon't know what you call it because he's been under one\nplan document since the passage of the plan, since it was\nenacted, and so now there's a presumption that this aspect\nof the plan is governed under State law, even though\nthere's never been a provision provided such as that. The\nplan document is the same plan. And you could very easily\nget fiduciaries in a situation like this having\ninconsistent State law claims versus Federal claims. You\ncould end up having situations that really make no sense.\nAnd one of the -- the primary purposes of ERISA\nwas to avoid the very issue that that would cause and that\nis they wanted a uniform administrative scheme for all of\nthe States and now there will be, you know, 50 States\nhaving different regulatory provisions regarding these\nplans, plus the Federal regulations. And what if they\ndon't co-exist in consistent remedies?\nAnd so I think for those reasons, petitioner is\nasking that Yates be declared a participant in this plan\nand remand that for further proceedings.\nIf you have no further questions, I'll reserve\nthe rest of my time.\nQUESTION: Very well, Mr. Holifield. Is it\nHolifield or Holifield?\nMR. HOLIFIELD: Holifield.\nQUESTION: Holifield. Mr. Holifield.\nMr. Roberts, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MATTHEW D. ROBERTS\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,\nAS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS\nMR. ROBERTS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nHundreds of thousands of shareholders, partners,\nand sole proprietors who work for the businesses they own\nare currently covered by benefit plans that also cover\nother employees. All of those different types of working\nowners are participants subject to the rights and remedies\nof ERISA, just like the other employees in the plans. And\nthat's clear from the text of ERISA which contains several\npartial exemptions, which Mr. Holifield referred to some\nof, for certain plans that cover working owners, and those\nexemptions presuppose that working owners may be ERISA\nparticipants.\nIn addition, working owners have long been\neligible to participate, along with other employees, in\npension plans qualifying for favorable tax treatment. And\nERISA was intended to harmonize with those tax provisions\nand it didn't revoke the ability of working owners to\nparticipate in tax qualified plans.\nCoverage of working owners also furthers ERISA's\npurposes of ensuring that employee benefit plans are\ngoverned by a single set of regulations, of encouraging\nplan creation, and of protecting plan participants. So\nthere's no question that the other non-owner employees\nthat are covered by plans that also cover working owners\nare participants subject to the rights and remedies of\nERISA.\nAnd if the working owners in those plans were\nnot also ERISA participants, they would be subject to\ndifferent regulations and have different rights and\nremedies than other employees in the same plan. They\nmight even be prohibited from being covered by the plans\nat all, and that result would place the coverage\nprovisions of title I of ERISA at war with the tax\nprovisions governing pension plans and with the insurance\nprovisions of title IV of ERISA, both of which cover plans\nin which working owners participate along with other\nemployees.\nQUESTION: Mr. Roberts --\nQUESTION: But what if --\nQUESTION: -- what -- what is the consequence of\nthe Sixth Circuit decision on the tax side of this plan?\nThey said for the -- the retirement portion, it can't be\nan ERISA -- ERISA plan, but would -- would the tax\nbenefits be lost as well?\nMR. ROBERTS: No. The -- the -- it's clear and\nit's accepted in the opinions below that it is a qualified\nplan for -- for tax purposes. But it -- there's a strong\npossibility that if -- if the working owner, Dr. Yates, is\nnot an ERISA participant under title I of ERISA, that\ntitle I would prohibit him from being in the plan at all,\nwhich would be a very anomalous situation because the tax\ncode is encouraging him to be in the plan along with other\nemployees. And title I of ERISA would be prohibiting what\nthe tax code encourages, and if it were a defined benefit\nplan, which this one doesn't happen to be, it would in\nfact be insured also under title IV of ERISA which insures\nplans in which working owners participate along with other\nemployees.\nAnd in addition, allowing working owners to\nparticipate along with other employees, as I was alluding\nto before, advances ERISA's purpose of encouraging\nemployee benefit plans because the ability to participate\nthemselves gives working owners an incentive to establish\nplans for other workers. It also could create economies\nof scale in plan administration and investment and it\nencourages owners to monitor the plans to ensure that\nthey're well managed and that they're well funded.\nSo for all of those reasons, the Department of\nLabor has issued the advisory opinion stating that owners\ncan be participants in ERISA plans. The IRS and the PBGC\nshare that view, and it's entitled to substantial weight.\nThe -- the reason that the court of appeals\nreached the contrary conclusion is it misread the\nregulation that Justice Breyer was discussing with Mr.\nHolifield earlier.\nQUESTION: You're -- you're not saying it's\nentitled to Chevron deference, just substantial weight?\nMR. ROBERTS: Yes. Skidmore deference, Your\nHonor, on the interpretive letter, although --\nQUESTION: Do we need deference?\nMR. ROBERTS: No. We don't think you need any\ndeference, Your Honor.\nThe one point that --\nQUESTION: Well, I don't know why it isn't\nChevron, but I mean, what he's referring to is the\nargument about the mysterious meaning of Mead, which if\nyou'd like to go into it, fine.\nMR. ROBERTS: I -- I have no desire for --\nQUESTION: I just want to know what the\nGovernment's position is in this. As I understand it, it\nis not Chevron. You're just -- Skidmore.\nMR. ROBERTS: We're not asking -- we're not\nasking for Chevron deference. As the Chief Justice\npointed out, we think that it's --\nQUESTION: I want to know -- I don't care what\nyou're asking for. You do not think it's entitled to\nChevron deference. Is that right?\nMR. ROBERTS: We read Mead to say ordinarily --\nparticularly since in Christianson, the Court was\nconfronting an opinion letter from the Department of\nLabor, I would hesitate to suggest that an opinion letter\nfrom the Department of Labor here and a statute that is,\nas far as I can tell, no different in how it treats\nopinion letters, would be entitled to greater deference\nthan --\nQUESTION: Well, you have Udall v. Tallman, if\nyou want to go into it --\nMR. ROBERTS: Well --\nQUESTION: -- where it's interpreting its own\nregs.\nMR. ROBERTS: That's a different -- yes. Yes,\nYour Honor. On the question -- on the question of the\nSecretary's interpretation of her regulation as to limit\nthe definition of employee to only the regulation itself\nand to not extend to the statute, on that point the\nSecretary's interpretation of her own regulation is\ncontrolling. That would be Udall, Auer v. Robbins, which\nis also a Labor Department case. And I think there's no\nquestion about that as well.\nOne point I did want to make is that we would\nurge the Court to make clear in its opinion that all types\nof working owners, not just those that are common law\nemployees, are -- are eligible to be participants under\nERISA. And the reason for that is that there's confusion\non that in the courts of appeals and the very reasons --\nsame reasons that justify the conclusion that sole\nshareholders can be ERISA participants also justify the\nconclusion that sole proprietors and partners who are not\ncommon law employees, if they are working for the\nbusinesses, may be ERISA participants.\nQUESTION: You -- you keep stressing working for\nthe businesses.\nquestion I asked Mr. Holifield about suppose you have a\nsingle shareholder, 100 percent owner, but that doesn't\nwork in the business.\nMR. ROBERTS: As a general matter, I think that\nperson could not be covered as a -- a participant. The\nperson might be designated by a participant as a -- as a\nbeneficiary or in certain circumstances designated by the\nplan as a beneficiary in connection with a participant in\nthe plan who was an -- an employee. But the definition of\nemployee for ERISA is the same definition as under 401 of\nthe Internal Revenue Code which is common law employees\nplus self-employed individuals who are people that are\nproviding personal services to the business and getting\nearned income. Responds to Your Honor.\nIf there are no further questions, we would ask\nthat the judgment of the court of appeals be reversed and\nremanded.\nQUESTION: If -- I just have one question. If\n-- if we follow your suggestion for the writing of the\nopinion, how do you suggest we explain and cite Clackamas\nCounty?\nMR. ROBERTS: Well, in -- in Clackamas, the\nCourt followed the same approach that the Court followed\nin Darden. And the first step in that approach is to look\nto the statute.\nQUESTION: Look at the statute.\nMR. ROBERTS: And so we would say Clackamas just\ndoesn't come in because you look to the statute. The\nstatute makes clear that all the types of working owners\ncan be covered, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Roberts.\nMr. Troutman, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF C. MARK TROUTMAN\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. TROUTMAN: Thank you, Your Honor. Mr. Chief\nJustice, and may it please the Court:\nJustice Breyer, we -- we address this issue at\nthe very level that you -- you talked about, that first\ncommon law level, and we think an important distinction\nshould be made in this case that this case is not about\nworking owners. This case is about one working\nshareholder, a sole shareholder. And we think that makes\na substantial difference when you get down to the basics\nof an organization and -- and you look at the fiduciary\nduties a president, a director has to a corporation and\nyou look at the fact that when you have one shareholder,\nthere's one person that that duty is enforceable by, and\nthat's the same person that it applies to.\nOn the other hand, in this -- in this Court's\nopinion in Clackamas, you had four shareholders, and no\nmatter what their interests were, those shareholders all\nhad fiduciary rights and expectations between themselves\nand all had the right to enforce those fiduciary\nobligations amongst them. So there is some element of\ncontrol that those other shareholders have when -- when\nyou try to separate one down.\nBut here, at its basic level, Dr. Yates is\ncontrolled by no one. So when you start talking about\ncommon law applications of master/servant and control,\nthere's no one else to apply it to. He answers to no one\nin this corporation. So we think --\nQUESTION: I mean, for what purpose? If you --\nsuppose I set up a corporation. I'm the sole shareholder\nand I enter into an employment agreement they pay me\n$1,000 a month and I'm called the president, chief cook\nand bottle washer, and employee. Now, am I not an\nemployee under the common law? The common law, say, for\npurposes of tort, is there not respondeat superior so that\nsomeone who sues me can get to the assets of the\ncorporation for purposes of liability --\nMR. TROUTMAN: There -- there is.\nQUESTION: -- of any kind? Is there any\ndifference whether I happen to be the sole shareholder or\nnot?\nMR. TROUTMAN:\ndifference --\nQUESTION: Which -- what is it?\nMR. TROUTMAN: -- in this case because --\nQUESTION: No, no. What is not in this case.\nWhat is it in general?\nMR. TROUTMAN: Well, in general you're -- you're\ncorrect that -- that you would be --\nQUESTION: All right. If I'm correct in\ngeneral, then what is it about this --\nMR. TROUTMAN: Okay. In this case and in the\nClackamas case, the Court looked at what the common law\nconsiders an employee. And we think when you apply common\nlaw concepts of control in a master/servant relationship\nand when you get down to breaking down and applying the\nelements that are referenced in the Darden case, that all\nof these -- all of these elements, when you're applying\nthem to Dr. Yates, will indicate that as sole shareholder\nhe is more considered an employer than he is an employee.\nQUESTION: When you talk about control, Mr.\nTroutman, you're talking about two different people\nbasically. How much control does one have over the other.\nHere there is only one.\nMR. TROUTMAN: That's correct, Your Honor, and\nthat's why we think that when you have sole shareholders\nand when you -- and when you're dealing with trying to\napply a control to only one, it's almost an anomaly. And\n-- and --\nQUESTION: Well, but you -- you think then that\na sole shareholder for that reason cannot be an employee?\nMR. TROUTMAN: We think that for purposes of\nERISA, when ERISA is trying to determine whether a person\nis an employee and an employer and where we're not given\nmuch guidance by the statute, we don't think these --\nnumber one, we don't think these other statutory\nprovisions give us guidance with a sole shareholder. And\nwe think a distinction should be made within this category\nof working owners between sole proprietors and -- and sole\nshareholders. And so while in -- in the common law\ncontext in general, an employee may constitute or consist\nof an -- of a sole shareholder, when -- when you're trying\nto separate that person out under ERISA and plug that\nperson into one of those definitions under ERISA --\nQUESTION: Why does it have to be one\ndefinition? Certainly Yates is an employer, but why can't\nhe also be an employee? Why -- am I right that you seem\nto think it's got to be one or the other? It can't be\nboth?\nMR. TROUTMAN: We think under Darden -- yes,\nJustice Ginsburg. We think under Darden that when you\napply the factors that are listed in the Darden case, the\ncontrol, the -- the providing of the instrumentalities,\nthe right to direct the work of other employees, we think\nthat that results in this instance with the sole\nshareholder of classifying him as an employer, not an\nemployee.\nQUESTION: Well, he is an employer. There's no\nquestion about that. But why can't he be an employee for\nthis purpose just as he is for taxes on workers like\nSocial Security and unemployment compensation?\nMR. TROUTMAN: Well, I -- I guess under that --\nunder that scenario then we would need to look at perhaps\nwhat the employer -- how the -- how the particular person\nis acting under the plan. And if -- if we're talking\nabout is he taking money out of his paycheck and deducting\n-- and contributing under ERISA, perhaps he's an employee.\nIs, on the other hand, he -- exercising his -- his\ninvestment decisions as trustee, does he then come under\nthe definition of employer as someone acting on his\nbehalf?\nOr in this instance, we have the -- we have the\ndebt that existed for -- for many years and contrary to\nthe specific terms of the plan, that debt was not repaid\nby a specific --\nQUESTION: But that's an issue that everyone\nagrees is open, that even -- even if he's classified as an\nemployee, the creditors may have priority over the plan\nwith respect to that $50,000.\nMR. TROUTMAN: Yes, I agree with that, but what\nI was going -- what I was -- what I was leading to was\nthat when he failed to make those quarterly deductions\nthat are required by the plan, he -- that more couches him\nin terms of an employer because he's the -- he's got his\nemployer hat on, in other words, because he's the one that\nwould control what deductions come out of employees' pay\nor not. And -- and we think that's the very heart of this\n-- this case. And so if he's acting in that capacity,\nperhaps --\nQUESTION: If he hadn't -- if he hadn't loaned\nany money from the plan, then he would be an employee?\nMR. TROUTMAN: If he hadn't loaned any money in\nthe plan --\nQUESTION: Hadn't borrowed any money.\nMR. TROUTMAN: Borrowed any money. We wouldn't\nbe here because it would have been --\nQUESTION: No, no. But no. But --\nQUESTION: He'd still be something I assume.\nQUESTION: That -- that's true, but we're --\nwe're asking what his status is.\nMR. TROUTMAN: I understand. But now, there's\nalso -- we also make the point that perhaps there can be\nparticipation under the plan, but that doesn't necessarily\nelevate him to this protected status as a participant.\nUnder the Internal Revenue provisions, he is permitted to\nparticipate under this plan, but the IRS -- I mean, the --\nERISA distinguishes between an employer and an employee in\nthose -- in those definitions. So --\nQUESTION: I didn't get your answer to Justice\nGinsburg's question. Had -- had he not borrowed the\nmoney, would he -- would he have been employee?\nMR. TROUTMAN: He could have possibly been an\nemployee insofar as -- if -- if under Justice Ginsburg's\nscenario, you look at the activities of the individual\nunder a specific set of circumstances.\nQUESTION: Would he be a participant in the plan\nlawfully under ERISA?\nMR. TROUTMAN: We don't think so. We think that\nhe --\nQUESTION: Whether or not he borrowed money.\nMR. TROUTMAN: Whether or not he borrowed money.\nOur position is that he may have been able to participate\nunder the plan under the Internal Revenue --\nQUESTION: But you do concede that the\nDepartment of Labor views it differently.\nMR. TROUTMAN: The Department of Labor does view\nit differently.\nQUESTION: Shouldn't that have some weight in\nour interpretation?\nMR. TROUTMAN: We think under the Harris County\ncase that is entitled to the respect to the extent that it\nis persuasive. But again, the -- the labor regulations\nrefer to this broad class of working owners, and we think\nthat there is a substantial difference between sole\nproprietors, sole shareholders, and these other\nclassifications, for instance, the General Motors line\nemployee who gets stock as part of his pension plan. We\ndon't think that -- you know, because he's not able to\ncontrol his job, he's still at the mercy of -- of\nmanagement. We don't think that -- that stock ownership,\nno matter how fractional, gives him any -- any rights to\ncontrol or act as --\nQUESTION: What -- what about partners?\nMR. TROUTMAN: Partners would be the same way we\nthink because obviously you're going to have more than one\nperson if it's a partnership. But a partner, you know,\nowes other fiduciary duties and an individual partner is\nalways subject to a fiduciary duty to his other partners.\nQUESTION: A partner -- say, there are two\npartners. They could be both employees and employers of\nthe business.\nMR. TROUTMAN: No. We think -- well, no. Yes,\nwe would agree that if there's two or more, that that\ndistinguishes the situation from this case where you have\none sole person involved. So, yes, partners could be\nemployees and deemed participants under -- under ERISA.\nQUESTION: But you don't just have one person\ninvolved. Isn't it correct you have a corporation which\nis a person and you have a human person? So there are\nreally two people involved.\nMR. TROUTMAN: You do, but you only have -- but\nthat -- that corporation, that legal fictional entity, can\nonly act through a human person, and there's only one\nhuman person to act. Dr. Yates, as president or director,\nowes those fiduciary duties to the corporation, but as\nsole shareholder, you know, in essence they're owed to\nhim. So he -- there's no way to enforce those back.\nQUESTION: Well, the -- you know, you're -- if\n-- you can't be appealing to the common law then if -- if\nwe're going to get the meaning of employee from the common\nlaw. The common law doesn't pierce the corporate veil\nlike that.\nMR. TROUTMAN: No, it doesn't.\nQUESTION: You establish a corporation and\nthere's the corporation and there's the employee. And the\nfact that the employee happens to be a shareholder of the\ncorporation would have no relevance at common law.\nMR. TROUTMAN: That's right. We're appealing --\nQUESTION: So you're arguing something apart\nfrom common law, something based on what? Based on the --\nthe purposes of ERISA?\nMR. TROUTMAN: Yes, based on the purposes of\nERISA and based on this Court's opinion in the Clackamas\ncase where -- where it looked beyond the corporate\nstructure of the -- of the four shareholders there. And\n-- and in the -- in the footnote it specifically said that\n-- of course, we had the EEOC guidelines of control and --\nand all the others, but -- but the Court went beyond the\ncorporate veil there to say that these four shareholders\nunder the common law may more likely be classified as\nemployers than employee, at least under the ADA.\nQUESTION: But -- but that was because the\nstatute was, we thought in Clackamas, silent on the point,\nand the Government's argument is that the statute is\ncontrolling here.\nMR. TROUTMAN: The Government is arguing that\nthe statute is different in the -- from both Darden and\nClackamas in that it indicates that employees may -- or\nthat working owners may participate. Our response to that\nis two things.\nOne, when you break it down to sole shareholders\nand go back to the purposes of ERISA, you know, the owners\nof the -- employers were not who ERISA -- Congress was\ntrying to protect. It was the employees.\nSecondly, when you look at other provisions like\nthe definition of an employer that says someone working on\nhis -- on behalf of the employee -- when you look at\nsections 1052, 1053 of ERISA that clearly seem to\ndistinguish between an employer and employee, we submit\nthere are other inferences that may be drawn that perhaps\nthe same person cannot function in two different\ncapacities under ERISA.\nQUESTION: I mean, I don't understand what -- I\nthought ERISA is to protect employees --\nMR. TROUTMAN: That's correct.\nQUESTION: -- let's say, other than the owner.\nMR. TROUTMAN: That's correct.\nQUESTION: All right? So we put some of them in\nthe program, and then ERISA says, and by the way, if you\nhave a program like that, the owner can participate in it\ntoo just like an employee. So that seems to be the\npurpose, to make sure you have some employees, and then if\nyou do, you let the owners and the executives, everybody\nelse involved can become as participants if they're\nmembers or former members of the organization at least.\nSo if that's the purpose, how does this defeat the\npurpose? There are some other members and he wants to\nparticipate.\nMR. TROUTMAN: If the -- we submit that what\nthis doctor -- what Dr. Yates is here as a sole\nshareholder is more akin to an employer than an employee\nand that when you start combining his interests with those\nof other employees, that you start to muddy the purpose of\nthe congressional intent --\nQUESTION: No, no, no. I'm just talking in\nterms of purposes. If you're talking in terms of\nlanguage, what they say is, A, the common law would have\nconsidered him an employee of the corporation. B, we have\nthe tax code which says -- doesn't happen to throw him in\nas a member or former member. It says he's a participant\nbecause it says he's an employee. We have the Pension\nBenefit Guaranty code which again refers to him as an\nemployee, and then we have the language of the reg itself\nwhich says he's not deemed an employee for purposes of\nthis section, words which wouldn't have been necessary if\nhe fell -- didn't fall within it in the first place. And\nthen it says, for purposes of this section, which\ncertainly suggests that it could mean just purposes of\nthis section, otherwise he's in it. And just to top it,\nwe have that's what the Labor Department thinks.\nAll right. Now, that seems like a pretty good\nset of considerations.\nMR. TROUTMAN: I understand. I -- I would say\nthat under title IV, Justice Breyer, also the same\nlanguage is there: for purposes of this section. Then it\ndefines a substantial owner. So we submit the same\nlimiting language that's in the CFR is also in the\nprovisions of title IV, and -- and as the petitioner\ncorrectly points out in their brief, title IV does not\napply here.\nSo we think the policies of ERISA are -- are\nfurthered when you separate the two and you -- you know,\nwhere Congress has intended to -- to protect employees,\nand we think when the other provisions of the statute are\nexamined, that -- that this one person cannot occupy these\ntwo positions of employer and employee.\nQUESTION: But as far as the tax exempt part of\nthe plan, that's okay. You agree with -- I think I asked\nMr. Roberts that question.\nMR. TROUTMAN: You did, Justice Ginsburg, and we\ndon't think there's any tax effect here by this decision.\nQUESTION: On the point that would be left over\nfor remand, that is in any event, this was a -- was an\nunlawful preference, was that something that you raised\nbelow?\nMR. TROUTMAN: We did. In fact, Your Honor,\nthat was the very first thing we raised and that was the\nfirst issue we focused on and the -- the bankruptcy court\ninstead chose this issue to rule on and pretermitted the\ndetermination of the other issue. We focused on the\nexception under statutory section 1144, that ERISA is not\nintended to preempt other Federal laws. That decision was\nnot reached by the bankruptcy court.\nAnd we -- we also thought it important -- we're\nnot going after Dr. Yates' interest as an employee in this\nplan. The -- the defendants are the plan administrator\nand the trustee. Under the Bankruptcy Code, our cause of\naction is against the recipient, the plan, for the\nrepayment of the debt not Dr. Yates --\nQUESTION: You want the $50,000 that he paid\nback into the plan.\nMR. TROUTMAN: Yes. Yes, Your Honor.\nSo for those reasons, we think that -- that\nClackamas did not limit us to looking at the corporate\nstructure, and we think that ERISA is considered to\nemployees. And we think the lower courts correctly ruled\nso.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Troutman.\nMr. Holifield, you have 7 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES A. HOLIFIELD\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. HOLIFIELD:\npoint out just a couple quick points here, and that is,\nthere's nothing in ERISA that prevents a person from being\nor playing or acting in multiple roles. That was\ncontemplated all throughout ERISA and it's in the briefs.\nMatter of fact, there's nothing preventing Yates PC from\nbeing the trustee, the plan administrator, the plan\nsponsor, and having all those roles. This Court in Varity\nv. Howe dealt with an individual in one speech who was\npart of the time held to be the employer, part of the time\nheld to be a fiduciary communicating benefits in the same\nspeech. So those roles can happen simultaneously in\ncertain aspects. And so I would point that out.\nAnd the other thing is -- is the term employer.\nThere's nothing preventing a person being an employer and\nan employee. In fact, the definition of employer says\nanyone acting as an employer, a person acting as an\nemployer, and the definition of persons specifically\nincludes individual, partnerships, joint ventures,\ncorporations, unincorporated organizations, associations,\nemployee organizations, mutual companies, this -- this\nhuge laundry list of entities, including down to a single\nperson. So I'd argue that I don't think there's a\nquestion about a person being an employer and even if you\nassumed Yates was a sole proprietor and still being able\nto participate in this plan based on the other regulatory\nprovisions and statutes of ERISA.\nAnd for those reasons, we'd ask that you reverse\nthe decision of the Sixth Circuit and remand it for\nfurther proceedings.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr.\nHolifield.\n"
