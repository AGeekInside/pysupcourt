Coke.
Mr. Farr.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF H. BARTOW FARR
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. FARR: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
In the 1974 amendments to the Fair Labor
Standards Act, Congress made one thing very clear, that
it wanted the Department of Labor to define the
boundaries and fill in the details of the companionship
services exemption. And I think that has two important
implications for this case.
First of all, when the Department has filled
in the details, after notice and comment rulemaking, its
regulations should receive Chevron deference as long as
they are permissible implementation of the statute.
Second, and particularly specific to this
case, if there are ambiguities in the regulations, or as
we have here, an apparent facial inconsistency, the
court should accept the Secretary's resolution of that
ambiguity provided that it is a reasonable one. And
here we submit it's not only a reasonable one, it is by
far the most sensible one.
Now I'd actually like to turn, if I may, to
the second issue first, because I think that's the
source of a lot of the concern in this case.
Plainly the two regulations, section 10 --
552.109(a), which is the regulation directly at issue
before this Court, and 552.3, which is the regulation
relied on heavily by the Second Circuit to strike down
the present regulation, have some inconsistency between
them.
But it is also plain that the Department
could not have intended to say at one and the same time
that the only employers entitled use the exemption were
homeowners and then say in another section promulgated
at the same time that also third-party employers are
entitled to the exemption. So the question is, how does
one resolve this apparent inconsistency?
And the Secretary says, well, the only
regulation that we promulgated that, in fact, deals
specifically with the issue of third-party employment is
552.109(a), which is in fact headed Third-Party
Employment.
And that section 552.3, while containing
some language that might be read to address that issue,
in fact deals with several other topics. Specifically
it deals with the topic of what kinds of jobs are
involved in domestic service, maids, chauffeurs,
footmen, et cetera; where those have to be performed, in
a private home; and in fact, somewhat more than that, in
the private home of the person receiving the services.
So it's not enough, for example, for
somebody to conduct a service like laundry or baby
sitting in his or her own house, it has to be in the
house of the person receiving the services.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought the words were
home of the person who employs, not who receives the
services but who employs.
MR. FARR: Oh, that's correct,
Justice Ginsburg. The literal language is not
specifically what I was saying. What I'm talking about
is the Secretary's attempt to resolve what is an
apparent inconsistency between the literal language in
552.3 and the literal language of section 552.109(a).
JUSTICE GINSBURG: By -- reading out the
words "of the person who employs" her?
MR. FARR: Well, essentially reading them to
say they, they were not intended to address directly the
subject of third party employment which is the subject
addressed in 109(a). And I think if one is -- even
leaving aside the question of deference to the Secretary
for a moment, Justice Ginsburg, if one is simply talking
about making a fair resolution of these conflicting
provisions from the ground up, it seems to me the first
thing that one would do is apply the canon that the
specific provision controls the general.
And if one looks at the two provisions,
section 109(a) is a provision that deals with one thing
and one thing only: that is third party employment.
And it says explicitly and straight out that
persons who are employed by third-party employers are --
or third-party employers who employ persons performing
domestic services are entitled to the exemption.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: I thought it also
addressed, unlike the more general regulation, just
people who have companionship services. So if you have
a maid or a cook or a footman, who doesn't provide
companionship, then 109 is inapplicable.
MR. FARR: That would be true. Now that
would be inapplicable --
JUSTICE SCALIA: What's a footman? I don't
even know what a footman is.
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE SCALIA: What is a footman?
MR. FARR: I think that may be beyond my
expertise, Justice Scalia.
The -- of course that doesn't address
anything beyond companionship services, of course,
because there is not an exemption beyond that. And
that's one of the interesting things about 552.3. In
addition to generally dealing with this question of what
kind of jobs are domestic service, it is, in fact, going
well beyond anything that is necessary to a discussion
of the exemption for companionship services, because
jobs like chauffeurs, and maids, and all of that are not
subject to the exemption. So it really looking at what
552.3 is doing despite the couple of words that -- at
the beginning of it, is giving a general definition of
what constitutes domestic employment, what constitutes
domestic services for purposes not only of the exemption
but, in fact, really for the purposes of coverage as
well.
And the Department has taken that position.
It says this is, in fact, the only definition of
domestic service that we have in the regulations, and it
is not just intended to be limited to the particular
situation of the exemption. It applies more broadly
than that to coverage as well.
So I think in all those senses,
Justice Kennedy, 109 is a very specific provision, 552.3
deals with a number of other subjects.
Now, one other thing on the statutory
interpretation part is that the reading of 552.3 that
Respondent offers also leads to the problem that
essentially sets up a tension with another one of the
regulations which is 552.101(a). 552.101(a) which I'm
sorry -- I don't have the right page number here -- it
is on page 77a of the appendix to the petition -- has,
carries over the language from 552.3 about in the home
of the employer that Justice Ginsburg referred to. But
then it also says that this includes people who are
commonly referred to as private household workers.
And the one thing we know from the
Department of Labor submissions to Congress in 1974 and
also from what the Department has said before this Court
is that that term at the time was defined by the
Department and known by Congress to constitute more than
just employees employed by the homeowner. There was a
special second category for people who worked in the
home of the homeowner at the homeowner's request but
were employed by a third party agency.
Now somewhere underlying all of this
question, I think, is statutory interpretation and
indeed all of Respondent's arguments against deference
to the Department is a basic underlying premise, which
is that Congress really would not have wanted, even if
it didn't say so, for the exemption to apply to
employees who work for third parties.
And I would just like to suggest that there
really is no basis for thinking that Congress would have
wanted that.
First of all, third participate employers
such as private agencies provide services for the
particular group of people which Congress was trying to
assist with this exemption. People who by reason of age
or disability are unable to care for themselves.
Agencies acting as the employers specifically can do the
hiring, they can do the vetting and the screening, the
background screening for employees. They can provide
necessary paperwork, filing Social Security documents
and things like that.
So, in fact, for Congress to have some sort
of bias against covered enterprises seems a little bit
unusual.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Farr, I'm not sure I
followed your argument with regard to 552,101(a).
MR. FARR: Uh-huh. Yes, Your Honor.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Page 77a as you said.
But what is your argument there? I mean,
that seems to, that seems to reinforce the provision
that you say we should ignore or at least should accept
the Secretary's reinterpretation of.
MR. FARR: Well perhaps, perhaps I wasn't as
clear as I intended to be. It does, as I indicated,
have the language about the private home of the
employer.
JUSTICE SCALIA: That's right.
MR. FARR: However, the -- the preceding
sentence says the term, referring to the term that is at
issue in 552.3, domestic service employment, includes
persons who are frequently referred to as private
household workers. The fact is that those two
statements are inconsistent with each other. The term
cannot be limited to employees of the home owner and
also include persons who are frequently referred to as
private household workers, at least if one means all the
persons referred to --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Yeah. I see. Is that
clear in the -- in the specific Senate report that is
referred to here?
MR. FARR: In the specific Senate report, in
both the '73 and the '74 reports --
JUSTICE SCALIA: This, the one that's cited
in the regulation itself. Because I -- otherwise, I
don't, I ignore those things. That's cited in the
regulation. Does that report say it?
MR. FARR: What? The report uses the term
private households workers frequently interchangeably
with the term domestic employees. That is what is clear
from the report itself.
Now, the Department of Labor when it was
reporting to Congress, as Congress has required it to
do, the Department of Labor used the term private
households workers, specifically defined in there by the
Department, to say this means not just employees
employed by the homeowner but also people who are
employed by third parties.
So I think it is a fair assumption that when
the Senate report was using that phrase, it was using it
in the same manner that the Department of Labor reports
have. And, in fact, at one point in the -- moving
further backward in the legislative history, Senator
Dominick actually quoted that language, the definition
from the Department of Labor, on the Senate floor during
the debates.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought that the
Department of Labor's first take on this was that the
exemption did not apply to third-party employers. That
was the original Department of Labor position, wasn't
it?
MR. FARR: No, Justice Ginsburg. I believe
that's correct. There was a, an opinion letter from the
Department in November of 1975 -- this is an opinion
letter that's cited at page 21 of the Solicitor
General's brief -- which specifically stated that the
exemption applied whether the employee was an employee
of the homeowner or of a public or private --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: I'm referring to the
notice and comment rulemaking in which you place great
stock. I thought the original notice and comment
rulemaking said the exemption does not apply to
third-party employers.
MR. FARR: I'm sorry, Justice Ginsburg. I
misunderstood the time frame we were dealing with. In
the notice of proposed rulemaking, actually I would
disagree with that characterization also. The notice of
proposed rulemaking made a division among third-party
employers. It said the exemption would not be available
to those third-party employers who were covered
enterprises but it would be available to those who were
not covered enterprises.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, wait. Does the
notice of proposed rulemaking set forth the agency's
position?
MR. FARR: No, it does not.
JUSTICE SCALIA: I didn't think it did.
They're just floating an idea. You know --
MR. FARR: That's correct.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Run it up the flagpole, see
if --
MR. FARR: Well, that it solicited comments
on that proposal. And after the comments, it changed
its position to say no, in fact, all third-party
employers will be exempt.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: And -- and there was no
further discussion of it after -- after it sent out the
notice of proposed ruling that said third party
employees will not be exempt, and then it said they will
be exempt, did it give reasons for the change?
MR. FARR: Yes, if I can just -- if I can
quibble with the premise of the question. The first
time it said some third-party employers would be exempt
and some wouldn't. Then when it changed --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Some would be the ones
that qualified as -- what is the phrase, enterprises
engaged in commerce?
MR. FARR: That's correct -- those would be
the ones under the proposed rulemaking that would have
been denied the exemption. When in fact -- when, in
fact, the Labor Department said no, in fact, the
exemption should apply to all third-party employers, it
said it found that more consistent with the statutory
language. And it also said it was more consistent with
what it had done under other regulations which had been
passed under the Fair Labor Standards Act.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Farr, would you agree
that the position expressed in the notice itself would
have -- in the original notice would have been
consistent with the statutory language?
MR. FARR: I'm not sure of that,
Justice Stevens, to be honest with you. I mean one of
the difficulties here in answering that is that I think,
because the Department has such broad authority under
213(a)(15) to define and delimit the term, I think
what's consistent with the statute has expanded
somewhat.
On the other hand, I have to say I don't
really see where there would be in the language of the
statute any basis for drawing a distinction between
different kinds of third-party employers. The
phraseology in the coverage provisions, the phraseology
in the exemption provisions, really doesn't allow for
that in terms of any sort of statutory interpretation.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Well there would be a
basis in terms of the size of the third-party employers.
MR. FARR: I mean, it's possible, but as I
say, the -- I mean, among the difficulties that covered
enterprises is not just corporations and big and small
corporations. Covered enterprises beginning in 1974
includes state and local governments. So what Congress
would have been addressing here, if it had been squarely
facing the issue, would have not just been the question
of how to treat large and small corporations, but
whether it wanted to deny the exemption to covered
enterprises such as state and local agencies who, in
fact, do provide a lot of the direct employees who
provide companionship care. They have a lot of
employees who actually go into homes and care for people
who are employed by state and local governments. And I
think it would be a little bit unusual for Congress, who
is reasonably solicitous of state interests, to deny
them an exemption that would have been of considerable
importance to them. As the State of -- or the City of
New York brief points out, this is a very extensive
endeavor.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Were they covered before,
before there was any provision that dealt with household
workers? If state and localities were considered
enterprises engaged in commerce, then presumably they
were -- they had no exemption before, their companion
care people, just as household workers, would be covered
by the Fair Labor Standards Act.
MR. FARR: No, but I think, Justice
Ginsburg, the important point is they were not covered
prior to 1974. There were certain --
JUSTICE SOUTER: They were not treated as
covered enterprises.
MR. FARR: That's correct. They were --
they were, if they worked in schools or institutions
like hospitals. Other than that, they were not until
1974. That's exactly correct. This, in fact, would
have been denying them an exception at the very time
that for other occupations aside from companionship
services, they were first having coverage applied to
them.
If there are no further questions, I'd like
to reserve the remainder of my time.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you Mr. Farr.
Mr. Salmons.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID B. SALMONS
ON BEHALF OF UNITED STATES
AS AMICUS CURIAE SUPPORTING PETITIONERS
MR. SALMONS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,
and may it please the Court.
The FLSA's companionship services exemption
applies by its terms to any employee employed in
domestic service employment to provide companionship
services for the aged or infirm. The Act imposes no
limitation based on the identity of the employer. And
the Agency's regulation of 552.109 extending the
exception to employees of third parties is entitled to
deference.
The Department expressly invoked its
statutory rulemaking authority in adopting Section 109,
552.109. It utilized ed notice and comment rulemaking
procedures both in 1975 and each time it considered
amending the regulation. And States and care providers
have relied upon it in devising systems to provide
appropriate services to the aged and the infirm.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So if the Department
of Labor had enacted its regulations as originally
proposed, those regulations would have been invalid?
MR. SALMONS: No, I don't think so, Your
Honor. If you're referring to the initial proposed
rulemaking that would have exempted only some third
parties, we think that would have been a permissible
reading of the exemption given the fact that the
Secretary is provided very broad defined limit
authority. But we certainly think there's nothing in
that exemption that precludes the construction that's
been adopted here. In fact, we think it is the most
consistent with that language.
The language of 5523 upon which Respondent
relies does not change that conclusion. While if read
in isolation that language could require that domestic
service employees have to provide their services in the
home of the employer, it should be not -- it should not
be given that reading for the reasons explained in the
Department's 2005 advisory memorandum.
The Department's construction of its own
regulations contained in that memorandum is itself
entitled to deference under Our and Seminole Rock and
its construction harmonizes the various provisions at
issue here far better than Respondent's reading of 553
does.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: The statute treats
together babysitters and elder care people, but I take
it the babysitters if they were working for an agency
rather than for the householders, there wouldn't be any
exemption? Is that right?
MR. SALMONS: That's correct, and that's
tied to a specific term that only applies to the
exemption as to babysitters. The only thing that's
exempt with regard to babysitters is babysitting on a
casual basis. Congress certainly could have included a
casual basis requirement with regard to the exemption
for companionship services. We think it's very notable
that it did not and we read from that that Congress
wanted all domestic service employees providing
companionship services to be exempt, and we think that's
most consistent with the goal of ensuring that those
individuals who most need this type of care have the
opportunity to receive them at a reasonable cost.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Isn't it odd that this --
the basic thing about the '74 legislation, it was going
to add to the Fair Labor Standards Act people who were
not covered before. So it added household workers. And
yet you say that, while Congress had its mind trained on
adding people, it also subtracted people who were
covered before, took them out, removed them from the
coverage of the Act.
MR. SALMONS: Well, we think that that is
the consequence of the companionship services exemption,
but we don't think that's odd based on the Department of
Labor's view of what the purpose of that exemption is
and based on the textual difference between, for
example, the exemption for baby sitting services and the
exemption for companionship services.
The exemption here expresses no limitation
based on the identity of the employer and we think it
was well within the agency's discretion to conclude that
what Congress had in mind here was a categorical
exemption based on the type of services that are being
provided; and while that may mean that there are certain
workers who are now exempt who were not previously
exempt, that's because Congress for the first time in
1974 focused on this problem of companionship services
being provided to those who cannot care for themselves;
and we think that follows from the text, and for the
reasons Congress adopted that.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Salmons, can I ask you
a question about the importance of the whole litigation.
Am I correct in believing that there's a provision in
the law that protects the defendants from damages
liability if they relied in good faith on the
regulation, so that what we're really talking about is
whether the regulation would apply in the future rather
than there being a damage issue in the case?
MR. SALMONS: Well, there is a safe harbor
provision that allows for reliance by employers on a
statement by the agency.
JUSTICE STEVENS: That would clearly apply
to this case, would it not?
MR. FARR: We certainly think it would. I
take it Respondents in this case would disagree and
would point to the language of 552.3. I'm not sure, for
example, how the Second Circuit would have resolved that
question, given the way it viewed the statute here. But
we do think that that would apply and so I think one
view of that would be it's largely prospective.
JUSTICE STEVENS: So in your view we're
really faced with a question of whether the regulation
should be given prospective effect.
MR. SALMONS: I'm sorry? What would be
given prospective effect?
JUSTICE STEVENS: As to whether the
Government's position should be given prospective effect
because the past liability doesn't -- the damage
liability just doesn't exist.
MR. SALMONS: Well, that is our view.
Again, I think that would be an issue that would be
litigated and I'm sure litigated heavily in the hundreds
of cases that are being filed under this provision. And
I think it's -- one of the concerns I think of the
agency here was to provide a clear statement with regard
to how these seemingly conflicting provisions of the
regulation are to be reconciled and applied.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Not seemingly
conflicted. They conflict.
MR. SALMONS: Well, I certainly don't take
issue with that. I think that there are a variety of
things that point to the conclusion that the language in
552.3 that refers to "in the home of the employer"
simply cannot be read literally. It was borrowed from
the Social Security context and if read the way
Respondents do we think would raise a serious question
about the scope of coverage because the agency has
always viewed 552.3, notwithstanding the initial line
that says "For purposes of the exemption," to provide
the relevant definition for coverage as well. And no
party, or amici for that matter, before this Court nor
the Department thinks that there's a difference between
the identity of the employer for purposes of coverage.
And we also think, given the language in 101 that refers
to private household workers, the definition of which
was provided to Congress in a report by the Department
of Labor and is relied upon in the advisory memorandum
in 2005, which clearly applies to third party employers,
suggests that 553 cannot be read literally.
And of course we know that at the same time
that the agency adopted 552.3 it felt the need to adopt
a specific regulation dealing with the question of
third-party employment which would not be relevant --
which would not be necessary under Respondent's reading.
If the Court has no further questions --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,
Mr. Salmons.
Mr. Becker.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF HAROLD C. BECKER
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. BECKER: Mr. Chief Justice and may it
please the Court:
On October 1, 1974, just five months after
the 1974 amendments to the Fair Labor Standards Act took
effect, the Department of Labor exercised its delegated
law-making function to define this term "domestic
service employment," which exists in the companionship
exemption and nowhere else in the amendments. And they
defined its clearly and explicitly to apply only to
companions and baby sitters employed by the household.
At the same time, DOL provided a persuasive
explanation for that definition. The Department found
that such companions and baby sitters when employed by
covered enterprises had been covered prior to the
amendments and that it could not have been Congress'
purpose, when amendments were explicitly designed to
extend coverage, to at the same time contract coverage.
The very preamble to the Act states that the purposes of
the amendments are to expand the coverage of the Act.
Therefore, the DOL itself concluded in October of 1974
that it was not the purpose of those amendments to deny
the Act's protection to previously covered domestic
service employees.
The definition in 552.3, which expressly
applies only to the exemption, conflicts directly with
the final third-party regulation.
JUSTICE BREYER: Was that later?
MR. BECKER: Yes, Your Honor.
JUSTICE BREYER: How much later?
MR. BECKER: The final regulations were
promulgated in February of 2005.
JUSTICE BREYER: No, no. I thought that the
provision that was -- what is the number -- - where they
say 552.109; that didn't appear anywhere until many
years later.
MR. BECKER: No, no, Your Honor. That was
in the final regulations, which were promulgated in
February -- excuse me -- in 1975, not 2005.
JUSTICE BREYER: I mean, you read --
MR. BECKER: In the final regulations.
JUSTICE BREYER: You read 3 and 3 says what
you said it says. All right. How much later did they
promulgate 109?
MR. BECKER: That was in the final
regulations in February of 75.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The same time that
552.3 was finally promulgated.
MR. BECKER: That's correct.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: They came out
together, right?
MR. BECKER: That's correct.
JUSTICE BREYER: That's what I thought. So
the same day they say, 3, you have to have these
domestic workers employed by the old lady who's sick,
and then in 109 they say you don't.
MR. BECKER: That's correct. There's a
direct conflict.
JUSTICE BREYER: All right. Now, why is
that a conflict? Let's imagine -- it sounds like a
conflict. But it's easy for me to imagine a regulation
that says birds for purposes of this are animals that
fly, and then 15 pages later it says, but by the way,
penguins don't and they're still covered. I mean, why
is that a conflict? There are lots of specific
situations. If I read that, I would have thought, well,
okay, they have an exception.
MR. BECKER: Your Honor, the definitional
regulation, 552.3, explicitly defines a term used only
in the companionship services exemption, "domestic
service employment." And it defines it clearly and
explicitly to apply only to employment by the household.
Therefore, there is a direct conflict with
the so-called third party employer regulation, which
appears to say that the exemption can apply to employees
employed by third parties.
The importance of the conflict is twofold.
One, when the original regulation was proposed the
Department provided a persuasive explanation. Congress
surely didn't intend to contract coverage in amendments
designed explicitly to expand coverage.
JUSTICE BREYER: Did Congress intend to
cover, which I guess is a growing situation, that there
is an old woman or man and they're very sick and they
live in their house, there's only one way to keep them
from having to go to an institution. Their children
hire a companion to look after them. Now, that's a
third party.
MR. BECKER: Your Honor, that question has
been posed by some of the amici and it is a good
question, but not the question before you.
JUSTICE BREYER: Because?
MR. BECKER: And I submit that if the
Department construed section 552.3 to say when our words
say "employed by the household" that could include a
broader notion of the household, for example a son or
daughter living outside the household, that might be a
permissible construction of the Department's own
regulation. But the construction which simply takes
those words --
JUSTICE BREYER: It doesn't say that. It
says "about, in or about a private home of the person by
whom he is employed." I live in San Francisco. My
mother lives in Massachusetts. Now, if I hire a
companion to live in Massachusetts, that companion does
not work about a private home of the person, me, by whom
she is employed. So if we're being literal and if you
win this case, I don't see how -- and I'm worried about
this, obviously -- however -- and I think it's probably
very common, that all over the country it's the family,
the children, the grandchildren, an aunt, an uncle,
maybe a good friend, maybe they're not even related, who
is paying for a companion for an old, sick person so
they don't have to be brought to an institution.
And if you win this case, it seems to me
suddenly there will be millions of people who will be
unable to do it and, hence, millions of sick people who
will move to institutions. Now, if I were to say that
that isn't totally a legal point, it is of course a
legal point because it's a question of what people
intended, but a worrisome point, I would be telling the
truth. It is a very worrisome point.
MR. BECKER: It's a very important question
of public policy and therefore let me answer in two
ways. One, I think there is a proper procedure even
under the existing regulations to address that concern.
The elderly individual that you're concerned about who
is severely disabled and thus needs this care, the child
or family member who is employing the companion to care
for them could do so as their guardian, and therefore as
a technical legal matter would be doing so, the
employment would be by the person who resides in the
home.
JUSTICE SCALIA: It wouldn't take a whole lot
of imagination for Justice Breyer to give the money to
his mother, who could then hire.
MR. BECKER: Exactly.
JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, a clever lawyer
would think of that, I think.
(Laughter.)
MR. BECKER: A clever lawyer could do this.
JUSTICE SCALIA: And perhaps there are
people, lawyers in the Government, who try to see
through that kind of thing.
MR. BECKER: But let me answer the second --
JUSTICE BREYER: And there are many -- maybe
Justice Scalia has the answer.
MR. BECKER: Let me answer a second way to
what is a serious concern. And the second way the
situation could be dealt with is by the Department of
Labor. They could look at their regulations and say,
the industry has changed and therefore, in a way which
could certainly be consistent with Congress's intent
because it would not be withdrawing coverage from a
previously covered employee who was employed by an
enterprise, we could say that the exemption applies to
companions and baby sitters employed by private
individuals, including the homeowner, the son or
daughter, etcetera.
JUSTICE STEVENS: You're saying it's
permissible to change the rules because the industry has
changed. Is it not possible that the industry changed
at about the time the statute was enacted? That the
prevalence of third-party employers is something that
really developed later?
MR. BECKER: As an empirical matter, that is
clearly the case, Justice Stevens. However, we know
several things about Congress in 1974. We know that the
enterprise coverage was relatively new. They adopted it
in 1961, expanded it in 1966, and indeed expanded these
very amendments in 1974. So Congress was aware of the
prior coverage. We know that the Department of Labor,
in the very reports which have been cited by the
petitioner, stated both in January of 1973 and in
January of 1974 in their reports to Congress on the Act,
stated that there was prior coverage of domestics
employed by third parties. We know there was
enforcement activity by the Department of Labor against
such third-party employers.
So while the industry has certainly changed,
there were enterprises who employed domestics, including
companions, in 1974, and Congress was aware of it and
stated over and over again in the preamble, in the
committee reports, which indeed, the House committee
report said, "Our intention is to expand the act to the
extent of Federal power."
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How -- putting aside
-- putting 552.109 aside, how is 552.3 a plausible
interpretation of the statute?
MR. BECKER: Your Honor, we think it is the
most plausible interpretation for the following reasons:
Number one, contrary to what has been
suggested, the language in the exemption is not
identical to the language in the extension provision
extending the minimum wage and overtime requirements.
There is an important difference, and that difference is
the word employment. Now that's important for several
reasons. Number one, of course, coverage provisions are
to be read broadly and exemptions narrowly. So there's
an additional word that can and would suggest it should
be read as a term of limitation.
Number two, that difference must be given
significance, if possible. The word should not be read
to mean the same as the coverage provisions when it
doesn't exist in the coverage provisions.
And number three, we should avoid
redundancy. There is a reading of that unique language,
"domestic service employment", which makes sense and in
fact, is exactly the reading given by the Department.
Congress did not intend to --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What employment
would someone who's hired by a third party be engaged in
if not domestic service employment?
MR. BECKER: The word domestic service
employment is not necessary to describe what you
described, Mr. Chief Justice. If that is what the
Congress intended to describe, it could have said simply
an employee employed to provide companionship services.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it could have said a
lot of things. But I find it -- you're hanging your
case upon the proposition that there is a difference
between domestic service employment and employed in
domestic service employment.
Wow. You know, I just don't see how there's
any difference in those two at all.
MR. BECKER: Your Honor --
JUSTICE SCALIA: You're saying we have to
find some difference no matter how imaginative the
difference might be. If there were a difference, I'm
not sure it's the difference that you're arguing for.
MR. BECKER: What I'm suggesting is not that
our case relies or hangs on that word. What I'm
suggesting is if that word, that phrase, "domestic
service employment", is given the definition which the
Department of Labor itself gave it, it avoids reading
two phrases which are different to mean the same thing.
It avoids redundancy. And moreover, it is wholly
consistent with every other piece of evidence we have
about Congress's intent.
Even the Department of Labor suggested it
surely could not have been Congress's intent to retract
coverage. The definition is consistent with that.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Can I ask you what your
proposal is with regard to the contradictory
regulations, 552.3 and 552. -- what is it, 109?
I think they are contradictory.
Now, the Agency has come up with a solution.
We will interpret the former quite unrealistically to
mean something that it doesn't seem to us to say but --
you know -- close enough for government work.
What is your solution for solving the
inconsistency? Are both of the regulations bad?
MR. BECKER: My solution, Your Honor, has
two parts but leads to the same conclusion. Our
solution is that in applying the Act, which is the
question here, does the Act apply to Ms. Coke's
employment, this Court should apply the definitional
regulations for two reasons, the definitional regulation
for two reasons. One, it is the regulation, which no
one disputes, and was promulgated in the exercise of the
Department's law making function. The Department
expressly defined and delimited its term "domestic
service employment" in 552.3 and expressly said it was
not doing so in the third-party regulation. So it's
entitled to greater deference for that reason. But
moreover --
JUSTICE SCALIA: What's your other reason?
MR. BECKER: It is the only definition which
makes sense, which doesn't lead to a whole series of
problems.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Because of employed and
domestic employment versus --
MR. BECKER: For --
JUSTICE SCALIA: -- domestic service?
MR. BECKER: For the following five reasons,
Your Honor. One, it avoids reading a term in the
statute, not only a term in the regulation but a term in
the statute, completely out of the statute. And that is
the term "employment".
Secondly, as the Department found, it is
consistent with what was Congress's clear intent, to
expand and not to contract coverage.
Thirdly, if one looks at the debates, and
there was extensive and vigorous debate about these
amendments, the exclusive focus in Congress was the
household. The opponents were exclusively concerned
with the extension of coverage to the households. So
applying the exemption to protect only household
employees is wholly consistent with what was Congress's
exclusive --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you're getting into
arguments now that are not about the regulation but
they're about the statute. I'm assuming that we have
regulations that are entitled to deference. And you
have two regulations that are conflicting. Now, how do
you decide which one prevails? Counsel for the other
side says the specific governs the general, certainly an
ancient prescription.
Counsel also says that this is an agency
regulation. The agency is given great deference in the
interpretation of it own regulations. And even if the
agency had said well, you know, they do conflict, we
admit it, they totally conflict, we won't even try to
reinterpret 552.3, we think that's the one that's wrong,
why wouldn't we accept their statement to that effect?
MR. BECKER: Your Honor, of course setting
aside, as you do, our argument that Congress has
specific intent on this question, looking only at the
regulation --
JUSTICE SCALIA: That's statutory. I just
want to focus on the regulation arguments, not the
statutory --
MR. BECKER: Let me answer in several ways.
First, this Court has clearly held that an agency does
not have unbounded discretion to construe its own
regulations. When the terms of the regulations are
unambiguous, they cannot be construed away. Now here --
JUSTICE SCALIA: They aren't unambiguous.
They contradict each other. The agency has to do
something about it, and here the agency made a choice.
Even if I assume the choice was, we're going to
disregard 552.3, we're going to strike out those words,
they were the mistake. One or the other had to be the
mistake. We decided it was this one. Why shouldn't we
take their word on it?
MR. BECKER: Again, for two reasons, Your
Honor. There's a difference between conflict and
ambiguity. The words are unambiguous, and it's not
simply the -- there's two sets of words which they
attempt to read out of the regulation, one of the
unambiguous words that require employment by the person
who's living in the home, and the other is the prefatory
language which says the regulation only applies to the
exemption. So in the guise of deference, the Solicitor
General and the petitioners actually suggest to this
Court that it should take apart the regulation and
ignore two of its three operative provisions.
JUSTICE ALITO: But if they're flatly
contradictory, doesn't your argument have to be that
.109(a) has lesser status? That's what it boils down
to, isn't it?
MR. BECKER: That is certainly my primary
argument, that this statute is relatively unique in that
it vested two very different sorts of authority in the
Department of Labor, one a clear law making authority to
actually define and delimit, to specify what the terms
in the law mean --
JUSTICE ALITO: I'm talking about what you
think the Department of Labor was doing when it
promulgated 109(a). It was thinking in effect the
following: We have the power to issue a regulation here
that has the force and effect of law, and we're going to
go through the procedure that would be necessary to
issue such a regulation. But we're not invoking that
power here because we want this interpretation which we
think is the correct interpretation of the statute not
to be followed -- not to get as much deference from the
courts as it would if we were invoking our power.
Does that make any sense? That an agency
would proceed in that way?
MR. BECKER: Your Honor, it not only makes
sense, it's been the Department's pattern since the Act
was adopted. That is, the Department since the Act was
adopted has split its regulations into those under the
exemptions -- for example the primary exemption for
professional, executive and administrative employees --
has split its regulations under those exemptions into
those which define and delimit, into those which do not
define and delimit, or other general statements that
apply to their interpretation.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Yeah, but interpretive
regulations are in other areas wholly valid before the
courts and entitled to Chevron deference, at least if
they're adopted by notice and comment rulemaking. You
know, we have nothing, what should I say, subordinate
about interpretive regulations. In fact, probably most
of the significant regulations of the most important
agencies are interpretive regulations.
MR. BECKER: The important difference here,
Justice Scalia, is the statute. The statute, like the
tax statute which was interpreted by this Court in Vogel
and Rowan, creates two types of authority. And not only
under the Fair Labor Standards Act, but --
JUSTICE SCALIA: I understand that you say
it creates two types, but there is no indication that it
intended one type of authority to be entitled to less
respect from the courts than the other. What do you
rely on for that?
MR. BECKER: Your Honor --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Where is the proposition
that an interpretive regulation is somehow not a
full-fledged binding regulation?
MR. BECKER: Well, let me qualify the
question, if I might. The Petitioner would suggest that
we're relying on simply a label, this is in the
interpretive section and the other is in the general
regulation section. Far from it. We are relying on a
very clear statement both in the regulations, 552.2(c),
as well as in both the proposed regulations and the
final regulations, which clearly state that only those
in Part A define and delimit. Why is that an important
distinction? It's an important distinction because
Congress clearly meant these two grants to be different.
Otherwise, why would it have granted an express power to
define and delimit which would otherwise be redundant of
the general rulemaking authority?
JUSTICE SCALIA: They're different but not
necessarily of different -- entitled to different
respect from the courts. A defined -- what is it,
define and delimit? These are regulations that don't
even purport to be an interpretation of any language in
the statute, but the use of authority given to the
agency to cut out certain areas, to say the -- this rule
won't apply to companies over this -- that can't
possibly be an interpretation of the statute.
So Congress says we're going to give the
agency that authority. In addition, of course, we're
going to give this agency the authority that every other
agency has, which is to interpret -- interpret the
language of the statute.
MR. BECKER: Well, Your Honor, I think we
can safely assume in 1974 when Congress created these
two types of authority, it did so with knowledge of the
law. And this Court, if you compare its decision in
Addison to its decision in Skidmore, clearly itself
distinguished between the exercise of those two
different interpretive or rulemaking authority. Clearly
in Addison, construing a very similar term in a
different exemption, giving the Department of Labor the
power to define a particular term in the exemption, said
that is law making authority. And we will follow what
the Department of Labor says unless it's clearly
inconsistent with the statutory -- with Congress's
intent.
In Skidmore, where that type of expressed
delegated law making authority to define and delimit was
not at issue, the Court said we will record only that
degree of deference to which the regulation --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Skidmore was before a
rather significant case called Chevron.
MR. BECKER: Absolutely, Your Honor. But it
was also before the 1974 amendment. So if the question
is, what was Congress intending in creating two types of
rulemaking authority, the power to define and delimit,
and the general rulemaking authority, I think we need to
consider Congress's intent at that time.
JUSTICE SCALIA: You mean we're going to
divide all administrative law now into those -- those
regulations -- those provisions that were adopted by
Congress pre-Chevron and those adopted by Congress
post-Chevron, and for the ones adopted pre-Chevron we're
going to treat regulation as essentially suggestions by
the agency which we give Skidmore deference to, and the
ones after Chevron, we're going to treat differently.
Do you have any case of ours that suggests something
like that, which seems to me a very strange manner of
proceeding?
MR. BECKER: Let me answer in two ways, Your
Honor. One, it would not be any case. Here we have a
particular statutory scheme that is contrary to --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Ought not to get as
much deference from the courts.
MR. BECKER: Here we have a case essentially
described by Justice Kennedy in & Haga, where we have a
different statutory scheme combined with a explicit
statement by the Agency as to which part of that scheme
the Agency is operating under. But the case I would
cite, or the cases would be Rolo and Rove which have not
--
JUSTICE BREYER: Since we're into that,
we're into this fascinating subject, I thought that
possibly they had -- they promulgated the whole thing
pursuant to the rulemaking power under that particular
statute, because that's what it says in 552.2. It says
"this part" -- it doesn't say subpart, it says part --
and part is 552. And both regs we are talking about are
in the part. And B says interpretations, but they don't
mean interpretive rules, because when you look at those
interpretations, they have a whole lot of numbers in
them, and divide by 32. Nobody thinks that Congress
meant in this statute divide by 32, as opposed by divide
by 33.
So as I read that, I thought the whole thing
is promulgated pursuant to their rulemaking authority;
Part A has more general things. Part B has more
specific things. Where am I wrong?
MR. BECKER: Well, I think the question,
Your Honor, is which of the regulations were promulgated
pursuant to the specific authority --
JUSTICE BREYER: All of them. All of them
is what it says unless I missed something.
MR. BECKER: Well, I think what you missed
is that a simple citation to the exemption does not
translate into an exercise of the power to define and
delimit. Because the Department was very, very specific
as to when it was exercising that power. In 552.2(c) it
says the definitions required by the legislation are
provided in the following sections and it enumerates
them and does not include the third-party regulation.
Now Petitioners would suggest well, that's
just a definition. They also have the power to delimit.
However, both the notice of proposed rulemaking and the
notice of final rulemaking said that we are exercising
our power to define and delimit in subpart A.
JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. I got the point.
MR. BECKER: But part B is different.
JUSTICE BREYER: Right. Right.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So why are you sure
there's a conflict in the first place? You know, 552.3
says that the term domestic service employment refers to
services performed in the home of the employer. It
doesn't say it only refers to that. And then you go
down and 109 says it also includes employees who are
employed by a third party.
I mean, can't they be reconciled in that
way.
MR. BECKER: I don't think so, Your Honor.
And its certainly not the way that the --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's not the way the
Agency has done it. But you don't think we should defer
to them, anyway. So --
(Laughter.)
MR. BECKER: That's correct. But the
regulation -- 552.3 defines the statutory term which
only exists in the exemption, domestic service
employment.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yeah, but it says it
refers to something. It doesn't say as many of these
regulations and statutes do, is, you know, it is defined
as.
And particularly when you're confronted with
what would otherwise be a conflict, maybe refers to
should be read to mean includes rather than is defined
as.
MR. BECKER: Well, I think we have to read
the definitional regulations together. That is, all of
the terms in the exemption, companionship services,
babysitting services, casual basis, domestic service
employment, are all defined in the set of regulations,
point 3, point 4, point 5, point 6. And it is clear
from the prefatory language of each one that what the
Department of Labor intended to do was define the terms
in the statute.
And so when it said that that term refers
to --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well it is
interesting when you look at -- I mean, they're -- it's
a good point. It's interesting when you look at the
other definitions, the babysitting, it says this
provision shall mean. Here it just says it refers to.
Let's see, the other ones -- casual basis,
shall mean. Companionship services, shall mean.
This one doesn't say shall mean. It says it
refers to this. I'm just wondering if that's something
that suggests it's not intended to be as exclusive as
the other definitions.
MR. BECKER: I do not believe so, Your
Honor. It is an exercise of the power to define the
term and I don't think we can take that language "refers
to" to be non-exclusive. When the Department said
referred it was defining a statutory term as it said it
was. If we have any doubt about what the Department
intended, it actually of course reiterated that
definition under the interpretive classification. And
it again said that the term refers to, is defined as,
employment by the household. If we had any doubt --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Becker --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: There it says
--there it says includes. And if you're talking about
552.101, there it says the term includes persons
frequently referred to as private household workers.
MR. BECKER: I'm referring to an earlier
provision of the same regulation, not the reference to
private household workers, but where it states that the
definition includes those individuals who are employed
by the household, that is in 552.101(a). But if we had
any further doubt, the -- that regulation refers to, as
its source of the language, the regulation adopted under
the Social Security Act, now 20 CFR 404.1057. It was
originally numbered differently, but at the time, in
1974, that regulation which was explicitly the source of
the language the Department of Labor used, said not
once, not twice, but three times, that the individual
had to be employed by the household.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. -- Mr. Becker, if
there is room for the Agency to read this statute either
way, one way that the third party employee would come
under the Fair Labor Standards Act, the other that they
would not, would be treated the same way as the person
employed by the elderly person himself or herself, but
if the concern of Congress in making this exemption was
for the householder with limited funds, if the Agency is
subject to the Fair Labor Standards Act, it's going to
end up being the householder paying for it anyway.
So why isn't the most reasonable
interpretation of what Congress meant by the exemption
that the exemption would apply across the board, so that
all workers in this category would be exempt?
MR. BECKER: Your Honor, setting aside, of
course, all the reasons about Congress's intent in 552.3
which we've already explained, we would not say that
that there is any credible evidence in the legislative
history or the text of the Act to suggest that cost was
a factor.
And let me explain why. The Department for
the first time when it promulgated its advisory
memorandum suggested this was the basis of the third
party regulation. It said nothing of the sort in 1975.
As support for the assertion it cited four isolated
comments in the legislative history. None of them
except the last -- and there is only one of t-h-e-m
related in any way to the exemption. The one that
related to the exemption in fact directly supports our
position, because it describes those people who are not
within the exemption as the professional domestics.
So we don't think that there's any basis for
suggesting that cost was the underlying rationale; and,
in fact, it is really implausible. Because at the same
time, for example, Congress extended the provisions of
the Act which covered nursing homes. At the same time,
as has been pointed out, Congress only exempted casual
babysitters. Now We would submit that if Congress was
concerned about cost, in creating this babysitter and
companionship exemption, the primary intended
beneficiaries of that would have been working families
where both people worked and therefore who require a
full-time baby sitter --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel.
MR. BECKER: -- and a full-time baby is not
covered.
Thank you very much.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Farr, you have
three minutes remaining.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF H. BARTOW FARR,
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS
MR. FARR: Thank you Mr. Chief Justice.
Respondent in response to Justice Scalia's
question about how Respondent would reconcile the
regulation 552.3 and 109(a) actually did not I believe
attempt any reconciliation. If I understand
respondent's position correctly, it's simply 109(a) has
to be invalidated dated and 552.3 stands in its
entirety.
I think that's incorrect for several
reasons. First of all, the basis for it is essentially
this apparent distinction between the define and delimit
authority and the more general authority to enact
necessary rules and regulation. But, in fact, as
Justice Breyer pointed out in his question, both grants
of authority were invoked by the Department when it
enacted both regulations simultaneously, not limited to
either subpart A or subpart B, and for the reasons that
Justice Alito points out, it is a very odd thing to
attribute to the Department to say that it would
exercise two different legislative powers in different
parts of the -- of the regulations.
There's no reason it would do that. The
subpart B regulations clearly are regulations that
delimit the terms of the exemption in 213(a)(15).
There's no question about that. So why in fact if it
was doing what Congress authorized it to do under
213(a)(15), would it instead of relying on the grant of
authority in that provision, rely on some other general
grant of authority? It makes no logical sense to
attribute that to the Department.
And it seems to me, in -- excuse me -- in
fact, that that argument points up one of the
difficulties here. It seems to me that the arguments
here are a way of simply trying to push the Department
aside so that the courts can ultimately do the final job
of exposition on this exemption. Not only contrary to
the basic principle of Chevron, which is where that
where is ambiguity in the statute, or room for
interpretation, the agencies are given the opportunity
to do that within reasonable bounds; it is also contrary
to the statute.
It is clear as I said at the beginning of my
argument, the Department was the agency chosen by
Congress to do the work of defining and delimiting the
exception.
Now I'd like to say just one other thing in
response to Justice Stevens' question about the
particular nature of the litigation. This is a suit for
damages. It is a suit claiming will damages.
Thank you, Your Honor.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel.
