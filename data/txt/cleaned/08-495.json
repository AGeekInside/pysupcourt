MOSELEY\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. MOSELEY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nAt issue in this case is an aggravated\nfelony definition, 8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(43)(M)(i), one that\nserves both as a ground of deportation and as an\nintegral part of a Federal criminal statute.\nFor the Court's convenient reference,\nbecause I suspect we will return to this and the other\ndefinitions, I would refer the Court to the statutory\nappendix in the government's brief: 3a gives (M)(i); 6a\ngives the conviction requirement; and 7a to 8a gives the\nunderlying criminal statute in which this aggravated\nfelony definition forms an integral part.\nNow, Congress has required -- for\ndeportation, Congress has required conviction of this\ndefined offense, in a definition that says absolutely\nnothing about the word \"tether\" utilized by the Third\nCircuit below, and the definition begins with a\nrestrictive clause, \"that,\" to require conviction of\nboth the fraud and deceit element and also the loss\namount as an integral part of this definition.\nSince Congress required conviction, the\ntime-honored categorical approach really should be the\ngoverning standard, and I submit that there's nothing in\nthe plain language of the statute, the underlying\nstatute enacted by Congress, to oust that time-honored\napproach, which I submit is perhaps on a par as being\npresumptively applicable, similarly to the -- to the\nstay standards that this Court discussed very recently\nin the Nken case.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Another --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Under the time-honored --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, please.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Under the time-honored\napproach, if the jury verdict necessarily -- or not\nnecessarily, but did in fact refer to the amount\ninvolved and it was over $10,000, would that be part of\nthe time-honored approach and then the statute would be\nfulfilled?\nMR. MOSELEY: I -- under those\ncircumstances, Justice Kennedy, yes. But here the jury\nwas specifically instructed that they did not have to\nmake any finding with respect to loss in this case.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, in that connection,\nat some point in the argument -- and you may be a little\nearly because you're talking about the statute -- I'd\nlike to know either anecdotally from your experience or\n-- or because it's written somewhere, how often do\njuries give special verdicts? It actually applies in\nthe second case we're to hear as well. And has that\nchanged in the light of -- of Apprendi? In -- in my\nexperience, we just didn't know many of the features of\nthe crime from -- from the jury verdict, and I just\nwould like to know if that's changed in this day and\nage.\nMR. MOSELEY: Well, I -- I --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But you may reach that\nafter you've talked about the statute.\nMR. MOSELEY: Yes, but let me -- certainly\namong the State statutes that we cite, the State\nstatutes where it's clear that a loss amount is an\nelement, the jury is going to be instructed they have to\nreturn that, and they do. The -- the special verdict\nopportunity here is in effect, I would submit, a kind of\nlifeline, if you will, that we're giving to the\ngovernment in these -- in these more general fraud\nstatutes, where the government has that -- certainly has\nthat opportunity or that option to do. But there\ncertainly have been -- and I know we cite them in our\nbrief -- cases --\nJUSTICE ALITO: And if you -- if you do\nextend that lifeline to the government, aren't you\nconceding that the amount of the loss is not an element\nof the offense, and aren't you conceding that it is not\nnecessary for the loss amount to be an element of the\noffense?\nMR. MOSELEY: No, Justice Alito. What I am\nsaying is that this statute -- and again, (M)(i) was\nenacted as part of a number of criminal statutes --\nexcuse me -- as a number of provisions that were\naddressed to white collar offenses, of which this is\njust one, and it also encompasses the State -- it also\nencompasses the State statutes where this clearly is --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, let me give you a\nconcrete example. Let's say it's a Federal mail fraud\ncase. Let's say there are two Federal mail fraud cases,\nand you don't have to prove the amount of loss in order\nto convict under the mail fraud statute. In the first\ncase, after the jury returns a guilty verdict they also\nreturn -- or together with that they answer a special\ninterrogatory and they say the loss exceeded $10,000.\nIn the second case, the defendant pleads guilty and\nadmits during the plea colloquy that the amount is more\nthan $10,000. Would there be a problem in those cases?\nMR. MOSELEY: In those cases, no. In those\ncases, that would have satisfied the traditional\ncategorical approach.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: In this --\nJUSTICE ALITO: And then --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: In this case, how many of\nthe defendants were alien? You're -- the jury is given\na charge that covers all of the defendants. They're all\ncharged with the same crime. How many of them were\naliens?\nMR. MOSELEY: I believe two in addition to\nMr. Nijhawan, Justice Ginsburg. I believe two or three\nmore were. This case -- this case involved roughly 15\ndefendants. There are only five who went to trial. The\nnumber who -- the number who are aliens, in addition to\nMr. Nijhawan, I believe were two.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Then the judge wouldn't\ndistinguish -- it would not be relevant for the -- for\nthe defendants who were not aliens because it would have\nno consequences for them. So why should the judge --\neven if the question could be asked, why should the\njudge -- the judge takes a position: It's not an\nelement of the crime. Therefore, I'm not going to\ncharge it, and I'm not going to confuse the jury by\nsaying as to the defendants who are aliens, you have to\nfind the amount.\nMR. MOSELEY: Well, under -- under those --\nunder those circumstances, Justice Ginsburg, Mr.\nNijhawan actually himself had asked for a charge with --\nwith respect to loss. I don't think -- I don't think\nthere's an issue of jury confusion here, and indeed\nunder -- under -- ironically under this Court's -- well,\nthis would have been a situation in which a request was\n-- could have been made. I don't think there would have\nbeen -- there certainly wouldn't have been jury\nconfusion to have requested it here.\nBut I think you have to put this in -- in\nthe larger picture of a statute of a set of aggravated\nfelony definitions that were enacted.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But before you go on to\nthat, we're talking about (M)(i). It's coupled with\nanother provision that's an offense that is described in\nsection 21 -- 7201 of Title 26 -- that's tax evasion --\nin which the revenue loss to the government exceeds\n10,000. So it's the same \"in which\" construction, and\nthere's no requirement -- to convict someone of tax\nevasion, the jury does not have to find the deficiency.\nMR. MOSELEY: Well, actually, Justice\nGinsburg, under this Court's decision in Boulware, a\ndeficiency is indeed a necessary element of that --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: A deficiency, but not the\namount of the deficiency.\nMR. MOSELEY: But -- no. A -- a deficiency\nis a necessary element of that offense. That's --\nthat's where, for example, the Babaisakov decision got\nthat point flatly wrong. And this is, I think, the\nclassic --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But is the amount --\nthere's a deficiency. The jury has to find in order to\nfind tax evasion there is a deficiency. Does it have to\nfind that the revenue loss to the government exceeds\n$10,000?\nMR. MOSELEY: No, it doesn't have to find\nthat, but it may. And this is a classic example of the\napplication of the modified categorical approach, where\nthis statute sweeps broadly to include both loss amounts\nor, in this case, revenue loss amounts that would exceed\n$10,000 and those that would be less than $10,000. Most\nof these cases, most of the tax cases, as the\ngovernment's own materials that we cite indicate, are\nresolved by guilty pleas with respect to where those\namounts are designated. And I think it's important here\nto realize that by pairing these two statutes, by\npairing these two provisions, (M)(i) and (M)(ii),\nCongress in effect I submit sent the signal with that\nlanguage in (M)(ii) that we're talking about the kind --\nwe're talking about the application of the modified\ncategorical --\nJUSTICE ALITO: What is the -- What is the\ndifference between a defendant's saying during a guilty\nplea colloquy, the loss was -- I admit the loss was more\nthan $10,000; and the defendant's agreeing for\nsentencing purposes that the loss was more than $10,000?\nMR. MOSELEY: Because, Justice Alito, in the\nsentencing context we're truly dealing with a\npost-verdict situation where the government in terms of\nhaving to prove loss is up against a far lesser amount\n-- a far more liberal standard, a preponderance of the\nevidence standard. And the defendant under those\ncircumstances --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, if he's admitting it,\nwhat does the standard of the evidence matter?\nMR. MOSELEY: He's admitting it here,\nJustice Souter, under these circumstances. He's\nadmitting it here only in the context of a resolution of\nthe sentencing issue. If you go back to the --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, he's not saying, I\nadmit to a degree of preponderance of the evidence that\nit was over 10,000. He's saying, period, over 10,000.\nThe burden of proof, the standard of proof doesn't\nmatter.\nMR. MOSELEY: No, but he's -- but he's doing\nthis in the context of resolving, of resolving a\ndisputed issue with respect to --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And he definitively\nresolves it by admission.\nMR. MOSELEY: But he does so certainly in\nthe context of reserving, of reserving his right to\ncontest that and to make the arguments that we're making\nhere.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, I understand the facts\nof this case. I was commenting on your answer to\nJustice Alito's question, and it would seem to me that\nthe answer to the question is there is no difference.\nMR. MOSELEY: No, I submit -- I submit that\nthere -- there really is a -- a profound difference\nunder the circumstances of someone being in a situation\nbefore, before conviction, and then someone being in a\npostconviction situation. And then I think we should\ncome back in terms -- we should come back to the\nunderlying, to the underlying requirement that the\nperson had been -- the person under the statute be\nconvicted of the loss.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: All right, that really gets\nto the question that I was going to ask, and that is, I\ndon't see how the modified categorical approach is\nsomething that you could admit would be sufficient\nbecause, as I understand your argument -- and it is in\npart an argument based on sort of standard grammatical\nconstruction -- you're saying that in the definition\n\"The term 'aggravated felony' means an offense that\" --\nand you emphasize the \"that,\" the restrictive nature of\nthe \"that\" clause -- \"involves fraud or deceit in which\nthe loss exceeds $10,000.\"\nif I understand your restrictive clause argument,\nthe definition of the offense has got to include the\nelement of exceeding $10,000 or it does not satisfy\nyour, the -- it does not satisfy the standard that you\nwere arguing for based on the restrictive clause. So it\nseems to me that you've got to go the whole hog or you\nget nothing, and the whole hog is that it's got to be an\nelement of the offense that the loss exceed $10,000. Am\nI wrong?\nMR. MOSELEY: I don't think necessarily.\nWell, under these circumstances, Justice Souter, what I\nwould say is that there may be statutes, there may be\nstatutes in which, there are statutes, there are State\nstatutes, where you have a range of conduct that may\ninclude $10,000, may not include $10,000, and the\nmodified categorical approach would apply under those.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay, how about this one.\nYou were arguing based on this statute and you make an\nargument based on the restrictive nature of a \"that\"\nmodifying clause, and if you're going to make the\nrestrictive clause argument, it seems to me you've got\nto go the whole hog and say the element of the offense\nhas got to include the loss in excess of $10,000.\nMR. MOSELEY: Certainly if it does, then\nunder the statutes involved here we would prevail.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, yeah, you would\nprevail, but you would prevail, it seems to me, at the\nexpense of this objection, and the government makes it.\nThere are very, very few fraud and deceit statutes that\ndefine the offense by reference to a loss in excess of\n$10,000. My recollection from the government's brief is\nthat they come up with three.\nThe fact is also that this provision, the\n$10,000 figure, was placed into the statute at a time\nwhen Congress was trying to expand the category of\ndeportable, removable offenses, and it would be passing\nstrange in that context to define the offense by\nreference to a $10,000 figure as an element of the\noffense which would cut it down, which would cut the\ncompass of the statute down to three offenses. What is\nyour response to that?\nMR. MOSELEY: Well, I think the government\nvastly understates the statutory provisions that were\ninvolved here. Even if you look at the State statutes,\na majority of the State statutes, as I think we make\nclear in our reply brief, a majority of States have\nstatutes, generally the theft by deception statutes and\nothers which have loss thresholds that will get you over\n--\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, once you get into the\nState statutes you get into the further problem of an\nutter and I would suppose unjust patchwork of statutory\nreference to which this would apply. If you -- if you\nsteal the $11,000 in State A, you get booted out of the\ncountry. If you steal it across the State line in State\nB, you stay home. I mean, I can't imagine that Congress\nwould have enacted that kind of scheme.\nMR. MOSELEY: But what Congress has done\nhere is to provide for a uniform test, in effect.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: A uniform test that\nproduces both unjust results and I would suppose\nstrangely unsatisfying results to a Congress that wanted\nto expand the concept of deportable offense.\nMR. MOSELEY: But what -- but what -- if I\ncan just go back for a moment, Justice Souter, to the\noriginal premise that it under all circumstances has to\nbe an element. There are certainly statutes, even\nFederal statutes, for example, the theft from Federal --\nfederally funded programs, which give specific loss\namounts of 5,000 or more, which would -- which -- excuse\nme.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But the problem is that\nthere's no pattern to it, The point that Justice Souter\nmade. If we take your position that there are a number\nof statutes that mention amount, some as an element,\nsome by this, there seems to be no rhyme or reason to\nwhen the amount is there and when it isn't, and then you\nhave these unequal results within the Federal system and\nin the States, so when you think -- would it make any\nsense for Congress to have drawn the line that way if\nthe State happens to make -- to have the \"in which\" or\nif it just has fraud and deceit with no amount?\nMR. MOSELEY: What -- Justice Ginsburg, I\nthink what Congress did here was to create a uniform\ntest, a uniform test in the sense you look to see if --\nif someone has been convicted of both these\nrequirements, fraud or deceit or the loss. That\ncertainly produces far more uniformity than had --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But it's treating people\nwho do the identical thing differently.\nMR. MOSELEY: But Congress chose under these\ncircumstances, Congress chose under these circumstances\nto -- swept broadly to, swept broadly to State statutes\nin addition, in addition, in addition to, in addition to\nencompassing the Federal statute.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But what you're saying is\nyou're not denying that people who commit the identical\ntheft or deceit or fraud will be treated differently\ndepending on whether the statute under which they're\nconvicted has this \"in which\" clause?\nMR. MOSELEY: What I believe, what I believe\nthat I am conceding is that it will determine -- as with\nany of the criminal cases that lead to deportation, it\nwill determine -- it will be determined on the basis of\nhow the prosecution chooses -- excuse me -- chooses to\ncharge.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Moseley --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Moseley, can I get\nyour help on a question I really have difficulty with.\nIt seems to me as I read the text, it is easy to read it\nin one of two ways: It involves fraud or deceit in\nwhich the loss to the victim in fact exceeded $10,000.\nIn that case you would lose. Or it could be read to say\ninvolves fraud or deceit in which an element of the\ncrime is that the victim or victims exceeded a loss of\n$10,000. You would lose under that also because it is\nnot an element of the crime.\nSo you are relying on a modified approach,\nand under your modified approach what does the statute\nsay?\nMR. MOSELEY: The -- the statute -- the\nstatute says that someone has to be convicted of -- of\nboth these aspects, both of --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But the statute doesn't\nsay anything about conviction.\nMR. MOSELEY: If, Justice Stevens, if you\nread it in conjunction with the conviction\nrequirement -- in other words, to -- to be deportable,\nto be deportable, that's in -- in 6a. Someone who has\nbeen convicted of an aggravated felony is deportable;\nand also someone who has been convicted of an aggravated\nfelony is subject to, under -- under --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't -- I don't\nunderstand how you squeeze your -- your modified\ncategorical approach, which seems to be a deus ex\nmachina which is intended to blunt the government's\nargument that very few statutes would be covered by\nthis. I don't see how you get that out of the word\n\"convicted.\"\nAre you convicted of an offense involving\nmore than $10,000 if in a separate interrogatory the\njury, though it has no obligation in order to find you\nguilty to say how much you stole, in an interrogatory\nthe jury says, oh, yes, the amount was more than\n$10,000? Does that cause you to have been convicted of\nthat? You are convicted of what you are charged with.\nYou are convicted of the elements of the offense, not --\nnot of whatever, whatever the judge chooses to allow the\njury to be questioned about.\nMR. MOSELEY: I think under those\ncircumstances, though, particularly if you look at the\nstatutes which make gradations of sentencing on the\nbasis of loss amounts, you clearly would be convicted of\nthat. It is -- because that's a necessary element\nthat's going to -- that's a necessary fact that's going\nto have to be found to put you in a particular\nsentencing range. So you -- so you definitely would be\n-- you would be under those circumstances convicted of\nthat amount.\nBut I think it's important to -- to\nrecognize what -- that Congress -- that Congress in\nenacting the statute and in predicating removal upon\nconviction used language that sharply distinguishes --\nthat is sharply distinguished from the position that the\ngovernment advocates here that loss should be something\nto be determined in separate -- in -- in separate\nremoval proceedings.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Can we go back to my\nquestion, which I don't think you've fully answered?\nAnd that's the tax evasion situation. For any tax -- a\nperson who is charged with tax evasion who goes to trial\nand is convicted, that person would not be deportable,\nas I understand it under your reading, because the jury\nis not asked to determine the amount of the deficiency.\nMR. MOSELEY: Well, the jury -- under those\ncircumstances, it will depend upon how the government\nchooses, Justice Ginsburg, to prosecute the case. And\nif the government chooses to prosecute the case by\nseeking a determination of the deficiency amount in a\njury charge, then -- then, yes -- then, yes, indeed,\nthey would. But again, the vast majority of these cases\nare resolved.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I know. You told me that\nmost of them admit it at the plea stage. But going to\ntrial, these are parallel provisions, and it seems to me\nthey are meant to operate the same way.\nMR. MOSELEY: Well, they -- they are -- they\nare meant to operate the same way. But I think that\nwhat we have here is a situation where the fact that\ndeficiency is a requirement and that deficiency in most\ncases will be established by a plea, and that this is a\nstatute that sweeps broadly; that this is a statute that\nsweeps -- excuse me -- sweeps broadly to encompass both\na loss in excess of 10,000 -- a deficiency in excess of\n$10,000 or a deficiency under $10,000.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Did you have any authority\nfor the -- the idea that a trial judge in a criminal\ncase should ask the jury to answer a special\ninterrogatory regarding a question that has no bearing\non the conviction, but may have a bearing on the future\nimmigration status of the defendant, which is what\nyou're suggesting should be done in these tax cases?\nMR. MOSELEY: What -- what I am suggesting\nin the tax case is that it would be perfectly\nappropriate for the government to seek such a special\ninterrogatory if they wish to establish the tax loss,\nwhich is an element of the -- which is a necessary\ncomponent of the offense, if they wanted to establish it\n-- if they wanted to establish it for -- for purposes --\nfor whatever purpose they wanted to establish it.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But I can see that if\nthere are multiple defendants in the case, some of the\ndefendants might say that this is unnecessary, it's\ninflammatory.\nMR. MOSELEY: That's -- that's -- that --\nagain, that is going to depend on -- that's going to\ndepend upon how the government chooses to -- to\nprosecute under these particular --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But all that just\nunderscores the fact that --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- your earlier -- your\nearlier assertion that it was necessary to -- that --\nthat it would be necessary to get that -- that amount\nspecified for sentencing purposes is simply not true. I\nmean, we didn't -- we didn't hold that the guidelines\nare mandatory, and you -- that you need a -- a jury\ndetermination. We've said they are discretionary.\nMR. MOSELEY: No, I --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So if you don't have a jury\ndetermination, you can still sentence on the basis of\nthe amount taken, even though that was not found by the\njury.\nMR. MOSELEY: I -- I understand. But my --\nmy point, Justice Scalia, on this one is that -- on\n(M)(ii) is that it is -- it is a statute in which -- in\nwhich loss can or is required to be shown, some\ndeficiency is required to be shown, and this may -- and\nthis may well be done by the modified -- the modified\ncategorical approach, particularly in -- in --\nparticularly in situations in which, as in most cases,\nit's resolved by a plea.\nNow, if -- if -- but -- and also, this\nstatute was enacted against the backdrop of -- of the\ncategorical approach, and the act was amended -- has\nbeen amended roughly four times during this period with\nno indication that Congress certainly intended to\njettison this. And I think it's also important here to\nnote the structure of the act in terms of how Congress\nsharply distinguished between what would happen with\nconviction and -- and what would happen with sentence.\nThey did enact specific provisions,\n101(a)(43), subpart (F) at 2a of the statutory appendix\nand (G) at 2a of the statutory appendix, which talk\nabout -- which -- which talk about sentencing and make\nthat sharp distinction.\nBut I think we should not also lose sight of\nthe overarching fact here that this provision is an\nintegral part of a Federal criminal statute, 1326(b), so\nthat any ambiguity in the -- so that an ambiguity in the\nconstruction and application of this statute should as\n-- similarly to -- to what this Court held in Leocal,\nshould be resolved in favor of the -- in favor of the\nalien, because it's the classic multiple or dual use\nstatute that has both civil and criminal applications,\nand very severe criminal applications as well.\nI see I have 5 minutes. If there are no\nfurther questions, I would like to reserve the time for\nrebuttal.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I hope in rebuttal you'll\naddress the argument about deferring to the agency's\nfinding about what it means. We usually do that.\nMR. MOSELEY: The -- I will -- I will --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You can save it for\nrebuttal.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Gannon.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF CURTIS E. GANNON\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. GANNON: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nPetitioner's reading of subparagraph (M)(i)\nimplausibly excludes the mainstays of Federal fraud\nprosecutions and applies at best to a tiny handful of\noutlying offenses: Thefts of major works of art,\nextreme cases of government contract fraud, and some\nfrauds obtaining confidential phone records and --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, except -- except for\nhis modified hangout. His modified -- his modified\ncategorical does -- does expand; doesn't it?\nMR. GANNON: Well, I -- I think, Justice\nScalia, that he does offer this -- this variation on a\nso-called modified categorical approach by saying that\nwe could use extraneous facts in guilty pleas in order\nto satisfy the categorical approach. But we think that\nthat doesn't work for both practical reasons and for the\ntypes of reasons that -- that several of the questions\nraised in the first half of the argument --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And also interrogatories to\nthe jury.\nMR. GANNON: He does seem to contemplate\nthat interrogatories for the jury might also achieve the\nsame purpose. But as Justice Alito was pointing out,\nthere -- there is little reason to believe that a judge\nis going to permit such extraneous questions to be put\nto a jury that are -- that are not necessary for the\ncriminal proceeding that is actually being held at that\npoint. It's unlikely that the government wants to make\nthe entire -- wants to imply that the conviction needs\nto turn on that.\nAnd obviously, both with the -- the special\ninterrogatories and the guilty pleas, there are\npractical problems, because this could only apply\nprospectively, even though Congress's definition of\naggravated felonies is intended to apply to convictions\nthat predated the enactment of IIRIRA. It -- I just\nmean that it would not be until we knew that this was\nthe rule, that we could implement such -- such a rule.\nAnd it's not clear why any alien who would be contesting\nhis removability in the civil removal proceedings would\nconcede in the -- in a guilty plea or to a fact that is\nextraneous to that conviction that would ultimately --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But this -- but this\ndefendant did ask, didn't -- he asked the judge.\nMR. GANNON: Well, he did not ask the judge\nfor a finding of loss. He -- he asked for an\ninstruction -- for a special interrogatory as to \"the\namount of money my client is responsible for.\" That's\non page 14a of his opening brief. And that's not the\nrelevant question for purposes of the loss threshold in\nsubparagraph (M)(i), which is actually about the -- the\nloss to the victims from the offense involving fraud or\ndeceit, not how much any individual defendant might have\nbeen responsible for. And even now --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but then you\njust -- you, the government, says -- you know, you'll\nhave a little debate about what the special\ninterrogatory, how it is phrased, and your objection\nthere could be dealt with on -- during that negotiation.\nMR. GANNON: Well, and at that point he --\nhe -- we -- we presumably wouldn't want to have to prove\nup a loss at that point that's irrelevant for purposes\nof the criminal guilt proceeding, although it may well\nbecome relevant for the sentencing proceeding, as it did\nbecome relevant here, and there was a sentencing\nstipulation.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And -- and why would you\nbe reluctant to do that? Would you just spell that out\na little bit?\nMR. GANNON: Well, I -- I think that it\ncould confuse the jury. Even if it were clear that it\nhad nothing to do with a determination of guilt, that\nwould be a particularly odd sort of bifurcation to\nthrust upon the original criminal proceeding, to require\nthe jury to make findings about facts that are truly\nextraneous to the purposes of the criminal proceeding\nthat is being held there, and for -- at least for guilt\npurposes, there is no reason for the jury to have to\nfind that.\nAnd as -- as the questions before were\nmaking clear, the reason this Court has applied the\nmodified categorical approach is to determine what is\nnecessary for the underlying conviction. That's why\nit's tied to an investigation into what really were the\nelements of the underlying offense. And interrogatories\nabout facts that were not, in fact, necessary for the\nconviction or -- or extraneous facts that are introduced\ninto guilty pleas do not change the fact that that\nparticular attribute was not necessary for the\nconviction.\nAnd so, we think that it makes sense, in\ncontext of the other definitions in paragraph 43 of the\ndefinition of aggravated felonies, where it is\nindisputable that there are multiple provisions that\ninclude both an element that needs to be evaluated as an\nelement of the offense and some other limiting factor\nthat need not be an element of the offense; that it\nmakes sense to construe the loss threshold in\nsubparagraph (M)(i) as something that need not be an\nelement, because the consequences of Petitioner's\napproach would be to read out virtually all Federal\nfraud prosecutions, including such mainstays as mail\nfraud, wire fraud, conspiracy to defraud the government,\nbank fraud, the offenses that were at issue here.\nAnd he does offer a patchwork of some State\noffenses that could be satisfied. But even there,\nthere -- there's not any particular consistency to it.\nHe invokes the Model Penal Code, which has a gradation\nscheme for theft by deception offenses. And although\nthe BIA has -- has acknowledged that theft by deception\noffenses may in certain circumstances constitute fraud\noffenses, the Model Penal Code does not in the next\nchapter dealing with forgery and fraudulent practices\nhave a consistent gradation scheme.\nSo even in the States that Petitioner cites\nin his reply brief, Delaware doesn't have monetary\nthresholds for insurance fraud, even though it does for\nhealth care fraud; and New Jersey doesn't have monetary\nthresholds for credit card fraud or payment card fraud,\nand so a million-dollar fraud would not be -- would not\nbe treated consistently, depending upon which State it\nwas committed in and even which type of fraud it was in\nan individual State, if the State --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Could I ask you this, does\nthis -- which is not exactly on point to the issue here,\nbut does the government have a theory about how the loss\nis measured for purposes of this statute? Under the\nsentencing guidelines, the loss was a very complicated\ncalculation, lots of rules about relevant conduct and\nlots of cases and different ways of proving loss, and\nhere we just have the statute.\nMR. GANNON: Yes, we think that it is not\nnecessarily the same as the loss determination that\nwould be made for sentencing. And so, the board has\nmade it very clear that even though a restitution order,\nfor example, can be sufficient evidence of loss to the\nvictim, that it needs to be assessed with an eye to\nexactly what losses were determined in the underlying\nrestitution order and with regard to the burden of proof\nthere. And so --\nJUSTICE ALITO: What if you have somebody\nwho participates in a -- in a scheme involving\n$100 million, the total loss is $100 million, but this\nperson had no way of reasonably anticipating that this\nwould be the -- the total amount of the loss, this was a\nminor participant, and -- where would the -- how would\nthat come out?\nMR. GANNON: Well, I think that the text of\nthe statute here in subparagraph (M)(i) talks about an\noffense that involves fraud or deceit in which the loss\nto the victim or victims exceeds $10,000. And so, we\nthink that the loss threshold is tied to the offense\nthat involves fraud or deceit, not to the individual\ndefendant's role.\nIf he's convicted of a $100 million fraud or\nin this case what may well have been a $683 million\nfraud, he is -- that -- that is the offense of which he\nwas convicted, and it is an offense in which the loss to\nthe victims exceeded $10,000. And so we think --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Does the judge, when he\narrives at the restitution amount, have discretion to\nsay, as to this particular defendant, he was just an\naccountant with the company that was committing the\nfraud, he didn't put anything into his own pocket except\nthe salary they paid him, so I'm going to exclude him\nfrom the restitution order?\nMR. GANNON: Yes, Justice Ginsburg, in\ngeneral the -- the judge does have discretion to -- to\nadjust aspects of the restitution order on the basis of\nthe facts of the underlying offense. And that's --\nthat's one of the reasons why I think the board has been\nsensitive to the idea that the restitution order does\nnot necessarily determine what the amount of loss is\ngoing to be for purposes of --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You -- you wouldn't allow\nthat exclusion to have any effect on deportation, would\nyou?\nMR. GANNON: It would depend upon the facts\nof the underlying case. If the underlying fraud was one\nin which the victims lost nor than $10,000 and we could\nprove that by clear and convincing evidence in the\nremoval proceeding, then -- then we think that we would\nnot be bound by the judge's discretionary refusal to\nimpose a restitution requirement on the particular\ndefendant.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So in -- in my very\nhypothetical --\nMR. GANNON: Depending upon the facts of the\ncase, yes, Justice Ginsburg, in your hypothetical if we\ncan prove by clear and convincing evidence that the\namount of loss associated with a fraud offense was more\nthan $10,000, we think that would satisfy.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Even -- even though this\ndefendant did not pocket any gain?\nMR. GANNON: Yes. Yes, Justice Ginsburg.\nIt's not a pecuniary gain threshold. It's a loss to the\nvictim threshold. And -- and although the judge may\nwell take that into account for purposes of restitution,\nit doesn't change the metric that Congress chose to\ndetermine which types of frauds are serious enough to be\nconsidered aggravated felonies.\nIn 1994, they -- they picked a threshold of\n$200,000. In 1996, they dropped that to 5 percent of\nthat value, to $10,000. I think Congress's judgment\nhere is that if the fraud is so severe that it --\nthat -- that somebody -- that the victims lost $10,000,\nthen -- then that is a qualifying offense for purposes\nof subparagraph (M)(i), even if the original criminal\nsentencing judge, on the basis of all sorts of factors\nassociated with the case and under the restitution\nstandards, decided that the defendant was not\nnecessarily liable to pay restitution in that amount.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What about the\ndefendant's argument that at least as far as his\nadmission for sentencing purposes, he did that only\nbecause otherwise the government wouldn't ask for a\ndownward departure?\nMR. GANNON: Well, I -- I think that we are\nnot taking the position that the -- the stipulation for\nsentencing purposes, which was pursuant to (6)(B)of the\nguidelines and was for stipulation purposes -- we're not\narguing that that is -- is dispositive in the -- in the\ncivil removal proceeding. We're arguing that it's\npersuasive evidence of the amount of loss here.\nAnd so, he's -- he is certainly able to say\nbefore the board or before the immigration judge that --\nthat for some reason the amount that he admitted to\nisn't really the -- the actual amount of loss associated\nwith the case. That's not what he has done here. He\nhas -- he has consistently tried to establish that --\nthat this -- these -- this gargantuan loss amount was --\nwas not one that was found by the jury, not that it was\nnot in fact the loss that actually accrued in\nassociation with the --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But your position -- I\nwant to be sure I understand it -- is that if the record\nin this case had been -- let's say it's a mail fraud\ncase, they proved one mailing and one victim lost $30,\nand that's all the trial established, but as a matter of\nfact you could establish this was part of a scheme, just\nlike the one we've got here, in which millions of\ndollars were lost, you could prove that independently\nand he would still be required to be deported?\nMR. GANNON: Not necessarily, Justice\nStevens. If the conviction was for the entire scheme,\nthen we could bring in the amounts that were relevant to\nthe scheme. But if --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But the scheme -- the\nevidence of the scheme consisted of just two mailings,\nsay. They allege a scheme and say it's a broad -- a\nbroad scheme, but they don't describe the amount. They\nmerely prove two mailings that involved $25 apiece. But\nthe scheme itself, because you proved it in other cases,\nyou have the facts, actually was a big scheme like we\nhave here. Could they rely on that for -- for\nimmigration purposes in a proceeding like this?\nMR. GANNON: It's possible. I think it\nwould depend upon exactly what we could determine had\nactually been associated with the original --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: You can determine exactly\nwhat you proved in this case.\nMR. GANNON: Well, I -- if we had that\namount of evidence in this case, we had sentencing\nstipulations and all sorts of determinations at the time\nof the sentencing where the defendant did not even try\nto argue that this wasn't actually the amount of loss\nassociated with his offense and conviction, then we\nprobably would be able to establish by clear and\nconvincing that the --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I'm not -- I -- I'm losing\nyou. I would -- I would have thought that you have to\nhave convicted him of the larger scheme.\nMR. GANNON: I -- I thought, Justice Scalia,\nthat that was the premise of Justice Stevens' question.\nThat that --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, it was.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, I didn't --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But it didn't describe the\ndimensions of the scheme. As far as the record shows,\nit only affected -- it was one scheme that was as large\nas this one, but the evidence to prove the scheme only\nrequired you to prove two or three mailings involving\nsmall amounts of money. But then later on you proved\nbefore the immigration judge there really was a big\nscheme, and that's the one he was convicted of. Isn't\nthat enough?\nMR. GANNON: Well -- I think that it's\nunlikely if we didn't have the evidence contemporaneous\nwith the trial.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: You had the evidence, but\nyou didn't need it.\nMR. GANNON: Well, I -- if it were like\nthis, we had the evidence contemporaneous with\nsentencing, with $100 million stipulations and things\nlike that, and that makes it obviously much easier for\nus to prove the extent of the underlying fraud.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I know it's easy; I'm\nwondering if it's necessary. I -- I think under your\ntheory, it would not be necessary. As long as the\nevidence is out there, you can use it in a de novo\nproceeding before the immigration judge.\nMR. GANNON: If -- if that were, in fact,\nthe scope of the conviction, because it was for -- for\nthe entire fraudulent scheme, then that may well be so.\nObviously, that -- the cases that have applied the --\nthe tethered approach, to use the word that Petitioners\ninvoked here, are cases in which the -- the courts and\nthe BIA have recognized that sometimes it is necessary\nto recognize that there's a distinction between what the\ndefendant actually pleaded guilty to. If the defendant\npleads guilty to only an individual account, that's\ninvolved in the scheme --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: No, my -- he pleads guilty\nto the mammoth scheme proved, the evidence before the\ncourt or on the plea colloquy, whatever is described is\nenough to show that he was guilty.\nMR. GANNON: Well I --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But then as I understand\nit, you can prove the size of the scheme later on.\nMR. GANNON: I -- in those circumstances I\n-- I think that we may well be able to prove that in the\nsecond proceeding.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I would -- I thought\nthat was the whole case we had before us, Where you\nhaven't proved either as an element or -- or by a\nseparate jury finding how much money was involved. Your\npoint is you don't have to.\nMR. GANNON: Well --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You can establish that\nlater.\nMR. GANNON: Yes, that's right, Justice\nScalia, and as long as it is the scope of the scheme\nthat -- that he was convicted --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I suppose your answer,\nit's your first argument, it's the -- it's the offense.\nMR. GANNON: Yes, yes, Justice Kennedy.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And if for Blockburger\npurposes or for double jeopardy purposes, you couldn't\nretry him for those other -- for that additional loss,\nthen that's -- I assume your argument is that that's\nincluded within the offense for which he was convicted.\nMR. GANNON: As long as the offense were in\nfact the scheme rather than an individual instance of a\nmailing, that's correct; and so I think that that --\nthat that is consistent with Justice Stevens'\nhypothetical and that we would in those circumstances be\nable to -- attempts to prove by clear and convincing\nevidence in the civil removal proceedings that the loss\nassociated with the offense, which was the scheme rather\nthan just an individual mailing, then -- then we would\nbe able to prove that. Given --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Your position is that in\nancillary, subsequent proceedings anything you prove\nthat's within the offense convicted -- say, as measured\nby double jeopardy purposes, as protection against\nmultiple prosecutions, that you can make that showing?\nMR. GANNON: Well, with -- here it's --\nwe're not trying to prove a separate criminal offense.\nWe're trying to prove that the offense --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: That's my point.\nMR. GANNON: Yes.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I take it that that's your\nwhole argument.\nMR. GANNON: Yes, that it -- this is the\noffense of conviction. This is just like the domestic\nrelationship prong of the misdemeanor crime of domestic\nviolence that the Court decided in its recent decision\nin United States v Hayes, that -- that there is a prior\nconviction, some aspects of which were elements of the\nunderlying offense, and in order to establish whether\nthe prior conviction needs the statutory definition in\nthe subsequent proceeding, the government will need to\nbear the appropriate burden of proof for that\nproceeding. Whether it's --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But the appropriate\nburden of proof was beyond a reasonable doubt. That is\nin the second proceeding, the recidivist, the multiple\noffender proceeding --\nMR. GANNON: Yes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- the relationship,\ndomestic relationship had to be proved beyond a\nreasonable doubt, which is not the standard that the BIA\nused.\nMR. GANNON: I -- I think it was beyond the\nreasonable doubt in the context of the 922(g)(9)\nprosecution --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes.\nMR. GANNON: -- because that was itself a\ncriminal proceeding, and that's right, Justice Ginsburg.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, yes.\nMR. GANNON: We think that if this\ndefinition were -- were to be applied in the criminal\ncontext, then we would need to prove this aspect, the\nloss threshold.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: That's what you're\ntalking about, the alien who is convicted of a\nqualifying crime, an aggravating felony, then tries --\nthen comes back illegally. The difference between two\nyears and 20 years, you admit there you would have to\nprove beyond a reasonable doubt?\nMR. GANNON: Yes, Justice Ginsburg, just to\nbe clear it's -- there's already a 10-year statutory\nmaximum that applies under 1326(b)(1) for the prior\nconviction for a felony. I think that's something that\ncan easily be established through the categorical\napproach and we would not need to have a \"beyond a\nreasonable doubt\" determination in the illegal reentry\nproceeding under 1326 to determine it's a felony.\nBut in order to determine that it is an\naggravated felony, as long as we could not satisfy\nthrough a categorical approach to demonstrate that it\nwas an element of the offense in the original\nproceeding, then, yes, I agree; we would need to meet\nthe relevant burden of proof in the 1326(b)(2)\nproceeding.\nNow, as it happens, this -- the extra\n10-year statutory maximum at issue in 1326(b)(2)\neffectively never gets litigated because the sentencing\nguidelines arrange for aggravated felony enhancements in\nthat context for crimes like subparagraph (M)(1), ranges\nfrom 21 months on the low end with no criminal history\nto 5 months on the high end with criminal history of 6.\nAnd so this effectively -- the extra 10 years of\nstatutory range is never employed by -- by judges for\nthese types of crimes.\nIn the last three years, according to\nsentencing commission data, there isn't a single\ndefendant in the 1326 proceeding who received a sentence\nof more than 10 years and had an increase on the basis\nof an aggravated felony that would include the category\nthat we're dealing with here in subparagraph (M)(1).\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Gannon, we're\ndealing with the definition of a particular term,\naggravated felony. And yet you say the only thing that\nyou have to prove under the protections of criminal law\nto prove that this is an aggravated felony is that it\ninvolved fraud or deceit. Now, the other elements --\nthe other provisions here talk about firearms offenses,\nchild pornography offenses, national security offenses,\nbut here it's fraud or deceit. I mean, it's a felony,\nbut there's nothing that strikes -- strikes me that it's\nparticularly an aggravated felony.\nMR. GANNON: Well --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And yet that's all\nyou have to prove with the protections of the criminal\nlaw as opposed to the civil.\nMR. GANNON: Well, I think we have to prove\nfor purposes of the relevant proceeding in which we're\ntrying to establish that it is an aggravated felony that\nit also exceeded the $10,000 threshold.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But not subject to\nthe protections of criminal law that you have to show.\nMR. GANNON: No more --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Beyond the\nreasonable doubt, with the jury protections.\nMR. GANNON: Well, we would need to prove\nthat if it were relevant to a criminal proceeding, but\nin the civil removal proceeding those protections aren't\nthere. And so we --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes, I guess what\nI'm saying, the only thing that makes this aggravated,\nthe $10,000, in contrast to the other things, which are\naggravated by virtue of elements that you have to\napprove -- you have to prove beyond a reasonable\ndoubt -- is that it's fraud ir deceit. And as I said,\nthere's nothing about that that -- it's bad, but it\ndoesn't strike me as particularly aggravated.\nMR. GANNON: Well, Mr. Chief Justice, there\nare several other statutes here that have extra limiting\nfactors that are necessary to make the crime an\naggravated one for purposes of the aggravated felony,\nbut don't have to be proved as an element of the\noriginal offense. Congress has established --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's just --\nI think that's kind of begging the question. You assume\nthat those elements, those provisions also don't have to\nbe proved as elements. And what I'm suggesting, I\nguess, is that if the only thing that makes it\naggravated is -- is something you don't have to prove\nbeyond a reasonable doubt, it seems that we ought to\nlook, well, is that really aggravated?\nMR. GANNON: Well --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And when you're\ntalking about firearm offenses, or child pornography,\nyes, that's aggravated; but fraud and deceit is kind of\na run of the mine felony.\nMR. GANNON: Well, but for many of the\noffenses it's things that as Petitioner acknowledges,\nwould never be proved as elements of the offense. It's\nthe notion that a crime of violence is one in which the\nterm of imprisonment is at least one year. There are\nother ones that depend on the actual sentence that was\nimposed.\nThere is a second or subsequent offense\nthat's referred to in subparagraph (J); there is an\nexception for purely political offenses from the\ndefinition of -- of crime of violence. There are\naffirmative defenses --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I guess I\ndon't understand how that's responsive. It's -- it's --\nMR. GANNON: Well --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- part of violence.\nIn other words it seems to me you're already in the\naggravated area, so it makes sense to say that's what\nyou have to prove.\nMR. GANNON: But not according to Congress.\nIt is only in the area, if it is not a purely political\noffense, and if the term of imprisonment is at least one\nyear. And so by definition, it already can't be an\naggravated felony according to Congress if it doesn't\nmeet other factors that we would not have expected the\noriginal jury to determine as an element of the original\ncrime of violence.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I -- I guess I don't\nunderstand the answer, and I'm sorry if it's --\nMR. GANNON: Well, I'm the one that's sorry.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- I'm hard to get\nthrough.\n(Laughter.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It just -- you're\nsaying is that there are exceptions, but I don't see\nthat that detracts from the point that \"crime of\nviolence\" -- you think right away, well, that's\naggravated; national security crimes, that's aggravated;\nfirearms offenses, that's aggravated. They're sort of\non their own without respect to these other things that\nyou say you only have to prove by the civil -- pursuant\nto the civil burden requirements. Fraud or deceit -- as\nI guess I've already said, that doesn't strike me as\nparticularly aggravated.\nMR. GANNON: Well -- and I think that's --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What makes it\naggravated is something as to which you have a much\nlighter burden.\nMR. GANNON: Well, it's -- it's not a much\nlighter burden in the sense that we do, for purposes of\nthe civil removal proceeding, need to establish it by\nclear and convincing evidence, and -- and it is, in --\nin a subsequent criminal proceeding, there will be all\nthe constitutional protections that you're talking\nabout, just like the domestic relationship prong of the\n-- of the crime that the Court considered in Hayes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I -- I would have thought\nyou would not accept the Chief Justice's premise, that a\ncrime of violence is an aggravated felony.\nMR. GANNON: Well, I --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It isn't.\nMR. GANNON: I tried to explain that it is\nnot as long as there isn't a sentence that is imposed of\nat least 1 year according to Congress's way of\ndetermining what is an aggravated felony, and Congress\nhas determined that --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But the -- but the Chief\nJustice points out that the facts that make the fraud\naggravated are facts that you do not have to prove\nbeyond a reasonable doubt, which takes back to your\nopponent's argument. Therefore, you were not convicted\nby proof beyond a reasonable doubt of the aggravated\nfelony that's the basis for the immigration order.\nMR. GANNON: Well, that's correct, Justice\nStevens, but in -- in that regard --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: So you were not convicted\nof the aggravated offense that -- the issue in this\ncase.\nMR. GANNON: Well, no, we think that you\nwere convicted of the offense, which is an offense that\ninvolves fraud or deceit, and then there is the further\nlimitation that Congress has imposed, not as an element\n--\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But the -- but you hadn't\nbeen convicted of the aggravated offense until you\nestablished its aggravation by proof of less -- not\nunder a reasonable doubt. So the word \"convicted\"\nreally is pretty important.\nMR. GANNON: But it -- it can't have that\nsame meaning with regard to all of these other things in\nall of these other offenses in which Congress has\ndetermined they're not an aggravated felony until those\nother criteria are also satisfied. I mean -- so we\nthink that in a statute that indisputably involves\nindividual offenses that have both elements of the\noffense and nonelement limiting factors in order to\nlimit the category to those that Congress would have\ndeemed to be aggravated, that it makes sense to not have\nto find as an element of the offense those extra factors\nthat generally wouldn't be for most of the other\nprovisions. And here we know if that reading is imposed\non this statute, that it reads out all the mainstays of\nFederal fraud prosecutions and brings in a haphazard\npatchwork of --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It depends on how you read\nthe language. I guess -- I guess grammatically it could\nbe read either way. You can read it: an offense that\ninvolves fraud or deceit in which -- in which the loss\nto the victim exceeds $10,000. Or you could read it:\nconvicted of an offense that involves fraud or deceit,\nin which the loss to the victim exceeds $10,000.\nI mean, \"convicted\" doesn't necessarily\napply to the last -- to the last phrase.\nMR. GANNON: And we --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- and that's basically\nwhat we're arguing about.\nMR. GANNON: And we think --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: No, but the word\n\"convicted\" -- the question is whether the word\n\"convicted\" applies to the word \"aggravated.\" That's\nthe point, as I understand the Chief Justice's\nquestioning, which goes to the burden of proof. So you\nwould win even under that approach if you said you had a\nproof beyond a reasonable doubt of the other factors.\nBut the thing that creates the -- the\nmissing link is that to convert it from ordinary fraud\nto aggravated fraud, you have to prove X under one view\nby a reasonable -- beyond a reasonable doubt, but, under\nyour view, by only clear and convincing evidence.\nMR. GANNON: Well, for purposes of a civil\nremoval proceeding, that's true, and that's no different\nfrom the limiting factors in several of the other\nprovisions, like the sentence that was imposed -- the\npotential sentence -- whether there was an exception for\na first offense that involved family members, for the\nalien smuggling and document fraud, crimes in (N) and\n(P).\nAnd the -- this also is a reading that we\ncan't impose on subparagraph (M)(ii), where we know that\nthere is no loss requirement there, that the government\nhave a revenue loss of more than $10,000 for a crime in\nwhich the loss to the government is $10,000. The \"in\nwhiches\" here are parallel to the \"for whiches\"\nelsewhere in --in the statute.\nAnd although Petitioner invokes the guilty\nplea practice in the context of tax evasion offenses for\npurposes of section 7201, this -- this doesn't help his\nargument for the same reason that he cannot use\nextraneous elements and guilty pleas generally to\nestablish that something was necessary for a conviction.\nBut if you look at the criminal tax manual that he\ninvokes, it makes clear by referring to relevant conduct\nand the need for the loss amount there to include all of\nthe losses for all of the years in the indictment, even\nif the defendant has pleaded guilty to an individual\ncount for a single year of tax evasion, that the loss\namounts that is typically included in guilty pleas in\n7201 cases is not the loss amount that is relevant here.\nIt is in fact directly parallel to the sentencing\nstipulation that -- that the Petitioner entered into\nhere.\nIf the Court has no further questions --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.\nGannon.\nMR. GANNON: The court of appeals should be\naffirmed.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Moseley, you\nhave 4 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS E. MOSELEY\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. MOSELEY: With respect to the issue of\ndeference, the fact that this is part of a Federal\ncriminal statute I believe doesn't get us -- cuts off\nthe inquiry, and we don't get to Chevron deference here.\nWe deal with a dual use statute which has both civil and\ncriminal applications, so that under these\ncircumstances, certainly as this Court held in Leocal\nand in Lopez-Gonzalez, Chevron deference with respect to\nBabaisakov would not -- for example -- would not be\ntriggered.\nI think, moreover, it's important to note\nthat the Babaisakov got (M)(ii) wrong -- got the -- the\nrequirement of a deficiency wrong, and also got wrong\nthe fact that there were no statutes involved where\nfraud -- where a loss amount in excess of $10,000 would\nbe an element.\nFinally, I think the government's reading of\nthis statute might make sense if Congress had said that\n-- convicted of a crime in -- a crime in which fraud or\ndeceit is an element, with loss to be found at removal\nproceedings in excess of $10,000. But that's not the\nlanguage that Congress employed here, and under these\ncircumstances, even if the statute is perceived to be\nambiguous, that ambiguity should be resolved in the\nPetitioner's favor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: To come back to the\ndeference point, you say -- is this relevant to the\ncriminal conviction? He's convicted criminally\nregardless of how you read that. You acknowledge it\ndoesn't -- it isn't an element of the crime, and so to\nbe convicted criminally you acknowledge you don't have\nto show the amount --\nMR. MOSELEY: But --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- right?\nMR. MOSELEY: But what the government has\nsaid, if they're going to do a prosecution under 8\nU.S.C. 1326(b), that they would seek to prove this\namount de novo in the underlying criminal proceeding.\nSo it will form -- it would form part of a -- it would\nform part of a criminal prosecution --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, in that later\ncriminal proceeding, they would have to prove it\nundoubtedly --\nMR. MOSELEY: Right, and that --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But this is not a later\ncriminal proceeding; this is an administrative\nproceeding. And why shouldn't it be up to the BIA\ninitially to determine how to interpret this language\nfor purposes of the deportation laws?\nMR. MOSELEY: It shouldn't, Justice Scalia,\nbecause we deal with a dual use statute, as this Court\nLeocal, which indeed was also a civil removal\nproceeding, or Lopez-Gonzalez, which was a civil removal\nproceedings. Leocal involved 18 U.S.C. 16 -- 16(b), and\n--\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But there -- was it not\ntrue that there the interpretation placed upon the\nstatute by BIA would also be the interpretation\nnecessary to secure the criminal conviction? And that's\nnot the case here.\nMR. MOSELEY: But it was -- but in\nLopez-Gonzalez, there was a -- there was a Board of\nImmigration Appeals decision, Matter of Yanez, which was\ndirectly opposite to what this Court held and ultimately\nrejected in that decision. There -- this clearly is a\nstatute, I submit, that implicates -- that implicates a\nFederal criminal prosecution later. And indeed if the\ngovernment, as the government's brief, says that they're\ngoing to prove this amount in some subsequent illegal\nreentry prosecution, that I submit raises more far more\nconcerns with respect to practicality.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I frankly couldn't\nunderstand the government's concession on that point. I\nthought the -- the offense on illegal entry was to enter\nillegally after you've been deported. It's a -- there's\na defense if the original deportation was flawed?\nMR. MOSELEY: No --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I don't understand that.\nMR. MOSELEY: Well, that may be a separate\nissue, Justice Kennedy. There is the sentencing\nenhancement if it's after -- if someone enters or\nreenters illegally after a conviction of an aggravated\nfelony. And what the government apparently has said is\nthat they would prove for a person whose aggravated\nfelony arguably falls within (i) --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I see. I see.\nMR. MOSELEY: -- they would prove that loss\nde novo in Federal Court.\nMR. MOSELEY: I see my time is up.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
