Greenwood.
Mr. McConnell.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL W. McCONNELL
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. McCONNELL: Mr. Chief Justice, and may
it please the Court:
This Court has consistently rejected the
argument that Federal statutes that both create a right
to sue and also bar waiver of rights under the statute
are sufficiently explicit to override the strong Federal
policy in favor of arbitrability expressed in the
Federal Arbitration Act. In two of those cases, Gilmer
and Pyett, the Court construed a statute the relevant
language of which is virtually indistinguishable from
that and the Credit Repair Organizations Act that we
have before us today.
Those cases involve the ADEA. Both the ADEA
and CROA, as I'll call it, create a cause of action for
aggrieved parties to bring actions for damages. And
both statutes explicitly bar waiver of, quote, "any
right" under the statute.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, that statute
didn't have, as this one has, a disclosure requirement
that says you have a right to sue.
MR. McCONNELL: And that's the sole
distinction between the two statutes. So, let's talk
about --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, it could be a
meaningful one.
MR. McCONNELL: So, the -- first of all, the
disclosure statute is a -- describes in layman's terms,
gives a quick description of an operative civil
liability section, which is set out in 1679g and which
tells us exactly what Congress had in mind in creating a
cause of action.
And when you look at the language of the
actual operative provision, 1679g, it's almost as if
Congress deliberately went out of its way to use
language that would not preclude arbitration. That
language provides that a person who violates the statute
shall be liable to the persons --
JUSTICE KAGAN: Suppose it said something
different, Mr. McConnell. Suppose the disclosure
provision didn't exist at all, but that instead of that
liability provision, you had a provision that simply
said: Any person injured by a violation of this Act
will have a right of action or will have a right to sue
under this statute. And then you had the waiver
provision that you have in this statute. Is that
enough?
MR. McCONNELL: Justice Kagan, I think that
would be exactly the same, because a cause of action and
a right to sue are the same thing. They mean the same
thing. And this Court has consistently since Mitsubishi
held that just because Congress creates a cause of
action which is a right to sue does not preclude
arbitration, because --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. McConnell, you
started with the notion that the disclosure provision in
the statute is meant to apply to ordinary people, and if
an ordinary person not schooled in the law read "you
have a right to sue," wouldn't they understand that to
mean I have a right to sue in court?
MR. McCONNELL: Justice Ginsburg, in the
ADEA context, the government itself, the EEOC, sends
discriminated-against workers a right-to-sue letter that
tells them they have a right to sue. But this Court has
twice said that that does not preclude arbitration. And
that's because a right to sue is simply a cause of
action. It doesn't actually -- that doesn't mean
exclusively a right to be in court. It gives you rights
which may be vindicated, and there are various ways in
which they can be vindicated. And the Federal
Arbitration Act provides that the -- that this Court or
that the courts must enforce private contractual
agreements that provide for the vindication even of
statutory rights through arbitration.
JUSTICE ALITO: Can you imagine any
statutory language that would eliminate the right, the
ability of the parties to enter into an arbitration
agreement other than language that expressly prohibits
the waiver of the right to sue in court in favor of
arbitration?
MR. McCONNELL: Yes, Justice Alito, I can
imagine it. Now, Congress has to date not used it.
Congress knows perfectly well how to bar arbitration.
They've done it in a number of statutes. In fact, in
the very Congress that enacted CROA, there were three
different statutes that were proposed that would have
eliminated arbitration for particular statutory schemes.
None of them were adopted.
But Congress is perfectly aware of how to do
this. I don't think they have to use the magic words
"no arbitration," but -- but they certainly have to do
something considerably more direct than this.
Here they've created a statute that provides
that there must be liability and creates a cause of
action, and then they tell people in a separate
disclosure provision -- by the way, added very late in
the drafting process, right -- simply to tell people
that they have what is colloquially known for laymen as
a right to sue.
Now, we lawyers call things causes of
action. We call them things like the right to bring a
civil action in a court of competent jurisdiction.
That's lawyers' language. But when ordinary people talk
about this, they think that's a right to sue. But a
cause of action and a right to sue are exactly the same
thing.
JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. McConnell, the cases
that you cite in support of your position rest on a
distinction between procedural rights and substantive
rights, which you invoke here. But where does that
distinction itself come from? Because it seems very
atextual in nature, that distinction, which does appear
in the cases. But when Congress talks about rights, why
should we think of rights as limited to substantive
rights rather than also procedural rights?
MR. McCONNELL: First of all, only our
waiver argument depends upon those particular cases; we
have a second argument. But, nonetheless, I think this
comes from the very long tradition, at least back to the
1980s in Mitsubishi, of understanding that arbitration
is a choice of a forum, but it must vindicate the
substantive rights of the particular statute.
So, this is the way courts have talked about
the relationship between arbitration and the substantive
statute. So, you look at the statute, and you see what
are the prohibitions, what are the substantive rights
and so forth, and the arbitrators enforce all of those,
but that the term rights does not include -- it does not
mean that there's an exclusively judicial forum, just
that whoever is the decisionmaker is going to enforce
exactly the same set of substantive rights which are in
the statute.
But, Justice Kagan, even if that were not
persuasive, Congress is perfectly aware that that's the
way that this Court had been interpreting the words,
because Gilmer, which interprets the very words "any
rights" in an anti-waiver provision as not including
arbitration, happened just a few years, 5 years, before
enactment of this statute. And we know Congress was
aware of Gilmer, because in -- the very same Congress
that passed CROA also considered a bill, considered and
rejected, a bill that would have reversed the decision
in Gilmer.
So, Gilmer and the very question of -- of
arbitration was before this Congress, and they knew that
the word "any rights" was interpreted by this Court the
way that it was in Gilmer, and they used precisely the
language that was interpreted that way in Gilmer.
And so, at this point, there's a vocabulary.
It's like there's a glossary. Congress is using it, and
even if it may not be, you know, fully textual, as you
say, that's -- that's the way Congress now addresses the
matter.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the -- the Act in
Gilmer did not designate court action or right to sue as
a right within the non-waivable provision.
MR. McCONNELL: That's true, Justice
Ginsburg, and the question is, does it matter? I would
say anyone looking at the ADEA's language, which says
that an aggrieved person may bring a civil action in
court, anyone would say that that is a right to sue. It
is surely a right.
And, indeed, when this Court interpreted
that statute in Pyett, this Court called it a right, a
right, to a judicial forum. Three times in the opinion,
the Court refers to that as a "right." And the fact
that our statute here refers to a right to sue, rather
than a right to bring a civil action, seems -- certainly
against the backdrop -- recall, please, that the
question here is whether Congress has explicitly
abrogated the -- specifically disavowed, specifically
barred the use -- the arbitrability of the -- of the
contracts, and that all doubts are supposed to be
resolved in favor of arbitrability, and the -- the
statutes must be interpreted with a healthy regard for
the policy in favor of arbitrability.
Considering this, and considering the paltry
basis in the text for -- for that conclusion, I don't
see how the Ninth Circuit's decision can be withstood --
could be upheld.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you think a --
the word "lawsuit" typically describes an arbitration
proceeding? If you're subject to an arbitration, would
you say, I'm in a lawsuit?
MR. McCONNELL: I do not think so.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, why doesn't a
right to sue refer to a lawsuit?
MR. McCONNELL: It refers to a cause of
action, Your Honor, you know, and we can call that a
lawsuit, too. I mean, often that's another layman's
term for a cause of action. But this Court has held I
don't know how many times, I believe it's at least six
times since -- since Mitsubishi, that just because
Congress creates a cause of action and says that it will
be in court, that does not mean that that's -- that that
does not preclude arbitration, that that creates a cause
of action.
And I think the -- the underlying logic of
this is that the existence of a cause of action or of a
right to sue, which I submit is a synonym for a cause of
action, is -- is not inconsistent with arbitration; it's
the precondition for arbitration. If there were not a
cause of action, there would be nothing to arbitrate,
right? So, in every case in which there's a legal
arbitration, there's a cause of action. It might arise
from contract, it might arise from a statute, but in
every single arbitration, there is a cause of action.
If this Court were to interpret --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: No, if this were written
to be read by and understood by lawyers, I think you
would have a stronger argument. But this is meant for
consumers, and they read "you have a right to sue, and
that right is not waivable." A right to sue -- they're
not going to think about cause of action. They don't
know what cause of action is. But they do know that a
right to sue is a right to bring a lawsuit.
MR. McCONNELL: Justice Ginsburg, again, if
that is so, it would apply to other cases in which the
language "right to sue" is used. For example, the
EEOC's right-to-sue letters, what could be more explicit
than that? But this Court has held several times that
just because the EEOC sends a right-to-sue letter
doesn't mean that Congress has --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is that in -- is that in
the statute? Or is it just a colloquial --
MR. McCONNELL: It's in the regulations,
Your Honor.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, but Title VII
doesn't say "right to sue." It's a name that the agency
uses, but it's not -- it's not in the statute. The
statute doesn't say you have a right to sue.
MR. McCONNELL: Well, what the statute says
is you may bring a suit in court. And so, if this
Court -- I do not see how the Court can say that the
right -- that the language "the right to sue" is
different from a right of action. It certainly -- it's
-- it is the same thing.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: One way you could do
it is that the right to sue is more familiar
colloquially. If somebody, you know, hits your car and
you jump out angrily and say -- you can say: I'm going
to sue you. You're not likely to say: I'm going to
bring a cause of action against you.
(Laughter.)
MR. McCONNELL: We have -- there is no
reason to think that when Congress appended a disclosure
provision toward the end of the drafting of this statute
and simply used a colloquial version of cause of action
so that ordinary people would understand it, that they
intended to change the meaning of the operative
provision. The operative provision tells us, I think
very clearly, what Congress meant, and then in this sort
of quick shorthand, colloquial way, they're telling
people, yes, they have an action, but just like they
have an action -- persons have an action under the
Sherman Act, they have an action under RICO, they have
an action under the ADEA, they have an action under the
Truth in Lending Act. In all of these cases, people
have a right to sue, but this Court has held that
arbitration vindicates the cause of action.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: In a standard arbitration
agreement, if Smith and Jones agree to arbitrate and
Jones then brings suit in court, and that action is then
stayed pending arbitration, has there been a breach of
the arbitration agreement simply by bringing the suit?
MR. McCONNELL: I don't --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: I mean, doesn't that
happen rather often?
MR. McCONNELL: It does happen rather often.
I'm not sure what the -- I would say no. What I would
say is that the -- is that the question of arbitrability
has been put before the court, and the court will decide
whether to enforce the arbitration clause or not.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: And, of course, suits are
brought after arbitration to enforce the arbitration
award.
MR. McCONNELL: Exactly. Exactly. So, in
this sense, it's not that the cause of action goes away.
It's not the -- the cause of action is not being waived.
It's simply being vindicated in a different way, in a
way which Congress in the Arbitration Act has told us is
perfectly appropriate, just as appropriate as a -- as
vindication in Court and that we should leave it to --
and that a contract between the parties to decide which
of the forums for vindication of their rights would be
used should be enforced.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Except that this is not
what the parties decide. These are take it or leave it
contracts. So, the consumer doesn't really elect
arbitration. It's just presented as part of the terms
that the consumer can take or leave and not negotiated.
MR. McCONNELL: That is an argument against
arbitration that this Court has rejected several times.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: It's a question of
whether we take that into account in -- in determining
what "you have a right to sue" means.
MR. McCONNELL: Well, Justice Ginsburg,
Congress -- that's a policy question, and Congress has
given us an answer. Recently, by the way, Congress has
indicated a slightly different answer which will affect
cases like this in the future. As part of the
Dodd-Frank regulatory reform bill, Congress required the
new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to conduct a
serious study of the use of arbitration procedures in
consumer financial matters to find out whether things
like what you referred to, Justice Ginsburg, the -- the
types of contracts and so forth are fair to consumers.
So, we'll get an authoritative answer to
this. And Congress then vested this new bureau with
authority either to outlaw arbitration awards or to
require conditions or to reform them. But in the
meantime, the policy that Congress has set is the policy
in the Federal Arbitration Act, which is one of a strong
policy in favor of enforcing arbitration contracts.
JUSTICE KAGAN: You know, except if Congress
indicates otherwise and --
MR. McCONNELL: Unless Congress has
indicated otherwise.
JUSTICE KAGAN: And I guess that the problem
here is that there is this language in this disclosure
provision which is meant, you know, truly to inform
consumers about -- about their rights and about where
they're going to end up resolving their disputes, and it
says "you have a right to sue." And you're asking us
essentially to read that language as: You have a right
to bring a claim in court, but it's probably going to
end up in arbitration because of the nature of your form
contract.
And that seems a very different kind of
statement to consumers.
MR. McCONNELL: Justice Kagan, I do not see
how it would be any different from a consumer who reads
any of the statutes that this Court has held are subject
to arbitration. If, for example, in the Truth in
Lending Act, which this Court interpreted in the Green
Tree case that as part of the arbitration contract, it
was required to send the consumer a copy of the statute.
The consumer would read in the statute that there's a
cause of action, that they can bring suit in court to
enforce their rights under the Truth in Lending Act.
They would read that statute, and they would
draw exactly the same conclusion that they do from the
shorthand layman's language of "a right to sue."
But, again, even if that were so, I think as
a matter of -- of how -- of statutory interpretation,
that a disclosure provision cannot change the meaning of
the operative section. The operative section which
creates the rights and liabilities here is section
1679g. And not even Respondents seriously claim that
that section is -- shows a congressional intent to
prevent arbitrability. And that seems -- the fact that
there's a disclosure provision that uses more informal
language instead of the lawyers' language used in 1679g
does not change the meaning of the statute.
Unless there are further questions, I will
reserve the remaining part of my time for rebuttal.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
Mr. Nelson.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF SCOTT L. NELSON
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. NELSON: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
The Credit Repair Organizations Act provides
consumers with what it explicitly denominates a right to
sue, and then it says that any right of the consumer
under the statute is non-waivable. As this Court has
said --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Does that mean that
there's a violation of the statute the minute one of
these organizations asks someone to sign an arbitration
clause?
MR. NELSON: There's --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: A $1,000 penalty for the
mere asking?
MR. NELSON: There's a -- there's a
technical violation in asking, because in 1679f not only
are waivers made unenforceable, but it is -- it is
prohibited to ask someone to waive their rights.
However, that does not mean that you
actually have a cause of action to go in and sue
somebody for that, because, remember, under 1679g, what
you can sue for is your money back. If somebody's asked
you for a waiver -- you didn't sign the contract, you
didn't pay them any money. Or your damages -- if
somebody asked you for a waiver and you never signed up
with them, you don't have any damages. And then
punitive damages in addition, which -- you know, the
general rule about punitive damages is you get them on
top of actual damages if you have actual damages.
So, it's -- yes, it's a technical violation.
If a company engaged in a pattern or practice of it, the
FTC could quite rightly go in and get an injunction
against that. But it's not a case where there would be
some onerous penalty imposed on a company merely for
asking for a waiver.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, doesn't that
reading, however, make suspect your claim that Congress
would have intended -- without any discussion in the
legislative history -- and our case law has said you
have to read the intent to bar arbitration both from the
language of the statute, its context, and its history.
I just don't see any history here that supports your
reading.
MR. NELSON: Well, Justice Sotomayor, I want
to take that in two parts, because the first was -- was
tied to the -- the attempt to procure a waiver and
whether that calls into question whether Congress really
could have meant this. It's sort of an unusual
provision to say not only can you not waive rights, but
it's a violation even to ask somebody to waive them.
But that's no more unusual with respect to
the right to sue than with respect to any other right
under this statute. For example, the right to cancel
after 3 days. Everybody would concede, I think, that
that's a non-waivable right under the clear language of
this statute. It's an unusual and perhaps onerous
provision to say that if somebody just suggested that
you waive that right to cancel and you never actually
waived it, they still violated the statute.
But, you know, that's what Congress wrote
here, because in this statute, it was concerned with an
industry that it saw as overreaching pervasively in
relation to the people that it was -- it was trying to
sign up for its services. And that's why Congress
wanted a very strong prohibition of waiver of rights
that even attempted -- that even extended to attempts.
Now, as to the --
JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, Mr. Nelson, but your
friend Mr. McConnell says quite rightly that the rules
in this area have been fairly clear, that Congress knew
it had to make especially clear that it wanted to void
arbitration agreements. So, if that's the case, why
didn't Congress do what it has done in a thousand other
statutes -- or maybe that's an overstatement -- but a
number of other statutes, which is to say so?
MR. NELSON: First of all, the -- the rules
are not that Congress has to be especially clear in this
context. And, in fact, the Court has said over and over
in the line of cases starting with Mitsubishi, McMahon,
Rodriguez de Quijas, and Gilmer that what has to be
discernible -- and this also gets back to Justice
Sotomayor's question -- it merely has to be discernible
from the text or the legislative history or the
structure and policies of the Act that -- that there's
an intent to preclude waiver of the right to judicial
remedies.
That's not an unmistakable plain statement
rule; it's not a requirement of explicitness in the
sense of explicitly using the term "arbitration." As
even my friend stated, there's no requirement of magic
words.
What this Court said, what it told Congress
in the years leading up to this statute is: You have to
express a discernible intent to preclude waiver of the
right to judicial remedies.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Right. And -- and you
don't need a magic word, but it seems to me you need
something more than a provision dealing with what you
have to tell to the people who -- who accept these
contracts. I mean it's not in the substantive part of
the statute. It's in the part of the statute that tells
you what provisions of the -- of the Act you have to
notify the consumer of. It's a very strange way for
Congress to say "no arbitration" by putting this
language in a section that has nothing to do with the
rights under the Act.
MR. NELSON: Well --
JUSTICE SCALIA: It is intended to be a
summary of the rights under the Act.
MR. NELSON: Justice Scalia, I think it's --
I think it's not a strange way at all but a very direct
way in the context here. Remember, in Gilmer, what the
Court was dealing with was a statute that as amended in
an amendment that actually wasn't before the Court in
Gilmer said you can't waive any right under the statute.
But that then raises a question: Well, what do we mean
by rights under this statute? And the Court concluded
there and reinforced in Pyett that it interpreted that
to mean substantive rights; in the absence of a textual
indication, that when Congress used the term "rights" in
this statute, it was intending to protect the procedural
right to go to court.
Here we have something very different.
Congress creates a cause of action which, as my friend
says, colloquially someone could call that a right if
they wanted to. But the cause of action says you can --
you can obtain this liability; the court will determine
it; you obtain it through an action. That certainly
gives you an entitlement to go to court. But Congress
then goes further and it denominates that one of the
rights under this statute, one of only two rights under
this statute that are so-called.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Do you think that Gilmer
would have come out differently with regard to one of
the procedural rights involved in that case if the
statute had happened to refer to that procedural right
as a right? Procedural rights are rights, aren't they?
MR. NELSON: Yes, they are definitely
rights, and --
JUSTICE SCALIA: So, and if the statute in
Gilmer had referred to one of the procedural rights in
passing as a right, you think that one would have been
non-waivable?
MR. NELSON: I think that if Congress had
expressly denominated something in that statute as a
right --
JUSTICE SCALIA: But procedural rights are
rights. I mean, to denominate it as a right is --
MR. NELSON: Well, but the question is:
Does "any right" refer to both procedural and
substantive rights?
JUSTICE SCALIA: Exactly.
MR. NELSON: Which is what this Court held
that it did not in Pyett. But when Congress -- you
know, it does matter what words Congress uses, and
"rights" is a word that can have a lot of meanings.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but --
MR. NELSON: This is a statute that --
JUSTICE SCALIA: But you're saying -- in
answer to my question, you're saying that just because
the statute refers to procedural rights as rights, just
as we do, all of a sudden, simply because the statute
uses our normal language, those procedural rights are
elevated to the level of substantive rights and can't be
waived. That can't be right.
MR. NELSON: I think if Congress makes clear
in the statute that what it means when it's talking
about rights is -- includes procedural rights, and then
it has a provision that says any right under this
statute is not subject to waiver, that creates a very
strong inference that Congress meant what it said. But,
in fact --
JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't think that
referring to a procedural right as a right creates any
inference at all. It is a right.
MR. NELSON: It is a right, and when
Congress has said -- I mean, many of these statutes such
as Title VII and TILA don't say that rights are
non-waivable. This statute is a unique statute in its
phrasing. It has a non-waiver provision applicable to
any right, and it has a list of rights. That's pretty
unusual.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: What else is non-waivable
besides the 3 days to back out?
MR. NELSON: Well, the other thing that this
statute makes non-waivable besides rights is
protections, and -- which is a phrase that isn't then
tied to anything defined in the statute. But I think
that, for example, all of the prohibited practices
listed in section 1679b, which are at pages 4a to 5a of
the red brief -- those would be non-waivable. You
couldn't waive your right not to have the credit repair
organization make false statements to you. You couldn't
waive your right under 1679b(b) not to have to make a
payment in advance to a credit repair organization. You
can't waive the right to the disclosures provided for in
1679c or the protection provided by those disclosures.
And 1679d requires written contracts and specifies those
terms. Those would all be subject to the provision in
the statute that says you can't waive any protection or
any right provided by the statute.
JUSTICE KAGAN: Do you know, Mr. Nelson,
whether this statute is unique in this sense: Do you
know of any other statute that arguably voids
arbitration agreements without saying that they're
voiding -- that it's voiding an arbitration agreement?
MR. NELSON: No. There's a -- sort of a
pending disagreement, perhaps, over whether the
Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act does, but that's because of
some very specific language in that statute about
informal dispute resolution mechanisms and the manner in
which that has been interpreted in agency regulations.
So, this is really the only statute that I'm aware of
that uses this formulation.
But you remind me of your earlier question,
which I never got to finish answering about the
thousands of other statutes that say specifically that
you can't enforce arbitration agreements. In fact,
there are very few such statutes. There were none at
the time this statute was enacted. The first one
appeared 6 years later. The only time that there has
been any number of them is in the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act,
which came after what I would say is a lengthy period of
considerable attention that had been paid by advocates
before Congress to the issue of arbitration that I think
led to the desire to use as sort of a belt and
suspenders approach in those statutes.
But what we had here in 1996, there had
never before been a statute that prohibited the
enforcement specifically of an arbitration agreement in
those terms. And as Mr. McConnell said, there were some
proposals, unenacted proposals, that had been floated at
that time. But I think the one thing that is clear is
that we don't learn how Congress does things by looking
at things that it didn't do. And that's all those
unenacted proposals were.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Would your position of
right to a lawsuit -- would that extend to a
post-dispute genuinely bargained-for right to arbitrate?
MR. NELSON: No, I think not, Justice
Ginsburg, and for this reason: The -- the Court has
always differentiated between post-dispute settlements
of claims and pre-dispute waivers, and has not
considered agreements to settle, absent very special
either statutory language such as in the ADEA, which
does apply a waiver provision to some types of
settlements, and in the Fair Labor Standards Act, where
there's a very specific policy reason for prohibiting
certain kinds of settlements. But, generally, the Court
has not considered the settlement of a case to be a
waiver of the right to bring the case. And that
primarily came in the FELA cases that we cited in our
briefs.
But I think it was significant that in Wilko
v. Swan, where the Court said we're going to interpret
the Securities Act not to -- not to allow waivers of the
right to sue, the Court said: Of course, this wouldn't
apply to something that came post-dispute.
And in McMahon and Rodriguez de Quijas, what
the Court disagreed with Wilko v. Swan about was whether
the right to sue under that particular statute was
non-waivable. But it favorably commented on the notion
that, of course, even if it were, it wouldn't bar a
post-dispute agreement to arbitrate a claim as a way of
settling an actually pending dispute.
And that's why I think when Congress enacted
this statute, it would have been acting against that
backdrop and would not have -- no one would have thought
that a settlement agreement is a waiver of the right to
sue. A settlement agreement is a resolution of the
right to sue.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Another argument that is
made, in opposition to your position, is that the
statute says any waiver of any protection or right may
not be enforced by any court or any other person. And
the suggestion is "any other person" must contemplate an
alternate dispute method that doesn't involve court --
court or any other person.
MR. NELSON: Well, I don't think that it
necessarily contemplates an alternative dispute
resolution mechanism, because I think, for example, that
would bar -- when someone goes to court to compel
arbitration, they are enforcing an arbitration agreement
by bringing an enforcement action. So, that would bar
them from doing that.
So, "any other person" doesn't necessarily
mean arbitrators. But even to the extent that it
comprehends arbitrators and maybe even one might have
thought was principally applicable to them, you've got
to realize that this statute -- what it prohibits is
only the waiver of the consumer's ability to arbitrate
her CROA claim. It doesn't bar a credit repair
organization from requiring a consumer to arbitrate the
credit repair organization's breach of contract action.
And, in fact, most -- well over 99 percent of the
consumer arbitrations that were handled by the
arbitration forum that was designated in this contract
were collection actions brought by a company that says
this consumer owes me some money.
So, that's kind of the norm. That's the
general run of arbitration cases. And if a credit
repair organization were to initiate an arbitration
against a consumer, that wouldn't violate the non-waiver
provision; but if the consumer then defended and said,
wait a second, this contract is void because I never got
the right to cancel, the provision would quite clearly
prevent the arbitrator in that circumstance from saying
you waived the right to cancel.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What about the
argument that the consumer retains the right to sue,
since they can go into court with their complaint, but
it's simply -- the rule that the court will apply is
that you have to proceed to arbitration?
MR. NELSON: Well, I think it's -- it would
be a remarkably crabbed notion of having a right to sue
that meant you could file a complaint that was
mandatorily subject to decision elsewhere. And, second,
and this goes to Justice --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But that's
frequently -- that's frequently the way these issues
come up. I mean, people --
MR. NELSON: Well, that's certainly --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- who think they
cannot be forced to arbitrate either under the agreement
or any other provision, they'll bring their complaint in
court, and then there will be a judicial resolution of
whether or not the proceeding should go to arbitration.
MR. NELSON: But -- but all that has been
resolved in that -- that suit is not the plaintiff's
claim under CROA, which is what he has a right to sue
on. All that's resolved is the issue of whether he has
a contractual obligation to arbitrate which he has
breached by going into court.
And this goes to Justice Kennedy's question.
Under the FAA, you can compel arbitration when someone
has filed a complaint that is in breach of an agreement
to arbitrate.
So, they -- they don't actually have a right
to sue. You can't stop them from going and filing a
complaint, but once they do, you come in and say, no,
you have no right to -- to proceed on the merits with
this claim in court. And, in fact, that's -- that's
exactly what the arbitration --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Can you get -- can you get
damages in the arbitration for the cost of attorney's
fees to go to the court to say that you had to go to the
arbitration?
MR. NELSON: No, I don't think you would
generally have that entitlement under any -- any rule of
law that is -- that is normally applicable in American
courts. However, if your -- if your arbitration
agreement provided for that -- I'm afraid I can't point
to any decision that would make it unenforceable, much
as I would regret that result.
So, you know, I think in a -- in a real
sense, the consumer has no right to -- right to sue
merely because they can run into court and -- and then
be compelled to arbitrate. And that's exactly why this
Court, in every one of its decisions enforcing
arbitration agreements or not, has referred to the
arbitration agreement as a waiver of the right to
proceed judicially. It has used that phrase over and
over again in McMahon, Rodriguez de Quijas, Mitsubishi,
and -- and Gilmer itself.
The -- the common recognition of all those
cases is that the arbitration agreement is a waiver of
the person's right to proceed in court.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You agree, I take
it, that you would lose if the statute said "you have a
cause of action"?
MR. NELSON: Yes. I -- you know, a cause of
action I don't think would -- would do it for us. In
fact, that's exactly what the ADEA says, the section
that creates a judicial remedy is headed "Cause of
Action." And so, you know, the question again is
"right" is a word that -- that can be used in many
senses. It's -- it's a word sort of like
"jurisdiction." It gets thrown around loosely. But
when Congress says a right is non-waivable, it's
referring to something specific. And the question is:
What is it referring to in a statute that uses the term
"right" and uses it to describe the -- the ability to go
to court?
And -- and, again, that "right to sue"
language is important in two ways, because it not only
specifies that the 1679g remedies are a right for
purposes of this statute, but it says something about
the nature of the right. It's a right to sue. It's not
just a right to get those damages, to get your money
back. And "sue," as I -- and I think my friend
agrees --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well -- well, I guess it
goes further than that, your argument does, it seems to
me. Your argument is the waiver -- the non-waiver of
rights provision would normally be read to mean
non-waiver of substantive rights, but the notice given
to the consumer here, which refers to the procedural
right to sue as a "right," eliminates that presumption.
So, I presume, therefore, that your position
is that all procedural rights under this statute cannot
be waived. Because, I mean, that's what we're talking
about: What does "right" mean --
MR. NELSON: Justice --
JUSTICE SCALIA: -- when it says rights are
not waived? And our prior case law says ordinarily that
means only substantive rights. But here in this
statute, it refers to the right to sue, which is
certainly a procedural right, as a right. So, I presume
all the other procedural rights in this statute likewise
cannot be waived.
MR. NELSON: Well, I -- I'm not really sure
there are other procedural rights in the statute.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, there are none?
MR. NELSON: I mean, unless -- the right to
cancel within 3 days I suppose could be called a
procedure in one sense, although it's -- it's -- I think
it -- it probably would generally be categorized as a
substantive right.
But as far as procedural rights of the
consumer, they are set forth in 1679g, and they are the
right to bring an action either on an individual or
class basis for the damages and attorney fees specified
in that section. And that's what I think is being
referred to as "the right to sue."
Now, if there were something else in the
statute that one might arguably call a right and
arguably call procedural -- I mean, it's hypothetical
because I don't think it's there, but I would not jump
to the conclusion that it was a right if it was not
comprehended by "right to sue," because I think what
that statement "right to sue" makes non-waivable is the
right to sue. It's not just any procedural thing in
this statute that one might loosely call a right.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose the case were
reversed. The liability section says you have a right
to sue, and the disclosure section says you have a right
to sue or go to arbitration. What result then?
MR. NELSON: Well --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: It seems to me that under
your -- well, I'll let you answer.
MR. NELSON: Justice Kennedy, let me divide
it up. If the liability section said you had a right to
sue and there were no disclosure -- disclosure section
at all, I would say that's -- that's plenty good enough.
If the disclosure section says, you have a right to sue
or to go to arbitration, I think you would have to then
say sensibly what is Congress talking about when it's --
when it's referring to this, and you would have to read
them together. And I would have a hard time standing up
here and saying that a statute that told people "right
to sue or arbitrate" meant right to sue only and
foreclosed arbitration. And -- and, you know, I think
-- I think that really would be a very different matter.
JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Nelson, you just said if
the liability section said you have a right to sue,
that's okay, but if it says you have a cause of action,
that's not okay. But the right to sue is really just a
colloquial way of expressing the first. So, why should
we draw the line between those two things?
MR. NELSON: Well, when you say
"colloquial," I'm not -- I don't want to fence with you,
but I think that that's selling it a bit short. This is
a statute where Congress prescribed a notice, prescribed
it in statutory terms, did it so people would have an
understanding of what their rights were, and did it in a
way that no reasonable consumer would understand meant,
oh, this non-waivable right is not really to sue in the
way that I would ordinarily understand the word, and
even that courts normally use it but actually to -- to
do something else.
So, I -- I don't think it's colloquial in --
in a disparaging sense. What it is, is something that
is designed to convey a clear meaning, and the clear
meaning that it conveys is you have a right to go to
court. Now, of course, even a disclosure that you have
a right to go to court wouldn't be enough to get you
over the hump if you didn't also have a provision that
made that right non-waivable. But, again, here what you
have is both.
And -- and in doing that, in writing that
statute, Congress was doing exactly what the Court had
told it, it didn't do in Gilmer, it didn't do in
McMahon, it didn't do in Mitsubishi. It created a right
to a judicial remedy that is not subject to waiver.
Unless the Court has any further questions,
I will --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
Mr. McConnell, you have 10 minutes
remaining.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL W. McCONNELL
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. McConnell, can we go
to the issue of the class action? If we buy your
argument that procedural and substantive rights are
different, is it your position that you could seek a
waiver of a class action even though this statute
expressly contemplates class actions?
MR. McCONNELL: Actually, Justice Sotomayor,
I think this statute specifically does not require -- it
contemplates but does not require class actions. If you
look at -- at 1679g(a)(2)(B), which is the class action
provision -- it's on page 59a of the appendix to the --
to the petition -- all that it says is that in the case
of a class action, here is how we would -- here's how
the damages, the punitive damages, would be calculated.
It does not say that there must be class actions. It
doesn't make that a non-waivable right at all.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, your answer to me is
that that is waivable. That's not a right contemplated
by the right to sue.
MR. McCONNELL: Actually, my answer to you
is that it's not a right to begin with.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, you have to meet
the prerequisites --
MR. McCONNELL: Whether waivable or not.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But you have to meet the
prerequisites of a class action before you are entitled
to seek one. But your position is that's not a
protected right?
MR. McCONNELL: May I -- if we were to
hypothesize that the statute did provide that there
shall be class provisions, which this does not -- I
think this statute is agnostic on that, but the
hypothetical statute where class actions are
contemplated, I would not argue that that is necessarily
waivable. What I would argue is that that can be
vindicated through arbitration, that there can be -- as
this Court discussed just last term in Concepcion, there
can be class arbitration proceedings.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you -- but this
arbitration agreement precludes class actions, doesn't
it?
MR. McCONNELL: Yes, it does. And, again,
this statute does not require that there be class
proceedings. I'm only addressing a hypothetical --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Unless --
MR. McCONNELL: -- statute that did.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Unless we read the
disclosure requirement of a right to sue to mean that
you're entitled to bring your action in court. With
whatever protections, procedural and substantive
protections, that entails.
MR. McCONNELL: Yes, and that seems to me
just a further reason not to interpret a disclosure
provision with a layman's language as importing, you
know, very specific legal notions, that -- I think this
simply means -- right to sue simply means cause of
action. And it's -- each of the rights, I should point
out, in the disclosure provision is -- has its actual
textual home elsewhere. None of them are created in the
disclosure provision. Each of them is created
elsewhere, either in this statute or another. To find
out exactly what they entail, you look to the
substantive provisions. Here, you would look to 1679g,
and you would see that class actions are possible but
not required under this particular statute.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Could you in an
agreement waive the provisions of 1679g(b) that specify
what a court shall consider in awarding punitive
damages?
MR. McCONNELL: I don't think so,
Mr. Chief Justice. Most lower courts treat the right to
punitive damages as a substantive right which would not
be waivable.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, well what --
what if you don't want your arbitrator to consider those
four requirements? Could you waive particular aspects?
I mean, that tells you that -- first of all, it says, of
course, "the court shall consider"; but I take it your
position is when they say "the court," they mean the
court or arbitrator?
MR. McCONNELL: It means the decisionmaker.
Many statutes of course refer to things that courts
might do, even though those statutes can be vindicated
in arbitration. Title VII, for example, has several
provisions in which it says, if the court determines
this, then it may do that, for example, issue
injunctions and so forth. I -- when you import the
substantive provisions of a statute into an arbitration
proceeding, everything that would be substantively
available from a court becomes available from -- from
the arbitrator. And that's the way I would read the
punitive damages section here.
I note, by the way -- if I might just
respond to a few of the points made by my friend in
response to questions -- begin with Justice Sotomayor's
interesting question about the fact that the statute
appears to make even offering a waiver, offering an
arbitration clause, a violation. It's actually even
worse than that for two reasons.
One is that under their reading, a
settlement is surely just as much a waiver as an
arbitration is. Now, they say, oh, well, that only
means post-dispute waivers. But that is not what this
statute says. This statute is about all waivers. In
contrast to other statutes previously enacted, like the
ADEA, which distinguish between pre-dispute and
post-dispute waivers, this one does not. So, their
position suggests that even a settlement offer is a
violation of this statute.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, Mr. Nelson just
said no, that their position doesn't suggest that, when
I asked him about post-dispute and he brought up
settlement as well. He said that their interpretation
does not exclude a settlement in which the plaintiff
agrees --
MR. McCONNELL: Well, Justice Ginsburg, that
was his answer, but what that tells us is that he is not
giving us a plain language meaning of the statute, which
is all that they have, right? Their entire position is
based upon a plain language reading of the statute.
Remember the way the Ninth Circuit begins its opinion by
quoting Alice in Wonderland. It's -- it's all about
plain language. But they do not offer us a plain
language interpretation of this statute. In order to
avoid absurd consequences like making settlement offers
a violation of the statute, they have to create
exceptions, unspecified exceptions, to the text.
It would be much easier simply to follow the
rules of construction that this Court had announced
before this statute was enacted and against which
Congress operated.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, one of those
rules of construction is that you don't read statutes
when -- to the extent they lead to absurd results. I
mean, I think you can still say follow the plain
language, but that doesn't mean you go so far as to say
you can't enter into a settlement.
MR. McCONNELL: I think it's easier, though,
simply to assume that Congress was using words in the
way that this Court used them in Gilmer just a few years
before, that that's a much more straightforward way of
reading the statute.
JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm not sure that a
settlement is a waiver anyway. It's a vindication. You
-- you vindicate your right to a settlement. I don't
know that you waive it.
MR. McCONNELL: Just as I think you can say
that when you go to arbitration, you vindicate the
substantive rights of the statute as well. And, indeed,
this Court has used that very language in Mitsubishi
with respect to -- to arbitration.
The -- just a couple of other small points.
My friend points out that this is the first
statute in -- or that at the time of this statute in
1996, that there had been no statute that explicitly
barred arbitration, which is historically true but I
think not particularly revealing. It was only in '85 in
Mitsubishi and then '91 in Gilmer that Congress became
aware that it needed to do this in statutory causes of
action. In -- and by 1996, they were considering bills
that explicitly voided arbitration clauses. They
weren't enacted, but this is for political reasons.
Remember the political composition of Congress in 1996.
It is not surprising that statutes voiding
arbitration agreements become more common when the
political composition of the Congress changes. This is
fundamentally a political choice, and ought to be -- we
ought to respect the choices that Congress has made.
Unless there are further questions, I will
waive the remainder of my time.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
MR. McCONNELL: Unless it's an un-waivable
right.
(Laughter.)
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You have no right to
time before the Court --
(Laughter.)
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
