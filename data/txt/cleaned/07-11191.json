FRIEDMAN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. FRIEDMAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nWe ask the Court in this case to take no new\nground beyond that established just last term in the\nMelendez-Diaz case, but the stakes of this case are\nhigh. If the Court were to reverse Melendez-Diaz and\nhold that a State may impose on the defendant the\nburden of calling a prosecution witness to the stand,\nit would severely impair the confrontation right and\nthreaten a fundamental transformation in the way\nAnglo-American trials have been conducted for hundreds\nof years.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The State court has\ninterpreted their provision to give the defendant the\nchoice of subpoenaing the witness or asking the State\nto bring in the witness. Why is that overruling\nMelendez-Diaz?\nMR. FRIEDMAN: Your Honor, the -- the State\ncourts, since the time of this case -- since the time\nthat these cases were tried, raised the possibility of\nasking the -- that the defendant could ask the witness\nto bring -- that the defendant could ask the\nprosecution to bring in the witness. It doesn't\nreally change anything from a straight subpoena\nstatute in any -- in either event.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, how is that\ndifferent from a notice statute? If --\nMR. FRIEDMAN: Okay.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: If we take the statute\nas the State supreme court has read it --\nMR. FRIEDMAN: Right.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- they say: In my\nmind, it's a notice statute; tell the prosecutor you\neither want them to call the witness or you subpoena\nthe witness. That's what the State court has told us.\nWhether or not you had notice of that interpretation\nis a separate question.\nMR. FRIEDMAN: That --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Let's separate out the\ntwo questions.\nMR. FRIEDMAN: Okay, fine, fine. The -- the\ntwo aspects that Melendez-Diaz said were wrong with\nthe subpoena statute are both present in this statute\neven as interpreted by the -- by the State supreme\ncourt. That is, nothing in Melendez-Diaz -- I'm\nsorry, nothing in the Magruder case -- the opinion\nhere suggests that the prosecution would bear the\nburden of calling the witness to the stand. I think\nthe Magruder case, the decision of the State supreme\ncourt is very explicit and goes in accordance --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So that's our first\nquestion --\nMR. FRIEDMAN: That's --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Does the Confrontation\nClause require, not just the ability to\ncross-examine --\nMR. FRIEDMAN: That's right.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- but an affirmative\nobligation to place the witness on the stand?\nMR. FRIEDMAN: That's correct. That's\ncorrect.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could I just ask you one\n--\nMR. FRIEDMAN: Yes. Sure.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Would swearing the\nwitness in and saying to the witness \"Is this your\nreport?\" and the witness saying \"Yes\" -- what would be\nunconstitutional about that, given our case law that\nsays that any prior statements by a witness are\nadmissible once the witness is on the stand or\nconstitutionally admissible once they are on the\nstand?\nMR. FRIEDMAN: Right. Right. The cases\ninvolve that were California v. Green and United\nStates v. Owens. In both cases, there were questions\nasked of the witness about what happened. So I do\nbelieve -- though it hasn't been resolved in this\nCourt, I do believe that the prosecution should go\nbeyond simply saying \"Is this your\" --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No, no, no. \"Should\" is\na different question than the one I asked.\nMR. FRIEDMAN: No. I mean, I think the\nConstitution -- I think constitutionally, the -- the\nprosecution would be compelled at least to ask: What\nis your recollection? Do you endorse this statement?\nBut even if that's not true --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Do you have anything\nhistorically or in any case that would suggest that\nthat is a constitutional requirement? I mean, I do\naccept that there is plenty that says you have a right\nto be --\nMR. FRIEDMAN: Right.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- to confront the\nwitness.\nMR. FRIEDMAN: Right.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But what would require\nthe prosecutor to actually do more than I just\nsuggested? \"Is this your statement? Is this your lab\nreport?\"\nMR. FRIEDMAN: Your Honor, so far as I can\ntell, it's hardly ever been tried, for the obvious\nreason that if all the prosecution does is say, \"Is\nthis it,\" and not ask a further question of the\nwitness --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It's not terribly\npersuasive. I don't disagree with you.\nMR. FRIEDMAN: Right. It -- well, that's --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It's a matter of trial\ntactic, but I'm not talking about trial tactic.\nMR. FRIEDMAN: Yes. Right. But I -- but\nit's something that prosecutors don't try because they\nwould have to bear the -- the risk. So part of my\nresponse is: Well, let them go ahead and try it if\nthey want to.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Bear what risk?\nMR. FRIEDMAN: I'm sorry.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Bear what risk? What risk?\nBear what risk?\nMR. FRIEDMAN: Bear -- bear the risk that\nthe -- that the witness has gotten on the stand and is\nnot even asked to recall. Bear the cost of putting a\nwitness on with no recollection.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, he says, \"Is this\nyour lab report and do you stand by it?\"\nMR. FRIEDMAN: \"And do you stand by it?\" --\nthat's the critical point. That's going beyond the\nhypothetical, as I understood it from Justice\nSotomayor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, I see. So -- okay.\nMR. FRIEDMAN: But -- but --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes. I understood the\nhypothetical to be -- to be otherwise, then.\nMR. FRIEDMAN: But -- no, no. If it's \"And\ndo you stand by it\" --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Right.\nMR. FRIEDMAN: -- then that's fine.\nBut I do know of a couple of cases involving\nchild witnesses where they don't ask -- they put the\nwitness on the stand, and they don't ask anything\nabout the events at issue. And in those cases\nthere's -- courts have held that that's -- that's not\nacceptable. So --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, but -- so\nwhat difference? That's because there's nothing in\nevidence about the incident, correct?\nMR. FRIEDMAN: Well, no. No, then they\npresented a former statement by the child. So -- so I\ndo think that there is some justification --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And that was a --\nMR. FRIEDMAN: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Those were found -- I\ndon't -- were those found as violations of the\nConfrontation Clause?\nMR. FRIEDMAN: Those are found to be\nviolations of the Confrontation Clause. The --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Or due process?\nMR. FRIEDMAN: Confrontation Clause. State\nv. Rohrich, which is cited in my brief on another\npoint, and Warren, an Illinois appellate case from, I\nthink, just last term.\nJUSTICE ALITO: It's not clear to me what\nyour answer to these questions is. If all the\nprosecution does is call the analyst on the stand and\nadmit -- have the analyst provide a foundation for the\nadmission of the report, let's say, pursuant to the\nhearsay exception for recorded recollection, and does\nnothing more, would there be a Confrontation Clause\nproblem?\nMR. FRIEDMAN: And there's -- there's the\nquestion, \"Is this your report? Do you stand by it?\"\nThen -- then I don't think there is a Confrontation\nClause problem, because -- because the prosecution has\nput the witness on the stand, has asked those\nquestions, and then the witness -- and --\nJUSTICE ALITO: What's the difference\nbetween that situation and the situation in which the\nreport is -- is admitted, subject to -- and the\nanalyst is available, and the defense can question the\nanalyst if the defense wishes to?\nMR. FRIEDMAN: Well, I think -- I think the\ndifference is that once you ask the question -- \"Do\nyou stand by it?\" -- then the witness has testified\none way or another. And the prosecution, as I say,\nbears the risk that the witness will not testify in\naccordance with the prior statement. California --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: On the past recollection\nrecorded, the witness doesn't stand by the statement.\nThe witness says: I made the statement, have no\ncurrent knowledge; I can't stand by it or not stand by\nit.\nMR. FRIEDMAN: That's right. I take\nCalifornia v. Green at its word. California v. Green\nsays and Owen follows up and says that if the witness\ndoes not testify in accordance with the prior\nstatement, then the defendant has had some of the --\nhas had considerable benefit of cross-examination\nalready. So -- so the prosecution has to -- has to\nput the witness through that pace to make sure that\nthat happens. Beyond that --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't understand what you\njust said. Want to say it again?\nMR. FRIEDMAN: Yes. California v. Green\nsays that if the witness testifies inconsistently with\nthe prior statement, that the defendant has had the\nbenefit of cross-examination in showing the\ninconsistency. So -- so Justice Alito asked me what's\nthe difference, and I'm saying a difference, one\ndifference is, that if the witness does not testify in\naccordance with the prior statement, that's apparent\nto -- that's apparent to the jury. There are also all\nthe practical differences that we emphasize.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You are asking us now to\nstate something that you admit is in really no\nconstitutional case or historical case, that says the\nright to confrontation means that the witness has to\ntell the story, and the form of telling that story has\nto be a verbal recitation; it can't be past recorded\nrecollection because you just said they have to tell\nthe story. It can't be based on official documents or\nanything else, because it has to be their story. Am I\nhearing you wrong?\nMR. FRIEDMAN: No, I don't believe so. I'm\nsaying that the -- that the witness has to take the\nstand, has to -- has to testify live, viva voce, face\nto face, in the time-honored phrases which have always\ngoverned testimony in an Anglo-American trial. Then\nthe -- I think the witness has to at least be asked\nwhat happened. If the witness says, I don't recall,\nthen the prior statement may be introduced. I'm not\n--\nJUSTICE BREYER: What is the --\nMR. FRIEDMAN: I'm not asking the Court to\ngo beyond anything that has previously been said.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What is the theory of this?\nI understand in hearsay, which as we have just seen\ndemonstrated, is very complicated, filled with all\nkinds of rules --\nMR. FRIEDMAN: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- some of which I may\nrecall and others of which I certainly don't.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. FRIEDMAN: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But the -- the\nConfrontation Clause, I would have thought, would have\npicked out the heart of that. So we have Sir Walter\nRaleigh and Sir Walter Raleigh says, \"Bring in\nwitnesses,\" which they wouldn't. So why shouldn't we\nsay what this clause is about is Sir Walter Raleigh?\nMR. FRIEDMAN: Well, if --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Bring in the witnesses.\nNow, once you bring them in, the defendant can do what\nhe wants. He has had his chance to cross-examine\nthem. End of the matter, and leave the rest up to the\nhearsay law.\nMR. FRIEDMAN: I want to emphasize that the\nConfrontation Clause is about a lot more -- there were\nnearly 200 years of history between Walter Raleigh and\nthe Confrontation Clause, and what was established is\nthat in an Anglo-American trial witnesses give their\ntestimony live, face to face, and Melendez-Diaz\nemphasized last term you can't prove the case via an\naffidavit.\nSo -- so it's -- it's the fundamental\nquestion that -- that Crawford establishes --\nfundamental principle that Crawford establishes is\nthis is the way witnesses testify in our trials:\nlive, in front of the jury, subject to oath and then\ncross-exam.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Why -- and -- I trust\nthe trial process, and much of your brief was talking\nabout that process --\nMR. FRIEDMAN: Right.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- and the fact that\nit's much more effective when the witness tells their\nstory and you get a chance to cross-examine than if\nyou have to start from the platform of\ncross-examination. Once a defendant makes it known\nthat a -- he's going to cross-examine a lab\ntechnician, don't you think that in the vast majority\nof cases the prosecutor is going to put that witness\non?\nMR. FRIEDMAN: I --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And if he does or\ndoesn't, why shouldn't we leave it to the normal trial\nstrategy and practice to leave to that prosecutor the\nburden of non-persuasion, which is what confrontation\nwas about?\nMR. FRIEDMAN: Right. Yes.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Which is --\nMR. FRIEDMAN: If -- if the prosecutor is\ncertain that the defendant is going to put the witness\non the stand, then -- then the prosecutor has some\nreason to -- to put the witness on first. The problem\nis that the -- the defunct Virginia statute puts the\nburden on the defendant of bringing the witness in,\nand the defense --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well -- well, I was\nstarting from a different proposition than you did --\nMR. FRIEDMAN: Right. I'm sorry -- but --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- because I think\nthat's a question for your adversaries: How could you\nhave known --\nMR. FRIEDMAN: Right.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- that you should have\nasked the State to bring that witness in?\nBut putting that aside --\nMR. FRIEDMAN: But --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- assume we are reading\nit the way the Court has now.\nMR. FRIEDMAN: Right. The -- the fact is\nthat under the Virginia statute, given -- and as\ninterpreted by the Commonwealth, too -- given that the\ndefendant has the burden of putting the witness on the\nstand, defendants rarely exercise that right, because\nit's a corrupted right, because it isn't nearly as\nvaluable, as I think Your Honor understands, as the\nright to stand up and cross-examine a witness who has\nactually just testified.\nI don't think that the right given by the\nVirginia statute is -- the former Virginia statute is\nactually the right to cross-examine. It's not in form\ncross-examination, and it's not in substance\ncross-examination. It's a right to make the witness\nthe defendant's own, and that's the way -- that's the\nway the statute is -- is worded.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Friedman, one of the\nproblems that has been brought up is that this is an\ninordinate expense, and you're wasting the time of the\nanalyst. Do you recognize any economy -- for example,\nthat the analyst could testify from the lab, have\nvideo conferencing, and so the analyst, while the\nprosecutor must call her, can testify from the lab\ninstead of coming down to the courthouse?\nMR. FRIEDMAN: That -- that is a --\ncertainly a possibility, at least on consent of the\ndefendant, and some States, including my own State of\nMichigan, has been experimenting with that. And I\nthink that's a plausible possibility.\nNow, if the defendant were to insist on --\non live testimony, that is an open -- that's an open\nquestion as to whether video testimony would be\nacceptable. This Court some years ago refused to\ntransmit to Congress a proposed amendment to Federal\nRules of Criminal Procedure, and the majority in a\nstatement by Justice Scalia said there is a virtual\nsatisfaction of the confrontation right, not a real\nsatisfaction.\nSo the matter as to whether it could be done\nwithout consent hasn't been satisfied -- hasn't been\ndetermined. But certainly on consent it could, and in\nmany cases I believe the defendants -- that those\ndefendants who do want confrontation would be\nperfectly willing to accept video.\nBut I do -- I do want to respond also to the\n-- the premise. I -- I believe that sufficient data\nis now available to show rather clearly that the\nexpense is not inordinate.\nJUSTICE ALITO: How can you say that? We\nhave an amicus brief from 26 States plus the District\nof Columbia arguing exactly the contrary.\nMR. FRIEDMAN: Yes, I --\nJUSTICE ALITO: They say that there is a\nvery substantial category of cases in which defendants\nreally have no interest whatsoever in contesting\neither the nature or the quantity of drugs involved,\nbut they will refuse to stipulate to those things\nsimply for the purpose of putting a financial burden\non the prosecution, because they know, if they do\nthat, it may be helpful for them in getting a better\nplea bargain, plus there is a certain risk that the\nanalyst will not show up, and they will get the\nbenefit of that.\nMR. FRIEDMAN: So, Your Honor, I think that\nwhat the -- the States' amicus brief shows is that\nthere are -- there are a lot of drug prosecutions, and\nthere are a lot of drug analyses, and then there is\nthis speculation about the type of gamesmanship that\nyou have mentioned. But if we look for hard data,\nthere is nothing supporting that.\nSo let's look at a couple of jurisdictions\nthat have perfectly valid notice-and-demand rules.\nOhio -- it's less than one appearance per lab analyst\nper month. That is in the State lab. Less than one\nappearance per month.\nJUSTICE ALITO: If this is not a burden on\nthese 26 States plus the District of Columbia, why are\nthey bothering to make this argument? Just for\namusement?\nMR. FRIEDMAN: I'm sure not for amusement.\nI think there's a certain amount of solidarity. I'm\nsure that they would rather not have whatever expense\nthere is. But, frankly, I think a large part is that\nthey recognize that the defunct Virginia statute is an\nimpairment to the confrontation right and makes it\nharder for defendants. It makes -- it makes it less\nlikely that the confrontation right is going to -- is\ngoing to be invoked.\nLet's look at the District of Columbia. The\nDistrict of Columbia, it's about -- it's about a half\na person a year in extra expense caused by lab techs\nhaving to come and testify.\nThat's -- that is not a large burden for the\nDistrict of Columbia, and in fact, the District of\nColumbia -- the lab that services the District of\nColumbia has gotten by with five fewer technicians\nthan it did before the change.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But I assume you've\npicked the best example for you. D.C. is a small\nplace. You go to a big State, and the lab is not\nalways right next door.\nMR. FRIEDMAN: Your Honor, I -- I'm just\nlittle old me, and I just picked what I could get.\nAnd, frankly, the example I picked was because the\nSolicitor General's brief had data on the District of\nColumbia, so I asked some more questions. That's why\nI got -- that's why I got the District of Columbia.\nOhio -- I asked because they are a neighboring State,\nand I was able to get some information.\nJUSTICE BREYER: You could have -- you could\nhave hearsay that is not prepared for testimony.\nThere are all kinds of categories. And suppose, in\nyour case, this hearsay of business record or --\nMR. FRIEDMAN: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And how often will you say:\nI understand it's admissible, but I would like as well\nto call the witness who prepared it. Will you do that\nvery often?\nSuppose you learn that that witness is -- is\n4,000 miles away, so you say, I'd like to call this\nwitness, and you know perfectly well that it's going\nto be virtually impossible for that witness to be\nproduced. What happens?\nMR. FRIEDMAN: We are talking about\nnon-testimonial hearsay?\nJUSTICE BREYER: I'm trying to think of\nsomething that's hearsay, and --\nMR. FRIEDMAN: But --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- and what I'm trying to\nfigure out --\nMR. FRIEDMAN: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- is will defense\nattorneys, if they have the right under the\nConstitution to insist that a lab technician be\npresent, in cases where they happen to know that lab\ntechnician has left the job and is married and is\nreliving in a distant State, say okay, let's call her.\nAnd that way the prosecution really cannot present the\ncase except at inordinate expense.\nAnd I'm concerned about that --\nMR. FRIEDMAN: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- but I don't see quite\nhow to deal with it, how much of a problem it is, and\nthe impact on this particular situation.\nMR. FRIEDMAN: I -- I don't think it's a\nsignificant problem, and I do want to say -- I didn't\n-- I didn't select data. I just got -- presented the\ndata on the States that I had, and my own State of\nMichigan --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Friedman, aren't there\nStates that have been proceeding this way even before\nwe came down with our opinion?\nMR. FRIEDMAN: Absolutely, absolutely,\nincluding my own State.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And which States are they?\nMR. FRIEDMAN: They -- well, they include my\nown State of Michigan; they include the State of New\nYork --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And they are not under\nwater, are they?\nMR. FRIEDMAN: The problems of the State of\nMichigan are not attributable to the use of this\nprocedure, no.\n(Laughter.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Your answer to\nJustice Breyer has to be, of course, you would insist\nthat the person be called. It would be malpractice\nfor you not to.\nMR. FRIEDMAN: It -- it is -- yes, but it's\nnot a significant problem, and one reason it's not a\nsignificant problem is that the possibility of a\ndeposition is always --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I don't know except\nanecdotally, but Massachusetts seems to be having huge\nproblems, reported anecdotally, with the --\nMR. FRIEDMAN: Not -- not according to --\nnot according to the chief of the -- chief trial\ncounsel, Suffolk -- the Suffolk district attorney's\noffice --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Rouse -- is that --\nMR. FRIEDMAN: Excuse me.\nJUSTICE BREYER: The woman, Barbara --\nBarbara Rouse?\nMR. FRIEDMAN: In my reply brief on page 27,\nI quote Patrick Hagan, who says -- who says: \"The sky\nhas not fallen; we can do this very well.\"\nJUSTICE BREYER: And then there are\nconflicting reports in the newspapers, but I don't\nknow.\nMR. FRIEDMAN: It's -- and, of course, there\ncan be an adjustment period, but -- but States can\nadjust. I think the -- the simplest answer to your\nquestion, Justice Breyer, is the use of depositions,\nand I think prosecutors probably have been underusing\ndepositions. But -- but if a lab tech is about to\nretire and that lab tech has done a test that is about\nto be used, then take the deposition.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What happens if the lab\nis -- is divided into four or five parts and there is\nseveral different machines and we have different\npeople at different times using these different\nmachines and performing different operations and each,\nat the end, certifies that the red light was on or it\nwas this or it was that? Now, do we have to call all\nthose people?\nMR. FRIEDMAN: No, I don't believe you have\nto call all those people.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Why not? Each of them --\nMR. FRIEDMAN: I do believe that there has\nto be --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Each of them looked at a\nspecial part. Each of them said --\nMR. FRIEDMAN: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- that it was this or\nthat, and in respect to each of those statements, it's\nthis or that. That is hearsay.\nMR. FRIEDMAN: Right. The problem, of\ncourse, isn't hearsay. The problem is -- the only\nquestion is --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, no, it's no\nconfrontation because in this instance the hearsay\nprevents the confrontation.\nMR. FRIEDMAN: Right. The -- the\nprosecution has to present the testimony of witnesses.\nIt has to present the testimony live. Depending on\nhow the lab is organized -- usually, labs can organize\nso that only one person needs to -- needs to present.\nIn any event, of course, the State is\nacknowledging that, if the defendant brings -- demands\nthey have to bring in the witnesses, that's not at\nissue.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Your answer to my question\nis, if a laboratory is so organized so that six or\nseven people perform different steps of the operation,\nif it is organized in that way, all of them must be\nbrought?\nMR. FRIEDMAN: I -- I don't believe so. I\nbelieve --\nJUSTICE BREYER: You don't believe so, but\nyou gave me an answer saying they did have to, so --\nbecause you said they could organize differently. So\nnow explain to me why they don't.\nMR. FRIEDMAN: But even if -- even if they\nare organized in that way, for instance, if one person\nobserves all the -- all the procedures, that's\nsufficient. Apart from that, as Melendez-Diaz\nindicates, it's up to the -- it's up to the State to\ndecide what the evidence they are going to present is,\nwhether --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose one person doesn't\nobserve all the procedures. One person prepares the\nsample, another person puts it on the paper, another\nperson reads the machine, another person calibrates\nthe machine.\nMR. FRIEDMAN: Yes. Right. Well, I think\nMelendez-Diaz indicates that it's up to the State to\ndetermine what the -- the evidence that's going to be\npresented, and there may be gaps. I do want to\nemphasize that this is an issue that --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: No, no, no. The evidence\nis presented, and the test comes out so -- positive,\nso that the gun fires or that it's a drug or that it's\na DNA sample. Can the conclusion be presented by one\nwitness from the lab, when that witness did not\nobserve all of the procedures?\nMR. FRIEDMAN: I think -- I think that there\nprobably has to be a witness who has observed the\nprocedures. If I am -- and that's an issue that will\nbe presented to the Court, we can be pretty certain.\nI think that issue is entirely orthogonal to the issue\nhere because the Commonwealth is acknowledging --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry. Entirely\nwhat?\nMR. FRIEDMAN: Orthogonal. Right angle.\nUnrelated. Irrelevant.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Oh.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What was that adjective? I\nlike that.\nMR. FRIEDMAN: Orthogonal.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Orthogonal?\nMR. FRIEDMAN: Right, right.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Ooh.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I knew this case presented\nus a problem.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. FRIEDMAN: I should have -- I probably\nshould have said --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I think we should use that\nin the opinion.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. FRIEDMAN: I thought -- I thought I had\nseen it before.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Or the dissent.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. FRIEDMAN: That's a bit of -- a bit of\nprofessorship creeping in, I suppose.\nBut the Commonwealth is acknowledging that\nthey have to bring in witnesses if the -- if the\ndefense demands, so this is another issue as to who\nare -- who are the witnesses. And it's --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But, in your view, it\nwouldn't satisfy the Confrontation Clause if, say, the\nsupervisor shows up and said that this is -- this is\nthe way the analysts operate and describes the\nprocedures.\nMR. FRIEDMAN: In my view, it wouldn't, but\nif I'm wrong, it doesn't change this case whatsoever.\nIt does not change this case whatsoever. It has\nnothing to do with the issue here. The issue here is\n-- is the witnesses who are going to testify and how\nmuch they -- they testify, and I want to --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, the reason that I ask\nis because floating in the back of my mind is -- is if\n-- (a) does the Confrontation Clause apply?\nMR. FRIEDMAN: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And if the answer to (a) is\nyes, then are there different kinds of implementation\nrules in different areas where there are other signs\nof security, where there are other reasons for\nthinking it's not bad testimony? That line is not\nsomething that's necessarily workable, and -- but I\nbrought it up to try to think about it.\nMR. FRIEDMAN: Yes. I think -- I think it's\nan interesting question, and it's question 3 in the\nevidence exam that I am just grading, in fact. But I\nthink that's an issue that the Court will have to\nresolve.\nAnd, as I say, my views are what they --\nwhat they are, but if you reject my views on that, it\ndoesn't change this case whatsoever.\nWhat I think is important to recognize is\nhow fundamental a transformation in the Anglo-American\ntrial is threatened if -- if the Court were to hold\nthat the prosecution can present an affidavit and\nleave it to the defendant, if he dares, to put the\nwitness on the stand.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, does that square with\nwhere we started out? We have situation A, where the\nprosecutor calls the lab analyst, and the lab analyst\nsays, this is my report, and I stand by it, period.\nNow, it's up to the defense to cross-examine. That's\nsituation A.\nSituation B is the report is admitted\nwithout the analyst present, but the defense can then\n-- without the analyst on the stand --\nMR. FRIEDMAN: Right.\nJUSTICE ALITO: But the defense can then\ncross-examine the analyst.\nMR. FRIEDMAN: I wouldn't call that\ncross-exam --\nJUSTICE ALITO: There's such a slight\ndifference between those two situations. Now, how is\nthat a fundamental transformation of the way\nAnglo-American trials are conducted?\nMR. FRIEDMAN: It's fundamental\ntransformation because the prosecution can present a\nstack of affidavits, and they wouldn't even have to be\naffidavits. They could just be signed -- they could\njust be statements. It could present videotapes. It\ncould present audiotapes. It could craft those and\nrehearse those behind the scene. It could present\nthose to the trial --\nJUSTICE ALITO: No. Let's just not get\nbeyond the facts of this case, where all -- all that\nwe are dealing with is a -- an analyst's report\nrelating to the -- the nature of the substance that\nwas tested and, if it's a controlled substance, the\namount. That's it. It doesn't extend to anything\nelse, videotapes or anything more. There's such a\nslight difference between those two situations.\nMR. FRIEDMAN: I think there's an enormous\ndifference in -- in impact. It's an enormous impact,\nas I've emphasized in my brief, because of the\nimpairment of the ability to examine.\nI don't believe it's cross-examination. In\npractice, it is -- if the defendant said, I don't want\nto cross-examine, but I still insist that the witness\nget up on the stand and let's see what the witness can\ndo -- and the Commonwealth makes no attempt to\ndistinguish between these witnesses and other\nwitnesses for what is -- what is satisfactory\nconfrontation. It says: This is good confrontation.\nHe could do it with all witnesses.\nIf the Court pleases, I will reserve the\nbalance of my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Friedman.\nMR. FRIEDMAN: Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. McCullough.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN R. McCULLOUGH\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. McCULLOUGH: Mr. Chief Justice, and may\nit please the Court:\nI think an appropriate place to start would\nbe how the Supreme Court of Virginia construed the\nstatute and get past that and into the confrontation\nissue.\nThe first thing I would note there is that\nthe Petitioners simply have not challenged the\ndecision of the -- the interpretation of the Supreme\nCourt of Virginia that it placed on the statute. So I\nthink, to the extent that they are now, for the first\ntime in their reply brief, trying to raise a separate\ndue process issue, that the construction of the court\nwas so unreasonable that it violates due process, it's\nfar too late in the day to do that. So I think the\nCourt --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It goes -- that goes to\nthe waiver question.\nMR. McCULLOUGH: Right.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How did they know at\ntrial that they were supposed to say to you: I don't\nwant a subpoena; you bring them in.\nMR. McCULLOUGH: I think the -- the way the\nSupreme Court of Virginia construed the statute is\nperfectly sensible. What it says -- and the key\nphrase is on page 2 of our brief -- that \"no\" --\nexcuse me -- \"such witnesses shall be summoned and\nappear at the cost of the Commonwealth.\" And unlike\nsome statutes that say the defendant shall subpoena or\nshall summon -- for example, like the Idaho and the\nNorth Dakota statutes that the Petitioners cite --\nthey are express in saying it has to be the defendant\nwho issues a summons. This just says \"shall be\nsummoned.\"\nIn a criminal trial at the time these\nPetitioners were being tried, there were two parties\nthat have the authority to issue summons. One was the\nclerk of court; that is, a defendant would go to the\ncourt and say: These are my witnesses; have them\nproduced for trial on this date. And the other was\nthe Commonwealth. So the statute simply doesn't say\nit has to be the Commonwealth, it has to be the\ndefendant. It's silent. The Supreme Court of\nVirginia has a long history of construing statutes in\na way that obviates a constitutional problem.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But you're -- you're\nstill begging the question. How -- they did what any\nreasonable defendant would do and say: I object to\nthe admission of this lab report; I have a right under\nthe Confrontation Clause to have the -- the lab\ntechnician here.\nAnd the Commonwealth court said, no, you\ndon't.\nMR. McCULLOUGH: Right.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And so did the court on\nappeal.\nHow did they know that this was a notice\nand-demand statute as opposed to a subpoena statute?\nMR. McCULLOUGH: I think it was incumbent on\ncounsel to raise the issue exactly like counsel for\nthe defendant did in the Grant case. And I think it's\nnoteworthy that in the Grant case the -- the motion\nwas filed well in advance of trial, on November 2nd,\n2007, before the Supreme Court of Virginia ever\nconstrued the statute in this fashion. And so the\nfact that a statute may be susceptible to more than\none interpretation doesn't obviate the need for\ncounsel to take the steps that are necessary to\nprotect the right.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could I ask you: If we\nwere to -- how do we articulate a rule, or do we need\nto, that would take care of the fears of your\nadversary that trials would become trials by\naffidavit, that the -- that prosecutors will choose to\nput all witnesses on -- by videotape, by affidavit, by\ndeposition, whatever mode they choose except bringing\nthem into court -- and forcing defendants then to call\nthe witnesses and do a what's -- what I call a\ncold-cross?\nWhat rule would we announce in this case --\nMR. McCULLOUGH: I think --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- that would avoid --\nwhat constitutional construction of the Confrontation\nClause would we issue that would protect against that?\nMR. McCULLOUGH: I think there are several\nconstitutional, legal, and practical considerations\nthat make this --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No, no. Forget the\npractical. Talk about the legal, constitutional.\nMR. McCULLOUGH: Right. Constitutionally,\nthere are two obstacles to a wholesale type of trial\nsystem where the prosecution would simply present a\nstack of affidavits.\nThe first of those is the Due Process\nClause, which -- for example, in these child witness\ncases, what a number of courts have held is that it's\ngoing to inflame the jury against the defendant if a\nvideotape is introduced and then the defendant is\ncalled -- forced to call the witness to the stand.\nAnd that's simply not the case with these types of\nwitness. So the Due Process Clause itself puts the\nbrakes on the type of wholesale at-trial --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: They're trial witnesses.\nAnything else?\nMR. McCULLOUGH: Another is the fact that\nunder the Confrontation Clause, the cross-examination\nhas to be effective. And so if the prosecution on the\nday of trial dumps a series of affidavits on the\ndefense, it's going to be pretty difficult for the\ndefense to be in a position to effectively\ncross-examine.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No, just one or two. Just\none or two affidavits. Or it -- the court has a rule\nyou have to provide those affidavits several weeks\nbefore trial. That would be okay?\nMR. McCULLOUGH: I think, under the --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: We'd have a whole\nEuropean-type trial, right? It would be trial by\naffidavit.\nMR. McCULLOUGH: Right. I don't think the\nConfrontation Clause, in terms of what it's\nhistorically intended to protect, blocks that\nscenario.\nI think the key to the Confrontation Clause,\nwhat this Court has said for a long time, turning to\nthe history of the clause, is that it's designed to\nprotect the reliability of the government's evidence.\nAnd the way it does that is by subjecting that to the\ncrucible of cross-examination, face to face, of live\nwitnesses. And this statute protects exactly that;\nthat is, the defendant says he wants the witness there\n--\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It does more than that. It\ndoes more than that. It is the prosecution that has\nhad to place the witness on the stand. It has not\nbeen up to the defense to say, oh, no, I object to\nthis affidavit, I would like you to bring -- no. The\nprosecution has to bring in the witness. That has\nbeen what the Confrontation Clause has meant.\nMR. McCULLOUGH: We agree that we have to\nproduce the witness for court, but we see little\nconstitutional --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No, you don't agree with\nthat. You say you don't have to do it unless the\ndefendant objects and issue -- gets a subpoena issued.\nMR. McCULLOUGH: Well, we agree that if the\ndefendant does provide the notice, as with the notice\nand-demand statute, that it -- that it's our burden to\nmake sure that witness is there. And if -- as the\nstatute provides, the witness has to be summoned and\nappear.\nSo this statute has always been strictly\nconstrued against the prosecution. If it fails to do\nexactly what the statute requires, that cuts against\nthe prosecution. So the witness does have to appear.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: How is that clear from the\nstatute?\nMR. McCULLOUGH: I'm sorry.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: How is that clear from the\nstatute? It just says that a subpoena shall issue.\nWhat if a subpoena issues and nobody comes?\nMR. McCULLOUGH: Right. And it -- the fact\nthat the prosecution -- excuse me, that the statute is\ninterpreted strictly against the prosecution comes\nfrom several decades of jurisprudence from the Supreme\nCourt of Virginia, and we cite those cases on page 1\nour brief.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: A strict construction of\nstatutes in general, or a strict construction of this\nprovision?\nMR. McCULLOUGH: This particular -- this\nparticular statutory scheme. For example, if the --\n19.2-187, the statute that precedes this, says that it\nhas to be filed 7 days before the trial. And if it's\nfiled 6 days, forget it, you have to bring in a live\nwitness.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I'm talking about the\nspecific issue of the person subpoenaed not appearing.\nDo you have a case?\nMR. McCULLOUGH: No, I don't have a case --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So we don't really know.\nMR. McCULLOUGH: -- but I -- but I think the\nanswer follows inexorably --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't know how -- how\nstrict construction gets you to the -- to the result\nthat when it is the defendant who has to take the\ninitiative to get the person brought in, if the person\ndoesn't show up, it's -- it doesn't fall on the\ndefendant; it falls on the prosecution. I don't see\nhow strict construction gets you there.\nMR. McCULLOUGH: The -- the Grant case, for\nexample, which our Court of Appeals of Virginia said\nwas simply was an application of the holding in the\nMagruder decision. There the defendant did -- well in\nadvance of trial, sent notice to the Commonwealth and\nsaid, I want the witness there. The Commonwealth\ndidn't get the subpoena out. So that was the first\npart of that, \"shall be summoned.\" And the court of\nappeals said you should never have allowed this in,\nwithout the live witness being present.\nAnd so what -- although Grant didn't address\nthe appear part, the same answer is true; that is, the\ndefendant says, I want the witness there; the\nCommonwealth issues a summons, but the witness doesn't\nappear. It's the same result.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, I think that\nunderlying this is a fairly simple problem,\nconceptually. Imagine we have Sir Walter Raleigh at\ntrial, and there's an affidavit for missing witness A\nand witness B and witness C, and they are over in a\nroom somewhere, whether they were treated badly or\nnot, and they have written these pieces of paper. In\nthey come.\nAnd Walter Raleigh says: \"Bring me the\nwitness.\" Now, suppose they had trotted him out, and\nhe cross-examined him. Still, those pieces of paper\ncame in, and they weren't cross-examined. And so what\ndo we do about that? They weren't cross-examined, and\nhow did they get in here?\nMR. McCULLOUGH: I think your question goes\nto the very heart of why we have the Confrontation\nClause. It wasn't because of this formalistic order\nof proof that our modern trials have. And -- and one\nthing that makes this case conceptually difficult is\nwe are so accustomed to this clean order of\npresentation -- that -- that that's how we have all\ntried our cases, that's how we are used to seeing\nthem, but that's not the heart of the Confrontation\nClause.\nThe Confrontation Clause is because, for\nexample, the colonists were subject to anonymous --\nJUSTICE BREYER: As I read this statute, it\ndoes let in that piece of paper.\nMR. McCULLOUGH: It does. But --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And so why then, by\nanalogy, isn't the statute bad?\nMR. McCULLOUGH: Well, because --\nJUSTICE BREYER: If -- unless you -- unless\nyou have some special kind -- I mean, you'd have to\nsome special -- specially reliable evidence that sort\nof fell within the Confrontation Clause but not\ntotally. And that's what I -- the more I think about\nthat, the harder that one is to do.\nMR. McCULLOUGH: I think there are --\nJUSTICE BREYERE: So -- so --\nMR. McCULLOUGH: There are characteristics,\nof course, to this particular type of evidence that\nwere debated in this Court's Melendez-Diaz opinion\nthat make this procedure certainly more appropriate,\nand one of those is, these -- what -- functionally\nwhat you are doing when you have this witness on the\nstand is either past recollection recorded or past\nrecollection refreshed, because they are doing\napproximately 900 of these certificates a year. They\nare largely fungible things like -- like crack cocaine\nor powder cocaine. And so we're miles from the type\nof scenario where --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, to put my chips on\nthe table, which you probably understand, I thought\nthe reliability of this evidence in the mine run of\ncases was such, and the distance from Sir Walter\nRaleigh was sufficiently great, that it fell outside\nthe scope of the Confrontation Clause for those two\nreasons, but mine was a dissenting opinion.\nMR. McCULLOUGH: Right. I --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So, therefore, what do I\ndo?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. McCULLOUGH: Well, I think, though, even\n-- even going back to the very heart -- the historical\nheart of this clause, the problems for these colonists\nwas anonymous accusers and absentee witnesses. That's\n-- that's why -- they were enraged because of this\ndeeply unfair trial procedure. It wasn't because, for\nexample, a harbor master might be called in and\nrecords of what ships came in for these colonists who\nwere in the vice admiralty courts, and some paper is\nintroduced about what ships came in, and then they get\nan opportunity to cross-examine them before the\nprosecution has asked any questions of the -- the\nharbor master.\nThat's not the problem, that the\nConfrontation -- Confrontation Clause --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, the problem you\ndescribe, the hearsay rule would have solved that\nalone, wouldn't it?\nMR. McCULLOUGH: Well, that's one of the\npractical --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So -- so what's left for\nthe Confrontation Clause to do?\nMR. McCULLOUGH: Well, the Confrontation\nClause is designed to ensure -- the core of it -- and\nwe agree with this -- is what this Court has said for\na long time, a face-to-face encounter with a witness\nwho is cross-examined face to face, under oath.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But it doesn't have to\nhappen in the prosecutor's case. In other words, the\nprosecutor puts in the reports and rests. And the\ndefendant says, there wasn't sufficient evidence; I\nmove to dismiss the case. It couldn't be dismissed at\nthat point. The prosecutor would prove its case by\nthe affidavit alone.\nMR. McCULLOUGH: Right. But first -- a\ncouple points in response.\nFirst of all, the statute doesn't say at\nwhat point the defendant gets to treat this witness as\nan adverse witness. It just says the report comes in,\nand then the defendant can call the witness as an\nadverse witness. And the Supreme Court of Virginia\ndeliberately left the question of the order of proof\nunresolved, because it viewed those things as a due\nprocess issue. So I don't think it's axiomatic under\nthe statute, although it's possible, that the\ndefendant would conduct a cross-examination during his\ncase.\nBut -- but beyond that, the Confrontation\nClause isn't designed to constitutionalize Federal\nRule of Criminal Procedure 29 or a motion to strike.\nThe defendant could still -- in Virginia procedure,\nit's a motion to strike. The defendant could still\nmake that motion at the close of all the evidence.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And it's still not clear --\nnot clear under the statute that if the witness\ndoesn't show up, it's the prosecution that bears the\nburden.\nMR. McCULLOUGH: No, I think that's very\nclear.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why is that clear?\nMR. McCULLOUGH: Under both the plain\nlanguage of the statute and the way it's been\nconstrued adversely to the Commonwealth. The plain\nlanguage of the statute is the witness shall be\nsummoned and appear. So there's a requirement of\nappearance. And if the defendant asks the prosecutor\nto summon the witness, the witness then has to appear.\nAnd going -- and we cite some of these cases, again on\npage 1 of our brief.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It doesn't say what the\nconsequence of his not appearing is. That the -- that\nthe written testimony is -- stands and is admitted,\nwithout the opportunity to cross-examine the witness?\nMR. McCULLOUGH: The consequence emerges\nfrom this line of cases, Justice Scalia, that if the\n-- the statute requires the witness to appear, and if\nthe Commonwealth doesn't do exactly what the statute\nrequires, a live witness -- or excuse me, the\ncertificate does not come in without the live witness.\nJust like, if you don't -- the statute says file 7\ndays before court.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No, the prosecutor issues\nthe subpoena.\nMR. McCULLOUGH: Right. And that would --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The witness does not show\nup.\nMR. McCULLOUGH: Right.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I'm not talking about fault\non the part of the prosecutor. I'm talking about the\nfact that the witness has died, has fled the State, is\nsimply not available.\nMR. McCULLOUGH: But I think the language\nanswers that. The witness has to appear. The statute\nsays shall be summoned, and the requirement is that\nthe witness appear. If the witness does not appear --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Of course, he is required\nto appear. But what happens if he doesn't appear?\nMR. McCULLOUGH: I'm sorry, but we seem to\nbe going in -- in circles. And I want to answer your\nquestion.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No, we're not going in\ncircles at all. You -- you appeal to the language\nthat the witness shall appear as resolving what\nhappens when he doesn't, and it doesn't resolve that.\nIt just says he must appear. And if he doesn't appear,\nwhat happens?\nMR. McCULLOUGH: If he doesn't appear, the\nCommonwealth has failed to do what the statute\nrequires, which is to make sure the witness appears.\nAnd if the Commonwealth fails to do exactly what the\nstatute requires, it must -- it cannot rely on a piece\nof paper.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I don't see the\nstatute requiring that. It requires that of the\nwitness, he shall appear.\nMR. McCULLOUGH: And -- I mean, to the\nextent there's -- there's any question about that, I\ndon't think it's a matter that this Court should\nresolve in the first instance. I think it would be a\nmatter of remand to the Supreme Court of Virginia to\ndetermine what -- what the statute requires in that\ninstance.\nLet me just spend a moment since we've\ntalked about the costs. Our experience in Virginia,\nwe -- of course, we've repealed this statute. This\nCourt signaled in Melendez-Diaz what a safe harbor\nwas, with notice and demand, and so we went there.\nAnd what we have seen under our new statute\nis rampant demands for the witness to appear, followed\nby: Oh, well, he's here; I'll stipulate. Or no\nquestions of the witness. So our experience under\nthis old statute compared to our new one is that we\nhad far more -- or far less under our old statute of\nthis sort of tactical demands for confrontation.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: How new is the new one?\nMR. McCULLOUGH: It went into effect\nAugust 21, 2009.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. The -- the reply\nbrief of -- of the Petitioners mentions that -- that\nthe same thing, a spike occurred in other\njurisdictions after Melendez-Diaz, but then the spike\nwent down, after -- after 6 months or a short period.\nMR. McCULLOUGH: The spike has plateaued\nsomewhat in Virginia, but we are still seeing\nextensive gamesmanship. And I think --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What is peculiar about\nVirginia that -- or what is peculiar about Michigan or\nthe other States that have this system and somehow are\nable to live with it?\nMR. McCULLOUGH: Well, I think --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Virginia criminals are\nnastier; is that it?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. McCULLOUGH: No, I -- I think -- I -- I\ndon't know that -- that there's anything particularly\ndifferent about Virginia criminals. I will say that\nthis type of statute -- as this Court noted in\nMelendez-Diaz, defense attorneys don't want to\nnecessarily antagonize the court and so on by making\nthese kinds of gamesmanship demands.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Right.\nMR. McCULLOUGH: Well, a cross-examination\nfocused statute like this one more blatantly exposes\nthat type of gamesmanship and, therefore, may have a\nbetter deterrent value, as opposed to a garden variety\nstatute.\nI do want to just say, really briefly, that\nthe practical concerns, even if they are not\nconstitutional concerns, are very important because\nthe prosecution always bears the burden of persuasion,\nand a live witness is always more compelling than a\npiece of paper.\nAnd so the -- the practical realities of\nthis -- a trial by affidavit simply are not likely to\nbe there.\nI see my time's expired. I thank the Court.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMs. Kruger.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF LEONDRA R. KRUGER\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,\nAS AMICUS CURIAE,\nSUPPORTING RESPONDENT\nMS. KRUGER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nA State adequately safeguards the\nconfrontation right recognized in Melendez-Diaz when\nit guarantees that it will, on the defendant's\nrequest, bring the analyst into court for face-to-face\nconfrontation and cross-examination at trial.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's not what we said in\nMelendez-Diaz, unfortunately.\nMS. KRUGER: Well, Melendez-Diaz --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: We said the following:\n\"More fundamentally, the Confrontation Clause imposes\na burden on the prosecution to present its witnesses,\nnot on the defendant to bring those adverse witnesses\ninto court. Its value to the defendant is not\nreplaced by a system in which the prosecution presents\nits evidence via ex parte affidavits and waits for the\ndefendant to subpoena the affiants, if he chooses.\"\nSo you are asking us to overrule that --\nthat statement?\nMS. KRUGER: No, Justice Scalia, not at all.\nWe believe that a State complies with that very rule\nfrom Melendez-Diaz when it ensures that the analyst is\npresent in court to submit to cross-examination, which\nis the core of the confrontation right. This Court\naffirmed in its decision --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: He's present only if the\ndefendant asks for him, right?\nMS. KRUGER: That's right, and that's --\nthat's because --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And that's exactly what\nthis addressed. It's not -- it's not replaced by a\nsystem in which the prosecution presents its evidence\nby -- and waits for the defendant to subpoena the\naffiants if he chooses.\nMS. KRUGER: This Court has recognized that\nthe confrontation right is designed to achieve a\nparticular purpose, and that is to ensure that the\ngovernment's evidence is subject to adversarial\ntesting at trial.\nIt is ultimately up to the defendant in\nevery case to decide, no matter how the prosecution\npresents its evidence on direct, whether or not it\nwants to confront the witness and submit that\nwitness's testimony to adversarial testing --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That may be. It's a\nperfectly reasonable argument. I just object to your\nsaying that it doesn't contradict Melendez-Diaz.\nMS. KRUGER: I think it would be surprising\nto discover that Melendez-Diaz went quite so far.\nThis Court has never before recognized a dimension of\nthe Confrontation Clause that would govern the manner\nin which the prosecution presents its evidence, except\nfor the rule that it affirmed it in Crawford, which is\nthat so long as the government ensures that the\nwitness is available for cross-examination at trial,\nthe Confrontation Clause places no constraints on the\ngovernment's use of prior testimony or statements.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. So the\nstatement, the sentence in this opinion, that, in your\nopinion, would have the effect of limiting\nMelendez-Diaz without overruling it, what is that\nstatement?\nMS. KRUGER: I think the statement is it\nrequires only that the Court reaffirm what it already\nsaid in Crawford, in the context of the lab analyst\ntestimony at issue in this case, which is, again, when\nthe analyst is available for cross-examination at\ntrial, the government has complied with what the\nConfrontation Clause demands.\nIt has provided a constitutionally\nsufficient opportunity for the defendants to submit\nthat analyst's findings to adversarial testing --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And it just doesn't --\ndoesn't apply just to analysts, right? I mean, is\nthere anything peculiar about analysts? Would it not\nexist for any other witness?\nMS. KRUGER: Well, our principal submission\nis that the Confrontation Clause provides, in every\ncase, an opportunity for effective cross-examination.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Okay.\nMS. KRUGER: And there may be independent\nconstraints on the manner in which the prosecution\npresents its evidence under the laws of evidence in\nthe jurisdiction because of the government's need to\nsatisfy its burden of proof and ensure a fundamentally\nfair trial under the Due Process Clause.\nTo the extent that the Court --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't understand what --\nis that a yes or a no?\nMS. KRUGER: Well, it is to say that\nConfrontation Clause is not what prohibits that\npractice. What prohibits that practice are other\nequally effective sources in the law --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. So as far as the\nConfrontation Clause is concerned, this would apply to\nother witnesses as well?\nMS. KRUGER: I think that that's right, but\neven if the Court were to disagree with that\nsubmission, this Court could rely on the kinds of\ndistinctions that it has drawn in other cases, like\nInadi or like White v. Illinois, which recognized that\nthere is a class of hearsay evidence that's not simply\na weaker substitute for live testimony at trial, that\nhas independent, probative significance that makes it\nsomewhat irrelevant whether or not the court --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Indicia of reliability --\nyou want us to go back to that? Is that --\n(Laughter.)\nMS. KRUGER: No, it's not a question of the\nreliability. What Crawford did was replace a system\nin which hearsay evidence and its admissibility was\ndependent on reliability with one in which the\ntouchstone is an opportunity for cross-examination.\nAnd it's precisely in response to that point\nthat Crawford, again, reaffirmed the rule that it\nfirst announced in Green, that so long as the\nout-of-court declarant is present at trial to explain\nor defend his out-of-court statements, the\nConfrontation Clause is satisfied.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What if it doesn't quite\nwork, that the Confrontation Clause seems to be\nexpanding, just with the opportunity for\ncross-examination creating all kinds of incursions\ninto areas where it's not necessary for fairness\npurposes?\nThen does it make sense to say -- hey,\nunfortunately, to say that the only workable system is\nthat you have a system which has exactly the\nconfrontation point, but indicia of reliability do\nhave an impact as to what the implications of the\nConfrontation Clause violation are, in terms of\npractical trial necessity.\nMS. KRUGER: But --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Now, there we are,\naccepting the warnings of the dissenters in Crawford.\n(Laughter.)\nMS. KRUGER: I don't think that the\ntouchstone of this Court's analysis need return to the\nnow discredited Ohio v. Roberts regime.\nIt's simply a practical point. To the\nextent the Petitioners are arguing that their\nopportunity to confront and to cross-examine is\nconstitutionally inadequate merely because the\nprosecution hasn't guaranteed that it would call the\nwitness to the stand first, I think the court can take\ndue account of the fact that that is not necessarily\nso.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, what about Raleigh's\nwitnesses -- you know, the hypothetical I gave you,\nfor the heart of the matter, the heart of the matter,\nand they stick it in their affidavits, and you say,\noh, don't worry, don't worry, you can cross-examine\nthem later in the trial.\nMS. KRUGER: I think, to the extent that the\nCourt were otherwise inclined to invent a new body of\nConfrontation Clause jurisprudence to govern the\nmanner in which the prosecution puts on its witnesses\nand questions them, this isn't the appropriate case to\ndo it because, as we have seen from Petitioners'\nsubmission earlier this morning, there is no\nsubstantive difference from a defendant's\nperspective --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could you -- are you\nsuggesting or are you saying even a trial by affidavit\nis okay under the Confrontation Clause? Is that your\nposition?\nMS. KRUGER: Our principal submission is\nthat the Confrontation Clause allows the government to\nrely on affidavits, so long as it bring the affiants\ninto court, so that the defendant can ask whatever\nquestions --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So you are absolutely\nsaying that, under the Confrontation Clause, trial by\naffidavit of any witness would be okay.\nMS. KRUGER: That is our principal --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So are you -- are you\nthen saying that there is some other constitutional\nlimit to that choice, outside of the Confrontation\nClause? And if you are, what would be that other\nconstitutional limit?\nMS. KRUGER: We do think that there are\nconstitutional limits in the Due Process Clause, and\nit's guaranteeing the right to --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, how many hundreds of\ncases will it take to identify those limits under that\nvery clear Due Process Clause?\n(Laughter.)\nMS. KRUGER: Well, it's -- it's somewhat of\na difficult question to answer because this is not a\nquestion that arises particularly frequently. The\nlaws of evidence, as a general matter, express a\nstrong preference for the prosecution to present its\nevidence through live testimony --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Don't we want clear rules\nfor the presentation? Don't we want clear rules, not\ngambling on what the Supreme Court will say about due\nprocess?\nMS. KRUGER: I think that it's difficult to\nimagine that a new-found constitutional rule that\nwould require the prosecution to present its evidence\nin a certain way in every case would lead to that sort\nof clarity. It would, if anything, create --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Ms. Kruger, can I just ask\nthis question? I just want to be sure. Supposing you\nhave an eyewitness. Can you follow the same procedure\nthat you recommend for the scientific witness here --\nand for an eyewitness?\nMS. KRUGER: We think that you could, so\nlong as the defendant has an adequate opportunity to\ncross-examine that eye witness about the testimonial\nstatement.\nBut even if you disagreed with that, we\nthink that the Court can take due account of the fact\nthat there is a significant difference between the\nkind of testimony that an eyewitness provides and the\nkind of testimony that a forensic analyst provides.\nThe forensic analyst's lab report is not\nmerely a weaker substitute for live testimony. It is,\nin fact, I think, as we see by the relative\ninfrequency with which analysts were called into court\nbefore Melendez-Diaz, something that has been seen to\nhave equal value, regardless of the manner in which\nit's presented.\nAnd, for that reason, we think that, in\norder to decide this case, all this Court needs to\ndecide is that, in the context of forensic lab\nanalysts, what the Court said in Crawford still\nstands, so long as the government presents the analyst\nat trial for face-to-face confrontation and\ncross-examination.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why -- why do we have to\nsay anything in this case? Why is this case here\nexcept as an opportunity to upset Melendez-Diaz?\nMS. KRUGER: I think that --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: This Virginia statute no\nlonger exists, does it? So we are pronouncing on the\nvalidity of a Virginia statute that is now gone,\nright? They have adopted a statute that complies\ncompletely with Melendez-Diaz.\nMS. KRUGER: That's true, and I think that\nthat's because Virginia was unwilling to stake the\nvalidity of however many convictions in the interim\non the outcome of a case. But this --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I'm not criticizing\nVirginia; I'm criticizing us for taking the case.\n(Laughter.)\nMS. KRUGER: I think that this -- this case\npresents, I think, an important opportunity for the\nCourt to provide guidance to States that are currently\ngrappling with how to respond to the practical\nproblems that have been presented in the wake of\nMelendez-Diaz.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So do we say to them,\ncontrary to what Melendez-Diaz is, that subpoena\nstatutes -- when you read the statute, it says the\ndefendant has to subpoena the witness. On its -- on\nthe face of this statute, without the Commonwealth\ncourt's gloss on it --\nMS. KRUGER: I don't mean to quibble,\nJustice Sotomayor, but the statute does not in fact on\nits face say the defendant must subpoena. It says the\nwitness shall be summoned. But I think to the extent\nthat you had any questions about whether or not the\nCommonwealth's interpretation of that language were\ncorrect, the appropriate course would be to remand to\nthe Virginia Supreme Court to allow them to address\nthat question of State law in the first instance.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That question of prior\nState law, right?\nMS. KRUGER: Thank you, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Friedman, you have 4 minutes left.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD D. FRIEDMAN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. FRIEDMAN: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nThis is not a notice-and-demand statute. It\ndoes not even provide notice to the defendant unless\nhe asks for it ahead of time. It doesn't give any\ndeadline as to when he should make a demand or take\nany other action. It just says that -- and I invite\nthe Court's attention to the language of the\nstatute -- it says that the defendant may cause the\nwitness to be summoned.\nThere's no -- there's no deadline. It\ndoesn't put the burden of no-shows on the prosecution.\nIt's the defendant's witness, and it clearly doesn't\ncall -- it doesn't provide that the prosecution should\ncall the -- the witness. Virginia --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, the -- just\nthe first one, the no-notice problem, that's kind of\nsilly, isn't it? Because if you are being prosecuted\nfor 50 grams of crack cocaine, you can expect the\ngovernment is going to try to prove that.\nMR. FRIEDMAN: That's likely, of course.\nBut the fact is Virginia knows how to write a good\nnotice-and-demand statute and has done it, and\ncontrast the -- the new statute, which gives 28 days\nnotice. It's -- it's very glaring. If Virginia\nwanted to write a notice-and-demand statute before, it\ncould have.\nNow, I think I can explain what's different\nabout Virginia. And what happened is after the --\nafter the defendants' -- after the defendants' trials\n-- let me say, after the defendants' trials, the --\nthe prosecution is saying, you could have subpoenaed.\nAnd they said this isn't testimony. Okay? They were\nwrong on both of those counts.\nAfter the defendants' trials, in a case\ncalled Brooks, the -- the Virginia Court of Appeals\nsuggested that the defendant could ask the prosecution\nto bring the witness in. Many defendants did that,\nincluding Grant, the defendant on whom -- in the case\non whom the Commonwealth relies so heavily.\nThe prosecution ignored those requests. It\nwas still taking the view that this is not -- this is\nnot testimonial. Up until the moment that this Court\ndecided Melendez-Diaz, the Commonwealth in Virginia\nin -- in Grant said, we don't have to bring the\nwitness in; the witness -- the defendant should\nsubpoena the witness if he wants.\nNo court has ever held -- no court has ever\nheld in Virginia that the prosecution bears the risk\nof -- of no-shows.\nNow, the Commonwealth and the United States\nsuggest: Oh, it's okay to -- to transform the way\ntrials are conducted by allowing the prosecution to\npresent affidavits because you can backfill with the\nDue Process Clause. I think that goes against\ndecisions of this Court that say when there's a\nspecific right addressed to a particular situation, we\nrely on that, not on the Due Process Clause.\nJUSTICE ALITO: But I take it your position\nis it wouldn't matter. If the -- if Virginia said\nthat the -- the Commonwealth bears the risk of a\nno-show, that wouldn't make any difference?\nMR. FRIEDMAN: That would -- that would not\nbe enough, no. It's enough -- it's enough --\nJUSTICE ALITO: So we have to assume that\nthat's the case.\nMR. FRIEDMAN: Well, that's -- that's one\nproblem. The no-show. But --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, would you like us --\nMR. FRIEDMAN: -- but there are two -- they\nare both problems.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Would you like us to grant,\nvacate, and remand in this case and say because it's\nunclear who has the risk of a no-show?\nMR. FRIEDMAN: No, no, no, Your --\nJUSTICE ALITO: And then Supreme Court of\nVirginia on remand could decide whether in fact the --\nthe prosecution bore that risk?\nMR. FRIEDMAN: No, Your Honor, because it's\nsufficient that the statute is very clear and the\nCommonwealth doesn't deny that it's the defendant's\nburden under the statute to call the witness to the\nstand. So whatever the no-show issue, however that\nmight stand under State law, what Melendez-Diaz called\nthe more fundamental problem, which is that the\nstatute imposes on the defense the burden of calling a\nwitness to the stand, is clearly provided for in this\nstatute. So there's no reason --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Do you think Melendez-Diaz\naddressed the question of the order of proof? Where\ndid it address that?\nMR. FRIEDMAN: I don't think this is a\nquestion of order of proof. This is a question of who\nputs the witness on the stand. Melendez addressed\nthat very explicitly in part III-E and said that an\naffidavit doesn't do, that the prosecution has to\npresent prosecution witnesses.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So is the proper solution\nto grant, vacate, and remand in light of\nMelendez-Diaz?\nMR. FRIEDMAN: May -- may I respond to that?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes.\nMR. FRIEDMAN: Thank you.\nYour Honor, I think that the -- the proper\nresponse here is the Court has taken the case; there\nis enough without any -- resolving any ambiguities of\nthe Virginia statute to say that the -- this procedure\nis unconstitutional, because it imposes -- even\nwithout worrying about the no-show point, it imposes\nupon the defendant the burden of putting the witness\non the stand. Given that all these States and the\nUnited States are contesting that this procedure is\nacceptable, I think it's proper for the Court to say\nright now that it -- that it is not.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
