Mr. Fisher.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L. FISHER\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. FISHER: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may\nit please the Court:\nComplaints alleging violations of the FCC's\npay phone compensation regulations allege just that,\nviolations of regulations. The regulatory violations do\nnot give rise to private cause of action under section\n206 and 207 of the Communications Act. The proper point\nof departure in this case begins at section 276. There\nCongress directed the FCC to create a system guaranteeing\npay phone providers compensation for the services that\nthey provide to callers who make dial around calls.\nThere can be little doubt that the FCC has ample\nauthority to enforce the system it created\nadministratively.\nBut nothing in Section 276 or anywhere else\nin the Act contemplates that violations of the FCC's\nimplementing regulations should give rise to a private\ncause of action for damages in Federal court.\nAccordingly, this Court should reverse the Ninth\nCircuit's decision allowing pay phone operators to bring\nthrough the back door the kinds of cases that Congress\ndeclined to allow through the front.\nThere's nothing upsetting about reaching\nthat result here. The Communications Act quite sensibly\nlimits private damages actions in Federal court to those\nalleging violations of the Act itself. And claims that\nlong distance providers -- I'm sorry -- claims that long\ndistance providers have violated the pay phone\ncompensation regulations require the parsing and the\napplication of the extraordinarily complex and\never-changing FCC rules and regulations and orders.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Fisher, may I ask you this\nquestion? In your view, did the regulations create a\nlegally enforceable obligation?\nMR. FISHER: Yes, Justice Stevens.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And where may that obligation be\nenforced?\nMR. FISHER: Our position is that can be fully\nenforced in the FCC. And in fact, the FCC is hearing\ncomplaints like this all the time.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: By means of a private action\nbefore the FCC?\nMR. FISHER: Yes, by means of an administrative\naction before the FCC.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Where the carrier -- where they\nwould file a complaint saying you owe us X dollars, and\nthe agency could order them to pay X dollars.\nMR. FISHER: That's right. And if you look at the\nSprint amicus brief at page 23, the brief cites several\ncases just like this one that the FCC has fully\nadjudicated and in some cases awarded damages.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And is the obligation\nenforceable in State court?\nMR. FISHER: No, we believe -- of course, this\nCourt did not grant certiorari --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I understand that. I'm curious\nto know what your view is.\nMR. FISHER: If this Court holds there is no\nprivate cause of action in Federal court, then it is not\nenforceable in state court either. Our position is that\nthere is only an administrative remedy that's available.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But the administrative remedy\nthat you just conceded is a counterpart to a private\nright of action, or isn't it? Would you get the same\nthing? I complained to the agency, and say, I didn't get\n-- the pay phone provider wasn't paid, and X under the\ncommission's regulations was supposed to pay it. So I\ncomplained against X. Could I get before the FCC exactly\nwhat I could get in court, so that we're only talking\nabout which form is proper, or is there a difference in\nthe remedy?\nMR. FISHER: In terms of damages, we're talking\nabout exactly the same thing, Justice Ginsburg. The only\ndifference between being in Federal court as opposed to\nthe agency is that if you're in Federal court, the\nCommunications Act has a fee shifting provision. And we\nthink that further underscores the Congress's scheme\nhere, which is to reserve Federal court actions for\nserious violations of the Communications Act, and that's\nwhere fee shifting kicks in. Ordinary --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And before the agency, you\ndon't get counsel fees?\nMR. FISHER: That's right.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Fisher, I realize you don't\nconcede, in fact, quite to the contrary, you deny that\nthe failure to pay the full rate is -- could be\nconsidered a practice here. But let's assume for the\nsake of argument that it is a practice within the meaning\nof the text.\nIf the -- if the agency had explicitly said, what\nwe are doing here in defining this practice as unlawful\nor unjust, is to define it as such within the meaning of,\nwhat is it, 201(b), so they make explicit reference to\nthe statute and they say, we are fleshing out the\nstatute, would your position be the same?\nMR. FISHER: I think that's very much what the\nCommission is contending here Justice Souter.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But it wasn't textually as nice\nas that?\nMR. FISHER: Right.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But they have made it that,\nhaven't they, in a later regulation? Haven't they said\njust that.\nMR. FISHER: In a later order, Justice Scalia.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: In a later order, yes.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Let's assume in the reg itself,\nthey were that precise. Would your position be exactly\nthe same?\nMR. FISHER: Yes. The result would be the same.\nAnd I think you're asking me to put aside for the moment\nwhether the FCC was correct in saying it was a covered\npractice.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Sure.\nMR. FISHER: And in terms of the FCC calling this\nunjust and unreasonable, the problem with that is that\nthe only reason the FCC has ever given that this is\nunjust and unreasonable is because it violates its\nregulations. And if there's one thing we know from the\nstructure of the Communications Act, it's that for\nsomething to be remedial in Federal court, in other\nwords -- and if we know something violates 201, it is\nremediable.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.\nMR. FISHER: It has to be.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: You invite me to change the\nhypothetical, then, by jacking it up in this respect.\nThe FCC gives the reason. And it says, the reason it's\nunjust and unreasonable is that the carriers are getting\na free ride on the pay phones, et cetera.\nSo they fill in the gap that you claim.\nThey have a reason. Would your answer or your position\nstill be the same?\nMR. FISHER: Yes, because the reasoning the FCC\nwould give simply would not be a permissible construction\nof the terms unjust and unreasonable in 201(b).\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Are there any times under any\ncircumstances that you can think of in which the FCC can\nadequately and validly define a practice as unjust and\nunreasonable within the meaning of the statute so that,\nin fact, in applying the statute, we would follow -- be\nbound to follow the regs?\nMR. FISHER: Of course, in the vast majority. Let\nme give you some examples, and then I'll distinguish it\nfrom this case. The easiest example is rate of return\nregulations that the FCC can pronounce. So the FCC can\nsay how much long distance companies are able to charge\nfor certain services. Fleshing out the amount that they\ncan charge so that they're not in effect gouging\nconsumers is a regulation that this Court could look to,\nbut --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. But why can't they pass a\nregulation that says don't gouge pay phone operators?\nMR. FISHER: Well, that goes to the heart of this\ncase, Justice Souter, in the kind of regulations that we\nhave. What we have here is not the FCC telling long\ndistance providers to give pay phone operators money that\nlong distance operators ought to owe pay phone operators.\nThe money that's at issue here, the 24 cents per\ncall is the money that callers owe the pay phone\noperators. If you look back at the D.C. Circuit's\ndecision --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, do they? I mean, the\nstatute of the United States says that -- I think I'm\ncorrect -- the statute of the United States says they\ncan't be required, the caller cannot be required to put\nin the quarter in order to get the 800 number and so on.\nSo as a matter of law, don't we have to say that\nthe, in practical terms, the caller doesn't owe?\nSomebody owes. Somebody ought to pay for the use of this\nfacility. But Congress has said it is not the end user.\nMR. FISHER: You are right, Justice Souter,\ninsofar as we're trying to capture the money here for\nessentially the equipment rental or the access fee that\nthe caller is availing himself of. But Congress has not\nsaid that money cannot rest on the caller's shoulders.\nAll Congress says in Section 226 is that the caller\ncannot be required to pay in advance.\nThe FCC during its rulemaking proceedings actually\nconsidered two alternatives where the caller would have\npaid in full compliance with Section 226. One would be\nthe caller paying with a later billing device like a\ncredit card, billing it to their home phone number.\nAnother option the FCC considered would have been\nwhere the long distance providers would have billed\ncustomers on behalf of the pay phone operators. Either\nway, the customer would have paid. Even the respondent\nin his brief openly --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, the customer is going to\npay if, in fact, the long distance carrier is the one who\nhas to make the immediate payment, because that payment\nis going to be figured in the long distance rate. So\nthat ultimately, the end user is going to pay for the\nservice he gets, and Congress is simply saying, the way\nto make this thing work in a sensible and simple way is\nto require the long distance carrier to make the\nreimbursement.\nThe economic end result is exactly the same as it\nwould have been if they had said, well, you can send a\nbill for 25 cents to the end user.\nMR. FISHER: The economic result may be the same,\nbut with all due respect, Congress has not decreed that\nthe administrative system work this way.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: It hasn't decreed\notherwise.\nMR. FISHER: It hasn't decreed otherwise.\nCongress essentially --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Isn't that the classic situation\nin which agencies are supposed to figure out what to do?\nMR. FISHER: Congress gave the FCC power in 276 to\ncome up with a plan. But this case, as the Ninth Circuit\ndecided it is not under 276, it is under 201, so the\nquestion is whether failing to comply with the\nadministrative plan --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, as I understand it, it came\nto the conclusion not that they were not acting under\n276, but that, in fact, the cause of action has to refer\nback to 201.\nMR. FISHER: That's right. I'm sorry. It brings\nus back to the question that you asked: Whether the\nNinth Circuit, or the FCC for that matter, can shoehorn\nthis into 201 as an unjust and unreasonable practice.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: In your answer for why\nthey can't, Justice Souter's comment is a classic, this\nis what administrative agencies do all the time in\ntypical rate regulations. They make a determination that\nutility shareholders have to bear this cost. The rate\npayers can bear this cost. And at the end of the day, it\nis a determination that a rate is reasonable or\nunreasonable.\nAnd it seems to me that that is just what is\ninvolved here. I don't know why their determination\nabout how to allocate who has to collect the rates, and\nwhether they can pass them on or not makes it an\nimpermissible interpretation of what's unjust or\nunreasonable under 201.\nMR. FISHER: Well, Chief Justice Roberts, the FCC\nwas unquestionably acting under 276 when it did this. So\nthe question is whether you can go back to 201. And as I\nsaid, you need to start with section 206 and 207 because\nwe're in Federal court. And that says that violations of\nthe Act are remediable but not of regulations, in\ncontrast to numerous other sections.\nSo the question in asking whether it violates 201,\nit has to be something more than simply the FCC's\nregulation wasn't followed. And we need to ask ourselves\nwhat kind of regulation is it.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Are rate making regulations\nissued under 201, do they purport to be the FCC's\ndefinition of what is just and reasonable compensation?\nMR. FISHER: That's right. That's what I conceded\nto Justice Souter earlier.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: They are issued under 201.\nMR. FISHER: I think largely they are.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So they are an interpretation of\nthe statutory language in 201.\nMR. FISHER: That's right.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And you say this one is not.\nMR. FISHER: That's right. And this Court can\nlook several places, but it can first look to\nthese -- this regulatory regime that was created, which\nwas always thought of as being triggered by section 276.\nAnd then asking --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: When you say it was always\nthought of as being triggered by 276, did the FCC\nreference 201 in issuing its determination that a failure\nto follow these regulations was unjust and unreasonable?\nMR. FISHER: In its order, it references 276 and\n201. In the regulations -- I thought I was being asked\nabout the regulations -- it leads with 276.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose it issued the regulation\nafter notice and comment, and said -- violation of the\npay phone order is an unjust and unreasonable practice,\nwould the case be different?\nMR. FISHER: No, it wouldn't be. And I think I\nwant to flesh out and make sure I've gotten across the\ndistinction between the rate making --\nJUSTICE BREYER: You haven't. Maybe -- if this\ndoesn't clarify it. I think everyone has about the same\nquestion. You have a bunch of pay phone operators. And\nif the AT&T were charging them too much, I think everybody\nwould say that the FCC can say, hey, that's too much. You\nowe them 2 cents a call refund, and everybody would agree\nthat the people who are hurt could go into court and bring\na lawsuit and get the 2 cents. Right under 47 U.S.C.\n201(b).\nNow, the only difference here seems to be that it\nwasn't AT&T that was charging, in my example, too much.\nThey weren't paying what they owed. They should have\npaid what they owed. And that, says the FCC, is, under\n201(b), an unreasonable practice. And, therefore, go in\nand collect it in court. Now, what is the answer to\nthat?\nSo far I have heard nothing that suggests\nthat this couldn't be an unreasonable practice under\n201(b), which is just what the FCC said it was. Now,\nwhat's wrong with what I said? I'm simply trying to\nfocus you upon what I think is the question that's\nbothering some of us.\nMR. FISHER: There are two things that are wrong\nwith that, Justice Breyer. The first thing is that in\ncontrast to ordinary rate making regulations, here, in\nthe absence of regulations, long distance providers would\nowe pay phone operators zero. There's no reason why long\ndistance providers would give money to pay phone\noperators.\nThe 24 cents here is to capture what callers\nowe the pay phone operators. And so the FCC has come up\nwith an administrative system. But there's nothing\nunjust or unreasonable about long distance providers not\ngiving money to pay phone operators before the regulatory\nregime drops into place, whereas there is plenty that is\nunjust and unreasonable about overcharging, for example\n--\nJUSTICE BREYER: So, my answer -- not answer, but\nmy characterization of what you have just said is that the\nFCC did say it was an unreasonable practice. But in your\nview, it was not an unreasonable practice not to pay.\nAnd you want us to go back and second-guess, which\nwe could, if their view of unreasonable practice is\nunreasonable itself. And I guess you would have to\noverturn it. I didn't know that was what the case was\nabout, but are you saying now that that's the issue?\nThey said it was an unreasonable practice not to pay this\nmoney, you think it is a reasonable practice not to pay\nthe money. There is a dispute. That's what we should\ndo.\nMR. FISHER: No.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay. Then what should we do?\nMR. FISHER: Well, what you should do is reverse\nthe Ninth Circuit.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You say it would be a reasonable\npractice not to pay the money, but for the existence of\nthe regulation.\nMR. FISHER: That's exactly right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Just like AT&T when, in fact --\nor any other utility that, in fact, runs into situations\nevery day of the week, where but for an FCC regulation,\nthey would not be overcharging, because they have a way\nof doing it that isn't on its face unjust. But the FCC\nwrites some regulations and now it is unjust. So I guess\nto take that argument would overturn, I guess, about a\nhundred years of rate making law. Wouldn't it?\nMR. FISHER: No, it wouldn't. Justice Scalia, I\nthink, has captained that position. And what we're\nsaying is the FCC can pick a fair rate once it is\nsomething that long distance providers or any common\ncarrier ought to be compensating somebody for. But what\nwe are saying here is, this is a purely administrative\ncreature. And then it gets to the second reason why --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So in other words, you are saying\n-- I think it is common that the FCC might write some\naccounting rules, for example. And they might say,\nbefore these accounting rules, Mr. Bell's system in San\nFrancisco, you could charge people 8 cents a call. But\ngiven the way we set up the accounting rules, we think\nthis month you have to do 7 cents in the first six\nmonths, 7 cents, in the next six months, 9 cents. And\nany deviation from that is unreasonable. And the company\ndoes deviate. I would have always thought when they do\ndeviate, they are behaving unreasonably, and someone who\npays too much could go into court and get money back.\nAm I wrong about that?\nMR. FISHER: No, you would have been right,\nJustice Breyer. We're not asking -- even the Louisiana\nPublic Service Commission is another example of\nsomething. And that brings me -- I think I should go\nback to what --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Before you go back, let's hear\nabout the accounting rules. What would they be issued\nunder? Would they be issued under 201?\nMR. FISHER: They might. The question that we\nwould ask is whether it affects carriers' relationships\nto their customers. Now, under Justice Breyer's\nhypothetical, and this is the Louisiana Public Service\nCommission --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It seems to me accounting rules\n-- in order to decide what is just and reasonable, you\nhave to have accounting rules. So the accounting rules\nfit very comfortably under 201.\nMR. FISHER: I don't think we're disagreeing.\nWhat I want to do is distinguish those from the case we\nhave here, and go back to Justice Souter's --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: May I focus your return to me?\nBecause I want to take up with where your answer to\nJustice Scalia left off. As I understand it, you were\nsaying that the rate in this case is unreasonable because\nthe party or the person who is responsible for the use of\nthe pay phone facilities is the person who's making the\ncall, not the long distance carrier.\nMy question to you is, isn't that simply a choice\nof characterization? Because another way of looking at\nit would be that the person who makes the call wants to\nuse long distance facilities to get to the person he\nwants to talk to. And, therefore, the long distance\nfacility in every pay phone case is using the pay phone\nin order to get the customer to what the long distance\nfacility provides.\nWhy then isn't it just as fair to characterize the\nuse of the pay phone here as for the benefit of the\ncarrier as for the benefit of the customer? And if that\nis just as fair, doesn't that end the distinction that\nyou drew with Justice Scalia saying that it is not fair\nin this case.\nMR. FISHER: No, for two reasons. The first is --\nI just want to be clear, we are not challenging the FCC's\nauthority to have created the regulatory regime it did\nunder 276. So the FCC could well have picked, as it did,\nlong distance providers to be on the ultimate hook here.\nBut the reason -- but the problem with saying that\n-- I'm sorry. I lost the train of thought in your\nquestion.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: My question is simply, you can\nsay -- one way of looking at this transaction is, it is\nthe guy making the call who's using it. Another way is\nto say the long distance facilities carrier is using it\nto get the call to the long distance facility. If you\nlook at it in way B, doesn't your argument for\nunreasonableness disappear?\nMR. FISHER: Thank you. That would be an entirely\ndifferent case than the one we have here, Justice Souter.\nThe 24 cents that the respondent is seeking to recoup\nhere, if you go back and look at the regulatory system --\nand that's what they are asking for, is the 24 cents that\nthe FCC regulations entitle us to -- was calculated -- in\nfact, the D.C. Circuit made the FCC go through this\nexercise three times to get it right. So to calculate\nthat 24 cents, it is purely a function of the amount of\nmoney that the caller owes the pay phone operator.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: What difference does that make?\nWhat difference does that make? The use of the phone is\nof a value of 24 cents. But the value of using the phone\nis a value not only to the caller, but to the long\ndistance provider who couldn't provide anything to the\ncaller without the pay phone? Why isn't the alternative\ncharacterization just as easy, regardless of how they get\nto 24 cents?\nMR. FISHER: I think another way to perhaps\ncharacterize your position is, why is this like a\ncommission that they are seeking. And the reason why is\nbecause that number may be very different than 24 cents.\nIf there was such a commission that could exist, it would\nbe far less. And the respondents are not seeking that\namount of money.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Excuse me, but aren't you arguing\nwith the 24 cents, as opposed to creating an argument\nabout what is the proper characterization of the\ntransaction?\nMR. FISHER: I don't think so. All I'm saying is\nif you started with trying to compensate pay phone\noperators for the service they provide -- that you're\ncharacterizing as the service they provide to long\ndistance carriers, you end up with a far different\nnumber. Who knows what you would end up with. Probably\nend up with zero. Because take an example of somebody\nwho rents a cell phone for the weekend. They might make\nlots of long distance calls on the cell phone, but nobody\nhas ever thought that a long distance carrier ought to be\nkicking back money, for example, to the store that rented\nthe cell phone to the customer over the weekend.\nAnd I want to return, I think in Justice Breyer's\nquestion --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: The reason is that the store that\nrents the cell phone is getting rental income from the\ncell phone. And in the case of the pay phone, the pay\nphone operator is going to get zero, unless there is some\nsuch scheme as this.\nMR. FISHER: Right, but then we're back to the\nrental income question, and the question of whether it\nwould be unjust or unreasonable for long distance\nproviders, absent the regulations, to be the ones paying\nthat rental income.\nAnd the answer, we submit, is no. And the problem\nthat I think we've gotten off on a couple times brings us\nback, I think, to the assumption you asked me to make at\nthe beginning of the argument, that something is a\ncovered practice under the Act.\nAnd so another way to understand the distinction\nbetween the accounting rules, the rate making exercises\nand all the rest in this case is that section 201(b) of\nthe Act doesn't cover everything in connection with a\ncommunications service. It only covers certain practices\nin connection. And the history, as well as the text and\nstructure, shows that it regulates common carriers acting\nas such.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It doesn't cover certain\npractices in connection. It covers all practices in\nconnection.\nMR. FISHER: I think we agree with respondent, Mr.\nChief Justice, that in looking at 201(b), you have the\nword such communication practices. And to understand\nwhat that is referring to, you look back up at 201(a) and\nsee the universe. Now, the beginning of 201(a) is what\nwe colloquially call the carrier customer section of the\nAct. And that's the core of 201(b), which says that when\na common carrier is providing service, it needs to act\njustly and reasonably. Here -- and with accounting and\nrate making and all the rest, those are things that\naffect rates and service to customers.\nWhat we have in this case is something very\ndifferent. This is a carrier-carrier relationship. So\nyou need to look somewhere else. And what respondent\nsays is you look to the end of 201(a), which talks about\nphysical interconnections between carriers. But the\nproblem with that argument, and the reason why this falls\noutside 201(b), even if it is somehow unjust and\nunreasonable, is that the carrier-carrier relationships\nare governed only when the FCC has ordered physical\ninterconnection.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you are saying that,\nputting aside 276, it would clearly be impermissible for\nthe FCC to say one way that long distance carriers\nprovide service to their customers is when those\ncustomers use pay phones; and, therefore, we're setting\nup this rate regime in connection with that service. You\nwould say that would be outside the scope of 201(a)?\nMR. FISHER: As we're still talking generically, I\ndon't think it necessarily would be. Because it could\nregulate the relationship between long distance providers\nand their customers. I mean, that's the core of what 201\nis about. It's about how much they can charge, what kind\nof practices they can have in relationship to their\ncustomers. But here we're not talking about a long\ndistance provider that is a common carrier in\nrelationship to its customers or in relation to its rates\nand practices.\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's actually -- that's, I\nthink, your strong -- to me that was the strongest\nargument. When I finished reading it, I thought, well,\nso what. You know, I mean, can you see why I thought\nthat? I mean, today's rule is different. It is true\nthat you don't have simply a single telephone company\nproviding service ultimately directly to the customer.\nYou have everything mixed up. And there are a lot of\ninter-carrier things. Language covers it. Purpose\ncovers it. Facts and circumstances change.\nMR. FISHER: We submit it is a not a \"so what,\"\nJustice Breyer. Because section 201(b) is broad, but\nit's not all-encompassing. And Congress plenty of times\nin section 276, and in lots of other sections of the\nCommunications Act, has responded to modern necessity by\ngiving the FCC expanded jurisdiction, just as it did, as\nI said here, in section 276.\nBut our core position here is that when Congress\nexpands the FCC's authority, and it doesn't create a\nconcomitant Federal right of action along with it, it is\ntelling the FCC to handle these things administratively,\nuse its expertise, craft regulations and enforce them\naccordingly.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Fisher, can I go back to the\nfirst question I asked you? Would the FCC have had\nauthority to create an administrative remedy that had a\nfee shifting provision in it?\nMR. FISHER: The FCC might have that authority.\nSection 154(i), as well as other sections in the Act,\ngive the Commission broad authority in crafting its\nadministrative enforcement regimes. I haven't focused on\nthat exact question, but it might well be able to say\nthat in order to have this properly enforced, we need to\nhave fee shifting.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: It could certainly impose\npenalties of some kind.\nMR. FISHER: Yes, it could, and the FCC could\ndouble fine -- the FCC could do lots of things. That's\nour very purpose, is that the FCC ought to be the single\nforum deciding what kind of an enforcement mechanism is\nbest, not leaving it to Federal courts across the\ncountry. And as Ninth Circuit invites, state court\nrulings across the country with varying rules.\nIf there are no more questions I'll reserve the\nremainder of my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Fisher.\nMr. Englert?\nORAL ARGUMENT OF ROY T. ENGLERT, JR.,\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. ENGLERT: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and\nmay it please the Court:\nIt is not particularly unusual for the grants of\nauthority in the FCC -- to the FCC throughout the\nCommunications Act to be enforceable through the\nprovisions of section 201(b) barring unjust or\nunreasonable charges, classifications, rates, or\npractices.\nJustice Scalia asked a question during Mr.\nFisher's argument about, what about the accounting rules?\nWould they be prescribed under section 201? They would\nbe prescribed under section 220, which is the provision\nof the Act that governs accounting. And they would also\nbe prescribed under the last sentence of section 201,\nwhich is the general authority given to the FCC to\npromulgate all of its rules.\nBut nothing in those facts would keep a violation\nof those rules from being enforced as an unjust or\nunreasonable practice under Section 201(b).\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What can't -- what can't be\nsucked in under section 201? I mean, once the FCC issues\na regulation, it's easy to say that any violation of that\nregulation is unjust. And that's what's happened here.\nAnd this just makes a farce of the provision that says\nthe only private causes of action are for violations of\nthe statute and not for violations of the regulation.\nIt seems to me if this thing, 276, can get sucked\ninto 201 simply by reason of the fact that failing to\nobey an FCC regulation is unjust, that provision is a\nnullity.\nMR. ENGLERT: Well, Your Honor, first of all, the\nFCC has never argued, and we have never argued that all\nFCC regulations are enforceable through a private right\nof action. I mean, to give an example, as --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No, I'm saying you'd have to\nargue that if the theory you're propounding for this case\nis correct. Violation of an FCC regulation is unjust.\nFailing to comply with an FCC regulation is unjust.\nMR. ENGLERT: No, no, Your Honor. The phrase\nunjust or unreasonable is a classic phrase delegating to\nthe administrative agency the authority to make the\ndeterminations in the first instance of what's just and\nreasonable. If, for example, there were a violation of\nthe regulation forbidding giving credits to political\ncandidates, the FCC could decide in the first instance\nwhether the violation of that regulation rises to the\norder of unjust or unreasonable.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So can -- every FCC regulation\ncan be enforceable by private action? All the FCC has to\nsay is that violation of this regulation is unjust.\nMR. ENGLERT: No, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No?\nMR. ENGLERT: There are also examples of things\nthat fall outside of charges, classification, rates or\npractices. There are examples in the case law. There\nare old ICC cases in which providing a particular type of\nboxcar was deemed not to be a charge, classification,\nrate -- held not to be a charge, classification, rate or\npractice.\nThere is a recent D.C. Circuit case involving an\nattempt to dictate, in the FERC context, to an energy\ncompany who can be on its board of directors.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But at least -- at least any FCC\nregulations relating to charges, practices -- and you\nwant to interpret practices very broadly --\nclassifications, and regulations for and in connection\nwith communication service, all of those regulations can\nbe sued upon in Federal court with all the diverse and\ncontradictory rulings that that will produce, so long as\nthe FCC says that the failure to obey this regulation is,\nin our view, unjust.\nMR. ENGLERT: Well, Your Honor, let's start with\nstatutory text. Section 206 says that there is a damages\naction for anything in this Act declared to be unlawful.\nSection 201(b) says unjust or unreasonable\nclassifications, practices, et cetera, are declared to be\nunlawful. So we have a very precise match in statutory\ntext between 201(b) and 206.\nNow, what Mr. Fisher's argument amounts to is to\nsay that if it is covered in a regulation, it is exempted\nfrom being called an unjust or unreasonable charge,\nclassification, practice, et cetera, because that would\nallow the FCC to enforce too much. But if we start with\nthe text Congress enacted, there is a precise match\nbetween 201(b) and 206.\nAnd to say that that which the FCC hasn't\nregulated is more subject to judicial review --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't think he's saying that.\nI don't think he's saying that if it is covered under\nregulation, it can't be unjust. Some regulations do\nrelate to justness and reasonableness, but not 276.\nI think what he's saying is 276 established a scheme.\nIt didn't have to be this scheme. It could have been\nsome other scheme. Nothing in the nature of things says\nthat the long distance carrier has to be the one liable\nfor this.\nIt rather was simply imposed by the FCC. That's\nfine. But to say that it would be unjust for them not to\ndo that is just unreal, unless you're going to allow any\nviolation of any FCC regulation to be unjust.\nMR. ENGLERT: Your Honor, our position doesn't\nrequire us to argue that it would have been unjust for\nthe FCC to adopt some other scheme. Our position is that\nonce the scheme is in place, it is unjust to depart from\nthat scheme in the way Global Crossing did, just as once\na scheme of rate regulation is in place, even though\nthere could be many different schemes of rate regulation,\nit may be unjust or unreasonable to charge a higher rate\nthan that.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But the rate regulation is -- is\nestablished in order to determine what reasonableness and\njustness requires. And 276 is something quite different.\nMR. ENGLERT: I respectfully disagree, Your Honor.\n276 is, asks -- was a delegation by Congress to the\nagency to fill in the details of a plan to make sure that\npay phone service providers were fairly compensated, a\nphrase not very different from just and reasonable, for\neach and every completed interstate and intrastate pay\nphone call. They really fit quite nicely together as\nopposed to being in tension with one another.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Is it possible -- I was worried\nsomewhat about, I think, the problem Justice Scalia\nraised, that old regulations become unjust and\nunreasonable. And then I thought, no, but tell me if\nthis is right. That they're going to fall within 201(b)\nonly if a violation is unjust and unreasonable.\nNow, we could say, and moreover, the FCC has to\nfind that a violation of these rates is unjust and\nunreasonable, that is, it has to focus on it, make that\ndetermination. And then, of course, that determination\nhas to be a reasonable interpretation. In other words,\nit can't just call anything unjust and unreasonable --\nMR. ENGLERT: That's right. The usual --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And it has to focus on the fact\nthat their doing so will create this private remedy in\nthe courts.\nMR. ENGLERT: Well, Your Honor --\nJUSTICE BREYER: That that -- if you have that\ntough -- which I haven't seen anywhere, but I mean, if\nyou had that tough a requirement, so they actually have\nto focus on it, it would tend to minimize the problem of\na thousand different actions in ten thousand different\ncourts and a big mess.\nBut I mean, how much is written into those words\nunjust and unreasonable? I'm certain you can't squeeze\nany rate -- it is not the case that any and every\nregulation can be -- fall within.\nMR. ENGLERT: No, that's right. The usual Chevron\nlimitations apply. And in your question, Justice Breyer,\nyou added to the usual Chevron limitations that the FCC\nhas to focus on --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yeah --\nMR. ENGLERT: Well, that's fine. Here the FCC did\nfocus on it and is criticized for having focused on the\nconsequences for judicial action.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but reasonably\ncriticized for it. I would have thought your answer\nwould be unjust or unreasonable has, for generations,\nbeen given a very expansive reading. And you don't need\nto say that the FCC has to do what typically I would have\nthought was a job for a court, which is to determine\nwhether there's a private right of action to bring its\naction within a boilerplate term like unjust or\nunreasonable.\nI would have thought the contact point was what I\nwas talking about with Mr. Fisher earlier, which is\nwhether or not this is such communication service under\n201(a), which is -- which is, again, I suppose, something\nthat the agency gets deference on. But it would seem to\nme, that's where the limitation would come.\nMR. ENGLERT: Mr. Chief Justice, let me address\nthe interplay between 201(b) and 201(a), because Mr.\nFisher has simply misunderstood our position.\nWe cited the second half of section 201(a) not to\nsay it applies of its own force here, but to say that it\ndisproves the contention that the communications services\nreferred to in the phrase such communications service in\n201(b) have to be limited to carrier-customer relations,\nbecause 201(a) isn't limited to carrier-customer\nrelations.\nYes, all 201(a) does of its own force is allow the\nprescribing of through routes and interconnections. But\nthere is no possible way to read 201(b) as limited to\ncarrier-carrier communications in light of the full\nbreadth of practices covered by 201(b). So that's the\nreason to cite 201(a) is simply to disprove Mr. Fisher's\ncontention about the limits on 201(b).\nThe phrase such communications service is actually\nused in 201(a) and in 201(b), and the antecedent in the\nfirst few words of 201(a), the such communications\nservice, is interstate or foreign communication by wire\nor radio. So 201(b) isn't necessarily restricted to\neither carrier-carrier or carrier-customer relations, but\nsuch communication service relates back to all\ncommunication by wire or radio, which is what we have\nhere.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, but wait. Wait.\nWait. It says to furnish such communications service, is\nwhat (a) says. And they don't furnish such\ncommunications service to your client.\nMR. ENGLERT: No, but -- well, that's debatable,\nbut what 201(b) refers to, in any event, is in connection\nwith --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Such communications service.\nMR. ENGLERT: Right.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And I would think that would mean\nsuch communications service that was furnished.\nMR. ENGLERT: Well, they have furnished a\ncommunications service to a customer, not to us, but to a\ncustomer. So again, this is connected with that\ncommunications service. And as the colloquy with Justice\nSouter earlier touched on, the caller pays sooner or\nlater.\nUnder the FCC's regulatory scheme, and in part\nbecause of the prohibition on advanced caller payment in\n226(e)(2), what happens is the long distance carrier gets\nthe money, and they're saying there's no private right of\naction to make them give it back. In other words, the\nworld would look quite different without a regulatory\nscheme, but it would not be a regulatory scheme in which\nthey get all the money they are currently purporting to\nkeep.\nNow, Mr. Chief Justice, you also asked a question\nabout the flash point on whether the FCC was improperly\nor suspiciously commenting on the scope of the private\nright of action as opposed to interpreting a substantive\nprovision. The private right of action provisions are\n206 through 208, the provisions that let the complainant\ngo to either court or the Commission.\nThe FCC said nothing controversial about the scope\nof 206 through 208. The controversy is over the scope of\n201(b), which is a substantive provision. But once you\nhave something brought within the scope of 201(b), after\nthe application of traditional tools of statutory\nconstruction with Chevron deference, the private right of\naction follows automatically under 206 and 207.\nIt is not a matter of the FCC reaching out to say,\nwe are going to create a private right of action. It is\na matter of the FCC construing a substantive term with\nconsequences for a private right of action.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I think that's\nright, but that's also why I guess I don't regard it as\nparticularly helpful that the FCC opines on what the\nconsequences of its determination that something is\nunjust or unreasonable under the statute are, with\nrespect to a private right of action.\nMR. ENGLERT: Well, it may not be particularly\nhelpful, but it is surely not particularly harmful. And\nthey did have a reason --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, except that it is none of\ntheir business.\nMR. ENGLERT: If they were trying to construe --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: We --\nMR. ENGLERT: -- 206 through 208, Your Honor, I\nmight agree. But they construed 201(b) and commented on\nthe consequence. And this is quite important, that it is\ntheir business, because 208 is the provision under which\neach and every one of those Commission proceedings cited\nin the Sprint brief, which Mr. Fisher alluded to, has\nproceeded before the agency. 208, just like 206,\nrequires a violation of the Act, so it is very much their\nbusiness to decide whether these pay phone controversies\nstate violations of the Act. If they don't, the\nCommission has absolutely no power to proceed under 208,\nwhich is the only provision under which any\nadministrative proceeding has ever gone forward.\nThere are some arguments made here that they\nclearly have the authority to proceed administratively\neven if you can't go to court, but Mr. Fisher hasn't\nidentified the source of that authority. And the sources\nidentified in the brief are section 4(i), which has been\nproblematic, and others -- and other sections on which\nthe FCC has never relied on in this setting, and some\nkind of divination of an action within Section 276\nitself.\nThe question was put at one point to Mr. Fisher,\ncould the FCC mandate fee-shifting as part of this\nadministrative remedy it's going to create. Well, if you\nread 276 broadly, it's giving the Commission great powers\nto create administrative remedies, notwithstanding 208,\nwhich was supposed to be the administrative provision,\nthen maybe anything goes. But we're getting awfully far\nfrom the statute that Congress wrote and giving the FCC\nawfully expansive powers to construe 276, while also\ndenying the FCC rather mundane powers to construe rather\nordinary phrases of administrative law, \"unjust or\nunreasonable,\" in 201(b).\nNow, with respect to the question of whether this\nis a practice in connection with a communications\nservice, Mr. Fisher argues strenuously that it is not.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Let me just be sure I understand\nyour argument on 208. You're saying that 208, like the\nearlier provision of the statute, requires a violation of\nthe statute, not just regulations, in order for there to\nbe an administrative remedy.\nMR. ENGLERT: Yes, Justice Stevens, and section\n207 expressly gives the complainant a choice of forums.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: So the same statutory\nrequirement for the remedy that your opponent challenges\nis the one he acknowledges is available.\nMR. ENGLERT: That's correct, and in fact, Global\nCrossing -- Global Crossing went so far as to argue\nbefore the Ninth Circuit that there is no administrative\nremedy, that there's simply nothing to do except get\nfines under sections 502 and 503, and has reversed its\nposition before this Court.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you should be arguing,\nthen, that we should give Chevron deference to the\nCommission's interpretation of Section 208. And once we\ndo that, if 208 governs this thing, then so does 206.\nMR. ENGLERT: I'm happy to make that argument.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I thought you should be.\nMR. ENGLERT: With respect to the question whether\npractices are limited to carrier-customer relations, I've\nalready touched on that by talking about the interplay\nbetween 201(a) and 201(b). But there's another angle of\napproach for that issue, which is that in the Louisiana\nService -- Louisiana Public Service Commission case, this\nCourt was asked to draw the inference, just as it has\nbeen in this Court, from other provisions in the\nCommunications Act, that those phrases always refer to\ncarrier-customer relations.\nAnd the Court said, no, that phrase can also refer\nto depreciation rules, so it's not limited to\ncarrier-customer relations, the inference from other\nprovisions of the Act doesn't flow. And the reason is\nthere are words of limitation when those words, \"charges,\nclassifications, rates or practices\" are used in those\nother sections that make it clear that they apply only to\ntariffed services. You find no such words of limitation\nin 201(a) and 201(b) -- or in 201(b), excuse me.\nNow, there remains the argument that there's a\nmismatch between section 201 and the relevant regulations\nbecause the regulations apply to intrastate as well as\ninterstate calls, and section 201 applies to interstate\nor foreign communications.\nThat argument appears for the very first time in\nmerits briefing in this Court. It wasn't made below. It\nwasn't made in the cert petition. It wasn't made to the\nagency. And that's a problem, because the limits of the\nFCC's ability to regulate jurisdictionally mixed\ncommunications depend on factual determinations, factual\ndeterminations neither the agency nor even the lower\ncourts have ever been given a chance to make.\nBut had this issue been raised in a timely\nfashion, I suggest that it would have been appropriate\nfor the FCC to reach intrastate as well as interstate\ncommunications because long distance -- dial-around calls\nare overwhelmingly long distance, overwhelmingly\ninterstate, and it is difficult to sort out which calls\nare which. In fact, the seven years of rulemaking the\nFCC underwent in this case largely were because of the\ndifficulties of keeping track of particular pay phone\ncalls.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I saw that argument. I\nhave to say I don't understand it. Why is it so\ndifficult? I get a bill every month that easily sorts\nout which are interstate and which are intrastate.\nMR. ENGLERT: Sorting one call from one carrier\nthat has a relationship with you is not difficult, or\nsorting 100 calls from a carrier that has a relationship\nwith you is not difficult.\nBut when you go from a PSP to an inter-exchange\ncarrier to a switch-based reseller, matching up the\ninformation of all three is -- has proven, in practice,\nto be quite difficult. And it's especially difficult in\nan era in which you can't just tell by area codes, for\nexample, whether something is interstate. If I dial 202\nto 202, I may be dialing someone's cell phone out of\nstate.\nNow, the judgment below could be explained\non the alternative ground that a violation of the\nregulations constitutes a violation of section 276.\nBefore I even get to the substantive discussion, let me\nrespond to the absolutely groundless claim that that\nargument has been abandoned. Global Crossing cites a\nbunch of cases involving section 1291 appeals in which\npeople didn't appeal a particular order after final\njudgment, and says that's an abandonment of the claim.\nThat's both correct and irrelevant. This is\na 1292(b) appeal and there is no final judgment on any\nclaim in this case, certainly not on the 276 claim, so my\nclient certainly hasn't abandoned it.\nMy client was also a party to Greene and lost\nGreene and has argued the merits of the section 276\nposition all along. On the merits, section 276 contains\nrights-creating language that creates a concrete monetary\nentitlement, focuses on the party benefitted, and does\nnot have an aggregate focus. Global Closing doesn't even\ntry to defend the Ninth and D.C. Circuits' reasoning that\nthe statute does not contain rights-creating language.\nThat leaves the tricky question whether a\nviolation of the regs can be deemed a violation of the\nAct itself when Congress specified only the right, but\ndidn't specify what fair compensation was, and didn't\nspecify who had to pay the compensation.\nIn that respect, I think Alexander v. Sandoval,\nthough it's been cited against us repeatedly, is actually\nhelpful to our position. That case says it's meaningless\ntalk about a violation of the regs separate from a\nviolation of the Act, and that a Congress that intends an\nAct to be enforced intends the regulations filling out\nthe Act to be enforced.\nI think the theory of Chevron itself is also\nhelpful to our position in this regard, because the point\nof Chevron is that the use of broad language constitutes\nan administrative -- a delegation of authority to the\nadministrative agency, not just to fill in details, but\nto give definitive content to a statute whose direct\ncontent is less than definitive.\nSo it is perfectly appropriate to talk about this\nstatute, section 276, and its rights-creating language as\nordering the FCC not just to create a plan, but ordering\nthe FCC to create a plan that has a particular goal such\nthat violation of that goal can be deemed a violation of\nsection 276 itself.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Englert.\nMr. Feldman?\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES A. FELDMAN\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,\nAS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING RESPONDENT\nMR. FELDMAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please\nthe Court:\nThere is no dispute in this case that under\nsections 206 through 208 of the Communications Act, a\nparty damaged by any violation of the Communications Act\nmay bring an action either in Federal court or before the\nCommission to obtain damages. The scope of the remedies\nbefore the Commission under the kind of standard primary\nprovision of the Act that deals with damages, 208, and\n207 mentions it as well, the scope of the action before\nthe Commission and before the court is exactly the same.\nNow, because petitioner's -- therefore, if --\nwell, because petitioner's failure to pay fair\ncompensation to respondent was an unjust or unreasonable\npractice --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Let me just ask this. Is it the\nsame with respect to fee-shifting?\nMR. FELDMAN: No. The Act in 207 -- I believe\nit's 207 -- specifically says that you may, the court may\naward attorneys' fees in an action in court. It doesn't\nprovide that -- there's no similar provision for actions\nbefore the Commission. But the scope of the kind of\nthing that Congress decided that a complainant could\nbring either to the Commission or to court is exactly the\nsame. There's no way to drive a wedge between them.\nThere are other provisions of the Act, as Mr.\nFisher said, where Congress specifically authorized the\nCommission -- an action before the Commission for\ndamages. But those are -- those provisions which\nMr. Fisher cited are in section 226, which do not have to\ndo with common carriers. They have to do with automatic\ndialing, with do-not-call lists, with things like that,\nwhere the person who's violating it is definitely not the\n-- never going to be a common carrier.\nIn those provisions, Congress found it necessary\nto say, okay, we have to now give you the authority to\ncreate a damage action.\nBut in other provisions, where you are dealing\nwith common carrier, 206 through 208 provides Congress's\ndetermination of what the scope of a damage action should\nbe either before the Commission or before a court.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you have a position on\nwhether or not Chevron deference is owed to the\nCommission's determination of whether or not their action\ncreates or gives rise to a right of action?\nMR. FELDMAN: I think that --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: There are two different,\nit seems to me, two different Chevron questions. The one\nis the deference on its interpretation of what's unjust\nand unreasonable. The other is the question of whether\nor not they have anything to say about whether that means\nthere is a private right of action in court.\nMR. FELDMAN: I think that -- I guess we don't\nhave a position on whether 276, independent of 201, would\nbe sufficient to have a prior right of action under 206\nthrough 208. But as for 201(b), once -- the FCC does\ncertainly gets deference, has gotten deference for a\nhundred years for its determination of what is an unjust\nand unreasonable practice.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But it's never gotten\ndeference, at least I guess from this Court, on whether\nor not there is or is not a right -- whether there is a\nright of action to enforce its regulations.\nMR. FELDMAN: No, and I don't think the FCC here\nis claiming that there's a right of action to enforce its\nregulations.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, but they're certainly\nentitled to deference as to whether an administrative\naction can be brought under 208.\nMR. FELDMAN: That's correct, and that's why under\n--\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Once you say that it can, then a\ncourt action can be brought under 206.\nMR. FELDMAN: That's correct. That's correct.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So you think we don't owe them\ndeference for 206, but we do for 208. And if you give\ndeference for 208, 206 automatically decides itself.\nMR. FELDMAN: Right. But 208, like 206 -- maybe\nI'm not understanding the question. Both provisions\naddress only violations of the statute.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes.\nMR. FELDMAN: So in order for the FCC to decide\nthat there's an action either before the agency or the\ncourt, it has to identify a violation of the statute.\nHere it's identified 201(b) as being the provision that's\nviolated. It's absolutely standard for a hundred years\nthat -- I mean, Mr. Fisher says, well, you can't look at\n201(b) and decide who is supposed to pay and how much\nthey're supposed to pay. That is absolutely standard\nfrom the very beginning of the Interstate Commerce Act,\nthat you can't look at the words \"just and reasonable\"\nand decide whether a rate was just and reasonable or the\npractices that a carrier is using are just and\nreasonable. In fact, the whole --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Is your position -- I want to be\nsure I understand you. Your position on the two\ndifferent questions that the Chief asked you is, they get\ndeference on question one. And with respect to question\ntwo, it follows from the plain text of the statute.\nMR. FELDMAN: That's correct, that's correct. I\nwould add also, with respect to the Commission's\ndetermination about what is just and reasonable, it was\nnot just a question of saying that a violation of the\nregulations is just and reasonable. The Commission was\ncharged here with the responsibility for adopting a\ncompensation scheme that would provide for fair\ncompensation for each pay phone operator for each and\nevery call. And it spent a number of years and a number\nof different attempts working out what is a fair\ncompensation.\nI would submit that all of that reasoning about\nwhat is a fair compensation scheme is also reasoning why\nit's unjust and unreasonable for a carrier not to pay the\ncompensation. It's not just simply a question of an ipse\ndixit, it's a question of years of rulemaking and working\nout what the scheme should be, so it's fair.\nOnce it did that, it didn't require a lot of\nexplanation for why a failure to pay fair compensation\nthat had been worked out over this period of time, a\nfailure to pay that was unjust and unreasonable.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Are you making the point that\nChief Judge Ginsburg made in the D.C. Circuit that it is\nnecessarily unjust and unreasonable to refuse to pay a\ncharge that is fair and reasonable?\nMR. FELDMAN: Yes. I'm really expanding on that\npoint, that it didn't -- the FCC has always gotten\ndeference for what -- determining what is unjust and\nunreasonable under the Act. And it didn't require a\ngreat deal of explanation. The FCC's explanation here\nwas more than adequate in light of its years of\nexplanation about why this -- this scheme with these\nrates and these carriers and the primary economic\nbeneficiary being the one who pays. All of that were\nreasons why this was fair compensation.\nOnce it decided all of that, it didn't take much\nto say that a failure to pay fair compensation is unjust\nand unreasonable. That was adequately explained and\ndidn't require a huge additional amount of explanation.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: What -- sorry, go ahead.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you would have a\ndifferent position here if 276 said something like, we\nthink there ought to be more pay phones; in order to\npromote investment in pay phones, we're going to have\nthis scheme. In other words, it has nothing to do with\nwhether it's fair or not, it's a subsidy. Then you'd say\nthat could be something that's not covered by the \"just\nand reasonable\" provision?\nMR. FELDMAN: I think in that case also, I would\nprobably be here arguing that maybe if the FCC had\ndetermined that it's necessary, for whatever regulations\nthey came up with under that scheme, in order for the Act\nto function correctly, that they have to be complied\nwith. I think I would also argue that that was unjust\nand unreasonable.\nBut this case, if the question is, did the\nFCC adequately explain what it did here, I think that all\nof the years of explanation of why something is fair are\nalso reasons why it was unjust and unreasonable not to\npay the compensation.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Are there regulations, FCC\nregulations, the violation of which would not be unfair\nand unreasonable?\nMR. FELDMAN: I think there probably are. Mr.\nEnglert mentioned a couple. I mean, there's probably\nnumerous ones that wouldn't be. And in fact, the\nquestion about most FCC action, or at least a lot of FCC\naction, regulations, adjudications, and so on, most of\nthem have to do with carriers' obligations, and most of\nthem are things that have to do with what's unjust and\nunreasonable under the Act. And they've been enforced\nfor years, in the -- you know, from the very early cases\nunder the Interstate Commerce Act.\nMr. Fisher also suggested that there's a\ndifficulty with numerous district courts deciding these\nissues as opposed to the FCC. Well, I would suggest that\nCongress decided that these kinds of actions can go\neither to district court or to the FCC. And in fact, by\nmaking damages actions, the scope of damages actions, as\nopposed to other remedies, co-extensive, did anticipate\nthat there would be that result. The primary\njurisdiction --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Depending upon how broadly you\nthink Congress intends regulations to be sucked into the\nterms of this statute. I mean, your interpretation means\nSandoval really didn't say a heck of a lot.\nMR. FELDMAN: I don't think that that's correct.\nIt means that in the context of a statute that gives the\nagency authority -- that prohibits unjust and\nunreasonable action, which was not the case in\nSandoval --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yeah, but you could say any\nviolation of a regulation is unjust.\nMR. FELDMAN: No. I think it is possible that the\nFCC could determine that any violation of a regulation is\nunjust, and the FCC is entitled to deference for its\ndeterminations about what is unjust and unreasonable,\nthat's been --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So Sandoval doesn't mean a heck\nof a lot. All the FCC has to say is, we think violation\nof this regulation is unjust.\nMR. FELDMAN: No. I think the FCC's determination\nhas to be reasonable under the ordinary types of Chevron\nstandards. But, in fact, when you look at questions of\nwhat's just and unreasonable over the years, it is -- it\nhas always been the case that the agency entrusted with\ndetermining that and getting the communications system\nworking or getting common carrier systems -- common\ncarriers to fulfill their obligations, does have a lot of\nleeway in determining what is unjust and unreasonable in\nthat context.\nThank you.\nTHE COURT: Thank you, Mr. Feldman.\nMr. Fisher, you have three minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L. FISHER\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. FISHER: Thank you. Let me begin, Mr. Chief\nJustice, with your question about whether the FCC can\nopine on remedies. All you need to do is look to what\nthe FCC was telling everybody it was deciding in these\norder proceedings. It was deciding, and asked for notice\nand comment, on whether PSPs have a remedy for violations\nof the pay phone regulations. That is cited everywhere\nin the briefs. It never asked for notice and comments,\nor considered whether failure to pay under the\nregulations is a violation of 201(b).\nSo the question this Court needs to ask itself is\nwhen the FCC, by its own acknowledgment, until now, is\nsimply opining on the presence of a Federal court remedy,\nwhether it gets deference simply because it hangs the\nhook on a substantive provision of the statute.\nNow, there are three problems with what the FCC\nhas done in construing section 201. The first is that\nthis is not a covered practice, because I want to make\nclear our position, it's that the FCC has plenty of\nauthority with respect to carrier-customer relationships,\nbut not with respect to carrier-supplier relationships.\nAnd that's what we have here.\nOn unjust and unreasonable, I think we need to\nunpack two separate questions. One is whether the rate\nthe FCC chose is reasonable, whether the amount of money\nthat it said needs to be put into pay phone operators'\npockets is a fair and reasonable choice. We have no\ndispute about that. And we think that in and of itself\ncould generate deference.\nBut the FCC's determination to put the payment\nobligation on long distance carriers simply can't be\nshoehorned into the unjust and unreasonable phrase in\n201(b), because if that's -- the only reason why\nanything, us failing to pay the money, would be because\nof the regulations.\nAnd you hear it again and again in their argument,\nthe FCC having concluded that long distance companies are\nthe ones that pay, the failure to pay is unjust and\nunreasonable. There's no way to get there without the\nregulations, and that's what distinguishes --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's not true. You can\nsay that this is a way you make a lot of money from your\ncustomers that you wouldn't otherwise make, because if\nthere wasn't a pay phone there, they wouldn't be able to\nuse your service.\nMR. FISHER: The FCC might have said that, but as\nI said to Justice Souter, that would be a very different\nproceeding and a very different scheme than we have here,\nand a very different dollar figure or cent figure that\nthe FCC might have come up with when it was trying to\nencapsulate that figure, which we think is zero, but\nunder your reasoning may be something very small. But\nthat would be a very different case.\nTwo more things. One is, on the jurisdictional\nmismatch question, Mr. Chief Justice, you are exactly\nright. It is not hard -- there are plenty of hard things\nin this case, but figuring out whether a call is\ninterstate or intrastate is not one of them.\nAll you need to know is where the call originated from,\nand the number that was dialed, and pay phone operators\nhave that information.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What about the cell phone\nexample?\nMR. FISHER: This is a pay phone case. So all you\nneed to know is the cell phone number and\nthat --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But you don't know, the\ncell phone holder may be right next to the pay phone or\nhe may be across the country.\nMR. FISHER: I think it still constitutes a long\ndistance call, depending on where the cell phone owner\nlives. And that's still an easy thing to figure out,\nwhere the area code is.\nFinally, Justice Stevens, you asked a question\nabout the co-extensive nature of the remedies under 206\nand 208. We don't dispute that the statute itself is\nco-extensive. What we're saying is that 276 gives the\nFCC more than ample authority to do what it's doing.\nNobody has denied that, and so we think that that's the\nplace to look for the FCC to craft the arrangement under\nSouthwestern Cable. Combined with section 154(i), the\nFCC would have ample authority to do that.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Fisher.\n"
