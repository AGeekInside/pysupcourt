COLEMAN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. COLEMAN: Good morning, Mr. Chief\nJustice, and may it please the Court:\nRacial classifications are inherently\npernicious and, if not checked, lead as they did in New\nHaven to regrettable and socially destructive racial\npolitics.\nNeither equal protection nor Title VII\njustified New Haven's race-based scuttling of the\npromotions Petitioners earned through the civil service\nprocess mandated by Connecticut law. The lower court\nrequired no strong evidentiary basis that the City was\nacting to remedy or avoid any actual discrimination, but\nstrong safeguards are needed to smoke out illegitimate\nuses of race and to extinguish the racial favoritism\nthat civil service laws -- excuse me -- are intended to\nprevent.\nGovernmental employment actions grounded in\nrace must be strictly scrutinized because they engender\ndivisiveness and cause race-grounded harm that the\nConstitution seeks to avert. That standard does not\nchange with the race of those the government seeks to --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I just ask this\nquestion? Is it undisputed that it was a race-based\ndecision?\nMR. COLEMAN: No, Justice Stevens. I think\nthe city makes the argument that it was not a race-based\ndecision simply because the effect of the scuttling\nresulted in no promotions being given at all. We\nbelieve that that is not a basis for distinguishing\nthis. That it still remains a race-based decision.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Are you contending that\nthat's an issue of fact that has to be tried out or that\nwe should accept your version of that -- of that issue?\nMR. COLEMAN: I believe that that's an issue\nof law, Your Honor. It is no different ultimately than\nwhat the Court concluded in Croson. This type of an\nargument that a do-over is not a racial classification\nis exactly what happened in Croson. There was a do-over\ndeclared, a -- a rebidding; and yet the Court said,\nbecause that rebidding was declared for racial reasons,\nit would nevertheless be subjected to --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: That was pursuant to --\nto an affirmative action plan, and here we're dealing\nwith this concept under Title VII of disparate impact.\nAnd let's take for one example a test that's given by a\npolice department, a fire department, and it -- it's a\nphysical fitness test, and it disproportionately\nexcludes female applicants. And when the results come\nin and there are no women on the eligibility list, the\ndepartment reconsiders. It thinks there is something\nwrong with this test. It can probably test for the\nnecessary skills in a way that will not achieve those\nresults.\nWould it be similarly impermissible,\nsimilarly based on an impermissible criterion, if the\ndepartment said: We're not going to -- we have got the\nresults of that test. We're going to throw it out and\nsubstitute another that will not have those skewed\nresults.\nMR. COLEMAN: If that decision was grounded\nin a determination that we simply need to ensure that\nthere are more women on the force, then, yes, it would\nbe subjected to heightened scrutiny, maybe not strict\nscrutiny under that --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Not more women on the\nforce, but this test that we're giving has the effect of\nexcluding most women, just as the high school diploma\nhad the effect, a disproportionate effect, on one race.\nMR. COLEMAN: I think your question gets to\npart of the heart of this case, and that is, ultimately:\nIs the decision that's being made one that is -- is\nbased in race or is -- is based on a determination that\nthere is an improper test? But this decision is\ngrounded in race if -- if the police department in your\ncase had clear evidence that the test was simply\nunnecessary, that it was not job-related and could be\nclearly done by an identifiable alternative, I think at\nthe end of the day there might be some basis. But if it\nis grounded in --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So they would have to go\n-- I take it from what you said they would have to go as\nfar as proving a Title VII disparate impact case against\nthemselves. They couldn't do anything short of that to\nprevail when it is the majority race that is complaining\nabout discrimination.\nMR. COLEMAN: To use the constitutional\nanalogy, Your Honor, I think Wygant, Croson, Adarand,\nother cases, make clear that you do not have to prove\nthe violation against yourself, but you do have to\ndemonstrate that you have a strong basis in evidence for\nbelieving you are violating the law. In Wygant the\nplurality set that out citing convincing evidence.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: The problem, Mr. Coleman,\nis that -- that the cases you are relying on, it seems\nto me, are cases in which ultimately what is being\njudged is a different result in the -- at the end point\nof the process which was starting. And the problem that\nI have with -- with using cases like that and -- and\nessentially the problem I -- I have with your argument\nis that it leaves a -- a municipality or a governmental\nbody like New Haven in a -- in a damned if you do,\ndamned if you don't situation. Because on -- on the\nvery assumptions that you are making, if they go forward\nwith -- with their -- their hiring plan, they certify\nthe results and go forward with it, they are inevitably\nfacing a disparate impact lawsuit.\nIf they stop and say, wait a minute, we're\nstarting down the road toward a disparate impact lawsuit\nand, indeed, there may be something wrong here, they are\ninevitably facing a disparate treatment suit. And\nwhatever Congress wanted to attain, it couldn't have\nwanted to attain that kind of a situation.\nWhy isn't the most reasonable reading of\nthis set of facts a reading which is consistent with\ngiving the city an opportunity, assuming good faith, to\nstart again? And I -- I recognize there's got to be a\ngood faith condition, and the -- the good faith can\nalways be attacked. But isn't that the only way to\navoid the damned if you do, damned if you don't\nsituation?\nMR. COLEMAN: No, I completely disagree with\nthat, Justice Souter. It not simply a matter of good\nfaith. The use of race in government is so -- the Court\nhas been so --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But you make no distinction\nbetween race as an animating discriminating object on\nthe one hand and race consciousness on the other. There\nis no way to deal with a situation like this any more\nthan there is a way to deal with -- with setting lines\nin voting districts --\nMR. COLEMAN: I also --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- without pervasive race\nconsciousness. That is not unconstitutional, and it\nseems to me that you are not observing that distinction\nin -- in your reply.\nMR. COLEMAN: I disagree with that as well,\nJustice Souter. There is a strong difference in what\nhappened in this case. In partial answer to Justice\nGinsburg's question, et al., this is not an issue where\nthe -- where the city had before it and was making a\ndetermination that our examination is not job related.\nIn fact, it is clear on the record that what the city\nsaid is, this comes to the wrong racial result, and,\ntherefore, there must be something wrong with the test.\nWhen pressed --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, let me ask you this\n-- this question, and I don't mean to interrupt your\nanswer, but it is based on what Justice Souter and\nJustice Ginsburg have both been asking. Hypothetical\ncase: The city says, our test is not very good. We\nneed a new test.\nThe expert says, don't pay us to have a new\none. There are two great ones out there. One is in\nCity A. The other is in City B. Use either one of\nthose. They are great.\nThey check. They find out that City A has a\ndisparate impact in the statistical sense, not in the\nlegal sense; that it disadvantages minorities, at least\nif you look at the passage rates. The other test\ndoesn't. Are they permitted to take the test that\ndoesn't have that differential?\nMR. COLEMAN: Under our alternative\nargument, Your Honor, assuming that -- that fixing\ndisparate impact can be a compelling interest, we\nbelieve that you would at least have to demonstrate a\nstrong basis in evidence to show that there is liability\nunder (k)(2) -- your -- your example --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: My -- my question is --\nand you can answer, I guess, both under Title VII and --\nand under the Fourteenth Amendment. The city says, the\nonly reason -- the only reason for our selecting the\ntest from City B -- and both tests are very good tests\n-- is because minorities are better represented on the\npassing rate. Is that permissible?\nMR. COLEMAN: Under the Armstrong basis of\nevidence test, it might very well be because it meets\nthe second qualification of the disparate impact\nstatute, in which there is a specific alternative that\nis equally valid. If you are -- if you are going to\nassume that it can be shown to be equally valid and that\nit has less disparate impact --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And do you find -- and do\nyou find any constitutional deficiency in the city's\nchoice in that hypothetical case? Is there any\nFourteenth Amendment problem?\nMR. COLEMAN: Well, we are certainly quite\ntroubled that the Court would say, as it has not said,\nthat the idea of -- of overcoming purely unintentional\ndiscrimination can be a compelling interest for cutting\noff what we believe is intentional discrimination. But\nbarring that, our test, our backup test, is then that\nthe strong basis in evidence test that exists from\nWygant and Croson would at least in its -- require that\nyou have a strong basis in evidence for demonstrating\nliability under this --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, what -- what if\nyou've got -- what if you've got the basis of Justice\nKennedy's hypothetical? You've -- you've got a\nmunicipality. It's a racially mixed municipality. It's\ngot two tests. That's his hypothetical. One of them\nseems to suggest that there is going to be a significant\nracial disparity in the results if they use it. The\nother one from the other city or the other State\nsuggests not. That's all they've got to go on.\nIs that a strong basis in evidence, or did\nthey walk their way into a lawsuit by you if they adopt\nthe -- the test that doesn't -- that at least in the\nother place hasn't produced the disparity?\nMR. COLEMAN: Under that argument, as long\nas it can be demonstrated to be equally content valid,\nequally or better content valid and to have a lesser\nimpact, then it would show -- it would establish a\nstronger --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: They would not have\ndiscriminated against any particular --\nMR. COLEMAN: That's -- that's correct, Your\nHonor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- white or -- or majority\napplicants in -- in that selection, which is what\noccurred here. You had -- you had some applicants who\nwere winners, and their -- their promotion was -- was\nset aside. That doesn't exist in these hypotheticals at\nall. It's just an abstract question of which of these\ntwo systems should be adopted.\nMR. COLEMAN: Well, I understood Justice\nKennedy's hypothetical to be after you have taken a test\nand building upon the hypothetical.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: It wasn't my --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: No. No. It was --\nMR. COLEMAN: It was --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: It was designed to show,\nand maybe it's theoretical, but I want to know the\nanswer so that I can understand this case. It's\ndesigned to ask you the question whether or not race\nconsciousness is ever permissible.\nMR. COLEMAN: If -- if in your situation is\nsimply in your situation the initial giving of the test,\ncan you choose between those two tests, then we believe\nbased upon what the Court has said in the past that a\ncity could do that.\nJUSTICE BREYER: A city can in fact choose a\ntest simply because there will be more minority people\nwho will in fact end up in the positions, that's your\nview?\nMR. COLEMAN: Well --\nJUSTICE BREYER: You needn't do anything\nelse? I mean, that is your answer to Justice Kennedy?\nMR. COLEMAN: Nobody can know in fact --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I want to know is that your\nanswer to Justice Kennedy or not?\nMR. COLEMAN: Under that hypothetical, we\nbelieve they can choose that test.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Are you assuming --\nJUSTICE BREYER: The answer is yes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Are you --\nJUSTICE BREYER: If that's so, what's the\ndifference here? The most that you're saying is the\nworst that could have happened here; the worst that\ncould have happened is that some experts told them, this\ntest -- by the way, test one is -- is even worse than in\nJustice Kennedy's hypothetical. It's a test that\nprobably discriminates negatively against minorities.\nSo if you admit he could do it even if the test didn't\ndiscriminate negatively against minorities, namely\ntest -- in his case, why can't you do it triply, in the\ncase where there's evidence that they did discriminate,\nthe test does discriminate against minorities?\nMR. COLEMAN: Two very strong differences,\nJustice Breyer. First of all, our -- our firefighters\nhad already taken the test; they had earned their\npromotions under state law. There was nothing left to\ndo but to ministerially certify the lists, all right?\nThe second difference is this. The only --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, that can't be right\nif they -- if what you just answered to Justice Kennedy\nis -- is right.\nSuppose they had very strong evidence that\nthe test that they had given that had these results,\njust as my physical fitness test that excluded all\nwomen -- that had it those results, it wasn't\njob-related, and there was a better test available, they\nwouldn't have any vested right in getting the promotions\nunder those circumstances, would they?\nMR. COLEMAN: We're not claiming that it's a\nvested right. What we're claiming is that sometimes the\nCourt has permitted governments to use race to remedy\ndiscrimination, and what would be needed in that\nhypothetical, Your Honor, is -- is the discrimination;\nand under your hypothetical there might very well be a\nstrong case of discrimination, but under these facts\nthere is no evidence in this record, and the city\nconceded below and never asserted in its bio in this\ncase that it had any basis to contest the\njob-relatedness of this examination or these\nexaminations that were given. That is not part of the\nrecord in this case. The --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What -- one of the briefs\nsaid that, and maybe it wasn't done below, but one of\nthe briefs said part of the claim is that some of the\nthings that this test tested for were not -- were not\nqualities or abilities that were needed in New Haven,\nalthough they might be needed in other fire departments.\nThe test had not been localized. Wasn't that part of\nthe -- part of the objection?\nMR. COLEMAN: No, Your Honor, not in the\ndistrict court. If you look at 1024a of the Pet. App.,\nthe city's lawyer in front of the district court and in\nits pleadings on summary judgment very clearly states\nthat they didn't believe the job relatedness is even\nrelevant to the case. All that they needed was good\nfaith. They didn't need job relatedness, they didn't\nneed an actual alternative, which is the basis of some\nof the hypotheticals you're giving. All they need is\ngood faith.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Then why did they have\nthe testimony before the Civil Service Board, about --\nsomebody from another testing company said this is a\nmultiple choice test; it tests rote memory; we could\nhave come up with a test that would better test the\nskills needed to be -- nothing about the localization,\nbut something about command presence. There was a term\nused, assessment centers; that this test didn't\neffectively test the skills that you needed on the job,\nand others did.\nMR. COLEMAN: Justice Ginsburg, that's not\nat all what Mr. Hornick said in front of the Civil\nService Board. What he said is first, I didn't look at\nthe test; two, I looked at the results and I see\ndisparate impact; three, I'm not going to tell you what\nexams we gave, but I'm mentioning this thing called an\nassessment center, but I could design a better test, not\nhaving even looked at this test.\nBut at the end of the day he also said, I\nthink you should go ahead and give these promotions and\nin the future maybe you could fix your test. He didn't\nsay here's an alternative; here's why this would be\nequally valid, here's why -- excuse me -- here's why\nthis would have lesser impact. He simply said there is\na concept called an assessment center, and I think that\nthat might help you in the future, but you should go\nahead and give the promotions on this test. Same --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, some time\nago you said you had two answers to Justice Breyer's\nquestion. I would like to hear the second one.\nMR. COLEMAN: Well, I actually think I got\nto the -- the first.\nJUSTICE BREYER: If you got to that, then I\nhave -- I'd like one follow-up, and that's it.\n(Laughter.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Maybe if you don't\nmind, you could remind me what the second answer was.\nMR. COLEMAN: Again -- again, getting to the\n-- the fundamental point is, the use of race is so, so\nvery important that the Court has always expressed\nskepticism and hostility to it, and what we're saying\nunder this argument regarding a strong basis in\nevidence, and I think this answers both your\nhypothetical and Justice Souter's, is that what the city\nis saying, we don't have to demonstrate a strong basis\nin evidence for liability, we concede that we don't have\nthat; all we have is good faith. And that's not enough.\nThat leads --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But you are -- as I\nunderstand it, you are imposing your strong basis in\nevidence test on what you referred to a second ago as\nthe use of race, and that cannot be correct, because the\nuse of race includes race-conscious decisions which are\nnot discriminatory decisions, and they certainly do not\nimplicate the -- the obligation that you want to impose.\nYou -- if -- if your argument is going to be\ncoherent with what we start with, it can't be based\nmerely on the use of race because if it does, then you\nare, in effect, turning any race-conscious decision into\na discrimination decision, and that equation we\ncertainly haven't made and we're never going to make.\nMR. COLEMAN: That's not our intention,\nJustice Souter.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Then --\nMR. COLEMAN: Our argument is clearly that\nthis is not race-conscious, that it is race-based. The\nonly determination that the city made is we don't like\nthe results of this test; there must be something\ndifferent that we can do; and we don't need to\ndemonstrate --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But even --\nMR. COLEMAN: -- viability or strong basis\nin evidence. We can simply fix it.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I don't want to turn this\ninto just a rhetoric exercise, but I think the rhetoric\nis important. You say the city took the position, we\ndon't like the results of this test. That kind of a\nstatement is consistent with saying, look, we don't like\nthe race of the people who are going to benefit from\nthis. It's also consistent with the city's taking the\nposition that there is such a racial disparity here that\nwe are either asking for trouble or walking blindly or\nperhaps foolishly into a -- a racial disparity lawsuit\nbased on disparate impact.\nThose are two very, very different\nattitudes. The first one is discriminatory. I don't\nsee how the second one is discriminatory.\nMR. COLEMAN: But it -- it clearly is,\nJustice Souter. I think the distinction we're making in\npart is this principle of individual dignity that the\nCourt has recognized is so strong distinguishes the\nhypothetical that Justice Kennedy gave me from -- form\nthe example that we have in this case where they had\nalready taken the test; identifiable individuals had\nearned their promotions; and then the city says too many\nnon-minorities passed this test, and we are going to\nscuttle these results based on identifiable individuals\nwho have passed and not based on any -- anything\napproaching a demonstration that there is actually any\ndisparate impact liability.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But the cost of drawing the\ndistinction between this case and Justice Kennedy's\nhypothetical example is that if we draw that\ndistinction, the only way the city can get itself out of\nnot only a certain lawsuit, but quite probably a\nsuccessful lawsuit, is to make, in practical terms, a\npreliminary case against itself.\nMR. COLEMAN: I --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And it -- I cannot conceive\nthat Congress intended to put a city into that situation\nsaying you've either got to blunder ahead into a losing\nlawsuit in court, or you have got to stop and expose\nyourself to another lawsuit which you can only win by\nproving that you at least had taken some steps in\nviolating the law the first time. That is\ninconceivable.\nMR. COLEMAN: Justice Souter, I understand\nthe concern about the employer's point of view, which we\ndon't think stands here just because of the blatant way\nthe City went about this. But in general terms we're\nnot asking, contrary to Wygant, contrary to Croson, that\nyou prove up a claim against yourself.\nBut what we are saying is that the standard\ncannot be so light that the City very lightly and\nwithout any demonstration whatsoever that there might\nactually be liability here, based simply on the numbers,\ncan say well, we're going to avoid liability and we're\ngoing to favor the minority group over the non-minority\ngroup.\nAll we're asking for is that the City\nundertake an honest and -- and open assessment of are we\nreally likely to be liable here under the disparate\nimpact provision of Title VII.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What do you do if there is\nnot a liability in question? Suppose a school district\ndeliberately, to obtain greater racial diversities in\nthe schools draws district boundaries in a particular\nway among neighborhoods or plans a construction program.\nThen suppose having done that, indeed having once drawn\nthe boundaries, a group comes to the school district and\nsays you can achieve greater diversity if you redraw the\nboundary. You can achieve greater diversity if instead\nof building this school where the -- where the\nfoundations are laid already, you build the school over\nhere instead.\nIs that, in your view, different from your\ncase?\nMR. COLEMAN: I think --\nJUSTICE BREYER: It is? How?\nMR. COLEMAN: I think it is. I think you're\ngiving examples from Justice Kennedy's --\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's just what I'm doing\nexactly.\nMR. COLEMAN: It's -- it's really isn't\ndifferent from Justice Thomas also had an example in\nGrutter. These are --\nJUSTICE BREYER: But I'm interested in the\ndistinctions, not whether it's similar to Justice\nThomas's or not. I'm interested in the distinctions\nbetween this program -- I'll add one more if you want\njust this program, an employer --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Can I hear his answer to\nthis one first? I'm getting confused.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. COLEMAN: I think the Court is certainly\nnot fully in agreement on these questions, but the Court\nhas at least an opinion suggested that those types of\nexamples really are more of -- as Justice Souter, you\nwere saying, the race-conscious type determination, and\nthey don't violate this principle of individual dignity.\nYou're not taking individuals one by one who have\nalready earned promotions, and you're taking away\nbenefits from them clearly on the --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And the difference between\nthat and drawing the school district boundary, which\ntakes from the individual children who live in that\nneighborhood the right to go to this school, which they\nthink is a better one, and sends them to that school,\nwhich they think is a worse one, the difference between\nchanging that boundary and changing the exam is what?\nMR. COLEMAN: The difference that the Court,\nI believe, has suggested is that that type of a\nredrawing is likely to include a number of traditional\nredistricting factors and that race in that instance,\nunless it was shown to ultimately predominate, would not\nmake it a race -- or, excuse me, a race-based effort\nthat would violate equal protection. I believe\nthat's --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask you one\nquestion --\nMR. COLEMAN: Of course.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- because I'm not sure I\nunderstood your answer to Justice Kennedy?\nWhat is your answer to Justice Kennedy's\nquestion about the two alternatives, one of which would\nfit exactly into the concluding clause of the first\nquestion presented to achieve racial proportionality in\ncandidates selected? He says there are two alternatives\nbefore the school board, one would achieve the\nproportionality, the other would not. Are they free to\nchoose the former?\nMR. COLEMAN: Again, assuming that no test\nhas previously been given, if there are two tests, they\nare equally valid, one can be demonstrated to have\nlesser disparate impact, if there are no other\ncircumstances, then we think they could likely under\nthat test --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: They could take that test,\neven though its sole purpose was to achieve racial\nproportionality in candidates selected?\nMR. COLEMAN: I disagree that its sole\npurpose would be for that reason, Justice Stevens. As\nlong as it meets the other criteria for job relatedness,\nit would still be fulfilling the City's necessary needs\nfor -- for identifying quality candidates for making\nsure --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: This is the -- putting to\none side liability in the lawsuit, is the interest in\navoiding disparate impact a valid State interest?\nMR. COLEMAN: We certainly have taken the\nposition if disparate impact is identified purely as\nunintentional discrimination, then we don't believe it's\na compelling State interest to overcome --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I didn't say compelling.\nI said is it a valid State interest. Just the interest\nin avoiding the kind of results you got here.\nMR. COLEMAN: I'm not sure that we are\nquestioning whether there's a State interest in --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: The City is not merely\ntrying to avoid liability, they are trying to avoid a\ndisparate impact. Is that a valid interest?\nMR. COLEMAN: If the disparate impact is\ncaused by something that could be demonstrated to equate\nto discrimination on behalf of the entity, which is what\nthe elements of --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But I thought the whole\nidea of disparate impact is it's unintentional, that's\nthe assumption, disparate treatment, intentional\ndiscrimination, disparate impact, unintentional, but it\nhas askewed racial results.\nMR. COLEMAN: There are two aspects to that,\nJustice Ginsburg. The first is that you may have\ndisparate impact if it is caused by unintentional\ndiscrimination. But you may have disparate impact that\noccurs through no discrimination, intended or otherwise.\nAnd Watson clearly recognized that. And when Watson\nsaid we need to have strong evidentiary standards in\nevaluating disparate impact liability, it was\nrecognizing that employers can't act simply to fix\nnumerical disparities, because otherwise that leads to\nsoft quotas.\nWhat we need is some demonstration that\nthere is at least discrimination on behalf of the\nentity, and perhaps that's unintentional, perhaps it's\nnot.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: How do we know whether\nsomething is discriminatory or just that it will have a\ncertain effect? Because it's in spite of. For example,\nthe Greek standard, the employer wants everybody to have\na high school diploma, he wants an upgraded working\nstaff, was told by this Court you can't do that because\nyou would disproportionately exclude one race.\nMR. COLEMAN: Congress has spoken on this\nissue, has identified job relatedness and lack -- and\nthe refusal of an alternative in K itself. We believe\nthis is with the provisions we have cited, H, J and L,\nall in which Congress expressed a strong intent to favor\ntests.\nIf I may reserve the balance of my time,\nYour Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.\nColeman.\nMr. Kneedler.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,\nAS AMICUS CURIAE,\nSUPPORTING VACATUR AND REMAND\nMR. KNEEDLER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThis Court has long recognized that Title\nVII prohibits not only intentional discrimination but\nacts that are discriminatory in their operation.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: With respect to both\nblacks and whites, correct?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Yes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, can you assure\nme that the government's position would be the same if\nthis test -- black applicants -- firefighters scored\nhighest on this test in disproportionate numbers, and\nthe City said we don't like that result, we think there\nshould be more whites on the fire department, and so\nwe're going to throw the test out? The government of\nUnited States would adopt the same position?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Yes, and let me -- your\nquestion had two parts of it. You said there are too\nmany blacks or too many whites. That is not a\npermissible objective under our view. The employer's\naction has to be tied to a concern about a violation of\nthe disparate impact of --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yeah.\nMR. KNEEDLER: -- under -- under Title VII.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's the part I\ndon't understand. What you're saying is that the\ndepartment can engage in intentional discrimination to\navoid concern that they will be sued under disparate\nimpact. Why doesn't it work the other way around as\nwell? Why don't they say, well, we've got to tolerate\nthe disparate impact because otherwise, if we took steps\nto avoid it, we would be sued for intentional\ndiscrimination? This idea that there is this great\ndilemma -- I mean, it cuts both ways.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, to -- to say that an\nemployer violates the disparate treatment provision of\nTitle VII when it seeks to -- when it acts for the\npurpose of complying with the disparate impact\nprovisions of Title VII would be to set those two\nmutually reinforcing provisions of Title VII at war with\none another, contrary to --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: They are at war with one\nanother.\nMR. KNEEDLER: No, I don't think so.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: How can one avoid --\nMR. KNEEDLER: One of the purposes of -- of\nthe disparate impact test, as this Court has recognized,\nis -- is as a prophylactic against intentional\ndiscrimination, to root it out; also, as this Court said\nin Watson, to identify possible instances of subjective\nor -- excuse me, subconscious discrimination, and in\nsome cases, to break down barriers that have existed in\nthe past, for example, possibly the 60/40 weighting\nrequirement that was under longstanding collective\nbargaining agreement.\nThe disparate impact test has been\nrecognized since Griggs as fundamental to fulfilling the\npurposes of Title VII.\nTitle VII also has another important\nobjective, as this Court has repeatedly recognized,\nwhich is that the voluntary compliance is the preferred\nobjective -- excuse me -- preferred means of achieving\nthe objectives of Title VII. Employers therefore\nrequire considerable flexibility in assessing their\npractices and deciding on appropriate action if it looks\nlike one of their actions -- their practices would\nviolate --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: If it looks like or if the\nemployer just in good faith believes?\nMR. KNEEDLER: We think -- we think --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: When I say they're at war\nwith one another, I mean they become at war with one\nanother when you say that all that is necessary to\npermit intentional discrimination is the employer's good\nfaith belief that if he didn't intentionally\ndiscriminate, he'd be caught in a situation of disparate\nimpact.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, this --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: At that point, they're at\nwar with each other.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, in -- in our view, the\n-- in -- in the situation here where the -- where the\ntest has been given, and there is a list produced, we\nbelieve that the -- in order to avoid summary judgment\nand a disparate treatment case on a claim of intentional\ndiscrimination, the employer would have to show that his\nconcerns were reasonable ones. It has to be --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: How does that --\nMR. KNEEDLER: -- more than simply a\ndisparate --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I know you said that in\nyour brief when you made a distinction between mere good\nfaith and reasonable belief. So how does one determine\nwhether the concern that the employer is expressing is\nreally in good faith or is reasonable? What are the\nindicia of reasonableness?\nMR. KNEEDLER: I -- for example, a -- a\ngross statistical disparity. A statistical disparity\nmakes out a prima facie case under Title VII. We're not\nsaying that in all cases simply a statistical disparity\nwould be sufficient. A gross statistical disparity\ncould lead the -- the employer to believe that something\nwas wrong with the test. So I think -- but in addition\nif the employer has concerns about the validity of the\ntest -- as you pointed out, concerns were expressed to\nthe Civil Service Board in this case.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Mr. Kneedler, could you\nexplain how summary judgment in favor of the defendants\non the Title VII disparate treatment claim can possibly\nbe affirmed, even if the employer had reason to believe\nthat the test that was given would expose itself to\nliability under a disparate impact theory? If that's\nnot the employer's real reason for refusing to go ahead\nwith the promotions, then isn't there liability under a\ndisparate treatment -- under a disparate treatment\ntheory, and that's a question for the jury? So how can\nwe possibly affirm summary judgment here?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, we're -- we're not\nsuggesting that the Court should affirm summary\njudgment. We're -- we're suggesting remand. The\nDistrict Court identified reasons other than complying\nwith Title VII's disparate impact standard for the\nemployer's action here, diversity and role model,\npromotion of role models which we do not see as falling\nwithin this framework. But if the only evidence that\nthe plaintiff has that the employer took race into\naccount was that the employer was aware, as obviously\nthe disparate impact provisions require him to be, of\nthe racially disparate impact of the test, and the\nemployer acts in response to that, if that is the only\nevidence the -- the plaintiffs had, then the employer\nwould be entitled to summary judgment. We think that\nthe evidence --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I'm sorry.\nMR. KNEEDLER: We think that evidence of\npretext or evidence that there is something else has to\nbe external or something other than --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Can you be --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And a reasonable response\nto that, is your position?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Yes --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Not just in response to\nthat.\nMR. KNEELDER: If it's --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: A reasonable --\nMR. KNEEDLER: If it's not reasonable, then\nwe think that that would be evidence of -- of pretext --\nand --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Can you be specific about\nwhat facts you think should be tried on remand? Because\nyou do distance yourself from the Respondents. You are\nnot urging affirmance of the summary judgment. You say\nthere are or may be genuine issues of fact. So what are\nthey?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, I think they go\nprimarily to the district court's identification of\ndiversity and -- and role models as possible motivations\nfor what the -- what the employer was doing. The\nplaintiffs have also alleged that the -- that there was\ninfluence on the Civil Service Board external to the --\nto the board's own decision. By the way, I should point\nout in this regard, at pages 166 and 167 of the Joint\nAppendix, the two board members who voted not to certify\nexpressed concerns about the validity of the test based\non what they had heard at the hearing.\nWe don't think realistically a board in this\nsituation should be required to do more, because it's\nimportant to recognize that the -- what the employer did\nhere was not what concerned the Court in Wygant and\ncases like this. The Court -- the employer did not\nadopt racial classifications with all the potential for\nadverse consequences for individuals who are labeled by\nrace and promote on the basis of race. That's not what\nthe employer did here. The employer paused and decided\nthat there might be another nondiscriminatory or less\ndiscriminatory means. In other words --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, counsel, you know,\nI've given law school examinations, looked at them, and\nbar examinations for years. There's never been one,\nwhen I don't look at it after the fact and say, you\nknow, this could be better, this -- this was not quite\nright.\nSo shouldn't there be some standard that\nthere has to be a significant, a strong showing after\nthe test has been taken that it's deficient? Before it\ncan be set aside?\nMR. KNEEDLER: We -- we don't think so, and\nfor several reasons. First of all, the action that the\nemployer has taken in response, as I just said, is not a\nracial classification response. It is a facially\nneutral response where the -- where the employer has\ndecided the test will -- perhaps we'll look for another\nstandard which would be given and applied equally to all\napplicants.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And you would say that --\nand I'm asking the same question the Chief Justice asked\nearlier -- you would say that if it had come out the\nother way --\nMR. KNEEDLER: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And if there had been a\ndisproportionate number of minorities who -- who passed\nthe test --\nMR. KNEEDLER: And --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You would say that it's\nneutral to set that test aside?\nMR. KNEEDLER: And we -- and we --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't think you'd say\nthat.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, we -- there also has to\nbe some concern that the test may not be job-related and\n-- and that there may not be other alternatives. And\nwe've been talking just about the prima facie case, but\nthose are important elements as to whether the test is\njob-related.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's whether it is -- it is\nneutral to set aside a test simply because one race\npredominates.\nMR. KNEEDLER: No, but the -- but the --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: How you can call that\nrace-neutral I -- I do not know.\nMR. KNEEDLER: It's facially neutral. I\nwanted to make the point that this is not the sort of\nintentional discrimination favoring one individual\nbecause of his race or disfavoring another. What the\nemployer has done here is -- is responded to the impact\nof the test in general terms, not on specific --\nJUSTICE BREYER: What do you think of an\nemployer who does the following? He advertises a job.\nEveryone comes in and applies. He says May 1 is the\ndeadline. When he sees the applicants, he thinks, I'd\nprefer more diversity. And solely because he lacks\ndiversity among women, minorities, and whatever, he\nsays, you know, I'm going to extend the deadline 2\nmonths, and I hope I'll get a few more minority or\nfemale applicants.\nNow, what's his reason? He wants more\ndiversity in the workforce. Now, in your opinion, does\nthe Constitution permit that extension?\nMR. KNEEDLER: I -- I think that's a more\ndifficult question, but there may -- there may be a\nsituation where the employer is concerned that his\nrecruitment or his job announcement has had a disparate\nimpact in terms of the -- of the applications that he\nhas gotten. In -- in that situation, the employees who\nhave responded and may be advantaged, like the people\npromoted here may actually be taking advantage of a test\nthat imposes barriers and disadvantages other people.\nSo when -- when we consider the impact in a\nsituation like this on somebody who has passed the\npromotion test, it's important to consider that the\npeople who have passed it may have benefited from a test\nthat is discriminatory.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, this may be\nthe same question Justice Breyer asked, but I'd like\nsomething closer to a yes or no answer. Does the\ngovernment consider promotion of diversity by itself a\ncompelling state interest in the employment context as\nopposed to the school context?\nMR. KNEEDLER: We think -- we think it\nprobably is a compelling state interest, but it is not\none that -- that can be advanced by race -- by racial\nclassifications. And that -- and that is our basic\nsubmission here. This was not a --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Can it be --\nMR. KNEEDLER: This was not a --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Can it be advanced\nby taking actions to avoid what is perceived as a\ndisparate impact?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Yes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: In other words, the\ndisparate impact is regarded as something you can\nintentionally respond to by drawing racial distinctions\nsolely because you would like a more diverse workforce?\nMR. KNEEDLER: No, not drawing racial\ndistinctions. That's our -- this -- the employer's\nresponse here did not draw racial distinctions. It did\nnot say so many black firefighters would be promoted --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It didn't care --\nMR. KNEEDLER: -- and so many white --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It didn't care -- it\nhad to draw racial distinctions because it looked at the\ntest and said, we think there's a problem because of the\nracial makeup of who's going to get the promotions.\nMR. KNEEDLER: The employer was responding\nto the discriminatory test or what -- what it was\nreasonably concerned was a discriminatory test --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But it looked at the --\nMR. KNEEDLER: -- not the individual --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Counsel, it looked at the\nresults, and it classified the successful and\nunsuccessful applicants by race.\nMR. KNEEDLER: It -- it --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And then -- and you want\nus to say this isn't race? I have -- I have trouble\nwith this argument.\nMR. KNEEDLER: No, with respect, it did not\nclassify according to race; it looked in general terms.\nIt did not have the names of individual people. It\nlooked in general terms at what the racial disparity of\nthe test was. It just --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It didn't look at\nnames; it just looked at the label of what their race\nwas. That's all they were concerned about.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Title VII's disparate impact\ntest requires -- requires an employer to be aware of and\nrespond --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But that's inconsistent\nwith your answer to the Chief Justice who was exploring\nwhether or not what we have here is a -- is a racial\ncriteria, pure and simple, and you say, well, it's\ngeneral. And then we point out that each applicant\ndidn't have his name, but they had his or her race.\nMR. KNEEDLER: But the employer -- the\nemployer was not making a decision to go forward and\nappoint individuals or promote individuals because of\ntheir race. The employer stopped there and said we're\ngoing to start over. That new test would be given\nequally to all employees, not any one particular\nemployee.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Kneedler, can I ask\nyou this? You -- you've recommended that we set aside\nthe summary judgment and send the case back for a\nhearing.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Yes.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: What is the issue of fact\nthat you think needs to be decided?\nMR. KNEEDLER: As I've mentioned to Justice\nGinsburg, I think it would go -- there are several\nthings. One, it would go to the justifications that\nwere advanced by, that identified by the district court\nhere that do not fit into this framework, do not fit\ninto complying with the Title VII disparate impact test,\nand those are promotion of diversity and -- and role\nmodels.\nThat is -- that is one. Also the district\ncourt did not apply what we believe is the right test,\nwhether the employer had a reasonable basis for\nbelieving that what it was doing was necessary or a\nreasonable basis to believe it might be violating the\ndisparate impact test. If it did not have a reasonable\nbasis then we believe there would be a triable issue for\nthe jury.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: When -- when I asked that\nyou question, you said that one issue of fact was\nwhether the board was acting in response to improper\ninfluence, to racial politics.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Yes. That -- the district\ncourt rejected that argument and whether or not that\nshould be revisited on remand is -- is another matter.\nWe're --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Isn't that a controverted\nissue of fact? How can you possibly get around that?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, one side says what\nyou say is just pretext; the real reason was just\npolitics. Isn't that an issue of fact that has to be\ntried?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, under this -- under\nthis Court's decisions dealing -- dealing with summary\njudgment, even on questions of intent, the -- the\nplaintiff ordinarily has to come up with some\naffirmative evidence that there was -- that there was in\nthis case an impermissible racial motive to do that.\nAnd the -- the district court looked at what the civil\nservice commissioners said and concluded that -- that\nthey did not have an impermissible racial motive, that\nthey were responding to concerns about the validity of\n-- of the test.\nJUSTICE ALITO: But does the government\nthink that you can just -- in a case like this you can\njust look at what -- what is said by the ultimate\ndecision-maker and ignore the input from other people\nwho may have influenced the process?\nMR. KNEEDLER: No, no, we do not. There may\nbe other people who had input into the process, and\nwhether the -- the district court evaluated that and\nconcluded that the -- that the input, that there was not\na triable issue for summary judgment -- to avoid summary\njudgment on that question. That would be open to the\ndistrict court to reconsider on remand. We don't deny\nthat -- that it could go beyond that, but our principal\nconcern here is the analytical framework that an\nemployer who seeks to comply with the disparate impact\nrequirements of Title VII which have been longstanding\nshould not be teamed to have engaged in the sort of\nintentional discrimination that either the Equal\nProtection Clause or Title VII prohibits.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Meade.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF CHRISTOPHER J. MEADE\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. MEADE: Mr. Chief Justice, and maybe it\nplease the Court:\nEmployers, both private and public, are\nrequired to comply with Title VII's disparate impact\nprovisions, which seek to root out barriers to equal\nopportunity. When an employer learns that a practice\nhas a severe adverse impact such that it creates an\ninference of discrimination, and evidence further\nsupports that inference, the employer should be granted\nsome limited degree of flexibility to act. An employer\ncertainly should not be encouraged or forced to make a\npromotion on the basis of the questionable practice.\nTitle VII's disparate impact provisions are\ndesigned to remove structural barriers to\ndiscrimination, and when an employment practice has an\nadverse impact such that it substantiates an inference\nof discrimination, an employer should look beyond that\nadverse impact.\nJUSTICE ALITO: If all the employer --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Can I ask you --\nJUSTICE ALITO: If all the employer has is\nevidence that the test results violate the four-fifths\nrule, is that sufficient?\nMR. MEADE: In our view it is not\nsufficient, and that is not what was at issue here.\nFirst of all, there was a severe adverse impact, much\nlower than the four-fifths rule, much lower than what\nthis Court found in Connecticut v Teal, and in addition,\nnot just on the pass/fail ratio --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, if I could modify the\nquestion. Is there some statistical point at which\nthat's sufficient, if it's not four-fifths, if it's\nnine-tenths --\nMR. MEADE: Our view --\nJUSTICE ALITO: -- that alone would be\nsufficient?\nMR. MEADE: Our view is that it might be\nconceivable under Title VII in some cases for the\nstatistical disparity to be so severe such that it would\ngive an employer a reasonable basis under Title VII.\nHowever, that's not what we argue here.\nWe argue here that an employer should be\nable to act when it has a severe adverse impact which\ncreates an inference of discrimination, coupled with\nevidence that creates doubts about the flaws in the test\nor the possibility of alternatives.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Can I ask you to\ntouch on the distinction between racial discrimination\nand race-conscious action? The actions that were taken\nin many of our cases, in Croson and Adarand, Parents\nInvolved, Wygant, were obviously race-conscious actions;\nthere was a reason that the governments in those cases\nwere taking the action. It was because of what they saw\nas the impact on race. Yet we concluded that was racial\ndiscrimination. So what's the -- how do you draw the\nline between race-conscious that's permitted and racial\ndiscrimination that's not?\nMR. MEADE: Well, two answers, Mr. Chief\nJustice. First of all, this race consciousness is race\nconsciousness that's mandated by Federal law. This is\nnot a discretionary decision by an employer.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but if we --\nif we agree with your -- I mean, you're assuming, it\nseems to me in your argument, that the actions that\nthey've taken here are not intentional racial\ndiscrimination; and of course if they're not, then you\ndon't have much to worry about. But let's assume that\nthey are, as we found they were in Croson and Wygant and\nAdarand and Parents Involved.\nMR. MEADE: Well, the difference in those\ncases that you talk about, Croson, Adarand, Parents\nInvolved, they involve express racial quotas -- excuse\nme, express racial classifications, where the government\nis making a decision based on a particular individual on\nthe basis of race.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And the only reason\nyou say that isn't by an individual is that you have\nblacked out the names?\nMR. MEADE: No, because it's a facially\nneutral action which applies to all test takers the\nsame. That doesn't mean --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So your position is\nwhat? They threw out the test, so you would have no\nproblem at all if they looked at those results and they\nwere predominantly black rather than white; you would\nsay the city can throw out the test and there's no\nracial discrimination there at all?\nMR. MEADE: No, I would say that there's no\nclassification. However, there's another way to trigger\nstrict scrutiny and that comes under cases like\nArlington Heights and Feeney, and the action that the --\nthe facially neutral action that the city took here\nfalls under that line of cases. And then --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't see how you can\ncall it facially neutral. It's neutral because you\nthrow it out for the losers as well as for the winners?\nThat's neutrality?\nMR. MEADE: There is no classification,\nbecause each individual, and -- when a particular\nindividual is looked at and a decision is made on the\nbasis of race, that is a racial classification. If --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So this case would\ncome out differently, if the list was there with then\nnames and they go down and instead of saying throw out\nthe test, they said Jones, you don't get the promotion\nbecause you're white; Johnson, you don't get it because\nyou're white. And they go down the list and throw out\neverybody who took the test; then that would be all\nright?\nMR. MEADE: Well, the point is, if all the\ntests are being thrown out and different decisions are\nnot being made on the basis of different individuals on\nthe basis of race, then --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So they can keep --\nthey get do-overs until it comes out right? Or throw\nout this test; they do another test; oh, it's just as\nbad, throw that one out; get another one that's a little\nbetter, but not so -- throw that one out?\nMR. MEADE: Well, two responses. The first\nresponse is a legal one, the second one is a practical\none. As to the legal answer, if a city were to do that\nor an employer were to do that again and again, first of\nall, that would go to intent, whether the intent of the\nemployer were actually to comply with Title VII or for\nsome other intent.\nSecond of all, it would speak to whether\nthere are actually equally valid less discriminatory\nalternatives. Second, the practical --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well if -- how many\ntimes before it's a problem?\nMR. MEADE: Well --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You say if they did\nit over and over again. What if they did it twice here?\nMR. MEADE: Well, that would be a question\nabout whether they had a reasonable basis to do it. And\nI would say if they did it a second time, that could\ncreate an inference of discrimination.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What -- what has New\nHaven done in fact? This certification was requested in\nMarch of 2004; we're now 2009. What has New Haven done\nin order to get lieutenants and captains in the fire\ndepartment?\nMR. MEADE: Justice Ginsburg, this is\ninformation outside the record, of course. The -- the\ncity has held tests for other positions, both written\nand oral, in assessment centers that have not had a\nsevere disparate impact -- actually, that have not had\nan adverse impact at all under the four-fifths rule.\nAnd specifically for the lieutenants and\ncaptains, what the city has been forced to do is have\ntemporary acting promotions on a rotating basis based on\nseniority. But the city has not gone forward with any\npromotions yet, and, in fact, the Petitioners in this\ncase may in the end receive some or all of the\npromotions. But the city has a duty to make sure that\nits process is fair for all applicants, both black and\nwhite.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I have purposely gone, of\ncourse, to the concurring opinion because I believe it's\nthe controlling opinion in Parents Involved, and there\nare two examples in that opinion. One is strategic site\nselection of new schools, i.e., a planned building, and\nthe second is drawing attendance zones with a general\nrecognition of the demographics. Those are given as\nexamples of instances where there is race consciousness,\nbut it does not trigger strict scrutiny.\nNow, why is your case like that rather than\nbeing like those examples where an employer or a\ngovernment official picks particular people or uses\nquotas in order to get a certain quota or pay attention\nto race in an individual selection, both based on race,\nwhich clearly does require strict scrutiny? And if\nthere is a difference, even then why is yours justified?\nMR. MEADE: Justice Breyer, there are two\nways to enter strict scrutiny. One is a racial\nclassification which makes different decisions based on\ndifferent individuals on the basis of race. Cases like\nCroson or Wygant or even affirmative action plans are\nexamples of making different distinctions based on\ndifferent individuals on the basis of race.\nThere is another line of cases about --\nwhere there's a discriminatory purpose plus adverse\nimpact on a certain group under the Arlington Heights\nline of cases.\nHere the Petitioners argue that there is an\nadverse impact on them. Of course, that depends on the\nassumption that there was, in fact, a valid test. But\nhere, then, under that line of cases the question is:\nWhat is the discriminatory purpose? And this Court's\ncases are not clear about what a discriminatory purpose\nis under the Arlington Heights line of cases. However,\nthe answer to your question is: Compliance with a\nFederal statute, even a race conscious Federal statute,\ncannot be deemed a discriminatory purpose under the\nArlington -- Arlington Heights inquiry. It is very\ndifferent.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is that -- I am\nsorry. Is that correct if we -- we conclude strict\nscrutiny does apply under the Constitution? Compliance\nwith a statute, looking at impact, is a compelling\ninterest trumping strict scrutiny under the Equal\nProtection Clause?\nMR. MEADE: No, Your Honor. If strict\nscrutiny applies, then the question is: Is there a\ncompelling interest? And complying -- complying with a\nFederal statute needs to be a compelling interest under\nthe Equal Protection Clause. The reason is, otherwise,\nState and local governments would be in an impossible\nposition of trying to determine whether they should --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I guess it would go\nto how you construe the statute. It seems to me an odd\nargument to say that you can violate the Constitution\nbecause you have to comply with the statute.\nMR. MEADE: Well -- well, I would disagree.\nThat would only be true if there were some doubt as to\nthe constitutionality of the disparate impact\nprovisions. But here that -- this Court first\narticulated \"disparate impact.\" Congress has reaffirmed\nthat.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well -- well, but you are\nloading the -- the equation. The Chief Justice's\nquestion I don't think has been -- been fully answered.\nYou are -- you are saying that you can eliminate\nconstitutional concerns because the statute is enacted,\nwhich just repeats those same constitutional concerns.\nIt's -- it's like having two tracks on the audio that\ndon't quite fit.\nMR. MEADE: Well, I -- I may have\nmisunderstood the question, but compliance with Federal\nstatutes have to be a compelling interest as long as\nthat -- that statute is constitutional. Now --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Of course you're not saying\nthat -- that the test is -- is compliance. You're --\nyou're saying the belief that it's necessary for\ncompliance is a compelling State interest.\nMR. MEADE: Or --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I mean everybody would\nprobably concede that if -- if continuing would clearly\nbe in violation, of course, it's a compelling interest.\nBut the issue here is: Is it enough if the employer\nsimply worries that if he doesn't make the change, he\nmay be in violation?\nMR. MEADE: Well --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What -- what's the line\nthere?\nMR. MEADE: Well, the line is set out by\nthis Court's cases. So assuming strict scrutiny applies\nand assuming that compliance with Title VII is a\ncompelling interest, then the question is whether an\nemployer has a sufficient basis. And this Court's\ncases, both in the intentional and unintentional\ncontext, say that that's a strong basis in evidence, and\nso that would be the relevant test. This Court has\napplied --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You acknowledge strong\nbasis in evidence is -- is what -- what the city has to\nhave?\nMR. MEADE: Assuming that strict scrutiny\napplies --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Right.\nMR. MEADE: -- then, yes, then the city\nneeds to have a strong basis.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Can I get back just\n-- just -- since I don't understand it yet, the\ndistinction between intentional racial discrimination\nand race conscious action. I thought both the plurality\nand the concurrence in Parents Involved accepted the\nfact that race conscious action such as school siting or\ndrawing district lines is -- is okay, but discriminating\nin particular assignments is not.\nNow, why is this not intentional\ndiscrimination? I understood you to say it was because\nyou don't have particular individuals being treated on\nthe basis of their race. You are going to have to\nexplain that to me again, because there are particular\nindividuals here. They are the plaintiffs, and they say\nthey didn't get their jobs because of intentional racial\naction by the -- the city. Why is that not on the\nracial -- intentionally racial discrimination side\nrather than the permissible race consciousness side?\nMR. MEADE: Well, again, this is a question\nabout what triggers strict scrutiny, and compliance with\nthe Title -- compliance with the Federal statute should\nnot be deemed a -- a discriminatory purpose. However,\nif strict scrutiny applies, then this Court's\ntraditional strict scrutiny analysis is a way to test\nthe decision.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that -- you\nmay be right that that's what the question is about. I\nstill don't have in my mind from you a line about how we\ndecide. Because there are many cases, Croson, Adarand,\nWygant, Parents Involved, where we said action taken\nobviously because of race is nonetheless discrimination.\nSo -- and then there are cases where we have recognized\nthat race conscious action is permissible. Again, what\n-- when I look at something like this, how I do decide\nwhich side of the line that's on -- this is on?\nMR. MEADE: Well, again, all of those other\ncases involved discretionary actions by State actors,\nand those are -- were making decisions, trying to\ncomply, trying to further various goals, and in those\ncases making a very express use of race that a\nparticular individual -- when that person was looked at,\nwhether in Croson, whether in Wygant, whether in Parents\nInvolved, a particular decision was made as to that\nindividual.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But just to take\nParents Involved, it wasn't a necessary -- the driving\nfactor was not a specific decision with respect to\nspecific individuals. They didn't care whether it was\nJones or Smith that they were citing. All they cared\nabout was the race. And it seems the -- the same here.\nYou maybe don't care whether it's Jones or Smith who is\nnot getting the promotion. All you care about is who is\ngetting the promotion. All you care about is his race.\nMR. MEADE: Well, the -- the difference\nthere is that in that case, Jones and Smith, different\ndecisions were being made on the basis of race such that\nthere was a labeling on the basis of race. And here\nthere is no such labeling because here there is a\nquestion about whether this process is in fact picking\nthe most qualified individuals for the job. And that's\nwhat Title VII is designed to do.\nIt is, yes, certainly a race conscious\ndecision, a race conscious statute. But what Title VII\nis trying to do is to make sure that we don't perpetuate\ndiscrimination, albeit unintentional, and, therefore, to\ntake away barriers that have existed over time and that\ncontinue to exist.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: When you say \"take away\nbarriers,\" one thing is not a hundred percent clear.\nYour position is we have to do this in order to avoid\nTitle VII disparate impact liability. Are you not\nreciting as a justification either the diversity in\npolice -- policing firefighting or still overcoming a\nlegacy of the past where fire departments were among the\nmost notorious excluders on the basis of race? You are\nnot -- you are not saying rectification of past\ndiscrimination? You are not saying diversity?\nMR. MEADE: We're not saying that. We did\nnot say that below. And, in fact, the board members who\nvoted against certification cited flaws with the test\nand flaws with the process, and that was the basis for\ntheir failure to certify.\nAnd the problem with a discriminatory test\nis that it does not set a level playing field. It may\ncreate an illusion of meritocracy, but the problem is it\nnot only disfavors certain individuals, but on the flip\nside, it also necessarily advantages others --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You just referred --\nMR. MEADE: -- and therefore --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry. You just\nreferred to a discriminatory test. What you said in the\ndistrict court, and I quote, the issue is not whether\nthe tests were valid.\nAre you just changing positions on that?\nMR. MEADE: No, not at all. The ultimate\nvalidity of the test, our position below, was not\nrelevant; the question is what was before the board.\nAnd the board heard 5 days of testimony over 2 months.\nAnd as I mentioned, the two individuals who voted\nagainst certification cited concerns with the test and\nconcerns with the process, and that was the basis for\ntheir decision.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What do you mean by --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I'd like to talk just\nbriefly --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Justice Kennedy.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I would like to talk just\nbriefly about this point that the -- some of our\nhypotheticals where the test hadn't been given yet.\nHere the test has been given. And I had some concerns\nalong the line of Justice Ginsburg's question. She\nsaid, well, it's not a vested interest.\nOn the other hand, 2000e-(l)(2) says that\ntest results can't be altered. There's a statutory\ninterpretation question of whether that means they can't\nbe used altogether. Two points about the statute.\nNumber one, doesn't that diminish at least\nthe force of the argument that this is a vested\ninterest? It means the tests are -- have a -- have a\ncertain presumption in -- in their favor.\nSecondly, on -- and maybe this is a question\nfor the -- for the Petitioners rather than you. If we\n-- let's assume that we relied on that statute and said\nthat there's a Title VII violation here because the\nstatute was violated. I know you have an\ninterpretational argument there. Would that give the\nPetitioners all the relief they need here, or is there\nstill additional relief under their 1983 cause of\naction?\nMR. MEADE: To answer your first question,\nthe question of statutory interpretation, I would\ndisagree with the suggestion that that gives support to\nthe Petitioners' side, and for the following reason:\nCongress made a careful judgment about what can and\ncan't be done once tests have been administered, and it\ntold employers it -- it can't alter the scores when\nthose scores are being used. And in -- what that --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: It can't alter the\nresults. But let's not get into the statutory\ninterpretation --\nMR. MEADE: But the -- but the point is that\nthat ties the hands of employers so that the employer,\nin fact, is limited in what it can do. Just because a\ntest has been administered doesn't mean that Title VII's\ndisparate impact provisions suddenly disappear. And as\na number of lower courts have stated, there's no\nentitlement to be promoted on the basis of a flawed or\ndiscriminatory test.\nThe problem is, the alternative is to force\nemployers to go forward and to use a discriminatory or a\npotentially discriminatory test. That has two problems.\nFirst, it's inconsistent with the goal of\nmerit-based selection; and second of all, if it turns\nout that there is, in fact, discrimination, a court then\nneeds to undo that discrimination. A court will often\nneed to use racial quotas or set-asides to try to undo\nor to remedy the discrimination that has happened.\nSo it's much better for an employer to stop,\nto not go forward with discrimination, even after the\ntest has been used, rather than to rush forward and to\ncreate potentially further discrimination and a more\naggressive use of race down the road.\nAnother problem with creating a high\nstandard is it will discourage employers from removing\nbarriers to equal opportunity. For example, with\nrespect to an ongoing practice, if an employer learns\nthat that practice has a disparate impact, but is not\nsure one way or another, and gets rid of that provision,\nunder Petitioners' theory that employer will necessarily\nbe liable to either blacks or whites. The only way that\nit can defend against a lawsuit by whites would be to\nargue that it was, in fact, violating the disparate\nimpact rights of black Americans.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What type of -- what\ntype of other things are you talking about there?\nMR. MEADE: I mean, it could -- could be,\nfor example, if there were a five-part training program\nthat the City or an employer set up, and individuals may\nhave completed some portion of the training program such\nthat there would be similar reliance interests like\nthe --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, the question,\nI guess, would be whether the program was valid or not\nunder the traditional approaches you take under Title\nVII.\nMR. MEADE: Exactly. But then the question\nis whether you're forced --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So does your\nposition here depend on a conclusion that this test is\ninvalid?\nMR. MEADE: No, it doesn't. The question is\nwhether the employer had a sufficient basis at the time\nof its action to make a determination that the test\nshould not be used.\nJUSTICE ALITO: And why didn't it have a\nsufficient basis here? It -- it chose the company that\nframed the test, and then as soon as it saw the results,\nit decided it wasn't going to go forward with the\npromotions. The company offered to validate the test.\nThe City refused to pay for that, even though that was\npart of its contract with the company. And all it has\nis this testimony by a competitor, Mr. Hornick, who\nsaid -- who hadn't seen the test, and he said, I could\ndo a better test -- you should make the promotions based\non this, but I could give you -- I could draw up a\nbetter test, and by the way, here's my business card if\nyou want to hire me in the future.\nHow's that a strong basis in the evidence?\nMR. MEADE: Well, first of all, the City did\nnot act on the basis of numbers alone. It had 5 days of\nhearings where it heard from stakeholders on all sides.\nAnd it heard numerous flaws in the test at those\nhearings.\nFor example, there were arbitrary weightings\nof the scores which had no scientific basis; the company\nskipped critical design steps in the process; and\nalthough this was not before the board, it later turned\nout that there was no calibration in either the cut-off\nscore or how the test was ultimately going to be used.\nPrevious tests had a much less severe adverse impact.\nThis test was an outlier.\nJUSTICE ALITO: What difference does the\ncut-off score make?\nMR. MEADE: The difference of a cut-off\nscore is a determination, a scientifically based\ndetermination to determine who is qualified and who is\nnot qualified for --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, I understand that, but\nthe people at the top would -- the problem here was not\nthe composition of the people who scored above the\ncut-off, was it? It was the composition of the -- of\nthe people who would be eligible for promotion under the\n\"rule of three\"?\nMR. MEADE: Well, two responses, Justice\nAlito. First of all, as to the pass-fail rate, that\ncould create a separate disparate impact violation under\nFederal law. So that was relevant for separate\npurposes.\nBut in addition, it's also true that the\ntest was not calibrated for use for rank ordering, to\nensure that a 93 was better than a 91. And this was a\nspecial problem because of an intervening decision by a\ncourt that was -- that was rendered after the tests were\ndesigned, after the tests were taken, after the tests\nwere scored.\nThere was -- there's no evidence that the\ntests were precise enough to be able to determine who --\nwho should rank higher versus lower based on those\nscores. And the amicus brief of the human resources --\nhuman resources professionals points out this point.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So your response to\nme that you don't have to show that the test is invalid,\nyour argument is you just have to show that there's a\nbasis for being worried that it might be invalid. And\nthen it seems to me the only distinction is how high a\nshowing you require. And you reject the idea that you\nhave to show a strong basis in the evidence?\nMR. MEADE: Yes and no --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I thought you just said\nthat. I just thought you just -- I was -- almost wrote\nit down.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I think your phrase was --\nI think --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I understand from --\nI guess I should say I understand from your brief if not\nfrom your argument that --\nMR. MEADE: No, no.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You agree with the\nstrong basis in fact standard?\nMR. MEADE: To answer in a way that's\nconsistent to -- to both of you, the answer is if the\ntest is under Title VII, strong basis should not be the\nstandard. This Court has never indicated that it should\nbe. And that would be much too high of a standard to\nplace on private employers.\nHowever, if this Court concludes that strict\nscrutiny applies, which we think it should not, but if\nthis Court concludes that strict scrutiny does apply,\nthen, yes, we agree --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So I guess, my -- so\nmy -- your position is that you should never have a\nstrong basis in fact standard, because you don't think\nstrict scrutiny should apply, and you think if it's\nunder Title VII, it's only reasonableness?\nMR. MEADE: That's correct.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So your position is\nthat the city -- the -- the government can take action\nwithout -- only if it's reasonable. It's a reasonable\nview of whether or not they might or might not be\nliable. That's the standard. And then they can engage\nin race-based action?\nMR. MEADE: We agree with the government's\narticulation of the standard of reasonable basis.\nAgain, I would --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But does it have to be\nreasonable basis to believe they would be liable if they\nwent ahead? Or can reasonableness refer to something\nother than the probability of or the -- the likelihood\nof liability?\nMR. MEADE: I agree that it could be\nsomething less than that. And if --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, what is\nsomething less than that, that they might be sued?\nMR. MEADE: No, not that they might -- might\nbe sued. Again, this is, just in the Title VII context,\nso this will affect all private employers, some of which\nwill be small employers where a single human resource\nprofessional will be trying to make the determination.\nThere won't be hearings as there were in this case. And\nthe question is sometimes a severe prima facie case\ncould be sufficient under Title VII, not under the\nstrong basis standard, but potentially under Title VII.\nAnd if a human resource professional or if an employer\nhad a belief that further investigation could yield\nevidence of a Title VII violation, that would be\nsufficient under the reasonable basis standard.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Isn't that -- isn't\nthat kind of a blank check to discriminate, if all they\nneed is a reasonable basis to think that further\ninvestigation might be useful?\nMR. MEADE: No, it's not because this is a\nway to reconcile, under Title VII, the two provisions of\nthis statute. However, in this case --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, I'm sorry --\nthat's an answer about why it would be okay. I'm just\nsaying, isn't it in fact a blank check?\nMR. MEADE: Well, I would disagree. No, it\nis not a blank check.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But --\nMR. MEADE: Here, however, we had much more.\nThere was a strong basis in evidence here. This Court,\nunder the strong basis standard, has suggested that a\nstrong basis is met when the threshold conditions for\nliability are met. That's what this Court said in Bush\nv. Vera, a plurality in Bush v. Vera, as well as Abrams\nv. Johnson.\nThe question is how to apply that standard\nto this case. That standard would suggest that a prima\nfacie case, which, again, is not just adverse impact\nalone, but it's adverse impact that creates an inference\nof discrimination could be enough. Here we have not\njust that, not just --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Meade, let me -- let\nme go back to one earlier question. Suppose everybody\nagrees that you're right on the -- on the record here\nnow, and the City goes ahead and does another test, with\nall the advantages and studies they've made and so forth\nand so on, and it turns out you just had an unfortunate\nselection of candidates, and they come out exactly the\nsame way. Would you agree that at that time the City\nwould have to certify the results?\nMR. MEADE: Assuming that it was a test that\nwas valid --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: It's a test they made\nafter talking to everybody who testified in this case\nand filed amicus briefs and everything else --\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And they came out, and it\nturned out exactly the same results.\nMR. MEADE: Absolutely. If the Petitioners\n--\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Absolutely what?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. MEADE: Absolutely yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Absolutely positively?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. MEADE: Absolutely positively.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I still -- I still\ndon't have absolutely yes -- of what?\nMR. MEADE: Yes, because --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes, they can --\nMR. MEADE: Yes, they -- they need to\ncertify the -- the results.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: They would have to certify\nit.\nMR. MEADE: They would have to certify the\nresults. Sorry I was unclear. They would have to\ncertify the -- the results. The question here is\nwhether there is in fact a fair process. It's --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, just to get\nback to your answer to Justice Stevens, you say they'd\nhave to certify it. You say that, in that situation,\nthe decisionmaker could not have a reasonable basis for\nthinking further investigation is required. Why? Just\nbecause the second test came out the same way? It's not\nat all reasonable to think they ought to look at it\nfurther?\nMR. MEADE: Well, not on the basis of -- of\nthe investigation that Justice Stevens, I understood,\nhypothesized, as part of the example.\nJUSTICE ALITO: And that would be so, even\nif another Mr. Hornick showed up and said, I could --\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE ALITO: I could make a better -- I\ncould make a test? And here are some problems with this\nsecond test that you gave?\nMR. MEADE: Again, having gone through all\nthe different examples that Justice Stevens said, at\nthat point then -- then it would be -- the City would\nneed to go forward with the test.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMR. MEADE: Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Coleman, to keep\nthe time even here, I think you have 8 minutes.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY S. COLEMAN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. COLEMAN: There's another statute that\nthe Court ought to consider in the Title VII context,\nand that's section 2000e-7, which says that Title VII\nwill not overrule and pre-empt State law unless there is\na violation of Title VII.\nIn asserting that, under any reasonable\nbasis, as long as they have a reasonable basis, they can\ndispense with all the provisions of Connecticut civil\nservice law, all these provisions that were put in place\nto get rid of cronyism, to get rid of discrimination can\nbe set aside based on nothing more than a numerical\ndisparity or perhaps a concern about the test we think\ncuts against Congress's intent in Title VII in\nrespecting these State and local laws that are intended\nto ensure that employment practices are fair and that\nthey choose and select those who are best qualified to\nput into these very important first-responder\norganizations.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Do you -- I'm still back on\n-- a university decides that tenure requirements lead to\nfewer women professors, so they say as an experiment\nwhat we would like to do is not have them for a couple\nof years; see what happens. On your view is that\nunconstitutional? Because, after all, it will certainly\nmean that certain majority race assistant professors\nhave now lost the promotion they otherwise would have.\nMR. COLEMAN: I think consistent with the\nanswer I gave you before, Justice Breyer, that based on\n--\nJUSTICE BREYER: That it's unconstitutional?\nMR. COLEMAN: Based on that alone --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes.\nMR. COLEMAN: No, it would not be.\nJUSTICE BREYER: It would not be\nunconstitutional?\nMR. COLEMAN: It --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And what about --\nMR. COLEMAN: You're not taking away tenure\nfrom anybody.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. Oh, oh.\nMR. COLEMAN: You're just saying we want to\nchange the tenure process.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But what we are doing is\nnot giving the promotions to the assistant professors\nwho otherwise would have job security.\nMR. COLEMAN: The analogy to your analogy is\nthat if we have a series of people who go through the\ntenure process that exists and it turns out, you know,\nwe -- we don't like the results, and --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Oh, so.\nMR. COLEMAN: -- therefore we want to change\nit.\nJUSTICE BREYER: It's the result -- it's\nthat you identify the person that makes your -- so in\nTexas, for example, they take the top 10 percent of all\nthe high school graduates and put them in the\nuniversity. Now, suppose they just decided, you know\nwhat we want to do? The top 5 percent. We want to see\nhow that works. And, of course, then there are people\nwho in fact would have gotten into the university -- and\nperhaps we can imagine a majority of the majority race\n-- and now they don't. Can Texas do that?\nMR. COLEMAN: Well, you've chosen a very\ncontroversial subject.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I know that, but I -- I --\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: That was not my objective.\nMR. COLEMAN: If --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I want to test out just\nwhat it is about this case.\nMR. COLEMAN: If -- if that is not done on\nthe -- on the basis of race, then, no. The institution\nof the 10 percent rule itself, most people believe --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, you said no. Can\nTexas do that or not?\nMR. COLEMAN: Likely, yes. The answer is --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes.\nMR. COLEMAN: -- it can do it.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay. And the difference\nhere precisely is what?\nMR. COLEMAN: Is that, under State law,\nthese individuals had gone through an existing process\nand had -- under State law, had been determined to be\nthe most qualified candidates and, barring anything\nelse, would have been promoted. So the classification\nthat is made clearly does distinguish between those who\nare qualified for promotion and those who are not\nqualified for promotion and would not receive.\nIt violates that -- that singular principle\nof individual dignity to have these individuals be told,\non the basis of race, you're not --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But if it were shown\nthat, in fact, this test was not job-related and, in\nfact, the majority of fire departments scotched this\ntest years ago and substituted what most agree is a\nbetter test, even so you would say it would violate the\nrights of the plaintiffs you represent, even --\nMR. COLEMAN: If --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Even if there's strong\nevidence that it's not job-related and that there's a\nbetter test that doesn't produce these skewed results?\nMR. COLEMAN: I don't think that's what\nwe've said, Justice Ginsburg. Under our alternative\nformulation in which the Court recognizes --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But what -- what would\nthat do to the civil service merit system that says if\nyou pass the test you should be certified?\nMR. COLEMAN: The difference is this,\nJustice Ginsburg: The example you have given would\nclearly satisfy or likely satisfy a strong basis in\nevidence that you are actually in violation of the\ndisparate impact provision of Title VII. There are\nthree prongs. The first is adverse impact; the second\nis that your test is not related; and the third is the\nexistence of this alternative that is equally valid and\nthat results in lower disparate impact.\nThe City has never asserted -- and I hear it\ntoday continue to say, we don't have to show those other\ntwo prongs, that a numerical disparity enough may allow\nthe City to conclude that there must be something wrong\nwith the test. This kind of res ipsa loquitur theory of\ndisparate impact is one that the courts have not\nrecognized and that Watson said we cannot allow because\nit results in racial balancing and soft quotas based on\ndisparate impact --\nJUSTICE BREYER: But in your -- in my\nexample, to go back, the thing you've identified, it\nseems to me, is Texas couldn't do this. It couldn't\nlook at the class that they're going to choose with the\n10 percent and say, you know, there are not enough\nminorities, I think we'll go to 15 percent this year.\nMR. COLEMAN: That I agree with, Justice\nBreyer.\nJUSTICE BREYER: It could not. And\nmoreover, in the case of the tenure, what the school\ncouldn't do is it couldn't say, looking over at the\npresent tenured faculty and those who were just ready\nfor promotion and who in all probability will be, we're\ngoing to go to the non-tenure system this year. We're\ngoing to go to the non-tenure system this year.\nMR. COLEMAN: I also agree with that.\nJUSTICE BREYER: That they couldn't do that.\nAnd again you that say the ordinary employer across\nAmerica who announces a deadline for getting in\napplications cannot, once it sees those applications,\nsay, you know, there are not enough minorities. I want\nto extend the deadline.\nMR. COLEMAN: That's also correct, Justice\nBreyer.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. And therefore\nthis is a very far-reaching decision.\nMR. COLEMAN: No, not necessarily, Your\nHonor. Okay, what --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: You are -- you are saying,\nas I understand it, that if the -- if the city in a case\nlike this, prior to giving a test, looked at the test\nand says, wait a minute, this is going to produce really\ndisparate results, they can stop, regroup, and think it\nthrough again and maybe come up with a different test.\nMR. COLEMAN: If --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But if they don't realize\nthat and they go ahead with the test, and they then see\nthe -- the disparate results, it's too late. And it\nseems to me that the trouble with drawing that\ndistinction is that the city is not in the testing\nbusiness. They are unlikely to know what the results\nare going to be. So you're saying that the city that is\n-- that is prescient can adjust, the city that doesn't\nfind out there's something wrong or at least undesirable\nfrom their standpoint until after the test results\ncannot readjust?\nMR. COLEMAN: I don't think that's our\nposition, Justice Souter. The first case I think is the\nhypothetical Justice Kennedy posed to me. The second\ncase, as we've been talking about, is that you identify\nthe disparate impact after the test has been given.\nUnder this alternative theory that would allow a -- an\nemployer to respond, all we are asking under the strong\nbasis in evidence test is that you not react out of a\nconcern, or out of this mere reaction to the numbers,\nbut that you then look, is the test valid? Do you have\nconvincing evidence, in the words of Wygant, to form a\nstrong basis in evidence that if you did go forward --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But if they see it coming,\nthey don't have to show a strong basis in evidence for\nchanging the test prior to the time they give it?\nMR. COLEMAN: Consistent with what -- my\nconversation with Justice Breyer, if they see it coming\nand do it ahead of time, it doesn't violate that\nprinciple of individual dignity and that -- and doesn't\ndiscriminate against particularized and identifiable\nindividuals.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
