Ashcroft.\nMr. Lessig.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE LESSIG\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. LESSIG: Mr. Chief Justice, may it please\nthe Court:\nPetitioners are before you this morning\nchallenging Congress's 1998 Sonny Bono Copyright Term\nExtension Act, which extended the term of subsisting and\nfuture copyrights by 20 years. Petitioners submit such a\nblanket extension of existing terms exceeds Congress's\npower under the Copyright Clause and it violates the First\nAmendment.\nNow, the Government has responded to\npetitioners' argument in a way that betrays a simple but\nfundamental confusion. The Government has argued as if\npetitioners had advanced a general theory of the Copyright\nClause, or a general constraint under which Congress must\noperate. That is a mistake. This case is about limits to\nan enumerated power. It's not about general power of\nCongress to exercise its copyright authority. Petitioners\nhave advanced a particular interpretation of the only\nexpress limits in the Copyright Clause designed to give\nthose limits meaning.\nQUESTION: Mr. Lessig, I'll tell you what\nbothers me about your position, and that is that Congress\nhas extended the term so often through the years, and if\nyou are right, don't we run the risk of upsetting previous\nextensions of time? I mean, this seems to be a practice\nthat began with the very first act.\nMR. LESSIG: Justice, we do not believe that the\nvery first act extended terms at all. Speaking\ntechnically, which for a lawyer means speaking accurately,\nthe 1790 act did not extend a Federal term. The 1790 act\ngranted a term for works that already existed in precisely\nthe pattern that the English parliament had done in the\nStatute of Anne in 1710, and that the English parliament\ndid with monopolies, general monopolies in the statute\nof --\nQUESTION: But there have been a number of\nextensions since.\nMR. LESSIG: That's right.\nQUESTION: Even if you can get over the first\nhurdle.\nMR. LESSIG: That's right. That's the important\nhurdle, and we'd like to jump that first, but the other\nones, Justice, you're right, in 1831 and in 1909 Congress\nextended terms in a way that is inconsistent with the\nstrongest form of the test that we have advanced. Those\nextensions, however, were never challenged in any court\nand certainly not considered by this Court.\nQUESTION: Well, doesn't that itself mean\nsomething, Mr. Lessig? The fact that they were never\nchallenged, perhaps most people, and perhaps everybody\nfelt there was no basis for challenging them.\nMR. LESSIG: Well, Mr. Chief Justice, it's\nabsolutely true that this case is here because of a\nfundamentally important changed circumstance that makes\nthe Framers' limitations on the Copyright Clause much more\nsignificant. This is the first time I can remember where\nthis Court has been pointed to changed circumstances as a\nreason to reaffirm the Framers' values, because for most\nof this period, Mr. Chief Justice, the only people who\nwere regulated by copyright law under the Copyright Act\nwould have been commercial publishers, primarily, and now\nfor the first time the scope of this exclusive right has\nexpanded because of the changed technology of the Internet\nto reach an extraordinarily broad range of creativity that\nnever would have been imagined before.\nNow, it's not the case that the earlier\nextensions were not questioned on constitutional grounds.\nIn fact, Melville Nimmer, in the consideration of the 1976\nact, suggested they were plainly under --\nQUESTION: Well, I'm talking about court\nchallenges, not academic challenges.\nMR. LESSIG: That's right, there is no court\nchallenge.\nQUESTION: Mr. Lessig, your theory, as I\nunderstand it, regardless of changed circumstances or not,\nyour basic theory, which on your argument would have been\nappropriate at any time historically, is that there has at\nleast got to be the possibility of a kind of a causal\nconnection between the extension and the promotion or\ninducement for the creation of some subsequent work, but\nwhy is that any more plausible a reading of the Promotion\nClause than simply a reading that says the Promotion\nClause requires that there be a general scheme in place,\nwhich overall tends to promote or induce, and part of one\naspect of that scheme can be that the -- that at the\ndiscretion of Congress the period of protection is\nextended from time to time?\nWhy do you require -- why do you say the clause has\ngot to be read by this kind of specific causation theory\nas opposed to a kind of systemic theory of promotion?\nMR. LESSIG: Justice Souter, the reason is\nexactly related to the point I began with, that this is a\ncase about limits and not about discretion. If it's not\nthe case that this Court --\nQUESTION: No, but that's -- I mean, that's the\nissue in the alternative reading.\nMR. LESSIG: That's right.\nQUESTION: And why is it a limit case, rather\nthan a discretion within a general scheme kind --\nMR. LESSIG: That's right.\nQUESTION: -- of clause?\nMR. LESSIG: Because if this Court does not\nadopt a reading of the form we've offered, then there is\nno limit to the ability of Congress to extend subsisting\nterms.\nQUESTION: Do you say the same thing for scope?\nThis case is about duration, but Congress from time to\ntime -- in fact, you mentioned --\nMR. LESSIG: Yes.\nQUESTION: -- the expanded applications of\ncopyright, and Congress itself extends the scope from time\nto time.\nMR. LESSIG: That's right.\nQUESTION: Would you make, as far as, say,\ntranslation rights that didn't exist before, the same\nargument?\nMR. LESSIG: I --\nQUESTION: Why -- or -- and if you wouldn't, why\nnot?\nMR. LESSIG: I -- no, Justice Ginsburg, we would\nnot, and the reason is again related to the method we have\nadopted to interpret \"limited times.\" We have not said\nthat \"promote the progress of science\" is a general and\nindependent constraint on the Copyright Clause authority.\nWe've said it must be looked to to interpret the scope of\n\"limited times,\" and unless retrospective extensions are\nforbidden, it will eviscerate the meaning of \"limited\ntimes.\" That does not occur in the context of the scope\nof exclusive right, nor in the context of the power to\nsecure. If that's --\nQUESTION: Could we then go back to Justice\nO'Connor's question? To make that very specific, if we\nagree with you, does that mean that we would, in\nprinciple, have to hold the 1976 extension\nunconstitutional? I mean, in 1976, Congress extended the\nterm from 28 years renewable once, to life of the author\nplus 50 years. Now they're extending it life of the\nauthor plus 70. If the latter is unconstitutional on your\ntheory, how could the former not be? And if the former\nis, the chaos that would ensue would be horrendous.\nMR. LESSIG: Justice Breyer, under our theory as\nwe've advanced it, you're right; the 1976 act would be\nunconstitutional. Whether this Court would apply such a\nholding in this case to that act is a question that would\nhave to be resolved under the retrospective --\nQUESTION: Maybe we ought to find another\ntheory, then. Is there any --\n(Laughter.)\nMR. LESSIG: Justice, the theory, which would\nadvance the aim of limiting times in a way that is\nenforceable, is only applicable in the case that we\nbrought before you here to the '98 act, and would not\nnecessarily be applicable under the '76 act for the\nreasons the Government has offered. We would not advance\nthis argument, but the Government has offered an argument\nin a parallel case that suggests a distinction between the\n'76 act and this case. That's not been briefed here.\nIt's been grounded in their claim that the treaty power\ncreates some special power. We wouldn't advance that\nclaim, but the point is there are a number of issues that\nthe '76 act --\nQUESTION: In essence, you think it's at least\narguable that the '76 act had various positive aspects to\nit in terms of the purpose of the Copyright Clause that\nthis act lacks?\nMR. LESSIG: That's certainly true, and we also\nbelieve that, for the reasons averted to by amicus AOL in\nthis case and the reasons you've just suggested, the\ndisruption in that context under the retrospectivity cases\nRyder and Reynoldsville Casket Company would be sufficient\nto fit it within the, quote, \"severe disruption exception\"\nto the retrospectivity.\nQUESTION: Well, I suppose implicit in the\nargument that the '76 act, too, should have been declared\nvoid, and that we might leave it alone because of the\ndisruption, is that for all these years the act has\nimpeded progress in science and the useful arts. I just\ndon't see any empirical evidence for that.\nMR. LESSIG: Justice, we are not making an\nempirical claim at all. Nothing in our Copyright Clause\nclaim hangs upon the empirical assertion about impeding\nprogress. Our only argument is, this is a structural\nlimit necessary to assure that what would be an\neffectively perpetual term not be permitted under the\ncopyright laws.\nQUESTION: Well, perhaps I misunderstood. I\nthought the whole thrust of your argument was that there\nis a great First Amendment force here that's being\nsilenced, that's being thwarted.\nMR. LESSIG: Well, the thrust certainly --\nQUESTION: I thought that's the whole\nunderpinning of your case.\nMR. LESSIG: It's certainly the case that we are\nasserting, in light of the changed circumstances, that the\nopportunity to build upon works within the public domain\nis a fundamental First Amendment interest, and that the\nFirst Amendment values, vital speech interest at stake of\nthis case, is that the public domain be permitted as a\nsource for cultivating work about our culture without\nunnecessary legal restriction.\nQUESTION: Well, but you want more than that.\nYou want the right to copy verbatim other people's books,\ndon't you?\nMR. LESSIG: We want the right to copy verbatim\nworks that should be in the public domain and would be in\nthe public domain but for a statute that cannot be\njustified under ordinary First Amendment analysis or under\na proper reading of the limits built into the Copyright\nClause.\nQUESTION: Mr. Lessig, on your First Amendment\nargument I don't see where the retroactivity-prospectivity\ncomes in, because -- I follow your argument under the\nCopyright Clause, but if you're saying that the time is\ntoo long, the public domain should get this stuff sooner\nrather than later, would you explain to me how your\nprospectivity-retrospective line fits into your First\nAmendment claim?\nMR. LESSIG: Justice, we've argued that it would\nbe inappropriate in this case for the Court to consider\nthe prospective line until they decide whether the case,\nwhether the prospective and retrospective is severable,\nand we submit it's an easy case to show that it's not.\nQUESTION: On the First Amendment --\nMR. LESSIG: Yes.\nQUESTION: -- argument you're making that as, I\ntake it, an argument independent of, it doesn't hang on\nyour Copyright Clause argument.\nMR. LESSIG: That's right. I --\nQUESTION: And so let's just take -- let's say\nthat was your only argument in this case. How does that\ntie into a retrospective-prospective distinction?\nMR. LESSIG: Well, the strongest First Amendment\nargument is about the retrospective extension, because of\na fundamental change that occurs when Congress extends\nsubsisting copyrights, rather than when Congress\nlegislates prospectively.\nWhen Congress legislates prospectively, it has\nno way to know who's going to benefit from its extension.\nIt is simply evaluating what the term should be\nprospectively in a way that we presume this Court should\npresume is legitimate under the First Amendment. When it\nlegislates retrospectively, it is, in effect, looking at\nparticular authors and estates of authors who are before\nCongress asking for this extension, and it's choosing\nbetween these particular authors and the public at large.\nNow, it may be that in exercising that choice in\nthis case, Congress made an objective valuation of who\nwould be in the best position to advance the interests of\npromoting the progress of science, or any original --\nQUESTION: But you -- under your intermediate\nscrutiny test we would not be hypothesizing what might\nhave been in Congress's mind. Your First Amendment test\nis a stringent one. You have to have an important\npurpose, and the means that you use is necessarily tied to\nthat purpose. If you take that position, I don't see how\nyou make the retroactive-prospective line work.\nMR. LESSIG: Well, the line comes from deciding\nwhat the First Amendment interest is, and if this Court\nheed the First Amendment interest off of this difference\nbetween selecting who gets the benefit of 20 years of\nextension and just simply legislating in a general way\nprospectively, then this Court could hold, with respect to\nthe prospective, that it's not even necessary to raise the\nintermediate scrutiny in that context, but again, for\nAshwander reasons we don't think that this Court should\naddress the prospective aspect of the CTEA even under the\nFirst Amendment.\nQUESTION: Even though Congress's pattern has\nbeen to treat all authors equally? I mean, the reason\nthat it's been prospective and retrospective is that\npeople should be, people who hold copyrights should be\nsubject to the same regime and not have some people who\ngot their copyrights the week before the law passed\ntreated differently than people who got it the week after.\nMR. LESSIG: Well, Justice, that certainly is\nthe reason the Government offers for this pattern. It, of\ncourse, doesn't explain actually what Congress has done\nand, even in this case, when a work has passed into the\npublic domain, then there is precisely the same\nweek before/week after problem that you advert to, that\nextension does not extend to all subsisting works, it only\nextends to all subsisting copyrights. So that line is\nalready drawn in the practice that Congress has adopted,\nbut our point is, the only way to assure --\nQUESTION: But Congress has -- or, you're not\ndisputing that Congress has always made these extensions,\nboth retroactive and prospective?\nMR. LESSIG: Well, in 1831 it did not. In 1831\nit granted the benefit of its extension to a subset of all\nsubsisting copyright holders.\nQUESTION: Let's stick with 1976.\nMR. LESSIG: In 1976 --\nQUESTION: Because that was what you said --\nthat's -- the pattern under the CTEA is identical to the\none in the '76 act.\nMR. LESSIG: That's absolutely right, yes. So\nthey have extended it to both. But our argument is,\nunless this Court draws a line about this extension, then\nfor the reasons Judge Sentelle suggested below, there will\nbe no limit to Congress's ability to --\nQUESTION: Judge Sentelle did not deal with the\nFirst Amendment, as far as I --\nMR. LESSIG: That's right.\nQUESTION: -- recall.\nMR. LESSIG: That's right.\nQUESTION: And so I'm asking you -- perhaps I'm\nmissing it. I haven't seen where you get the\nprospective-retrospective in connection with your First\nAmendment. It seems that you're just saying there that 70\nyears is an unreasonable -- is not necessary.\nMR. LESSIG: Yes.\nQUESTION: And it doesn't serve an important\npurpose.\nMR. LESSIG: Yes. Precisely -- actually, we're\nnot saying anything about the 70 years in this case even\nunder the First Amendment, because we believe it's\nunseverable, but --\nQUESTION: But I thought you were saying that if\nyou accept the Copyright Clause argument, then you have a\nway, in effect, of devaluing the Government's claim of its\nimportant interest and important objective when you get to\nthe First Amendment intermediate scrutiny analysis.\nWhereas if you don't accept the Copyright Clause claim,\nthen, in order to make the First Amendment analysis we've\nsimply got to say, well, gee, is the promotion of useful\nart and so on more important than the public domain, and\ncan we say that that allows a distinction between 50 years\nand 70 years?\nWe're pretty much at sea, so I thought your\nCopyright Clause argument was necessary to give us some\nhandle with which to deal with the First Amendment.\nMR. LESSIG: Our Copyright Clause argument is\ncertainly a way of framing why extensions of subsisting\nterms cannot be seen to promote the First Amendment\ninterest of speech at all.\nQUESTION: Okay. Let's assume we don't -- for\nthe sake of argument here, let's assume we don't accept\nthe Copyright Clause argument. Do you have an independent\nFirst Amendment argument in your brief?\nMR. LESSIG: Yes, of course we do.\nQUESTION: Okay, and it is -- tell me in a\nsentence or two what it is. I mean, at that point I'm\nwhere Justice Ginsburg is.\nMR. LESSIG: Yes. The First Amendment argument\nwe've argued in our brief is with respect to the\nretrospective extension, and the First Amendment argument\nis, that needs to --\nQUESTION: No, but that's the Copyright Clause\nargument, and it seems to me you're saying, okay, we then\napply that in First Amendment analysis, which allows us to\nmake a coherent intermediate scrutiny argument.\nIf we don't accept the Copyright Clause\nretrospectivity argument --\nMR. LESSIG: Yes.\nQUESTION: -- then what is your First Amendment\nargument?\nMR. LESSIG: That's right, I'm sorry, Justice.\nWhat I'm saying is not that it's the retrospectivity that\nmakes the First Amendment argument troubling -- I mean,\nthat drives our First Amendment argument. All I'm saying\nis, we have addressed the retrospective portion of CTEA,\nand so I'm saying in the retrospective portion of CTEA you\nwould apply ordinary, intermediate First Amendment review,\nand you would ask --\nQUESTION: Well, this Court really has not -- if\nyou say that the Copyright Clause is not violated, I don't\nthink there are examples where this Court has then\nresorted to First Amendment analysis to invalidate the\nsame act.\nMR. LESSIG: Well --\nQUESTION: I mean, this would be quite a new\nproposition.\nMR. LESSIG: Well, Justice O'Connor, the First\nAmendment is always an independent limitation on what\notherwise would be legitimate exercises of congressional\nauthority, so this --\nQUESTION: Yes, but the Framers seem to have\nadopted these two things at the same time --\nMR. LESSIG: That's right.\nQUESTION: -- in effect.\nMR. LESSIG: That's right, and if --\nQUESTION: And I think there are not examples\nthat I can think of where we have said, well, we'll\nanalyze it under the Copyright Clause, but if that\nfails we'll turn to the First Amendment.\nMR. LESSIG: Justice, that's right. If only we\nhad the Framers' copyright before us, because of course,\nagain remember,the exclusive right the Framers spoke of\nwas the right to print and publish. It didn't include the\nderivative rights, it didn't include the display rights,\nand it certainly --\nQUESTION: Right. It has expanded very much,\nand they also envisioned a very short term, and I can find\na lot of fault with what Congress did here --\nMR. LESSIG: That's right.\nQUESTION: -- because it does take a lot of\nthings out of the public domain that one would think that\nsomeone in Congress would want to think hard about.\nMR. LESSIG: That's right.\nQUESTION: But having done that, it's very\ndifficult to find the basis in the Constitution for saying\nit isn't a limited term. It's longer than one might think\ndesirable --\nMR. LESSIG: Right.\nQUESTION: -- but is it not limited?\nMR. LESSIG: Well, if it is limited, then there\nis no limit to the ability of Congress to extend\nsubsisting terms, and that fundamentally destroys the\nobjective that the --\nQUESTION: The rule against perpetuities might\njump in there at some point.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. LESSIG: Right, and we submit the Framers\nhad something very different in mind than the rule against\nperpetuities. The point is, if this is permitted, then\nthere is no limit to the ability to extend terms, and that\nis precisely contrary to what the Framers had in mind when\nthey worried about this problem originally.\nWhat was the problem they were solving? It was,\nas this Court stated in Graham --\nQUESTION: Well, I could agree with you, in\nterms of policy, that this flies directly in the face of\nwhat the Framers had in mind, absolutely. But does it\nviolate the Constitution?\nMR. LESSIG: Well, if it flies in the face of\nwhat the Framers had in mind, then the question is, is\nthere a way of interpreting their words that gives effect\nto what they had in mind, and the answer is yes.\nQUESTION: Well, you know, certainly what is\nhappening in the country today in the way of\ncongressional -- under the Commerce Clause is totally\ndifferent than what the Framers had in mind, but we've\nnever felt that that was the criterion. What the Framers\nthought of, there weren't steamboats, there weren't\nrailroads.\nMR. LESSIG: That's right.\nQUESTION: We've said there was a general grant,\nand that Congress was free to run with it in many\nrespects.\nMR. LESSIG: In many respects, Mr. Chief\nJustice, but, as this Court has also said, there are\nlimits to what Congress can do under the Commerce Clause.\nQUESTION: But isn't --\nQUESTION: Can I ask you about one of the\nlimits, just focusing on the Copyright Clause and the\nprogress of science and useful arts? In your view, does\nthat -- is that limited to encouraging creativity by\nauthors and inventors, or does it also include the\ndistribution of materials that might not otherwise be\ndistributed, like old films and so forth?\nMR. LESSIG: We're happy to adopt a broader\ninterpretation of what promote the progress is about,\nwithin the general framework that the Framers established\nin light of the English practice, which was a quid pro\nquo. The ability to facilitate distribution --\nQUESTION: So that if the quid pro quo is that\nwe can facilitate distribution of some old film by an\nadditional monopoly grant, you'd think that's permissible?\nMR. LESSIG: So long as the grant is conditioned\nupon the distribution. So long as the grant --\nQUESTION: In other words you could have --\nright now, if Congress decides to have a law, and this law\nis going to give copyrights in 1) the Bible, 2)\nShakespeare, 3) Ben Jonson, and the reason they do it is\nthat they think that that would lead publishers to produce\nthose and distribute them, and they're right, they will,\nokay? In your view, that's perfectly constitutional?\nMR. LESSIG: No, that's the view of the\nGovernment's, Justice Breyer. My view is --\nQUESTION: Well, I thought that was the question\nyou were getting, and I thought you were saying -- I must\nhave misunderstood. I thought you were saying that was\nconstitutional.\nMR. LESSIG: No. What we were saying is, if\nCongress wants to permit restoration of films, for\nexample, an issue that's been well briefed here, Congress\ncan say, if you restore the film, then the restoration\ngets a copyright so long as it satisfies originality as\noutlined in Feist, and it gets a copyright for a period of\ntime. But this Court's opinion in Graham and in Feist\nmade clear that it could not extend copyrights to works in\nthe public domain. The Government doesn't concede that,\nbut we stand on that as a way of understanding why this\nCourt --\nQUESTION: So your answer to Justice Stevens is\nno, they cannot give a copyright purely for purposes of\ndissemination to publishers, is that right?\nMR. LESSIG: No.\nQUESTION: Oh, all right.\nMR. LESSIG: They cannot give a copyright purely\nfor purposes of distribution to publishers.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. LESSIG: They would need to satisfy all of\nthe implied limitations that this Court has expressed in\nthe context of this, the most carefully limited clause in\nArticle I, section 8. It is one of the --\nQUESTION: Mr. Lessig, the clause says, Congress\nshall, and suppose Congress decides in this expanded world\nof ours that it's going to make certain changes and demand\nother changes from our treaty partners. Suppose it says,\nwell, the Germans led the fight for 70 years in the\nEuropean Union, we'll go with that, but we're going to\ninsist that they have a more expansive notion of, say, a\nfair use. Now, why couldn't that fit within the promotion\nof knowledge?\nMR. LESSIG: Justice Ginsburg, we have no\nquarrel with the objective of harmonization fitting within\nthe \"promote the progress of science\" understanding,\nsubject to constitutional limitations.\nIf France adopted a rule that said you couldn't\ngrant copyrights to hate speech, we could not harmonize\nwith that rule consistent with our First Amendment and\nsimilarly, as Mary Beth Peters testified before Congress,\nours is the only Constitution that has an express\nlimitation on terms. That's got to mean something, and if\nit means that we are limited in our ability to agree with\nthe Europeans as they continually expand the term in light\nof their own vision of what copyright is about, then\nthat's the meaning of a constitutional restriction.\nThis Court's interpretation of \"limited times\"\ncould, of course, eviscerate that term of any meaning, but\nunder the principle of enumeration as this Court has\narticulated it, this Court should interpret that clause in\na way that gives its terms effect in a simple way. Just\nas a limited addition print is not a limited -- is not\nlimited if each time a customer comes in a new print is\nprinted, so, too, a limited term is not limited if each\ntime copyright holders come to Congress they can extend\nthe term.\nQUESTION: Well, but the difference -- the\nreason that analogy doesn't cut it for me is that the\nlimited edition print depends basically on an implied\nunderstanding between the person who makes the print and\nthe person who buys it, and the understanding is, you\nwon't go beyond 100, or whatever number you write.\nWe're not engaged in a contractual analysis\nunder the Copyright Clause between the writer and the --\nand somebody representing the public domain.\nMR. LESSIG: That's right.\nQUESTION: The analogy doesn't seem to work.\nMR. LESSIG: That's right. All that I'm\nsuggesting is, here is a plain meaning of the term that\ngives effect to the constitutional limit in a way that\nassures that, in fact, the limit is respected, contrary to\nthe Government's argument, which, in effect, permits\nCongress the power perpetually to extend terms.\nIf I may reserve the remainder of my time.\nQUESTION: Very well, Mr. Lessig.\nGeneral Olson, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nGENERAL OLSON: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe questions today, especially the initial\nquestions, suggest one of the many insurmountable\nobstacles to petitioners' petition in, position in this\ncase. That is that the first Congress explicitly gave\ncopyright protection to the authors of any books already\nprinted as well as explicitly the owners of existing\ncopyrights. Thereafter, in 1831, 1909, 1976, and 1998,\nand in numerous private copyright bills and temporary\nextensions of the copyright law and in repeated patent law\nrevisions, Congress extended the terms of Federal\ncopyright and patent protection of subsisting works.\nAs this Court explained 100 and some years ago\nin its Burrows-Giles opinion, such constructions are\naccorded very great weight and, as that Court went on to\nsay, when consistent and unchallenged for over a century\nare almost conclusive that consistent construction by\nCongress of its authority under the Copyright and Patent\nClause now has lasted from the 105th -- from the first\nthrough the 105th Congress. It has been sustained by\nJustices of this Court and early decisions of this Court.\nIt is consistent with what the law of England was from the\nStatute of Anne --\nQUESTION: Yes, but take one of the early\nextensions, just extending a -- an already granted patent\nto an inventor for an extra 10 years. How can that be\nsquared with the language of the provision? Maybe\nCongress did it, but maybe it acted improperly when it did\nit.\nGENERAL OLSON: Well, the Congress --\nQUESTION: And that's our question, really.\nGENERAL OLSON: Well, that -- it seems to me\nthat there may be -- this is -- the clause itself is a\nvery, very broad grant. It says the --\nQUESTION: Do you view it as entirely a grant,\nor do you think it also contains limitations?\nGENERAL OLSON: Well, I think that to the extent\nthat there may be limitations, Justice Stevens, they\nare -- require considerable deference by this Court to the\njudgment of Congress --\nQUESTION: Well, I understand that, but do\nyou -- I'd be interested in knowing, do you think it does\ncontain limitations?\nGENERAL OLSON: It contains -- the clause itself\ncontains limitations, limited times, authors, exclusive\nrights and things of that nature. I don't think -- and\nthe petitioners expressly disclaim the assertion that\nthere are any substantive limitations in the \"Promote the-\nProgress\" Clause.\nWhat the Framers were saying is, we want to give\nCongress the authority to promote the progress of useful\narts and sciences, and --\nQUESTION: How did the example we just talked\nabout, a patentee giving an extra 10 years on his -- how\ndoes that promote the progress of science?\nGENERAL OLSON: Well, it may provide additional\nincentives for the patentee to exploit and promote and\ndisseminate that particular work. With respect to\ncreative works like works of art, books and that sort of\nthing, it may provide many ways --\nQUESTION: I'm just concentrating on our\npatentee, and I'm wondering how that fits into the notion\nthat there was a bargain in effect between the inventor\nand the Government that at a certain period of time it\nwould become part of the public domain. It seems to me\nit's inconsistent with that.\nGENERAL OLSON: It isn't inconsistent, I submit,\nJustice Stevens, for the Congress to exercise its juris --\nits responsibility under this broad grant of power to\ndetermine that there could be many ways in which the\nholder of an existing right may benefit the public by\ncontinuing to have that right for an additional period of\ntime, the same reason that Congress -- same reasons that\nCongress had when it created the right in the first place.\nIt's not just the right --\nQUESTION: No, the reason for the right in the\nfirst place was to encourage invention.\nGENERAL OLSON: Well, but I -- we submit that\nspecifically with respect to the Copyright Clause, but I\nthink it applies to the patent portion of the clause at\nall, it isn't just the invention, it isn't just the\nwriting of the work -- and this relates to the questions\nthat were asked of my colleague a moment ago. It includes\nthe dissemination of the work, not necessarily --\nQUESTION: Dissemination alone?\nGENERAL OLSON: Not necessarily the\ndissemination alone --\nQUESTION: Well, no, not -- don't say not\nnecessarily. I'm -- for purposes of my thinking about it,\nI'd like to know, imagine we have just dissemination.\nGENERAL OLSON: That something is already in the\npublic domain.\nQUESTION: That's correct. The only\njustification for the extension, there is no other, is\ndissemination of a work that is already in existence.\nGENERAL OLSON: I would not want to rule that\nout, Justice Breyer, for the very reason --\nQUESTION: Well, I want to say, do you think yes\nor no?\nGENERAL OLSON: Well, I think that it could very\nwell be yes, for the reason that in the 1790 statute the\nCongress specifically was aware of -- that there were\nState copyright laws which didn't last as long as the\nFederal statute. Several of the States hadn't finished\nenacting those copyright laws, and a couple of States\nhadn't enacted them at all.\nQUESTION: So in your opinion, in my example, if\nyou recall it --\nGENERAL OLSON: It's --\nQUESTION: -- your answer would be, if Congress\ntomorrow wants to give a copyright to a publisher solely\nfor the purpose of reproducing and disseminating Ben\nJonson, Shakespeare, it can do it?\nGENERAL OLSON: It may --\nQUESTION: I hate to say may --\nGENERAL OLSON: Well --\nQUESTION: -- because that really -- that's an\nimportant question.\nGENERAL OLSON: Well, because I don't think that\na per -- I don't think there is a per se rule that should\napply here because this is a grant of Congress, to\nCongress to exercise its judgment as to what may be\nbeneficial. There may be other constitutional provisions\nthat come into play, or there may be other existing --\nQUESTION: All right, let me explain to you why\nit's important to me. I have a list. This is an economic\nstatute. The harms that seem to be caused by it, the\nextension, I've listed as follows, approximate numbers,\nmade up, but magnitude correct.\nThe existing copyright holders who survive,\ntheir copyright survives 70 years, who have already been\npaid, on the numbers that were given, about $24 billion or\nmore, will receive an extra $6 billion. That, I take it,\nis a harm. Their works have already been created.\nHarm number 2. The fact that people, for the 99\npercent of the copyrights that have no commercial value\nafter 70 years, have to find the copyright holder to put\nthem in databases. The cost of that, on my numbers in\nhere, made up, at least a billion dollars, or they can't\nfind the people at all and get permission, an innumerable\ncost, un -- valuable cost to people who want to use it.\nThose are costs.\nOn the plus side I see uniformity,\ndissemination, and -- now, you tell me.\nGENERAL OLSON: Well, I also see compliance with\ninternational competitive markets and the laws that are\nbeing adopted, and the incentives --\nQUESTION: Uniformity. That's uniformity.\nGENERAL OLSON: Well, that's not just\nuniformity. It's providing incentive to people to publish\nhere, as opposed to publish in Europe, where longer terms\nmight be available. There is an incentive to distribute\nexisting works that may be necessary. It's the\nconsistency that Congress is promoting by saying to\nindividuals, as they might have said when they enacted the\nCopyright Clause in the first place, we will not only give\nyou 14 years, but if we change our mind tomorrow, and\nthink that a better, a longer period is necessary,\nwe're -- this is consistency, but it's also a matter of\nfairness, and it's --\nQUESTION: Why -- on the last point, it's --\nI've counted that as zero. The reason I've counted it as\nzero is it seems to me that the added value, incentive\nvalue to produce between life plus 50, or life plus 70, is\nzero. It's carried out, as the economists do, to three\ndecimal points, divide by 100 for the probability of your\never having such a work, and you get virtually zero, no\ndifference between this and a perpetual copyright.\nGENERAL OLSON: Well, I think that that's a very\ngood illustration of why the authority is granted to\nCongress, because if you are an 80-year-old writer, that\nmay make a considerable difference in terms of what you\ndecide to do.\nQUESTION: How could it?\nGENERAL OLSON: It may -- because you may -- if\nyou have no incentive, if you know that this is going to\ngo into the public domain sooner rather than later, it may\naffect your judgment with respect to --\nQUESTION: In -- I --\nGENERAL OLSON: It might also affect whether the\npublisher -- what the publisher pays for your prospective\nwork, Justice Breyer. We -- the Copyright Clause\nincentive provides incentives not just for -- not just to\nthe creators, but to the disseminators, the publishers,\nthe broadcasters, the film companies.\nQUESTION: So you think, say, Verdi, Othello,\nVerdi, Othello, 80 years old, the prospect of an extra 20\nyears way down the pike would have made a difference?\nGENERAL OLSON: Well, I think again that\nillustrates why the authority is vested in Congress to\nmake these judgments rather than in courts to make these\njudgments, because we're not talking about the effect on\nan individual author, or an individual creator. What the\nFramers of the Constitution were concerned about is a\ngross judgment with respect to what might generally\nprovide incentives to the population --\nQUESTION: But it is hard to understand how, if\nthe overall purpose of the Copyright Clause is to\nencourage creative work, how some retroactive extension\ncould possibly do that. I -- one wonders what was in the\nminds of the Congress, even if somehow they didn't violate\nthe clause. But if we affirm here, is there any limiting\nprinciple out there that would ever kick in?\nGENERAL OLSON: Well, that's a -- that is a\ndifficult question to say whether there is any limiting\nprinciple when such a broad grant of power, authority is\ngiven to Congress and has been exercised so repeatedly\nthat --\nQUESTION: Well, if it's a limited term, as the\nConstitution says, is there indeed any limit out there?\nGENERAL OLSON: What I submit -- well, first of\nall, even the petitioners acknowledge that, as far as\nprospective limits are concerned, that isn't a judgment\nthat this Court is being made to ask and, in fact, the\npetitioners acknowledge that it isn't a judgment that this\nCourt should make, so the only point that the\npetitioners --\nQUESTION: Well, if Congress says we're going to\ngrant this copyright indefinitely, forever --\nGENERAL OLSON: That would seem --\nQUESTION: -- that violates the limited term,\ndoes it not?\nGENERAL OLSON: I acknowledge that. And\nanything that --\nQUESTION: In Victorian England you could buy a\nbox seat for 900 years. There was serene complacency\nabout their culture, and God bless them, but --\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: -- I really think this is an\nimportant question and, as Justice O'Connor points out, if\nwe have to ask what's the most plausible explanation for\nthis rule, to reward existing vested interest or to\nstimulate new works, it seems to me that it's probably the\nformer.\nGENERAL OLSON: Well --\nQUESTION: I mean, we know that.\nGENERAL OLSON: It is -- well, it -- let me say\nwith respond -- in response to both of those questions, an\nunlimited time would violate the Copyright Clause.\nSomething that was the functional equivalent of an\nunlimited time would violate the Copyright Clause, but the\nFramers specifically did not put in numbers. They had the\nopportunity to do that. Thomas Jefferson suggested that a\nnumber should be put in. We submit that it would be --\neven -- since the petitioners don't suggest that it's an\nappropriate function of this Court, certainly in this\ncase, to pick a number, 133 years or something of that\nnature, but it is quite clear that Congress from the\nStatute of Anne, 1710, we have 300 years of history, of\nCongress thinking that it continues to benefit the\nprocess, not just of the productivity, of the creation of\nthe work itself, but the dissemination of it to provide --\nQUESTION: General Olson, you say that the\nfunctional equivalent of an unlimited time would be a\nviolation, but that's precisely the argument that's being\nmade by petitioners here, that a limited time which is\nextendable is the functionable, functional equivalent of\nan unlimited time, a limited time that 10 years from now\ncan be extended, and then extended again, and extended\nagain. Why -- their argument is precisely that, a limited\ntime doesn't mean anything unless it means, once you have\nestablished the limit for works that have been created\nunder that limit, that's the end.\nGENERAL OLSON: Well, the Framers had an\nopportunity to say immutable, unalterable, unamendable.\nThey didn't use that. They used the phrase, limited term,\nwhich means then, meant then and means now, a certain\nspecified --\nQUESTION: Okay, assuming --\nGENERAL OLSON: -- number of years under the\nstatute.\nQUESTION: With the exception of a limitation\nwhich illustrates the distinction between forever on the\none hand and a definite number on the other, is there any\nlimitation in the clause? Does the promotion, does the\npreambular recitation of promotion as such place a limit\non it?\nGENERAL OLSON: I submit, Justice Souter, that\nthere's no per se limitation, that if there is, as Justice\nScalia suggested, for -- if it is true that Congress,\nhaving specified 14 years or 28 years, decides that\ndoesn't work very well because of the economies of other\ncountries, the parade of constraints on artists in other\ncountries, the reasons that we want things to be preserved\nor distributed, it should be 2 more years, or 5 more years\nlater --\nQUESTION: Yes, but that argument would apply to\nnew copyrights, but to extension of already existing\ncopyrights your argument doesn't apply.\nGENERAL OLSON: It does apply, Justice Stevens,\nbecause --\nQUESTION: The work has already been created.\nGENERAL OLSON: The work has already been\ncreated, but the artists that are creating works day in\nand day out take into consideration the fact that Congress\nhas decided, there's an ease of administration --\nQUESTION: But for them, they get the benefit of\nthe longer term if you don't apply it to an existing\ncopyright. I mean, if you say you need 70 years because\nof changes in the economy to encourage works, you grant 70\nfor the future, but why does that, making that apply to\nsomebody who created his work 20 years ago and has already\nprovided what he, the quid pro quo, why do you need it for\nhim?\nGENERAL OLSON: We're not just -- because we're\nnot just talking about the author. If we -- we're talking\nabout --\nQUESTION: The Constitution refers to the\nauthors and the inventors, doesn't it? They're certainly\nthe prime actors in this scene, aren't they?\nGENERAL OLSON: Yes, but all of the history of\nthe development of these clauses suggests that -- and this\nCourt has indicated in its decisions with respect to\ncopyright, that the Framers were concerned and the\nCongress is legitimately concerned not just in providing\nthe spark of creativity, but to make sure that that's\ndistributed widely and available, and there may be many\nreasons why -- we're -- we --\nQUESTION: And that it gets into the public\ndomain at the expiration of the term. That was an\nimportant part of the bargain.\nGENERAL OLSON: Yes, and what -- but the\ndefinition of the term was a responsibility vested in\nCongress, because it has the power -- the legislative\nhistory of the 1998 act itself suggests what was going on\nhere and suggests why the Framers gave this authority to\nCongress. There were numerous hearings, there were\ntestimony by the folks that represent the same position as\npetitioners here as to why this shouldn't be done, why it\nshould be done.\nCongress weighed -- as this Court, the phrase\nthat this Court used, I think it was in the Feist case,\nthe delicate balance that was so difficult for Congress\nto --\nQUESTION: How --\nQUESTION: Okay, but you --\nQUESTION: -- what weighs in that balance,\nbecause to go back for one second, in practical, economic\nterms I gather the difference between a copyright that\nlasts for 100 years, lasts for 1,000 years, lasts forever,\nis probably something less than 1,000 -- on $1,000 a\npenny. I mean, it's a penny on 1,000, or probably a lot\nless than that, frankly. So I can not only not imagine a\nperson whose decision to write would be governed by such a\nthing, I cannot imagine a European who would come to\nAmerica to copyright his work for such a reason. Indeed,\nI wonder why that European wouldn't come anyway, even if\nthe term were 10 years, because if he doesn't come, he's\nnot going to get protection.\nGENERAL OLSON: Well, the --\nQUESTION: I mean, who are these people that are\ngoing to be moved by that incentive?\nGENERAL OLSON: The -- as we described in our\nbrief, in pages 34 through 36, I believe it is in our\nbrief, that the concerns about the limitation on\nexploitation and the limitation of a copyright period in\nEurope is based upon the country of origin of the work and\nthe shortest time available. So that there may be\ndifferences, and we describe that, but that illustrates,\nJustice Breyer, the difference between 1 cents and 10\ncents and $100 with respect to this particular author\nwho's this particular age, or a particular author like\nMelville, whose works weren't -- weren't -- didn't -- or\nSchubert, whose works weren't properly appreciated or\nexploitable until many years after their death.\nAll of these variations are quintessentially\nlegislative judgments. It would be very difficult for the\nFramers to have eschewed deciding 14 years was a\nconstitutional limitation, and for this Court to say 99\nyears is, and again, even the petitioners aren't asking\nthe Court to make that judgment. The petitioners are only\nsaying that there shall be a per se rule that the word\n\"limited times,\" means unchangeable times.\nQUESTION: But there has to be a limit, as you\nacknowledge. Perpetual copyright is not permitted. Who\nis the judge of -- within that line? Who is the judge of\nwhen it becomes unlimited? Is there, in other words,\njudicial review and, if there is, what standard would this\nCourt apply to determine whether something short of\nperpetual is still unlimited?\nGENERAL OLSON: Well, the issue before this\nCourt, I hasten to say, as I said before, is only whether,\nonce the Congress makes that judgment, it can ever change\nit retrospectively. The issue before this Court is not\nwhether, in the future, a certain length of time would be\nappropriate. That -- but the answer to that, Justice\nGinsburg, I submit, is found in the Necessary and Proper\nClause, and this Court's interpretation of the Necessary\nand Proper Clause as to the extent that this Court would\nfind or not find that the judgment made by Congress with\nrespect to the implementation of this very broad power is\nconvenient or useful in terms of the achievement of the\ngoals.\nQUESTION: Okay, and is your argument that we\nshould so find and hold against their retrospective\nargument, because there is some, at least plausible basis\nto say that there can be a causal connection between the\nretrospective extension and some benefit that can be\ntraced to those particular works through the retrospective\nextension, like dissemination? Is that your argument?\nGENERAL OLSON: That is among our arguments,\nJustice Souter.\nQUESTION: Is it also your argument that even if\nyou cannot trace that kind, or at least plausibly argue\nthat there could be that kind of a causal benefit, that it\nwould still be constitutional, because you should judge\nthe extension simply as contributing to a general system,\none feature of which is that from time to time there may\nbe retrospective extensions, and so long as that general\nsystem induces the creation of works, or the dissemination\nof works, or the preservation of works, so long as the\ngeneral system works, there is no review, no limitation on\nthe tinkering that can be done, even retrospectively? Is\nthat also your argument?\nGENERAL OLSON: I think that's a fair statement\nof an argument that we have made and articulated in the\nbrief --\nQUESTION: Okay.\nGENERAL OLSON: -- that unless there is a -- the\nCourt is -- because the circumstances change, that we are\nliving in an era now where piracy is a significant\nproblem, there's question of administrative ease, of\nadministering a system where copyrights may be different\nfor one set of authors, or different for another set of\nauthors, there's changes that are taking place\ninternationally, so that what we're saying is that not\nonly could this Court conceive of reasons why Congress\nthought it was accomplishing the objectives of this\nclause, but that there are numerous objectives that are\nentirely legitimate in --\nQUESTION: Do you also argue that the Necessary\nand Proper Clause alone will justify the retroactive\nextension simply as a matter of equity?\nGENERAL OLSON: Yes.\nQUESTION: That is, that the Copyright Clause\njustifies the extension for works not yet created, but it\nwould be enormously inequitable to have other authors who\nput in the same amount of work get a lesser protection, so\nthe Necessary and Proper Clause now allows you to do the\nretrospective?\nGENERAL OLSON: Yes, Justice Scalia, and the\nexamples that are --\nQUESTION: Can I ask you, why is it enormously\ninequitable if they get exactly what they were entitled to\nat the time they made the work?\nGENERAL OLSON: The implicit promise that --\nQUESTION: I mean, they have some right to\nexpect that they will be -- you know, an additional grant,\nlater on?\nGENERAL OLSON: I think that's not an\nunreasonable expectation at all, Justice Stevens, because\nthat was the premise of the --\nQUESTION: That is the way it's always been\ndone. There hasn't been any copyright extension that\nhasn't applied to subsisting work.\nGENERAL OLSON: That's --\nQUESTION: But there was one -- Justice Breyer\nbrought up Ben Jonson, so -- this case doesn't involve\nworks that are already in the public domain.\nGENERAL OLSON: That is correct.\nQUESTION: This is subsisting copyrights.\nGENERAL OLSON: That is correct.\nQUESTION: So --\nQUESTION: But why wouldn't it?\nQUESTION: Why? Why not?\nQUESTION: Why wouldn't it? If the equity\nargument under the Necessary and Proper Clause justifies\nextension of the copyright for those whose copyright will\nexpire tomorrow if it's not extended, in order to put them\non parity with those getting copyrights for new works, why\ndoesn't it apply to the copyright, the holder of the\ncopyright that expired yesterday?\nGENERAL OLSON: You could arguably -- you could\nconceivably make that argument, Justice Souter, but there\nis a bright line there. Something that has already gone\ninto the public domain, which other individuals or\ncompanies or entities may then have acquired an interest\nin, or rights to, or be involved in disseminating --\nQUESTION: And if you don't --\nGENERAL OLSON: This is a rational --\nQUESTION: If you don't draw the line there,\nthen Ben Jonson certainly gets recopyrighted.\nQUESTION: Well, the difficulty --\nQUESTION: If we're just looking for a bright\nline, the line that they suggest between unexpired patents\nand copyrights and brand new ones is also just as bright.\nGENERAL OLSON: Oh, I concede that it's a bright\nline, but it's a bright line that would have --\nQUESTION: Except Congress chose this one and\ndidn't choose the other one. That's --\nGENERAL OLSON: Congress --\nQUESTION: Basically you're saying the\npresumption ought to be in the congressional judgment\nabout how to draw the line as well as in how long a line\nto draw.\nGENERAL OLSON: I agree, and this Court has --\nwe're not just talking about the judgment of the Congress\nof the -- the 105th Congress in 1998. This is the way the\nStatute of Anne was written. This is the way the State\ncopyright laws were written when this country became a\nNation. This is the way the 1790 copyright statute, the\nnumber of --\nQUESTION: Well, of course, the original statute\nwas replacing a bunch of State statutes or State rules,\npartly common law, partly statutory, that -- they had kind\nof a mixed up legal situation, and there was an interest\nin having one uniform rule for the first time around.\nGENERAL OLSON: Well, there was an interest in\nhaving a uniform rule, and that's precisely why the\nFramers created the Copyright Clause in the Constitution,\nbut there was copyright protection in some States, there\nwasn't copyright protection in other States, and what we\nknow from the decision of this Court in the Wheaton\ndecision is that there was not a common law copyright in\nexistence. This Court explicitly held that.\nNow, the petitioners make this quid pro quo\nargument that somehow implicitly the initial 1790\ncopyright statute was saying to people, you get a\ncopyright if you exchange whatever existing rights you\nhave. That simply does not make any sense. There is no\nlanguage, and it's a relatively late-discovered argument,\nbecause it sees its full --\nQUESTION: I want you to finish that, but I want\nyou to go back to the -- I have one question on the equity\nprinciple. Are you -- I want you to finish.\nGENERAL OLSON: I wasn't finished, but I'm happy\nto come back.\nQUESTION: Go ahead. No, no, you finish first.\nGENERAL OLSON: Well, I was going to say there's\nno language whatsoever of preemption, abandonment,\nabrogation, or exchange in the 1790 copyright, but\ncompare -- Copyright Act. But compare that to the 1793\nPatent Act under the same clause, where there is that\nexchange there.\nThe other thing, as this Court has said, there\nis no implied abrogation of common law rights which would\nbe a doctrine which would be inconsistent with what the\npetitioner is arguing. Now --\nQUESTION: Why -- I mean, I think you have a\npoint on this equity principle. I wonder, is there any\nreview there? That is, suppose you have a statute, as\nthis one arguably is, where 99.9 percent, many billions of\ndollars of benefits, are going to the existing holders of\ncopyright on grounds of equity, and the effect of the\nstatute in eliciting new works is near zero. I mean, that\nwould seem -- where this equity idea is the camel and the\nproduction idea is the gnat, and is there any -- can we\nsay something like that, or does Congress have total\nleeway in respect to --\nGENERAL OLSON: Well, it --\nQUESTION: -- who they want to give the money\nto, basically?\nGENERAL OLSON: Justice Breyer, it's conceivable\nthat the Court might do that if that situation was\npresent, but it's not remotely the situation here. We\nhave the adoption of copyright terms which are consistent,\ngenerally speaking, with copyright terms which exist in\nthe European Union, our principal competitor, and in\nconnection with international treaties.\nWe have a copyright term that's consistent with\nthe concept of the creator plus the creator's first\ngeneration heirs. We have a copyright term, remember,\nwhich supersedes the earlier copyright provisions that\nwere added to the period between creation and publication,\nso that the limited number of years in the first, the 1790\nand the 1831 statute were the number of years plus the\nrelatively unlimited period of time between creation and\npublication, so we don't have anything remotely like that\nin this situation.\nWe have a process which, as you suggested, or\none of the questions suggested, is -- may not have been\nthe policy that you as a Member of Congress would have\nsupported. You might have made the balance, that delicate\nbalance that this Court has referred to, in another way,\nbut that is something that Congress, through its ability\nto gather facts and make balances, is quintessentially\ncapable of doing, and that is where the Framers vested\nthe responsibility, and what this statute does is to\nfavor, if at all, the creator with respect to the\nutilization of these rights, as opposed to the person who\nwishes to copy the creator. That's an entirely rational\ndistinction for Congress to make.\nThank you.\nQUESTION: Thank you, General Olson.\nMr. Lessig, you have 3 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE LESSIG\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. LESSIG: General Olson has been perfectly\nclear in setting out the structure of the Government's\nargument. It is that there is no effective limit on\nCongress's power under the Copyright Clause. Now, were\nthis the first time this Court had considered Congress's\ncopyright authority, that might be a plausible argument,\nbut the very first time this Court ever struck down a law\nof Congress as exceeding Article I, section 8 power was in\nthe context of the Copyright Clause.\nWe have 125 years of history of this Court\nmaking sure that the limits, both express and implied, in\nthe Copyright Clause, have some meaning. The Feist\nopinion very clearly sets out the implied limits, a per se\nlimit for originality, for the reasons Justice Breyer was\ntrying to get me to say. The Harper as well as Graham set\nout very clear limits on the context of the ability to\nextend works in the public domain. Those limits make no\nsense under the reasoning the Government has offered. The\nGovernment's reasoning would make all of those opinions\nirrelevant and wrong.\nNow, we offer a simple way to make this clear,\nexpress limit make sense, and that is precisely the\nunderstanding we suggest that existed in 1790. The only\nprecedents that existed in 1790 were precedents of\nsetting a term, and then when parliament was asked in\n1735, '37, and '39 to extend it, they rejected it, and as\namicus historians said, they rejected it because, as a\npamphleteer described it, that would be effectively a\nperpetual term.\nNow, this delicate balance that the Government\ninvokes, Justice Breyer, let me give you the numbers. The\ndelicate balance is that, under the most reasonable\nassumptions of copyright royalty income and under our\ninterest rate of 7 percent, as the amicus economists note\nat page 6, note 6 of their brief, the current term gives\nauthors 99.8 percent of the value of a perpetual term.\nNow, that might be a delicate balance, that they\ngive the author 99.8 percent and the public .2 percent,\nbut in my mind, that's delicate in a very different sense\nof that term.\nThank you very much.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr. Lessig.\n"
