Mr. Bopp.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES BOPP, JR.,\nON BEHALF OF PETITIONER\nMR. BOPP: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please\nthe Court: Like most states, Minnesota selects its judges\nthrough periodic popular elections. And when candidates'\nspeech is severely restricted, the people are denied\naccess to the information they need to make an informed\nchoice. While state court judges are different from other\nelected officials, Minnesota's Announce Clause, as now\ninterpreted by its supreme court, goes too far resulting\nin elections without campaigns.\nQUESTION: Could we find out from you just what\nthe Announce Clause prohibits that isn't already\nprohibited by the Pledges and Promises Clause, as it's\nbeen interpreted?\nMR. BOPP: Yes, Justice O'Connor. The Announce\nClause prohibits, according the decision of the Eighth\nCircuit, any general -- allows general discussions of the\nlaw, while it prohibits any implying of how a person would\nrule -- a candidate would rule, on an issue or case before\nthe Court.\nQUESTION: How does that differ, then, from the\nPledges or Promises Clause?\nMR. BOPP: The Pledges and Promises Clause\nprohibits any pledge or promise that -- other than\nfaithful performance of duties in office. The difference\nbetween \"announce,\" the plain language of the clause, and\n\"pledge or promise\" -- \"announce\" is simply making known,\nis one of the formulations of the Eighth Circuit, or\nimplying; while \"pledging or promising\" is making a\ncommitment on how you would rule in a future case.\nQUESTION: But you think the Announce Clause,\neven as interpreted by the Eighth Circuit to be the same\nas the ABA canon, goes beyond that?\nMR. BOPP: Well, Your Honor, there is one aspect\nof the current 1990 ABA canon that has -- was not\ndiscussed by the Ninth Circuit or by the ABA brief. And\nthat --\nQUESTION: And where does that appear in your\nbrief? Where is the ABA canon we're talking about? Where\nis it? I want to look at it while you're talking about\nit.\nMR. BOPP: I do not have a reference to the ABA\ncanon, Your Honor. I apologize. The ABA canon states\nthat a -- the 1990 ABA canon states that a candidate may\nnot make statements to commit, or appears to commit in\ndeciding cases, controversies, or issues likely to come\nbefore the Court. While the ABA and the Eighth Circuit\nseem to imply that the 1990 canon was similar, if not the\nsame, as the 1972 canon, they did not discuss the\ndifference between the words \"announce\" and \"commit.\"\n\"Commit,\" if you look in the dictionary, says\n\"pledge.\" And, thus, the 1990 canon appears to be more\nnarrow under plain --\nQUESTION: Well, the Eighth Circuit did say that\nit was -- that Minnesota's provision is the same as the\nABA canon, right?\nMR. BOPP: It did, Your -- it did, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: And the ABA canon prohibits\ncandidates, judicial candidates, from making statements\nthat commit or appear to commit a candidate.\nMR. BOPP: Yes.\nQUESTION: And that looks very much like the\nPledge or Promise language. I -- I don't know how we\nshould interpret this.\nMR. BOPP: Well, one of the problems, Your\nHonor, is that the January 29th opinion of the Minnesota\nSupreme Court interpreting the Announce Clause adopted the\nEighth Circuit opinion and its interpretations.\nQUESTION: Right.\nMR. BOPP: Unfortunately, the Eighth Circuit had\nconflicting statements about the scope of the\ninterpretation that it was announcing.\nQUESTION: Well, you were -- you appear to be\narguing, in your brief at least, that the Announce Clause\nis unconstitutionally vague.\nMR. BOPP: Yes, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Is that your argument you're making?\nMR. BOPP: Yes, we are.\nQUESTION: But did you make that argument below?\nMR. BOPP: Yes, we did, as to the interpretation\nproffered in the district court, adding the words \"likely\nto come before the Court.\" But where we are now, Your\nHonor, is that the Eighth Circuit sua sponte added other\nglosses to this canon, even though it was not advocated by\nany of the parties.\nQUESTION: You didn't include a vagueness\nchallenge in your petition for certiorari, did you?\nMR. BOPP: Yes, we did.\nQUESTION: Is it in the question on which we\ngranted cert, do you think?\nMR. BOPP: No, but it is encompassed within the\nviolation of the First Amendment that we allege.\nQUESTION: But I wouldn't have thought vagueness\nwas a First Amendment issue.\nMR. BOPP: Well, in the context of First\nAmendment protected speech, a -- something that chills\nFirst Amendment speech, because of -- it is a vague rule,\nand therefore does not provide a bright line necessary for\nthe exercise of that speech, that it constitutes a First\nAmendment violation.\nQUESTION: One of the statements of the Eighth\nCircuit -- and I don't have the citation to the brief; I\nhave the citation to the Federal Third -- 247 F.3d 881.\nIt says that the Announce Clause applies only to\ndiscussion of a candidate's predisposition on issues\nlikely to come before the candidate if elected to office.\nMR. BOPP: That is one of the three\nconstructions.\nQUESTION: If we could -- would you agree that\nthat's perhaps the narrowest of the three constructions?\nI want to find what might be the most likely statement to\nsurvive review and then have you discuss that, because I\ntake it that you would not be -- you would not agree that\neven that is constitutional.\nMR. BOPP: It is not the narrowest, Your Honor,\nbecause it uses the word \"issue.\" There are other\nformulations --\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. BOPP: -- in the Eighth Circuit case where\nthey use the word \"decide a case,\" such as on page 45a of\nthe petition -- the petition appendix. It prevents\ncandidates from, quote, \"implying how they would decide\ncases,\" end of quote. And they also, on page 52a of the\nappendix to the petition, say that, quote -- that the\ncanon, quote, \"applies only to discussions of a\ncandidate's predisposition on issues,\" as you've quoted,\nand then finally concludes on page 53 with the statement\nthat it prohibits candidates, quote, \"only from publicly\nmaking known how they would decide issues.\" So we have\nconflicting interpretations of --\nQUESTION: Well, let's take the -- let's take\nthe last one. I take it, if that were the authoritative\nnarrowing constructing that were before us, you would\ndisagree with its constitutionality.\nMR. BOPP: Yes, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Would you agree that that would be a\nconstitutional standard if it were part of a code of\njudicial ethics that applied to the judge after the judge\nwas on the bench?\nMR. BOPP: No, and -- but I believe that this\ncanon does apply to judges once they are elected and on\nthe bench.\nQUESTION: Well, are judges, after they are on\nthe bench, subject to, all of the same rights that they\nhave before they go on the bench, insofar as making public\ncomments?\nMR. BOPP: No, they may be limited in a number\nof different ways, Your Honor, that are necessary to\nadvance compelling interests.\nQUESTION: Well, why is it that, if an election\nis in July, the State can, under your view, not prohibit\nstatements in June before he's elected, but they can\nprohibit the statements in August, after he's elected?\nMR. BOPP: Well, Your Honor, the First Amendment\napplies -- has its most urgent application in campaigns\nfor election, and it is -- and while both judges and\njudicial candidates may be limited in their speech, it has\nnever been held that simply announcing your views on a\ndisputed legal or political issue constitutes an\nindication of partiality such that would justify, for\ninstance, recusal or disqualification.\nQUESTION: But I thought you said it would be\nokay. Then maybe I didn't understand your answer. I\nthought you said that the kind of limitation that Justice\nKennedy referred to would be all right for sitting judges,\nthat you could prohibit sitting judges from letting their\nviews be known on any controversial issues.\nMR. BOPP: Well, then I misspoke, if that was\nyour understanding.\nQUESTION: Like the incorporation doctrine or\nsubstantive due process and so forth --\nMR. BOPP: Canon 4 --\nQUESTION: -- you think you could prohibit\njudges from discussing those matters.\nMR. BOPP: No. Canon 4 -- and in fact, Canon\n4(b) of the Minnesota canons encourages judges to propose\nchanges in the substantive and procedural law, even\nindividually.\nQUESTION: Sitting judges -- sitting judges run\nfor election. So whatever rights the contender would have\nin an election, I assume that the sitting judge who was\nrunning for reelection would have those same rights, in\nyour view.\nMR. BOPP: We believe that they should.\nQUESTION: Because the sitting judge could not\nbe restricted, could he or she, in a way?\nMR. BOPP: Well, sitting judges are restricted,\nfor instance, from commenting on pending cases that are\npending before them, quite properly. But here we are\ntalking about stating general views about the law.\nQUESTION: So sitting --\nQUESTION: You wouldn't object to candidates\nbeing prohibited from commenting about particular cases\neither, would you?\nMR. BOPP: No, I would not.\nQUESTION: I didn't take your objection to be\nthat you say, you know, that there's a case pending in the\ncourts, if I were appointed, I'll tell you how I would\ndecide that case. You --\nMR. BOPP: We --\nQUESTION: -- wouldn't permit that, would you?\nMR. BOPP: We believe that that can properly\nbe --\nQUESTION: I thought you gave examples, or your\n-- one of the briefs gave examples of commenting on\nspecific decisions that had been rendered by the Minnesota\nSupreme Court, and you said that restraint on that comment\nwas impermissible.\nMR. BOPP: Yes.\nQUESTION: Am I not right?\nMR. BOPP: Yes. That is our position.\nQUESTION: So you're making --\nQUESTION: That was a past case. That was a\ndistinction you're making between past cases and pending\ncases in the court that are likely to come before you if\nyou're elected.\nMR. BOPP: Yes, I -- the First Amendment\nprotects discussion of past cases. However, the Eighth\nCircuit opinion only allows discussion of past cases while\nthe enforcement authorities, specifically the Office of\nLawyers Professional Responsibility, had previously said\nthat you could criticize those opinions.\nQUESTION: Well, supposing that -- supposing\nthat Minnesota -- the Minnesota Supreme Court had\nannounced that its Fourth Amendment was more protective\nthan the federal Fourth Amendment and a candidate running\nfor that court saw that several cases, the evidence had\nbeen suppressed in Minnesota courts, the defendant was\nacquitted, so he said, \"I think we should go back to the\nidea that our Fourth Amendment is the same as the federal\nFourth Amendment.\" Would that be permitted under this\nrule?\nMR. BOPP: Under the Announce Clause?\nQUESTION: Under the Announce Clause.\nMR. BOPP: Not if it's considered implying how\nyou would rule in a future case.\nQUESTION: But do we know that -- do we -- is\nthere any mechanism for getting a clarification? And the\nbig problem in this case is this is a frontal attack, and\nso we have no specific examples. And you can say, \"I\nthink this would fit, and I think that wouldn't fit.\" Is\nthere any mechanism in Minnesota for seeking\nclarification? For example, whether the Minnesota Supreme\nCourt's current rule is, indeed, the ABA's 1990 rule?\nMR. BOPP: You can seek a private advisory\nopinion that is not binding on either the office or the\nboard. And petitioner Wersal sought such an opinion after\nsuit was filed regarding other matters, and they declined\nto provide that advice.\nQUESTION: Mr. Bopp, I would assume your answer\nwould be that if it's too fuzzy for us to understand what\nit means in order to rule upon its constitutionality, it's\nalso too fuzzy for a judicial candidate to know what it\nmeans in order to conform his conduct to it and,\ntherefore, unconstitutional.\nMR. BOPP: Yes, sir, Your Honor, not only to\ncandidates, but this canon binds the family members, the\nsupporters of the candidate. If they say anything that is\nviewed to violate this construction -- this new\nconstruction of this rule, then the candidate, him or\nherself, is subject to discipline or removal from office.\nQUESTION: Well, I still want to make clear your\nposition. Your position is -- is that the judge can,\nafter the judge's election, be disciplined, sanctioned for\ncertain remarks that he could not be sanctioned for before\nthe election. Is that correct?\nMR. BOPP: No, Your Honor, and if I gave you\nthat impression, I apologize.\nQUESTION: In other words, the rule --\nMR. BOPP: I am not --\nQUESTION: -- post and pre-election, the\nrights --\nMR. BOPP: The rule --\nQUESTION: -- to speak are the same.\nMR. BOPP: The rule is the same. But I think\nthe point I was making was that once a judge assumes\noffice, there are restrictions on, for instance, his\nability to discuss a pending case that is not imposed upon\na lawyer that is not involved in the case in any way.\nQUESTION: Well, do you claim --\nMR. BOPP: So then --\nQUESTION: All right. Then your position is\nthat there is a difference as it applies to pending cases\nas to which a sitting judge has to -- to which a sitting\njudge has been assigned.\nMR. BOPP: Yes, there are specific ethical\nQUESTION: And --\nMR. BOPP: -- canons that apply in that.\nQUESTION: And that's all.\nMR. BOPP: And that's appropriate --\nQUESTION: Now --\nMR. BOPP: -- an appropriate limit.\nQUESTION: -- are there limits on what the\ncandidate can say?\nMR. BOPP: Yes. I --\nQUESTION: And those are what?\nMR. BOPP: It's in the realm of Pledges and\nPromises. It would apply to candidates whether they're\nsitting judges or not, and that is that a candidate for\njudicial office shall not pledge or promise certain\nresults in deciding a particular case or issue in a case\nwithout regard to the law or facts of the case.\nQUESTION: Suppose he said, \"There are a lot of\ncriminal cases pending,\" and, to take the Chief Justice's\nhypothetical, \"we've gone too far in interpreting the\nFourth Amendment, and I'm going to be more strict.\" In\nyour view --\nMR. BOPP: I think that's a --\nQUESTION: -- that could be prohibited.\nMR. BOPP: No, that is allowed, Your Honor,\nbecause he's not promising certain results in a particular\ncase. That is, again --\nQUESTION: He says, \"I promise when these cases\ncome before me, this is what I'll do.\"\nMR. BOPP: Then that is a pledge or promise of\nan outcome.\nQUESTION: And in your view, that can be\nprohibited.\nMR. BOPP: Yes, because there is a --\nQUESTION: Well, I'm surprised you take that\nview.\nMR. BOPP: Well, Your Honor, there is a public\nperception of the impartiality of the judiciary that I\nthink properly can be taken into account.\nQUESTION: Well --\nMR. BOPP: And I think this rule announces a\nrule that is consistent with the judge's obligation to\ndecide cases in accordance with his or her role.\nQUESTION: Well, that's an extremely fine line\nyou're drawing, it seems to me, because I think a moment\nago, in response to my question, you said that a candidate\nwould be prohibited, and wrongly prohibited, under your\nview -- on your view of it and from saying that Minnesota\nshould adopt the federal Fourth Amendment standard rather\nthan the more liberal Fourth Amendment standard that the\nSupreme Court of Minnesota hypothetically had it. You say\nthat a candidate ought to be allowed to do that, but he\nisn't under the Minnesota rule?\nMR. BOPP: He is not, under the -- well, to the\nextent that we know what the Announce Clause means --\nQUESTION: Yeah.\nMR. BOPP: -- with this conflicting formulations\nunder the Eighth Circuit opinion, talking about cases or\nissues -- talking about, implying, or making known -- to\nthe extent that we know the rule, it would appear that\nsuch a statement would be prohibited --\nQUESTION: And you --\nMR. BOPP: -- because it would imply what he\nwould rule in the future.\nQUESTION: And you say that the First Amendment\nprohibits that?\nMR. BOPP: No, I'd say the First Amendment\nprotects talking about prior decisions.\nQUESTION: What about --\nMR. BOPP: And one of the problems is we're\ntalking about the rule -- the Minnesota rule versus --\nQUESTION: Yeah.\nMR. BOPP: -- other proposed rules.\nQUESTION: But if --\nQUESTION: What about comment on a -- by a\ncandidate who is not yet a judge on a case which is then\npending before the court? In your view, can the State\nprohibit the candidate from saying, \"I've been reading\nabout this case. I know what the evidence is, and I\nbelieve so and so should be convicted, and I think the\nsentence ought to be the following.\" Could the State,\nconsistently with the First Amendment, prohibit that kind\nof a comment?\nMR. BOPP: Well, there would seem to be, under\nGentile, more leeway for a lawyer not in a pending case to\ndiscuss a pending case.\nQUESTION: What's the answer to my question?\nMR. BOPP: I think -- I think it could not be\nprohibited.\nQUESTION: In the question that the Chief\nJustice asked, suppose the judge said, \"I pledge and\npromise that if you elect me, I will vote in every Fourth\nAmendment case to restore the law to what it was.\" That's\na pledge and a promise, which I thought your argument\nstarted out saying you accept that the pledge or promise\nis a valid restriction --\nMR. BOPP: I do, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: -- that you can't go on that to the\nAnnounce. So suppose that instead of -- the Chief Justice\nsuggested, \"I think it would be a good idea if the court\nwent back there\" -- but if he said, \"I pledge and promise\nthat I will vote that way\" --\nMR. BOPP: That is a classic pledge and promise\nthat I think can be appropriated prohibited under the\nFirst Amendment.\nQUESTION: As to issues and not as to particular\ncases.\nMR. BOPP: As both to issues and cases.\nQUESTION: So that you -- you can't disable\nyourself from being --\nMR. BOPP: Open minded.\nQUESTION: -- persuaded by counsel that the\nviews you've held your whole life over the incorporation\ndoctrine, turn out to be wrong.\nMR. BOPP: Yes. And while judges certainly have\nviews, and they announce these views in numerous different\nways, if they are binding themselves not to have an open\nmind and to decide a case in advance, then that is a\nviolation of the oath, and that type of pledge or promise\nshould be and can be prohibited under the First Amendment.\nQUESTION: Is this different from that? That\nis, I read through the Minnesota Bar Association's brief,\nthe ABA's brief, and portions of the Brennen brief. All\nright? They all suggested to me that this ethical rule,\nlike all ethical rules, is vague, interpreted by\ninterpretive opinions, of which there are many. I mean,\nthere are two pages of them in these briefs.\nNow, as I understood it, it comes down to an\neffort to do just what I did in my own Senate confirmation\nhearing, to say, \"I will try to reveal my judicial\nphilosophy. I will try to stay away from anything that is\ngoing to commit myself or appear to commit myself about\nhow to decide a future case.\" All right.\nMR. BOPP: And I agree.\nQUESTION: Now, if that's what they're trying to\ndo -- do you agree that is what this is trying to do?\nAnd, second, if that is what they're trying to do, why is\nthat unconstitutional?\nMR. BOPP: If it amounts to a pledge or a\npromise --\nQUESTION: No, it doesn't. I used the words\nthat -- of the ABA brief. I've used the words -- I'm\nreferring to the briefs to call those arguments to your\nmind.\nWhat they say this comes down to is you cannot\ncommit yourself or appear to commit yourself as to how you\nwill decide a particular case or issue if it arises. But\nyou can, and there are two pages of this in the Minnesota\nBar brief. I'm just trying to call that to your mind --\nMR. BOPP: Thank you.\nQUESTION: -- of all the things you can discuss:\njudicial philosophy, character, this and that. There were\ntwo pages of them, and they're all quotes -- in quotes.\nAll right. So, one, am I correct in my interpretation?\nMR. BOPP: Yes.\nQUESTION: Two, if I am, why does the\nConstitution forbid it?\nMR. BOPP: If the word \"commit\" means \"pledge,\"\nthen I think you're correct in --\nQUESTION: No, I told you what it means.\n\"Commit\" means \"commit.\" We can't go more than the words\n\"commit\" or \"appear to commit,\" other than to illustrate\nthem by example. And the Bar Association brief contains\n18 examples that have been given. They're all in quotes.\nThey come from an authoritative source. So that's where I\nam in what this means. Am I right? And if I am right,\nwhat's wrong with it?\nMR. BOPP: Well, Your Honor, what is wrong with\nit --\nQUESTION: But first, am I right, in your\nopinion?\nMR. BOPP: you're not right. And what is wrong\nwith it is that the ABA suggested that \"commit\" means the\nsame thing as \"announce.\" And what I -- my course of my\nargument is that \"commit\" means \"pledge,\" and that, to\nthat extent, the ABA canon is different than the current\nAnnounce Clause. In fact, it's --\nQUESTION: All right, so if you're saying the\nword is \"announce,\" and all these briefs and the bar\nassociation are wrong when they say that means commit or\nappear to commit, on that view, what should I do with this\ncase?\nMR. BOPP: You should strike down the Announce\nClause, because it is impossible -- hopelessly impossible\nto know what is included within the rule and what is\noutside the rule. That, and not only did the Eighth\nCircuit use different formulations of the rule that mean\ndifferent things, in terms of its scope and application,\nbut it also had exceptions to the rule, discussion -- a\ngeneral discussion of case law or a candidate's judicial\nphilosophy, but with the proviso that if you imply how you\nwill rule in a particular case, then you have violated the\nrule.\nQUESTION: And on an issue on a particular case.\nMR. BOPP: An issue, including --\nQUESTION: Can I just follow that up for one\nsecond? All right, now take the other assumption. Let's\nassume that it does mean, as the ABA says, \"appear\" or\n\"appear to commit.\" On that view of it -- and assume that\nI'm right. I know you think I'm wrong on that. Assuming\nthat I'm right --\nMR. BOPP: With all due respect.\nQUESTION: -- then is it constitutional, in your\nopinion?\nMR. BOPP: No, because of the \"appear to commit\"\nlanguage.\nQUESTION: So you think the ABA can and is,\nitself, unconstitutional.\nMR. BOPP: As I interpret it, yes, because the\n\"appear to commit\" takes us back away from a bright line\nof a pledge or a promise into the realm of implying what\nyou are saying. And there --\nQUESTION: What is the ABA's position on\njudicial elections?\nMR. BOPP: They are not in favor of judicial --\nQUESTION: I didn't think they were.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: But you're submitting this case to us\non the proposition that, under the First Amendment, a\njudicial candidate can be subjected to restraints on\nspeech that other -- that are inapplicable to other\ncandidates.\nMR. BOPP: I believe that they can, Your Honor,\nbecause judges have a dual role. One role is to make law,\nand particularly state court judges making common law, but\nthey also have a duty to decide cases impartially. So\nwhile they are running for office, in order to respect\njudicial impartiality, they should not be pledging to\nviolate the oath. That is promising now how to decide a\ncase in the future when it comes before --\nQUESTION: Well, how does this play out with\nsitting judges who write opinions saying, \"In my view, for\nexample, I think the death penalty is unconstitutional\"?\nThere it is for everybody to see. And presumably in a\nstate like Minnesota, that judge will come up for election\nagain or in another state for retention election. You\ndon't think it's -- can that be prohibited --\nMR. BOPP: No.\nQUESTION: -- somehow?\nMR. BOPP: No. No, it may not.\nQUESTION: And that judge has expressed a view\nthat presumably the judge will follow in a future case.\nMR. BOPP: But that is -- but that is different\nfrom declaring or announcing that you have a closed mind\nas to any future --\nQUESTION: No. I don't know, if it's thoroughly\nexpressed. Now, if the next case comes along involving\nthat very issue, can the judge be changed for bias?\nMR. BOPP: No. No, you may not be recused, and\ndue process is not violated.\nQUESTION: But what if a candidate says not, \"I\npledge that in every case I will say vote against the\ndeath penalty,\" but, \"I have real doubts about the death\npenalty jurisprudence.\" I mean, I don't think Minnesota\nhas a death penalty, but --\nMR. BOPP: No, it doesn't.\nQUESTION: -- let's assume it does. \"And I\nthink it probably should change.\" Is that permissible\nunder this rule? And if the rule says it's not\npermissible, is that statement protected by the First\nAmendment?\nMR. BOPP: I'm sorry. Under the Minnesota rule\nor my rule?\nQUESTION: Under the Minnesota rule.\nMR. BOPP: It -- well, it's very difficult to\nknow, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Okay, well, under your rule.\nMR. BOPP: Under our rule, it would be allowed.\nAnd, in fact, judges are encouraged to do -- make\nproposals just like that under these canons.\nQUESTION: Now I don't understand what you say\nthe Minnesota rule is. I would have thought your answer\nwould be, \"That's probably okay under the Minnesota\nrules,\" because he only says probably -- \"I think it's\nprobably, you know, unconstitutional.\"\nMR. BOPP: Under the Minnesota rule if you\nsimply imply how you might rule --\nQUESTION: Well, it doesn't. It says, \"I have\ndoubts about it,\" according to the Chief Justice, \"I have\ndoubts about it.\" I think that doesn't necessarily imply\n-- but I thought --\nMR. BOPP: Well, it's --\nQUESTION: I thought --\nMR. BOPP: It's hard to know.\nQUESTION: But I thought that your position with\nregard to judicial opinions is -- is that it is perfectly\nokay for a sitting judge to make known to the public his\nview on something like the death penalty when he does it\nin an opinion and, therefore, that can be out there.\nMR. BOPP: Yes, it is --\nQUESTION: Subject to criticism, indeed.\nMR. BOPP: Yes --\nQUESTION: But somebody who's running against\nhim in an election cannot let be known what his view is on\nthe death penalty.\nMR. BOPP: It is perfectly appropriate for a\njudge to do that in an opinion or in speeches or a law\nreview article.\nQUESTION: In speeches? You mean the judge\ncould go out and -- a sitting judge can go out and make a\nspeech and say, \"In the next death penalty case to come\nbefore me, I'm going to vacate. I'm going to vote to\nvacate the death penalty. I don't care what the argument\nis.\"\nMR. BOPP: Then not that statement. If he made\nthat statement, he'd be subject to recusal and a proper\napplication of --\nQUESTION: Okay, well --\nMR. BOPP: -- the pledge rule.\nQUESTION: Okay. Well, then what he can say in\nspeeches certainly is less than what he can say in a\njudicial opinion in which he says, \"I vote to vacate the\ndeath penalty because I believe it's unconstitutional.\" I\nmean, there's some line between them.\nMR. BOPP: Yes, I would think he would. He\ndoes, Your Honor. And may I reserve the balance of my\ntime?\nQUESTION: Very well. Mr. Gilbert, we'll hear\nfrom you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF ALAN I. GILBERT\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. GILBERT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court: I would like to take the opportunity to\ntry to clarify some of the questions and answers that have\nbeen provided as to what the construed rule in Minnesota\nmeans. And I refer the Court to page 53a, of the cert\npetition appendix, where the Eighth Circuit stated the\ndefinitive narrow construction of this rule which says\nthat the rule only prohibits candidates from --\nQUESTION: Whereabouts on the page?\nMR. GILBERT: The beginning of the second\nparagraph, Your Honor. It only restricts judicial\ncandidates from publicly making known how they would\ndecide issues likely to come before them as judges. That\nis the narrow construction of this Eighth Circuit opinion.\nThat is the construction that's being applied by the two\nboards that I represent, and that is the construction that\nhas been incorporated in an authoritative order by the\nMinnesota Supreme Court.\nQUESTION: What about the example I posed to\nyour opponent? Someone says, \"I think the Minnesota\nSupreme Court's ruling on the Fourth Amendment, the state\nFourth Amendment being broader, is wrong, and I -- if you\nwill elect me as a judge, I would try to change that\naround.\"\nMR. GILBERT: Your Honor, this is where the\nrecord is very clear as to what Mr. Wersal has done. And\nin response to your question, the candidate could\ncriticize a prior decision of a judge, but could not say\nas to a future case how that candidate would decide the\ncase. And that's precisely --\nQUESTION: So let me put that to the test. If I\nsay, \"I think the decision of the Supreme Court of\nMinnesota two years ago saying that the Fourth Amendment\n-- state Fourth Amendment protected more than the federal\nFourth Amendment is wrong,\" he could do that, but he\ncouldn't say, \"If you elect me to the Supreme Court, I\nwould carry out my view.\"\nMR. GILBERT: Well, that would be a future case.\nAnd there's other considerations --\nQUESTION: Well, he told me he couldn't even\nsay, \"I think that opinion is wrong. And that is not my\nposition concerning the meaning of the Fourth\nAmendment\" --\nMR. GILBERT: Your Honor --\nQUESTION: -- \"in Minnesota.\"\nMR. GILBERT: That's not correct, Your Honor.\nrefer you to the record in this case and what Mr. Wersal\nhas said in his literature. If you look at the first\nvolume of the Joint Appendix, pages 34 to 38, as well as\npages 86 to 91, they contain the actual statements that\nMr. Wersal made as part of his campaign.\nQUESTION: What pages?\nMR. GILBERT: 30 -- let's see -- 34 to 38, and\n86 to 91. And look what he said. First of all, he talked\nabout his judicial philosophy. He has said that he can't\ntalk about his judicial philosophy. He did. He said,\n\"I'm a strict constructionist,\" and he criticized the\nMinnesota Supreme Court for being a judicial activist.\nBut more --\nQUESTION: What does that mean? I mean, that's\nso fuzzy, that doesn't mean --\nMR. GILBERT: Well, but --\nQUESTION: -- that doesn't mean anything. It\ndoesn't say whether you're going adopt the incorporation\ndoctrine, whether you believe in substantive due process.\nIt is totally imprecise. It's just nothing but fluff.\nMR. GILBERT: And candidates can say that. And\nthat's the point.\nQUESTION: Can they say anything more than\nfluff?\nQUESTION: Can they say anything that has any\nmeaning?\nMR. GILBERT: Absolutely. And what they can do\n-- look at what Mr. Wersal --\nQUESTION: But what about my example?\nMR. GILBERT: Your example, Your Honor, the\ncandidate can, as Mr. Wersal did, criticize a prior\ndecision of the Court. And that's very clear from what\nhas happened in the Wersal case. What the candidate\ncannot do is say that, \"If I'm elected, I'm going to\noverturn that decision.\"\nQUESTION: Does that dichotomy make any sense at\nall?\nMR. GILBERT: Well, it does in the sense, Your\nHonor, that there's different dynamics involved once a\njudge is elected and has to overturn a decision that's\nalready precedent in the State of Minnesota.\nQUESTION: So a candidate says, \"This is the\nworst decision that's come down since Dred Scott, it's a\nplague on our people, it's an insult to the system, but\nI'm not telling you how I'll vote.\"\n(Laughter.)\nMR. GILBERT: Your Honor, that's the point.\nQUESTION: It's more than that. You assert that\nthat does not, within the language that the Supreme Court\nhas adopted, it does not imply how he will vote on that\nissue at a future date. He says, \"It's the worst case\nwe've ever done.\" That doesn't imply how he's going to\nvote on it?\nMR. GILBERT: Well, that might well imply\nwhether he's going to overturn it. But what the candidate\ncan say and what Mr. Wersal said -- if you look at the\ncriticism that he leveled at these decisions of the\nMinnesota Supreme Court, he said just as you indicated,\nJustice, that, \"These decisions are\" --\nQUESTION: What are you reading? Where are you\nreading from?\nMR. GILBERT: If you look at pages -- page 36,\nfor example, of the -- this is of the Joint Appendix -- he\nsays, on abortion, \"The Court ordered the State must use\nwelfare funds to pay for abortion despite state law to the\ncontrary. The dissenting judge remarked,\" et cetera.\nThis is under the topic of \"Examples of Judicial\nActivism.\" But then he goes into greater detail on page\n38.\nQUESTION: But is the statement at page 36 that\nyou read -- is that proscribable under the State's rule?\nMR. GILBERT: No. And that's the point. What\nhas happened here, Your Honor, is that there was a\ncomplaint filed against Mr. Wersal for all of this\ncampaign material. And the then-director of the Lawyers\nBoard, Marcia Johnson, in an opinion, on pages 20 and 21\nof this appendix, said that the statements made by Mr.\nWersal are not proscribable. And that's even before the\nrule is narrowed.\nAnd if you look at page 21, the executive\ndirector said specifically that Mr. Wersal can criticize\nprior decisions of the Court. And that's consistent with\nwhat the Board on Judicial Standards did in --\nQUESTION: What do you say --\nQUESTION: May he also, at the same time as they\ncriticized the decision, say, \"I do not believe in stare\ndecisis\"?\nMR. GILBERT: Yes. He can't, because that\nis --\nQUESTION: Well, then isn't he saying how he's\ngoing to rule on the case then?\nMR. GILBERT: Well, Your Honor -- it might be,\nYour Honor. People might be able to imply from it, but\nit's still -- the distinction is --\nQUESTION: Might be able to imply that I don't\nbelieve in stare decisis and I think this case is wrong.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: Pretty clear, I think.\nMR. GILBERT: No, and I understand what you're\nsaying, Your Honor. The distinction that's made, if you\nlook at all the cases that have dealt with this issue, is\na distinction between past cases on one hand and then\npending and future cases on another.\nQUESTION: As long as you're silent on your\nviews on stare decisis, that's a fine distinction. But if\nyou do reveal your views on stare decisis, that\ndistinction is meaningless.\nMR. GILBERT: Perhaps. There could be other\nissues that come up in terms of a case that would be a\nvehicle to overturn particular decisions -- standing,\nthings of that kind.\nQUESTION: So now you're saying there's a\ndistinction between issues and cases. And I'm saying\nyou're categorically stating your view about a particular\nissue, as the Chief Justice's example states, and you also\ncategorically state, \"I think stare decisis has no place\nin constitutional adjudication.\" Can he do that?\nMR. GILBERT: Your Honor, again, the -- no,\nunder the State's interpretation of the rule. And I\nunderstand your point. It is a fine distinction. But\nwhat the State is trying to do is protect the integrity of\nthe judiciary at that point. And to the extent --\nQUESTION: This protects its integrity?\nMR. GILBERT: Your Honor, we think so. And the\nreason for that is that --\nQUESTION: I mean, it's just a game. It's just\na dance, you know --\nMR. GILBERT: Well, this is --\nQUESTION: -- I don't say anything about stare\ndecisis and it's okay. If I say something about stare\ndecisis, it's not okay?\nMR. GILBERT: Well, again, Your Honor, I\nunderstand the hypothetical. This is a hypothetical that\nis kind of on the fringe. I would agree with you. But at\nthe same time, most of the situations are going to be\nclear, are going to be --\nQUESTION: Well, it is such a problem to know\nexactly what the provision covers now. It isn't clear to\nme. And what we end up with at the end of the day is a\nsystem where an incumbent judge can express views in\nwritten opinions, and perhaps otherwise, as well, and yet\na candidate for that office is somehow restricted from\ndiscussing the very same thing in the election campaign.\nThat's kind of an odd system, designed to what? Maintain\nincumbent judges, or what?\nMR. GILBERT: No, it's not, Your Honor. In\nfact, that is not correct in terms of the effect of that\nsituation. Again, if you look at page 20 of the Joint\nAppendix, what the executive director of the Lawyers Board\nhas said is that an incumbent judge can criticize the\nprior decision of that sitting judge. So that the\nchallenger actually has greater opportunity than an\nincumbent judge, because an incumbent judge has a record\nof decisions.\nQUESTION: Do you -- you misspoke, I think. You\nmeant the challenger --\nQUESTION: You did --\nMR. GILBERT: The challenger. I'm sorry.\nQUESTION: -- the challenger, who is not a\njudge, can criticize the specific decision of the judge\nwho wrote it.\nMR. GILBERT: That's correct, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: So they're equally free at the least\nto discuss the specific past cases.\nMR. GILBERT: At the least. And I would submit\nthat the challenger is in a better situation because of\nthe --\nQUESTION: All right. Can I ask you this\nquestion --\nMR. GILBERT: Yes.\nQUESTION: -- because I understand that -- I\nhave two questions, really. One is the line that's being\n-- that you're trying to draw, everyone would concede is a\nvery difficult one to draw, but it is the line that I\ntried to draw.\nMR. GILBERT: Yes.\nQUESTION: Now, what would happen if, instead of\nmy being in the Senate, I had been in an election\ncampaign, and I was trying to draw this very line between\ncommitments to future cases, specific ones, and general\njudicial philosophy. And suppose my opponent, after,\nsaid, \"Breyer made a mistake. He didn't get it right,\"\nbut I was in good faith. What could happen, or would\nlikely happen, to me under this rule?\nMR. GILBERT: As a -- I'm sorry, as a sitting\njudge, Your Honor?\nQUESTION: Well, I then -- suppose I won. Fine.\nI've won the election. My opponent -- what I'm trying to\nunderstand is what are the consequences? It is, after\nall, an ethical rule, and ethical rules are often blurry.\nMR. GILBERT: Yes.\nQUESTION: And I want to know what would likely\nhappen to a person who makes a mistake in drawing this\nvery fine line, assuming that it's in good faith.\nMR. GILBERT: Your Honor, the Board on Judicial\nStandards or the Lawyers Board would have jurisdiction\nwith respect to a violation which sounds like a technical\nviolation, as you describe it, and could impose some\ndiscipline, but I would suspect that discipline would be\nvery minute, if at all --\nQUESTION: Could a state --\nMR. GILBERT: -- under those circumstances.\nQUESTION: -- make a violation of the provisions\nyou described a criminal offense?\nMR. GILBERT: No, Your Honor. These are not\ncriminal statues.\nQUESTION: But could a state do it under the\nFirst Amendment? Is there any authority you have for the\nproposition, that can -- a state can impose a civil\nsanction, but not a criminal sanction?\nMR. GILBERT: I'm not aware of any authority\nthat would allow a criminal sanction for such a thing.\nQUESTION: Can I ask you one other question?\nQUESTION: That's not my question. Is there any\nauthority that a state, under the First Amendment, is free\nto impose a civil sanction but not a criminal sanction on\nparticular speech?\nMR. GILBERT: I'm not aware of authority to that\neffect either, no.\nQUESTION: This is a technical question, but the\nsentence you started out reading from the Eighth Circuit's\nopinion is not identical to the ABA canon. And obviously\nif this rule differs from the ABA canon and is stricter,\none could say there's a less restrictive alternative,\nnamely the ABA canon. And so I'm quite concerned about\nhow to deal with that problem. Do I assume that, in fact,\nMinnesota does mean it's indistinguishable from ABA canon,\nwhich is what the ABA says? Or what your opponent says?\nHow do I deal with that?\nMR. GILBERT: Your Honor, our position is, just\nas the ABA indicated, that our rule is the functional\nequivalent of a commitment clause.\nQUESTION: The Minnesota Supreme Court turned\ndown the ABA rule, the ABA rule -- we're talking --\nthey're both ABA rules. Minnesota now has on its books\nthe 1972 rule. The 1990 rule is the one that you said is\nthe functional equivalent of the current rule. And yet\nthe Minnesota Supreme Court considered and turned down\nthat rule. So that's one of the aspects of this case that\nmakes it very fuzzy. The court that turned it down now\nsays, \"We agree with the Eighth Circuit.\" And you're\ntelling us that the Eighth Circuit has adopted,\nessentially, the ABA's current rule.\nMR. GILBERT: Yes, Your Honor, and that is the\ncase, and you are right. Back in 1995, there was\ndiscussion of adoption of the commit clause by the\nMinnesota Supreme Court. It did not occur at that time.\nThere has been a lot that has evolved over the last seven\nyears, Your Honor, and the Minnesota Supreme Court has\nmade the decision in its January 29th, 2002, order that\nthis construction by the Eighth Circuit is the\nconstruction that they are going to place on their clause.\nQUESTION: Whatever that is.\nMR. GILBERT: Well, this construction, Your\nHonor, is, for all practical purposes, identical to the\ncommitment clause. And --\nQUESTION: Mr. Gilbert, may I ask --\nMR. GILBERT: Yes.\nQUESTION: -- a question based on what you said\nabout stare decisis? You say -- have said consistently\nyou can discuss your judicial philosophy. Well, why\nwouldn't one's position on stare decisis fall under\njudicial philosophy?\nMR. GILBERT: I think it would, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: So that -- so you're changing back\nthen, because you said a while ago that stare decisis --\nif you said, \"I think that decision about the Fourth\nAmendment was wrong, and I don't believe in stare\ndecisis,\" you said you couldn't put those two together.\nMR. GILBERT: Your Honor, you can put them\ntogether. I think the question was, could someone then\nconclude from that what the ramifications would be if that\nparticular candidate came to the Supreme Court, for\nexample, on what the candidate would do with respect to\nthat decision -- whether the candidate would overturn or\nnot.\nQUESTION: And your answer was it would imply\nhow he's going to vote and, therefore, would not be --\nMR. GILBERT: Again --\nQUESTION: -- would not be acceptable, right?\nMR. GILBERT: Yes, Your Honor, with the\ndistinction being to protect the integrity of the\njudiciary.\nQUESTION: Well, let me ask about that. You\nknow, in evaluating whether a state has demonstrated the\nkind of significant interest necessary to abridge speech,\nit seems to me we have to look at the entirety of the\nstate law to see what interest it's pursuing.\nI, frankly, am absolutely befuddled by the fact\nthat Minnesota wants its judges elected -- that's its\nconstitutional provision -- and then enacts statutory\nprovisions that are intended to prevent the electorate\nfrom knowing, even by implication, how these candidates\nare going to behave when they get on the bench. It seems\nto me a total contradiction. And, indeed, it looks to me\nlike a legislative attempt to simply repeal Minnesota's\nconstitutional provision providing for the election of\njudges, which is a neat and easy way to get rid of it if\nyou can't do it by plebiscite.\nWhy does it make any sense to vote for a judge\nin an election, a judge who is not able, even by\nimplication, to tell the electorate what kind of a judge\nhe would be?\nMR. GILBERT: Well, but, Your Honor, that's the\nfallacy in that statement, is that a candidate can tell\nthe electorate what kind of candidate they are. The only\nthing that the candidate cannot say -- it's a very limited\nrestriction -- and that is, how I am going to decide a\nfuture case.\nQUESTION: Not a particular -- well, no, not\njust a future case, a future issue -- any, not a\nparticular case, but any issue --\nMR. GILBERT: And --\nQUESTION: -- how I will vote on the Fourth\nAmendment situation, how I will vote on the incorporation\ndoctrine. I can understand your saying, he shall not\ncommit himself, \"I promise to vote this way.\" No judge\nshould do that. He should be able to be persuaded that\nhe's been wrong. But to say that my current view is that\nthe Fourth Amendment should be just like the federal\nFourth Amendment, and stare decisis in constitutional\nmatters is not a doctrine that I think is very strong --\nit seems to me you ought to be able to say that.\nMR. GILBERT: And they can say that. I think\nthe difference of opinion we have here is whether they can\ngo the extra step and just say, \"And I would try to\noverturn the decision if I'm elected.\"\nQUESTION: Well, if that --\nMR. GILBERT: I have to --\nQUESTION: -- if that indicates a\ndisqualification or a lack of temperament for the bench,\nthe voters can decide that. The bar association and the\njudges can come out and say, \"We have a candidate running\nwho doesn't have the right judicial temperament,\" and the\nvoters decide. That's the way elections work.\nMR. GILBERT: They can do that, but I submit to\nyou, what happens if that judge wins? What happens if\nthat judge wins and the litigants come before that judge\nwho has prejudged that case?\nQUESTION: Well, I suppose the people have said\nwhat kind of judges they want.\nMR. GILBERT: Oh, and it's all of a sudden\nmajority opinion?\nQUESTION: Why is that any worse than litigants\nwho come before a judge who's already sitting and who has\nsaid in a prior opinion that he thinks the Fourth\nAmendment in Minnesota should be interpreted the same way\nthe federal Fourth Amendment is? Why --\nMR. GILBERT: Because in --\nQUESTION: -- is that any different?\nMR. GILBERT: Because in a prior opinion, due\nprocess was accorded, because the judge actually heard the\nargument of the litigants, heard the facts and the\napplicable law.\nQUESTION: You mean a judge can't have an\nopinion without hearing from all sides and going in briefs\nand so forth?\nMR. GILBERT: Absolutely.\nQUESTION: Well, what if -- even if he gives a\nspeech, does he have to first have this sort of vetting?\nMR. GILBERT: Not at all, Your Honor. The only\n-- again, the limited restriction here is that the -- a\njudge cannot -- I'm sorry -- a judicial candidate cannot\nprejudge a future case, cannot say, \"I think this statute\nover here is unconstitutional,\" or, \"I think, in consumer\nfraud cases, that anybody who wins is entitled to punitive\ndamages.\"\nQUESTION: So you don't trust the electorate in\nMinnesota to decide whether a judge has a judicial\ntemperament. You wish us to depart from the usual\nphilosophy --\nMR. GILBERT: Again --\nQUESTION: -- that we do not allow the State to\npresume that the public is better off not having complete\ninformation.\nMR. GILBERT: Well --\nQUESTION: Maybe we should know about this\njudge's temperament. And if he spouts off on all sorts of\nissues, we say, this is not the kind of judge we want.\nMR. GILBERT: Your Honor, again, this is a\nbalance that's being struck. There's competing interests\nhere. There's the First Amendment interest that we're all\nfamiliar with. There's the due process interest of\nindividual litigants. There's the compelling governmental\ninterests that the State has in ensuring the integrity of\nthe judiciary, both in terms of the actual integrity and\nthe perception of it. And that's why this limited\nrestriction is appropriate.\nQUESTION: Maybe you shouldn't have judicial\nelections if the last is a significant State interest.\nMR. GILBERT: Well, Your Honor, that's --\nQUESTION: To the degree that you're making it a\nsignificant State interest here. See, I just question\nwhether it is a significant State interest, because you\nhave a constitution that says, \"We're going to have\njudicial elections.\" Now, that may be a very bad idea,\nbut as long as that's in your constitution, I find it hard\nto believe that it is a significant State interest of\nMinnesota to prevent elections from being informed.\nMR. GILBERT: Well, again, Your Honor, we're\ntrying to weigh the different interests. I am sure you\nwouldn't suggest that the State doesn't have a compelling\ninterest in the integrity of the judiciary, and that is a\ncompeting interest that is being weighed here, and that\nresults in the commitment clause that the ABA has adopted\nand the parallel provision that has been construed\nnarrowly by the Eighth Circuit, which, again, only forbids\nor prohibits a judge saying, \"I'm going to decide this\nparticular issue this way in the future.\"\nQUESTION: So you're saying the public doesn't\nknow enough in order to determine whether a judge has the\nrequisite qualifications for office.\nMR. GILBERT: Your Honor, I'm not saying that\nthe public knows or doesn't know. The concern is what\nhappens if that candidate is elected, and then you or any\nother litigant comes before that candidate, who is now a\njudge, and tries to litigate the issue that the judge has\nalready prejudged.\nQUESTION: Well --\nMR. GILBERT: How fair is that?\nQUESTION: My goodness, we -- I think we have\n-- I will say present company excluded -- I know we have\nhad judges on this Court who have answered questions about\nparticular legal issues to the Senate confirmation\nhearing. Are you saying that those judges were\ndisqualified from sitting in cases in which that issue\nwould later come up?\nMR. GILBERT: No, Your Honor, I'm not. And\nactually, I'm surprised to hear that.\nQUESTION: Is it -- oh. It's --\nMR. GILBERT: I am surprised to hear that, in\nlight of the testimony that is in our brief and other\nbriefs --\nQUESTION: You should go before the Senate\n(Laughter.)\nMR. GILBERT: But, Your Honor --\nQUESTION: I actually found that when they\napproached a particular case about how you were going to\ndecide in the future, both the senators -- in my\nexperience, since it only concerns me -- would not press\nthe issue of how you would decide a particular case.\nQUESTION: I'm not talking about --\nQUESTION: And that's why -- a particular case.\nQUESTION: I was -- my reference was to a\nparticular issue. A particular issue.\nMR. GILBERT: Your Honor, cases are made up of\nissues. And sometimes a case only has one issue. Issues\nare important in and of themselves.\nQUESTION: Mr. Gilbert, do you think we should\ndraw any distinction, or whether it would be reasonable\nfor us to draw any distinction, between the application of\nthe rule to the candidates themselves and the application\nof the rule to all of these ancillary individuals around\nthem -- their associates, their families? Let's assume\nthat we say that the rule passes muster with respect to\nthe candidate. What's the justification for muzzling the\ncandidate's spouse? I mean, I know, in fact, what --\nMR. GILBERT: Yeah.\nQUESTION: -- it is, because we figure, you\nknow, that's how you get the message out. But do we have\na more difficult First Amendment hurdle?\nMR. GILBERT: Your Honor, I don't think so, not\nat all. I think it's really a misnomer to talk about\nmuzzling, which is what the petitioners have indicated.\nQUESTION: Let's say \"limiting.\"\nMR. GILBERT: Well, it's not even that. What\nthe rule does is ask the judicial candidate to encourage\nclose family members not to effectively circumvent the\nrule by announcing views that they might be aware of that\nthe judicial candidate would support.\nQUESTION: But if the family member says, \"Well,\nI'm going to tell anyway.\"\nMR. GILBERT: \"I'm going to tell anyway\" --\nthere's no penalty.\nQUESTION: But the --\nMR. GILBERT: There's no --\nQUESTION: But there could be. Do I understand\nthat there would be an inquiry in that event as to whether\nthe candidate had, indeed, encouraged the family member to\nbe quiet?\nMR. GILBERT: Your Honor, the standard is\n\"knowingly permit.\" So, in other words, some -- the\njudicial candidate would actually have to be the actor\nbehind those actions.\nQUESTION: All right, but I want to know, in\npractical terms, what happens. The spouse makes a\nstatement -- any one of the statements that have been\nmentioned here, except as suggesting prejudgment of a\ncase. The candidate stays mute. I presume that a\ncomplaint would be filed against the candidate, and I\npresume the candidate would have to answer to the\ncommission as to whether the candidate had, indeed,\nknowingly encouraged this.\nMR. GILBERT: Your Honor, I'd assume a complaint\nwould not be filed under those circumstances.\nQUESTION: Why not? I mean --\nMR. GILBERT: Well, I don't --\nQUESTION: Are your opponents forgiving in your\nstate?\nMR. GILBERT: Pardon me?\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: I mean, are opponents just forgiving\nof their opponents in your state?\nMR. GILBERT: Well, Your Honor, it's a very\ndifficult standard to satisfy, \"knowingly permit.\"\nQUESTION: Well, maybe it's difficult to\nsatisfy. I'm just trying to get a sense of what the\nburden on the individuals involved is.\nMR. GILBERT: Well --\nQUESTION: And I assume that there could be a\ncomplaint, simply based on the emphatic statement of the\nspouse. And my question is, does the candidate have to\nshow, in that event, that he did not knowingly encourage,\nor does the State have to show -- or the prosecutor or\nwhoever it is -- that he knowingly did encourage. What's\nthe drill?\nMR. GILBERT: Yes, of course, the burden's on\nthe State. And not only is it on the State, but the State\nwould have to show by clear and convincing evidence.\nQUESTION: Okay.\nMR. GILBERT: And the --\nQUESTION: But the candidate would have to\nanswer.\nMR. GILBERT: The -- possibly. The Lawyers\nBoard --\nQUESTION: Why not?\nMR. GILBERT: -- sometimes doesn't investigate\ncomplaints where they don't have sufficient evidence to\nthink there's even a basis for the complaint.\nQUESTION: Well, would they have sufficient\nevidence in the event that a spouse made an emphatic\nstatement saying, \"His view is,\" or \"Her view is\"?\nMR. GILBERT: Yeah, it's conceivable, Your\nHonor, but, again --\nQUESTION: Counsel, is that -- is that part of\nthe canon part of the question in this case? I know it's\npart of the canon. I didn't understand that it was\npresented to us in the petition. What's your view?\nMR. GILBERT: Your Honor, it's kind of oblique.\nThe focus is on Mr. Wersal's comments. And then there are\nother comments. And I think one of the justices mentioned\na vagueness challenge. To the extent there's any\nvagueness challenge at all that was discussed at the\nEighth Circuit and is part of the petition, it deals with\nthese third parties and the phase \"knowingly permit.\" And\nthe issue --\nQUESTION: Because we didn't have the\ninterpretation that was later adopted --\nMR. GILBERT: Right.\nQUESTION: -- by the Eighth Circuit. What\nCounsel says is that the new vagueness issues that he's\nraising are a consequence of the opinion which your\nSupreme Court has adopted, the Eighth Circuit's opinion.\nMR. GILBERT: Well, we -- Your Honor, you're\ncorrect. However, the Eighth Circuit opinion is the\nopinion that's being appealed here. And what the\npetitioners have done is, they have refused to acknowledge\nthat narrow construction. And the fact of the matter is\nthat the Minnesota Supreme Court has now authoritatively\nadopted that as a state court construction. But the fact\nof the matter is, as well, that the Eighth Circuit already\nopined on what the standard is, and that issue was not\nraised by them, in terms of vagueness. It simply was not\nraised.\nQUESTION: Was not raised where?\nMR. GILBERT: In the petition.\nQUESTION: In the petition. The petition is\nwhether it's, it unconstitutionally impinges on the\nfreedom of speech. And one of the principles of freedom\nof speech is that you cannot -- you cannot chill speech by\nhaving a prohibition that is not clear. I don't think\nthat this is a separate issue from the First Amendment\nissue at all.\nMR. GILBERT: Well, they have not --\nQUESTION: We have lots of cases like that,\nabout chilling speech because it's not clear what the\ncoverage of the prohibition is.\nMR. GILBERT: Your Honor, in their petition,\nthough, they have not made those kinds of arguments\nspecifically as to --\nQUESTION: They certainly did in the reply\nbrief.\nMR. GILBERT: They have in the reply brief, but\nnot in the petition, which was the question that was asked\npreviously. And as to vagueness, I should say that this\ncourt has been really clear in the Broadrick v. Oklahoma\ncase, for example, and the Colton v. Kentucky case, that\nsometimes rules and statutes -- and, frankly, all the\ntime, rules and statutes are not conducive to mathematical\nprecision, that there are going to be, as the Court has\nsaid, germs of uncertainty in how these laws are applied.\nAnd these laws are going to be applied based upon facts\nand circumstances. And in this particular case, I think\nit's really significant that we don't have any facts and\ncircumstances as to what Mr. Wersal wants to say.\nQUESTION: Well, I think you could set up a\nsystem where you get advisory opinions, but I don't know\nthat we've ever allowed that to be done in the First\nAmendment area.\nMR. GILBERT: Oh --\nQUESTION: \"Please may I say this?\" You know,\nyou submit what you want to say, and somebody tells you,\n\"Yeah, okay. You can say that.\" That's certainly\ncontrary to our approach to the First Amendment.\nMR. GILBERT: Well, Your Honor, I don't -- Your\nHonor, first of all, I'm not a proponent of what -- of\nthat. But in Letter Carriers, that was a critical\nconsideration in upholding the Hatch Act against\nconstitutional attack, because there was the ability of\npeople who had questions about the application of the\nstatute to actually go to an advisory board and get an\nopinion.\nSimilarly here, both of the boards that are\nparties to this case do provide advisory opinions, and\nthey provide them on short notice, as well. So there is\nthat mechanism. I'm not suggesting it's a substitute, but\nit is a consideration in terms of if there is a close\nquestion on an issue and someone wants some assurance as\nto how that particular situation would be interpreted,\nthey can go to the boards and ask that question.\nQUESTION: Well, how soon can you get something\nfrom the board? If somebody wants to give a speech in a\npolitical campaign, I assume you can't get a 12-hour\nruling from the board.\nMR. GILBERT: Well, they actually do advisory\nopinions over the phone, Your Honor, on very short order,\nand they could do it in a matter of hours or days,\ndepending upon what the needs are.\nQUESTION: Mr. Gilbert, you brought out that\nthis is not just a question of the candidate informing the\nvoter, that behind all of this is a litigant who's going\nto be in a future case. How does it work in Minnesota?\nSuppose, to take an example that Mr. Bopp provided in his\nbrief, the judge -- or the candidate is campaigning \"Tough\non Drunk Driving.\" And then I'm a drunk driver, and I\ncome before this judge, now elected, and I say, I want him\nto recuse, he said he's tough on drunk driving.\nMR. GILBERT: Are you asking in the --\nQUESTION: Would there be, under Minnesota law,\na grounds to say, \"I don't want that judge, because he's\nannounced in the election that he's tough on drunk\ndriving\"?\nMR. GILBERT: No, I don't think so, Your Honor,\nnot under those circumstances.\nOne distinction I would like to make here -- oh,\nI'm sorry, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Gilbert. Mr. Bopp,\nyou have three minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES BOPP, JR.,\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. BOPP: Your Honor, I don't think this is a\nmatter of mathematical precision. The State brief,\nitself, states two different formulations of the rule.\nThey say, quote, \"It is clear that the clause applies to\nstatements about how they would decide, quote, issues, end\nof quote, on pages 1 and 47. And then they say it is,\nquote, \"clear,\" end of quote, that the announced clause\napplies to statements about cases. And that is on pages\n12 and 37. The rule is not even clear in terms of the\nState's own formulation of its scope.\nSecondly, as the Joint Appendix indicates on\npages 111 through 123, announcing your views also includes\nsimply answering questions on radio interviews or after\nspeeches. It is hardly a remedy for a candidate to call\nup the board or the office for an oral opinion which is\nnot binding on them about whether or not they can answer a\nquestion on the radio.\nAnd, finally, it is undisputed that the people\nof Minnesota want an impartial judiciary. Governor Arnie\nCarlson, at Joint Appendix page 247, said -- who's a\nState's witness -- that people do not want judges who are\npre-committed. Thus, candidates who would make excessive\nstatements, who would appear to be partial, risk defeat at\nthe polls in Minnesota. Thus, the people can be trusted\nto make the decisions that they, themselves, have\nconferred upon themselves, as long as they have the\ninformation they need to make that choice. The First\nAmendment guarantees that they should receive that\ninformation, which the Announce Clause both prohibits and\nchills. It is, therefore, unconstitutional.\nQUESTION: Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr. Bopp.\n"
