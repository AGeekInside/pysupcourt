SHANMUGAM\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. SHANMUGAM: Thank you,\nMr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:\nIn Michigan v. Summers, this Court\nestablished a categorical exception to the default\nFourth Amendment requirement of probable cause.\nUnder Summers, officers executing a search\nwarrant for contraband may detain individuals they\nencounter at the scene while they are in the course of\nexecuting the warrant.\nThis case presents the question whether the\nSummers exception also permits officers to detain\nindividuals who have left the scene before the warrant\nis executed. Because individuals who have left the\nscene do not pose an immediate threat to the safe and\nefficient completion of the search, the court of appeals\nerred by permitting their detention absent probable\ncause or even individualized suspicion. Its judgment\nshould therefore be reversed.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, the two tests,\nyours seem to be the immediate vicinity test, and the\nSecond Circuit is as soon as practical test. Your\nadversaries point out that the Second Circuit test\nactually focuses on the police officer's conduct, which\nshould be the focus of reasonableness or\nunreasonableness. Your test just creates an artificial\nline that is subject to as much play as the other. Why\nisn't the focus on police conduct the right focus?\nMR. SHANMUGAM: Well, let me explain,\nJustice Sotomayor, first, the sort of theoretical basis\nfor why we're offering this line, and, second, say a\nword about the comparative merits of the two tests.\nFirst of all, with regard to the theoretical\nbasis for the line, our fundamental submission to this\nCourt is that Summers does not create a police\nentitlement; it is instead a rule of necessity and\nshould be confined to situations in which a detention\nserves search-related purposes.\nAnd in our view, the justifications for a\ndetention evaporate once an individual has left the\nimmediate vicinity of the premises. And, again, that's\nbecause in those circumstances a detention serves no\ninterest in ensuring the safe and efficient completion\nof the search because the individual poses no immediate\nthreat to the safe and efficient completion of the\nsearch.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: And what is the immediate\nvicinity? How would you define that?\nMR. SHANMUGAM: Well, ordinarily, the\nimmediate vicinity will be the physical bounds of the\nproperty; but, there may be circumstances in which an\nindividual who is just outside the physical bounds of\nthe property should nevertheless be detained, so to\nprovide --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: May be? There certainly\nis. I mean, that was Summers, wasn't it?\nMR. SHANMUGAM: Well, in Summers itself, the\nindividual was on the premises just outside the house\nthat was going to be searched, and the officers were, in\nthe government's words in that case, approaching the\nproperty.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes. He wasn't on the\npremises, he was on the sidewalk, right?\nMR. SHANMUGAM: Well, he was actually on --\nhe was on the property because he was on a sidewalk that\nconnected the front steps to the public sidewalk in\nfront of the house. The officers were approaching the\nhouse, about to effectuate entry.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: He was in the curtilage of\nthe house.\nMR. SHANMUGAM: He was pretty clearly within\nthe curtilage, Justice Scalia.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You said the\ndifference is there's no immediate threat to the\nofficers here. But there is a threat, I suppose, I\nmean, if he finds out about the search and comes back,\nif he sees the officers outside his dwelling, if there's\nsomebody in the dwelling who can notify him, send him a\nmessage that the police are searching and he can get his\nconfederates and come back.\nIt seems to me that you're requiring that\nthere be a larger number of police present at the site\nconducting the search, being lookouts for anybody that\nmight come back, being able to detain people who are\nleaving as they approach. There's no immediate threat,\nbut there's certainly a threat.\nMR. SHANMUGAM: If anything, it's the\ngovernment's approach that requires a greater number of\nofficers at the site because, under the government's\napproach, you have the two officers who conduct the\ndetention while a separate group of officers execute the\nsearch.\nAnd it's really for that reason,\nJustice Scalia --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, it requires\nmore unless they want the guy to get away, I guess,\nright?\nMR. SHANMUGAM: Well, let me say something\nabout this prospect that the individual will return. We\nthink that the appropriate analysis here is the analysis\nthat this Court set out in Arizona v. Gant.\nAnd this Court, in Arizona v. Gant,\nsuggested that where a categorical rule is involved, you\nhave to look at the class of cases to which the rule\nwould be extended to see if the justifications apply.\nNow, with regard to this class of\nindividuals who have left the scene, we believe that it\nis simply unlikely either that such an individual who\nhas left the scene will be aware of the presence of\npolice, or that such an individual will return in an\neffort to disrupt the search.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Well, what if he were aware,\nor what if there was reason to think he might be aware,\nwould you then allow the police to do what the police\ndid here?\nMR. SHANMUGAM: Well, we wouldn't. And\nthat's simply because we believe that this should be a\ncategorical analysis.\nAnd so, again, you're looking at this entire\nclass of cases where individuals have left the scene to\ndetermine whether the justifications for the Summers\nrule apply.\nNow, let me provide a --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: If -- if you think that\nleaving the scene -- in Justice Kagan's hypothetical,\nthat he's leaving the scene with incriminating evidence,\nat that point you have -- you have a Terry stop? And\nhe's right at the scene; he's just leaving the premises,\nat the end of the driveway or something?\nMR. SHANMUGAM: Well, the analysis under\nTerry is whether there is reasonable suspicion, a\nreasonable basis to believe that the individual is\nengaged in criminal activity --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: What would you think\ngenerally in my hypothetical? There'd be hundreds of\nother facts, but --\nMR. SHANMUGAM: Well, ordinarily, when an\nindividual is seen leaving the scene -- and suppose --\nlet me provide --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Just -- just before the\nsearch, yes.\nMR. SHANMUGAM: Well, of course, the\nindividual who is leaving the scene doesn't necessarily\nknow that the search is about to take place.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Right.\nMR. SHANMUGAM: And so, to provide a\nhypothetical that will hopefully put some meat on the\nbones of this issue, suppose that an individual leaves a\nhouse, and he actually sees police officers sitting in a\ncar, whether marked or unmarked, outside the house. And\nit is clear that he has seen the officers. He waves at\nthe officers and then ambles down the street.\nI don't think that there would be any doubt\nbut that that individual could not be detained unless he\ndid something more; unless, for instance, he engaged in\nflight at that point, at which point he could perhaps be\ndetained under Terry.\nAnd so we simply submit that the analysis\nshould be no different in a situation in which the\npurpose -- the reason why the officers are sitting\noutside the house is because another group of officers\nis about to execute the search warrant.\nOf course, that individual --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But Terry -- Terry is an\nopen question in this case. It wasn't decided below,\nbut it was raised.\nSo -- so you're arguing we shouldn't extend\nSummers, but that leaves this very case susceptible to\nthe assertion that this was a legitimate Terry stop.\nMR. SHANMUGAM: That is correct,\nJustice Ginsburg.\nAnd just to be clear about how these two\ndoctrines work together, our submission to this Court is\nthat within the search zone, within the immediate\nvicinity of the premises, the rule of Summers applies,\nso that, if officers encounter an individual within that\nzone while they are in the process of executing the\nwarrant, a detention is permissible absent probable\ncause or individualized suspicion.\nOutside that search zone, ordinary\nFourth Amendment principles apply. And, of course,\nunder the Fourth Amendment, detentions of persons have\nto be justified by some degree of individualized\nsuspicion; probable cause for a full-fledged arrest,\nindividualized suspicion for a more limited detention\nunder Terry.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, what would you think\nof this situation? Officers have a no-knock warrant,\nand they're -- they're at the house. They see somebody\ncome out the door and start to go down the steps,\ndoesn't look like that person has noticed their\npresence.\nNow, they have the choice, if you prevail,\nof either rushing in and stopping the person within the\ncurtilage, in which case they could detain the person,\nor they could allow the person to walk some distance\noutside of the site of the house and then stop the\nperson, and that would allow them to execute the warrant\nwithout endanger -- without enhancing the danger to them\nfrom potentially armed people inside or allowing the\ndestruction of evidence.\nWhat -- in that situation, what argues in\nfavor of your rule, that if they want to detain this\nindividual, they have to rush in and stop him before he\nleaves the premises?\nMR. SHANMUGAM: The justifications\narticulated by this Court in Summers, Justice Alito, and\nin particular what we really believe are the primary\njustifications, first, minimizing the risk of harm to\nofficers executing the warrant; and, second,\nfacilitating the orderly completion of the search.\nAnd let me say a word about --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, without\ninterrupting -- in that situation, officer safety is\nundermined by your rule because it requires them to stop\nthe person on the premises and, therefore, tip off those\ninside, potentially, about their presence.\nMR. SHANMUGAM: But they also have the\nchoice not to engage in a detention at all.\nAnd I think the fundamental problem with the\ncourt of appeals' rule and with the government's\nsubmission to this Court is that it really entails the\nconclusion that once officers see the individual leaving\nthe house, they have an entitlement to detain that\nindividual, with the only open question being where and\nhow they go about effectuating the detention.\nBut we simply believe that the\njustifications for the detention don't attach to the\nindividual. They are search-based justifications. And\nthe mere fact that an individual is seen leaving a house\nthat is about to be searched in our view is insufficient\nto give rise to reasonable suspicion.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Shanmugam, when you talk\nabout the justifications in your brief and just now, you\ntalk about two; but, there were, in fact, three, and the\nthird was flight. So how is it that that's dropped from\nyour understanding of Summers?\nMR. SHANMUGAM: Well, we simply think,\nJustice Kagan, that that justification is insufficient\nstanding on its own. And that is simply because the\njustification in preventing flight is different in kind\nfrom the other two justifications that we've been\ndiscussing.\nThe other two justifications are truly\nspecial law enforcement interests, to use this Court's\nwords in Summers. The interest in preventing flight, by\ncontrast, is an ordinary law enforcement interest.\nAnd just as in my hypothetical, when the\nofficers are sitting outside and they see an individual\nwander by, the mere fact that the individual saw the\npolice and perhaps would therefore conclude that the\npolice were on to him would not give rise to a basis for\ndetention simply because that individual could\nsubsequently flee.\nSo, too, we think that preventing flight in\nand of itself is insufficient. That is the ordinary law\nenforcement interest that requires individualized\nsuspicion.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, can I come back\nto the facts that my colleagues have raised and break it\ndown implicating the Terry question?\nHere, the officers had a report of something\nin the house, and they saw the defendant -- two people\nleaving.\nI know Terry hasn't been decided, but why do\nyou think -- just the stop, not the detention, not the\nbringing them back to the house, why do you think that\njust stopping them was wrong?\nMR. SHANMUGAM: Under Terry?\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Under Terry.\nMR. SHANMUGAM: Sure. Well, and first of\nall, I should preface what I'm about to say by noting\nthat the court of appeals itself didn't reach the Terry\nissue, and the government doesn't advance that issue in\nits merits brief.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But the court below did.\nMR. SHANMUGAM: So that would be an issue\nthat would be open on remand. And let me say why on\nremand --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. Just the\nstop would be -- but -- but they did more than just stop\nthem. They --\nMR. SHANMUGAM: Well, that's right. The\nstop and the --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- they handcuffed them.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, it goes back to if\na police officer saw an individual leaving the house and\nwas concerned about them tipping someone off, et cetera,\nwhat would be the problem with the officer stopping the\nperson around the corner, holding them, making sure\npeople got in and then letting them go.\nMR. SHANMUGAM: And just to be clear,\nbecause there are the two separate issues. There's the\nquestion of the stop and the question of the detention.\nAnd there would be a separate question about whether\nunder Terry a detention of a particular length might or\nmight not be permissible.\nBut as to the stop, the argument that we\nwould make on remand if we were to prevail before this\nCourt would be that here what you have is insufficient\nto meet the reasonable suspicion standard. And what I\nassume that the government would argue is that the\ncombination of the search warrant and the fact that the\nindividual was seen leaving the premises that were about\nto be searched, and as to which there was probable cause\nto believe that contraband was present, and the fact\nthat my client met the extremely generic description\nprovided by the confidential informant, would be\nsufficient to give rise to reasonable suspicion.\nNow, clearly we don't think -- I was just\ngoing to say, clearly we don't think that either of\nthose factors standing on its own would be sufficient.\nThe question would be whether that combination of\nfactors under the facts and circumstances of this case\nwould be sufficient, and we would submit that that\ncombination is insufficient as well.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: If they did do -- if they\ndid do a Terry stop, and in the process of that stop the\npolice officer got a call that said, we found lots of\ncontraband, guns in this house, at that point they could\nhave turned the Terry stop into an arrest, couldn't\nthey?\nMR. SHANMUGAM: They could very well, with\none caveat, and that caveat is simply that the\ncircumstances under which the contraband is found might\nbe relevant to the analysis of whether or not there is\nprobable cause, because the question would be whether or\nnot there is probable cause to believe that the\nindividual constructively possessed the contraband at\nissue.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Shanmugam, please help\nme. I -- I don't understand why -- why the Terry stop\nis at issue, inasmuch as there was not a Terry stop. I\nmean, what occurred here went well beyond a Terry stop,\ndid it not? So what do you do? You -- you slice the\nbaloney that thin; you say well, the -- the first stop\nis a Terry stop. Oh, yes, he later went on to detain\nthem for a long time and put handcuffs on them and take\nthem back to the premises. What -- what relevance does\nthe Terry stop have?\nMR. SHANMUGAM: Well, that would be the\nadditional question, whether the detention in this case,\nwhich did involve taking my client and the other\nindividual, putting them in handcuffs, putting them in\nthe patrol car, and then taking them back to the scene,\nwas permissible within the scope of a Terry stop. And I\nthink that would also be an open question, and that\nwould particularly be an open question in a number of\nthese cases in which the detention, pursuant seemingly\nto Summers, occurs over a very lengthy period of time.\nUnder Terry, of course --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I guess -- I guess, I\njust didn't realize that it's an open question whether\nyou can do that much in -- in a mere Terry stop.\nMR. SHANMUGAM: Well, under Terry officers\nmay detain an individual for the period of time it takes\nfor them to confirm or dispel the suspicion, and I think\nthat there would be an open question as to whether or\nnot when officers are executing a search warrant, for\nthe duration of the execution of the search warrant,\nthat falls within the scope of that Terry test.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Could you explain what you\nmean by the immediate vicinity? Is it based on -- on\nproperty line? Is it some absolute distance from the --\nthe entrance to the premises? Is it based on how far\nyou could see from the -- the site of the search?\nMR. SHANMUGAM: I think ordinarily it will\nbe within the physical bounds of the property. So --\nbut -- but if, for instance, officers saw an individual\ncoming out of his house and he walked out and he just\nhappened to step -- step off the curb into the road\nbefore the officers got to them, we would say that that\nwould satisfy the immediate vicinity standard.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, physical bounds of\nthe property is -- is too much. I mean, you know, what\nif it's a farm and it's a 50-acre farm?\nMR. SHANMUGAM: Well, and the point of --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I think you are much better\noff, I think your submissions sometimes say immediate\nvicinity.\nMR. SHANMUGAM: Well, we -- we proposed to\nthis Court the immediate vicinity standard in large part\nbecause it really is comparable to similar limits this\nCourt has adopted for other Fourth Amendment --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I like that much better\nthan boundaries of the property.\nMR. SHANMUGAM: Well -- and to provide a\ncouple of examples, under Maryland v. Buie, the case\nthat permits officers to conduct a protective sweep\nincident to an arrest, the Court permits officers to\nsearch the area immediately adjoining the place where\nthe arrest occurs and that has not proven to be a\ndifficult standard to apply in practice.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What is the actual\ndifference? I mean, you have two officers or three. If\nthey go into the property and somebody's there, they can\ndetain him, and Summers gives three reasons: One, as\nJustice Kagan pointed out, preventing flight in the\nevent that incriminating evidence is found. We are\nconsidering now the case where, instead of going and\ndetaining the people, the people inside the house walk\nout and there are two officers in a patrol car or an\nunmarked car outside waiting to go in. Okay. That\nseems to me identical, as you said.\nThe last one is facilitating orderly\ncompletion of the search. That seems to me identical.\nYou want the person there so that he can open a drawer,\nso he can unlock a closet, et cetera, okay. Identical.\nThe third one, where there is the only place\nfor difference, it seems to me, is minimizing the risk\nof harm to the officers. Now, the harm, risk of harm to\nthe officers I guess if he goes into the house is that,\nwell, if they leave, they might come back, goodness\nknows, and they've seen they are looking for the drugs,\nda, da, da. Or maybe they will rush out, or maybe there\nwill be a -- well, any, goodness knows what.\nNow here I can see a slight difference, but\nmaybe not. I don't know. Maybe they will come back.\nMaybe they noticed the people in the car outside. Maybe\nthey didn't. Certainly the policemen don't know. And\nthey might go in quicker, and then the others will be\nalerted. I mean, when you talk generally about a risk\nof harm to the police, it seems to me pretty close, if\nnot identical.\nMR. SHANMUGAM: Well -- well, let me --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So what am I missing?\nMR. SHANMUGAM: Let me address each of those\nthree.\nJUSTICE BREYER: You already said the first\none's identical. I don't see how the third one could\nchange, and what about the second?\nMR. SHANMUGAM: Well, I actually don't think\nthat even the first one is identical. But look, we\nthink that first and foremost, the interest in ensuring\nofficer safety is really the paramount interest here,\nand we simply think that it is unlikely that an\nindividual who is seen leaving the scene is either going\nto be aware of the presence of police or return to\ndisrupt the search.\nJUSTICE BREYER: How do you know that? They\nare sitting outside in the car.\nMR. SHANMUGAM: The government has not\nidentified a single example of an individual who is seen\nleaving the scene who has returned to disrupt the search\nin that fashion. Indeed, the government makes a much --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I thought your better\nanswer was the risk of somebody coming back to a house\nexists whether the person just left it or left it an\nhour after or before or 2 hours or 24.\nMR. SHANMUGAM: Well, and that was going to\nbe --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: When the police walk in,\nthey always have to guard against reentry.\nMR. SHANMUGAM: Well, and that was going to\nbe my next point, Justice Sotomayor; and the government\nreally tries to make a broader and more ambitious\nargument. The government tries to make the argument\nthat an individual with a connection to the place to be\nsearched could arrive at the scene while the search is\nongoing, really regardless of whether that individual\nwas aware of the presence of police, and then seek to\ndisrupt the search.\nNow, we think even as to that broader\ncategory of cases the government hasn't made a\nsufficient showing that those sorts of confrontations\nare a common occurrence, particularly in light of the\nroutine precautions --\nJUSTICE BREYER: It's not just that. It's\nthat they might want to get in quicker to stop this\nperson from leaving because he's the one who knows where\nthe drugs are. At least that's what they think. Or\nthey start to shout, and alert the others. Or -- I\nmean, I have never conducted such a search, you know, so\nI don't know the risks involved there, but I can see the\npossibilities. And probably you might have conducted\nthem, but I don't know. So how am I supposed to answer\nthis question?\nMR. SHANMUGAM: I haven't personally\nconducted any searches, Justice Breyer. But I can say\nthat with regard to categorical rules it is really\nincumbent on the government to make a showing as to why\nan extension of a categorical rule is required. Because\nafter all --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We talked about --\nwe talked about officer safety. What about the safety\nof others? Suppose the place being searched is adjacent\nto a playground and there are, you know, dozens of\nchildren playing in the playground. The police are\nworried there would be a shootout and they want to\ndetain the person, so they say: Well, let's wait until\nhe gets a block down the street and detain him there for\nthe safety of the kids. That has -- they can't do that?\nMR. SHANMUGAM: Officers will naturally take\nprecautions in situations like that. They will go in\nwith --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes, the precaution\nis let's wait until he's a block down the street because\nit will be a lot safer. Can they do that and be covered\nby Summers or not?\nMR. SHANMUGAM: They cannot be covered by\nSummers, but what they can do is either follow the\nindividual for the period of time during which they are\nexecuting the warrant, or they can detain that\nindividual if he returns to the scene.\nAnd again, all of the examples that the\ngovernment cites -- and there aren't that many of\nthem -- but the examples that the government cites are\nexamples of individuals who arrive at the scene and when\nthey realize that their place of residence is being\nsearched, they become obstreperous; and to the extent\nthat there is a concern about the threat posed to the\nsafety of officers in those circumstances, we would\nsubmit that the obvious solution is to make clear that\nSummers permits the detention of individuals who arrive\nat the scene; and officers routinely do establish\nperimeters when they are executing search warrants. And\nso when they --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So if he came back -- I\nmean, the scenario here is he was supposed to be driving\nhis friend home, and he would have come back while the\nsearch was ongoing, but the police could apprehend\nanyone while the search -- if that's what you're saying,\nwhile the search is ongoing --\nMR. SHANMUGAM: Well, if he were to return\nto the scene while the search is ongoing, we believe\nthat he could be detained pursuant to Summers, and we\ncite a number of court of appeals cases that have so\nheld.\nWhat the government is really arguing for\nhere is an even more ambitious rule, an additional layer\nof Fourth Amendment prophylaxis, if you will, that\npermits officers to detain an individual who is seen\nleaving the scene based on the possibility that they are\ngoing to return. The government has not come even close\nto making an empirical case as to why that additional\nlayer of prophylaxis is required.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, what if the person\ncomes out the door and walks -- and has walked 50 feet\ndown the block within sight of the entrance at the time\nwhen the police are entering to make the arrest? Would\nthat person be in the immediate vicinity?\nMR. SHANMUGAM: Well, I think that the\nnatural limit on the immediate vicinity rule is imposed\nby the underlying justification, namely, that officers\nshould have the authority to encounter individuals -- to\ndetain individuals they encounter while they are in the\ncourse of executing the warrant.\nAnd so if in your hypothetical,\nJustice Alito, the search team is marching up to the\nhouse, and they encounter the individual 50 feet away\nfrom the door or the property line while they are in the\ncourse of doing so, the justifications of Summers kick\nin at that point. That individual is aware of the fact\nthat the police are about to search his house, and, as\nsuch, that individual poses a threat to the safe and\nefficient completion of the search.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, does that mean that if\nthe person is within sight of the entrance to the\npremises at the time when the police enter, then that\nperson can be searched --\nMR. SHANMUGAM: Well, we don't think --\nJUSTICE ALITO: -- and be detained.\nMR. SHANMUGAM: We don't think that that's\nnecessarily a line of sight rule. So if you had an\nindividual who was sitting out in front of a house six\ndoors down, we don't think that that individual could be\ndetained. Of course, in this case, my client was\ndetained at least seven-tenths of a mile away --\nJUSTICE BREYER: But that's the problem.\nMR. SHANMUGAM: -- so the issue --\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's the problem. The\npolice have to know what they're supposed to do when\nthey go in to search a house, all right? And they know\nthat sometimes they can keep the people there, and you\nare saying, but they can't stop them from leaving if\nthey're not -- all of a sudden, I'm a policeman, and I\ndon't know what to do exactly because I don't know how\nto fill in that blank. And therefore, I might rush\nin -- I don't know -- I see a recipe for a mess, and\nthat's what -- and the mess could involve physical harm,\nand --\nMR. SHANMUGAM: You're missing the --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You're not saying that they\ncan't stop them from leaving. Have you said that; they\ncan't stop them from leaving?\nJUSTICE BREYER: They can't stop them from\nleaving if, blank.\nMR. SHANMUGAM: They -- they could always\nproceed to execute the warrant when they see an\nindividual leaving; and, if they are in the course of\nexecuting the warrant, a detention is permissible.\nBut let me say just one word about the issue\nof the administrability of the rule because, after all,\nwhat we're talking about here is a bright-line rule.\nAnd the very purpose of a Fourth Amendment bright-line\nrule is to provide guidance to courts and officers\nalike.\nIt is true that one can posit difficult\nhypotheticals under our immediate vicinity standard;\nbut, it is also true that it is even easier to posit\ndifficult hypotheticals under the as soon as reasonably\npracticable standard that the government advances, which\nreally reintroduces the very case-by-case analysis that\nbright-line rules are designed to avoid.\nAnd, in addition, it is entirely unclear to\nus what Fourth Amendment purpose that limitation serves\nbecause it is not clear to us why it matters for Fourth\nAmendment purposes how quickly officers effectuate the\ndetention.\nAnd just one last point that I'd like to\nmake before reserving the balance of my time for\nrebuttal.\nThe rule that the government seems to be\nadvocating before this Court is really a much more\nambitious rule than we've even been discussing this\nmorning. The government seems to suggest that the\ngovernment has the authority to detain any individual\nwith a connection to the place to be searched. And I\nthink that that is out of recognition that an individual\nwho happens to be at their workplace could just as\neasily return to the place to be searched as an\nindividual who is seen leaving.\nIn our view, that is an astonishing\nextension of the rule that this Court announced in\nSummers.\nAnd I would like to reserve the balance of\nmy time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Wall.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY B. WALL\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. WALL: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Wall, would you\nanswer -- direct your first response to that last issue\nbecause, as I read your brief, you seem not to be\naccepting the Second Circuit's rule at all. You seem to\nbe proposing what appears to me to be a much broader\nrule that says -- at one point in your brief you state\nthat it is the occupant's observed connection to a home\nsubject to a valid warrant, not his physical location at\nthe time that he is detained, that makes him subject to\ndetention.\nNow, I know police when they're executing\nwarrants often have an advance team that has been\nsurveilling a home, sometimes for days. And they've got\none officer sitting there, and they see who they think\nis the occupant leave, and the team doesn't arrive till\n12 hours later.\nIs it your position that in that\ncircumstance the officers are authorized to go to\nwherever the defend -- wherever the occupant is, the\noffice, the -- wherever he might be, his mother's home,\nand effect an arrest there?\nMR. WALL: No, Justice Sotomayor. I\nappreciate the opportunity to start there because I\nthink Petitioner's reply brief and much of his argument\ntoday is devoted to a position the government's not\ntaking.\nSo let me be very clear. In the\ngovernment's view, Summers is about current and recent\noccupants, people whom police, when they are executing\nthe warrant, find at the home or see leaving the home in\nthe process of executing a warrant.\nAnd the question here is do the\njustifications apply equally as a departing occupant\nsteps away from the home and onto a sidewalk, a yard, a\ncouple blocks away.\nAnd I think my friend's answer to that has a\nwonderfully abstract quality to it that doesn't engage\nany of the realities on the ground.\nJustice Alito, your hypothetical is anything\nbut. It comes very close to the facts of the Cochran\ncase out of the Sixth Circuit. Police arrive at the\nscene. The occupant is known to carry a gun, and he has\na guard dog. So, rather than walk up to the door, they\nwait for him to leave; but, by the time they can catch\nup to him, he's off of the bounds of the property, but\nhe's still very close to the residence. They stop him.\nThey take him back to the residence. He lets the\nofficers in. He secures the dog, and they complete the\nsearch.\nI think that is a model law enforcement\npractice, and it is indistinguishable in any important\nrespect from what went on in Summers.\nThe justifications for detention apply\nequally to departing occupants when they are seen by\nofficers leaving in the process of executing the\nwarrant.\nBut no, Justice Sotomayor, the government is\nnot contending that other connections to the residence,\nother than that kind of observed connection by the\nofficers, could justify a detention under Summers.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, we don't have\nanything like that in this case. We have them getting\ninto a car, driving almost a mile away and being stopped\nat that point.\nMR. WALL: Well, we do have, though, the\nofficers seeing him departing the residence as they're\nexecuting the warrant. It's a no-knock warrant for a\ngun. And rather than stop him right outside the house\nbecause they don't know who else would be inside --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: As they're executing\nthe warrant, I don't remember, was the -- did the\nindividual know that they were executing the warrant in\nthis case?\nMR. WALL: No.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Oh, okay.\nMR. WALL: They had obtained the warrant.\nThey had -- the team had --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So the danger to\nthem is not at all like the situation with the dog and\nthe armed guy just off the property.\nMR. WALL: Mr. Chief Justice, I respectfully\ndisagree. And the government would be happy to have\nthis case decided by having the Court look at the\nFederal and state cases, look at the risks that are\npresent in those cases, and deciding whether the\ninterests of Summers are served in those cases.\nWhat we see in the cases is that -- take\nthis very case, for instance. Petitioner is driving his\nfriend home to meet a court-imposed probation curfew,\nand he is then returning to the house. I think the\nreasonable inference in the record is that he'll be back\nin a matter of minutes. So he --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And then Mr. Shanmugam\nsays they could stop him. They could stop anybody. The\nsearch is ongoing. Somebody approaches the house; the\npolice can stop that person.\nMR. WALL: But think how formalistic and odd\nthat is, Justice Ginsburg, that the police see someone\nleaving, but, if they can't catch up to them on the\nbounds of the property, which has no reasonable\nrelationship to the warrant here, which was for the\npremises, not for the -- for that property --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The threat is from anybody\ncoming back to the house, not just the person who just\nleft.\nMR. WALL: Oh, assuming --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And surely the police, when\nthey're conducting a search, post guards to prevent\npeople from coming in.\nMR. WALL: They often do, Justice Scalia,\nbut --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I assume they always do.\nIt seems to me there's no special threat from the person\nwho -- who left the house. There's always a threat of\nsomebody else coming into the house.\nMR. WALL: Justice Scalia, certainly in\nurban areas they do. I think it's more difficult where\nyou have smaller police departments in rural areas.\nBut the government's not disputing that\nposting sentries is a good idea. That doesn't begin to\ntake care of the most serious cases, where people\noutside of the area of the search fire on or assault\nofficers.\nSo, for instance, in 2008 --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You're missing the\npoint, which is that's going to happen regardless,\nmeaning that risk exists whether the person left the\nminute you got there or a minute before or an hour\nbefore or two hours before. That's the whole point,\nwhich is the risk is extant no matter what.\nMR. WALL: Justice Sotomayor, there is no\nquestion that executing a warrant is dangerous, and\npeople can come onto the scene at any time.\nThe question is, do we want to increase that\nrisk to officers? Here, Petitioner is leaving, he'll be\nback in a matter of minutes, and they're searching for\nguns.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But you didn't know --\nyou don't know that in any search, meaning any time you\ndo a search you have no idea when the -- whether the\noccupant -- sometimes you know whether the occupant is\ninside. You'll hear the TV or something else. But\noften you don't, and you don't know if someone will come\nback and when.\nMR. WALL: Justice Sotomayor, I completely\nagree, although I think that --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So why is seeing someone\nleaving increasing that risk?\nMR. WALL: Because we know that some\npercentage of those people will come back. Some\npercentage will flee, which is one of the interests in\nSummers, which I think Petitioner does not take\nseriously. But some percentage of them will come back\nand some percentage of those returning occupants will\nharm officers. And unfortunately --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: If -- if you have a large\nenough force that you can afford to send two of them in\na car chasing this fellow for a mile, why can't you just\npost those two outside the house, just in case somebody,\nwhether it's this person who's just left or anybody\nelse, comes back? I mean, it -- it seems to me that --\nthat what your positing is -- is -- is unlikely, namely,\nhaving -- having sufficient personnel to follow these\npersons, but not having sufficient personnel to defend\nthe premises against somebody entering.\nMR. WALL: Justice Scalia, first, that isn't\neven arguably going to serve two of the three Summers\ninterests, preventing people from fleeing or garnering\ntheir assistance in the orderly completion of the\nsearch. But even if we --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Can you tell me what\nconstitutional right entitles you to stop someone from,\nusing the word, \"fleeing\"? You certainly are entitled\nto stop someone with whom you have reasonable suspicion.\nBut what constitutional right entitles you to stop a\nperson who's just leaving in the normal act, without\nreasonable suspicion?\nMR. WALL: Justice Sotomayor, I think your\nquestion fills in the answer. What the Court said in\nSummers is when you see someone -- when you find someone\nat a home or you see them leaving at a time when a\nneutral magistrate has determined there's probable cause\nto believe a crime is being committed inside, you have,\nin the words of the Summers Court, \"articulable and\nindividualized suspicion\" to believe that that person is\nlinked to the criminal activity inside the home.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Well, Mr. Wall, you have\nthat, too, about the person in her workplace, and you\nsaid that your argument didn't apply to the person in\nher workplace. So you have to come up with something\nbetter than that. And I guess the question is your rule\nwould seem to encompass, you know, a whole set of people\nwho are leaving their houses for ordinary reasons: I'm\ngoing to work in the morning.\nAnd the question is whether the police can\nstop this person who's going to work in the morning,\nwho's given no indication that he's seen the police\nofficers at the scene, no indication that he's coming\nback immediately or, you know, in any amount of time\nthat it will take you to complete the search.\nAnd that's not an outlier case. It seems to\nme that the hypothetical I just gave you might very well\nbe the more common case than the hypothetical that you\ngave me. So, you know, why isn't this just too broad a\ncategorical rule?\nMR. WALL: Well, Justice Kagan, let me break\nthat up into both parts. First, you know, as far as\ndetaining people who have other connections to the home,\nI think you're right that some of the arguments that the\nCourt adopted in Summers and that the government is\nmaking here could translate. And I think when those\ncases come to the Court, the Court will have to decide\nwhether to recognize doctrines analogous to Summers or\nTerry in those contexts. But that's not what Summers is\nabout. The connection that Summers discusses and\napproves is seeing someone leaving a home subject to a\nvalid warrant for contraband. That's the only\nconnection at issue here.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But is it in the process?\nDoes Summers apply and does this apply only when the\npolice are in the process of executing a valid search\nwarrant?\nMR. WALL: Yes, Justice Breyer. Even\nPetitioner, the way I read his briefs, concedes that if\npolice had caught him outside the basement apartment or\nsomewhere within the property bounds --\nJUSTICE BREYER: If -- if the police\nexecuting the valid search warrant walked through the\ngate and at that moment the individual emerging from the\nhouse had not yet passed through the gate, then under\nSummers the police would have the right to detain him.\nAll right. So the question here is he's\nwalked through the gate. All right. Now, I guess the\npolice -- all right, I see. The police objection is: I\ndon't know. These things are complicated and we might\nnot want to push him back. I don't know what the\nneighborhood is like and maybe somebody will get killed.\nI mean, that's the kind of argument --\nMR. WALL: Justice Breyer, that is\nabsolutely right. The government's central --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I know you'd say that was\nright.\nMR. WALL: I mean, I -- the government's\ncentral contention is there's nothing magical about the\ngate for Fourth Amendment purposes. When he steps\nthrough the gate, he's just as much of a flight risk, a\ndanger to officers and just as able to assist in the\norderly completion of a search.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: There is something magical\nabout the gate or at least about the immediate facility\nof the house. What we're trying to apply here is an\nabsolute rule to make it unnecessary for the officers to\nguess whether they can do this or that. And the rule\nyou propose is, well, you know, a mile away. What's\nyour test, a reasonable --\nMR. WALL: As soon as reasonably\npracticable.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: As soon as reasonably\npracticable. You consider that an absolute test? I\nthought that the test we invented here was meant to help\nofficers, to say this is the rule and you can do it.\nAnd you want to do anything else, use Terry or use --\nuse normal probable cause principles, but this is an\nabsolute rule governing the -- the search of a home.\nMR. WALL: Justice Scalia, it is an absolute\nrule and it tells you who, it gives you a who, who is\ndetainable. People we find --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It doesn't give you a\nwhere. You need more than a who. You need a who and a\nwhere.\nMR. WALL: Well, the who is categorical.\nPeople you find on the premises or you see leaving the\npremises at a time when a magistrate has determined\nthere's probable cause to believe a crime is being\ncommitted inside. The where, the location. Just like\nduration, just like use of force in the Muehler and\nRotelli cases, those are subject to the general\nrequirement of reasonableness under the Fourth\nAmendment.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Wall, the Summers\ncase was an exception. The main rule is you have\nprobable cause. So you are taking the exception, which\nwas tied tightly to the house. You want him to stay on\nthe premises so he can -- there won't be any risk that\nhe's going to disrupt the search, but it was -- it was\nan exception to the main Fourth Amendment rule, and now\nyou are asking to have that exception spread.\nAnd so today you say, oh, well, we're not --\nwe're not asking if the person gets to her workplace,\nbut that the police, but maybe why -- why not? I mean,\nyou -- it's one thing to confine Summers to the house,\nthe immediate premises, and another to say seven-tenths\nof a mile away, that's okay, too.\nMR. WALL: Justice Ginsburg, I think the\nreason Summers carved out the rule is it said, look,\nfor -- for current and recent occupants as a class,\nwe -- officers see, they find or see them at a residence\nwhere there's probable cause to believe a crime is\ncommitted, so across the board we've got reasonable\nsuspicion, and that's why we draw a rule so that we're\nnot going to rebalance every time.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Right. But the\nacross-the-board is a set of people who are at the house\nwhen you want to search the house. And of course,\nSummers makes perfect sense. You want to search the\nhouse, you can't have these people roaming around,\nright? So you have to detain the people.\nBut what you're now saying is: Well,\nthere's another class of people, they're going to work\nin the morning. And we've -- there's -- there is no\nindication that they've seen the police officers;\nthey're going to work. But we get to detain them, too,\njust because we have a warrant to search the house. And\nthe question is why?\nMR. WALL: Justice Kagan, as far as we know,\nGeorge Summers was going to work. I mean, George\nSummers was detainable, as was Petitioner here, on his\nview if we had caught him within the physical bounds of\nthe property. The question is not, you know, how to\napply it in that circumstance. It's does something\nmeaningfully -- meaningful change when he hits the\nsidewalk or the neighbor's yard?\nJUSTICE KAGAN: I mean, something meaningful\nvery -- very much changes. Before, you're dealing with\na problem of a person on the premises while you're\ntrying to search the premises. And now you're talking\nabout a person who is going to work, leaving the\npremises, letting you search the premises without any\ninterference.\nMR. WALL: Justice Kagan, I don't think that\nexplains why you couldn't let George Summers go on his\nway, and it doesn't explain why the Court in Summers\ndidn't say, look, rather than roam the house, if it\nreally is true that once we let you outside the front\ndoor or the front gate, you are no longer a danger and\nare likely only to be a hindrance, why not give you the\noption to leave. Turn them out, because on Petitioner's\nview, they're safe to go. And what the Court in Summers\nrecognized is, no, important interests are served by\ndetaining people in that circumstance.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You have to draw a line\nsomeplace. When he is descending the steps to his\nhouse, he is still associated with the house. And once\nhe steps over that line, the Summers rationale it seems\nto me doesn't apply.\nBut there's a curiosity about this case,\nmaybe you can explain it to me. They stop him\nseven-tenths of a mile away. By that time, the search\nis ongoing. They have found guns and contraband. They\ntake -- why do they take him back to the house? What\nwas the reason for taking? There was nothing there that\nhe could -- he couldn't obstruct the search. He was in\nhandcuffs.\nMR. WALL: I think --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: He couldn't point out\nanything in drawers because they'd found it all.\nMR. WALL: I mean, I think at that point\nthey had probable cause; they could have arrested him\nand I think they could have taken him down to the\nstation house. They returned him to the scene instead.\nAnd I don't think there's any evidence in the record\nabout why they took him back to the scene rather than --\nthan straight to the station house.\nBut, Justice Ginsburg, I do want to fight\nthe premise a little bit. All -- all that the\ngovernment is asking for is for the Court to look\nthrough the Federal and state cases, because we see the\nexact same interests that were served in Summers.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I think -- I think we have\nto take the case on the assumption -- I agree with you\nthere probably was probable cause -- but I think you\nhave to take the case on the assumption that there was\nno probable cause to arrest, because they didn't -- they\ndid not rely on that authority.\nMR. WALL: Justice Kennedy, in\nthat -- assuming that's true, then they took him back to\nthe scene to complete the search, by which time they had\nfound the drugs and the guns, and then they did arrest\nhim. And he has not claimed that at that point there\nwasn't probable cause for an arrest. But these risks\nare real, and they do play themselves out in the cases,\nJustice Kagan --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, the problem\nwith absolute rules like we did in Summers is that\nthey're an exception, and they're absolute.\nGo back to the question you were asked by\none of my colleagues earlier, why wouldn't Terry give\nyou all of the rights that you're seeking on the\nabsolute rule, but subject your police conduct to the\nquestion of reasonableness, which is the normal standard\nof the Fourth Amendment?\nMR. WALL: Of course. A very brief Terry\nstop could allow a departing occupant to go on his way\nlong before the search is completed, and now he's fully\naware of the police presence. So now --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm -- I'm litigating\nfor you.\nMR. WALL: Sure. Okay. Imagine that --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So I could very easily\nimagine that what the fight's going to be like below is,\nwe stopped them because we saw them coming out of the\nhouse, and all we want to do is make sure that they\ndon't return. So we're just going to hold them in\nplace. We don't have to drag them in a car back to a\nplace they just left. We're just going to stop them in\nplace to get a phone call that everything's all clear.\nMR. WALL: Well, I take one of the\ndifferences between Terry and Summers to be that in\nTerry the seizure is tied to the officer's brief\ninvestigation, and in Summers it's tied to the execution\nof the warrant.\nNow, if what you're talking about is a Terry\nstop that could last for the duration of the warrant, I\ndon't know that there is much of a difference, then,\nbetween Terry and Summers.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, we don't know, but\nwhy don't we let that develop.\nMR. WALL: Well, because I think the danger\nis that courts will apply Terry the way that they have,\nand we don't want to dilute one doctrine with another.\nA brief Terry stop could allow occupants to\ngo on their way, but now they're aware of the police\npresence. Now, they are much more of a risk to flee or\nharm officers.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Explain -- explain to\nme -- the police, they have the informant's tip, and\nthey see them coming out of the house. So it seems to\nme it's a good case that that would be reasonable\nsuspicion. Coming out of the house, he looks like what\nthe informant says.\nThen they -- can they -- they pat him down\nand they find his keys, and the keys are to the house.\nMR. WALL: Justice Ginsburg, that's\ncertainly true here. I was only saying to\nJustice Sotomayor, you can imagine a case where they\nexecute the warrant, and it takes them a while to find\nsomething. And, in the meantime, they stop a departing\noccupant, he's not carrying a gun, he answers the\nquestions and does not arouse the officer's suspicion,\nand now he is on his way. And he is on his way while\nthe search is ongoing, and now he knows about it.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So what? What's he going\nto -- he's going to phone them and say, hey, you know,\nyou're going to be searched. The cops are crawling all\naround the house already.\nSo the only realistic additional threat is\nthat he is going to voluntarily go back to where the\npolice are in the house? I mean, you know --\nMR. WALL: Well, that is --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- this is so implausible.\nWhat -- what harm --\nMR. WALL: Justice Scalia --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- what threat to the\npolicemen can possibly exist?\nMR. WALL: I think the Texas officers in the\nValdez case, which we cite in our briefs, would find it\nsurprising, where they did let someone go from the\nscene, and she came back with an individual and started\nfighting with police.\nLook, I take Petitioner's point --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Very unusual.\nMR. WALL: Justice Scalia --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Very unusual.\nMR. WALL: -- it is true that only a\nfoolhardy person would do it, but, unfortunately, that\nis a perfect description of many criminals who do not\ntend to be level-headed, rational actors.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You don't adopt absolute\nrules to cover foolhardy people. I mean, we -- absolute\nrules are designed to cover the mine run of cases, the\ngenerality of cases, not the oddball case. That's not\nwhat you use an absolute rule for.\nMR. WALL: That's absolutely right, Justice\nScalia. And in the mine run of cases, what we know is\nthat these people are leaving a home where there's\nprobable cause to believe a crime is being committed.\nPolice are detaining them a short distance away, and\nthey are doing it in cases where people are fleeing or\nthey -- we can reasonably believe they would flee once\nthey've seen officers, if they were not detained.\nThey are violent. They are aggressive.\nSome number of them can come back, and we can make\nreasonable predictions about what they would do, and\nthey provide very valuable assistance.\nThey secured guard dogs, like in the Head\nand Cochran cases, where there were pit bulls and\nDobermans. They allow police to -- they give them keys\nso they don't have effect forceable entry --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's an argument\nin Summers I just don't understand. The argument is you\ncan detain the people because they might want to give\nthe officers assistance. Well, if they want to give\nthem assistance, they don't have to be detained.\nMR. WALL: Well --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It seems odd, you\nknow, we're going to tie -- we're not going to tie you\nup -- we're going to keep you here, you can't leave\nbecause we think you might tell us where the drugs are.\nMR. WALL: Mr. Chief Justice, I mean, I\nthink it is one of three legitimate law enforcement\ninterests where you have someone for whom there is\narticulable and individualized suspicion to believe that\nthey are connected to criminal activity.\nAnd I think that this Court in Summers was\nabsolutely right. You do find people securing guard\ndogs, moving families out of harm's way, providing keys\nso that officers don't have to break in and harm\nproperty or jeopardize third parties. You find them\nhanding over contraband rather than endanger officers.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If they want to do\nthat, they can. The question is whether you can detain\nthem in the hope that they will decide to help you --\nMR. WALL: Well, and --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- to give you the\nkey to the cabinet.\nMR. WALL: -- and the argument in Summers is\nyou can detain them because you've got reasonable\nsuspicion. The question is, what are the interests\nserved by the detention? And that is an interest served\nby detention.\nNow, we're not saying it's an independent\nbasis to support it. These are people for whom, as a\nclass, there's reasonable suspicion, which is why\nSummers carved out the rule that it did.\nNow, this -- the situation in this case and\nthe Federal cases that we're seeing are not meaningfully\ndistinguishable from Summers. You've got the same\nreasonable suspicion, same law enforcement interests,\nsame minimal intrusion. There is no -- along no\ndimension is there a meaningful difference between this\ncase and Summers.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Justice Kagan had the\nhypothetical of the person leaving to go to work, the\n9:00 to 5:00 person. Suppose the warrant's going to be\nexecuted at 5:00. Can they detain him at his office so\nthat he doesn't go back --\nHe always goes right home. He takes the\nNumber 3 bus, and he will be there in 20 minutes. Can\nyou detain him at the office under your rule?\nMR. WALL: Justice Kennedy, no, not under\nSummers.\nNow, whether they can --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: No, under the rule you're\nproposing.\nMR. WALL: I don't think so. I mean, when\nthat case --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I don't know -- I don't\nknow why not, under the rule that's proposed.\nMR. WALL: -- when that case comes to the\nCourt, the Court will have to decide whether to\nrecognize a doctrine analogous to Summers and Terry.\nAnd I will honestly admit that some of the arguments\nthat the government's making here and that the Court\nadopted in Summers will translate.\nBut Summers is not about that. Summers is\nabout current and recent occupants. And those, as a\nclass, have reasonable suspicion.\nNow, I think these other cases get harder.\nThey will turn much more on what the connection was in\nthe facts of a specific case.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, my -- I remain\nwith my question, which is, we have a\ncircumstance-driven power, Terry. Your power is really\ngoing much more broadly, because you're basically saying\nif that -- if probable cause exists to search a premise,\nit exists without being tied to an individual because\nanybody who leaves the house, whether or not they have\nbeen tied to a crime in that house in the past or not,\nis now subject to being detained.\nSo we have evidence that only a husband is\ninvolved in a fraud, and his wife is leaving for work.\nBecause she was observed leaving the house, she can now\nbe stopped a mile away.\nMR. WALL: Justice Sotomayor, to be clear,\nthat's not the government's rationale. That's the\nrationale of the Court in Summers.\nMaybe the wife is aiding and abetting. We\ndon't have any idea. Maybe the wife, you know, is\nimplicit in the -- the husband's crime in some way. The\nCourt's point --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So your -- your view is\nthat Summers gave you -- entitled you to hold people\nmerely for purposes of investigation --\nMR. WALL: I --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- without any\nreasonable suspicion? That's really what your rule is\nsaying.\nMR. WALL: My view is with the Court's on\nSummers. It's appropriate to consider the nature of the\narticulable and individualized suspicion on which the\npolice based the detention of the occupant of a home\nsubject to a search warrant.\nAnd what the Court said is, whether you're\ninside or whether you're on the front steps or the\nsidewalk, like George Summers, that reasonable suspicion\nexists. The police have placed you in the home at a\ntime when a neutral magistrate has determined there's\nprobable cause.\nAnd to be clear, we're not trying to blow\nthe doors off of this exception. This is a very narrow\nexception. What we see time and again in the Federal\ncases is the same fact pattern: Someone leaves the\nhouse; the police catch up to them within a mile, but\nusually just within a few blocks; and, they return them\nto the scene.\nThe police are not treating this as a sort\nof entitlement. This is not Gant, where the results are\noutstripping the rationale.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The -- the procedure has to\nbe reasonable under the Fourth Amendment, right? Now --\nnow, the requirements for a warrant are not the outer\nbounds of -- of what's reasonable, but nonetheless, what\n-- it seems to me that what's reasonable under the\nFourth Amendment can be estimated from what the Fourth\nAmendment requires a warrant to contain, and what a\nwarrant must contain is a description of the place to be\nsearched, and the persons or things to be seized.\nAnd what you're arguing for is a special\nrule which says once you have a warrant that this place\ncan be searched, you can seize anybody -- you can seize\nnot only anybody there in order to protect the police,\nbut anybody connected with the -- with the place. And\nthat -- that is so contrary to what -- what seems to me\nthe theory of -- of the Fourth Amendment that I am very\nreluctant to -- to extend our cases any further than\nthey already exist.\nMR. WALL: Justice Scalia, we're not here\nasking for the Court to extend Summers. We are just\nasking for a faithful application of what the Court said\nin Summers. And I understand that, you know, it would\nseem troubling would -- were it not for the fact that\nthe Court in Summers, I think, really walked through why\nas a class, when you're inside the home or you're\nleaving the home, we've got reasonable suspicion that\nyou're connected, and there are a number of good reasons\nwhy police can detain you while they execute the\nwarrant.\nYou're right, the Fourth Amendment does\nrequire reasonableness, and what the officers did here\nwas eminently reasonable. They are executing a no-knock\nwarrant at a drug stash house for a gun; they see\nsomeone leave who fits the description of the drug\ndealer; and rather than stop him right on the threshold\ninside the curtilage and risk alarming his confederates,\nthey let him drive a short distance away and they return\nhim to the scene.\nThere's no meaningful difference between\nthat and if they had stopped him right outside the\nhouse. The only thing they would have been --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: In this case, you\ncouldn't think of a reason why they took him back to the\nscene.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Maybe he had a key to\nthe -- to the place where they keep the drugs, the\nbasement or something.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: He might have wanted to\nhelp in the search.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Is that fanciful? Is it\nfanciful that people who are searched open doors or --\nMR. WALL: It's far from being fanciful.\nThe Sherrill case out of the Eighth Circuit, the Sears\ncase out of the Eleventh Circuit, they came back and\nthey unlocked doors so the police wouldn't have to make\nforcible entry. In Montieth out of the Fourth\nCircuit --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes, but the\nquestion is whether you have to detain them to do\nsomething you're saying they'd want to do.\nMR. WALL: Mr. Chief Justice, we're not here\nsaying that every time somebody could be helpful in a\nsearch you could go out and detain them. It is an\nexception to the normal probable cause requirement, but\nit's an exception analogous to Terry because you've got\nreasonable suspicion. And the question is there, okay,\nas a categorical rule, you know you've got reasonable\nsuspicion for this entire group of people, current and\nrecent occupants; what reasons do police have to detain\nthem?\nAnd there are really good reasons. One,\nthey tend to flee. And we see that in Cavazos out of\nthe Fifth Circuit. Two, they provide assistance in the\nsearch; and three, they are often violent or aggressive\nindividuals.\nI don't think it's irrelevant that the vast\nmajority of search warrants for contraband are for guns\nand drugs, and you see a number of amici states in here\nsaying: Look, this is a legitimate and important law\nenforcement practice for officers in a very dangerous\nand volatile situation in executing these warrants.\nAnd I think Petitioner takes those risks way\ntoo lightly, and will not -- steadfastly refuses to\nengage the realities on the ground that we see in the\ncases. Judges and the Federal and state courts are\ngrappling with this every day, and what these opinions\nreveal is that these risks cannot be so easily\ndismissed. They are serious and they are real, and we\nsee them play themselves out across this entire set of\ncases.\nAnd what we don't see noticeably is the\nkinds of things that the Court tends to be worried about\nin Fourth Amendment cases: Abuse and police\nentitlement. Again and again, you see police detaining\ndeparting occupants a very short distance from a\nresidence, returning them, not prolonging the detention,\nnot engaging in exploitative questioning, and actually\nserving the three interests that the Court identified in\nSummers.\nAnd to be clear, Petitioner's solution is\nmore than just a solution in search of a problem; it\ncarries its own problem. It is severely\nunder-inclusive. It will not capture any number of\ncases where there are valuable law enforcement interests\nto be served. And it will produce very silly results in\na number of cases where police can't catch up to a\ndeparting occupant for one reason or another until after\nhe's crossed some magical gate, and they will have to\nsit on their hands until he returns so that they can do\nexactly what they would have done minutes or hours\nearlier if they'd been able to detain him.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: They can follow him.\nMR. WALL: They can, but, Justice Ginsburg,\ntailing is a risky proposition, particularly in an urban\narea. And that doesn't even arguably begin to serve the\ninterest in avoiding flight or facilitating efficient\nand orderly --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: All law enforcement would\nbe a lot easier if we didn't have the doggone Fourth\nAmendment. I mean, the Fourth Amendment is an\nimpediment to law enforcement. Of course it is.\nThere -- there's no doubt about that.\nMR. WALL: Justice Scalia, if you start from\nthe premise that the Fourth Amendment doesn't permit\nthis, then I lose. But I think what the Court said in\nSummers is, what we -- this Court has already drawn a\nnumber of exceptions to the probable cause requirement\nin reasonable suspicion cases. This is another, and it\nserves very valuable interests in this case and others.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Shanmugam, you have 3 minutes left.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF KANNON K. SHANMUGAM\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. SHANMUGAM: Thank you, Mr. Chief\nJustice. Just -- just a couple of points.\nFirst of all, having suggested in its brief\nthat the police may detain any individual with a\nconnection to the place to be searched under Summers,\nthe government today falls back to the view that the\npolice may detain any individual with an observed\nconnection, suggesting that this Court can leave for\nanother day the question of whether to detain people\nwith a certain but non-observed connection.\nLeaving that aside, the government suggests\non at least five occasions today that that observed\nconnection is sufficient to give rise to reasonable\nsuspicion. That was not the basis on which this Court\nadopted its categorical rule in Summers. If it had\nbeen, the discussion of the special law enforcement\ninterests supporting the rule would have been entirely\nsuperfluous.\nAnd it's for that reason we would\nrespectfully submit that the Court made clear in\nfootnote 19 that Summers permits officers to detain\nindividuals regardless of the quantum of proof\njustifying the detention of specific individuals.\nAnd this Court's subsequent cases applying\nSummers have made clear that Summers permits the\ndetention of individuals with no apparent connection to\nthe criminal activity being investigated.\nAnd that leads into my second point, which\nis that Terry will serve as a fallback in many of these\ncases to permit detentions of individuals who are seen\nleaving the premises, where there is a sufficient\nadditional basis to give rise to reasonable suspicion.\nIn fact, it may very well be the exception to the rule\nthat you have a case in which there aren't sufficient\nadditional articulable facts to give rise to reasonable\nsuspicion.\nWe would respectfully submit that this case\nfalls within that exceptional category, but it really\nunderscores why the expansion of Summers that the\ngovernment is seeking is really unnecessary.\nI would just note, in response to a point\nthat Justice Scalia made, that the fundamental flaw with\nthe government's position is that it really can't be\nreconciled with any original understanding of the Fourth\nAmendment. There's no historical evidence suggesting\nthat officers at the time of the founding or thereafter,\nwhen executing search warrants, detained the occupants\nof the premises.\nAnd the problem with the government's\napproach is that it really would convert any search\nwarrant into a search and seizure warrant. It would\nreally would suggest that there is a freestanding right\nto detain anyone with a connection or an observed\nconnection to the place to be searched that operates\nalongside the warrant-conferred right to conduct the\nsearch.\nJUSTICE ALITO: What -- would you say the\nsame thing about the exact situation in Summers?\nMR. SHANMUGAM: No, we wouldn't,\nJustice Alito.\nJUSTICE ALITO: You think the original\nunderstanding was that what happened in Summers was\nokay, but if you get out of the immediate vicinity,\nthat's where they drew the line?\nMR. SHANMUGAM: We're not challenging the\nrule of Summers itself. We're simply suggesting that\nthere's no historical basis for that rule, and for that\nreason we think that any expansion of Summers would\nreally be of questionable validity. In Summers itself,\nthe detention was truly incident to the execution of the\nwarrant because, after all, the officers were\napproaching the house and literally just about to\neffectuate entry when the detention took place.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you can say there was\na historical basis for the rule, in that officers have\nalways been allowed to take necessary action to protect\nthemselves. And that's the principal justification.\nMR. SHANMUGAM: Perhaps, but we have been\nunable to find any examples of detentions of occupants\nof the premises until at least 1880. And our point is\nsimply that the detention ceases to be truly incident to\nthe search where the individual has left the scene. The\njustifications for the detention evaporate at that\npoint.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
