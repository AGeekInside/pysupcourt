McLEAN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMS. McLEAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nIn Lindh versus Murphy, this Court held that\nchapter 153 was non-retroactive to cases pending at the\ntime of AEDPA's enactment. In the general run of habeas\ncases, this is determined by the filing date of the\napplication for habeas relief.\nThis case will resolve a split between the five\ncircuits that apply this rule to capital cases and the\nNinth Circuit which, instead, looks to the date the\npre-application motion for counsel was filed in a capital\ncase.\nWe believe that the five circuits are correct.\nNeither chapter 153 nor Lindh versus Murphy\nidentifies the commencement event that triggers the\napplication of chapter 153. In light of this, we must\ndetermine Congress' intent, and the first place to look is\nto the express terms of chapter 153 and, of course,\nAEDPA's purposes to expedite habeas cases and to provide\ngreater deferential review to State -- State criminal\nconvictions.\nChapter 153 by its terms can only apply to a\nmerits petition. It repeatedly contains express language,\nsuch as that contained in 2244(d), which is found at\npetitioner's appendix 185, which concerns the statute of\nlimitations provisions and provides that the statute of\nlimitations applies to the application for habeas relief.\nSimilarly, the standard of review in 2254(d) at\npetitioner's appendix 191 --\nQUESTION: Well, what do we do about McFarland's\napproach?\nMS. McLEAN:\nthese are easily reconciled. I believe that it -- that\nthere's a -- I think the habeas proceedings can be -- are\nunique and can be extended. They can also be divided\ninto -- into segments.\nThe first phase is the pre-application phase,\nwhich is what McFarland was concerned about. In that\ncase, this Court was concerned about providing, pursuant\nto 21 U.S.C. 848 -- concerned about the pre-application\ngrant of counsel to habeas petitioners. But that is\nentirely separable from the merits proceeding that occurs\nafter the filing of the -- of the petition itself which\nbrings the merits before the court.\nQUESTION: It's the difference between a case\nand a proceeding. How -- how do you get us here under the\nwords of the statute?\nMS. McLEAN: The -- actually, the provisions of\nchapter 153 themselves do not contain the word case.\nThat -- we only come to that term at all because in this\nCourt's opinion in Lindh, the Court looked to -- created\na -- viewed the -- as being a negative inference from the\nabsence of the pending cases language that appears in the\n154 provisions.\nThe 153 provisions do not have that -- those --\nthat term in them. Instead, they use the specific express\nwords of an application.\napplication. And the case -- that's reconcilable because\nthe portion of the case that we're talking about is the\nmerits portion of the -- of the case.\nThis Court recognized that there can be multiple\ncases in a habeas proceeding. In Slack versus McDaniel,\nthe Court recognized that there could be a separate\nappellate case that --\nQUESTION: How was it treated on the court's\ndocket? I mean, the -- something was going on. There was\na request for a stay. There was a request for the\nappointment of counsel. So something was initiated, and\nwhat was that something called?\nMS. McLEAN: That would -- it could be\ncharacterized as -- you could use the word case. You\ncould use the word habeas corpus proceeding.\nQUESTION: Do you know how it was in fact? How\nwas it treated on the court's docket?\nMS. McLEAN: It --\nQUESTION: Was it given a case name and a file?\nMS. McLEAN: It was -- it was certainly given a\ncase name and assigned a case number, undoubtedly, but I\ndo not --\nQUESTION: And would that number indicate that\nit was a habeas petition?\nMS. McLEAN:\nin California, the -- the district courts have numbers\nthat specify that it's a habeas proceeding.\nQUESTION: So it was on the docket as a habeas\ncase.\nMS. McLEAN: That's correct.\nQUESTION: And that's not good enough.\nMS. McLEAN: That's not determinative. What\nI'm -- my position is, or our position is, is that\nthese -- that the habeas proceeding is unique and\nextended. It includes three phases; includes the\npre-application phase, which is the -- what McFarland was\nconcerned about. It -- it then has the merits application\nphase that begins with the filing of the application for\nhabeas relief. It then also has the appellate phase.\nQUESTION: Well, McFarland was a totally\ndifferent statute from AEDPA, was it not? It -- it was --\nit's a totally separate statute.\nMS. McLEAN: That's correct, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: And really, what we're trying to\ninterpret here, I take it, is the meaning of some of the\nlanguage in Lindh. We're -- we're not talking about any\nspecific language in -- even in AEDPA.\nMS. McLEAN: Well, we're concerned about --\nLindh used the phrase that -- that there was\nnon-retroactivity of chapter 153 to cases -- to cases\npending under 153.\nSo the question is, what is the commencement\nevent that we talked about, that -- that we're referring\nto? What -- what creates the pending case for purposes of\nchapter 153?\nFor that, we have to look back to the express\nterms of the statute. Since 153 can -- doesn't apply to\nthe -- the pre-application phase --\nQUESTION: Why -- why would we look to the\nexpress terms of the statute when Lindh itself didn't rely\non any express terms of this statute? Why wouldn't we\nlook to -- to what makes sense with respect to the rule\nthat we have created?\nMS. McLEAN: I would agree with that, that\nthe -- what I'm saying is that in the absence of -- in the\nabsence of language -- there's clearly an absence of\nlanguage in 153 that addresses this commencement event.\nSo that puts us into a position of looking to see what\nCongress intended based on what the express words of\nchapter 153 are. Is -- is there anything in chapter 153\nthat tells us that, no, we didn't mean the -- the -- a\ncommencement of a habeas proceeding based on the filing of\nan application? We meant something earlier, i.e., the\nmotion for -- for a request for appointment of counsel.\nAnd the answer to that is no. Simply no. There\nis nothing in chapter 153 that has anything to do with the\npre-application proceeding. Those provisions, as is\ndemonstrated by their terms and also the habeas corpus\nrules concerning chapter 2254 cases -- those only can\napply -- expressly apply to applications for habeas\nrelief. They do not apply to any earlier event, and it\ndoesn't -- it thwarts the purposes of AEDPA by -- by\nunduly confining the number of cases covered by it,\ncapital cases covered by it. It --\nQUESTION: That's the part I wonder. I was\nthinking that if it's open to -- pend -- the -- the\ncase -- what is it called? Is it -- McFarland -- suggests\nthat it's at least open to calling this pending. It's a\npossible construction.\nMS. McLEAN: Yes, it's a possible construction.\nQUESTION: And then -- and then it being a\npossible construction, I wonder, well, there was an awful\nlot of proceeding that went on here. There was a stay.\nIt was opposed. And all of this took place before the --\nthe petition was filed. So if the purpose of AEDPA, at\nleast as we've interpreted it, is to stay away from\nproceedings that were already underway, this would seem to\nhave been well underway.\nMS. McLEAN: It was -- the -- the proceeding was\nwell underway, but that doesn't -- is not determinative\nin -- in the sense that counsel had been appointed and a\npetition was in the works. But that --\nQUESTION: That's -- that's what I want you to\naddress precisely. That's where I'm uncertain. It seems\nas if the language -- you could -- you could -- you\ncould -- the language is open to either interpretation --\nMS. McLEAN: I don't --\nQUESTION: And yet -- well, you -- you think\nit's more strong in your direction. I -- I understand\nthat. But if -- say, if it's open to either\ninterpretation, then why doesn't the purpose of the\napplication provisions, as we've interpreted them, suggest\ndon't apply it where proceedings are well underway, which\nwould mean the other side would win here. That's why I'm\nasking you. I want to see what your response is.\nMS. McLEAN: In order to deviate from -- from\nthe normal -- also, there is no question that in -- in the\ngeneral run of habeas cases, it's triggered by the filing\nof the application. So the question is whether there's\nsome justification, some harm that would be caused by\nnot -- by treating them -- them being the capital cases --\nunder the Ninth Circuit's ruling differently than we do\nthe normal run of habeas cases. And there's nothing about\nthe fact that a counsel had been appointed or that -- that\na application was in the works, but not yet filed, that\nwould prevent us or harm in any way those petitioners from\nultimately being subject to the greater standards of\ndeferential review that -- that AEDPA ultimately imposed.\nThere's no harm whatsoever.\nAnd it doesn't further -- it thwarts the\npurposes of AEDPA to do that. It -- it also creates a\nsubclass of capital defendants who are treated\ndifferently --\nQUESTION: But if everyone had focused on AEDPA,\nwhich they didn't because it wasn't enacted at the time\nall this started, then maybe the district judge would have\nmade the time lines different. And the district court had\na proceeding before it with a number. It was classified a\nhabeas case. And the district court set a rather relaxed\nschedule. He gave the counsel, appointed counsel, many\nmonths to file the actual petition. And if everybody had\nknown that the -- that the time the district judge gave\nwould mean that AEDPA would apply, then I assume counsel,\nbeing diligent, would have said, don't give me that much\ntime. I have to get this in quickly.\nMS. McLEAN: This case that's before the Court\ndoes not involve the statute of limitations, however. The\nconcerns that you're expressing would be valid --\nQUESTION: But you don't want AEDPA to apply, if\nyou're diligent counsel, because the standards are much\ntighter.\nMS. McLEAN: It does affect the standards of\nreview, but they don't --\nQUESTION: Well, counsel didn't have to take all\nthe time that the district court allowed, did he?\nMS. McLEAN: He did not need to, but he -- he\nwas fully compliant.\nTo the extent that the Court's concern here\nappears to this counsel to be concerned about the statute\nof limitations, there was no issue here. This case came\nin timely. And in fact, in the Ninth Circuit, they\nfollowed the same rule that all the other five circuits\nfollowed all the way up until 1998. So really the statute\nof limitations is virtually a non-issue in this situation.\nThis case did -- the -- the -- any delays or long periods\nof times that were granted or anything didn't have\nanything to do with this case. There is no harm in this\ncase.\nThe only issue is that now, once this case was\nin the district court and in the Ninth Circuit, should it\nbe subject to the deferential standards of review that\nAEDPA imposed, and the answer to that is yes. There was\nno -- there is absolutely no harm in now saying that\nbecause the filing of the application came in after the\nenactment of AEDPA, that it should be subject, just as all\nother habeas cases are, to --\nQUESTION: Do we know how many cases fall in\nthis category? This is a transition case caught in\nbetween. No AEDPA when it all started; AEDPA in the\nmiddle before the petition is filed.\nMS. McLEAN: That's correct.\nQUESTION: How many cases are in that category?\nMS. McLEAN: We believe -- we believe that it\naffects approximately -- in the Ninth Circuit,\nparticularly in California, it affects approximately\n45 capital cases.\nQUESTION: 45 cases.\nMS. McLEAN: It also -- it also, of course,\naffects the other -- those cases, those capital cases,\nthat are covered by the other circuits which currently\nuse -- all of which, other than the Ninth Circuit, as to\nthose 45 cases, use the filing date of the application.\nSo if the Court, obviously, was to choose the position\nadvocated by respondent, it would change the standard of\nreview from AEDPA to non-AEDPA in those States covered by\nthose circuits.\nIn the Ninth Circuit, what will -- would happen\nif you adopted the position that I'm advocating is that\nyou -- that those 45 cases in California, approximately\n45 cases in California, will now become AEDPA cases. And\nthat will primarily affect the standard of review that is\napplied to them.\nGarceau --\nQUESTION: Do you happen to know -- that was a\nvery good answer. Do you happen to know the number of\ncases in the other circuits if we ruled the other --\nMS. McLEAN: I'm -- I'm sorry, Your Honor, I do\nnot.\nQUESTION: It's a vanishing problem in any\nevent.\nMS. McLEAN: That's certainly true, but it's\nvery important. Garceau is the perfect example of why\nthis is an important issue for this Court, the -- in\nGarceau, the -- the State -- the State supreme court\nissued a very well-reasoned opinion issuing -- saying that\nit had decided that error was harmless, upholding the\nconviction that occurred in this case. It went through\nthe district court. The district court agreed. It went\nto the Ninth Circuit in 2001 -- this was a 1984 killing.\nIn -- in 2001, it was reversed by the Ninth Circuit, which\ndid -- because it did not believe it was an AEDPA case,\nrefused to apply the deferential standard of review,\nrefused to apply the precedents of this Court, instead\nlooked at its own -- its own cases, and reversed it.\nAnd this is -- you know, this is the most\nimportant -- a capital conviction in California is the\nmost important cases -- some of the most important cases\nthat that State issues. And -- and to have that reversed\nfor the failure to apply this -- the standards that\nCongress imposed in 1996 is a very, very serious matter.\nAnd that's just one case. It's happened in other cases.\nAnd -- and so, we believe that it's very important to have\nthis issue straightened out.\nQUESTION: Do you wish to reserve the remainder\nof your time?\nMS. McLEAN: Your Honor, I do. At this point,\nI would like to reserve my remaining time. Thank you.\nQUESTION: Very well, Ms. McLean.\nMs. Coffin, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF LYNNE S. COFFIN\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMS. COFFIN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe issue is not whether this harms Mr. Garceau,\nbut whether it is appropriate under this Court's precedent\nto rule the way the State asked this Court to rule.\nFor two independent reasons, the amendments to\nchapter 153 do not apply to Mr. Garceau.\nFirst, it simply cannot be, as the State\nsuggests, that after this Court found in McFarland that\na capital case is commenced by the filing of a motion for\ncounsel, that Congress then passed a new statute,\nintending it to be interpreted consistent with the dissent\nin this case. Congress must be presumed to have been\ninformed by this Court's majority ruling in McFarland.\nThe McFarland Court ruled that -- that Congress had\npermitted a capital proceeding to be initiated by the\nfiling of a motion for counsel. That ruling was only\n2 years before Congress made major revisions to the habeas\ncorpus law in AEDPA. Under statutory construction\nprinciples, Congress must be found to have been aware of\nand followed this Court's precedent set in McFarland.\nQUESTION: Well, are you -- are you saying,\nMs. Coffin, that McFarland is controlling in the very\nstrict sense of the word here, that if -- we must rule in\nyour favor without looking anywhere else just because of\nthe decision in McFarland?\nMS. COFFIN: No. What I'm -- what I am saying\nis that I believe that this Court should look to what\ninformed Congress when they wrote AEDPA. And I think once\nthat is done, this Court will conclude that if you\ninterpret the ruling in Lindh, where -- where 107(c)\napplies to 153 and 154 -- where did Congress get the word\ncase when they were determining who would be subject to\nthis law?\ncase is begun, you get a number, you're put on a docket.\nThat is your case, and that is consistent with what this\nCourt decided in McFarland.\nWhat is not consistent is to believe that\nCongress used the word case rather than petition when they\nquite clearly used petition in many other parts of the\nstatute.\nQUESTION: When -- when did Congress pass the\nlaw that -- that overturned the result in McFarland? You\nsay they passed a law that overturned the result?\nMS. COFFIN: No, no. What I said was that they\npassed AEDPA, and when they did that, they were informed\nin how they wrote that statute by McFarland. That was in\n'96.\nQUESTION: Okay. And they -- they haven't dealt\nwith the issue of McFarland.\nMS. COFFIN: Well, in -- yes and no. I mean,\nI think that they -- they had an opportunity to change\n848(q) and looked at 848(q) --\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMS. COFFIN: -- when they wrote AEDPA, and they\nchose to leave 848(q) in place.\nQUESTION: Well, now, is that supported by\nsomething in, say, the legislative history, or is that\njust your -- your own view of what must have happened?\nMS. COFFIN: There is nothing in the legislative\nhistory that supports one side or the other. However, if\none looks at McFarland -- the majority decision, as well\nas Justice O'Connor's concurrence and dissent -- one sees\nthat this Court made it very clear to Congress that if\nthey meant something like petition or application, which\nare pretty much used synonymously, that they better put\nthose words in because, in fact, the majority in this --\nin -- of this Court refused to read that kind of language\ninto McFarland, and that's part of how McFarland got\ndecided.\nSo very shortly thereafter, Congress wrote a law\ncompletely revising or, you know, substantially revising\nhabeas corpus. And it's simply difficult to believe that\nat that point, they decided not to look at the majority\nopinion in McFarland which uses the word case.\nQUESTION: But it's -- it's not at all an\nunusual phenomenon that -- that a word in -- in statutes\nhas different application in different contexts where\nyou --\nWe had a case the other day. When is something\nfinal? Congress says, you know, when -- when it's final.\nIt depends on what the context is, and nothing -- nothing\nsays that just because you -- you think that the case for\none purpose, for the McFarland purpose, begins with the --\nwith the initial filings, for -- for all purposes it has\nto begin there.\nAnd what impresses me about this case is that I\ndon't see what is gained by extending the inapplicability\nof AEDPA earlier than the filing of the habeas petition\nbecause the purpose of -- of the non-retroactivity\nprovision is certainly not to cause somebody to be\nfrustrated in actions that he took in reliance upon the\nprior law. And -- and a -- a habeas applicant could be\nfrustrated in events that occur after the filing of his\nhabeas petition. But all of the events prior to that\nfiling that were covered by McFarland, they aren't covered\nby AEDPA anyway. AEDPA could not possibly affect those\nearlier events. So -- so nothing -- nothing is served by\nmaking the retroactivity go back further.\nMS. COFFIN: Well, I -- I think there are\nactually two answers to that question. The first one is\nit isn't really an issue of whether or not -- in my\nopinion, it's not an issue of whether or not some harm is\ngoing to come to -- to Mr. Garceau by interpreting this\none way or the other. That's not the issue.\nThe issue is what did Congress mean when they\ndid this. They had one purpose, I agree with you, which\nwas to reform habeas corpus and make things move in a --\nin a more orderly fashion.\nQUESTION: Right.\nBut they had another -- there -- there is also\nanother part to that, and that is, they determined that\ncertain cases would not be covered by AEDPA. And so --\nQUESTION: Well, those cases -- those cases, in\nwhich they did not want to frustrate legitimate\nexpectations.\nBut my point is, there is no possible legitimate\nexpectation that would be frustrated by AEDPA in the\npre-application stage. AEDPA simply doesn't have anything\nto do with that.\nMS. COFFIN: Well, the language of the statute\nsays case, and -- and I think there -- I think --\nQUESTION: Okay. You're back to that argument,\nbut on that argument, you know, what's a case depends on\nthe context.\nMS. COFFIN: I also think that there is a -- a\nreason that can be discerned from their retroactivity\nprovisions which was --\nQUESTION: Well, in your -- in your answer to\nJustice Scalia, you said, well, you're not sure about the\nharm, but the harm exists, it -- it seems to me, in not\ngiving full effect to the congressional scheme. The --\nthe Congress obviously thought that this was a -- that\nAEDPA was a preferred regime, and you are delaying what\nCongress has found a preferred regime. So it's a harm in\nthat sense, maybe not the harm in a particular case that\nwould come out one way or the other, but you are delaying\nthe effectiveness of -- of a congressional scheme.\nMS. COFFIN: But Congress chose to determine\nthat not everyone would be immediately affected --\nimmediately affected by AEDPA, and they --\nQUESTION: Well, of course, for -- for the\nreasons given. We -- we want -- we want cases that\nhave -- where the merits have been addressed to be decided\nunder the -- the law before it was changed by AEDPA.\nMS. COFFIN: Justice Kennedy, I believe that, in\nfact, the -- the cases that were in the pipeline, this\nfinite number of cases, were exactly the cases -- not the\n154 cases, but the 153 capital cases that were in the\npipeline that Congress was aware that they were\npre-petition cases, petition cases, various kinds of\ncases. And if they wanted to make sure that it -- this\nstatute would be interpreted in a way so that anyone that\nwas in Federal court and that had vast proceedings take\nplace, but that had not filed a petition yet, all they had\nto do was put the word petition in. And I believe that we\nare bound by what Congress did. I understand that\nthey want --\nQUESTION:\nnot true that -- that we give a word the same meaning in\nall contexts. We -- we evidently don't. There are so\nmany instances of that, that your argument cannot --\ncannot rely just upon that. And it seems to me all of the\nother courts that have come out the other way from the\nNinth Circuit have done so for a very sensible reason, and\nthat is that there is nothing to be gained, nothing\nwhatever to be gained, by refusing -- or by -- by refusing\nto apply AEDPA to these pre-petition activities inasmuch\nas AEDPA cannot affect them at all.\nMS. COFFIN: Well, if -- to give you a brief\nanswer, on the other -- on the other circuits, the fact of\nthe matter is none of them analyzed this in terms of\nCongress' intent at the time that they wrote AEDPA and how\nthey were informed by McFarland.\nHowever, even if this Court is not convinced\nthat Congress' awareness of McFarland is dispositive as to\nthe meaning of case pending, Garceau had a case pending\npre-AEDPA under this Court's definitions of what\nconstitutes a case.\nPrior to AEDPA, Garceau had begun the process of\nchallenging a State conviction and death sentence in part\nby filing in the district court a pleading detailing two\nfully exhausted claims of Federal constitutional\nviolations.\nto raise claims and challenge a State conviction and death\nsentence. He filed a document detailing the two claims I\njust mentioned with their factual and legal foundation\nwhich were ripe for adjudication. The district court made\na determination, after hearings, that these claims\npresented viable grounds for habeas corpus relief.\nUnder Hohn, we believe Garceau had a case\npending. The determination in Garceau's case is very\nanalogous to the judicial determination in Hohn concerning\nthe COA application.\nQUESTION: I mean, is it true, by the way --\nis -- is that the case or not that -- I'm interested in\nthe question -- that -- that if in fact AEDPA applies to\na -- AEDPA does -- there's a difference whether AEDPA\ndoes -- does it make a difference if AEDPA applies or not\nto the --\nMS. COFFIN: Yes.\nQUESTION: How?\nMS. COFFIN: Well, there's more deferential\nstandard to the State -- to the State court's decision.\nQUESTION: So it does make just as much\ndifference.\nQUESTION: No, but not -- not to any decision\nthat is taken before the filing of the -- of the formal\nhabeas application.\nMS. COFFIN: Oh. If you're asking whether this\nparticular thing that I was just talking about would have\nmade a difference, no.\nQUESTION: Your case. In your case. A person\nfiles a petition asking for a lawyer, and then we have a\nlot of litigation.\nMS. COFFIN: Right.\nQUESTION: Should there be a stay? Should there\nnot be a stay?\nMS. COFFIN: Right.\nQUESTION: And I guess the answer to that could\naffect a later determination in the case. I don't know.\nMS. COFFIN: I would concede that, in fact, in\nthis case and I think all the pipeline cases, that even if\nAEDPA had applied at the time that the case originated,\nthere would not have been a different determination in\nterms of those early proceedings.\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMS. COFFIN: However, the -- the point I'm\ntrying to make now is that even if this Court doesn't\nbelieve that -- that case pending can be determined by\nlooking at McFarland and Lindh, I think that the -- what\nHohn has identified as what is needed for a case is, in\nfact, found in the Garceau case and that's because of the\nproceeding that Garceau followed where he actually filed\nwhat could have been a petition had that name been put on\nit.\nQUESTION: Can you specify what were the\npre-petition -- I thought that there was -- there was also\nsomething submitted by counsel, a kind of skeletal\nstatement of issues, and -- and because there was an\nadversary proceeding, was there not? The -- the State\nmoved to dismiss the stay. And something what -- was\nsomething different submitted by Garceau himself earlier,\nand then something by counsel later? What was the\nsequence?\nMS. COFFIN: No. What -- what happened is there\nwas an application for counsel. Counsel was appointed.\nCounsel then -- there was a stay before counsel was\nappointed so that counsel could be found. Then counsel\nwas appointed, and an additional 120-day stay went into\neffect before counsel filed the document I'm now talking\nabout. And this document is the Specification of Non-\nfrivolous Issues, which includes two claims that were --\nand were in the petition ultimately that put -- set forth\nthe factual and legal basis for those two claims. And\nthen the judge had to determine whether or not one or both\nof those claims were non-frivolous. Otherwise, the stay\nwould have been dissolved, and Garceau -- actually I would\nimagine that the counsel may have been pulled, but that's\nnot what happened.\nQUESTION: And that statement of issues was\nfiled pre-AEDPA.\nMS. COFFIN: Yes. Yes, and as in Hohn --\nQUESTION: Well, excuse me. There was -- but\nthat was also after the application for habeas corpus had\nbeen filed. No?\nQUESTION: No.\nMS. COFFIN: No, no. This is before. What\nI'm -- what I'm saying is this document, the Specification\nof Non-frivolous Issues, which is required under the rules\nof all of the district courts in California --\nQUESTION: In order to get counsel appointed.\nMS. COFFIN: No. Actually, you get it after\ncounsel is appointed. In order to get an additional stay\nin which to file the petition, you --\nQUESTION: Isn't this --\nMS. COFFIN: -- you get counsel and then counsel\nmust file something that a district court determines is,\nin fact -- has at least one non-frivolous issue --\nQUESTION: Is that ex parte?\nMS. COFFIN: No. It's served -- it's served on\nthe other side.\nQUESTION: And it -- so is it generally argued\nwhether or not these are non-frivolous issues?\nMS. COFFIN: It wasn't argued in this particular\ncase whether they were non-frivolous issues. It's a --\nit's a determination made by the district court. However,\nthe other parties are served and certainly could make an\nargument --\nQUESTION: See, that -- that's why I thought\nthere --\nQUESTION: Could any -- could any of those -- of\nthose events that you've just described, pre-filing of the\nhabeas, conceivably be affected by AEDPA? Is there any\nway that AEDPA could have disappointed expectations with\nregard to that pre-application activity?\nMS. COFFIN: No.\nQUESTION: Why? I mean, that's -- what I\ndon't -- I'm a petitioner. I ask for a lawyer. The judge\nsays, do you have any non-frivolous claim? He says, sure,\nthis is it, and you list them. Now, if, in fact, AEDPA's\nin effect, we're going to apply a pretty lenient standard\nin reviewing the State court determinations on those\nissues, but if AEDPA isn't in effect, we're --\nQUESTION: Are the State court's determinations\nreviewable?\nMS. COFFIN: Well, I -- I certainly --\nQUESTION: I mean, if the State court\nappoints --\nQUESTION: I'm sorry. What I was thinking is\nthat if the standard for reviewing the State court\ndeterminations is different, depending on whether you\napply AEDPA or not, I don't see why, in principle, that\ncouldn't affect the outcome of a judge's decision as to\nwhether the issue in the petition in front of me is or is\nnot a frivolous issue.\nMS. COFFIN: I agree.\nQUESTION: So I think in principle it could\naffect the outcome. In fact, probably -- I don't know if\nit did or not, but I -- I don't see the difference between\nthat affecting the outcome there --\nMS. COFFIN: Well --\nQUESTION: -- and the outcome of an early stage\nwhere you file the petition.\nMS. COFFIN: Well, in fact -- in fact, in this\ncase there probably would have been a different\ndetermination at least as to one of the two issues that --\nthat Garceau put forward.\nQUESTION: I wasn't even aware that these things\nwere reviewable. You -- you mean to say that you get\njudicial review of whether, when counsel is appointed,\nthe -- the trial court allows counsel to proceed with a\nhabeas? You -- you can take that up on judicial review?\nMS. COFFIN: Well, I -- I --\nQUESTION: Don't you just go ahead and what\nultimately is reviewed is the -- is the substantive\ndisposition of the habeas application?\nMS. COFFIN: No. I -- I don't believe so. In\nfact, had the district court determined that there were no\nnon-frivolous issues, the stay would have been dissolved,\nand unless Garceau appealed that judgment of -- of the\ndistrict court or filed something else, he would have been\nout of court.\nQUESTION: Well, what -- but what if the\ndistrict court determined that these were non-frivolous\nissues? Does the State have any right to appeal that\ndetermination? Has it ever happened?\nMS. COFFIN: I don't believe it's ever happened.\nQUESTION: But does the State have a right to be\nheard? The -- the question is whether the stay will be\ncontinued. The Specification of Non-frivolous Issues is\nfiled. If the State says these are frivolous issues, can\nthe State be heard?\nMS. COFFIN: Yes.\nQUESTION: Can the State file a responsive\npleading?\nMS. COFFIN: Yes.\nQUESTION: Do the -- do such hearings occur?\nMS. COFFIN:\nQUESTION: Yes.\nQUESTION: But there was some proceeding.\nMS. COFFIN: There was a proceeding. Before the\nstatement of non-frivolous -- Specification of Non-\nfrivolous Issues was filed, the State objected to the stay\nthat the district court had put into place to -- so that a\npetition could be filed because under the local rules, you\ncan't get an additional stay to file the petition unless\nyou file this document that shows that you have at least\none viable issue. And so prior to the filing of that\nspecification by counsel, the State objected when the\ndistrict court extended the stay.\nQUESTION: And once the issue -- the statement\nof issues -- once that was filed, then there was no\nresponse?\nMS. COFFIN: No. There was no response from the\nState at that point.\nQUESTION: If there had been a response, the\nState had lost, and the State wanted to contest it, could\nthe State take that up?\nMS. COFFIN: I believe -- I -- I believe that\nthey could, but it didn't happen in this case.\nQUESTION: It -- it would be interlocutory.\nQUESTION: You just answered a minute ago to my\nquestion that they couldn't.\nMS. COFFIN: That they couldn't -- no. I\nsaid -- no. My answer -- I'm sorry if I gave a confusing\nanswer. My answer was they didn't in this case and I'm\nnot aware of it happening in other cases.\nQUESTION: Has -- you -- you don't know that\nit's ever been done.\nMS. COFFIN: No. That's correct. That was my\nanswer.\nQUESTION: But if -- if the district judge said,\nall right, I accept these, you've got a non-frivolous\nissue, at that point, the State couldn't go up to the\nappellate court because it would be very -- it would be\ninterlocutory.\nMS. COFFIN: I believe that's correct.\nQUESTION: Help me out and -- and tell me\nwhat -- what portion of -- of AEDPA would apply to this\npre-application event.\nMS. COFFIN: Well if --\nQUESTION: (d) says, an application for a writ\nof habeas corpus on behalf of a person in custody pursuant\nto the judgment of State court shall not be granted with\nrespect to any claim that was adjudicated on the merits in\nState court proceedings. Well, that -- that provision\ncertainly wouldn't apply to any -- there -- nothing has\nbeen -- been adjudicated on the merits. Right?\nMS. COFFIN: If the district court determined\nthat -- if AEDPA applied and the district court looked at\nthe issues that you wanted to go forward on, and applied\nthe deferential standard of AEDPA and, therefore,\ndetermined that, in fact, it was a frivolous issue because\nunder AEDPA you would not be able to win --\nQUESTION: Would you call that an adjudication\non the merits? Just the preliminary determination that\nthere is or is not a frivolous issue here? I -- I\nwouldn't call that a -- a determination on the merits. So\nI don't think (d) would apply.\nWhat about (e)? (e) says, in -- in a proceeding\ninstituted by an application for a writ of habeas corpus\nby a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State\ncourt, a determination of a factual issue made by a State\ncourt shall be presumed to be correct. Are there factual\nissues decided in these -- in -- in these --\nMS. COFFIN: Well, there are --\nQUESTION: -- pre-applications?\nMS. COFFIN: There are factual issues put forth.\nThe factual and legal foundation of the claims that --\nthat are in the Specification of Non-frivolous Issues are\nput forth.\nBut I think that there's an additional question\nthat -- that needs to be examined, which is, is what\nGarceau filed, under this Court's precedent in Hohn, a\ncase? And I believe that it is.\nQUESTION: Was that the view of the Ninth\nCircuit?\nMS. COFFIN: Excuse me?\nQUESTION: Was that the view of the Ninth\nCircuit when it decided this case?\nMS. COFFIN: The Ninth Circuit didn't apply\nAEDPA to this case.\nQUESTION: So you're saying even if AEDPA had\nbeen -- had been applicable, your client still should have\nprevailed.\nMS. COFFIN: No. What -- what I'm suggesting is\nthat AEDPA should not be applied to Garceau either because\nof the first argument that I made about McFarland, or if\nthis Court is not satisfied that, in fact, Garceau had a\ncase pending, which is the language from Lindh that\ndetermines whether or not AEDPA should be retroactive.\nAnd I'd like to make one other point, which is\nthat there are -- it is a finite number of cases that were\nin the pipeline. It's a very unusual situation. In fact,\nyou had to be post-State court determination and in\nFederal court and somewhere along in -- in the process in\nFederal court in order to be in this sort of bubble area.\nAnd I think --\nQUESTION: Well, Lindh was a similar case, was\nit not?\nMS. COFFIN: Yes, but it was non-capital.\nQUESTION: I have a question about this -- the\nproceeding. AEDPA was pending when this was going on, and\nthe counsel that represented this petitioner was the same\ncounsel who represented him in the State court. Isn't\nthat so?\nMS. COFFIN: Actually not. What happened was\nlead counsel in State court was unavailable to go forward\nand neither counsel that -- there were two counsel that\nparticipated at one point or another in State court, but\nneither participated in the whole case and neither was\nlead counsel. And so lead counsel was unavailable and the\ncourt appointed two new counsel who had some familiarity\nwith the case.\nQUESTION: Knowing that AEDPA was on the front\nburner, counsel having some familiarity with the case, why\ndid they use all the time that the district court gave\nthem instead of filing before AEDPA went into effect?\nMS. COFFIN: Well, there were a number of\nreasons for that. The first is that in State court,\nthey -- there was neither discovery nor any evidentiary\nhearing. There was no mechanism -- there was very little\nmoney and there was no mechanism by which counsel could\npull together an entire petition. And the district court\nagreed with that by giving counsel funds in Federal court.\nHowever, the district court set forth a schedule\nby which funds would be -- would be given, and those\nfunds -- you did some investigation, you got -- you\nsatisfied the district court, you got more funds. The\nlast funds were not -- were not given to counsel until,\nI believe, the end of May, which was only about 4 weeks\nbefore the petition was filed. So that's one reason.\nThe other reason is that counsel had to make a\ndetermination, under this Court's precedent, whether or\nnot it would be a mistake not to file a full petition, the\nbest petition that could possibly be made and because it\nwould be possible that it might not have been able to be\namended. And so --\nQUESTION: Ms. -- Ms. Coffin, you -- you have to\nmake the best argument for your client here, and -- and\nyou're doing that.\nBut it strikes me that -- that there -- this is\nsort of a mixed bag, that actually, in agreeing with you,\nwe would probably be -- be harming most capital\ndefendants, that is to say, your client will win on this\nretroactivity point which will eventually vanish. It's\na -- it's a temporary problem.\nBut the effect of our holding that -- that the\nhabeas action for purposes of AEDPA commences with the --\nthe initial request for counsel is that all -- all of the\ntransactions -- I mean, if -- if that provision that all\nfactual determinations by the State court must be deemed\nto be correct, that means that AEDPA would, in the future,\napply to those -- to those determinations. Whereas, if we\ncame out the other way, until the habeas application is --\nis applied, the strictures of AEDPA don't -- are -- are\nnot applicable. So, you know, it's a -- it's -- it's not\na -- not a win-win game, but it is for your client, I\nsuppose.\nMS. COFFIN: Well, actually, Your Honor, since I\nhave clients in many different positions here, I actually\ndon't believe that it would be a problem for other capital\ndefendants, and I do believe that it's the correct result\non either basis that I have put forth for Garceau.\nQUESTION: Because even under AEDPA, if you just\ncome in at the threshold, the court -- the Federal court,\nin general, is quite liberal about letting you develop the\nfacts necessary to present your claim. It may be a\nproblem with amending a petition in habeas, but your\npoint, I take it, is that you can't envision any real harm\nto any of your clients if the starting date of AEDPA would\nbe considered the filing of the stay application and the\nrequest for counsel.\nMS. COFFIN: No.\nQUESTION: May I just ask one question? The --\nthe proceedings that took place between the appointment of\ncounsel, which involved the -- whether the -- the\nstatement as to the kind of issues and so forth and the\nState's motion to vacate the stay and so forth -- were\nthey all given the same number that Justice Ginsburg\nreferred to earlier?\nAnd then after the habeas application itself was\nfiled, was the case given a different number, or was the\nsame number continued?\nMS. COFFIN: This case has only had one number\nin district court, and it is one of the kind of ironies of\nall of this. I would have thought that the word case is\nvery obvious. You go to district court. They stamp your\npapers. You have a number. That's your district court\ncase and that's your case number. And that's the number\nthat Garceau had all the way through his district court\nproceedings. He then got a different number stamped on\nhis case by the Ninth Circuit when he was on appeal --\nQUESTION: Oh, yes --\nMS. COFFIN: -- but there's been one -- one\nnumber all the way through and you don't get a get a\ndifferent number when you file a habeas petition.\nIf there are no further questions.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Ms. Coffin.\nMs. McLean, you have 16 minutes left.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JANIS S. McLEAN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nQUESTION: Ms. McLean, we've been talking about\nthe statement of non-frivolous issues that's filed. In\nyour view -- and I -- I would assume, at least for\npurposes of my question, that AEDPA might make a\ndifference, that it might be non-frivolous before AEDPA,\nbut -- but then frivolous after. I'm assuming that could\nbe true because of clear -- clear and convincing evidence\nstanding, for instance.\nMS. McLEAN: Your Honor, I respectfully disagree\nwith that. There's nothing in AEDPA that applies\nwhatsoever to the pre-application period. The deferential\nprovisions of 2254(d) can only apply once an application\nis filed by its express terms.\nQUESTION: Well, I'm -- I -- I take it the\ndistrict court is interested. That's because they --\nthat's why they require this filing -- whether or not\nthere's going to be anything here for the court to\nadjudicate. Is there some substantial issue?\nAnd the point of my question was going to be\nlet's assume that post- and pre-AEDPA, the standard of\nfrivolity changes. Let's assume that. Or non-frivolity.\nWould you say that there is an expectation that's\nlegitimate and that exists if there's a filing of a\nstatement of non-frivolous issues pre-AEDPA and then\nbefore the complaint is filed -- before the petition is\nfiled, AEDPA comes into effect? Would you say an\nexpectation has been established?\nMS. McLEAN: No. And the reason for that is\nthat that document that is filed is so skeletal that it\nabsolutely bears no resemblance to a -- ultimately to a\npetition. Its sole purpose is to satisfy the local\ndistrict court rules that require that there be some\nshowing for the court to exercise its discretion in\nissuing a stay.\nThis Court recognized that requirement, or at\nleast a -- the discretionary nature of the State grant in\nMcFarland. This isn't something that automatically\nhappens. It's something that has to be deserved, and the\nway the local rules in -- in California work are that they\nhave to file the statement -- a specification of non-\nfrivolous claims. It doesn't ask for habeas relief. In\nthis case, it stated 2 out of ultimately 28 claims that\nwere ultimately raised. It -- it doesn't -- it's not\nlabeled a petition. There was no expectation whatsoever\nby Mr. Garceau that that was treated as any sort of a\npetition --\nQUESTION: The only expectation is you'll get a\nstay until you file your petition.\nMS. McLEAN: Exactly. That was its sole\npurpose. There's absolutely nothing that is in --\ncontained in chapter 153 that has anything to do with the\npre-application proceedings.\nQUESTION: Well, why -- why --\nQUESTION: Would you just confirm for me the --\nthe language of 153 applies to an application for a writ\nof habeas corpus. Okay. That's (d) and also (e) in a\nproceeding instituted by an application for a writ of\nhabeas corpus. Now, that -- that was not quite the\nlanguage involved in McFarland, was it? What was the\nlanguage involved in McFarland?\nMS. McLEAN: In McFarland, this Court was\nconstruing the term post-conviction proceeding and\nsaying -- because 848 -- 21 U.S.C. 848 --\nQUESTION: Before whom a habeas corpus\nproceeding is pending. I think --\nMS. McLEAN: That is actually the -- the\ncompanion provision, the State provision, in 2251. The\nprovision in 21 U.S.C. 848 specifies that there's an\nentitlement to an appointment of counsel in a\npost-conviction proceeding --\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMS. McLEAN: -- under -- arising under 2254 or\n2255.\nQUESTION: So you think instituted by an\napplication for a writ of habeas corpus means just that.\nIt has to be instituted by the application.\nMS. McLEAN: It's extremely explicit. And it\nalso is consistent with how we're treating all other\nhabeas cases.\nQUESTION: Can you -- forgetting the -- the --\nI -- I'm still slightly confused on what I'd call the\npractical point. Imagine on January 1, before AEDPA is\npassed, they file a petition -- no, not a petition --\na petition for a lawyer. And there's stay applications.\nAnd everything under the sun is litigated on that stay\napplication, as it often is in a capital case. On June 1,\nonce the stay was granted, they file their official habeas\npetition. On December 1, AEDPA is enacted. Now, the\nquestion is whether AEDPA will govern future proceedings\nin the case. And what we've said is it doesn't govern\nthose future proceedings if, in fact, that petition had\nbeen filed on June 1. Right?\nMS. McLEAN: Well, this Court hasn't -- that's\nwhat this case --\nQUESTION: No. I'm saying the petition for\nhabeas.\nwas there. The petition for habeas was filed on June 1.\nThe petition for the lawyer and so forth was filed\n6 months before. Am I right? Am I right? Maybe I mixed\nup that.\nMS. McLEAN: I -- I -- in all -- the only cases\nthat this Court has addressed is in the non-capital\ncontext, and you have -- you've said that AEDPA applies\nonce the filed petition is -- if the filed petition\noccurred prior to the enactment of AEDPA --\nQUESTION: If the filed -- the habeas petition\napplies -- was filed, and habeas proceedings are underway,\nand then later on AEDPA is enacted, does AEDPA apply?\nMS. McLEAN: Once -- if the habeas petition --\nQUESTION: Yes, the habeas petition.\nMS. McLEAN: -- the application for merits is\nfiled before --\nQUESTION: Before AEDPA.\nMS. McLEAN: -- the enactment of AEDPA, yes,\nthere -- that is not an AEDPA case in --\nQUESTION: Thank you.\nNow, what I'm saying is -- is January 1, they\nask for a lawyer and then they go through the stay. On\nJune 1 they file the habeas petition. On December 1,\nAEDPA is enacted. Now, we don't apply it to that case\nbecause the habeas proceeding was underway.\nMS. McLEAN: That's correct.\nQUESTION: All right. Why don't we? Because\nthat judge might have made up his mind about various\nthings because there could have been things decided. Now,\nwhy isn't precisely the same thing true as to the period\nJanuary 1 to June 1, where all kinds of things were\ndecided, the stay was litigated, the judge has made up his\nmind, who knows how it affected the future proceedings?\nThat's what -- do you see the question?\nMS. McLEAN: I do.\nQUESTION: What's the answer?\nMS. McLEAN: Respectfully, though, I believe\nthat that ignores the express wording of -- of AEDPA.\nQUESTION: I get the linguistic point. That's\nwhy I said that I wanted to know the practical point,\nwhich I think maybe Justice Kennedy's question was trying\nto get at; I'm trying to get at.\nMS. McLEAN: Practically also, there is no --\nwhatever litigation might occur with regard to the State\nproceedings has nothing to do with the merits of the case\nwhich is what AEDPA goes to. So there can be no harm.\nThe fact that this was tremendously litigated State\nproceedings doesn't decide any issues that ultimately will\nbe affected by AEDPA. So there's no harm whatsoever.\nQUESTION:\nState proceeding as, quote, tremendously litigated, close.\nWhat did that -- what did that involve?\nMS. McLEAN: And in our -- I'm not saying that\nthat happened in our case. I think that usually they\ndon't have -- there's virtually no litigation involved.\nIn this case, what happened was that they're\nrequired under our local rules to present the\nSpecification of Non-frivolous Issues. They have to at\nleast put in one or two of the claims that are ultimately\ngoing to be raised. They didn't file anything. What they\nfiled was a conclusory statement that there were\nconstitutional claims that would be made. And we objected\nto that rightfully because they didn't satisfy our local\nrules. And so, it was that -- that was the sum total of\nour litigation related to the State proceedings. It\ncertainly doesn't create -- nothing occurred in this case\nthat would affect in any way --\nQUESTION: Wasn't there also a request for\nfunds?\nMS. McLEAN: There was -- there was a request\nfor funds under -- there was a request for funds under\n848.\nQUESTION: And that was before the -- before the\nhabeas corpus petition was filed, yes.\nMS. McLEAN: That's correct. Under 848 because\nof -- it's part of that -- or that post-conviction\nproceeding that was construed in McFarland.\nQUESTION: I thought what had happened here was\nthat the petitioner asks for a lawyer and a stay, and then\nthe district court granted the stay. Then the State came\nin and said, we want you to vacate the stay. And then,\nthe district court asked the petitioner to file the non-\nfrivolous issues, et cetera, and so there was a\nconsiderable argument about whether the stay should be\nvacated or not vacated, which I guess eventually the\npetitioner won.\nMS. McLEAN: I think --\nQUESTION: It sounded to me like a fairly\nsubstantial proceeding.\nMS. McLEAN: I think that overstates the\nsituation.\nQUESTION: What is it now?\nMS. McLEAN: We filed papers that objected to\nthe fact that the stay had been granted based on a\nfailure -- failure to comply with the local rules. And we\nfiled papers that stated that and the court ruled against\nus because they corrected the deficiency, and that's all\nthat happened.\nQUESTION: But you say that whether or not this\ncase is governed by AEDPA, AEDPA has no effect whatever on\nall of that.\nMS. McLEAN: AEDPA does --\nQUESTION: By its terms, it simply does not\naffect it.\nMS. McLEAN: That's correct. And that is really\ndemonstrated -- also another a twist on that is that an\n848 appointment, by its very terms -- if you look at\n848(q)(9), I believe is the provision, it talks about how\na -- how the appointment of counsel survives the habeas\nproceeding. It goes on. The appointment continues on\ninto clemency proceedings and competency proceedings and\nother things. So clearly this is sort of an independent\ntrack. There's an appointment of counsel. It includes\nthat habeas corpus proceeding under chapter 153, and then\nit survives and may go on into other areas.\nIt also would survive the dismissal of a\npetition. We've had experiences in the Ninth Circuit\nwhere the petition that ultimately ends up being filed is\ndeficient. It gets dismissed out. They go back into\nState court and they've allowed them to continue with that\nappointment of counsel. And so it continues on. It\nclearly is a separate phenomenon.\nQUESTION: But doesn't it --\nQUESTION: Suppose Garceau had filed a\nhandwritten thing, and he called it petition for habeas\ncorpus, and it had the same thing as the statement of\nissues?\nMS. McLEAN: I think he would have -- if --\nassuming that it had been -- asked for relief and stated\nat least one claim with a summary of facts, fact pleading\nthat's required --\nQUESTION: Would there have been a problem then\nfor counsel, once counsel is appointed? And my scenario\nis Garceau files his own petition, it's handwritten, and\nit's got one -- one issue. Then the lawyer is appointed,\nand a Dandy petition is filed with 28 issues. Would\nthat -- would be any problem about that being considered a\nsuccessive petition?\nMS. McLEAN: No. In my experience with the\nNinth Circuit, they're very liberal in that situation. It\noccurs frequently. Especially in non-capital cases where\na -- a petitioner is initially unrepresented and files a\nlimited petition, the court's very liberal about granting\nthe ability to amend the petitions later. They're not\nconsidered successive.\nQUESTION: Is it ultimately beside the point\nthat AEDPA itself doesn't say anything about this -- the\nso-called pre-petition, the stay stage? Because if your\nstay is dependent upon the Specification of Non-frivolous\nIssues, and frivolousness has some reference to the\nstandards that you're going to have to meet for success\nand AEDPA affects those standards, doesn't, as a matter\nof -- of implication, doesn't AEDPA affect your\nfrivolousness standard and hence have at least a potential\neffect at the stay point?\nMS. McLEAN: Your Honor, I don't believe that\nthat's the case. The -- the non-frivolous issue\nstandard -- very low. They're just trying to make sure\nthat there's some colorable claim, that -- that the stay\nis not being just granted on something that has -- that is\njust air.\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMS. McLEAN: They want something there so that\nthe court is reasonably exercising its stay discretion\nand -- and appointment of counsel discretion.\nThat's a substantially -- that's unaffected, in\nmy opinion -- unaffected and substantially different than\nthe question that comes up once the merits petition is on\nfile, and we're looking to see whether or not this is --\nthis is -- there's a valid constitutional violation --\nQUESTION: Oh, I -- I quite agree. But if -- if\nthe State decided that it simply was going to be less\ncomplacent at the stage at which there is a request for\nstay and said, okay, we're going -- we're going to start\ncontesting the non-frivolous character of these -- these\nclaims that are being raised, number one, wouldn't the\nState be able to do that if it thought it was worthwhile\nto spend its time doing that? And number two, if it did\nthat, wouldn't the ultimate standard of persuasion that\nAEDPA applies have an effect on -- on the argument that\nyou would make as to what was or was non-frivolous at that\nstage?\nMS. McLEAN: A State could do that. The --\nI don't believe, again, though, that AEDPA has any\napplication to that. The question -- all we would be\nlooking at at that phase is whether there's enough to\njustify the stay.\nThe -- AEDPA goes to the issue of whether the --\nyou know, what the State court adjudication of the claim\nwas and whether it was a -- involved a reasonable\napplication of Supreme Court precedent and an entirely\ndifferent analysis. I don't believe that there was,\na) any intent to affect that, or any actual effect\nwhatsoever from changing the deference that's ultimately\napplied to a merits petition to have any effect whatsoever\non that initial inquiry that a -- that our courts in\nCalifornia require in order to satisfy the stay\nrequirement, or the --\nQUESTION: In any event, you're saying it isn't\nhaving an effect. It -- it --\nMS. McLEAN: I'm sorry.\nQUESTION: You're saying that, in fact, in\nCalifornia, it is not having such an effect.\nMS. McLEAN: It is not.\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMS. McLEAN: Thank you, Your Honor. If\nthere's --\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Ms. McLean.\n"
