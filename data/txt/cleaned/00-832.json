Gulf Power Company.\nMr. Feldman.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES A. FELDMAN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS IN NO. 00-843\nMR. FELDMAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nUnder the Pole Attachments Act, the FCC is\nrequired to regulate pole attachments to ensure the rates,\nterms, and conditions for those attachments be just and\nreasonable.\nThe question presented in this case is whether\ntwo particular types of attachments are covered by the\nact.\nThe first is an attachment to provide cable\ntelevision service and commingled Internet access. That\nmeans that over that particular wire at the particular\ntime is traveling both cable television service and\nInternet access at different frequencies.\nThe second type of attachment at issue is an\nattachment used to provide wireless telecommunications\nservices.\nThe FCC determined and the most natural reading\nof the act requires that both types of attachments are\ncovered. The operative provision, the basic coverage\nprovision, defines a pole attachment as any attachment by\na cable television system or provider of\ntelecommunications service.\nQUESTION: Where do we find the text of the act?\nMR. FELDMAN: In the appendix to our petition\nfor certiorari, right at the end. The language that I'm\ntalking about now is on page 205a.\nQUESTION: Is it in your brief?\nMR. FELDMAN: I'm sure it's in our brief also,\nbut it's not -- it's not separately set forth in an\nappendix there.\nQUESTION: Go ahead.\nMR. FELDMAN: But the -- and the section I'm\nreferring to now is section 224(a)(4). It says, the term\npole attachment means any attachment by a cable television\nsystem or provider of telecommunications service to a\npole, duct, conduit, or right-of-way owned or controlled\nby a utility.\nQUESTION: And don't you think it's implicit in\nthat definition that it mean not just an attachment by,\nbut also an attachment for the purpose of the business of?\nMR. FELDMAN: I think it's -- what is --\nQUESTION: They couldn't put up a billboard, you\nknow -- you know.\nMR. FELDMAN: Right. I think that the use of\nthe term, in particular, cable television system, it has\nto be part of the cable television system, which could be\nreasonably construed to mean the -- the network of -- of\ndevices that are used to provide cable television system\nservice to people. I think that's correct, and I think\nprobably the same thing is true with the\ntelecommunications --\nQUESTION: Telecommunications.\nMR. FELDMAN: -- provider of telecommunications\nservices.\nBut I -- what I would contrast -- what's at\nissue here is these attachments are used to provide\ncommingled cable television and Internet access.\nQUESTION: Now, is -- is Internet access part of\na cable television system?\nMR. FELDMAN: The FCC hasn't reached a\nconclusion on that yet because what the FCC concluded --\nand I think what the most natural reading of the statute\nleads to the conclusion as well -- that if an attachment\nis an attachment that's used to provide cable television\nsystem service, the fact -- or it's used by a cable\ntelevision system, the fact that it's also used for\nsomething else doesn't exclude that attachment from the\nact.\nQUESTION: Oh, that's fair enough.\nBut what if -- what if it not only is added to\nthe cable television system, but it also in itself\nconsists of telecommunications?\nMR. FELDMAN: If it still is -- well, it would\nstill be. Then it would be covered under -- under either\nprovision of the act.\nQUESTION: Well, it would be covered under (e),\nunder -- under the telecommunications rate. Right?\nMR. FELDMAN: Well, I wouldn't quite say that.\nThe rate would have to be determined under (e), and I\nwould agree with you on that. But the act -- it concerns\nrates, terms, and conditions and also mandatory access.\nAnd in terms of the basic coverage of the act, what\nparticular rate --\nQUESTION: Okay. But we're talking about the\nrates here. I mean, that's -- that's the fighting issue.\nAnd -- and why -- how could the -- the thing I\nreally do not understand about this case is how the\ncommission could possibly resolve it without ever\npurporting to decide whether Internet is\ntelecommunications. It has -- it has purported to reserve\nthat question, hasn't it?\nMR. FELDMAN: I -- I wouldn't quite put it that\nway. I think what the commission did, if you look at\nparagraph 33 and 34 of its order in this case, is what\nthey said is --\nQUESTION: Where do we find that?\nMR. FELDMAN: That is on page 80 -- the best\nplace to start with is 87a at paragraph 33. That's of our\nappendix.\nWhat they say is, several commentators suggested\nthat cable operators providing Internet service should be\nrequired to pay the section 224(e) telecommunications\nrate. We disagree.\nAnd then they cite a prior order, the Universal\nService Order, where the -- in which the FCC concluded\nthat based on the statutory definition of\ntelecommunications, cable service is not\ntelecommunications. And they concluded that based on the\nproposition that -- that -- under the statutory\ndefinition, telecommunications requires no change in the\nmaterial transmitted back and forth.\nQUESTION: Okay. But you think that -- that\nissue is up in this case, then, whether -- whether --\nMR. FELDMAN: No.\nQUESTION: -- indeed, Internet service is\ntelecommunications?\nMR. FELDMAN: No, I don't think so for this\nreason.\nQUESTION: Well, you're saying that the -- that\nthe decision here rests upon that.\nMR. FELDMAN: No. Excuse me. I don't -- I\nwouldn't say that's up in this case for this reason. The\n-- these -- what the court of appeals held is that these\nwires are not covered by the act at all. They're simply\nnot covered, not under the (d) rate, not under the (e)\nrate. A utility can charge a -- an attach -- or a cable\ntelevision system whatever rate it wants, $50, $100, or\n$1,000. It doesn't matter. The FCC has no jurisdiction.\nQUESTION: Well, but the issue is here not\nwhether the court of appeals was right; it's whether the\ncommission was wrong.\nMR. FELDMAN: Right, but the rate issue was --\nthe -- the court of appeals did not -- did not address --\nand I don't even think was presented to the court of\nappeals -- what the proper rate is to apply.\nThe question is whether the FCC has jurisdiction\nover these attachments at all, and these are attachments\nby a cable television system or provider of\ntelecommunications service. And if you look at the -- the\n-- that coverage provision in (a)(4) that I was referring\nto before, if it turns out that Internet access is\ntelecommunications service, if it were to turn out that\nway, then the act would then -- the attachment would be -\n- would be protected under both halves of that. It would\nboth be an attachment by a cable television system; it\nwould also be an attachment by a provider of\ntelecommunications service.\nQUESTION: Yes, but theoretically it could be --\ntheoretically it could be neither.\nMR. FELDMAN: It theoretically could be neither.\nQUESTION: All right. And don't you think, as a\nresult of that, we don't know? We cannot tell. We cannot\ninfer from -- from what the agency did what its view was\non this, which is -- at least is consistent with the fact\nthat it's got another proceeding going on to -- to get\ninto the definitional matter.\nMR. FELDMAN: I don't think that that's correct.\nQUESTION: Doesn't it make sense for us to say\nto the agency, you've got to explain to us what you at\nleast believe your jurisdictional basis is for this\nbecause, depending on whether your jurisdictional basis is\nthe general provision or (d) or (e) may affect that --\nthat may -- the result in this case could be dependent on\nthat. And we should know.\nMR. FELDMAN: I think the agency was very clear\nthat its basis for jurisdiction is (a)(4), which is the\nbasic coverage provision of the act, and --\nQUESTION: All right. Then that -- then that\nforces -- in other words, you're saying the agency made it\nclear that it was neither (d) nor (e).\nMR. FELDMAN: No.\nQUESTION: All right, and I agree.\nMR. FELDMAN: No. That's not quite right.\nQUESTION: You can infer -- you're right. You\ncan infer that --\nMR. FELDMAN: I don't know -- I'll tell you what\nthe agency said. What they said was it's not (e) based on\nthis past precedent, which Congress has now asked us to\nlook into and we're now looking into it once again. We\nmay change our mind, but as of now, it's not (e).\nQUESTION: But it could be (d).\nMR. FELDMAN: And they said it could be (d)\nbecause we're not -- we don't have to decide whether it is\na -- whether the Internet access part of it is a provision\n-- is a cable service because if it's a cable service,\nit's covered under the terms of (d). If it's not a cable\nservice, we're going to apply the just and reasonable rate\nas being the same thing --\nQUESTION: Okay, but if it's -- if it's under\n(d), we review it strictly within (d) terms. But if we\ndon't know whether they're acting under (d) or whether\nthey're acting under the general just and reasonable\npower, then we've got to decide another issue. We've got\nto decide whether, in fact, there's anything left under\nthe general power, and if we decide that and say the\nanswer is no, only then do we get to the question whether\nthis -- whether this is a proper jurisdictional exercise\nunder (d).\nAnd we should not have to go, it seems to me,\nthrough that sort of byzantine reverse decisional tree\nwhen the agency itself could tell us up front what it was\nacting under. And, therefore, I'm suggesting that maybe\non this part of the case, the wise thing to do would be to\nvacate, send the thing back, and say, tell us -- you know,\ncome to grips with us and tell us what you believe you're\noperating under and we'll review that.\nMR. FELDMAN: But I -- I think the agency was\nquite clear, and they pinned their decision --\nQUESTION: They were quite clear that it wasn't\n(e), but they're not quite clear on anything else.\nMR. FELDMAN: Right, but the question of then\nwhether it's (d) or not is -- just has to do with the\nquestion of what the right rate is. What the agency was\n100 percent clear on was this is an attachment by a cable\ntelevision system, and therefore, the FCC has authority to\nprovide for just and reasonable rates. I would add --\nQUESTION: Mr. Feldman, are you saying that it's\nan academic question what the precise rate is when we're\ndealing with a court of appeals decision that says that's\nirrelevant because there is no authority at all in the\nFCC?\nMR. FELDMAN: And I'd like to address that. I\nthink that the point is that is not a -- even almost not a\n-- probably not a possible reading of the statute, and\ncertainly not the one that the FCC -- once the FCC adopted\na contrary one --\nQUESTION: So, you're asking us to say that the\nFCC does have authority. Which particular rate category\nit falls under is for another day.\nMR. FELDMAN: That's right.\nQUESTION: But the basic question is does it\nhave any authority to come up with a just and reasonable\nrate at all.\nMR. FELDMAN: That's correct. And I would --\nQUESTION: But it's also the case that we are\nbeing forced to decide an issue which, if the agency were\nclear and came out and said it's (d), we wouldn't have to\ndecide.\nMR. FELDMAN: I -- I don't think that that's\nright because whether the agency says it's (d) or not, the\nfact is that (a)(4) covers this. And let me -- let me\ngive this as an illustration.\nQUESTION: Well, yes, but that's the -- that's\none of the issues.\nMR. FELDMAN: I realize that, but that -- that\nissue, it seems to me, is not a difficult one. If you\nlook at (d), for example, (d) -- Congress knew quite well,\nwhen it was dealing with rates, not when it was dealing\nwith terms, conditions, or mandatory access, which are\nalso at issue in the statute -- when it was dealing with\nrates, it was quite clear this subsection -- that's (d)(3)\n-- shall apply to the rate for any pole attachment used by\na cable television system solely to provide a cable\nservice.\nNow, if Congress wanted to limit the -- the\ncoverage -- the general coverage of the act, it could have\nused exactly that same language, and in (a)(4), it could\nhave said, the term pole attachment means any attachment\nby a cable television system used solely to provide cable\nservice. But Congress actually made a distinct choice.\nFor purposes of the rate, it did want that to govern, and\nit had a reason for doing that, which I can go into.\nQUESTION: I can give you -- I can give you\nanother -- another plausible explanation. Indeed, I think\nit's -- it's to my mind the most plausible explanation. I\nthink Congress divides the world -- the world -- of what\ncan go on poles into cable and telecommunications. There\nare these two categories. That's the only reason people\nare going to string wires: cable or telecommunications.\nThen when it got to prescribing the rates, what\nare you going to do with something that overlaps between\nthe two? You can provide one rate for cable, another rate\nfor telecommunications. What about one that is both? You\nsolve that question by, in the first rate section, saying\nif it's cable only, it has this rate, and if it's\ntelecommunications, which is everything else, including\nthe mingling of telecommunications with cable, it's\nanother rate. That would be a perfectly plausible\nexplanation of why Congress put cable only in the later\nsection and in the earlier section just talked about cable\nbecause it thought anything else that cable does will be\ntelecommunications.\nMR. FELDMAN: Well, if Congress thought that --\nagain, the result of -- of if that were true could be that\nthe (e) rate might apply to this thing, but it would still\nbe that the (e) rate applied. It would not be that this\n-- that these attachments are not protected at all.\nAnd I would add that in 1996, when Congress\npassed this statute, the FCC had already determined in\nseveral cases that a cable attachment that's also used to\nprovide data transmission services was still an attachment\nby a cable television system and still entitled to the\nprotection of the Pole Attachment Act. That -- that\ndecision was affirmed by the D.C. Circuit in the Texas\nUtilities case in 1993, and the FCC had applied it in\nseveral cases after that.\nSo, by the time Congress -- and Congress did not\nchange any of the relevant language that was important for\nthat decision. It still left it the pole attachment means\nany attachment by a cable television system.\nI mean, I would add if the -- whatever the FCC\nis to -- is going to determine about what the Internet\naccess is, whatever they would determine about that, the\nattachment would still be an attachment by a cable\ntelevision system. I don't see how you can construe it to\nmean it's not any longer an attachment by a cable\ntelevision system. It may be something else as well.\nQUESTION: But let's assume that the FCC\ndetermines that this is not telecommunications --\nMR. FELDMAN: And I think they have\ndetermined --\nQUESTION: -- and it's not -- and it's not\ncable, and you have a hybrid cable. Would the commission\nbe within its authority to charge the cable company more\nfor the hybrid cable than it does for the regular cable?\nMR. FELDMAN: If it turned out that this\nadditional -- the addition of Internet access meant that\nit was neither cable nor telecommunications service --\nthat that additional service was neither -- neither of\nthose, then the FCC would have to figure out what the just\nand reasonable rate would be for that. And they would\nhave a range of choices, and they'd have to justify\nwhat --\nQUESTION: So, it could charge more for a hybrid\nthan for a pure cable.\nMR. FELDMAN: It's possible the FCC could do\nthat. And I'll tell you why the FCC didn't and why the\nstatute --\nQUESTION: But I'm -- I'm wondering why that can\nbe because it has no jurisdiction over pure Internet.\nMR. FELDMAN: No. But this is the point, and I\nthink -- I think this is crucial and this is the mistake\nthe court of appeals made. The court of appeals started\nby saying the question in this case is whether the FCC has\njurisdiction over Internet access. The FCC doesn't\npurport to have jurisdiction over Internet access. And if\nyou were dealing with a wire that only provided Internet\naccess, that would be a completely different question.\nQUESTION: I agree, but then my question is why\ncan it possibly charge more for the hybrid cable.\nMR. FELDMAN: Well, you know, I don't want to\njustify that decision because what the FCC decided is that\nthat wouldn't be what it would want to do. If -- it\ndecided that if it's a hybrid like that --\nQUESTION: Well, but --\nQUESTION: It's even worse. They're -- they're\nsaying even though the section says you charge this rate\nwhen it's cable only, we're going to say you can charge\nthis rate when it's cable plus Internet. You think that's\nbetter.\nMR. FELDMAN: Yes, because I think that what\nCongress wanted to specify when it said when it's cable\nonly is it wanted to ensure that -- and this is actually\nfairly clear -- is when the cable companies went into --\ninto the business of providing telephone service to\npeople, that they would be charged the same rate as the\ntelecommunications providers who were newly added to the\nact.\nBut that was not their intent. With -- with\nrespect to Internet access, they didn't have a specific\nintent like that. They had an intent that Internet access\nshould be characterized however it should be\ncharacterized.\nWhat you do know is that if, at one and the same\ntime over that same wire, are proceeding -- is a -- a\ncable television service and Internet access, it is an\nattachment by a cable television system. And the fact\nthat the cable television system is providing something\nelse through that wire doesn't preclude the application of\n-- of -- doesn't preclude the FCC's jurisdiction.\nQUESTION: If you ignore the doctrine inclusio\nunius, exclusio alterius, and you say these are the rates\nwhen it's cable only.\nMR. FELDMAN: But that's --\nQUESTION: And the FCC has come and said, these\nare also the rates when it's cable plus.\nMR. FELDMAN: But that's again -- that could\nlead --\nQUESTION: It seems to me a little strange.\nMR. FELDMAN: If that were true, that could lead\nto the conclusion that the FCC's choice of rate here was\nwrong and maybe it should have chosen the (e) rate or some\nother rate. But that couldn't lead to the conclusion that\nan attachment by a cable television system is outside the\nact. And in fact, if it were outside the act, it's --\nit's not -- it's very difficult to understand why Congress\ndidn't take that solely by a cable -- solely to provide\ncable television services and put it right here in (a)(4)\nin the basic coverage provision.\nQUESTION: Mr. Feldman, do I understand your\nargument that if we should reverse the Eleventh Circuit\nand say there is FCC jurisdiction, then it would go --\nthen it would have to await your ongoing rule making to\ndetermine which category this is, or would there be\nsomething for the Eleventh Amendment to do on remand once\nwe say you have jurisdiction to do something?\nMR. FELDMAN: I think that -- that if the issue\nwas preserved before the Eleventh Circuit, they would have\njurisdiction to determine what the right rate is, and look\nat what the FCC's reasoning was and whether -- you know,\nthe various conclusions the FCC reached in coming to the\n(d) rate.\nI'd like to reserve -- well, maybe I should\naddress the other issue just for a minute. The other\nissue seems -- is -- really rests on the same basic\npremise, which is an attachment by a wireless\ntelecommunications provider is an attachment by a\ntelecommunications provider. The statute defines the\nprovision of telecommunications service as the offering of\ntelecommunications to the public regardless of the\nfacilities used, and it therefore precludes making a\ndistinction between wireless and wireline\ntelecommunications providers.\nI'd like to reserve the balance of my time.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Feldman.\nMr. Keisler, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF PETER D. KEISLER\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER IN NO. 00-832\nMR. KEISLER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe central feature of the provisions of this\nact that define its scope, sections 224(a)(4) and (b)(1),\nis that the threshold question of whether an attachment is\ncovered by the act turns on the nature of the facility not\non what service is provided over that facility. Section\n(a)(4) defines pole attachment as any attachment by a\ncable television system. And, Justice Scalia, cable\nsystem is a defined term in the act. Section 522,\nsubsection 7 defines a cable system as the physical\nequipment that constitutes the cable network. It's on --\nQUESTION: You say the attachment of a cable\nsystem. It says an attachment by a cable system. You\nmake a big deal of that in -- in the brief, and I don't\nsee that it makes any difference whether it says cable\ncompany or cable system. It is still an attachment by a\ncable either company or system. It doesn't say the\nattachment of a cable system.\nMR. KEISLER: Well, it's an attachment by a\ncable television system to the pole, and the system itself\nis defined as a set of closed transmission paths and\nassociated signal and generation/reception control\nequipment that is designed to provide cable services which\ninclude video programming. These wires which are attached\nto the poles are one of those closed transmission paths\nthat constitute the cable system under that definition.\nNow, it's -- it's not the case I think, Justice\nScalia, that Congress could have divided the world solely\ninto cable services and telecommunications services\nbecause there are lots of services that don't fit either\ndefinition. Telecommunications service is the offering of\ntelecommunications, which is defined in section 153 of the\nact as the transmission of information of the user's\nchoosing without change in the form or content.\nInternet access, the commission has found,\nchanges the form of the information. An Internet service\nprovider engages in something called protocol conversion\nso that the message that goes out from your computer can\nactually talk to the service and computers that comprise\nthe worldwide web. So, it is not a telecommunications\nservice. The commission correctly found that.\nAnd applying telecommunications service\nregulation to everything that's not a cable service would\nmean applying a whole host of legacy telecommunications\nstatutes and rules to a whole sector of the economy that\nhas always been unregulated, information service\nproviders.\nAnd, Justice Souter, I don't think a remand to\nthe FCC would be appropriate. Essentially -- unless you\nconclude that they're wrong on the theory of the case on\nwhich they resolved it.\nBut you suggested, Your Honor, that the\ncommission could have reached the same result through an\nalternative path. It could have said, well, this is a\ncable service, therefore the (e) rate applies.\nBut I think the question for this appeal is was\nit arbitrary or capricious or contrary to law for the\ncommission to resolve the case the way it did. If the\ncommission's legal interpretation of section (a)(4) is\ncorrect, that it applies to any attachment by a cable\ntelevision system, and a cable system includes wires that\ncommingle Internet access and video programming, then it's\nnot arbitrary or capricious or contrary to law for the\ncommission to resolve the case the way it did. And I\nthink beyond that, it was perfectly reasonable.\nThe question of whether this is a cable service\nis a very big question with immense regulatory\nconsequences that determines again whether a whole host of\nregulations that go well beyond the Pole Attachment Act\nwill be applied to this service. The commission said we\ndon't need to decide that here since we would choose to\napply the (d) rate anyway. We'll postpone that to a later\nproceeding where we can gather a record. That proceeding\nis going on now, and that's going to be resolved in that\nproceeding.\nQUESTION: But -- but that means that they can\nget away with it only if they are correct that -- in\nchoosing to apply the (d) rate.\nMR. KEISLER: It means --\nQUESTION: If that selection of the (d) rate is\nwrong, then their assumption that they don't have to get\ninto that question is also wrong.\nMR. KEISLER: It could only be wrong in two\ncircumstances. It could be wrong if this were a\ntelecommunications service, and no one has sought cert on\nthe ground that the commission erred in finding this\nwasn't a telecommunications service. Or it could be wrong\nbecause it was arbitrary and capricious for them to\nexercise their authority under subsection (b) to choose\nthis particular rate rather than another rate. But again,\nnobody has sought review on that question before the court\nof appeals or before this Court.\nThe sole claim that respondents made in their\npetition for review is that we are out of the statute\nentirely, completely unregulated, that we get kicked off\nthe system the instant we provide any service other than\ncable only or telecommunications. And that's just not a\nplausible reading of the statute. They have not been able\nto posit a single plausible purpose for that result. In\nfact, their brief actually refers to it as an\nunanticipated consequence of the way the statute is\nwritten.\nBut we know the Congress wanted to promote\nInternet access. It said so in the statute itself,\nsection 230. We know that Congress believed that cable\ntelevision systems needed continued rights to access\npoles. It said so in 224. The only way to serve both\nobjectives is to cover commingled attachments.\nQUESTION: You say they haven't sought cert on\nit, but -- but they're -- they're the respondents here. I\nmean, they --\nMR. KEISLER: Oh, I'm sorry. They didn't\npetition for review before the Eleventh Circuit. There's\nno claim ever in this case that the utilities have made\nthat the commission chose the wrong rate.\nQUESTION: Well, but it seems to me they're --\nthey're entitled to defend the -- the outcome below on any\n-- on any ground.\nMR. KEISLER: But they haven't defended on that\nground, Justice Scalia. They've said, we're out of the\nstatute entirely. They haven't said, choose a different\nrate. They said the commission has no authority to set\nany rate at all.\nAnd that can't have been Congress' purpose.\nCongress has always understood that the cable wire into\nthe home is potentially capable of carrying many, many\nservices other than simply television programs. That's\nwhy they were so careful to define cable system as a\nfacility designed to provide cable services which include\nvideo programming, not which are exclusively video\nprogramming, but which include video programming. There\nwas testimony before Congress, findings of the FCC that\nthe cable wire had potential of becoming a broadband\ncommunications gateway. And the packing of multiple\nservices into this wire was considered a good thing, good\nfor consumers and good for competition.\nQUESTION: Can we talk for a minute about the\nattachment of wireless --\nMR. KEISLER: No. The National Cable & --\nQUESTION: You don't care about it.\nMR. KEISLER: We don't have a position.\nQUESTION: You don't care about it.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. KEISLER: But the packing of multiple\nservices into this wire -- that was considered a good\nthing. And every one of those services is equally\ndependent on access to poles. That's why the coverage in\nthe statute turns on the nature of the facility and not\nwhat service is provided over that facility because\nwhatever the service is, if it's provided over a wired\nfacility, the poles are going to be an essential\ncommunications pathway to reach the home. And Congress\ncould not have wanted us to be kicked off the system\nsimply because we ventured beyond the two specific\nservices that they enumerated in subsections (d) or (e).\nThat doesn't make sense.\nAnd, in addition, I think it has --\nQUESTION: As far as Internet is concerned, you\nwouldn't be kicked off. If -- if Internet were\ntelecommunications, you wouldn't be kicked off.\nMR. KEISLER: No. That's right. But if\nInternet were neither telecommunications nor a cable\nservice or if we came up with another service in the\nfuture that was neither telecommunications nor a cable\nservice, then we'd be kicked off. And Internet access is\nnot a telecommunications service because the form of the\nsignal is changed by the Internet service provider. So,\nthe consequence of this really would be that we would be\nkicked off.\nIf the Court has no further questions.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Keisler.\nMr. Steindler, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS P. STEINDLER\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. STEINDLER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nI'd like to, with the Court's permission, just\nsay a few words about the wireless issue first so it\ndoesn't get lost here. It's a very important issue to the\nindustry.\nI'd like to turn again straight to -- to the\ntext of the statute, which is reprinted at the back of the\nappendix to the petition, turn first to section 224(b)(1),\nwhich provides that the commission --\nQUESTION: On page what?\nMR. STEINDLER: I'm sorry. It's at page 206a of\nthe appendix to the petition.\nQUESTION: What is --\nMR. STEINDLER: It's 47 U.S.C., section\n224(b)(1).\nQUESTION: Thank you.\nQUESTION: And the page reference again? Excuse\nme.\nMR. STEINDLER: It's 206a of the appendix to the\npetition.\n(B)(1) says, in pertinent part, that the\ncommission shall regulate the rates, terms, and conditions\nfor pole attachments. That's the general grant of\nauthority.\nPole attachments is then defined on the previous\npage in section 224(a)(4) as any attachment by a cable\ntelevision system or, in this case the pertinent -- of\npertinence, a provider of telecommunications service,\nwhich is elsewhere defined to include wireless companies.\nNow, the Government asks you to stop reading the\nstatute right here and say that any attachment means\nliterally any attachment and that that would include\nwireless equipment.\nQUESTION: It's even funnier than that. They\nacknowledge that it doesn't include billboards. It\ndoesn't include billboards.\nMR. STEINDLER: Indeed.\nQUESTION: But it includes nailing up a wireless\nthing.\nMR. STEINDLER: Well, the Government, on this\nissue and also on the Internet issue, they've -- they've\nignored some of the basic rules of reading a statute, and\nwhat they've ignored here is the basic rule that you have\nto read the whole statute and the meaning that any of the\nphrases, like any attachment here, is informed by context.\nIf you keep reading this statute, it tells you what any\nattachment means, and it tells you that, if you turn to\nsection 224(d) and (e), which are the rate sections --\nQUESTION: But before you turn to the next\nsection, staying with (a)(4) for a minute --\nMR. STEINDLER: Sure.\nQUESTION: -- it's any attachment to a pole,\nduct, conduit, or right-of-way owned or controlled by a\nutility.\nMR. STEINDLER: Correct.\nQUESTION: Does that language apply to what\nwe're talking about?\nMR. STEINDLER: Of course.\nQUESTION: Oh, okay.\nMR. STEINDLER: Of course. The utility --\nthere's a jurisdictional predicate here in (a)(1), which\nis a utility -- this is a -- I'm here representing the\nutility companies, and they own and control poles, ducts,\nconduits, or rights-of-way.\nQUESTION: So that literally the definition does\napply regardless of the purpose of the attachment.\nMR. STEINDLER: If -- if you stop reading -- if\nyou stop reading the statute there, you could come to that\nconclusion, but you need to read the whole statute, and if\nyou do, sir, with respect, in (d) and (e) are the two rate\nformulas. (D) is the rate formula for cable only, and it\nprovides for a rate that says --\nQUESTION: May I just -- may I just cut you\nshort because I want to get one thought out of my mind.\nMR. STEINDLER: Sure.\nQUESTION: Do you read it as saying provided\nthat the attachment is used either for a (d) or an (e)\npurpose?\nMR. STEINDLER: Correct.\nQUESTION: So, those are exclusive uses.\nMR. STEINDLER: Correct.\nQUESTION: Okay.\nMR. STEINDLER: And it's under the -- we'll get\nto there in a second, but it's under the --\nQUESTION: And -- and no other uses.\nMR. STEINDLER: And no other. Correct. Under\nthe exclusio unius principle, (d) and (e) are the only\npurposes that are authorized here, and others are intended\nto be excluded. You have to ignore that fundamental canon\nof reading a statute --\nQUESTION: I just wonder why.\nMR. STEINDLER: Say that again?\nQUESTION: I just wonder why. I mean, as far as\nI read (d) and (e), they address a typical, but not most\nimportant, regulatory problem. How do you divide fixed\ncosts among several different uses? It's the same problem\nwith oil wells that produce natural gas. It's the same\nproblem with chickens under price control. And (d) and\n(e) provide two ways. Nothing there purports to be the\nexclusive way. Indeed, I think an economist would say\nthat neither (d) nor (e) is the economically correct way.\nThey're approximations.\nSo, why don't we have simply here two ways among\n-- I could give you 50, frankly. So, could you. So, what\nis it that says if you happen to have this, you use this\nway; if you happen to have that, you use that way? If you\nhappen to have something we're not too interested in\nbecause it's not that common, but if you should have it,\nyou can try yet a third, a fourth, or a fifth way. That\nwould make this statute consistent with every other\nregulatory statute I know, and moreover, it would make\nsense.\nMR. STEINDLER: I think there are several\nanswers to that question. The first is that, indeed, you\nknow, you have the expressio unius doctrine, and in this\ncase, you've got Congress -- and now we're off to the\nInternet issue.\nQUESTION: We're off on the other issue.\nMR. STEINDLER: We've gotten off to the issue,\nbut let me just answer the question quickly, if I could.\nYou've got Congress providing very detailed\nformulas for two specific kinds of services that go\nthrough a wire: cable service and wire service. You have\nto ignore the expressio unius doctrine to conclude that\nthey also have authority for another type of service.\nQUESTION: Well, you -- you don't if -- if you\ncharacterize (b) the right way. You began by -- by\nsaying, before we started questioning, that (d) provides\nthe exclusive -- I think you used the word formula. But\nthat's different from the exclusive authorization to set\nrates, and the authorization is in (b). (D), as Justice\nBreyer pointed out, are two specific formulae that the\ncommission must use. But that's -- that's not necessarily\nto cover the whole universe of rate setting. So, I don't\nsee why the exclusio unius even applies.\nMR. STEINDLER: You'd have to -- in order to\ncome to that reading, you'd have to separate this -- this\nvery detailed set of rate formulas from their general\njurisdiction to regulate. In other words, you'd have to\nassume that -- that Congress intended to give jurisdiction\nthat was undefined, that was under a bare just and\nreasonable power for anything other than cable and wire\nservice. But --\nQUESTION: More than that. As one of the briefs\npoints out, you'd have to assume that for services that\nare beyond the ordinary regulatory bailiwick of the FCC,\nthe FCC has been given unrestricted powers to set rates --\nMR. STEINDLER: Right.\nQUESTION: -- whereas for those areas that are\nwithin its special expertise, cable and\ntelecommunications, Congress has specified the rates. But\nif it's beyond that in areas that you don't know squat\nabout, you can -- you can pick whatever rate you like.\nQUESTION: I'm glad you agree with that. I just\nwonder what's so odd about Congress giving regulatory\nauthority to set just and reasonable rates to a regulatory\nagency and then taking out two areas, it happens to be,\nthat the industry is particularly interested in and\nnegotiating a specific formula, while leaving others --\nI've seen it a thousand times in regulatory statutes --\nleaving others for the agency to proceed under normal,\nordinary, just, and reasonable rate setting authority.\nMR. STEINDLER: I think another answer -- and\nagain, I do want to return to the wireless issue because\nit does tend to get lost in the shuffle here.\nAnother answer is this. This is not an ordinary\nagency case. This is not a case where an agency is\nregulating an industry under its organic statute. This is\nnot Iowa Utilities. This is a case where the electric\nindustry here, which is principally regulated by other\nagencies, is now being regulated also by the FCC.\nCongress -- people were very concerned about\ngiving the -- the communications agency jurisdiction over\nthe electric industry. The White House's Office of\nTelecommunications Policy wrote two letters to Congress\nexpressing that concern when the act was being considered,\nand Congress said, in the legislative history, quite\nclearly we're giving the FCC a very narrow grant of\njurisdiction. And one of the ways that you give an agency\na narrow grant of jurisdiction is you constrain their\ndiscretion. They've given them very detailed formulas to\n-- to govern the exercise of their discretion in these two\nparticular circumstances.\nQUESTION: Yes, but it's very narrow because\nthey're only talking about attachments to utility poles.\nThey aren't talking about much else in the -- in the\nutilities business. It's a very narrow aspect of the\nutilities' overall operations.\nMR. STEINDLER: Not only are they talking about\nattachments to utility poles, but they're only talking\nabout attachments to utility poles for two kinds of\nservices.\nAnd remember this. Not everybody that has an\nattachment --\nQUESTION: Well, that's an assumption. The\nstatute doesn't really say that. It doesn't say that only\nthese two kinds of services --\nMR. STEINDLER: Well, that's -- that's --\nQUESTION: It says if you have two kinds of\nrates, these are the formulas for those two. But I don't\nsee where it totally forecloses attachments for other\npurposes.\nMR. STEINDLER: If -- well, certainly if you\nread this canon -- if you read the statute with the canon\nof expressio unius, you -- there needs to be some --\nQUESTION: Well, the expressio unius relates to\nrates. It doesn't relate to regulatory authority.\nJustice Kennedy pointed out.\nMR. STEINDLER: Well, again, you would end up --\nQUESTION: And it not only fixes rates, it\nrequires access. There are two things that the commission\ncan do. It can say you've got to let these people hook up\nto the pole and you can only charge them so much. There\nare two different things.\nMR. STEINDLER: Indeed. The statute provides a\nmandatory access provision and a rate provision. But\nagain, you have to come to the conclusion that for these\nspecific types of services that are enumerated in the\nstatute, there's a very detailed set of formulas that come\nto it. But for unenumerated services which --\nQUESTION: It's only detailed on rates. It's\nnot detailed on the access provision.\nMR. STEINDLER: Indeed, indeed.\nIf I could just return quickly back to the\nwireless issue, the -- the -- (d) and (e) provide, in a\nsense, formulas for these two types of rates. In (d), the\nattacher pays either somewhere between an incremental cost\nand a proportionate share of the useable space. In (e),\nit's a higher rate. It's a proportionate share of the\nusable space on the pole and the unusable space on the\npole. And that's reflected on page 209 of the -- of the\nappendix in -- in 224(e)(3), which reads, a utility shall\napportion the cost of providing usable space, and then the\nimmediately preceding section, 224(e)(2) talks about the\nportion of the cost of providing the space other than\nusable space.\nNow, the operative term in both (d) and (e) is\nusable space, and the statute defines usable space.\nUsable space is where attachments go. If you look at\n224(d)(2), on the -- on page 208a, the statute defines\nusable space as the space above the minimum grade level,\nwhich can be used for the attachment of wires, cables, and\nassociated equipment. That's what this statute is about:\nwires, cables, and associated equipment.\nQUESTION: Now, what you mean by associated\nequipment, I suppose, is -- I don't know -- joint boxes,\nlightening arresters, things of that sort.\nMR. STEINDLER: Associated equipment is\nequipment that is used to make the wires and the cables\nwork.\nQUESTION: Why couldn't associated equipment\nmean for the -- for a wireless company -- I guess very few\nof these wireless companies are entirely wireless. Some\n-- some portions of their system go over wire.\nMR. STEINDLER: Correct.\nQUESTION: So, why couldn't the wireless boxes\nthat they nail on these -- on these poles as pole\nattachment be deemed associated equipment of these wires\nthat they use elsewhere?\nMR. STEINDLER: Well, again, it's wires, cables,\nand associated equipment, and not equipment and -- and\nassociated wires and cables.\nThe FCC has never until its -- the Government's\nreply brief --\nQUESTION: You think it has to be associated\nwith the very wires and cables that -- that are attached?\nMR. STEINDLER: Of course. Under just familiar\nejusdem generis principles, in that phrase, wires, cables,\nand associated equipment, the associated equipment is\nsubordinate to the words that precede it and is delimited\nby those two words.\nThe Government argues for the first time, in its\nreply brief, that -- that wires and cable -- or that --\nthat wireless equipment ought to be able to come within\nthe scope of associated equipment here. And they argue,\nwell, much like Justice Scalia just -- just mentioned,\nthey could be the -- the same shape. You might have a\npiece of wireless equipment that's the same shape as the\nkinds of things like mounting brackets or splice boxes\nthat are used as associated equipment.\nBut leaving aside the fact that this just\noccurred to the Government here in its reply brief, a\ntoaster is the same shape. It has a box-like shape, but\nno one would really argue that it is associated equipment\nwithin the meaning of the phrase.\nThis -- this issue with the wireless issue\nreally boils down to the question here of whether\nassociated equipment is wireless. We submit to you that\nit can't be. That conclusion is buttressed by the\ndefinition of utility in this act. The definition of\nutility --\nQUESTION: I'm lost. Can you just tell me,\nwhere does the term, associated equipment -- what section\nwas that in?\nMR. STEINDLER: It's in section 224(d)(2) on\npage 208a of the --\nQUESTION: I've got you.\nMR. STEINDLER: You've got it? Okay.\nIf you turn to the definition of utility, which\nis in -- at the beginning of the statute, 224(a)(1) on\npage 205a, it reads in pertinent part that a utility is a\nperson who owns poles, ducts, conduits, and rights-of-way\nused, in whole or in part, for wire communications. It\ndoesn't say wireless communications. It doesn't say\ncommunications. It says wire communications. And that\ncertainly supports the negative inference that the court\nbelow drew from this language that we're talking about\nwire communications in this statute, not wireless\nequipment.\nQUESTION: Yes, but when -- given -- given the\nfact, as somebody pointed out -- I guess Justice Scalia\npointed out earlier -- the wireless companies always have\nsome wires. Why isn't the existence of -- of that wire\nportion of their equipment sufficient to fit within the\nstatute?\nMR. STEINDLER: Two things. First of all, again\nwe're talking about wires, cables, and equipment that's\nassociated with that. And the -- the -- the particular\nwires that are associated with a wireless antenna, which\nrun down the pole --\nQUESTION: You mean it's going to be a wire on\nthe pole or -- or associated --\nMR. STEINDLER: Correct. It's got to be a --\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. STEINDLER: Right. That's our argument.\nAnd I think also one last quick point on -- on\nwireless. What the Government is doing here -- the FCC is\nmaking a revolutionary expansion in its jurisdiction.\nWireless antennas are ubiquitous, and what the FCC has\nsaid is that we're going to regulate a very narrow portion\nof the wireless siting market, i.e., just those wireless\nsites that are owned by utility companies. So that a\nwireless antenna that goes up on a -- on a rooftop --\nQUESTION: Non-wireless sites that are used by a\nutility.\nMR. STEINDLER: Say that again?\nQUESTION: Non-wireless sites that are owned by\nutility companies. If a utility company only -- only has\npermitted the stringing of wire, it has opened itself up,\nhas it not, under this rule --\nMR. STEINDLER: Yes.\nQUESTION: -- to mandatory carriage of -- of\nwireless?\nMR. STEINDLER: Correct. That's the -- that's\nthe Government's argument.\nThis -- under this FCC's -- under the FCC's\nreading of this statute, which is impermissible if you\nread the whole statute, they have -- they have decided to\ntake this revolutionary expansion of their jurisdiction to\nregulate this tiny piece of the wireless siting market.\nBut if Congress had intended the FCC to regulate the\nwireless siting market in this peculiar kind of way, just\nutility sites, clearly they would have said something\nabout it. And they didn't here, which is another part of\nthe context here of the statute which informs the reading\nof the phrase, any attachment, in the statute.\nQUESTION: Mr. Steindler, could I ask you a\nquestion that gets you to the other -- to the other issue?\nIs it -- is the Government correct that you lose if the --\neven if the rate applied by the FCC is wrong, that the\nonly thing you're asking us is to say that the FCC has no\njurisdiction? It wouldn't even matter if the FCC should\nhave been treating this under (e) as telecommunications.\nThat isn't what you're asking for.\nMR. STEINDLER: Well, no, it's not. If the FCC\nhad gone through the exercise that you had suggested and\nclassified cable modem surface -- service, as either a\ncable service or a telecommunication service or neither,\nas an information service, if it had gone through that\nexercise and that exercise had survived a challenge, then\nthis -- the game would be over. It would be if it's a\ncable service or a telecommunications service, it would\nfall within (d) or (e).\nWhat the FCC has done here -- and the reason\nthat we're in this awkward posture -- is they've refused\nto make that classification, but they've decided that,\nnonetheless, cable modem service, even though we don't\nknow what it is, is going to be treated under (d), which\nCongress has said will be applied solely to cable service.\nThe statute --\nQUESTION: Well, they -- they didn't say it\nwould be treated under (d). They said under (a) we're\ngoing to proceed the same way -- or under -- under\nwhatever it is --\nMR. STEINDLER: (A) and (b), correct.\nQUESTION: Under (a) and (b), we're going to --\nwe're going to use the same rate that Congress specifies\nin -- in (d). They don't say it's under (d).\nMR. STEINDLER: That's correct. That's correct.\nA distinction I think without a difference from our\nperspective.\nQUESTION: From your perspective.\nMR. STEINDLER: But that's indeed what they --\nwhat they've done.\nA couple of points to make here quickly. One is\nthat -- that indeed what Congress was doing here, as the\npetitioners have pointed out, was dealing with the fact\nthat cable companies were going to be getting into the\ntelephone business. And this Texas Utilities case, which\nthe Government mentions in its brief, stands for the\nproposition in the pre-'96 era -- in the pre-'96 statute\n-- that if you're a cable company in the telephone\nbusiness, you get a regulated rate for your attachment,\nand -- and therefore can compete against the ILEC's, which\nis what the larger purpose of much of the '96 act was\nabout.\nBut if you're -- if you're a CLEC, if you're a\ntelephone company, a communications company, that's in the\nsame business and providing the same service, you don't\nget a regulated rate. That was a regulatory anomaly, as\nthe legislative history calls it, and Congress dealt with\nthat head on in the statute. And it provided in section\n(d) and section (e) -- it -- that -- that where you have\n-- it added telecommunications carriers to the statute,\nalthough it exempted the ILEC's.\nRemember this. The cable companies' biggest\ncompetitors in high-speed services business, the DSL\nlines, or the local phone companies, don't have regulated\npole attachments. And that's what, in many respects, is\ndriving the cable companies.\nQUESTION: Say it again. The local phone\ncompanies --\nMR. STEINDLER: The local phone company is\nexempted from the statute. Let me show you where. If you\nturn to the definition of a telecommunications carrier on\npage 205a, in section 224(a)(5), for purposes of this\nsection, the term telecommunications carrier does not\ninclude any incumbent local exchange carrier as defined in\nsection 251.\nQUESTION: Is that because they have their own\npoles?\nMR. STEINDLER: They have very few of their own\npoles. I think largely -- Congress didn't say exactly why\nthey were -- why they were doing this.\nBut remember what the larger purposes of the '96\nact were. The '96 act was designed to create competition\nto the local telephone companies.\nQUESTION: I thought the purpose of this -- and\nI'm really asking this question because I want to hear\nwhat your argument is on the main point in this case, if\nit's different from what you've already said. I mean,\nyou've been talking about wireless for a long time, and\nnow maybe you're back to the main point.\nMR. STEINDLER: Indeed.\nQUESTION: All right. And if you're going to be\nright on the main point, my main question on the main\npoint is I thought that the purpose of this act basically\nis that Congress discovered that the utilities have poles\neverywhere. There are new competitors coming along that\ncould use those poles to transmit their networks at lower\ncost, but the utilities have a monopoly. And we want to\nmake sure that a monopoly, a monopoly into -- a monopoly\ndoes not charge a monopoly price and, therefore, we want\nthem regulated. And, therefore, they wrote very broad\nlanguage to throw into what is going to be regulated\nvirtually everything related to communications that will\nmeet that kind of problem. Now, that's my -- I'm -- I'm\nsaying this to get you started on what I consider the main\npoint.\nMR. STEINDLER: Right, and I understand that. I\nthink the answer is that this statute is not written in\nvery broad language. This statute is written very\nnarrowly. Congress said it was to be construed narrowly,\nand it provides, with great specificity, what services are\nregulated and how they're to be regulated. And -- and I\nthink that really addresses the fundamental question here.\nQUESTION: Yes, except the jurisdictional\nlanguage is broad.\nMR. STEINDLER: Well, let's talk about the\njurisdictional language --\nQUESTION: And the language that you point to as\nnarrowing is language that picks out two categories of\nrate setting.\nMR. STEINDLER: The jurisdictional language is\nnot as broad as it may appear to be. The --\nQUESTION: It doesn't include toasters and it\ndoesn't include billboards, I agree.\nMR. STEINDLER: Yes, but it also doesn't include\ncommingled cable and Internet service. And the reason\nthat it doesn't include that is that Congress specifically\n-- as Mr. Keisler pointed out, Congress specifically\ndefined a cable system in the statute. It's -- it's\nreprinted. The definition is reprinted at page 19 of the\nbrief of the respondents, American Electric Power Service\nCorporation.\nBut remember -- remember what we're talking\nabout. We're talking about a pole attachment definition\nwhich is any attachment by a cable television system.\nCongress has defined this term.\nNow, Justice Scalia remarked earlier that it was\n-- it's an attachment by a cable -- a cable system, not of\na cable system. And, indeed, there is awkwardness in this\nlanguage, but I would submit to you that the express\ndefinition of cable system will trump any awkwardness in\ngrammar.\nQUESTION: Well, there's an awkwardness that I\ndon't understand. The '96 act was extending the benefit\nof attachment a group that hadn't had that benefit before.\nWhat is there that makes sense of saying, cable company,\nif you dare to go into the Internet business, you are\ngoing to be, in the words that were used before, kicked\noff the pole. That's it. If Congress was trying to\nencourage development of Internet service, it also wanted\nthe cable system to get onto that pole at a rent that was\nnot a monopoly rent. What sense would it make to say,\ncable company, you dare to go into the Internet access\nbusiness, you are off the pole entirely?\nMR. STEINDLER: Well, Congress has talked sort\nof out of both sides of its mouth about the Internet. It\nwants to promote it on the one hand, indeed. But it also\nwants to be sure that it keeps its hands off the Internet\nand has -- has said -- announced its policy that it's\ngoing to -- the Internet ought to develop unfettered by\nFederal and State regulation.\nRemember this, that -- that the pole attachment\nstatute was designed originally to help cable companies in\ntheir infancy, when they were mom and pop cable shops.\nQUESTION: It doesn't fetter the Internet. This\nfetters the utility companies.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. STEINDLER: Indeed. Indeed. But -- but\nyou've got the -- you've got a statute that says the\nfollowing very clearly. We're going to give you -- it\nmakes it clear now that we're going to give you one rate\nif you're providing cable only, and we're going to give\nyou another rate, a much higher rate, if you add a service\nto that wire, which is the telecommunications service.\nIt's not incomprehensible or unclear that if --\nif the cable company makes a decision to step into the\nInternet business, that it -- that it simply opts out of\nthe statute. These cable companies --\nQUESTION: Well, that's your position. That's\nhow you read the statute.\nMR. STEINDLER: Correct.\nBut these cable companies are -- are not mom and\npop shops anymore. They're some of the biggest companies\nin the United States.\nQUESTION: But is there anything in the\nlegislative history, anything that indicates that Congress\nwanted to take this benefit away from the cable systems if\nthey were also offering Internet access?\nMR. STEINDLER: Let me -- the answer is yes, and\nit comes in the definition of a cable system. A cable\nsystem is a set of facilities, but where you're a common\ncarrier -- that is to say if you're in the phone business\nand you're regulated as a common carrier -- the definition\nsays you are a cable system only to the extent that you\nprovide traditional video service. That dovetails here\nwith what Congress has done with respect to cable service\nin 224(d). It gives this lower rate only if you're\nproviding cable service.\nThe cable system definition -- let me say that\nagain. You're --\nQUESTION: You're not arguing about the lower\nrate anymore. I mean, you --\nMR. STEINDLER: Well, what I'm arguing here --\nQUESTION: You're arguing --\nMR. STEINDLER: -- is -- is about --\nQUESTION: You're arguing that you're off the\npole entirely.\nMR. STEINDLER: Well, you're -- you're\nunregulated. That doesn't make you off the pole. The --\nthe phone company is unregulated --\nQUESTION: You can charge anything you want.\nThat's -- you take the cable company that is getting this\nlow rent because the FCC has specified that rent. If it\ngets into -- into the Internet business, then it's subject\nto whatever the utility wants to charge.\nMR. STEINDLER: If -- if the -- if it gets into\nthe Internet business, it gets put on the same footing as\nif you're a local phone company charging DSL service --\nQUESTION: Whatever -- whatever the --\nMR. STEINDLER: -- which is the market rate.\nQUESTION: -- utility wants to charge.\nMR. STEINDLER: Correct.\nQUESTION: Right. And that's the price of\ngetting into the Internet for a cable system. It has to\ngive up --\nMR. STEINDLER: For a cable company.\nQUESTION: -- the tremendous advantage that it\nhas.\nMR. STEINDLER: It gives up -- it gives up rate\nregulations here.\nQUESTION: Is its main competitor the local\nphone system?\nMR. STEINDLER: Yes, yes.\nQUESTION: So --\nMR. STEINDLER: But there are two -- there are\ntwo big competitors in this business: the local phone\ncompany which is unregulated, and the cable company which\nis seeking this regulation.\nQUESTION: How many -- how many poles do the\nlocal phone companies own in relation to the utilities\nthat you're representing?\nMR. STEINDLER: About 80 or 85 percent of poles\nare owned by the utility companies; 15-20 percent are\nowned by the telephone companies.\nQUESTION: So, the effect of what Justice\nGinsburg is talking about is going to be significantly\ndifferent in relation to the utilities from what it is in\nrelation to local phone companies. You say, well, it just\nputs them in the same relationship to the utility as they\nare to the phone company, but in economic terms, there's a\ntremendous difference because you've got most of the\npoles.\nMR. STEINDLER: Indeed, but the -- the -- I\nthink the relevant comparison of that would be how many\nthe phone company -- it's putting -- it's putting the --\nQUESTION: You can charge --\nMR. STEINDLER: -- cable company and the phone\ncompany on, more or less, the same footing.\nQUESTION: You're -- you're the ones holding --\nholding the market position.\nMR. STEINDLER: Yes.\nQUESTION: You -- you can charge the -- the\nphone companies whatever you want for their use of your --\nMR. STEINDLER: Correct. And remember this. If\nthere is -- these attachers have, if they're unregulated,\na remedy if they feel they're being overcharged under the\nessential facilities doctrine. They go into court and\nbring an antitrust case.\nQUESTION: Mr. Steindler, am I wrong in\nthinking --\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: May I just ask one question? Am I\nwrong in thinking that a local phone company can be a\nutility within the meaning of the statute?\nMR. STEINDLER: Indeed.\nQUESTION: Indeed, that I'm wrong, or indeed, it\nis?\nMR. STEINDLER: They're both. Indeed, it is.\nThey are both.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Steindler.\nMR. STEINDLER: Thank you.\nQUESTION: Mr. Feldman, you have 2 minutes\nremaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES A. FELDMAN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS IN NO. 00-843\nMR. FELDMAN: I think it might be worthwhile to\npoint out that the -- the FCC's construction of the act is\nentitled to deference and is at least a reasonable\nconstruction of the act.\nBut let -- let me go to the -- the point that\nMr. Steindler was just making. Congress, in 1978 as a\npremise of this act, decided that the telephone companies\nand the utilities had a lot of -- and we cite the -- the\ncommittee report that makes this point -- had -- had\ninterconnection agreements. Some owned -- the utilities\nowned some poles; the telephone companies owned other\npoles. They had a longstanding agreements by which\neverybody used everybody else's poles because everybody\nhad to get a complete network to all the houses.\nNow, under -- so, therefore, that is why\nCongress did not include the so-called ILEC's, the old-\nfashioned telephone companies, in this act. They already\nhad access to poles. They either owned them or had\nagreements with longstanding arrangements with -- with the\nutility -- electric utilities.\nOn the other hand, there were CLEC's, which are\nnew entrants in the telecommunications business. Those\nwere protected by the (e) rate regardless of whether they\ndo or don't provide Internet access.\nSimilarly, cable companies, the FCC decided,\nshould be protected by the (d) rate similarly so that if\nthey provide Internet access, they're not penalized\nthereby and kicked off the pole. Under Mr. Steindler's\nrule and under the Eleventh Circuit's decision, if a cable\ncompany provides Internet access, it's off the pole.\nQUESTION: I guess that isn't quite -- I mean,\nin fairness to what he was arguing, I mean, a person, were\nthis statute not to apply, could still go either to the\nlocal telephone company regulators, which I imagine they\nwould do in the case of the local phone company, could go\nto the local public utilities commission, or could go to\nthe Federal Power Commission and ask them for the same\nkind of protection that the FCC might give them if this\nact does apply.\nMR. FELDMAN: Well, I guess --\nQUESTION: Is that right?\nMR. FELDMAN: I'm not -- I'm not aware of what\nthe basis of the Federal Power Commission's ability to\norder --\nQUESTION: Well, if it were some kind of high\ntension wire that was used in transmitting interstate\ncommerce.\nBut the fact is these areas are all regulated by\nsomebody, and this is really a question of who has what\njurisdiction.\nMR. FELDMAN: Right, but what -- what Congress\nwanted was --\nQUESTION: Am I right about that?\nMR. FELDMAN: I'm not -- I'm not sure about what\nthe -- what the authority of local utility agencies is\nover the poles as opposed to the rates --\nQUESTION: Could they not --\nMR. FELDMAN: -- for the service. I just don't\nknow.\nQUESTION: I'm imagining they could -- well, I\n-- sorry.\nMR. FELDMAN: Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr.\nFeldman.\n"
