I hope I got that right.\n(Laughter.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Mr. Bork.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT H. BORK\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. BORK: Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the\nCourt:\nI refer to them as SMC.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. BORK: The Federal circuit's rules in this\ncase ought to be reversed because it flatly contradicts\nthis Court's decision in Warner-Jenkinson, and\nfurthermore, it radically undermines the patent system. I\nthink Warner-Jenkinson should be reaffirmed because it's\nin keeping with the Patent Act, with the goals and\npolicies of the patent system, and because it is much\nfairer than the harsh inequities of this new rule which\nthis case presents a prime example.\nWarner -- let me discuss the crucial differences\nbetween Warner-Jenkinson and the Federal circuit's new\nrules.\nIn the first place, Warner-Jenkinson holds that\nprosecution history estoppel arises only when an amendment\nto a patent surrenders subject matter -- and clearly\nsurrenders it -- in order to achieve patentability. The\nFederal circuit holds to the contrary that any narrowing\namendment, regardless of the reason for it, creates\nprosecution history estoppel.\nSecond, the Warner-Jenkinson case holds that the\nreason for an amendment determines whether an estoppel is\ncreated. The Federal circuit denies that and holds that\nthe reason is irrelevant, and if an amendment has the\nnarrowing effect, intended or not, it creates a complete\nestoppel. Thus, if the patent examiner said he found the\nclaims to be imprecise and the applicant made an amendment\nto clarify what the examiner thought was imprecise, that\nmight be held to be a narrowing amendment and the patent\nwould be unenforceable. And that is what happened to\nFesto in this case. And those results cannot be squared\nwith Warner-Jenkinson.\nThird, the Federal circuit holds that an\namendment creates an estoppel if it applies to any of the\nstatutory requirements for obtaining a patent, not just\npatent -- not just patentability as defined by the Patent\nAct, but any of the requirements for obtaining a patent.\nNow, the Patent Act makes clear a distinction\nbetween patentability and other requirements. Sections\n101 through 103 come under the heading of patentability of\ninventions, and they state the substantive requirements\nfor getting a patent. The invention must be new and\nuseful. It must be not found in the prior art, and it\nmust not be obvious. Those are the only elements of\npatentability known in the law. And this Court's opinion\nin Graham against John Deere confirms that. No other\nrequirement of the statute relates to patentability.\nThe Federal circuit holds to the contrary, that\nan amendment affecting any of the statutory requirements\nfor getting a patent may generate estoppel, and those\nrequirements include sections 111 and 112 of the act. But\nthose sections relate to the form of the application and\nnot to the subject matter sought to be patented.\nQUESTION: Is it clear most of the time, Mr.\nBork, whether the amendment is for purposes of 103, 111,\nand 112? Can you pick up the patent history and -- and\ntell at a glance whether it's a 103 or a 111 and 112\npurpose that generated the amendment?\nMR. BORK: I think one can. For example, in\nthis case you'll see in the Stoll patent -- there are two\npatents, of course, in play here, the Stoll patent and the\nCarroll patent. In this case, the patent examiner says\nthat he objects on the grounds that the claim is stated in\nan improper form, is multiply dependent, and also that\nit's imprecise. He's not sure what it means. Now, that\nis quite clear that those are 111 and 112 objections, not\nto the subject matter sought to be patented.\nQUESTION: But if you're the applicant and you\nget that response from the Patent Office, during the\ncourse of the amendment might you not rethink and -- and\nclarify what you're doing under 103 as well? That's\nwhat --\nMR. BORK: Oh, if the -- if the applicant\ndecides to amend in a way that surrenders subject matter,\nit disclaims subject matter, the fact that the process\nbegan with a -- with the examiner's on grounds of form\ndoesn't affect it. If he surrenders subject matter, that\nsubject matter is gone and the equivalents to it are gone\ntoo.\nQUESTION: But wasn't that the argument here\nwith reference to the seals and the magnetized or\ndemagnetized cylinder?\nMR. BORK: There was an argument to that effect,\nbut if you look at the patent -- at the prosecution\nhistory which is of both the Stoll and the Carroll\npatents, which are in the volume 2 of the transcript,\nthere is no abandonment of any subject matter.\nIn the Stoll patent, there is no abandonment of\nsubject matter. In the Carroll patent, there is.\nHowever, the subject matter which was abandoned had no\nrelevance to the lawsuit. It wasn't what was -- what was\nsued on, so that there is, in operational terms, no\ndisclaimer or surrender of subject matter in either of\nthese patents.\nQUESTION: Mr. Bork, both the Solicitor General\nand an amicus, the IEEE, suggest that a -- a different\nflexible bar test would be appropriate. Would you comment\non those two proposals?\nMR. BORK: Justice O'Connor, I think they're\nmuch too narrow. The only rationale that makes any sense\nas to a flexible bar proposal or any bar proposal is that\nif you've disclaimed something, then the equivalent of\nsubject matter -- the equivalents to the disclaimed\nsubject matter are barred by estoppel, but other\nequivalents that don't go to what was surrendered are not\nbarred. Therefore, the -- the rule of the -- the bar, the\nquestion of the scope of the bar, relates closely to the\nquestion -- the first question presented in this case --\nQUESTION: Let's say there's --\nMR. BORK: -- as to what was surrendered.\nQUESTION: Let's say there's an amendment under\n103 where -- where you agree that there can be an\nestoppel. Should there be a presumption there?\nMR. BORK: A presumption -- if there is a clear\nsurrender, there's no presumption. It's -- it's a -- it's\na waiver. It's -- you've estopped yourself. If it's\nunclear what -- why you have done it, then this Court in\nWarner-Jenkinson says there be a remand under a\npresumption that what you did was for purposes of\npatentability, what you surrendered was for purposes of\npatentability, and if you cannot rebut that presumption,\nthen you lose.\nQUESTION: Wasn't it more, Mr. Bork, than just a\npresumption if you couldn't -- I thought Warner-Jenkinson\nsaid where you do not establish any reason for the\namendment, the Court did use the word presume. It said\nthe Court should presume that the patent application has a\nsubstantial reason relating to patentability. And then\nthe following sentence is, in those circumstances,\nprosecution history estoppel would bar the application of\nthe doctrine of equivalents. So, that sounds to me like\nan absolute bar rule, that if you don't -- if the reason\nis unexplained, the consequence is a complete bar.\nMR. BORK: Oh, well, consequence is a bar as to\nthat. Yes, as to that area. But I guess I perhaps didn't\nexpress myself well.\nIf the appellate court, this Court, looks and\nsays, I don't know the reason -- as in Warner-Jenkinson,\nit was unclear why there was a lower limit of pH 6 set on\nthat process -- I don't know -- I don't know why you\namended to set that lower limit, there is a presumption\nthat you did it for a reason related to patentability,\nwhich would create a complete bar. However, on remand,\nyou get a chance to rebut that presumption with evidence.\nIf you don't rebut it, it's a bar.\nQUESTION: The -- the Federal circuit is\nsupposed to be an expert in this and they say that\ninventors or people who are trying to invent things are\nsupposed to be able to read the claims, and that's it.\nAnd if you didn't make your claim properly, particularly\nwhen you had a second chance, that's your problem, and any\nother system -- any other system is going to really go\nback to what used to be called central claiming where the\nclaims point to rather than define the invention. And\nthat's just not workable today. We'll get an equivalents\nclaim in every case. And so, let's make an exception\nwhere the lawyer couldn't really do anything about it.\nThat's called unforeseeability.\nMR. BORK: Well, the fact --\nQUESTION: With that possible exception, which\nthey maybe should have mentioned but didn't, it's up to\nthe lawyer and it's his fault. And the reason is if he\ndidn't do it properly, we punish him because we have to\nhave certainty for people who want to invent other things.\nNow, that I take it is the heart of what's being said on\nthe other side, and I'd like to know your response.\nMR. BORK: Well, there are a couple of responses\nto that, Justice Breyer.\nIn the first place, let me say that the solution\nthe Federal circuit has devised is -- doesn't relate to\nthe problem. If the problem is the unworkability of the\nequivalents test, then the answer is to abolish\nequivalents, not to -- and that doesn't depend on whether\nor not there's been an amendment. And if you're going to\nabolish equivalents, the way to do it, so that you don't\nhave this terrible retroactive effect, is to have the\nPatent and Trademark Office engage in a rulemaking\nfunction, a rulemaking which has a prospective effect\nonly, or have Congress sit down and do a rule -- legislate\nthat has a prospective effect only.\nQUESTION: Would the PTO have authority to do\nthat by regulation in the absence of congressional\nauthorization?\nMR. BORK: I think it has authorization to do --\nto make rules of that sort, Mr. Chief Justice.\nBut on the -- on the question that -- I'm sorry,\nJustice Breyer.\nQUESTION: They're not arguing for abolition.\nThey're not arguing for abolition.\nMR. BORK: No --\nQUESTION: They're arguing for hold the lawyer\nto a very tough standard, but a small equitable exception\nin the instance where the lawyer really couldn't really do\nanything about it, namely where it's not foreseeable that\nthis kind of really copied device is going to come\nabout --\nMR. BORK: Well --\nQUESTION: -- because the language isn't -- you\nknow, English doesn't work perfectly, the English\nlanguage, and because there could be future inventions\nthat might cause that to be unforeseeable.\nMR. BORK: That is true, but what they have\nsuggested in effect is that the lawyer put into the\nliteral claims he files a claim for all the equivalents\nthat he can foresee. Now, he can't foresee most of the\nequivalents, and if he did that, I think you'd have a\npatent claim that would look roughly like the tax code.\nQUESTION: No, because they have ways of doing\nit. They say all the things like, or they say -- you\nknow, I can't remember. There's a special technical word\nfor it where you -- you try to do it in terms of function.\nThere are ways of doing it.\nMR. BORK: Function, way and result.\nQUESTION: And the briefs are filled -- you\nknow, the briefs are filled with them, how -- how easy it\nis. The other side says, no, no, it's very easy, and your\nside says, oh, really? It isn't so easy.\nMR. BORK: Well, you're referring, I think,\nJustice Breyer, to the testing of -- for equivalents\ncalled function, way and result?\nQUESTION: No, no. I'm not thinking -- I'm not\nthinking that. I'm thinking there's a -- there is a way\nof drafting a claim where you put in the claim -- you\ndon't describe the thing exactly. You describe what the\nthing does.\nMR. BORK: Well, if you do that, Justice Breyer,\nI don't think you've solved the problem of unworkability.\nI don't think it's unworkable in the first place, but I\ndon't think you've solved the problem of the litigation\nthat's going to take place and the difficulty judges are\ngoing to have in distinguishing the case that is covered\nfrom the case that is not covered. I think it's exactly\nthe same problem as you'd get with the application of the\ndoctrine of equivalents.\nQUESTION: May I ask? I've had a lot of trouble\nunderstanding this patent, to be very honest with you.\nSome patents I can understand. This one I found very\ndifficult. And one of your -- the changes, as I\nunderstand it, is in the early draft of the claim there\nwas no reference to the nonmagnetic material that was used\nin the tube and that that was the -- that was one of the\nchanges that -- that was made. And your suggestion is\nthat was -- had nothing to do with the subject --\npatentability. It's just change of description or\nsomething like that, if I understand you.\nBut the patent itself seems to be a patent on a\nmagnetic relationship between different elements of the --\nof the item, and just at first blush, it seemed to me that\na -- that a -- an element that described a nonmagnetic\nmaterial would be rather important. And your position is\nit's of no importance. Could you just comment a little\nbit on this problem for me --\nMR. BORK: Yes, the --\nQUESTION: -- so I can get a better\nunderstanding of it?\nMR. BORK: The Festo patent specified a\nmagnetized material in the tube, and SMC used a aluminum\nalloy.\nQUESTION: This is in the Stoll patent I think,\nisn't it?\nMR. BORK: Yes.\nAnd SMC used a aluminum alloy, which is not\nmagnetizable material. However, it does conduct magnetism\nwell enough -- very slightly, but well enough -- to\ncomplete the circuit and to do what the Festo patent does\nso that it is an equivalent in that sense to the\nmagnetizable sleeve. If it were pure aluminum, it\nwouldn't conduct the magnetism, but it isn't. It's an\nalloy.\nQUESTION: Suppose that I was going to buy your\nproduct and I knew what the German patents contained and\nyou were trying to sell it to me, and I asked you this.\nWhat does your product do that the product covered by the\nGerman patents doesn't do? What would you say?\nMR. BORK: Well, I think I would -- I would\npoint to the sealing rings and the magnetizable --\nQUESTION: Exactly, and -- and therefore, they\nare saying that's at the heart of this thing. The sealing\nrings enabled the -- enabled you to use a larger piston\nbecause it could come closer to the side of the cylinder.\nAnd here they've copied -- they -- they -- so, you defined\nit this way, we didn't follow it.\nMR. BORK: I beg your pardon? You defined it\nthis way and they didn't follow it? They did follow it.\nThe only difference between their -- our claim said four\nrings: two guide rings and two sealing rings. They had\ntwo guide rings and one sealing ring.\nQUESTION: Exactly, but the heart of your\ninvention was a way of wiping the inside of the tube --\nMR. BORK: The outside.\nQUESTION: -- as I understand it, so that the\npiston could come closer to the inside of the tube. And\nyou defined that by using two rings. And they say, well,\nthat's what the heart of the invention was, these two\nrings, and we didn't use two rings.\nMR. BORK: They used --\nQUESTION: We used one ring.\nMR. BORK: They used one ring which performed\nexactly the same function.\nQUESTION: That's -- you say it performed\nexactly the same. They say it didn't quite work quite as\nwell.\nMR. BORK: Well --\nQUESTION: And now this is the heart of the\nproblem.\nMR. BORK: I don't know that they --\nQUESTION: The -- let me show you why. Because\nthe Federal circuit is saying inventors generally have to\nput this kind of an issue before a jury or a judge who\ndoesn't understand it too well. And that's why there's a\nlack of certainty and that's why we have to have the rule\nwe have.\nMR. BORK: If they put before the jury or the\njudge the question of whether a narrowing has taken place,\nthey'll be litigating just as much and there will be just\nas much uncertainty as there is on whether this thing is\nsubstantially the same as that thing. You -- this -- one\nthing this new rule does not do is eliminate uncertainty.\nIn fact, we will -- it just shifts the area of litigation,\nso that I don't think that anything is solved by this.\nIt just -- nothing is solved by it and you pay\nan enormous price in terms of future patents. If you look\nat future patents, the future patentee knows he's not\ngoing to get the same protection he had before because if\nhe dares to amend -- and almost all patents are amended.\nIt's just inevitable. That's the way -- that's the way\nthe process goes. If he's -- if he amends and if an\namendment is requested by the examiner, he can either\nrefuse it and appeal. That adds about 4 years to the\ntime, to the 2 years the prosecution history usually\ntakes. Now, the patent started running when you filed.\nSo, now you've lost 6 years, the most valuable years under\nyour patent. And nobody is going to like that.\nOr he can turn to the trade secret system, or he\ncan file a claim so narrow that they -- they don't fully\nprotect what he's invented but also that don't require\namendments. The -- if you -- if you get patents of that\nsort, which are of very little value, you don't protect\nthe innovation function that patents are supposed to\nprotect. Pfizer and other amici have pointed out that to\nget a drug to market costs in excess of $100 million.\nNobody is going to spend over $100 million to\ncommercialize a product that cannot be protected. So,\nyou've done -- you've done an enormous amount of damage to\nthe innovation process in this thing.\nWorse --\nQUESTION: Mr. Bork, --\nMR. BORK: -- the people who are really hard hit\nare the people, -- the 1,200,000 patents that are\noutstanding now because those people had no warning. When\nthey -- when they got their patents, amendments were\nfreely made, and that was just the way it worked. The\nexaminer and the patent attorney sat down and they\nexchanged views and they worked it out and they amended to\nsatisfy the examiner. Now all of those patents are\nvirtually worthless, which is a --\nQUESTION: May I just ask you a question about\nthey're virtually worthless because the doctrine of\nequivalents is not available to those patentees? That's\n-- that's basically the point, is it?\nMR. BORK: That's right. Well, that's right.\nQUESTION: Now, the one thing I didn't --\nthere's a volume of briefs in the file here and I can't\nsay I've read them all, but do the briefs anywhere tell us\nwhat percentage of all -- successful infringement claims\nrest on the doctrine of equivalents?\nMR. BORK: I don't recall that the briefs ever\ndo tell us that.\nQUESTION: Because your assumption is that a\nvery significant portion must be based on --\nMR. BORK: Oh, yes. Oh, yes. Oh, yes. Well --\nQUESTION: Because there's a lot of -- a lot of\ncases in which it's just an infringement, a literal\ninfringement.\nMR. BORK: That's true, but if a -- if a --\nQUESTION: And that area is not touched by this.\nMR. BORK: No, but if a copyist wants to avoid\nliteral infringement, he takes an amended element and\nalters it slightly, and he's home free under the Federal\ncircuit rule. And that's what happened here. You have a\ndevice which, for all practical purposes, is identical to\nthe Festo patents and has now destroyed the value of the\nFesto patents because Festo didn't foresee back in the\n1980's, when it got these patents, that the Federal\ncircuit was going to change the law as it has in 1997.\nAnd I --\nQUESTION: Or it didn't foresee that there\nwasn't really a big difference between nonmagnetic\nmaterial and magnetic material. I'm not using the right\nwords, but it didn't foresee that something he -- they\ndescribed as significant in the claims was really not\nsignificant.\nMR. BORK: Well, it's significant enough. The\n-- the fact is that the aluminum alloy -- the alloy makes\nit perform the same function as the magnetizable material,\nand what they didn't foresee was that the law was going to\nchange so that the amendment was going to destroy their\npatent.\nQUESTION: Mr. Bork, would you -- would you\ncomment on the Federal circuit's view that they weren't\nreally changing anything, but they had two inconsistent\nlines of decisions? One was the complete bar rule and the\nother was the flexible rule.\nMR. BORK: I think they had two decisions that\nin -- in some sense were regarded as -- they claimed to be\ncomplete bar rules. I think that's a -- that's quite a\nstretch. If you look at the uninterrupted Supreme Court\nprecedent, there is no case like what the Federal circuit\nhas done now. The doctrine of equivalents has been around\nfor over 150 years, and this Court has consistently\napplied it. And they -- there was no complete bar in the\nSupreme Court jurisprudence. I don't think there's much\n-- any complete bar in the Federal circuit jurisprudence\neither, but whatever it was, everybody went forward on the\nunderstanding that the kind of law that was reaffirmed in\nWarner-Jenkinson was the law.\nAnd that's why I find it particularly odd that\nthe Government should say that those people are charged\nwith knowledge back then of what was going to happen now.\nAnd that is doubly odd because the Government in\nWarner-Jenkinson filed a brief taking the position that we\ntake here today, and now they say that we should have\nknown better. They didn't know better. I don't know how\nwe would know better.\nI should like to reserve the remainder of my\ntime, if I may.\nQUESTION: May I ask you, before you step down,\nwhether you think there's a relevant difference between\nclaim elements and claim limitations?\nMR. BORK: I think -- I think they're two words\nfor the same thing.\nQUESTION: Very well, Mr. Bork.\nMr. Wallace, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE G. WALLACE\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,\nSUPPORTING VACATUR AND REMAND\nQUESTION: Mr. Wallace, Mr. Bork says the\nGovernment has changed its position from the time it filed\nits brief in Warner-Jenkinson. Do you agree with that?\nMR. WALLACE: I do not, Mr. Chief Justice. We\ndid say that amendments made to avoid prior art and\namendments made for other purposes relating to securing\nthe patent present different problems because amendments\nmade to avoid prior art are almost always narrowing\namendments, and we think that the Federal circuit, in\nspeaking of narrowing amendments, really was speaking of\nsurrendering subject matter which is the formulation that\nthe petitioner prefers; whereas, amendments made for other\npurposes have to be scrutinized with particular care\nbecause they often are not narrowing amendments. And\nindeed, in some of the post-Festo decisions of the Federal\ncircuit, the court has held that there was -- it was not a\nnarrowing amendment and therefore there's no bar.\nBut they can be narrowing amendments. They can\nbe, even though in the guise of addressing the examiner's\nconcern under 112, they could actually be narrowing the\nsubject matter of the claim. And in that instance, the --\nthe estoppel would apply.\nQUESTION: How does one figure that out? Give\nus a -- an example. Part of the argument is this is very\ndifficult to figure out, that -- that the new system\nthat's -- that's been brought in is -- is as complicated\nto administer in -- in the courts as -- as the old.\nMR. WALLACE: A simple example would be in\nWarner-Jenkinson itself. If there was an addition of a\nlimitation on the pH levels from 6 to 9 in the amendment,\nif the examiner in that case had said that the\nspecifications are not clear enough and that amendment was\nadded in response to that, even though the examiner had\nraised other concerns, but the applicant purported to add\nthat limitation in response to the examiner's concerns\nabout the specificity, it still would be adding a\nlimitation and it would be an implied disclaimer of\nsubject matter in comparison with the initial claim. And\nour view would be that estoppel would apply.\nQUESTION: But the idea of estoppel, as I\nunderstand it, is that a person is prevented from taking\ncontrary positions, and it seems to me in your example\nthat it's not necessarily a contrary position.\nMR. WALLACE: Well, it's contrary in the sense\nof what fair inferences can be drawn by the public from\nthe record of the prosecution history. When he started\noff -- the applicant started off without this limitation\nand then added the limitation, the limitation speaks for\nitself in narrowing the scope of the claim elements. And\nthat -- that is the central problem of this case.\nIf prosecution history estoppel is to have\nmeaningful effect, once we settle where it applies, which\nseems to me to be the lesser question, it necessarily\nfollows, if it's to have meaningful effect, that the claim\nelements that have been narrowed by the patent applicant,\nin order to secure the issuance of the patent, cannot be\nafforded the same or almost the same protection against\nnon-literal infringement that would be available to them\nunder the doctrine of equivalents if they had not been\nnarrowed.\nQUESTION: Is there -- is there a way of doing\nthis? Look, the Federal circuit itself thinks that its\nrule is a crude effort to deal with a problem that may\nhave the adverse consequences that -- that Mr. Bork\npredicted. And if so, they'll want to change their minds.\nNow, is there a way under the law that they could have the\nauthority to change their minds if it turns out that this\nexperiment doesn't work?\nMR. WALLACE: Well, I -- I think so. These are\ndoctrines that have been developed. Prosecution history\nestoppel and its effects are really equitable in origin,\nand the courts have the authority to reexamine the\napplication of equitable doctrines in light of experience.\nThe -- the real question here, as we see it, is\nwhat -- how do you reconcile the inferences that are\nlegitimately to be drawn by the public with the\npatentholder's need for protection from unfair copying.\nAnd this is not a matter of small moment because if -- the\ndoctrine of equivalents does not apply, but the all-\nelements test still is applicable, as the opinions below\nreflect, to claims of literal infringement or non-literal\ninfringement.\nSo, we have suggested an answer that we draw\ndirectly from this Court's decisions. We first look at\nExhibit Supply, a 1942 decision, in which the Court said\nthat when the applicant narrows the claim, he necessarily\nis recognizing the difference between what was originally\nacclaimed -- claimed and what the narrowing amendment\nclaims, and there's an implied disclaimer of all that is\nembraced within that difference. And he's recognizing the\nsignificance of that difference. And it -- the Court\ncited a number of its prior decisions at that time.\nSo, we think that applicants have been fairly on\nnotice that prosecution history estoppel does apply to\nnarrowing amendments and that there is considerable risk\nin narrowing claims and that they have to do that with\ngreat care with that in mind.\nQUESTION: Mr. Wallace, the Government is\nproposing a change, a backing off from what the CAFC did,\nbut proposing some new formulation or test. How does the\ntest you propose differ from that proposed by the\nInstitute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers do you\nthink?\nMR. WALLACE: Well, I think they take -- they\nstart from what --\nQUESTION: They -- they key it into\nforeseeability somehow.\nMR. WALLACE: Yes, but they start by assuming\nthe validity of the flexible bar rule and trying to\ntighten it a little bit. We think that the court of\nappeals was right.\nQUESTION: And so do you apparently.\nMR. WALLACE: Well, we -- we think the court of\nappeals was right in saying that the way the -- it has\nbeen applying the flexible bar rule did not properly\nrecognize what had been surrendered in the course of the\nprosecution history estoppel. But we -- we come out in\nmuch the same place at the end even though the differences\nbetween those and the Federal Bar Association also\nrecommends a presumption and shift of the burden of proof\nsimilar to ours, but they're -- they're unwilling to\nrecognize that everything, as the Court said in Exhibit\nSupply, that was surrendered is necessarily part of the\nimplied disclaimer. They say, well, even if you went down\nto your 9 pH in Warner-Jenkinson, as long as you could\nshow that you could have claimed 10, we should treat that\nthe same as if you did claim 10. We think that the\ninferences to be drawn by the public from the prosecution\nhistory estoppel are not that loose.\nBut we do think the court of appeals went too\nfar in saying that applicants were on notice that an\nabsolute bar would necessarily apply to all claims, and we\nhave made our suggestions about burden of proof and\npresumptions to afford further protection in cases where\nthe applicant -- the patentholder can show that it would\nbe unfair to treat --\nQUESTION: Mr. Wallace, with respect to that,\nyour second possibility, the second kind of escape hatch\nfor the patentholder, as I understand it, relates to a\ncase in which, in effect, it was impossible to be any more\nprecise, to exclude any more precisely than they did. My\nquestion is, doesn't that in effect invite the\npatentholder to make that kind of a claim in every case?\nAnd if that is, in fact, going to be an exception to\nabsolute bar, doesn't it mean that we're going to litigate\nit in every case?\nMR. WALLACE: Well, we're quite worried about\nthat. We caution that the versatility of language\nrequires skepticism about that, but we -- we were also\nsensitive about the difficulties in some particular areas\nof new technology, biotechnology, and the like, although I\npressed the Patent Office and they couldn't come up with a\nconcrete example.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Wallace.\nMr. Neustadt, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF ARTHUR I. NEUSTADT\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. NEUSTADT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nFirst, I'd like to direct a response to Justice\nBreyer's question concerning that section of the statute\nthat -- that you were looking for. That's 112, paragraph\n6, which says that you can claim the function of an\nelement and you get protection for everything that has\nthat function if it is the same as what's in the\nspecification or its equivalent.\nNext, I'd like to address my attention to\nJustice Stevenson's question with respect to literal\ninfringement and doctrine of equivalents infringement. We\nwere faced with the same question and we made an analysis\nof all the cases that were decided by the Federal circuit\nin the year 2000. We found that there were 31 cases that\neither held for the patentee or indicated they were going\nto hold for the patentee with respect to preliminary\ninjunction. With respect to those cases, all but four\nwere literal infringement. So, the answer to your\nquestion, for the year 2000, is that 27 of the 31 cases\nwere directed to literal infringement and not -- not\ndoctrine of equivalents infringement.\nAnd you must keep in mind that the Federal\ncircuit in this case, with respect to the doctrine of\nequivalents, didn't rule on the doctrine of equivalents in\ngeneral. They only ruled on the doctrine of equivalents\nwith respect to when a patentee switches from one position\nto another. He starts with one claim. For some reason he\nsees that in order to get his patent, he is going to have\nto narrow.\nA good example is the example that Festo uses,\ngoing from adhesives to glue. You claim adhesives broadly\nwhen you start. You're going to get protection for all\nadhesives. Then you find there's prior art or something\nelse, maybe your specification isn't enabled, and you say\nI'm going to have to go to glue.\nWhat the Federal circuit says for that\nparticular claim element, when you go from adhesives to\nglue, you are telling the public that you're going to\nrely --\nQUESTION: But may I just interrupt with this --\nMR. NEUSTADT: Yes.\nQUESTION: -- this observation? But -- but the\nresult of your rule is that if you do make that change and\ngo to -- to glue, you lose the doctrine of equivalents\nwith respect to that element, but someone who originally\nframed the claim in the way that you ended up with does\nnot have the same opportunity to rely on equivalents that\nyou do. Would you comment on that?\nMR. NEUSTADT: That is correct.\nThis was a point that this Court addressed in\nExhibit Supply and that is because claims are not\ninterpreted just as they stand. They're interpreted in\naccordance with their prosecution history. Where you have\nan original claim that has no prosecution history, then\nit's much tougher for the public to read and figure out\nwhat -- what glue or adhesives mean. But where you have\nthis change from one position to another, a change that\nevery patent attorney resists, then the Federal circuit\nsays this is a narrowing that the public is entitled to\nrely upon. So, there -- there is a very significant\nchange even though you have the exact same words.\nTo refer to Mr. Breyer's question about whether\nor not the Federal circuit has the power to change what\nthey've done, the answer is, of course, prosecution\nhistory estoppel is judge-made law. There is no statute\nconcerning it.\nQUESTION: This is scarcely an encouraging view.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: I mean, if -- if we're looking for\nsome sort of certainty in the area, to say that the\nFederal circuit has now come up with a relatively new\ndoctrine but they're free to change it if it doesn't work\nis not the most auspicious recommendation for that\ndoctrine.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: I presume it would be changed\nretroactively, just as it was introduced retroactively.\nMR. NEUSTADT: Well, I don't -- I don't think\nit's going to be changed, and I don't think there's\nanything retroactive because the Federal circuit decision\nwas entirely consistent with this Court's precedent in\nExhibit Supply and also Warner-Jenkinson. In Exhibit\nSupply, this Court said that where a patentee makes a\nchange to avoid prior art for that particular element, he\ndisclaims and abandons everything between --\nQUESTION: But the Federal circuit went further\nthan that here. It doesn't have to be a change just to\navoid prior art, does it?\nMR. NEUSTADT: That is correct, Your Honor. But\nwhat they did was follow what this Court said in Warner-\nJenkinson concerning what relates to patentability. The\nCourt in Warner-Jenkinson said -- this Court -- that --\nthat we have used this with respect to prior art, citing\nExhibit Supply, but they didn't say it is limited to prior\nart. What the Federal circuit then said --\nQUESTION: But in -- in the John Deere case,\ncertainly the term patentability was used just for that\npurpose.\nMR. NEUSTADT: For prior art?\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. NEUSTADT: I'm not sure, Your Honor.\nWhat the Federal circuit did was they said --\nand there was almost virtually unanimity on the court, 11\nto 1 -- that when you make this narrowing for a purpose\nrelated to patentability or for a statutory requirement\nfor patentability, then the public can view that and\nrecognize and rely upon it. So, the extension from, if\nyou will, 102 and 103 to 112 was of very little extension\nat all.\nQUESTION: Well, are you using the term\npatentability to include 112?\nMR. NEUSTADT: Yes.\nQUESTION: I mean, that's part of the problem\nhere.\nMR. NEUSTADT: Yes, yes.\nQUESTION: Well, I -- I think that's one of the\nissues in this case.\nMR. NEUSTADT: Well, 112 is not just a matter of\nform. 112 is addressed to some of the most important\nissues for a patent application, such as whether or not\nthe application enables the invention. The quid pro quo\nfor the public with respect to giving the exclusivity to\nthe patentee is they get an enabling disclosure. If there\nis no enabling disclosure, then the public gets nothing.\nEnabling disclosure is 112, so 112 is just not form.\nIf you are talking about form and clarification,\nusually when you clarify a claim, you don't narrow it and\nso the result is that would not be controlled by the\nFederal circuit rule.\nWhat the Federal circuit --\nQUESTION: Well, is -- is that really so? I\nmean, every time you have a vague claim, you at least have\nan opportunity to say, well, it covers more than a\ncontrasting narrow claim would be. So, I'm not sure that\nyou can draw this categorical distinction.\nMR. NEUSTADT: Usually when a patent attorney\nwants to -- is concerned with narrowing his claim, he\ndoesn't want to narrow his claim because he gets less for\nhis client. He will try to clarify it in a way that\ndoesn't narrow, if that is the examiner's concern. So,\nusually clarifications are not narrowings and are not\naffected by the Federal circuit rule.\nWhat the Federal circuit issue is -- is directed\nto is actually changing a position for a statutory\nrequirement for patentability. That can be prior art. It\ncan be non-enabling disclosure. For example, this Court\nhas held in Crawford v. Heysinger in the 1800's -- applied\nprosecution history estoppel to a inoperability rejection\nwhich was a 112 rejection. And so, this is the reason why\nthe Federal circuit had very little difficulty and ended\nup with an 11-to-1 vote when they said that, yes,\namendments are not limited to avoid prior art. They cover\nother instances where you narrow.\nAnd the key -- the key is narrowing. Patent\nattorneys hate to narrow. It gives their clients less\nprotection. They don't want to narrow unless the only\nchoice is not getting a patent. So, they put that\nnarrowing language in there. And all that the Federal\ncircuit is saying when they put that narrowing language in\nthere, they should be held to it. And the reason they're\nheld to it is because of the public --\nQUESTION: Well, they're saying more than that.\nThey're saying they're held to it for the entire element,\nand that's where I have -- have great problems with --\nwith what the circuit does. And -- and it seems to me a\nvast extension over what we thought about in Warner-\nJenkinson.\nMR. NEUSTADT: In -- in Warner-Jenkinson this\nCourt said that if we do not know the reason for the\namendment, we're going to presume that it relates to\npatentability, and when we make that presumption, if it's\nnot rebutted, it will act as a bar. So, this Court in\nWarner-Jenkinson set forth a complete bar. Complete bar\nis nothing new.\nQUESTION: Well, why isn't that enough? Why --\nwhy is an additional rule sought?\nMR. NEUSTADT: The -- the additional rule\nrelates to the fact that in the Federal circuit, not in\nthis Court, there was what was called a flexible bar rule,\nand what they did was if you initially claimed glue and\ncame back to adhesives and then -- I'm sorry -- you\nclaimed adhesives and then you had to narrow it to glue,\nthen in a lawsuit you found someone using adhesives, you\nwould then say, well, my glue is really the same as\nadhesives under the doctrine of equivalents. And the\nFederal circuit in this decision is saying that you can't\ndo that.\nBut previously the Federal circuit had the\nflexible bar rule, and the flexible bar rule said that if\nyou went from adhesives to glue, and you didn't have to go\nall that way to glue -- maybe you could have stopped\nsomewhere in between -- they say you can then look at\nwhere you might have been able to stop. This is in the\nIntel brief, could have, should have, and would have. And\nthey say we can take it back to something in between\nadhesives and glue. And the problem with that is that the\npublic has no notice of what the claim covers. Someone\nout there who wants to innovate in the area between glue\nand adhesives has to know what he can do, and the Federal\ncircuit rule enables them now to say that, yes, that claim\nmeans glue and we don't have to worry about something if\nwe don't use glue. And --\nQUESTION: How would the SG's test apply to\nthat, do you think?\nMR. NEUSTADT: The -- the SG's test and also the\nIEEE test that you referred to -- the SE says -- and his\n-- his rule is a little better than the flexible bar rule.\nThe SG says we're going to have a complete bar\npresumption, and the presumption is going to have to be\novercome by the patentee, and he's going to have to show\nthat this was unforeseeable. But this rule has all of the\nuncertainties that create all the problems with the\nflexible bar rule, and therefore it really is not an\nimprovement.\nThe court's decision has been in effect for 13\nmonths. It's really worked just fine. There have been\nreally no problems. Patent prosecution hasn't changed at\nall. There haven't been any cases that follow that --\nQUESTION: Can you give me -- can you give me\nsome sense as to how often patent applications are\namended?\nMR. NEUSTADT: I don't think there are any\nstatistics. Patent applications -- I'd say 50 percent,\nmaybe more. But -- but that doesn't distinguish between\namendments and narrowing amendments. Usually it's the\nnarrowing amendments that -- that trigger the Federal\ncircuit rule.\nAnd with respect to --\nQUESTION: Because Mr. Bork says you're just\ngoing to transfer now the load to the appeals within the\nPatent Office and we're going to have this long, long\nrunning time.\nMR. NEUSTADT: No.\nQUESTION: And it seems to me that that --\nthat's a -- a very serious consequence if -- if it in fact\nwill follow.\nMR. NEUSTADT: We haven't notice that\nconsequence and that just isn't happening in the PTO. You\nsee nothing in the SG PTO brief.\nQUESTION: Well, maybe everybody is waiting for\nthis case.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. NEUSTADT: The -- that may be but the\nFederal circuit has -- has been applying this case in all\nof its cases. It's simplified a lot of the decisions.\nWhat it's meant is that patent attorneys can now advise\ntheir clients that, yes, you can do this; no, you can't do\nthat. Whereas, under the flexible bar rule, they were\nunable to do so.\nIn -- in -- when you claim, the claiming is\ncentral to -- to the system -- to our system. The\napplicant has a disclosure. From that disclosure, he can\ndecide what it is he wants to claim, and he can claim\nvarious elements and he usually does it as broadly as\npossible. The examiner then examines the claim on exactly\nwhat he claims, not the disclosure. The patentee is\nmaster of his claims. He decides what the issue is going\nto be.\nIf the examiner rejects the claim that was\nselected by the patentee, then -- then the patentee or the\napplicant says, well, there's nothing I can do now. I\neither have a choice of not getting a patent or I've got\nto limit my patent. So, he comes in and he limits his\npatent. He goes from adhesives to glue.\nThat patent issues and the public can then look\nat it. The patent tells you what you can't do, but more\nimportantly, it tells you what you can do. And the public\ncan do no better than look at the claim and its\nprosecution history, and when it does that, it can look\nand decide what it can do. And this results in increased\ninnovation.\nThis Court in Markman, interpreting claims, said\nthat claims, if they are uncertain -- and this was the\nneed for judges rather than juries to interpret them. If\nthey're uncertain, they foreclose an area of technology.\nIf you have uncertainty between here and here, no one will\ninnovate in that area because they recognize, if they're\nsuccessful, they're just going to be sued for infringement\nunder the doctrine of equivalents. They may have an\ninjunction entered against them, which is going to stop\ntheir production line, and they're going to have to give\nback profits which the patentee is going to ask for in\nlost profits.\nSo, everything really turns on the claims, and\nthe patent attorney has the tools to do it. He can use\n112, paragraph 6. He always claims as broadly as\npossible.\nAll that the Federal circuit has --\nQUESTION: The argument you're now making is a\nwonderful argument against the whole doctrine of\nequivalents, which I thought we had rejected.\nMR. NEUSTADT: The difference -- the difference\nbetween that is that the Federal circuit has limited its\nholding to the time when the patent applicant goes from\none claim to another claim where he narrows the claim. If\nhe doesn't narrow the claim, there's no problem with the\ndoctrine of equivalents. Also, if he doesn't narrow an\nelement, there's no doctrine of equivalents.\nAll that the Federal circuit has said here is\nthat the balance shifts with respect to the point that\nyou're referring to when the patent applicant, with his\neyes open, knows that he's got a problem and he's going to\nhave to narrow.\nQUESTION: Well, that may well be. But -- but\nif -- if the considerations that you're raising now are as\nforceful as you think they are, we should simply abolish\nthe doctrine of equivalents. That -- that would give\ngreat certainty to the patent law, and all of the -- all\nof the things that you assert would be achieved. The\npatentee is on notice and he should be as precise as\npossible, blah, blah, blah.\nMR. NEUSTADT: Well, that's not an issue before\nthe Court. But the -- the Federal circuit does restrict\nthe doctrine in -- doctrine of equivalents in other areas.\nFor example, you can have an argument that you make in\nyour -- in your amendment, and that argument can then be\nused against you as an estoppel. That's not an issue in\nthis case.\nThe Federal circuit also handled an issue where\nan applicant will disclose, say, three things, A, B, and\nC, and he'll only claim A. And then he'll come back and\nhe'll say, under the doctrine of equivalents, A covers B\nand C. And the Federal circuit deals with that. But\nthat's not an issue in this case.\nWhat the Federal circuit has done is they've\nhandled the exact issue that this Court handled in Exhibit\nSupply and in Warner-Jenkinson. And that is that the\nbalance shifts when you make an amendment that relates to\npatentability and --\nQUESTION: Mr. Neustadt, would you -- would you\ntell us why the approach of a complete bar is consistent\nwith the approach taken in Warner-Jenkinson where the\nCourt did not want to have a rigid -- a rule with no\nflexibility, and so it created this rebuttable\npresumption?\nMR. NEUSTADT: Yes. The Court in Warner-\nJenkinson was trying to decide between amendments that\nrelate to patentability and amendments that do not relate\nto patentability. And the petitioner in that case was\nasserting that that distinction was not an important\ndistinction. The Court in Warner-Jenkinson said we're not\ngoing to have a bright line rule that this complete bar is\ngoing to apply to every single amendment. It's only going\nto apply to those amendments that relate to patentability.\nAnd the Court said in the past we've used prior art as\nrelating to patentability, but the Court did not limit it\nto that.\nThe Federal circuit then came back and one of\nthe questions they had, they said, is 102 and -- is\nrelates to patentability under this Court's decision\nlimited to 102 and 103. And this is question one in the\nFederal circuit. And the Federal circuit held virtually\nunanimous, 11 to 1, that relates to patentability is not\nlimited to 102 and 103.\nQUESTION: But that's simply an interpretation\nof our cases. Or it should have been at any rate. And I\ndare say we're in a better position to interpret our cases\nthan the Federal circuit.\nMR. NEUSTADT: Well, I think the -- the Federal\ncircuit was saying that the cases of this Court were not\nabsolutely controlling, but what they would do would be\nconsistent with this Court. And that was -- that was the\neffect of their holding.\nBut if you look carefully -- look more carefully\nat this Court's cases, this Court's cases we submit in our\nbrief actually do control and would have necessitated the\nFederal circuit to reach that verdict. This Court, as I\nsaid --\nQUESTION: Well, there is an -- I think I agree\nwith Justice Ginsburg, as she suggested. I think there is\nan inconsistency between Warner-Jenkinson and the position\nyou're taking.\nMR. NEUSTADT: An inconsistency?\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. NEUSTADT: I don't think so because the --\nthe --\nQUESTION: Well, the remand in Warner-Jenkinson.\nMR. NEUSTADT: Yes. The remand in Warner-\nJenkinson, as specifically defined there, was for the\nFederal circuit to determine whether or not the amendment\nthat was made to change the pH to 6 related to\npatentability. The petitioner was saying you don't have\nto determine whether it relates to patentability. The\nremand said, Federal circuit, you now look and tell us\nwhether or not it relates to patentability, and that's\nwhat the Federal circuit did.\nAnd then as they had a few more cases after\nWarner-Jenkinson -- and they had -- they had disputes\namong the judges -- they said we're going to resolve this\nin this -- in this case. And they not only said they're\ngoing to rehear it en banc, but they said we're going to\nhave five questions. And the first question was -- was\nJustice Ginsburg's question.\nQUESTION: But I didn't mean it to be. I meant\nto focus you on the second question which you say is the\nmore important of the two, and --\nMR. NEUSTADT: The complete bar, yes.\nQUESTION: -- and just saying that in Warner-\nJenkinson, the Court didn't want to freeze things, so it\nhad this rebuttable presumption. You do want to, when you\nget to your question two, say absolute bar.\nMR. NEUSTADT: The absolute bar was in Warner-\nJenkinson. In Warner-Jenkinson, this Court said if the\namendment relates to patentability, then there's going to\nbe an absolute bar. The words this Court used was bar.\nThey didn't use absolute bar because a bar is a bar. But\n-- but -- and this Court was just following Exhibit Supply\nwhich had that same bar in that.\nQUESTION: Well, I thought everybody agreed that\nthe question was open, that this Court did not decide.\nMR. NEUSTADT: The Federal circuit said that\ntheir decision was not controlled by Exhibit Supply. Both\nour side and the Government side said that it is\ncontrolled by Exhibit Supply and that the Federal circuit\nwould have had to have reached that conclusion anyway.\nAnd -- and the -- the very plain language of Exhibit\nSupply is that when a patentee chooses to go from the\nclaim as unamended to make a narrow limitations in there,\nthere's a complete bar with respect to the amended\nelement. And Exhibit Supply, of course, talks about there\nis an abandonment and disclaimer of everything between the\nelement as unamended and as amended.\nAnd to --\nQUESTION: Could you explain to me a little more\nclearly what -- what you assert relates to patentability\nmeans? I mean, if -- if you narrow the phrase to mean it\n-- it relates only to prior art or to any impediment to\ngetting the invention accepted as novel or whatever, I\nunderstand what it means. But if it -- if it includes any\nchange that is made in order to get the examiner to accept\nthe patent, then what change does not relate to\npatentability? If -- if, as you assert, patent attorneys\nare so reluctant to make any changes, what change would\nnot relate to patentability? The only reason they're\ndoing it is to get the patent.\nMR. NEUSTADT: Yes. It's not changes. It's the\nnarrowing changes. You can make a lot of changes.\nQUESTION: Fine. What narrowing changes would\nnot relate to patentability?\nMR. NEUSTADT: There are very few changes where\nyou have significant narrowing that do not relate to\npatentability.\nQUESTION: I can't imagine any because why would\nyou do it unless --\nMR. NEUSTADT: Oh, well --\nQUESTION: -- unless to get the examiner to\naccept -- to accept your patent?\nMR. NEUSTADT: If you take out narrowing, you\ncan have a lot of changes. For example, you may file an\napplication and then broaden your claim.\nQUESTION: But -- but why -- why talk about\nchanges that relate to patentability? Why not just say\nall narrowing changes? Let's make it clear what we're\ntalking about. You're saying all narrowing changes.\nMR. NEUSTADT: And this is why the Federal\ncircuit had such virtual unanimity because --\nQUESTION: And -- and you think that that's --\nthat's what we meant in -- in Warner-Jenkinson by -- by\nchanges that relate to patentability. All narrowing\nchanges.\nMR. NEUSTADT: I think in Warner-Jenkinson the\nsubject wasn't specifically addressed. The Court\nrecognized that you have narrowing changes with respect to\nprior art.\nQUESTION: It would be a very strange\nterminology to use to refer to all narrowing changes.\nMR. NEUSTADT: Yes.\nQUESTION: You know, it doesn't seem to me\nsynonymous with patentability.\nMR. NEUSTADT: To -- to a certain extent, the --\nthe Federal circuit rule is even narrower than -- than\nWarner-Jenkinson because this Court in Warner-Jenkinson\ndid not refer to narrowing. It just referred to\namendments that relate to prior art, and there must have\nbeen an implicit assumption that that was -- that was\nnarrowing.\nThe Federal circuit, since they hear a lot of\npatent cases, focused more in on the fact that it really\nwasn't the fact that it was prior art. What you wanted to\nget at was important changes, and they -- they used the\nlanguage statutory requirements of patentability.\nFor example, one of the most important things is\nyour claim being supported by the disclosure. You can't\nclaim what you don't invent. So, if your claim is real\nbroad, the examiner says, but you've only disclosed this,\nso you can't foreclose all of this. And so then you have\nto narrow it down to this. And that's a 112 change, and a\n112 change is just as important as a 102 and a 103 change.\nAnd so the Federal circuit says if it's for a statutory\nrequirement for patentability. And these are not trivial\nchanges.\nA patent attorney, when an examiner makes a\nchange -- a suggested change, says, well, how can I do\nthat without narrowing.\nThe same thing with respect to clarity. You can\nmake changes with respect to clarity. Maybe the examiner\nlikes 12 feet rather than 144 inches. Maybe there are\nother things that he thinks will be more clear. As long\nas they're not narrowing, the patent attorney is happy to\nmake them, but as soon as he -- he narrows, he knows that\nhe's getting his client less.\nWith respect to foreseeability, I just wanted to\nmake one comment. Patent attorneys, when they draft broad\nclaims, they draft broad claims because they don't know\nwhat is going to happen in the future. They want the\nbroad claim because if something happens in the future,\nthey're going to be covered for it. Also, the patent\nattorney doesn't know everything that's happened in the\npast, and so he wants the broad claim because he gets much\nbetter coverage.\nFor example, you don't want to go to -- from\nadhesives to glue, because if you do that -- I'm sorry.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Neustadt.\nMr. Bork, you have 2 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT H. BORK\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. BORK: I wish to address this question of\nnarrowing. The concept of narrowing has no limits. In\nthis case, the Stoll patent moved one element -- an\nelement from one claim to another. No change, just moved\nfrom one claim to another. That was held to be a\nnarrowing. Now, if that's a narrowing, nothing is\nunrelated to patentability. That -- that's the extreme to\nwhich the Federal circuit takes this case.\nNow, as far as the Government is concerned, the\nGovernment I think didn't quote you the relevant language\nfrom their brief. They approvingly quoted as the law in\nWarner-Jenkinson -- that is, in filing in Warner-Jenkinson\n-- whenever a prosecution history estoppel is invoked,\nthere's a limitation to infringement under the doctrine of\nequivalents. A close examination must be made as to not\nonly what was surrendered but also the reason for such\nsurrender. That's the position that the -- this Court\nadopted in Warner-Jenkinson. It's the position that Festo\ntakes before this Court today.\nI should say that I don't -- when I answered\nyou, Justice O'Connor, I did not mean to say that a\nlimitation was the same as an amendment. It's just a\nstatement of the claim. A limitation is where the claim\nis when you first make it.\nThis case -- if what happened to Festo here and\nwhat's going to happen to other patentholders continues,\nthis case, were it not done by a court, were it done by\nany other agency, would be a taking under the\nConstitution. And that's why it's important that you --\nthis Court not approve a retroactive application of this\ndrastic new rule but require that it be done by Congress\nor by rulemaking by the Patent and Trademark Office.\nThank you.\nQUESTION: May I ask, since you do have a second\nleft, what -- what case of ours does -- other than Warner-\nJenkinson, does the new rule repudiate?\nMR. BORK: Almost all of them. For example, the\ndoctrine of equivalents goes back well into the last\ncentury. Winans against Denmead, 1853. There's an\nargument there about -- they don't call it the doctrine of\nequivalents then, but there's an argument there about\nwhether something fell under a patent claim and they say\nthat it's really the same thing, same principle as\ninvolved, and therefore --\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr. Bork.\n"
