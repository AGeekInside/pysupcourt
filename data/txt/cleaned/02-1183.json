DREEBEN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. DREEBEN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nBefore this Court's decision in Dickerson v.\nUnited States in the year 2000, it was the uniform rule in\nthe lower Federal courts that the failure to issue Miranda\nwarnings meant that the unwarned statement was not\nadmissible in the Government's case, but that there was no\nrequirement to suppress physical evidence that was derived\nfrom those unwarned statements.\nFollowing this Court's decision in Dickerson,\nwhich affirmed that Miranda has constitutional stature,\nthe majority of the Federal courts of appeals to address\nthe issue continued to adhere to the pre-Dickerson rule\nthat physical fruits of an unwarned statement were\nadmissible.\nIn this case, the Tenth Circuit broke ranks with\nthat uniform body of authority and held that, as a result\nof Dickerson's ruling that Miranda has constitutional\nstature, there is a derivative fruits suppression\ncomponent to the Miranda rule. That holding should be\nreversed.\nMiranda stands as a rule that implements the\nFifth Amendment, not by requiring the compulsion that the\nAmendment literally speaks of, but by providing an extra\nlevel of protection for the core of the Fifth Amendment\nright, the right for the defendant's own statements that\nare incriminating not to be used against him in a criminal\ntrial.\nQUESTION: Is it a Fifth Amendment right or not a\nFifth Amendment right?\nMR. DREEBEN: Justice Scalia, as I understand it,\nit is a right that implements the Fifth Amendment's\nprotection.\nQUESTION: It - it has to be based on something\nin the Constitution or we would have had to respect the\nstatute enacted by Congress in Dickerson. So it is -\nthere is obviously some provision of the Constitution that\nenabled us to disregard that statute. What - what\nprovision is that?\nMR. DREEBEN: The Fifth Amendment. What the -\nQUESTION: All right. It's a Fifth Amendment\nright then.\nMR. DREEBEN: What the Court concluded in Miranda\nand then reaffirmed in Dickerson is that the traditional\ntotality of the circumstances test for ascertaining\nwhether a statement is voluntary or has been compelled by\nthe Government is not adequate when the statements are\ntaken in the inherently pressuring environment of\ncustodial interrogation. And to provide an extra layer of\nprotection to avoid the violation of the defendant's Fifth\nAmendment rights, the Court adopted a prophylactic\nwarnings and wavier procedure.\nQUESTION: Whether it's prophylactic or not, it\nis a constitutional right, is it not? It is a\nconstitutional right.\nMR. DREEBEN: Justice Scalia, it is a\nconstitutional right that is distinct from the right not\nto have one's compelled statements used against oneself.\nQUESTION: Well, so is the constitutional right\nnot to be pistol-whipped in order to - to confess.\nMR. DREEBEN: Well -\nQUESTION: That's distinct from the introduction\nof the coerced confession at trial, but we don't\ndistinguish between the two, do we?\nMR. DREEBEN: Oh, I think you do, Justice Scalia.\nThat is a violation of the core due process right not to\nhave substantive violations of one's liberty interests.\nWhat we're talking about in this case is not a substantive\nviolation of the defendant's rights, but a procedural\nviolation of the Fifth Amendment that this Court has\ndefined in Miranda, but has defined it in a way that is\nhighly distinct from the basic, textually-mandated rule of\nthe Fifth Amendment that compelled statements may not be\nused.\nQUESTION: Let me - let me take out the pistol-\nwhipping. It - it - it is a coerced statement because of\nthe application of mental coercion. Now, that is not a\nviolation of the Fifth Amendment, I suppose, until the\nproduct of the - of the coercion is introduced at trial.\nWill you say the same thing?\nMR. DREEBEN: I would - I'm not sure, Justice\nScalia, that your question addresses what Miranda\naddressed. What Miranda addressed was a situation in\nwhich it was extremely difficult for the courts to sort\nout whether a statement was coerced or not coerced, and to\navoid the risk that an actually coerced statement would be\nused in evidence against the defendant, thus violating the\ncore Fifth Amendment right. The Miranda Court, as this\nCourt has later explained, adopted a presumption, a\npresumption for a limited purpose. In the government -\nQUESTION: May - may I ask a - a modified version\nof Justice Scalia's question? Supposing that the\nGovernment used official powers, such as a grand jury\nsubpoena or a congressional committee subpoena, to - to\nget a confession out of a person under threat of contempt\nof court, so it was clearly just a Fifth Amendment was a -\nhe made an answer that revealed the existence of the gun\nand then he - would that be a - would the gun be\nadmissible or un - inadmissible in that scenario?\nMR. DREEBEN: If your hypothetical, Justice\nStevens, presupposes an assertion of the Fifth Amendment\nright and actual compulsion of the -\nQUESTION: The threat of contempt, yeah.\nMR. DREEBEN: - information, presumably under a\ngrant of immunity, then the gun would not be admissible,\nbecause this Court has defined a violation of the Fifth\nAmendment that involves actual compulsion as entailing two\ndifferent evidentiary consequences. One evidentiary\nconsequence is that the statements themselves may not be\nused. The other evidentiary consequence is that nothing\nderived from the statements may be used. But the critical\nfeature of that hypothetical and its distinction from\nMiranda, is it involves actual compulsion. Miranda -\nQUESTION: Mr. Dreeben - Mr. - Miranda itself\nsaid, but unless and until such warnings and waivers are\ndemonstrated by the prosecution at trial, no evidence\nobtained as a result of interrogation can be used against\nhim, no evidence as a result of interrogation. That\nsounds like a - a - a derivative evidence rule to me.\nMR. DREEBEN: It does, Justice Ginsburg, and\nthere are many things in the Miranda opinion that have not\nstood the test of later litigation in this Court, because\nthey extended the implications of Miranda far beyond where\nthis Court has gone. And let me be precise about this.\nThe rule, at the time of Miranda and today, is that if\nthere is actual compulsion, the Government may not make\nuse of the actual statements that are taken or their\nevidentiary fruits. The Government may also not use that\nstatement for impeachment, and there is no public safety\nexception that could -\nQUESTION: Well, how are we going to determine\nactual compulsion if it's a situation where the police\nknowingly engage in conversation hoping to pick up\ninformation without giving the Miranda warnings, and then\nthe minute they start hearing something useful, give the\nwarnings, but then rely on what they learned earlier to\nfurther that information gathering. How - how do we parse\nthat out?\nMR. DREEBEN: Justice O'Connor, the determination\nof whether the statements reflect voluntariness at the\noutset and then a knowing and - and intelligent waiver of\nMiranda warnings later on after they are given needs to be\ndetermined based on the totality of the circumstances.\nBut this Court has recognized, in allowing the\nuse of unwarned statements for impeachment and in adopting\nthe public safety exception, and in permitting a second\nwarned statement, as the Court did in Oregon v. Elstad, to\nbe admitted into evidence, notwithstanding an earlier\nunwarned statement, that there is a difference between the\nMiranda presumption and a finding of actual compulsion.\nQUESTION: May I ask you - you mentioned the\npublic safety exception. We wouldn't - we really don't\nneed a public safety exception if you're correct in this\ncase, do we?\nMR. DREEBEN: No, we still do, because the\ncrucial thing about Miranda that is not challenged here is\nthat a failure to issue Miranda warnings, followed by\ncustodial interrogation, means that the unwarned statement\nis inadmissible in the Government's case in chief. That\nis the core ruling of Miranda.\nQUESTION: But the core ruling of the public\nsafety exception, as I remember it, is that you can use\nthe gun.\nMR. DREEBEN: No, the core ruling of the public\nsafety exception is that you can use the statement. The\nCourt held, in New York v. Quarles, that when pressing\npublic safety needs justify the conduct of custodial\ninterrogation without prior issuance of Miranda warnings,\nthat situation falls outside of the Miranda paradigm, and\nthe statements themselves can be used.\nNow, Justice O'Connor's dissenting opinion\nargued that there should be no exception for public safety\nfor the statements themselves, but the gun, as derivative\nevidence, should come in, because it was not the product\nof actual compulsion at which the Fifth Amendment is\naimed.\nQUESTION: Mr. -\nQUESTION: The - the difficulty that I have\naccepting that as the final answer is that there isn't any\nfunctional difference in a case like this between\nadmitting the statement, the admission that he had the gun\non the shelf in the bedroom, and admitting the gun. So\nthat, in functional terms, the - the Miranda protection,\neven as you describe it, disappears on your theory.\nMR. DREEBEN: Justice Souter, if - if I accept\nthat that accurately describes this case, it does not\naccurately describe the large class of cases in which\nphysical evidence is discovered as a result of unwarned\nstatements. In many -\nQUESTION: Mr. Dreeben, doesn't it occur - cover\nquite a wide number of cases? This was a case where the -\nthe crime that the police were after were - was gun\npossession. It might be narcotics possession, it might be\nstolen goods. And in all those situations, are you saying\nthat the constitutional rule is that a police chief can\nsay to his officers, go in and get him to tell you where\nthe narcotics are, where the gun is, where the stolen\ngoods are? We don't worry about his statement, but we\nwant the goods.\nMR. DREEBEN: Justice Ginsburg, that is my\nposition, but I don't think it would be a prudent policy\nfor law enforcement to adopt. This case may be one in\nwhich the Government can prove knowing possession of a\nfirearm by the defendant even without the benefit of his\nstatements, but police officers are not going to be able\nto predict in advance that that is going to be true in the\nvast majority of cases. What they are going to know is\nthat if you have a statement that links the defendant to\nthe gun, that allows you to show knowing possession. In\nthe absence of that, having the physical evidence alone\nwill not necessarily guarantee a conviction.\nQUESTION: You don't think the gun on the shelf\nin the guy's bedroom is going to be sufficient to prove\nknowing possession?\nMR. DREEBEN: Oh, I do in this case, Justice\nSouter.\nQUESTION: You know what's in your bedroom.\nMR. DREEBEN: I think that the Court should\ndecide this case not based on the particularities of this\nfactual scenario, but on the class of cases in which\nphysical evidence is at issue, and should regard the\nquestion of what incentives the police may have as\ninformed by the totality of cases that may arise.\nPolice officers who decide to conduct custodial\ninterrogation without giving Miranda warnings know that\nthey will not be able to use the statements that the\ndefendant makes in the Government's case in chief, and\nthey have no way of knowing before they conduct custodial\ninterrogation what the defendant may say. If the\ndefendant offers up information that is incriminating on\nunanticipated crimes or provides leads to information that\nthe police haven't previously anticipated, then the police\nofficers run two risks.\nThe first is that they won't be able to use\nthose statements against the defendant in the case in\nchief. The second is that by failing to issue Miranda\nwarnings, they increase the likelihood that a later court\nreviewing the facts will conclude that this is not a case\nof a mere failure to give Miranda warnings, but is a case\ninvolving actual compulsion. And if a court concludes\nthat the statements are actually compelled, involuntary -\nQUESTION: Well, Mr. Dreeben, supposing that the\npolice decide that they're going to follow this strategy\nthat is perhaps suggested by Justice Ginsburg. Would that\nitself be evidence of compulsion? In other words, they\nwon't give Miranda warnings and see - see what the person\nsays, then they give them. Would that be evidence of\ncompulsion?\nMR. DREEBEN: It would be evidence that a\ndefendant could argue is relevant, but I don't think that\nit would be evidence of compulsion. What's relevant in\nthe compulsion analysis is what the police officers\nactually say and do and communicate to the suspect. Their\nuncommunicated intent or law enforcement policies would\nnot add up to compulsion by itself.\nQUESTION: If we were to reject your position and\n- and say that this is purely a constitutional violation,\nwould you then lose the case?\nMR. DREEBEN: No, Justice Kennedy. The Court\nshould still do as it has done in other contexts, balance\nthe costs of a Miranda suppression remedy against whatever\nincremental benefits there may have.\nQUESTION: What's your -\nQUESTION: And why - why is this different than\nthe rule under the Fourth Amendment, say Wong Sun?\nMR. DREEBEN: What the Court has done in the\nFourth Amendment context is deal with an actual violation\nof the Fourth Amendment and establish very exclusion -\nvarious exclusionary rules that are designed to deter that\nkind of police conduct. The Miranda rule is very\ndifferent, because even if the Court holds that Miranda\nprescribes a rule of substantive conduct for the police,\nwhich we submit it does not, even if the Court were to\nhold that, it still is a rule that merely presumes\ncompulsion. It doesn't constitute a finding of actual\ncompulsion.\nQUESTION: Well, we said last year in Chavez that\nthe Miranda - that the Constitution was not violated by\nfailure to give Miranda warnings until they were offered\nin evidence, didn't we?\nMR. DREEBEN: That - that is correct, Mr. Chief\nJustice. But what the Court has done under the Fifth\nAmendment -\nQUESTION: Is it correct, was there a majority to\ntake that position?\nQUESTION: That was the trial court's opinion,\nwasn't it?\nQUESTION: That - that - I believe to - you're\ntaking all the opinions together. There were six votes\nfor that.\nMR. DREEBEN: I think this Court will be better\nable than I am to say what Chavez held.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. DREEBEN: But the - the reason that that\nprinciple alone does not decide this case is that the\nCourt has, in instances of actual compulsion out of court,\napplied a derivative evidence suppression rule. That's\nthe rule that the Court adopted in Counselman v.\nHitchcock, and it's followed it in its immunity line of\ncases where it has held that to displace the Fifth\nAmendment right against compelled self-incrimination, you\nneed to suppress both the statement and the fruits.\nQUESTION: Is part of your - is - is part of your\nreasoning that in the Fourth Amendment violation case,\nexclusion is the - really the best available, most direct\nremedy? And in - and in this case, there are other\nremedies, number one, excluding the statement, so that\nwhen you - when you find tangible evidence, it's - it's\njust a - an ancillary and less necessary remedy. Is that\nthe whole -\nMR. DREEBEN: That - that's -\nQUESTION: - thrust of the argument.\nMR. DREEBEN: That's the core of it, Justice\nKennedy. What the Court did in Miranda was create a rule\nthat operates in the very heart of the Fifth Amendment by\ncreating a prophylactic buffer zone against the risk, not\nthe certainty, but the risk, that actual compulsion has\nbeen exacted. It is that risk that the Fifth Amendment\ntargets as the core concern.\nQUESTION: What's the theory of the compulsion?\nThat is, what - why, assuming that there's compulsion but\nthere hasn't been an introduction of the statement that\nwas compelled into evidence. Under that - and suppose\nthat the compulsion doesn't rise to the level of the due\nprocess violation. I mean, I - maybe - maybe they all do,\nbut - but if they don't, then what's the theory of keeping\nout the evidence derived from that sort of compulsion.\nMR. DREEBEN: Justice Breyer, as the Court\nexplained it in its immunity line of cases, the starting\npoint of analysis is that a defendant under the Fifth\nAmendment can claim his privilege against testifying based\nnot only on incrimination from the statements that he\nmakes, but also that evidence that the Government can\nobtain as a result of the statements is incriminating.\nIf his testimony is a link in a chain of\nincrimination, he can stand silent, and the Court reasoned\nfrom that that the Government should not be able to\ncircumvent that right of the defendant not to be a witness\nagainst his - himself, by calling him out of court,\ncompelling testimony over his objection that - based on\nthe Fifth Amendment, and then obtaining the very\nincriminating information that the privilege shielded him\nfrom having to provide.\nQUESTION: So why doesn't all that apply here? I\nmean, is - is that - I can understand it if they compel\nthe testimony, then you introduce it. Then - then you\nhave the completed violation of what the Fifth Amendment\nforbids, all right, the completed violation. I can\nunderstand it if you compel the person to the extent that\nit violates the Due Process Clause, beating him up\nseverely, whatever.\nNow, I don't understand why, if you have neither\nof those two things, you would keep the evidence that's\nthe fruits out, under some theory that doesn't also say\nyou should keep this out.\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, the - the distinction between\nthis situation and the true compulsion situation is,\nMiranda does not involve an actual finding of compulsion,\nand the Court has been very frank about this. As a\nresult, the Court has repeatedly drawn distinctions\nbetween the use of unwarned statements and the use of\nactually compelled statements. Actually compelled\nstatements may not be used to impeach a defendant's trial\ntestimony. That too would violate the Fifth Amendment\nright.\nBut the Court held in - in the Hass case and in\nthe Harris case that statements that are merely unwarned,\nbut not compelled, can be used for impeachment. The Court\nsimilarly held in Michigan v. Tucker and then again in\nOregon v. Elstad that statements that are unwarned, but\nnot compelled, can be used as leads to find another\nwitness' testimony, or to obtain a second statement from\nthe defendant himself. And if -\nQUESTION: So is this distinction that the - that\n- that one case is just more egregious, more an affront to\nthe Constitution, more dangerous, i.e., physical\ncompulsion as opposed to the compulsion that's just\npresumed from Miranda?\nMR. DREEBEN: One case, Justice Kennedy, involves\na literal violation of the Fifth Amendment. Miranda\ninvolves a presumption that this Court -\nQUESTION: Well, then - then you're back into\nmetaphysics.\nMR. DREEBEN: It is a little metaphysical,\nJustice Kennedy, but there's a - a pot of truth, I think,\na pot of gold at the end of the rainbow here, which is\nthat the Miranda presumption does not mean, this Court has\nheld, that a statement is actually compelled. It protects\nagainst the most crucial right contained in the Fifth\nAmendment itself, which is -\nQUESTION: But you don't think we should\ndifferentiate based on the gravity of the - of the wrong\nin either case?\nMR. DREEBEN: You could look at it that - that\nway, Justice Kennedy. What - what the Court has done when\nit's dealt with a - a failure to issue warnings, is\nbalance. It has recognized that, by providing a rule that\npresumes compulsion in lieu of proving it, the Court has\ntaken a step beyond the core of the constitutional right\nitself, and the Court's language in its previous cases of\ncalling Miranda warnings and the exclusionary rule under\nMiranda a prophylactic right is understandable in that\nsense. Miranda excludes some statements that are not\ncompelled under the Fifth Amendment.\nQUESTION: May - may I ask this question, Mr.\nDreeben? The - there's a distinction in - in your - you\nsubmit, between a presumption of involuntariness and\nactual involuntariness. Do you know any other area of the\nlaw in which we've differentiated between a presumed\nresult and an actual result?\nMR. DREEBEN: I - I - I don't want to go off into\nan excursion into rules of law that might occur to me as I\nstand here, Justice Stevens. But what I do know is that\nthe Court's own Miranda jurisprudence -\nQUESTION: My understand - you're - you're -\nthere's - there's a lot in the case that support what you\nsay. But I'm suggesting it is kind of a unique\ndevelopment of the law, because normally I would think if\nyou presume X from Y, that would be the same as proving X.\nMR. DREEBEN: It -\nQUESTION: But you say that's new - that's not\ntrue in this line of - this area of the law?\nMR. DREEBEN: There is language in the Miranda\nopinion, as Justice Ginsburg has mentioned, that would\nsupport the view that the original vision of Miranda was\nthat it would constitute compulsion -\nQUESTION: Right.\nMR. DREEBEN: - not merely presume it. But as\nthe Court developed the rule and considered what the costs\nand benefits would be of having a rule that merely\npresumed compulsion, any context in which it was not\nnecessarily true. The Miranda Court itself recognized\nthat not all statements taken in custodial interrogation\nwithout warnings are compelled. Once you are dealing with\na prophylactic rule, it's incumbent upon the Court to\nbalance the benefits against the burdens of the rule.\nQUESTION: Of course, one of the benefits of -\nunder the Miranda analysis, we will - we avoid the\nnecessity of resolving difficult issues of fact sometimes.\nThere are a lot of borderline cases to whether there\nreally was compulsion or it's just presumed. We'll have\nto get back into that, under your view.\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, I think the Court has put\nitself back into it by adopting the holdings that permit\nstatements that are not warned to be used for impeachment\nand to be used to obtain leads for other witnesses.\nQUESTION: Well, I guess we tell juries they can\ndisregard presumptions, but they can't disregard facts.\nMR. DREEBEN: And I think that that's what the\nCourt has really decided is the right approach when you\nare outside the core concern that the Miranda Court was\naddressing, namely the use of the unwarned statement\nitself. There is a terrible cost to the truth-seeking\nfunction of a criminal trial to suppress reliable,\nphysical evidence that was obtained not as the result of a\ncore constitutional violation involving literal compulsion\nor a substantive due process violation, but merely a\nfailure to issue warnings.\nQUESTION: It's a terrible cost, but it's a\nterrible cost for which the law provides a ready means of\navoidance. I mean, Miranda's been around for a long time.\nThere is - there's no excuse at this point in our history\nfor the police to say, gee, I - I don't quite understand\nwhat Miranda is getting at. And - and that's why it seems\nto me the cost argument is a weak one -\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, I -\nQUESTION: - and is a - let me just finish this\nsentence. And as against that weak argument, there seems\nto me a fairly strong argument that if you accept your\nposition, there is a, in - in effect, a recipe for\ndisregarding Miranda, because in every physical evidence\ncase, as in Justice Ginsburg's examples, there's going to\nbe an inducement to say, never mind the statement, just\nget the evidence, the evidence will take care of the case.\nSo I - it - it - it's seems to me that we got a\nweak argument on one side and a strong argument on the\nother side.\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, there - I - the argument\nbased on cost, Justice Souter, is - is not weak, because\nthe costs are quite real. The jury does not hear the\nevidence that's suppressed -\nQUESTION: The costs are quite real, but the\nstate knows how to avoid having to pay those costs. It\ngives the warning.\nMR. DREEBEN: This Court has repeatedly\nrecognized though that there are situations in which there\nare ambiguities in the way that Miranda actually applies,\nand law enforcement officers are going to make mistakes in\nthe way that they apply Miranda.\nQUESTION: I thought the main rule was, the\npolice, when they take someone into custody, are supposed\nto give them four warnings, and that seems to me a simple,\nclear rule. Now you - you're shifting this to say, well,\nthey don't have to give the warnings up front, that's\nokay.\nMR. DREEBEN: Yes, Justice Ginsburg. Our\nposition is that if they don't give the warnings up front,\nthey lose the statement that is taken without warnings.\nThat is the Miranda rule, and it responds to the core\nconcern that Miranda had.\nThe question is, how much further should that\nrule go? And, as I think I answered Justice Souter and\nyourself earlier, police officers do not know before they\nget hold of evidence whether they are going to be able to\nlink it to the defendant with other admissible evidence\nand prove the violation at trial. They are much better\noff following the Miranda script, getting the admissible\nevidence of - of the defendant's own statements, and using\nit to tie the defendant to the evidence. And in a large\npercent -\nQUESTION: Then - then why do we have - if that's\nthe case, why do we have a case coming up in - in a few\nminutes in which a - a contrary policy has been adopted?\nI mean, it - your - your statement that - that the police\nhave much to gain and much to lose if - if - if they - if\nthey follow the practice of avoiding the warnings is - is\nnot intuitively clear this morning.\nMR. DREEBEN: Justice Souter, I think as the\nCourt will hear more in the next hour, the - the officer\nin that case acknowledged that he was rolling the dice.\nThere are many reasons why -\nQUESTION: And there was a policy to roll the\ndice.\nMR. DREEBEN: That officer testified that he had\nbeen trained to do that -\nQUESTION: Yeah.\nMR. DREEBEN: - and he decided that - that he\nwould in that case. The FBI policy has been, even before\nMiranda and continuing to this day, that you issue the\nwarnings. You avoid difficult voluntariness inquiries,\nyou smooth the path to admissibility of the evidence, you\nensure that the warned statements are admissible.\nQUESTION: No, I - I'm - I'm sure that that is\nthe FBI policy, but it - the point is, there is a\nsubstantial, apparently a substantial body of thought\noutside the FBI within American law enforcement that dice-\nrolling pays off.\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, it - I think that in many\ncases it pays off with risks that responsible law\nenforcement officers often choose not to run.\nIf I could reserve the remainder of my time.\nQUESTION: Very well, Mr. Dreeben.\nMs. Wichlens, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JILL M. WICHLENS\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMS. WICHLENS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and\nmay it please the Court:\nI'd like to begin by responding to the\nGovernment's argument that Miranda warnings are not a\nrequirement, they may be simply a matter of proving\npolicy, but are not a requirement. Just three terms ago,\nthis Court reaffirmed in Dickerson that - and I'm quoting\nfrom Dickerson - Miranda requires procedures that will\nwarn a suspect in custody of his right to remain silent,\nwhich will assure the suspect that the exercise of that\nright will be honored.\nQUESTION: Yeah, but I think, Ms. Wichlens, if\nyou read through the entire opinion in Dickerson, it's\nclear that the warnings are required in order to make the\nstatements admissible. They don't say that mere failure\nto give the warnings without seeking to follow up with\nadmission is a constitutional violation.\nMS. WICHLENS: That's correct, Your Honor, but in\nthis case they are seeking to admit the evidence. So if\nthere are two components to a Miranda violation, one being\nthe violation in the field by the police officer, the\nsecond component is admitting the evidence at trial, and\nthat is exactly what the Government is attempting -\nQUESTION: Well, is - isn't this a fruits case?\nMS. WICHLENS: It is a fruits case, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: It's not the statement.\nMS. WICHLENS: Correct.\nQUESTION: It is - it is derivatively obtained\ninformation.\nMS. WICHLENS: Absolutely, absolutely.\nQUESTION: Which might make a difference to you.\nMS. WICHLENS: It could make a difference, and -\nQUESTION: At least I've thought so.\nMS. WICHLENS: Absolutely, Your Honor, and\nfollowing up on a question asked by Justice Kennedy,\nwhether, if this is a constitutional violation, the\nderivative evidence rule, the fruits rule, would apply.\nAnd my answer to that is yes, absolutely, under Wong Sun.\nIf this is a constitutional violation, it would apply in\nChavez, just -\nQUESTION: Well, what - what's the magic about\nthat metaphysical rule when we're talking about a\ndifferent amendment and a different kind of statement or a\ndifferent kind of - a different kind of evidence than is\nin the - than the rule itself was designed for primarily?\nI mean, I don't know why we're just bound by that\nmetaphysical rule.\nMS. WICHLENS: Your Honor, I'm speaking of Wong\nSun for the general proposition that when we have a\nconstitutional violation, turning to the Fifth Amendment\nspecifically, the amendment that we're, of course,\nconcerned with here. In Chavez, a plurality - the\nplurality opinion in Chavez made it clear that if we have\na violation of the Fifth Amendment, then application of\nthe derivative evidence rule is virtually automatic.\nNow, my argument doesn't rest entirely on the\nargument that this is a constitutional violation. My\nfirst position is that, if it is, it's an automatic\napplication of the derivative evidence rule. But even if\nit is not, then we go to a balancing and we balance the\ncosts, the benefits of applying a derivative evidence\nrule.\nQUESTION: Why - why would there be any cost here\nto anything if you took the position, as we might take,\nthat if a policeman goes in and purposely doesn't give the\nwarnings when he knows that he should, or even if he\nreasonably should know and doesn't, we're not going to let\nin derivatives.\nMS. WICHLENS: Your Honor -\nQUESTION: But in the unusual case, we're quite -\nit was an honest mistake, as it could be here, because he\ntried to give the warnings and the defendant said, no, no,\nI know what they are, okay. So - so what cost, if - if -\nthere?\nMS. WICHLENS: Justice Breyer, we need a bright\nline in this area of the law. This Court has virtually\nalways applied bright lines, particularly in the area of a\nMiranda violation.\nQUESTION: Well, we've had - we've had, Ms.\nWichlens, probably somewhere between 40 and 50 cases since\nMiranda was decided, deciding was this interrogation or\nwas it not, was this custody or was it not. There are\nfactual disputes about every single aspect of Miranda.\nMS. WICHLENS: I think Your Honor's cases, which\nwere, particularly in the early years following Miranda,\nhave now made those rules quite clear what is\ninterrogation, what is custody -\nQUESTION: Well, we - we apply in this area, as\nregrettably in a lot of others, what we call the totality\nof the circumstances test. Do you call that a bright\nline?\nMS. WICHLENS: Well -\nQUESTION: It seems to me the fuzziest of all\nlines.\nMS. WICHLENS: For the voluntariness\ndetermination, it is a fuzzy totality of the\ncircumstances, but no, in Miranda, we apply bright lines\ndetermining whether there was interrogation, whether there\nwas custody. We don't try to get inside the head of the\nindividual police officers -\nQUESTION: Well, the brightest line, it seems to\nme, would be if the policeman knew or should have known\nthat he was supposed to give a warning, fine, the evidence\nstays out.\nMS. WICHLENS: Your Honor -\nQUESTION: But now all we're excluding, we're\njust letting in evidence in those cases where it genuinely\nis fuzzy and no policeman knows what he's supposed to do,\nor - or it's at least reasonable for him not to know.\nNow, under those circumstances, what you do is lose\nevidence, lose evidence that could be useful in convicting\na criminal, and what you gain is precisely nothing, since\nthe policeman, by definition, was confused about the\nmatter and reasonably so. Now, what's the answer to that?\nMS. WICHLENS: The answer to that is, drawing\nthat bright line, if it is one, Your Honor, I think does\nrequire us to get inside the head of the police officer.\nIt requires us to make determinations about whether it was\nreasonable or not. An individual police officer may have\nmixed motives. We're not giving -\nQUESTION: We're - we're - we're saying whether a\nreasonable police officer in the - in the position of this\npolice officer, would have - would have made the mistake.\nMS. WICHLENS: If -\nQUESTION: Just as - just as you say, you say for\ncustody we apply a bright line. We don't apply a bright\nline for custody. The test for custody is whether -\nwhether a - a reasonable person would have believed, given\nthe totality of the circumstances, that he was free to\nleave.\nMS. WICHLENS: Perhaps, Your Honor, I -\nQUESTION: That - that is anything but bright.\nMS. WICHLENS: Perhaps I shouldn't say bright\nline. What I mean is objective versus subjective, and\nwhat I urge this Court not to do is impose a subjective\ntest, which requires us to get inside the head of the\npolice officer.\nQUESTION: Okay. Well, we can apply objective -\nan objective test then.\nMS. WICHLENS: Under an -\nQUESTION: If a reasonable police officer in the\nposition of this police officer would - would have been\nconfused about the necessity of giving a Miranda warning,\nthen you're - we're at a different situation.\nMS. WICHLENS: And if it is an objective test,\nJustice Scalia, then in this case the police officer fails\nthat test.\nQUESTION: Well, not necessarily. Didn't the\nsuspect here say, don't give me that warning, I know what\nmy rights are, I know about that.\nMS. WICHLENS: The record shows that the\ndetective said, you have the right to remain silent. Mr.\nPatane said, I know my rights. Then the detective - and\nthis is the most crucial thing - is the detective not only\ndidn't go on to read the other very critical Miranda\nrights, also didn't obtain a knowing waiver. He didn't -\nQUESTION: No, wait, you left out - he said it\ntwice, you have the right to remain silent. Patane says,\nI know my rights. The detective says, you know your\nrights?\nMS. WICHLENS: Correct.\nQUESTION: And the - Patane says, yeah, yeah, I\ndo.\nMS. WICHLENS: Correct. What he didn't say -\nQUESTION: I know my rights.\nMS. WICHLENS: What he didn't say was, do you\nknow your right to have counsel here present, Mr. Patane?\nQUESTION: No, no, I understand that a lawyer\nmight have - who really knows this area, might have\nunderstood that you have to do more than that. But is it\nfair to ask a policeman who's on the line of duty when he\ntries twice to read him the rights, and each time the\ndefendant says, no, I know them, forget it. Is it fair to\nask the policeman to be the lawyer who has to know you\nhave to go and get out a paper and have him sign it and so\nforth?\nMS. WICHLENS: It is absolutely fair to require\nthat of a police officer. He doesn't have to be a lawyer,\nYour Honor. He has to have attended police academy 101.\nYou read four warnings to a defendant, a suspect, after\nyou arrest him. That is not -\nQUESTION: Well, we're talking here about fruits,\nthe location of the gun and the gun.\nMS. WICHLENS: Correct.\nQUESTION: And ever since Oregon v. Elstad, which\nsaid it didn't apply to fruits, all the courts of appeals\nin the Federal circuits, but one, have said it comes in.\nMS. WICHLENS: That's correct, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: I - this is the - from the one circuit\nthat holds otherwise.\nMS. WICHLENS: That's correct.\nQUESTION: And it hasn't resulted in disaster,\nhas it?\nMS. WICHLENS: I think it is approaching\ndisaster, Your Honor, and the case that's going to follow\nthis one is at one end of the spectrum. We have lawyers\nin California going on record instructing police officers\nto violate Miranda on purpose, and they actually use that\nword.\nQUESTION: When you say violate, Miranda, Miranda\nis - is not a command that prohibits police officers, or\nthat requires police officers to give the statements.\nIt's a - it's a - it's a conditional thing. Unless they\ngive the statements, the stuff can't be admitted in\nevidence.\nMS. WICHLENS: I respectfully disagree with that,\nYour Honor. I think Dickerson has made it clear it is a\ncommand. Miranda -\nQUESTION: I think - well, I think, having\nwritten Dickerson, I think differently.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: You're - and you're entitled to read\nthe opinion as you wish.\nMS. WICHLENS: I understand, Your Honor. The way\nI read Miranda, its progeny, all the way up to Dickerson\nand including Dickerson, which, of course, you, Your\nHonor, Mr. Chief Justice, are the authority on, is that\nthere are two components to a Miranda rule. If the\nexclusion of evidence is the core of the rule, well then\nthe warning requirement is the rest of the apple. There\nare two components to the rule, and police officers are\nbeing instructed out in the field to violate, to ignore\nthe first part of the rule.\nQUESTION: Well, that's not this case. You're\narguing somebody else's case. That certainly isn't this\ncase.\nMS. WICHLENS: Your Honor, I am trying to argue\nthe implications of this case.\nQUESTION: Well, that's why I raised the point,\nbecause it seems to me you could have one simple rule\nmaybe. I'm just tying - trying it out for all these\ncases. You say if the policeman knew or reasonably should\nhave known, well, we're talking about derivative evidence,\nnot - not the evidence itself, but derivative - knew or\nreasonably should have known, keep it out. But if in fact\nit was really an honestly borderline thing, at least if\nwe're talking about derivative, then no, you don't have to\nkeep it out.\nNow, that's simple and we'd send yours back\nmaybe to find out whether he reasonably knew or should\nhave known, et cetera. And I'm testing it on you. I want\nto see what your reaction is.\nMS. WICHLENS: Understood. Understood, Your\nHonor. I think we - we could pass that test, and, of\ncourse, it would need to be sent back -\nQUESTION: Oh no, I'm not - I don't - I'm not so\ninterested whether you pass it or not if you don't have\nto. But I'm interested in what you think of it.\nMS. WICHLENS: My preferred test is, you have a\nMiranda violation, you suppress derivative evidence. I\nthink that's the simplest rule, Your Honor, with all\nrespect. But if we do have an objective reasonableness\ntest, in this case and others like it, it's not\nobjectively reasonable to think you can forego three of\nthe four Miranda warnings, and it's certainly not\nobjectively reasonable to think that you don't have to get\nthe suspect to waive those rights before you go on.\nQUESTION: Well, so - so far as the defendant is\nconcerned, what - what difference does it make to him\nwhether the officer's failure to give the warnings was\nintentional or just negligent?\nMS. WICHLENS: No difference whatsoever, Your\nHonor, none whatsoever. The suspect is still not informed\nof his constitutional rights. That's why I believe a\nbrighter line, a simpler test, if you will, Your Honor, is\nmore appropriate. But even under an objective\nreasonableness test, the Miranda violation in this case\nwas certainly not objectively reasonable.\nQUESTION: What -\nQUESTION: May I ask you a background question?\nI think most cases you know whether there was a duty to\ngive the Miranda warnings. Just take a case where it's\nclear the officer failed in the - in the duty to give a\nwarning. Is it not correct, as your opponent argued in\nthe first sentence of his oral presentation, that the law\nhas generally been settled for a long time that fruits are\nnevertheless admissible, and what's your response to that\nargument?\nMS. WICHLENS: My response to that, Your Honor,\nis I think the lower courts have been mistaken. What they\nhave done is taken the language in Elstad, and that\ndecision, of course, did include some language about\nphysical evidence, it was dicta in that case, and that's -\nQUESTION: But I would think very, very sound\ndicta.\n(Laughter.)\nMS. WICHLENS: Well, with respect, Your Honor -\nQUESTION: It makes a very simple rule. You can\nlet it in.\nMS. WICHLENS: With respect -\nQUESTION: There's your simplicity.\nMS. WICHLENS: With respect, Your Honor, it makes\nthings simpler, but it doesn't achieve the purposes here\nfor the reasons that some of the Justices here today have\npointed out. In the case of physical evidence, the\nphysical evidence is the equivalent of the statements.\nThe police officers -\nQUESTION: Well, let me - let me ask you this,\nand I'll - I'll go back and read Miranda to - to make\nsure. To what extent was the Miranda rule founded on the\nconcern that compelled statements - we'll call them that -\nare unreliable? Wasn't that a - a significant factor?\nMS. WICHLENS: That was one of the factors.\nQUESTION: Now, when you have tangible evidence,\nthen the reliability component substantially drops out of\nthe case.\nMS. WICHLENS: That's correct, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: And it seems to me that that makes\nthe, what you call dicta in Elstad, with reference to\nphysical evidence, point to a case that's even easier than\none - than the one that was in Elstad.\nMS. WICHLENS: Well, Your Honor, I disagree with\nthe conclusion there, because the flip side of that is the\n- the reliability of the physical evidence and the fact\nthat if the police find out where it is through a Miranda\nviolation, they just go and pick it up. That's what makes\nphysical evidence different, and that what - that is what\nmakes the deterrence factors different here. And so -\nQUESTION: Well, it certainly is reliable.\nThere's no question that it's reliable.\nMS. WICHLENS: There's - there's no question.\nPhysical evidence is what it is. I - I don't -\nQUESTION: Then that's - I think that's the point\nJustice Kennedy was making -\nMS. WICHLENS: Understood.\nQUESTION: - that the statement might not be\nreliable. Now, there - there may be other things that\nwork in Miranda, not just to make sure that the statement\nis reliable.\nMS. WICHLENS: Absolutely, Your Honor. The other\nthing that's at work in Miranda and in the Fifth Amendment\nitself is the notion that the Fifth Amendment isn't just a\nrule of evidence, just a rule designed to ensure reliable\nevidence. It's also a rule that recognizes that in a free\nsociety, it's repugnant to the concepts of - concept of\nordered liberty to compel a citizen to incriminate\nhimself. And so that -\nQUESTION: But we do - we do have a number of\nthings that are permissive - permissible, like a - a voice\nexemplar -\nMS. WICHLENS: Correct.\nQUESTION: - or a blood test.\nMS. WICHLENS: Because none of those involve any\ntestimonial aspect whatsoever, this Court has made very\nclear. And so we don't really have the derivative\nevidence rule, the fruit rule, even at issue in those\ncases. There's no violation whatsoever in those cases,\nYour Honor. There's no tree, so there can be no fruit.\nHere, we do have a violation.\nQUESTION: You have to wind up the rhetoric to a\nhigh degree to say that all of society finds this\nrepugnant. The man twice said he didn't want his warnings\nand he had a gun in the house he wasn't supposed to have.\nMS. WICHLENS: And we don't know that he knew he\nhad a right to counsel to be there while Detective Benner\nwas saying, you need to tell us about the gun, Mr. Patane.\nI'm not sure I should tell you about the gun, you might\ntake it away from me. You need to tell us about the gun.\nIf you want to get in front of the domestic violence case,\nyou need to tell us about the gun. I think that is -\nQUESTION: Well, half the problem is that that\nisn't - I mean, it begs the question to say that that's\ncontrary to established ordered liberty, et cetera,\nbecause that is the question.\nMS. WICHLENS: It's -\nQUESTION: Everybody, I guess, agrees that it\ndoes violate those basic principles to permit questioning\nof the person, compel a statement and then introduce that\nstatement into evidence.\nMS. WICHLENS: It -\nQUESTION: But apparently, for many, many years,\npeople haven't agreed under the same circumstances that it\nviolates ordered liberty to get a statement and get\nphysical evidence and introduce the physical evidence.\nMS. WICHLENS: What I'm talking about, Your\nHonor, are the two bases underlying the Fifth Amendment,\ngoing way back now, not just reliability, but also\nconcepts of, in a free society, should we compel people to\nincriminate themselves? I understand that there has been\na lot of water under the bridge since the framers came up\nwith the Fifth Amendment, but I was answering the\nquestions in terms of -\nQUESTION: And a lot of it was that the police\nused to beat people up, say, they beat people up. Now,\nthat's very repulsive.\nMS. WICHLENS: That's correct.\nQUESTION: But the answer to that is that if they\ncome even close to that, we'll keep the statement out and\nwe will also keep the fruits out.\nMS. WICHLENS: That's correct, Your Honor. But\nhere -\nQUESTION: The - the difference is Miranda\ndoesn't assume compulsion. You're talking as though\nMiranda - Miranda is a compulsion case. It isn't. It -\nit's a prophylactic rule, even when there has been no\ncompulsion -\nMS. WICHLENS: It's a -\nQUESTION: - we keep it out -\nMS. WICHLENS: It's a -\nQUESTION: - we keep it out.\nMS. WICHLENS: It's a prophylactic rule required\nby the Constitution, of course.\nQUESTION: That may well be, but you can't make\nyour argument as though what's at issue here is compulsion\nand our society has set its face against - against the use\nof anything obtained by compulsion. There - there is not\nnecessarily compulsion. In fact, there usually isn't\ncompulsion simply because a Miranda warning is - is not\ngiven. I expect this - this - this individual in this\ncase did indeed know his rights.\nMS. WICHLENS: We don't -\nQUESTION: I - I think probably most of the\npeople in this room could read - could - could recite\nMiranda just from - just from listening to it on\ntelevision so often.\nMS. WICHLENS: Well, Your Honor, when I pose that\nquestion at cocktail parties, people generally fall off\nwith the fourth - the fourth warning. They don't realize\nthat they would have a right to counsel appointed -\nQUESTION: Well, I mean, that might depend on how\nlate in the cocktail party. I mean, we -\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: I'm not in any position to pose the\nquestion later in the cocktail party, Your Honor. The\nimportance is that the Fifth Amendment protects two\nthings, and Miranda, of course, protects the Fifth\nAmendment. And if we give the police officer in the field\na pass to say, Miranda's optional, you can do a cost-\nbenefit analysis, you can decide whether you think the\nstatements are really what's going to be important, or you\ncan decide that it's the derivative evidence, the fruit of\nthose statements that's going to be important. We don't\nhave much of a rule at all.\nAs the Tenth Circuit summed it up very aptly, I\nthink, quoting from the decision of the Tenth Circuit,\nfrom a practical perspective, we see little difference\nbetween the confessional statement, the Glock is in my\nbedroom on a shelf, which even the Government concedes\nclearly excluded under Miranda and Wong Sun, and the\nGovernment's introduction of the Glock found in the\ndefendant's bedroom on the shelf. It's the same thing in\nthe context of physical evidence.\nQUESTION: But - but the latter you know is true.\nThe former may - may have been the product of coercion and\nbe false.\nMS. WICHLENS: Correct, Your Honor, but this is -\nQUESTION: So, I mean, that's a big difference if\nyou think the primary purpose of Miranda is to prevent\nfalse testimony from - from being introduced, then it\nseems to me quite reasonable to say that police can indeed\nmake the choice, do I want to use this testimony. If I\ndon't want to use this testimony, I won't give a Miranda\nwarning, and anything the testimony leads to, if it leads\nto anything, I - I don't know how the police will always\nknow that - that it will lead to something, so I - I think\nit's a - a pretty high risk enterprise.\nBut what's - what's wrong with it if - if you\nthink the primary - the primary function of Miranda is to\nprevent browbeaten statements by - by - by confused people\nin custody who - who confess mistakenly?\nMS. WICHLENS: The problem is, it lets the\nindividual officer on the street decide whether he or she\nis going to give the Miranda warnings in a particular case\nor not. That's not a rule that law enforcement is behind\nin, here I'm referring to an amicus filed in - in the\ncompanion case of Seibert.\nLaw enforcement doesn't want such a rule, if I\nmay be so bold to say that, in general. They don't want\nthe police officers to have to be trained in the police\nacademy to be a lawyer basically, Your Honor, and try to\ndecide which evidence is going to be most important -\nQUESTION: Well, what - what is your authority,\nMs. Wichlens, for saying that law enforcement doesn't want\nthis sort of a rule?\nMS. WICHLENS: Well, Your Honor, what I'm\nreferring to there very specifically is an amicus filed in\nthe Seibert case by former law enforcement and\nprosecution.\nQUESTION: And you think they represent the views\nof, quote, law enforcement, closed quote, generally?\nMS. WICHLENS: Your Honor, I'm a public defender.\nI can't speak for the interests of law enforcement.\nPerhaps I've been presumptuous to -\nQUESTION: Well, you were - you were told in the\nargument by Mr. Dreeben that that is the practice of the\nFBI and the Federal law enforcement officers.\nMS. WICHLENS: That's - that's correct. Prudent\npolice officers, as I understood him to say, will go ahead\nand give the warnings. But we have some very, if I may\nsay imprudent officers out there, at least in Missouri and\nCalifornia. We know about those. And there are now Web\nsites that police officers can go on to that instruct in\nthis method, instruct police officers to try to decide\nwhat's really important in the case, put themselves in the\nposition of the DA, I suppose, and decide whether the\nstatements are really going to make the case or, in a\npossessory case, is it the physical evidence that's really\ngoing to make the case?\nIn this case is a perfect example of that.\nThe information was, he keeps it on his person or in his\ncar or in his home. They're going to investigate a felon\nin possession of a firearm case. If they find that\nfirearm in his bedroom or in his car, that's pretty much\nall she wrote. The prosecution doesn't need a lot more.\nThey don't need the suspect's statements about where that\nis, and so that's why we can draw a line between physical\nevidence and other types of evidence.\nAnd I could add -\nQUESTION: All right. So what? That's - we're\ngoing to the same thing - let's suppose they found out\nabout that gun without compelling anything, no compulsion\n-\nMS. WICHLENS: But violating Miranda.\nQUESTION: - no testifying against yourself.\nMS. WICHLENS: But violating the Miranda rule.\nQUESTION: But they didn't omit - they omitted\nthe Miranda warning.\nMS. WICHLENS: And we -\nQUESTION: And the Miranda warning is a way of\nstopping the compulsion. But if you're willing to assume\nthere is no compulsion, what's so horrible about it?\nMS. WICHLENS: Well, I'm - I'm not willing to\nassume there is no compulsion.\nQUESTION: Ah, well if there is - then what\nyou've got is Miranda as a way of getting at instances\nwhere there is compulsion.\nMS. WICHLENS: Absolutely.\nQUESTION: Fine.\nMS. WICHLENS: Absolutely. That is the basic\npremise of Miranda.\nQUESTION: Does that apply to the physical\nevidence too?\nMS. WICHLENS: Yes. I mean, the - the basic\npremise, if we want police officers to comply with\nMiranda. And if I could say another word about Elstad,\npart of - a central part of the holding in Elstad, as I\nunderstand it, was that in that case, the initial\nconstitutional violation is cured by the time the\nsubsequent statement comes around. In other words, you\nhave a Miranda violation, the Miranda warnings are not\nread, the person is interrogated, then the Miranda\nwarnings are carefully and thoroughly read.\nAnd as this Court stated in Elstad, and I'm\nquoting, a careful and thorough administration of Miranda\nwarnings serves to cure the condition that rendered the\nunwarned statements inadmissible. We can't possibly have\nthat type of cure in the case of physical evidence. When\nthe police officer is going simply to seize the physical\nevidence, there's no curing of the Miranda violation, and\nthat's another way that Elstad is distinguishable.\nQUESTION: But was there never a question in this\ncase of whether the - there was consent to this search,\nbecause the defendant said twice, I know my rights?\nMS. WICHLENS: And you're speaking of the consent\nto the search, Your Honor? Because then Detective Benner -\nQUESTION: Consent to the questioning, and then\nvoluntarily telling them, it's on a shelf in my bedroom?\nWhy wasn't the - the whole thing pretty much like when you\ngo to the bus terminal and say, mind if I ask you a\nquestion?\nMS. WICHLENS: Your Honor, because he was under\narrest. He - he had been told he was under formal arrest.\nHe was in handcuffs. And so the Miranda warnings - the\nMiranda warning requirement clearly applied. And so\nDetective Benner was not to ask those questions without\nhaving warned him first.\nQUESTION: Okay. Well, that's just a silly rule,\nisn't it? I mean -\nMS. WICHLENS: Miranda's not a silly rule, Your\nHonor.\nQUESTION: Well, it - it is when the person says,\nI know my right. What if he stuck his fingers in his\nears, saying, I don't want to hear them, I don't want to\nhear them.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: But you have to read it to him anyway?\nMS. WICHLENS: It's not hard to say, sorry, pal,\nI have to read them to you, and even if you don't want to\nrequire the officer to do that, how about, okay, pal,\nwould you like to waive those rights? That's an important\npart of Miranda law also: A, inform the suspect of his\nrights, B, ask him if he would like to waive them.\nQUESTION: We take the case on the assumption,\nthe Government's question that there was a failure to give\na suspect the Miranda warnings here, do we not?\nMS. WICHLENS: Correct. Although the\nGovernment's concession in the lower courts, district\ncourt and Tenth Circuit, is that Miranda was violated\nbecause there was a lack of a knowing waiver of those\nMiranda rights, and that's the basis on which the district\ncourt accepted the Government's concession. But the -\nQUESTION: What did the court of appeals - what\ndid the court of appeals -\nMS. WICHLENS: The court of appeals assumed a\nMiranda violation, and I believe repeated the language\nabout the waiver problem.\nQUESTION: May I ask you if you - there was a lot\nof interruptions to your answer to my question. If you\nhad inadequate time to say everything you wanted to say\nabout the settled state of the law before this case arose\nby - in the lower courts, that's your opponent's original\nargument.\nMS. WICHLENS: Your Honor, simply that those\ncases were mistaken. This Court had never spoken directly\non the subject of derivative evidence rule in the context\nof physical evidence. And the times have changed, Your\nHonor. The time of Elstad and some of this Court's cases,\nNew York v. Harris, that followed Miranda most\nimmediately, we all assumed, naively it turns out, that\npolice officers would at least try to comply with Miranda.\nAnd now there's this movement afoot to basically thumb\ntheir noses, if you will, at this Court's Miranda decision\nand say Miranda is just an option.\nQUESTION: May I ask you if the state courts were\nuniform in the same way the Federal courts were?\nMS. WICHLENS: The state courts were not. I've\ncited some cases in my brief, both pre-Dickerson and post-\nDickerson, where the state courts were not at all uniform.\nQUESTION: And was that on both the matter of\nsubsequent confessions and physical evidence?\nMS. WICHLENS: Correct, Your Honor, as I recall.\nIf there are no further questions from the\nCourt, I would ask this Court to hold that the derivative\nevidence rule applies to physical evidence fruit of a\nMiranda violation and to affirm the judgment of the Tenth\nCircuit Court of Appeals.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Ms. Wichlens.\nMr. Dreeben, you have three minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. DREEBEN: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nMiranda is a rule that is perfectly matched to the problem\nthat the Court sought to address, namely the risk that the\ndefendant's own self-incriminating statements would be\nobtained by compulsion and admitted against him to prove\nhis guilt. That risk implicated two central concerns of\nthe Fifth Amendment, one going to reliability, the other\ngoing to the state's burden to prove guilt with evidence\nother than that extracted from the defendant's own mouth.\nExtension of Miranda to this case, which\ninvolves physical evidence that does not involve the\nreliability concerns that are at the heart of the Fifth\nAmendment, and does not involve the concern about using\nthe defendant's own self-compelled words to incriminate\nhim, would not only be contrary to the body of authority\nin the lower courts before this Court's decision in\nDickerson and largely after it, but would also be contrary\nto the purpose of truth-seeking in a criminal trial that\nis central to the Court's jurisprudence in this area.\nJustice Stevens, I - as far as the Government is\naware, there was no more than a handful of cases in the\nstate courts that have followed the rule, other than what\nthe Federal rule had been. Justice White's dissenting\nopinion from the denial of certiorari in the Patterson\ncase, I believe, collects them, but this was by no means a\ngroundswell movement in the state courts.\nQUESTION: Well, I understand, but I noticed that\nin your brief, in your oral statement you said that they\nwere unanimous, your brief said there was a strong\nmajority in the Federal courts. I haven't checked it out\nmyself but is it - is it a unanimous view in the Federal\ncourts?\nMR. DREEBEN: My understanding is that there are\neight Federal circuits before Dickerson, including the\nTenth Circuit, that it held that suppression of derivative\nphysical evidence was not warranted. Since Dickerson,\nonly the Tenth Circuit has changed its position, and there\nis no other court, other than the First Circuit, which\nfollows a rule that depends on - on balancing deterrence\nconcerns against the loss to - of evidence to the trial,\nthat follows anything akin to the kind of derivative\nsuppression rule that the Tenth Circuit adopted in this\ncase.\nThank you.\nQUESTION: Well, wait, can I - if you have a\nminute. What if the policeman deliberately fails to give\nthe Miranda warning in order to get the physical evidence?\nMR. DREEBEN: In our view, Justice Breyer, no\ndifferent rule is warranted in that situation, because\nMiranda continues to protect against the risk that it's\naimed at. Absent actual compulsion, there is no warrant\nfor a rule that does anything other than suppress the\nactual statements.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr. Dreeben.\n"
