Callahan.\nMr. Stirba.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF PETER STIRBA,\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. STIRBA: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nAt the time of the arrest in this case there\nwere three different Federal circuits and two State\ncourts that established it was Constitutionally\npermissible for police officers to enter a home without\na warrant as a follow-up entry to effectuate arrest\nafter an illegal drug transaction when a government\nagent had occurred and probable cause had been\nestablished.\nAlthough the rule has become known as the\ndoctrine of consent once removed, and the lower courts\nhave banned various rationales in support of the rule,\nthe name or label is not important. What is important\nis that the rule is predicated upon well recognized\nFourth Amendment principles, and that at the time of the\narrest the consent doctrine was well established in the\nlower courts as settled Fourth Amendment law.\nThus, irrespective of how this Court rules\non the constitutionality of the rule itself, the\nPetitioner officers could have reasonably believed that\nwhat they were doing was lawful.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, because the\nFourth Amendment principle of consent was well\nestablished? In other words, if a police officer goes\nto the door and says \"May I come in,\" that is -- that is\nperfectly acceptable. Is that -- that the level of\ngenerality that you think we ought to analyze this issue\nat?\nMR. STIRBA: No, certainly we think that the\ngenerality of just pure consent is not the level at\nwhich it should be determined. In fact, that was the\nproblem with the Tenth Circuit case. But it has to\nbe -- the right has to be defined in a specific clear\nway, and it has to be -- the contours of the right have\nto be sufficiently clear that police officers know that\nwhen they engage in the conduct, they know what they\nthey're doing is unlawful.\nIn this case, Mr. Chief Justice, all of the\nlaw that was in existing at the time of the entry was\nsupportive of exactly what the police officers did.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, it seems to me that\nmisses the point of the case. I mean, the point of the\ncase is that consent to the police was established,\nconsent to police informants was not, and that when I\nconsent I am not consenting to the -- to the whole\nworld. If I am consenting to somebody who is not a\npolice officer, that is not equivalent to consenting to\na police officer. That's the point of the case; and as\nI understand it, there was -- there was only one case at\nthe time that this occurred which equated the\nconfidential informant for the police with the police;\nand that was the Seventh Circuit case; isn't that\ncorrect?\nMR. STIRBA: Justice Souter, we are not --\nwe are not contending this is an implied consent case,\nalthough that has been a theory that has been advanced\nin the lower courts. We believe that the way that this\nwas constitutionally lawful -- this is really a Lewis\ncase, and that is once you engage in some illegal\nconduct with a government agent in your home, you have\nwaived any expectation of privacy.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, but that -- that\nequates -- in terms of existing law, that equates the\ngovernment agent, which in this case is not a police\nofficer, but a confidential informant, with a police\nofficer. And it seems to me that is the nub of the\ncase: Is that person equivalent, so that consent to one\nin effect is consent to as many police as want to come\nin, or is it not the case? And it seems to me what you\nhave got to argue here is that the confidential\ninformant and the police officer for Fourth Amendment\npurposes should be treated as identical.\nMR. STIRBA: Absolutely. And we do -- and\nwe think --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And there is no clear law\non that. That's why we are here. There's one -- at the\ntime that this search was made, as I understand it,\nthere was only one case which held there was such an\nequivalence, is that correct?\nMR. STIRBA: There are two points,\nJustice Souter. First of all, with respect to the\nlawfulness of the confidential --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, first -- I want to\nhear what you say, but tell me, is it correct that at\nthat time there was one case that held the equivalence?\nMR. STIRBA: No, Your Honor. There actually\n-- there were actually three out of the Seventh Circuit,\nthe Pollard case out of the Sixth Circuit, which\ninvolved a police officer and a confidential informant\n--\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Which was not a circuit\ncase, right?\nMR. STIRBA: That is a circuit case.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: District case?\nMR. STIRBA: That was a circuit court case,\nU.S. v. Pollard.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So there were three circuit\ncourt holdings that the confidential informant was\nequivalent to a police officer?\nMR. STIRBA: There were three out of the\nSeventh Circuit. Paul, Diaz, and I think it's Aziano\nwere all confidential information cases where the courts\nruled squarely that there was no difference between a\nconfidential informant and a police officer.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay, did you -- now, do\nyou have other circuits that held that?\nMR. STIRBA: Yes, Your Honor. The Pollard\ncase involved a confidential informant --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Where is Pollard from?\nMR. STIRBA: Sixth Circuit.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Sixth.\nMR. STIRBA: And they cited in support the\nconfidential informant cases from the Seventh Circuit.\nWe also read Gramble -- this is a 2000 -- I'm sorry, a\n995 Ninth Circuit case which talked about a government\nagent, it did not draw a distinction between a\nconfidential informant and a police officer -- as\nsupportive as well. That's exactly what Judge Kelly\ndetermined in the dissenting opinion in the Tenth\nCircuit.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. Now why -- why are\nthey correct? Why should the confidential informant be\ntreated as equivalent to a police officer?\nMR. STIRBA: Well, fundamentally -- and of\ncourse the test for Fourth Amendments purposes is the\nSkinner test -- that once you are a government agent or\na government actor, there really is no material\ndifference in terms what the confidential informant\nwould do or the undercover police officer would do.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Oh, but there is an\nenormous difference between the training and the\ncharacter of a police officer and, as this very case\nillustrates, the confidential informants are often very\nshady characters who can't be counted on to be\ntruth-tellers, and have a powerful incentive to get\nsomeone for the police, because in most cases they are\nseeking to have their own case dealt with\nsympathetically. So, how can you equate a police\nofficer with a confidential informer, who is usually\nsomeone who knows where the drug house is because he's a\ndealer himself?\nMR. STIRBA: Two points. In our reply\nbrief, pages 6 and 7, we point out the wide variety of\nconfidential informants. They come in many different\nshapes and sizes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: How about this one?\nWasn't this one that fits my description, the one in\nthis case?\nMR. STIRBA: This one clearly had a drug\nproblem. This one also attended college. This one also\nwas a star athlete in high school, and this one also was\nreliable in a previous drug transaction. Moreover --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: He was trying -- and he was\ntrying to make a deal to get leniency with the police.\nMR. STIRBA: Well, there is no question\nabout that. But once again, he is a government actor.\nFor purposes of Fourth Amendment liability it doesn't\nmatter whether it's a police officer or a confidential\ninformant, as long as he is an agent of the government,\nwhich clearly he was. He was a government actor --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But you -- you certainly\ncannot argue -- maybe you are, but I don't see how can\nyou argue in response to Justice Ginsburg that the\nintegrity to be expected from a confidential informant,\ntaking that as a category of law including all sorts of\ninformants, is the integrity that we would expect in a\npolice officer.\nMR. STIRBA: Well, as a general proposition,\nJustice Souter, you can't make that kind of\ndetermination. We point out --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Why can't I?\nMR. STIRBA: Because sometimes confidential\ninformants are retired police officers; sometimes\nconfidential informants are police cadets. Sometimes\nconfidential informants --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Then if that -- if that is\ntrue, as it clearly is, they run the gamut from the good\nto the bad. You can't make -- adopt the proposition\ncategorically that confidential informants should be\nregarded as having the same integrity as a police\nofficer.\nMR. STIRBA: I wouldn't want to make that\nstatement. I don't know that it's material, though, to\nthe analysis under the Fourth Amendment and whether or\nnot, once you are a government agent or a government\nactor, there really is no legal significance that flows\nfrom that to draw a distinction between one who is\nactually employed by the police, taking a paycheck from\nthe police, and one who is not.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: There's one feature of\nthis is that I think is really puzzling: What this case\nis about is the Fourth Amendment, that requires, with\ncertain exceptions, the main rule is to get a warrant.\nAnd here you have a confidential informer going to the\nplace to make sure that they really do have the goods.\nThen he goes back to the police. He spends two hours.\nHe's being wired and whatever else. Why didn't somebody\npick up the phone and get a warrant at that point? The\nconfidential informer could say: \"I was there and I saw\nthe drugs.\" What -- the whole purpose of these rules is\nto have the police get a warrant when they can. And how\ndo you explain that two hours lapse between when they\nhad probable cause and when the -- when the informant\nreturns for the second time?\nMR. STIRBA: Well, Justice Ginsburg, the\nofficers testified why they didn't get a warrant,\n244-245 in the joint appendix, and 256 and 257. Two\nproblems: One, they weren't sure the drugs were going\nto be there. These are small amounts of drugs in a\nrural area; they dissipate very quickly.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: We're talking about\nprobable cause. If they got a warrant within an hour or\ntwo of the time that that informant says he saw them\nthere, do you seriously question whether there would be\nprobable cause?\nMR. STIRBA: I am only going on the record\nand what these informed officers testified to.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But we're asking for the\nbasis. You're asking for a rule and our questions go to\nthe reason for having that rule. And the officers may\nhave said -- and I will assume they said -- in this\ncase: Oh, gee, we weren't sure the drugs would still be\nthere. But in terms of probable cause law, that's just\nnot a serious answer, is it?\nMR. STIRBA: Well, it is. In essence we are\ntalking about an anticipatory warrant, and under U.S. v.\nGrubbs you not only need probable cause to believe that\nthe drugs will be there --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: They don't even need an\nanticipatory warrant. They need a warrant to go in and\nsearch that place on the grounds that there are probably\ndrugs there, and if they saw drugs there a couple of\nhours beforehand and they had no affirmative evidence\nwhich they should bring forward under the Frank standard\nto indicate that the drugs were being taken out, is\nthere any serious question that probable cause would be\nfound?\nMR. STIRBA: Justice -- Justice Souter, I\ndon't believe at the time, approximately 9 o'clock in\nthe evening, the police had probable cause to believe\nthe drugs were there.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: An informant just came out\nand said there were drugs there and they don't have\nprobable cause?\nMR. STIRBA: At the time of 9 o'clock, I\ndon't think it was established that there were drugs --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Why not?\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought it was\nestablished not only that there were drugs, but that he\nactually tasted some.\nMR. STIRBA: He never told the police that.\nAnd the purpose --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But --\nMR. STIRBA: The purpose of the operation,\nof course, was to establish that there was in fact drugs\nin the house. The transaction would occur and that\nwould conclusively establish probable cause. I don't\nthink we should fault the police for essentially being\ncareful before they entered the home to make sure that\nin fact they had probable cause.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: The reason the police are\nbeing faulted is that they didn't get a warrant. And\nthe warrant requirement is a generally good starting\nplace for a Fourth Amendment argument.\nJustice Ginsburg's point is that if they had\nan informant who had seen drugs in the place within two\nhours, they had, if they'd been before a magistrate, the\nbasis in probable cause to get a warrant. And I still\nhaven't heard why in fact they couldn't have got one or\nwhy they didn't have the probable cause.\nMR. STIRBA: Well, as I -- as I explained\nbefore, they believed the drugs in --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I'm not interested in what\nthey personally believed. We're talking about objective\nFourth Amendment standards. Did they or did they not\nhave a basis to establish probable cause at that point?\nMR. STIRBA: We don't believe they did, Your\nHonor. And we don't believe they could have gotten a --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: That is --\nMR. STIRBA: -- an anticipatory warrant.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I will admit that is the\nmost astonishing view of probable cause I have heard in\nthis courtroom. Of course they had.\nMR. STIRBA: Well, the record evidence\ndoesn't substantiate that, or they would have gotten --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Why doesn't it?\nMR. STIRBA: Or they would have gotten a\nwarrant.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Why doesn't it? As I\nunderstand, the record evidence is that their informant\nwas in that guy's home, and within two hours of the\npoint that we went through, the second entry, he had\nseen drugs. Why wasn't there probable cause within that\ntwo-hour period?\nMR. STIRBA: Because the police did not\nbelieve that at the time that they could have gotten a\nwarrant, that the drugs would not have been dissipated.\nAnd they -- as they testified --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Is that a reasonable\nbelief?\nMR. STIRBA: Pardon me?\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I mean, we're talking about\nprobable cause, not an establishment of mathematical\ncertainty.\nMR. STIRBA: Here's another point. That is\njust an option, Justice Souter, the police -- if you\nbelieved the police could get a warrant. They didn't\nhave to get a warrant. They obviously were engaged in a\nbuy/bust operation, which eventually led to them to the\nparticular position where they clearly established\nprobable cause.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: They clearly would have\nbeen if they had sent a police officer in. You're\nasking us to extend the police officer rule to include a\nconfidential informant rule. One reason for doing so\nis, or would be, that in practical terms there is a need\nfor it. Justice Ginsburg's question was, why is there a\nneed for it, when they could have gotten a warrant? And\nwe still haven't heard an answer.\nMR. STIRBA: In rural Utah -- and this is\npage 47 of the joint appendix -- the officers testified\nthat one of the reasons why they need to use\nconfidential informants is because the police are all\nknown. And, therefore, if they're going to engage in\nany drug --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Then why didn't they use\nthe confidential informant to get a warrant?\nMR. STIRBA: Well, I don't know how I can\nanswer the question any more than I have,\nJustice Souter.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: That doesn't --\nMR. STIRBA: They -- they chose not to, for\nreasons they didn't believe they had probable cause and\nthey were concerned that the drugs had been dissipated.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, in every --\ngiven the posture of the ultimate issue in this case on\nthe underlying constitutional question, you do not have\nto prove that you are right; isn't that correct? You\nhave to establish that the contrary principle is not\nclearly established?\nMR. STIRBA: That's correct. And the law at\nthe time that these officers engaged in this operation,\nentered the home -- and once again, it was based upon\nprobable cause -- supported in fact constitutionally\nwhat they did, and that it was indeed permissible. And\nthat was the basis upon which we believe, irrespective\nof how the Court views whether they should or should not\nhave gotten a warrant and the constitutional\nimplications of that, that the law was clearly not\nestablished sufficiently such that these officers were\nentitled to qualified immunity. That was one of the\nproblems with the Tenth Circuit case. They --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: May I just establish one\nthing? Tell me if I am wrong. That this argument about\nconsent once removed was not presented in the lower\ncourts. That is, in the trial court you argued exigent\ncircumstances, and then on appeal the inevitable\ndiscovery rule. So there was -- in the courts below,\nthis was not given as the reason, the consent once\nremoved was not alleged as the basis, as the\njustification for this search?\nMR. STIRBA: That's true. On the criminal\nappeal, the State did not argue Lewis, did not argue\nconsent once removed. And that is part of the problem\nwith a number of cases that have been cited by the\nRespondent. They are exigent circumstances cases where\nthe consent once removed doctrine of Lewis isn't even\nadvocated or litigated. We think that's very important.\nUnless the justices have any other\nquestions, I'll reserve the rest of my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMR. STIRBA: Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Stewart.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM L. STEWART\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,\nAS AMICUS CURIAE,\nSUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS\nMR. STEWART: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe police entry in this case was\nconstitutional and, in any event, did not infringe any\nconstitutional right that was clearly established at the\ntime the officers acted. The mandatory order of\ndecision for qualified immunity cases announced in\nSaucier v. Katz should be overruled.\nI did want to begin by clarifying the answer\nto your question, Justice Ginsburg, because I'm not sure\nif it was entirely clear. There were really two cases\nhere, one of which was the criminal prosecution of Mr.\nCallahan, the Respondent in this Court. And the\nindividual officers were not parties as to that case.\nThat was handled by the State of Utah. And you're\ncorrect that in the criminal proceeding the consent once\nremoved argument was not made. And that led to the\nmotion to suppress ultimately being granted and\nconsequently Mr. Callahan was not subject to criminal\nproceedings.\nMr. Callahan did file a civil suit against\nthe individual officers who were involved in effecting\nthe arrest, and in that civil proceeding the consent\nonce removed argument was made all the way up. It was\nmade in the district court, and it was made in the court\nof appeals as well.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Mr. Stewart, could I follow\nup on one other thing that came up during the preceding\nargument? Isn't the issue whether there was or was not\nprobable cause quite separate from the consent once\nremoved doctrine? What -- assuming that there was\nprobable cause here, there may be many instances in\nwhich the consent once removed doctrine would be\napplied, if it's a valid doctrine, where there wasn't\npreviously probable cause.\nMR. STEWART: That's correct. I think the\nconsent once removed doctrine would have its greatest\nutility in cases where the police suspect but don't have\nprobable cause to believe that a particular individual\nis engaged in criminal activity, and so they send an\ninformant or an undercover police officer in to try to\neither confirm or dispel their suspicions. They\nwouldn't be able to get a warrant at the outset because\nthey would not have probable cause at that time of\nongoing criminal conduct.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But if our question is\nshould consent once removed be recognized as a doctrine\nthat covers the confidential informant in this case, one\nquestion that we may sensibly ask is, is there a need to\nrecognize that broad a consent doctrine? And one\nquestion that would bear on that would be, in these\ncases, is there difficulty or impossibility of getting a\nwarrant under normal probable cause standards? And I\nthink that was the point of Justice Ginsburg's question.\nDo you doubt that they could have gotten a warrant\nwithin the two-hour period?\nMR. STEWART: We certainly think that they\nhad probable cause. There was testimony from police\nofficers to the effect that magistrates in Utah would be\nreluctant to grant warrants based on these circumstances\nbecause of the possibility that the drugs would be\ndissipated. I am not in a position to second-guess\ntheir empirical experience as to the circumstances under\nwhich Utah magistrates will and will not grant warrants.\nBut we think as a legal matter that there was probable\ncause, and that a warrant should have been issued. But\ncertainly there are -- there are plenty of\ncircumstances --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: That's -- it's not just\nthis case. Maybe you can tell me. I thought because\nthey were dealing with a confidential informant rather\nthan a police officer, they sent him in to do the dry\nrun. I mean the -- in the police officer cases usually\nthe -- the undercover police officer goes in. The other\npolice officers are there ready to come in when he gives\nthem the signal. But the police officers don't\nordinarily go through this dry run that they had here\nwith the confidential informer.\nMR. STEWART: Well, I -- I would think that\nwith either police officers or with informants you could\nhave some situations in which the undercover operative\nhas very recently attempted to confirm the presence of\ndrugs. And you can have other cases in which the\nundercover operative, again either an informant or a\npolice officer, could hear rumors on the street that a\nparticular individual was engaged in drug-dealing, might\nnot have probable cause, and they might decide that the\nbest way to set up the operation was to send this person\nin to attempt to make a buy at a time when probable\ncause was lacking. But they would want to arrange the\noperation in such a way that if the operative's\nexperience confirmed their suspicions and gave them\nprobable cause to arrest, they would be able to go in\nimmediately.\nAnd our principal contention is not that the\nconsent to the entry of Bartholomew was implicit consent\nto the later entry of the police officers. It was that\nonce a person has, even unknowingly, admitted a\ngovernment agent into his home, his expectation of\nprivacy is sharply reduced and the entry of the officers\nworks an insubstantial incremental invasion of privacy.\nAnd I would like to return to the point that\nMr. Stirba was making. It's true that the informant\nhere lacked the training and skills that -- and\nintegrity, for that matter, that you would expect a\npolice officer to have. But he was for Fourth Amendment\npurposes a government agent a State actor. If his\nhandlers had instructed him to look for an opportunity\nto rummage through the drawers --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Stewart, could I\ninterrupt you, because there is something that hasn't\nbeen reached. Do you think that we should answer the\nconstitutional question first or the immunity question\nfirst?\nMR. STEWART: We think that this Court in\nthis case should address the constitutional question\nfirst because it is the subject of the square circuit\nconflict, it's been briefed and argued, it's a question\nthat independently warrants resolution.\nJUSTICE BREYER: It is quite difficult. I\nmean there -- we don't know quite a lot about whether\nthey would have gotten a warrant, how -- how dangerous\nit was, whether the drugs were likely to be hidden. And\nI was thinking of it, and that's why I am saying this,\nis that it's a perfect reason since constitutional\nquestions in this area are -- are like the stars in the\nsky. There are so many. Rather than having the judges\nanswer each one and getting everything mixed up, why not\njust have them take whatever is the easier path? As a\njudge I like to take what is the easier path.\nMR. STEWART: Well --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And if it's easier to deal\nwith the qualified immunity, deal with it and forget the\nrest of it.\nMR. STEWART: I guess the first thing I\nwould say in response to that is we think that the --\nthe balance or the way in which discretion will\nordinarily be exercised will typically be different in\nthe case of the lower courts than in the case of this\nCourt, because the principal role of the lower Federal\ncourts is to decide individual cases before them usually\nin the most expeditious and noncontroversial way where\nthey --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I see that, but unless we\ndo that here, they are never going to get the right\nmessage. And so what we will have is 1,000 judges\ntrying in an average in a year 50 or 60 cases each with\nmultiple facts, and we will have approximately over a\n10-year period hundreds of thousands. I've exaggerated,\nbut there will be many, many -- many, many conflicts,\nmany, many confusions. And unless we say, no, we are\nnot doing it ourselves, how will they ever get the\nmessage?\nMR. STEWART: Well, I think they will get\nthe message --\nJUSTICE BREYER: We don't always have to do\nit, but I mean once.\nMR. STEWART: I think they will get the\nmessage if the Court tells them that the mandatory rule\nof Saucier is no longer in effect, that courts have\ndiscretion to decide based on their sound judgment\nwhether it is --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why isn't it -- why\nisn't it an advisory opinion, if we do not have to\ndecide -- to decide the ultimate question whether this\nis constitutional or not, but simply whether or not it\nwas clearly established whether it was unconstitutional?\nWhy isn't it purely an advisory opinion to say whether\nit's constitutional or not?\nMR. STEWART: I mean, in one sense it's an\nadvisory opinion, but in another sense there are --\nthere are often cases in which two alternative grounds\nfor a decision are proffered, either one of which, if\naccepted, would compel a judgment in one litigant's\nfavor. And the fact that it would theoretically -- if\nthe court concludes there is only --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, no. Those are\ndifferent grounds, it seems to me. Those are two\nindependent, as you said. Here it's kind of a -- it's a\nprogression. You first ask, either, under somebody's\nview, I guess, Saucier, whether or not it's\nconstitutional or not and then whether it's clearly\nestablished.\nI just don't know why the first question\nisn't purely advisory, because you don't have to know\nwhether it's constitutional or not.\nMR. STEWART: Well, it's true that if the\nCourt announced that this search was constitutional,\nthat it would necessarily be saying: And there was no\nclearly established constitutional law to the contrary\nat the time the officers acted. But the Court --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- to the question. I\nmean, look, if I have to answer the constitutional\nquestion -- and what bothers me is this consent at one\nremove. What? You are saying a drug seller who lets in\na disguised policeman in order to sell him a drug\nbecause he thinks he's a druggie is suddenly consenting\nto the entire LAPD coming into his house? I would think\nthat is the last thing he would have thought about\nwanting, not the first.\nMR. STEWART: But that -- that would be\nequally true in the case of the undercover police\nofficer.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, maybe they both\nshould be the same. I --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: That's what I wanted to\nknow, and it gets back to the merits and not Saucier.\nWe are going through two different things here.\nAssume this is an undercover officer, not an\n-- not a -- not an informant. Now, the undercover\nofficer sees a crime being committed, and he is ready to\nmake the arrest. Can he automatically ask for police\nassistance and -- and other policemen? Are the police\nthen entitled to come into the home in your view, or do\nthere have to be some exigent circumstances?\nMR. STEWART: No. We think he could\nautomatically ask for the police to come into the home\nbecause the incremental intrusion on privacy by having\nseveral police officers rather than one to make the\narrest would be insubstantial.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But isn't the reason it's\ninsubstantial is that we have a rule for independent\nreasons having nothing necessarily to do with this kind\nof situation in which one officer's knowledge is\nregarded as another officer's knowledge. The police are\nregarded as a group, so that we have a rule ready, in\nplace, saying: You show one, you have shown the whole\ndepartment.\nWe don't, however, have any such rule with\nrespect to agents generally.\nMR. STEWART: I think you don't have that\nprecise rule, but it is nevertheless the case that the\nundercover operative here, the informant, was a State\nactor. Had he been instructed to look in private places\nwithout consent, his conduct would have constituted a\nFourth Amendment violation because he would have been\nregarded for that purpose as -- as an agent of the\nState, and he should, therefore, be regarded as a State\nagent for these purposes.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Just -- just to be clear,\nif -- if I may, I know your red light is on: Your\nposition is if an undercover officer is in the premises\nand sees a crime being committed, he automatically can\ninvite police in to assist him in making an arrest\nwithout exigent circumstances?\nMR. STEWART: That's correct.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: What's -- what do I read?\nWhat authority do you cite me for that proposition?\nMR. STEWART: I don't think this -- this\nCourt has ever squarely so held. I believe that the\nRespondents concede that because they don't take issue\nwith the fact that consent once removed is applicable\nwhen the person already inside is an undercover police\nofficer.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Metzler?\nORAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE P. METZLER, JR.,\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. METZLER: Thank you Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nThis is a case about consent. By consenting\nto the entry of a confidential informant, that Mr.\nCallahan consented to the entry of police.\nThe answer is no, and no reasonable officer\ncould have believed otherwise.\nThis Court has long held that it is\npresumptively unreasonable for police to enter a home\nwithout consent or exigent circumstances or a warrant.\nHere there were no exigent circumstances; there was no\nwarrant, nor was there any consent.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: YOU -- was Mr.\nStewart correct that you concede that if this person\nentering the house were in fact a police officer, that\nthis would have been okay?\nMR. METZLER: No, Your Honor. We think it's\na closer case, but if it is a -- if this confidential\ninformant had been a police officer, it would be the\nsame analysis. There is no exigent circumstance here;\nthere is no consent. And -- and the consent to be\ncompetent to the police officer in your case would not\nextend to the police officer in your case would not\nextend to the --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, you would agree he\ncould make the -- the arrest by himself. Assuming he\nwas a police officer --\nMR. METZLER: Yes.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- he could make the\narrest by himself.\nMR. METZLER: -- he could make the arrest by\nhimself. But --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But -- and -- but you are\nsaying he can't ask for assistance to make that arrest\neffective in all cases. There has to be some exigent\ncircumstance.\nMR. METZLER: Correct. If -- if there are\nsome sort of exigent circumstances, in this case they\nwould plan that in advance; and police are not allowed\nto create their own exigency to get around the Fourth\nAmendment.\nJUSTICE ALITO: You are advocating a rule\nthat is going to get police officers killed, aren't they\n-- aren't you? If an undercover police officer is in a\nhouse making drug buy, and you want to say that the\nsingle officer who is there in an undercover capacity\ncan say, \"You guys are all under arrest,\" he can't\nsignal for other police officers to come in and help him\neffect the arrest without anybody being killed?\nMR. METZLER: Of course, the safest thing\nfor him would be to simply withdraw, get on the\ntelephone, and get a warrant to come back in, or during\nthe two hours that they were planning this entry he\ncould have gotten a warrant then or an anticipatory\nwarrant. There are plenty of stated options.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, it seems to me that\nin the case that Justice Alito put, that there are\nexigent circumstances.\nMR. METZLER: Well, to the extent they\nplanned it in advance, and the basis of their entry --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, that -- that's a\ndifferent point and I have some question about that. It\nseems to me the police are never quite sure exactly\nwhat's going to happen.\nMR. METZLER: Well, if they -- if they\nplanned on an exigent circumstance as being the reason\nthat they are allowed to go in, under this Court's\ndecision -- the long line of decisions in Payton and\nSteagald saying exigent circumstances or consent are the\nway to get in without a warrant, then it would not be\npermissible. If --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Imagining -- you are\nimagining different cases. We can imagine a spectrum of\ncases. In some cases the policeman or the confidential\ninformant will be there, and he really couldn't have\ngotten a -- a thing in advance -- a warrant in advance.\nIt wasn't certain, and they are in there and they see a\nlot of drug behavior going on, and the drugs are going\nto be hidden, go, disappear the second he leaves; and if\nhe tries to arrest them, everybody is going to jump on\nhim and kill him. Okay?\nSo there are a lot of cases just like this\none, but with a few changes, which are -- he needs to\ncall the police, and there will be others where he\ndoesn't.\nSo that's why I am so uncertain about what\nit is we are deciding here on the merits. We would have\nto say on the merits this is a case where there are no\nexigent circumstances. Can we say that? I -- would not\nwant to \"never are there.\"\nMR. METZLER: I think certainly in this case\nthere were not exigent circumstances. The informant was\non his way out the door. He -- he wasn't attempting to\nmake an arrest. No one thought that the -- that Mr.\nCallahan would destroy the drugs or that anyone would\nleave. In fact, the Petitioners abandoned exigent\ncircumstances in the court of appeal. So I think you\ncan decide this case on the merits, as there were no\nexigent circumstances. And then ask, is it reasonable\nto think that because there was an informant inside and\nbecause he sent out a signal that there was probable\ncause, a drug transaction had happened inside the house,\ndoes that make any difference whatsoever as to whether\nthere was consent?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's a tough -- at\nleast I find it a very difficult question. I do not\nfind it necessarily a terribly difficult question\nwhether that -- whatever the answer is -- whether it was\nclearly established, precisely because I find the\nunderlying questions difficult. So you have a handful\nCourt of Appeals decisions, you have got a factual\nvariation; the issue is whether to extend the police\ncoming in to a confidential informant, all of those\nquestions are very difficult; but precisely because they\nare, it doesn't seem that the rule, whichever rule is\nadopted, is clearly established.\nWhy don't -- and yet if I were on the lower\ncourt of appeals, you would say -- or Saucier would say,\nI have got to decide that very difficult constitutional\nquestion and then decide what's a very easy qualified\nimmunity question. Does that -- why does that make\nsense?\nMR. METZLER: With respect,\nMr. Chief Justice, I don't think it's a difficult\nquestion.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I know you\ndon't because you are arguing one side of it.\n(Laughter.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But concede for\npurposes of argument that it is a difficult question.\nWhy don't we just tell the lower courts -- we do it, we\ngo right ahead to the qualified immunity question by not\ngranting cert on one. Why shouldn't the lower courts\nhave the same luxury?\nMR. METZLER: Well, with regard to the\nSaucier question, we think the Court should keep the\nSaucier question, and particularly in this case where\nthere is a circuit split, the court should decide the\nconstitutional question and not move on to the clearly\nestablished question --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why, because we need\nto provide guidance on that question?\nMR. METZLER: Yes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, do you think\nit can't come up any other way?\nMR. METZLER: It certainly could come up --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes.\nMR. METZLER: -- in a criminal case.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Or a -- or a suit\nagainst the political subdivision, right? You could\nhave sued some other political entity other than the\nofficers individually, right?\nMR. METZLER: Certainly. Mr. Callahan did\nsue the county in this case. But --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: It seems to me that this\nis an area where the police do need guidance, and I need\nguidance. I find this -- I find this very difficult.\nIt seems to me that we could have learned a lot if the\n-- if the courts of appeals had addressed this question.\nMR. METZLER: Well, this Court in Payton and\nSteagald --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Which is what they do in\nSaucier.\nMR. METZLER: I didn't hear the Justice's\nquestions.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Which is what they would\ndo under Saucier.\nMR. METZLER: Right. Well, I mean, it's\nimportant to understand the constitutional question\nfirst in this case and in other cases in order to make\nsure that the -- that the law continues to elaborate\nthat potentially meritorious constitutional\nrights are --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but that was\nmy question. There are other ways for the law to\ndevelop. The issue can come up on merits in the suit\nagainst the municipality which doesn't raise the\nqualified immunity question. If you come up -- if you\nhave a search where a person sues to get whatever was\nseized back. You know, if there's a -- and also the\noption is, if the question of which order want to\nproceed is optional, the law can develop if the courts\nfor good and sufficient reason decide to reach the\nconstitutional question first.\nI -- I'm just wondering what benefit there\nis in an absolute rigid rule that courts of appeals -- I\nhad a few of these cases in courts of appeals; I thought\nit was very odd that I had to go and decide a difficult\nconstitutional issue and then not worry about it because\nin one sentence you say well, but the issue is not\nclearly established and so it's qualified immunity.\nMR. METZLER: Well, that would take us to\nback before Saucier, the Court -- it's a recent decision\nthat hasn't been proven to be workable. And in fact --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but my point\nthough is that at least in my experience it was\nunworkable, or at least frustrating, in that we had to\ndecide not just a factual question but a constitutional\nquestion in a context where it wasn't necessary.\nMR. METZLER: Well, it depends on your view\nof necessity. In some cases certainly, it won't really\ncome up in other contexts and the law is not established\nin section 1983; it may never be established. But here\nwe are talking about a question where there is a circuit\nsplit and the Court definitely should provide guidance\nto the lower courts. I don't think that --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Doesn't the fact\nthat there is a circuit split almost by definition mean\nthat it's not clearly established?\nMR. METZLER: Well, this Court has looked to\ncontrolling -- its own precedents and controlling\ncircuit law to decide what is -- what law is clearly\nestablished, and here, Payton and Steagald the courts\nheld that there is a bright-line rule that's very simple\nfor police officers, it's easy for them to understand.\nIf they would like to enter without a\nwarrant and they don't have exigent circumstances and\nthey don't have consent, then it is presumptively\nunconstitutional. And it's a good rule and an easy rule\nand it's also why this is not a difficult constitutional\nquestion. There are no exigent circumstances in this\ncase, and no reasonable officer could conclude that the\npresence of a confidential informant in the house means\nthere is consent to the police officer.\nJUSTICE ALITO: What if -- what if the\nofficers in this case had read the Seventh Circuit\ndecision, and they said these are judges on the United\nStates Court of Appeals, and they think this is\nconsistent with the Fourth Amendment? And what's more,\none of these is written -- one of these opinions is\nwritten by Judge Posner, and he's the smartest man in\nthe world --\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE ALITO: He knows everything there is\nto know about law and economics and jurisprudence and\nliterature and many other subjects.\n(Laughter).\nJUSTICE ALITO: Is it unreasonable for them\nto follow that?\nMR. METZLER: Well, I think the officers in\nthe Tenth Circuit need to be aware the way that our\nFederal court system works, and the Seventh Circuit\ndecision isn't binding on the Tenth Circuit. And with\nall due respect to Judge Posner, he dropped ball on this\none. He says this -- this is a the case where -- it's\nthe United States v Paul -- there are no exigent\ncircumstances; the officers there could have gotten a\nwarrant and in fact should have gotten a warrant but he\nsaid it was justified by consent. He's saying that\nconsent to one person is consent to many. And this\nCourt's cases have said that consent is based on\nordinary social expectation. When you let one person\ninto your house, you just don't let in the whole world.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If the Tenth Circuit\nsays this is not allowed, and every other circuit since\nthe Tenth Circuit's decision has held that it is, is\nthat clearly established that it's not allowed in the\nTenth Circuit?\nMR. METZLER: Yes. I think certainly an\nofficer in the Tenth Circuit would be bound to follow\nthe Tenth Circuit rule. I mean, it's not irrelevant\nthat other -- that other courts have decided it\ndifferently, but to the extent that there is controlling\nlaw in the circuit, I think that --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Then it is\nirrelevant. Then it is irrelevant that ten other\ncircuits have decided it differently.\nMR. METZLER: Well, that very well might\nwind up in this Court if --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, right, but do\nthe police officers get to decide that? Do they get to\ndecide that not only Judge Posner thinks this, but ten\nother circuits think this, and it has been five years\nsince the Tenth Circuit. I mean, do they have to go\nthrough that type of analysis?\nMR. METZLER: Well, we don't expect officers\nto survey the entire case law and come up with a law\nprofessor's view of whether this is reasonable or not.\nWe expect them to follow the clearly -- the bright lines\nthat this Court has set down and that are set down in\ntheir home jurisdictions. And if their home\njurisdiction says it's unconstitutional it's not\nreasonable for them to follow some out-of-circuit\ndecision. If, for instance, the Seventh Circuit had\nsaid that a warrantless home entry is okay so long as\nthe officer had breakfast in the last half-hour, that's\nan unreasonable rule, and it wouldn't be reasonable for\nany officer to follow that. And the facts here are\nabout as relevant to consent as to whether there was --\nthe officer had breakfast that morning.\nSo the officers here are not entitled to\nqualify -- nor can they rely on the Seventh Circuit.\nThe Petitioners have not given you any reason to adopt a\nnew exception here. They say this is based on a waiver\ntheory or that it's a private search or that it is\nincident to arrest. But all of those ignore the\nsubstantial interest in the sanctity of the home.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do any of the other\ncases involve -- the other circuit cases involve\nconfidential informants as opposed to police officers?\nMR. METZLER: Other than the Seventh\nCircuit?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes.\nMR. METZLER: The -- one case in the Sixth\nCircuit there was both a confidential informant and a\npolice officer were admitted. And then there's a later\ncase in the Sixth Circuit that did say this is okay for\nit, which came after this case.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So at the time every\ncircuit other than the -- you know, if there is a police\nofficer and a confidential informant, I think that could\nbe considered a police officer because he is going to\ncall the police in -- every court of appeals decision\ninvolving a confidential informant said it was okay.\nMR. METZLER: Actually we have cited three\ncircuits where these same facts happened. In the Eighth\nCircuit, the First Circuit and the Eleventh Circuit.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And in those\ncircuits, did the court focus on the distinction between\nthe police officer and the confidential informant?\nMR. METZLER: Well, no. The court looked to\nwhether there were exigent circumstances or consent.\nThe courts followed this Court's decision in Payton and\nBramble and that line of cases.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you believe\nthat -- what is the appropriate level of generality to\nlook at in addressing this question, a case involving a\nconfidential informant?\nMR. METZLER: I think the appropriate level\nof generality is that the facts under the court -- the\ncourt has covered the field when it comes to warrantless\nhome entries. If you have a warrant, you are okay. If\nyou have exigent circumstances, you are okay. And if\nyou have consent, you are okay. Everything else is\npresumptively unconstitutional.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why is that?\nMR. METZLER: That's a good question.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why isn't it that\nthe issue hasn't come up, this question of a\nconfidential informant is one that hasn't come up? Why\nwould we say that is presumptively unconstitutional?\nMR. METZLER: Well, the Court's language is\npresumptively unconstitutional has said that many times.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You are talking about the\nmain role of police is get a warrant, except -- and I\nthink the Court has said a number of times to make this\nsearch reasonable, the police have to get a warrant if\nyou want to interject the judicial between police and\nthe person in jeopardy. So the main rule is warrant\nunless -- and then you have exceptions, but I think your\npoint is that there is a main rule.\nMR. METZLER: Yes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: This Court has gotten\nfrom the Constitution?\nMR. METZLER: Yes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Get a warrant if you can.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Isn't your argument that in\na situation where the exigent circumstances are the\ncreation of the scenario that the police have set up,\nthe police cannot -- and you have a police officer who\nis being the undercover operative who has the power to\nmake an arrest, that police officer cannot signal for\nother officers to come in and assist with the arrest?\nMR. METZLER: Well, our position is that\nwould be -- the additional officer entry would violate\nthe Constitution --\nJUSTICE ALITO: The additional officers\nwould -- that would violate the Fourth Amendment?\nMR. METZLER: Yes.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Even if there is an officer\nsafety problem there?\nMR. METZLER: Well, to the extent that they\nhave created an officer safety problem, obviously the\nofficers are going to go in to help him, no one is going\nto get hurt. But the additional officer's entry can\nviolate the Fourth Amendment.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So the police say, you\nknow, we made a mistake. We should have had a warrant,\nbut we have our man in there now, we have got to do\nsomething. The police cannot send assistance?\nMR. METZLER: No, of course, they can send\nassistance. And they probably --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: No. You say they have\ncreated the exigent circumstances.\nMR. METZLER: Yes, they have, which is why\nthe additional officer's entry would violate the Fourth\nAmendment. Now, there might be limited --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So -- so my first\nstatement was correct. It's illegal for the police to\nsend their assistance, the other officers in?\nMR. METZLER: Yes, my answer was as a\npractical matter no -- no police officer is going to\nleave, even if --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, but then he is\ngoing to get sued.\nMR. METZLER: He very well may get sued and\nthere are questions of fact as to --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And you say as a practical\nmatter we have to say that under the Constitution we can\nendanger -- we must endanger the officer?\nMR. METZLER: Well, I disagree that the\nofficer could be in danger --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: No, no. The hypothetical\nis that they have to send people in to assist him. But\nthe hypothetical also is they should have anticipated\nthis, and therefore, in your words, they created exigent\ncircumstances.\nMR. METZLER: They did create the exigent\ncircumstance --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: It seems to me that\ndilemma and that paradox casts considerable doubt on\nyour proposition that if the police create the exigent\ncircumstances, they cannot rely on it. I seriously\nquestion that proposition.\nMR. METZLER: Even if -- even if you\ndisagree with me on that, it shouldn't make any\ndifference in this case where there was no exigent\ncircumstances.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: No, no. I want to talk\nabout the general rule.\nMR. METZLER: Okay. Well, the general --\nnever mind --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: You want us to write an\nopinion saying that any time police create the exigent\ncircumstances, they can't rely on them if they had had\nthe time to get a warrant. And I find that a dangerous\nrule.\nMR. METZLER: I don't think you would need\nto to write the opinion that would say that, because\nexigent circumstances are not in this case.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Metzler, what do you\nsay to this line of reasoning, we have in prior cases\nadopted the positions that for purposes of establishing\nprobable cause, the knowledge of one police officer is\nalso the knowledge of all police officers, at least\nwithin a department or working on a particular problem.\nSo that if in a case in which there is a search without\na warrant, if you add up everything that individual\nofficers knew and that amounts to probable cause, then\nthe search is good.\nWhy don't we apply, in effect, the same rule\nin the hypothetical case that you have been given, which\nis a police officer who was admitted by consent and\nthere are other police officers outside. At the point\nat which the police officer who has been admitted has\nthe knowledge necessary for an arrest and has that\nknowledge as a result of the invitation and the waiver\nof privacy as to him, why don't we regard that on sort\nof general doctrinal grounds as a waiver of privacy with\nrespect to the police in general, just as we regard\npolice knowledge as being imputed to all police\nofficers?\nThat way you don't have the problem that,\nfor example, Justice Kennedy's hypo raises, even in the\ncase of exigent circumstances. But it doesn't open the\ndoor to what you were objecting to here. Why isn't that\na proper solution or proper answer to this hypo?\nMR. METZLER: Well, if you are to adopt that\nsort of -- I think you certainly could adopt that\nrationale. But I don't think the way to get there is\nthrough a waiver, because real there's nothing that the\nperson -- the suspect has done that he knows about that\nwould mean that he waived the expectation that\nadditional people would come in. There might be --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, you are absolutely\nright in terms of his psychological process, the only\nperson he has invited in is the one person. The reason\nfor coming up with the answer I suggested is a broader\ndoctrinal reason. That is the reason that we have for\nprobable cause purposes regarded the police -- or the\nknowledge of one police officer as the knowledge for\nall.\nWhy don't we, for the same reasons, since it\nis privacy that is at stake in all of these cases,\nregard the invitation of one police officer as the\ninvitation of all, or to all?\nMR. METZLER: Again, I don't think that the\nway to get there is through consent. If you want it to\nbalance and say, well, the government has an agent in\nthere who is making the arrest and there is safety\nconcerns and other reasons why we would want to do that,\nthat might be one way to get there. I don't think it's\nthrough consent.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: It would be consent to one\nofficer plus a doctrinal basis to construe that consent\nfor Fourth Amendment purposes as a broader consent.\nMR. METZLER: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: That's what we would be\ndoing. We wouldn't be doing it because the individual\nin the trailer says I am inviting in the whole L.A.\npolice department. We are doing it because he invites\none L.A. police officer in, and we have doctrinal basis\nfor regarding the police, as it were, collectively\nrather than individually for probable cause purposes\nwhen privacy is at stake.\nMR. METZLER: That would be -- that would\ncertainly be a basis to allow for police officers.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Would it not open the door\nto, I guess, to what you are objecting to?\nJUSTICE ALITO: Why would probable cause\nsolve the problem at all? There is clearly probable\ncause here. They are listening to what goes on. So\nthey're -- do you dispute that when they hear that the\ndrug transaction is taking place, that they lack\nprobable cause?\nMR. METZLER: No, I think they do have\nprobable cause. But in Payton, the Court said that\npolice officers who are outside who have probable cause\nneed more than probable cause to get inside. They need\na warrant, exigent circumstances.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Right. I think I may have\ncreated this problem for you and -- and maybe I -- I\nshould get you out of it.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I'm not suggesting that the\nprobable cause rule is what is operative here. I'm\nsaying that for probable cause purposes we regard the\npolice collectively, and why, since our privacy is at\nstake there and is at stake here -- why shouldn't we\nhave a collective consent rule, too?\nMR. METZLER: You certainly could --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: That -- that's my proposal.\nMR. METZLER: You certainly could adopt that\nrule, and that would be a -- an additional reason for\npolice to enter beyond what has been thus far\nestablished by this Court.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How do you decide\nwhether the confidential informant should be considered\nan employee of the police? Let's say this is the tenth\nundercover operation he has engaged in. They give him\n$100 after every undercover operation. I mean, is he an\nemployee of the police department?\nMR. METZLER: I don't think his employment\nstatus is -- is what is at issue. The question is\nwhether he is an agent of the state for the purpose that\nhe is inside -- for the purposes of making an arrest of\nthe person inside the home.\nHere the confidential informant, all he is\nreally doing is acting as a surveillance device. He is\ntelling the officers outside what is happening inside.\nAnd he gives them probable cause.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why doesn't -- that\ndoesn't make him an agent of the police?\nMR. METZLER: No, I don't think so. He\nmight be an agent for some purposes but he is not an\nagent for purposes of making an arrest inside, which is\nwhat they want to do.\nJUSTICE ALITO: What is it there is a State\nstatute that says that confidential informants may be\ndesignated by the police department to assist in making\narrests?\nMR. METZLER: If there was some assist to\nmaking an arrest -- of the government, then assuming we\nare following Justice Souter's few exceptions, then I\nthink that they would fall into that exception. But\nhere, of course, the confidential informant is no such\nthing. This confidential informant was not active\npolitically. He wasn't making an arrest. There was\nno --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: He wasn't acting on\nhis own. He was acting for the police. He didn't\ndecide I'm going to do this and -- because you know, I\nwant to do it, and it just so happens the police are\ninvolved as well.\nMR. METZLER: Well, that's true. He was\nacting with the police but he wasn't acting for the\npolice. And nothing that the -- that the confidential\ninformant did inside, even if attributed to the police,\nwould give police the right to cross that threshold. If\nthis confidential informant were a police officer, I\nthink you would have to base it on the power of the\npolice to make the arrest inside, the power of the State\nto make that --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Even if there is such a\nthing as citizen's arrest, I think it was part of this\nrecord that -- that they do not want confidential\ninformers to go making arrests, so that the police\ndistinguish the confidential informer.\nMR. METZLER: That's correct,\nJustice Ginsburg. Both the Solicitor General and the\nPetitioners agree that confidential informants should\nnot and would not be making these arrests. So the\nfunction of the confidential informant is really as I\nsaid, just a surveillance device; and what is important\nis not what he is doing but what the police are doing\nwho are outside.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But going back to why\nshould we decide this question, particularly in Fourth\nAmendment cases when these issues will come up on\nsuppression motions, so there isn't a need to decide\nthem in the -- in the civil context.\nMR. METZLER: But I think in general we are\ntalking about a very small category of cases like this\none where their -- the criminal defendant won on the\nFourth Amendment and then the police bring up some new\nargument on a qualified immunity defense because there\nwould already be some law on the questions that were\ndecided in the -- in the criminal case.\nSo in those limited circumstances it seems\nto put too much of a thumb on the scale on the side of\npolice that says well, you can come up with a new theory\nand you don't even have to show that it applies; all you\nhave to show is that nobody has ever rejected your\ntheory and then it is not fairly established. I don't\nthink in that small number of cases that the balance\nshould really tilt that far towards police. And here,\nhere it's certainly not, where the Solicitor General and\nthe Petitioners both agree that the Court should decide\nboth questions.\nThe constitutional question here is not very\ndifficult. It boils down to, in the absence of exigent\ncircumstances, could any reasonable officer have\nbelieved that the two circumstances they would like to\nsee in previous cases -- that is, that a confidential\ninformant is inside, and that he sends a signal out that\nthere is probable cause -- do those make any difference\nwhatsoever to the calculation of whether there are\nexigent circumstances or consent? The answer is no and\nno reasonable officer could have believed otherwise. If\nthere are no further questions.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Stirba, you have three minutes\nremaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT BY PETER STIRBA,\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. STIRBA: The colloquy about the safety\nconcerns when the officer or the confidential informer\nare in the home I think highlight why the distinction\nbetween a confidential informant and the officer really\ndoesn't make much meaningful headway in terms of the\nFourth Amendment. Obviously if the police officer was\nacting under cover in this particular situation he would\nnot have announced -- there were three arrestees who\nwere actually in the premises at the time of the\nfollow-up entry. He would not have said after the drug\ntransaction occurred \"oh, by the way, I'm a police\nofficer, I'm here to arrest you,\" for obvious reasons\nconnoting safety and other issues which would have been\nattendant to them.\nSimilarly the confidential informant isn't\ngoing to do that, either, for the same particular\nproblem, even if the confidential informant had arrested\npowers under State law. The issue is the police officer\ncan call up for backup and assistance to effectuate\narrest, which is specifically what occurred here.\nSimilarly, there is no really distinction to be drawn\nbetween a confidential informant as a government actor\nallowing for the additional entry or follow-up entry of\nadditional officers for backup and assistance to make\nsure the arrest is safe and secure than if you have a\npolice officer.\nThe second point I would like to make is the\nfirst time any Federal circuit drew this distinction\nbetween a confidential informant and a police officer\nwas the Tenth Circuit decision. They adopted consent\nonce removed. They just limited it to a police officer.\nObviously the police officers involved in this case\ncould not reasonably be expected to anticipate such a\ndistinction being drawn, especially given the fact that\nthere was at least a Seventh Circuit body of law, the\nSixth Circuit body of law, and as we argue, which we\nthink is a fair reading of Gramble -- because they cite\nthe Seventh Circuit body of law that includes the\nconfidential informant -- there were at least three\ncircuits that rejected that distinction, and you in 2000\nconfirmed that in the Sixth Circuit there is no\ndistinction as a matter of this particular doctrine\nbetween a confidential informant and a police officer.\nAnd finally with respect to the exigent\ncircumstances cases, and you can look at any one that\nwas cited by the Respondent, there is no mention of\nLewis, there is no mention of consent once removed,\nthere is no mention of any abrogation of privacy. Those\nissues were not raised, just like the issues were not\nraised in the criminal appeal of Mr. Callahan's\nconviction; and so therefore they are really not\nrelevant, they are not probative, and we are not\nsuggesting this is an exigent circumstances case, nor\nare we suggest relying on for purposes of the Fourth\nAmendment issue any implied consent.\nWe have rested our -- the justification for\nthe Fourth Amendment issue on search incident and also\nthe Lewis doctrine because we think this is a Lewis\ncase. Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel,\nthe case is submitted.\n(Whereupon, at 12:06 p.m., the case in the\nabove-entitled matter was submitted.)\n12:16 22:22 23:13 3:24 19:8 22:3
