SHANMUGAM\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. SHANMUGAM: Thank you, Mr. Chief\nJustice, and may it please the Court:\nThe Armed Career Criminal Act is one of the\nFederal Government's most important tools for\nincapacitating serial offenders who commit serious\ncrimes, and, like other Federal recidivism statutes, the\nACCA defines the prior offenses that trigger its\napplication based partly upon the maximum terms of\nimprisonment for those offenses. The question presented\nin this case is whether the relevant maximum term of\nimprisonment for an offender who was already a repeat\noffender is the maximum to which repeat offenders were\nsubject to that offense.\nAlone among the circuits, the Ninth Circuit\nheld that the relevant maximum for a repeat offender is\ninstead the maximum to which first-time offenders were\nsubject, even though that purported maximum would\nsometimes be lower than the term that a repeated\noffender would actually receive. Because the ACCA\ncannot support that counterintuitive and counterfactual\napproach, the judgment of the Ninth Circuit should be\nreversed.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Shanmugam, what is the\ngovernment's position as to a person who is not a repeat\noffender? He commits the crime for the first-time. Now\nthe government says there are alternative maximums and\nyou have to pick whichever maximum is the higher. Why\nwouldn't that maximum apply to the person who commits\nthe crime the first-time?\nMR. SHANMUGAM: That is because, Justice\nScalia, we believe that the text of the ACCA naturally\naccommodates the possibility that there may be\nalternative maximum terms of imprisonment for a given\noffense. The provision the ACCA at issue, Section\n924(e)(2)(A)(ii), defines a serious drug offense as \"a\nState drug trafficking offense for which a maximum term\nof imprisonment of 10 years or more is prescribed by\nlaw,\" and we believe that that language is susceptible\nto the interpretation that the maximum for a repeat\noffender is the maximum to which repeat offenders were\nsubject and the maximum for a first-time offender is the\nmaximum to which first-time offenders were subject. And\nthat is particularly true because Congress --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You're adding something to\nthe elements of the crime and in all of our cases in\nthis field we look to the elements of the crime.\nMR. SHANMUGAM: Well, to be sure, Justice --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And as far as the elements\nare concerned, the maximum sentence for those elements\nyou say is the sentence that would be imposed upon a\nrepeat offender.\nMR. SHANMUGAM: To be sure, Justice Scalia,\nthe ACCA speaks of the maximum term of imprisonment for\nthe offense. But a higher sentence for repeat offenders\nis no less a maximum for the offense than the lower\nsentence for first-time offenders. This Court's cases\ninvolving challenges to recidivism statutes make that\nclear because they have uniformly held that a recidivism\nenhancement constitutes a stiffened penalty for an\nunderlying offense.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You seem to -- you\nseem to flinch from the natural consequences of your\nposition in not looking at the maximum for a particular\noffender. For example, you know, under some guidelines,\nif he was the ringleader his sentence can be enhanced\nbeyond what would otherwise be the maximum for a\nfirst-time offender, but you say you don't take that\ninto consideration.\nMR. SHANMUGAM: I don't that we're flinching\nfrom those consequences, Mr. Chief Justice. I think\nthat it is simply a consequence of the fact that the\nstatute does speak of the maximum term of imprisonment\nfor the offense, not for the offender. And, while we\nbelieve --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How is that\ndifferent from your position here, where it is the fact\nthat the individual is a recidivist that causes you to\nlook to a different maximum?\nMR. SHANMUGAM: It is because, Mr. Chief\nJustice, that we believe that the language of the\nstatute can be susceptible to the interpretation that\nthere can be alternative maximum terms of imprisonment\nfor broad categories of offenders, such as recidivists\nand non-recidivists. But we don't think that it can --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So that's the reason\nyou sort of pull back from a more aggressive reading,\nbecause it's not as broad a category?\nMR. SHANMUGAM: Well, it would lead to harsh\nresults for first-time offenders and we certainly think\nthat Congress --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but only if\nthey're subject -- only if they have some characteristic\nthat had caused the State legislature to give the higher\nmaximum, such as being the ringleader or some other\nenhancement.\nMR. SHANMUGAM: Well, that's correct. But\nwith regard to the text of the statute, we simply\nbelieve that the text of the statute cannot be stretched\nto accommodate the possibility of individualized maximum\nterms of imprisonment for every offender based on the\npotentially infinite combinations of facts that may\ndetermine an offender's guidelines range. And I think\nit's important to --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Are there any statutes\nwhich talk about offender as opposed to \"offense\" in\nthis area, do you know?\nMR. SHANMUGAM: Well, I think probably the\nclosest analog in the criminal code, Justice Kennedy,\nwould be the statute that was at issue in RLC. I\nbelieve it's 18 U.S.C. 5037(c)(1)(b), which provided at\nthe time that the court was construing it that the\nmaximum -- that the sentence that a juvenile should\nreceive should be no higher than the maximum that an\nadult offender should receive. And the court did\nconstrue that statute to refer to the maximum that an\nadult could receive under the guidelines.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, there was also the\nstatute involved in the LaBonte case, where -- where the\nstatute said the Sentencing Commission \"shall assure\nthat the sentencing guidelines specify a sentence to a\nterm of imprisonment at or near the maximum term\nauthorized for categories of defendants who have certain\ntypes of prior convictions.\"\nMR. SHANMUGAM: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And that did focus on the\n-- on the nature of the defendant and not on the element\nof the crime.\nMR. SHANMUGAM: It focused on categories of\noffenders and there Congress's concern was obviously\nwith career offenders. But I think critically in the\nLaBonte opinion itself, written by Justice Thomas for\nthe Court, the Court recognized the possibility that a\nstatute could establish alternative maximum terms of\nimprisonment for recidivist and nonrecidivist offenders.\nThe Court specifically discussed the Controlled\nSubstances Act, which does exactly that. Now, to be\nsure the language of that statute was somewhat\ndifferent, but in our view the critical lesson of\nLaBonte is simply that it is possible for a statute to\nestablish alternative maximums and the statute at issue\nhere no less than the statute at issue in LaBonte\naccommodates that possibility.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So it would be easy, of\ncourse, if recidivism were an element of the crime --\nMR. SHANMUGAM: Well, it would be easier to\naccept that if a State --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- for a crime which\nincludes the act plus the recidivism?\nMR. SHANMUGAM: If a State, Justice Scalia\nwere to essentially define a new crime of drug\ntrafficking by a recidivist, then to be sure by\ndefinition the maximum sentence for that offense would\nbe the maximum to which repeat offenders were subject.\nBut to say one more thing in response to the Chief\nJustice's question about guidelines maximums, I do think\nthat it is critical to remember that Congress enacted\nthe ACCA in its present form in 1986, well before this\nCourt's Apprendi jurisprudence took root, and at that\ntime Congress surely would have conceived of the\nrelevant maximum as the offense-specific statutory\nmaximum, and we know that Congress viewed that maximum\nas a discrete creature from the relevant guidelines\nmaximum because in passing the Sentencing Reform Act 2\nyears earlier, the statute that gave rise to the Federal\nguidelines, Congress smoke specifically about statutory\nmaximums as distinct from guidelines maximums. And\ncertainly we believe --\nJUSTICE ALITO: In light of Apprendi and the\nlater cases, do you think it's feasible any longer to\ndraw a distinction between, between statutes that make\nrecidivism an element of the offense and statutes that\noriginally conceived of recidivism as a sentencing\nfactor but now provide for that to be proven to a jury?\nMR. SHANMUGAM: One of the virtues of our\napproach, Justice Alito, is that the answer is in some\nsense the same whether a legislature defines drug\ntrafficking by a recidivist as a distinct offense or\nwhether recidivism is simply a sentencing factor that\ngives rise to an alternative maximum term of\nimprisonment for the underlying offense of drug\ntrafficking. And our fundamental submission with regard\nto the Court's Apprendi line of cases is simply that it\nalters nothing with regard to how the ACCA should be\ninterpreted because, again, Congress was defining\n\"offense\" in 1986 in its colloquial sense as essentially\nwhat the legislature defines the offense to be. And to\nbe sure, it is a prerequisite for a fact to be an\noffense element that it be submitted to the jury, but\nall this court did in Apprendi line of cases was\neffectively to state a procedural constitutional rule\nunder which a sentencing factor that raises the\napplicable maximum sentence has to be submitted to the\njury.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Shanmugam, I didn't\nunderstand what you said about Congress's intent with\nregard to the guidelines when it passed ACCA. You're\nsaying Congress did not have an eye to the guidelines,\nbut simply had an eye to the maximum sentence within\nwhich the guidelines were applicable?\nMR. SHANMUGAM: Yes, that's correct. In the\nFederal system, that would of course be the statutory\nmaximum. In some State systems, of course, the\nguidelines are themselves statutory and for that reason\nwe refer to them in our brief as offense-specific\nmaximums. But the critical point with regard to the\nSentencing Reform Act is that Congress did believe that\nthere was such a thing as the maximum for the offense,\nand indeed in Section 994(r) of Title 28, one of the\nprovisions of the Sentencing Reform Act, Congress\nactually asked the Sentencing Commission to come back\nwith recommendations to alter those offense-specific\nmaximums, which we believe is certainly evidence that\nCongress viewed that as something distinct.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Does it matter what was\nthe sentence actually imposed in the State court? That\nis, suppose it is a second offense, but the prosecutor\nchooses not to charge as a second offender and so,\nalthough it is in fact the second offense, he is\nsentenced in the State court as a first offender. Would\nit count under your reading of the Federal statute that\nit was a second offense?\nMR. SHANMUGAM: Our position, Justice\nGinsburg, is that it would count because the relevant\ninquiry is whether the offender was potentially eligible\nfor an enhanced maximum sentence as a repeat offender as\na substantive matter. That having been said, we\ncertainly believe that in the mine run of cases a court\napplying the ACCA will merely need to resort to the\njudgments of conviction or other judicial records in\norder to determine the maximum to which the defendant\nwas actually subject. And this case of course presents\na perfect example of that because the judgments for each\nof Respondent's prior convictions made clear that he was\nin fact subject to a 10-year maximum sentence as a\nrepeat offender.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I take it -- supposing\nthere's a dispute between the prosecutor and the\ndefendant as to whether in fact he was a recidivist or\nnot. Is the fact that there was just an argument that\nhe would be a recidivist enough or does the record have\nto establish that he was a recidivist?\nMR. SHANMUGAM: Well, if there were such a\ndispute, certainly we believe, first of all, that ACCA\ncourts would be perfectly competent to resolve those\ndisputes. They are no different in kind from the sorts\nof legal and factual issues --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Shouldn't the mere\nexistence of a dispute be enough, because then at least\nhe's potentially subject to being treated as a\nrecidivist.\nMR. SHANMUGAM: Well, our view, Justice\nStevens, is that once the government comes forward, for\nexample, with a judgment of conviction that indicates\nthat the defendant was subject to a 10-year maximum, it\nwould then be incumbent on the defendant to come forward\nwith evidence suggesting that that was erroneous to the\nextent that a defendant would be permitted to\ncollaterally challenge that prior sentence at all. But\nwe do believe that courts can resolve those disputes.\nNow, if the Court were to disagree and to\nconclude that, for comparable reasons to the reasons\nthat the Court articulated in Shepard, it would be\ndifficult for courts to resolve those determinations,\nthen I suppose that we could live with a rule that said\nthat the government is limited to judicial records like\na judgment of conviction. But Taylor and Shepard of\ncourse were dealing with a quite different concern, the\nconcern of how to define the prior offense, and I would\nsubmit that the factual disputes that the Court was\nconcerned about in Shepard are quite different from\ndisputes about the applicability of a recidivism\nenhancement. Those were disputes about the actual\nunderlying facts of the underlying substantive offense\nitself. And the Court suggested in the plurality\nportion of Justice Souter's opinion that resolving those\nsorts of factual disputes might raise constitutional\nconcerns.\nBut we certainly believe that by virtue of\nthe rule of Almendarez-Torres, at a minimum the\nresolution of factual disputes ancillary to the fact of\na prior conviction fall within the scope of the\nAlmendarez-Torres rule and present no constitutional\ndifficulties.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Shanmugam, I take it\nthat your response to Justice Ginsburg's question would\nbasically be your response to the argument that the\nother side makes, that on your theory a State\nmisdemeanor can be treated for purposes of the act as --\nor a conviction for a State misdemeanor can, with the\nrecidivism enhancement, be treated as a felony?\nMR. SHANMUGAM: Yes. That issue would\narise, of course, only under the definition of \"violent\nfelony,\" which sets a one-year trigger rather than the\nten-year trigger that is contained in the definition of\n\"serious drug offense.\"\nI think that the only point that I would\nnote is that, with regard to an offense that remains a\nmisdemeanor, even when it is committed by a repeat\noffender, there is a distinct statutory provision which\nwe cite in our reply brief, 18 U.S.C. 921(a)(20), which\ntinkers with the definition of what constitutes a\nqualifying offense for purposes of the definition of\n\"violent felony.\" It says that if it's a misdemeanor,\nthe sentence, the applicable sentence, actually has to\nbe two years or more. But where a State actually says\nthat when you commit an offense and it becomes a felony\nwhen you are a recidivist, then certainly we think that\nthere is no problem with treating such an offense as an\nACCA predicate for purposes of the triggering maximum\nterm of imprisonment.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But if they continue to use\njust the State terminology such that they continue to\nuse the word \"misdemeanor\" with respect to an offense,\nwhich with the enhancement carries more than a one-year\npenalty, then the two-year provision, the two-year\nthreshold provision, kicks in?\nMR. SHANMUGAM: That's absolutely correct,\nJustice Souter, and I believe that that was actually the\nfact pattern that was presented in the ACCA case that\nthis Court heard earlier this term, Logan.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yes.\nMR. SHANMUGAM: And in a footnote in its\nopinion, the Court noted this very peculiarity of how\nACCA operates and how you need to have a two-year\nmaximum rather than a one-year maximum if the State\nstill treats the offense as a misdemeanor.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Do all States treat first\nconvictions from other States -- do they all count for\nrecidivism qualification if the prior offense was\ncommitted and the conviction was in another State?\nMR. SHANMUGAM: States do have somewhat\ndifferent rules, Justice Ginsburg, as Respondent\ncorrectly points out, though I would note that many of\nthe sort of factual and legal issues that would arise\nunder those different rules arise outside the\ndrug-trafficking context. Most States' drug-trafficking\nrecidivism provisions, as least those States that have\nadopted the Uniform Controlled Substances Act provision,\noperate in a quite straightforward manner because they\nessentially sweep in all prior drug offenses.\nThat having been said, we are unaware of any\nACCA cases that have presented those sorts of\ndifficulties. And typically what one would find, if one\nlooked at Respondent's cases, is that most States by now\nhave fairly clearly defined rules for determining when\nan out-of-State conviction qualifies. And so at most,\nif it were unclear from the judgment of the prior\nconviction whether the prior sentencing court had\ndetermined whether the defendant was subject to the\nenhanced maximum as a recidivist, it would be a\nrelatively easy task for a Federal ACCA court to apply\nthose largely settled rules in order to make that\ndetermination.\nI do want to say one more thing about the\ntext of the ACCA more generally, and that is that if the\nCourt, as Justice Scalia had suggested at the outset,\nwere to conclude that the statute is susceptible to the\ninterpretation that there can be only a single maximum\nterm of imprisonment for a given offense, we believe\nthat it would not necessarily follow that Respondent's\ninterpretation is correct, and indeed that the more\nnatural consequence of that interpretation would be that\nthe relevant maximum is the maximum that any offender\ncould receive, rather than the maximum that a first-time\noffender could receive, and that is because --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Surely not,\nMr. Shanmugam. You were talking about broad categories\nearlier. It seemed that the broad category in the\nsituation you posit would be the normal offender rather\nthan the recidivist, and that's the one we ought to look\nat.\nMR. SHANMUGAM: Well, that might be true as\na numerical matter, though, you know, I suspect that\nthere are probably more recidivist offenders than one\nmight think. But I think that the fundamental\ndifficulty with Respondent's interpretation is the\nanomaly that I identified at the outset, namely that\neven an offender who actually received a term of\nimprisonment of 10 years could be said to have a maximum\nof 5 years. And while it is true that --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I know, but\nyou began your discussion by saying we had to choose one\nmaximum. You were accepting that requirement. It seems\nto me, if that's the case, it's clear that we ought to\npick the maximum for the particular offense without\nconsidering additional enhancements.\nMR. SHANMUGAM: Well, with respect,\nMr. Chief Justice, I would disagree. I would submit\nthat if the Court has to choose a single maximum it has\nto be the maximum that the worst offender could receive.\nAs a matter of common sense, when one thinks about the\nmaximum --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But you don't accept\nthat approach when we're talking about enhancements\nunder State guidelines. You know, if the normal\nsentence is whatever it is, 10 years, and you get an\nextra 2 years if you're the ringleader, you say no, you\ndon't look at that; you just look at the 10 years.\nMR. SHANMUGAM: That's correct, and that's\nbecause of the statute's reference to the offense and\nnot the offender. But my submission is simply that if\nthe Court thinks that the statute is susceptible to the\ninterpretation that there has to be one maximum and\nindeed if the Court thinks that that interpretation is\ncompelled, then we would submit that all offenders who\ncommit an offense for which some offenders could receive\na 10-year sentence would be subject to the ACCA. But we\nof course primarily submit that the statute is not only\nsusceptible to the interpretation that we advance here,\nbut that it is the better interpretation, namely that a\nstatute can have alternative maximums. And we certainly\nbelieve that that interpretation is consistent with the\nlong history and widespread practice of imposing\nenhanced penalties on repeat offenders, a practice that\nCongress surely was aware of when it enacted this\nstatute dealing with the problem of recidivism.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Shanmugam, would you\nexplain to me again why -- why you treat the enhancement\nin a State guideline system differently?\nMR. SHANMUGAM: It is --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It seems to me that if you\nget an enhancement as a ringleader it's the same thing\nas if you get an enhancement because you're a\nrecidivist. What's the difference?\nMR. SHANMUGAM: The difference, Justice\nScalia, is that the statute does speak of maximum terms\nof imprisonment for the offense and not the offender,\nand, while we certainly believe that the language of the\nstatute with its reference to \"a maximum term of\nimprisonment\" can naturally accommodate the possibility\nof alternative maximums for broad tiers of offenders\nsuch as recidivists and nonrecidivists, we really don't\nbelieve that it can accommodate the possibility of\nindividualized maximums for every offender.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You don't think\n\"ringleader\" is a broad tier.\nMR. SHANMUGAM: Well, in a sentencing\nguidelines system where being a ringleader may be the\nbasis for an enhancement, as it is in the Federal\nsystem, the fact remains that an enhancement under a\nguidelines system is merely one of many factors that\nultimately determine the offender's guideline sentence.\nA guideline sentence is, of course, an individualized\ndetermination made after a court evaluates a panoply of\noffender- and offense-specific factors.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: How would you treat an\nenhancement --\nMR. SHANMUGAM: Well, we believe that such\nan enhancement could be subject to our alternative\nmaximums approach as well, to the extent that the\nstandard was --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: So it's not just\nrecidivist and non-recidivist. It's some enhancements,\nbut not all enhancements?\nMR. SHANMUGAM: Well, if a statute is as a\nformal matter structured in such a way as to create\nbroad tiers of punishment for categories of offenders,\nthen certainly that would seem to be an alternative\nmaximum term of imprisonment. The guideline systems, of\ncourse, are not structured in that way.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: You're depending upon the\nguidelines.\nMR. SHANMUGAM: Right. Well, that's\ncorrect, and so in Apprendi, of course, I think it was\nthe fact that the defendant had acted with a biased\npurpose, and that form of structuring of statutes was\nnot unheard of prior to this Court's decision in\nApprendi. And essentially what New Jersey did, as I\nrecall, in Apprendi was to say that if you unlawfully\npossess a firearm your maximum is 10 years.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, I understand, but my\npoint is I don't think your proposal just has two\ncategories. There -- it seems there could be multiple\nkinds of enhancements that would fit your general\ndescription.\nMR. SHANMUGAM: And the relevant question,\nJustice Stevens --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: It's not just recidivist\nversus nonrecidivist.\nMR. SHANMUGAM: This case does not present\nthat issue; and, in light of the history and practice of\nimposing heightened penalties on recidivists, an\nessentially universal practice as far as we're aware in\nthe drug-trafficking context, we certainly don't believe\nthat the Court has to address that issue.\nAnd, in any event, after this Court's\ndecision in Apprendi, it is certainly true that States\nhave made modifications to the structure of their\noffenses and their sentencing systems such that, with\nregard to factors other than recidivism, it may very\nwell be that as a prospective matter that issue would\nnot arise very frequently. And --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, some of them have\nsimply said, we're going to let the jury decide. We're\ngoing to let the jury make these determinations that\nApprendi says have to be made by the jury. But they're\nstill -- they're still referred to as sentencing\nfactors.\nMR. SHANMUGAM: That's correct, Justice\nScalia. And, with regard to a State that does that as\nWashington, indeed, has done in the wake of this Court's\ndecision in Blakely, we believe that the relevant\noffense and the relevant maximum term of imprisonment\nactually remains the same.\nAnd that is simply because where all a State\ndoes is to say that sentencing factors must be submitted\nto the jury in order to comply with the constitutional\nrule of Apprendi and Blakely, the fact remains that the\nState has not redefined the offense. In our view, a\nsentencing factor can remain a sentencing factor even if\nit is the functional equivalent of an offense element\nfor Apprendi purposes.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: It seems to me your\nargument might be slightly better if the statutory term\nwas \"authorized,\" not \"prescribed.\" I don't say\n\"prescribed\" could never be used in the sense you mean,\nbut when you have alternates we usually would use the\nword -- alternate possibilities -- usually you'd use the\nword \"authorize\" rather than \"prescribe.\" \"Prescribe\"\nindicates one rule.\nMR. SHANMUGAM: I suppose that may be true,\nJustice Kennedy, though again the statute spoke about\nthe maximum term of imprisonment for the offense, which\nI think presupposes, at least to some extent, that the\nmaximum may be higher than the maximum to which a\nparticular offender is subject.\nI think the only thing I would say with\nregard to the reference to \"prescribed by law\" in the\nACCA is that one could naturally understand that phrase\nbeing used by a Congress that was acting in 1986 as\nreferring to the prescribed statutory maximum.\nAnd, notably, the Ninth Circuit in a case\nthat we cite in our opening brief, United States v.\nParry, construed that phrase in exactly that manner in\nactually holding that, notwithstanding its rule in this\ncase, the applicable maximum for a defendant sentenced\nunder a mandatory guidelines system cannot be the\napplicable guidelines maximum; It has to be the maximum\nfor the offense. We believe that the Ninth Circuit\nerred only insofar as it thought that that maximum is\nthe maximum to which first-time offenders were subject,\neven for a repeat offender.\nMr. Chief Justice, I'd like to reserve the\nbalance of my time.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: May I ask you one question\nbefore you sit down? You mentioned a moment ago what\nyou saw as the anomaly in the counter-argument, the\nanomaly being that someone with the recidivism\nenhancement could end up with a ten-year sentence when\nthe maximum for the offense is five years. But isn't --\nisn't the answer to that just as -- as the answer that\nyou gave to Justice Scalia a moment ago, and that is\nsimply that the statute speaks in terms of \"offense\" so\nthat there is -- there is no anomaly in getting a\nten-year sentence for something which for this purpose\ncarries a maximum of five?\nMR. SHANMUGAM: Justice Souter, an enhanced\npenalty for repeat offenders is every bit as much a\npenalty for the offense as the lower penalty for\nfirst-time offenders.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that's the question\nin the case.\nMR. SHANMUGAM: Well, and that is a question\nthat this Court has answered in a variety of different\ncontexts dating back almost a hundred years to Graham v.\nWest Virginia. And we would submit that that principle\nis certainly equally applicable here, and a penalty for\na recidivist, while in some sense holding a recidivist\nmore responsible by virtue of his or her recidivist\nstatus, is every bit as much a penalty for the offense.\nAnd under our alternative maximums approach that can be\nthe maximum for the underlying offense.\nI'd like to reserve the balance of my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Rothfeld.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES A. ROTHFELD\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. ROTHFELD: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nThere are a number of serious problems with\nthe government's theory in this case, and I'll start\nwith this one. It is inconsistent with the statutory\nlanguage of ACCA, as is suggested by the R.L.C. and\nLaBonte decisions that have been discussed already; and\nit cannot be reconciled with the fundamental purpose of\nACCA, which is reflected in that statutory language.\nCongress enacted ACCA to target particular\ncategories of serious offenses. Whether the defendant\nis a repeat offender says nothing at all about the\nseriousness of the offense that he committed and\ntherefore tells us nothing about whether that offense\nshould be treated as an ACCA --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Suppose the State has two\nstatutes: Possession of drugs, maximum penalty five\nyears; possession of drugs by a convicted felon, maximum\n-- convicted drug felon, maximum penalty ten years. And\na defendant is convicted under the latter provision.\nWhat would be the maximum penalty for ACCA purposes?\nMR. ROTHFELD: Well, if that latter\nprovision includes as an element of the offense that\nrecidivism, that could be a different situation than we\nhave here, because the statutory language of ACCA, as\nMr. Shanmugam said, focuses on \"offense.\" Congress said\nthat an ACCA predicate in the drug context is an offense\nfor which a maximum penalty of ten years or more is --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, it could be or it\nwould be?\nMR. ROTHFELD: I think that's a difficult\nquestion, Your Honor, which is not the question here. I\nsuppose I would say the language would suggest that it\nwould be; that if it is an element to the offense the\ndefendant has been convicted of an offense that includes\nrecidivism as an element, that statutory language would\nlead us in that direction.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, if the maximum penalty\nthere would be ten years, then what if in this case the\nrecidivist element had been submitted to a jury and\nfound by a jury. Would it matter?\nMR. ROTHFELD: I would suggest, again, it\ndepends upon what the element defined by the State\nlegislature is in creating the offense, because that\nfollows from the ACCA term of the offense, the\npunishment prescribed by law for the offense. That is,\nof course, not the question here. And it's --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Why should the label matter?\nMaybe as to statutes that were passed before Apprendi\nand Booker, that at that time it made a difference.\nBut, going forward, what difference does it make whether\nit's labelled as an element of the offense or a\nsentencing enhancement that's proven to a jury?\nMR. ROTHFELD: Well, I think in the\npost-Blakely context one could say something that has to\nbe proven to a jury is in fact an element of the\noffense. The offence may essentially be defined in\nterms of the sentencing guidelines elements at that\npoint.\nBut I think in figuring what Congress had in\nmind when it used the term defining \"ACCA serious drug\noffense\" as \"an offense for which a maximum penalty of\nten years is prescribed by law, we have to figure out\nwhat is the offense and what is the penalty prescribed\nby law for that.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, going back to what\nyou first said, suppose with your own children: I told\nyou half an hour ago not to interrupt your sister when\nshe is doing her homework. This is the second time\nyou've done it. Wouldn't you, with your own child -- I\nwould with mine -- think that the second time he did it\nwas worse behavior than the first time? I just told him\nnot to.\nMR. ROTHFELD: It is a familiar example,\nYour Honor.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. ROTHFELD: And -- and it's absolutely\nright.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, if it's absolutely\nright I don't see why we hold Congress to some kind of\nweird -- not weird, but more picky standard than we do\nwith our own children.\nMR. ROTHFELD: But the reason for that, Your\nHonor, in this context is the language that Congress\nchose. It is certainly correct that, generally\nspeaking, it is thought that repeat offenders should be\nsubject to a higher punishment, and that there is a --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Because their behavior is\nworse.\nMR. ROTHFELD: Well, but I think there is a\ndistinction between whether the offense itself is a more\nserious offense. I mean, the ACCA statutory language\nuses the term \"serious drug offense.\" That's part of\nthe definition That's used in the statutory text.\nCongress had in mind punishing through the\nACCA process offenses that have a certain level of\nseriousness. And when Congress did that it was\nreflecting on what people actually did. That's the\nwhole context of this Court's --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's not a more serious\noffense when she does it the second time; it's just a\nmore culpable offender.\nMR. ROTHFELD: That is precisely right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: That isn't what I tell my\nchild. I say you behaved worse.\nMR. ROTHFELD: Well, I can't disagree with\nthat, Your Honor. But this is -- this is --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, does the word\n\"offense\" -- I haven't come across it, but does the word\n\"offense\" have some kind of special technical meaning\nthat doesn't just mean the behavior which calls into\nplay all kinds of circumstances?\nMR. ROTHFELD: Well, I think the Court has\n-- has repeatedly recognized the distinction suggested\nby Justice Scalia's latest question, which is that there\nis a difference between the offense and the offender.\nAs Mr. Shanmugam said -- and we agree\ncompletely -- ACCA is an offense-specific provision. It\ndoes not focus on the offender. The government would\nlike to read ACCA as though it made a distinction based\nupon different categories of defendants. And it's\ninteresting that the way in which the question is\npresented in their brief and in their question presented\nin the petition for certiorari is not in terms of the\nACCA statutory language. It does not ask: What is the\npenalty prescribed by law for this offense? It asks:\nCould repeat offenders be subjected to an enhanced\npenalty of ten years?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Isn't it pertinent,\nMr. Rothfeld, that in trying to decide whether a maximum\nterm of imprisonment encompasses recidivists, we're\ndealing with a statute that itself is directed to\nrecidivism. You're asking -- you've got three previous\nconvictions and then you get a particularly harsh\nsentence. If recidivism is what you're trying to\naddress, it would seem to me in deciding what a maximum\nterm is that it would be natural to assume that they\nwould take recidivism into consideration in that context\nas well.\nMR. ROTHFELD: Well, I think not, Your\nHonor, because ACCA is a particular kind of recidivism\nstatute. There are recidivism statutes common in the\nStates now, with the three strikes regime becoming\nubiquitous, in which all that matters is basically the\nnumber of offenses that were committed. The States\nexpressly disavow the seriousness of the offenses that\nconstitute the predicates in those kind of regime.\nACCA is different kind of statute. ACCA was\nmotivated because Congress was concerned that there was\na small cohort of offenders who are engaging repeatedly\nin serious offenses, and Congress had in mind that\npeople who engaged repeatedly in these especially\nthreatening, dangerous, harmful offenses, very\ndestructive to society, they should be segregated for 15\nyears through the ACCA mandatory minimum.\nBut Congress was quite clear, and the\nstatutory language reflects this expressly, that the\npredictates have to themselves be serious offenses.\nCongress was concerned with what people did.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but it just\nseems to me that if you have Congress addressing what\nthey regarded as a very serious problem of recidivism,\nthey would think that that's a problem that should be\ntaken into account in determining what maximum sentences\nyou're subject to under State law.\nMR. ROTHFELD: Well, they could have done\nthat. They could -- and that would have been the\nstatute the government is discussing, one which ties\nrecidivism into the particular category of the offender\nand the penalties to which they are subject.\nBut Congress did not do that. Congress\nfocused specifically on the seriousness of each of the\nindividual predicate offenses. And it had in mind what\npeople actually did, whether the kinds of offenses they\nwere committing were serious destructive types of\noffenses.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But it did use the\nlanguage \"a maximum term,\" not \"the maximum term,\" which\nwould support the government's view that the statute\ncontemplates more than one maximum.\nMR. ROTHFELD: With respect, Your Honor, I\nwould suggest that's one of the government's odder\narguments. I think that reading any significance to the\nuse of \"the\" rather than \"the\" in this context is quite\npeculiar. I would think if a judge, for example, is\npronouncing sentencing he or she is likely to say \"I\nsentence you to a term of 10 years,\" not \"I sentence you\nto the term of 10 years.\"\nCertainly the use of \"I sentence you to a\nterm of 10 years\" doesn't suggest some contemplation of\nmultiple alternative regimes of punishment. So I think\nthe government, I give them kudos for creativity there,\nbut I think it's very difficult to read any conscious\nchoice by Congress in the use of the different article.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, you --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What about the\ndefendant's own understanding? In connection with one\nof these offenses the defendant acknowledged in court,\nthe crime with which I am charged carries a maximum\nsentence of 10 years.\nMR. ROTHFELD: I think that there are two\nthings to say about that, Your Honor. First of all, I\nquestion how seriously anyone took that statement in the\nsentencing declaration, because what really mattered in\nWashington State was the binding determinant sentencing\nguideline, which set a maximum term of 57 months, which\neveryone agrees was the highest penalty this defendant\ncould receive. In fact, it's quite clear that, absent\naggravating circumstances, which are not present in this\ncase, no one convicted of this defendant's crime could\nreceive a punishment, recidivist or not, of 10 years,\nenough to trigger the ACCA predicate.\nSo, I question again whether or not anyone\ntook that terribly seriously. But I think even if one\ndid, it doesn't answer the question here. There is no\nquestion that there was a recidivism provision which, at\nleast in some theoretical sense, made the maximum\npenalty 10 years. There is also a statutory provision\nwhich defined the crime. And in that -- in that\nstatutory provision the Washington legislature\nspecifically associated with conviction of that offense\na five-year maximum penalty. And I think it sort of --\nit sort of begs the question to say, as the government\ndoes, well, the fact that there is some possibility out\nthere of an enhancement that increases the penalty above\n10 years, even if that were true, which is not, again\nbecause of the sentencing guidelines in this case, that\nsort of begs the question of what is the relevant\noffense? Is the relevant offense what you might call\nthe generic categorical offense of distribution of\nSchedule 3, 4, or 5 drugs, the sentence to which anyone\nconvicted of that crime, anyone who engaged in the\nelements of that offense and is found guilty in\nWashington State could have been sentenced to, and that\nis 5 years.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The government is correct,\nthough, that when a recidivist is sentenced he is being\npunished for the crime, not for his recidivism. So\nyou -- you can say that the punishment for that defined\ncrime is 10 years when, when the person who committed\nthe act is a recidivist, but the act he's being punished\nfor is the same crime.\nMR. ROTHFELD: Well, there is no doubt about\nthat. The defendant here committed this offense and he\nis being punished for it, for that offense. But again,\nI think that begs the question here: When Congress uses\nthe term \"the punishment prescribed by law for the\noffense,\" what did it have in mind? Did it mean sort of\nthe generic sense of the offense in the sense of the\noffense that anyone commits who is guilty or who commits\nthe elements of the offense, which is someone who is not\na recidivist. It's entirely -- recidivism is unrelated\nto that because recidivism is not an element of this\noffense.\nSo yes, the defendant here committed the\noffense. He's being punished for having committed this\noffense. But that doesn't answer the question of what\nCongress had in mind.\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's the part I'm not\ngetting. I mean, that's why it doesn't help your\nclient. In general, if you did read the word \"offense\"\nas applying just to the act of selling drugs, let's say,\nthen you go on and it says, for which a maximum term of\n10 years or more is prescribed, you'd say, well what is\nthe maximum term prescribed for the offense of selling\ndrugs? And the answer would be 10 years. Now, how do\nyou get out of that?\nMR. ROTHFELD: Well --\nJUSTICE BREYER: You're saying because --\nbecause fewer people are likely to get the 10-year\nsentence than get the five-year sentence?\nMR. ROTHFELD: No, no, absolutely not, Your\nHonor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What is -- what is the\ndistinguishing -- how do you get out of it? I know\nyou're trying to say this and I'm just not getting it.\nMR. ROTHFELD: I look at it from the\nperspective that I think Congress looked at it when it\nwrote the statutory language here. Congress had in\nmind -- as I said to Chief Justice Roberts, Congress had\nin mind people who engage in serious offenses. Congress\nhad in mind what people actually did. It was not\npassing a generic -- I think it's quite clear from the\nstatutory language, it was not passing a generic three\nstrikes statute. It was focusing on the seriousness of\nwhat people did and what people actually did, what they\nwere actually convicted of doing.\nAnd I think for that purpose, again the sort\nof what you might call the generic or categorical\noffense, the offense unrelated to recidivism\nenhancements, is what's relevant because that is what\nthe person actually did. And once you bring recidivism\ninto the picture, once when the three strikes brings\nrecidivism into the picture, every drug distribution,\nevery drug distribution offense, will become a serious\noffense within the meaning of that --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I guess what you're saying\nis that if it's a victimless crime, that the second\noffense is no more injurious to the State than the first\nwas. I'm not sure that's the case. The fact that the\nState sees multiple offenders, repeat offenders, in its\ncommunity means that they have to spend extra resources\nto prevent -- to incarcerate them because they have a\nnetwork of distributors, et cetera. They are more\nexperienced, so they are more dangerous to the State.\nMR. ROTHFELD: Well, there is no question\nthat recidivism is regarded as -- as, you know, a bad\nthing for a variety of reasons. And that is why\nrecidivism enhancements have been -- are so common. And\nno one, no one disputes that.\nThe question is when Congress wrote this\nstatutory language and wrote this particular kind of\nrecidivism offense in ACCA, it was focusing on what the\ndefendants actually did. The recidivism enhancement is\nentirely unrelated to that.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, we know it was\nfocusing on the particular problem of recidivism.\nThat's what the overarching Federal statute is directed\nto.\nMR. ROTHFELD: But --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And I think,\nfollowing up on Justice Kennedy's question, that you\nwould assume that this Congress thought that recidivists\npresented particular problems that were different from\nthe one particular offense.\nMR. ROTHFELD: It is that recidivism\nstatute, but it is -- again it's a particular kind of\nrecidivism statute different in character from the\nthree-strikes kind of statute, different in character\nfrom the -- the drug recidivism statute in Washington\nState, which is -- which is to be a player. Those\nstatutes do not care whether the predicate acts that --\nthat trigger their application were serious offenses or\nnot. They simply ask is this -- is this defendant\nsomeone who has been convicted of offenses in the past.\nACCA is not like that. ACCA specifically\ntargets serious predicate offenses. The -- the\nstatutory text defines two categories of predicate\noffenses: violent felonies, which -- which are a set of\nespecially dangerous, threatening offenses; and serious\ndrug offenses, using the term \"serious in the text. It\nis clear from that Congress had in mind people who were\nengaged in acts that are themselves harmful,\ndestructive, serious acts. Under the government's\napplication of a recidivism approach, virtually anything\nthat someone is convicted of having to do with drug\ndistribution -- handing a single marijuana cigarette to\na friend -- that is a drug distribution offense. In\nmost States that is punishable by two years, five years\nmaximum. Under the government's approach that is now,\nbecause it could through the recidivism policy lead to a\n10-year --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but the flip\nside of that hypothetical is somebody selling a ton of\nmarijuana. It's the same offense as somebody who's done\nit and been convicted of it three different times. I\nmean, I don't think your hypothetical helps advance the\nargument.\nMR. ROTHFELD: Well, if -- if the crime in\nwhich the individual engaged, selling a ton of\nmarijuana, is going to be punished by ten years, in\nvirtually every jurisdiction -- I would suggest in every\njurisdiction -- therefore it's going to be a serious\ndrug offense within the meaning of ACCA and it's going\nto trigger ACCA as a predicate.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Of course, the recidivist\ndoesn't necessarily be a recidivist because he committed\nthe same crime three times. He might have done two very\ndifferent things under the California three-strike law.\nSometimes very minor crimes push the person over to\nqualify as a recidivist.\nMR. ROTHFELD: No, that's absolutely --\nabsolutely correct.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Rothfeld, apropos of\nyour answers to Justice -- first to Justice Scalia and\nJustice Breyer -- you said that when the -- when the\nrecidivist is being sentenced he is being sentenced for\nthe offense of the -- of the drug crime. Isn't it\nequally fair or wouldn't it be equally fair to say that\nhe is being sentenced for two things? He is being\nsentenced for the drug crime which is the necessary\ncondition of the sentence; and he is also being\nsentenced for the fact that he is repeating that crime.\nIsn't -- isn't it fair to -- to sort of distinguish\nbetween the two, in effect the two factors in the\noffense?\nMR. ROTHFELD: Well, I --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- each one of which is\nnecessary for the -- for the ultimate sentence itself?\nMR. ROTHFELD: Well, I -- I think that\nthat's right and it is reflective of something that --\ndiscussing earlier with Justice Breyer. The offense\nitself is not regarded as a more serious offense when\nit's committed by a recidivist. It's because the\nrecidivist's character as a repeat offender is what\ntriggers the higher penalty; and in the ACCA context\nwhere Congress was focusing on whether or not this\nperson was engaging in particular kinds of crimes,\nparticular kinds of serious crimes, that makes all the\ndifference.\nI -- I return to cases that some members of\nthe Court were discussing with Mr. Shanmugam, the\nLaBonte case. The Government would like to focus on the\nstatus of this defendant as a repeat offender. That's\nwhat triggers in their view the application of ACCA;\nbecause he is a repeat offender he is in a class of\ndefendants who are subject to higher punishment,\ntherefore 10-year ACCA trigger.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I'm not sure the\noffense is the same. I think the injury to the State is\ncompounded by the repetition.\nMR. ROTHFELD: Well, I --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: It affects the tone of the\ncommunity, the number of law enforcement officers we\nhave to have, the cost of reincarceration,\nrehabilitation, etcetera.\nMR. ROTHFELD: Well, I think -- again, I\ndon't disagree with any of that, as to the consequence\nof a repeat offense. My question is whether Congress,\nwhen it used the term serious offense, whether it\nthought the offense itself was more serious, as distinct\nfrom punishment that might -- that might be imposed upon\nthe offender.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But that's what I'm\naddressing. It could be more serious when it's the\nsecond time.\nMR. ROTHFELD: Well, I --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: The offense in and of\nitself.\nMR. ROTHFELD: I think it's -- it's\ninstructive to look at the statute in the LaBonte case\nwhich was -- which discussed during Mr. Shanmugam's\nargument, in which --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Then for double jeopardy\npurposes you must look at the second offense as the\noffense, not the offender. I mean, the prior conduct is\n-- is not being punished as a matter of constitutional\nlaw.\nMR. ROTHFELD: No. I -- I think that it's\nquite clear in the cases that are -- and we agree by\ncases cited by the Government for this proposition --\nthat when you are sentenced as a recidivist to a higher\npenalty you are being punished for the most recent\noffense that you were -- that you were --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, if you were\nrepresenting a -- a defendant who has two prior\nconvictions for something that has a sentence of 8\nyears, and on the third one he is subject to a sentence\nof 15 years; and your initial meeting, the first thing\nhe wants to know is what's the maximum that I'm facing?\nWould you tell him it's 8 years or would you tell him\nit's 15 years?\nMR. ROTHFELD: Well, I would say that\nbecause you are a recidivist the maximum you are facing\nis 15 years. But I would not say that the offense that\nyou committed is a more serious offense because you are\na repeat offender. And and the LaBonte statute I think\nillustrates this very nicely. In the -- in the statute\nthe Court construed in LaBonte it referred to the\nmaximum term of imprisonment for specified categories of\ndefendants; and the Court found that language was\ncrucial because it showed that Congress contemplated\nthat there would be different terms of imprisonment for\ndefendants falling into different categories for the\nsame offense.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Rothfeld, let's assume\nwe get into conference and we are having exactly the\nsame discussion that's been going on for 40 minutes\nthere. There is one way to read it; there is another\nway to read it; there are various reasons to read it one\nway, various ways to read it the other way. What do we\ndo?\nMR. ROTHFELD: Well, I -- I would suggest\nthat this Court need go no further at that point,\nbecause the rule of lenity would dictate ruling for us.\nAbsolutely. It's --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But you don't have to win\nthis argument?\nMR. ROTHFELD: We do not. I think one way\nto consider the case is that there in fact are three\nstatutes which bear on the question of penalty. There\nis the statute that created the crime of conviction,\nwhich created the -- the offense of a distribution of a\nschedule of 3, 4, or 5 drugs, and in that statute\nspecifically associated with the offense is the 5-year\npenalty. There is the 10-year, potential 10-year\npenalty which is focused -- focus of the Government's\ncase. There is the Washington State sentencing\nguidelines, which were binding, determinate guidelines,\nevery bit as much part of Washington statutory law as\nthe recidivism statute --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, the\nGovernment of course responds to your rule of lenity\nargument by saying it loses a lot of its force when we\nare talking about how -- the degree of sentencing rather\nthan whether conduct is subject to a criminal sanction\nin the first place.\nMR. ROTHFELD: They do say that, Your Honor,\nand I think that's simply not so. I mean, the Court has\nsaid repeatedly and has applied repeatedly the doctrine\nthat the rule of lenity applies when the only question\nis the length of the sentence; and indeed the R.L.C.\ncase which the Government has been discussing was a case\nwhich involved only a question of length of the sentence\nand --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But someone who is,\nyou know, we are trying to decide whether he is subject\nto 20 years in jail or 30 years in jail, invoking the\nrule of lenity is a little bit -- it's not the same as\nsomebody who comes in and says I didn't know this was a\ncrime at all, because it's so vaguely written.\nMR. ROTHFELD: I think the Court has said\nconsistently that one of the elements supporting the\nrule of lenity is the idea that somebody's liberty is\ngoing to be taken away, that Congress should have\nspoken, to some degree --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, we know -- we\nknow that someone's liberty is going to be taken away in\na case like this; it's just a question of for how long.\nMR. ROTHFELD: Well, but -- but it's a\nprofound difference. I mean, a the conviction of a\nfelony possession of a gun, the variations in penalty\ncan be zero. Absent ACCA, you could be sentenced to\nprobation, maximum of 10 years, as opposed to the\nmandatory minimum 15-year sentence under ACCA. That's a\nprofound deprivation of liberty based upon how -- what\nreading you give to these words. So -- and again --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I think we have applied the\nrule of lenity to sentencing in the past, haven't we?\nMR. ROTHFELD: Absolutely. Again we cite a\nnumber of cases in our briefs, the Bifulco case -- but\nthe R.L.C. case, which both parties have discussed at\nsome length, is a prime element in which --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It is -- it is a\nfundamental verbal embarrassment for your argument that\nyou would say in a particular case that the maximum to\nwhich someone is subject is say, 5 years, and that\nperson is in fact sentenced to 15 years. It's just the\n-- the words don't fit together under that argument.\nMR. ROTHFELD: Well, I -- I am not\nembarrassed by that, Your Honor. Perhaps I, I'm too\nresistant to embarrassment. But I --\n(Laughter.)\nMR. ROTHFELD: -- I think it's -- it's\nentirely a question of how you take the congressional\nmeaning of the term punishment prescribed for the\noffense.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, but I thought your\nposition was that the -- the defendant is not, this\ndefendant is not subject to a maximum of 5 years, but\ngets 10. I thought your position was that the offense\nwithin the meaning of the statute should be an offense\nwhich carries a maximum of 5 years, but that this\ndefendant is in fact subject to a maximum of 10.\nMR. ROTHFELD: I --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: In other words, you can --\nthroughout your argument you make, I think properly, the\noffense/offender distinction, and isn't that the answer\nto the conundrum?\nMR. ROTHFELD: That -- that is exactly\nright. We think that what Congress had in mind when it\nreferred to the punishment prescribed by law for the\noffense it was referring to the offense, the offense of\nconviction; and it never --\nJUSTICE ALITO: The offense never -- the\noffense also disregards offender characteristics, or\nonly those offender characteristics that are not\nelements of the offense?\nMR. ROTHFELD: Well again, that's -- that's\nwhere we started, Justice Alito.\nJUSTICE ALITO: I'm still not sure what the\nline is there.\nMR. ROTHFELD: I -- I think if it is an\nelement of the offense then you would be convicted of an\noffense which carried in its weight recidivism, and so I\nwould say yes, in that circumstance that would be a\ndifferent situation than what we have here.\nJUSTICE ALITO: It all depends whether it's\nlabelled an element of the offense by the State\nlegislature?\nMR. ROTHFELD: Well, I think that whether it\nactually is an element of the offence -- I mean, in this\ncase there is no question; everyone agrees it's not in\nthe offense; the Government concedes that it's not an\nelement to the offense.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So it's bank robbery --\nbank robbery, force or threat of force guidelines. If\nyou have a gun, eight years. If you brandish it, four\nmore years. If you take, you know, $10 as opposed to\n$50, two years, eight years, six years. The statute, by\nthe way, says a max of 20 years. Now, what's the --\nwhat's -- does this fall within it? Doesn't it? Does\nit depend on whether he brandished it? What does it\ndepend on, in your view?\nMR. ROTHFELD: Well, I'm glad you bring up\nthe guidelines, Your Honor, because I think that that is\nan element that we haven't discussed at some length.\nThe government's test is what is the penalty that the\ndefendant actually faced. I mean that's their --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Or what he actually faced\n-- that, I agree with you, that won't work because of\nthe guidelines, if they were mandatory. But what\nthey're saying here is it's right in the statute. You\njust look at the statute that has the definition of what\nthe offense is.\nMR. ROTHFELD: Aha, but it's not the\ndefinition of the offense. This statute -- the\ndefinition of the offense is --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, I'm back to the same\nquestion then. I mean which one do we pick?\nMR. ROTHFELD: I -- I guess there are two\npoints here -- the first on the question of the\nguidelines. To the extent that the government believes\nin its test, which is what is the sentence that the\ndefendant actually faced, there is no question that the\nsentence the defendant actually faced here was 57\nmonths, well below the 10-year ACCA trigger. And the\ngovernment does not offer any explanation that I can\nunderstand as to why, if their test applies, one takes\nrecidivism enhancements into effect, but does not take\nguidelines reductions into effect.\nJUSTICE BREYER: You see that my question is\ngoing in the exact opposite way. What I am finding hard\nis once you distinguish offender and offense\ncharacteristics in the way you do, why not jump to the\nmax for the offense? And so I'm asking you, how is it\nyou get out of that? Which is the same question I had\nbefore. I'm not so worried about your case as I am\nother cases.\nMR. ROTHFELD: Well, the way -- the way we\nresolve that, Justice Breyer, is what was suggested by\nJustice Souter's question. What Congress had in mind\nwas the offense without the overlay of a recidivism\nenhancement, which is not an element of this offense.\nOne looks at the offense, one looks at the commission of\nthe elements, if you commit the elements, what does that\nsubject -- what kind of punishment does that subject you\nto? If it's less than 10 years, ACCA does not apply.\nIf you have to call into the mix enhancements that are\nunrelated, that are offender-specific and not\noffense-specific, that's falls out because that's not\nwhat Congress had in mind when it referred to\n\"punishment prescribed by law for the offense.\"\nAgain, Congress had in mind a limited series of serious\noffenses. It was looking at what people did, whether\nthey engaged in the kind of serious, harmful,\ndestructive conduct that was sufficiently bad to trigger\nthe mandatory 15-year sentence, and if they did not, the\nfact that some additional overlay could be used to\nenhance their sentence is not what Congress was\nconcerned about when it listed ACCA predicates.\nAnd, again, I don't want to fall away from\nthe Sentencing Guidelines point because, as I understood\nMr. Shanmugam's explanation to Justice Scalia as to why\nthe Guidelines should not apply if enhancement does is\nbecause, well, this is an offender-specific -- an\noffense-specific crime, and Congress at the time that it\nenacted ACCA had in mind that guidelines in the\nstatutory regime were different.\nBut so far as the -- the offense has been\ndefined by the -- by the statute, the relevant offense\nhere is the five-year penalty associated with that\noffense. And so I think that if one is going to go\nbeyond that and say we are going to look for things that\nare outside of the offense, not in the elements of the\noffense, to increase the sentence, as the government\ndoes with the recidivism statute, there is no reason\nwhy, if we are prepared to go outside of the offense\nelements, that one wouldn't go to the Guidelines as\nwell, which have precisely the same effect in the other\nway. I mean the government ultimately is asking for --\na one-way ratchet that if it increases the offense\nlevel, that's okay, but if it decreases the punishment\nfor some reason, that doesn't apply. And we just don't\nsee any principled basis for that.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, no, I thought\ntheir argument was you look at broad categories rather\nthan individual characteristics. It's not a one-way\nratchet at all.\nMR. ROTHFELD: Well, I think, in terms of\ndiscussion of the Guidelines, they suggest that what\nmatters is whether it is an element of the offense. I\nthought that's what Mr. Shanmugam's response was. And\nit is not an element of the offense here. Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMR. ROTHFELD: Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Shanmugam, you\nhave three minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF KANNON K. SHANMUGAM\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. SHANMUGAM: Thank you, Mr. Chief\nJustice.\nThere are just two points that I'd like to\nmake in rebuttal:\nThe first is that the government believes\nthat the rule of lenity is inapplicable here for the\nsimple reason that we believe that the text of the\nstatute is not susceptible to Respondent's\ninterpretation. And if the Court concludes that the\nstatute does permit the interpretation that a given\noffense can have only a single maximum term of\nimprisonment, we believe that the only logical\nconclusion is that that maximum is the maximum that any\noffender could receive, not that the maximum -- not that\nit is the maximum that some better-positioned subset of\noffenders could receive. And while we do believe that\nthe considerations that underlie the rule of lenity have\nless force in this context, and the Court has never\napplied the rule of lenity to the ACCA, we ultimately\nbelieve that the fact that the text does not permit\nRespondent's interpretation is the end of the inquiry.\nThe other point that I would just make is\nthat if this Court were to adopt Respondent's\ninterpretation, it would have pernicious consequences,\nnot only for the ACCA, but likely also for a number of\nother critically important Federal statutes as well.\nWith regard to the ACCA itself, both the definition of\n\"serious drug offense\" and the definition of \"violent\nfelony\" are framed in terms of the maximum term of\nimprisonment for the offense, and at least 28 States and\nthe Federal Government have drug-trafficking offenses\nthat would qualify as ACCA predicates for repeat\noffenders under the government's interpretation but not\nunder Respondent's. And with regard to other statutes\nsimilar language appears --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's good or bad,\ndepending upon whether -- whether your interpretation of\nthe statute is right or the other side's.\nMR. SHANMUGAM: Well --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's good to put more\npeople in jail? I mean, that isn't necessarily what\nwe're after. We're --\nMR. SHANMUGAM: I mean only to highlight the\npractical significance of this issue, Justice Scalia,\nand again, certainly in enacting a statute that itself\ndeals with the problem of recidivism, we believe that\nCongress would not have wanted to be insensitive to an\noffender's past recidivism.\nBut with regard to other statutes, I want to\nnote that similar language also appears in the Federal\nthree-strikes law and in the Controlled Substances Act,\nwhich along with the ACCA, are among the most important\nFederal statutes dealing with a problem of recidivism.\nAnd similar language also appears in a number of general\nFederal criminal statutes, including RICO and the very\nsubstantive statute at issue here, the felony possession\nstatute. And if this Court were to adopt the Ninth\nCircuit's interpretation, it could potentially lead to\nthe narrowing of all of those statutes as well. The\nNinth Circuit, alone among the circuits, has adopted\nthis view that the relevant maximum for an offense must\nbe the maximum that first-time offenders receive. We\nbelieve that that is erroneous and that the judgment of\nthe Ninth Circuit should be reversed.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\n"
