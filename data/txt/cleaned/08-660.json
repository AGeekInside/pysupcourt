First, under Appellate\nRule 4(a)(1)(B) the government is a party in qui tam\nactions because it is named, served, and bound and a\nreal party in interest, all without ever intervening or\nactively participating.\nAnd second, any participation-based test\nparty status will create a burdensome fact-specific\njurisdictional inquiry at the start of every appealed\nand declined qui tam --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Why at the start? Why\nisn't the time the end, when we can -- the notice of\nappeal is to be filed after there is a judgment. Why\nisn't the proper time to determine number of days to\nappeal when the judgment is entered? And at that point,\none can see that the government has done nothing,\nabsolutely nothing in the case.\nAt the inception, I agree with you, we don't\nknow what, if anything, the government is going to do.\nBut by the time judgment is entered, we surely know.\nMR. SCHOR: It will be quite difficult and\nburdensome, even upon entry of judgment, for a relator\nor a defendant to determine whether the government's\nparticipation was sufficiently active to make the\ngovernment a party for purpose --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But we hear the\ngovernment did nothing, not one thing.\nMR. SCHOR: Well, under the -- under the\nactive participation test, that may be. But the\nquestion is -- is, will this Court be adopting the\nactive participation test.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The test is -- I don't\nknow what you mean by \"active participation\" as opposed\nto just plain participation. If the rule is at the time\njudgment is entered to determine how much time you have\nto file your notice of appeal, the question is, has the\ngovernment done anything? And if the government has\ndone nothing at all, then you have 30 days.\nMR. SCHOR: In -- well, to address Your\nHonor's first point, the Second Circuit's test was\nparticipation. The test proposed by Respondents and the\ngovernment is active participation, which narrows --\nnarrows it somewhat. We point out in our opening brief\nthat it's hard to conclude that the government did\nnothing here. It did request to receive orders and --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So that's the question,\nwhether that's enough or whether the government's power\nto prevent discovery, which it can do, is that alone\nenough?\nMR. SCHOR: Well, our position is that the\ntest is the wrong test. Our position is that --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I understand that. But --\nbut I'm saying there are various steps the\ngovernments -- the government can take, and I -- I think\nyou have a point, that even though this case may be an\neasy one, we're going to have to decide in future cases\nhow much -- how much activity by the government is\nenough activity to make the government a party.\nMR. SCHOR: And I think it will be a very\ndifficult determination for the relator or the defendant\nfor several reasons. First of all, the government\nexpressly declines to limit or define the circumstances\nconstituting active participation. So there will be a\nwhole series of legal determinations and possibly trips\nto this Court to determine the content of the standard.\nSecondly, there will be enormously difficult\nfact-gathering efforts for the -- that the relator and\nthe defendant will have to undergo at the end of a case\nafter judgment has been entered. Sometimes a docket\nsheet in a fully litigated qui tam action, declined or\nnot, can be a hundred or 200 pages, and the case will\nhave gone on for 5 or 5 years.\nThe standard would require -- the active\nparticipation standard would require the relator or the\ndefendant to comb through the docket sheet to find every\ninstance of government participation to see whether, if\nthe docket sheet will review it, the participation was\nsufficiently active.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You wouldn't have to\n-- you wouldn't have to do anything like that at all.\nHe would just file before 30 days just to be on the safe\nside. It's not like he's going to say, I'm going to\nanalyze this 100-page document to see whether I get an\nextra 30 days to do something as simple as filing a\nnotice of appeal.\nMR. SCHOR: Respectfully, I think that might\nread out of the rules the 60-day period. But also, I\nthink it's a reflex among trained counsel always to see\nfirst, as soon as judgment is entered, how much time do\nI have to file the notice of appeal. So the inquiry\nwill have to be undertaken unless the --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And -- and if the\ninquiry says it's hard to tell, there's a 30-day limit\nand there's a 60 day limit, I don't know of any\nresponsible counsel who wouldn't file within 30 days.\nMR. SCHOR: If that's the position, then\nthat will read out of the rules the 60-day period. The\nrules do contain a 60-day period.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why would that --\nwhy would it -- I mean, it would still apply to the\ngovernment or any case in which the government is a\nparty, where it's not an issue whether is the government\na party or not.\nMR. SCHOR: If it becomes too difficult to\ndetermine whether the government is a party, then it --\nthen it would be very hard to imagine the relator or the\ndefendant who will feel able to invoke the 60-day\nprovision, and that would effectively make it a dead\nletter --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Oh, no, no, no, I\nagree with you that it -- I'm just saying why in a world\nwould the relator want to invoke the 60-day provision if\nthere's at all -- at all a question about whether it's\n30 days or 60 days?\nMR. SCHOR: It's -- it's the case that\npeople read the rules and see there's a -- there are 30\ndays if the government's not a party and 60 days if the\ngovernment is a party. It's -- it's a function of the\nrules themselves. If the rules say there's a 60-day\nperiod --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Is there any advantage?\nI mean, a notice of appeal is the easiest document, so\nit's not a question that there's any labor involved in\ndoing this. But is there any advantage to filing -- to\ntaking the 60 days instead of the 30 days? Why would\ncounsel want to take advantage of the extra 30 days? It\nisn't a question of a labor, having to write, like\nhaving to write a brief. What advantage would there be\nto taking the additional 30 days?\nMR. SCHOR: If we're talking about relator's\ncounsel, sometimes in a declined qui tam action the\nrelator's counsel may wait to determine, may want to\nknow whether the government will be filing any sort of\namicus brief on appeal before determining whether we'll\ngo ahead with the appeal. And rather than filing what's\nknown as a protective notice of appeal, which isn't --\nwhich isn't an optimal procedure --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: How would the -- how\nwould you know at the time of filing of the notice of\nappeal whether the government is thereafter going to\nfile an amicus brief?\nMR. SCHOR: Relator's counsel is frequently\nin touch with government counsel. And an important\nfactor in whether relator's counsel will pursue an\nappeal and spend the money on the appeal is whether they\nwill have support in any respect from the government.\nSo sometimes it is the case that relator's counsel will\nvery much want to know if government -- if the\ngovernment will be making any sort of supportive filing\non the appeal, and that may take longer to determine\nthan the 30 days. Sometimes it's 60 days.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So -- yes, but --\nyou don't have to know that before you file the one-page\nnotice of appeal. I mean, if you need more time, you\ncan get more time, but you don't have to know all of\nthat. It's not going to cost you a lot of money to file\nthe notice of appeal.\nMR. SCHOR: That's -- that's true.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And if it turns out the\ngovernment is not going to come in, you can always\ndismiss the appeal.\nMR. SCHOR: That is true. I think it's a\nsuboptimal procedure to file something, to file a notice\nwith the court if -- if you're not certain that it's\ngoing to be pursuing your appeal. I think it's better\nto wait and not file until one is certain that one will\nbe pursuing the appeal.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, anyway, a rule's a\nrule and discussing all of these consequences is beside\nthe point. If, indeed, the government's a party, it's\n60 days, right, and you say the government's a party?\nMR. SCHOR: Correct.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And is -- is it your\nposition that the government is a party to this case for\nall purposes, for all purposes of all the rules, or is\nit just some of them?\nMR. SCHOR: No, we are not arguing that the\ngovernment is a party only for some purposes and not\nothers. Our arguments are consistent with the view that\nthe government is a party for the case.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: As opposed to the\ngovernment's view, which does sort of pick and choose\nbetween --\nMR. SCHOR: Correct, and Respondents' as\nwell.\nIf the Court, however, wants to rule\nnarrowly and just decide the Rule 4(a)(1)(B) issue,\nwhether the government is a party under Rule 4(a)(1)(B),\nour arguments are certainly consistent with that as\nwell.\nThe government is -- well let me address one\nissue that may be in the Court's mind or that the Court\nmay be asking. Well, Petitioner, you know, we have the\ngovernment telling us that it doesn't need the 60 days\nwhen it doesn't intervene or actively participate;\ndoesn't that end the matter.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The government is not\nsaying it doesn't need the 60 days. It's saying you\ndon't qualify for the 60 days, you are not the\ngovernment. I don't think the government is arguing\nthat its own time can be shortened.\nMR. SCHOR: Well, the rule is that if the\ngovernment gets 60 days everybody gets 60 days, even\nprivate parties like the relator. But I believe the\ngovernment's position is that if the rationale for\ngiving 60 days doesn't apply, then everyone else\nshouldn't get the benefit of the 60 days, either. I\nbelieve that's the government's position.\nWe would argue that two factors detract from\nthe government's argument in that respect. First of\nall, it's unrealistic to think that the government will\nnever need the 60-day period if it doesn't intervene or\nactively participate. The problem arises if the relator\ndoes not appeal. If the relator litigates and tries a\ncase with sufficient skill that the government doesn't\nneed to take over and the district court nonetheless\nenters judgment for the defendant, the problem arises if\nthe relator doesn't appeal or doesn't appeal the\nparticular issue or order that the government would like\nbefore the court of appeals. In that case, an amicus\nfiling won't protect the government's interests and the\ngovernment will have to appeal. And once it's conceded\nthat the government has to appeal, then it has to be\nconceded that the government will need 60 days. That\nis, that the rationale for the 60-day period is fully\napplicable.\nIt's also true sometimes --it's not at all\nfanciful that the relator might not appeal. The relator\nmight have spent a lot of money, time and money pursuing\nthe trial, and, having lost, may have called it quits\nfor purposes of the appeal. Or the defendant might say\nto the relator: Look, if you don't pursue your appeal,\nwe won't file a bill of costs against you. There could\nbe all kinds of reasons why the relator might not\nappeal. If the relator doesn't appeal, there will be no\nappeal in which the government can make an amicus\nfiling.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So there may be --\nthere may be a lot of reasons the relator will not\npursue an appeal. I don't think there's any reason that\nthe relator would not file a notice of appeal within 30\ndays or, if he doesn't like 30 days, you ask for an\nextension of time for another 30 days. Then the whole\nissue is moot.\nMR. SCHOR: It -- it may be, but I believe\nthat if Rule 4(a)(1)(B) creates a 60-day period, then\nthe litigants have an entitlement to invoke it.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, your argument goes --\nis replying to the government the Respondent's argument\nthat there is no sense in giving 60 days to the\ngovernment, and what you're saying is, yes, sometimes\nthere is.\nMR. SCHOR: Correct.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Even when the government\nhas not actively participated. So it really negates,\nyou know, you're doing something that has no point. It\ncould have a point, to give the government 60 days, even\nin a case where it has not actively participated. It\nmay need that long to consult with other agencies as to\nwhether to accept a defeat in this case or -- or on its\nown to conduct an appeal if the relator doesn't want to.\nMR. SCHOR: That's correct, and --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Can the government appeal\nwithout having intervened in the district court?\nMR. SCHOR: Since the government is bound by\nthe judgment, I believe that the government does have\nthat right. I don't have authority in the False Claims\nAct context for that position, but I think it follows\nfrom the conclusion, which is undisputed here, that the\ngovernment is bound by the judgment in a declined qui\ntam action even where the government doesn't actively --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I'm sure the government\nwill agree with that. I'm sure that's one of the\ncontexts in which they agree that the government is a\nparty.\nMR. SCHOR: Yes, I think that's right,\nalthough they can speak for themselves.\nNow, the -- it's important also to note that\nwhen the government declines to proceed with a qui tam\naction, it might be declining to conduct the action or\ntake discovery or use its resources, but it's not\ndeclining to get a judgment. The judgment gets a\nbinding judgment even when it declines. There's no\ndispute that the claim is the government's claim and\nthat the judgment finally disposes of it. If in a\ndeclined action the relator litigates and gets a $10\nmillion award, the government takes the money. And so\nthe government is bound by the judgment. The judgment,\nfinally disposes of the government's claim.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But there are some\nprovisions that -- that seem to indicate the government\nisn't a party. For example, it specifically provides\nthat even when the government hasn't intervened, the\ngovernment may request copies of the pleadings. Doesn't\nit have to make requests for them?\nMR. SCHOR: The government has to make\nrequests.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, why would it have to\ndo that if it's a party?\nMR. SCHOR: The --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So you're -- I mean, you're\nsaying they are not a party for that rule at least, that\nrequires the pleadings to be served upon the other\nparty.\nMR. SCHOR: No. But Congress can restrict\nthe operation of particular Federal Rules of Civil\nProcedure. The argument that I think Your Honor is\naverting to is the Rule 5 argument that my -- that\nRespondents and the government make. Rule 5 doesn't\ndefine who the party is. It attaches certain\nconsequences to being a party, but it doesn't define who\na party is. It says you get to be served if you are a\nparty. You get to be served with certain pleadings and\nCongress --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Right.\nMR. SCHOR: Congress restricted that right\nin the False Claims Act. But that doesn't make it a\nparty. What makes it a party is whether it's named --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I'm not following you. I'm\nsaying if -- if the government is a party, Rule 5 would\napply and the government would automatically get copies\nof the pleading whether or not it requested them. So\nthe provision in the False Claims Act that the\ngovernment will only get copies if it requests them\nseems to indicate that the government is not a party.\nMR. SCHOR: The fact that ordinarily a party\nmight get served with certain pleadings doesn't mean\nthat if Congress restricts that right, it's not a party.\nIt means it's a party that Congress has -- for whom\nCongress has restricted the right. And that --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Do you think that\neveryone -- you are relying on the government, that the\ngovernment is in the caption and it's a real party in\ninterest. Is every real party in interest a party for\nthis purpose?\nMR. SCHOR: No, we are not arguing that. To\nbe a party, a real party in interest must be named in\nthe -- the actions needs to be brought in the name of\nthe real party in interest. And we've cited abundant\nauthority for the proposition that that means that the\npleadings must identify that person by name. If the\naction is to be brought in the name of Smith, then the\npleadings must identify Smith as the plaintiff. So the\nnaming requirement must be complied with. It's not\nsufficient in our view just to be a real party.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Can I come back to the Rule\n5 point just for a minute? You say that the effect of\nthe False Claims Act is simply to restrict what would\nnormally be the right of the government to get copies of\nall the pleadings. That's really not how it reads. It\ndoesn't say that the government shall receive copies of\nthe pleadings only if it requests them. It says the\ngovernment shall receive copies of the pleadings if it\nrequests them, as though without that provision it\nwouldn't have a right to receive copies. Isn't that the\nway it reads?\nMR. SCHOR: It does read that way. I think\nthe addition of \"only\" is logician's language, Your\nHonor. I'm not sure that the drafters --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that's what we are\ndown here, you know.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. SCHOR: It may be, but not every\ndrafting of a statute rises to that level of --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Precision.\nMR. SCHOR: -- of quality. The attachment\nof the condition \"if it requests\" I think goes a long\nway towards suggesting that if it doesn't so request,\nthen it -- it won't, which means that Congress has\nrestricted the operation of -- of Rule 5. And -- and\nthere are a number of instances where Congress will\nrestrict the operation of Federal Rules of Civil\nProcedure even when someone is concededly a party to the\ncase.\nI have cited a number of instances in that\n-- of that in our reply brief. There are a number of\nstatutory actions, especially where the government is a\nparty, where, even though it is concededly a party and\neveryone's a party, the -- the normal party discovery\nobligations don't apply. We have cited FOIA and EPA and\ntax summons and -- and habeas is a slightly different\nexample. But there are many examples where Congress\nwill step in and restrict the obligations that the\nFederal Rules would otherwise apply to people who are\nparties without depriving them of party status.\nI would like to address the intervention\nprovision. We have many arguments in our briefs as to\nwhy the intervention provision doesn't determine party\nstatus. I think that the simplest way from A to B is to\nfollow through to its conclusion an example that the\ngovernment gives. The government says that if it vetoes\na settlement, then it is a party.\nWell, if it vetoes a settlement -- - that\nis, without having intervened. If it vetoes a\nsettlement without having intervened, the case goes\nforward because there is no settlement. But then if the\ngovernment wants to conduct the action, the only way it\ncan conduct the action under the statute is if it then\nintervenes. So you have a case where the government is\nalready a party when it intervenes; and, therefore, even\nunder the government's example the intervention\nprovision cannot determine party status.\nI would like to just go back to the\ndefinition of -- of \"party\" that is in our briefing.\nThe -- several provisions of the False Claims Act show\nthat, even without ever intervening or actively\nparticipating, the government satisfies the classic\nelements of party status. It's a real party interest\nbecause the statute upholds the government's claim and\ngives the government the bulk of recovery. The -- the\ngovernment is named as a plaintiff in the pleadings\npursuant to the act's naming requirements. The\ngovernment is served with the complaint under Federal\nRule of Civil Procedure 4 pursuant to the act's service\nrequirement. And the government is bound by the\njudgment, which is not even disputed here. Those are\nthe classic elements of party status, and the government\nsatisfies them all in this case.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: There is something odd\nabout -- plaintiffs come to the court seeking something.\nDefendants are -- are stuck. They're being sued. And\nhere the United States is an involuntary plaintiff. It\ndidn't commence this lawsuit, and I think there must be\nmany cases where the government will say, we don't want\nanything to do with this.\nMR. SCHOR: I -- I don't think it's accurate\nto say that the government is an involuntary plaintiff,\nbecause Congress has said the United States will be a\nplaintiff under these circumstances and -- and in that\nrespect Congress has spoken for the United States.\nIt is an oddity of the False Claims Act that\nthe plaintiff is served with the complaint, but that's\nthere on the face of the statute. And once it's served,\nhaving been named and having been already a real party\nin interest by operation of law, then it has -- it's\nalready a party at that point. And if it's a party at\nthat point, then it's a party for purposes of Federal\nRules of Appellate Procedure 4(a)(1)(B) and -- and may\nbe for other purposes as well.\nI would like to --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: May be for other purposes?\nI thought you told me before that it was for other\npurposes as well.\nMR. SCHOR: Yes, it is.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. Let's stay on track.\nMR. SCHOR: Yes.\nI would like to --\nJUSTICE ALITO: It's not really a party for\nall purposes in your submission. It's not a party for\ndiscovery purposes, is it?\nMR. SCHOR: In -- in our argument it is a\nparty even though it is not subject to discovery. There\nare two ways one could characterize the government. One\ncan either say it's not a party for purposes of\ndiscovery; or, as we say, citing authority in our reply,\nit is a party, but it is for other statutory reasons not\nsubject to discovery.\nThe declination provision is key here. By\nthe declination provision Congress said the government\ncan decline to engage in discovery. All right. It\ndeclines to conduct the action. One aspect of\nconducting the action is engaging in discovery. The\ngovernment can decline to engage. That means not only\nnot serving discovery requests, but not responding to\ndiscovery requests. And that's part and parcel of the\ndeclination provision. That's the way Congress\nstructured it.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Where is that? What\nprovision is that? I didn't focus on that.\nMR. SCHOR: The declination provision, Your\nHonor?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes. I am sorry. I didn't\nmean to eat up your time with this.\nMR. SCHOR: No, that's all right.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, where is it in the\nstuff that I have?\nMR. SCHOR: Oh.\nWell, it's certainly on page 2 of our\nopening brief. It says: \"If the government elects not\nto proceed with the action, the person who initiated the\naction shall have the right to conduct the action.\" And\nthere are other provisions that we cite in footnote 27.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but that doesn't say\nanything about discovery in particular. I thought you\nwere talking about some declination provision that --\nthat said the government is -- is not subject to\ndiscovery.\nMR. SCHOR: Well, footnote 27 of our brief\nalso cites other provisions of the act that -- that\ndefine what it means \"to conduct the action.\" And\ndiscovery is one of them, and the declination provision\nsays that if the government declines -- if the\ngovernment -- if the government intervenes, then it\nconducts the action; if it declines, then it doesn't\nconduct the action. And the rest of the act defines\nwhat \"conducting the action\" is, and that includes\ndiscovery.\nso our -- our conclusion from that is that\nwhen the government declines to conduct the action, it's\ngoing to decline to engage in discovery. That's --\nthat's the argument.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And -- and the fact that it\ncannot conduct discovery also involves the fact that\nit's immune from discovery, how do you get that? And it\nis; is it not?\nMR. SCHOR: Yes, that's our position, and I\nthink that's the government's position as well.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, I'm sure it's the\ngovernment's position.\nMR. SCHOR: It would be --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But how can that -- how can\nthat be if it's a party?\nMR. SCHOR: If -- it's a party who is\nbecause of the declination provision not subject to\ndiscovery.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The declination provision\ndoesn't say that. The declination provision just says\nthat it is not actively conducting the case. But how do\nyou get its exemption from discovery?\nMR. SCHOR: Because the declination\nprovision says that if the government declines, then it\nwill not conduct the action; The relator will conduct\nthe action. And \"conducting the action\" is defined\nelsewhere in the statute as including conducting\ndiscovery, engaging in discovery. And it would be hard\nto imagine Congress contemplating such asymmetry in --\nin discovery obligations that --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I agree with that, but --\nbut it's -- it's for me a problem with your assertion\nthat for all purposes the government is a party. It\nseems to me it is not a party for purposes of discovery,\nand there is no provision in -- in the -- in the False\nClaims Act that exempts it from discovery.\nMR. SCHOR: There is -- it's an inference\ndrawn from the statute, Your Honor.\nIn sum, we would ask the Court to reverse\nthe judgment of the Second Circuit, and I would like to\nreserve the balance of my time for rebuttal.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Rephen.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL T. REPHEN\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. REPHEN: Mr. Chief Justice, and members\nof the Court:\nWhen the government declines to intervene in\na qui tam action, it should not be deemed a party for\npurposes of the Rules of Procedure Rule 4. The\ngovernment's role is described in terms of intervention\nas of right in the first 60 days following the filing of\nthe complaint and for good cause thereafter if the\ngovernment decides to come in after initial declination.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: This is certainly a\ntrap for the unaware, right? I mean, every lawyer loves\nto win on a technicality, but --\nMR. REPHEN: I don't think this is a trap\nfor the unwary. It is clear --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It says if the\nUnited States is a party, it is -- it is 60; if it's\nnot, it's 30. And you have got a situation where the\nUnited States -- the action is brought in the name of\nthe United States.\nMR. REPHEN: It is brought in the name of\nthe United States. But, you know, looking at the\nstatute, where the government has declined, it's not a\nparty. Any conservative counsel, if there are two\nperiods of time, 30 days or 60 days, the intelligent\nthing to do is to go ahead --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I know, but this is\nsuch a -- such a trap for the unwary that you never even\nraise this point. It was raised sua sponte by the court\nof appeals.\nMR. REPHEN: And rejected. And I think\nafter -- it is hard to see --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, my point is if\nit didn't occur to you, how can you claim that it should\ndefinitely have occurred to your friend on the other\nside?\nMR. REPHEN: I don't know that it didn't\noccur to us. I think we were trying to reject it, and\ncertainly after this Court decides the issue it would no\nlonger be a trap for the unwary. The decision will be\nout there, either 30 days or 60 days.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this question\nabout: Are there a number of circuits that follow the\n60-day rule?\nMR. REPHEN: Yes.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And in those cases,\nsuppose we decide your way in this case. What happens\nto the -- all the appeals that have been taken relying\non the 60-day rule? Because I understand the failure to\nfile a notice of appeal is jurisdictional.\nMR. REPHEN: I think those appeals will be\nterminated.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: All of those would be\nterminated?\nMR. REPHEN: Yes.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And what about judgments\nthat have been entered based on appeals that were --\nMR. REPHEN: I don't know. I guess those\njudgments would have to be vacated, the judgments --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: So we are really -- in\nseveral circuits, a really rather important decision is\nbeing called for?\nMR. REPHEN: Yes, yes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Why would the judgment\nhave to be vacated? Even a jurisdictional issue becomes\nsubject to preclusion once you have gone the appeal\nroute --\nMR. REPHEN: That is true, Your Honor,\ncorrect, yes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So even the\njurisdictional base can be precluded and not raised on\ncollateral attack.\nMR. REPHEN: You are correct, Your Honor.\nAgain, as I said, the -- what the Congress has done --\nit is very important in this case to look at the\nlegislative history. Congress has given the government\n60 days to weigh the risks and benefits of getting\ninvolved in the case. If it chooses to do so, it has\nfull responsibility for the conduct of the litigation.\nIf it declines to do that, the\nstatute provides that the relator shall have full\nresponsibility for the conduct of the litigation and\nrequires the government, if it subsequently wants to get\ninvolved, to make a motion for intervention, during\nwhich time it has to show good cause. And it's our\nposition that intervention should be given its ordinary\nand common meaning, which is the method by which a\nperson who is not a party becomes a party.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Except that the government\nhere has considerable powers even without intervening,\nand they include its ability to move to stay discovery,\nwhich normally a party would only be able to do. It can\nobject to any voluntary dismissal or settlement, which\nnormally would be a party's right.\nMR. REPHEN: There are certain --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And some courts have\nallowed the government to move to dismiss.\nMR. REPHEN: There is certainly a limited\nrole here, but it is a very limited role. The\ngovernment can do that. This Court has recognized that\nit can be a party for this limited purpose. For\nexample, if the government moved to dismiss and they\nhave -- there has to be a hearing following that, and\nthat motion were denied, the government could not then\nparticipate on the merits of the case. It would have to\nmove to intervene for good cause if the 60 days had\npassed.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So unlike -- unlike your\nadversary here, you -- your adversary says the\ngovernment is a party for all purposes; you are not\nsaying the government is not a party for all purposes.\nYou're saying it's not a party for some purposes?\nMR. REPHEN: What we're saying is certainly\nit is not a party in this case, where it has quite\nabsolutely no role.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You are saying that.\nMR. REPHEN: There may be --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But you're also saying as\nfor the rest, sometimes it is, sometimes it isn't.\nMR. REPHEN: There may -- there may be\ncircumstances. If the Court were to hold that\nintervention is required even in those limited\ncircumstances, that would be okay with us. We're not\ntaking --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How about -- I'm\nsorry. Why don't you finish, counselor?\nMR. REPHEN: We're not taking a formal\nposition on that.\nI think --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, how does it\nwork in -- presumably, I guess the government can decide\nthat it wants to appeal the case in which it has not\nparticipated below, right?\nMR. REPHEN: It would have to move to\nintervene.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It has to move to\nintervene. So let's say there's a judgment and the\ngovernment looks at it and says: Well, we didn't know\nwe would get a decision like this; We've got to appeal\nthis. The relator doesn't want to appeal it. 30 days\ngoes by. The Government moves to intervene because it\nhas 60 days.\nMR. REPHEN: I think we would take the\nposition there is no longer a case, Your Honor. It has\n30 days; the relator has not appealed. The government\nwas not a party during that 30-day period. 31, 32, 33\ndays, the case is over. I guess there is a possibility\nfor the government to move to extend its time under the\nrules, but generally there would be an opportunity for\nthe government to intervene. As soon as the case is\nover, it had not been a party, it had not chosen to be a\nparty, and the time has expired.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So for all the\nreasons in the legislative history that you discussed\nabout why the government gets more time, those reasons\ndon't apply in that situation?\nMR. REPHEN: It doesn't apply if there is no\nlonger a case, and if 30 days has gone by, there would\nbe no longer a case.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What's -- what about the\ncase that they were talking about, so the relator's\npursuing a case, that case is over, and they're not\ngoing to appeal because they don't have any money left,\nwhatever it is; but the government looks at that\njudgment and thinks, oh, God, there's something wrong\nwith this one, I better appeal it. That's the\ngovernment lawyer speaking.\nNow, they're supposed to have 60 days to\nfigure that one out, and you'll take that 60 away from\nthem because they'll have to do this whole thing in 30.\nMR. REPHEN: Yes. Having not intervened in\nthe case, they had not been a party.\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, because they didn't\nexpect --\nMR. REPHEN: Rule 4 --\nJUSTICE BREYER: The judge did -- the judge\ndid a surprising thing, which judges sometimes do.\nMR. REPHEN: Well, the government -- the\ngovernment is given that opportunity to monitor the\ncase. They can come in. The government having chose --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Would this be a solution\nwhich wouldn't help you? You would say, well, there's\nsome factors here cut one way, and there's some that cut\nthe other way, and some circuits have said the\ngovernment should have the 60 days, and those cases are\nalready proceeding. So it's best to keep it where it\nis, which is 60 days, and then suggest the Rules\nCommittee look into this, since we don't actually --\nMR. REPHEN: That's right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And it -- all right. And\nthe Rules Committee would looked into it if it's a\nproblem.\nMR. REPHEN: The rules give 60 days to the\ngovernment when it's a party. If it's not a party --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, I know. That's\nrepeating your argument. And I'm suggesting what would\nbe wrong with the view that you lose because of the\nreasons I said.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You rely a lot, counsel, on\n-- on intervention, as that's what makes the government\na party.\nMR. REPHEN: I think the rules --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Right?\nMR. REPHEN: Well, we rely on it because\nthat was what Congress said. Congress has made it clear\nusing intervention --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The original statute or the\nearlier statute did not use the word \"intervention.\"\nMR. REPHEN: But we used it in a number --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I forget the different word\nit used?\nMR. REPHEN: \"Appearance,\" maybe.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Appearance?\nMR. REPHEN: Is appearance. But Congress --\nCongress clearly means that now in 1986. I think\nCongress knew what it was intending. Absent any\nlegislative history that Congress intended to not give\nthe term \"intervention\" its commonly understood term --\nand it's such a commonly understood term -- by which a\nnonparty becomes a party, I think one should give it\nthat normal intention.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I really wonder\nwhether they didn't intend the same -- the same result.\nIf you think they consciously -- under the prior\nstatute, you would say the government --\nMR. REPHEN: Our argument was --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The government would have\nbeen a party?\nMR. REPHEN: I wouldn't --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Because you can be a party\nand not appear.\nMR. REPHEN: I wouldn't say that, Your\nHonor. But I know in 1986 what they were attempting to\ndo is strengthen the right of private persons to bring\nqui tam actions. For the first time, the government was\ngiven a limited right to come in for good cause after 60\ndays. But if you look at the legislative history of\nthat, I think Congress intended that the right of the\ngovernment to intervene after 60 days was somewhat\nlimited, and they had to show good cause.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, I -- I\npressed your friend about what's the big deal, why don't\nyou just file within 30. It only seems fair to press\nyou on what's the big deal with letting them have for\n60 --\nMR. REPHEN: The big -- I think --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- which also solves\nthe problem of the potential trap for the unwary.\nMR. REPHEN: I think the big deal is that it\ncan open more questions that it resolves if you give the\ngovernment party status for this purpose.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I agree with\nthat. I agree with that. But what if we say --\nMR. REPHEN: And I think Your Honor, I think\nthat, Chief Justice --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry. What if\nI say, or whoever is writing the opinion says, this is\nonly for purposes of filing the appeal? We don't decide\nwhether the government is a party in all these other\ncharacteristics, but whether it comes to Rule 4(a) --\nMR. REPHEN: I think the purpose of Rule 4\nwas to give the government time to make a decision when\nit's actually a party and it has a right to appeal. It\nshould -- it is jurisdictional. It should be construed\nnarrowly. The purpose of the rule is to expedite the\nprocess of appeals --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, it should be\nconstrued narrowly. I don't think saying whether it's\n30 or 60 days at all implicates that principle.\nMR. REPHEN: Well, if -- if the rule\nprovides that the government should have 60 days when it\nis a party and it's not a party, then it seems to me\nit's a bit more --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, yeah, but I\nmean, if we assume you're right, then that's construing\nit narrowly. But the whole question is that there's\nsome confusion in the rule about who's right, and all\nI'm saying is it seems to me that it would be the\neasiest thing to avoid any trap for the unwary with no\nconsequences on the other side, to say 60 days.\nMR. REPHEN: But I think it wouldn't be\nconsistent with the intent of Congress or the intent of\nthe rule, which is to move appeals along really within\n30 days. The exception is given to the government when\nit is a party, when it has to --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Oh, this isn't going\nto delay appeals, for heaven's sakes. I mean, there's\nall sorts of scheduling rules about the timing of the\nbriefs and everybody gets an extension on their briefs.\nThis is going to have no effect whatever on how quickly\nappeals move along.\nMR. REPHEN: Then I would tell Your Honor,\nyou know, whether or not you want to give somebody a\nbreak on that, it is simply inconsistent with the rule,\nwhich requires the United States to be a party when they\nhave, as in this case, played absolutely no role; and\nthey are clearly not a party.\nAgain, turning to the question of the real\nparty in interest, as I think was discussed, real party\nin interest is simply one who can bring the lawsuit.\nMr. Eisenstein is a real party in interest. A real\nparty in interest is not synonymous with party status.\nRule 17 describes real party in interest. Obviously\nRule 4 describes a party --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The other side acknowledges\nthat. They say, however, it's different when you have\nreal party in interest plus the party named --\nMR. REPHEN: I --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- and these things are\nstyled \"United States.\"\nMR. REPHEN: Your Honor, I don't think it's\nan accumulation of all of these bits of real party in\ninterest. Well, it doesn't really count, now the\nparties named --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No, no, no. No, no, that's\n-- that's unfair. If you are a real party in interest\nand you are the named party --\nMR. REPHEN: I think the naming -- the\nnaming --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You're normally a party.\nMR. REPHEN: The naming is nominal. I think\nthe real question is to look at the intent of Congress\nin terms of the right of the government to participate,\nand I would point out, I think during the first 80 years\nof experience under the qui tam action, the United\nStates was named but had absolutely no right to play a\nrole in the litigation.\nI don't know that we should elevate form\nover substance here, and I must come back again to what\nwe think is the critical role, which was the intent of\nCongress in requiring intervention on the part of the\nUnited States Government if it decides that it wants to\nassume the burdens of party status.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But there are certain\nthings the government can do, you concede, without\nintervening?\nMR. REPHEN: Yes, there are certain limited\nroles. I don't know that that makes them a party for\npurposes of the Eisenstein case.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: If the government did\ndecide to take over, the qui tam plaintiff would remain\na party --\nMR. REPHEN: But the government would have\nprimary responsibility under the statute.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So why shouldn't it work\nthe other way? When the government stays out, it's a\nparty -- when the government isn't conducting the\nlitigation, it's a party just as a qui tam plaintiff\nwould be a party.\nMR. REPHEN: Yes, I think the standard is\nintervention, and absent intervention by the United\nStates, it should not be a party.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Except the United States\nhas a lot of power. Unlike the -- the government's\npresentation here, you would not allow any degree of\nactivity on the part of the government to cause it to be\na party, even if it exercises all these other powers\nshort of intervening? It must intervene in your --\nMR. REPHEN: No, we would accept -- if it\nhas to be a bright line, we would accept intervention.\nWe recognize, though, the standard that you can be a\nparty for limited purpose as --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, do you want a bright\nline or not a bright line?\nMR. REPHEN: I would -- we would --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Do you agree with the\ngovernment?\nMR. REPHEN: We would live with a bright\nline certainly.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Do you agree with the\ngovernment's presentation that it becomes a party when\nit reaches a certain ineffable degree of activity in the\ncase?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. REPHEN: I don't know if it's ineffable.\nI think the government was relying on the Devlin\ndecision, where there was some indication that there\ncould be status of being a party where there is limited\nfor participation for collateral purposes. But again in\nDevlin, the government had argued that intervention was\nthe preferable method of getting into a case. The Court\nrejected that because they thought intervention\nessentially would be pro forma, but in this -- in this\n--\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't think they were\nrelying on Devlin. The --\nMR. REPHEN: They were relying --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The point they are making\nhere --\nMR. REPHEN: They were addressing --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: --- is not that we're a\nparty for some purposes and not for others. The point\nthey're making is we're a party for all purposes, once\nwe reach a certain degree of activity in the case.\nMR. REPHEN: I don't think the government is\nsaying they're a party for all purposes which is a --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I think they were.\nMR. REPHEN: -- of activity.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: We disagree on that.\nMR. REPHEN: I guess we'll hear from them\nshortly.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: We'll hear from them.\nMR. REPHEN: If there are no further\nquestions, then we can -- we can hear from the\ngovernment.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Wall.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY B. WALL\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,\nAS AMICUS CURIAE,\nSUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. WALL: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I have a question for you,\nMr. Wall.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. WALL: I thought you might.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What is the government's\nposition on that point?\nMR. WALL: I actually wanted to start\nexactly where you and Justice Ginsburg began because I\nthink we've gotten off a little bit on the wrong track.\nIf this Court wants a bright-line rule, the\nright rule is intervention. Now, that would solve 98 or\n99 percent of qui tam suits under the False Claims Act.\nThe government urged intervention as a prerequisite in\nDevlin, and this Court disagreed. So the government\nleft open the possibility in its brief that in a very\nsmall number of qui tam suits, on the order of 1 percent\nor less, it might participate, absent intervention, in a\nway that would justify treatment as a party under\nDevlin.\nBut whether or not the Court agrees with us\non that -- a question not presented here where the\ngovernment hasn't participated in any way -- the right\nrule is intervention, and it's just a question of\nwhether this Court wants to make it cover 98 percent of\nthe suits or 100 percent of the suits.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Do you take the position\nthat without intervention though, nonetheless the\ngovernment could appeal at the -- at the tail end?\nMR. WALL: No, we do not think --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: You don't think that --\nokay.\nMR. WALL: -- that the government could have\nappealed the judgment here as of right, and that is why\nwe think the purposes of the 60-day period were not\nimplicated. Because the government couldn't appeal, it\nwas not a potential appellant that required the\nauthorization of the Solicitor General, and it didn't\nneed the 60 days. And that's an important point, I\nthink, about why it couldn't just be solved by the --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Doesn't it need the 60 days\nto figure out whether it would want to intervene in\norder to be able to appeal?\nMR. WALL: Justice Scalia, I think that\nwould be equally true in a number of contexts -- for\ninstance, class action settlements where the government\nis entitled to notice, presumably so that it can\nintervene; government contractor suits. There are any\nnumber of Federal cases where the government might find\nthe decision shocking and want to come in, but until it\ndoes, it's a non-party.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But they are not statutes\nwhich give the government an extended period of time in\norder to allow the consultation. This is a statute that\ndoes that. And why would they -- why would they not\nenvision the need for that consultation in the situation\nwhere the government has had no participation but comes\nup with a -- with a decision contrary to what it thinks\nthe good law is, and it has to decide whether it wants\nto intervene in order to appeal. Why shouldn't they be\ngiven 60 days?\nMR. WALL: Well, Justice Scalia, with all\nrespect, the False Claims Act itself doesn't say\nanything about intervention. It doesn't say anything\nabout 60 days. It just says the government has a right\nto come in and take over the action and run it and allow\nthe relator to continue as a party. And that's why it\nuses the word \"intervene\" -- because Congress understood\nthat, in its accepted legal meaning, as a process by\nwhich a nonparty becomes a party, and the idea was to\ngive the executive branch a choice. In each qui tam\nsuit, the executive is able to determine whether to\nassume the greater benefits and burdens of party status.\nPetitioner is caught in the awkward position\nof saying that he thinks that the government is a party\nat the time the case is filed, not then a party for\npurposes of discovery, but even though it hasn't done\nanything, it's somehow a party again when the notice of\nappeal is filed. And the government's position is that\njust where it does not come into the case and doesn't\nintervene, it's not a party for any of those purposes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What -- why do you\ncare? I mean, you're just giving people who might well\nbe confused by this provision another 30 days.\nMR. WALL: I think there are two distinct\nharms, Mr. Chief Justice. The first is to the\ngovernment, and the second is to Congress and the system\nit set up in the statute. The harm to the government is\nthat, if it can be made a party under FRAP 4, despite\nthe fact that it has actively attempted to decline party\nstatus, it could also be made a party under the other\nrule.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay, but, again, we\nwould limit any decision to Federal Rule of Appeal 4\nbecause of the dramatically adverse consequences for the\nunwary. They lose their right to pursue their case.\nMR. WALL: I don't think the government has\nany objection in theory to a period of 60 days for only\nFRAP 4. I think the difficulty is that any number of\nrules speak in terms of parties. And Petitioners\nadvance no persuasive between FRAP 4 and other rules.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I just does\ndid. Under FRAP 4, you're out the door without any\nhearing on the merits. It's a technicality. The spirit\nof the rules is that we don't throw people out because\nof mere technicalities. Now, failure to file a timely\nnotice of appeal is not a technicality in terms of the\nconsequences.\nMR. WALL: That's right. Three brief\npoints, I think.\nFirst, if this Court announces a 30-day\nrule, that's clear going forward. Relators and their\ncounsel will treat declined qui tam suits like civil\nactions generally to which the United States is a party.\nSecond, if the rules are better read for a\n30-day period, because the United States was not a\nparty, you're entitled to appeal the judgment, then\nPetitioner was not entitled to assume that he would get\n60 days --\nJUSTICE ALITO: What about the relators and\nthe parties in the four circuits that have adopted the\n60-day rule. They had a court of appeals opinion in\nfront of them that said you had 60 days. They're just\nout of luck now?\nMR. WALL: Well, I think they also were on\nnotice that there's a long-standing circuit split on\nthis question which the court has never answered. Given\nthe fact that what you're talking about is a ministerial\ntask, filing a one-page notice, there are actually\nFederal court manuals that instruct in this circumstance\nrelator's counsel to file within the 30 days.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sure that the\nAppellate Rules Advisory Committee, when they hear this\ndecision, if they haven't already, will put something in\nthe rules about whether it's 30 days or 60 days. So I'm\nnot terribly concerned about clarity going forward.\nIt's going to be made clear by the Advisory Committee\nand the submission of new rules, and I see no reason\nthat they wouldn't make it clear. I don't know whether\nthey'll think 30 or 60 is the best idea.\nMR. WALL: Right, and --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So it's just a\nquestion of -- in this case and, as Justice Stevens\npointed out, what the effect is going to be on other\ncases. And it seems to me that in that situation, 60\ndays makes the most sense because otherwise you're\ndisrupting the system solely based on a trap for the\nunwary.\nMR. WALL: Well, and that goes to a question\nthat Justice Breyer asked earlier. The statute, 2107,\nwas enacted after what is now FRAP 4. The rule and the\nstatute shortened the period to appeal from 3 months to\n30 days. And then the Judicial Conference, in the -- in\nthe -- what is now FRAP 4, drew the exception of 60 days\nfor cases in which the United States was a party because\nof an express need for more time for the Solicitor\nGeneral to make a decision.\nThe Judicial Conference raised some question\nabout how we do that. Two years later Congress enacted\nthe statute putting in the 30-day and 60-day rules. I\nthink then that's a baseline. And I'm not sure that the\nadvisory committee could come back and effectively amend\nthe -- amend the statute by changing the rule.\nWhat Congress had in mind when it passed\n2107 was if the -- if the -- the United States is a\npotential appellant and requires more time to conduct\nits internal decisionmaking processes, it gets 60 days.\nOtherwise, that 30-day baseline governs, and I\nrespectfully disagree, Mr. Chief Justice, that Congress\nwas not concerned about moving appeals forward\nexpeditiously. It shortened the period from three\nmonths to 30 days precisely because of wanting judgments\nto become final.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But it is -- it is a\npotential appellant. I mean if you say Congress is\nconcerned about situations in which the government is a\npotential appellant. It is a potential appellant in\nthese cases until the 30 days have elapsed, at least.\nIt -- it can intervene, and why shouldn't it have the 60\ndays to decide whether to appeal or not?\nMR. WALL: I guess -- and I -- the same\nanswer I gave earlier, Justice Scalia: That's equally\ntrue virtually in any Federal case that might affect the\nUnited States's interests --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I understand, but this --\nthis goes to your argument about congressional intent:\nThat they were concerned about preserving to the\ngovernment time as a potential appellant to think the\nmatter over. It seems to me that argument is -- is a\nwash.\nMR. WALL: But I think it goes back to what\nJustice Ginsburg asked much earlier, which is: At the\ntime the judgment is entered, who is a party entitled to\ntake the appeal? If the United States has done nothing,\nit's not a potential appellant. When the 30-day period\nruns, the case is over, and the United States, if it\nwants to --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Can the United States\nintervene within those 30 days --\nMR. WALL: It can intervene.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- and then appeal?\nMR. WALL: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I think it's a potential\nappellant.\nMR. WALL: Well, it is -- yes, and it is --\nit is equally true that it is a potential appellant then\nin any case that might affect its interests. But we do\nnot commonly consider the United States a party to every\nclass action settlement or in every government\ncontractor suit simply based on the possibility that it\nmay want to intervene.\nWhen it does so very rarely -- we're talking\nabout -- I mean that is the exceptionally rare case in\nthe False Claims Act, and the government is saying, we\ncan make that decision within the 30 days because we are\nnot a party to the judgment at the time it's entered.\nAnd, again, I think what Petitioner strains to do when\nhe says at page 25 of his reply brief that when you\ndecline as the government, you avoid the burdens of\nparty status. What Petitioner can't explain is why that\nis any different for the burden of appealing an adverse\njudgment and the burdens of discovery. All of those\nrules speak in terms of party status.\nIf Petitioner is able to foist on the\ngovernment a status that it actively attempted to\ndecline, as was its right afforded it by Congress, then\nit seems to me Petitioner can equally try to foist on\nthe government, though it doesn't here, in future cases\nparty status. And this Court will have to decide case\nby case: Is the United States a party for purposes of\neach rule of civil and appellate procedure? And I think\nthat approach threatens much more uncertainty than the\napproach the government is outlining where intervention\nis a simple, workable, administrable test to determine\nwhether the United States is a party to a qui tam suit.\nIf there are no more questions, thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Wall.\nMr. Schor, you have three minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF GIDEON A. SCHOR\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. SCHOR: Thank you.\nI think it begs the question to say that by\nits declination the government is declining party\nstatus. It is declining to conduct the action. That's\na much more limited category than the category of party\nstatus. The government is a party because it is named,\nserved, and bound, and a real party in interest. And I\ndidn't hear any arguments addressing why the\nintervention provision is not determinative of -- of\nparty status in response to --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Why isn't it also a party\nunder all these other rules?\nMR. SCHOR: We -- we -- our position is that\nit -- that it is a party.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Under all of the rules of\ndiscovery?\nMR. SCHOR: Well, again, we think it's a\nparty although for other reasons in the statute that\nit's not subject to full party discovery because of the\ndeclination provision, which I discussed in -- in the\nopening.\nI would also take issue with the assertion\nof Respondent's counsel that it's -- that it's their\nrule that will be the bright-line test. Clearly, it's\nPetitioner's rule. Petitioner says that the government\nis a party in all qui tam actions for purposes of\nFederal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(a)(1)(B). That\nforecloses all of the jurisdictional inquiries.\nIt forecloses the -- the pending case issue.\nIt forecloses the -- the complicated question of when --\nif the government gets a surprisingly bad -- if a\ndistrict court issues a surprisingly adverse judgment\nwhen the government doesn't intervene, the government --\nthe government wants to intervene for purposes of\nappeal. Certainly, first of all, the government -- that\n-- that question of whether to intervene is essentially\nthe question of whether to appeal, and so it should have\n60 days, given the rationale for the rule.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: What do you -- what do you\nsay to the government's argument that they -- it -- it\nmay close these doors that -- that you're saying, but it\nopens a lot of others under other rules? The government\nsays you're just asking for trouble under the -- under\nthe -- a -- an undifferentiated number of other rules if\nwe go your way. What's your response to that?\nMR. SCHOR: I don't think it does. I think\n-- I think the -- an active participation standard would\ncreate far more trouble, far more complexity. It would\nbe almost impossible for relators and defense to -- to\nknow in advance what's -- what's required of them.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's -- that's true, but\nthat's not the point that Justice Souter was making.\nThis is a self-denying position on the part of the\ngovernment. You would expect the government to come in\nand say, yeah, give us 60 days to think this over.\nThey're saying, no, we'll only take 30,\nbecause they're worried if we come out your way on that\nissue, there are other issues on which they're also\ngoing to be considered a party, and it's not worth the\nrisk.\nMR. SCHOR: Well, I think their concern is\nthat -- is discovery primarily, and we have certainly\nput plenty of arguments in our brief as to why that\nconcern is -- is less and there is certainly plenty of\nauthority for -- for thinking that the government won't\nbe subject to discovery.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
