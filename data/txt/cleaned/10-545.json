FALZONE\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. FALZONE: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nSection 514 did something unprecedented in\nAmerican copyright law. It took millions of works out\nof the public domain, where they had remained for\ndecades as the common property of all Americans. That\nviolated the Copyright Clause and the First Amendment.\nLet me turn first to the Copyright Clause.\nIn Eldred, this Court held Congress gets to pick the\ndate on which a copyright expires, and it can extend\nthat date before we reach that date.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You said that Congress\ncan set a time limit. In this case, we're dealing with,\nlet's say, Aaron Copeland, who gets the benefit of\ncopyright, and Congress says: No, we think Shostakovich\nshould be treated just like Copeland. Yes, we took care\nof our own when we weren't part of the world community,\nbut now we are.\nAnd so, all that Congress is doing is giving\nShostakovich works the same limited time as Aaron\nCopeland. And why does that violate the limited-time\nprescription?\nMR. FALZONE: The problem is Congress is now\nsetting a second limit long after the first one has come\nand gone.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But the person -- the\nperson we're talking about, the work we're talking\nabout, never got the first limit. There was no -- there\nwas no time, there was no time when that work could have\nbeen protected. So, why isn't it consistent with the\nCopyright Clause to say, you are entitled to limited\ntime protection? We're not talking about a case where\nyou've had the protection, enjoyed it, and then it\nexpired, and then Congress says we'd like -- we like\nyour work so much we're going to give you another term.\nWhat's affected here are people who were\nunprotected. And Congress says we think that they\nshould have a limited time.\nMR. FALZONE: So, let me just clarify one\nthing. Many of the works that were restored here did\nget some time, 28 years, and were not renewed.\nBut to get back to your question about the\nworks that got none --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: They didn't get the\nequivalent of what a U.S. author -- but let's take the\nlarge category, because it's the ones that you feature.\nYou're talking about Shostakovich, Stravinski, and I\nsay, well, what's wrong with giving them the same time\nthat Aaron Copeland got?\nMR. FALZONE: Congress has been setting the\nlimited time at zero since 1790. In the 1790 Act,\nCongress set the limit at zero for a wide array of\nworks, those that did not comply with formalities, those\nthat were written by foreign authors --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: That's not a limited\ntime. That's saying you have no time.\nMR. FALZONE: Well, but saying you have no\ntime is itself picking the limit because the language of\nthe Copyright Clause forces Congress to pick a limit\nthat constrains copyright by marking its end. And when\n-- if a limit does not mark the end once reached, then\nthere is no limit; there is no end.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But it has to have a\nbeginning, too. And that's -- for these people who were\nunprotected, because we didn't recognize their\ncopyright, there's no beginning.\nMR. FALZONE: No, there does not need to be\na beginning. It is within Congress's discretion.\nRemember, this is permissive. Congress may grant\nexclusive rights, but it can also say your limit is\ngoing to be zero; we decide that you're not going to get\nany exclusive rights.\nAnd every Congress since 1790, every time it\nwent to add subject matter, every time it went to extend\nthe duration of copyright, respected that choice to give\nno time. And, in fact, the time -- the decision to make\nforeign authors ineligible is a decision that Congress\nhas never gone back on. None of the exceptions the\nGovernment points to remove anything from the public\ndomain that was placed there based upon a lack of\nnational eligibility. Two hundred years of history is\ncrystal clear about --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I can understand your\nargument that the public domain is untouchable. I'm not\nsure I get that from the Constitution. That says to\nsecure to authors for a limited time the exclusive\nright. That -- that's talking about what you can secure\nto authors. So, I don't see why using the words of the\nConstitution, to secure to authors for a limited time,\nCongress can't say: We want every author to have a\nlimited time.\nMR. FALZONE: Well --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The foreign works that we\ndidn't give -- we're not treating them any better. They\ndon't get a different startup date, but they get the\nsame end date as our own authors.\nMR. FALZONE: Right. The -- the operative\nlanguage is the limited times restriction, and the limit\nit requires Congress to pick is the date at which all\nprotection ends for good. And Congress has picked zero\nsince 1790 and respected that decision, and that is no\naccident.\nBecause the -- the -- if you want to know\nwhat \"limited times\" means, if it means anything, it\nmeans if -- for instance, if Congress is not required to\nrespect an expiration date long after it's passed or its\ndecision to deny a work any protection in the first\nplace --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: We're not talking about\nexpiration dates. So, I'd like you to concentrate --\nMR. FALZONE: Sure.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: That's not -- that's not\n-- none of these -- none of these copyrights have been\nextended beyond their expiration date. They just\nweren't protected.\nMR. FALZONE: Well, taking works that got no\nprotection, if Congress is not required to respect its\ndecision to deny a work any protection in the first\nplace, we can never know whether we've reached the end\nor not. And, in fact, that's the problem with the\nGovernment's theory. Its theory says all Congress has\nto do is attach a nominal expiration date to any given\ncopyright. Well, if that's true, there is -- if that's\nall you need, there's nothing stopping us --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But is it -- that is --\nthat is not --\nMR. FALZONE: -- from reaching back and\ngiving De Tocqueville a hundred years.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: That is most distinctly\nnot before this case. So, please let's not talk about a\ncopyright that has been protected, has expired, and\nCongress wants to revive it.\nWe are concentrating on what Congress did to\nbring us into compliance with the worldwide system, and\nit's saying: We're giving a limited time to these\nauthors.\nMR. FALZONE: Well --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: They never had a limited\ntime before.\nMR. FALZONE: Well, I -- I was talking -- De\nTocqueville never got any time, because he was a foreign\nauthor. Ben Johnson never got any time, but on the\nGovernment's theory, we could give him a hundred years\nright now.\nThis statute did work differently. It\ncertainly restored copyrights into the existing period.\nThat's correct. That is an accurate description of this\nstatute. But that is not a limit that's contained\nanywhere in the Government's interpretation of limited\ntimes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Did anyone in the same --\nthe same -- published the same year as De Tocqueville, a\nU.S. author, that would have a copyright protection\ntoday?\nMR. FALZONE: I'm sorry. I didn't hear you.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I gave the example of\nAaron Copeland versus Shostakovich. Let's go back to De\nTocqueville. Who has a copyright who published in,\nwhat, 18 -- what was it?\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Forties.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes.\nMR. FALZONE: The answer is nobody. But\nhere is the problem. If Congress wanted to reach that\nwork, here's all it has to do on the Government's theory\nand even under the mechanism of section 514: All it\nneeds to do today is extend existing terms a hundred\nyears, and then reach back and restore into that\nexisting term. So, on the Government's theory and even\nby the mechanism on which this statute operates, the\ngovernment could reach back and protect De Tocqueville.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Under your -- under\nyour theory, let's say you have a copyright that expires\non October 5th, okay? On October 4th, Congress could\nextend that for 25 years.\nMR. FALZONE: Yes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right? But on\nOctober 6th, they couldn't go back and extend it 1 day.\nMR. FALZONE: That's exactly right because\nthe limit the Copyright Clause requires us to pick is an\nend date with permanent consequence. End dates are\nabout finality. If that end date doesn't have permanent\nconsequence, if it doesn't have finality, we can never\nknow if we've reached the end or not. The limit the\nFramers knew was the limit of the Statute of Anne.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But it seems -- but it\nseems to me that that was rejected in our most recent --\nan earlier case on copyright.\nMR. FALZONE: In Eldred?\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes.\nMR. FALZONE: No, no. Eldred said Congress\ncan move the limit back before we reach it. But Eldred\nmost certainly did not say that Congress is free to\nignore the limit once we hit it, because if you can do\nthat, then you never know if you've reached the limit or\nnot. The limit the Framers knew was the one in the --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counselor, there was no\nlimit here, meaning these foreign works were never given\nthe opportunity to be copyrighted. Isn't that a\nsubstantial difference from the hypothetical that you're\ntrying to proffer? You're -- the hypothetical -- and I\nthink that's what Justice Ginsburg was responding to --\nis you had a copyright, it expired, and now Congress\nwants to revive it. Isn't that different from not\nhaving had the opportunity at all and being given a term\nto exploit your work and protect it?\nMR. FALZONE: The answer is no, it's not\ndifferent; and Congress treated those situations exactly\nthe same in all 19 amendments over the span of 200\nyears.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The problem --\nMR. FALZONE: It gave equal respect.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I -- I know, but it\ndidn't do it when it set up the copyright system.\nMR. FALZONE: Oh, it did.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: In 1790, counsel, there\nwere three States that didn't give copyrights. There\nwere other States, and you make a big deal in your brief\nabout common law protection, but common law protection,\nparticularly in New York, which you relied on, only\nextended to unpublished works. Once a work was\npublished, it was no longer protected under the common\nlaw. That was true of most States. And some States\ngave copyright protection to residents of their own\nState but not to residents from other States.\nSo, it took a whole body of public works and\ngave them copyright protection the day they decided to\npass the copyright law. So, what are you doing telling\nus that there has never been a historical experience\nwith Congress taking public works out of the public\ndomain?\nMR. FALZONE: Well, let me be clear about\nwhat happened in 1790. The 1790 Act did not remove\nanything from the public domain. The text is clear,\nbecause insofar as it applied to works already printed,\nit presupposes existing copyrights explicitly in the\ntext of the Act.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Read those words to me.\nMR. FALZONE: So, I'm looking at section 1\nof the 1790 Act, and at the beginning it talks about\n\"after the passing of this act, the author and authors\nof any map, chart, book or books already printed within\nthese United States, being a citizen ... thereof, or\nresident within ... or his or hers executors,\nadministrators or assigns, who hath or have not\ntransferred to any other person the copyright of such\nmap, chart, book or books\" --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Wait a minute. Who have or\nhave not transferred to any other person. So, you don't\nhave to have a copyright.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You just --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Right?\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- well, you have to\nhave a --\nMR. FALZONE: You do have to have a\ncopyright. So, it says \"author or authors\" and \"hath\"\nis the singular, and \"have\" -- \"have not\" is the plural\nfor that.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Read it again. Who have --\nMR. FALZONE: Sure.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- or have not transferred\nto any other person.\nMR. FALZONE: Right. The copyright of such\nmap. It presupposes the existence of a copyright.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Oh. Oh, the copyright. I\ngot you.\nMR. FALZONE: Yes. \"The copyright\" is the\nkey language. So, the text makes it clear they\npresupposed existing copyrights.\nAnd let me speak to --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I -- your reading of\nthat passage is different than mine. I think it's a --\nit's saying if -- whether you have or you haven't.\nMR. FALZONE: But let me speak to the point\nyou raised about common law protection for published\nworks. You said New York provided no common law\nprotection for published works. With respect, that's\nnot correct. The Naxos v. Capitol Records case, highest\ncourt of New York, says New York common law provided\nprotection for published works right up to the point\nwhere the Federal Act cut it off.\nAnd if you look -- and if -- if the question\nis whether the first Congress intended to take anything\nout of the public domain in 1790, the answer is you\nsimply cannot reach that conclusion, because everything\ncontemporaneous with the first Congress, the history of\nthe common law in Britain, decided by Millar v. Taylor\nand Donaldson v. Beckett, recognized common law rights\nin published works. The Federalist Papers spoke about\nMillar, and everything contemporaneous --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: If we disagree with your\nproposition, does your argument fail? If the historical\nwork does not point to what you claim?\nMR. FALZONE: You mean the 1790 Act or the\n19 after it?\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: In 1790. If Congress\ndid what I believe it did --\nMR. FALZONE: No, I --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- would your argument\nfail.\nMR. FALZONE: No, not necessarily, because,\nof course, that was the first Copyright Act, and\nCongress established a baseline. It had to start\nsomewhere. What we see 19 --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It could have started in\nthe place you want Congress to have started now?\nMR. FALZONE: Well, no, but then --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It said, moving forward,\nthere's a Federal copyright. It didn't have to take\nthings out of the public domain. We're arguing about\nwhether they did or didn't. But assuming they did.\nMR. FALZONE: Oh, I will assume they did.\nThey had to start somewhere. They wanted uniformity.\nThey created a statute that provided it.\nWhen you look at every amendment, 19 times\nin 200 years after that, Congress respected the\npermanent consequence of the limits it chose, even when\nthose limits were a work gets no time whatsoever, based\non formality and noncompliance, based upon national\neligibility, based upon expiration of 28 years. It was\nconsistent each time it added subject matter or extended\nterms.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Can you tell me a little\nbit about the phrase and the argument about the public\ndomain? Is, in your view, that just a synonym for when\nthe time has ended? Or is there something more\nsubstantive to it that -- is it your position that the\npublic somehow owns what's in the public domain? I'm --\nMR. FALZONE: Well -- so, to be precise, our\nposition is once Congress calls the limit, that is, once\nit says this work is unprotected, whether it's the\nexpiration of 28 years or a decision to give it no\nprotection, it's creating affirmative rights in every\nmember of the public. Yes, they own it. And this Court\nhas recognized --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But -- but how does the\nphrase -- so, the public domain is simply a conclusion\nto express that, the operation of that principle? The\npublic domain doesn't have any more substantive meaning\nother than to just express the conclusion that there's a\nlimited time?\nMR. FALZONE: Well, it -- in this case, when\nI refer to the public domain, it's the collection of\nthings for which Congress had said protection is done,\nit's over, we've hit the limit, it's done. So things\nthat went --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Once again, it's just a\nconclusion for the argument.\nMR. FALZONE: I think that's the operative\nconcept here. That's right.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I think you gave an\nanalogy to the statute of limitations, and I thought you\nwere quite right about that. You can extend the statute\nof limitations before it's expired, but once it's\nexpired, it's over.\nThe problem with you using that as an\nanalogy is that there was a beginning. Time ran out,\nand you're trying to deal with a situation here where\nyou say, you know, the time was limited for the U.S.\nwork, but it's unlimited, that you -- you cannot treat\nthe foreign work -- you cannot give it a limited time,\nthe same limited time that you would give a U.S. work.\nYou're saying these people had no time, and they may\nnever get time.\nMR. FALZONE: They had no time because\nCongress decided that their works were going to be\nineligible, and a limit of zero is one Congress has been\nsetting since 1790 and respected consistently.\nIf the Chief Justice gives me a limited time\nfor oral argument, I might say no, thanks, I have\nnothing to say.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But it isn't -- it isn't\nquite --\nMR. FALZONE: And we all know I can't come\nback tomorrow.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- quite so because there\nare these examples of the people who couldn't get\ncopyright because of wartime both after -- after both\nWorld War I and World War II, and -- so, those people\nwere allowed to get the protection that they couldn't\nget because of the war.\nMR. FALZONE: That's correct. That's what\nthose statutes did. They were never challenged. And\nmake no mistake, our position is, insofar as they\nremoved anything from the public domain, they are\nunconstitutional.\nBut even if the Court doesn't want to go\nthat far, I think the wartime statutes and the other\nsmall handful of exceptions the Government points to fit\nquite well into a very limited exception for eligible\nauthors who show nothing more than the familiar concept\nof excusable neglect, which has operated -- and, again,\nin very narrow situations -- to relieve people of the\nconsequences of deadlines.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What about new\ncategories? You know, architecture. Congress decides\nwe're going to extend copyright protection to\narchitectural design, and they say: And we're going to\ngo back 5 years. So, any new architectural design\nconceived or constructed, whatever, within the last 5\nyears gets protection, and it goes on for another 15.\nMR. FALZONE: Right. So -- so -- of course,\nto be clear, that's not what Congress actually did when\nit protected architectural works.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, no, I know.\nMR. FALZONE: It looked forward. Right.\nBut that -- so, in that case, the -- the\nFederal scheme, if it had not previously regulated\narchitectural works, it had not -- there had been no\ndecision as to what the limit was going to be. And so,\nyou may pose a different question.\nHere, we're talking about works that were\naffirmatively within the Federal scheme --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, no, I'm just\ntrying to -- I'm trying to test the limit of your public\ndomain --\nMR. FALZONE: Sure.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- argument. Does\nit extend to new categories of copyrightable works?\nMR. FALZONE: I think the answer is the\nretrospective portion of that statute flunks progress of\nscience but -- but passes limited times.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Would you -- would you\nspend a little bit of time on your other argument? I\ntake it to be a separate argument apart from the, you\nknow, time limit argument, the argument that the problem\nhere is that this law does not promote the progress of\nscience and useful arts and, therefore, does not comply\nwith the Copyright Clause. Why doesn't it --\nMR. FALZONE: That's right.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why doesn't it promote the\nprogress of science and the useful arts?\nMR. FALZONE: So, the -- the progress of\nscience corresponds roughly to the creation and spread\nof knowledge and learning. A statute that does nothing,\nlike this one, does nothing but take old works out of\nthe public domain without any impact on prospective\nincentives, cannot stimulate the creation of anything.\nAnd as for things that already exist, it cannot\nstimulate the spread of them. All it can do is restrict\nthe spread of things that could once circulate freely.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You don't think that\nthere are some foreign authors who didn't or wouldn't\ncome into the U.S. market because they couldn't protect\ntheir works here and kept their works in other markets\nthat -- in which it was protected?\nMR. FALZONE: Well, I don't -- I don't --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And it doesn't encourage\nthem to sort of make investments?\nMR. FALZONE: No. Not -- this statute does\nnot and cannot do that, because it --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Why not?\nMR. FALZONE: Because it --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Foreign authors who\ndecided not to exploit their works here wouldn't be\ninduced to think about coming into this market because\nnow they can protect their works?\nMR. FALZONE: Well, whether they came into\nthis market or not has no effect on whether they can\nprotect their works or not. They were unprotected\nwhether they came into this market or not. They would\nbe protected --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You're not answering my\nquestion. You don't think that this law induces those\nforeign authors to come here and promote their work?\nMR. FALZONE: I -- I don't see how it could.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, one way it\ncould, I suppose, is that it shows that Congress is\ninterested in making sure that American authors overseas\nhave reciprocal protection, an issue that could come out\nin a variety of contexts. And if I'm sitting there\nwriting a great novel, I will have the confidence that\nmy government will ensure that I get protection when it\nbecomes a bestseller in China.\nMR. FALZONE: Yes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right? Well, that's\n-- that's an incentive.\nMR. FALZONE: Yes. And you were assured of\nthat incentive in 1988, when we joined the Berne\nConvention without removing anything from the public\ndomain, because when you sit down to write that book\ntoday, that work will absolutely be protected in all of\nthe Berne and WTO countries. So, the incentive effect\nwas achieved and achieved in full in 1988.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, I'm talking\nabout -- but the same issue can come up again, you know,\nwhether it's in the area of formalities or whatever.\nThere may be another problem where there's a dispute\nbetween other countries and our country. And I will\nknow that, in the past, the United States has taken\naction looking out for -- for the interests of American\nauthors.\nMR. FALZONE: That's -- that's --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's an incentive.\nNow, it may be, as I think it was described in a court\nof appeals decision, a \"meager\" incentive. You may be\nmore interested in other protection. But it's -- we\nhaven't really required much more than that.\nMR. FALZONE: Perhaps. I mean, there's\nnothing in -- in the record before Congress here to\nreflect the fact they made any such conclusion.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Let me put it -- I think\nit's the same point -- another way. Let's assume I'm a\nmultibillionaire, and I receive an award as a great\npatron of the arts because I have furthered the arts by\ngiving several million dollars to someone who has\nalready composed an opera or who has already written a\nbook. Wouldn't -- wouldn't I be furthering, be viewed\nas furthering, the arts?\nMR. FALZONE: Potentially, but the problem\nhere, if I can move a little bit to the First Amendment,\nis the mechanism Congress chose to use here. They chose\nto create that reward by taking away core public speech\nrights from the American public and transforming them\ninto somebody's private property.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But that's what the\ncopyright law permits, the -- excluding things from the\npublic domain so long as, in the process of doing it,\nyou're furthering the arts.\nMR. FALZONE: Well -- but let me focus on\nthe First Amendment problem. An ordinary copyright\nstatute does not revoke the public's Federal right to\ncopy and use works in the public domain. That is\nexactly the thing Congress refused to do 19 times over\n200 years. And that's the huge departure from\ntraditional contours of copyright protection that\ntriggers First Amendment scrutiny here. And when you go\nto ask the First Amendment question, you can't ignore\nthe mechanism Congress chose to use here, which is to\ntake away public speech rights and turn them into\nsomebody else's private property.\nThat was the explicit motivation of the\npeople who came before Congress and asked them to pass\nthis statute. That is the justification the\nGovernment --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But now you're saying that\nthere is a substantive component to this public domain\nargument, that the public does own something. And\nthat's different from what I thought you answered\nearlier when you said it's just conclusory for a limited\ntime.\nMR. FALZONE: In that case, I misspoke. The\npublic -- the public domain is owned collectively by the\npublic. And, in fact, decisions of this Court going\nback to the 19th century refer to it as public property.\nAnd I think that --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I'm curious to go back a\nsecond. I thought Justice Sotomayor's question was:\nImagine Smith in Germany. He has written a book. It's\nthere, already exists, but it has no copyright\nprotection in the United States. So, after this, would\nhe be more willing to send it to the United States? And\nI take it your answer is no. The reason is because I\ncan go and buy a copy and sell it in the United States\neven without this law. Is that right or wrong?\nMR. FALZONE: I think -- I think that it\ncould possibly incentivize him to bring a work to the\nUnited States, depending on how the statute worked --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, see, that's what --\n-- isn't that the question? The question is, now that\nSmith has the same protection in the United States that\nGermany gave him, doesn't that give him an incentive to\nsend his book to the U.S.? I'm thinking about that one.\nI thought: Not much, because I can go buy it today\nwithout this law and bring it to the United States and\nsell as many as I want. But nonetheless --\nMR. FALZONE: I think that's right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What is -- that's not\nright?\nMR. FALZONE: No, I think -- I think you're\ncorrect. I think you're correct. I think that's --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, don't just jump on my\nanswer as being correct if it's not.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel --\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. Then the\nanswer --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It might be his\nincentive to buy it or not, but the question is the\nauthor's incentive to sell it here. Those are two\ndifferent incentives. Whether -- you know, he could go\nanywhere and buy a cheaper book if he chose to take the\ntrip or get on the Internet and find it. He could do\nthat now. Copyrighted materials here go at a different\nprice than they do elsewhere. That's not the issue.\nThe issue is the author's incentive.\nMR. FALZONE: The -- the problem here is\nthese authors are long gone. You can't incentivize\nthem. These works are so old they're long gone. You\ncan't incentivize anything that's -- that's happened so\nlong ago. So -- and if you could --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, if you can't\nincentivize them, they're not going to claim their\nrights.\nMR. FALZONE: I'm sorry.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: They're not going to\ncome and claim their rights. Part of this law is that\nthey have to declare that they're interested in\nprotecting their copyright here.\nMR. FALZONE: No. Actually, that's\noptional. It's optional for them to file a notice of\nintent to enforce. It's optional for them to declare.\nBut the real problem is --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Optional for them, but\nonce they do, that's when they can sue a prior user.\nMR. FALZONE: That's right. If -- well, it\ndepends who they want to sue, but yes. That -- they\ncertainly have broader rights once they file the notice\nof intent to enforce. But the --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Of course, the assumption\nof this -- of this line of questioning, I suppose, is\nthat the mere marketing in the United States of stuff\nthat has already been created promotes the progress of\nthe useful arts. I'm not sure it promotes the progress\nof the useful arts. It makes more money for the guy who\nwrote it, but it doesn't incentivize anybody --\nMR. FALZONE: That's right.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- to create art.\nMR. FALZONE: It's not going to incentivize\nanybody to create anything, and it only restricts the\ncirculation of things that once circulated freely.\nIf I can reserve my time for rebuttal, I'd\nlike to do that.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMR. FALZONE: Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: General Verrilli.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD B. VERRILLI, JR.,\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nGENERAL VERRILLI: Mr. Chief Justice, and\nmay it please the Court:\nI'd like to begin by picking up on a point\nthat my friend made in response to Justice Ginsburg\nsuggesting that with respect to foreign works what\nCongress has done is set the copyright term at zero. I\ndon't really think that's a fair description of the\nsituation, and it obscures what Section 514 actually\ndoes and what Congress is all about here.\nSince 1891, Congress has concluded as a\nmatter of copyright law that foreign works are entitled\nto the same protection as domestic works. The problem\nwith respect to the authors that section 514 covers is\nnot that Congress set the copyright limit at zero; is\nthat as a matter of foreign relations, we did not have\ntreaties with these individual countries. And what 514\ndoes is remedy that problem. What 514 says is, with\nrespect to a defined set of foreign authors, they get\nthe remainder of the copyright term that they would\notherwise have gotten, and nothing more, had they lived\nin countries where we had -- with which we had copyright\nrelations at the time they published, or had they\ncomplied with the formalities that we used to enforce\nbut no longer do to perfect and renew copyrights.\nThat's what it does.\nIt doesn't grant anybody a perpetual term.\nIt does not renew a copyright term that has run its full\ncourse and create a new one. It rectifies that problem\nwhich doesn't -- doesn't reflect anything about a\ncongressional judgment setting the copyright term at\nzero for foreign works.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Could Congress grant\ncopyright protection to works that had lost that\nprotection due to the expiration of the period that was\nprovided for under then -- under previous law?\nGENERAL VERRILLI: We think that the --\nthere isn't an ironclad limit that can be derived from\nthe text of the Copyright Clause or from history that\nwould say that Congress is forbidden in any circumstance\nfrom doing that. We do think that there are significant\nlimits in the text of the Copyright Clause that would\nrestrict any ability Congress might have to do that.\nBut one thing I think is important here is that section\n514 is not a statute in which Congress did that, and\nwe'd respectfully suggest that any assessment by this\nCourt of whether Congress had that power should await a\nconcrete context in which Congress exercises it, if it\never does.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What is it that you're\n-- that you're referring to?\nGENERAL VERRILLI: Excuse me, Justice\nSotomayor.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You said there are\nlimits.\nGENERAL VERRILLI: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What --\nGENERAL VERRILLI: Well, one limit I think\nis a quite important one is that the Copyright Clause\nsays that you can only grant copyright in authors, to\nauthors. And as a work gets older and older when you're\ntalking about Shakespeare and Ben Johnson, there really\nat that point isn't an author in which you could vest\nthe copyright. And creating any copyright for a\nlong-expired work like that would really, I think, raise\nthe problem that the Framers were addressing by\nrestricting copyright to authors, which -- which was to\navoid the creation of patronage monopolies in which\npublishers who weren't the authors could claim the\nexclusive rights of copyright.\nJUSTICE ALITO: But doesn't this -- doesn't\nsection 514 provide copyright protection for works that\nwere created by people who are long since dead?\nGENERAL VERRILLI: Yes, it does.\nJUSTICE ALITO: So, I don't understand the\nlimit that you were just suggesting.\nGENERAL VERRILLI: Well, because they --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Do they have to be dead for\nsome period of time before --\nGENERAL VERRILLI: No, but --\nJUSTICE ALITO: -- Congress is unable to\ngive them back their copyright?\nGENERAL VERRILLI: What 514 does, Justice\nAlito, is provide copyright protection to works of\nforeign authors whose works still have copyright\nprotection in their own country, whether they're dead or\nalive. So long as the work has protection in the\ncountry, then 514 provides copyright protection.\nAnd the reason it does so is to ensure our\ncompliance with the Berne Convention. And so, the why\nhere is very important and, I think, provides the answer\nto Justice Scalia's question about how 514 contributes\nto the progress of arts and sciences. What 514 does --\n514 is, in essence, the price of admission to the\ninternational system. We decided, the policymaking\nbranches of our government, the executive and the\nCongress, decided that we needed to be -- and it was in\nthe national interest -- to be part of the international\ncopyright system and to join the Berne Convention to\naccomplish that. The reason we did so was because our\nintellectual property is subject to very serious levels\nof piracy in many foreign countries because of\nunder-enforcement.\nBy joining Berne, what we did was commit\nourselves to the international standards. And by\nenacting Section 514 to implement the Uruguay Round\nAgreements in 1994, what we did was say to the world\nthat we are going to ensure compliance in this country.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: General Verrilli, I do not\nfind that an appealing argument. It seems to me\nCongress either had the power to do this under the\nCopyright Clause or it didn't. I don't think that\npowers that Congress does not have under the\nConstitution can be acquired by simply obtaining the\nagreement of the Senate, the President, and Zimbabwe.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I do not think a treaty can\nexpand the powers of the Federal Government. I mean,\nthis is either okay under the copyright clause or it\nisn't. Now --\nGENERAL VERRILLI: We completely --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- it would be nice to know\nthe reason for it, but you would still have to establish\nthat it's within the power of the Federal Government --\nGENERAL VERRILLI: We completely agreement\nwith that, Justice Scalia.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Okay.\nGENERAL VERRILLI: There's no textual limit\nin the Copyright Clause that would preclude Congress\nfrom enacting this statute.\nThe Petitioners have also raised the First\nAmendment argument. We don't think First Amendment\nscrutiny applies here. To the extent it did, the why\nwould matter there, and there's definitely a substantial\ninterest on the part of Congress in -- in ensuring\ncompliance with Berne and getting protection for our\nworks in Berne.\nNow, in Eldred, the Court did say, I think\nquite clearly, that there is no requirement under the\nCopyright Clause that a new financial benefit granted to\nan existing -- that a new financial benefit cannot be\ngranted to an existing work --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, but it was -- in Eldred\nthe main difference is that in Eldred, there was a law\nthat might, at least in principle, have elicited a new\nbook. And in this case, by definition, there is no\nbenefit given to anything at all that is not already\ncreated.\nGENERAL VERRILLI: I disagree.\nJUSTICE BREYER: By -- how? How does it\ngive any benefit to anything that isn't already created?\nGENERAL VERRILLI: Because it creates\nadditional incentives for authors today and going\nforward, because they know that there's a much greater\nlikelihood that whatever intellectual property they\ncreate will be better protected in foreign countries as\na result of our joining the Berne Convention.\nJUSTICE BREYER: How does this provision do\nthat? I think maybe there are other provisions, but I\nthought this provision is talking solely about books,\nfor example, that are already created.\nGENERAL VERRILLI: Well, but --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Is it not? I may have been\nmisreading, it but I certainly got that out of, like, 42\nbriefs and --\n(Laughter.)\nGENERAL VERRILLI: But we can't -- we can't\nget the protections of Berne -- Berne is not a menu --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Oh, oh. You say --\nGENERAL VERRILLI: -- in which we get to\nchoose options.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well then, you know, as you\nalso know from the 42 briefs, that there's a lot of\nargument that you could comply in other ways that are\nless restrictive. And whether that's true or not, is\nthat -- there what you're saying is -- if I parody it,\nit's not a fair reading I'm going to give -- but what\nyou're saying is we are -- here have a law which says\nthat libraries, music lovers, book buyers will either\npay more money for things already in existence or will\nsimply be unable to get them if they're orphans, on the\none hand, so that other countries will impose similar\nkinds of restrictions upon their music lovers, music\ngoers, libraries and -- so that they pay more for our\nworks that are already in -- that are already produced,\nor simply can't use them because they can't find who\nowns them.\nNow, that's in parody form, for\nsuccinctness, what I think the argument is on the other\nside --\nGENERAL VERRILLI: Right, but --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- and they'll say no\ncopyright law -- with your exception of when the country\nwas founded -- no copyright law has served that kind of\npurpose. That's served often by tariffs --\nGENERAL VERRILLI: But --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- but not by copyright\nlaw.\nGENERAL VERRILLI: But there's another way\nof looking at that, Justice Breyer, of course, which is\nthat the -- but for the fact that these individual\nauthors lived in countries that didn't have copyright\nrelations with the United States, they would have the\nprotection of our copyright law, and they would have the\nterm of copyright --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Not necessarily. There are\nthree categories. One is the category of the people who\nyou couldn't, because of the country; that's Egypt, I\nthink, and Russia. The second is the category of the\npeople -- of sound recordings, and their third is the\ncategory, which is not the null set, of people who did\nnot comply with certain registration requirements. For\nexample, I believe that the widow of Samuel Brittan\nfailed to renew her copyright. And there are probably\nmany that failed to renew the copyright after 28 years,\nand the reason that they didn't is because they didn't\nthink there was much money in it. And those are the\nvery works that the libraries want to get ahold of and\nput in their databases.\nGENERAL VERRILLI: And there is no textual\nlimit in the Copyright Clause that says that Congress\ncannot provide the same limited term to those categories\nof works that it provides to other works. There just is\nno textual limit.\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's true but for one\ntext. They say that text has to do with progress. And\nwhen they read it historically in light of Macaulay, in\nlight of the Statute of Anne, in light of going back to\nVenice and the copyrights, in light of going back to\nletters between Madison and Jefferson -- that term has\nalways meant produce at least one new thing. And here\nthere is not one new thing.\nGENERAL VERRILLI: And -- yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right.\nGENERAL VERRILLI: Yes, there is. First,\nwith respect to section 514, it's part and parcel of\njoining Berne, and Berne gives protection not only to\nthe previously created works but to newly created works,\nand it creates additional economic incentives in\nforeign -- by assuring better protection in foreign\ncountries for newly created works. So, it creates many,\nmany more than one new work.\nAnd I think it's also quite reasonable,\nJustice Breyer, to read the incentive structure here in\na way parallel to the way the Court did in Eldred, which\nis to say that, just as in Eldred the Court assumed that\nthere was an implicit guarantee to an author making a\ncreation that that author would get the benefit not only\nof the existing term of copyright but any extension, I\nthink here, with respect to American authors, it's an\nimplicit guarantee that they get the benefit not only of\nthe foreign protection in existence at the time but any\nexpansion of foreign protection through adjoining\ntreaties, and article 8 -- and section 514 implementing\narticle 18 of Berne is the price of admission to that\ntreaty --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: General, there is\nsomething at least at an intuitive level appealing about\nMr. Falzone's First Amendment argument. One day I can\nperform Shostakovich; Congress does something, the next\nday I can't. Doesn't that present a serious First\nAmendment problem?\nGENERAL VERRILLI: I don't think so, Mr.\nChief Justice, and I do think -- for a host of reasons.\nOne is I think that it's -- it's just not so simple, and\nI think the question that I think Your Honor asked my\nfriend was what about when Congress expands the scope of\nexclusive rights for existing works? Well, Congress has\ndone that many, many times, and musical composition is a\nreally good example of that. In 1831, Congress created\nexclusive right in the publishing and vending of musical\ncompositions, but not in their public performance. So,\nfrom 1831 on, once I bought the sheet music, the public\nperformance was, to borrow the Petitioners' way of\nthinking, in the public domain. You could do it any\ntime you wanted without having to get --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: All right. Well,\nthat's --\nGENERAL VERRILLI: -- a license to pay any\nmoney. But --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's -- one answer\nis that Congress has done this before.\nGENERAL VERRILLI: But then, in 1897,\nCongress granted an exclusive right in the public\nperformance of musical compositions --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right.\nGENERAL VERRILLI: -- and made it applicable\nto all existing copyrights. And so --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay. Well, do you\nhave an argument other than that they've -- they've done\nthis before?\nGENERAL VERRILLI: Well, that they've done\nit many times before, and it's a process -- I think it\nreflects -- and -- and the point is that no one has\nthought with respect to any of those significant\nadjustments of the boundaries, that it was an occasion\nfor First Amendment scrutiny. And I think that's\nbecause of the wisdom of the Court's opinion in Eldred,\nthat these are --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But we have -- but\nit's pertinent under the First Amendment in other areas,\nright? It's a different analysis if your claim is the\ngovernment should open up a park as a public forum, than\nif it's been a public forum for 200 years and the\ngovernment decides to close it down. Maybe they can do\nit, but it's a different question.\nSo, why isn't this a different question,\nfrom whether they can extend copyright protection that's\nalready there?\nGENERAL VERRILLI: I think -- because I\nthink there is -- once the Court gets into the business\nof First Amendment analysis, there's no stopping point,\nbecause all of the adjustments of the boundaries could\nhave the same kind of effect, I think, as the musical\ncomposition example shows.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, what about --\nwhat about Jimi Hendrix, right? He has a distinctive\nrendition of the national anthem, and all of a --\nassuming the national anthem is suddenly entitled to\ncopyright protection that it wasn't before, he can't do\nthat, right?\nGENERAL VERRILLI: What copyright does, by\ndefinition, is provide exclusive rights in expression;\nand so, if the First Amendment is triggered whenever\ncopyright provides exclusive rights in expression that\nit didn't used to provide, then heightened scrutiny will\napply any time Congress exercises its copyright power.\nAnd what the Court said in Eldred --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, he's just out of\nluck? And that's just one example of many, where you\ntake existing works and you have a derivative work or\nsomething that is distinctive to you. So, those people\nare just out of luck?\nGENERAL VERRILLI: Well, of course, under\nsection 514, they're not out of luck because it has\nsignificant protections and accommodations for\nderivative works. The question of whether there should\nbe heightened First Amendment scrutiny, we think, Eldred\nanswers, that -- that the First -- the Copyright Clause\nalready contains very significant accommodations of\nFirst Amendment interests, the idea/expression\ndichotomy, fair use. And -- and that is going to\nprovide -- maybe -- maybe Jimi Hendrix could claim fair\nuse in that situation.\nAnd those are at the core of the traditional\ncontours of copyright. So, if Congress were to try to\nextinguish fair use, I'd say yes, we'd have a First\nAmendment issue there. If Congress were to try to\nprovide exclusive right in the ideas that are expressed,\nas opposed to the expression itself, yes, we'd have a\nFirst Amendment issue there. If Congress were to, say,\nuse the copyright power to engage in viewpoint\ndiscrimination --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, it seems to me what\nyou're saying, and I'm glad you gave this answer because\noriginally I thought I was going to put in my notes the\nFirst Amendment doesn't apply to the copyright area --\nand that just can't be.\nWhat you're saying is, is that this law will\npass intermediate scrutiny. It's an important\ngovernmental interest, and it's substantially related to\nthat.\nGENERAL VERRILLI: We don't think it would\nhave any problem passing intermediate scrutiny, but we\ndon't think --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But -- but --\nGENERAL VERRILLI: -- intermediate scrutiny\nought to apply, Justice Kennedy.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But can you -- can you\ncite me to some -- some authority which says the First\nAmendment doesn't apply to a copyright --\nGENERAL VERRILLI: No. We don't say it\ndoesn't apply, but Eldred --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: The First Amendment test\ndoesn't apply. There has -- there has to be a -- a\ntest. Now, maybe -- say it isn't immediate scrutiny but\nsomething else. But -- but certainly the First\nAmendment is implicated.\nGENERAL VERRILLI: Yes. And what Eldred\nsaid, as I read it, Justice Kennedy, is that unless\nCongress alters their traditional contours of copyright,\nthen rational basis scrutiny, rather than any heightened\nform of First Amendment scrutiny, applies.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Even under -- even\nunder rational basis scrutiny, it seems to me that you\nrun into Justice Breyer's concern that the government\ninterest is vanishingly small when it comes to promoting\nprogress under the Copyright Clause, so that the\ninterest weighed on the other side of the -- the\nrestriction of free speech rights -- it's hard to say\nthat that's necessarily going to tip the balance in\nevery case.\nGENERAL VERRILLI: I think it is going to\ntip the balance, Mr. Chief Justice, because the -- I --\nthe reason Congress enacted section 514, at the urging\nof executive branch officials who were charged with\ntrying to ensure that we could integrate ourselves into\nthe international system of copyright protection, was\nthat if we didn't have this provision, then we were not\ngoing to be taken seriously; our works were not going to\nbe protected in these foreign countries; and that it\nwould defeat the purpose of joining Berne in the first\nplace.\nJUSTICE BREYER: It couldn't have been.\nThat must be somewhat overstated, mustn't it? Because\nthe only concern is not about protecting new works in\nthe foreign countries. The concern, as I understand it,\nwas that we've had things in copyright for many years,\nand we want retroactive protection there. The countries\nthat didn't give it, like Japan, were not kicked out of\nthe Berne Convention.\nRather, we pursued them in the WTO for many\nyears, and I guess somebody might pursue us. And then\nyou get into an argument about whether there are other\nways. Now, is that strong enough to overcome what these\nbriefs are full of?\nI'll give you an example. Save The Music is\ncharged with looking for Jewish music in the periods\n'30s, '40s, and '50s. Other organizations might find a\ntreasure trove of literature that was -- that was\ncopyrighted in Czechoslovakia or in Warsaw, and they\nwant to put it on the Web, and they want people to\nlisten to it. But they have no more idea of how to\ntrack down the person on that, and they aren't protected\nby any notice requirements because they aren't reliance\nparties.\nWe're told by Barbara Ringer, former\nregistrar, that there are millions of such instances\nwhere people would like to go back and would like to put\nmusic, literature, film, et cetera, in a form that\npeople can use it today, and there's no way to do it\nwithout their becoming scofflaws or without their having\nmillions of dollars to hire infinite numbers of trackers\nand lawyers. Now, that's the argument that's made on\nthe other side, as the interest in communication that's\nimportant.\nWhat do you say?\nGENERAL VERRILLI: So, two points: First,\nwith respect to the interest in what foreign countries\nwill do, I think it's incorrect to assume that this will\nbe tit-for-tat, that if we don't enforce article 18, the\nonly thing other countries won't do is enforce article\n18 with respect to our works, as opposed to believing\nthat we're not an -- an effective partner and not\nenforcing their copyright laws for the whole corpus of\nour works.\nSecond, Justice Breyer, that problem that\nyou identified just exists as a feature of copyright\nlaw. Copyright law exists for a certain time. With\nrespect to those works, it's going to create that issue.\nThe problem here is just the result of a fortuity that\nthose works might have been published in a country that\nat the time they were published didn't have copyright\nrelations with the United States. And what section 514\ndoes is address that fortuity by putting those authors\nin the same position they would have been in had their\ncountry had copyright relations with the United States.\nAnd so, I don't think that's a principled objection on a\nconstitutional basis to section 514 --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, here we have ASCAP.\nWe have ASCAP. I agree with you that it is a general\nproblem. It may be diminished in the United States, but\nit still exists. And I guess the argument here is,\nwell, don't make it millions of times worse.\nGENERAL VERRILLI: Well, it doesn't make it\nmillions of times worse. It applies to a small number\nof -- but a significant number of countries --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, what do you --\nBarbara Ringer said a million. She numbers it in the\nmillions. Do you want to say, too?\nGENERAL VERRILLI: No, we don't -- we don't\nhave any reason to doubt the -- the aggregate number.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: That's presupposing that\nthey're all going to give notice.\nGENERAL VERRILLI: Well, with respect to\nreliance parties, that's certainly true. They would\nhave to give notice. It is the case, Justice Ginsburg,\nthat if you're not a reliance party, then there would be\nan infringement even without notice. So, I do think\nthere's something to that point. But, again, I just\nthink that's a result of the fortuity of the countries\nnot having copyright relations with the United States.\nIt's not about the -- it's not anything integral as a\nmatter of constitutional principle of the statute,\nand --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- library, the day this\nlaw was passed, had to go and pick out all the books it\nhad that were subject to copyright and throw them out,\nor do what with them?\nGENERAL VERRILLI: I -- I don't think it had\nto --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Stop them from\ncirculation?\nGENERAL VERRILLI: I don't think it had to\ntake --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm not sure. How did\nthey protect themselves from infringement?\nGENERAL VERRILLI: Yes. I don't think that\nthey had -- I don't think there is an act of\ninfringement by having a library book on the shelf, and,\nof course, there are protections for libraries built\ninto the Copyright Act in all events.\nAnd I do -- if I could in my remaining time,\nI want to go back to the history that we started with,\nbecause I do think it is important that there is no --\nas a matter of text, I think it's clear -- there is no\nunyielding requirement that you cannot restore copyright\nto works in the public domain. I think the history\nreally does bear that out.\nI think Justice Sotomayor had the history\nexactly right, that in 1790, you had three States with\nno copyright statutes. Of the 10 States with copyright\nstatutes, you had 7 that did not provide copyright to\nmaps and charts, which the Federal statute did. And I\nthink this is the key point: Of the States that did\nenact copyright statutes to -- in the 1780s, in advance\nof the 1790 Federal Act, at least four, and depending on\nhow you counted, as many as eight provided copyright\nprotection only to works printed after the date of the\nState statute. They did that at the urging of the\nContinental Congress in 1783.\nSo, I don't think there's any doubt that\nwhen Congress enacted the Copyright Act in 1790, it made\na conscious choice to take a different approach, to\ngrant copyright protection to existing works, including\nmany, many, many works that were freely available for\nexploitation in those States --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Doesn't that show at most\nthat retroactive protection can be granted when there is\nan enormous interest in doing so, namely, the\nestablishment of a uniform copyright system at the\nbeginning of the country? Because if Congress had not\ndone that and had said -- the alternative would be to\nsay things can be copyrighted going forward, then you\nwould have different copyright laws in all of the\nStates.\nGENERAL VERRILLI: I think -- I don't think\nso, Justice Alito. I think they could have followed the\nmodel nationally of prospective copyright only and\nextinguishing the prior copyright --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Right.\nGENERAL VERRILLI: -- and -- but they didn't\nmake that choice. They made a different choice. Now,\nmy friend suggests that the 1790 Act was just a\ntransition. But, of course, the same thing is really\ntrue in an important sense of section 514. It's part of\na tradition -- of a transition of the United States into\nthe international system, which has required an\nadjustment of our rules in order to bring us into\nconformity with the international system.\nAnd beyond the example, of course, of the\n1790 -- and by the way, with respect to that language in\nthe 1790 copyright -- who hath or hath not have\ncopyright -- that's just a rerun of an argument that the\nCourt rejected in Wheaton v. Peters. In Wheaton, the\nCourt said that that language in the 1790 Act was\nreferring to pre-publication common law copyright, not\npost-publication common law copyright.\nBeyond that, it seems to me pretty clear\nthat what that language was referring to -- of course,\nCongress presupposed the existence of copyrights. There\nwere all these State statutes that created some\ncopyrights. But what Congress did was act far more\nbroadly.\nAnd -- so, I do think -- and then when one\nlooks at the examples of patents -- and I think the\nOliver Evans example and that case is an important\nexample. Early in our history, Congress creates a new\npatent term to an expired patent. President Jefferson\nsigns it. Secretary of State Madison issues it. Chief\nJustice Marshall upholds it as a circuit justice, and\nthe Court upholds it against a charge that it's\nimpermissibly burdening people who act in reliance on\nthe expiration of the prior patent.\nThere wasn't a word in this Court's decision\nin that case about any potential constitutional\ninfirmity with doing that. And one would think if this\nwas such a significant and viable principle of\nconstitutional law, that someone would have brought it\nup in those cases. In fact, the striking thing about\nreading the Evans decision is that the Court clearly\nlooks at this all as a matter of legislative policy\njudgment. It says, you know, yes, you're right, it\nmight have been an argument, a good argument in favor of\ncreating some reliance interest here, but that's a\njudgment Congress should have made if anybody was going\nto make it. It didn't -- and there is no reading of the\n-- there's no required reading of that statute that has\nto protect the reliance party.\nSo, I don't -- I just think when you look at\nthe patent protection, when you look at the 1790 Act,\nwhen you consider the fact that when Congress expands\nexclusive rights, as it did for example with respect to\nmusical compositions but did in the 1976 Act with\nrespect to lots of exclusive rights, it does so with\nexisting copyrights.\nAnd all of that points up the wisdom of what\nthis court said in Eldred, that within very wide\nmargins, these are matters for legislative choice.\nThese are policy calls that require the balancing of a\ncomplex set of interests, the drawing of a complex set\nof lines made even more complex by virtue of the fact\nthat we are now trying to make a transition into full\nparticipation in an international system, which is of\nvital importance to protecting one of our most valuable\neconomic exports, intellectual property.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, General.\nMr. Falzone, you have 4 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ANTHONY T. FALZONE\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. FALZONE: Thank you. I have -- I have\nfour points to make: First one, refusing to provide any\nprotection for a work is setting the term at zero. The\npoint of the limited times restriction is it -- excuse\nme -- it forces Congress to tell us when the end has\ncome. And if Congress is forever free to change its\nmind, then we can never know if the end has come.\nPoint number two, this statute does not and\ncannot promote progress, that is, the creation and\nspread of knowledge and learning. When we joined Berne\nin 1988, we got all of its prospective benefits or, as\nthe Government put it, secured the highest available\nlevel of multilateral copyright protection for U.S.\nartists, authors, and their creators. This statute is\nnot about that. It's simply about rewarding people who\nmade things long ago. It's --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: At the time we joined\nBerne, there was an appreciation that we deferred the\narticle 18 issue. There wasn't any -- anyone who said\nthat we satisfied it.\nMR. FALZONE: No. There was an express\nfinding -- explicit finding written into the statute,\nthat -- and Congress found explicitly that we could\ncomply with all Berne obligations without removing\nanything from the public domain.\nNow, third point --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, there were many\npeople who read article 18 in a different way, and\nCongress was later persuaded that that was right.\nMR. FALZONE: Congress never revisited that\nfinding. So, no, they found what they found in 1988,\nand they never revisited it.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: They -- they found that\ncompliance with article 18 was appropriate for us to\nbecome a full member of the international copyright\ncommunity.\nMR. FALZONE: Congress did not make that\nfinding, and I don't think you can even glean that from\nthe testimony that was presented to Congress. The\nproblem here is the -- the right to use works in the\npublic domain has defined the freedom of speech that the\npublic has known since 1790. The 1790 Act made these\nfreedoms clear by placing works unambiguously and\nclearly in the public domain, including all foreign\nworks. So, even since before we had a First Amendment,\nthat has defined the freedom of speech that the public\nknew.\nAnd that right has also made sure that the\ncopyright sequence provides ever-increasing protection\nfor public speech rights. It gives partial protection\nfor some public speech interests during any initial\nperiod of protection, but that blossoms into complete\nprotection for all public speech interests, once we\nreach the limit Congress picks, once they place the work\nin the public domain.\nThe burden on speech that this statute\nimposes is remarkable. Let's start with the performance\nright, which is central to my clients. There can't be\nany doubt, as I think Chief Justice Roberts got at, that\nthe performance has a huge amount of original expression\nbound up in it. It's the reason it's different to see\nKing Lear at the Royal Shakespeare Company; it's the\nreason it's different when John Coltrane plays a jazz\nstandard. Huge amount of expression.\nBut even if you put performances aside, this\nCourt has recognized in case after case that there is a\ncritical speech interest in publishing the work of\nanother author, in showing a film created by another, or\nfor that matter, performing the work of another. So,\nthe -- the burden here is it took speech rights of 250\nmillion Americans and turned them into the private\nproperty of foreign authors, all on the bare possibility\nthat might put more money in the pocket of some U.S.\nauthors.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: All this rides on\naccepting your argument that zero is a limited time.\nMR. FALZONE: No. Not on the First\nAmendment side. Not at all. No, no, no.\nNo. That is -- the First Amendment argument\nis completely independent of that. Even if you find\nCongress could do this on the Copyright Clause, we still\nhave that First Amendment problem, and the -- there is\nno way the Government can pass intermediate scrutiny\nhere.\nThis was not required by Berne. The\nGovernment does not even contend Section 514 was\nrequired by Berne, nor could it, because that would\nviolate Congress's explicit findings they made in 1988.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Would you say it was\nwould required by TRIPS?\nMR. FALZONE: No. Because TRIPS just\nimplements Berne. So that the problem here is this\nstatute was not passed --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Is it not so that if we\ndon't comply with Berne 18, then we are subject to being\nsanctioned by some World Trade Organization --\nMR. FALZONE: There was very vague testimony\nabout the unsupported possibility that could happen, and\nthat's why the Government falls back on this interest of\navoiding a dispute.\nHere is the problem: If the government can\nget around First Amendment limits by signing a treaty,\nand then the flexibility to take away public speech\nrights is defined by some complaint proffered by some\ntreaty partner, then the First Amendment is defined only\nby the perceptions, the complaints, and, frankly, the\nimagination of foreign countries. That can't be the way\nit works.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nCounsel.\n"
