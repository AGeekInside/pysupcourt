GORDON\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. GORDON: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nWhen this Court construes a statute, the\nwords of the statute matter, the purpose of the statute\nmatters, and the results produced by that construction\nmatter.\nWhen Congress defined in the Armed Career\nCriminal Act a \"serious\" drug offense as one for which a\nState penalty of 10 years or more is prescribed by law,\nit meant for Federal courts to look to the law presently\nin effect in that State. This is the most natural\nreading of the statute, and words matter. It is also\nconsistent with ACCA's purpose, which is punish the\nFederal firearms offense, and if we are going to\npunish -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, I -- I have\njust one problem, which is under your theory, I\nunderstand it, if a State increases a penalty, makes\nwhat would have been a penalty for a misdemeanor now a\nfelony, then that defendant is a career criminal, by\nyour logic.\nMR. GORDON: Uh -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So the person who\nthought that at the time they committed the crime they\nwere committing a low-level crime is now a felon; is\nthat your theory of the case?\nMR. GORDON: If -- if a State were to\nincrease a penalty -- say from originally it was 5\nyears, increased it to 10 years, the defendant was\nconvicted at a time when it was 5 years -- if the\nlegislature increased the penalty, if the defendant\npossessed a firearm, yes, he would be facing -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What -- what -- what\nlogic do you think there is in that, why Congress would\nwant to punish someone now for -- for criminal activity\nthat they thought was lesser, and the State thought was\nlesser, at an earlier time, less reprehensible?\nMR. GORDON: Because the purpose of the\nArmed Career Criminal Act is not to enhance a sentence\nbecause of the prior conviction. It is because the\nFederal firearm offense at the time it was committed is\nmore serious based on -- based on its repetitive nature,\nas this Court has said. So therefore looking to, when\nthe defendant commits the offense, what his status is at\nthat time under the law we think makes sense and is\nconsonant with the purpose of what ACCA is trying to do.\nACCA is not trying to punish the State offense at the\ntime.\nAnd of course the converse, Your Honor, is\nthat by adopting the government's reading, is\nindividuals who at a time committed an offense when a\nState at that time viewed an offense as more serious but\nnow has changed its view of the offense, does not view\nit as being as serious, that person also would receive a\n15-year mandatory minimum sentence.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Gordon, the State\ndoes regard it -- it does -- prescribe 10 years for this\ndefendant because it's made a -- made the change not\nretroactive. So a maximum of 10 years is prescribed for\nMr. McNeill, and all others who committed the offense\nprior to the change in law. So it is -- it is the\nState's current position that for this offense the\nmaximum is 10 years.\nMR. GORDON: Yes, Justice Ginsburg, that's\ncorrect. Where we fundamentally disagree with the\ngovernment and with the Fourth Circuit is on the\nsignificance of retroactivity. We -- the statute\nrequires -- or the statute directs us to look at the\npenalty that is prescribed for the offense, the offense\nin its generic context. It -- it is not about what the\ncircumstances of the defendant were that produced the\nparticular conviction for him.\nNo one who commits the trafficking offenses\nthat Mr. McNeill committed today is going to be facing a\n10-year sentence. It's not going to happen to anyone\nwho commits the offense from today forward. And we\nthink that is where the statute directs us to look:\nWhat is the penalty for the generic offense?\nJUSTICE ALITO: Suppose -- what would happen\nin this situation? A defendant is convicted under a\nState statute that says that anybody who sells between 1\nounces -- 1 ounce and 5 ounces of a particular\ncontrolled substance is guilty of a felony and may be\npunished by imprisonment for a certain amount of time.\nAnd then the State repeals that provision\naltogether and enacts a new provision that says anybody\nwho sells between 1 ounces -- 1 ounce and 8 ounces is\npunishable by a certain penalty. And now the question\ncomes up what -- what penalty does the court look at\nwith respect to the earlier offense that no longer\nexists for which the defendant was convicted?\nMR. GORDON: There -- there are two possible\nanswers, Justice Alito. First, the court could look to\nwhat the offense is now, could look back to what the\ndefendant did consistent with Shepard and so forth, and\nsee if the defendant's conviction contains the element\nof the -- the elements that apply to the present\noffense.\nIf the court could not do that, then the\nconviction would count for purposes of the defendant's\ncriminal history. It would not count as an ACCA\npredicate, and the district court would then be limited\nto a 10-year sentence as opposed to a 15-to-life\nsentence.\nSo consistent with -- with its purpose, we\nthink that the statute should be read as speaking to the\ntime, not of the State conviction -- not of the State\nsentence.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mis -\nMR. GORDON: Yes?\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Gordon, is this -- is\nthis essentially an academic question? Because this\ndistrict judge said that he would impose the same\nsentence as a variant even if he couldn't do it under\nthe guidelines, even if it were an incorrect\ncalculation. He said: This criminal record is violent\nand astonishing; essentially, I'm going to throw the\nbook at him, and I'm going to do it through a variant if\nthat's no -- if there's no other way.\nSo isn't that -- I mean, isn't this an -- an\nexercise, essentially an academic exercise, if -- if\nyour -- your client would end up in the same place?\nMR. GORDON: Well, Justice Ginsburg, it may\nbe an academic exercise for Mr. McNeill or for the Mr.\nMcNeills of the world. The judge would -- if this Court\nwere to agree with us, the judge could impose\nconsecutive sentences on a remand and still achieve the\nsame sentence, yes.\nFor someone whose only offense, however, is\na 922(g) conviction, then it makes a huge difference\nbecause, rather than looking at a 15-year mandatory\nminimum penalty, the defendant would be looking at no\nmore than 10 years. So, the judge's -- it would be\nsignificantly cabined in -- in that sense.\nAnd the other, with respect to the Mr.\nMcNeills of the world, the judge on a remand is still\ngoing to be required to calculate the guidelines\ncorrectly. And so if the guidelines change, if they go\ndown in this case, for the judge to achieve a 300-month\nsentence, the judge is going to have to state reasons\nagain and arguably more significant reasons to -- to\nachieve that same level if he's working from a lower\nguideline range.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Gordon, there are other\nprovisions in ACCA which seem to use the present tense\nin circumstances where it doesn't seem as though the\nstatute truly means the present tense. So, a violent\nfelony is one that \"has as an element the use of\nphysical force, is burglary, arson, or extortion,\ninvolves use of explosives;\" and so on and so forth.\nBut we would not look as to -- in interpreting that\nprovision to the present day, would we?\nMR. GORDON: Justice Kagan, I think you\nwould, in this sense: For the violent felony provision,\nthere is a generic offense. Let's take burglary. There\nis this existing thing right now called burglary. What\na Taylor analysis does is it looks backward to what the\ndefendant did. It looks to see what those elements are.\nIt takes those elements and brings it forward, and if\nthose elements fit in the box, then what he did is a\nburglary. If it does not, then it is not a burglary.\nThe -- so, that's my essential answer to that. Is it -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why is -- why is -- why is\nthe present tense inadequate for the -- for the\ngovernment's position in this case? Once it is conceded\nthat the North Carolina law is not retroactive, the law\nreducing the number of years, it is the case that what\nis the maximum term of imprisonment for the offense that\nhe committed -- how many years ago was it, whatever -\nMR. GORDON: Early '90s, Your Honor. Yes,\n'91, '92.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What is the maximum\npunishment for that offense which occurred at that time\nis the longer period. Why is -- I don't see why your\nargument requires us to ask what would be the term if he\nhad committed the offense at a later date. The maximum\nterm for his offense when he committed it is those years\nbecause the State did not retroactively reduce his\nsentence.\nMR. GORDON: That's correct for Mr. McNeill.\nThe penalty for him -- he would be facing an exposure of\n10 years. The penalty, however, that everyone else -\nthe penalty that is currently prescribed in North\nCarolina for someone who commits McNeill's offenses is\nnot 10 years and, and depending on where they fall in\nthe prior record level, their maximum sentence is\nconsiderably less than 10 years.\nSo we do not think it's consonant with the\nstatute to look to the circumstances of the individual\ndefendant. Congress easily could have said \"for which a\npenalty of 10 years or more is prescribed for the\ndefendant.\" We think that would be a different case.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's not just for the\ndefendant; it's for anybody who committed it prior to\nthe -- prior to the amendment of the statute.\nMR. GORDON: That's correct.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Anybody that committed it\nthen, the -- the -- it is an offense \"involving\nmanufacturing, distributing, or possessing with intent\nto manufacture or distribute a controlled...for which a\nmaximum term of imprisonment of 10 years or more is\nprescribed by law.\" It is prescribed by law for any of\nthose offenses that occurred between whenever that old\nstatute was enacted and whenever this statute was\nenacted.\nMR. GORDON: It is prescribed only if you\ntake the offense out of the category of a generic\noffense. It is not -- it is -- it is not prescribed for\nthe generic offense. It is prescribed for particular\ndefendants who committed the offense at a certain point\nin time.\nAnd, Justice Scalia, I think it raises a\nrather fundamental question, which is if we're going -\nif we really are punishing the Federal firearm offense\nand we are not punishing the defendant for the prior\nconviction, and we have two individuals who commit a\n922(g) offense and they have similar records, but they\nsustain their State convictions on different days, do we\nwant to treat them the same for purposes of where they\n-- of the Federal offense or do we want to distinguish\nthem on the basis of the State convictions? Do we want\nthe State convictions to really -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if the State -\nMR. GORDON: Yes, sir.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if the State\nchange is to abolish the offense altogether? Do we -\ndo we not have any predicate offense for the defendant\nwho committed the crime prior to the abolition of the\nState offense?\nMR. GORDON: Your Honor, yes. If -- if, as\nI said earlier, you could not determine from the prior\nconviction whether there is any present State offense\nthat might be called something different, but that has\nthose drug trafficking elements that the statute\nrequires, if you cannot determine, you know, from\nShepard-approved documents and so forth, yes, we think\nfor purposes of the armed career criminal enhancement\nonly that that would disappear. That's correct.\nI do want to stress, because I think it's\nimportant to stress, that -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. That's -\nMR. GORDON: Yes?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's correct? You're\nhappy with that? The person committed a felony when it\nwas a felony, and the State later no longer makes it a\nfelony, and it isn't counted for purposes of the Armed\nCareer Criminal Act?\nMR. GORDON: Only for purposes of the Armed\nCareer Criminal Act, yes. It certainly would count as a\nprior conviction. It would count as a prior conviction,\nfor example, for 922(g) purposes. This person could\nstill be prosecuted for being a felon in possession,\nyes.\nSo, we do not -- our reading is not opening\nthe jail house door for anybody. They are still facing\na hefty 10-year sentence. The question is, in a statute\nthat defers to the judgment of the States to determine\nseriousness, are we going to defer to the current State\nassessment of what seriousness is or are we going to\nlook back to repeal the discarded judgments?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but it strikes\nme that there's really no change in the State view of\nhow serious it is. It was just an overall change in how\nthey're going to look at sentencing. Under the prior\nregime, you're sentenced to a particular term, but in\nfact you serve a lot less. With the new treatment in\nsentencing, you're sentenced to what is a much -- a\nsmaller term, but you in fact are going to serve the\nwhole thing. At the end of the day, there's no real\nchange in how they view the seriousness of the offense.\nMR. GORDON: That's correct, Mr. Chief\nJustice, arguably yes. But for purposes of the serious\ndrug offense definition, what we have to use is the\npenalty. We have to look at the penalty as the State -\nas the State's proxy, if you will, for seriousness.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Are we looking at it\nbecause we want the States to determine the Federal\nsentence or are we looking at it because we evaluate the\nevil of the particular defendant on the basis of how -\nhow much of a crime he was willing to commit?\nAnd so long as it was a serious felony when\nhe committed it, this is a bad actor. I don't care if\nthe State changes its view. At the time, he was willing\nto commit a felony that put him in jail for 10 years,\nand that's what we're looking to, it seems to me, how\nbad an apple is this fellow that -- that we're talking\nabout putting away? And that doesn't change simply\nbecause the State decides in the future that that same\nact will not be a felony. Well, people who perform that\nact in the future aren't so bad; they're just -- you\nknow, just normal not-so-good people -\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- but they're not the kind\nof a person who's willing to -- to commit a felony that,\nyou know, puts them away for 10 years.\nIt seems to me that that's what the Federal\nlaw is looking to. We're not giving over to the States\nthe decision of -- of how long we should incarcerate\nsomebody in a Federal prison.\nMR. GORDON: Justice Scalia, if -- if that\nwere indeed what Congress wanted, then it would have\nwritten the statute differently. There would be\nsomething in that definition about the defendant, and\nthere's not. It's about the offense. So the -- the\njudgment that the State is making is about the\nseriousness of the offense itself, and as we made an\neffort to argue in our briefs, State views of drug\noffenses change.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I agree, it does refer to\nthe seriousness of the offense. But it refers to the\nseriousness of the offense at the time the offense was\ncommitted in order to determine how bad a fellow this\nis, not -- not because we want the States to determine\nhow long we're going to keep Federal prisoners in\nprison.\nMR. GORDON: Justice Scalia, respectfully,\nI -- I don't agree with that. Respectfully -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's the issue, though,\nreally.\nMR. GORDON: That is an issue, yes, Justice\nScalia. But the issue is, do you look at the defendant.\nDo you say Congress was really talking about trying to\nget the Mr. McNeills any way we can or we are -- we are\ninterested in people who commit an offense that the\nState currently regards as serious.\nYou will capture Mr. McNeills; you will also\ncapture people who, you know, under the old Texas law\nthat, you know, prescribed 99 years for someone who\nmight have sold one or two marijuana cigarettes as well.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But you'll -- you'll put\naway for a long time somebody who really wasn't that bad\na guy. He committed a misdemeanor, and when the State\nlater makes it a felony, you -- he suddenly comes under\nACCA. And I -- I can't believe that that's -- that's\nwhat -- what Congress had in mind just because the State\nnow thinks that it's more serious. Who cares what the\nState thinks? We -- we want to know how bad an actor\nthis particular defendant is.\nMR. GORDON: In the case of a misdemeanor --\nJustice Sotomayor asked earlier about misdemeanors and\nfelonies -- there may be some additional constitutional\nissues in terms of whether if it's a misdemeanor\nconviction, even statutory reasons, if it's a\nmisdemeanor conviction, whether it should count. I\nthink it works that way in the violent felony prong, for\nexample, where the term that you look at is was it 1\nyear.\nBut that is -- that is not the proxy for\nseriousness because there is another provision, 18\nU.S.C. section 921(a)(20), that exempts 2-year\nmisdemeanors. So -- so, the 1 year in the violent\nfelony provision is not serving the same purpose that -\nthat the 10 years is in the serious drug offense.\nA reason that Congress may have had for\ndoing that is to say that if we are going to hit\nsomebody with 15 years, we want to make sure that they\nhad their constitutional rights at the time they\nsustained the predicate conviction, had a right to\ncounsel, indictment, jury, and so forth.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I'm -- I'm not sure what\nyou're urging now. Are -- are you modifying or\nretracting the answer you gave to Justice Sotomayor,\nthat is, the case where the maximum was 5 years, but\nthen at the time of the Federal offense the State has\nchanged it so it's 10 years?\nI -- I think you answered her question that\nit would work the same way, that what mattered is how\nthe State currently ranks the offense, not the offender.\nBut now you seem to be saying there might be a different\nanswer when the State increases rather than decreases\nthe penalty.\nMR. GORDON: What -- what I meant to say,\nJustice Ginsburg, is that if you are -- if you continue\nto be talking about a felony offense, if it goes from\n5 years to 10 years, it went from a felony to another\nfelony, in that circumstance I -- I -- I will concede\nour reading of the statute would work to the detriment\nof that defendant, that -- that's correct.\nWhat I was simply trying to say about the\nmisdemeanor-felony is that there might be some\nadditional constitutional issues that would not be\npresent in -- if it went from 5 years to 10 years.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: In -- in the hypothetical\nwhere the penalty is increased, would there be an ex\npost facto problem?\nMR. GORDON: Your Honor, I don't believe\nthere would be. The defendant presumptively is on\nnotice that the law has changed.\nNow, if -- if the increase in the penalty\nwere between the time that he commits the 922(g) offense\nand the time of the sentencing, yes, I think you have ex\npost facto concerns there. I think if you're talking\nabout between the time of the State offense and the time\nof the commission of the firearm offense, I don't think\nit raises the ex post facto concerns. Again, the\ndefendant is on notice, he's presumed to know what the\nlaw is at the time he commits the Federal offense, and\nthat's what we care about here.\nI -- I would also like to return to the\nquestion of retroactivity for just a moment and note\nthat in terms of the administerability of the Armed\nCareer Criminal Act, the question of retroactivity would\nintroduce, if the government's reading is adopted,\nproblems that do not exist under reading ACCA speaking\nin the present tense. Under the government's approach,\nit is not simply that you can look at what the sentence\nwas that the defendant received in State court. The\ngovernment says retroactivity matters.\nSo you would still have to go to the present\npenalty, and then you would have to conduct an inquiry\ninto what the, you know, what changes occurred in the\nlaw, were any of them retroactive, were they retroactive\nfor a certain period of time, et cetera. So, it -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sorry, how do you\nsee that? I thought the government had two alternative\npositions, the first being that you look at the time -\nat the time of the offense, at the conviction or,\nalternatively, it was arguing the way to take the\nposition of the court below. But if you're going to use\nthe present tense then you look retroactively to see -\nthen you look to see whether the State would\nretroactively apply the new sentence.\nMR. GORDON: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You understood their\nbrief differently?\nMR. GORDON: Your Honor, I read the brief\ndifferently? If -- and if my reading is incorrect, I\napologize.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sure they'll tell\nyou.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. GORDON: Yes, I'm sure they will.\nIf there are no further questions, I would\nlike to reserve the balance of my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Gordon.\nMr. Gannon.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF CURTIS E. GANNON\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. GANNON: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nPetitioner was convicted under North\nCarolina law of multiple offenses subject to a 10-year\nmaximum term of imprisonment, and he actually received\n10-year sentences for his drug crimes. He now claims\nthat those convictions are not ones for which the\nmaximum term of imprisonment is at least 10 years for\npurposes of ACCA's definition of serious drug offense.\nThat result is incorrect, because the\nsentencing court should consider the offense and the\npunishment as they were defined by the body of law under\nwhich the defendant was convicted and sentenced.\nThis is the simplest approach, because the\nCourt is already looking to the statute at the time of\nthe underlying conviction in order to evaluate whether\nit satisfies the substantive component of the definition\nof a serious drug offense. And if I can start where\nJustice Sotomayor finished with my friend, we have one\nfootnote in the first part of our argument, footnote 5,\nwhich clarifies an issue that isn't at stake here, which\nis that when we say that you need to look to the time of\nthe underlying conviction, that that includes the time\nof the sentencing which could include some sentence\nmodification proceedings.\nIf the State had amended the law in the\nmeantime, made it retroactively applicable and the\ndefendant were able to get his judgment or conviction\nmodified, then we would not insist that -- that he still\nhad an offense that was subject to a 10-year maximum\nterm of imprisonment. And we think that this approach\nis consistent with what the Court said in Rodriguez,\nwhere it was also evaluating the serious drug offense\nunder ACCA and pointed us to the documents associated\nwith the judgment of conviction.\nIt recognizes that the relevant question\nhere is the body of law that applied to this particular\ndefendant in his offense. And -- and it's the term\n\"conviction\" that actually points us to that in the\nstatute. The question is what is the sentencing regime\nassociated with the defendant's actual conviction, and\nthe government's -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could I -- just to\nclarify your point. If there's been a modification of\nlaw that would have entitled him to a retroactive change\nin his sentence, although I'm not quite sure how that\nworks, because if there's a modification, I thought it\nwould only apply to a defendant who had committed the\ncrime at that earlier time but was convicted at the\npresent time. This defendant wouldn't have his sentence\nmodified.\nMR. GANNON: Well, I think that this would\nbe a highly extraordinary circumstance. There may be an\ninstance where the State legislature has actually\namended the law, made it retroactive and said that it's\napplicable to people who had final convictions\nbeforehand I -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, that's my\nquestion. Is your footnote related to that kind of\nindividual only or are you saying -- or are you\naccepting your adversary's argument that the circuit\nbelow got it right? You look at the is as to what the\nsentence would be today -\nMR. GANNON: The footnote -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- if this person had\ncommitted the crime?\nMR. GANNON: The footnote in part A of the\ngovernment's brief is -- is not consistent with the\ncourt of appeals approach. We're saying that under our\nprincipal reading which is at the relevant time, at the\ntime of the conviction, that that includes the\nsentencing associated with that conviction; and in\ncertain unusual circumstances that may well include a\nsentence modification proceeding that occurred sometime\nafter the fact. But in any event it's going to be a\nprevious conviction that needs to be on the books at the\ntime of the 922(g) offense.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm just trying to\nclarify whether you mean that the -- the modification\nhad to have occurred, meaning that he was convicted, he\ngot 10 years, and somewhere for some State reason, that\nactual final judgment was amended to include 5.\nMR. GANNON: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Are or are you talking\nabout -\nMR. GANNON: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- accepting his\nargument that if he could apply for a change now -\nMR. GANNON: It -- in -- we think that it\nhas to be under the documents associated with his\njudgment of conviction. So it would matter that he had\nbeen successfully able to obtain modification of the -\nthe judgment associated with his conviction. In those\ncircumstances it would be appropriate to say that the\nbody of law that applied to his conviction was one that\nspecified only the lower punishment.\nThat's obviously not an issue here because\nthe State hasn't made any of these relevant changes\nretroactively applicable to any offense that was\ncommitted before the first of October in 1994.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Is this the first time\nyou're advancing the argument, the first part of your\nargument?\nMR. GANNON: It -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It doesn't appear as you\ndid -- if you did it below; am I correct?\nMR. GANNON: We -- we did not advance this\nbelow. We weren't heard on the question at district\ncourt. The district judge adopted this argument in\nresponse to Petitioner's objection to the PSR which had\ntaken this position. In the court of appeals,\nPetitioner relied upon the Sixth Circuit's decision in\nMorton, and we -- we responded the essentially the way\nthe Fourth Circuit did, which is to say the Fifth\nCircuit has distinguished instances like that when the\ncourt has not -- when the State has not made the -- the\nintervening decrease in the sentence retroactively\napplicable. That's the interpretation that the Fourth\nCircuit adopted.\nBut the government has made this argument\nbefore in -- in the Second Circuit in Darden, in the\nFifth Circuit in Hinojosa, in the -- in the Sixth\nCircuit in Morton in the 1994 decision. The government\nhas made this lead argument that we're making today in\naddition to the fallback argument that the -- that the\nFourth Circuit adopted here, and that the Fifth Circuit\nadopted in -- in Hinojosa.\nBut I would note that the lead argument that\nwe're making today has several advantages that make it\npreferable to the fallback argument. Some of them have\nalready been brought up today. I already mentioned the\nfact that this is simpler, because it requires the judge\nto just look to one time to evaluate the substantive\ncomponent of the definition and the -- the sentence\ncomponent of the definition.\nBut this also prevents the types of problems\nthat Justice Alito addressed earlier that may arise when\nthe State has amended the definition of the offense. If\nyou just look to the -- the actual offense at the time\nof the conviction, then you don't run into those sorts\nof problems, and the Fifth Circuit recognized this in\nits Allen decision and therefore ended up having to\nadopt what is essentially the government's lead argument\nhere.\nThe Sixth Circuit which generally follows\nPetitioner's rule also ended up adopting the\ngovernment's lead argument in the context of a\nguidelines determination, because it recognized that it\n-- it was unwilling to assume that a conviction simply\ndisappears when the State has modified the definitions\nin such a way that you can't precisely translate into\ncurrent terms what the underlying offense of conviction\nis.\nThe government's reading avoids that problem\nbecause it doesn't require you to recharacterize the old\noffense at all. It just says what was he convicted of?\nWhat was the maximum sentence associated with that\noffense at the time he was actually prosecuted? There's\nnothing hypothetical about it. And as the -- as the\nCourt pointed out in Rodriguez, we would expect a lot of\nthe documents association with a judgment of conviction\nto make this a relatively easy inquiry to answer what\nwas the maximum sentence at the relevant time.\nThis -- the reading also avoids the\ndifficulty that Justice Sotomayor pointed out that -\nthat is associated with later increases in -- in the\nsentence. Under the government's view, if you committed\nan offense at a time when it was subject to a 10-year\npunishment, Congress has reasonably assumed that you are\na dangerous person; but that Congress could also\nreasonably assume that there's a distinction between\nsomebody who commits an offense at a time when it's\nsubject to a 10-year term of imprisonment and someone\nelse who commits that offense at a different time when\nit's subject to only a 30-month term of imprisonment.\nAnd so under North Carolina law, for instance, the -\nthe felony of manufacture of methamphetamine went from\nbeing a class H felony which is subject to a 30-year\nmaximum term of imprisonment to being a class C felony\n-- excuse me, a 30-month maximum term of imprisonment,\nto a class C felony, which is subject to a 19-year\nmaximum term of imprisonment on December 1st, 2004. And\nwe think it's reasonable for Congress to assume that\nsomebody who committed the crime of manufacturing\nmethamphetamine in North Carolina at a time when it was\nsubject to a 30-month maximum sentence is not as\ndangerous as somebody who was willing to commit the same\noffense at a time when it was subject to a 19-year\nmaximum term of imprisonment.\nAnd the government's approach by -- by\nrequiring the court to look to the time of the\nunderlying conviction and sentencing unifies the inquiry\nacross both components of the definition of serious drug\noffense and the definition of violent felony that\nJustice Kagan alluded to in the earlier part of the\nargument, that the definition of violent felony includes\npresent-tense references to whether a crime is burglary,\nthe question of whether it is punishable by a -- by a\nterm exceeding 12 months, which is necessary to\nestablish that it's a felony is one that -- that we\nbelieve needs to be made at the time of the underlying\nconviction.\nJUSTICE ALITO: What if the legislature\ndecreases the penalty because it really has taken a\ndifferent -- a new look at the nature of the offense and\nhas come to the conclusion that this really is not\nnearly as serious as we -- as we previously thought? So\nwhy should the prior judgment about the severity of the\noffense be taken into account under ACCA?\nMR. GANNON: Well, Congress has given us a\nvery objective and simple yardstick to look to and\nthat's just what the maximum term of imprisonment is.\nAnd if -- if the State actually thinks that the previous\noffenses that were committed were less serious, then it\ncould make the decreased maximum term of imprisonment\nretroactively applicable if -- if it wanted to\ndemonstrate that -- that it really thought that those\nwere mistakes. But that's not the approach that South\nCarolina has taken -- that North Carolina has taken\nhere.\nIt has said that for crimes that were\ncommitted before October 1st, 1994, the prior sentencing\nregime still applies. And as the Chief Justice pointed\nout before, the State has not repudiated the judgment\nthat these were serious offenses, not -- not -- not only\nwith respect to when they were committed, but the entire\nshift to structured sentencing Petitioner\nacknowledges -\nJUSTICE ALITO: But what if -\nMR. GANNON: -- wasn't intended -\nJUSTICE ALITO: What if they had repudiated\ntheir prior normative judgment? And -- and even -- what\nif they even had made it -- made the new sentence\nretroactive, but a particular defendant was no longer in\nprison, so wasn't on parole, so there was nothing -\nthere was no way that this could have any effect on that\nperson?\nMR. GANNON: Well, it's possible that the\nState could -- could provide a mechanism by which he\ncould have the documents associated with his prior\njudgment amended to reflect the fact that he -- he ought\nnot to have been subjected to the -- to the greater term\nof imprisonment.\nI think that that's probably the hardest\ncase, somebody who once upon a time actually, like this\nPetitioner, did a 10-year term of imprisonment for -\nfor the sentence, the State in retrospect concludes that\nthe offense had not been that serious even at the time,\nand if he had been prosecuted today he -- he should have\nreceived only a 5-year maximum term of imprisonment.\nI think -- I think that that's -- that's an\ninstance where it -- it might be difficult to -- to -\nto find a way in the statute to say that ACCA doesn't\napply to him, that he did not have a previous conviction\nat the relevant point in time.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I'm not sure it's so hard.\nI -- I could find my way clear to saying that if it has\nbeen retroactively made a -- a -- a lesser offense, that\nthat would qualify under -- under the statute. I don't\nknow why you insist that his actual conviction be -- be\naltered.\nMR. GANNON: Well, I -- I think that we\nwould obviously still prevail under an approach like\nthat. It would be an expansion of what we proposed in\nfootnote 5. We think that the relevant inquiry starts\nwith the conviction, but if -- if the court were to ask\nin the context of the body of law that applies to his\noffensive conviction, whether the State has changed its\nmind by doing -- by altering the precise yardstick that\nCongress has directed the court to look to, then -- then\nI think that -- that that would be an appropriate way to\ndeal with it.\nI'm not exactly sure how you get it out of\nthe words of the statute, but it -- it would solve the\nproblem for -- for cases like this of somebody who had\nbeen unable to take advantage of a sentence modification\ntype of proceeding.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Can you tell us whether\nchanges in State sentences -- do the States routinely\naddress retroactivity? Or do they leave it to their\ngeneral common law? Or do you have any idea of what -\nMR. GANNON: Several States have specific\nsaving statutes like the Federal Government does in\n1 U.S.C. 109. At least three States have constitutional\nprovisions that effectively are something like a saving\nstatute. Sometimes they have background common law\nprinciples.\nIn any instance, these types of general\nprovisions, except where the constitutional provisions\nexist, could be overcome by the State legislature in a\nparticular statute, just as is the case with the Federal\nsavings statute. A State legislature, if it wants to be\nexpress about the retroactive applicability of a change,\nwould be able to do that.\nThere may be limitations under the ex post\nfacto clause of its increasing the severity of\npunishment, but for something like a decrease, there -\nthere would be fewer limitations.\nIf there are no further questions, we would\nurge the Court to affirm the judgment of the -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Gannon.\nMr. Gordon, you have 6 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN C. GORDON\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. GORDON: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nFirst, the government talks about, again,\nthe problems arising if -- if a statute is amended, and\nso forth. Again, I would like to analogize that to the\nviolent felony prong of ACCA. Predicate convictions\ndisappear. Things that were predicate convictions cease\nto be when this Court interprets a particular offense as\nnot qualifying as a violent felony, then -- then\nindividuals who had committed that offense it disappears\nas -- as a predicate. So it is -- it is not anomalous\nfor that to happen.\nThe government speaks about looking to the\ntime of the State proceeding. It is -- that -- that -\nthat approach overlooks that changes to drug laws very\nwell could reflect a normative judgment on the basis of\nthe -- of the legislature, and the question is\nwhether -- whether in the way it wrote the statute,\nCongress wanted -- wanted to defer to those State\njudgments.\nTexas and New York changed their sentencing\nlaws because they judged them to have been too harsh,\nthat -- that they treated as more serious offenses\nthan -- than those offenses actually were.\nWe see that today with the issue of -- of\ncrack cocaine. And under the government's reading,\nindividuals may be hit with -- with an ACCA mandatory\nminimum on the basis of crack convictions sustained at a\ntime when, you know, the view of crack is very, very\ndifferent from what it is now. So we think that is an\nimportant consideration as well.\nThe question of retroactivity, again, as we\nhave argued in our brief, it does not -- the savings\nclause in North Carolina was a general savings clause,\nit applied to every single offense in the -- in the\nState. It was not a reflection of the -- of the\nlegislature's judgment of seriousness. And if I -- if I\nmay end on a point that I made earlier, the question for\nthis Court really is when do you want to treat two\nindividuals -- when do you -- when do you want to look\nat them?\nDo you want to look at them at the time of\nthe Federal offense or do you want to look at them in\nterms of their prior State convictions and come to a\nconclusion that although they did exactly the same thing\nin the State court, one committed a serious drug\noffense, one did not. We think that is an absurd\nresult. It's not a fair result, and we would ask the\nCourt to reverse the judgment of the Fourth Circuit.\nThank you very much.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
