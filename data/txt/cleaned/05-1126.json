        "content": "(10:03 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear\nargument first today in Bell Atlantic Corporation vs.\nTwombly. Mr. Kellogg.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL KELLOGG\nON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS\nMR. KELLOGG: Mr. Chief Justice, and may\nit please the Court:\nI think the most important point that I\ncan make today is that this is a case about the\nsubstantive requirements of antitrust law, and just\nas in Dura and in Blue Chip Stamps, the Court\narticulated the substantive requirements for pleading\na claim under the securities law, and just as in\nAnza, it did so under RICO, so too in Associated\nGeneral Contractors, in Trinko. And in the instant\ncase, the Court is faced with the question of what a\nplaintiff needs to plead in order to state a claim\nand show an entitlement to relief under the antitrust\nlaws.\nIn that regard, I'd like to direct the\nCourt's attention to paragraph 51 of the plaintiff's\ncomplaint in this case, which is at page 27 of the\njoint appendix, and which summarizes the grounds for\nplaintiffs' allegation that there is a contract\ncombination or conspiracy in restraint of trade. The\ncomplaint states, and I quote, \"in the absence of any\nmeaningful competition among the defendants,\" and,\nquote, in light of the parallel course of conduct\nthat each engaged in to prevent competition, the\nplaintiffs -- the defendants conspired.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, but isn't the next\nsentence, the substance of the sentence is\n\"plaintiffs allege upon information and belief that\ndefendants have entered into a contract combination\nor conspiracy to prevent competitive entry in their\nrespective telephone and/or high speed interstate\nmarkets, and agreed not to compete with one another\nand otherwise allocated customers and markets to one\nanother.\" Now, does that state a violation of the\nSherman Act?\nMR. KELLOGG: It does not, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: It does not?\nMR. KELLOGG: It does not state a claim.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I mean, you could leave\nout everything before plaintiff, the part you quoted,\nthat's not part of the declaration in the sentence.\nBut the sentence itself alleges a garden variety of\nthe violation of the Sherman Act, doesn't it?\nMR. KELLOGG: The sentence recites the\nlanguage of the Sherman Act, that is correct. But\nwhat this Court's cases indicate and what Rule 8\nrequires --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: It's got the language of\nthe Sherman Act, a conspiracy to prevent competitive\nentry in their respective telephone and/or high speed\nmarkets. That's not in the Sherman Act, that's a\ndescription of the alleged conspiracy in this case.\nMR. KELLOGG: It is true that they have\ndescribed the alleged conspiracy, but what Dura,\nAssociated General Contractors, and other cases of\nthis Court require is a statement of facts that\nwarrants the legal conclusion that the plaintiffs\nwish to --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Kellogg, the\nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure assiduously avoid\nusing the word fact throughout. And from 1938 on, it\nhas been repeated that it is not necessary to plead\nfacts. The index of forms, the appendix of forms\nshows how simple the plain statement of a claim is,\nand you're not required to plead facts. And yet\nthat's the central -- seems to be the central thrust\nof your argument.\nMR. KELLOGG: Your Honor, every case of\nthis Court dealing with pleading standards has\nindicated that it is not sufficient merely to recite\na legal conclusion, and claim an entitlement to\nrelief therefore. In Dura, for example, the\nplaintiffs claimed proximate cause and loss\ncausation, and the Court said --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But Mr. Kellogg, that's\nnot a legal conclusion, it's an allegation of fact\nthat there was an agreement to prevent competitive\nentry into respective markets. There are dozens of\nantitrust complaints that are no more specific than\nthat.\nMR. KELLOGG: Your Honor, in the context\nin which this claim is made, the allegation of\nagreement or conspiracy is not a statement of fact.\nIt is an inference that the plaintiffs seek to draw\nfrom the facts that they allege in the complaint.\nContext here is everything. In form 9, for example,\nJustice Ginsburg, or in the case of Sherkovitz, you\nhad a specific context. You had a time, a place,\nindividual participants named, a clear injury in form\n9, a broken leg as a report --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But negligently drove.\nIt doesn't say whether it went through a stop light.\nDoesn't say whether it was speeding. It doesn't say\nany one of the umpteen ways one could be negligent.\nMR. KELLOGG: That is correct, Justice\nO'Connor, but you have a direct context -- Justice\nGinsburg, you had a direct context in which an\neyewitness participant in the event is claiming\nnegligence on behalf of the driver of the car. In\nthe instant case, we have no injury that's separate\nfrom the alleged conspiracy, and we have no time,\nplace or participants for the alleged conspirators.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But you do have a case --\nanywhere, forget antitrust. Suppose it's a tort\ncase, and the following complaint is filed. My foot\nhurts. I've gone to Dr. Smith for 15 years. I claim\nhe is negligent. Is that valid?\nMR. KELLOGG: I do not think so, because I\ndon't think --\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. Now, if you\nthink that's valid, I understand that you think this\ncomplaint does just what I said in the field of\nantitrust. But is there any case that you've come\nacross which would say a complaint just as I have\ndescribed it --\nMR. KELLOGG: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Either is valid or is not\nvalid. You'd like to find one that says it's not\nvalid, so what's your best effort in any field of\nlaw.\nMR. KELLOGG: I would cite, for example,\nthe Court's decision in the Papasan case, where the\nplaintiffs claimed that they were not getting a\nminimally adequate education. That sounds like a\nfactual statement. But what the Court expressly said\nin that case is that we do not have to accept legal\nconclusions in the guise of factual allegations.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But of course, there the\nlegal standard was not clear. And the Dura case, I\nlooked at, and perhaps you disagree based on what you\n-- what I have just heard, and I thought Dura was a\nlack of proximate cause. They just didn't show any\nrelation between the injury they alleged to have\nsuffered, and their own.\nMR. KELLOGG: Well, I think Dura is --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And that's the way I\nread Dura.\nMR. KELLOGG: I think Dura is an exact\nanalogy. In Dura, they allege proximate cause, they\nallege loss causation. And the Court said, well,\nlet's look at their statement of facts, which only\nshowed that they had bought at an inflated price.\nAnd the Court said there was a fatal gap between that\nfactual allegation and the legal conclusion that they\nwished to draw.\nJUSTICE BREYER: You can get into trouble\nby alleging too much, I guess, because if you allege\na lot, you might leave something out. And you say,\nwell, what about that one. But suppose we keep it\nvery, very minimal. And a person just says, I'm hurt\nand the defendant, I claim, negligently injured me.\nPeriod. Period.\nMR. KELLOGG: That would not provide --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, why not?\nMR. KELLOGG: The grounds upon which the\nclaim is based.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So the only thing that's\nmissing there are some facts.\nMR. KELLOGG: Some facts indicative that\nthe defendant is responsible for the --\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. So now you're\nsaying a complaint has to have facts?\nMR. KELLOGG: Absolutely.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, I thought you were\nalso making a different argument. I thought you were\nmaking the argument that they have, by their\npleadings, in effect, affirmatively indicated that\nthey don't have enough facts to support a general\nallegation. I thought you were saying that because\nof the preface that you began reading, that in view\nsimply of the fact that they are not competing, and\nin view of parallel conduct, they have violated the\nAct.\nSo I guess my question is, would your\nposition be different if there were no allegation\nsimply of an absence of competition and parallel\naction if -- would your position be different if they\nhad simply alleged, as Justice Stevens emphasized,\nthat here were these parties and they had -- they had\ntaken some action, not specified, which resulted in\nviolation of the Act?\nMR. KELLOGG: Our position would not be\ndifferent. It's the uniform view of the cases that I\ncited, the Courts of Appeals and a requirement of\nRule -- Rule 8 that you do more than simply parrot\nthe words of the cause of action or announce legal\nconclusions. But as you point out, in this case --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So that would not be good\nenough, but are you saying that this is worse\nbecause, in effect, they have gone some steps towards\nspecification. And the specifications that they have\nmade affirmatively show that they don't have enough\nfor the agreement.\nMR. KELLOGG: It is certainly true that\nall they have alleged is conduct from which they seek\nto draw an inference of conspiracy. And they have\nmade that quite clear, that they have made no direct\nallegation.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And you're saying that\ninference cannot be drawn from the particular facts\nthat they have alleged.\nMR. KELLOGG: That is correct. Our\nposition is that as a matter of substantive antitrust\nlaw, what this Court said in Matsushita is that\nantitrust law limits the range of permissible\ninferences that can be drawn from parallel conduct.\nAnd if all you have is parallel conduct that's\nconsistent, on the one hand, with conspiracy, or on\nthe other hand, with ordinary business judgment, you\ncannot draw an inference of the sort that the\nplaintiffs depend upon in this case.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Of course, that may be\ntrue on summary judgment, you may be dead right on\nthe merits, but are you telling me that an allegation\nthat the defendants have agreed not to compete with\none another is not a statement of fact?\nMR. KELLOGG: I am. I would say that\nthat's a -- that's a conclusion --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, what if they said\nthey agreed in writing not to compete with one\nanother, would that be sufficient? Or if they have\nagreed orally not to compete with one another, would\nthat be sufficient?\nMR. KELLOGG: If there were a specific\ncontext and they said --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: If they said they have\nagreed orally not to compete with one another, would\nthat be a statement of fact, an allegation of fact?\nMR. KELLOGG: Yes. Because you require --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Then why did you leave\nthe words orally out? Why is it not a statement,\nallegation of fact?\nMR. KELLOGG: Because the plaintiffs here\nwere very careful, in light of Rule 11, not to make\nany direct allegations of conspiracy, not to suggest\nthat there was a time and place --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But that's a direct\nallegation of conspiracy, that very statement.\nMR. KELLOGG: But they make it clear in\nthat paragraph that it's an inference.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: They make it fairly\nclear that they may only have the evidence of\nparallel conduct that you describe, and that may not\nbe sufficient, and maybe for that reason, you get a\nsummary judgment. But how you can say this is not an\nallegation of fact, I find mind-boggling.\nMR. KELLOGG: I'm saying that it's not\nsufficient to state a claim. Just as the allegation\nthat there was lost causation in Dura, or that there\nwas harm to the union in Associated General\nContractors or there, that there was harm --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Now you're, that's the\npart precisely which you're following that I don't,\nthat I actually don't know, is the extent to which\nyou have to put in a complaint, in whatever field of\nlaw, you can allege a fact. You say the person ran\nover me --\nMR. KELLOGG: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Or you say, they treated\nme negligently. That's a fact. That means something\nhappened there. But suppose you write the complaint\nand there is just no notion that you have a what and\nwhen, how, under what circumstances. It's just\ntotally out of thin air, and the defendant doesn't\nknow what, what period of time he is supposed to be\nthinking about, what, what happens to such a\ncomplaint? There must be some law on it in torts or\nsomeplace?\nMR. KELLOGG: Well, ordinarily in a\ncomplaint like that, you could file a 12(e) motion\nand ask for more specificity. Our problem --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, why couldn't you do\nthe same?\nMR. KELLOGG: Our problem with the current\ncomplaint is not a lack of specificity, it's quite\nspecific. It provides color maps and such. The\nproblem is that the facts specifically alleged simply\ndon't amount to an antitrust violation because they\ndon't support the inference that the plaintiffs ask\nthe Court to draw.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Oh, but they're --\nthey're using the fact that there was parallel\nbehavior as a basis for thinking there was more than\nparallel behavior. They are using it as a basis for\nthinking that once, on some occasion that's relevant,\nthere were people meeting in a room and saying things\nto each other. So they are not just saying that it's\nsufficient. They are saying it's evidence that\nsomething else occurred.\nMR. KELLOGG: That's correct. That's\nexactly what they are saying and what Matsushita and\nthe other courses, cases of this Court dealing with\nparallel conduct indicate, is that that's not a fair\ninference from parallel conduct.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Wasn't that a summary\njudgment case and hadn't there been discovery before?\nThe Matsushita decision?\nMR. KELLOGG: That is correct. But the\nCourt announced that as a principle of substantive\nlaw. They said substantive antitrust law limits the\nrange of permissible inferences. We are not\nsuggesting that the plaintiffs need the sort of\nspecificity or certainly any evidence at the\npleadings stage. For example --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: They just have to say\norally, I wish you would reconsider that? Because if\nthat's, if that's all you're arguing, I don't see\nanything to be gained by -- by such a holding. It\ndoesn't tell you -- you know, this is a suit against\na number of large corporations, nationwide\nbusinesses, thousands of employees. And on this\ncomplaint you have no idea who agreed with whom,\nwhere, when, any of that.\nI can understand that you're saying that\ndoes not give us enough notice to prepare a defense.\nBut if you say oh, but it would be perfectly all\nright so long as they said orally. I mean -- forget\nabout it.\nMR. KELLOGG: I -- I should not agree to\nthat. That's simply adding the word orally. It's\ncertainly fair when you are talking about a\nnationwide class over a period of 10 years attacking\nan entire industry to suggest that the plaintiffs\nhave to give some indication of what it is that the\ndefendants have done that is wrong. Some concrete\nbasis for the Court to believe there is a reason to\ngo forward to the --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So in the negligently\ndrove case, the plaintiff negligently drove over --\nthe defendant negligently drove over the plaintiff,\nif it's not specific as to time and place it must be\ndismissed? If it's specific as to time and place\nit's, it withstands the motion?\nMR. KELLOGG: Well certainly, Form 9 is\nvery specific. It gives a specific corner, it gives\na time, it gives the names of the participants.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: What if it does say\nwithin the last 10 years.\nMR. KELLOGG: I don't think that's\nsufficient, Your Honor. But with a -- with a --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Do you have a case, do\nyou have a case I can look to that tells me that?\nMR. KELLOGG: With a negligence case a\n12(e) motion could then specify the actual time and\nplace, but the plaintiffs here have had ample\nopportunity to amend their complaint to supplement.\nIf they had any specifics indicating that there was\nsuch an agreement as opposed to lawyer speculation\nand a desire to engage in expensive discovery they\nwould have produced that.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Did you seek a more\nspecific statement?\nMR. KELLOGG: We did not, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why not? Why didn't you\nask when and where was this agreement.\nMR. KELLOGG: Well again the whole way\nthis was litigated below by the plaintiffs was that\nthey, they acknowledged they had no specifics. They\nsimply asked that an inference be drawn from the\nparallel conduct they alleged. And that is our\ncentral point that you simply cannot infer an\nagreement from this conduct. If the Court has no\nquestions, I reserve my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Kellogg. Mr. Barnett.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS G. BARNETT,\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,\nIN SUPPORT OF PETITIONERS\nMR. BARNETT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may\nit please the Court.\nThe fundamental concern of the United\nStates is that the decision of the Second Circuit can\nbe read to hold that a Section 1 Sherman Act\ncomplaint will survive a motion to dismiss merely by\nalleging parallel action or inaction in attaching the\nbare assertion of an agreement. Such a result fails\nto appreciate that parallel action or inaction is\nubiquitous in our economy and often reflects\nbeneficial competitive forces.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What do you mean can be\nheld, can be thought to hold that? Is there any\ninterpretation of what they did.\nMR. BARNETT: Well there are certain\nportions of the decision that talk about a\nplausibility requirement but when it turns to the\nspecific area of a Section 1 complaint and a\ncomplaint alleged on parallel conduct, I agree with\nyou, Justice Scalia, that that's the only\ninterpretation I can draw from that passage. The\nCourt held that if you allege parallel action unless\nthere are no set of facts that can be proved, and\nit's always possible to hypothesize an agreement, you\ncannot dismiss that complaint.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, is that really what\nthey -- I thought, and correct me if I'm wrong, but I\nthought that the, that the Court spoke of no set of\nfacts, only on the assumption that there had been a\npleading which did raise a plausible, possible\ninference of forbidden conduct, and I thought the\nCourt was saying if the, if the plausibility\ncriterion has been satisfied, then the only way that\nthe defendant can get a dismissal is by showing that\nthere is no set of facts which would actually support\nthe action. And I'm not sure that that can be done\nat the, at the, at the stage of simply pleading a\ndismissal as opposed to summary judgment or something\nlike that. But I thought the Court did not get to\nits no set of facts point until it had first assumed\nthat there had been a, a pleading on the basis of\nwhich a plausible inference of forbidden conduct\ncould be drawn. Am I about that?\nMR. BARNETT: Well, Justice Souter, I read\nthat passage of the Second Circuit decision as not\nexpressly referencing the plausibility requirement.\nThere is language saying that the allegation needs to\nbe plausible but when you get to this specific\npassage it says that if you allege parallel conduct a\ncourt cannot dismiss the claim unless there could be\nno set of facts that could be proved. But\nregardless, even if I am, your interpretation is\npotentially permissible interpretation, the\nfundamental concern of the United States is that this\nCourt, having the case now, clarify that a Section 1\nSherman Act complaint should not be able to survive a\nmotion to dismiss unless it alleges some facts beyond\nmere generic parallel action.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So, so that if\nplausibility is the standard this does not meet the\nstandard of plausibility, that's your argument?\nMR. BARNETT: Well, we prefer the\nformulation that, from the Court's opinion in Dura\nthat says that the facts need to demonstrate some\nreasonably founded expectation that there is an\nunlawful agreement within the meaning of Section 1 of\nthe Sherman Act.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And some parallel action\nwould indicate that wouldn't it? I mean, if for\nexample they, you have nine companies that change\ntheir price at the same hour of the same day, 10\nmonths in a row.\nMR. BARNETT: Absolutely, Justice Scalia.\nI agree.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So you're, you're not\nsaying that parallel action can never create this,\nthis kind of --\nMR. BARNETT: That is correct. If all you\nknow is that there is parallel action or inaction,\nthat in and of itself tells you nothing. Once you\nstart to add the facts and circumstances surrounding\nit, particular parallel action can be suspicious\nenough, and the example you give is a good one, that\ndemonstrates a reasonably founded expectation for\nbelieving that discovery may yield evidence showing\nthat that parallel price increase at the same time by\nnine different companies was the result of an\nunlawful conspiracy.\nIf I can turn to, in -- in deciding\nwhether or not there is such a reasonably founded\nexpectation, you do need to look to the substantive\nlaw. Here the issue is the law on agreement under\nSection 1 of the Sherman Act. Some of the questions\nI think I've heard go to this issue. Section 1 law\nspecifically limits the kinds of facts that can be\nused to establish an agreement that is cognizable\nunder the Sherman Act. In particular, the Court's\nrulings made clear that conscious parallelism which\nsome economists might argue is a form of an\nagreement, is not an agreement within the meaning of\nSection 1.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: It's clear it's not\nsufficient to prove it, but is it admissible\nevidence?\nMR. BARNETT: It may be admissible\nevidence but depending on the facts and circumstances\n--\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Should a plaintiffs's\ncomplaint fail because it includes unnecessary,\nverbose, admissible evidence?\nMR. BARNETT: No. It should fail if it\nfail -- if it does not allege facts that indicate\nreasonable found --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Is not it an allegation\nthat they've agreed not to compete with one another\nan allegation of fact?\nMR. BARNETT: It is a combined question of\nlaw and fact in our view, because as I said the\nSection 1 law limits the kinds of facts that can be\nused to establish an agreement. If all they have\nalleged is parallel action without more --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But they have alleged\nmore. They have alleged an actual agreement.\nMR. BARNETT: But as paragraph 51 of the\ncomplaint is, as you were discussing, in some ways\neven worse. Because it specifically relies upon\nparallel action and alleged parallel inaction.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But what if it didn't? I\nmean, I mean face the question that Justice Stevens\nputs. Suppose you have a complaint that says nothing\nelse except that these defendants entered into an\nagreement in -- in restraint of trade.\nMR. BARNETT: And that is not sufficient\nbecause in our view the complaint needs to allege\nsome facts that demonstrate a basis for believing\nthere was an unlawful agreement within --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: What if the complaint in\naddition to that alleged that up to a certain date,\nit was unlawful for the companies to compete with one\nanother but the law was changed and after that change\ntook place they were advised by their lawyers they\ncould compete, but they agreed not to. Would that be\nsufficient?\nMR. BARNETT: No. Every business, every\nday fails to enter some new line of business or take\nsome potential competitive action. The mere --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But Justice\nStevens's question was that the allegation was that\nafter that date they agreed not to compete. That\nstates -- that states a cause of action under the\nSherman Act, doesn't it?\nMR. BARNETT: No. I would, with respect,\nMr. Chief Justice, I would disagree with that. There\nstill needs in our view to be some allegation that\nindicates -- a factual allegation that indicates a\nreason for believing there may have been unlawful\nagreement.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Can they say on the 14th\nof January, 2004, we believe that in the city of New\nYork, they agreed upon this course of action? That\nwould surely be sufficient?\nMR. BARNETT: That may be sufficient\nbecause it is providing enough facts to give you a\nreason to believe that the plaintiff has a basis for\n--\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, it's saying, all\nI've done is limited it in time and space. Just as\nyou might say on October the 24th, 2004 at the corner\nof 14th and Third Avenue, defendant drove negligently\nand injured me. That's certainly a complaint, isn't\nit?\nMR. BARNETT: Well, and it -- you -- you\n--\nJUSTICE BREYER: Isn't it?\nMR. BARNETT: It needs to allege enough\nspecifics --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, look, the one I\njust alleged in the tort law is a complaint. I've\njust copied it out of the model complaints.\nMR. BARNETT: I want to be clear --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Am I right or not?\nMR. BARNETT: The facts allege need to be\nspecific enough to suggest --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, I understand the\nstandard.\nMR. BARNETT: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I want to know how to\napply the standard and now I take my tort case --\nMR. BARNETT: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- which is okay, and now\nI say sometime during the last 10 years he drove\nnegligently and injured me. Is that no good?\nMR. BARNETT: In my view that's probably\ninsufficient --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And so you're saying that\nthis case is like that, when because they don't say\nwhen they met, they don't say what happened, they\ndon't give a time or place.\nIf that's, leaving your side parallelism\nout of it, I'm past you on that, all right? I'll\naccept for argument's sake all your point about that.\nNow if you're saying this is too vague, leaving that\nout of it, because it doesn't say time and place of\nthe meetings or give any other clue for meetings\netcetera, what's your best authority ?\nThis is an area of law I'm not familiar\nwith. I'm looking for cases that will tell me how\nspecific a complaint has to be to tie the events down\nto specific ones.\nMR. BARNETT: I believe that this Court's\ndecision in Dura Pharmaceutical --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Dura is still the best.\nI think I, did I write that case?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. BARNETT: You did --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I'm not drawing total\ncomfort from it.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: In fact I'd like\nsomething in tort law or something that, you know,\nthat I get a general idea of what the law is because\nI don't know that antitrust is --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Barnett, I thought --\nMR. BARNETT: I thought our brief lists\ncases that go to that point.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Barnett I thought you\nhad, you had said that you don't need to indicate the\nparticular day of the agreement. That it would be\nenough if it was the kind of parallel action that\nsuggested an agreement that over nine years they all\nraised the price at the same time. Now that doesn't\nreally give the defendant notice of, you know, what\nindividuals were responsible for this, when it\noccurred. But you say that would still be adequate?\nMR. BARNETT: Well, it does provide notice\nthat -- this is a fairly low threshold. It provides\nsome indication. It can be an indication of direct\nevidence. It can be an indication of circumstantial\nevidence. It does focus the litigation, however, by\nproviding a, a reason why the court and the defendant\nshould be defending themselves against a section 1\nclaim.\nMy time is up.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Barnett.\nMr. Richards, we'll hear now from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF J. DOUGLAS RICHARDS\nON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS\nMR. RICHARDS: Mr. Chief Justice and may\nit please the Court:\nThere are four essential dimensions to the\nproblem that's before the Court and on every one of\nthose dimensions the guidance that the Solicitor\nGeneral gave in its amicus brief in the Swierkiewicz\ncase is 180 degrees opposite the guidance that the\nSolicitor General is providing in its amicus brief in\nthis case. The first of those dimensions I'll begin\nwith because it's where petitioners began. In their\nbrief, the Solicitor General in the Swierkiewicz case\nvery clearly said that evidentiary standards cannot\nbe made into pleading standards. What they said on\npage 5 was that by requiring pleading of the\nMcDonnell Douglas prima facie case from employment\nlaw the Second Circuit had erroneously conflated the\nfair notice owed the defendant at the outset of the\nlitigation with the standards governing the\nplaintiff's present of proof in court. Later at page\n11, they said the court's test confuses pleading ---\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Now you're reading from\nthe Swierkiewicz brief?\nMR. RICHARDS: From the Swierkiewicz\nSolicitor General brief.\nThey said that the court test in the\nSecond Circuit that was reversed --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, i mean, you know,\nthat's shame on them. But we're trying to get this\ncase right and, you know, I don't care what position\nthey took before. I care about what the right answer\nis, and I find it difficult to believe that you can\nsimply allege in a complaint, I was injured by the\nnegligence of the defendant in driving an automobile,\nperiod. Does that satisfy the, the Federal Rules?\nMR. RICHARDS: There's a big difference\nbetween -- the answer is I don't know, perhaps.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Perhaps?\nMR. RICHARDS: Perhaps. But that's very\ndifferent from this case and it's different in that\nan automobile accident is something that happens all\nin one moment in time. An antitrust conspiracy like\nthe conspiracy alleged --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The agreement happens at\none moment in time.\nMR. RICHARDS: Oh, it could happen in many\nmoments.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Meetings of the minds,\nmeeting of the minds. I used to each Contracts.\nMeeting of the minds at one moment in time, okay.\nMR. RICHARDS: But what the Second Circuit\nsaid on this point, and I submit that the Second\nCircuit was correct, was that the complaint does set\nforth the temporal and geographic parameters of the\nalleged illegal activity and the identities of the\nalleged key participants, and I think that's correct.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But where does it\nset forth agreement?\nMR. RICHARDS: It alleges --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Temporal,\ngeographic, the identities, but where does it set\nforth anything evincing an agreement other than the\nallegation of parallel conduct?\nMR. RICHARDS: It alleges that there was\nan agreement, but it doesn't prove that there was an\nagreement because proving the facts alleged is not a\nplaintiff's burden in the complaint.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you have any,\nis there an allegation of an agreement apart from the\nparallel conduct?\nMR. RICHARDS: Yes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And what does that\nconsist of?\nMR. RICHARDS: The leading plus factor\nthat's generally used in, in the Matsushita context,\nin the Monsanto context, is action that would have\nbeen against the self-interest of the conspirators in\nthe absence of a conspiracy, and this complaint\nalleges very clearly that the conduct of not entering\ninto one another's territories and competing among\nthe ILECs as a CLEC was contrary to what would have\nbeen --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So it states --\nwould it state an antitrust violation if had you a\ngrocery store on one corner of the block and a pet\nstore on the other corner of the block and you say,\nwell, the grocery store is not selling pet supplies\nand they could make money if they did, therefore\nthat's an antitrust violation?\nMR. RICHARDS: If that conspiracy were\nimplausible, if it made no sense.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's all the\nfacts that are alleged.\nMR. RICHARDS: Right, but the Second\nCircuit standard and the standard we defend is that\nif someone alleges a conspiracy I that just makes no\nsense because it's obvious from the face of the\ncomplaint that the alleged conspirators aren't in the\nsame product market, not in the same geographic\nmarket or something of that kind, there is no\nconceivable motive for them to enter into the kind of\nconspiracy at hand, the complaint can be dismissed.\nJUSTICE BREYER: If my case, the gasoline,\noil prices fell, but I happen to know there were four\ngasoline shops near each other, gasoline stations,\nand they didn't cut their prices. Complaint?\nMR. RICHARDS: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, then that's the\neconomy, and you can go sue half the firms in this\neconomy. Every firm in a concentrated industry\nengages in -- I mean, normally conscious parallelism,\nand I know there are economists who think that that\nshould be the case, but I thought the law to date was\nthat the Department of Justice is not given by the\nSherman Act the authority to remake the entire\nAmerican economy. But if we accept your view I guess\nit is.\nMR. RICHARDS: Well, Justice Breyer, in\nthe NHL case, the National Hockey League case, which\nis one of the cases that the petitioners relied upon\nfor a circuit conflict to get here, what the court\nsaid is that allegations that defendant's action\ntaken independently would be contrary to their\neconomic self-interest will ordinarily tend to\nexclude the likelihood --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Ordinarily, if you take\nthat sentence and read it for how you're reading, a\nconsciously parallel action is a violation of Sherman\nAct section 2, then we have that radical change that\nmany have advocated for the last 40 or 50 years, that\nhalf the economy is in violation, because in any\nconcentrated industry, after all, it is in the\ninterest of a firm to cut prices and to make a large\nmarket unless he knows his three competitors will\nalso keep prices up. Now, you have to know that or\nyou'd cut them. And that's called conscious\nparallelism. And I had always thought that this\nCourt had not said that that in and of itself is a\nviolation of the Sherman Act.\nMR. RICHARDS: Well, Justice Breyer, we\ndon't just allege conscious parallelism. We\nallege --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I know that, but if in\nfact all you have to do in order to bring a\nprice-fixing case and get into discovery is to allege\nconscious parallelism and then add without further\nfoundation, and we think there was a real agreement\ntoo, but there's nothing other than the conscious\nparallelism to back it up, now we've got just what I\nsaid, with the exception you might not win at the end\nof the day. What have you is a ticket to conduct\ndiscovery. Now, that's what's bothering the\nDepartment of Justice and so I'd like to know the\nanswer to that problem.\nMR. RICHARDS: Well, Justice Breyer, the\ndifference between that, a critical difference\nbetween that scenario and what we have alleged in\nthis complaint is that we do allege in great detail\nthat not entering into one another's territories\nwould have been contrary to the interests of --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But that does not help\nyou with respect to the other claim, the claim that\nthere was a conspiracy to prevent upstart competitors\nfrom coming in. There's no plus factor as I\nunderstand it alleged there, and I also understand\nthat it would have been entirely in the interest of\neach of your defendants to keep the upstarts out and\nthat there is no need for them to agree to do that.\nIt would be the most natural thing in the world to do\nit. What do you say about that part of your case?\nMR. RICHARDS: As to that aspect of the\ncase, paragraph 50 does allege two plus factors, but\nthey are essentially allegations of common motive,\nwhich is a less strong, I'll grant you --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but a common, isn't\nthe common motive consistent, just as consistent with\nno agreement as with agreement? In other words, they\ndidn't have to agree; their common motive was\noperative agreement or not?\nMR. RICHARDS: The important thing as to\nthat aspect of the conspiracy is the Continental case\nin this Court, which said that you're not supposed to\ndismember -- it's an inappropriate way to approach a\nconspiracy to dismember it, look at one piece of it\nin isolation, evaluate it as though it's by itself\nand then wipe the slate clean at the end of that\nanalysis, and that's essentially what the other side\nis trying to do repeatedly.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, what the other side\nis saying is that simply by alleging parallelism when\nit would be in the interest of each of the alleged\nconspirators to do just as you claim they are doing\nin the absence of an agreement, you have not alleged\nsomething that gets to the threshold of plausibility.\nThat's their argument and I, I --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I think, by the way, that\nthat argument applies not just to the keeping out the\nupstart claim, but also to the not entering the other\nalleged conspirator s' fields of monopoly, if you\nwant to put it that way, because if I, if I enter\nyour field I know that you're going to enter mine.\nIt just doesn't pay for me to do it. Yeah, I can\nmake money, but I'll lose money. It seems to me\nperfectly natural for companies that have a certain\ngeographic area in which they are the, the principal,\nthe selected instrument and although they technically\ncan enter somebody else's geographic area, they know\nthat if they do it they will be subjected to the same\nthing. That is nothing more than conscious\nparallelism.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: You may reply to us\njointly or severally, however you may want.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. RICHARDS: If I may, I'll try to pose\na hypothetical that I think addresses Justice\nSouter's question and then, Justice Scalia, I'll try\nto address your question. Justice Souter, a good\nexample would be suppose one alleges a conspiracy to\nrob a bank and to steal a number of getaway cars at\nthe same time and one comes -- in order to get away,\nso that the conspirators couldn't be found at the\nsite of robbing the bank. One could say, well,\nthere's a reason to rob the getaway cars totally\nindependent of the bank and without a conspiracy.\nWhy do they need a conspiracy to steal a car? Why\nisn't that something that they wouldn't individually\ndo?\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But the difference\nbetween that case and this is that the allegation\nwith respect to the agreement to procure the getaway\ncars gets to a kind of specificity that is not\npresent here. Here the allegation simply is parallel\nconduct to make it hard for the upstarts to get in.\nAnd at that general level the answer is, of course\nanyone in his right mind would want to make it\ndifficult to let the upstarts in. There's no need to\nassume that they might have agreed on some matter of\ndetail which is not essential to the scheme. This is\na general characteristic of competition and\nresistance of competition.\nMR. RICHARDS: I understand, but the point\nI'm trying to make with the hypothetical is that what\none does if one is just looking at the conspiracy to\nkeep CLECs out by itself first, taking the secondary\naspect of the conspiracy, putting it first and\nanalyzing it in isolation, is like taking the getaway\ncar theft, analyzing it in isolation, saying, well,\nthey have a reason individually to steal the cars, so\nI guess that couldn't --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Richards, can I ask\nyou this question. Supposing that you were allowed\nto have discovery and each chief executive of the\ndefendant companies got on the stand and said: I\nnever talked to my, my competitors at all, I never\nseriously considered competing in the other, other\ncompany's territory for the reasons set forth in the,\nin your opponent's brief on the merits here. We\nnever did agree. And you're able to prove the things\nyou've alleged in the agreement. Would the, would it\nbe appropriate to enter summary judgment against you\non that testimony if you had no evidence of a\nspecific agreement?\nMR. RICHARDS: In the context of summary\njudgment or at trial, we would be required to prove\nwhat we have now alleged.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But my question is you\ncan prove what you've now alleged factually, but they\ndeny the existence of any agreement and they\nexplained the reasons for it exactly as the lawyers\ndid in this brief. Would you not lose on summary\njudgment?\nMR. RICHARDS: If we don't have proof at\nthat point of what we've alleged here, we'd lose --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: After several years --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Prove what you have\nalleged, in effect, except for the key allegation of\nagreement among the competitors. If you had no other\nevidence of that agreement, would you win.\nMR. RICHARDS: If we had proof that they\nactually acted against what would have been their\nself-interest in the absence of a conspiracy, we\nwould satisfy then the Matsushita standard for\nsummary judgment.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I don't understand\nacting in self interest. I mean, they might just\ndecide apart from, you know, if they go into their\nterritory they'll come into mine, that investing in\nthis wired business isn't the best, the best bet for\nthem. Maybe they want to get into the wireless\nbusiness and think that's a better way to spend their\nmoney.\nMR. BARNETT: Surely it is possible to\nconceive of facts under which they would not have not\nconspired and they would have had a different motive,\nbut that's not the legal standard under Conley versus\nGibson.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But I'm questioning\nyou. You say you meet the plus factor because they\nwere acting against their self- interest, that a\nself-interested player in this league would have gone\ninto the other's territory, and I'm questioning that\nby saying that they might have seen this whole area\nas not the best place to invest their money.\nMR. RICHARDS: I understand that. But we\nhave alleged that as fact, Justice Ginsburg, and that\nfact and that allegation has to be treated as true\nunder conventional pleading standards for purposes of\na motion to dismiss. If we are unable to prove that\nfact when we get to summary judgment --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: You mean the mere fact\nthat you have alleged something is against their\nself-interest is enough to make an issue of fact on\nwhether it's against their self-interest?\nMR. RICHARDS: Yes, yes.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: They could have gone on\nthe stand, they gave all the reasons in the red\nbriefs -- or the blue briefs in this case, that say\nit's not against their self-interest; you'd say that\nwould be a jury question?\nMR. RICHARDS: No, not at summary\njudgment. What I'm saying is that at the pleading\nstage to allege that, which is an allegation of fact,\nsatisfies pleading standards. Just to allege it with\ntestimony on the other side and no evidence to prove\nthat allegation on summary judgment --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Are you suggesting that\nyou don't have to prove an actual agreement? You can\nmerely prove conduct contrary to self-interest is\nsufficient?\nMR. RICHARDS: Conduct contrary to\nself-interest is a way of inferring actual agreement\nin the absence of direct evidence.\nJUDGE STEVENS: Do you agree you must --\ndo you agree that you must prove an actual agreement\namong the defendants?\nMR. RICHARDS: There must be an inference\nof actual agreement, but the inference can be drawn\nfrom circumstantial evidence, and that's what\nMatsushita is all about.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So then when we\nget back to the paragraph 51, let me start with your\nstatement at the bottom half of that paragraph, that\nplaintiffs allege upon information and belief that\nthey have entered into a contract, is a conclusion\nbased upon your prior allegations, it's not an\nindependent allegation of an agreement. It's saying\nbecause of this parallel conduct, because we think\nit's contrary to their self interest, therefore, they\nhave agreed.\nMR. RICHARDS: Counsel presented it as\nthough it's a complete summary of everything, but\nwhat it says is, and the other facts and market\ncircumstances alleged above, and it's preceded by --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But it's a\nstatement of a conclusion based upon your allegations\nthat precede it.\nMR. RICHARDS: Correct.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's not a\nstatement that independently there apart from all of\nthis, there's an agreement.\nMR. RICHARDS: Well, it's also an\nindependent statement and allegation on information\nand belief, which is permitted under Rule 8, that\nthere is agreement.\nJUSTICE ALITO: I guess if you had just\nalleged the last part of paragraph 51, plaintiffs\nhave alleged, plaintiffs allege upon information and\nbelief, et cetera, without the detail that you\nprovided, would that have been sufficient?\nMR. RICHARDS: If you gave no context of\nwhat kind of a conspiracy you were alleging and what\nkind of scope it had, so that a court could balance\n--\nJUSTICE ALITO: But you omit all the\nallegations about parallel conduct and the other\nallegations that you think provide a basis for\ninferring a conspiracy from the parallel conduct, if\nyou omit all that but you just include the last part\nof 51, would that be enough?\nMR. RICHARDS: If there isn't enough in\nthe way of facts alleged to permit a court to\nunderstand what it is you're claiming in general\nterms happening, then you haven't satisfied Rule 8.\nI mean --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: What's the answer to\nJustice Alito's question in this case?\nMR. RICHARDS: Well, in this case we have\nprovided, as the Second Circuit --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: No. His hypothetical is\nall you've done is to allege the final sentence\nwithout the preceding clause, the five or six lines\nbefore there's a comma. That's out. All there is is\nthe allegation of the conspiracy. Is that enough in\nthis case?\nMR. RICHARDS: In this case with the\nallegations of the nature of the conspiracy that\nprecede that sentence, it's enough.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: No. The hypothetical is\nwithout the preceding clause. Is that enough --\nMR. RICHARDS: That sentence by itself --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Is that enough in this\ncase for what Justice Alito asked, and I think we are\ninterested in the answer that you make given this\ncomplaint in this case that we are faced with.\nMR. RICHARDS: I think that that would\nsatisfy conventional pleading standards under Rule\n8(a). On the other hand, I don't think it would\nsatisfy the Second Circuit's standard below, because\nthe Second Circuit required enough facts to enable a\ncourt to wrap its mind around a complainant,\nunderstanding what it is you claimed happened. You\ndon't have to prove your case as a complainant, you\njust have to --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I'd also like a clear\nanswer, and I would like to go back to Justice\nStevens' question because I'm not sure what you're\nthinking there. We have three steel sheet companies\nin the United States, no more. They sell at $10 a\nsheet. One day we have action in the case, a memo to\nthe president of the company. He says Mr. President,\nif you cut your prices to $7 you will make even more\nmoney unless the others go along. And if they get\nthere first, you will lose money. So whether they\ncut or not, you'd better cut your prices. Reply from\nthe president: But if I don't cut my prices, they\nwon't cut theirs, and we are all better off. That's\nyour evidence. Do you win?\nMR. RICHARDS: That would depend on the\nvehicle --\nJUSTICE BREYER: There is no depend.\nThat's the evidence. Do you win?\nMR. RICHARDS: If that's the evidence, I\nthink I win.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. And you cite\nMatsushita for that?\nMR. RICHARDS: No. For that I would cite\nJudge Posner's decision.\nJUSTICE BREYER: If you're right, then I\nguess we could engage in this major restructuring of\nthe economy, and if that's the law, I'm surprised\nthey haven't done it, but maybe they have just been\nrecalcitrant.\nMR. RICHARDS: Well, there's no major\nrestructuring of the --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, because we have\nconcentrated industries throughout the economy, I\nguess, or at least we used to, and I suppose that\nthat's a perfectly valid way of reasoning for an\nexecutive in such a company, at least they teach that\nat the schools of government, and people who aren't\nreally experienced in these things, but --\nMR. RICHARDS: Well, the way Judge Posner\nexplains it in High Fructose is to say that it is\npossible to have an agreement without a moment where\nthere's a statement of agreement. The participants\nin a conspiracy can possibly treat what one of them\ndoes as an offer, which another one can accept by\nfollowing it, to satisfy that way of showing a\nconspiracy.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay, fine. Now, let's\nforget my immediate disagreement or not. Let's say I\nagree with you on this. Now we have our example\nright in mind. What other than the parallel to my\nexample could one reading this complaint think you\nintend to prove?\nMR. RICHARDS: Well, Your Honor, the\nstrongest -- plus factors that, in the absence of\ndirect evidence of conspiracy at the outset of a\ncase, which private plaintiffs will almost never have\nbecause people don't conspire in public parks. All a\nplaintiff can have is what are called plus factors\nunder Matsushita, and the strongest of those plus\nfactors is what has been alleged in great detail in\nthis complaint of action against self interest. The\ncase law recognizes that --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But how do you\ntell? I mean, companies get proposals all the time.\nHere's a way you could make more money. You could\nall enter the market in some foreign country. The\npeople decide, I mean, life is short and they've got\ncertain objectives, and they don't have to do\neverything that an economist might think is in their\neconomic self interest. I mean, what is the limiting\nself interest to that?\nMR. RICHARDS: This is different from that\nbecause this is a situation where when the\nTelecommunications Act was passed in 1996, Congress\nexpected that the ILECs would compete in one\nanother's territories as CLECs. The defendants\npledged that they would compete in one another's\nterritories at ILECs. They then for years in\nCongress complained that the CLECs who were trying to\ncompete with them were given an unfair advantage in\nthe terms and conditions on which they were permitted\nto --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is it an adequate\nresponse for the executive to say, I'm a little risk\naverse, I want to see how things work out over the\nnext five years. They keep changing the laws, the\nregulatory environment. That's why I didn't jump in\nand compete?\nMR. RICHARDS: If they can prove that\nthat's the reason why they didn't jump in and\ncompete, then they have a nonconspiratorial reason\nfor what they did.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But if they don't do\nthat, is it your argument that simply by behaving\ndifferently from the way Congress assumed when it\npassed the statute, that raises the plausible\ninference of violation?\nMR. RICHARDS: Within the other facts that\nI was identifying, there is a strong suggestion here\nthat competition as a CLEC would have been, in the\nabsence of the pattern of conduct that we allege\nhere, would have been a profitable endeavor.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. But is part of the\nplausibility of that inference the fact, in your\nargument, the fact that Congress assumed that would\nhappen?\nMR. RICHARDS: That's one factor that I\npoint to among several to --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But I mean, the\ncongressional assumption is part of your case, in\nother words?\nMR. RICHARDS: It is.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yes.\nMR. RICHARDS: I believe that along with\nother factors such as the constant complaints to\nCongress about how CLECs had the better side of the\ndeal than the ILECs, along with the pledges of the\ndefendants that they would do, and that they didn't\ndo.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I used to work in the\nfield of telecommunications and if the criterion is\nthat happens which Congress expected to happen when\nit passed its law, your case is very weak.\nMR. RICHARDS: Well, Your Honor, that -- I\ncertainly don't expect that that is the evidence that\nwe would be relying on at trial or at summary\njudgment to support our case, but in our motion to\ndismiss we don't have to have the evidence to support\nour case.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you need what is\ncalled the plus factor, and I gather that you\nacknowledge that if I disagree with you that this,\nthis parallel action seemed to be against the self\ninterest of the companies, you no longer have a plus\nfactor and you would lose.\nMR. RICHARDS: I don't think that the\nCourt, if the Court comes to a conclusion on its own\nthat the facts that we have alleged, which is that it\nwould have been in their interest to do this in the\nabsence of conspiracy, is wrong, then the Court is\nnot following conventional pleading standards.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So all you have to do to\nprove, to establish a plus factor is to say in your\npleading, and there is a plus factor?\nMR. RICHARDS: Well, you have to say what\nit is.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You have to say what it\nis, that's all, and even if it's implausible?\nMR. RICHARDS: Well, if it's implausible,\nthat might be a different consideration.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Richards, didn't\nthe Second Circuit say you don't need a plus factor?\nThey said if you did, we think that the plaintiffs\ncould show it, but the second sentence is you don't\nneed a plus factor.\nMR. RICHARDS: That's correct.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And that can be wrong\nor right, but the Second Circuit was very clear that\nRule 8 wants a plain statement of the claim and no\nplus factor.\nMR. RICHARDS: I agree with that, Your\nHonor, and my contention as to what the law is is\nthat we are not required to plead plus factors. But\nthe fact remains that we have, and that our factual\npleading of plus factors has to be treated as true\nfor purposes of a --\nJUSTICE ALITO: What if you pled more than\nyou had to, and it's clear from what you pled that\nyou were drawing an implausible inference? Can't the\ncomplaint then be dismissed for failure to state a\nclaim?\nMR. RICHARDS: No, I don't believe that it\ncan be if -- because the Court is not, the correct\nfunction of the Court under a Rule 12(b)(6) motion is\nnot to be decided by whether it believes or is\npersuaded by the allegations in the complaint.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, let's take the Form\n9 where you take the form complaint for an automobile\naccident, and suppose what it says is, I was injured\nin an automobile accident at a particular place in\ntime. I was hit by a compact car with Massachusetts\nplates. The defendant owns the compact car with\nMassachusetts plates. That's the complaint. The\nCourt can't dismiss that for failure to state a claim\nwhen it's apparent from the face of the claim that\nyou're, that the basis for suing the defendant is a\ntotally implausible inference?\nMR. RICHARDS: Well, if the allegation is\nalso made that the defendant was negligent, then I\nthink it clearly satisfies the pleading standard\nunder Form 9. I think it would be a more detailed\ncomplaint than the sample that comprises Form 9 of\nthe rules.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Even if it reveals that\nthe only basis for identifying this person as the\ndefendant is the fact that the person has a\nMassachusetts license plate and a compact car?\nMR. RICHARDS: Yes, because that's more\nthan nothing, and the rule in Form 9 contains\nnothing.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, it contains a\ntime and a place. It's quite specific that there was\nan accident and that defendant, defendant of a\ncertain name at a certain time and place negligently\ndrove. What it doesn't tell you is the details of\nthe, of what was negligent, but it certainly is\nspecific in time and place and person, which is one\nof the -- one of the concerns, I mean, if you strip\naway everything, it seems that you have a suspicion\nthat there may have been a conspiracy and you want to\nuse a discovery process to find out whether or not\nthat's true. Isn't that essentially what this\ncomplaint is?\nMR. RICHARDS: That is the situation that\nany plaintiff is going to be in in a horizontal\nconspiracy case in the sense that we don't know for\ncertain that there was a conspiracy. We have\nobserved market facts which are suggestive of a\nconspiracy and we allege that there was a conspiracy.\nNow under conventional standards, all we would have\nto do is allege that there was a conspiracy and say\nwhat it was. We wouldn't have to plead a basis to\ninfer that we are correct or incorrect because that's\nnot the analysis that Rule 12(b)(6) --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But you don't\nthink you have to prove that either? I mean, you\ndon't think you have to prove anything more than what\nyou've alleged in the complaint about the background\ncontext, the parallel conduct?\nMR. RICHARDS: If the Court -- if we were\nto prove to the satisfaction of the finder of fact\nthat the conduct we have pointed to here was or would\nhave been contrary to the interests of the defendants\nin the absence of a conspiracy, we were to prove that\nas distinguished from pleading, we would satisfy\nMatsushita. Now at that stage in the case, it's\ninconceivable that there won't be all kinds of other\nmemos and, you know, real world things that will shed\nlight on why the defendants internally think they did\nthis.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: How much money do you\nthink it would have cost the defendants by then to\nassemble all of the documents that you're going to be\ninterested in looking at? How many buildings will\nhave to be rented to store those documents and how\nmany years will be expended in, in gathering all the\nmaterials?\nMR. RICHARDS: Well, to address that\nconcern, which we share, because we don't gain\nanything with Matsushita. At the end of the road in\nthe case, we don't gain anything by pursuing a case\nfor years in an unnecessarily burdensome way if we\nare not sure that it's going to prevail. So we\nproposed in this case a phased discovery process,\npursuant to which you would first have discovery into\nconspiracy, and then the Court would have an early\nopportunity for a Matsushita motion and we either\ncarry the day at that point or we don't. That's\ndiscovery.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: At what point does it\nget characterized as a class action, before this\ndiscovery or after?\nMR. RICHARDS: It's at the Court's\ndiscretion when to entertain the motion for class\ncertification. In this particular case the\ndefendants, a couple of the defendants proposed that\nwe include in that phased discovery proposal class\ncertification as an additional subject of that first\nphase of discovery, and we would be amenable to that\nas a compromise. But the point, getting back to\nJustice Scalia's point, that discovery as to whether\nthere was a conspiracy in this case in order to\nsatisfy that first phased analysis, would not need to\nbe terribly burdensome and wouldn't necessarily be\nmore burdensome than all kinds of other cases. It's\nreally a very targeted issue. I think it's actually\nan appropriate way to deal with cases of this kind\nand it's actually a way that the Court has proposed\ndealing with similar issues in the past in the\nAnderson versus Creighton case.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, how would it\nbe focused if you're talking about whether it's in\ntheir economic interest? You would have to say why,\nwhy didn't you enter into this particular realm of\ncompetition and they would say, well because we were\ndoing other things. We had other areas that we were\nfocusing on. And they would have to document all\nthat to your satisfaction.\nMR. RICHARDS: We'd -- we would ask for\nproduction of documents reflecting their thinking\nprocess about entering into one another's\nterritories. And that would be very enlightening.\nAnd after we get those documents we would have a much\nclearer idea and be able to share with the Court a\nmuch clearer idea of the entire picture of a kind\nthat we can't have at the 12(b)(6) stage.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you\nMr. Richard, Mr. Kellogg, you have four minutes\nremaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT BY MICHAEL KELLOGG,\nON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS\nMR. KELLOGG: Thank you. Your Honor.\nI have three quick points that I would\nlike to make. First following up on Justice\nGinsburg's point, the private plaintiffs do not have\nan authority to issue purely investigative\ncomplaints. The Department of Justice of course can\nissue civil investigative demands, but for private\nplaintiffs the price of admission even to discovery,\nparticularly to the sort of massive discovery at\nissue here, is to establish some basis for thinking\nthe plaintiff -- the defendants have done something\nwrong. In that regard, in the Trinko case, the\nplaintiffs there specifically alleged that the\ndefendants were engaged in actions against self\ninterest by not cooperating with new entrants. And\nwhat the Court did is it went behind that mere\nallegation, looked at the complaint, looked at facts\nconcerning the industry, looked at the statute,\nregulatory rulings and said that's ridiculous. Of\ncourse it is in the self interest of the incumbents\nto not go out of their way to cooperate with new\nentrants to allow them to take business away.\nNow the flip side, the second half of the\nconspiracy that the plaintiffs alleged here is our\nfailure to enter new markets. And it's important to\nrecognize that they are suggesting we should have\nrelied upon a regulatory regime that we were\nsuccessfully challenging in the courts. We got it\nstruck down three separate times, and it was simply\nnot a viable business opportunity in light of those\nfacts and there is no reason to suggest that it was\nanything but in the self interest of the defendants\nto decline to enter these markets. Even conscious\nparallelism is not sufficient to state a claim under\nthe antitrust laws. And at best, that is what we\nhave here, and as a consequence they failed to state\na claim.\nIf the Court has further questions? I\nhave nothing further.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\n"
