SCHLEIMER\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. SCHLEIMER: Thank you, Mr. Chief\nJustice, and may it please the Court:\nIt's been a little less than two years since\nthis Court handed down the decision in Buckeye Check\nCashing Service v. Cardegna. Within nine months after\nBuckeye was decided, the California Court of Appeal\nissued its decision in this case excising the issue of\nvalidity or legality of a contract from an entire\ncategory of arbitrations, declaring it off limits to\narbitration.\nThe contract in this case couldn't be more\nclear. It states quite specifically that the validity\nor legality of the contract shall be arbitrated. So\nthere was no consideration given to the intent of the\nparties.\nThe Federal Arbitration Act, of course,\napplies in this case. There was never really a dispute\nabout that, because it'S a contract between the citizens\nof two States and it was never disputed that the Federal\nArbitration Act would apply.\nIf left standing, the decision in this case\ncould result in a multiplicity of State law decisions\nand statutes eliminating arbitration in entire classes\nof cases through the mere expediency of having it go to\nan administrative agency.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, It wouldn't\neliminate it. Your friend on the other side says it the\nsimply delays it, because you get to arbitrate de novo\nafter the commissioner's decision.\nMR. SCHLEIMER: Well, the assertion that we\nget to arbitrate de novo is new in this Court. In the\ncourts below the parties agreed, and both sides briefed,\nthe fact that the de novo would be heard by the superior\ncourt, not by the arbitrator. I don't know what -- by\nwhat magical process the Respondent would think that we\nwould get to arbitrate the de novo, because the statute\non which the court of appeal based its jurisdictional\nholding, Labor Code Section 1700.44, that's where the\nlabor commissioner gets jurisdiction from the same\nstatute and says the superior court hears the de novo.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I guess I\ncould let him answer, but I suppose he would say you go\nto that court, and you get a motion to compel\narbitration.\nMR. SCHLEIMER: Well, we have brought a\nmotion to compel arbitration, which was denied based on\n1700.44.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I couldn't find the order\nthat the court -- in the record it says that the order\nwould be -- the court granted a preliminary injunction,\nthe superior court, and then it said, according to an\norder to be entered by the clerk. How long was the\narbitration stayed for? There was an enjoined -- there\nwas an injunction. What was the term of the injunction?\nJust until further order of the court?\nMR. SCHLEIMER: The injunction states -- and\nI'm implying this, because it doesn't actually state how\nlong it lasts -- the injunction was requested and it was\ngranted with just the word \"grant.\" So I interpret it\nas meaning that what was granted was what was requested,\nand what was requested was an injunction that would last\nuntil the Labor Commissioner determined that she doesn't\nhave jurisdiction. Now, since the Labor Commissioner\nhad already determined that she does have jurisdiction,\nit's effectively permanent or, as you say,\nJustice Kennedy, until the court vacates it.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Did the Respondent at any\npoint indicate that after the Labor Commission, Labor\nCommissioner, made a determination that they would not\ngo to superior court for de novo review?\nMR. SCHLEIMER: Well, they actually had in a\nsense an opportunity to do exactly that and chose not\nto. The motion for reconsideration was brought before\nthe Labor -- before the arbitrator one day before the\ninjunction hearing. The arbitrator said: Well, it's\ninefficient to have parallel proceedings and maybe I can\nbenefit from the Labor Commissioner's advice in this.\nSo while retaining his jurisdiction, he said: I'm going\nto stay the arbitration until the Labor Commissioner\nrules.\nNow, at that point the Respondent could have\nsimply withdrawn the injunction and said, fine, we'll do\nit the way the arbitrator says; what the arbitrator\nwants, the arbitrator shall get. Instead, the next day\nthe arbitrator's decision became moot. Now, I think the\narbitrator, acting with an injunction looming the next\nday, was proposing in a sense a kind of compromise: You\ncan both have a little bit of what you want. It's not\nunusual in arbitrations for that to happen.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, you may have a\nright to go to arbitration under this context, to\nproceed at once to arbitration. But could you stop a\nparallel proceeding from going on before the Labor\nCommission? In other words, your adversary says under\nthe arbitration contract I'm stuck, I have to arbitrate\nat once, but I can go to the Labor Commission; there's\nnothing in the Federal Arbitration Act that says I can't\ndo that.\nMR. SCHLEIMER: Justice Ginsburg, I think\nthat if the motion to compel arbitration had been\ngranted -- remember there were two motions pending, my\nmotion to compel arbitration and the Respondent's motion\nfor an injunction to stop the arbitration.\nIf the motion to compel arbitration had been\ngranted, I think that would have been in effect a\nmandamus to Judge Ferrer that he had to arbitrate and\nnot proceed.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I would have thought you\nwould -- you would say that when you have a contract\nwhich says that any disputes under this shall be\narbitrated pursuant to the rules of the AAA or whatever,\nthat that does automatically exclude a parallel\nproceeding. Otherwise, provisions like that make no\nsense at all; they achieve nothing.\nMR. SCHLEIMER: Justice Scalia, I would\ncertainly agree that it's a breach of the contract to\nfile a parallel proceeding. The question, of course, is\nspecific performance.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: What do you -- what do you\nmake, in answering Justice Scalia's question, what do\nyou make of the fact that this contract included, I\nguess, a choice of law provision to the effect that\nCalifornia law applies, and if California law comes in\nso does the jurisdiction of the Labor Commissioner? So\nthat in effect you have implicitly agreed to take the\nLabor Commissioner as well as agreeing to arbitrate, and\nthe argument is the Labor Commissioner comes first.\nMR. SCHLEIMER: Well, Justice Souter, I have\ntwo responses to that. My first is that, since there's\nan express agreement to arbitrate validity or legality,\nthat there is certainly no basis for saying that there's\nsome implied intent to contradict the express agreement.\nThe second is that, assuming for a moment\nthat we have incorporated California law wholesale, and\nCalifornia has a lot of law, one of the laws that\nCalifornia has, as set forth in the case I cited,\nQualcomm v. Nokia, a Federal Circuit decision in 2006\nunder California law, California law has a rule that if\nyou incorporate the AAA rules into your agreement, you\nmeet the First Option standard that you have agreed to\narbitrate arbitrability.\nNow, if we have incorporated California law,\nwe have incorporated the law that says the arbitrator's\ndecision, his initial decision saying I've got\njurisdiction, let's hear some evidence, then that's\nincorporated in California law --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Do you agree that the\nquestion of implicit option of California law is at\nissue in the case as it gets to us?\nMR. SCHLEIMER: I don't believe that Volt is\nproperly in the case. If you look at the court of\nappeals decision, the decision is based on jurisdiction,\nit's not based on intent of the parties. Volt is all\nabout the intent of the parties that you imply from a\nchoice of law clause. And if the intent of the parties\nis so clearly expressed that we're going to arbitrate a\nparticular issue, I don't think you even get to an\nimplied intention.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Why isn't that an issue in\nthe case, unless you're waiving the issue? Wouldn't it\nbe a question of contract interpretation as to the\nmeaning of the choice of law provision that should be\ndecided by the arbitrator? Unless you want to waive\nthat argument.\nMR. SCHLEIMER: I that that Volt should be\nrejected. But in the alternative, I think under First\nOptions it should be remanded to the arbitrator. If\nthey want to make an argument that we didn't intend to\narbitrate arbitrability, even though California law is\nper se on that point in our favor, then you have the\noption of remanding that question to the arbitrator.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, I have to\nconfess I've never understood these choice of alaw\nprovisions. You incorporate California law. I assume\nCalifornia law is interpreted consistent with Federal\nlaw. If Federal law preempts California law, that's\nwhat you're incorporating. It always struck me as kind\nof circular.\nMR. SCHLEIMER: Well, I think lawyers do it\nreflexively because out of fear that somehow the law in\nsome other State that they don't know is going to wind\nup being the conflict of law --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: When you say\nCalifornia law applies, you don't mean to the exclusion\nof Federal law?\nMR. SCHLEIMER: Of course not. I mean, if\none incorporates California law, one doesn't incorporate\npre-empted California law.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Nor do you mean that\nCalifornia applies even when it contradicts the express\nprovisions of your agreement? I mean, the specific\ngoverns of the general?\nMR. SCHLEIMER: Absolutely. The Federal\nArbitration Act is all about effectuating the intent of\nthe parties to expeditiously and privately decide the\nissue.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I must say that the Volt\ncase is written in rather sweeping language that's not\nparticularly helpful to you. On its facts, I think it's\ndifferent because there were other parties, independent\nparties in the litigation. Don't you think that's the\nbest way to distinguish Volt in your case?\nMR. SCHLEIMER: Certainly. To that I would\nadd the observation that under Volt, since there were\nparties that were not bound by arbitration, you are\ngoing to have all the expense of the other lawsuits,\nanyway. So, you have in terms of the efficiency of the\nproceeding, in Volt you were going to have a\nmultiplication of litigation no matter what you did.\nHere that's not true. The only reason we had a\nmultiplication of litigation is because Judge Ferrer\nfiled a Labor Commissioner petition and then a Superior\nCourt lawsuit.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, would you\nhave any problem with a California law that said you can\narbitrate but the arbitrator must allow the Labor\nCommissioner to file an amicus brief?\nMR. SCHLEIMER: I don't know the Labor\nCommissioner has ever attempted that. I wouldn't be\nconcerned about it. I know --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if it goes on\nand says, and you must allow the Labor Commissioner to\nappear at the arbitration?\nMR. SCHLEIMER: Well, that is what 1700.45\nsays for talent agents. In 20 years I've never heard of\nthe Labor Commissioner doing that. But I can't imagine\nanyone is going to be awfully concerned about it. I\ncertainly wouldn't be. If the Labor Commissioner wanted\nto attend, they would be welcome. I don't think that's\nbased on a legal right because my client's a personal\nmanager and isn't regulated by the talent agency --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, what if it says\nyou've got to wait for 30 days to allow the Labor\nCommissioner to consider whether or not to intervene?\nMR. SCHLEIMER: I'm not sure -- I\ncertainly -- personally, in this case no problem with\nthat. I don't think that's how it works. The statute\nsimply requires notice and an opportunity to attend; and\nthere's no issue in this case as to whether the Labor\nCommissioner was deprived of that, because we never got\nto that point.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Does the Labor\nCommissioner have authority to commence proceedings on\nhis own motion or her own motion?\nMR. SCHLEIMER: It's a little bit\ncomplicated.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I'm sorry that I\nasked already.\nMR. SCHLEIMER: I have an answer for you.\nThe Labor Commissioner is considered a peace officer\nunder California law. They actually have the power to\narrest. At one point many years ago, there was an\narrest of a manager for soliciting and procuring. He\ngot Jane Wyman a job on a TV show called \"Falcon Crest,\"\nand there was an arrest and there was a criminal statute\nat that time. And the legislature responded to this\nincident by repealing the criminal statute.\nSo the only action the legislature has had\nsince deregulating the managers and taking them out of\nthe statute entirely was removing the criminal\nenforcement power. In terms of the Labor Commissioner's\ncivil enforcement powers, there are statutes. The first\nhundred sections in the labor code do give the Labor\nCommissioner certain intervention powers. But, reading\nthose statutes, they would seem to apply in wage cases\nand confiscation of tools, that sort of thing. They\ndon't really mention -- now would the Labor\nCommissioner -- if the Labor Commissioner wanted to\nintervene, I think that if you take the penumbra of all\nthese statutes probably the Labor Commissioner could.\nI think, even though there's not in my 20\nyears handling these cases been a situation where the\nLabor Commissioner filed any kind of a civil proceeding,\neverybody assumes the Labor Commissioner could seek an\ninjunction if they wanted to. It just doesn't occur\nbecause they're busy doing things like collecting wages.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Could the arbitrator\ndecide, I know I'm not required to do this but the Labor\nCommissioner is the expert and I'd rather wait until the\nLabor Commissioner acted before I proceed with the\narbitration?\nMR. SCHLEIMER: Well, in a sense, under the\ngun of the injunction hearing the next day, that's what\nthe arbitrator did.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Take out the exception.\nThe arbitrator just thinks that it would be good to have\nthe advice of the Labor Commissioner because the\narbitrator is not so familiar with these talent agency\narrangements.\nMR. SCHLEIMER: I would certainly protest,\nbut the arbitrator undoubtedly has the power to wait for\nthe Labor Commissioner to render an advisory decision.\nIn a sense that's what the arbitrator did. In a moment\nof I think irrational exuberance he talked about the\nexpertise of the Labor Commissioner.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How was the\narbitrator chosen? Does he or she have any particular\nexpertise in this area?\nMR. SCHLEIMER: Yes. Mr. Bosch has 32 years\nas an entertainment lawyer. He knows the Talent Agency\nAct considerable better than any of the civil service\nlawyers at the Labor Commissioner. That's why I\nreferred to it as irrational exuberance, because the\nLabor Commissioner -- some of them get pretty good and\nthen they move on to other jobs, and you wind up with\npeople who hear wage claims.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: If you go to the superior\ncourt for de novo review, can you ask the superior court\nfor an order enforcing its decision?\nMR. SCHLEIMER: Enforcing the Labor\nCommissioner's decision?\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, you get de novo\nreview. So do you ask the court for an order -- a\ndeclaratory order, declaring that the person is a talent\nagent or is not a talent agent?\nMR. SCHLEIMER: Well, that is what Judge\nFerrer asked the superior court to do, was first send\nthis to the Labor Commissioner. Then specifically the\ncomplaint by Judge Ferrer sought declaratory relief,\nthat the arbitration is void, the guy is an illegal\ntalent agent, so he should never be allowed to\narbitrate. That was the declaratory relief that was\nsought.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So do you think it would\nbe within the authority of the superior court to say\nthis is a judgment binding on the parties and the\narbitration will not proceed, or must proceed\nconsistently with my order?\nMR. SCHLEIMER: Well, absent -- our position\nis that that's preemptive, of course. Absent the\narbitration agreement, it would be the superior court\nthat would decide it.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes. Well, but if the\nRespondent prevails, don't you think that the superior\ncourt has that authority?\nMR. SCHLEIMER: If the Respondent prevails\nin the Labor Commissioner?\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: If Respondent prevails in\nthis case, don't you think that the superior court can\nthen say that its declaration is final and the\narbitration shall not proceed?\nMR. SCHLEIMER: The position I've taken from\nthe beginning, including in my briefs to the court of\nappeals was yes, that if the decision is correct, if\nthis Court affirms the court of appeals, that the\nde novo would go to the superior court. Now, it is a\ntrue de novo; in other words, it's not deferential to\nthe Labor Commissioner. It's simply a complete\nrehearing from scratch of the whole case.\nBut it has always been my position and it\nwas until we got to this Court the Respondent's position\nthat the de novo would go to the superior court.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What is it -- I should know\nthis, but I don't. Imagine that Jones and Smith, civil\nengineers, builders, enter into a contract. They have\nan arbitration provision suspiciously like this one. It\nsays we promise to arbitrate everything, any dispute,\nincluding a dispute about whether this agreement is\nlegal or not itself. They have that. They go to the\narbitrator.\nJones says: You know, Mr. Arbitrator, you\ndon't know that much about civil engineering, but\nthere's a judge here who does. So I think what I'm\ngoing to do tomorrow is file a lawsuit in the superior\ncourt in California making the same claims I'm making\nhere and maybe that judge will decide it first and then\nyou'll be really helped. Now what stops him from doing\nthat in the law?\nMR. SCHLEIMER: Well, the Federal\nArbitration Act and the California Arbitration --\nJUSTICE BREYER: The Federal -- the Federal\nArbitration Act says what that makes it clear he can't\ndo that?\nMR. SCHLEIMER: Well --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I mean, I grant you if he\ncan do it you might as well tear up the Federal\nArbitration Act and throw it out the window. But I just\nwant to know what is it in the law specifically that\nstops him from doing that.\nMR. SCHLEIMER: Well, I think in Section 3\nwould -- there should be a stay of the judicial\nproceedings so that the arbitration can proceed.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But that's not positive\nFederal law. What stops him from doing it is the\ncontractual agreement, isn't it, between the parties?\nThe FAA just says that the State will not set aside that\ncontractual agreement.\nMR. SCHLEIMER: Yes, Justice Scalia. The\nobligation comes from the contract.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So even though it's not --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: When we say we'll arbitrate\nall disputes under this contract, it means we'll\narbitrate all disputes under this contract; neither one\nof us will go to court.\nMR. SCHLEIMER: I think that's doubly so if\nyou incorporate the rules of the American Arbitration\nAssociation, which provides you with the maximum\nbreadth.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, but that -- that's\nwhat I'm driving at, and I think that's interesting,\nthat there's an implicit -- because it doesn't say it\nexplicitly -- there's an implicit promise not to\nundermine this contract by running off to court.\nMR. SCHLEIMER: I think it's a covenant of\ngood faith and fair dealing. If you agree to do it you\nshould do it.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. And so you\ncan't -- no case comes to your mind where anybody has\ntried that little end run? And --\nMR. SCHLEIMER: I think there are a couple\n--\nJUSTICE BREYER: I agree, I don't see how\nthey could, but I just want to get to the bottom of it.\nMR. SCHLEIMER: I think this entire area of\njurisprudence involves pre-dispute arbitration\nagreements and then some party decides it's not to my\nadvantage and they run to court. That's almost every\ncase.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I used to teach contract\nlaw, and I am sure that when you say you'll arbitrate,\nit means you won't litigate. And even if I didn't ever\nteach contract law, it would still be the law.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought Buckeye was --\nwas such a case, going to court despite the arbitration\nagreement.\nMR. SCHLEIMER: At -- at the time we were in\nthe superior court, Buckeye had not yet been decided.\nWe were -- in December of 2005 was the injunction\nhearing, and Buckeye I believe was published in February\nof 2006.\nI relied on the California case, the\nErickson case, which made Prima Paint the law of\nCalifornia, and it wasn't persuasive. Then Buckeye was\nhanded down while we were on appeal. But I certainly,\nwhen I read Buckeye, I said that's my price, because\nPrima Paint was about fraud in the inducement. We were\nin a situation where we were dealing with an attack on\nthe legality of the entire contract and I read Buckeye\nand said, that's my case.\nMr. Chief Justice, if there's no further\nquestions, I'd like to reserve my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Brunstad.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF G. ERIC BRUNSTAD, JR.\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe California Talent Agencies Act does not\ninvalidate the arbitration agreement between Mr. Preston\nand Judge Ferrer. At most, it merely postpones\narbitration --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, the question is\nobvious. The question just follows from what I said.\nYou were there nodding your head when everybody seems\nseemed to agree that the Jones versus Smith, they can't\ngo run off to court. So you're just about to address\nthis, and I hope you'll include the answer to the\nquestion, which is if they can't run off to the\nFederal -- to the State court judge, the superior court\njudge, to get his opinion on the matter, why can they\nrun off to this man, namely the talent agency expert --\nMR. BRUNSTAD: The Labor Commissioner --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- who happens to be an\nadministrative agency? Why does it matter?\nMR. BRUNSTAD: I think to answer your\nquestion, Justice Breyer, it's helpful just to delineate\nthe procedure of how it's supposed to work. You're\nsupposed to go to the California Labor Commissioner\nfirst if there's any controversy arising under the\nCalifornia Talent Agencies Act. That is an exhaustion\nof administrative remedies concept that the California\nSupreme Court articulated in Styne v Stevens. After the\nCalifornia Talent Agencies Act has been administered by\nthe Labor Commissioner, either party has as of right the\nability to take an appeal to the California Superior\nCourt, at which point all of the California arbitration\nrules apply, and a motion to compel arbitration could be\nmade at that point and arbitration could happen. And\nnow it's a de novo hearing from the Labor Commissioner's\nproceeding, which means under California law, the\nWaisbren case and the Buchwald case, that it's as though\nthe Labor Commissioner proceeding had not happened at\nall. The --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Did you take a position\nbelow? Your friend says that this is brand new up here.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: It's not brand new,\nJustice Scalia. We never got that far.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Did you take that position\nbelow, was the question.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: We never took that position\nbelow because we never got that far, Justice Kennedy.\nWe only got to the point whether we should have a\npreliminary injunction so that the Labor Commissioner\ncould go first. Once the Labor Commissioner --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: The arbitrator already\nagreed to do that. You didn't need the injunction for\nthat purpose.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Well, the motion for the\ninjunction was filed because the arbitrator initially\ndenied a stay of arbitration. The arbitrator himself\nthen reconsidered his ruling a day before the hearing on\nthe injunction, and the arbitrator said I'd like to hear\nfrom the Labor Commissioner because the Labor\nCommissioner is expert.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well -- but if your\nposition is that we have to preserve the integrity of\nthe State system, the Labor expert and so forth and the\nState builds in to that procedure, de novo review\nSuperior Court, it seems to me rather difficult for you\nto now just say oh, well, the Superior Court doesn't\nmake any difference.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Well, Justice Kennedy, I\nthink that it is important -- this goes back to\nJustice Breyer's question. Why is it a de novo\nproceeding? Well, in the Sinnamon case, which we cite\nin our brief, there are constitutional reasons under the\nCalifornia's constitution. The Labor Commissioner\ndoesn't exercise any judicial authority and does not\nhave the power to finally decide this controversy. The\nLabor Commissioner is merely exercising her\nadministrative power over this dispute because this is\npart of a comprehensive regulatory scheme.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why would you want this to\nhappen? Why -- who would imagine such a system in which\nyou bring it to the Labor Commissioner and you prevent\nthe matter from being resolved immediately with an\narbitrator. I don't know how long does it take for the\nLabor Commissioner? I don't know.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: On average 8 months, Justice\nScalia.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Eight months. But then\nwhen he's done --\nMR. BRUNSTAD: She, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: She. No matter what\nhappens, you go back to the arbitrator. Who in his\nright mind would set up such a system?\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Well, there are valid\nreasons. There are very compelling reasons why\nCalifornia set up this system. California law says if\nyou're going to act like a talent agent, you're going to\nprocure employment -- that's the touchstone -- you're\nacting as a talent agency, you're supposed to submit\nyour contracts in advance for pre-approval from the\nLabor Commissioner. You're supposed to bring your\ndisputes there. That's how the Labor Commissioner\nlearns of disputes. The Labor Commissioner is supposed\nto develop this body of law by interpreting it. All --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: This person is not a talent\nagent.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: The is person is a talent\nagent, Justice Scalia. He was operating to procure\nemployment. And the statute says anyone who even\nattempts to procure employment is a talent agent, and\nthat is all that Mr. Preston did.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Normally we say that\nthose types of disputes are for the arbitrator to\ndecide. The theory is that the arbitrator can apply the\nexisting law as well as a court, and if that's the\ntheory, couldn't the arbitrator apply the existing law\nas well as an agency?\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Chief Justice Roberts, there\nare other things that the Labor Commissioner is invested\nwith jurisdiction to do. The Labor Commissioner has to\nfind out about these disputes. How does she find out?\nBecause parties bring these petitions. This is a great\ndeterrent for people from violating the California\nTalent Agencies Act. It works because the dispute has\nto come before her. She knows who the bad apples are.\nShe knows she can go to get injunctive relief if she\nneeds to. Her expertise is advanced. She gets to\ndecide the controversy initially. And it merely\npostpones arbitration. And critically, this is --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, that may be great as\na means of informing the Labor Commissioner, but it\nvirtually destroys the value of arbitration --\nMR. BRUNSTAD: No, but the --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- because the\nexpeditiousness of arbitration is gone once you start\ndown the California procedural road. They don't want to\ngo to arbitration 8 to 12 months later. They want it\nnow.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: No, Justice Souter, it's\nactually enhanced. It's enhanced for all the reasons\nthat, when exert brings his or her expertise to bear,\nyou can get a settlement; you get expedited resolution\nthe issues get refind. Most parties don't go to\narbitration after this because --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Then they probably\nshouldn't have agreed to arbitrate, but they did agree\nto arbitrate, and they want to arbitrate now. And one\nof the points of arbitration is to get the ball rolling\nfast, and that cannot be done under the system you are\narguing for.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: But, Justice Souter, this is\nwhat they bargained for. They bargained for the\napplication of California law under the --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Did you make that argument\nbelow, that implicitly they have imported the California\nlabor scheme in as a -- in effect, as a condition\nprecedent to the arbitration?\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Yes, Justice Souter, we cited\nthe Volt case before the California court of appeal.\nNow, the other side did not raise --\nJUSTICE BREYER: It sounds as if you made\nthe argument -- well, you say we cited a case.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: But, Justice Breyer, they did\nnot raise the pre-emption argument at all.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay. The answer to\nJustice Souter's question is no, we didn't raise it\nbelow. Is that right?\nMR. BRUNSTAD: We did by responding to their\nargument. We did cite Volt. The only other --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But you didn't go further\nthan to decide that case. Is that correct?\nMR. BRUNSTAD: We did not go further than to\ncite Volt, but let me --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Volt involves a third\nparty who is not party to the arbitration agreement.\nYou have a party who is bound nonetheless invoking the\nLabor Commission to avoid going immediately to\narbitration. Volt is very clear. It involves a third\nparty, litigation involving a third party who is not\nbound by the arbitration agreement. Here you have only\ntwo parties. They are both bound by the arbitration\nagreement. I don't see how you can invoke Volt.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Because Volt simply was about\n-- a case about postponing arbitration in favor of\nlitigation going forward, which has actually had a\ngreater impact --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Litigation involving a\nperson who couldn't be brought into the arbitration.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: True, but --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: It makes sense to say\nthat piece of it involving a party who can't be before\nthe arbitrator should be -- should be -- go first. But\nhere you don't have anybody who isn't bound to go before\nthe arbitrator. You have no third party.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Except the Labor Commissioner\nherself who is supposed to do these administrative\nprocedures for all kinds of validate and compelling\nState court -- State law reasons.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Judgment involved would\nhave been binding --\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- on the third parties.\nYou don't -- and you assert that the judgment here\nwouldn't be binding at all. It's just because the Labor\nCommissioner, he or she, is such an expert on this --\nyour opponent says she's not at all --\nMR. BRUNSTAD: She is, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I imagine that's\nhighly debatable.\nIt's a different case where you say you have\nto wait for a court decision which will be conclusive as\nto many of the people in the case.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: But, Justice Scalia, in Volt,\nthe State court litigation went forward, the related\nlitigation. It could have res judicata/collateral\nestoppel effects on the arbitration. It has even more\nof an impact on arbitration --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You said something about\nthat in your brief, and I think that you got it wrong.\nYou said something about -- that the outcome of the\nlitigation can have preclusive effect in the\narbitration. But that would be so only if the result\nfavored the non-party to the litigation, because the\nnon-party to the litigation cannot be bound by a\njudgment that would adversely affect that party's\ninterest. That party wasn't in the proceeding. It\nisn't bound by it. The parties to the litigation are\nbound by it, not the non-parties to the litigation.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: True, Justice Ginsburg, but\nat least it can bind one of the parties and therefore\ntie the hands of the arbitrator in the subsequent\nproceeding. Here this is not possible. The parties\nbargained for this in their agreement when they\nbargained for the application of California law.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Could California law do\nthis? I mean could they say, you know, we have a\nproblem. By the way, this is just a hypothetical. We\nthink that our judges in the Superior Court don't know\nvery much about building disputes.\nNow, I say it is a hypothetical because, in\nfact, Superior Court judges in California are excellent\njudges. But California thinks, no, they don't know\nenough about it. So here's what we do. We say when\nJones and Smith enter into an arbitration agreement, if\nit happens to concern a building dispute, they have to\ngo to Federal -- they can go to the Superior Court. In\nfact, if they want to, if one of them wants to, the\nother one doesn't. And everything is delayed while the\nSuperior Court judge decides all the issues in the case.\nAnd then after they can go back to arbitration, if of\ncourse they still want to. Could California do that?\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Well, if that's what parties\nbargained for, that was their agreement. It would be --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I've read the agreement,\nand I don't quite find their -- here --\nMR. BRUNSTAD: But I understand your\nhypothetical --\nJUSTICE BREYER: In my mind is what they do\nis they have the same standard arbitration clause. So\nI'm asking not about the parties; I'm asking about\nCalifornia.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: No, Justice Breyer.\nJUSTICE BREYER: No. The answer is no. I\nthought so. And so now you explain to me how this is\nany different than what I just said, other than\nsubstituting the words \"Labor Commissioner\" for\n\"California Superior Court\" and substituting the words\n\"talent dispute\" for the words \"building dispute.\"\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Because here what the Labor\nCommissioner does is not what a court does. \"Labor\nCommissioner\" is not synonymous with \"the court\" and\ncannot be under California's constitution. Here you\nhave a complete, again, arbitration postponing rule and\nnothing more. The arbitrator's hands are not tied in\nany way; whereas the arbitrator's hands would be tied if\nin fact you had court litigation that was conclusive\nbetween the --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No. His hypothetical was\nthat the court decision would just be advisory and the\narbitrator could ignore it.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Well, that would be --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Just get, you know, a\nknowledgeable person's input.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: But, Justice Scalia, that\nwould be inconsistent with the arbitration clause\nitself. Here, however, it is not. Here the parties\nbargained for the application of California law.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: This contract said the same\nthing. This contract will be governed by California\nlaw.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Right.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Would it suck up this\nprovision that says you have to go to the Superior\nCourt?\nMR. BRUNSTAD: No.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No. I don't think so\neither.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: But here it would, yes,\nbecause California law requires you to go to the Labor\nCommissioner first, not to --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, I guess that would be\na question for the arbitrator.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I just want to understand\nyour position. In this case, does the California\nprovision for de novo review in the Superior Court apply\nto stay the arbitration while that aspect of the\nproceeding is completed?\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Under California law -- it is\nCalifornia law -- you must go to the labor commissioner\nfirst before you go either to court or the arbitrator.\nYou must go to the arbitrator second.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: My question was: You go\nto the labor commissioner. You also have a de novo\nright to go to the superior court.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: That is correct.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose the labor\ncommissioner said something absolutely silly. Wouldn't\nyou think you would have the right to go to the Superior\nCourt?\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Either side -- either side\ncan go to the superior court.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And it would make no sense\nto do that and -- and not to also stay the arbitration.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Justice Kennedy, I think the\nproblem I'm having with your question is that I think\nyou are assuming that there's an arbitration in place\nwhile the labor commissioner is going forward.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: No. Now, we have this\ncase. We have an arbitration clause.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: We do.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: The arbitrator is waiting.\nYou go to the labor commissioner, you go to the superior\ncourt to say enjoin the arbitration while I go to the\nlabor commissioner.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Correct.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: The labor commissioner\ndoes something silly. Can you not then go to superior\ncourt and get de novo review of that wrong decision of\nthe labor commissioner before the arbitration starts?\nMR. BRUNSTAD: No, Justice Kennedy, because\nonce --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Have you taken that\nposition consistently in this litigation?\nMR. BRUNSTAD: We never got there, Justice\nKennedy. We never got to the --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: You have taken no position\non it either way?\nMR. BRUNSTAD: We took the position that the\nsuperior court should stay the arbitration because you\nhave to exhaust the administrative remedies first; and,\nconsistent with the Federal Arbitration Act, Section 2,\nthere might be grounds for invalidating this Arbitration\nAct.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Is there any California case\nthat says that this works this way? That after the\nproceeding is finished before the labor commissioner,\nthe parties have a right to go to arbitration before\nthere's de novo review in the superior court?\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Specifically, Justice Alito,\nno. What the California courts have decided is that\nthere is a de novo right, and --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: A de novo right in\nSuperior Court?\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Yes. But the California\nSupreme Court has also said, in construing its own\narbitration act, which is Section 1281, which is\nbasically the same as Section 2 of the FAA -- said,\nlook, when we have a right to go to court if you have an\narbitration proceeding, the -- a motion to compel\narbitration must be granted unless, for example, the\narbitration clause is invalid for some reason.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right, you at least\nhave that additional step. It is -- particularly since\nyou only have 10 days to appeal from the labor\ncommissioner, someone who wants to arbitrate has to\nappeal, has to go to superior court and get a motion to\ncompel.\nYou can't even wait to see if your opponent\ngoes to superior court and -- well, if he has won, he\nwouldn't go into court. But you have to go to the court\nto get a motion to compel? You can't just go ahead and\nproceed with arbitration.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Well, the parties could\nvoluntarily do that. But, yes, if you don't do the de\nnovo proceeding, then the labor commissioner's decision\nbecomes binding.\nSo you must take the step of doing the\nnotice of appeal and then do a motion to compel.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. You say -- I\nthought you said it doesn't become binding. That it is\njust advice to the arbitrator. Once you -- once you get\nthe remand to the arbitrator, it is not binding.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: No, Justice Scalia. If I\nmade that impression, I'm sorry. I was mistaken. What\nI am saying is that if -- if -- you have a right to take\nan appeal to the California Superior Court.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Right.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: And once you get to the\nCalifornia Superior Court, then, under Section 1281, you\nhave a right to move to compel for arbitration, just as\nunder the Federal Arbitration Act.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But --\nMR. BRUNSTAD: If do you not do those\nthings, if you do not take the appeal, then the labor\ncommissioner's -- by default, her ruling becomes\nbinding. So you have to do the appellate process, and\nyou must file a motion.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And if you -- and if\nyou are successful and get from the superior court an\norder to compel arbitration, your opponent can then\nappeal it, I assume.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Your opponent can appeal the\ndecision compelling the arbitration if it were\nimproperly granted, yes.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Are you telling us that\nunder no circumstance, if you prevail in this case,\nwould you go to the superior court for de novo review\nand -- and, as part of that, stay the arbitration?\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Justice Kennedy, if the\narbitration clause is valid and applicable, we will go\nto arbitration. That validity and applicability has not\nbeen tested by any court below. For example, are there\ngrounds --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: All right. Let's assume\nthe arbitration clause is valid.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Yes, we will go to\narbitration.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Even though in this case\nyou have assumed that that arbitration has to be stayed\nfor the labor commissioner. So the case does not have\nto be stayed, and you would not ask for it to be stayed,\nin the superior court?\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Labor commissioner goes\nfirst. Then, we go to arbitration. If this Court rules\nthat the labor commissioner's jurisdiction is preempted,\nthen we go back to the -- to the lower court. If the\narbitration clause is valid and applicable, we will go\nto arbitration. That is correct. Chief Justice\nRoberts, you asked a question about the --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Brunstad, I'm looking\nat the point in which you said this in your brief. You\nsaid you go to the labor commission, and then you go to\nthe Superior Court. This is page 13 of your brief.\nThe court is required to grant a motion\ncompelling arbitration if the parties have executed a\nvalid and applicable arbitration agreement.\nWell, who determines if the parties have\nexecuted a valid and applicable arbitration agreement?\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Under First Options here,\nwere it not unmistakably clear that the parties said\nthat the arbitrator should decide arbitrability, that\nwould be for the court to decide.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, we know -- this is\nnot a mystery in this contract. It says it in the\ncontract, and it says it under the AAA rules. But you\nphrased this in your brief in a way that says, well, if\nthe parties have executed a valid and applicable\narbitration agreement, that's what the superior court is\ngoing to decide. So it won't grant a motion to compel\nunless it determines that the parties have executed the\nvalid and applicable arbitration agreement.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: And what I meant in that\nlanguage, Justice Ginsburg, is simply this: For\nexample, if the arbitration clause were invalid because\nthe arbitration clause, itself, were, say, fraudulent\nor -- for something, then it would not be validate and\napplicable; or if the scope of the arbitration clause\nwere limited in some way, then the scope issue, the\narbitrability issue, is for the court to decide as this\nCourt decided in First Options.\nHere we do not have the unmistakably clear\nlanguage that the parties intended that the question of\narbitrability, itself, to be to the arbitrator. So the\ncourt would decide if, in fact, the --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Right, this is -- this is\n-- actually now we are getting to the bottom of\nsomething here, I think.\nNow, I am beginning to understand where you\nare coming from; and Volt does offer you considerable\nsupport, as I -- as I agreed.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Yes, Justice Breyer.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. Now, Volt,\nhowever, is a case, I take it, in which the stay that\nwas entered was a stay staying the arbitration pending\nthe resolution of a judicial dispute that was not\nsubject to arbitrability.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Correct.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Therefore, it seems to me\nthat the question here concerns the meaning of this\ncontract, and that's where we started.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Does this contract mean\nthat the parties who entered have promised, one, not\nthemselves to go to court? Answer: Yes.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Two, not themselves to\nbring a proceeding before this administrative agency?\nAnd that's where he says yes, and you say no.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: No.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And then is the proper\nresolution of that to say: Well, you can raise that,\ntoo, before the arbitrator?\nMR. BRUNSTAD: No, Justice Breyer.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Why not?\nMR. BRUNSTAD: And this goes to the Chief\nJustice's initial question which I have been trying to\nget to. And that is when the parties incorporated\nCalifornia law, what did they incorporate?\nWell, in Volt this Court answered: When\nthey incorporated California law, it was California law;\nnot California law with a gloss of Federal law, but\nCalifornia law. And the California Supreme Court in the\nChronus case that we cite says exactly the same thing.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Isn't that a question of\ncontract interpretation --\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Yes.\nJUSTICE ALITO: -- for the arbitrator?\nMR. BRUNSTAD: No.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Why not?\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Because that goes -- because\nI think that this Court held that it to be no in Volt.\nIt said, look, where the -- because that goes to the\napplicability, the validity, of the arbitration clause,\nitself.\nHere we don't have arbitrability, itself.\nThe First Options standard is not satisfied under this\ncase.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I don't understand --\nso you incorporate California law. I interpret that to\nmean substantive law of California.\nYou say also incorporates -- and this is\nwhat I find peculiar. California law gives you a\nprocedural right to go to the labor commission. But it\nalso gives you a procedural right to go to superior\ncourt. And, yet, you acknowledge that the arbitration\nagreement, when you say we will arbitrate, forecloses\nyour using the superior court.\nWhy doesn't it foreclose your using the\nlabor commissioner? I don't understand how you slice\nthe bologna that thin. To me, if it excludes California\nprocedures, it excludes both the labor commissioner and\nthe superior court.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Two reasons, Justice Scalia:\nFirst, in the Buckeye case, for example, the\nparties specifically selected as their choice of law the\nFederal Arbitration Act. Here the parties selected\nCalifornia law. This is no different than in Volt.\nThe second reason, Justice Scalia --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Let me -- I want to\nunderstand that answer. California law includes the\nSuperior Court as much as it includes the labor\ncommissioner.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: In Volt, Your Honor, the\nspecific law that was -- the Court said was selected was\nSection 1281 of the California Code of Civil Procedure,\nwhich applies in a California court favoring a court\nproceeding because California has this rule that says if\nyou have arbitration and related litigation, you can\nstay --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Related litigation with\nsomeone other than the parties that you bound yourself\nto arbitrate with. That involved Stanford and two\ncompanies, Stanford suing two companies or -- in\nlitigation with two companies with whom it had no\narbitration agreement.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Yes, Justice Ginsburg. But\nhere I think the Court has drawn the proper distinction\nbetween, on the one hand, Volt and, on the other hand,\nDoctor's Associates, Mastrobuono, Perry, Allied-Bruce,\nall of those cases where the Court has said if it is an\narbitration negating rule, you don't incorporate it,\nbecause that's fundamentally at war with the decision to\narbitrate.\nBut where it's merely an arbitration\npostponing rule, which was the procedural issue in Volt\nand the procedural issue here, then we respect that and\nsay that's not pre-empted, because it's not necessary to\npre-empt.\nJUSTICE ALITO: How can we decide this case\non the assumption that this is simply an arbitration\npostponing rule when there's no California case that\nsays that, do you acknowledge?\nAnd a party resisting arbitration could well\nargue that the California Code means that you go first\nto the Labor Commissioner and then, as the statute says\nexplicitly, the parties are entitled to a de novo review\nbefore the Superior Court without making any provision\nfor arbitration. Do you think it is inconceivable the\nCalifornia courts could interpret the statute to mean\nthat, that there's no room for arbitration in the -- in\nthis scheme?\nMR. BRUNSTAD: It is inconceivable,\nJustice Alito, that the California court would say that\narbitration is not permissible in this case. The\nCalifornia Supreme Court has reconciled previously in\nthe Aguilar case, which is 32 Cal. 4th 974. You had two\ndifferent provisions of law. One said you had\nnonbinding arbitration for fee disputes between\nattorneys, and the second was the California Arbitration\nAct.\nAnd the California Supreme Court said, as\nthis Court said, that it will indulge every intent to\ngive effect to such proceedings, the arbitration\nproceedings, in Section 1281. It will harmonize the\nstatutes and say if you if you have a right to\narbitrate, we will respect that and we will harmonize\nthe laws so we respect that.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So the California Supreme\nCourt would construct a system in which you get the\nadvice of this expert, the Labor Commissioner. One of\nthe parties thinks that this expert's advice is\nridiculous, just absolutely wrong.\nNow, California law generally considers the\nSuperior Court smarter than the Labor Commissioner,\nwhich is why you get de novo review before the Superior\nCourt.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: No, Justice Scalia.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No?\nMR. BRUNSTAD: No.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It is stupider than the\nLabor Commissioner.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. BRUNSTAD: No, Justice Scalia. It is\nthe California constitutional provision. Under\nCalifornia's constitution, for better or worse, you\ncannot have the Labor Commissioner --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: All right. I will amend\nit. The California Superior Court is ex officio smarter\nthan the Labor Commissioner, okay? And yet, one of the\nparties who thinks the Labor Commissioner is dead wrong\ndoesn't get a chance to have this advice corrected the\nway the California constitution envisions, by the ex\nofficio smarter Superior Court.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Justice Scalia --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And that is the scheme that\nthe California Supreme Court is going to embed in\nCalifornia law?\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Justice Scalia, bankruptcy\ncourts cannot enter final decisions, yet we know that\nthey're expert in bankruptcy law, even though they're\nsubject to de novo review in the district court.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: In this case, the Court of\nAppeals, the majority said the fact that the losing\nparty will have a right to de novo hearing, involving\nadditional time and money, does not excuse the Defendant\nfrom the legal requirement to exhaust his remedy. And I\nthink you're preserving the option to go to the Superior\nCourt, at least the contestability of the arbitration\nclause.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: But that's the case in every\nFederal Arbitration Act case, Justice Kennedy.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So that, it seems to me,\nmakes incorrect your statement in your brief that, oh,\nthis is just for eight months, so that there's very\nlittle additional time involved because of the de novo\nhearing.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: No, Justice Kennedy.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Don't you think that your\nstatement at page 34 of the brief has to be qualified in\nthat respect?\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Justice Kennedy, if we get to\nthe Superior Court -- the Labor Commissioner does her\nwork, and if the parties are not satisfied with it,\neither of them has the right to go to the Superior Court\nfor a de novo hearing and file a motion to compel\narbitration. This would be no different than any other\nArbitration Act case where, when you get to the --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But you also have the\nright to challenge what -- the accuracy of the Labor\nDepartment's finding. That's what both -- all the\njudges on the California court agreed with that. So I'm\nasking, doesn't that make -- require qualification of\nyour statement at page 34 that these procedures are\nexpeditious and informal and do not entail additional\nexpense or delay? All of --\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Yes, Justice Kennedy. Yes.\nThat is --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: That does require some\nqualification there.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Yes, Justice Kennedy, that\nis -- that is factually accurate. That is a factually\naccurate addition to what we said in our brief.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, do you --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: All right. Does it also\nrequire some qualification in you brief where, at page\n12, you say Preston clearly and repeatedly sought to\nprocure employment for Ferrer in the television\nindustry? Our rules say that you cannot raise matters\nfor the first time in this Court. And you have no\nevidence on that point.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Justice Kennedy, we never got\nto an evidentiary hearing in this case.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I know you didn't, and\nthat's why I'm questioning why you put it in your brief.\nDoesn't that require some qualification?\nMR. BRUNSTAD: It is not in the record,\nJustice Kennedy, because there is no factual record in\nthis case --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Therefore, don't make\nfactual averments here for the first time.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: It's not for the first time,\nJustice Kennedy. It was made all the way through the\nproceedings below. We never got to an evidentiary\nhearing. This case is still at the preliminary stages.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Do you think, in the\nbriefs to this Court, you can make factual statements\nthat are not in the record?\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Well, Justice Kennedy, that\nwould mean we could make no factual statements to give\nthe Court any background at all. I think it is\nundisputed; it isn't challenged by the other side.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I think they do say that\nit is disputed. They do dispute that he clearly and\nrepeatedly sought to procure employment for Ferrer.\nThat's the whole issue in the case.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: It's undisputed, that Mr.\nPreston went and arranged the meeting with Judge Ferrer\ninitially with the folks at ABC.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But they said it is --\nthey dispute that it is to procure employment.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: I think, Justice Kennedy, I\nwill concede that it is not a matter of evidence, so\nthat qualification -- I will accept that\nqualification --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: In that light, on page\n43, you say in this case, it is undisputed that Preston\nwas an unlicensed talent agent and that the contract he\ndrafted did not meet the requirements of Section 1700.\nI thought it is very much disputed whether\nhe was a talent agent at all. I thought the position\nwas -- that your opponent is taking is that he was not a\ntalent agent, that he didn't come under the statute.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: It is undisputed,\nJustice Ginsburg, that Mr. Preston never had a license.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But that's not what you\nsaid here. You say it is undisputed that Preston was an\nunlicensed talent agent. That's your statement.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Our argument,\nJustice Ginsburg, is that he was unlicensed but he was\noperating as a talent agent under section -- under the\nCalifornia Talent Agencies Act.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The latter is disputed.\nThe latter is vigorously disputed.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: That is disputed, Justice\nScalia. And they have disputed that. But it is -- let\nme qualify that then, Justice Ginsburg. It's undisputed\nthat he never had a license.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Could I ask one question\nthat I just want to be sure I understand your position?\nIf we had not granted cert, if you had gone to the\nadministrative agency and the agent had ruled against\nyou, what would you have next done?\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Ruled against us? We would\nhave filed an appeal to the --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: To the court?\nMR. BRUNSTAD: To the court, correct. And\nthen there would have been a motion to compel for\narbitration. That --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: That seems to me\ncompletely inconsistent with your argument that\nadditional time was minimal. And if you have repeated\nstatements in your brief that require qualifications, if\nin your former argument in Marshal, the Court is\nconcerned with the accuracy of one of your citations,\nshouldn't we view with some skepticism what you tell us?\nMR. BRUNSTAD: No, Justice Kennedy. I think\nthat all of our citations to the record and all of our\nstatements about the facts are, in fact, true.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What I just read you,\nthis one, you said it isn't. You say it is undisputed\nthat Preston was an unlicensed talent agent. And you\njust admitted that that is disputed.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: I'm sorry, forgive me,\nJustice Ginsburg. It's undisputed that Mr. Preston\nnever had a license.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But that's not what you\nrepresented.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: It is disputed whether he was\nacting as a talent agent or not. I wish to clarify\nthat.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Schleimer, you\nhave nine minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOSEPH D. SCHLEIMER\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. SCHLEIMER: Thank you, Mr. Chief\nJustice.\nI would disagree that there wasn't an\nevidentiary hearing. I don't think the evidence is\nconsidered, but in addition to Mr. Preston's\ndeclaration, I made an offer of proof which is in the\nappellant's appendix at page 219. I offered to prove\nthat the Judge Alex television program is solicited and\nprocured by an agent of the William Morris Agency. I\nhad made two attempts to depose Judge Ferrer to prove\nthat, and I never got the chance. He didn't want to be\ndeposed.\nSo, there was a full evidentiary hearing.\nThe evidence just wasn't considered because the legal\nstandard that was applied was there's a colorable claim\nunder the Talent Agencies Act, so you can't arbitrate\nuntil it's resolved.\nNow I saw this as being a long trek through\nthe courts. I don't know when the arbitrator gets to\nmake his decision. If -- if the Labor Commissioner\nrules that the contract is void and then we have a de\nnovo and the Superior Court does that, and the court of\nappeal does it, and then the California Supreme Court\nrules the contract is void, does the arbitrator get to\noverrule that.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Regardless of the -- I now\nunderstand better than I did what I take as a pretty\nstrong argument. I'm not saying convincing, but strong.\nAnd that would be this: If you go look at\nVolt, and in Volt the Court said that the California\nCode meant that the individual who'd entered into the\narbitration contract could go and can ask a superior\ncourt to stay an arbitration while some unrelated --\nsome unrelated -- I mean directly related but not the\nsame parties -- litigation took place.\nThe Court didn't in Volt say that that\nquestion of interpreting this contract is for the\narbitrator. I don't know why it didn't. But it didn't.\nNow here he's making a parallel argument.\nHe's saying that the California Code says that people\nshould first go to that Labor Commissioner and that you\ncan stay arbitration while that goes on.\nNow -- and I say well, why don't you go to\nthe arbitrator? He says I don't want to go to the\narbitrator on that one, but he points to Volt.\nAnd so the puzzle is this: if the Court in\nVolt didn't say this is a matter for the arbitrator,\nwhether the contract really means that you promise not\nto go into court and make a motion to stay, why here is\nit a matter for the arbitrator whether you implicitly\npromised not to go into court and asked him to stay\npending the outcome of this administrative proceeding?\nWhat do you think about that?\nMR. SCHLEIMER: I certainly think that the\narbitrator had jurisdiction to arbitrate arbitrability.\nAnd the reason for that is the Qualcomm case\nand the Dream Theater case is a California case cited in\nQualcomm, and that the arbitrator should have decided\nall these issues.\nI would make this observation. If we -- if\nwe had gone to the arbitrator and Judge Ferrer had said\nlook, this contract is illegal, said you don't have\njurisdiction, and I want you to rule you don't have\njurisdiction, the same illegality issue would be a\ndefense on the merits.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, I -- I accept that.\nI see a lot of common sense on your side of it. But\nimagine I'm writing an opinion in your favor and now I\ncome to the following paragraph which I have to write:\n\"Your opponent says that Volt controls here; but that is\nwrong because\" -- and now fill in the blank for me.\nMR. SCHLEIMER: Assuming Volt --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Now, I'm just saying I have\nto write. I see all the common sense of your position.\nI -- absolutely. But to get -- you only need one really\ngood argument. And he's saying whatever the other ones\nare, here Breyer or somebody is going to have to write\nthe words, and Volt is different because -- so I would\nlike some help on that one.\nMR. SCHLEIMER: Because in Volt the contract\nwas silent, and the Federal Arbitration Act was silent\non the issue that was presented, and State law supplied\nthe answer. The California Arbitration Act has a number\nof --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But that's always the\ncase. It's always the case that the arbitration is\nquiet on this. It is -- the Respondent's position is\nthat it is absolutely quiet, but it is also absolutely\nclear that it is State law.\nMR. SCHLEIMER: The contract here, I would\nsubmit, Justice Kennedy, is not quiet because it says\nthat validity or legality shall be arbitrated. And\nthat's what we are talking about. So you don't have a\nsilent contract. You have a contract that speaks to\nthat question.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm not sure that Volt\nwould have been different. Volt is -- Volt is written\nvery broadly, it seems to me, in favor of the\nRespondent's position.\nMR. SCHLEIMER: Volt was written under the\nCalifornia Arbitration Act, and speaking as a California\npractitioner that had had a lot of cases, you might\nnotice that the same section in Volt was the basis for\nmy motion to compel arbitration. See codicil procedure\nCC P 1281.2. CC P 1281 is almost identical to Section 2\nof the Federal Arbitration Act, but the California\nArbitration Act has a number of provisions where the\nFederal Arbitration Act is silent. One of those is\ndealing with multi-party litigation where parties are\nnot bound.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You think Volt would have\ncome out the same way if -- if in fact, all of the\nparties in this other litigation had agreed to\narbitration? You have any doubt --\nMR. SCHLEIMER: I think it would have come\nout the other way, yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yeah. I do, too.\nMR. SCHLEIMER: That's what Volt was all\nabout, was the fact that --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Writing broadly is known as\ndictum, isn't it?\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I suppose if we write the\ncase your way, we have to talk about what happens if\nthis Labor Commissioner had enforcement powers, that\nthey had the sua sponte right to invoke, and that they\ndid?\nMR. SCHLEIMER: I think the Labor\nCommissioner probably does. I think it has to do with\nthe adjudicatory versus prosecutorial function of an\nadministrative agency.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But this is not a\nproceeding brought by the administrative agency.\nMR. SCHLEIMER: No.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: An agency like the EEOC\nWaffle House.\nMR. SCHLEIMER: This is -- this is an --\nthis is an administrative agency providing an\nadjudicatory forum.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: This is somebody who's\nbound by arbitration invoking whatever authority the\nLabor Commissioner has, quite different from the Labor\nCommissioner commencing a proceeding.\nMR. SCHLEIMER: Waffle House was all about\nthe prosecutorial or administrative power. This\nis about the adjudicatory --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, your friend\nsays that this agency has exactly that power, and the\nreason you required these things to go before her, is\nthat she knows what's going on in the area and, if\nappropriate, can take the supervisory authority or\nwhatever the equivalent of prosecutorial action is.\nMR. SCHLEIMER: I think I pointed out in my\npapers that nothing stops Judge Ferrer from putting a\ndime in the phone, calling the Labor Commissioner and\ncomplaining, saying there's been illegality here. They\nmay request some evidence at that point. But the point\nis that the prosecutorial discretion will be exercised\nby the Labor Commissioner acting in an essentially\nexecutive branch function.\nHere in our case, all they did was supply a\nhearing room and a hearing officer, an adjudicatory\nfunction. That's what the arbitrator is supposed to do,\nis adjudicate the case. That's the distinction. And I\nsee Gilmer as being a situation where there's an attempt\nto avoid adjudicating in the agreed forum. And I see\nWaffle House as saying that we're not going to hogtie\nadministrative agencies when they perform the\nprosecutorial function, the administrative function.\nI guess if there are no further questions --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel.\n"
