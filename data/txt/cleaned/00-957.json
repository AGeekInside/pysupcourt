        "content": "(10:59 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: We'll hear argument\nnext in No. 00-957, Kansas v. Michael Crane.\nGeneral Stovall.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF CARLA J. STOVALL\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMS. STOVALL: Mr. Chief Justice, thank you, and\nmay it please the Court:\nThe Kansas Supreme Court has erroneously read\nthis Court's decision in Kansas v. Hendricks as requiring\na showing that a potentially sexually violent predator\ncannot control his behavior and that such a requirement\nhas supplemented the two requisites for civil commitment\nthat this Court has approved in and since the Addington\ncase. Those two requirements, as you know, are mental\nillness and dangerousness.\nThe volitional impairment that the Kansas\nSupreme Court has ruled was constitutionally required for\ncivil commitment ignores the fact that psychological\ndisorders, such as antisocial personality, can impair an\nindividual in behavior, cognitive, perceptual, emotional,\nand even intellectual capacities.\nThis Court has never indicated that there's\nanything constitutionally significant about a volitional\nimpairment.\nQUESTION: There was a good deal of reference in\nour Hendricks opinion to the -- to the apparent fact that\nthe person there had what was volitionally impaired.\nYou're saying that was descriptive rather than essential\nto the holding?\nMS. STOVALL: I'm saying it was descriptive.\nMr. Hendricks had apparently, and according to himself\nonly, an inability to control his own behavior. So, when\nthe majority wrote about Mr. Hendricks, they used that\nkind of a description.\nQUESTION: Well, but we also relied on prior\nauthority that made some reference to lack of control.\ndon't think that what was done by the court below was\ntotally off the wall in light of what was said in our\nprior cases. What if there is some element but perhaps\nnot to that extent? How would you draw the line?\nMS. STOVALL: Well, if this Court says that\nthere needs to be some volitional impairment displayed, we\nwould suggest that it just be merely some impairment. To\nhave a total impairment is something that the\npsychiatrists will even tell us is an impossible standard\nto show.\nQUESTION: You think that's the standard adopted\nin the court below that we're reviewing?\nMS. STOVALL: I do.\nQUESTION: Total impairment?\nMS. STOVALL: I do.\nQUESTION: Do you acknowledge that lack of\nability to control one's unlawful conduct and volitional\nimpairment are one and the same thing?\nMS. STOVALL: No, I do not.\nQUESTION: Suppose I'm delusional and -- and I\nthink that -- that people I see are Satan. I'm fully able\nto control myself and -- and do not attack people who are\nnot Satan, but I think that some people are Satan.\nMS. STOVALL: Your Honor, that's --\nQUESTION: Do you call that a lack of volitional\ncontrol or delusion?\nMS. STOVALL: I would consider that delusional\nand not a -- a lack of volitional control. And the\nproblem with the Kansas Supreme Court's decision is that\nit says the only thing that we consider is volitional\nimpairment, but there are many kinds of impairments\nindividuals have that are the result of their mental\ndisorder, and so the Kansas court is necessarily limiting\nthe psychiatric diagnosis to say only volitional\nimpairment --\nQUESTION: What is there -- I thought there\ncould be cognitive impairments. I think Justice Scalia\nhas described one. There could be emotional impairments.\nMS. STOVALL: Yes, sir.\nQUESTION: And there could be volitional\nimpairments. Now, is there any other category?\nMS. STOVALL: Perceptual, intellectual. There\n-- there are many kinds that are talked about within the\npsychiatric material.\nQUESTION: But are these --\nQUESTION: Is there any kind relevant here other\nthan volition?\nMS. STOVALL: Yes. I think they all are, all of\nthose that we mentioned, and perhaps even those --\nQUESTION: Are relevant in this case?\nMS. STOVALL: Not -- yes.\nQUESTION: I'm saying is there any one relevant\nto the particular individual at issue here other than\nvolition.\nMS. STOVALL: I don't believe psychiatrists can\ntell us what it is that -- what kind of impairment Mr.\nCrane has. They're not -- the -- the literature will say\nthat psychiatrists can't tell whether or not Justice\nScalia was acting because he's hallucinating or because\nit's some other volitional impairment, if it's an\nirresistible impulse, if you will, whether it's emotional,\nperceptual, intellectual. They can't tell. They can't\nget in somebody's mind. And what they have to do then is\nsimply rely on what the individual says.\nMr. Crane told this -- the court below -- he\ntold the experts below, rather. He didn't testify. He\ntold the experts below that he could control his behavior.\nMr. Hendricks had testimony that you refer to in the\nHendricks decision that said he couldn't control his\nbehavior. So, because the psychiatrist can't make a\ndetermination objectively, we're left with a potential\npredator telling us who applies -- who's eligible for this\nlaw and who isn't.\nThe other point I would make to this Court is\nthat Mr. Hendricks said I can't control my urge to molest\nchildren. But he could. He never molested little\nchildren in front of their parents, never in front of his\nwife, never in front of law enforcement --\nQUESTION: Well, but that's not the premise that\nHendricks proceeded upon. Now you're -- now you're saying\nthat Hendricks rested on an insecure factual assumption.\nMS. STOVALL: I'm sorry, Your Honor. I don't\nunderstand.\nQUESTION: Well, you're -- are you trying to say\nthat what we said in Hendricks was -- was dictum or --\nMS. STOVALL: I --\nQUESTION: -- just was -- was wrong in the -- in\nthe context of that case?\nMS. STOVALL: I'm certainly not saying you were\nwrong, Your Honor. I'm saying that you did not create a\nthird constitutional standard, that the impairments that\nI --\nQUESTION: Well, was the Court under some\nmisimpression as -- as to Hendricks' ability to control\nhimself?\nMS. STOVALL: There wasn't evidence before this\nCourt that would say whether or not Hendricks suffered\nfrom a volitional impairment or not. All we have is what\nhe himself said.\nQUESTION: But then, it seems to me, that we're\nback to square one. I -- one reading of Hendricks -- and\ntell me if this is wrong -- is that we want to find some\nmeasure of determining how dangerous this person is to\nsociety because that's in the statute. And because many\ncriminals are -- have personality disorders and are\ndangerous to society, we want to narrow it somewhat. So,\nwe -- so the Court added this volitional control aspect.\nIs that a fair reading of Hendricks?\nMS. STOVALL: Your Honor, I don't believe it is\nbecause Mr. Hendricks, in particular, didn't suffer from a\npersonality disorder. He had what is classified under the\nKansas statute as an abnormality mentally and that was\nbeing pedophilia. The Kansas statute specifically says\nthere are two kinds of impairment that we could look at.\nThey're emotional as well as volitional.\nQUESTION: Well, is the test -- are there\ndifferent requirements if you proceed based on a\npersonality disorder than if you proceed from a mental\nabnormality?\nMS. STOVALL: Well, the Kansas court seems to\nthink there is because there is no definition in the\nstatute of a personality disorder. It wasn't defined --\nQUESTION: Well, I was -- I was suggesting that\nyou thought there was based on the answer you gave to me.\nMS. STOVALL: No, Your Honor. What --\nQUESTION: You think they're both one and the\nsame. You have no different requirements for mental\nabnormality or personality disorder. In -- in either\ncase, the test for civil commitment is the same.\nMS. STOVALL: Based on the Kansas Supreme Court\ndecision or based on the --\nQUESTION: Based on what you think the law ought\nto be and what the -- and how the statute is properly\ninterpreted.\nMS. STOVALL: We believe there is no\ndistinction. There should be no distinction between\nmental abnormality and personality disorder, that as long\nas we -- we show that mental condition and the\ndangerousness, that there should not be a distinction.\nQUESTION: So, anybody with a personality\ndisorder that's a danger to himself or others can be --\ncan be civilly committed regardless of volitional control.\nThat's -- that's your position.\nMS. STOVALL: Right. They have to have some\nsort of impairment in order to have the diagnosis of a\npersonality disorder. That's part and parcel of a\ndiagnosis of the DSM. But it would be our position it's\nnot limited to volitional control, but could be that\nlaundry list of emotional capacity -- emotional\nimpairment, which is even what the Kansas statute\ncontemplates for mental --\nQUESTION: -- the DSM that you're mentioning, if\nyou look at the definition of personality disorder and\nthey say pick three out of a list of seven, you could pick\nout habitually doesn't work, doesn't pay debts, is\nreckless, irritable. That's something -- I mean, it's\nconsiderably less than what is defined as an abnormality\nlike pedophilia. There are a lot of ordinary people who\nwould fit that description.\nMS. STOVALL: What -- what I want to be able to\ndo today, Your Honors, is to convince you that actually\nthat's not true, that an antisocial personality disorder\nis a severe mental pathology that really does give us\nsociopaths and psychopaths that cannot conform to our\nrules. There are a lot of individuals in this country and\ncertainly in our prisons that break the law, and they may\nsuffer from antisocial personality traits, but that's\nentirely separate and distinct from having a full-blown\ndiagnosis of an antisocial personality disorder.\nQUESTION: Well, your statute itself, when\nyou're talking about a sexually violent predator, you say\nmental abnormality or personality disorder, which makes\nthe person likely to engage in repeat acts of sexual\nviolence. So, that certainly qualifies the personality\ndisorder. It's not any personality disorder that would do\nthat.\nMS. STOVALL: That's exactly right, Your Honor.\nThe point is that it's a severe diagnosis, for one thing,\nand then secondly, it has to tie directly to the kind of\ndangerous behavior that we believe these individuals will\ncommit if they don't have the treatment.\nQUESTION: And I take it what your -- what your\nstatute is trying to get at is -- is something more than\nmere repetitive conduct, mere recidivism. Is that fair to\nsay?\nMS. STOVALL: Absolutely.\nQUESTION: And -- and is the element that\ndistinguishes this kind of behavior from mere\nrepetitiveness some element of lack of control, not\nnecessarily volitional control, but some element of lack\nof control, perhaps lack of control resulting from\ndelusion, perceptual difficulties and so on, but -- but\nsome -- some aspect of the personality that -- that gives\nthat individual a -- a lesser chance of controlling\nbehavior in -- in a way that avoids committing crimes. Is\nthat fair to say?\nMS. STOVALL: With a slight exception. It's the\ndangerousness, the risk of recidivism tied to a mental\ndisorder. To get the diagnosis of a mental disorder,\nthere will be an impairment that's part and parcel of\nthat.\nQUESTION: Right.\nMS. STOVALL: But I want to be clear that we\ndon't think there needs to be a -- a third separate, very\ndistinguishable constitutional element --\nQUESTION: I guess what I'm -- I guess what I'm\ngetting at is it -- it seems sensible to call somebody who\nis just an habitual offender at some dangerous crime or\nserious crime dangerous. And I take it that what the\nKansas statute and other statutes like it is trying to get\nat, by speaking of mental disorder or personality\ndisorder, is some extra element beyond the mere\nprobability of doing an act which society has called\ndangerous. And I think -- I think --\nMS. STOVALL: That's 100 percent accurate.\nThat's exactly where we are, Your Honor. And we think\nthat having that mental abnormality or mental disorder\ngets us away from just predicting who's going to be\ndangerous.\nQUESTION: But what is that -- what is that?\nThat's exactly the issue. What is it that you -- how --\nwhat form of words will you use to define what counts as a\nmental disorder that will distinguish the people whom you\nwant to civilly commit from your mine-run recidivist\ncriminal?\nMS. STOVALL: That they have to have a mental --\nQUESTION: Yes, but what -- that's the problem\nin the case. The problem is what counts as a mental\ndisorder. And the Kansas court thought what counts as a\nmental disorder is a total inability to control behavior.\nMS. STOVALL: That's correct.\nQUESTION: You say that's not the right\ndefinition. Very well. What is?\nMS. STOVALL: What is in the statute, a severe\nmental --\nQUESTION: No, no. What is the definition of\nthe word, mental disorder, that appears in the statute?\nIf a person were to say every person who commits a crime,\n15 times running, is a sociopath and thereby falls within\nDSM-IV, you're not going to permit that. You want to\ndistinguish that sociopath from a person who is really\nmentally disordered and he isn't your mine-run criminal.\nAll right. Give me the form of words that will do it.\nMS. STOVALL: I believe they are there now,\nthat --\nQUESTION: All that's there now is mental\ndisorder.\nMS. STOVALL: Well, actually it's mental\nabnormality and personality disorder. You and this Court\nin the Hendricks decision said that pedophilia certainly\nqualifies as a --\nQUESTION: Well, and here we have -- we have\nhere an antisocial personality disorder. That -- that was\nthe diagnosis.\nMS. STOVALL: That's right. Along with\nexhibitionism.\nQUESTION: And the State's own expert said in\nMr. Crane's trial that approximately 75 percent of the\nprison population has antisocial personality disorder.\nNow, this is an unusual statute where after the\nperson serves a sentence for the crime, the State can then\nproceed again and get them locked up for a very long time\nbecause of his dangerousness.\nMS. STOVALL: And the mental disorder.\nQUESTION: We're trying -- okay. But most of\nthem -- 75 percent of them was the testimony -- suffer\nfrom antisocial personality disorder. So, is the State\ngoing to be able to proceed again against 75 percent of\nthe prison population? What is the added element beyond\nan antisocial personality disorder?\nMS. STOVALL: I would suggest to you that there\ndoesn't need to be an additional element. While I\nacknowledge the expert said 75 percent suffers from that\nin the deposition, he wasn't -- he certainly didn't quote\nempirical studies to demonstrate that. I would suggest\nthat probably 90-95 percent of the prison population\nsuffer from antisocial personality traits, but that's\ndifferent than a disorder.\nThe antisocial personality disorder, psychopaths\nand sexual -- psychopaths and sociopaths with actual\ndiagnosis -- and Ted Bundy is the best example of that.\nThese are really serious individuals not 75 percent of the\npopulation.\nQUESTION: What is it -- what is it about them\nthat we can isolate that shows that they are really\nserious beyond the mere repetition of their crime?\nIn other words, let me put the question this\nway. Under -- under the rule you want us to adopt in\nwhich, as you put it, there is no third element, why\naren't you free to go after, let's say, every second\noffender of a sexual crime at the time of release and say,\nthis person is dangerous within -- sufficiently dangerous\nwithin the meaning of the statute to -- to commit here?\nNow, you're not claiming you can do that, but I\nwant to know what it is that you have to prove that stands\nin the way of your being able to do that.\nMS. STOVALL: We have to show a mental illness.\nQUESTION: And -- and --\nMS. STOVALL: And that's a psychiatrically\napproved condition that --\nQUESTION: No, but --\nMS. STOVALL: -- you can get an expert --\nQUESTION: -- anything in the DSM.\nMS. STOVALL: Right.\nQUESTION: Then you're --\nMS. STOVALL: I'm sorry. Not anything in the\nDSM.\nQUESTION: Then you're back to Justice\nGinsburg's question, which -- which is very much like\nJustice O'Connor's. If all you've got to do is satisfy\none criterion in the DSM, you're going to pick up, in\nJustice O'Connor's reference to the experts, 75 percent\nprobably of your prison population and -- and based on the\n-- the categorization Justice Ginsburg described, it would\nseem to me you would pickup a substantial part of the\npopulation outside of prison.\nNow, I know you don't want to do that, but on\nyour theory that there is -- there is no third element\nbeyond this categorization, what stands in the way of your\ndoing that?\nMS. STOVALL: The actual diagnosis that those\nfolks actually have those diagnosis and are sexually\nviolent. Being sexually violent absolutely limits that.\nWhat I would --\nQUESTION: All right. Are you saying then that\nin the example Justice Ginsburg gave you -- what was it --\nfour out of seven in the list?\nMS. STOVALL: Three of seven.\nQUESTION: That -- that as -- as long as -- as\nthe -- the expert witness says, yes, this person is\nsubject to four out of those seven personality traits,\nthat that person, if a sexual offender, could be locked up\nunder the statute?\nMS. STOVALL: They could be committed for\ntreatment under this -- this statute, yes, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Wow.\nMS. STOVALL: And Mr. Crane -- what -- what I\nwould want you to know, though, is that it is not a --\njust because these individuals have committed crimes\ndoesn't mean they have an antisocial personality disorder.\nOf the seven criteria that are listed, that can certainly\nbe supplemented by independent judgment of psychiatrists,\nof the --\nQUESTION: But it would be very -- it -- it\nwould be -- on Justice Ginsburg's example, it would be\nvery easy to prove.\nMS. STOVALL: It could be if they actually have\nthat diagnosis and have those personality traits and have\ndone that behavior.\nIf I -- although it is not in the record, what I\nwould like this Court to know is that out of 5,000\nindividuals that have been screened in this process in\nKansas, a mere 1 -- less than 1 and a half percent have\nactually been civilly committed. And we have --\nQUESTION: -- the prosecutor then, but I mean,\nthat's not something that -- that we would generally do.\nI mean, if we thought of all prosecutors as being wise and\nkind and good, then there would be a whole lot of rights\nthat we wouldn't have to worry about.\nMS. STOVALL: I understand.\nQUESTION: But Justice Kennedy brought up in --\nin Hendricks a concern, and this case seems to fit that.\nThat is, this man entered a plea bargain.\nMS. STOVALL: I'm sorry?\nQUESTION: He entered a plea bargain. Right?\nAnd he got a relatively short time. And then, through\nthis civil process, without beyond a reasonable doubt as\nthe standard, just a preponderance --\nQUESTION: No. There is a reasonable -- beyond\na reasonable doubt, yes.\nMS. STOVALL: It is beyond a --\nQUESTION: But it is a civil proceeding.\nMS. STOVALL: It is but we have that higher\nstandard.\nQUESTION: May I --\nQUESTION: Still, you could -- you could get to\nwhere you were or even beyond. You could get to the full\namount of time that the person could have been sentenced\nif there had been no plea bargain, and if you -- the\nmaximum penalty because this is indefinite. Right?\nMS. STOVALL: It's indefinite with annual\nreviews, and they are allowed to be released when they\nhave been determined safe to be at large. And while it is\nnot part of the record, I would want you to know that Mr.\nCrane is in transitional release now, after about 3 years\nin this treatment program.\nQUESTION: What do the annual reviews -- what do\nthey deal with? Is it possible at -- at the end of an\nannual review for the person to be released?\nMS. STOVALL: Yes. Could go to the transitional\nrelease phase and then the conditional release phase and\nthen ultimately to final discharge. The annual release\nensures -- the annual review, rather, ensures that they're\nnot warehoused, that they have an opportunity to come to\nthe court on an annual basis.\nQUESTION: What does the court have to find in\norder to release them? It is no longer beyond a\nreasonable doubt that --\nMS. STOVALL: Then it's -- the State has to show\n-- I'm sorry. The -- the respondent has to show probable\ncause that they have changed. The State, as a matter of\npolicy, never objects when there are psychiatrists say\nthey're safe to be in the next phase of the program or the\nnext. We've never objected to that. We have six that are\nactually out of the facility now and in either\ntransitional and/or conditional release.\nQUESTION: And isn't it a frequent case, though,\nthat the psychiatrists say, well, we can't tell until we\nclinically re-observe him and we can't clinically observe\nhim until he's in a normal environment? I mean, can\npsychiatrists --\nMS. STOVALL: It hasn't happened in the six so\nfar that -- that have -- have been released.\nQUESTION: The American Psychiatric Association\nsays in their brief that the, quote, antisocial\npersonality disorder, end quote, which is DSM-IV at 701-\n706, applies to 40 to 60 percent among the male-sentenced\npopulation. So, are you saying that 40 to 60 percent of\nthe male-sentenced population could be committed for life\ncivilly? Are you saying that DSM-IV is not the standard,\nor are you saying that the American Psychiatric\nAssociation is wrong when it tells us 40 percent to 60\npercent fit within the DSM-IV definition?\nMS. STOVALL: In terms of the antisocial\npersonality disorder alone, I don't know. What I would\nsay is that certainly 40 to 60 percent --\nQUESTION: All right.\nQUESTION: Did they say how they know? I -- I\n-- you know, I could --\nQUESTION: I -- I don't know if they know or\nnot.\nQUESTION: If -- if they stated --\nQUESTION: But I know they know better than I\ndo.\nQUESTION: Did they say that 40 to 60 percent\nare beyond a reasonable doubt suffering from an antisocial\npersonality disorder?\nMS. STOVALL: I doubt that, and I doubt that --\nthat it applies to --\nQUESTION: The reason -- the point of my\nquestion is, is DSM-IV the standard and if DSM-IV is not\nthe standard, what is? That's what I think all of us, or\nseveral of us anyway, are trying to get to. And it may be\nyou -- you cannot address that further, but if you could.\nMS. STOVALL: The DSM-IV absolutely is the\nstandard in the psychiatric profession, but it is not the\nBible and is not the only thing psychiatrists use. They\nvery much can supplement that with their own judgment, and\nin fact, that's part of the prefatory language in the DSM.\nQUESTION: May I ask you this question? And I'm\nconcerned about whether the instructions were adequate and\nwhether you think the instructions were adequate. And one\nof the reasons I have the question is they do not seem, on\ntheir face, to require any finding of volitional\nimpairment. And it seems to me we might look at\nvolitional impairment in three different ways, one that\nhas to be total inability to comply, some inability to\ncomply, or that it's totally irrelevant to the issue.\nWhich of those three positions is yours?\nMS. STOVALL: The last, that it's irrelevant to\na diagnosis.\nQUESTION: There's no need to show any\nvolitional impairment in order to obtain a commitment\nunder this statute, so the instruction is correct.\nMS. STOVALL: That -- that is absolutely the\nState's position.\nQUESTION: And I think it's also unnecessary to\nshow any other kind of impairment in addition to the two\nelements that you're describing.\nMS. STOVALL: In order to get a -- in terms of\nthe instructions, that's true because to get a diagnosis,\nyou have to have an impairment. You can't be diagnosed\nwith anything under DSM without having an impairment. So,\nit's part and parcel.\nQUESTION: -- the actual difficulty in\ncontrolling, not -- not utter inability to control\nconduct, but difficulty in controlling conduct. Don't you\nhave to show that?\nQUESTION: She said -- she didn't say that.\nMS. STOVALL: I don't believe we have to show\nthat.\nQUESTION: How could the person be dangerous --\nMS. STOVALL: Because they have this --\nQUESTION: -- by reason of the personality\ndisorder if the personality disorder does not produce a\ndifficulty in -- in controlling conduct?\nMS. STOVALL: In order to link together the --\nQUESTION: I must say, I thought -- I thought\nyou conceded that you have to show difficulty in\ncontrolling conduct, and if you don't, this is a quite\ndifferent case from what I thought.\nMS. STOVALL: And I misspoke, Your Honor. The\n-- within the definition of the mental abnormality itself,\nwe don't have to show lack of control, but the statutory\nlanguage then leads us into that you have this mental\nabnormality or disorder that makes you likely or that\npredisposes you. So, there is the connection that we have\nto show.\nQUESTION: Well, no --\nQUESTION: In other words --\nQUESTION: It predisposes you to do things you\nwant to do.\nQUESTION: Yes.\nQUESTION: So that, it seems to me, doesn't\nanswer the question.\nMS. STOVALL: Our --\nQUESTION: Where is it in the statutory language\nthat talks about volitional control? It doesn't.\nMS. STOVALL: The mental abnormality is defined\nin the statute and it does mention both volitional and\nemotional capacity --\nQUESTION: A personality disorder does not.\nMS. STOVALL: It is not defined and I think\nthat's because it's such a common term, the legislature\ndidn't define it. Mental abnormality was a very unique\nterm. So, I think they chose to define it, but they\ninclude emotional as well as volitional impairments there.\nAnd if the Kansas Supreme Court is right, then you must\nstrike out emotional because we could prove it under the\nstatute by an emotional impairment that they say is not\nvalid. Only a volitional impairment is allowed. And --\nand so --\nQUESTION: But you say emotional is, and -- and\nI guess emotional impairment I suppose would describe\nevery sociopath in the country. I mean, I thought a\nsociopath by definition was somebody who just didn't care\nabout society's standards.\nMS. STOVALL: That is absolutely one part --\nQUESTION: That would satisfy as an emotional\nimpairment, wouldn't it?\nMS. STOVALL: It is an emotional impairment,\nyes, Your Honor. That's true.\nQUESTION: So --\nMS. STOVALL: But the Kansas court would say\nthat --\nQUESTION: -- in fact, we -- I think we get back\nto the point that on your theory any sociopath who has\ncommitted a -- a sexual offense can be committed under\nthis statute upon release.\nMS. STOVALL: But it takes more than having the\nlikelihood of committing more sex crimes and/or not having\nany empathy before you could be diagnosed with an\nantisocial personality disorder. And so, there --\nQUESTION: It would take -- it would take four\nout of seven on Justice Ginsburg's list.\nMS. STOVALL: It takes three, actually three of\nseven. But it does make a significant diagnosis. It is a\nmental pathology. It isn't something that --\nQUESTION: Beyond a reasonable doubt.\nMS. STOVALL: Again, Your Honor, you're exactly\nright. Beyond a reasonable doubt we have to be able to --\nQUESTION: If we take just those three things\nbeyond a reasonable doubt, that definition doesn't say\ntrait. It says antisocial personality disorder, and\nyou're familiar with this list. You could be a liar. You\ncould be a malingerer and you could not pay your debts,\nand you'd make those three.\nMS. STOVALL: I would suggest to you that's part\nof the evaluative process of a psychologist then in saying\nthis is someone who is likely to continue to be sexually\nviolent. If that's all they've done --\nQUESTION: The prosecutor says, DCM, this\ncategory fits, antisocial personality disorder, any three\nof -- and I just gave you three from the list.\nMS. STOVALL: Right, but that doesn't mean that\none of the experts would say that makes them fit under\nthis law to be sexually violent predators. They may have\nan antisocial personality disorder, but not that it makes\nthem likely to re-offend, not that the -- the\npsychiatrists at Larned would suggest they need to be\ncivilly committed.\nQUESTION: General Stovall, you have read\nHendricks, as all of us have. And -- and the part that's\non substantive due process is not long. It's four pages,\nand in those four pages, there are six references to\npeople -- not Hendricks, but people who are unable to\ncontrol their behavior, confinement for those who are\nunable to control their dangerousness. Are you -- you're\nessentially saying we should just read out that language.\nIt was incautious. Is that what you're telling us?\nMS. STOVALL: I am because I don't believe that\nwas central or necessary to the holding. What I believe\nis in the majority opinion, you were using that to\ndescribe the mental abnormality, just to talk about --\nit's a substitute. On -- on page 360 of the --\nQUESTION: The holding -- the holding was,\nindeed, described differently. It at one point said -- it\ndid mention volitional impairment, but it said the\nfollowing. The Kansas act is plainly of a kind -- these\nother civil commit -- and statutes. It requires a finding\nof future dangerousness and then links that finding to the\nexistence of a mental abnormality or personality disorder\nthat makes it difficult, if not impossible for the person\nto control his dangerous behavior. That seems to me --\nMS. STOVALL: That's -- that's exactly --\nQUESTION: -- the crux of the holding of the\ncase and that portion does not say anything about\nvolitional impairment, just inability or difficulty in\ncontrolling behavior.\nMS. STOVALL: And what I would suggest to you is\non page 360 of -- of the opinion, it becomes very clear\nthe way that that phrase and those phrases were being\nused. This admitted lack of volitional control, coupled\nwith prediction of future dangerousness adequately\ndistinguish Hendricks from other dangerous people who are\nperhaps more properly dealt with through the criminal\nproceedings.\nThe way of saying admitted lack of volitional\ncontrol is another way of simply talking about the mental\nimpairment. Couple that with dangerousness, and then you\nget the two historic requirements of mental illness and\ndangerousness that you've always required.\nQUESTION: If -- if a jury instruction were\ncouched in the terms that Justice Scalia just quoted, as\nstating the holding in Hendricks, would you find that jury\ninstruction correct and satisfactory?\nMS. STOVALL: I would find it longer than it\nneeded to be and more inclusive than it needed to be\nbecause --\nQUESTION: Would it be -- would it be\nconstitutionally erroneous? Would you --\nMS. STOVALL: Yes. I -- I would say that it --\nthat it would be --\nQUESTION: So, we --\nMS. STOVALL: -- because it goes beyond --\nQUESTION: That's the holding in Hendricks.\nWe've got to pull back from Hendricks then in your view.\nMS. STOVALL: My view is that what you said in\nHendricks was mental illness that makes somebody dangerous\nin sexually violent ways.\nQUESTION: Yes. But if Justice Scalia's\nquotations correctly stated the holding in Hendricks, I\nthink you are telling us we have got to draw back from\nHendricks.\nMS. STOVALL: Again, what I'm saying, the mental\nillness makes them likely to re-offend in sexually violent\nways.\nQUESTION: -- why you say we have -- you say we\nhave to draw back from that statement. What -- what in\nthat statement is wrong?\nMS. STOVALL: That -- that we have to -- that we\nhave to show the -- the difficulty of maintaining their\nbehavior, of controlling their behavior.\nQUESTION: The statement said --\nMS. STOVALL: I don't have the exact --\nQUESTION: -- it requires a finding of future\ndangerousness and links that finding to the existence of a\nmental abnormality or personality disorder that makes it\ndifficult, if not impossible, for the person to control\nhis dangerous behavior. What is wrong in that, other than\nleaving out beyond a reasonable doubt, which your statute\ncontains?\nMS. STOVALL: Right.\nQUESTION: What is -- what is wrong in it?\nMS. STOVALL: Only that if -- if we have to\nrequire the finding of that makes it difficult, if not\nimpossible, for them to control behavior.\nQUESTION: You're concerned that the last\nsentence --\nQUESTION: -- that finding? How are they future\n-- wow.\nMS. STOVALL: It's -- it's because they're --\nthey have a mental abnormality. They've committed the\npast acts. They're likely to do it in the future. They\nhave this diagnosis. And so, it's part and parcel, and\ncommon sense would tell you that there's a link and a\nbridge, but not that it's a separate statutory term that\nneeds to be shown and certainly not a constitutional one.\nQUESTION: Thank you, General Stovall.\nWe'll hear from you, Mr. Donham.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN C. DONHAM\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. DONHAM: Mr. Chief Justice, may it please\nthe Court:\nI think the major disagreement between the State\n-- the State's view of this and Mr. Crane's view is not\nhow dangerous is an individual, but why are they\ndangerous.\nThe Kansas Sexual Predator Act was clearly\nwritten to limit the application to those who are\ndangerous on account of their mental illness.\nQUESTION: You have a nice speaking voice, but\ncould you raise it just a little bit?\nMR. DONHAM: I'm sorry, Judge. I'm sorry, Your\nHonor. Excuse me. Is that better? Okay.\nMr. Crane sought a jury instruction at his trial\nthat was consistent with this Court's decision in\nHendricks. There is or was known to Mr. Crane at that\ntime only three forms of a mental abnormality or a mental\nillness that historically satisfied involuntary,\nindefinite civil commitments, and that was the inability\nto care for oneself, the absolution of criminal\nresponsibility or incompetency, and the inability to\nexercise self-control.\nNow, that term, inability to exercise self-\ncontrol, is defined in the passage of volitional control,\nthe ability to exercise choice and to make a decision\nconcerning your behavior.\nQUESTION: You say it's defined. Where do we\nfind that definition, Mr. Donham?\nMR. DONHAM: Your Honor, in the Kansas statute\nitself. It's 59-29a02. The definitional portion defines\nwhat a sexually violent predator is.\nQUESTION: Can you tell us where we find that in\n-- in the papers?\nQUESTION: It's the first page of the appendix\nto the petitioner's brief I think.\nMR. DONHAM: Your Honor, joint appendix --\nexcuse me. Joint appendix, page 157. That would have\nbeen instruction number 9 that was given to the jury.\nQUESTION: We're not talking about the\ninstruction. We're talking about the statute. What is\nthe statutory provision that's in question that -- that\nmakes -- that requires -- you say this Kansas statute\nrequires a volitional impairment. Isn't that what you\nsaid?\nMR. DONHAM: No. I'm sorry. The -- it's --\nit's our opinion that the Kansas Sexually Violent Predator\nAct must be limited to that narrow subgroup of\nrecidivists, those individuals who cannot control their\nbehavior.\nQUESTION: So that a recidivist who will be a\nrecidivist because he's delusional and he thinks that\nevery woman he meets is inviting crude sexual behavior --\nhe's fully able to control himself if he doesn't think\nthat the woman is inviting crude sexual behavior, but he\nhappens to think that every woman he meets is inviting\nhim, and he would not be covered because that is not a\nvolitional impairment. He cannot constitutionally be\ncovered.\nMR. DONHAM: I agree with that, and -- and may I\n-- may I follow that up with perhaps -- the Kansas Sexual\nPredator Act has a number of subsections, one of which is\ndirectly -- directly focused on the type of individual you\njust mentioned in your hypothetical.\nQUESTION: Which one is that? Subsection.\nMR. DONHAM: Your Honor, in the definition of a\n-- sorry. I'm sorry. I don't have that. It is the\nKansas statute on the sexually violent predator --\nQUESTION: Well, I have it here with a number.\nYou referred to one subsection. I'm asking you what\nsubsection that is.\nMR. DONHAM: Your Honor, it's in the statute.\ndon't believe it's in any of the briefs or in the joint\nappendix.\nBut the Kansas Sexual Predator Act reaches those\nwho have been absolved of criminal irresponsibility, those\nfound --\nQUESTION: Well, but you're telling us now what\nthe Kansas Sexual Predator Act does. Cite us to some\nsections. I don't -- we're not interested in some general\nsummary.\nMR. DONHAM: Your Honor, I'm sorry. I don't\nhave the statute number at my fingertips.\nQUESTION: I thought your submission here was\nnot that the act didn't cover your client, but you're --\nyou're supporting the holding of the Kansas Supreme Court\nthat the act does cover your client, but inasmuch as --\ninsofar as it does, it's unconstitutional if it goes\nbeyond volitional impairment. Isn't -- isn't that what\nthis case is about?\nMR. DONHAM: Your Honor, this -- the facts of\nthe Crane case dealt specifically with Mr. Crane and Mr.\nCrane alone. Prior to his criminal trial, he sought a\ndefense of insanity, and that was ruled out by the State.\nThat left him with only one feasible mental illness which\nmight qualify him for commitment under the Sexual Predator\nAct, as understood by Mr. Crane, following your decision\nin Hendricks. And that was that he was unable to control\nhis dangerous sexual behavior.\nQUESTION: Does not --\nQUESTION: Excuse me. Can I just -- I really\ndon't know what we have before us here. I understood the\nissue before this Court to be the fact that the Kansas\nSupreme Court held the Sexually Violent Predators Act,\nwhich we had just said in Hendricks was constitutional --\nthe Kansas Supreme Court held it unconstitutional, yet\nagain, as applied to someone who, like your client, has\nonly an emotional or personality disorder rather than a\nvolitional disorder. Isn't that what the Kansas Supreme\nCourt opinion said? There has to be a volitional disorder\nor else it is unconstitutional to apply the Kansas\nstatute.\nMR. DONHAM: That's what the Kansas Supreme\nCourt said.\nQUESTION: All right. Now tell us why -- why it\nis constitutional to commit someone who -- who makes\nsexual advances to women because of a volitional\nimpairment, but not constitutional to commit someone who\nis delusional. He is just as dangerous. He is just as\nmentally impaired, and the only difference is he's\ndelusional rather than cannot control his -- his will.\nWhy is the one unconstitutional and the other\nconstitutional? I don't understand it.\nMR. DONHAM: Your Honor, if -- if I have to\nfault the opinion in the -- of the Kansas Supreme Court is\n-- it is that it expanded its decision that was directly\nfor Mr. Crane under the specific subsection of the Kansas\nSexual Predator Act that dealt with individuals who had\nbeen found criminally responsible. And it expanded that\nand its terminology to give effect to all commitments.\nThe -- the Sexual Predator Act is and should be\navailable for individuals such as your hypothetical,\nindividuals who, because of some psychosis or\nhallucinations, have in effect lost their ability to\ncontrol their behavior as well, although perhaps through\nsome better recognized form. There is -- there are\nspecific subsections of the Kansas Sexual Predator Act\nthat would pull those people in for a commitment\nproceeding even though they don't go forward -- forward\nwith a trial or if they've been found not guilty by reason\nof insanity.\nMr. Crane, however, was in that unique section\nof people who have -- who have been found legally\nresponsible, who are competent to stand trial, who are\nimprisoned, and upon release this -- this new group of\nindividuals that are now subject to involuntary commitment\nfor some mental disorder this Court found that the\nappropriate level of -- of mental illness, if you will,\nfor Mr. Hendricks was his professed inability to control\nhis behavior, and that --\nQUESTION: You say we -- we found that. I\nrealize that the opinion refers to the fact that he was\nunable to control his behavior. Are you saying that was\n-- that was the holding of the case?\nMR. DONHAM: Your Honor, as -- as I read --\nHendricks stands for the proposition that the Kansas act\nis constitutional because, as with Mr. Hendricks, what it\ndetermined was that the State was not seeking to\ninvoluntarily commit people based on dangerousness alone,\nwhich would have been absolutely unconstitutional under\nFoucha v. Louisiana. It seized upon this additional\nelement which separated and distinguished Mr. Hendricks\nfrom the larger class of just garden variety recidivists.\nIt held that given that limiting factor --\nQUESTION: Which -- which limiting factor was\ndifficulty or impossibility of controlling behavior.\nRight?\nMR. DONHAM: The -- I think the exact language\nof the Kansas statute, or at least of Mr. Hendricks -- I'm\nsorry. The opinion of Mr. Hendricks was that he admitted\nthat he was unable to control his behavior. The only way\nhe himself could be sure he would never offend again was\nfor him to die.\nQUESTION: I just read -- I just read the\nportion of the -- of the opinion that I think the most\nrelevant, and what it says is difficult, if not\nimpossible, to control behavior. To show utter\nimpossibility to control behavior would be very difficult.\nThat's -- that's what it said.\nNow -- now, you equate that difficulty or if not\nimpossibility to control behavior with volitional\nimpairment. Why do you -- why do you equate that, as I\nthink the Kansas Supreme Court did? They -- they seemed\nto say that if there's no volitional impairment, there\ncannot be this difficulty or impossibility of controlling\nbehavior. But that doesn't seem to me to be true.\nMR. DONHAM: Well, when Mr. Hendricks professed\nthat he could not control his behavior, that's an\nindication that when confronted with temptation, he was\nunable to exercise his free will.\nQUESTION: That's right. In Hendricks it\nhappened to be a volitional impairment. But why do you\nassert that that is the only reason for which one can say\na person is unable to control his behavior? Why isn't\ndelusion a reason why a person can't control his behavior?\nHe doesn't know what he's confronted with.\nMR. DONHAM: Your Honor, I'm not trying to limit\nthe -- what a psychiatrist or a psychologist might be able\nto say affects the ability of an individual to conform his\nbehavior to society's requirements. I'm not standing here\ntoday as a psychiatrist or a psychologist. It's a murky\nsubject at best, and even those who work in it disagree.\nThe principal distinction that I take from the\nHendricks decision is that Mr. Hendricks could not have\nbeen constitutionally involuntarily committed absent that\nadditional element that set him apart from others who\nsimply behave out of clear choice because they lack any\nrespect or moral value.\nQUESTION: Well, I would have thought, really,\nthat that is not what we limited it to in Hendricks, that\na delusional lack of control would be entirely sufficient\nconstitutionally as -- as it relates to a lack of control,\nthat it could be volitional or delusional, that the Kansas\ncourt went too far in requiring only volitional as a\nconstitutional standard.\nMR. DONHAM: Your Honor, I would agree with\nthat.\nQUESTION: Yes, so if you --\nQUESTION: You think the court erred.\nMR. DONHAM: I -- I agree with that and I hope I\nhaven't misled the Court. I -- I've been acting on behalf\nof Mr. --\nQUESTION: So, you agree that the Kansas Supreme\nCourt went too far.\nMR. DONHAM: I agree that they perhaps imposed\ntoo strict a limit on these additional elements that have\nto be found in order to involuntarily commit.\nQUESTION: But that there has to be some\nadditional elements.\nMR. DONHAM: Absolutely.\nQUESTION: And the most appropriate one at hand\nin this case was volitional. Were there any other\nadditional elements that might have been argued in your\ncase? And if not, what are the additional elements that\nmight -- we might encounter in cases somewhat like this?\nMR. DONHAM: Your Honor, to the first part of\nyour question, the only available argument that we could\nhave made, the only conceivable jury instruction that\nwould have been consistent with the contradictory evidence\nat trial and this Court's opinion in Hendricks was a -- a\ndemand for a jury instruction, requiring the jury to find\nthat it was his mental abnormality or his personality\ndisorder that made him be likely to re-offend because it\ninterfered with his ability to control his behavior.\nQUESTION: So, what are the words that you want\nthere? That is, imagine I'm talking about the set of\npeople who are very dangerous. Imagine I'm talking about\nthe set of people who are very dangerous because of a\nmental problem. In defining mental problem, we could have\none subset that has a cognitive disorder well beyond the\nnormal person, including the normal prisoner. We could\nhave a set of people who have an emotional disorder well\nbeyond what the ordinary prisoner recidivist has, and we\ncould be talking about what the Kansas Supreme Court\nthought it was talking about in this case, the set of\npeople who arguably have a volitional disorder. In\nrespect to that, it sounded to me, if that's the subject\nof this case, that the Kansas court used the word cannot\ncontrol, whereas our Court used the word difficult, if not\nimpossible, to control. The only argument here being if\nthere is some difference between those two, and I would\nthink there is.\nBut how should we put that in your opinion?\nWould it satisfy you if we said this case is about\nvolitional disorders, and there the Constitution permits\nus to take a dangerous person and commit him civilly if\nhis ability to control his behavior is significantly, a\nlot, quite a lot less than the ordinary person, including\nthe ordinary prisoner sentenced in a -- in a penitentiary?\nHow do you want -- in other words, I'm looking for the\nproper standard. Cannot sounds too tough. Difficult, if\nnot impossible, maybe that's all right. But that's caused\nconfusion. So, what's your standard?\nMR. DONHAM: Your Honor, I know the State has\ntouted the -- the descriptive adjective adequate control.\nI'm not sure if I know how to answer that. I would think\nthat if you perform the criminal act, your control was not\nadequate. And so, it would seem that what the medical\npersonnel are going to have to end up testifying and what\neventually will be a question for the jury to decide is\nwhether or not, given the opportunity and the chance for\nsuccess at committing a criminal act, this individual\nchose to do that as an exercise of his or her free will or\nwhether or not some overriding mental condition compelled\nthem to act or disabled their capacity to refrain from\nacting.\nQUESTION: I don't -- I really don't understand\nwhere we are now. You're -- you're objecting, as I\nunderstand it now, just to the jury instruction. I mean,\nwe didn't take this case to decide whether the jury\ninstruction was right under the statute or not. You don't\nchallenge the statute. You think the statute is fine.\nIt's just a bad jury instruction that occurred?\nMR. DONHAM: Your Honor, as -- as I read the --\nthe Kansas statute, the legislative body intended that the\nmental defect caused the individual to be likely to commit\nfuture predatory acts of violence.\nQUESTION: No. It -- it says exactly that, and\nyou think that's okay.\nMR. DONHAM: Yes, and this Court --\nQUESTION: And the Kansas Supreme Court didn't\nthink it was okay.\nMR. DONHAM: I disagree with that. I -- I think\n-- and allow me to follow up. This Court in Hendricks\nreinforced the notion that the Kansas act is\nconstitutional because there did exist, at least with Mr.\nHendricks, an additional element that because of that,\nbecause of his mental illness, he was likely to offend.\nThe State -- or the Kansas Supreme Court was\npresented simply the fact pattern in Mr. Crane's case, and\n-- and that fact pattern was essentially -- or at least\nthe State's position was we don't have to prove any kind\nof additional element whatsoever.\nQUESTION: Well, they have to prove the\ncausality. You're saying they don't have to prove\ncausality. I mean, the way the statute reads is: who\nsuffers from a mental abnormality or personality disorder\nwhich makes the person likely to engage in repeat acts of\nsexual violence. It's not just that he's likely to -- to\ncommit future acts of sexual violence, but it also must be\nshown that the reason he's likely to do it is because that\nis caused by a mental abnormality or personality disorder.\nI mean, it seems to me, the statute says exactly what you\nthink it ought to say, and you're just -- you're now\ncomplaining about the jury instruction?\nMR. DONHAM: We did object to the jury\ninstruction because we felt it did not adequately address\nthe theme that the State carried to the jury. What the\nState presented to the jury, through all four of its\nexpert witnesses, is that Mr. Crane satisfied the\ndefinition of a sexually violent predator because of his\nprior repetitive history of criminal offenses. Their own\nexpert, Dr. Mabugat, even testified on the stand that if\n-- that in satisfying this definition, if the jurors only\ntake his current mental status, coupled with his instant\noffense for the aggravated sexual battery, he's not a\nsexually violent predator.\nDr. Mabugat went on to testify --\nQUESTION: Well, just -- just a minute, Mr.\nDonham. The question presented by the State is -- in its\npetition for certiorari is -- is a very general one,\nwhether the Fourteenth Amendment requires the State to\nprove that -- and I think if you're going to bring up a\njury instruction, you're required to cross petition for\ncertiorari and raise that yourself. You didn't do that,\ndid you?\nMR. DONHAM: Yes, sir, I did. I -- I filed in\nmy response an objection to the --\nQUESTION: The Kansas Supreme Court held the\njury instruction bad, did it not?\nMR. DONHAM: I'm sorry. I -- I -- on the\npetition?\nQUESTION: Just answer Justice Stevens'\nquestion.\nMR. DONHAM: I'm sorry, Your Honor. On the --\nQUESTION: Is it not correct that the Kansas\nSupreme Court held that the jury was not properly\ninstructed?\nMR. DONHAM: That's correct.\nQUESTION: It was not properly instructed not\nbecause it was not instructed in accordance with the\nKansas statute, but because if it had been instructed in\naccordance with the Kansas statute, that would have been\nunconstitutional. Wasn't that the basis of the holding?\nAnd you're saying the Kansas statute is not\nunconstitutional. I mean, the whole basis for the Kansas\nSupreme Court thinking that the jury instruction, which\nfollowed the statute, was unconstitutional was, of course,\nthat the statute was unconstitutional.\nBut it seems to me what you're saying here is\nthat the statute is okay. Didn't you say the statute is\nokay now?\nMR. DONHAM: What I said, Your Honor, is that\nthe statute requires that an individual susceptible to\nbeing involuntarily committed must have a mental illness\nthat makes him or her likely to re-offend.\nQUESTION: What it says, right?\nMR. DONHAM: That's correct.\nWhat we ask -- our jury instruction was intended\nto -- to clarify or to put a face to what is intended by\nthis word make. The term make has a lot of definitions,\nand our -- our version of it was that Crane's antisocial\npersonality disorder had to compel him to behave in a\ncertain way or --\nQUESTION: The Kansas Supreme Court appeared to\nhold that a person must be completely unable to control\nhis behavior in order to meet what it thought the\nconstitutional standard is under the Due Process Clause.\nThat's how I read the Kansas opinion, that it thought that\nthere had to be a total, complete lack of control, not\njust substantial, not just adequate lack, a complete lack\nin order to meet U.S. constitutional standards.\nMR. DONHAM: I agree with that. It --\nQUESTION: Well, I don't think I do. I don't\nthink that's what Hendricks said was the constitutional\nstandard. Some lack of control, but I hadn't thought it\nhad to be 100 percent or complete. I thought the Kansas\ncourt got it wrong and went too far. There has to be\nsomething there, but probably not complete.\nMR. DONHAM: Your Honor, I suppose the\ndifference may lie in -- in what is meant by total or\nabsolute lack of control. No doubt an individual who has\ncertain designs to commit an act may exercise at times\nsome degree of control over his or her behavior.\nThe -- the essential element in these\ninvoluntary commitment statutes that must be kept in mind\nis, number one, they're -- they're civil. They're not --\nthey're not criminal. Number two, it's to commit the\nperson to a mental hospital for treatment of the mental\ndisease or defect, and this mental disease or defect must\nbe significant enough to warrant depriving this person of\ntheir liberty.\nQUESTION: Yes. A -- a significant or\nsubstantial lack of control, but to try to move toward an\nirresistible impulse standard would fly in the face of\nwhat the American Psychiatric Association thinks is\nlikely. I mean, it just -- it seemed to me the Kansas\ncourt went somewhat too far in establishing the -- what it\nthought the constitutional requirement was.\nMR. DONHAM: I'm sorry. Was that a question?\nExcuse me.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: You can interpret it as you wish.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: You're free to dispute my\ninterpretation of that --\nMR. DONHAM: Well, some of these terms are --\nare pretty slippery, and of course, they're all taken in\ncontext of what does a psychiatrist mean by them. I'm not\na psychiatrist or a psychologist, but I think that this\nCourt can set a -- a benchmark that can be followed by --\nQUESTION: We're not psychiatrists or\npsychologists either. That's -- that's part of the\nproblem in --\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: -- in our setting as precise a\nbenchmark as you would like us to set.\nQUESTION: Well, what -- did the Kansas Supreme\nCourt quote the very words from Hendricks that Justice\nScalia referred to before to make this finding by linking\nfuture dangerousness to a mental abnormality, a\npersonality disorder, that makes it difficult, if not\nimpossible, to control such behavior? That's what the\nKansas Supreme Court repeated. You seemed to have\nconceded that it went beyond that.\nMR. DONHAM: No. I think my concession to the\n-- to the fact that the Kansas Supreme Court may have\nexpanded its decision for Mr. Crane too far and -- and by\ndoing that, it in essence, if you will, limited the\napplication of the act. By taking the particular fact\npattern of Mr. Crane for which the only available and the\nonly reasonable qualifying mental defect would have been\nthe inability to control behavior and saying that it's now\nrequired for all persons, what the Kansas Supreme Court\ndid was effectively cut off, I think unfairly, the ability\nof the State to incapacitate people who have other type of\nsignificant mental disorders such as Justice Scalia has\npointed out, the hallucinations, the psychoses. Those are\na different breed of mental illnesses with different\neffects.\nQUESTION: Would -- would your objections and\nthe -- and perhaps the Kansas court's objections have been\nmet if instruction no. 9 at page 156 of the joint appendix\nsaid that mental abnormality means a congenital or\nacquired condition substantially affecting the emotional\nor volitional capacity?\nMR. DONHAM: If I were to write the instruction,\nit would have read it is a acquired or congenital\ncondition that affects the emotional or volitional\ncapacity to the degree that the person is unable to\nexercise self-control.\nQUESTION: Just -- what about a person who\nthinks other people are -- are like rocks? You know? I\nmean, he can control himself. He just has a totally\nbizarre emotional -- totally bizarre emotional situation,\nan autistic kind of person unable to understand emotions\nat all. What do we do with that person, absolutely mad as\na hatter, in common parlance, and also dangerous?\nMR. DONHAM: Well, if he's dangerous because --\nQUESTION: Yes. He's dangerous because he's\nautistic or has no sense whatsoever of what a feeling is.\nAll right? Now, can he control himself? Absolutely. He\nhas no volitional impairment. He just has this bizarre\nemotional situation. What do we do about that person?\nAnd, of course, I'll imagine it as bizarre as you want.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. DONHAM: I -- I would say that he's an\nappropriate for an involuntary commitment under the\nprovision --\nQUESTION: Right. So, what standard there do we\nuse?\nMR. DONHAM: That he would be unable --\nQUESTION: So, they can't do it with control\nbecause control has to do with volition.\nMR. DONHAM: This would be a person susceptible\nto commitment because he's unable to care for himself, and\ntherefore poses a danger.\nQUESTION: No. He cares for himself perfectly.\nHe just has this emotional impairment. What do we do?\nIt's a problem.\nMR. DONHAM: Yes, it is. It's a significant\nproblem because were talking about depriving people of\ntheir liberty, and we're -- we're basing it on the\ntestimony of people who don't fully understand their field\nof expertise at times, which is why this Court should set\na high benchmark to preclude the inadvertent commitment of\nsomeone who really shouldn't have gone to a mental\nhospital.\nI'm particularly distressed over the use of an\nantisocial personality disorder in that it is -- it is\ngiven simply to someone who has a history of offenses.\nSo, that history of offenses provides the basis for the\ndiagnosis, and it provides the basis for the prediction of\nfuture dangerousness. In effect, the State seeks to\ninvoluntarily commit someone because they have a long\nprior criminal history.\nMy time is almost up. If there are no more\nquestions.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr. Donham.\n"
