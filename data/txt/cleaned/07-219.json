        "content": "(10:08 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument\nthis morning in Case 07-219, Exxon Shipping Company\nversus Baker, et al.\nMr. Dellinger.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF WALTER DELLINGER\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. DELLINGER: Good morning, Mr. Chief\nJustice, and may it please the Court:\nWhen the Exxon Valdez ran aground in Prince\nWilliam Sound on March 24, 1989, the resulting spill of\n11 million gallons of oil was one of the worst\nenvironmental tragedies in U.S. maritime history.\nThe only remaining aspect -- the only aspect\nof the litigation over the Valdez disaster that is\nbefore the Court today concerns almost entirely lost\nrevenues by the commercial fishing industry. Exxon long\nago paid $400 million in compensation for that lost\nrevenue. At issue here is whether an additional warrant\nto the commercial fishing class of $2.5 billion dollars\nin punitive damages is permissible under Federal\nMaritime Law.\nThe first of the three reasons that the\ndecision below should be reversed is that the Ninth\nCircuit erred in overturning a maritime law rule that\nhas been settled for 200 years. Although a shipowner\nis, of course, liable to fully compensate for all of the\ndamages caused by the wrongful acts of a captain in\ncompensation, it is liable for punitive damages under\nthe long-settled rule only if the shipowner directed,\nratified, or participated in the --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Dellinger, how was\nthat rule settled? You go in that story and The Amiable\nNancy, but no one even raised the question of punitive\nor exemplary damages in those cases. So what is the\nlong-settled line of decisions of this Court in maritime\nlaw that you are relying on?\nMR. DELLINGER: Justice Ginsburg, The\nAmiable Nancy is the only maritime case, but this Court\nin Lake Shore in 1893 --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: That was on land on the\nrailroad.\nMR. DELLINGER: Yes, but this Court's\nunanimous opinion by Justice Gray in Lake Shore cites\nwith approval The Amiable Nancy decision and the\nmaritime context. Three times this Court has considered\nthe question of whether there should be respondeat\nsuperior liability in punitive damages for the wrongful\naction.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You are talking about\nmaritime law, and relying on The Amiable Nancy. And my\nonly point is that was not raised, argued, or decided.\nSo it's rather, I think, an exaggeration to call it a\nlong line of settled decisions in maritime law.\nMR. DELLINGER: Justice Ginsburg, the issue\nhas been so well settled, and Courts of Appeals have so\nlong recognized, that punitive damages are not available\nin vicarious liability in maritime cases that the issue,\nunderstandably, doesn't -- doesn't come up. It's --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And we thought so in\nPrentice.\nMR. DELLINGER: Yes. In Lake Shore versus\nPrentice, this Court did in 1818 and 1893 and 1999\naddress this question, once in the maritime context,\nonce in the context of Federal common law, and once in\nthe particular statutory context of --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, the Lake Shore\ncase, if I remember right, did not involve a managerial\nemployee. It involved a conductor on a train.\nMR. DELLINGER: That's -- that's correct.\nBut it -- but the rule is clear from Lake Shore versus\nPrentice that it is the same rule as The Amiable Nancy\nrule. There is not respondeat superior liability in the\nabsence of some action on the part of the shipowner.\nNow, the reason --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So the shipowner is,\nI suppose, the owner of Exxon or the hundreds of\nthousands of shareholders, right? So you have to have a\nshareholder driving the boat before you can assess\nliability?\nMR. DELLINGER: No. The company acts\nthrough its policymaking officers or through its\npolicies; so that if a reckless judgment is made by\nsomeone who had authority to set policy for the company,\neither the president of Exxon Shipping -- I mean if the\nPlaintiffs were correct that the jury actually,\nnecessarily --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So it's not quite\ncorrect to say only the owner. In other words, it is a\ncertain level of employee, because corporations only act\nthrough individuals. It is a certain level of employee\nin the company.\nNow, where do you draw the line between the\nCEO and the cabin boy? How do you do that? And I would\nsuspect, just instinctively, that somebody driving one\nof these huge tankers is a lot closer to the CEO than\nthe cabin boy.\nMR. DELLINGER: The one thing that,\ntraditionally, if you look at all the Courts of Appeals\ncases and all of the tradition and maritime law, is that\nthe captain or the pilot, anyone on board the ship, does\nnot implicate in punitive damages the company, or the\nshipowner.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: You mean the captain --\nMR. DELLINGER: -- or the ship owner.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- is not a managerial\nofficer for any purpose? Suppose he decides that he's\ngoing to leave despite an adverse weather report? Is he\nnot a managerial agent at least for that?\nMR. DELLINGER: I think the tradition is\nclear, Justice Kennedy, that if it's a -- that the\nmaritime tradition is that, while you are liable for all\nof the harms caused by that, the decisions made on the\nship do not implicate in punitive damages.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I'm -- I'm asking\nabout the concept of the managerial officer in general.\nAnd I think that we can explore in this argument,\nwhether or not The Amiable Nancy held very squarely\nabout punitive damages, whether we ought to do so in the\nfirst instance.\nMR. DELLINGER: That is correct.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And it seems to me a large\npart of that inquiry turns on what a managerial officer\nis and what -- was Hazelwood not a managerial officer\nfor any purpose at all?\nMR. DELLINGER: You know, I can't rule out\nthe possibility that someone in that position might be,\nbut he did not set company policy.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But I thought that you're\ntalking about a different level. I think we ought to be\nclear on this. I thought it was conceded that Hazelwood\nwas, indeed, a \"managerial agent\" as that term is used\nin the Restatement of Torts, right?\nSo you are talking about it's not good\nenough that you are managerial agent; you have to be in\na higher echelon in the company. That's your position?\nMR. DELLINGER: That is correct. There has\n-- one has to be someone with authority to set relevant\npolicy who has some responsibility over that area of the\ncompany's operations that would not --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Why should that be? I\nmean, why should there be a different rule? Let's\nassume -- I mean I'll assume for the sake of argument\nthat The Amiable Nancy does not settle the issue\nabsolutely.\nWhy, then, should the -- and it doesn't, it\nseems to me, settle this distinction at all. So why\nshould there be a distinction between corporations\ngenerally and maritime corporations?\nMR. DELLINGER: Well, there are two\nresponses to that question.\nThe first is that there is -- this has\nworked in the context of maritime law for 200 years, and\n-- and because of the -- there has been a long tradition\nof needing to foster and promote maritime commerce, and\nthe fact that it's thought to be particularly risky and\ndangerous to conduct maritime commerce. But --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, isn't -- isn't part\nof the reason, at least for the assumption that there's\na distinction, something that I think was mentioned in\nThe Amiable Nancy? And that is in those days, when a\nship put to sea, the ship was sort of a floating world\nby itself. And the -- the contact with the shipowner\nwas simply gone until the thing came back into port\nagain.\nThat is certainly not the case today, and we\nknow it's not the case in the circumstances here.\nSo if the -- if the relationship to the\ncorporation, to the CEO, if you will, and the captain of\na vessel is not in any way different from the\nrelationship of the CEO and, say, a division chief of a\ncorporation, I don't see why that distinction should\nhold today.\nMR. DELLINGER: There is no question,\nJustice Souter, but that communications have -- have\nimproved. There is a -- there is much of the tradition\nof maritime law that still obtains. Maritime commerce,\nbecause it takes place on the high seas, is an\ninherently and continuously more risky endeavor than\nmost other occupations, but --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: That may be an argument for\nno punitive damages, but I don't see why it's an\nargument for distinguishing between maritime\ncorporations and others. I mean, other -- other kinds\nof enterprises have a lot of risk in them, too. And I'm\nmissing the distinction there.\nMR. DELLINGER: Well, to the extent that one\ndoesn't see that the tradition of -- of what's worked in\nmaritime law in its own system of law for 200 years\nshould be different, it is not at all clear why the\nmaritime law rule ought not be the rule on land. There\nare eight States --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I had not understood\nyou to concede that -- that the land rule was different\nfrom the maritime rule. I gather that in many States\nit's the same as what you assert the maritime rule to\nbe.\nMR. DELLINGER: That is correct. And it is\nthe rule that this Court adopted in Lake Shore versus\nPrentice, and it is -- it is --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Which was a land case.\nMR. DELLINGER: And the policy behind it --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But you are right, and I\nwant to make -- let me just make clear one other point.\nYou are drawing a distinction, as I understood you to\nsay to Justice Ginsburg, between the Restatement\nposition and your position.\nMR. DELLINGER: That is correct --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.\nMR. DELLINGER: -- although there are some\nStates that have the Restatement position that may read\n\"managerial employee\" in the way that maritime law does,\nand that is a person who is in a position to set\nrelevant policy for the company and not just the branch\nmanager at a -- at a Wal-Mart.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But there aren't many\nStates that follow the Restatement position.\nMR. DELLINGER: That is correct. And -- but\nmy point is not that -- my point is simply that there\nare good reasons for the maritime law rule, and they\nhave been accepted in other cases.\nWhen Justice Gray embraced that rule in the\nLake Shore case, he did so because he thought it\ninappropriate to impose punitive elements on someone who\nwas not actually the wrongdoer. And when Justice\nO'Connor wrote in Kolstad, she spoke of the important\nprinciple underlying common law limitations on vicarious\nliability for punitive damages.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Am I right, Mr.\nDellinger, that in the railroad case the court was\ndealing with the concept of respondeat superior? It\ndidn't make any distinction between regular employees\nand managerial employees, and, indeed, it was not\ndealing with a managerial employee.\nMR. DELLINGER: It was dealing with someone\nwho was at the level of a conductor, I think, exactly on\npar with the captain.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But I don't recall that\nthey made anything about managerial. They were just\ntalking about respondeat superior at large, I thought.\nMR. DELLINGER: Yes. Now, I think --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But I don't think the\nconductor is on a par with a captain. The captain has\nthis huge vessel. He can decide when it leaves. He\ndecides the course. And I think that \"managerial\nofficer\" might be a divisible concept.\nObviously, he doesn't bind Exxon for filing\nits tax returns or to decide whether there's a\ndeduction. But you are saying he binds Exxon for no\npurpose at all, ever.\nMR. DELLINGER: For punitive damages. Of\ncourse, they are bound to pay for all of the harm\ncaused. But that --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Of course, we are talking\nabout punitive damages but at the concept of a\n\"managerial officer.\" And I haven't heard why he isn't\na managerial officer at least as to some things.\nMR. DELLINGER: Well, for two reasons:\nOne, he was unable to set policy for any of\nthese issues. And think of the larger context. The\nreason we want to hold someone, an entity or a person,\nliable in punitive damages is because they make a\ndecision that is malicious or profit-seeking, or\nwhatever.\nWhen you are advancing the policies of the\ncompany and are empowered to advance those policies, and\nyou do so in a way that is either malicious or driven by\nprofit motives or hope to conceal it, when all of those\nthings happen, it is appropriate to visit upon those\npersons the extra punishment of punitive damages.\nAnd that's why it's not the importance of\nthe job. It's the fact that when someone acts contrary\nto the interest -- contrary to the interest of a company\nand its shareholders, why in that instance should\nsomeone who is not advancing the company's interests,\nnot authorized to make policy, do so?\nSo if the --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Are you --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this question,\nMr. Dellinger?\nMR. DELLINGER: Yes.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: In some punitive-damages\ncases, the liability attaches because the person has\nhired someone who is obviously incompetent.\nSupposing that the -- a crew member was --\nan obviously incompetent crew member was hired by the\ncaptain of the ship. Would that be sufficient to\njustify punitive damages?\nMR. DELLINGER: Not against the company that\nowned the ship. Only if someone --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And if he was hired by a\nshore-based personnel, then, would that be the\ndifference for you?\nMR. DELLINGER: The -- only if the company\nat a policymaking level is implicated would the company\n--\nJUSTICE STEVENS: The one -- the company\nsays the captain hires the crew members who could cause\nall sorts of damage. And another company says somebody\non shore can do it. You have a different rule between\nthose two?\nMR. DELLINGER: Oh, well, I think if the\ncase arises in a maritime context, there would not be --\nthere would not be a different rule, whether a decision\nwas made on shore or not. If you are talking about a\nmaritime law case --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Would there be vicarious\nliability or not in the case: Negligence in hiring an\nincompetent crew member?\nMR. DELLINGER: Not unless the decision was\nmade by someone at a policymaking level.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, he has the authority\nto decide who to hire. Is that policymaking?\nMR. DELLINGER: No. That's the\nimplementation of -- that's the implementation of a\npolicy. So I think what -- if you keep in mind the\npurposes of punitive damages, as to whether conduct\nshould be deterred and whether it should be punished,\nand when you are talking about going against the\nshareholders of the company, not -- of course, they have\nto pay for all the compensatory harms. We don't doubt\nthat.\nBut for punishment the notion is that it is\nthe -- that-- that at least eight States have and it is\nin the maritime law rule that you need to show that\nthere is -- that there is --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Recklessness in hiring the\nemployee who caused the damage can be a --\nMR. DELLINGER: Yes, absolutely. We have\nnot disputed the fact that if the jury actually did have\nto conclude that Exxon was reckless in the supervision\nor the hiring or the placement of Hazelwood, that that\nwould be a grounds for imputing punitive-damages\nliability.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: In hiring the third mate\nhere, if he was negligently hired by somebody on shore,\nthere would be liability? But if he was negligently\nhired by the captain, there would be no liability?\nMR. DELLINGER: No. I think it has to do\nwith the level at which the -- at which the hiring\ndecision was made. It has to be a decision -- and I\nthink the way the case was tried it makes sense that if\nsenior officials for Exxon were informed and if the jury\ndecided on the basis that at a high level at Exxon\nShipping that they knew that this person was -- should\nnot be put in command of a ship, and, nonetheless, it\ndid so, that would implicate them. If I could --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: There was -- there was\nsufficient evidence of that. I mean --\nMR. DELLINGER: Yes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The jury could have found\nthat Exxon knew that this captain had a severe alcohol\nproblem; and, yet, they let him stay on voyage after\nvoyage and did nothing about it.\nSo the jury could have found: Never mind\nthe captain. Exxon, itself, is a grave wrongdoer\nbecause it allowed the tanker to be operated by a\ncaptain who was certainly not fit.\nMR. DELLINGER: Yes, and I want to be clear\nabout that. The answer to that question is: Yes, the\njury could have found that Exxon was reckless in\nallowing Hazelwood to command the ship and that that\nrecklessness would implicate the company for punitive\ndamages.\nBut they need not have done so. They need\nnot even have reached the issue, and the court of\nappeals said -- it is at page 88 and 89. The Ninth\nCircuit said that the jury could also, in the\nalternative, have found that Exxon followed a reasonable\npolicy of fostering reporting and treatment by alcohol\nabusers, knew that Hazelwood had obtained treatment, and\ndid not know that he was taking command of the\nship drunk.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: It was a jury question.\nThere was evidence both ways. So, on this issue, am I\nright in thinking that if you succeed, all you can get\nis a new trial?\nMR. DELLINGER: That is correct.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And, I take it, next time\naround the jury would get a special verdict and be\nasked: Was Exxon, itself, reckless in allowing this\ncaptain to stay on the ship?\nMR. DELLINGER: That is correct. That is\ncorrect.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That is only true if\nyou lose on your second and third questions as well,\nright?\nMR. DELLINGER: Yes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The answers to your\nsecond and third questions preclude a new trial?\nMR. DELLINGER: That is correct. And that's\nactually a recent --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Do you want to get --\nlooking at this case of Lake Shore, as I read -- as I\nread that case, I'm thinking that they looked back to\nthe admiralty case, but they're saying this isn't an\nadmiralty rule. It's a Federal rule. And the Federal\nrule is that to make the corporation liable for\npunitives in the absence of bad conduct by anyone in the\ncorporation but for the lower executive, you can't do\nit.\nBut if it were a higher executive, the\npresident and general manager or, in his absence, the\nvice president in his place, then you could.\nSo they are distinguishing among levels of\ncorporate officials. Now that seems to be the Federal\nrule, right?\nMR. DELLINGER: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. Now, what\nhappens to that Federal rule? One thing we know\nhappened to it is that time passed; Erie v. Thompkins\ncame along; and most of the relevant cases left the\nFederal courts or Federal law and were decided under\nState law.\nWas there anything left in the Federal\nsystem besides admiralty where this Federal rule might\napply; and, if so, what happened to it?\nMR. DELLINGER: The only place it would\nremain is in statutory settings where the court has to\nsupply the answer to a question of whether punitive\ndamages are an available remedy in a Title VII case.\nAnd that's -- that's the only --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, what happened? And\nthe reason I think I'd like to know is because it seems\nto me it makes a difference from the point of view of\nstare decisis whether the Federal rule, as Federal rule,\nhas always stayed the same or the Federal rule has\neroded so that in place X and Y it disappears, remaining\nonly in admirality, in which case you have a genuine\noutlier.\nAnd I don't know what the history is.\nMR. DELLINGER: Well, the -- of course, with\nthe -- with the replacement of the Arrowsmith versus\nTyson by Erie against Thompkins, it was no longer a\nbroad area.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I know. That's beside the\npoint to my question.\nMR. DELLINGER: In the lower courts the rule\nhas continued as a maritime rule law. It has worked\nwithin the context of a maritime law rule. Maritime is\nits own system of law. The fact that West Virginia --\nWest Virginia has a different law than this Court's\nmaritime law --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Let me just interrupt. To\nwhat extent is present maritime law informed by State\ncommon law throughout the country?\nMR. DELLINGER: It is in the absence of a --\nin the absence of a Federal rule, but here the -- there\nare -- there's not uniformity among the States.\nTo turn to the second question of whether --\nwhich would actually preclude the need even to resolve\nThe Amiable Nancy issue as to whether there should be as\na matter of judge-made maritime law a punitive-damages\nremedy for unintentional oil spills. Now, the starting\npoint to think about that, I believe, is this Court's\ndecision in Milwaukee versus Illinois in 1981.\nThis is the standard the Court set: Federal\ncourts create common law only as a necessary expedient\nwhen problems requiring Federal answers are not\naddressed by Federal statutory law. That precisely\ndescribes this case.\nThe Court looking out --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, the City of\nMilwaukee involved the displacement by Federal statutory\nlaw of Federal common law. Your case involves the\ndisplacement of Federal maritime law by Federal\nstatutory law.\nFederal maritime law is routine. Federal\ncourts do that all the time. Federal common law is\nunusual, and in the City of Milwaukee was resorted to\nsimply by necessity.\nDoesn't that suggest that whatever the\nFederal maritime rule on punitive damages is, it's a\nharder showing on your part to conclude that it's\ndisplaced by the statutory process?\nMR. DELLINGER: Well, the reason I think\nthat's not -- not the case is twofold.\nFirst of all, the era in which this Court\ncreated lots of admiralty law has receded itself because\nCongress has become active, and then there's no longer\na -- as necessary, a role for this Court.\nJustice O'Connor, for example, said that in\n-- that we sail -- the courts sail -- now sail in\noccupied waters in making maritime law because of the\namount of Federal statutory law.\nAnd, secondly, the assumption that there was\na well developed punitive damages remedy in maritime\nlaw, and that we have a harder road to show that the\nexistence of a series of Federal statutes eliminates the\nneed for that, is just not established.\nThis Court itself has never affirmed an\naward of punitive damages under maritime law. It has\nnever held that punitive damages are available for\nunintentional conduct in maritime law. It has never\nheld that they were available for oil spills.\nThere were only four cases of Federal\nmaritime punitive damage awards in the history of the\ncountry before the Clean Water Act was passed.\nProfessor Robinson finds eight more cases that don't use\nthe term \"punitive damages\" or \"exemplary,\" or anything\nelse; but, at most, that would be 12. We think the\nanswer is four.\nSo that -- and, in fact, the largest award\never -- ever made was for $500,000. So there was no --\nand that was after the Clean Water Act. So there's no\nestablished tradition of -- of punitive damages.\nThis Court would be making a major step to\naffirm an award, to play a role, in an unintentional\ncase of punitive damages in maritime law for oil spills.\nBecause what Congress has done here is to obviate the\nneed for a remedy by passing a comprehensive and\ncarefully calibrated statute.\nBut the hallmark of the Clean Water Act is\nthe obvious effort to balance --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. -- Mr. Dellinger,\nbefore we get into the merits of that issue, the Clean\nWater Act did not enter this case until 13 months after\nthe jury verdict. And the trial court, who had very\ncarefully managed this case -- and it was a humongous\ncase -- would never list it as an issue in the case.\nAnd so he said: I won't hear it 13 months after the\nverdict.\nWhy shouldn't we instruct the court of\nappeals that when a district judge does a diligent job\nlike that one did to try to get at all the issues --\nsays you're too late; you can't come in 13 months after\nthe verdict and argue a point of law that would have\novertaken the verdict, because essentially you're asking\nfor judgment as a matter of law on this issue.\nMR. DELLINGER: Justice Ginsburg, that sort\nof concern has much more force if you are talking about\nissues that go to the substantiality of the evidence.\nBut here the court of appeals --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: No. Well, what did you\nmake -- you made a motion to bring up the Clean Water\nAct as dispositive on punitive damages, and you made\nthat motion 13 months after the jury verdict.\nMR. DELLINGER: Right.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And what is the basis in\nthe Federal rules for that motion?\nMR. DELLINGER: The motion was made before\nthe entry of judgment.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: 13 months after the\nverdict.\nMR. DELLINGER: That -- the motion was\nnot on -- on -- the court of appeals held -- not only\ndid the court of appeals press -- not only was the issue\npressed and passed upon by the court of appeals, the\ncourt of appeals held that the district court was wrong\nin assuming that it was waived. The district court was\ntold by the plaintiffs that this was the same motion --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But I -- that's not my\nquestion. My question is: Under what Federal rules did\nyou move to bring up this issue 13 months after the\nverdict?\nMR. DELLINGER: It was under rule 59, under\nrule 49.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: 49 is on special\nverdicts. What did this have to do with special\nverdicts?\nMR. DELLINGER: I'm sorry. It was a rule 50\n-- it was a rule 50 motion. It was not untimely, and\nthe court of appeals --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Rule 50 is pretty strict,\nisn't it? I mean, rule 50 -- if you want to use rule\n50, you have to first move before the case goes to the\njury. And if the judge says no, I'll reserve it. Then\nyou move again after the jury. And if you don't, it's\ngot very tight timelines.\nAnd you are arguing to a court that has held\nthat these limitations in the Federal rules must be\nstrictly observed. And I don't know of any time limit\nin the Federal rules that's stricter than the rules that\ninvolve 50(b).\nMR. DELLINGER: Justice Ginsburg, there are\nseveral answers to the waiver question. First of all,\nthis Court has the authority to based upon it because\nthe court appeal based upon it. Secondly, the court of\nappeals correctly said that as the -- the plaintiffs had\ntold the judge, that motion, he need not rule on because\nit is the same motion that the -- that had been made\nearlier. Now the earlier motion was based upon the\nTAPAA Act, as -- that it features it as a reason why the\ncourt need not create or recognize a punitive damages\nremedy. The second motion --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And you didn't appeal on\nthat. You raised it properly, you lost on it, and you\ndidn't appeal on TAPAA.\nMR. DELLINGER: That would be the case if we\nhadn't raised it all. We raised it both times, the\ncourt said it was the same motion. Here's what the\ncourt of appeals said. The court of appeals said that\nExxon clearly and consistently argued statutory\npreemption as one of the theories --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Statutory. But the\nstatute was TAPAA, and it was not the Clean Water Act.\nMR. DELLINGER: That is correct. But the\nessential argument, the court of appeals is the same,\nand if the issue were not raised -- even if the issue\nhad not been raised at all in the trial court, even if\nthe had not been put before the district court, the\ncourt of appeals still could have agreed to hear the\nquestion of whether a punitive damages remedy is\nobviated by the panoply of Federal statutes that are out\nthere. That -- that there is -- there was an exercise\nof the court of appeals. The decision is now the law in\nthe Ninth Circuit and this Court has full authority to\nreview it, because as the --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: As you know, there were\nor at least some strong amici briefs in this case that\nhave asked this Court, tell the court of appeals that's\nno way to operate vis-a-vis district courts.\nMR. DELLINGER: Well, the -- even Professor\nMiller recognizes that this is not jurisdictional and\nthat the court has the power to do it, the power to hear\nthis case. And it is before it. And -- and even if the\nmatter had not been raised in the district court, the\ncourt of appeals had authority to consider it. And\nthere's --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Dellinger, did\nyou say you had a second and a third point?\nMR. DELLINGER: Yes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You going to get to\nthem?\nMR. DELLINGER: Oh, uh -- yes, indeed.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: All right.\nMR. DELLINGER: The -- the Clean Water Act,\nthe reason it's an important issue, is that the one\nthing that Congress has not done, whether it's in TAPAA,\nin the Clean Water Act or the Oil Pollution Act, is they\nhave not provided for punitive damages but moreover,\nthey have never had any remedy that is uncalibrated,\nthat is limitless, that is not carefully measured so\nthat it respects the need to protect the interests to be\nprotective by those laws, by the interest in clean\nwater, with a decision not to overdeter.\nThe problem with having a punitive damages\nremedy in an area where punitive damages has played no\nsignificant role, that is judge-made, is that it simply\nobliterates the balance that Congress has struck. If\nyou look at the --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: You're talking about\ntradition. It has never been the tradition for criminal\nstatutes to have open-ended penalties. So that -- that\nexplains why the CWA has specific limits.\nMR. DELLINGER: Even on civil fines, even on\nother aspects of it, there is -- there is a careful\ncalibration. And once Congress has decided that the\nlimits of liability are twice the measurable pecuniary\nloss, to add to that careful set of remedies that\nCongress has adopted another remedy that is however many\nbillions of dollars the jury might choose totally\nunsettled the scheme when Congress has addressed the\nvery issue. When you ask the question: Are punitive\ndamages available for oil spills, and you look at the\nClean Water Act, which covers so much of the territory\nof this act, it is hard to make out the case that --\nthat there's a need for a judicially created remedy,\nparticularly when the judicially created remedy, unlike\nsomething that was done by Congress comes without caps,\nwithout structure, without guidance.\nIf Congress were to decide that a\npunitive-damages remedy, it's likely that they would\nplace some kind of structural limits or caps on it and\nnot have this limitless, free-floating --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, perhaps that's a\nsegue to point No. 3. I don't wish to --\nMR. DELLINGER: No. That's a -- I think\nthat --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- to cut you off. On\npoint --\nMR. DELLINGER: Even if the --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: On point No. 3 --\nMR. DELLINGER: I'm sorry. You have a\nquestion?\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: My only question is this:\nAssume that there will be punitive damages applicable to\nExxon under maritime law in in case. We have read in\nthe briefs about the limits that should be imposed on\nthese punitive damages. And those are from our\ndue-process cases.\nIf we are deciding this case as a matter of\nour authority to determine Federal maritime law, are\nthere factors that we should include in a\npunitive-damages framework that do not -- that do not\nappear in our due-process cases? And, if so, what are\nthose factors?\nMR. DELLINGER: Well, I think surely that's\nright. And the -- your question recognizes, as have\nindividual Justices, that -- that here you are like a\nState court in the sense that, as Justice Scalia said,\nState courts have ample authority to eliminate\nunfairness and to set their own rules in this area, as\nyou do here.\nNow, the first --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You would say one of those\nfactors is the Clean Water Act, wouldn't you?\nMR. DELLINGER: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Even if it is not\npre-emptive as a matter of law, it's one of the factors\nthat you can bring to the Court's attention, I suppose.\nMR. DELLINGER: That is correct.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And I take it, under that,\nyou would point to the double -- the provision for a\nfine double the amount of the damages? That would be a\nfactor?\nMR. DELLINGER: The --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I mean, if we're looking\nfor guidelines --\nMR. DELLINGER: Yes. A double --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- double general damages\nis a factor that we could -- that we could follow in the\nmaritime framework?\nMR. DELLINGER: Yes, but you would look to\nwhat the criminal penalty is that's actually imposed.\nThe Court has said civil fines are a better guide. And\nthe civil fine, the maximum civil fine here for both the\nState of Alaska and the United States, would be $80\nmillion.\nIf you look to what the responsible law\nenforcement authorities and public officials of both the\nUnited States and Alaska thought was the proper amount,\nthey imposed a criminal fine of $150 million, which was\nreduced to $25 million because of the cleanup efforts\nand the fact that Exxon prepaid $300 million of the\nlosses in advance.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What about looking at\nwhat this Court said in TXO was proper in a\npunitive-damages case? That is, this spill was\nhorrendous, but it could have been far worse.\nAnd so, under TXO, you look at what was the\n-- could be the maximum damage that could have been\ncaused by this occurrence, and that could be many\ntimes --\nMR. DELLINGER: Well, there was -- first of\nall, it would be different to look at potential harm if\nthe potential harm were attempted by the defendant, and\nthe defendant had been unable to carry out the --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But it wasn't --\nMR. DELLINGER: -- the planned harm.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- a factor here. I\nmean, wasn't the example that the captain was trying to\nmaneuver the ship after the disaster in such a way that\nwould have made it much worse?\nMR. DELLINGER: That was not even the basis\nof liability that was put before the jury. And if you\n-- and -- nor was it shown that that -- that that would\nhave caused harm.\nWhat -- what you really have here is you --\nthe first thing you would start with, Justice Kennedy,\nis to ask whether it is necessary for punishment and\ndeterrence.\nAnd when you start with payments that have\nreached $3.4 billion in terms of compensation, fines,\nremediation, restitution, that clearly obviates the need\nfor deterrence.\nAnd if you look to -- if you look to\npunishment -- if you look to punishment, here the one\nthing that is clear is that this was not an intentional\nact. It was not malicious. The company did not stand\nto make one dollar of profit. There was no effort to\nenhance the profits of the company, nor was there any\npossibility of concealment.\nAnd what the -- what the Plaintiffs put\nbefore this Court, the Respondents in this case, are a\nnumber of issues that were never put before the jury,\nnot part of the case, by people who were not even\nplaintiffs; matters that were outside of the record and\ncontrary to the instructions. So that the jury was told\ncompensation --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: What would be the\nformulation of the rule if the Court thinks that any\nadded amount would not deter, and how do we know that?\nHow do you formulate this rule?\nMR. DELLINGER: Well, it is absolutely\nessential to formulate some kind of rule. The best\nguide is to look, I think, at civil penalties, which\ngets to -- to $80 million, but to look to what the Court\nsaid in your opinion in State Farm, where -- where\ncompensatories are so substantial it may eliminate any\nneed for additional punitive-damages remedy. There's --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: May I go back to your\ncivil-penalty point?\nMR. DELLINGER: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Isn't the problem with the\ncivil-penalty argument is -- that the civil penalties\nwere calibrated for environmental damage, and what we\nare dealing with here is individual economic damage? So\nwe've got an apples and oranges comparison, haven't we?\nMR. DELLINGER: Well, two responses:\nFirst of all, the $150 million penalty did\n-- the purpose of the Clean Water Act also includes\nprotection of property. So it's not just for the\nenvironment. And, indeed, part of the reason for\ncutting the $150 million award was the compensation that\nhad been paid.\nBut, secondly, if you --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: To the -- for lost trade or\nsomething?\nMR. DELLINGER: Right. It -- even if you\ntook that as calibrated to the environmental damage, the\nenvironmental damage was twice what the compensation --\nthe total compensation paid was $500 million. The\ncompany paid nearly a billion dollars for natural\nresources harm.\nIf $150 million was the right amount for the\nenvironmental damage, then the right amount for the half\nof that that constitutes the lost wages would be $75\nmillion, which is itself close to the $80 million.\nBut here I think that it is incumbent upon\nthe Plaintiffs to show why you need deterrence when\nthere was no profit motive, and you've had to pay $3.4\nmillion dollars. And when if you look to punishment,\nthat can't be a black hole into which all the limits on\npunitive damages disappear.\nIt's whether that -- if this Court can't set\nstandards that would limit an award of this kind, that\nis a reason for believing that this ought to be done by\nCongress if there are going to be punitive damages.\nI'd like to reserve --\nJUSTICE BREYER: But the -- I mean, the\nobvious kind of thing would to be say that the standard\nwould depend upon the reprehensibility of the conduct of\nthe officer of the corporation, including the captain,\nif you lost on that.\nAnd where we said roughly before zero to 10\n-- and you are quite right that this is a huge amount of\nmoney -- you'd say zero to five, up to five times. I\nmean that would be rough and ready. But the idea would\nbe to impose enormous deterrence upon large firms\ninvolved in your industry that you are representing not\nto make certain the officers on the ship behave in a\nreprehensible way.\nIt's crude, but I mean that's the kind of\nthing that we said in the due-process cases.\nMR. DELLINGER: Well --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Then why wouldn't you --\nMR. DELLINGER: Keep in --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Why wouldn't you --\nMR. DELLINGER: Keep in mind that the\nlargest award in the history of punitive damages was an\naward for 500,000. That was 1/14 --\nJUSTICE BREYER: You're going to say --\nyou're going to hear in two seconds -- they're going to\nsay this is the company that makes the most amazing\nprofit, et cetera. And so you're trying to deter them.\nSo we know what, you know -- so, what do you say to\nthat?\nMR. DELLINGER: I -- I say that this -- that\nthe amount is enough to deter anybody for anything when\nit is $3.4 billion. And it's hard to know how you could\nhave a punitive rationale for something which was\nunintentional, not designed to make a profit, and could\nnot have been concealed.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Fisher.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L. FISHER\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. FISHER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nEach of the three rulings at issue here\nrests firmly in the mainstream of American tort law.\nAnd there is no reason in maritime jurisprudence to\ndepart from those rules.\nI want to start with the first question\npresented, what Exxon calls the vicarious liability\nissue. And I think it's important to frame the\ndiscussion by starting with the actual jury instruction\nthat's at issue in this case. It's at Pet. App. 301a.\nIt says that a managerial agent is someone\nwho supervises other employees and has responsibility\nfor, and authority over, particular aspects of a\ncorporation's business.\nAnd, as Justice Ginsburg noted, Exxon has\nnever disputed that Captain Hazelwood satisfied this\ndefinition. As its own internal documents explain,\nCaptain Hazelwood was in charge of what they called a\nbusiness unit of Exxon Shipping. He was in charge of\nhundreds of millions of dollars of equipment, of\nproduct; he was in charge of budgeting and personnel\nwith respect to the vessel; he was also in charge of\nsafety. He was the person who decided on behalf of\nExxon that it was safe to leave port the night of March\n23, 1989.\nNow, it is our submission that it is\nperfectly appropriate to expose the corporation to\npunitive damages based on the reckless acts of such an\nindividual.\nIn doing so, it does not, as Exxon would\ncontend, impose vicarious liability. Rather, what it\ndoes is it exposes a corporation to liability based on\nits own culpability.\nThe very point of the restatement test, as\nopposed to the vicarious liability rule that is followed\nby the majority of the States, is that it requires some\ncomplicity on the part of the corporation.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if it's the\nlookout posted -- I don't know if they have one -- but\nthe lookout posted in the front of the ship, and he is\ndrunk, and doesn't see the reef or something? Is the\ncorporation liable in that case?\nMR. FISHER: Not for punitive damages,\nMr. Chief Justice. And the reason why is because the\nlookout does not run a business unit of Exxon Shipping.\nWhat is happening here -- and I want to\nfocus on this for a moment because Mr. Dellinger --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you regard the\nship as a business unit?\nMR. FISHER: That's what Exxon regarded the\nship as, and so that's what the record says. And the\nidea is that you had --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's different if\nthey say that it's -- depending on how they categorize\nthe different units tells whether they are liable or\nnot?\nMR. FISHER: Well, I don't want to rest\nprimarily on labels. The idea is function. And I\nthink, going back to the instruction, what the\ninstruction is asking the jury to determine is: Is this\na person who has authority over an aspect of a\ncorporation's business? I think a shorthand for that is\nin Exxon's own documents that it is --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: In respect, I mean, the\njanitor has authority over an aspect of the corporation.\nI mean, surely, that can't be the test.\nMR. FISHER: Well, I think the authority --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I assume the test is the\nperson has to be high enough that it justifies holding\nthe entire corporation. And I doubt whether a captain\nis -- is high enough. How many of these units does\nExxon have?\nMR. FISHER: There are about 20 vessels like\nthe Valdez.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Twenty vessels.\nMR. FISHER: Now, I think Mr. Chief Justice\nhad it right when he said it's no answer to say it can't\nbe the master; it has to be the corporation. The\ncorporation can only act through people. So there has\nto be a line drawing that takes place.\nNow, this notion of the idea that the master\nisn't good enough because he had to be a policymaker is\nnew to us.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That was a question\nthat I asked, not a statement.\nWell, how do you draw the line? I mean, is\nthe second in command on the boat a man responsible for\npolicy?\nMR. FISHER: He may not be. I don't think\nthe question is whether he's responsible for policy.\nAgain, it's whether he's the person in charge.\nWhat Exxon during instruction to the\ndistrict court asked the jury to be required to find is\nthat there was a shore-based supervisory official of the\nExxon defendants who made the decision. So Exxon itself\nrecognized that you have to draw the line somewhere.\nWe think the best place to draw the line,\nand the conservative place to law, the line is the\nmanagerial-agent rule that's in the Restatement.\nNow, Mr. Dellinger says there are eight\nStates that follow a different rule. And it's important\nto understand that that's not the case. Even among the\nStates that follow the Lake Shore formulation in\ngeneral, you still have to have a way to implement it.\nIt's not -- the idea is if the corporation has to be\ncomplicit, you still have to tell the jury which human\nbeings they can look to for that complicity.\nSo at page 33 of our red brief --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I thought the Lake Shore --\nwell, I thought the Lake Shore and Amiable whatever it\nis principle was that a captain ain't one of those. The\ncaptain doesn't -- doesn't do the job.\nMR. FISHER: There was no captain at issue\nin Amiable Nancy. And, Of course, there wasn't a\ncaptain at issue in Lake Shore, because it was a\nland-based case.\nBut on page 33 of our red brief we've given\nyou seven -- several States that say we follow the\ncomplicity test, and here's how you do it. You require\nthe jury to find that the person is at least a\nmanagerial agent.\nExxon itself in its reply brief on page --\npage 11, footnote 5, cites several States. And I gather\nthese are the States to which Mr. Dellinger is referring\nwhen he says there are eight States that follow our\nrule.\nWell, we did some research after getting the\nreply brief, and I want to give you a few cites, because\nit illustrates the principle yet again. Several of\nthose States say we follow the Lake Shore complicity\nidea. And, therefore, the way we do it is we require a\njury to find at least a managerial agent. So Kansas is\na State that Exxon cites.\nIn the Flint Hills case at 941 P.2d 374,\nKansas says the way in modern times you implement Lake\nShore is you require a managerial agent. In\nConnecticut, the Stoltz case 867 A.2d 860, and in the\nD.C. Circuit, Justice Scalia, they quote one of your\nopinions. If you look at D.C. law, the D.C. Court of\nAppeals itself and a D.C. circuit in another case have\nsaid -- and this is the Arthur Young case, 631 A.2d 354,\nand the GMAC case at 273 F.2d 92 --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Do any of those cases say\nthe managerial agent is liable if he violated express\ninstructions from an employer?\nMR. FISHER: No State tort case that we're\naware of, Justice Kennedy, adopts -- I think what you're\nreferring to is the Kolstad policy exception.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Because that's what the\nlast part of your instruction 33 says. And it does seem\nto me that this captain may be managerial for some\npurposes and not others. I think that's the way it's\ngoing to have to come out. Maybe not. But certainly he\nwas not entitled to set aside the policy of Exxon that\nyou cannot navigate a vessel while intoxicated.\nMR. FISHER: Well, I think I want to say two\nthings. The first is that, as I understand it, Exxon\nhas conceded across the board that Captain Hazelwood is\na managerial agent. And in this case -- in this Court's\nown Kolstad case, if you look at it again, it says\nAmiable Nancy, Lake Shore and the way you implement\nthat --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But they have not conceded\nthe accuracy or correctness of instruction 33. And\nthat's because he was not entitled to set aside the\npolicy on intoxication.\nMR. FISHER: Well, if you were to adopt a\nrule that no other State has adopted, which is to say\nthere was a policy defense in ordinary tort cases, which\nunlike Kolstad do not rest on the subjective knowledge\nof the actor, even then, we submit, we tried that issue\nin this case, Justice Kennedy; and there was -- Exxon\nhad every opportunity to argue policy. In its closing\nargument to the jury, the only policy it mentioned was\nthe policy of two officers on the bridge while\ntransporting --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: No. Your instruction says\nif he was a managerial agent, his acts are attributable\nto the corporation. That's it.\nMR. FISHER: That's right, Justice Kennedy.\nWe think that's the proper rule of law.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So the corporation's\nresponsibility or complicity or culpability is simply\nnot relevant under your theory of the case, even though\nthat's what you talk about in your brief.\nMR. FISHER: Well, I don't want to act like\na dog chasing his tail here, Justice Kennedy, but the\nidea is to ask whether the corporation is culpable, you\nhave to ask which people. And what happened in this\nCourt's own decision in Kolstad said in implementing\nLake Shore that you look to the managerial agents. And\nthat's what --\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's -- that's why I'm\ninterested in the same question I asked on the other\nside. As I read Lake Shore, it seemed to me my first\nreading of it that it picked up this distinction that\nJustice Story made, and it said quite right, you could\nimpute punitives or exemplary damages to a corporation\nwhere its managerial official is the one who causes --\nwho behaves recklessly. But wait, we don't mean quite\nthat. We mean some managerial officials.\nAnd they seem to refer in the admiralty\ncase, I'll tell you one who he isn't, namely, the ship's\ncaptain. He's not in that category. And then in this\nother case, they say -- they talk about a superintending\nagent authorized to imply, employ, and discharge the\nconductor.\nAnd they give that as an example of a\nmanagerial official where there would not be exemplary\ndamages assessed against the corporation in light of his\nconduct.\nSo when I read that, I thought that this\nLake Shore case is just picking up the earlier case; and\nthat's the Federal law. And you've given the examples\nwhere the State law has changed; and I have no doubt you\nare right. You read the cases very well.\nBut is there an example where I could say\nthat the Federal law has changed, too? And you started\ndown that track, but the reason this is of probably more\nthan inordinate concern to me is that I wrote the case\nin Sand, I wrote a dissent in Legion, I looked into\nstare decisis law and made fairly clear views of what it\nis.\nSo what would you say to someone who has\naccepted certain legal principles that we have had in\nprior cases? And you want to say nonetheless you win.\nOkay. Why?\nMR. FISHER: Three reasons, Justice Breyer.\nThe first is with all due respect, Amiable Nancy did not\ninvolve the wrongdoing of the captain. It involved the\nwrongdoing of a lower officer on the ship; and so\nit's -- there's nothing in the Amiable Nancy that deals\nwith captains, so you don't have a stare decisis effect\nthat comes from Amiable Nancy with respect to captains.\nThe second thing is there are some more\nrecent Federal cases that discuss the Lake Shore\nmanagerial agent idea. We've cited them in our -- in\nour red brief along through -- I'm flipping now -- but\nthere are RICO cases; there are other cases, and\nMr. Dellinger said, where statutory case -- statutory\nregimes need to be implemented. And we have cited\nseveral lower court decisions that look to the\nmanagerial agent rule to do that, none of this Court.\nThe third thing is to understand, as you\ntalked about in Lake Shore, you are having to pick\nsomebody, and the general idea is higher up is okay, and\nway down low is not okay. Fletcher in his Cyclopedia on\ncorporations says that if the Lake Shore idea is to make\nsense today, you have to understand that when you're\ndealing with humongous corporations, you have to look\nnot just to the president or vice president -- and this\nis what the D.C. Circuit said in the GMAC case as well\n-- is that when you deal with multinational corporations\nwith tens of thousands of employees and divisions, you\nlook to -- you look a little bit lower down than those\ntop job titles to managers.\nAnd so again this is what Professor\nSchoenbaum says in his amicus brief to this Court\ndealing with that from a maritime perspective.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Fisher, you --\nyour friend says in his reply brief that you cannot cite\none U.S. maritime case that has allowed vicarious\nliability for punitive damages. Is this the first one?\nMR. FISHER: No, it would not be, Mr. Chief\nJustice. What we did --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What's your best\ncase?\nMR. FISHER: What we did our reply brief --\nI'm sorry, what we did in our red brief is cite to\nProfessor Robertson's article in saying that he\ncollected the cases, and which he did; and so our best\ncases are the City of Carlisle case, the Ludlow and\nRalston against States Rights is very close. There's a\ndistinction in Ralston versus exemplary --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, let's take --\ntake the Ludlow. Mr. Dellinger says that's a case where\nthe court found that the owner is not vicariously\nliable.\nMR. FISHER: We don't think that's the right\nreading of the case. We submit -- we have a footnote in\nour own brief that says that there are only two cases\nthat they cite in which a captain's conduct is not\nimputed to the ship's owner. They are both more than\n100 years old, and neither of them deal with\ncorporations.\nSo I think it is entirely fair to say that\nyou have more or less an open issue before you today.\nWhat I think I want to be sure the Court understands,\nthough, is that there is not a stare decisis problem\nthat this Court has to confront with respect to the\nfirst question. You have a spattering of a few old\ncases that lean in different directions.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And so it differs from\nSand, for example, where they are like two cases?\nMR. FISHER: Pardon me?\nJUSTICE BREYER: It differs from Sand? You\nsay it is not -- I'm interested in your last remark. In\nthe Sand ways I found -- you know we went through it,\npublic policy was on the other side. But -- but we had\nseveral cases, it wasn't a thousand; it was more like\ntwo; and the Supreme Court had said in two cases, one\nvery clearly, you know -- you see the point there.\nMR. FISHER: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Why do you say there is no\nstare decisis problem?\nMR. FISHER: Well, because neither Amiable\nNancy nor the Lake Shore case, which are the only two\ncases from this Court, dealt with a managerial agent.\nThe more recent cases from this Court, Hydrolevel and\nKolstad -- Hydrolevel says any agent for treble damages\nfor antitrust, and Kolstad follows the managerial agent\nprinciple, following in the natural evolution of Amiable\nNancy and Lake Shore.\nSo I don't think this Court has ever\nconsidered it to be any stare decisis problem, even if\nall of the lower courts were lined up against it, which\nis far from the -- far from the case here. What you\nhave is a just few lower courts in either correction. I\ngather that's one of the reasons why this Court decided\nto grant certiorari in this case, because there's some\ndispute among the lower courts as to exactly how this\nprinciple works in maritime law.\nBut again, we don't think there's any\nproblem with this Court --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That, and $3.5 billion.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. FISHER: I said one of the reasons,\nJustice Scalia.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: There's some confusion,\nMr. Fisher, about this Kolstad. I take your -- it has\nentered this case at two levels. One is this business\nabout the company policy; but as far as Exxon having a\npolicy, you don't mix alcohol with employment on a\ntanker; but Kolstad said it has to be a consistently\nenforced policy. So you don't have any problem with\nKolstad on that issue, if you're using it here for a\nmanagerial --\nMR. FISHER: Kolstad starts from the\nproposition of managerial agent is the proper way to\nimplement a complicity rule.\nThere's a second part of Kolstad that says\nwe have to change what we think is the ordinary common\nlaw rule, the proper Federal common law rule. We have\nto change it in the context of Title VII because of the\nunusual situation in which employers can be held liable\nbased on the subjective knowledge of the wrongdoer; and\ntort law is exactly the opposite. It is an objective\ntest. And so there's no worry in imposing punitive\ndamages here, that you're going to -- that you're going\nto dissuade an employer from training its employees.\nNow, on the facts, even if you were to agree\nwith me on that legal argument, you're exactly right on\nthe facts, Justice Ginsburg. Exxon had a paper alcohol\npolicy that prohibited drinking aboard ship, just like\nthe Coast Guard has a policy to that effect. But the\nevidence in this case was that Exxon didn't enforce it.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So in your theory of the\ncase, instruction 33, if the superior had told Hazelwood\ndon't pilot the ship today, Exxon would still be liable?\nThat's your theory of the case under instruction 33?\nMR. FISHER: On the --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Or the last part of the\ninstruction 36, I think.\nMR. FISHER: On the first part of the case\nin phase one that was our -- that was the legal theory,\nJustice -- you're right, Justice Kennedy. But in phase\nthree of the trial when a jury decided whether to award\npunitive damages, the instructions told it, among other\nthings -- this is instruction 30 in phase three -- it\ntold among other things to consider whether or not the\nwrongdoers were violating company policy.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but that -- that\ngoes to measures, not to liability.\nMR. FISHER: Absolutely.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: That was the first phase.\nAnd that's the instruction, it seems to me, that you\nhave to explain.\nMR. FISHER: Well, I -- I accept that, and I\nthink I've explained that by distinguishing an ordinary\ntort case from the situation in Title VII. I think it's\ninstructive for this Court, and we agree with Exxon that\nwhen this Court sits as a maritime court, it looks for\nguidance to what other State courts have done. And we\nthink it's instructive that not one single State court,\neither before or after Kolstad, has adopted a policy\ndefense for defendants. There's simply no such decision\non the books outside of discrimination cases.\nWe think --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What is your\nposition of how to look at the case if you have a\nmanagerial employee who acts contrary to corporate\npolicy? Is the corporation still exposed to punitive\ndamages?\nMR. FISHER: In a tort case, Your Honor?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: In a case like this.\nMR. FISHER: Yes. We think -- and that's --\nand that's what instruction Justice Kennedy --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So what can a\ncorporation do to protect itself against punitive\ndamages awards such as this?\nMR. FISHER: Well, it can hire fit and\ncompetent people who it decides --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, and assume it\nhas a policy that we will hire fit and competent people?\nMR. FISHER: Well --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And you're saying --\nthat's the question I'm asking. What if there is a\nbreach of the corporate policy? I don't see what more a\ncorporation can do. I mean, your --- other than --\nother than what? I mean it has to say that the policy\nis this, and if somebody breaks the policy, they're\nliable for compensatory damages, which can as this case\nshows be in the billions of dollars, and of course the\nindividual is liable for punitive and other awards.\nBut what more can the corporation do other\nthan say here is our policies? And try to implement\nthem.\nMR. FISHER: Apart from adopting a policy,\nthey need to implement it soundly. And the argument\nyou're making, if I understand it correctly, would\nobtain just as easily if the vice president of Exxon\nCorporation or the president of Exxon Shipping, whom\nMr. Dellinger says would put Exxon on the hook, had made\nthe decision to put Joe Hazelwood in command of this\nship. And so you always have the problem --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: At that level -- at\nthat level, the president, I think you would have an\nargument that the policy was being changed. It's not\nclear that that argument works when you're dealing with\nsomeone at Mr. Hazelwood's level.\nMR. FISHER: Well, in some -- I think in\nsome respects we're back to the argument of where you\ndraw the line. But let's look at the conduct in this\ncase. Who made the decision that it was safe to depart\nport that night on behalf of Exxon Corporation? Captain\nHazelwood. The record unequivocally says that Captain\nHazelwood is the one who made that policy decision.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Let me throw this thought\non the table. If the policy is made by the board of\ndirectors, can the president unilaterally change the\npolicy? The Chief seems to be suggesting he could?\nMR. FISHER: I don't think so.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: It seems to me we have\nthis problem, the president of the company is the same\nas the vice president.\nMR. FISHER: I think that's the point that I\nwas trying to make.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I suppose that would\ngo to how consistently and how effectively the policy is\nenforced. If the president of the company isn't\nfollowing the policy it's not going to be taken very\nseriously. That's different than saying you have a\nsituation where on an episodic and sporadic basis a firm\ncompany policy is breached, the individual is breaching\nthe policy.\nMR. FISHER: Well, if we're to the point\nwhere the question is whether or not the policy was\nenforced, we'll very happily rest on the record in this\ncase, because that was what we tried to the jury: That\nthere was no serious alcohol policy that was enforced.\nWe showed 33 instances in the record of\nExxon employees drinking with Hazelwood or learning that\nhe drank. Up and down the corporation, as the district\njudge explained, for three years, upper management was\nreceiving reports that this man was drinking aboard the\nvessel.\nNow, its policy, Mr. Chief Justice, was that\nthat was not allowed. But over a three-year span, as\nthe district judge found again and again and again, they\nwere told there was a problem.\nJUSTICE BREYER: That wouldn't -- you might\nwin on that one. I mean if you show that. They have --\nwe have to assume that that isn't so, don't we --\nMR. FISHER: I think you assume --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- for purposes of this\nargument?\nMR. FISHER: Well, two -- two points,\nJustice Breyer:\nOn answering the first question presented --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes. Okay, that's all.\nMR. FISHER: -- you assume --\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's fine.\nMR. FISHER: -- unless we can show -- unless\nwe can make an overwhelming harmless errors --\nJUSTICE BREYER: On the second and third,\nthis is what --\nMR. FISHER: The second and third, I think\nyou assume the facts --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- some time available. I\nwould like you to address at some point at your\nconvenience what should the standards be if, in fact,\nthe captain of a ship, or responsible for conditions,\nfor example, negligence or recklessness is now going to\nbe not only imputed to the corporation but subject for\npunitives.\nNow, what I'm interested in, in the back of\nmy mind is: This is a very dramatic accident. It\ninvolves oil spills, and they cause a enormous amount of\ntrouble. But there are accidents every day, and ships\nare filled with accidents like automobiles in other\nplaces. And there are all kinds of things that go\nwrong.\nAnd if, in fact, it has not been normal in\nadmiralty until now to assess punitives against the\ncorporation on the basis of the activity of, say, the\nship's master, failures of responsibility, then it will\nbe a new world for the shipping industry and for those\nwho work on the ships.\nWhat happens when a sailor slips and is\nhurt, and it's very serious to that sailor, et cetera?\nWhat principles do you have to suggest, if any, for\ncreating a fair system that isn't just arbitrary?\nMR. FISHER: Well, I think this is the\nperfect segue from the first and third questions. As I\ntransfer there, I want to point out that I think the\nonly reason that we heard in the first -- the first\nportion of the argument for absolving Exxon of\nresponsibility in the situation is because of the\ndangerousness of captaining vessels like this.\nThis Court has already addressed that\nconcern in its collision doctrine, and tort law\ngenerally addresses the problem of dangerous activities\nand split-second decisions. And the answer to that is\nthey are simply not reckless when somebody makes a\ngood-faith decision in a crisis in the midst of\ndangerous activity. So we don't think there's any\nspecial rule that is necessary with respect to the first\nquestion presented.\nNow, you asked me how do deal with it in\nterms of the size of the award. We think -- first of\nall, I think that if I can beg to differ slightly with\nthe way you framed it, as Professor Robertson explained,\npunitive damages are -- have always been firmly\nestablished in maritime law.\nAnd then just because there haven't been\nthat many cases doesn't tell you that they've been\nfrowned upon. It just means that we haven't had that\nmany cases that have resulted in reported decisions.\nNow, in looking to guidance, this Court\nisn't sitting as a maritime court. So it -- it's siting\nas a common-law-type court. We think the best place to\nstart is with the common-law tradition, which is that\ncases are tried to juries; juries make the first\ndecision; and then the trial court reviews for passion\nand prejudice and for substantial evidence, as our trial\ncourt did here. And then the court of appeals reviews\nthat for abuse of discretion.\nIf there's anything more that's necessary in\nmaritime law, we submit Congress has already stepped\ninto the breach with the Limitation of Liability Act.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Correct me if I'm wrong.\nYou've read the case -- our case in Cooper, which says\nthat the appellate court has to examine de novo to\ndetermine the adequacy or the excessiveness of the award\nto deter.\nMR. FISHER: I think that's a constitutional\nholding. What this Court said in Cooper was if --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, then, a fortiori, it\ngives us the right and the duty to do so as -- sitting\nas a common-law-type court.\nMR. FISHER: Yes. I'm not going to fight\nyou on that, Justice Kennedy. There was an earlier\nsentence in Cooper that says if no constitutional issue\nis raised, the only thing an appellate court should do\nis review for abuse of discretion. But I think that\nultimately you end up in the same place, which is that\nthere's a de novo review of the excessive -- of whether\nthe award is excessive based on the facts that have been\n-- that have been tried.\nAnd if this Court is going to adopt a set of\nguideposts for maritime law, we think the proper place\nto look is the due- process cases this Court has already\ndecided.\nThis Court has already -- in its due-process\ncases, the Court looked to the common law. That's\nwhere, I gather, the guideposts this Court adopted came\nfrom: Reprehensibility, in particular, which this Court\nsaid was the most important indicia, as well as a\nreasonable relationship, what's commonly referred to as\nthe \"ratio test.\"\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What about -- what about\nlooking to the Clean Water Act? And I wanted to ask you\nthis question about the Act. Assuming we agree with you\nthat -- that it was too late to raise the Clean Water\nAct as a separate pre-emptive factor in the case, why\nwas it too late in the appellate court to raise the\nClean Water Act as an additional reason why maritime law\nshould not be interpreted to allow punitive damages and,\nin part 3 of the case, as a factor, why punitive damages\nof the amount at issue here should not be allowed?\nIt seems to me there it's not a new\nargument. It's just an additional factor for arguments\nthat have already been made.\nMR. FISHER: I think I accept what you said,\nJustice Scalia. The third -- with respect to the size\nof the award, we never contested Exxon's ability to\nargue that the Clean Water Act is one place you can\nlook.\nSo, if you were to look to the Clean Water\nAct, you initially have the problem that Justice Souter\nmentioned. You have the apples and oranges problem.\nThe Clean Water Act sets a fine cording to the\nenvironmental harm. Now, the State of Alaska had that\nestimated in its -- and this is in its brief -- and that\ncame out to be -- I believe the number is about\n$2.6 billion.\nSo, if you were to look -- if you were to\nput aside the apples and oranges problem and look to the\nClean Water Act, then you get almost the number that\nwe're standing here with today.\nIf you look at the harm a different way, you\nstill get an extremely large number. You get $500\nmillion of compensation to the Plaintiffs. And then on\ntop of that, we think in light of the way this Court has\naddressed ratio analysis in its other cases, you need to\ntake account of the fact that there are vast injuries\nthat have not resulted in any compensation.\nSo to do any kind of --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes. That's part 3. What\nabout part 2? Why -- why can't the Petitioner raise the\nargument or why could not the Petitioner raise it in the\ncourt of appeals? Okay, we agree that the Clean Water\nAct does not pre-empt the granting of punitive damages\nhere, but one of the factors that we ought to take into\naccount in deciding whether modern admiralty law in this\nsituation permits punitive damages is the existence of\nthe Clean Water Act. That's not a pre-emption thing.\nIs that also waived, do you think?\nMR. FISHER: Well, I think it would be\nbecause that's -- they never made that argument in the\ndistrict court, and they didn't make that argument to\nthe --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: They don't have to make\nevery tiny little argument. I mean, you can think of\nadditional points on appeal so long as it's under the\nsame major heading. And the major heading here is not\nthe Clean Water Act pre-empts punitive damages; the\nmajor heading is, rather, modern admiralty law does not\npermit. And, you know, they had made other arguments\nabout prior cases; they had talked about State law; and\nthis is just another argument: By the way, here's\nanother one. There's the Clean Water Act.\nMR. FISHER: Well, they didn't make that\nargument, but if they had, I don't think it ends up\nbeing any different than their pre-emption argument\nbecause -- remember their pre-emption argument isn't a\npure pre-emption argument. They're not here today\nsaying the Plaintiffs can't recover compensatory\ndamages, as was the case in the Milwaukee and Illinois\ncase, for example. What they're saying is that the\nClean Water Act displaces our ability to recover\npunitive damages.\nAnd there, by making the argument that I\ngather you've sketched out, it looks very much like the\nsame argument that they didn't properly make.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's close.\nMR. FISHER: But it doesn't --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But it doesn't really say\npre-emption, and so it's -- it's just another factor to\nconsider when you decide what the evolving law of\nadmiralty requires.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: There was a statute that\nwas raised in the district court. And the district\ncourt raised this TAPA Act, and they thought that that\nwas the statutory guide, and that was the reason why\nthere should not be punitive damages, but -- so that was\none of the things the court of appeals said under the\nhead of waiver. They're substituting one federal\nstatute for another.\nMR. FISHER: That's right, Justice Ginsburg.\nAnd at page 103 of the joint appendix, the district\ncourt ruled on that motion and held that TAPAA was the\nstatute that was controlling with respect to spills of\ntrans-Alaska oil and that the savings clause of TAPAA\nexpressly preserved our ability to seek punitive\ndamages.\nThat's a ruling that, as you noted, Exxon\nnever appealed, and so it is the law of the case.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: A while ago you were\nabout to make a point on the Limitation of Liability\nAct.\nMR. FISHER: Yes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: A little while ago,\nyou were about to make a point on the Limitation of\nLiability Act.\nMR. FISHER: Yes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But I was -- I would\nhave thought that cuts heavily against you on the third\npoint. In other words, if we're looking to guidance,\nyou look to Federal law. And whether it's directly\napplicable or not, the Limitation of Liability Act\nreflects a very strong Federal policy about restricting\nliability on shipowners, adopted at a time when it was\nintended to encourage maritime -- the maritime economy.\nAnd why isn't that something we should look to, at least\nunder question three?\nMR. FISHER: Well, as I said, I agree you\nshould look to it, but you should do it in a way this\nCourt's Miles decision instructs. It says that Congress\ndoesn't just enact general policies. By enacting a\nstatute that gives some protection, Congress indicates\nnot just a general policy, but more importantly, the\nsphere into which that policy is to be given effect.\nAnd so the notion that Congress did step in\nand give shipowners some protection but left out\nshipowners like Exxon that behave in the manner at issue\nin this case, we think is a strong --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that means\nthey don't get the really quite extraordinary protection\nthat the limitation of liability gives. It doesn't mean\nthat we should ignore the reflection of that policy\noutside the confines of the Limitation of Liability Act.\nMR. FISHER: Well, I think -- I think you\nshould look to it and understand that Congress has\ndeclined to give the protection. In OPA 90, which was\npassed right after the spill in direct response to the\nspill, Congress made explicit that the Limitation Act\nshould never apply to spills of Trans-Alaska oil. And\nthe TAPAA did the same thing in the --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The argument is not\nthat the Limitation of Liability Act should apply. It's\nthat it would be very strange to say, where Congress has\nradically reduced the exposure of shipowners in one\narea, that we as a matter of development of Federal\ncommon law, Federal maritime law should allow\ndramatically expanded punitive liability in another area\nof shipowning liability.\nMR. FISHER: Well, we don't think we're\nasking for any kind of expansion of liability. All\nwe're asking is for the traditional admiralty rule which\nhas been recognized by Justice Story early on and all\nthrough the cases that in cases of reckless indifference\na shipowner can be held liable for punitive damages.\nThe only thing --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Fisher, the problem I\nhave -- maybe it isn't a problem I have, but a question\nthat that argument raises is this:\nWe know something now that Justice Story did\nnot know, and that is we've had an awful lot more\nexperience with punitive damages practice. And we've\nspent the last decade or so of this Court dealing with\nthe problem of how to set constitutional limits for\nawards which sort of by most people's standards verged\non the excessive.\nThe problem that we've had -- we've had two\nproblems in coming up with those constitutional\nstandards:\nOne is we can't simply substitute ourselves\nas lawmakers for the State. We're talking about\nconstitutional limits, not optimum standards.\nAnd number two, given those limits on us, we\nhave not been able to come up with anything that could\nbe called determinant standards. We've never, for\nexample, found a sufficient reason constitutionally to\nput an absolute ratio kind of limit on it.\nBut here, as you were pointing out earlier,\nwe're sitting as a kind of common-law court. We are in\nthe position of the States here.\nWhy shouldn't we recognize the difficulty of\ntrying to deal with indeterminate limits which we've\nproven in the constitutional context and say, therefore,\nwe've simply got to come up with a number, because no\nother way is going to give us any kind of an\nadministrable standard; and our number -- and I'm not\nsaying this should be it -- but our number is going to\nbe double the compensatory damages? That's the limit.\nWould that be an illegitimate thing for us\nto do or an unwise thing for us to do?\nMR. FISHER: Well, I think it would -- I'll\nstick with unwise, Justice Souter.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. FISHER: And I think the reason why is\nbecause we agree with that. You should -- you should\nlook to the experience of the States. Not one single\nState, as a matter of common law authority, has set a\nbright-line ratio. The only place --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But the -- the United\nStates Code, the general criminal code, 18 U.S.C. 3571,\nhas exactly that number. It's -- for -- it's double the\npecuniary loss for a criminal act.\nAnd it seems to me, if when we're looking\nfor guidance, as Justice Souter quite properly indicated\nwe must, and Justice Scalia has indicated with reference\nto the Water Act, that this is -- gives us a very\nvaluable instruction.\nMR. FISHER: We think that's one place this\nCourt can look. But again, a common-law court, we\nbelieve, sets standards, not a bright-line rule. If you\nwere to adopt some sort of bright-line statute, you'd\nhave to deal with any number of legislative problems\nthat the several States have dealt with and Congress,\nwhen it has passed these kinds of limits.\nFirst, you have to decide the ratio number.\nYou have to pull something out there. Then you have to\ndecide is it on a per capita basis in terms of -- what\nseveral States have done is they've set a limit, that a\nratio only kicks in at a certain dollar amount. In this\ncase, it's worth remembering that the plaintiffs are\nonly standing to recover $75,000 a piece in punitive\ndamages.\nNow, most States that even have caps, or\nseveral of the States at least, say they don't apply if\nthe awards are under a $100,000 per capita.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Why? What's even the\ntheory of that? Because the theory of punitives is that\nthe individual who's receiving the money wasn't hurt one\npenny's worth?\nMR. FISHER: But the theory --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And that really the money\nought to go to the people generally in the State or it\nought to go to other people, rather than those people\nwho have already been compensated. That's the theory of\nit.\nMR. FISHER: I think that's --\nJUSTICE BREYER: That exhibits the\ndifficulty for me of trying to figure out how to do it.\nMR. FISHER: I think the theory of the\nStates, Justice Breyer, is that if you hurt lots and\nlots of people, it's a worse act than if you only hurt\none or two. And so if you have, as in this case,\ndestroyed an entire regional economy, that it would be\ninappropriate to give some sort of credit for that by a\nlower ratio just because you've harmed more people.\nNow, there's also --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But isn't the measure what\nis necessary to deter? Isn't that what we've asked\nfirst and foremost, not exclusively perhaps?\nMR. FISHER: Well, I think you've looked at\npunishment and deterrence, Justice Kennedy.\nAnd if I could finish the last thing I want\nto say about looking at a ratio, several States that\neven have ratios carve out drunk driving cases and cases\ninvolving intoxication from any other otherwise\napplicable limits. And that's -- I think one reason\nwhy, Justice Kennedy, is deterrence. And so, I think\nlet's start with deterrence, but I want to frame that\ndiscussion by recognizing that in Cooper this Court said\nthat deterrence is not the only goal; you also look to\npunishment.\nNow, I think Exxon's primary argument on\ndeterrence grounds is that we've paid $3.4 billion out\nof our pocket already as a result of this spill, and\nthat's a lot of money. The reality is, once they get\ntheir tax credit and insurance benefits for that money,\nthe number is really under 2 billion. But it's still a\nlot of money.\nAnd so I think it's important to look at the\ndistrict court proceedings involving the Clean Water\nAct, involving the criminal prosecution here, and ask\nwhether it makes sense to have Exxon pay additional\nmoney in punitive damages. We think it is.\nThe first thing to understand is that the\nsame district judge that saw the criminal proceedings in\nthis case sat over our trial. He understood what the\ncriminal case was about, and what it was about was the\nenvironment. That was only thing on the table in the\ncriminal case. And so, when we tried to argue --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It was a different\njury. And the jury is the one that set the amount of\npunitive damages.\nMR. FISHER: There was no jury, of course,\nin the criminal case.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right.\nMR. FISHER: But there was a jury in our\ncase. The district judge reviewed that and said, after\nbeing instructed in instruction number 36 in our case --\nand this is something that we tried -- the chairman of\nExxon took the stand in trial and gave the jury a chart\nof all the money that Exxon had paid out of its pocket\nand told the jury: We've been deterred enough, so you\nshouldn't award any punitive damages. And the jury, of\ncourse, rejected that argument that Exxon made.\nAnd the district judge reviewing that\ndecision -- and this is around page 240 to 245 of the\npetition appendix -- the district judge said: I think\nthe jury had ample reason to do so. And remember to the\ntune of $5 billion. And so why did the district judge\nthink that? Well --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: This is the same\njudge who approved the instruction that said Hazelwood's\nnegligence and recklessness is automatically imputed to\nExxon, right?\nMR. FISHER: Yes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So he was operating\nthat under understanding of the law.\nMR. FISHER: Well, not when he was reviewing\nthe size of the award, Mr. Chief Justice.\nIn the criminal case, the statement of facts\nsupporting the guilty plea in the criminal case -- and\nremember, we're only talking about environment in the\ncriminal case -- and in terms of punishment, the only\nmoney for punishment in the criminal case is $25\nmillion. All the rest of the money is, as the district\ncourt said, to clean up Exxon's mess or to put money\ninto the environment.\nNow, for $25 million fine that Exxon paid in\nthe criminal case, the district judge explained -- or\nI'm sorry, the district judge approved the statement\nthat the U.S. attorney submitted, which said the basis\nfor this is that the captain and the third mate were\nnegligent. That was the only thing even there.\nIt wasn't until our trial and our discovery\nthat it was brought out that the complicity of the\norganization ran far deeper. And so at our -- phase\nthree of our trial, which was entirely about Exxon's\nconduct, not any more at all about Captain Hazelwood's\nconduct -- in phase three of our trial we started out\nthe closing argument by saying here's the relevant\nevidence for the jury.\nAnd we played something for the jury called\nTrial Compilation 9. Now, that appears at appears at\npage 1295 of the joint appendix, and we actually\nsubmitted a videotape that we have submitted to the\nClerk's office, and it is sitting in the Clerk's office.\nThere are 50 segments in Trial Compilation\n9, and all 50 deal with Exxon's upper management\nreceiving reports of Hazelwood's conduct and deeming it\na gross error to put him in command and so forth, all\nthere.\nSo it wasn't until the trial in our case\nthat it came out how deep the complicity ran in the\norganization and how reprehensible the conduct was.\nAnd in reviewing the award the district\njudge said: Now, with that level of complicity and\nreprehensibility, I think the jury could have decided\nthat Exxon should be punished for this --\nJUSTICE BREYER: What is the relevance?\nMR. FISHER: -- occurrence.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What's the relevance of the\nleg that we're assuming Exxon, other than the captain,\ndid bad things?\nMR. FISHER: We submit that --\nJUSTICE BREYER: You seem to be now talking\nabout the evidence that they did bad things. But that's\nthe leg that they did --\nMR. FISHER: The district judge said that\nthis is what he deemed a critical factor supporting the\npunitive award.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, doesn't that show,\nthen, that there had to be a finding that they did the\nbad thing?\nMR. FISHER: No. If you accept our argument\nin the first that to get in the door, all we had to show\nwas that a managerial agent was reckless and that\nCaptain Hazelwood, as Exxon conceded, Was a managerial\nagent. When you are reviewing the size of the award --\nand I think we're talking about the third question\npresented, the size of the award -- all the -- all the\nevidentiary questions are resolved in favor of us, and\ncertainly they are resolved in a way that conducting de\nnovo reviews, a lower court understood and told this\nCourt what the record was. And it is all about the\nthree years that they knew Captain Hazelwood was\ndrinking.\nBut I don't want to leave Justice Kennedy's\nquestion about deterrence, because even if this Court\nlooks at the payments Exxon has made from a perspective\nof deterrence, there are two legs in which Exxon has\nclearly not been deterred. The first is that Exxon's\nown executives testified to Congress shortly after the\nspill that the results of the spill were, quote, \"pretty\nmuch as we envisioned.\"\nNow, it was also common knowledge in the\norganization, and this came out at trial, that the idea\nof putting a drunken master in charge of a supertanker\nwas a potential for disaster and incalculably raised the\nchances of a disaster and a catastrophic spill\noccurring. Knowing all this; knowing what could happen;\nknowing that the industry did not have sufficient\ncleanup equipment to contain a big spill; knowing that\ntens of thousands of Alaskans that depended on Exxon\ntaking proactive action, the kind of action that\nCongress had demanded in passing the TAPAA; Exxon\nnonetheless left Captain Hazelwood in command over a\nthree-year span. So it wasn't deterred by knowing what\nwould happen if the tanker ran aground.\nEven if you look at it from the perspective\nof having paid the money out of its pocket, what did it\ndo? It still hadn't been deterred. In the wake of the\nspill, and this is part of Trial Compilation 9, and this\nwas part of the argument to the jury, Exxon fired one\nperson -- Captain Hazelwood. They reassigned the third\nmate. Everybody else up -- further up the chain of\ncommand who allowed this to happen received bonuses and\nraises. They have taken no action inside the company to\nexpress in any meaningful way that they've been deterred\nby what happened in this incident --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Fisher --\nMR. FISHER: -- and the amount of money that\nthey've had to pay.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- your time is running\nout. And this there's one question I'd like you to\naddress, and that is are there other cases against Exxon\nseeking compensation and punitive damages based on this\noil spill that are still awaiting trial or decision? Or\nis this it?\nMR. FISHER: By definition,\nJustice Ginsburg, this is a mandatory punitive class, so\nthis is the one and only time Exxon will face the\nrespect of punitive damages.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So you don't have the\nproblem of litigant A getting these punitive damages and\nthan B, C and D all wanting to --\nMR. FISHER: Right. One of the many ways in\nwhich this case is the mirror image of the due process\ncases that Justice Souter was referring to that caused\nthis Court to have such great concern about the uptick\nin punitive damages, here you have a single case. You\nhave a single digit ratio which is proportionate to the\nharm that was shown in this case.\nYou have -- in contrast to State Farm, in\nthe most recent -- second most recent case this case\nhad -- in State Farm you had two plaintiffs who stood\nbefore this Court having received $500,000 each in\ncompensatory damages for the emotional distress of 18\nmonths of not knowing whether an insurance claim was\ngoing to be paid. What you have today are 32,000\nplaintiffs standing before this Court, each of whom have\nreceived only $15,000 for having their lives and\nlivelihood destroyed and haven't received a dime of\nemotional distress damages.\nIf there are no further questions, I'll\nsubmit.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Fisher.\nMr. Dellinger, you have four and a half\nminutes.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF WALTER DELLINGER\nON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS\nMR. DELLINGER: Let me begin by noting that\nit's -- I do not think the Court will find in the record\nthat Exxon said this was expected and approved the --\nyou can look at that excerpt on the DVD and see for\nyourself what was -- what was meant by that.\nWith respect, it is difficult to decide what\nlevel of employee should implicate a company; but it is\ndivisible I think, as Justice Kennedy suggested. It is\nbased on whether that employee has authority over the\npolicy, and even a ship captain may have authority over\nsome policies; he did not here. At the end of the day\nwhat the Ninth Circuit held was that Exxon was liable --\ncould be liable for 2.5 billion, simply because against\nits policies, Hazelwood left the deck. That's all that\nwe need to be found.\nNow with respect to the -- with respect to\nthe amount of punitive damages here, where you are --\npunitive damages cases generally look to for the need to\ndeter the activity where someone acts out of malice and\nhostility, intending to harm, which is not true here; or\nwhen a corporation acts out of a profit motive and hopes\nperhaps it will be concealed or that it will make enough\nmoney off of it. That is not true here. Exxon gains\nnothing by what went wrong in this case, and paid dearly\nfor it.\nIn the criminal case, the U.S. and Alaska\nagreed that the amount of the penalty was quote,\n\"sufficient to provide punishment and deterrence for the\nconduct in question.\"\nNow if you talk about the -- the amount\nwhere you have that kind of deterrent, for an\nunintentional act that -- of the amount that's already\npaid, I heard no response to what one would say to\nJustice Kennedy's opinion in State Farm as an outer,\nouter limit. In State Farm the Court said where\ncompensatory damages are substantial, then perhaps --\nthis is the constitutional context -- perhaps an amount\nequal to compensatories would be the most.\nWhat was substantial there was 1 million\ndollars. The compensatories here were 400 or 500 times\nthe -- what the Ninth Circuit found -- 504 million\ndollars. Yes?\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Just as a class, if you\ntake them individually, each individual, did Mr. Fisher\nsay 15,000 something?\nMR. DELLINGER: Well, from the stand --\nfirst of all, from the stand point of a company it\ndoesn't matter whether you pay one person 500 million\ndollars or a lot of people 500 million dollars, in terms\nof punishment and deterrence.\nBut also it is the case that -- that with\nregard to the first plaintiff who had been fully\ncompensated, the argument would have been that in light\nof all that happened, there is no need for punishment\nand deterrence even in the first case, and certainly\ncumulatively, when the amount ad reached, say the amount\nof the civil fines of 80 million, one would have said no\nmore punitives, because the purpose of punitive damages\nis a public purpose. It is not to compensate the\nindividual.\nHere we're at 500 times what was considered\nsubstantial in State Farm. I don't see -- and what is\nthat -- that part of State Farm is to be considered a\ndead letter, how one could not see that this is the\ncase. But that -- that amount of compensatories is an\nouter limit, because if you look to what the civil\npenalties would be that responsible officials have\nobtained, it is 80.2 million dollars; and when you look\nto the fact that this is a case where, as Justice Breyer\nnotes, with the First Circuit opinion, outside the\nfishing context there would have been no compensatories\npaid at all, or owing, because it's consequential\ndamages and in most States, the great majority of the\nStates, that is not even a compensable -- a compensable\ninjury. But it is a special rule for -- for fishing.\nSo these are awards -- that would not have\nbeen done in any case. This was a tragic and terrible\nevent, and one for which the company has paid dearly,\nand the -- at the end of the day, the question will be\nwhether this Court without any guidance should assume\nthat there should a punitive damages remedy in areas\nwhere Congress has already acted, and whether, if so,\nthe plaintiffs have made out any case of an additional\nneed for punishment and deterrence beyond what public\nauthorities have agreed to.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel.\n"
