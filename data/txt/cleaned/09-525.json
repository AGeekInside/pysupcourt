First Derivative Traders.\nMr. Perry.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK A. PERRY\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. PERRY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nAffirming the judgment below would authorize\nprivate securities fraud class actions against every\nservice provider that participates in the drafting of a\npublic company's prospectus. It is, therefore, nothing\nless than a frontal assault on this Court's decisions in\nCentral Bank and Stoneridge.\nIn those cases, Your Honors, this Court held\nthat service providers may not be sued primarily in\nprivate class actions and left that matter for Congress\nto resolve. And Congress did respond, not once, not\ntwice, but three times, to those decisions.\nFirst, in the PSLRA, the Congress authorized\na Federal action, a government action, only against\naiders and abettors, leaving the question of private\nclass actions for this Court's resolution.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, is -- who's the\nviolator alleged here? Not in the complaint, but in the\nbriefs? As I read the briefs, they claim that Janus\nitself did not make the false statement, that the two\nappellants did, that they are the actual speakers\nbecause they were talking about their activities, and\nthey used Janus as a conduit to deceive the market.\nThat's, I think, what they're alleging.\nMR. PERRY: Justice Sotomayor, the\nchallenged statements appear in the prospectuses for the\nJanus Funds, separate legal entities not parties to this\nlawsuit.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So how do we sustain the\nintermediary cases when the company, through market\nanalysts, divulges misleading statements? We don't talk\nabout the market analysts' falsity; we talk about the\ncompany's falsity, because the market analysts didn't\nhave scienter.\nMR. PERRY: Your Honor, the company -\nexcuse me -- the conduit or analyst cases fall under two\ncategories, neither of which is met here.\nFirst, they are a scheme between the\ncompany -- orchestrated by the company to distribute its\ninformation through the analysts to the market, and they\nare brought under 10b-5(a) as scheme cases. That is\nmost of the analyst cases. There is no 10b-5(a) claim\nin this case. This is only a 10b-5(b) \"making\" claim.\nSecond, those few cases, the analyst cases,\nthat are brought under (b) involve an omission; that is,\nthe company has failed to correct a statement made by an\nanalyst where there is a duty to do so. There is no\nomission claim in this case because there is no duty -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But what's the\ndifference between an omission or a commission if a\ncompany purposely divulges a falsehood to an analyst,\nknowing it's going to be distributed in toto? So who's\nmaking the false statement, the analyst or the company?\nMR. PERRY: Your Honor, the company makes\nthe statement to the market. Under Basic, the analyst\nis the market. It is the ears of the market that takes\ninformation -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So why isn't -- why\naren't the two appellants, on their theory, on -- we can\ntalk about whether the complaint does or does not\nadequately allege their theory. That's a different\nissue. I accept that.\nBut under their theory, why isn't the\nappellants the primary violator, not even a secondary?\nBecause they -- they claim, I think -- and I'm going to\nfind out from them -- that Janus had no scienter, that\nit didn't make the false statements, that all of this\nwas done in secret by the appellants, so they were the\nonly violator.\nMR. PERRY: Your Honor, the analyst cases,\nthe issuer speaks to the market directly. Here, there\nis an intervening legal entity, the Janus Funds.\nScienter or no scienter, that is a separate\ncorporation -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Do you mean to say to me\nthat puppets become a legal defense for someone who\nintentionally manipulates the market information?\nMR. PERRY: Justice Sotomayor, the Congress\nhas drafted two statutes that deal with puppets.\nSection 20(b), which these plaintiffs have not invoked,\nmakes it unlawful for one party to do indirectly what it\nwould not be permitted to do directly. That's the\npuppet statute, the ventriloquist dummy statute.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's the control\nperson statute?\nMR. PERRY: No. There's also 20(a), which\nis the control person statute, also not invoked by these\nplaintiffs.\nThose are forms of secondary liability, Your\nHonor. In fact, the Court's questions go to the\ndistinction between primary and secondary liability.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But I -- but if Janus\nhad no scienter, if its board of directors did not know\nthat the statements were false, they had no way of\nknowing, because as I understand the complaint -- and\nthis is alleged -- the deal was secret. So Janus itself\ncould not be a primary violator. Who is?\nMR. PERRY: Justice Sotomayor, our position\nis nobody had scienter, and every adjudicator to look at\nthese facts -- Judge Motz in the district court, the ALJ\nof the SEC -- has found that there was no scienter\nanywhere up and down the line. So the fact that\nsomebody didn't have scienter doesn't answer the problem\nhere. The question -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, somebody deviated\nfrom what was the announced policy, that there was to be\nno market timers investing in this -- in these Janus\nfunds. Somebody made the decision that certain hedge\nfunds would be allowed to engage in that activity. Who\nwas that somebody?\nMR. PERRY: The adviser personnel made the\ndetermination, Justice Ginsburg, that the policy was\ndiscretionary, that when it said we may refuse trades,\nthe funds may refuse trades, that there are -\ndiscretion -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, the statement\nthat's alleged to have been -- the conduct that is\nalleged to have been in opposition to the announced\npolicy, that is attributable squarely to -- what you -\nthis is the entity you called JCM?\nMR. PERRY: That's correct, Your Honor -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So it made the decision\nthat violated the policy?\nMR. PERRY: That's correct, Your Honor. And\nthe SEC -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Nonetheless, it's not a\nprimary actor?\nMR. PERRY: Not as to these plaintiffs, Your\nHonor. The SEC -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But can -- can we discuss\nthe case, and -- and perhaps you don't think so. Can't\nwe discuss this case, must we not discuss this case, on\nthe theory that JCM's scienter, JCM's knowledge of a\nfalse statement, is a given in the case?\nNow, maybe you'll be able to prove\notherwise. You say that they're not liable anyway.\nMR. PERRY: Justice Kennedy, you're exactly\nright. That is the theory pleaded in the complaint.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And it seems to me that's\nwhat the argument here is mostly about.\nMR. PERRY: And the question that is before\nthis Court, we would submit, is whether, scienter or no\nscienter, JCM can be held liable for the statements in\nanother company's prospectus. This Court has never\nheld -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Even though there was no\nscheme with another actor? Even though it was the only\nviolator, which is a -\nMR. PERRY: No -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- fair reading of the\ncomplaint.\nMR. PERRY: They chose not to bring a scheme\ncase. And remember, there is a second set of investors\nhere: the fund investors. The SEC brought an action,\nsecured $100 million on behalf of them. There was a\nseries of private litigation that has been resolved,\nbrought by those investors.\nThese investors did not purchase the\nsecurities offered by the -- the prospectus they\nchallenge. And, again, there's a fundamental disconnect\nbetween the defendant in the case and the challenged\nmisstatements.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But, once again -- once\nagain, if the complainants in the case, the plaintiffs\nin the case -- hypothetical case, not this case,\nhypothetical case -- were injured shareholders in the\nfund, I take it you say still they could not sue JCM?\nMR. PERRY: Your Honor, for different\nreasons. They can sue JCM for -- for an omission,\nbecause there's a duty that runs from JCM to the funds.\nThat was the theory advanced in that separate lawsuit\naccepted by the district court, which has since been\nresolved.\nThey can't -- these plaintiffs can't bring\nan omission case, because there's no duty that runs from\nJCM out to the JCG shareholders. The district court\nheld that. They didn't appeal that to the Fourth\nCircuit. They didn't present that in their cert\npetition. So they can't bring that omissions case.\nAny wrongdoing in this case -- Justice\nGinsburg, to finish my answer to your question, the\npolicy says funds are not intended for market timing.\nThe adviser allowed 12 traders to trade frequently. The\nonly wrongdoing, if there is any wrongdoing, was the\nfailure of the adviser to disclose to the trustees the\ndeviation from the policy. That is a State law breach\nof contract. It may be a breach of fiduciary duty.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Well, Mr. Perry, who wrote\nthe relevant statements?\nMR. PERRY: Your Honor, the funds made the\nstatements to the public. They were drafted -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: I understand that they were\nin the fund's prospectus, but who wrote them?\nMR. PERRY: They were drafted by lawyers for\nthe funds, lawyers representing the funds.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Who paid those lawyers?\nMR. PERRY: The adviser paid the lawyers'\nsalaries.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: So JCM paid the lawyers?\nMR. PERRY: Correct, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: And so it was JCM's lawyers\nwho wrote the prospectus, including the relevant\nstatements here, the asserted misrepresentations?\nMR. PERRY: I -- I disagree with that,\nJustice Kagan. They don't allege that in the complaint,\nand the facts show that the lawyers, when -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Well, suppose the complaint\nhad alleged that. Suppose the complaint had simply\nsaid: JCM's lawyers authored the relevant statements in\nthe prospectus.\nMR. PERRY: One would have to -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Would that be enough to\nsurvive a motion to dismiss?\nMR. PERRY: No, Your Honor. One would have\nto further look at who those lawyers were representing.\nThe truth in the real world is -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: They're paid by JCM.\nMR. PERRY: Every prospectus is written by\nlawyers, Justice Kagan. Lawyers write prospectuses.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: These are in-house counsel\nfor the investment adviser.\nMR. PERRY: In-house counsel, outside\ncounsel, once they draft materials and present them to\ntheir client, it becomes the client's statement when\nadopted by the client.\nThe board of trustees of the funds has to\nreview every policy, is responsible for every policy\ndrafted by inside counsel, outside counsel, consultants.\nIt's not unusual for companies to retain outside service\nproviders to provide any number of policies: Employment\npolicies, investment policies, everything else.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Perry, you -- you\nsaid that it was the fund's lawyers who drafted the\nprospectus, but, in fact, it was JCM's lawyers, the\nlawyers -- they were in-house lawyers for JCM. And they\nserved -- and they served the funds in doing this\nprospectus, but they were on the payroll of JCM, and\nthey were JCM's legal department.\nMR. PERRY: Your Honor, like all lawyers,\nthey wear multiple hats. I represent multiple clients.\nThese lawyers represent multiple clients.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought they were\nin-house lawyers?\nMR. PERRY: They are in-house lawyers at\nJCM, but they also represent the funds, and the SEC has\nspecifically recognized in the context of investment\ncompanies that where an adviser counsel is representing\nthe funds, his client or her client, for those purposes,\nis the funds. And here, these lawyers are very careful\nto separate who their -- their clients are for various\npurposes.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, let's say that JCM's\nprincipal officers and managers wrote the statement.\nYou still say there's no liability?\nMR. PERRY: Absolutely, Justice Kennedy,\nbecause when the statement is adopted by the issuer, it\nbecomes the issuer's statement. Only an issuer can make\nthe statement -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes. It's not\nattributable, at least publicly, to JCM.\nMR. PERRY: That's -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Is there an alternate\ntheory that JCM is really the day-to-day managers in\nday-to-day active control of the fund, and, therefore,\nit should be chargeable as if it and the fund are the\nsame for purposes of making the statement?\nMR. PERRY: Your Honor -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And we would say that\nthat's different from, say, an outside law firm or an\nauditor?\nMR. PERRY: Your Honor, the word \"control\"\nappears more than a hundred times in the briefs on the\nplaintiff's side of this case in this Court, and the\nCongress has dealt with control. Section 20(a) provides\na separate cause of action against those who control\nanother entity.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Except that I, as I read\nyour brief -- and you can correct me if I'm wrong -- you\nwere arguing that because there was an independent board\nof directors, presumably because there are two\ncorporate -- different corporate funds -- two different\ncorporate forms, that there couldn't be control person\nliability under 20(a). You seem -- that -- I thought,\nreading your brief, that's what you were alleging.\nSo you can't have your cake and eat it, too.\nEither the independence of the board makes no difference\nor it does. So which is your position?\nMR. PERRY: Our position, Your Honor, is\nthat the Congress has dealt with the situation where you\nhave two separate companies, and to make a claim against\nthe second company, you have to prove control. Whether\nor not they could in this case, none of us knows,\nbecause they never brought that claim. They\nrepresented to the district court -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Under what theory would\nyou defend an allegation that the investment manager who\nhad control over the everyday affairs of the company,\ndrafted or helped draft the prospectus, hired the\nlawyers who helped draft it, wouldn't be a control\nperson? How would you defend that?\nMR. PERRY: Your Honor, the investment\ncompany, the mutual funds, are separately owned,\nseparately governed.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Exactly. So you -\nyou're -- if they can't be control persons because\nthey're separate companies, then how do they escape\nbeing primary violators?\nMR. PERRY: Well, Your Honor, then -- then\nwe're just saying that the investment adviser is a\nservice provider like every other service provider.\nThey are like the -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But it's not in this\ncase, because the allegation is that it -- not the\ncompany, that it chose to deceive the market.\nMR. PERRY: Your Honor, with respect, the\nallegation is that the adviser wrote a certain policy,\nbut the very document cited for that in the complaint\nsays that the trustees are responsible for the policies\nof the funds. The trustees, when they adopt them, it\nbecomes the corporate policies of them. I mean, on the\nplaintiff's -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Perry, does the fund\nhave employees?\nMR. PERRY: Yes, Your Honor. The fund\nhas -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Who are the fund's\nemployees?\nMR. PERRY: Are the officers of the fund,\nthe chief executive officer, the chief financial\nofficer -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: And are all of those people\nalso employees of JCM?\nMR. PERRY: Not the president, Your Honor,\nbut the others are joint -- serve in joint capacities.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: And could you just run\nthrough a little bit how one of these prospectuses\ngets -- gets issued eventually? The JCM lawyers start\nthe process by drafting, and then what happens?\nMR. PERRY: The lawyers representing the\ntrusts, both in-house and external, draft the underlying\ndocument -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Well, here, I believe that\nthere was a statement in your interrogatories that it's\nJCM's lawyers, in-house lawyers, who drafted the\nrelevant statement.\nMR. PERRY: The particular prospectus,\nanswered in that prospectus. That's exactly right.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: And then what happens?\nMR. PERRY: They are presented to the board\nof trustees, which holds a meeting. The board of\ntrustees is -- the funds are represented by outside\ncounsel, and the independent trustees are represented by\noutside counsel.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: And was there any change to\nthese statements made by the board of trustees?\nMR. PERRY: These particular statements?\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Yes.\nMR. PERRY: Yes, Your Honor. There were\nchanges to the market timing policy throughout the class\nperiod. In fact, earlier in the class period, there was\nan express disclosure that market timing might be\npermitted pursuant to a -- a written contract. That was\nrevised later.\nThe trustees asked multiple questions. They\nwere back and forth with their lawyers. Outside counsel\nwas always involved, and there are other consultants\ninvolved periodically as well. The -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do the outside\ncounsel you're talking about represent the fund only?\nMR. PERRY: There's two separate sets of\noutside counsel. One law firm represents only the fund.\nIt does not represent the adviser; only represents the\nfunds, Your Honor. There's a second law firm in this\ncase that represents the independent trustees.\nSix of the seven trustees determined that to\nsecure their independence, because the chairman of the\nboard at that time was an interested person under the\nstatute, they have a separate law firm. There are two\nlaw firms that have nothing to do with the adviser.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But the law firm that -\nthe lawyers who drafted the prospectus were in-house\ncounsel for JCM on JCM's payroll.\nMR. PERRY: They were paid by JCM, and at\nthe time they drafted, they were representing the funds,\nagain, as allowed by the SEC, as disclosed in the\ndocuments -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But they weren't the\nindependent outside lawyers who were representing the\nboard or the funds; they were the in-house counsel?\nMR. PERRY: Those outside counsel reviewed\nevery policy. In fact, if you look at the -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I guess my question was\nsimply: The drafters of the prospectus were the\nin-house counsel for JCM?\nMR. PERRY: The -- the paragraph being\nchallenged in this case, that's correct, Your Honor.\nThe interrogatory response doesn't speak more broadly\nthan that, but I agree with that.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I suppose if the\nlawyers for the trust did an inadequate job of reviewing\nthe JCM drafts, they would be subject to a malpractice\naction by the trust?\nMR. PERRY: Correct, Your Honor. And then\nthe trust, of course, has contractual and other rights\nagainst the adviser that it has enforced, you know, in\nthis very case. The trustees made a claim against the\nadviser for all of this underlying conduct.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What -- what happens if the\npresident of the oil company, knowing that the statement\nis false, says: We have discovered 42 trillion barrels\nof oil in Yucatan. He writes it on a piece of paper; he\ngives it to the board of trustees; they think it's true\nand they issue it. Joe Smith buys stock and later loses\nmoney.\nCan Joe Smith sue the president of Yucatan,\nof the oil company, for having made an untrue statement\nof material fact?\nMR. PERRY: If he's an authorized agent of\nthe same company that issued the statement?\nJUSTICE BREYER: What he is, is he didn't\nissue it. What he did was he gave it to the board of\ntrustees, who issued it.\nMR. PERRY: If the board of trustees of his\ncompany, so that the statement -\nJUSTICE BREYER: He's the president of the\ncompany.\nMR. PERRY: And -- and the distinction here,\nJustice Breyer, is -\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, no. I'm asking what\nhappens. Is there recovery?\nMR. PERRY: If he is an authorized agent, he\nmay be sued as -\nJUSTICE BREYER: He is running the business,\nthe daily affairs, of the company. Of course, the\npresident of a company is an authorized agent of the\ncompany, and so, yes.\nMR. PERRY: He may be subject to liability,\nthen -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Now, if he's subject to\nliability, why isn't your firm -- your client, subject\nto liability, who, after all, run every affair of the\nfund?\nMR. PERRY: Your Honor, they run the\nmanagement of the fund. The investment operations -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes, that's what a\npresident does. The president of a company manages the\ncompany.\nMR. PERRY: And where -\nJUSTICE BREYER: And if the president is\nliable, why isn't the group of people who do everything\nfor the company -\nMR. PERRY: Because, Your Honor -\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- why aren't they liable?\nMR. PERRY: -- the corporate form has\nmeaning in the Federal law and in State law, and\nwhere -\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, you have to explain it\nto me more. I'm not being difficult. I understand this\nless well than you think I do -\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- and I want to know.\nThat's an obvious, naive question, and I'd like an\nanswer that anyone could understand.\nMR. PERRY: The answer is, Your Honor:\nThese funds are managed -- \"governed,\" excuse me, is a\nbetter word -- by the trustees. That is disclosed in\nthese documents. In fact, the documents say -- it's at\npage 258a of the Joint Appendix -- the trustees are\nresponsible for all the policies.\nThey have outsourced, if you will, certain\nfunctions, operational functions: Which stock to buy,\nwhich stock to sell, which transfer agent to hire.\nThose are functions that could be kept in house or could\nbe outsourced.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I get it. In other words,\nyou're saying, on the papers here, it's -- it's the\ntrustees that manage everything.\nMR. PERRY: That govern everything.\nJUSTICE BREYER: That govern everything, and\nthese are like helpers?\nMR. PERRY: Well, they're -- they're -\nJUSTICE BREYER: They do a lot as helpers.\nNow, let me suggest to you, if that's one possible\ndistinction, what about this distinction: That the\nmanagers of a fund, even though they are outsourced\npeople brought in, are liable as principals, not aiders\nor abettors, if -- following criminal law here -- if -\nthey are principals if they get the false statement to\nthe public through a conduit, the conduit being an\nentity or person that is unaware of the falsity of the\nstatement.\nThat's LaFave on criminal law. What is -\nwhat about that?\nMR. PERRY: Three answers. First, that's\ndealt with in section 20(b), which is the ventriloquist\ndummy statute that these plaintiffs didn't invoke.\nSecond, the Congress looked at this very\nquestion in 1938 and 1939, when there were proposals to\nmerge the management, the adviser function, with the\nfunds, to make them one unitary entity. And in the\nInvestment Company Act of 1940 and the Investment\nAdvisers Act of 1940, the Congress elected not do that.\nAs this Court has recognized, it chose not\nto require compulsory internalization of the management\nfunction. It allowed this separate entity. And,\ntherefore, when you have separate companies, under State\nlaw -- again, my client is a Delaware limited liability\ncorporation. The funds are Massachusetts business\ntrusts. They have nothing in common. There's no joint\nownership, no joint governance -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You're -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Could you -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You're not suggesting,\nare you, that they did this for purposes of protecting\nyour client from a lawsuit?\nMR. PERRY: Absolutely not, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: When it -- no, they did\nit for a business reason, that having separate entities\nwas economically more useful for the market, correct?\nMR. PERRY: And every fund, or virtually\nevery fund in -- in the United States, is set up this\nway.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right.\nMR. PERRY: And, again -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So -- but that doesn't\nanswer Justice Breyer's question, now.\nMR. PERRY: My third -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Assuming that they\ndidn't do it for that reason, what does it mean?\nMR. PERRY: My -- my third answer is that\nextensive regulatory involvement in the two Acts enacted\nin 1940 specifically to regulate this industry, the\nCongress never made the decision to hold the adviser\nliable for the fund's conduct.\nIn fact, no statute says that, and the SEC\nhas never taken that position. There is no case cited\nin any of the briefs -- they have 234 pages, 138 cases.\nNot one holds an investment adviser liable for\nstatements of the fund's prospectuses. When the -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Just -- just to clarify\nJustice Breyer's hypothetical. In your -- in the\nhypothetical you gave where the president gives an\ninnocent board of directors false information and the\nprospectus goes out, is the company liable because their\nagent -- is the company liable under 10b-5?\nMR. PERRY: The company may be sued under\n10b-5. It has got to meet all the elements -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes.\nMR. PERRY: -- but, yes, if it's an\nauthorized agent making a statement on behalf of the\ncompany. But proving -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So what you're saying is\nthat the -- the agency relation that the president of\nthe company holds is different that than the agency\nrelation that JCM holds?\nMR. PERRY: Absolutely right, Your Honor,\nand that's a distinction -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Why is that?\nMR. PERRY: It's grounded in State law, and\nit differs between one company and two companies. Where\nCongress has looked at issuers, for example -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Is -- is JCM an agent? Are\nyou acknowledging that they're an agent of -- of the\nfund?\nMR. PERRY: You know, for certain purposes,\nJustice Scalia, they are an agent.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What -- what purposes are\nthat? For purposes of -- at issue here?\nMR. PERRY: No, Your Honor, for -- not for\ndrafting a prospectus. For carrying out the investment\nfunction. They are laid out in the contract -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes. Okay.\nMR. PERRY: It's attached as an appendix to\nour brief -- which sets forth the things that JCM is an\nagent for investment operations, not an agent\nspecifically for registering the fund's securities for\nsales, complying with the Federal securities laws,\npreparing and issuing the prospectus. All those things,\nby contract -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So even though they did\nthose things, they acted in excess of their authority?\nMR. PERRY: They did not do those things,\nYour Honor.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But that's the allegation.\nMR. PERRY: No, it's not the allegation.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, suppose it were\nproven that they did do those things. Suppose it were\nproven that they did 100 percent of the prospectus work.\nThe only thing that the fund did was to mail it.\nMR. PERRY: I don't know how to respond to\nthat, Justice Kennedy, since it's so far beyond what\nthey could possibly prove here. What happened here -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, this case -- this\ncase went off on -- in the district court, it was -- was\nit 12(b)(6)?\nMR. PERRY: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Okay. And all that the\nFourth Circuit said is it goes beyond; it has to go\nfurther. And the -- the impression that I got from the\nFourth Circuit's opinion is -- and it could be reduced\nto a very simple statement. They say: JCM was in the\ndriver's seat. It was running the show. And if that\ncan be proved, they thought that they would have a good\ncase under -\nMR. PERRY: And, Your Honor, no court, no\ncase from this Court or any court of appeals has ever\nheld that the driver's seat exception to Central Bank\nexists. And that is an expansion.\nThe second issue in the case, of course,\nwhich is attribution: Even if there's making by JCM,\nnone of these statements were attributed to JCM. The\nprospectus is very clear that -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But that was -- I mean,\nbefore you started out with a statement that sounded\nlike the sky is falling because lawyers would no longer\nbe safe, banks would no longer be safe, but the Fourth\nCircuit was -- was a much narrower view. Its view was\nthis -- JCM was the manager. It was controlling\neverything.\nMR. PERRY: Justice Ginsburg, the Fourth\nCircuit's view was the manager helps the funds. That -\nnobody even defends the Fourth Circuit's ruling. The\nGovernment now comes in with a theory that they admit,\non page 22 of the Government's brief, does apply to\nevery lawyer, every accountant, every -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I thought that the question\non which we granted cert was very clear: whether the\nFourth Circuit erred in concluding that a service\nprovider can be held primarily liable in a private\nsecurities fraud action for, quote, \"helping,\" close\nquote, or, quote, \"participating in,\" close quote,\nanother company's misstatements.\nNow, is -- is that an accurate description\nof the Court's holding? It was not objected to by the\nRespondent here.\nMR. PERRY: Absolutely, Justice Scalia. And\nthat question can only be -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And that's what I thought\nwe granted. We weren't talking about control here.\nThat was not the issue, I thought.\nMR. PERRY: We agree with the Court. The\nquestion presented can only be answered one way: The\ncourt of appeals erred.\nIf I may reserve my remaining time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Frederick.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID C. FREDERICK\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. FREDERICK: Thank you, Mr. Chief\nJustice, and may it please the Court:\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Frederick, is that an\naccurate description of -- of the question before us?\nMR. FREDERICK: I don't think it is, Justice\nScalia.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why didn't you object to it\nin -- in your -- in your opposition?\nMR. FREDERICK: We -- we did object, in the\nsense that we described the complaint's allegations as\nJCM writing and preparing and being responsible for the\nprospectus. And the question of -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't -- but we -- we\ndon't reevaluate facts. We -- we review the holding of\na lower court.\nNow, was this an accurate description of the\nholding of the Fourth Circuit? And if it wasn't, why\ndidn't you say that in your brief in opposition?\nMR. FREDERICK: We did say it in our brief\nin opposition, Justice Scalia, and the Solicitor\nGeneral, when you called for the views of the Solicitor\nGeneral, also said in the invitation brief that this\ncase was not an appropriate vehicle for deciding just\nsimply \"help\" and \"participate,\" because what the Fourth\nCircuit was saying in other parts of its opinion was\nthat JCM was responsible for the prospectuses in all\ntheir various aspects: in writing, preparing, et\ncetera. And so we -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How can -- I'm\nsorry. Please -\nMR. FREDERICK: So we would submit that for\nthe reasons we stated in our opposition and we've stated\nin our red brief, as the case comes to this Court on\nreviewing a motion to dismiss of a complaint's\nwell-pleaded allegations -- and I can go through the\ncomplaint's allegations, if you like, that explain how\nJCM wrote and prepared the prospectus and the policies\nfor the funds and then implemented them falsely -- we\nwould submit this case is not about service providers,\nbut it is about Janus Capital Management being the\nprimary violator. They were the ones who had the motive\nto lie, they had the incentive to lie, and they did lie.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Did they make -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sorry. Who was -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- the statements? Isn't\nthat the statutory text that we're dealing with?\nMR. FREDERICK: Yes, they did.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: They did make the\nstatements?\nMR. FREDERICK: Yes, they composed and\ncreated -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It didn't go out under\ntheir name.\nMR. FREDERICK: It did in -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: If someone writes a speech\nfor me, one can say he drafted the speech, but I make\nthe speech.\nMR. FREDERICK: Justice Scalia, we address\nthe definition of \"make\" under the SEC's interpretation,\nwhich is entitled to deference, as being to create or to\ncompose or to accept as one's own.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That -- that's not what -\nit depends on the context of \"make.\" If you're talking\nabout making heaven and earth, yes, that means to\ncreate, but if you're talking about making a\nrepresentation, that means presenting the representation\nto someone, not -- not drafting it for someone else to\nmake.\nMR. FREDERICK: In the prospectus, there is\na section on management that explains that Janus Capital\nManagement engages in the day-to-day functions. There\nare no employees of Janus Funds themselves. All of this\nis outsourced management -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Except -- except\nwhen they review material going in the prospectus.\nMR. FREDERICK: But that -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Then they have\nindependent representation by outside counsel.\nMR. FREDERICK: Right. What they don't\nhave, Mr. Chief Justice, and where the falsity is here,\nis the ability of any of those outsiders to determine\nwhether or not implementing the policy will be done\nfraudulently, and that's where the culpability is here.\nJCM runs these funds, and although the statement might\nget accepted by the board of trustees -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I don't\nunderstand -- I don't understand your answer. The\noutside counsel reviews what the policy is going to be.\nMR. FREDERICK: Yes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Our question is the\nvalidity of that statement, whether that's deceptive in\nthe prospectus. That seems to me to be an entirely\ndifferent question. I understood your theory of the\ncase to be that JCM is liable, basically, because they\nput it in the prospectus.\nMR. FREDERICK: And what they did was to\nfalsely represent what they would do with that\nstatement. I would direct the Court to paragraph 5.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's the\nquestion, I guess, that -- your response seems to beg\nthe question -- is that they falsely represented. The\nissue is whether or not something happened between their\ndrafting and its appearance in the prospectus that makes\nit appropriate to say that that's a statement of the\ntrust rather than a statement of JCM.\nMR. FREDERICK: It is a statement of both,\nin the sense that the fund is attracting investors, but\nthe fund is managed and controlled by the investment\nmanager; here, JCM. If -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But if JCM falsely\nrepresented what it would do, it made that false\nrepresentation to the fund, and the fund, as has been\nacknowledged, would have a cause of action against JCM.\nMR. FREDERICK: No -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But that's not what's going\non here.\nMR. FREDERICK: No. In fact, paragraph 5 of\nthe complaint says that Janus is representing that its\nmutual funds -- Janus Capital Management, its mutual\nfunds -- were designed to be long-term investments. It\nthen says in paragraph 6: As recognized in the\nprospectuses, JCM purported market timing policy was\ndesigned to protect long-term investors.\nSo, if you read the prospectus and you read\nthe complaint, it is absolutely clear what Janus Capital\nManagement is telling all the mutual fund investors of\nthe world: If you invest in Janus, we will protect your\nlong-term investments.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What isn't clear from all\nof those things is that -- is that JCM made any\nrepresentation to the public. The representation was\nmade in the prospectus issued by the fund, not by JCM.\nNow, the fund may have a cause of action\nagainst JCM, but what's crucial here is whether -\nwhether you can establish that it is JCM who made the\nrepresentation to the public -\nMR. FREDERICK: And we -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- and I don't see how you\ncan get there. You might proceed under the control\nprovision, but -- but not by saying that they made the\nrepresentation.\nMR. FREDERICK: Justice Scalia, they wrote\nthe prospectus. They're in -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's fine. Just like\nwriting a speech for somebody.\nMR. FREDERICK: And when they issued the\nprospectus, they used their address and represented to\nthe public that they -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry to\ninterrupt, but it seems be an important -- when they\nissued the prospectus -\nMR. FREDERICK: Sorry.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Who issued the\nprospectus?\nMR. FREDERICK: JCM filed it and\ndisseminated it on its Web site, and all investors in\nthe Janus Funds knew to -- knew to make inquiries to the\nmanager if they had any question about the funds.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: If I carry a letter over\nand file it on behalf of some principal, does it become\nmy letter? Have I made that representation? Sure, they\nfiled it. What does that prove?\nMR. FREDERICK: Because it's -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: As you say, they have no\nother agents, unless the trustees themselves were going\nto walk over and file it. JCM was functioning in that\ncapacity as an employee of the fund in the filing. They\ndidn't file it on their own behalf.\nMR. FREDERICK: Yes, they did.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: On their own behalf?\nMR. FREDERICK: Absolutely. They created\nthe fund, Justice Scalia. That's how mutual funds work.\nManagers create them, they lure investors to them, they\nget money by having a percentage of assets under\nmanagement.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And the SEC has\nrecognized that they remain two separate entities,\ndespite this interconnected relationship.\nMR. FREDERICK: Certainly, but there are\nmany cases -- in fact, I don't think it's ever been\ndisputed in the courts of appeals that if one company\noutsources its management function and those outsourced\nmanagers make lies on behalf of the company -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The one -- the one\nactivity -\nMR. FREDERICK: -- they are also liable\nunder section 10b-5.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The one activity\nthat we know they did not outsource was review of the\nmaterials submitted by JCM. They had independent\ncounsel that conducted that review.\nWould it have been a breach of the trustees'\nfiduciary obligations to the fund investors under common\nlaw -- I forget where this is incorporated -- to\nrubber-stamp what they get from somebody on the outside,\nnot to have independent counsel review what they're\ngoing to say in their prospectus?\nMR. FREDERICK: Mr. Chief Justice, my answer\nto your question is: That's actually a very difficult\nquestion under fiduciary duty law, because here the\nfiduciaries have been duped themselves.\nThey, when they got the wording of the\nprospectus and the policy that JCM was purporting to\nimplement -- JCM didn't tell the board that there are 12\nsecret deals with hedge funds, pursuant to which we're\ngoing to make money by attracting long-term investors\nand -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, it seems to\nme -\nMR. FREDERICK: -- make money with\nshort-term market timers.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Isn't -- isn't that,\nagain, what has been conceded: That there may well be\nan action from the fund represented by their trustees\nagainst -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Common-law suit for duping.\nMR. FREDERICK: Justice Scalia, in no\ninstance that I'm aware of where a mutual fund\ninvestment adviser is a publicly traded company would\nthat cause of action run on behalf of the manager's\nshareholders. What we're talking about here is a\ncompany with a product, and they lie about the product.\nAnd in that instance, it's no different from the Vioxx\ncase last year with Merck or the difference from the\ncold remedy case you are going to hear argument in next\nterm.\nThe mutual funds happen to be the product of\nthe company. They make misstatements about the product,\nand that -\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, suppose this case\ndidn't involve a mutual fund. Suppose it involved a\ncorporation with thousands of employees, and the\nprospectus is drafted by outside counsel. It's adopted\nby the directors of the company without changing a word.\nNow, would that case come out the same? And\nif not, what would -- what exactly would you have us say\nto distinguish the two?\nMR. FREDERICK: Well, the outside lawyers, I\nthink, are distinguishable in a number of different\nways. One is that they are reacting on information\nprovided by the company. That information is typically\nnot subject to an independent investigation by outside\ncounsel to determine the truth or veracity of that\ninformation.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, what if it's alleged\nthey knew exactly what was going on?\nMR. FREDERICK: If there is scienter, where\nthe lawyers knowingly act in a way that helps or that\ncontributes to that fraud, they may well be subject as\naiders and abettors. It depends on whether you can\nestablish that the lawyers have met all of the elements.\nI mean, you'd have to show reliance. You'd have to show\nlost causation. You'd have to show the primary\nviolation of the part of the lawyers.\nJUSTICE ALITO: They would be liable as\naiders and abettors? I thought there wasn't aiding and\nabetting liability.\nMR. FREDERICK: Sorry. The SEC would be\nable to proceed against the lawyers for aiding and\nabetting. Whether or not there would be a private\naction would depend on whether the lawyers -- it could\nbe pleaded under the heightened pleading requirements\nthat they had met all of the elements of the 10b-5\nclaim. I would submit that's extremely difficult.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What is it that -- I'm\nunclear on this. That's why I use the oil company\nexample. Plain, ordinary -- the top executives in the\noil company write the false statement. They give it to\na board that doesn't know it's false, and the board puts\nit out in its name.\nNow, it seems to me it ought to be clear at\nthis point in securities law whether those -- the\npresident and vice president are or are not liable under\nthis 10-b, the (B) part.\nMR. FREDERICK: Yes, and we cited those\ncases -\nJUSTICE BREYER: And they are liable.\nMR. FREDERICK: -- I believe at page 37.\nJUSTICE BREYER: You're saying they are\nliable?\nMR. FREDERICK: At page -\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. Then their\nresponse to that is: This is not like the president of\nthe oil company, and the reason that it's not is\nsomething to do with the nature of the -- the obligation\nthat runs between the managers and the fund, which is\nsomehow different between -- you understand it better\nthan I.\nCan you say what it is and what you think\nyour response is?\nMR. FREDERICK: Yes. What I will say is\nthat they don't have a principal distinction between\nthose two situations. Simply having a contract to\noutsource management where those management functions of\nthe company are resulting in false statements issued by\nthe company shouldn't make -\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. So you're\nsaying -- you're saying it shouldn't matter that if they\nissued -- it's worse if they run the whole company than\nif they're just the president?\nMR. FREDERICK: That's correct.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. Now, at that\npoint, we get into a problem, and the problem is how do\nwe distinguish an aider or abettor from a principal?\nMR. FREDERICK: An -\nJUSTICE BREYER: At that point, I am\nuncertain indeed, and that's why I put out this for\ncomment, this suggestion that you follow criminal law\nhere and say at least they're a principal if they have a\nhigh position, they participate in it, they do all these\nthings you say, and the entity that they're fooling in\nthe first instance is simply a conduit, and, therefore,\nyou cannot say it's a scheme, because this other part of\nthe scheme wasn't part of it.\nMR. FREDERICK: Well, to be a primary\nviolator, you have to have met all of the elements of\nthe cause of action.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes.\nMR. FREDERICK: To be an aider and abettor\nfor enforcement purposes -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes.\nMR. FREDERICK: -- SEC purposes, you simply\nhave to provide substantial assistance to one who is a\nprimary violator.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What's the difference\nbetween substantial assistance and -- and doing it?\nMR. FREDERICK: You would not have to make\nthe statement. You would do something to assist the\nperson making the statement.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Frederick, I thought we\nhad held -- I was sure we had held that there is no\naiding and abetting liability -\nMR. FREDERICK: Yes. I'm -- I'm not\nsaying -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- under the provision\nwe're discussing here.\nJUSTICE BREYER: There's a distinction. You\nwant to say what the distinction is. So I would -\nconsistent with the view there is no aiding and abetting\nliability, you still would win your case.\nMR. FREDERICK: That's correct, because\nthere is no primary violator under JCM's view of the\nfacts here. They are the primary violator under our\nview of the facts here, because they met all of the\nelements of the 10b-5 action, and they had a motive do\nit, and they made -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Is your claim premised\non Janus being duped or not? If Janus was not duped, if\nits board knew and JCM was doing the activity with\neither the consent or acquiescence of the board, would\nyou have a claim here?\nMR. FREDERICK: We would. It would be\nsomewhat different because we would plead multiple\nviolators, as the Court in Central Bank and in\nStoneridge -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Then go back to Justice\nBreyer's question, because I can see when there's one\nprimary violator who uses another entity as a dupe or as\na puppet, but I can't, and I don't know how to,\ndistinguish what you're proposing from aiding and\nabetting. There has to be something to differentiate\nthe two. So what is it?\nMR. FREDERICK: It's the failure on the part\nof the person who would not have met all of the elements\nof the 10b-5 claim. You have to have someone -- you -\ntwo people, okay? Both of them have to have satisfied\nall the elements of a 10b-5 claim to be primary\nviolators. If there is one element that is not\nsatisfied with respect to that person, that person is\nonly an aider and abettor and not subject to private\nremedies under section 10(b). They would be subject to\naiding and abetting liability under the SEC's\nenforcement -\nJUSTICE ALITO: But the distinction you're\ndrawing is between making the statement and assisting in\nmaking the statement. Isn't that -- isn't that what you\njust said?\nMR. FREDERICK: Well, no, in the sense that\nwe believe, and we assert in the complaint and the\ncomplaint is adequately pleaded, is that JCM made the\nstatements. Now, to be -\nJUSTICE ALITO: Yes, and aiding and abetting\nis assisting in making these statements as if -- as in\nsomething you want to take place, right?\nMR. FREDERICK: Yes.\nJUSTICE ALITO: But what is the difference,\nthe distinction in -- in this context? Now, one\npossible distinction is who formally makes it, in whose\nname is it made, but that's obviously not your -- your\nposition. So, what -- what is it to distinguish a\nprincipal here from an aider and abettor?\nMR. FREDERICK: Who has substantive control\nover the content of the message. That kind of\nsubstantive control, as -- as the Court in the Utah Ten\nCommandments case pointed out, the government can have\nspeech attributed to it on the basis of it putting up a\nmonument on public land. There can be multiple speakers\nwith respect to one message, and the question of how\nmuch substantive control you attribute to a particular\nspeaker, we believe, is the appropriate way to view -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Do you deny that the fund\nhad substantive control? Couldn't the fund have stopped\nthis statement from being placed in its prospectus?\nDidn't it have outside lawyers who advised it whether it\nshould allow this statement to be included in its\nprospectus? How can you say that they -- they didn't\nhave control?\nMR. FREDERICK: Well, they did not have a\nknowledge of the falsity of these statements.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that may mean that\nthey're duped, but it doesn't mean that they don't have\ncontrol. They had control, but you say they -- they\nwere duped. But that's quite a different theory from\nsaying that they had control -\nMR. FREDERICK: They -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- that they didn't have\ncontrol.\nMR. FREDERICK: No, Justice Scalia, they\ndidn't have substantive control over the content of the\nmessage, because if they did, they would not have\nallowed these false statements to have been issued. And\nthat's the whole point -- that's the theory here. JCM\nwas luring long-term investors with the promise if you\npark your money with the Janus Funds, it will be safe\nin -- from the kinds of market timing problems. They\nwere then secretly going out and luring money from the\nhedge funds to allow them to make short trades -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But there was -- there is\nnothing in the record to indicate that that statement\nwas attributed to JCM.\nMR. FREDERICK: The public understood it\nthat way.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: You can -- you can play\nwith the words \"make\" as you choose, but do we take the\ncase on the assumption that you can show that it was\nattributed to JCM? I -- I see nothing in -- in the\nrecord that would justify that.\nMR. FREDERICK: Well, JA 275a, Justice --\nJustice Kennedy -- excuse me -- says that Janus Capital\nManagement reserved the Janus name for itself and that\nit -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What did -- how did it\nreserve that? You said twice in your brief that Janus\nis a name to which JCM reserves the right. How did it\nreserve the right?\nMR. FREDERICK: It said -- and this is at\npage 275a -- if for some reason Janus Capital\nManagement's contract is terminated, the funds can no\nlonger use the Janus name. They were intending to\ntrademark and get the name out there to attract\ninvestors to the investment adviser's method of\ninvesting. And it was that type of usage that brought\nall of this together. The fund and the management, they\nare in function essentially one entity. The fact that\nthey have contractually outsourced the management\nfunction should not alleviate the securities fraud that\nis alleged here.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Frederick, a substantial\npart of the power of your argument comes from this\nnotion, as Justice Ginsburg said, that JCM was in the\ndriver's seat, that JCM had control, that they were --\nJanus was at most an alter ego of JCM and maybe\nsomething more, that it was just a creature of JCM. But\nthe securities legislation seems to deal with that in\nsection 20. And your case is not brought under section\n20 and, because of the relationship between mutual funds\nand their investment advisers, presumably could not be\nbrought under section 20.\nSo, why should we think relevant the kind of\ncontrolled relationship that you're talking about?\nMR. FREDERICK: Because you don't want to\ncreate a road map for other people to commit fraud,\nJustice Kagan, and that's what their theory does. What\ntheir theory does is it says, if we set up shell\ncompanies or if we dupe people to make statements, we\ncan commit securities fraud with impunity, because we\nwon't be held liable to having made the statement, even\nthough we wrote it, we had substantive control over it,\net cetera.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Except -- except to\nthe SEC, right? Because they can pursue it under aiding\nand abetting. It's kind of a big -\nMR. FREDERICK: Well -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- problem if you're\ntrying to say we're safe from actions for security\nfraud.\nMR. FREDERICK: Well, Chief Justice Roberts,\nthis Court on numerous occasions has said that the\nprivate securities action is a complement to the\nenforcement efforts of the SEC, and in this instance,\nthe shareholders of the investment manager -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I know, but\nyou were just responding by saying the problem is that\nthis will give people a road map. But they're going to\nhit a pretty big bump in the road when the SEC brings an\naction against them, including potential criminal\nactions.\nMR. FREDERICK: But, no, the problem,\nMr. Chief Justice, is that under their construction of\nthe facts, there's no primary violator. Mr. Perry said\nthis morning -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The SEC -\nMR. FREDERICK: -- there's no primary\nviolator. And so, if there's no primary violator, there\ncan be no control person and there can be no aiding and\nabetting.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Frederick.\nMr. Gannon.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF CURTIS E. GANNON,\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,\nSUPPORTING RESPONDENT\nMR. GANNON: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, could you start\nby taking your brief and distilling it down to three\nsentences? Define what a primary violator is, what a\nsecondary violator is who aids and abets, and who a\ncontrol person is? And then tell me how that definition\nwould exclude lawyers, auditors, investment -- general\ninvestment advisers, et cetera.\nI've read your brief, but I've been trying\nto distill it down to three sentences. So try to do\nthat for me.\nMR. GANNON: A primary violator must be\nsomebody who has actually committed all the elements of\na 10b-5 cause of action -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Give me an example of\nthat. What do you see as all of the elements?\nMR. GANNON: Well, the elements for the\nprivate cause of action are the ones that this Court has\nrepeated. They're -- were cited on page -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I understand. But -\nMR. GANNON: In -- in this case the key one\nthat we're talking about is that you would need to be an\nactual maker of the statement, and -- and -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And that becomes -- how\nis that different from aiding and abetting the making of\na statement?\nMR. GANNON: It -- we think that somebody\ncan make a statement if they create the statement, and\nthe statute and the rule both expressly apply to those\nwho make statements directly -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But that's every\nlawyer -\nMR. GANNON -- or indirectly.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- who writes the false\nstatement knowing it's false. So, are you saying that\nevery lawyer who writes the statement knowing it's false\nis a primary violator?\nMR. GANNON: Scienter is another element,\nand so a lawyer who just reviews the policy, JCM in this\ncase -- when JCM submitted false statements to the\nfunds, if the funds were unaware, this is where Mr.\nFrederick concluded for the Chief Justice that if\nthere -- if the person who actually releases the\nstatement to the world has been duped and doesn't have\nscienter, then there is -- they are not going to be -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, just to get -\nMR. GANNON: -- a primary violator.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- to get back, so\nyou are conceding that if you lose this case, you will\nbe unable to bring any aiding and abetting case in a\nsituation such as this?\nMR. GANNON: Under sections 20 -- it depends\non what the situation -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It seems like a yes\nor no question.\nMR. GANNON: Yes, if the situation here is\none in which the funds ultimately cannot be proved to\nhave scienter. If they did not know about the falsity\nof the statements in the prospectuses that they released\nto the public, then there would not be a primary\nviolator. Under section 20(e) for aiding and abetting\nliability, the Commission can bring an aiding and\nabetting claim against somebody who provides substantial\nassistance, recklessly or knowingly -- recklessly or\nknowingly provides substantial assistance to a primary\nviolator, but the Court has repeatedly made clear that a\nprimary violator needs to have violated all of the\nelements of a 10b-5 cause of action, which includes -\nJUSTICE ALITO: I'm still not clear what\nyour distinction is between making the statement and\naiding and abetting in the making of the statement.\nNow -\nMR. GANNON: If it -\nJUSTICE ALITO: -- could you explain that?\nMR. GANNON: Well, I think that -\nJUSTICE ALITO: Is it necessary that the\nperson in whose -- the entity in whose name the\nstatement is made is an empty shell? It's simply a\npuppet that's controlled by somebody else? Is that -\nis that necessary or does it go beyond that?\nMR. GANNON: No, I don't think that that's\nnecessary. If -- the position -- the position that the\nCommission has taken is that somebody who makes a\nstatement, if he writes the statement or provides the\nfalse information that's used to construct the statement\nor allows the statement to be attributed to him. And we\nthink that that's a reasonable construction of the term\n\"make,\" because the statute and the rule both apply to\npersons who make the statement directly or indirectly.\nAnd so, they could be using a conduit, whether the\nconduit is witting or unwitting. They would be a\nprimary violator if they had -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't think that's a\nreasonable interpretation of -- of make a statement\nindirectly. I mean, you can make it indirectly by not\nissuing it yourself but having somebody else make it in\nyour name.\nMR. GANNON: Well, if -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But I would not say that\nI'm making a speech indirectly if I have drafted the\nspeech.\nMR. GANNON: Well, but if the -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The person for whom I\ndrafted the speech is making the speech.\nMR. GANNON: Well, that may be true in the\ncase of a speech, Justice Scalia, but in a classic\nboiler-room situation, where somebody has written the\nscripts for salespersons to -- to use in order to make\ncalls to sell stocks, the person who actually writes the\nscripts may never speak the words to a customer, he may\nnever have his own name spoken on the phone, and,\ntherefore, the statements have not been attributed to\nhim -\nJUSTICE BREYER: He may just be some poor\nassociate, his first day at work. The law firm sent him\nover there, and there he got stuck down in the boiler\nroom. And somebody said why don't you write something\nthat will get everybody to sell things, and -- and why\ndon't you say we're a thousand tons of oil instead of\nonly a ton? There he is. He writes it out. You think\nhe's liable?\nMR. GANNON: If he writes it out and he\ndoesn't know, he obviously isn't liable -\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, no, he knows. He\nknows.\nMR. GANNON: -- because he doesn't have\nscienter.\nJUSTICE BREYER: At some level he knows: I\nshouldn't be saying they found a thousand tons of oil\nwhen they only found 50. Okay? And four people told\nhim to go do something like that, but he's the guy who\nwrote it. I'd say he didn't behave well, but I don't\nthink he's the principal.\nMR. GANNON: In that instance, because he\nwas acting specifically at the direction of superiors -\nJUSTICE BREYER: They didn't say what words\nto write.\nMR. GANNON: But they -\nJUSTICE BREYER: They gave him the general\nidea, and then he did it. He created the words, to use\nyour phrase. When you say \"creating the words,\" he's a\ngreat writer.\nMR. GANNON: It -- we do, on page 22,\nacknowledge that somebody needs to be sufficiently\ninvolved in the creation or dissemination of the\nstatement in order to be -- in order to be deemed its\nmaker or its author. And so, it's -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Ah, now we have\n\"sufficiently involved.\" Once we're into sufficiently\ninvolved, we're back into what is sufficient to make the\nperson the principal rather than the aider and the\nabettor, and apparently creating or writing the\nstatement is not clear whether it is or is not\nsufficient. So we're back into the problem.\nMR. GANNON: In this instance, there's no\ndoubt that the manager of the funds was not a mere\nadviser. They bought into -\nJUSTICE BREYER: I'm interested in your\ntest. I'm interested in your test, not the -\nMR. GANNON: Well, the -- the test does\nacknowledge that -- that if there is not sufficient\ncontrol over the content of the -- the message and the\ndissemination of it, that somebody may be more in an\nadvisory capacity. That might be the instance with lots\nof outside law firms when they're acting at the specific\ndirection of counsel. That's not the situation of -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: In that connection, Mr.\nGannon, would you answer the -- the statement that Mr.\nPerry made that the Government had, in fact, conceded\nthat this theory would spread not only to the -- to the\ninvestment adviser so closely linked to funds but to\nevery lawyer, every accountant, every bank.\nMR. GANNON: Well -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: He said that you said\nthat on page something here.\nMR. GANNON: We said that -- he was\nreferring to the statement on page 22 of the\nGovernment's brief, referring to the need for the -- for\nthe author to be sufficiently involved in creating or\ndisseminating the statement. And I think it's very\nimportant to recognize that scienter is an important\nlimiting -- limiting principle for the 10b-5 cause of\naction to be brought by a private -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that will always be\ncharged. It's the simplest thing in the world to charge\nscienter.\nMR. GANNON: It would be -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And you've bought yourself\na big lawsuit.\nMR. GANNON: It's not simple, Justice\nScalia, in light of the PSLRA, which requires it to be\nalleged with particularity. There need to be facts\nsufficient to give rise to a strong inference that the\ndefendant acted with scienter. And -- and there are\npenalties beyond Rule 11 that are -- that are imposed if\nthe -- if the plaintiff is -- is mistaken in doing so.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: You think attribution to\nthe actor is not necessary for the actor's liability for\na statement?\nMR. GANNON: That's correct. We think that\n-- and any other rule would immunize falsely attributed\nor anonymous statements. And if the whole purpose of a\nfraud was to convince somebody that this statement came\nfrom Warren Buffett, so that I could turn a quick buck\nbefore the market realized that it wasn't actually from\nWarren Buffett, the fact that it was not attributed to\nme would not change the fact that I had made the\nstatement and that the market had relied upon it.\nThe truth is that reasonable investors -\nand that's the test for purposes of reliance -- can rely\non anonymous and falsely attributed statements. In this\ninstance, there's no reason to doubt that an investor\nwould have relied on statements in the prospectus about\nthe fund's purported anti-market timing and excessive\ntrading policies. And so, we think that there -- in\ngeneral, there doesn't need to be an attribution\nrequirement, but in this instance, it's quite clear that\na reasonable investor could have relied on\nthese statements in the prospectus.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, could you have\n-- you just admitted if there -- if the company was\nduped, you couldn't have aiding and abetting liability.\nCould you impose a 20(a) or 20(b) control person\nliability?\nMR. GANNON: The control person liability\nalso needs to have a primary violator under the terms of\n20(a).\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Gannon, suppose that we\nthink that this test that the SEC is using and that you\nrecite on page 13 is really pretty broad and that it\nmight apply to a range of factual situations that are\nnot before us. Is there a way to confine our holding\njust to the mutual fund situation, and if there is, how\nwould you do that?\nMR. GANNON: Well, I think the easiest way\nwould be to analogize it to the cases involving\ncorporate employees. As Petitioners acknowledge, there\nare cases where a corporate employee drafts a statement\nthat's issued in the company's name. In this instance,\nthe investment adviser is management for the company,\nand the fact that they happen to be management by virtue\nof contract rather than just the internal arrangements\nof the corporation shouldn't change that arrangement.\nIt -- it's also the case that if the Court\nwere -- were looking for a way to narrow its holding, it\ncould do so by talking about the elements of the 10b-5\ncause of action, which -- which would apply only to\nprivate suits and -- and not to enforcement actions\nbrought by the Commission or by the Department of\nJustice.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Your point is that -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it should change\nthat, because Congress has made it very clear that\ninvestment advisers are not to be treated like\nemployees. You -- you want us to undo a clear\ndistinction that Congress has made.\nMR. GANNON: Well, the -- the statute says\nthat if somebody -- any person makes the false statement\ndirectly or indirectly -- and in this instance, the SEC\nsought -- got a cease-and-desist order that's reprinted\nat -- on page 407 in the joint appendix that was\npredicated on a provision of the Investment Company Act,\nsection 34(b), that -- that tracks 10(b) and makes it\nunlawful for any person to make any untrue statement of\nmaterial facts. And the Commission believed that they\nwere chargeable with that violation.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.\nGannon.\nMr. Perry, you have 4 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MARK A. PERRY\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. PERRY: Justice Kennedy, in response to\nyour attribution question, Mr. Gannon said something\nabout falsely attributed or anonymous statements. We\nhave neither here. We have a correctly attributed, non\nanonymous prospectus that under Federal law says, on the\nfirst page of the document, who it's attributed to, the\nJanus Funds, who have their own trustees.\nJustice Ginsburg, who is in the driver's\nseat? Page 258a of the joint appendix, quote: \"The\ntrustees are responsible for major decisions relating to\neach fund's objectives, policies, and techniques. The\ntrustees also supervise the operations of the fund by\ntheir officers and review the investment decisions of\nthe officers.\"\nThere is no misdirection here about who's in\ncharge. The trustees are in charge.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But the -- the whole\narrangement was made possible by JCM. JCM wants\nlong-term investors, so it puts this provision in the\nprospectus. The board of directors have no reason to\nbelieve that JCM is dissembling and it's going to go out\nand seek hedge funds.\nMR. PERRY: If it is a dupe case, Justice\nGinsburg and Justice Sotomayor, it's dealt with by\n20(b), which Justice -- Mr. Gannon did not answer.\nYou'll notice 20(b) does not require a primary\nviolation. It allows the Commission to proceed directly\nagainst any person who acts indirectly where it can't\nact directly. So 20(b) answers this problem.\nThe Commission also -- the 34(b) of the\nInvestment Company Act is broader. There's also section\n206 and 215 of the Investment Advisers Act, which\nregulate the conduct of investment advisers.\nCongress has dealt in a very reticulated\nway, and all of the questions today I would submit show\nthe absence of bright lines being proposed by my friends\non this side of the table. They can't articulate the\ndistinction between primary and secondary, between\nprincipal and agent, between aiders and abettors and\nanyone else.\nThis is an area that needs bright lines. It\nneeds to be resolved on motions to dismiss. Scienter\ncan't be resolved on a motion to dismiss. And the\nCongress, in the Dodd-Frank act, which the plaintiffs\nsaid, in their opposition in this Court to this\ncertiorari petition, was going to solve the problem by\nenacting a new statute -- turns out Congress didn't\nenact that statute.\nInstead, Congress referred this issue to the\nGeneral Accounting Office, to the Comptroller General,\nand said take a year, take all the resources of the\nFederal Government, study the problem of the distinction\nbetween companies that issue securities on the one hand,\n-- the funds here -- and those who provide services on\nthe other hand -- the adviser here. And tell us, come\nback to the Congress and tell us whether we need to\nsolve the problem. If the government -\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, just to sum up, if\nthere are -- if investors in a mutual fund are duped by\na false statement that is made in fact, is written by -\nby the management company and issued by the fund without\nknowledge of its falsity, is there any place they can\nget -- look to for relief?\nMR. PERRY: The investors in the mutual\nfund, Justice Alito -\nJUSTICE ALITO: In the mutual fund, yes.\nMR. PERRY: -- got $100 million through the\nSEC action and resolved all the civil litigation.\nThey're a separate class of investors, a whole different\nset of securities laws problems, because they were the\nrecipients of the prospectus that offered these\nsecurities and that contained the false statements.\nThese plaintiffs' fundamental problem -- they didn't\npurchase or sell the securities that were offered by the\nprospectus they complain about. They can't find any\nfalse statements in anything -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Perry, on the\nallegations of this complaint, these plaintiffs were\nharmed by the misrepresentations, the alleged\nmisrepresentations from JCM to the fund. So if the fund\nwas duped, would these shareholders, JCM's shareholders,\nhave any relief?\nMR. PERRY: These shareholders -- JCG's\nshareholders have no relief. And, Justice Kagan, I\nwould point out in the 70 years since the Investment\nCompany Act was enacted and the modern mutual fund\nindustry was built, I'm not aware of any case -- and\nthey certainly haven't cited one -- in which the\ninvestors in the parent company have ever recovered a\ndime in an SEC action, in a private action, or\notherwise, for statements in the funds' prospectuses.\nThere is a -- there is a line between\ncorporate entities, and the liability runs up different\nchannels. This is a totally novel, unprecedented theory\nthat they're presenting.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What was the theory of -\nof the fund shareholders? You said the fund\nshareholders recovered -- there was a settlement.\nMR. PERRY: Right.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What -- what was that\naction?\nMR. PERRY: Their theory was that there was\nan omission. The adviser owned a duty to the fund. The\nstatements were correctly made, Justice Ginsburg. There\nwas no market timing. When the -- when the adviser\nlater allowed certain traders in, it owed a duty to\ncorrect those statements in the prospectuses to the\nfund. That was the liability theory of the investors.\nThese plaintiffs can't pursue that liability\ntheory because the duty doesn't run the other way. It\ndoesn't run from JCM to JCG's investors. That's the law\nof this case. And, therefore, they can't bring an\nomissions case; they have to bring an affirmative\nmisstatements case for statements that were not directed\nto this group of investors.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Perry.\n"
