Am I pronouncing your client's name\ncorrectly?\nORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT E. DOLAN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. DOLAN: Your Honor, it's Hiibel.\nQUESTION: Hiibel. Very well.\nMR. DOLAN: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. May\nit please the Court:\nI'm here today to respectfully ask this\nhonorable Court to find that the search and seizure of my\nclient was illegal and unreasonable and, in the process,\nto reverse my client's conviction.\nPetitioner Hiibel was arrested and convicted of\na crime simply because he did not identify himself or\nprovide identity.\nQUESTION: Could the officer have just said,\nshow me your driver's license?\nMR. DOLAN: We don't believe so, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Why?\nMR. DOLAN: This was not a traffic stop. This\nwas a -- an interaction between a pedestrian and a law\nenforcement officer, wherein the officer -\nQUESTION: But there was evidence -- was it not\nclear that he had been driving and he got out of his\nvehicle? At the time the officer saw him, he was out.\nMR. DOLAN: No, Your Honor. There was never a\nfinding of fact on that issue. In fact, the issue before\nthe trier of fact in the justice of the peace court there\nin Winnemucca was whether or not the -- the charge of\nresisting and delaying the officer occurred.\nQUESTION: What was the factual situation? He\n-- he was certainly right next to a truck, wasn't he?\nMR. DOLAN: Yes. When Deputy Dove arrived at\nthe scene, Mr. Hiibel was standing at the passenger side\nof the car. His daughter was in the cab of the truck by\nthe -- the steering wheel. And when Deputy Dove arrived\non the scene, he began the police-citizen encounter with\nMr. Hiibel. They approached each other. Deputy Dove\nsaid, I heard that there was some kind of a fight. Mr.\nHiibel said, I don't know anything about that. Deputy\nDove then proceeded to ask approximately 11 times for Mr.\nHiibel to provide identification. Let me see ID. Let me\nsee ID.\nQUESTION: But you don't think he could have\nasked for his driver's license?\nMR. DOLAN: No, Your Honor. I don't believe\nthat there was any reasonable basis for that question at\nthat time.\nQUESTION: Well, because the officer had been\ntold that in a truck -- in that truck somebody was hitting\nsomebody.\nMR. DOLAN: Well, we believe that the deputy\ncertainly had the right to ask for identity and -- and we\nthink equally so Mr. Hiibel was free not to respond.\nQUESTION: I see. What -- what do you think the\npurpose of our -- of our Terry -- of our Terry decision\nis? I mean, it says that when an officer sees somebody in\nsuspicious circumstances, he can stop that person and\ninquire to satisfy himself that nothing -- nothing\nunderhanded is going on. Now, what -- what kind of\nquestions can he ask that -- that must be answered? Any\nat all?\nMR. DOLAN: The -\nQUESTION: He -- he can't even ask the name you\nsay.\nMR. DOLAN: Well, Your Honor -\nQUESTION: Can he ask what -- what are you doing\nhere if he sees somebody hanging around a jewelry store at\n2:00 a.m. and -- and so he -- he conducts a Terry stop?\nWhat -- what can he ask the fellow? What are you doing\nhere? I mean, if he can't give his name, surely he\ndoesn't have to tell the officer what he's doing here.\nMR. DOLAN: Well, we -- we certainly believe\nthat under the Fifth Amendment a person has no obligation\nto respond to -- to that officer. The -- the citizen\nnever knows whether or not the encounter is a consensual\nencounter where he certainly has no obligation to speak or\ndo anything. He -- in fact, he can freely terminate the\nencounter at any time.\nNow, there is, under Your Honor's question, a\nTerry stop. Certainly the citizen doesn't know that. The\nofficer does presumably, and if that Terry stop was to\nevolve into a probable cause circumstance -\nQUESTION: No, it hasn't. It hasn't evolved.\nIt was just a Terry stop.\nMR. DOLAN: Just a Terry stop.\nQUESTION: And you say -\nMR. DOLAN: The officer is allowed to make -\nQUESTION: He's allowed to ask questions, but he\nshouldn't expect answers.\nMR. DOLAN: We certainly don't believe that the\ngovernment can criminalize the non-response which the\nstatute in this case does, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Well, in a Terry stop, when the\nofficer is attempting to make a patdown, can the person\nresist it?\nMR. DOLAN: Not lawfully. I believe that the\nCourt certainly allows, if there is independent basis to\nconclude that the officer -- that the subject is armed,\nthe officer is lawful in using force to apply a patdown\nsearch. And if a person resisted that, then that would be\na basis for a criminal prosecution.\nQUESTION: You take the position, as I\nunderstand your brief, that the purposes of criminal\ninvestigation simply do not extend to asking for the names\nof witnesses, as -- as I understand you. Suppose there's\na -- a bank robbery and -- and there's a fatal shooting\nand the robbers run out of the bank. The police come a\nfew minutes later. Can they ask -- can they require the\nwitnesses to give their names? Can there -- could there\nbe a State statute, properly drawn in that circumstance,\nwhich would require the witnesses to give their names?\nMR. DOLAN: We don't believe so, Your Honor. We\nbelieve that the relation to the State that free citizens\nhave prevent the State from imposing obligations,\naffirmative obligations, to terminate the citizen-police\nencounter.\nQUESTION: Is your -- is your -- your negative\nanswer to my question premised on the Fifth Amendment or\nsome privacy concept?\nMR. DOLAN: The -- yes, Your Honor. The -- the\nprivacy concept that the Fourth Amendment addresses\ncertainly allows a person to be free from an illegal\nsearch. We believe that when the Government is attempting\nto extract data from a person without probable cause, it\nis improper.\nQUESTION: But identity is somehow different.\nIt's kind of a neutral fact. Under your view, it wouldn't\nbe possible to have some national identification card\nrequirement then.\nMR. DOLAN: Your Honor, the -- the name is not\nneutral, certainly in this domestic battery Terry stop,\nbecause the name itself -\nQUESTION: Well, I think one's -- one's name\nprobably is just a neutral fact. It's not incriminating\none way or the other.\nMR. DOLAN: Your Honor, there are numerous\ninstances where one's name is not a neutral fact. In the\nfacts of this case, the underlying purpose of the criminal\ninvestigation was to determine if a domestic battery had\noccurred.\nQUESTION: But there would be no problem in -\nin checking the license on the vehicle and then seeing -\nand then the officer could ask are you whoever is the\nowner of the car.\nMR. DOLAN: Yes, Your Honor. Certainly there\nare numerous investigative tools available to the police,\nincluding running the license plate. In fact, Deputy\nDove -\nQUESTION: Well, he does that.\nQUESTION: You -- you -\nQUESTION: He does that and the person is -\nQUESTION: You can ask -- you can ask if he's\nthe owner of the car, the registered owner of the car, but\nyou can't ask him his name?\nMR. DOLAN: Well, we certainly believe that had\nthat been the facts in the case and Mr. Hiibel chose not\nto respond, there would not be a basis that's proper under\nthe law for a criminal prosecution in that regard, Your\nHonor.\nQUESTION: Yes, but I thought -- no. You were\ngoing to say something.\nQUESTION: That's all right. Go ahead.\nQUESTION: I -- I thought your position was that\nif it had been sufficiently apparent that Mr. Hiibel was\nassociated with the truck, that he owned it, had been\ndriving it or something like that, that under those\ncircumstances, the -- the police could have -- could have\nexercised the State's regulatory power over motor vehicles\nand said, show me your driver's license or show me your\nregistration. Is that correct?\nMR. DOLAN: We believe that -- that that is the\nlaw, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: All right.\nMR. DOLAN: But this was not the case.\nQUESTION: And you're saying the reason they\ncouldn't do any of those things here, in the sense of\ndemanding compliance, is that there wasn't a sufficient\nconnection shown between the -- the -- Mr. Hiibel and the\ntruck. Is that what it boils down to?\nMR. DOLAN: Nor was it relevant at trial, Your\nHonor.\nQUESTION: Oh, okay. But I mean, we're talking\nabout the scene. And at the scene, you're saying there\njust wasn't a predicate for forcing him to answer those\nquestions.\nNow --\nMR. DOLAN: That is correct, Your Honor. And it\nwas -- it was not a fact that was deemed relevant by the\nState at the time or the defense.\nQUESTION: Since -- and since there was not, I\ntake it your general position is that they can ask him\nanything. He does not have to say anything in response to\nany question they ask. Period.\nMR. DOLAN: That is -\nQUESTION: Isn't that it?\nMR. DOLAN: Yes, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Could they have -- could they -\nQUESTION: And that sort of assumes that there's\nno responsibility on the part of citizens. I mean, but we\nimpose all sorts of responsibilities on citizens in\nconnection with the -- the determination of criminal\nactivity. I mean, harboring a felon is -- is a crime.\nIt's -- it's unlawful to give a false response to a -- to\ninquiry by a Federal investigative officer. Why isn't it\na perfectly reasonable responsibility of a citizen, when\nhe's a witness to the -- to a crime, to have to give his\nname so that he may call -- be called upon to testify?\nWhy isn't that a minimal -- a minimal citizen's\nresponsibility and likewise in these circumstances? I\ncannot imagine that any responsible citizen would have -\nwould have objected to giving the name. And if -- if I -\nif one feels that way about it, why is it a violation of\nthe Constitution to -- to have citizens do what every\nresponsible citizen, it seems to me, would do?\nMR. DOLAN: Your Honor, the imposition of an\naffirmative duty to avoid criminal sanction when you are\notherwise innocent of any crime is an improper tipping of\nbalance in favor of the State at the expense of some\nvery -\nQUESTION: It's not in favor of the State.\nIt's -\nQUESTION: What's your best case for that\nproposition?\nMR. DOLAN: Your Honor, the numerous anonymous\nactivities that this Court finds to be important to the\nmaintenance of a free society engaging -\nQUESTION: NAACP v. Alabama, but that was a\nsuspect class, membership lists. What -- what else do you\nhave?\nMR. DOLAN: Your Honor, also the Watchtower line\nof cases, religious solicitation, religious door-to-door\nactivity.\nQUESTION: That was a burden on speech.\nMR. DOLAN: That is correct, Your Honor. I'm\naddressing circumstances where a citizen also is left at\nthe mercy of the discretion of an officer. No citizen can\nsafely have a voluntary interaction with an officer\nwithout risking arrest because there was no obligation in\nthe law for the officer to say, as a result of you telling\nme that you have a red car, I now determine that\nreasonable suspicion exists.\nQUESTION: What about giving this man, who\nappeared to be under the influence of alcohol, a\nbreathalizer test? Nothing different. It's just as a\nbasis for a Terry stop. He's now out of the car. The\nofficer thinks Mr. Hiibel could be a menace on the road\nand so says, I'm giving you a breathalizer test. Could he\nsay -- could he resist that?\nMR. DOLAN: We -- we don't believe that there\nwas reasonable suspicion at all that he was the operator\nof the car and there would have been no lawful basis for\nthe -\nQUESTION: Well, the -- there's a passenger\nsitting on the passenger seat, and he's gotten out and\nhe's on the driver's side. Right?\nMR. DOLAN: No, Your Honor. In fact, Mr. Hiibel\nwas standing at the passenger side door and the -\nQUESTION: And the -- there was somebody in that\nseat.\nMR. DOLAN: No, Your Honor. There -\nQUESTION: Where -- where was the daughter?\nMR. DOLAN: The daughter was -- when the officer\narrived behind the wheel. She eventually slid over to the\npassenger side when she was -- towards the end of the\nencounter, she exited and then was thrown to the ground\nand arrested. But -\nQUESTION: Could -- could she have been asked\nthe name? Could she have been asked her father's name?\nMR. DOLAN: Certainly. I believe available to\nDeputy Dove at the time was to do what he was there to do,\nand that was to investigate to see if a domestic battery\nhad occurred. I don't believe the issue before the Court\nis whether or not Deputy Dove engaged in the best or worst\npolice activity. I believe the issue before this Court -\nand with respect to Justice Kennedy's question, homeless\npeople do not have the appropriate residences, permanent\nresidences, and accordingly would be unable to provide\ntheir identification.\nQUESTION: Yes, but have -- have our Terry cases\nsuggested that the whole point of a stop and a search,\nbased on reasonable suspicion, is to make identification?\nMR. DOLAN: No, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: No?\nMR. DOLAN: In -- no, Your Honor. I believe\nthat certainly the concurring opinion of Justice White in\nTerry itself clearly stated that he was of the opinion\nthat a person is not obliged to respond to -\nQUESTION: Well, that was a concurring opinion.\nDo you think that a person stopped on reasonable\nsuspicion can be compelled to give a fingerprint?\nMR. DOLAN: That is a qualitatively different\ninvasion of one's privacy. But unless -\nQUESTION: Well, yes or no.\nMR. DOLAN: Well, as a -\nQUESTION: No?\nMR. DOLAN: -- general rule, no. There may be\nsome exceptions. This Court has addressed the possible\nexceptions like being -- the officer knows that a\nmurder/rape has occurred, fingerprints, bloody\nfingerprints, were found at the scene, there was\nindependent facts to tie the person to that scene. And\nthe purpose of -- of a fingerprint would be to confirm or\ndispel that officer's specific concern about the possible\ncriminality of that one person, and the Court has\nindicated that that may be appropriate. But that's a very\n-- that's -- was limited to those facts.\nThis was a misdemeanor.\nQUESTION: So the -- the officer who approaches\nsomebody in a perfectly valid Terry stop, a really\nsuspicious looking character, he puts several questions to\nhim and the guy says, I'm -- I'm -- you know, I ain't\ntalking, the officer just has to turn on his heel and\nleave the suspicious character to go about his suspicious\nbusiness.\nMR. DOLAN: Your Honor -\nQUESTION: He can't -- he can't say, come along\nwith me. You know, we'll find out who you are and why\nyou're here. He can't do that.\nMR. DOLAN: We believe the law under Wardlow,\nYour Honor, requires that unless the police officer is\nable to escalate his basis of knowledge to probable cause\nafter a reasonable period of time of inquiry -\nQUESTION: Why isn't the -- maybe you and I\ndiffer on -- on what the -- what the course of a\nresponsible citizen is. I would think the course of a\nresponsible citizen would be to answer the question what\nyou're doing here and what your name is. And if he\ndoesn't answer that, I would -- I would say that that make\n-- may cause the situation to rise to the level of\nprobable cause.\nMR. DOLAN: We -- we -\nQUESTION: He's hanging around a jewelry store.\nIt's late at night. He won't say who he is. He wouldn't\n-- won't say what he's doing there. I would -- I would\ndrag him in.\nMR. DOLAN: Well, the -- the person could be\npurchasing jewelry for his paramour and -- and he does not\nwant his wife to know.\nQUESTION: It's possible but unlikely.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: But isn't there another answer?\nQUESTION: Suppose --\nQUESTION: Isn't there another answer?\nQUESTION: -- suppose there is probable cause to\narrest and an arrest is made. Could the State then\nrequire that the person answer as to his identity just so\nthat the officer can confirm that he's got the right\nperson?\nMR. DOLAN: Again, I believe even in a post\nprobable cause booking procedure, a person has the right\nto remain silent if they view from their perspective -\nand I believe this is what the test is. Rhode Island v.\nInnis would -- would suggest that.\nQUESTION: Now, is that a Fifth Amendment\nprivilege that you're -\nMR. DOLAN: Yes.\nQUESTION: -- indicating here?\nMR. DOLAN: Yes, Your Honor, because one's\nname -\nQUESTION: Well, it -- it seems to me that that\nis such a -- a minor detail, in light of what the police\ncan get in any event with fingerprints and so forth, that\nthe Fifth Amendment should just say that that's not\ntestimonial.\nMR. DOLAN: Well, the -- the Fifth -\nQUESTION: I mean, you're not probing the\nperception, the memory, the cognition of the witness.\nYou're just determining an extrinsic fact.\nMR. DOLAN: Your Honor, the -- the name is in\nfact testimonial because it is an assertion of fact, and\none can lie about one's name, and accordingly, I think -\nbelieve the test of what's testimonial or not is met.\nIt's also incriminating because if an officer\ndetermines that probable cause exists that a domestic\nbattery has occurred, that officer must arrest that\nperson.\nQUESTION: May I ask you this question that\nreally follows up on Justice Scalia's question? Would you\nalso argue that the refusal to give the name could not be\ncounted as an additional fact to establish probable cause?\nMR. DOLAN: Yes, Justice Stevens. We believe\nthat a certain -- any -\nQUESTION: So you're not just relying on the\nfact that the refusal is itself a crime in this case.\nMR. DOLAN: That -- that -- I'm -\nQUESTION: You could again then say you could\nnot even take it into account for determining whether\nthere's enough evidence to -- to take him to the station.\nMR. DOLAN: The -- the exercise of a\nconstitutional right can never increase one's level of -\nQUESTION: Yes, but suppose he -\nQUESTION: What -- what about -- what about,\nsay, the murder scene exception we talked about in that\nArizona case where an officer hears a shot fired, comes\ninto the house, there are eight or nine people in the\nhouse. Obviously, there's a dead body in the middle of\nthe floor. Can he ask everybody else for their names?\nMR. DOLAN: Well, we certainly believe the\nofficer can ask.\nQUESTION: And are they obligated to respond?\nMR. DOLAN: I don't believe so, Your Honor, and\nI believe that the imposition of a criminal sanction for\nsilence is --\nQUESTION: Well, how are we ever -- how are we\ngoing to solve a murder case if that's the law?\nMR. DOLAN: Well, after -- post probable cause,\nthe law is a person is warned. They are informed of their\nright to remain silent. They are also informed of other\nconstitutional rights.\nQUESTION: No, no, no. The Chief Justice's\nhypothetical is like my bank hypothetical. It said -\nwe're just talking about witnesses now.\nMR. DOLAN: Well, I don't -- I certainly think\nthat the State's case about the lawfulness of an arrest\nand a conviction is -- is weaker for seizing a witness who\nexercises their right to remain silent.\nQUESTION: But there are situations where the\nState can -- that we -- well, Byers is one where we've\nalready said the name can be requested. People are\nrequired, when there's a registration for the draft, to\ngive their names which -- and that can't be made into a\nconsensual situation in exchange for some benefit. So\nwe've treated names -- the question of name differently,\nand there are many situations in which you are required to\ngive the name.\nMR. DOLAN: Well, Your Honor, as regards the\nByers case, that statute spoke of a regulatory scheme in\nwhich the -- the identity, which was required to be given,\nwas not to a member of law enforcement. It was to the\nowner of a vehicle. The Nevada statute in question\nspecifically contemplates that the dialogue occurs within\na criminal investigation in a Terry stop, which was\ndifferent from Byers certainly, and also the intent of the\nstatute in Byers was just to ensure that civil liabilities\nwould be satisfied.\nQUESTION: Well, in terms of the State's need to\nknow this information, how do you distinguish it from\nrequiring people to register, give their name for the\ndraft?\nMR. DOLAN: In this case, Your Honor, the -- the\nname is testimonial and incriminating because of the\ndynamic of the Nevada statute in question.\nQUESTION: Well, you should just plead the Fifth\nAmendment, say, I -- I refuse to answer on the ground that\nit might incriminate me. That -- was that -- was that\nwhat was done here? I didn't realize you're -- you're\nmaking a -- a Fifth Amendment incrimination claim. Is\nthat -\nMR. DOLAN: We are, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: -- is that part of your -\nQUESTION: I -- I can go back for a second -\nMR. DOLAN: Yes, Your Honor, we are.\nQUESTION: So that -- that assumes that he was\nguilty and -- and had he not been -- had he not been\nguilty of the beating, then he -- then -- then you would\nacknowledge that he would have had to answer. It's only\nthe person who's guilty of the beating who would have a\nright not to answer.\nMR. DOLAN: One of the interests that the Fifth\nAmendment is designed to protect is to protect people who\nplace -- find themselves in ambiguous circumstances\nwhere -\nQUESTION: No. I think -\nMR. DOLAN: -- their silence or their admission\ncould -\nQUESTION: Please answer the -- the question yes\nor no. Are you saying that only the -- the person who had\nbeen beating the woman in the truck and therefore\ndisclosure of his name would incriminate him, only that\nperson has the right not to answer? Or are you saying\nanybody who was asked had the right not to answer?\nMR. DOLAN: Indeed -- indeed, everyone who was\nasked.\nQUESTION: Under the Fifth Amendment -\nQUESTION: So you're not pleading the Fifth\nAmendment then. I -- that's -- that's what I thought you\nwere arguing and that has nothing to do with the Fifth\nAmendment.\nMR. DOLAN: Well, the -- the -- from the\nperspective of petitioner Hiibel, when Deputy Dove said to\nhim, I -- I hear that there was a fight here, and then\nDeputy Dove started making inquiry of him, I think it was\nreasonable for petitioner Hiibel to realize that at this\ntime he was facing the cruel trilemma, which this Court\nspeaks of, and in fact had -\nQUESTION: Okay, but if -- if at that point I\nhad walked down the street and the cop had turned to me\nand said who are you, I wouldn't have had a Fifth\nAmendment right to refuse, would I?\nMR. DOLAN: If there was an imposition of\ncriminal sanction for the failure to respond -\nQUESTION: No, no, no, no. I mean, you're\nputting the cart before the horse. So far as the Fifth\nAmendment is concerned, whether the cop asked me, whether\nthere's a statute that says you -- you ought to give your\nname to the police, would I have had a Fifth Amendment\nright to refuse?\nMR. DOLAN: If it's not the Fifth Amendment\nright to refuse, it's your right to be let alone which\nis -\nQUESTION: All right. There might be a Fourth\nAmendment -\nQUESTION: -- based upon other constitutional\nprinciples.\nQUESTION: The only thing Justice Scalia and I\nare trying to get at is we thought you were saying at one\npoint that everyone has a Fifth Amendment to refuse to\nidentify himself under all circumstances, and that -- that\n-- is that your position?\nMR. DOLAN: Your Honor, I -- the question is\nonly affirmative as regards the Fifth Amendment if the\nState was to criminalize your silence in respect to that\nquestion.\nQUESTION: Did the Supreme Court of Nevada pass\n-- did you raise a Fifth Amendment question in the -- in\nthe Supreme Court of Nevada?\nMR. DOLAN: We -- we did, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: And did the court pass on it?\nMR. DOLAN: The court rejected the motion for\nrehearing on that issue, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Had you -- had you raised it before\nthe motion for rehearing?\nMR. DOLAN: Yes. Your Honor, it was raised at\nthe trial level through the citation at the trial -- I was\nthe trial attorney -- to Berkemer v. McCarty. We -- I\nappealed to the justice -- excuse me. I appealed to the\nSixth Judicial District Court where both the State and the\ndefendant specifically briefed the Fifth Amendment issues\nand argued the Fifth Amendment issues.\nQUESTION: But -- but your answer that if -- if\nthe law requires that you give your name, then -- then\nthat makes everybody have a Fifth Amendment privilege is\njust -- is just not right. That's just circular. I -- I\nwould agree that there may -- there likely is no Fifth\nAmendment privilege for witnesses or I would -- I would\nstate that. You might not agree.\nAs to people that are suspect of a crime, even\nif they're innocent, if you're -- if you're right that the\nname is protected, then I think the privilege -- that the\nprivilege applies because even if they're innocent, it\nmight be a link in the chain of evidence necessary to\nconvict. That's the -- that's the test.\nBut the question, it -- it seems to me, is\nwhether a name itself -- a name itself is -- is -- has\nsuch intrinsic testimonial consequences as opposed to\nneutral regulatory consequences that it should be within\nthe Fifth Amendment. That, it seems to me, the issue.\nMR. DOLAN: Yes, Your Honor. I believe that's\nwhere the Court will -- will turn on that question.\nBut also with respect to the Fourth Amendment\ninquiry, a name is such that a person has a legitimate\nexpectation in the privacy in that name, otherwise the\ngovernment certainly then could require name tags and\nperhaps color codes.\nQUESTION: But the question of whether or not is\nthat privacy is diminished when they're witnesses to a\ncrime when they're present at a crime scene, and that's\ncertainly much different from saying that all citizens\nhave to give their name anytime a police officer asks them\nfor any reason. That's a completely different case.\nMR. DOLAN: Yes, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: I'm not -- I'm not even sure that the\ndriver of the truck would have a Fifth Amendment right. I\ndon't know how your name incriminates you. Your name may\nhelp to -- to catch you, but I don't know that that\nincriminates you. By giving you -- by giving him your\nname, you are what? Proving that you did something wrong?\nI -- I don't see how it incriminates you.\nMR. DOLAN: If -- if at a traffic stop a request\nfor a name is made by an officer to the person that the\nofficer knows was driving the vehicle, I believe the\nimplied consent rule would -- would allow for the properly\nimposed government sanction in that -- in that -\nQUESTION: The Supreme Court of Nevada in its\nconcluding sentence of the majority says it follows that\nN.R.S. such and such is good law consistent with the\nFourth Amendment. And I don't see in the majority opinion\nany reference to the Fifth Amendment. Now, you say you\nraised it on rehearing?\nMR. DOLAN: Yes, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: And the -- the order of the Supreme\nCourt of Nevada is simply the petition for rehearing is\ndenied.\nMR. DOLAN: The -\nQUESTION: So I'm -- I'm not sure at all you\nraised it sufficiently before the supreme court.\nMR. DOLAN: Your Honor, the issue was also\nbriefed in the opening brief before the Nevada Supreme\nCourt. The -- the Nevada Supreme Court just chose not to\naddress it in their opinion.\nQUESTION: You -- you did raise it then in your\nbriefs.\nMR. DOLAN: Yes, Your Honor, it did.\nYour Honor, I'd like to reserve the remainder of\nmy time.\nQUESTION: Very well, Mr. Dolan.\nMr. Hafen, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF CONRAD HAFEN\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. HAFEN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please\nthe Court:\nThere are three reasons why compelling a\nlawfully detained person to identify himself is reasonable\nunder the Fourth Amendment. It is a minimal intrusion.\nIt advances officer safety, and it promotes effective law\nenforcement in the prevention and detection of crime.\nFurthermore, it does not violate the Fifth Amendment\nprivilege against self-incrimination because identifying\nyourself is a neutral act.\nQUESTION: Now, that -- that goes beyond Byers.\nMy -- my -- the hard part of this case for me is that\nByers which, it seems to me, a much easier case, was so\ndifficult for the Court. You had a fragmented Court. You\ndidn't have an opinion for the majority of the Court. And\nthis, it does seem to me, goes one step beyond Byers with\nreference to the Fifth Amendment.\nMR. HAFEN: Well, in regard -\nQUESTION: And -- and Byers didn't take the\nposition that you just take, that it's -- that it's not\ntestimonial. It seems to me that's a plausible enough\nargument, but I -- I can't get that out of Byers.\nMR. HAFEN: Well, Your Honor, in regard to\nByers, it was a plurality opinion, but there was also a\nstrong concurrence by Justice Harlan. And in that\nparticular case, they talk about stating a name and\naddress as being a neutral act, and in the same context,\nthey talked about it in regard to a testimonial situation.\nThey talk about it's a testimonial situation or a non\ntestimonial situation when a person is stopped, the mere\nstopping of the car, but in the same context, they also\nsay stating your name and your address is a neutral act.\nQUESTION: Well, I'll -- I'll look at it again,\nbut it seems to me even the Harlan opinion was in the\ncontext of what we might call the regulatory zone of -- of\nautomobile -- automobile regulation and control.\nMR. HAFEN: They did talk about that, Your\nHonor, but in the same context, they also describe or they\n-- they address it in the criminal context. The plurality\nopinion addresses it in the criminal context, and Justice\nHarlan also addresses it in the plurality -- or -\nQUESTION: The plurality opinion said that\nnoting a name -- notes that a name, quote, identifies but\ndoes not by itself implicate anyone in criminal conduct -\nMR. HAFEN: That's correct.\nQUESTION: -- which is the same point.\nMR. HAFEN: That's correct, Your Honor. That -\nthat goes to the incriminating part of it, but when they\ntalk about the neutral act, we're interpreting that to go\nto the testimonial part of it.\nAnd this Court traditionally treats names\ndifferently.\nQUESTION: You said name and address. What else\nwould be under your neutral category? Could a telephone\nnumber, e-mail address? How much fits in that neutral\ncategory that citizens can be required to answer?\nMR. HAFEN: Your Honor, the statute in Nevada\ndoesn't go that far. It simply says compelling -- the -\nthe identification or to identify one's self. So under\nthe Nevada statute, those type of identifiers -\nQUESTION: But I'm asking you what fits -- what\nfits within this neutral -- you -- you say that there are\ncertain things you can ask a person that they can be\nrequired to respond to because they're not incriminating\nand they're not a violation of privacy. They're just\nneutral. So I'm just trying to get a handle on if we say\nname is neutral, what else are we implicating.\nMR. HAFEN: You could certainly make the\nargument that those other things that you suggested, Your\nHonor, are neutral. However, going back to the Fourth\nAmendment, they really don't serve the purpose of officer\nsafety. It's the name that you need so that you can\ndiscover who this person is, what their background is -\nQUESTION: I -- I don't follow that really\nbecause I can understand the Terry stop. You have to pat\ndown immediately because the officer is at risk that the\nperson will be armed. But by the time they do the\ncomputer check, the harm -- I mean, that doesn't arrest\nthe situation. It doesn't protect. How is the officer\nprotected in that interval between when the person says I\nwon't give you my name -- I mean, it had to -- it has to\ntake some time to do a check, doesn't it?\nMR. HAFEN: Well, Your Honor, going outside the\nrecord, based on my experience as a prosecutor, that\ninformation can be received in just a -- a matter of\nminutes. And so while the officer is waiting for that\ninformation, he can certainly take the posture of\nprotecting himself.\nHowever, after receiving that information and\nobtaining the criminal history on this person -- perhaps\nhe has a -- a history of battery on police officers -- he\ncan then escalate protection. He either calls for backup\nor perhaps unholsters his -- his revolver. He has a\nnumber of things that he can do after he gets that\ninformation. And so it is critical.\nQUESTION: Does that -- does not information\nconvert reasonable suspicion into probable cause?\nMR. HAFEN: Well -\nQUESTION: Suppose he finds he's a real bad guy.\nDoes it now become probable cause?\nMR. HAFEN: That certainly adds into the\nequation, Your Honor, but that in and of itself wouldn't\nconvert into probable cause. The officer would have to\nlook at the totality of the circumstances and on review\nof -\nQUESTION: Well, the totality of the\ncircumstances are in -- in the beginning he has reasonable\nsuspicion but not probable cause. The one thing he\nlearns, in addition to that, is this is a bad guy. Is it\nnow probable cause?\nMR. HAFEN: Well, again, I -- I don't believe so\nbecause there would be other factors that would -- would\nhave to be taken into consideration.\nQUESTION: But I've already given you all the\nfactors. What other factors are there? The total of the\nfactors that exist are there's only reasonable suspicion.\nWe add one more fact: he's a bad guy. Does that make it\nprobable cause?\nMR. HAFEN: No.\nQUESTION: Why not? Why not? He has a record.\nQUESTION: Well, it might if he's a bad guy with\na particular -- with a particular pattern. It was a\njewelry store and he said he's a bad guy because he robbed\na lot of jewelry stores under these same circumstances. I\nmean, you could play with hypotheticals, it seems to me.\nQUESTION: He has robbed this same jewelry store\n10 previous times.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: Don't you think that would elevate it\nto probable cause?\nMR. HAFEN: Under your hypothetical, yes.\nQUESTION: Yes, but the likelihood of -- the\nlikelihood of getting that precise information is quite\nremote, I think, in most of these cases.\nMR. HAFEN: That's -- that's correct.\nQUESTION: What about Berkemer?\nMR. HAFEN: Excuse me?\nQUESTION: I -- I've read the -- the brief here.\nIt's a case called Berkemer v. McCarty referred to on page\n13. There must be some obvious answer I'm missing.\nThey're talking about a Terry stop and they say -- the -\nthe Court says this. You can ask him questions, but the\ndetainee is not obliged to respond and then a bunch of\nothers. So if he's not obliged to respond, he's not\nobliged to respond. Now, what do we do about that case?\nMR. HAFEN: Well, Your Honor, two responses.\nFirst of all, I believe that reference in Berkemer is -\nis dicta by the Court. The real holding in Berkemer was a\nMiranda issue.\nSecond, this Court has never specifically\naddressed this question.\nQUESTION: All right. So what you're saying is\nthat there's a lot. You know, they have like two pages\nhere of different judges, Harlan, White, Berkemer, Davis,\nand each time the Court said, but they're not obliged to\nrespond.\nNow -- now, I -- what I thought -- I guess I'm\napproaching this case quite differently, but I thought\nwe're not talking about national ID cards. What we're\ntalking about are Terry stops. And a Terry stop is a\nderogation from the ordinary situation where you can walk\nalong and do what you want. So if we're derogating from\nthe person's ordinary freedom, what the Court did in\ncarving out exception was to create a condition. You can\nask, but he doesn't have to answer.\nNow, the virtue of that is simple. Anyone can\nunderstand it and it doesn't get us into all these\nproblems that were raised previously whether those\nproblems are right, wrong, or indifferent. So if I read\nthree Supreme Court cases and it all says that, I think\nmaybe there's some burden in saying on your part why we\nshouldn't just follow what it says.\nMR. HAFEN: Well, in subsequent opinions that\nwere cited by the petitioner, they discuss the -- either a\ndissent or a concurring, and in those particular\nreferences, the Justice does say unsolved crimes,\nquestions to unsolved crimes, or as Justice White said -\nQUESTION: Then why complicate the matter? That\nis, you've already said a name doesn't normally\nincriminate you, but it could. Suppose his name is Killer\nMagee. I don't know.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: I mean, it's possible. And then I\nguess you could have other questions, you know, that don't\nnormally incriminate you. Are you hungry? Would you like\nto sit down? But -- so -- so why get into this\ncomplicated thing of saying whether a question normally\nisn't or normally is or sometimes or sometimes? Why don't\nwe just follow what the Court said?\nMR. HAFEN: Because again, Your Honor, I don't\nbelieve in this particular issue where it's a stop and\nidentify statute, that the Court has specifically\naddressed that.\nQUESTION: I thought your answer -\nQUESTION: And there's another answer that -\nQUESTION: -- is because the Court said it in\ndictum. Right?\nMR. HAFEN: That -- that's correct.\nQUESTION: What case are you referring to when\nwe said it in dictum?\nMR. HAFEN: In Berkemer v. McCarty.\nQUESTION: But even there, we did not say it was\na Fifth Amendment violation.\nQUESTION: Right.\nQUESTION: A Fifth Amendment privilege, and\nthat's what you're -- you're here to argue. You're here\nto say that this is just not covered by the Fifth\nAmendment and it is not testimonial. It's a neutral fact.\nQUESTION: I -- I agree with you about that.\nI'm talking about a Terry stop and I'm simply -\nQUESTION: Which is a Fourth Amendment issue.\nQUESTION: That's right.\nQUESTION: We have both issues here, do we not?\nQUESTION: Right, right, right.\nQUESTION: Fourth Amendment and Fifth Amendment?\nEven if it doesn't violate the Fifth Amendment, we're\nstill going to have to answer the Fourth Amendment\nquestion I guess.\nMR. HAFEN: That's correct, Your Honor, and\nthat's when the Court would engage in a balancing test.\nAnd the Court traditionally has balanced -\nQUESTION: But we have not expressly said that\nNevada can require identification, or any other State. We\nhaven't said that in a holding.\nMR. HAFEN: That's correct.\nQUESTION: And the language is --\nQUESTION: Nor -- nor have we said otherwise.\nMR. HAFEN: That's correct.\nQUESTION: It is correct? I'm sorry. Not in a\nholding, but I mean, there are about four cases where they\nsay, of course -- and of course, it's that. Now, I grant\nyou that dicta, which of course this is, is -- varies in\nits strength and so forth, but if we have a repeated\nseries of cases that say it, doesn't there have to be a\npretty good reason for departing from it? And that's what\nI'm listening for: a pretty good reason.\nQUESTION: Well, do all those cases that you're\nreferring to hypothesize the existence of reasonable\nsuspicion or are some of them just confrontation without\nreasonable suspicion?\nMR. HAFEN: Well, are you -- in regard to\nBerkemer?\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. HAFEN: In regard to Berkemer, again that\nwent back to a Miranda issue, whether an individual -\nwhether an officer would have to read Miranda to a -\nduring a traffic stop. And -\nQUESTION: But he says this while discussing\nTerry stops. That they said this while discussing Terry\nstops. Is that so in respect to Berkemer? I'm just\nreading the brief. The -- the language I quoted was while\ndiscussing Terry stops.\nMR. HAFEN: That -- that's correct. The Court\nultimately decided that a traffic stop was akin to a Terry\nstop. But the Court also addressed it in the situation of\na Fifth Amendment issue under a -- a Miranda concept.\nQUESTION: Well, I -\nQUESTION: Could you -- could you explain to us\nwhy you think the Nevada Supreme Court didn't mention the\nFifth Amendment in its opinion?\nMR. HAFEN: Your Honor, I -- I don't know. I am\nof the opinion that the -- the opinion simply addresses\nthe Fourth Amendment issue. Why they didn't address the\n-- the Fifth Amendment I don't know. Those -- those\nissues were certainly presented to that court.\nQUESTION: Because they're quite different, and\ncertainly the Fifth Amendment issue is important and\nperhaps even harder than the other issue.\nMR. HAFEN: To -- to some extent, Your Honor.\nBut again, our position is that it is not testimonial and\nit's not incriminating. It's simply -\nQUESTION: But it -- but it is the -- the odd\nthing about this case is that the inquiry is made and it's\nsignificant only in the context of a criminal\ninvestigation. That's the only time the statute applies,\nwhen you've got a Terry stop.\nMR. HAFEN: That -- that's correct. And in\nregard to the Fourth Amendment, again it gets back to this\nbalancing issue. This Court is going to have to balance\nthe -- any apparent personal security interests of Mr.\nHiibel against the important legitimate interests that the\ngovernment has in this case. And again, it gets back to\nofficer safety. It gets back to the prevention and\ndetection of crime. And again -\nQUESTION: Well, I understand all the arguments\non the Fourth Amendment, but for me the more difficult\nissue, frankly, is the Fifth Amendment. And it's really\nstrange that they didn't -- they didn't discuss it at all\nand it is strange that -- we're all concerned about\nidentification cards and national and all this sort of\nstuff. But this case is very, very narrow. It's just a\ncase where somebody gets stopped. He doesn't realize\nthere's a statute on the books that said, if you don't\nanswer, you can go to jail or get -- get arrested. The\nfunny thing about it is there are no warnings required\nhere.\nMR. HAFEN: Well, in this particular case, the\ndeputy did warn him. In fact, the evidence is clear in\nthe joint appendix on page 4 that the finding of fact by\nthe justice court was that Deputy Dove did tell Mr. Hiibel\nif you don't give me identification, I'm going to have to\narrest you.\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. HAFEN: And so in this particular case, he\nwas placed on notice -\nQUESTION: Of course, the statute -- but the\nstatute didn't require that.\nMR. HAFEN: That -- that's correct. The statute\ndoes say, shall identify yourself.\nQUESTION: Well, ignorance of the law is\ngenerally no excuse, is it?\nMR. HAFEN: That's correct. That's correct.\nQUESTION: Well, I agree that the Fifth\nAmendment is -- is the hard -- harder question in this\ncase, especially given the convoluted opinions in Byers.\nIt does seem to me that because the statute really focuses\non what we might call Terry stops, that you have a class\nof persons who are within the zone of the commission of a\ncrime, and so the Fifth Amendment becomes -- it becomes\nslightly more of a suspect class. I don't know how that\ncould take care of the witness hypothetical. But this\nperson was certainly under suspicion of -- of criminal\nactivity.\nMR. HAFEN: Well, to some extent, but going back\nto the videotape that -- that the Court has, after Deputy\nDove asked the -- or informed Mr. Hiibel, I'm here because\nof a fight between the two of you, he indicates, I know\nnothing about that. So that may very well take him\nsomewhat out of the class of a suspect now to a potential\nwitness. At that time, Deputy Dove, based on that\nresponse, doesn't know now, well, is this the man that was\nreported hitting the woman in the truck or did that person\nleave and this is simply another passenger in the truck.\nSo viewed objectively, he has every right or -- to -- to\nask the question and because it wouldn't constitute a\nFifth Amendment violation in that context if Mr. Hiibel\ntruly was a witness, then he would be obligated to answer\nthe question.\nQUESTION: What -- what's the closest case you\nhave for us? The Nevada court doesn't address this issue.\nWhat's the closest case you have for us to show that this\nis not a Fifth Amendment violation?\nMR. HAFEN: It would be Byers, and we rely upon\nByers. And again, granted, it's a plurality decision but\nwith a strong concurrence by Justice Harlan.\nQUESTION: I -- I thought your -- you were\nsaying earlier that your strongest reason would be that he\nhad already, in effect, taken himself out of Fifth\nAmendment protection by saying I know nothing about that.\nMR. HAFEN: In -- in that context, yes, because\nnow he, according to Deputy Dove, viewed objectively, is\npotentially a -- a witness.\nQUESTION: Yes, but then your rationale for the\narrest should be that you're a potential witness, and for\nthat reason, we have a right to -- we have a right to\napprehend the witness to make him testify to the crime.\nYou don't need the -- the Terry stop rationale for that.\nIf you think he's a witness to a crime, the Terry stop is\nreally irrelevant.\nMR. HAFEN: Well, but the reasonable suspicion\nwas formed prior to meeting with -- with Mr. Hiibel. So\nhe had every -- at least he had the reasonable suspicion\nfor initially detaining.\nQUESTION: From the standpoint of the Fifth\nAmendment, what rule do you want us to adopt? When can\nthe police require persons to give their identity in your\nview under the Fifth Amendment constitutionally?\nMR. HAFEN: During -- first of all, you have to\nmake sure that there's reasonable suspicion to detain the\nperson and at that point then when the officer asks the\nperson for identification or what his name is, then if the\nperson doesn't respond, then the person can be arrested.\nQUESTION: What about our witness hypothetical\nwhere -- the Chief Justice's hypothetical of -- of the\nmurder with five people standing there and my hypothetical\n-- you don't -- you don't think the police can demand\nidentification at that point from witnesses?\nMR. HAFEN: Oh, they -- they certainly could\ndemand at that point.\nQUESTION: What -- could they be criminalized if\nthey fail to give the answer?\nMR. HAFEN: Well, it depends if at that time\nthere's reasonable suspicion to believe that one of those\nindividuals may have committed a crime.\nQUESTION: Oh, so then you're abandoning the\nwitness rationale.\nQUESTION: Well, but the statute doesn't apply\nto pure witness. That's the point. This -- this statute\ndoes not apply to the -- to the witness of the bank\nrobbery who's not suspected of doing the robbery.\nMR. HAFEN: Well, again, it's -- it's going to\ndepend on the -- the search -- the situation.\nQUESTION: No. The -- the hypothetical\nsituation is purely a witness. They've been standing in\nline at the counter. He saw somebody rob the bank. But\nhe's not suspected at all. All -- our hypothetical -- you\ncould make him give his name because you want his\ntestimony at the trial. But that's not a -- that's not\nthis statute.\nMR. HAFEN: Right. The statute is specifically\ntied into reasonable suspicion and whether that person may\nhave committed a crime. I agree, yes.\nQUESTION: Well, it would be rather odd that you\ncould ask innocent people to give their name and not -\nand not a person under criminal suspicion.\nMR. HAFEN: Well, again, let -- let me back up.\nQUESTION: Do you think that maybe when he's\ninvoking the Fifth Amendment, he has to invoke the Fifth\nAmendment?\nMR. HAFEN: Yes.\nQUESTION: Do you think maybe -- if he just\ncan't say I won't answer -- he can be arrested if he just\nsays I won't answer, but if he says I won't answer on the\nground that it might tend to incriminate me, then the\npoliceman would probably have probable cause. Wouldn't\nhe?\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: But it seems to me sort of -- you\nknow, sort of sneaky to invoke the Fifth Amendment without\ninvoking the Fifth Amendment. He -- he didn't -- that\nwasn't the reason he gave for not answering. I thought\npeople usually invoke the Fifth Amendment. They say, I\nrefuse to answer that question -- you know, they have\ntheir lawyer next to them -- on the ground that it might\ntend to incriminate me.\nMR. HAFEN: Well, they do -\nQUESTION: Can they -- can they just say I don't\nwant to answer that question?\nMR. HAFEN: I don't believe so. I think that's\na very vague response, and I think they'd have to\nspecifically invoke the Fifth Amendment. And as -\nJustice Scalia, as you pointed out, typically when they do\nthat, they do that in the context of maybe a grand jury\nhearing or -- or a criminal trial.\nAnd so, again, the State's position in -- in\nregard to this particular case is that as it relates to\nthe Fifth Amendment, is the name itself is a neutral act.\nIt simply doesn't implicate an individual in any criminal\nconduct. It doesn't say in this particular case in regard\nto Mr. Hiibel, that he struck the woman. It doesn't even\nimply that he may have been driving the car. It doesn't\ngo to any -\nQUESTION: May -- may I interrupt? How do you\ndistinguish this so-called neutral fact from a billion\nother neutral facts which have evidentiary significance in\na criminal trial? It's a neutral fact that I'm wearing a\npinstripe suit, but if the evidence was that the bank\nrobber was wearing a pinstripe suit, this -- this would be\nrelevant evidence and it might tip the scale in -- in\nproof. It's neutral.\nMR. HAFEN: Well, that would certainly go to the\nWade and the Gilbert cases that talk about voice analysis,\nlineup -\nQUESTION: But this is -- this is -\nQUESTION: Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Hafen.\nMR. HAFEN: Thank you.\nQUESTION: Mr. Srinivasan, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF SRI SRINIVASAN\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES\nAS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENT\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nA person detained, based on reasonable suspicion\nof crime, may be required to provide his name to officers\nbecause that requirement contributes significantly to the\nability of law enforcement officers to ensure their own\nsafety and that of the public while imposing only a\nminimal burden on an individual's protected interests in\nprivacy.\nThe question under the Fourth Amendment would be\nwhether an otherwise -\nQUESTION: Would you -- may I just interrupt\nthere? How does it help the officer's safety if -- he's\nmade the patdown. He finds he is or not armed. If he's\narmed, of course, he arrests him. He's not armed. And he\n-- now, how does it help the officer's safety at this\npoint to find out whether he should just let him go away\nor he should call a station and ask -- do something when\nhe knows his name?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Justice Stevens, it's true that\na patdown authority provides a measure of protection for\nan officers, and it's -- it's an important one, but the\nauthority to determine a person's name and thereby run a\nbackground check is a highly significant, complementary\nmeasure.\nQUESTION: Do officers always pat down before\nthey ask questions? I've had officers ask me questions\noften without telling me to spread my legs, put my arms up\nagainst the wall, and they -- they frisk me.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: No. And -- and -\nQUESTION: We certainly wouldn't want to\nencourage that kind of activity, would we?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. SRINIVASAN: No, and a patdown authority is\nconditioned -\nQUESTION: I think the Terry case does encourage\nthat kind of activity. If you have reasonable suspicion,\nthat's the first thing you do is -- is pat them down.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Well, the authority to conduct\na patdown search, first of all, is conditioned on there\nbeing reason -- a reasonable basis for believing that the\nperson is armed and dangerous. And so obtaining a\nperson's name -\nQUESTION: And my question is once he finds he's\nnot armed, why is his officer -- why is his safety\nimplicated by not deciding to let him go instead of\ncalling the station and detaining him further?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Because a patdown isn't\nfoolproof. The -- the officer might be assaulted in a\nphysical assault rather than through the use of arms -\nQUESTION: Well, and a patdown would not -\nMR. SRINIVASAN: -- and in addition --\nQUESTION: A patdown would not occur unless he\nhad reason to believe the person was armed, which in most\ncases he will not have. And he -- if he finds out that\nthe guy he's confronting with is, you know, Machine Gun\nHarry, he's going to have a -- a different approach to\nthat individual. I don't see how there's any question\nthat it -- it can help the -- the officer's safety unless\nyou expect the officer always to pat down people, which\nthey -- they can't do unless they have reason to believe\nthat the person is armed -\nMR. SRINIVASAN: That's -\nQUESTION: -- which usually they don't I assume.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: That's right, Justice Scalia.\nThe first response to Justice Stevens' question is that\nthe patdown authority is conditioned on there being a\nreasonable basis for believing that the person is armed\nand dangerous.\nQUESTION: There has to be a reasonable\nsuspicion, but there doesn't have to be reasonable\nsuspicion that he's armed.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: There has -\nQUESTION: That's not part of the inquiry.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: There has to be a reasonable\nbasis for believing that the person is armed and dangerous\nbefore the authority to conduct a patdown frisk kicks in.\nAnd what the -- what the authority to determine a person's\nname and thereby determine their criminal history does is\nto afford the officer with information that may lead him\nto believe that he's dealing with a dangerous individual.\nQUESTION: Well, is it your position they should\nget the answer to the identity question before they pat\nhim down?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: No. I don't think it's a -\nit's a question of sequence.\nQUESTION: Which comes first in your view in the\nnormal police procedure where there is reasonable\nsuspicion under Terry?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Well, it would -- first of all,\nit would depend on whether there's a reasonable basis for\nbelieving that the person is armed and dangerous because\nif there is not that reasonable basis, the authority\ndoesn't have the authority to conduct a patdown at all.\nQUESTION: All right, but on your reasoning that\nhe can ask for the -- for the name for reasons of safety\n-- and that's why it should be allowed without anything\nmore -- why doesn't exactly that same reason support an\nauthority to -- to patdown even in the absence of any\nreason to believe that the person may be armed and\ndangerous? It would contribute to officer safety.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: No, it would, but the -- the\nreason why the Fourth Amendment requires a showing a\nreasonable basis to believe that they're armed and\ndangerous before conducting a patdown is because, as the\nCourt described the patdown in Terry, it represents a\nsevere intrusion on the person's personal security. And\nthat's not the case for the question, what is your name.\nThat doesn't represent any sort of physical intrusion on\nthe person whatsoever.\nQUESTION: So -- so your argument really boils\ndown to the -- I mean, the -- the crucial part of your\nargument is -- is the -- is the relatively -- relative\ninsignificance of the intrusion.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: That's --\nQUESTION: But for that, we'd be in the same\nboat with name and patdown.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Well, that's critical to\nexplaining why in all cases the officer should have an\nauthority to compel the person to disclose his name.\nQUESTION: The insignificance of the intrusion.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: That's correct.\nQUESTION: Now, I thought -- I thought under\nTerry we've held that a police officer may detain someone\nbriefly without probable cause on a reasonable suspicion\nthe person has committed or is about to commit a crime and\nduring that process may ask all kinds of questions of the\nperson, although, as far as I can find out, this Court has\nsaid the person does not have to respond to the questions.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: What you're pointing to,\nJustice O'Connor, I believe is the dictum that was\ndiscussed early in Berkemer v. -- in Berkemer v. McCarty.\nAnd that, first of all, is dictum, but not only is it\ndictum, it's ambiguous dictum because the language that\nthe Court used was that the officer is entitled to ask a\nmoderate number of questions, first, to determine the\nperson's identity and, second, to obtain information with\nwhich to confirm or dispel the officer's suspicions. And\nthen the Court goes on to say that, of course, the\ndetainee is not required to respond. It's unclear whether\nthat statement concerning that the detainee is not\nrequired to respond relates to the initial basis for\nasking questions which is determinative of his identity.\nQUESTION: But we've just never said that the\nofficer may require the identification. That's what this\ncase asks us to determine.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: That's right, Justice O'Connor,\nbut the Court specifically left the -- the question open,\nat least on two occasions, both in Brown v. Texas and in\nKolender v. Lawson. So I don't think the Court is in any\nway inhibited by its precedents.\nQUESTION: And the right to do a patdown is\nsomething you do after the officer has made the initial\ndecision to detain and ask some questions presumably.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: That's right. That's right.\nIt comes after the officer has made a determination to\ndetain. That's correct.\nThe issue under the Fifth Amendment I think is\n-- is -\nQUESTION: Can we go back to -- would you go\nback to the Fourth because I -- I suppose the -- the\nofficer can ask, you know, and he doesn't get an answer,\nso he pats him down. What's wrong with that?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Well, if he has a reason to\nbelieve -\nQUESTION: I mean, it's very, very unlikely I\nwould think, unless you have some evidence to the\ncontrary, that the officer who's in a Terry stop\nsituation. Are there -- a lot of instances where they\nlook -- he said what's your name and then the person -\nand by the way, you have to answer or you're going to be\nin more trouble so therefore the person gives him his real\nname, which happens to turn out to be one of the worst\ncriminals in the country, and then he pats him down. I\ngrant you that could happen.\nBut contrast that with a situation where you\ntake Berkemer literally, and now you say if he doesn't\nanswer, sure you can pat him down.\nWhat's wrong -- I -- I don't see it. I'm back\nto my point which you heard me ask, and I -- I'd really\nlike an answer in terms of -- I mean, Berkemer cites Davis\nand Davis refers to the settled principle -- settled -\nthat you can't -- you can ask what you want, but they\ndon't have to answer. Okay? So there are a lot of\ncircumstances where it may be national ID cards or\nwhatever, which are not Terry stop situations. But why\nshould we retreat from that dictum?\nNow, I hear your answer about the -- about the\ndanger and I think that's an important point. But I -- I\nsort of canceled that by thinking not answering would also\ngive the policeman a justification for the patdown. And\n-- and now, if that's right, what other reason is there\nfor retreating from the rather strong dictum?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: No, but Justice Breyer, I don't\nthink the patdown eliminates the danger. The patdown is\nimportant in addressing the possibility that the person\nmight use arms that are on their person against the\nofficer, but it does -- it in no way eliminates the danger\nto the officer. And that's why -\nQUESTION: And -- and you don't believe that the\nfailure to give a name gives the officer reason to believe\nthat the person is armed, do you? I mean, simply because\nhe refuses to give you a name, do you have justification\nto do a patdown?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: No. We're not -- we're not\ntaking that position and the courts -\nQUESTION: No, I wouldn't think so. I -- I know\na lot of people that might not want to give their names -\nQUESTION: Well, it would be pretty odd to say\nthat you can force a person to give his name in order to\nprotect the policeman, but the far lesser restriction of\njust taking it into account as evidence you can't do.\nThat would be an unusual position. I mean, taking it into\naccount is a factor suggesting danger, you can't do, but\nof course you can require him to answer under penalty of a\ncrime.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Well, I think -\nQUESTION: So, I mean, everybody is in a false\nposition here because you're -- you're being put in a\nslightly false position.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: I don't know that it's a false\nposition.\nQUESTION: All right. Yes, all right. I'll -\nI'll take your answer. Danger. Is there anything else?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Well, it's not only danger to\nthe officer's safety, but it also could provide crucial\ninformation for the officer to -- to assess the\nindividual's conduct because if the officer learns that\nthe person has previously been convicted of a crime that\nfits the pattern that he observed in deciding to detain\nthe person, then that could go a long ways towards\nofficer's determination that there's probable cause for an\narrest. And of course, that would be crucial in -- in\nterms of public safety because it could prevent commission\nof an imminent offense or the ongoing commission of a\ncontinuing offense.\nQUESTION: Then why -- why do you stop at the\nname? Answers to any questions would have that effect.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: No, that's true. And -- and as\n-- from the perspective of the Fourth Amendment, I'm not\nsure that there's a limitation related to answers to\nquestions. I think the limitation would arise under the\nFifth Amendment, and what the Fifth -\nQUESTION: So -- so far as the -- so far as\nTerry and the Fourth Amendment are concerned, I'm -- I'm\nnot sure I understand you. Are you saying that there is\nan obligation to answer all questions, not just names?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: No. I -- no. The Court hasn't\nspecifically spoken to that question, but we don't\nchallenge the dictum -\nQUESTION: No, but I -- I thought -- is that -\nis that the position that you're taking?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: No. We don't take the -- we\ndon't take that position because we don't challenge the\ndictum in Berkemer and other cases insofar as -\nQUESTION: Okay. Then why do you stop -- why do\nyou stop at the name? Is it again the -- the minimal\nintrusion, that that is a more minimal intrusion than\nother information?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: That's correct.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Srinivasan.\nMr. Dolan, you have 4 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT E. DOLAN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. DOLAN: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nWithin the -- within the Fourth Amendment\nbalancing construct, we believe that the government's\nargument that officer safety is served by requiring a\nperson to utter their name is a false assumption. Truly\nif the officer is stopping Machine Gun Harry and he says,\noh, I'm John Smith, and -- and if you follow the\ngovernment's position, then the officer at that time can\nrelax his guard, thereby increasing the -- the possibility\nof danger. So we think that as the Court engages in the\nanalysis of what is appropriate under the balancing -\nQUESTION: Well, you're -- you're saying people\ncan disobey the law to make it ineffective. That's not\nusually an argument we accept.\nMR. DOLAN: I'm saying that the -- what -- the\ngovernment's argument is based upon the assumption that\neveryone will tell the truth during a Terry stop, and I\ndon't believe that corresponds with common sense,\nespecially if Machine Gun Harry is there. He doesn't want\nto be identified and it's in his interest to say my name\nis Tom Smith. And if you follow the government's\nconclusion -- rather, it's position, then the officer then\nrelaxes his guard, doesn't take appropriate steps. We\nbelieve that officers must protect themselves but do so in\na way that is consistent with the Constitution.\nWhen the Court established the Terry rule, it\ncreated an exception to the previous rule was that\nseizures could only occur on probable cause, which was a\ngreater evidentiary standard. And the Court was very\ncareful to suggest that there was a limited right, not a\ngeneral exploratory search, that now we will be involved\nwhen -- excuse me -- because a name, the government\nsuggests, will be the key to unlock data that is endless,\ngiven the modern age of technology, that the government\ncan learn about that person.\nIt is a general exploratory search which the\ngovernment ultimately is asking this Court to approve of.\nAnd then privacy is a -- a nice principle to talk about as\na part of history. Going forward, it will not be part of\nAmerican citizens' natural relationship by right that they\ncan count on. There are related freedoms that this Court\nalso looks to in the balancing.\nQUESTION: Well, but if there's reasonable\nsuspicion to believe the person is committing a crime, it\ndoesn't shock me that they'd use the identification\nmechanisms to check it out. I mean, we're -- we're on the\nassumption that the person has been stopped on the basis\nof reasonable suspicion -\nMR. DOLAN: And -- and -\nQUESTION: -- of committing a crime.\nMR. DOLAN: I would agree, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: So why not let them check in the\ncomputer records to see if this is the worst prior\noffender they've ever had?\nMR. DOLAN: Well -- well, with respect to the\nTerry stop itself, it is for investigation related to\nwhether or not a crime may occur or is about to occur.\nAnd the officer has available to them tools to inquire.\nThey can temporarily detain the person to see if there are\nwitnesses around who could identify the person as having\nengaged in criminal conduct and the like.\nBut the -- the notion that a person has to\naffirmatively provide a ticket to terminate that Terry\nencounter really tips the balance too much in favor of the\nState and risks a lot of benefits to our society that\naccrue through freely being able to move, to be let alone,\nto engage in protected activity without being subjected to\nthe accosting that one is subjected to during a Terry\nstop.\nSuspicious behavior is not easily or usefully\nquantified, so this Court has found. And because what is\nsuspicious to an officer -\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr. Dolan.\n"
