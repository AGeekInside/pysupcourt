CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear

Northwest Environmental Defense -- Defense Center.
Mr. Bishop.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF TIMOTHY S. BISHOP
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. BISHOP: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,
and may it please the Court:
There is a straightforward ground for
reversal here that rests on a standard application of
deference principles to EPA's treatment of stormwater.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Before -- before we
get into that, congratulations to your clients -
MR. BISHOP: Thank you.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- getting almost
all the relief they're looking for under -- under the
new rule issued on Friday.
MR. BISHOP: Thank you.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And thank you for
calling it to our attention.
MR. BISHOP: Thank you.
The problem with that rule is that it puts
into place something that EPA has been telling the
courts throughout this litigation, that in the
stormwater rule, where EPA refers to Standard Industrial
Classification 2411, that what it is referring to is
solely the four identified point sources in the
silvicultural -- rock crushing and so on.
In this case, NEDC Respondent argues that
the statute -- the language of the statute, which is
that discharges that are associated with industrial
activity must have NPDES permits, prevents EPA from
doing that -
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But there was no ruling
in the court of appeals. The court of appeals did not
rule on the statute -- whether the statute mandates that
these logging roads be governed.
MR. BISHOP: No. It did not. It did not.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: So is -
MR. BISHOP: That is an argument that
Respondents have made in this Court.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: And so that's not a point
that this Court could resolve in the first instance.
MR. BISHOP: Well, I don't think that's -- I
don't think that's right. The -- the Respondent can
defend its judgment on grounds other than those that
were -- that were the basis of the Ninth Circuit
decision.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, you can do that; but
this Court is a court of review, not first view, and we
don't take questions that haven't been aired below.
MR. BISHOP: Well, there -- there is an
additional reason why we don't think that the rule here
moots -- moots the issue. Let -- let's assume that
there is a petition for review.
I think that's a fairly safe -- safe
assumption, that some environmental groups argue that
the new rule is impermissible because it's at odds with
the language of the -- language of the statute, an
argument that I think is -- is near frivolous, but that
I think will be -- predictably will be made.
The rule is prospective. What we have is a
judgment from the Ninth Circuit that says that we were
in violation for decades by not having permits. And -
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but it's -
it's an unusual situation for us to rule in a case -
MR. BISHOP: Yes.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- where the issue
has ongoing significance and that's taken away. And
what we would be doing is, when there is a new rule, we
would be considering quite a lot of difficult issues to
determine what the old rule was, so that you can unravel
what the Ninth Circuit has upheld.
MR. BISHOP: Well, let me argue -- let me -
maybe -
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I thought the case law
was fairly clear that, when the EPA changes its rules in
your favor, that they can't -- the court can't impose
penalties for a past violation.
MR. BISHOP: Well, I wish it were so clear.
Certainly, we think that that is the case.
What they've asked for below is penalties,
attorneys' fees, and remediation of environmental harm.
Now -- now, we think that, under Laidlaw, they shouldn't
be able to get any of those three things.
Now, this only happened on Friday, so I
can't claim that I've done complete research on -- on
the point. But it -- you know, I do think that -- there
doesn't appear to be any law on the application of
Laidlaw to a claim for remediation.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is this a -- is this
a new rule that they -- I too haven't had much of a
chance to look at it. But is this a new rule? Or is it
an amendment of the existing rule?
MR. BISHOP: It's an amendment of the
existing rule. But what it does is to put into place
against the rule exactly what EPA has been saying
throughout this litigation. There is nothing new in the
rule.
So this is something that EPA has been
saying in the litigation and that we think is entitled
to Auer deference as a result of that. Now, it's in the
rule, so it gets -- it gets Chevron deference. But
we -
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Are you sure you
want what you're asking for? What if we go ahead and
decide this case and rule against you?
MR. BISHOP: Well, we are -- we are hoping
that you rule -- you'll rule with us. And certainly, on
the basis of this rule -
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE SCALIA: That's usually the
objective.
MR. BISHOP: On the basis of this rule, you
have to understand that the challenge to this rule is
the claim that the -- the words "associated with
industrial activity" must be interpreted by EPA to
include harvesting activities and the -- the moving of
the logs out of the harvest area. Now, that's -
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Now, I suppose that
your clients and others similarly situated -- or I -- I
guess it would be the Respondents -- can challenge the
new rule, right?
MR. BISHOP: Yes. So -
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you would have,
simultaneously pending, a case involving the
interpretation of the old rule and a challenge to the
new rule.
MR. BISHOP: Right.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Each of which would
have the same issue.
MR. BISHOP: And this Court can cut through
all of that by deciding this case, which the simplest
way to decide this case is under the stormwater rule.
If the Court decides this case in our favor under the
stormwater rule, then that will preclude a large part of
the basis for the challenge to the new rule.
It's squarely in front of this Court.
Mr. Fisher has made the argument here. The stormwater
rule is squarely here. Congress completely revamped the
Clean Water Act's approach to stormwater in 1987, and it
made clear that, as a default, point-source stormwater
is regulated by the State, with NPDES permits required
only for discharges that are associated with industrial
activity and a few other categories.
And those statutory terms, "industrial
activity" and "associated with," are both ambiguous.
And with those words, Congress left EPA with discretion
to determine what activities count as industrial. And
it's in keeping with dictionary definitions for EPA to
have categorized activities like law, banking, retail,
agriculture, and silviculture as not industrial.
JUSTICE KAGAN: But, Mr. Bishop, as -- as
Justice Ginsburg said, that question was not decided
below, and in the context of this case, which, of
course, was very different when it was briefed,
Mr. Fisher spent a grand total of 2 pages and rightly
so. It wasn't -- it was -- it was not the main issue in
the case then.
So would we really be doing something -- you
know, a good practice to decide this issue, without
really any briefing on it and without a decision below?
MR. BISHOP: Well, I think there is briefing
on it. I mean, both parties have briefed it. It gets 2
pages because it's a -- a near-frivolous argument under
the -- under the caselaw, I think. But the fact is, if
you don't -
JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, that isn't really
quite fair. It is 2 pages because it wasn't decided
below and because -- and because the -- the question in
the case was very different, with a different
regulation.
MR. BISHOP: Now, the issue is before this
Court. If the Court doesn't decide the issue, then we
go back. We have to fight for years about remedies -
about the appropriateness of remedies for this
adjudicated past violation under Laidlaw. And Laidlaw
has some very complex law that's developed under it.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: You wouldn't have to do
anything if the Court vacated the decision below. Then
you wouldn't be facing anything.
MR. BISHOP: Well, obviously, if the Court
held the case was moot, then we'd like the -- the
vacatur. But in addition -
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Would you be -
MR. BISHOP: -- there's going to be a
challenge to the new rule -
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Would you be entitled to
it?
MR. BISHOP: Yes, we believe we are entitled
to vacatur.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: So -- so if you're right,
that you're entitled to it and we agree with you, then
there is nothing. You don't have anything hanging over
your head as a result -
MR. BISHOP: Well, what's left -- what's
left of -
JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- of the prior decision.
MR. BISHOP: -- what's left at that point is
another 5 or 6 years of litigation under the new rule on
an issue that is briefed in this Court, before this
Court, and I think relatively easy to decide under the
stormwater rule.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Are you -- which
issue are you talking about? The industrial activities
issue or the silvicultural?
MR. BISHOP: The industrial activities
issue. I mean, the -- the rest of this case has become
very complex, I think, because of -- of the -- you know,
the government has raised the Seminole Rock argument
that -- that no one's ever heard of before. Mr. Fisher
has introduced an argument about whether the 1375(b)
categories -- this case falls within those categories.
But there is a simple way to decide this
case, and that is, under the stormwater rule, EPA had
the discretion to determine what activities are
industrial, and it determined that timber harvesting is
not industrial. It defined "immediate access roads" in
a way that does not cover these -- these roads, even if
it were industrial.
And these are terms -- the term "industrial"
is one that is ambiguous. The term "associated with
industrial activity" is one that admits of degree. It's
like the word "minimized" -
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How do we -- how do we
avoid, under your reading -- assuming we agreed with you
what the rule says, that there is a difference between
logging roads and access roads? The other side raises a
lot of question about whether these, in fact, are access
roads or not. So do -- do we need to -
MR. BISHOP: The public -
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Do we have to reach that
issue then?
MR. BISHOP: The public -- no, you don't
have to reach that issue because the EPA has decided
that the timber harvesting activity is not industrial.
In the rule -- implementing this rule with a -- a
multisectored general permit for industrial activity,
EPA said, quote, "Harvesting activities, including
loading and initial transport from an active harvest
site, are not required to be covered under the
stormwater permits."
You know, it's been perfectly clear in -
when it promulgated the rule, it said that the reference
to SIC 24 was a reference to sawmills, planing mills,
and other mills. When, in the briefs in this case,
it -- it explained the reference to SIC 2411, it said,
"By not excluding SIC 2411, EPA intended to reference
only the four categories of silvicultural activities
already defined as point sources." So it's -- EPA has
been -
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So how do we -
MR. BISHOP: -- absolutely clear that timber
harvesting is not industrial activity -
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It may not -
MR. BISHOP: -- and, therefore, it does not
get to the "associated."
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It may not be, but these
are pipes, ditches, and channels which the CWA
explicitly defines as point sources -
MR. BISHOP: Well, you can -
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- that are not part of
the harvesting. By definition, they are not.
They're -- you're saying public roads and not access
roads.
MR. BISHOP: Well, remember that the
stormwater rule applies to point sources. The default
position under the stormwater rule is that point sources
do not require NPDES permits. And then Congress said
there are certain categories that do, and one of those
is discharges that are associated with industrial
activity.
EPA has said that, under these terms,
"associated with industrial activity," "in industrial
activity," neither the timber harvest nor the roads,
"The initial loading and initial transport from an
active harvest site are not required to be covered by
stormwater permits."
It says, in the rule, that immediate access
roads are the only things that are covered. It
explains, in the preamble to the 1976 rule, that that
means on-plant roads that are dedicated for use by an
industrial facility, not public roads. These are public
roads.
These are used by hunters, fishermen,
off-road vehicle enthusiasts, bird watchers. These are
fairly heavily trafficked public roads that are used for
a few weeks, every few decades, for logging activities.
And so these are not, EPA has been very clear, the sort
of -
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Am I correct or incorrect
that a considerable number of these roads are -- a
significant number of these roads were built initially
by the logging industry?
MR. BISHOP: Yes, some -- some of them
surely -- surely were.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: And it's a little hard for
you to say that, when these were built by the logging
industry and presumably maintained to some respect by
the logging industry, to say, oh, well, these are used
by hunters and so forth. I -
MR. BISHOP: But -- but they are public
roads. They are owned by the counties, or they're owned
by the State. These two particular roads that we are
talking about here have been there between 50 and 75
years. They run by the river. There is a school bus
pull-off on one of them because there are houses by the
side of this road.
There -- these are -- these are
quintessential public roads that are used by loggers
from time-to-time. Are they -- are they built there?
Are there other roads that are built by us? Yes. But
they are public roads maintained by us under contracts
with the State, only during the period when we are using
them for -- for logging activity, and otherwise
maintained by the -- by the State.
So the -- and we think -- to come back to
your -- your initial question, Chief Justice, about
whether this can be decided without getting into these
other complex issues -- that you don't have to -- if you
decide this case under the stormwater rule, it's -- and
taking at face value what the Ninth Circuit said, which
is the rule itself is not clear, we see the Ninth
Circuit set a reference here to SIC 2411, which is
logging.
We see this reference to immediate access
roads. So at -- at that point, we -- you look at what
EPA has said. And EPA's explanation, in its 1976
preamble, in its briefs and in -- in this case, are -
are absolutely clear, that there was no intention on
EPA's part to cover the channelled runoff alongside
these roads.
JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Bishop, could I -- I'm
sorry that I don't understand this well enough yet. But
can I understand what's still at stake for you in -- in
the case? Put aside the question of whether the new
rule is valid or not, all right? And what -- what do
you have riding on whether the Ninth Circuit's decision
is correct at this point?
MR. BISHOP: Well, if there is -- if there
is a vacatur, so that we don't have to worry about
remedies below -
JUSTICE KAGAN: So which remedies are you
worried about?
MR. BISHOP: Well, the remedies that we -
we are obviously not worried about injunctive relief.
We are worried about the relief that they have asked
for, for past -- supposed past violations, which is
penalties, attorneys' fees, and I think the more complex
one under the case law is remediation for environmental
harm, which the case law just doesn't seem to address
under -- under Laidlaw.
So we are worried about those. And
principally, what we would like to do is to get sorted
out, once and for all here, an argument that otherwise
would drag through the courts for the next five or six
years under this rule, putting the whole industry into a
good deal of uncertainty that we think is unwarranted.
If I can reserve the remainder of my time?
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
Mr. Stewart.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM L. STEWART,
FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,
IN SUPPORT OF PETITIONERS
MR. STEWART: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
On Friday, the EPA administrator signed a
new rule that amends EPA's existing regulatory
definition of the term "stormwater discharge associated
with industrial activity."
The new rulemaking specifically disapproves
the Ninth Circuit's decision in this case and states
explicitly that the only facilities under SIC Code 2411
that are industrial are rock crushing, gravel washing,
log sorting, and log storing.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Were you as
surprised, as we were, to learn about that final rule?
MR. STEWART: No, we were not.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: When did you learn
that the final rule would be issued on Friday?
MR. STEWART: I learned on Friday morning
that the final rule would be issued. I learned on
Friday afternoon that the final rule had been issued.
Within five minutes of that time, I alerted counsel for
both the Petitioners and -
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You had no idea
before Friday that this was coming out?
MR. STEWART: I knew that it was a strong
possibility -- I knew that it was a strong possibility
that it would come out. The EPA had issued a notice in
September of proposed rulemaking. There was a notation
on OMB's website in early November, to the effect that
the rule had been transmitted for final approval by OMB.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: In early November?
MR. STEWART: In early November.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Maybe in the future,
you could let us know when something as definite as that
comes.
There were 875 pages on the merits briefing
in this case, and if we knew that the final rule was
imminent, we could have rescheduled the case for April
or-- or something along those lines.
MR. STEWART: I'm sorry, Your Honor. We -
you know, we did explain in the opening brief that the
rule had been -
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Oh, I know, that
there was a proposed rule. Is it your experience that
proposed EPA rules become final within a couple of
months, particularly?
MR. STEWART: No, I think that -- well, I
think this happened more quickly than it usually does,
but I think we intended respect for the Court's
processes, rather than disrespect.
Obviously, it's suboptimal for the new rule
to be issued the Friday before oral argument; but it
would have been even worse, I think, from the standpoint
of the parties and the Court's decision-making processes
if the rule had been issued a week or two after the
Court heard oral argument.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, maybe. And it
would have been best if we had known about this in early
November.
MR. STEWART: With -- with respect to the
impact of the rule on this case, the new rule was not
intended to change the meaning of the preexisting
definition, and in our view, it renders the case moot.
And, really, the point of issuing the new -
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How do you deal with his
points about the ex-fact remedies of attorneys' fees and
remediation? Why are -- why are those moot?
MR. STEWART: Well, I think the question of
attorneys' fees, if the Ninth Circuit's decision was
vacated on the ground that the case would become moot,
attorneys' fee are available under the Clean Water Act
and citizen suits only to prevailing or substantially
prevailing parties. And I don't see any way that
Respondent could make a claim to be a prevailing or
substantially prevailing party when, at the end of the
day, it got no relief.
Now, with respect to questions of
remediation and, particularly, of civil penalties, the
Court, in Steel Company and Laidlaw, addressed the
circumstances under which civil penalties would -- could
and could not be awarded in citizen suits. And the
Court in Steel Company said that, in citizen suits, a
citizen plaintiff lacks standing to seek civil penalties
as a remedy for past violations because the citizen
derives no benefit from payment of the penalties into
the treasury.
In Laidlaw, the Court held that, where there
is a prospect of recurring violations or ongoing
violations, the citizen plaintiff does have standing to
seek civil penalties as a deterrent to future
illegality.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you -- are you
saying that the private companies would not be liable
for civil penalties, even though the alleged violation
was ongoing at the time of the district court
litigation?
MR. STEWART: That's correct. That even
if -- if, by the time the -- the suit was wound up,
there was no prospect of an ongoing or future violation
because EPA had amended the rule to make clear that the
conduct was lawful, there would be no future illegally
to deter. And then there -
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, can I stop you
just for a moment? EPA made clear that the conduct was
not unlawful. We have a new regulation. The fact that
they have issued a new regulation doesn't mean that the
reading -- doesn't mean that that's a demonstration that
the prior conduct under the old regulation was lawful.
Now, I know you've taken the position that
it was not, but you've got a court of appeals decision
saying it was.
MR. STEWART: That's correct. And if we
actually had a civil penalty award issued by the
district court in the first instance, it might be a more
complicated question whether that award should be
vacated. But the district court ruled in the
petitioner's favor. There was never any civil penalty
award.
And so if -- if the question is can the
district court, at some future stage of this case, enter
a civil penalty award, under Laidlaw, the only
justification for that in a citizen suit would be to
deter illegal conduct that might be thought to be
possible after the civil penalty award was issued and -
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That -- that would
have to be based on the assumption that the Ninth
Circuit decision was wrong.
MR. STEWART: It would not have to be based
on the assumption that the Ninth Circuit decision was
wrong at the time that it was entered; that is, even if
EPA had done something that was explicitly characterized
as a change in the law, if EPA had issued a rule-making
that said, what Petitioners had been doing was unlawful
up to this point, but we've decided that it shouldn't be
unlawful, and, therefore, we're amending the rule to
make it legal, if EPA had done that, there would still
be no prospect of future illegality, assuming that the
rule is taken to be valid.
And, therefore, although in an EPA
enforcement action, there might be a possibility of
getting monetary awards for past misconduct because
that's something the government can do, the citizen's
only stake in the matter would be to deter future
illegalities.
JUSTICE SCALIA: What if -- what if the rule
is held invalid? I mean, we don't know the answer to
that question until this rule is challenged, and there
is ultimately a -- I'm sure it will be challenged
because their position is that the -- this rule
contradicts the statute. So how does that factor in to
your analysis?
MR. STEWART: It certainly is possible that
the rule will be challenged, but, as -- as Petitioners
have emphasized in their brief, and we agree, the proper
forum for adjudicating challenges to the validity of an
EPA regulation is through a suit brought against EPA
based on the administrative record; that is, a citizen
suit against the petitioners -
JUSTICE SCALIA: I understand that, but my
point is, until that suit is -- is concluded, you don't
know whether there is a possibility of future violation
or not, do you?
MR. STEWART: You don't know. But I think,
at this point, the prospect that the EPA rule would be
both challenged and vacated is sufficiently speculative
that it would be out of keeping with general principles
of mootness for the Court to go on to decide the
question of what the old rule meant.
And really -
JUSTICE KAGAN: Is what you said true also
of the remediation piece of this? You said that, at
this point, even if we understand this as a change in
the law, the Plaintiffs would not be entitled to fines.
Would they also not be entitled to any kind of
remediation?
MR. STEWART: I -- I think we would want to
study that a little further. The general rule,
certainly, is that injunctive -- the propriety of
injunctive relief is determined on the basis of the law
in effect at the time of the Court's decision.
And under the -- the newly promulgated rule,
once the rule took effect, that -- that would be to the
effect that the discharges from stormwater runoff are
not covered, and an order requiring remediation would be
a form of prospective injunctive relief. It would
address -
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is it your submission that
we should issue an order vacating this moot or issue an
order for the court of appeals to consider whether it's
moot?
MR. STEWART: I think either one would be -
JUSTICE KENNEDY: What is your submission?
MR. STEWART: Our preference would be that
the Court issue an order vacating as moot; but it would
also be an appropriate decision to -- to leave that to
the court of appeals in the first instance.
And, again, EPA's objective in this was to
obviate the need to decide vex questions concerning the
meaning of the old rule. That is, EPA has said for
nearly 40 years that it doesn't believe that NPDES
permits are the appropriate way of addressing the -- the
dangers to water quality that are posed by these sorts
of discharges and -
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I -- I'm having
trouble seeing how we can dismiss it as moot when there
would remain pending claims for civil penalties and
injunctive relief, which you've already said you want to
take a closer look at, and attorneys' fees.
Now, you seem fairly confident that they'll
lose on those, but you felt pretty confident that you'd
win on this.
MR. STEWART: Well, I think the one piece
that we would want to take a closer look at is the
specific question of remediation for past harm; that is,
concrete steps on the ground to undo the results of past
discharges. The -- the other two pieces of it -
JUSTICE KAGAN: It seems strange that you
would -- that there would be an order of remediation to
undo the results of past discharges when, at this point,
the law going forward is, go ahead and discharge.
MR. STEWART: I think that's correct, that,
as I say, we haven't -- we haven't specifically focused
on this question; but my instinct is that an order of
remediation would be an aspect of prospective injunctive
relief that would be governed by the general rule that
injunctive relief is to be determined under the law at
the time of the Court's decisions.
But with respect to the other two elements
of relief, I think those can be easily dealt with as a
matter of law; that is, to the extent that they are
seeking an injunction ordering that no further
discharges occur without a permit, then clearly, the
propriety of that sort of injunction would be determined
under the new rule, and it wouldn't be available.
And I think Laidlaw is clear that the only
basis that a citizen has for seeking civil penalties is
to deter future violations, not to punish prior
violations.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is this something
that -- in terms of mootness, we should evaluate under
the voluntary cessation doctrine?
MR. STEWART: No, I don't believe so
because, here, the basis for mootness is not that the -
the defendants in the suit have promised to change their
ways; it is that the EPA has issued a new regulation to
make clear -
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The EPA has changed
its ways.
MR. STEWART: Well, EPA is -- EPA is not the
defendant in the case; so, even if this were viewed as a
change in ways, it wouldn't be voluntary cessation.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
Mr. Fisher.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L. FISHER
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. FISHER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
It seems to me, in light of the recent
events, that the most appropriate course for this Court
is to just simply dismiss this case as improvidently
granted.
If this Court had reached its -- had gotten
a cert petition under the circumstances present right
now, it seems to me there'd be three very strong reasons
simply just to deny the petition.
First of all, because EPA, in its rulemaking
on Friday afternoon, itself says that the Ninth Circuit
decision has -- cancels out any impact of the Ninth
Circuit decision on the ground, moving forward.
Second of all, the case is interlocutory in
posture. Remember, we are just on a reversal of a
motion to dismiss. So every argument that's left in the
case, in addition to whatever mootness arguments anyone
wants to make -- which I'll explain why in a moment we
would disagree with -- can all be made on remand to the
Ninth Circuit.
And if people are unhappy -- or not on
remand, but just simply when the case returns -- if
people are unhappy with those results, they can bring
the case back up to this Court. And -
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So if we do that -
if we dismiss as improvidently granted, you still go
back and you -- you get your attorneys' fees, you get
the civil penalties, you get remediation because the law
governing your case would be the existing Ninth Circuit
opinion.
MR. FISHER: Well, if that's where the case
ends up when it's over and they bring it back and you
deny cert -
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, the case is
not -
MR. FISHER: But there's a much -
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I was just going to
say the case is not going to be over if we dismiss.
MR. FISHER: No.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Because, as you just
said, it's interlocutory.
MR. FISHER: But that's my point, yes.
And -- but I want to make one thing very clear.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: But -- but, in other
words, it goes -- under your view, it would go back to
the district court; the district court would try all
this. And, as the Chief Justice says, we know what the
law of the case is, if -- if the opinion stands.
MR. FISHER: Well, the law of the case would
be -
JUSTICE KENNEDY: And -- and so isn't -
isn't it fairly clear, well, we know that the district
court must do under the court of appeals' decision?
MR. FISHER: All the district court must do
under the Ninth Circuit decision is consider this to be
a point source, for the reason that Justice Sotomayor
mentioned, and that -- the other side has virtually
walked away from that argument, anyway.
It is pipe, ditch, or channel; it's
perfectly obvious we're dealing with point sources here.
The only question is whether you have this covered by
the stormwater rules, to the extent they are valid. And
that -- the district court or the Ninth Circuit or
whoever would consider in the first instance, and that
could come back to this Court.
But if I might just explain to this Court, I
think it will help the conversation if I explain exactly
what our case looks like, going forward, because we have
and will maintain a claim for forward-looking relief for
two reasons.
One is, for the reason that was mentioned a
couple of times in the -- in the beginning part of the
argument, because we contend that the new rule simply
violates the statute. And we have a right to bring a
citizen suit for a violation of the Clean Water Act
itself, which is to say the language that requires EPA
to regulate -
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Is this a -
MR. FISHER: -- all discharges associated
with industrial activity.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So you're disclaiming
that you have to go to the court of appeals; you think
you can bring a citizen suit to challenge the validity
of the regulation?
MR. FISHER: Well, I wouldn't put it exactly
that way, Justice Sotomayor. What I would say is that
we have the power to bring -- or we have the right to
bring a citizen suit to enforce the Act. And if there
is a regulation that the other side brings up that says,
we are -- supposedly says, we are exempt from having to
get permits, our position is that regulation just simply
doesn't fall under 1369(b)(1), for the reasons Judge
Pryor just found for the Eleventh Circuit.
I sent that up as supplemental authority.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But we didn't -
MR. FISHER: It is, A -
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But that -- that is the
question, the question of what the statute requires, was
not decided below.
MR. FISHER: That's correct, Justice
Ginsburg. The Ninth Circuit had no -- no reason to
reach it because the regulations on stormwater, as then
written, were absolutely clear, that logging
activities -
JUSTICE GINSBURG: And you -- you're not
urging that we reach it?
MR. FISHER: I think the most prudent thing,
as I've said, is for this Court not to reach that, and
to let -- as you described, to let a lower court look at
it first and to bring it back.
But if I can finish my question -- or my
answer to Justice Sotomayor, the reason why that
regulation doesn't require us to go to court of appeals
in the first instance and actually lets us proceed on a
citizen suit is because the only two subsections of
1369(b)(1) that they have mentioned are subsections (E)
and (F).
Subsection (F) deals with EPA decisions,
quote, "issuing or denying a permit." Well, this
decision does neither of those things.
Secondly, it covers EPA actions that set
effluent levels or effluent limitations. And, again,
for the reasons the Eleventh Circuit just held and other
courts have held, this doesn't do that either.
So there is nothing in 1369(b)(1) that
stands in our way of bringing a citizen suit to enforce
the statute on those terms. So -
JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Fisher, why would you
proceed that way? It's at least arguable that you're
wrong on that. I mean, it's a -- it's a question as to
what 1369 does. And you obviously do have the route of
direct review. Why don't you proceed that way with
respect to the new regulation?
MR. FISHER: Well, I think that what -- what
we'll do is proceed whatever way we can because our -
you know, either -- either we are supposed to go
directly to the Ninth Circuit -- or any court of
appeals, or we are not. And if we are, then we will;
and if we're not supposed to go to the court of appeals,
as we believe a fair reading of the law -- I don't think
there is any plain text meaning of the law that could go
otherwise -- then we have -- the only way we can do this
is through a citizen suit.
JUSTICE KAGAN: Do you think that, on your
view of 1369, you can't go to the Ninth Circuit?
MR. FISHER: Exactly. And that's what the
Eleventh Circuit just held in a case just like this,
where there was a regulation at issue that exempted
certain discharges from the permitting program. And the
Eleventh Circuit said, case dismissed. You can't bring
this directly to us.
So we have an -- an ongoing claim for a
violation of the statute, which I can't imagine this
Court would want to address in the first instance.
We also, it's important to understand, have
a second claim. And before I describe that second
claim, let me describe overall -- just remind the Court
what exactly the case is about. The case isn't about,
as the other side has -- has portrayed many times, all
logging roads, all logging roads that may exist in the
world -- or the United States.
What the case is about are two very specific
kinds of logging roads: One, logging roads that drain
themselves by way of pipes, ditches, and channels, only
the small subset of logging roads that do that; and
second of all, only logging roads used -- being used for
active timber harvesting and hauling, not roads that
just happen to be sitting in the forest not being used,
but only the small subset of logging roads being used
for active timber cutting and harvesting.
JUSTICE SCALIA: What do you mean, "active"?
What does that mean?
MR. FISHER: It means under -
JUSTICE SCALIA: They -- they cut maybe,
what, every -- every 10 years? Is that active?
MR. FISHER: Well -- well -
JUSTICE SCALIA: What about the 9 years
in-between? Are they being actively used?
MR. FISHER: No, Justice Scalia. And so
under this -- the facts of this case, remember, we're on
a motion to dismiss, so when Mr. Bishop says 1 or 2
weeks out of whatever, we would like to have a record on
that because we don't think that's the reality.
But what -- what the case -- what we say in
our complaint is that they have a contract with the
State of Oregon to harvest particular areas and use
particular roads to access that timber and to take it
out. And the -- and the contract actually requires them
to use those roads and to maintain their drainage
systems.
And so our claim -- again, just to remind
you what our claim is under the statute -- is that that
harvesting activity can't be thought of in any other way
than industrial in nature and that these roads are
associated with that activity. They are designed for
that purpose, and they're indispensable to the activity.
Now, we have a second argument. Even if the
Court thought that we couldn't win -- or a -- whatever
court looks at this -- thought we couldn't win on the
statute, we have a Chevron Step II argument that we will
make and have every right to make because if -- and I'll
beg this Court's indulgence -- if -- this rule that they
have just announced on Friday afternoon is not as clear
as you might think.
So if you start with the language of the
rule, which is on page 18, what they have done is they
have amended -- they have amended the stormwater rules
to -- to provide that the only industrial activities
associated with logging are sawmills, which are covered
elsewhere, and then these four categories of things:
Rock crushing, gravel washing, log sorting, and log
storage. All -
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Excuse me. This is
page 18. That's -- that's the last page?
MR. FISHER: It's page 18, the last page
of -- at least, I'm -- I hope your copy is the same as
mine, but on the PDF that -- that was sent up to the
Court.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: And -- and so I'm reading
under where it says, "stormwater discharges"?
MR. FISHER: Yes. And if you go all the way
to the bottom, sub 2, "facilities classified under
SIC 24."
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Thank you.
MR. FISHER: And they list those four
things. And -- and then industry -- industry group 242
is the sawmills.
So they are saying those are the only
industrial activities that are associated with logging.
But that doesn't answer our claim. Our claim isn't that
logging roads themselves are industrial activities. Our
claim is that logging roads are associated with
industrial activities.
And so we still have a claim that, under
that -- even if those are the only four industrial
activities -- or, sorry, five, those four things plus
sawmills -- we still have a claim that logging roads
are, quote, "immediate access roads" to those
activities.
And the definition of "immediate access
roads," which is unchanged by the new regulation, is at
Pet. App. 40a -- the Ninth Circuit quoted it, and I
think it was described earlier by my friend -- "Roads
which are exclusively or primarily dedicated for the use
by the industrial facility."
So it's still a mystery to us how logging
roads are not primarily for use by even sawmills or
these other four things. And, indeed, if you look very
carefully at EPA's new regulation in the preamble, on
page 6, about two-thirds of the way down the middle of
the page, the only sentence here that EPA gives us, that
even suggests a possible response to the argument I just
described is the one that begins with the word "unlike."
They say, "Unlike immediate access roads
associated with industrial activities, many logging
roads" -- "many logging roads have multiple uses,
including recreation and general transportation, and
commonly extend over long distance, i.e., may not
provide immediate access to an industrial site."
So EPA is leaving open our argument. EPA is
saying, well, logging roads that are just generally
recreational, et cetera, are not immediate access roads.
But our claim -
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I thought -- I
thought -- I'm sorry. I thought they said that their
rules mooted this case.
MR. FISHER: Well, that's what they are
standing here today saying. But I'm telling you, on the
language that they gave us on Friday, it doesn't moot
the case. And I can't imagine an argument being made on
Monday, that hasn't been prepared in any written form,
based on a written thing that we got on Friday, that we
have an argument under, would moot our case.
And particularly, Mr. Chief Justice -- and
this is my point about going through all this -- I can't
imagine why this Court would want to touch all this in
the first instance, particularly without supplemental
briefing, but it seems to me to make every sense to let
the Ninth Circuit address our arguments first.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, if we -- if we
dismiss as improvidently granted, are you suggesting
that the Ninth Circuit would then be the -- be a court
to consider this?
MR. FISHER: Yes.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm -- I'm just
thinking if we vacate, perhaps another court will
consider it, but if we dismiss as improvidently granted,
the Ninth Circuit will, quite reasonably, think they are
done.
MR. FISHER: No, because we have a forward
look at the -- the first thing we'll tell the Ninth
Circuit is -
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I mean,
they're done -- they are done in terms of their
interpretation of the regulation and the applicable law.
MR. FISHER: I think only as to the
backward-looking regulation, but now, we have -- our
complaint -- you know, as a citizen suit does -
JUSTICE KENNEDY: But then -- but then
why -- why isn't your -- aren't your concerns met if we
vacate for the court of appeals to consider, in the
first instance, the extent to which this regulation may
bear on its opinion?
MR. FISHER: Well, I -- I think that gets
you very close to the same place, Justice Kennedy. I'm
just saying there is no reason to vacate because the
Ninth Circuit's point-source holding is so
self-evidently right, that I don't know why you'd go to
the trouble to do that. It makes the case simpler going
forward.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I think the -
the Ninth Circuit had the -- of course, EPA's views
before it. I don't know, if I'm the Ninth Circuit, why
I would reconsider my ruling, in light of this new
regulation.
MR. FISHER: Do you mean the
backward-looking ruling?
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I mean the ruling in
the -- the decision that they -
MR. FISHER: Right.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- issued that's
before us today.
MR. FISHER: Well, I don't know that they
would reconsider that -
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No.
MR. FISHER: -- but the -- but the main
event going forward is the new rule because the citizen
suit seeks cessation of ongoing violations of the Act,
and that remains the core of our lawsuit, which is
still seeking damages -
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But that's the -- but
that's the whole point, which is if you go back what's
the value of the backward-looking construction, if what
you're seeking is injunctive relief that has to be based
on the new rule?
MR. FISHER: It doesn't matter very much,
Justice Sotomayor. There is two ways in which it might
matter a little bit. One is, if we want to press a
claim for any kind of civil penalties or remediation,
the backward-looking thing would matter. We have to
decide whether we want to do that.
The second way it would matter would be it
would provide a helpful baseline for judging the new
rule in the totality of EPA action, which brings me to
my -- which brings me back to the argument I was
describing, which would be our Chevron Step II argument,
that EPA has simply either left this argument open -- I
still -- it is still a mystery to us what EPA thinks
about our real argument, which is that active hauling
logging roads, when they are being used for active
harvesting and hauling, are subject to the Act because
they are plainly associated with industrial activity.
And if EPA later on came out and said, no,
no, no, we mean to exclude that, too, then we
respectfully submit, EPA would still have a lot of
explaining to do.
First of all, we would very much wonder why
log sorting, log storage, gravel washing, and rock
crushing are industrial activities, but mechanized
timber harvesting with 20-ton pieces of machinery is
not.
We'd also wonder why this stuff isn't
industrial activity, where construction activity,
landfill operations, surface mining operations that have
all the same attributes of being done out in the field,
extraction of resources, heavy machinery, et cetera,
are, as the EPA itself admits, industrial activity; but,
somehow -- somehow, logging, which has all the same
attributes, isn't.
And so that's what our claim is going
forward. Now, I'm not asking this Court to address that
because I'm not sure this Court wants to get into all of
this stuff yet; but what I am telling this Court is,
there is no basis whatsoever to find this case is
moot -- or I don't think this Court would want to touch
any of the arguments being made here without further
briefing, at least as to the new rule.
We do think it's absolutely clear we are
dealing with point sources. We do think it's absolutely
clear, based on the language of -- of 1369(b)(1), that
there just can't be any way that there is a
jurisdictional, or whatever other kind of problem you
want to label it, with us bringing a claim based on the
statute itself. The new regulation just simply doesn't
fall into those.
So if this Court dismisses the case, we'll
go to the Ninth Circuit and tell them, we want to go
forward for -- for the following reasons. And if
anybody is unhappy with what happens in the Ninth
Circuit, obviously, we can file or they can file
petitions for -- for cert in this Court.
Let me just say one last thing to this Court
about what we view as really the arbitrary and
capricious nature of EPA's new rule and why you
shouldn't touch it.
Remember, I said -- and this is in EPA's
regulations themselves -- that construction activity -
any construction activity in a site five acres or more
is industrial activity.
So if a developer buys a parcel of forested
land and wants to build a subdivision there and the
first thing the developer does is punch in some roads
and drainage systems and cut some trees down to make
room for the houses, that is covered by the EPA's
stormwater rules; but, if a logging company does
precisely the same thing, EPA's position seems to be
it's not covered.
And not only is it not covered if it happens
on public land, but I think at least the implication of
my friend's position is that, for logging companies, of
which there are many in the northwest, that own their
own land -- own their own giant pieces of forest land,
and that are not open to the public, that are not open
to hunters, that are not open to recreation, but they
have their own logging roads on their own private lands
that nobody can use, but them, I still think his
position is that's not covered by the Act.
And finally, EPA has one other thing that I
want to point out to the Court about this new rule. And
it's, again, got our heads -- it gets our heads
scratching as to what EPA is really doing here.
EPA says twice in the preamble to their new
rule, once on page 7 and also on page 12, that it,
quote, "retains the authority to designate at least some
logging roads as covered by its so-called point -- Phase
II system."
What the Phase II system is, is under
Section 1342(p), which is the stormwater amendments to
the Act, it's the category of point source discharges
that EPA says are not a covered -- are not industrial
activity -- associated industrial activity, but we,
nonetheless, are going to require certain things of
them.
This is the critical point. EPA says this
twice. Well, the only authority EPA would have to
regulate any logging roads -- discharges from logging
roads, is if they are point sources because you don't
get into the Phase II program, you don't get into the
stormwater amendments, unless you have a point source.
If it's a non-point source, then, as my
friend has pointed out quite at length in his brief,
it's entirely up to the States, and EPA has -- has
nothing to say about it.
JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm looking at page 7, and
it doesn't say the authority to designate additional
roads. It says additional stormwater discharges.
MR. FISHER: Right.
JUSTICE SCALIA: That could be stormwater
discharges that have nothing to do with logging.
MR. FISHER: I think if that's all we had,
Justice Scalia, it might be a little bit ambiguous,
although, of course, this is in the context of logging
the roads.
But look at page 12. And this is the
final -- this is the very end of -- of the preamble.
The last sentence, "EPA believes that stormwater
discharges from forest roads, including logging roads,
should be evaluated under Section 402(p)(6)."
The only authority EPA has for -- for doing
that is if they -- if they are point sources; whereas
EPA has filed a brief in this case that says that they
are, at least some of them, are not. I don't know if
it's walking away from that or is planning on walking
away from that.
But, again, there is a variety of questions,
I think, that EPA should have to address and answer --
Did you have one? I'm sorry -- that EPA should have to
address and answer before any court does anything based
on this new rule.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But if you were
challenging the new rule, you would have EPA as your
adversary. The format of this case now is we have -- we
have Decker on one side and you on the other, and the
EPA is not in the lawsuit.
MR. FISHER: Well, EPA, of course, is an
amicus, Justice Ginsburg, and EPA has an ongoing right
to intervene in any citizen suit. That's a statutory
right. And there's a statutory notice that any
plaintiff in a citizen suit is required to provide to
EPA, which we did provide to EPA. And so EPA has every
right to intervene in the case at any point as a party.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Does that include a
right to intervene and dismiss the action?
MR. FISHER: Well, I think that EPA has a
right to intervene and make an argument that the case is
moot or any other substantive argument they would like
to make back in the Ninth Circuit. And of course,
mootness, if it's genuinely moot, which, for all of
these reasons, we think, of course, it's not, but
mootness is an Article III principle that an amicus
could raise, and a court would be bound to consider on
its own.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, they -- they are just
intervening. It's -- it's not like what happens in
the -- in the suits for fraud against the government,
where they take over the litigation.
MR. FISHER: Right.
JUSTICE SCALIA: They don't take it over.
They just intervene.
MR. FISHER: I think that's what would
happen. You could ask them how they would like to
proceed, but I assume that's how it would happen, and I
assume the defendants in the case would remain the same.
So I'm happy to answer any other questions
about what the case looks like or what you ought to do,
but otherwise, I'll submit it.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
Mr. Bishop, you have 4 minutes remaining.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF TIMOTHY S. BISHOP
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. BISHOP: Thank you.
We are not asking you to adjudicate the new
rule. I'm not sure why we are hearing all of this about
the -- the details of the new rule. What we are asking
you to do is to get rid of this case. In getting rid of
this case on the basis of the stormwater rule, it will
eliminate one of the arguments that the plaintiffs will
make in a -- in a challenge to the new rule. It will
simplify that challenge.
What it will do is to get rid of this case
and get rid of a Ninth Circuit opinion that really put
the court in a -- the position of overriding what EPA
has been saying consistently since 1976, consistent
position that collected forest road runoff is not point
source and, since 1980, that logging is not industrial
activity, and these roads are not associated with
industrial activity.
And for my clients, that is -- has a great
deal of -- of values, particularly since, as Mr. Fisher
has admitted, what he really wants here is to be back in
the Ninth Circuit seeking not only, apparently,
relief -- backward-looking relief, but also prospective
relief.
If there are no further questions, I'll
submit.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
