CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument

Indemnity.
Mr. Becker.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE M. BECKER
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. BECKER: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,
and may it please the Court:
Both parts of the question presented in this
case should be answered "yes." For a treble damage
civil RICO claim based on fraud, someone must rely on
the alleged misrepresentation, and that someone must be
the plaintiff. But that's the very nature of a fraud
claim. Plaintiffs here claim that they were injured by
reason of a RICO violation, the predicate acts of which
involved a scheme or artifice to defraud.
But no one in this case is arguing that a
civil RICO claim based on fraud can proceed without
someone relying. So some reliance is required; the only
question is who must rely? And we submit that the
natural answer is the plaintiff.
A plaintiff who hasn't relied to his
detriment on an alleged misrepresentation hasn't been
defrauded; he hasn't been injured by reason of a scheme
to defraud. Plaintiffs here haven't alleged that they
relied on any misrepresentation; they haven't even
alleged that they received a misrepresentation.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: So what about a case,
say, you've got organized crime wants to get rid of --
an organized crime enterprise wants to get rid of
rivals, so it makes misrepresentations about those
rivals to customers and suppliers, not to the -- to the
rival. So there was no -- there is no misrepresentation
made to the plaintiff but to the plaintiff's customers
and suppliers.
So on your theory, is there no RICO claim
because the misrepresentation was made to someone other
than the plaintiff?
MR. BECKER: Yes, that's correct, Justice
Ginsburg. There would be a criminal RICO prosecution
because, under the Neder case, we know that reliance,
justifiable reliance, and injury is not required.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But no civil case in
that -- in that situation?
MR. BECKER: That's correct, Justice
Ginsburg.
JUSTICE SCALIA: But that doesn't even
comport with common-law civil cases. I mean, for a long
time courts have allowed someone who's been euchred by a
competitor's misrepresentations to his customers. An
old New York case that was discussed in the briefs that
I used to teach in contracts class, where he told
somebody that the horse was no longer for sale and it
was still for sale, and the person who wanted to sell
the horse at the higher price should have -- to buy the
horse should have had a cause of action, even though the
representation was not made to him.
MR. BECKER: Justice Scalia, those cases as
well as the Rice versus Manley New York case, the cheese
buyer's case, similar situation, do exist, but they are
really tortious interference with business expectancy
cases. And we believe that the law makes that clear.
When RICO was enacted in 1970, the law even
in New York, as we point out in our reply brief, had
evolved to the extent where -- where there were some
references to fraud in those early cases in the 19th
century.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose in a tortious
interference case, the two tort -- there are two tort
feasors, and they communicate with each other by mail.
Is that a violation of the mail fraud statute?
MR. BECKER: It would be a violation of the
mail fraud statutes. But I will say, Justice Kennedy,
that the government's position here seeks to extend the
mail fraud statute far beyond what this Court did in
Neder. As a matter of fact, the government made the
exact same argument in Neder as it did to this Court,
and the Court --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: In my -- in my
hypothetical, there was no -- there was no reliance on
anything said. It was just used to facilitate the
scheme. And I assume the plaintiff could recover.
MR. BECKER: I think that in criminal mail
fraud, reliance is not required, Justice Kennedy. And
that's what the Neder Court held. But in doing so, it
looked to the common law and imposed a materiality
requirement. And the only reason that the Neder case
ruled that it's not required in criminal mail fraud is
because no one has to be injured; there does not have to
be a completed scheme.
Civil -- there is, of course, no private
right of action in mail fraud. And when we look to
whether or not someone has a civil claim under RICO
through the predicate act of mail fraud, we have to go
through 1964(c), the "injured by reason of" requirement.
As this Court found in Holmes, the common-law
requirement of proximate cause applies, we submit so
does the common-law element of reliance, justifiable
reliance, apply in a civil RICO case predicated on mail
fraud.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, isn't -- isn't the
difference that, in Holmes, it was the textual basis "by
reason of" through which the -- as we read it -- the
proximate cause standard was -- was brought into the
statute. Here, in fact, there -- there isn't any text,
it seems to me, that you can -- can rely on.
The fact of fraud itself doesn't do it
because the statute speaks in terms of an offense for
which an individual should be prosecuted. So it's
looking to the criminal rather than the civil model.
And isn't that the distinction, in effect, a textual
distinction, between Holmes as a means for importing
proximate cause and the statute in this case as a means
for importing first-party reliance?
MR. BECKER: Well, Justice Souter, of
course, in Holmes the Court was looking at the "injured
by reason of" language and looked to the Clayton Act and
looked to the Sherman Act before it, where Congress used
precisely the same language. Certainly RICO doesn't
have proximate cause in its text at all.
The reason -- the very reason that the
common law does apply when you are construing a mail
fraud predicate act through a civil RICO claim is
because Congress has not told us what "defraud" means.
It has not defined "scheme to defraud," and of course
that's --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Why hasn't it done so
simply or sufficiently done so by referring to the -- in
effect -- the criminal mail fraud violation?
MR. BECKER: Because in other cases where
this Court has looked at the same type of situation, the
Neder case, Field versus Mans, for example, where there
is not a definition of a term such as fraud, the Court
has looked to the common law to define that term.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but we didn't have --
I don't think we had in those cases the phrase that
occurs here. I think the phrase here is "could be
prosecuted or indicted" for something -- I think it was
prosecution -- which tends to narrow it down to the
criminal model, rather than allowing us to roam into the
civil field.
MR. BECKER: Except, Justice Souter, that
the -- the requirement that there need to be an
indictable offense is not enough to make out a civil
fraud because criminal law recognizes a -- an
uncompleted fraud, simply a scheme, where here, if
you're talking about a completed fraud, for someone to
be injured by reason of a fraud, it has to be completed
and someone has had to rely on it.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. Well, that means
that to that extent the criminal -- in effect -- the
criminal cause of action is narrowed down. It doesn't
follow from that that the statute contemplated adopting
a civil model regardless.
MR. BECKER: I -- we -- we believe it does.
If Your Honor will contrast the Salinas case with the
Beck versus Prupis case, we believe it's the similar --
JUSTICE SOUTER: You're going to have to
help me do that.
MR. BECKER: All right. I will. In the
Salinas case, which was a criminal RICO case, the Court
ruled that it was not necessary to have a wrongful overt
act in order to make out a criminal cause of action for
conspiracy under the RICO statute. And the reason was
because all you need is the agreement and any acts.
This was a situation where a sheriff
actually was the wrongdoer, but the deputy sheriff took
some innocent acts that were in furtherance of
conspiracy. The Court said that's conspiracy.
However, in the Beck versus Prupis case, the
Court said that for civil RICO cause of action based on
conspiracy, you need to look at the combination between
1964(c), the "injured by reason of" language, and the
actual statutory language. And since conspiracy is not
defined in the RICO statute, the Court looked to the
common law, and the common law requires that there needs
to be an unlawful overt act or tortious act in order to
make out a common-law cause of action for conspiracy.
And the Court ruled that that was necessary.
We think it's the exact same relationship
Salinas is to Beck as Neder is to this case.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, why --
JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why isn't it -- there is
reliance on their allegations by the county. The county
thinks that each bidder is putting in only one bid. So
the county has been deceived, and the plaintiff suffers
the effect of that deception. Why doesn't that qualify?
MR. BECKER: Because no representation has
been made to the plaintiff, and the plaintiff hasn't
relied on the misrepresentation that was made to the
county.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: But without the mail fraud
violation -- let's assume -- the tort would have been
unsuccessful. It would not have been complete.
MR. BECKER: Without the misrepresentation
to the county, Justice Kennedy?
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes. Yes. Let's assume
that. And it was directed at this class of persons and
it was relied upon by the county. It seems to me that
that's certainly sufficient under the -- it's a mail
fraud violation.
MR. BECKER: Well, I think this --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: I mean, refer to the mail
-- the civil RICO refers to whether it's a mail fraud
violation. You want to assume this additional reliance
requirement.
MR. BECKER: We think it's necessary, Your
Honor. The other aspect, of course, in the hypothetical
is that there needs to be some direct injury, and we
don't believe that a direct injury is presented here.
In order to -- in Anza and, of course,
before in Holmes, the Court set forth three basic
guidelines in order to determine whether there was
sufficient proximate cause to bring a cause of action
under civil RICO, and in Anza under mail fraud. We
don't think those three are enough in this kind of a
situation.
JUSTICE SOUTER: But isn't the problem with
your argument that if this isn't direct enough, there is
no injury at all? The county isn't hurt by this. The
county has got its rotational scheme basically to avoid
favoring particular bidders who appear in multiple
guises, but the county isn't getting hurt. So that if
it's not direct enough for -- for the Plaintiffs in this
case to sue, then nobody has a direct enough interest or
can show direct enough causation for RICO.
MR. BECKER: Well, Justice Souter, first, we
disagree that the rotational allocation is well pled
fact. As we pointed out in our reply brief toward the
last several pages and in footnote 7, the actual sale
and the bidding is nothing like the concept of
rotational allocations.
But putting that aside for a moment, the
county certainly could be a victim. First of all, the
county -- this is a violation of an administrative rule.
That's what is at the heart of this case, an alleged
violation. The county has made the rule possibly for
the purpose that Your Honor just articulated, although
there is nothing in the record to let us know that.
But what we do know is that these types of
rules exist for the benefit of the property owners, and
that's because the Illinois Supreme Court in -- the same
plaintiff brought a case challenging a very, very
similar rule.
JUSTICE SOUTER: But how could the property
owner be hurt if there is -- if we are dealing in a
situation here in -- in which the penalty is zero
percent, and everybody is bidding zero percent, then
this is a situation in which the property owner isn't
going to get hurt no matter who ends up with it.
MR. BECKER: Justice Souter, zero percent is
by no means guaranteed. That's only been the last three
years. In fact, in the 2000 case before the Illinois
Supreme Court --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but that's the --
that's the case here. So if your direct-injury
requirement, as you construe it, applies here, I think
we are still left with a situation in which on these
facts, nobody would be injured, because nobody -- or
nobody would be -- be able to prove injury by a
sufficient direct route to establish causation.
MR. BECKER: Including the bidders and the
Plaintiffs, Your Honor.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Yeah. Right.
MR. BECKER: Well, I think that they
certainly could not prove injury as a matter of proof.
The problem with that, of course, is in a RICO case it
takes five years to get there. And someone can artfully
plead -- use two words with no elaboration at all,
"rotational allocation."
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, but that's a
different point, the point that you made in your reply
brief, that maybe there isn't this rotational system,
and maybe they can't prove that they were -- that they
were injured; that they would have gotten a greater
share. But your case is about -- it doesn't matter even
if you -- you have to accept the allegations of their
complaint as true, even if everything they say in the
complaint is true, they have no claim. They have no
RICO claim.
MR. BECKER: That's correct, Justice
Ginsburg.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: So we have to assume what
they say about the rotational system is right and -- but
-- but you are hanging your hat on no misrepresentation
was made to them.
MR. BECKER: That's correct, Justice. We --
we are -- we have raised below, but not in this Court,
that there was not sufficient injury, directness of
injury; and it can't be proved in this Court. I think
it comes into play in the reliance concept under
proximate causation.
And what we are asking the Court to do is to
recognize that, in the context of a civil RICO claim
based on fraud, that there is -- there is nothing that
is -- that is revolutionary about finding that a
reliance requirement should be applied. This case, as
the Court knows, was originally dismissed by Chief Judge
Holderman on that very basis.
If we have -- if we were to accept -- if the
Court were to accept our opponents' position, a
remarkable array of lawsuits could be brought as RICO
actions: Competitor versus competitor for harm that
allegedly is caused by false statements to customers,
suppliers, distributors, marketing agencies, government
entities; consumer or end user versus manufacturer for
harm allegedly resulting from false statements to the
first buyer in a distribution chain.
And the circuit court cases in the Fifth --
Fourth and Fifth and Sixth and Eighth and Eleventh
circuits have recognized this, and they require reliance
as a part of proximate causation, and we believe this
Court should do the same.
I also wanted to make the point that to
elaborate, in the Neder case, the Government -- and this
is a case where the Government ostensibly argues that it
wants us not to restrict civil RICO claims. But in the
Neder case the Government made the very same argument in
trying to expand mail fraud claims under the criminal
statutes.
And I think that's -- that's a sub rosa
issue in this case. The Court nine years ago
specifically said in a unanimous opinion, with Chief
Justice Rehnquist writing for the Court, that the Court
disagreed that mail fraud was moored to the common law
of fraud, and it is not unmoored in the Neder case.
They said it was moored, and even in a criminal
prosecution materiality is required. And although
justifiable reliance and injury is not required in a
criminal prosecution, to unmoor the mail fraud statute
in a civil RICO context and to then make the argument
that all sorts of other claims can -- can also be
included such as tortious interference -- because at its
heart this is a tortious interference case. We know
that because the Plaintiffs pled it in their complaint.
That's their pendant State court action. And that's
where this case should be. It should be a tortious
interference case.
If they can prove that case and if they have
pled it, then they have a remedy. If they can't, they
don't. But the problem is that to give the civil RICO
tool, to call "racketeers" -- to call your competitor a
"racketeer" and to seek treble damages and attorney's
fees in this kind of such an attenuated situation,
should not be something that the Court condones.
And it's different; if you Google my
clients, you'll come up -- they will come up as
racketeers now, and -- and that's the problem that we
have. If there were a reliance requirement, you could
immediately tell if this was a situation where the
common law --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: May I just go back to a
statement you made? I thought you -- you conceded that
on their allegations your client would be indictable for
mail fraud?
MR. BECKER: Well, I didn't concede that my
client would be indictable for mail fraud. I think that
there would have to be -- we'd have to take a careful
look at the indictment, certainly. But I will say that
-- that I do -- I do say that the mail fraud statute
does not require justifiable reliance or injury.
I think the problem is when you ask the
direct -- my client hasn't been indicted for mail fraud,
and I don't think it's any -- it's any oversight because
this has been a very well known case in Cook County. I
think the reason, if one were to ask me why my client
hasn't been indicted for mail fraud, is because they
didn't commit it, because the county in its own rule --
the treasurer wrote the rule and expressly says in the
rule that she has the exclusive discretion to determine
whether or not there has been a violation of the rule.
She has not so determined. And this case has been
pending now for close to over three years. The
treasurer is aware of it, and we know that, and she
still has not determined that there has been a
violation. So if there hasn't been a violation of the
rule, there is no criminal mail fraud violation either.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Is your client still
bidding on -- on these --
MR. BECKER: Yes, Justice Souter, and also
all of the -- al of the plaintiffs -- the Respondents
are still bidding, which I think is an interesting fact.
And it's not -- it's in the record because they have an
amended complaint where they have pled subsequent sales.
That's how far afield from the law of fraud this is
going.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Are all the shell
corporations still bidding?
MR. BECKER: Mr. Justice -- Mr. Chief
Justice, if all of them aren't, it's simply because
there may be new corporations that are, and they are
formed not for the purpose of defrauding anybody, but
for tax purposes.
If there are no further questions, I'd --
I'd like to reserve the rest of my time for rebuttal.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,
Mr. Becker.
MR. BECKER: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. DeBruin.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID W. DeBRUIN
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. DeBRUIN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
It is presumed true in this case that
Petitioners submitted false affidavits, filled the
auction room with related entities, and obtained
thousands of liens that would have been awarded to
Respondents and other bidders, causing them injury in
fact. I submit the central issue in this case is
whether on those facts Respondents can establish
proximate cause, and specifically whether in order to do
so they must establish that they personally received and
relied upon the false statements at issue.
I submit that this Court already has
established in its decisions in Holmes and in Anza the
proper test for proximate cause. And no claim has been
made in this case, at least not until perhaps briefly
this morning, that the Respondents cannot establish
proximate cause under the standards set forth in those
cases. Moreover, no argument is made that the standards
articulated in Holmes and in Anza are insufficient to
ferret out the appropriate cases that can go forward;
that those cases produce anomalous results either here
or in any other case that has been decided.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is -- is it your view that
assume -- assuming there is a State law cause of action
for tortuous interference, that if that tortious
interference was effected through the use of the mails
by the co-tort features, that that automatically invokes
the RICO statute?
MR. DeBRUIN: Your Honor, all of the
elements of RICO would have to be established. There
would have to be predicate acts of mail fraud.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: That -- that there are
predicate acts, yes.
MR. DeBRUIN: And they would have to form a
pattern and all the other requirements that were
significant would have to be met, but yes.
And I submit in this case there is no
serious dispute but that the allegations over the course
of many years of the complaint established indictable
mail fraud. The issue is not whether the fact pattern
is under the common law tortious interference or some
other common-law tort.
The question is: Do the facts as alleged
make out indictable mail fraud? There is no question
but the mail fraud statute is broad. It prohibits any
scheme or artifice to defraud; and I believe that if the
facts here were proved, the submission of false
affidavits to the county on a regular basis, there is no
need under mail fraud to prove reliance.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But those -- those
weren't mailed, or at least that's not what you're
relying on. You're not relying on the affidavits that
make the misrepresentation using the mails. I thought
your reliance on the mails is only the tail end of this
transaction, the notices that get sent to the property
owners.
MR. DeBRUIN: That's correct, Justice
Ginsburg. The mails here are an essential component to
allow this fraud to have any effect. If it weren't for
the use of the mail, the Petitioners could never realize
the economic value of the liens that they obtained
through the fraud. And in that sense the use of the
mails are essential to the scheme. And that's what this
Court held in the Schmuck decision: That the mails,
themselves, don't have to be false so long as the use of
the mails is essential to the scheme.
Here it clearly is. Absent the notices
given to property owners, there would be no way for the
Petitioners to realize the value of the liens and obtain
the benefit of the fraud by -- by making the false
statements to the county and literally obtaining
thousands of additional liens that otherwise would have
gone to other entities.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, what --
would your position be different if the county were, in
fact, injured; we didn't have the zero-percent situation
but different percentages? Your client would not be
able to sue them, right?
MR. DeBRUIN: Mr. Chief Justice, I believe
the Court has already addressed that in Anza and has
made clear that if in an appropriate case the government
had been harmed and was in fact -- could be expected to
sue, as it was in Anza -- in that case the claim was
that the defendant had not paid its taxes to the State
of New York. And the Court found that New York was the
directly injured party, could be expected to sue, and
under Anza there was no proximate cause. We accept that
test.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, what does that
do to your statutory argument? In other words under
your statutory argument, you still could sue; but
because of other considerations you can't?
MR. DeBRUIN: Well, we have to establish
predicate acts of mail fraud, but we also have to
establish proximate cause. And under Anza the failure
was an inability to prove proximate cause. In this case
it has not been seriously disputed that we satisfy the
factors set forth in Anza. The county was not harmed.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, what happens
-- what happens if some of the bids were more than zero,
and some weren't? You get to sue for part of the
damages, and the county gets to sue for the rest? Or
how do you divvy that up?
MR. DeBRUIN: Well, the only time that the
affidavits and the representations in this case have
effect is if all the bids are zero. The county, in
order to protect itself from property owners, provides
that if there are multiple bids above zero, the county
will not issue the lien. It holds the lien itself.
The only time that this rule comes into
effect where there is a rotational award is if the
county is paid its taxes in full, and there are multiple
bidders at zero percent.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but I suppose
since we are talking about a rotational rule, you could
have -- what are these, monthly or annually -- one,
possibly, cycle where it's all zero percent, and then
others where it isn't, and then another where it is.
And that would affect the rotation in a way that would
injure your client but would also injure the county.
MR. DeBRUIN: Not the way the county
administers these auctions. If that happened -- and it
certainly could happen -- that the bidding process that
takes the penalty down stopped at five percent or two
percent, the county rules under the program at issue
provide the county will not apply the rotational system.
It won't award the lien at all.
The rotational rule only applies when there
are multiple, zero-percent bids. And Respondents will
show, as this case goes forward, that they can identify
the specific properties on which there were multiple
bids; that the Petitioners and the related entities,
which they will prove are related, received liens and
thereby increased to the thousands the number of
valuable liens that the Petitioners got, leaving the
Respondents essentially with hundreds of liens.
The key is, the central question is, whether
Petitioners can show proximate cause under the standards
in Holmes and Anza. And under Anza what this Court held
is the central question for proximate cause is the
directness between the violation alleged and the injury.
And in this case there is a direct relation between the
violation of mail fraud alleged, the predicate acts, and
the injury that Respondents have incurred.
JUSTICE ALITO: Would you explain why your
argument is consistent with Beck versus Prupis? In that
case, couldn't the plaintiff show that it was injured by
reason of the criminal violation that was alleged, the
RICO conspiracy; and, yet, the Court said something more
was required, taking an additional requirement from the
law of civil conspiracy? How is your argument here
consistent with that?
MR. DeBRUIN: Justice Alito, Beck was a
completely different case. The issue in Beck was --
section 1964(c) says that the plaintiff must prove
injury by reason of a violation of the act. And the
violation of the act at issue in Beck was 1962(d), which
is a conspiracy to violate the other provisions. And so
what the Court was looking at was the word "conspiracy,"
which was not defined in the statute. And the Court
applied the accepted rule that where a word is not
defined, the Court can assume that Congress intended its
ordinary meaning.
JUSTICE ALITO: But -- well, the meaning of
a RICO conspiracy in the criminal context is very well
known. I don't know why it matters whether it is
defined in the statute or not; and there is no
requirement in that that anybody be injured by virtue of
an unlawful, overt act.
MR. DeBRUIN: But the Court looked to --
JUSTICE ALITO: Why is it appropriate there
to look to the law of civil conspiracy and yet
inappropriate here to look to the law of civil fraud?
MR. DeBRUIN: Well, it looked to conspiracy
to make up the elements of the civil cause of action
there. But here the relevant provision that is relied
upon is 1962(c), which is a violation of RICO. And we
also alleged 16, 1962(c). But in (c) the violation of
RICO is to conduct the affairs of an enterprise through
a pattern of racketeering activity.
None of those words, "conducting the affairs
of an enterprise", are words that Petitioners contend
you look to the common law to define. There could be a
pattern of racketeering activity that would consist of
fraud, of violence, of bribery all together.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Am I -- am I reading these
provisions wrong? I thought you were proceeding in a
1961, and that the conspiracy -- the conspiracy
provision is 1962(c).
MR. DeBRUIN: 1961 is the definitions. We
allege a violation of both 1962(c) and 1962(d).
JUSTICE SCALIA: That's the conspiracy
provision.
MR. DeBRUIN: 1962(d) is the conspiracy. We
allege a violation of that. We also allege a violation
of 1962(c).
JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm looking on page 2 of
the Petitioner's brief. Have I -- have I been
misinformed?
The blue brief, page 2, maybe that's wrong,
but that's what it says. It says 1962(c), it shall be
unlawful for any person to conspire to violate any of
the provisions of subsections (a), (b) or (c).
MR. DeBRUIN: Your Honor, the citation
appears at the bottom of the quote, the way it's set
forth on page 2.
JUSTICE SCALIA: All right. I understand.
MR. DeBRUIN: So if you look at the very
first quotation, you'll see where it follows.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, I see, I see, I see.
Okay.
MR. DeBRUIN: So in this case, we allege
both a violation of 1962(c) and (d). 1962(c) prohibits
conducting the affairs of an enterprise through a
pattern of racketeering activity. That pattern may
consist of fraud, violence, bribery --
JUSTICE ALITO: No, I understand that, but
when the pattern of racketeering activity consists of
predicate acts of mail fraud, why isn't -- why does not
Beck point you to the word "fraud," which like
"conspiracy," I don't believe is defined in the RICO
statute? So why if you look to civil conspiracy to
understand what "conspiracy" means in the RICO statute,
why do you not look to "civil fraud" to find out what
the word "fraud" means in the RICO statute?
MR. DeBRUIN: I would say two things:
First, what that argument would do would make
essentially common-law fraud the predicate act under
RICO, when instead it is indictable mail fraud, not
common-law fraud. And --
JUSTICE ALITO: But you can say the same in
Beck. It would make civil conspiracy the predicate act
in RICO, rather than -- the RICO violation, rather than
criminal conspiracy.
MR. DeBRUIN: Well, the Court, again, in
Beck, was looking to the common-law word "conspiracy" to
apply it in different contexts. There is not a
common-law fraud that is actionable under RICO.
But secondly, even if you accept that test,
Justice Alito, under the common law of fraud, there is
no doubt that claims like ours were actionable and were
actionable as fraud. The case that Justice Scalia
referenced to, the common-law cases involving the buyer
of cheese and other facts, those were actionable as
fraud where --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Becker says they were
interference with a business relationship, not fraud.
MR. DeBRUIN: Well, under the law of torts
as it has evolved, there are different labels that are
applied. But what was critical is that that conduct,
the interference through fraud with a contract of
another, was actionable at the common law. The
plaintiff could make out a claim and recover damages,
even though the plaintiff had not received the statement
at issue and had not relied on the statement at issue.
So that even if, under RICO, you were to look for civil
purposes to a common-law analogue, the common law made
clear that these kinds of claims were actionable,
whatever label might be applied to them today in terms
of the nature of the -- of the tort.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: One concern, because RICO
can be a very broad statute, is that if you are right,
then any unsuccessful bidder could look through a
rival's submission, find a false statement, and sue
under RICO.
MR. DeBRUIN: Your Honor, I believe that is
not true for the reasons this Court set forth in Anza.
The standards set forth in Holmes and in Anza are very
rigorous tests to establish proximate cause. So the
merely assertion of falsity by a competitor -- I mean,
Anza involved a competitor situation. There the claim
was that had been mail fraud that caused the competitor
harm.
The Court recognized in Anza that that case
was different than Holmes. There was an allegation of a
direct injury in Anza, but nevertheless the relation
between the violation and the harm was far less direct
than it is in this case, as Judge Easterbrook, Chief
Judge Easterbrook explained.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Why -- why is it -- I
really worry about adopting a rule which would produce
the result that whenever anyone makes a false statement
in an official form, someone who is deprived of a
business opportunity, or at least can say so, can bring
a RICO action.
MR. DeBRUIN: Justice Scalia, I would say
two things: First of all, I think it's critical to
realize that Congress enacted RICO to protect
competitors. One of the principal motivations behind
RICO was to protect legitimate businesses that are
injured in their business or property by reason of a
pattern of racketeering activity as defined under the
statute. That's number one.
Number two, there are important restrictions
that this Court repeatedly has recognized. It's not
enough that there be a single act. There must be
predicate acts that are a pattern of activity.
"Pattern" doesn't just mean two. It means a continuing
threat of continuing criminal activity. There must be
proximate cause under Holmes and Anza. All of those
restrictions exist. And only if the plaintiff can
successfully navigate all of those things, proving not
common-law fraud but indictable criminal activity,
proving a pattern of continuing criminal activity,
proving proximate cause, only then can the plaintiff
make out a RICO violation.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I suppose that every
other bidder in this situation is a viable plaintiff.
MR. DeBRUIN: In this case, we don't submit
that we are the only potential plaintiffs. That there
were other bidders -- the bidders at these auctions fall
into perhaps two different categories. Many bidders --
over 50 percent of all the registered bidders receive
fewer than 10 liens. In other words, they are at the
auction to bid on a specific property or small number of
properties.
Then there are other what I would call
professional tax buyers, who basically do research,
identify the most attractive properties, and we will
show, are essentially bidding on the same group of
properties. And those are the properties at issue.
Those are the bidders at issue. It is more than just
the Respondents, but it is a relatively small group --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I suppose in
other cases where if we adopt the rule you argue for,
that wouldn't be confined at all. For example, in a
situation where a competitor is defrauding a supplier,
every competitor no matter how many there were, could
bring a RICO action.
MR. DeBRUIN: Well, I think the Court --
again, if you look to the Anza case, the Court has made
clear that if a RICO defendant takes actions that simply
enhance the defendant's own competitive position, which
was the allegation in Anza, that that may not be enough
to establish proximate cause. But whereas here the
foreseeable and clear effect of defendant's actions is
to work a direct injury on competitors and, in fact, on
no one else, not on the county, not on the property
owners, but only on competitors, that was within the
ambit of what Congress sought to protect in RICO.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Regardless of how
many competitors there are?
MR. DeBRUIN: Well, yes. As this Court
recognized in Storey Parchment and Hazeltine, in
antitrust cases as well as RICO cases, damage issues
have to be worked out. But the fact that there may be
multiple bidders that you may have to award damages to a
group does not defeat the claim. The defendant cannot
come into court and say because damages here have to be
allocated among a larger number of people, you can't
establish a claim.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is it the law generally in
the States that an unsuccessful bidder can sue the
successful bidder if the successful bidder misstated
qualification?
MR. DeBRUIN: Justice Kennedy, the
common-law rule actually was, I believe, in 27 of 40
States -- this unfortunately came up after the
briefing -- that a disappointed bidder could bring an
action at the common law if the allegation was one of
fraud in the procurement. So that the common law did
not provide an absolute bar to claims like this.
Now, again, the issue is: Will the claims
satisfy Holmes and Anza? There is no argument here that
that standard, the framework this Court established
first in Holmes and then applied in Anza, that that
framework is inadequate, that it produces an anomalous
result here or will produce an anomalous result in other
cases. It's a very rigorous test.
This Court looked at directness; it looked
to the suitability of other plaintiffs; it looked to
whether the harm was derivative. That's a
quintessential proximate cause analysis. Proximate
cause is, historically through the common law, a very
fact-based intensive test. But the Court has made clear
that the ability of the RICO plaintiff to overcome that
test, it's a significant showing that must be met.
Chief Judge Easterbrook, in this case, went
through the Anza factors very methodically. He showed
that, under each factor, proximate cause clearly can be
met under the common law. The Respondents were directly
injured in a significant and substantial way, and that
is sufficient, I submit, to make out the elements of the
RICO claim, assuming all the other elements are also
met.
If there are no further questions, thank
you.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,
Mr. DeBruin.
Mr. Miller?
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC D. MILLER
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. MILLER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
RICO provides a cause of action to
plaintiffs who have suffered injuries by reason of, that
is, proximately caused by, a RICO violation. Now, when
the RICO violation is predicated on an act of mail
fraud, the plaintiff ordinarily will need to show that
somebody relied on the false statements in order to
establish that the fraud was even a "but for" cause of
injury.
A plaintiff who can establish that it was
the one who relied on the false statements would be able
to show proximate causation. But that's not the only
way to establish proximate causation, and there is no
basis for this -- for the imposition of a per se rule
requiring that the plaintiff be the one who has relied.
Instead when a defendant creates a scheme to defraud
that induces reliance by one party in order to injure
another party, the injured party should have a cause of
action under --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What is the answer
to Justice Kennedy's question with respect to Federal
Government contracts?
MR. MILLER: My understanding is that the
case has established that they can. Again, since this
came up after the briefing, one illustrative example is
in the Eighth Circuit, Iconco against Jensen
Construction Company, which is 622 F.2d 1291. In that
case, it was a contract that was set aside for small
businesses, and the company got the contract by falsely
claiming to be a small business. And then in a
diversity case applying Iowa law, the Eighth Circuit
held that the disappointed bidder could bring an action
for fraud and unjust enrichment against the successful
bidder. So I think that -- and that's of a piece with
the long common-law tradition, going back to cases like
Rice against Manley, where --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But what if there
are 50 disappointed bidders?
MR. MILLER: Well, it would be the burden of
the plaintiff to establish that, but for the fraud, it
would have gotten the contract. So in most cases of
contracting, that's going to be very difficult for a
plaintiff to show. This --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Wait.
MR. MILLER: -- is somewhat usual.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Why couldn't you show --
why couldn't -- that's like the situation where a
company runs a -- runs a lottery and in fact
misrepresents what the odds are. And then you mean the
people can't recover because they couldn't show that
they would have won? It seems to me you can calculate
the difference in the odds or something and place some
value on that. Is it really painless to say, you know,
I'm running a lottery and your chances of winning are
one in a thousand, and everybody buys a ticket on that
basis, and it turns out that really your chances are one
in a million? Nobody has a cause of action because
nobody can prove he would have won?
MR. MILLER: No, the participants in the
lottery in that case would have a cause of action
because they have paid money to the person running the
lottery.
JUSTICE SCALIA: That's all they can get?
Just what they paid for the ticket?
MR. MILLER: I think -- I think the -- the
common-law measure of damages would be -- would be what
they paid in that situation. But certainly the recovery
for disappointed bidders in cases like this, does have a
long common-law tradition, and with the more modern
elaboration of tort law, as demonstrated by the
secondary statement, it has sometimes been given a
different label, and that is either "injurious
falsehood" or "intentional interference with a
prospective contractual relation," but at its heart, the
action that's at issue here is one that's for fraud.
But I would like to say in response to some
of Justice Alito's questions that, with respect to the
Beck case and the relevance of it, that ultimately in
our view it doesn't really matter whether the common law
would have allowed recovery in this case, and that's
because, unlike in Beck where the Court had to consider
what is the meaning of -- what does it mean to be
injured by reason of a conspiracy? And the Court
answered that question by looking at the common law of
civil conspiracy. That mode of analysis would be
appropriate here if the relevant predicate under 1961
were fraud or any conduct involving fraud or otherwise
made reference to common-law fraud. But, of course,
1961 does not say that; it says "any act which is
indictable under section 1341," the mail fraud statute.
So under -- given the structure of the statute, the only
inquiry is: Is the injury incurred by reason of an act
which is indictable under 1341?
JUSTICE ALITO: But the RICO statute doesn't
say you can recover if you're injured by reason of
conspiracy, without any elaboration. It says "by reason
of a violation of this statute." And therefore you look
to 1962(d), which tells you what the violation is. It's
a RICO -- it's a criminal RICO conspiracy. So I just
don't see how that argument works.
MR. MILLER: Well, 1964(c) refers you, as
you noted, to 1962, which simply says "conspiracy." And
so the Court in Beck explained that to figure out how
you tell when someone has been injured by civil
conspiracy, there is a body of law, the common law, that
answers that question. There is no corresponding
common-law principle of what it means to be injured by
an act of mail fraud because there is no common law of
mail fraud per se; it's a statutory creation. And so
the relevant inquiry is simply: Did the conduct violate
the mail fraud statute, section 1341? Not was it common
law fraud?
JUSTICE BREYER: Well, I don't think it's
because there's no common-law equivalent. I think it's
simply because the word "conspiracy" is a -- the
substantive violation under 19 -- under 1962(c). "It
shall be unlawful for any person to conspire." And we
have to interpret the word "conspire," and we say we
give it its common-law meaning; whereas, for a violation
of the general racketeering statute, there's -- there's
no equivalent reference to a word that we have to give
content to. It just says -- unless it's the word
"indictable."
MR. MILLER: No. I think that's right. And
certainly the "by reason of" requirement in 1964, it
does refer to the common-law requirements of proximate
cause. But that -- that language -- "by reason of" --
does not contain a reliance requirement because it
applies to any number of predicate acts, all of the
predicate acts under 1961. And in the context of many
of those acts, reliance would be completely
inappropriate. I would also like to point out that I
think the conduct that is alleged here really does go to
the core of what RICO is intended to redress. Congress
made clear, in the finding that accompanied the statute,
that one of its principal concerns was that criminal
enterprises could use illegal means to compete unfairly
with legitimate businesses. And so if a business -- a
criminal business were to use threats of violence
directed at its competitor's customers to get them to
switch their business to it, the competitor would have a
cause of action for that. And then the same should be
true, we submit, if the business uses fraud directed at
its competitor's customers to induce them to switch
their business.
If there are no further questions.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,
Mr. Miller.
Mr. Becker, 10 minutes remaining.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE M. BECKER
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. BECKER: Thank you.
The difference between this case and what
Congress intended is that, yes, in the comments to the
enactment of RICO, Congress did say that it was trying
to protect legitimate competitors from illegitimate
conduct or unlawful conduct. This case has now morphed
into a situation where competitors are using RICO as an
anticompetitive device, and that's what we believe the
reliance requirement will -- will at least rein in,
totally consistent with the common law.
We are not asking this Court to impose any
requirement on RICO that does not already exist by
reason of the common-law meaning rule. Actually, we
believe our opponents and the S.G. are asking this
Court to expand RICO by unmooring it from the common
law. We believe that Beck versus Prubis is exactly the
same situation and the same analysis. Although 1962(d),
which is a substantive conspiracy violation of RICO, was
at issue in Beck versus Prupis, you get to the same
situation just as an extra step. Here's the -- here's
the analysis. You look to 19 -- they have a conspiracy
count of course. But you look to 1962(c), and it says
that "any person injured by reason of" -- if you read in
1964(c) to it -- by reason of a RICO violation or a --
or a racketeering activity "shall have a cause of
action."
Now, you look to racketeering activity in
1961, and that has a hundred and something predicate
acts, one of which is mail fraud. You look at mail
fraud, and it says "a scheme to defraud." It uses the
word "defraud." What does that mean? It's the same
place; you just -- you just need to take one more step
to get there, but it's the same place the Court found
itself, we submit, in Beck versus Prupis. If criminal
conspiracy means the same thing as civil conspiracy,
Beck versus Prupis would not -- the Court would not have
held what it did in Beck versus Prupis. And if mail
fraud only means an indictable offense and nothing more
under the criminal law, it should be the same as the
civil law, then there would be no common-law meaning
rule. To apply the common-law --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Isn't -- isn't the weakness
of the argument that you're, in effect, dividing mail
and fraud? You're saying there are two requirements,
and therefore, fraud here is just like conspiracy in
Beck. But in fact, mail fraud is -- is a single term of
art. It refers simply to a criminal violation for which
there -- there is no exact civil counterpart. And so,
if you take mail fraud as being a unified term of art,
then it seems to me that your argument falls apart,
because you can't treat the fraud in the mail fraud the
way you treated the conspiracy standing alone in Beck.
MR. BECKER: Justice Souter, we respectfully
disagree and refer the Court to Field versus Mans, where
it was bankruptcy fraud. And I believe -- the exact
same thing. What does bankruptcy mean? What does mail
fraud mean? Well, they looked to -- the Court looked to
the common law meaning rule, and looked to the elements
you need for fraud in order to determine what has to be
proved for bankruptcy fraud.
JUSTICE SOUTER: But there was no definition
of bankruptcy fraud as a separate definition, was there?
Whereas in mail fraud, we know what it means.
MR. BECKER: Not from the statute we don't,
Justice Souter. There is no definition of mail fraud in
the statute. The only reason we know what it means is
because the Court has construed it over the years. In
order to construe it now in a civil context, we are
asking the Court to apply the common law meaning rule
because that's -- the analog is fraud; that's the
obvious source to look to the common law.
If I may I'd like to make a few other
points.
First of all, I cannot leave this podium and
leave this Court under the impression that there is
directness of injury. There are 195 bidders. The
plaintiffs themselves alleged this in paragraph 46, our
joint appendix 20 and 21. Without belaboring it, the
last few pages of our reply brief show all of the things
that would have to be shown in order to have even --
even a remote directness of injury in this case.
So the -- we have not -- we have not in any
way conceded that the requirements of Anza or Holmes
have been met. And -- but I think our brief adequately
deals with that.
I'd also like to point out that RICO and
mail fraud don't reach everything actionable at common
law. I mean, if there was an argument, that would mean
that civil RICO in every case involving a false
statement -- every case involving a false statement, no
matter to whom it's made, would be a civil RICO case.
The general idea of protecting competitors
doesn't mean that Congress provided that anything that
anyone says to anybody violates civil RICO. That's not
the way that this Court interprets statutes; and there
is no allegation in the complaint at all as -- that the
rotational basis applies only when bids are at zero
percent.
In the year 2000 the Illinois Supreme Court
confronted the same plaintiff in this case, Phoenix
Bond, challenging a very similar rule because at that
point in time there was collusion including the same
plaintiff to keep the penalty rate at 18 percent. And
the Illinois Supreme Court said the rule will -- is
something that the treasurer has the right to make to
try to regulate the bids, and the treasurer certainly
can be a victim of this situation. If the bid is not
perceived as fair, the treasurer will not have enough
bidders in order to sell all the bids, and therefore,
the county will not be paid the unpaid taxes.
If the treasurer thought that there really
was a misrepresentation here made by the Petitioners,
the treasurer would have a very great incentive and a
very great state in enforcing this rule; and the
treasurer did not, we believe because the treasurer
doesn't believe there is any violation.
The -- the other ways that the county could
be injured are that if the -- if the penalty rate goes
up beyond zero percent, there is no guarantee that the
same number of bidders will -- will come to the sale.
There -- I also want to refer the Court to
other -- this is not new. In Safeco Insurance just
recently, last term, the Court asked -- was asked to
define the term "willfulness" in a civil liability
provision of the Fair Credit Reporting Act, and the
Court observed that there is different meanings in the
civil and criminal law to the term "willfulness." In
Farmer versus Brennan the Court recognized different
uses of the term "recklessness" in the civil and
criminal contexts.
So once again we are asking this Court to
rule consistent with the common law meaning rule that
the -- a civil RICO action predicated on mail fraud,
where one is -- it has to fulfill the requirement that
you have been -- the plaintiff has been injured by
reason of mail fraud or racketeering activity. The
plaintiff must rely on a misrepresentation or the fraud
directly, because that's the essence of civil fraud.
If there are no further questions.
