NAJERA: Thank you. Mr. Chief Justice, and\nmay it please the Court:\nPetitioner comes before the Court asking one\nthing and one thing only, that the State of California be\nbound by its decrees and its laws that have guided it\nthroughout the history of California, that the State and\nthe Federal Government be bound by the laws of the land\nthat have been in place essentially since the State's\nfoundation.\nSince early on in this country's history, Chief\nJustice Marshall looked at a matter similar and said it\nwould be repugnant to the genius of our laws to allow the\nprosecution to continue after the statute of limitations\nhad expired.\nSuch has been the law that only a few times in\nthe history of this Nation has any State had the\ntrepidation to attempt to revive an expired cause of\naction in a criminal matter. In each such instance, the\nStates have been -- the State has not been permitted to do\nso. In each such instance, such as in State v. Sneed,\nMoore v. State, and other such cases --\nQUESTION: Were those State law cases and State\nconstitutional cases?\nMR. NAJERA: They were, Your Honor. And --\nhowever, as I said, in Adams v. Wood, it involved a\nFederal matter and it involved a matter that we might\nconsider equally repugnant. It had to do with the\nprosecution of an individual who was involved in the slave\ntrade and laws that prohibited that. However, the attempt\nto punish that occurred after the statute had run, and Mr.\nChief Justice Marshall indicated in that particular case\nthat even if the case had been treason, it could not be\nprosecuted, for under the Federal law, treason was only\nprosecutable for a 3-year period.\nQUESTION: Did he base his decision, the one\nthat you're referring to, on the Ex Post Facto Clause?\nMR. NAJERA: No, Your Honor. He based it on the\nlaw that the statute of limitations in that case, the\nFederal law had in fact called for an expiration of the\ncause of action, and the Court there decided that, no, it\ncould not be prosecuted. But no, he did not decide it on\nthe ex post facto basis, Your Honor.\nAs the Court knows, we raise two issues here,\nthe Ex Post Facto Clause and the Due Process Clause, and I\nwould like to point out that the two clauses, while they\nboth deal with arbitrariness and unfairness, are not\ncoextensive and that similarly, in addressing the matter,\nneither is petitioner's claim as to each, for under the Ex\nPost Facto Clause, we are not looking at to whether or not\nrights have vested. Such is not a concern of the Court\nfor ex post facto concerns.\nHowever, in this particular case, Mr. Stogner\nhas been vested with a right. The State of California has\ngiven him a substantive right, a defense that is neither\nwaivable nor forfeitable.\nQUESTION: We've said in Graham against Connor\nthat if a provision of the Constitution speaks directly to\na subject matter, such as I think the Ex Post Facto Clause\ndoes to your case here, then we don't go to substantive\ndue process. We analyze it just under that provision.\nMR. NAJERA: That is correct, Your Honor.\nHowever, as I indicated, the two claims are -- are not\nnecessarily coextensive, and I would like to point the\nCourt out to the case of Sacramento v. Lewis. There, the\nCourt may recall, involved a high-speed chase. The police\nwere after individuals on a motorcycle. The motorcycle\ncrashed. There was in that case no Fourth Amendment claim\nbecause no seizure had occurred of the person prior to the\ncrash taking place. The Court, nevertheless, was able to\nanalyze that case under the substantive due process\nprinciples because it fell outside of the Fourth\nAmendment.\nHere we clearly believe that the case falls well\nwithin the -- the Ex Post Facto Clause. However, should\nthe Court decide otherwise, it strikes me that it should\nnot render this Court impotent to examine the matter as a\nsubstantive due process. It seems --\nQUESTION: That -- that would render the rule\nquite pointless. I mean, the rule is if it is analyzable\nunder -- under a very specific provision of the\nConstitution and is not valid under that one, you then\ndon't move on to analyze it under another one. And -- but\nyou're saying unless you win under the narrow one, it's\nnot over. If you lose under the narrow one, you then can\ngo on to the Due Process Clause.\nMR. NAJERA: Well --\nQUESTION: That doesn't make it much of a --\nmuch of a safeguard, it seems to me.\nMR. NAJERA: Well, Justice Scalia, as I've\nindicated, the causes are not -- are not absolutely\ncoextensive. We have in this case a vested right. The\nState of California has guaranteed to the petitioner the\nright that he be free from prosecution, the right that he\nbe free from conviction, and the right that he be free\nfrom punishment. This is vested to him under State law.\nAs such, that can be analyzed, whether or not the Court\ndeems it sufficient, under the Ex Post Facto Clause. As\nthe Court said in Weaver, we are not concerned under the\nEx Post Facto Clause with vested rights. That's not\nnecessary for analysis under the Ex Post Facto Clause. It\nis an additional factor that the Court certainly should\nand, we urge, must consider under the Due Process Clause.\nIf I may continue, analyzing the matter first\nunder the Ex Post Facto Clause, I think the first question\nperhaps that should be addressed is whether or not this is\na rule of evidence and whether or not it falls within\nCalder four.\nState of California has defined it. It is a rule of\nevidence because it is required of any finder of fact,\nwhether it be a judge sitting pretrial examining the\nmatter as a demurrer or in analyzing the matter as\nsufficiency of evidence under Penal Code 995.\nQUESTION: But it doesn't -- it doesn't go to\nthe kind of evidence necessary to prove the substantive\noffense certainly.\nMR. NAJERA: Yes. I -- I would beg to differ,\nYour Honor. And the reason is, is California has injected\nthe statute of limitations into every offense in which it\napplies. In such cases it becomes a material ingredient\nof the offense, and in such cases the prosecution is\nbarred if that material ingredient is not proven by the\nprosecution. And if the matter should proceed to trial, a\njury must acquit if the prosecution is not able to\novercome its burden in that particular case.\nQUESTION: But that -- that simply says there is\nanother substantive element there. It doesn't say what\nrule of evidence you follow to decide how that was made\nout.\nMR. NAJERA: It does, Your Honor, in this\nrespect. If the evidence comes before a jury, for\nexample, and the evidence shows that the prosecution is\nbarred, that no public offense is stated, the jury must\nacquit. It is a rule that guides the jurors, as much as\nit would guide a court, in deciding what must be done with\nthe particular facts. If the facts before the court show\nthat the case is barred, then the prosecution cannot\ncontinue. The jurors must acquit. It -- it would seem to\nme to be one of the most clear rules of evidence and\napplicable throughout, not just to California and not just\nto the Federal Government --\nQUESTION: Suppose you have a -- a case in which\nthe statute of limitations has not yet expired, and the\nlegislature then extends it. And it's during the extended\nperiod that the prosecution has brought it. Is there an\nex post facto violation there?\nMR. NAJERA: I believe not, Your Honor, and the\nreason I believe not is that what is promised by the\nstatute of limitations is not any particular number of\nyears. Rather, what is promised --\nQUESTION: And how does that fit in with the\ndescription you just gave of -- about the evidence?\nMR. NAJERA: Because the evidence that must be\nshown by the prosecution is that the case has not been\nbarred. That does not depend on any particular number of\nyears. It depends --\nQUESTION: Well, but that's the ultimate\nconclusion they gave.\nbarred or it isn't. We have to find the answer to that\nbefore we know whether there's evidence. I -- I just -- I\njust don't understand your theory.\nMR. NAJERA: The case is barred only when the\nstatute has run. One can liken it to a conditional\npromise.\nQUESTION: But why isn't any evidence in -- in\none case or the other in the hypothetical I put?\nMR. NAJERA: Because the evidence of -- of an\nextended statute of limitations doesn't go to whether or\nnot the case is barred. The evidence is still the same.\nThe case has not yet run.\nQUESTION: Except it does if you're -- if you're\nright on your theory.\nMR. NAJERA: I am right on my theory because the\n-- the State is in fact barred from proceeding, and the\nevidence that would come before the --\nQUESTION: Let me ask you another question on\nthe ex post facto lawsuit. Suppose the State has a\nsavings clause and it reserves to itself the right to\nextend any statute of limitations. What result there if\nthe State then extends the statute?\nMR. NAJERA: I believe if there is --\nQUESTION: And this was -- and then this in\neffect at the time the crime was committed, this general\npower in the State to extend.\nMR. NAJERA: I believe if the State has reserved\nthe right to extend a statute of limitations before the\nstatute has expired, then there is no ex post facto\nproblem. I believe that the problem occurs --\nQUESTION: Well, then you're not arguing for\nvery much here. The -- the States -- all the States can\njust pass this statute and -- and that's the end of this\ncase.\nMR. NAJERA: Well, it's not the end of this\nparticular case because the statute has, in fact, run.\nCertainly a State is permitted to set statute of\nlimitations, decide the terms and conditions thereof, and\ngo forward in the future under such a premise. In this --\nQUESTION: What -- what if a State says we\nreserve the right to dispense with any of the elements of\n-- of crime that are on our books? I mean, it announces\nthat. We reserve the right in the future to dispense with\n-- retroactively with any of the elements of the crimes\nthat we have defined in our -- in our code. You wouldn't\nsay that's okay, would you?\nMR. NAJERA: No, I would not, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Why is this any different? I -- I\ndon't know. If it violates the Ex Post Facto Clause, I\ncan't see how the State can get around it by announcing in\nadvance that it's going to -- to violate the Ex Post Facto\nClause. How does that make it okay?\nMR. NAJERA: Because the Ex Post Facto Clause\nviolation only occurs when the offense is deemed no more,\nand that only occurs when it runs. So if the case hasn't\nrun yet -- or the statute has not run yet, we are in a\ncompletely different posture. No -- in California --\nQUESTION: But it has run. The State announces\nit in advance. Then the statute runs, and the State says,\nhey, we told you. We told you beforehand that even after\nthe statutes run, we're going to be able to get you. And\nI thought you said that's okay.\nMR. NAJERA: It's okay in the statute of\nlimitations context because there they have reserved that\nsituation that allows them to say the public offense still\ncontinues in this particular situation. What we have here\nis an absolute rule that says once run, not only can no\npunishment be had, not only can no conviction be had, but\nnot even a prosecution can be maintained. There is no\noffense once the statute has run.\nQUESTION: But you're saying a State could have\nno statutes of limitations.\nMR. NAJERA: Yes, and -- and the States have\nclearly done that in certain instances such as in the case\nof murder.\nsuch a particular case.\nQUESTION: And you have no trouble with\nprospective application of either saying we're not going\nto have any statute of limitations for this crime or\nprospectively the time is going to be longer. You're only\ntalking about the retrospective.\nMR. NAJERA: That is correct, Your Honor. It is\nin its retrospective aspect that we run into problems\nbecause the State has clearly said there is no offense\nanymore. It is gone. It is dead. It has been\nterminated.\nQUESTION: And for the -- the -- you were being\nasked before about the difference between extending a\nlimitation that has not yet expired and reviving a dead\ncase, and for that there's -- there was a very nice\nstatement of the difference between the two by Judge\nLearned Hand. I thought in response to Justice Kennedy's\nquestion, you would come back with that.\nMR. NAJERA: That is correct, Your Honor. It is\nclear as -- as His Honor Judge Learned Hand, that we're\nnot offended in the same manner before the crime has\nexpired when we extend the matter --\nQUESTION: That -- that was the footnote in the\nFalter case?\nMR. NAJERA:\nQUESTION: Footnote 26 or something?\nNow, that has never been approved by this Court.\nHave -- have various circuit courts approved of that?\nMR. NAJERA: Various circuit courts have -- as I\nrecall, have spoken of it. Some have objected to such\nlanguage recently such as the -- the Brechtel case. But\nevery State court that has looked at the matter, not just\nin California, has said you cannot maintain such an action\nonce it has expired. That's clearly been the law\nthroughout.\nAnd it -- it is important to note that this type\nof precedent, this history has been throughout the -- the\nhistory of the United States. We have cases extending\nearly on, State v. Sneed, a case that was cited, I might\nnote, in the Kring opinion that was overruled by this\nCourt. But nevertheless, it was cited there for the\nproposition that -- that a statute of limitations, once\nrun, did in fact cause ex post facto violations.\nQUESTION: Well, whatever the Federal stopper, I\n-- I gather that this Court must have assumed there's such\na distinction when it was dealing with Fifth Amendment\nclaims and it said, once the statute of limitations has\nexpired, you can't plead the Fifth.\nMR. NAJERA: That's absolutely correct, Your\nHonor. And State opinions are, of course, in accord. And\nit is striking to note that as late as 1993 in a case in\nCalifornia called Blackburn, an accused in a civil matter\nattempted to rely on the Fifth Amendment in order to avoid\nquestions concerning child molestation. And the court\nthere said, well, you haven't made a sufficient showing,\nand the reason being? Because the statute of limitations\nessentially replaces the Fifth Amendment.\nAnd I would note in that regard, in California\nin particular, that the statute of limitations has been\nviewed as such a powerful matter that it's been likened\nnot only to the Fifth Amendment, but it has been likened\nto the Fourth Amendment in that it prevents unlawful\nseizures of a person. It has been likened to the Double\nJeopardy Clause in that one cannot prosecute a person\nagain once the statute of limitations has run.\nAnd so this statute of limitations is not a\nmatter of minimal import.\nQUESTION: Well, the California Supreme Court,\nin announcing under State law, didn't give it that\nfundamental sweep at all.\nMR. NAJERA: It -- it had --\nQUESTION: We're bound by what -- how California\ncharacterizes its own statute I assume.\nMR. NAJERA: To some extent, yes, and to some\nextent, no, because in ex post facto analysis, it is this\nCourt that looks at State law and it's this Court that\nmakes a determination whether or not it violates ex post\nfacto regardless of what label a State may give it in\nparticular. That principle was announced in -- in\nLindsey, and it certainly was reaffirmed in -- in Carmell.\nQUESTION: But we -- we have to -- we have to\ntake the State law as we -- as we find it. I mean, if the\nSupreme Court of California says a law meant one thing, we\ndon't come in and say it meant another. We can say you've\nchanged the law and therefore it's ex post facto, but we\ndon't decide for ourselves over the -- overruling a State\ncourt what that particular law said at a particular time.\nMR. NAJERA: Well, the Court looks at -- at the\nsubstance of the matter I believe. The Court looks at\nwhether or not the law violates the Ex Post Facto Clause,\nand it would seem to me that simply changing labels would\nbe an easy way for a State to get around the Ex Post Facto\nClause. As the Court said, as early as Cummings, it's a\nmatter of substance, not a matter of form.\nAnd California, throughout its history, up until\nFrazer granted, had always considered statute of\nlimitations to be matters of substance. They were not\nsimply remedial matters or not simply procedural matters.\nThey were matters of substance and they were matters of\nrights for the defendant or the person accused.\nQUESTION: Your -- your claim doesn't fit very\ncomfortably under any of the four Calder v. Bull factors,\nor categories I should say, of ex post facto violations.\nYou're trying to shoehorn it under the rule of evidence\ncategory, number four?\nMR. NAJERA: Whether -- Your Honor, whether\ncomfortable or not, I believe it fits, and I believe that\nit fits within each of the four categories, not only\nbecause of the nature of the Ex Post Facto Clause, but\nbecause of the multifaceted nature of the statute of\nlimitations at issue here.\nFor example, if we look at Calder category\nthree, which deals with punishments and the laws that are\nannexed to the punishment, in the case of Lynce, which I\nbelieve was authored by Your Honor, in that case what was\nat stake was not what the State had defined as the\npunishment per se, the number of years. What was at stake\nthere was that the State itself had granted credits,\novercrowding credits. They did not even intend to -- to\ngive a benefit to the defendant there. And yet it fell\nwithin Calder three because the punishment had been\nreduced by laws that were annexed to the crime, the laws\ndealing with the overcrowding.\nAnd in that way, one can say if the Court\nrejects the principle that this is a material ingredient\nof the offense itself, as California has defined it,\ncertainly as a matter of punishment, it is a law that's\nannexed to that punishment and says, after a certain\nperiod of time, no punishment shall be had.\nAnd that's quite clear under California law\nbecause it is not a waivable right. In other words, a\nperson can go ahead and proceed to trial or go ahead and\nplead guilty and be languishing in prison and suffering\nthe punishment and years later discover that he has a\nstatute of limitation right and assert it then and\npunishment shall be had no more. He must be released.\nAnd so in that way I do believe it fits within Calder\ncategory --\nQUESTION: That -- that's the law in California,\nwhat you just said, that even though you never raise it as\na -- as an issue in your trial, and you're in -- you're in\nprison, many years later you could then come in and under\nCalifornia law if it -- if the statute had run, you would\nbe released?\nMR. NAJERA: That is correct, Your Honor. That\n-- that has been held over and over in California since\nits early days and reaffirmed in particular in the McGee\ncase which was seminal in California and which defined it\nnot just merely as a matter of defense, not just merely as\na -- as a right of the defendant, but also as a matter of\njurisdiction for the court. And in that case, they made\nit very clear that since no offense could be stated, no\njurisdiction could be had by the court.\nQUESTION: Then -- then what was the effect of\nthe Frazer case?\nMR. NAJERA: Well, the Frazer case certainly\ntried to redefine the history, I believe, of -- of the\nCalifornia law. And I might note, of course, that it\ndealt with a subsequent statute of limitations enacted\nwell after the statute of limitations applicable to\npetitioner in this case and reinforced by 805.5 in 1985.\nQUESTION: So did the Frazer case overrule some\nof this California doctrine on statute of limitations that\nyou've just told us about?\nMR. NAJERA: It certainly overruled cases such\nas Sobiek which had held that, in fact, this was a\nviolation of the Ex Post Facto Clause. While calling it a\nmatter of legislative grace, they did not touch cases such\nas Zamora which occurred in 1976, the same year that the\nstatute of limitations would have expired here, that\nreaffirmed that this was in fact a substantive right.\nAnd I might note that even while using the\nlanguage legislative grace, this Court in Weaver said even\nif good-time credits are given as a matter of legislative\ngrace, it does not bar application of ex post facto, and\nso such credits cannot be taken away, even though they had\nnot, in that particular case, been earned.\nQUESTION: Mr. Najera, could -- could you\nexplain to me -- I -- I understand your argument that this\nfalls within the fourth category of Calder because you\nhave to produce more evidence under the -- or I'm sorry --\nless evidence. It alters the amount of evidence necessary\nfor conviction. Before the statute, you -- you had to\nshow that the crime was committed by an earlier date and\nafter this, you don't have to show it was committed by\nthat earlier date.\nBut if that's the case, what I don't understand\nis why it makes any difference whether this increase -- or\ndecrease in the amount of evidence necessary to convict\noccurs before or after the old statute of limitations has\nrun. In either event, it -- it amounts to a decrease in\nthe amount of evidence necessary to convict.\nMR. NAJERA: Well, there's certainly an argument\nthat can be made, and -- and I know that amicus has -- has\nin a footnote addressed that.\nMy -- my belief is that what must be shown is\nnot a particular number of years per se, because that can\nbe altered I believe. What must be shown by the evidence\nbefore the -- before a court is that because the number of\nyears requisite of the statute of limitation has in fact\npassed, therefore the case is no more. So, yes, one does\nconsider the number of years, but the number of years only\nmatter as to whether or not the statute has, in fact, run\nin that particular case.\nQUESTION: Well, I hear you but I -- I don't --\nI don't really --\nQUESTION: I suppose you could also say that\neven though literally it would apply to both situations,\nthere's a longstanding tradition of not applying it in the\ncase where the statute has not run, and so you would\nconstrue that exception rather narrowly.\nMR. NAJERA: That is correct. The State of\nCalifornia throughout has told all of its citizens you no\nlonger need to keep your guard up because the statute has\nrun. If you have evidence, you don't have to preserve it.\nIf you have letters that might be of some support in your\ncase, you don't have to maintain them. If you have\nwitnesses, you no longer need to know where they are or --\nor how to get a hold of them. And that only --\nQUESTION: Am I correct -- just so I get your\nview on it -- am I correct that with respect to an\nunexpired statute of limitations where there's an attempt\nby the legislature to extend it, the law is really very\nwell settled that that's permissible?\nMR. NAJERA:\nCalifornia because in the same year that the Sobiek case\nwas decided, in which the court said it is a violation of\nex post facto to revive an expired cause of action, in\nthat same year they decided People v. Snipe, which was an\nextension case. The statute had not yet run, and the\ncourt there had no problem saying there is no ex post\nfacto problem there.\nIf -- if I might continue, and I would like to\nattempt to address all -- all the relevant categories.\nTurning to category number two, for example,\nthere we deal with a situation in which a crime is\naggravated or enlarged and the opposition says, well, this\nonly deals with punishment. Well, in one respect all\nCalder categories deal with -- ultimately with punishment.\nNevertheless, it is a situation that is simply not\nredundant to the other categories. It is a category unto\nitself. And -- and even though there does not appear to\nbe a great deal of case law on the point, one must still\nask the question, when is a -- when is a case aggravated\nin a fashion that doesn't merely mirror one of the other\nCalder categories, and I believe it's when the\njurisdiction is increased, when persons who fall outside\nof the statute become ensnared in it.\nAnd if I might, unless there is an additional\nquestion, at this point I would like to reserve the\nremaining time.\nQUESTION: Very well, Mr. Najera.\nMs. Gaard, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JANET GAARD\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMS. GAARD: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please\nthe Court:\nBased on new evidence that children who have\nbeen sexually abused often delay reporting the crimes for\nsubstantial periods of time, the California legislature\nextended the statute of limitations for the most serious\nof these offenses and it expressly made the law\nretroactive. This law does not violate the Ex Post Facto\nClause or the Due Process Clause.\nTurning first to ex post facto, this law does\nnot criminalize conduct that was innocent when it was\ndone.\nQUESTION: Before you go through the four\ncategories, might I just ask this general question? What\nif the defendant had been pardoned, would it be an -- an\nex post facto violation to -- for the legislature to say\nwe're going to now make it subject to prosecution?\nMS. GAARD: No, Your Honor, it would not violate\nthe Ex Post Facto Clause.\nQUESTION: And why not?\nMS. GAARD: Because what we're looking at with\nthose four categories is what the law was in effect at the\ntime the crime was committed, whether or not it was an\ninnocent act that was later criminalized. A pardon has no\neffect on the -- whether or not the act was innocent at\nthe time it was committed. So I would say that is like an\nex -- a statute of limitations, that there would not be a\nchange in the ex post facto.\nQUESTION: I'm sorry. I really didn't\nunderstand. You say that the pardon would be treated\ndifferently than the statute of limitations.\nMS. GAARD: No. It would be treated the same\nfor ex post facto purposes.\nQUESTION: Oh, it would be treated the same.\nMS. GAARD: Yes.\nQUESTION: And what about a general amnesty for,\nsay, illegal aliens coming into the country and then\nCongress passes a statute saying we will forgive the crime\nand you cannot be prosecuted? The same analysis there\ntoo?\nMS. GAARD: With an amnesty, I don't -- I\nbelieve it would be the same with the ex post facto.\nThere may be some separation of powers issues. There may\nbe double jeopardy issues, and there may be due process\nissues.\nQUESTION: Well, why would those issues be\ndifferent in that situation than in this situation?\nMS. GAARD: I believe that they actually would\nbe very similar, but it would depend. I think sometimes\namnesties are conditional or some --\nQUESTION: No. Unconditional in my hypothesis.\nMS. GAARD: An unconditional?\nQUESTION: Just like a pardon but a legislative\ndecision.\nMS. GAARD: Then what you would look to would be\ndue process there, which you also can look to with an ex\npost facto change.\nQUESTION: Then why can't we look to due process\nin this case?\nMS. GAARD: I don't think that you look to\nsubstantive due process. I believe that what was\nexpressed earlier is when we have an explicit textual\nsource of protection, which we have here, you don't look\nto substantive due process. The protection comes by way\nof procedural due process.\nQUESTION: But that would be the same for the\npardon and the amnesty.\nMS. GAARD: Yes, I believe it would be, Your\nHonor.\nQUESTION:\nYou started out by saying these are very troublesome kinds\nof cases. But the argument that you're making, I take it,\nis across the board.\nMS. GAARD: Yes.\nQUESTION: Doesn't -- it could be -- it could be\npickpocketing and -- and the argument would be the same.\nMS. GAARD: Without violating the Ex Post Facto\nClause --\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMS. GAARD: -- yes.\nAnd the Ex Post Facto Clause has been\ninterpreted in terms of the four Calder categories. What\nI'd like to do is -- is focus primarily on categories one\nand four which this Court has said are mirror images of\neach other.\nThe first category prevents the State from\nmaking an act that was innocent when it was committed\ncriminal at a later time. It provides fair warning so\nthat citizens are able to assess whether or not to engage\nin certain conduct. And it's related to guilt or\ninnocence. The statute of limitations has no relation to\nguilt or innocence. It's a defense that's raised that\nsays whether or not the defendant committed the crime, the\nState is not going to be able to prosecute.\nAnd when you look at whether or not the crime\nexisted, what you look at is the definition of the crime\nas set forth by the elements. And I would refer the Court\nto the Frazer opinion, footnote 22, where the California\nSupreme Court has said, whatever its nature for various\nState law purposes, the statute of limitations is not an\nelement of the offense insofar as the definition of\ncriminal conduct occur.\nThe California Supreme Court has said that the\ncrime that's at issue in this case is set forth in Penal\nCode section 288, and the statute of limitations has no\nrelation to that.\nInterplaying with the category one is category\nfour.\nQUESTION: May I ask you before you get to four?\nMay I ask you just to spend a -- a moment on something\nthat -- that hasn't been the focus of much? And that is\ncategory two that -- that refers to ex post facto as\nsomething that makes greater or more serious a -- a crime\nthat was previously defined.\nIt seems to me that there are two sort of\nindexes of seriousness in a crime. One is the -- the\npenalty in the strict sense that is -- is provided for it,\nbut another index seems to me, the period of time after\nits commission that a person who committed it is liable to\nbe prosecuted. That is a judgment about seriousness. And\nthat judgment is being changed here. Why doesn't it\noffend the second category?\nMS. GAARD: I believe when you're talking about\nincreasing the punishment, what -- what the -- the cases\nhave looked at is the punishment that exists at the time\nof the crime. And it really is the actual punishment\nwhether or not the term of a punishment is 1 year or it's\n20 years, and I don't think that there's authority --\nQUESTION: But -- but that isn't exactly the\nterm that at least that -- that Calder used. I mean, it\n-- it -- Calder states -- I'm -- I'm looking at the\nquotation on page -- page 6 of the -- 8, rather, of the --\nthe Government's brief. It -- it refers to every law that\naggravates a crime or makes it greater than it was when\ncommitted. And it seems to me that the -- that the\naggravation greater concept isn't necessarily limited to\nthe index of punishment, and it -- it could refer to the\n-- to the index of seriousness that -- that exists in the\nperiod of liability to prosecution.\nMS. GAARD: The second Calder category, if we\nlook back at the historical basis for that, comes from the\ncreation of a new punishment that wasn't in effect at the\ntime.\nQUESTION: Well, that just replicates the third.\nQUESTION: Yes.\nQUESTION: That makes it totally redundant.\nMS. GAARD: Well, I -- I don't think so because\nthe second one was, for example, where the new punishment\nthat was imposed was banishment which didn't exist at the\ntime as a penalty for the prescribed crime. The third one\nis the increase in the punishment. But creating a new\npunishment, I don't think that holding a defendant liable\nfor a longer period of time is the type of punishment that\nthis Court has looked at when it has applied those cases.\nWhat we're looking at is the purposes of the Ex\nPost Facto Clause, which is to provide fair warning so\nthat he knows whether or not he should commit the crime.\nQUESTION: Well, the same -- that's here. Isn't\nthat here?\nMS. GAARD: Excuse me?\nQUESTION: I mean, isn't that present here, at\nleast in respect to the evidence? I mean, a person as --\nas -- for example, this particular defendant you would\nlike to prosecute, among other things, for crimes that\nwere committed in your view 43 years before the present --\nbefore the time of indictment and 22 years anyway since\nthe statute of limitations expired. It's quite possible\nthat during that time people would have thought that they\ndidn't have to keep records, that they didn't have to keep\nall the evidence, that they might not have to defend\nthemselves. And of course, there's something to be said\non the other side, but also memories can be revived\nthrough hypnosis. Is this such a case?\nMS. GAARD: This is not such a case, and in\nfact, the California --\nQUESTION: Yes, all right. So -- so then I --\nbut -- but there -- they could be, and sometimes those are\ninaccurate. So people feel that they are free not to keep\nthe evidence after 22 years.\nNow --\nMS. GAARD: If you're --\nQUESTION: -- what I'm -- I'm trying to trigger\nyour reaction as to some of these fairly obvious points as\nto --\nMS. GAARD: I guess you have -- you have touched\non a couple of things. First is repose and second is\npotential for prejudice. And the potential for prejudice\nexists because of the passage of time, not necessarily\nbecause of the retroactive change. So the fact that the\nevidence may be somewhat stale is a function of the mere\npassage of time, and as the Court is aware, there -- the\nState could impose no statute of limitations so we could\nhave a case that was 40 years out and that would be the\nsame issue. But in terms of --\nQUESTION:\ncourse, is that -- that in Calder v. Bull, the Justice\nsays, all these and similar laws are manifestly unjust and\noppressive. And some of the purposes here, particularly\nthe ones on evidence and so forth, seem to be about the\nkinds of things you're talking about.\nMS. GAARD: The Court has said, and similar, but\nthis Court has repeatedly held, most recently in Carmell\nin 2000, that the four Calder categories are the outside\nparameters, and that a law, to be ex post facto, needs to\nfall within one-fourth of -- one of those four.\nAnd in terms of the prejudice, there is\nprotection --\nQUESTION: But the Calder category in -- in\nCarmell, the opinion of the Court said that category\ncovers instances where the Government refuses after the\nfact to play by its own rules, altering them in a way that\nis advantageous only to the State to facilitate an easier\nconviction. If that was the Court's most recent\ndescription of the fourth category, this case would seem\nto fit in it.\nMS. GAARD: But I believe what the Court said\nthere was that what was impermissible or unfair was\nundermining a presumption of -- of innocence, and that's\nnot relative when you have a statute of limitations.\nInnocence is of no import.\nSo what the Court said was in Calder category\none, you cannot change the elements of the crime\nretroactively, and in Calder category four, it said you\ncan't change what the prosecution has to prove with\nrespect to those four -- or those elements. So you can't\nchange the presumption of innocence, which the Court spoke\nto in the Cummings case, and you can't lower the\nsufficiency of the evidence required to prove the elements\nof the crime, which is what the Court was saying in\nCalder.\nAnd in fact, if you find that changing this\nwould -- would implicate the fourth Calder category, then\nyou may want to look at Gut v. Minnesota where the Court\nheld that a change in a venue did not implicate any of the\nfour Calder categories. And if you were to change venue,\nthat would also change the fourth Calder category which\nthis would.\nAnd also --\nQUESTION: May -- may I ask you this -- this\nquestion? Obviously, the -- you know, the -- we're\nengaged in kind of a definition of what the categories\nmean, as well as an analysis of what you have. Would you\nagree that if we do not fit this case within one of the\nCalder categories, that -- and -- and we accept your\nposition, that we will have to overrule Hale and -- and\nHenkel, the -- the case holding that -- that in fact, the\n-- the Fifth Amendment cannot be pleaded once the -- once\nthe statute has expired?\nMS. GAARD: No. I think what that would be is\nso long as the statute of limitations has expired and not\nbeen revived, that there is no present threat of\nprosecution --\nQUESTION: Oh, in other words, the -- one could\nbe required to present evidence against himself and then\nthe next morning the State could say, hey, we've had a\ngreat idea. We're going to extend the statute of\neliminations -- the statute of limitations and prosecute\nyou for what you just admitted to under the authority of\nHale and Henkel. Is -- is that your position?\nMS. GAARD: Yes, but I think that you would have\nto suppress that statement because it would be unfair.\nThat would be an act of misleading by the State to say you\nwould have to -- to testify and then we're going to use it\nagainst you. So as we said, we don't believe this fits\nwithin the -- one of the four Calder categories, but the\nprotections come by way of -- or the procedural component\nof the Due Process Clause, that if in fact there has been\nactual prejudice, the -- the defendant may raise that as\nhe may in any instance where there is a pretrial delay,\nand then the court will weigh that versus the reasons for\nthe delay, which is the test that this Court --\nQUESTION: Would -- would that -- and I -- and I\nthink this is your position. That would equally be true\nif the statute is extended before it has expired.\nMS. GAARD: Yes, it would be. Whenever there's\npretrial delay, you use the test that the Court enunciated\nin Marion and reiterated in Lovasco, and that's where we\nbelieve the protections come here. This case is before\nthe Court on a demurrer. There has been no allegation by\nthe defendant that he's been prejudiced in any way in his\nability to present a defense.\nQUESTION: But your strongest argument against\nJustice Souter's initial point, which I thought was --\nthat the word aggravated -- every law that aggravates a\ncrime, treating that as a kind of catchall where, in fact,\nit isn't literally within the other three, but from the\npoint of view of purposes, it's the same. The argument\nagainst treating that aggravating a crime as a kind of\ncatchall is?\nMS. GAARD: I don't think that that was the\nintent at the time that this was --\nQUESTION: And the evidence that it wasn't the\nintent?\nMS. GAARD: If we look at the historical basis\nfor this, it was the creation of a --\nQUESTION: It -- it was the banishment matter.\nMS. GAARD: It was the creation --\nQUESTION: But you could treat the banishment\nthat they were referring -- that one thing or that they\nwere treating it as a catchall.\nMS. GAARD: Yes. It was the creation of a new\npunishment. I don't think they had -- that it was meant\nto be a catchall, and this Court has never interpreted it\nto be a catchall.\nQUESTION: One way or the other, or has it said\nit isn't?\nMS. GAARD: It has not said it is not, as far as\nI'm aware.\nQUESTION: Thank you.\nMS. GAARD: And I think that Justice Kennedy\nmentioned about the extensions, and one of the things that\nyou need to look at is when you're -- you're deciding\nwhether or not an extension of the statute of limitations\nthat isn't applied retroactively violates the Ex Post\nFacto Clause, we look to a defense that existed at the\ntime the act was committed. And if he had a 3-year\nstatute of limitations at the time the act was committed,\nyou would be changing the evidence, if you followed his\ntheory, from 3 years to an extended period, whether or not\nit was an extension or a revival.\nSo we don't think that that would work, and this\nCourt would actually have to overrule a long line of cases\nsaying that extensions are also permissible. And the --\nthe Federal district -- or courts of appeals, several of\nthem have spoken about the fact that the statute of\nlimitations is not the type of element that we're looking\nfor to determine whether or not there has been a change in\nthe --\nQUESTION: My other case -- I don't know --\nquite know how the statute of limitations works in the\ncriminal area. In the civil area, you can very easily\nwaive the statute of limitations if you don't plead it at\nthe right time or if you make a counterclaim based on the\nsame facts, et cetera. In -- in the criminal system, are\nstatute of limitations routinely held waived?\nMS. GAARD: In this --\nQUESTION: Or -- or on the other hand, after the\nfact and a prisoner could say I forgot there's a statute\nof limitations here and -- and bring collateral attack?\nMS. GAARD: May I answer?\nQUESTION: Yes, briefly.\nMS. GAARD: In California, the defendant has the\nright to a pretrial hearing on the statute of limitations,\nand if the court finds that the statute of limitations'\nexceptions have not been met, the defendant gets a\ndismissal. If it goes to trial, the court makes a\ndetermination -- or the jury makes a determination. They\nfirst find guilt or not guilt, and then they make findings\nby a preponderance of the evidence --\nQUESTION: Thank you, Ms. Gaard.\nWe'll hear now from Mr. Gornstein.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF IRVING L. GORNSTEIN\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES AS AMICUS CURIAE\nSUPPORTING THE RESPONDENT\nMR. GORNSTEIN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nCalifornia's statute of limitations does not\nviolate the Ex Post Facto Clause because it does not\nviolate any of the four Calder categories.\nQUESTION: Mr. Gornstein, may I interrupt you to\nask the same question I did of your co-counsel? Do you\nagree that the rule in this case will apply to pardons and\ngeneral amnesties as well?\nMR. GORNSTEIN: Insofar as we're talking about\nthe Ex Post Facto Clause, correct, yes.\nQUESTION: What other clause might apply other\nthan --\nMR. GORNSTEIN: Well, the -- the legislature\ncould not undo a -- an executive pardon --\nQUESTION: Why not?\nMR. GORNSTEIN: -- under this Court's decisions.\nUnder the Pardon Clause, it has finality that the\nlegislature can't undo it. I think the case is Ex parte\nGarland.\nQUESTION: What -- what provision of the\nConstitution prevents the legislature from authorizing the\n-- the prosecution of someone who has been pardoned?\nMR. GORNSTEIN: The provision of the\nConstitution that grants the President the power to\npardon.\nQUESTION: The legislative amnesty.\nQUESTION: And -- and what's the difference with\nan amnesty too? Legislative amnesty.\nMR. GORNSTEIN: Can I -- let me -- let me do the\npardon first.\nQUESTION: Sure.\nMR. GORNSTEIN: And then I'll move to the\namnesty.\nWith respect to a presidential pardon, it is\nfinal with respect to the legislature by virtue of the\nPardon Clause. The Pardon Clause gives the President the\npower to issue a final pardon that the -- the legislature\ncan't undo.\nQUESTION: Does the word final appear in the\nPardon Clause? Does the word final --\nMR. GORNSTEIN: It is not, but that's how the\nCourt interpreted the Pardon Clause in, I think it's Ex\nparte Garland, but I'm not sure of the decision.\nQUESTION: And what's the -- what's the answer\nwith respect to a State pardon?\nMR. GORNSTEIN: There would be a State\nconstitutional provision usually analogous to that.\nQUESTION: Well, but I mean, I --\nMR. GORNSTEIN: There would not be a Federal --\nQUESTION: Let's -- let's assume the State says\nno. Then -- then there's no problem here.\nMR. GORNSTEIN: If the State -- if the State\nsays no, then the only question that would arise in a\npardon is if you start to analogize it to a agreement\nsituation like Santobello because in some pardon\nsituations, it's like an offer and it has to be accepted.\nYou can't just force a pardon on somebody. And if there's\nan offer and an acceptance, you could potentially\nanalogize it under the due process principle of Santobello\nwhere the government can't withdraw from an agreement\nwithout implicating the Due Process Clause.\nWith respect to an amnesty, there would not be,\nagain, an Ex Post Facto Clause violation, and there would\nnot be a -- any other sort of due process violation,\nagain, once again, unless it fell into the Santobello kind\nof situation or the Raley kind of situation where the\nGovernment offers something, it's accepted, and then it --\nQUESTION: You -- you assert there would be no\nex post facto violation, but why is it different from the\n-- from a statute of limitations running?\nMR. GORNSTEIN: There's no -- there's no Ex Post\nFacto Clause violation with a statute of limitations\nrunning either. That's our position because it does not\nviolate --\nQUESTION: You say you could -- you could indict\nsomeone after granting them amnesty. I misunderstood you.\nMR. GORNSTEIN: Yes, yes.\nNow, with --\nQUESTION: What is your position on -- on Hale\nagainst Henkel and Brown against Walker? The Fifth\nAmendment. Can -- can the State say the statute of\nlimitations has expired, therefore you have to speak, and\nthen revive the time in which the prosecution can be\nbrought?\nMR. GORNSTEIN: The premise of that decision is\nthat you cannot assert the Fifth Amendment when there's no\npresent threat of prosecution, and there is no present\nthreat of prosecution when there's an expired limitations\nperiod. But if the person speaks under compulsion in that\nsituation, and a statute of limitations is subsequently\nretroactively amended, the Government could not use the\ntestimony that was secured through compulsion.\nQUESTION: So what is your -- I mean, starting\nyour basic argument -- I look back. I see Learned Hand\nsays that after the period is run, it is unfair and\ndishonest to prosecute a person. It violates the Ex Post\nFacto Clause. After the Civil War, Roscoe Conkling, a\nHawk I think, said when they wanted to revive treason\nagainst Jefferson Davis, he said that the offense is dead\nif the statute has run. It would be ex post facto.\nHornbook law like American Jurisprudence until recently\nsaid absolutely contrary to the Constitution.\nSo what's changed? Or are -- in -- in the\nGovernment's view, were all those people -- they weren't\nsupreme courts, I agree. But it seemed to be accepted.\nSo has something changed or were they all wrong or what's\nthe view?\nMR. GORNSTEIN: The -- in this Court's decision\nin Collins, it recognized there had been some disagreement\nabout the scope of the Ex Post Facto Clause in prior\ncases, and with some courts saying that it goes beyond the\nfour categories to capture laws that operate to the\ndisadvantage of the defendant in some important way and\nwith other courts saying it's limited to the Calder\ncategories.\nand said that the Ex Post Facto Clause is limited to the\nfour Calder categories. There is not a fifth category of\nthings that operate unfairly to the disadvantage of the\ndefendant.\nNow, that was the analysis that Judge Hand used\nin the opinion that you refer to. He did not say that\nthis violates any of the four categories. He essentially\nsaid this operates to the disadvantage of the defendant in\nan unfair way, a line of analysis that this Court ruled\nout in Collins and reaffirmed ruling it out in Carmell.\nThe same thing is true of the State court\ndecision that Judge Hand referred to in the first in the\nline of those decisions, Hart v. Moore. It frankly\nacknowledged that this law, changing an expired\nlimitations period, does not violate any of the four\nCalder categories. It said, though, we are going to go\nwith the spirit that underlies the Ex Post Facto Clause.\nWell, again, this Court's decision in Collins absolutely\nrules out that line of analysis. In order to find an Ex\nPost Facto Clause violation, you must find that it\nviolates one of the specific Calder categories.\nQUESTION: I didn't think that Hand or American\nJurisprudence or the cases or Roscoe Conkling or the civil\nor any of these things said one thing one way or the other\nabout whether it fell within the categories. I'm not sure\nI'm right on that, which is why I'm raising it. And --\nand if I -- if I -- but if I am right, can you use the\nsecond category, anything that aggravates a crime? It\nseems to aggravate a crime to say that this crime would\nhave been prosecuted for 3 years and then we change it\nretroactively and say it could be prosecuted for 50 years.\nI mean, that seems to aggravate the -- so what is your\nresponse to those --\nMR. GORNSTEIN: On the --\nQUESTION: Am I right in thinking they were\nsilent?\nMR. GORNSTEIN: No.\nQUESTION: And two -- no.\nMR. GORNSTEIN: In Hart v. Moore, which is the\nkey precedent that Judge Hand referred to, it's just an\n1880 case, the -- the Court said that it doesn't violate\nthe four Calder categories. And so it -- it relied on the\nspirit underlying the clause.\nIn the case of Judge Hand, he didn't undertake\nan analysis under the four categories, but he undertook\nthe kind of a catchall fifth category analysis that some\nof this Court's cases suggested was possible at the time,\nbut that the Collins case said is not.\nNow, with respect to the question of category\ntwo, category two, this Court explained in the Carmell\ndecision, is traced to Wooddeson's discussion. Wooddeson\nsaid that there are two kinds of laws that affect\npunishment. One of them creates new punishments, another\none increases the severity of the punishment. And what\nthe Court said in Carmell is that Justice Chase precisely\nadapted those concepts into his category. Category two is\nchanging -- creating a punishment. Category three is\nincreasing the severity of the punishment. And that is\nthe limit of what those two categories involve, and\nneither of those are implicated in this case because the\npunishment is exactly the same in form and amount as that\nwhich was prescribed at the time of the offense.\nQUESTION: It is odd, Mr. Gornstein, isn't it,\nthat we take as gospel something that was said en passant\nin -- what year was Calder against Bull? Very early on.\nAnd the case in fact decided it wasn't an ex post facto\nlaw. So this was dictum en passant, and it didn't dispose\nof the case one way or another.\nMR. GORNSTEIN: But -- but the situation is not\nthat the -- it is stare decisis from that case. It is\nstare decisis from subsequent cases like Collins and\nothers which have concluded that Justice Chase accurately\ndetermined the limits of the Ex Post Facto Clause based on\nthe historical evidence of what the Framers thought,\nincluding Wooddeson and Blackstone and -- and State\nconstitutions, and the Framers and other sources that he\nrelied on. He was right. He got it right, and subsequent\ndecisions of the Court have held that, including Collins.\nQUESTION: What --\nQUESTION: Which Collins also said something --\nthe recitation in Collins included, nor deprive one\ncharged of -- with crime of any defense. It used the word\nany defense available according to the law at the time the\nact was committed.\nMR. GORNSTEIN: No. In -- in Collins, what the\nCourt said is that -- that prior cases had used that\nformulation of any defense and in particular Beazell. And\nwhat Collins did was to clarify that the only defenses\nthat are available are those that go to excuse or\njustification at the time the offense is committed. And\nit merges it then with the first category which deals with\nchanging laws and criminalizing conduct that was innocent\nwhen done. The defenses that -- that are prohibited that\nyou can't change under the Ex Post Facto Clause are those\nthat have the effect of criminalizing conduct that would\nhave been innocent when it was done.\nI want to move to the fourth category where some\nof the questions have been, and it's critical to\nunderstand the fourth category is closely connected to the\nfirst category.\nsufficient to show that the defendant's conduct was a\ncrime at the time he acted, and a statute of limitations\ndoes not operate in that way. It changes what evidence is\nsufficient to show that there has been a timely\nprosecution, but it has no effect whatsoever on what\nevidence is sufficient to show that the defendant's\nconduct was a crime at the time he acted.\nQUESTION: So suppose on that particular point,\nthe State had a law that said that oral evidence can no\nlonger be used for conviction after 10 years passes. And\nthen it later changed the law to say it can be. Would\nthat fall under the fourth category?\nMR. GORNSTEIN: It -- it would, Justice Breyer,\nif you said no evidence is sufficient to sustain a\nconviction unless it meets certain specifications because\nthat's going to the crime. You can't prove up the crime\nthat way.\nQUESTION: So you just -- what you'd say is\nyou'd say no oral evidence of child abuse can be admitted\nafter 10 years, though you can use other forms of\nevidence.\nMR. GORNSTEIN: No. Admissibility is a\ndifferent question, Justice Breyer.\nQUESTION: So -- so it wouldn't apply at all\nhere.\nMR. GORNSTEIN: It wouldn't apply to\nadmissibility. Under -- Carmell draw -- drew a\ndistinction between admissibility and sufficiency of the\nevidence rules. Changes in admissibility rules are\npermissible. Changes in sufficiency of the evidence rules\nare not.\nNow, explaining further why the fourth category\nneeds to be read in this way, there are several reasons.\nThe first is that's the way the Court has applied the\nfourth category. In situations where there's been a\nchange in what evidence is sufficient to prove the first\n-- to prove the defendant committed a crime, it found a\nviolation, as in Carmell and as in Cummings. But where\nthe change was -- there was a change in what was\nsufficient to establish some other precondition that\ndoesn't go back to whether the defendant acted criminally\nat the beginning, the Court hasn't found a violation.\nAnd -- and the example is Gut v. Minnesota where\nthere was a change in the venue rule. What was changed\nthere -- change was -- was sufficient to prove venue,\nwhich was a precondition to guilt, but it didn't change\nwhat was sufficient to prove that the defendant acted in a\ncriminal manner when he acted. And the Court said that\nthere was no fourth category violation.\nAlso, the statutes of limitations for over 100\nyears -- all the courts have concluded that if you\nretroactively amend an expired limit -- I'm sorry -- an\nunexpired limitations period, there's no Ex Post Facto\nClause violation, and in terms of the Calder category\nfour, there's absolutely no difference between those\nstatutes and this one. In both cases, it changes what's\nsufficient to show that there is a timely prosecution. In\nneither case does it change what's sufficient to show that\nthe defendant committed -- when he acted, he committed a\ncrime. And that is what category four is about.\nFinally, in Carmell, this Court noted that\ncategory four is a mirror image of category one, and it\nsaid they both work together to prevent subversions of the\npresumption of innocence. And that description of\ncategory four supports the conclusion of the linkage\nbetween four and one that the -- what you're talking about\nare rules that change what evidence is sufficient to show\nthat the defendant's conduct was a crime when he acted.\nAnd that's not -- and the statute of limitations\nhere doesn't do that. It changes what's sufficient to\nshow that there's been a timely prosecution. It doesn't\nchange in any way what's sufficient to show that the\ndefendant committed a crime when he acted.\nIf the Court has no further questions --\nQUESTION: I have one question.\nreference to the language in the four categories, is there\nany precedent of this Court supporting the Government's\nposition?\nMR. GORNSTEIN: The -- the only precedent -- and\nit's mild precedent -- is the Stewart v. Kahn decision\nwhere the Court was examining a retroactive tolling period\nduring the Civil War, and the Court -- the issue actually\nbefore the Court was the civil component of that. But in\nthe course of discussing that, Justice Stevens, the Court\nmentioned that the criminal component of it was also\nretroactive and -- and it applied to expired limitations\nperiod. And in a paragraph that applied to both civil and\ncriminal, the Court said there's no constitutional problem\nwith that.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Gornstein.\nMr. Najera, you have 4 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERTO NAJERA\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. NAJERA: Thank you, Your Honor.\nI'd like to, first of all, answer one question.\nIt's clear by California law that post-conviction, a\nperson can raise, either by habeas or other appellate\nrelief, the statute of limitations claim. That's been\nclear since Ex parte Vice and was reaffirmed in the McGee\ncase.\nTurning to the Collins question, the real import\nin Collins was not to get caught up in distinctions or\nlabels such as substantive versus procedure, and it would\nseem that if we began to draw such distinctions here, we\nrun ultimately into the same problems. And it would seem\nto me that if Collins stands for the proposition that\naffirmative defenses, defenses which the defendant has the\nburden of establishing, are protected, why are not\ndefenses that the district attorney must disprove such as\nthe statute of limitations? For this has always been, in\nCalifornia, the burden upon the prosecution to show that\nthe statute has in fact not run.\nAlso, it seems that the State wishes to shift\nthe burden and foist it upon the petitioner and says,\nwell, we can address this in procedural due process, while\nin fact that, as I said, foists the burden onto the\npetitioner when the burden in fact lies with the\nprosecution.\nAnd in the Marion case, Supreme Court case, the\nCourt reaffirmed that an irrebuttable presumption of harm\noccurs by such delay, and that's by way of the legislative\nact.\nFinally, I'd like to note that not only would\nfinality be upset in these particular cases, but really\nwhat we're talking about is respect for the laws. Every\nday in this country citizens make bargains with -- with\nthe State, and the State makes bargains with its citizens.\nIt did so by creating a statute of limitations. And every\nday, particularly in the criminal field, most, the vast\nmajority of the accused enter into bargains. They plea\nbargain. They give away their rights and accept a\nbargain. And we hold them to that. We hold them\naccountable for what they bargain.\nAre we here -- if we accept the State's\nposition, are we here to hold the State to a lesser\nstandard than we hold to what many consider the meanest\nand lowest amongst us? I would think not. I think we\nwould expect the State and the Federal Government to stand\nfor something more, to be the leader and not the follower,\nto have a standard higher or at least equal to that of\nwhich we expect of each of our accused, each person who\npleads in this particular case.\nI would ask, as I said in the beginning, that\nthis Court hold the State to the bargain that it chose to\nmake, to the terms that it chose to define by creating the\nstatute of limitations.\nAnd if there are no further questions, I will\nsubmit the matter.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr. Najera.\n"
