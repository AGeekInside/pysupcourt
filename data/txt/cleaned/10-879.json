Railroad\nFriction Products Corporation.\nMr. Frederick.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID C. FREDERICK\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. FREDERICK: Thank you, Mr. Chief\nJustice, and may it please the Court:\nCongress enacted the Locomotive Inspection\nAct to ensure the safety of locomotives in use on\nrailroad lines, not to regulate hazards to mechanics\nconducting repairs of locomotives.\nThe doctrine of implied --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, what do you -- what\ndo you make of the ICC in 1916, in the Tiller case,\nregulating the lights that railroads had to have,\nlocomotives had to have in the yard, and that those\nlights had to differ when the railroad was in use?\nMR. FREDERICK: That was actually I think\npursuant to the Safety Appliance Act, Justice Sotomayor,\nif I'm not -- if I'm not mistaken. And the principle\nbehind the safety in use regulation that this Court\nconstrued in Napier was to ensure that locomotives were\nsafe for fit use on the line. And that was the\nconsistent construction both in the ICC's statement that\nit made in 1922 and in this Court's post-Napier --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm not sure I\nunderstand. It prescribed different lights when the --\nwhen the locomotive was in the yard.\nMR. FREDERICK: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That had nothing to do\nwith safety in use. It had to do with safety in repair.\nMR. FREDERICK: Our position is that it was\nnot pursuant to the Locomotive Inspection Act that the\nICC promulgated that rule. As the Court has said in\nnumerous cases, the ICC had rules in place with respect\nto different aspects of the train at different points in\ntime, but the Locomotive Inspection Act was designed to\naddress a very specific problem, which was boilers\nexploding on the line when the train was in operation.\nAnd that is the consistent way that the ICC, and\nsubsequently the Federal Railroad Administration, has\nconstrued the Act.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Distinguish for me our\nreasoning in the Ray case.\nMR. FREDERICK: I'm sorry.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Distinguish for me the\ndifference in the Ray case, that had to do with\nnavigation and where we held that the agency, in\nensuring safety in navigation, controlled design\ncompletely, whether in repair or not. So, how do we --\nwhy don't we apply the logic of Ray to this case?\nMR. FREDERICK: Well, of course in Ray you\naddressed the Port and Tanker Safety Act, as well as the\nPort and Waterway Safety Act. And in the United States\nv. Locke case, the Court subsequently looked at Ray in\nterms of design in a statute that also specifically\nincluded the word \"repair and maintenance,\" which is\nabsent here.\nBut what the Court was getting at in Ray was\nto ensure that States were not using their law to\ninterfere with the design of equipment. Of course, that\nwas for --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's the argument\nhere, which is --\nMR. FREDERICK: No.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- once you regulate\nwhat -- what the design or use of asbestos is, you're\ninterfering with what available components there are for\nlocomotives.\nMR. FREDERICK: If I could make two points\nabout that, Justice Sotomayor. That's not actually\ncorrect. The first is anything that the Court might\nthink about design does not impair our failure-to-\nwarrant claims, which entail no challenge to the design\nof a locomotive at all, only to the instructions for its\nsafe use. But to the --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, you're giving up all\nof your other claims?\nMR. FREDERICK: No. My second argument is\nthat the design claim here involves repair work or\nproblems uniquely; it does not include or intrude on the\nfitness for service standard that this Court announced\nin Napier or that has consistently been applied. The\nasbestos harms that the repair workers here faced are\nunique to the repair process, where they are scraping\noff the --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but, counsel,\nlooking at Napier, the power that Justice Brandeis said\nwas conferred in that case was to specify the sort of\nequipment to be used on locomotives, right?\nMR. FREDERICK: Yes, but on --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, this is\nequipment that was used in locomotives.\nMR. FREDERICK: Yes, but, Mr. Chief Justice,\nit also says on page 612 that the power delegated by\nCongress is to determine fitness for service. So, the\nwords about the --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes, but that's the\nsame -- that's the same thing, I'll give you that,\nfitness for service.\nMR. FREDERICK: No, it's not --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It doesn't say\nsomething that's going to cause harm while it's actually\nbeing used.\nMR. FREDERICK: But, Mr. Chief Justice, the\nprinciple here is to ensure that the locomotives, when\nthey are outside the repair yard and are on the\nlocomotive -- on the railroad line, are -- are safe to\noperate. That standard in Napier had --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why does it\ndepend -- you want to know if this equipment is safe to\noperate, right? To be used, whether -- whether it's\ngoing to be used. If you have a --\nMR. FREDERICK: Not to be broken down.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If you have a boiler\nthat's going to be used, that's within the power that\nwas confirmed. It's not merely to inspect as, again,\nJustice Brandeis said.\nMR. FREDERICK: But the point here is that\nit is not to be broken down. And the locomotive repair\nworkers here face unique hazards in repairing\nlocomotives whose safety standards are to ensure that\nthey work properly on the railroad line, not when\nthey're being taken apart and repaired. That they --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I guess your\nargument isn't limited to being taken apart. Your\nargument does depend on the fact that the asbestos\ndoesn't come out during use; right?\nMR. FREDERICK: That's absolutely correct.\nThat's why this is --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, how do we know\nthat --\nMR. FREDERICK: -- a unique hazard faced by\nthe repair workers.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes, but if there's\nan accident or something, does the asbestos come out\nduring the use of the locomotive?\nMR. FREDERICK: If it did, it would be\ncovered under the Locomotive Inspection Act safety\nstandard, and that would be covered by Federal law.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You -- you would say once\nthere's an accident and the locomotive is disabled, it's\nno longer in use. I suppose that's what you'd say.\nMR. FREDERICK: That's correct, and --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's unrealistic, but\nthat's what you'd say.\nMR. FREDERICK: No. Well, it's governed by\na different statute, which is found at 49 U.S.C. 303.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's the old\ninsurance cases we've had, that, you know, when the car,\nyou know, slams into a pole or something, it's not being\nused as a car anymore; and, therefore, the insurance\ndoesn't cover it.\nMR. FREDERICK: Well, if I could finish my\nanswer to your previous question, Mr. Chief Justice,\nthere's a specific statute on that point, and it\npredated the Locomotive Inspection Act, and it provided\nthat when there was a crippled locomotive, the railroad\ndid not face liability, civil penalties, to bring the\ncrippled locomotive back to the yard, but it\nspecifically said if a worker was injured during that\nprocess, the railroad would face liability.\nOur point here is that the Locomotive\nInspection Act's field should be construed narrowly\nbecause in 1970 Congress expressly and comprehensively\nlegislated in the Federal Rail Safety Act and provided a\nconflict pre-emption regime in which if a State had a\nrule in place, that rule would be permitted to survive\nunless and until the Federal Rail Administration issued\na regulation. And there has never been a regulation on\nasbestos.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What I'm concerned about I\nthink is the same thing that the Chief Justice\nmentioned, the particular language in Napier. And\nwhatever -- however this might come out today if Napier\nwere decided again, it did come out the way it did. And\nJustice Brandeis did write it, and it's been the law a\nlong time.\nAnd the argument is made in Napier that this\nparticular State regulation is aimed at preventing\nsickness and disease, not at making locomotives safe,\nand, therefore, it's not pre-empted. And the answer to\nthat was not sickness and disease are an object of the\nstatute, too. The answer was the Federal and the State\nstatutes are directed to the same subject, the equipment\nof locomotives; and, therefore, it is pre-empted.\nNow, how could we come out in your favor\nwithout overturning what seems to be that key sentence\nin Napier? That is the problem that's bothering me.\nMR. FREDERICK: Well, first, I would urge\nyou not to read Napier like a statute, although Justice\nBrandeis is obviously --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I see. Okay. That's a --\nthe problem with (a) is that it's been followed and\nfollowed and followed and followed, and really read for\nall its worth, and so forth. So -- so one question is,\nto what extent can I go back and revise that sentence?\nThat's (a). Okay? What's (b)?\nMR. FREDERICK: (B) is that he was\naddressing himself to fitness for service standards on\nthe line, the Wisconsin and Georgia statutes at issue\nthere purporting to regulate what the locomotive could\ndo while it was in operation on the line. That's not\nwhat the claims in this case entail.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Not -- now, is there any\nway that you could win your case -- reasonably, in a\nreasonable way, not some far-out way -- but you win your\ncase on this, and it does not affect the manufacturers'\nway of dealing with their equipment?\nMR. FREDERICK: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What is that?\nMR. FREDERICK: First is if you accept our\nproposition that warning claims are valid negligence\nclaims. The warning claims are not -- do not affect the\nequipment, how it is made at all. It's simply how do\nyou use the equipment safely.\nSecondly, the design claims here go to the\nunique hazards faced by repair workers. You could use\nasbestos, under our theory of the case, on the\nlocomotive in exactly the same way that the locomotive\nequipment manufacturers have done, so long as there's a\nsafer way to take the asbestos off the locomotive in the\nrepair yard.\nThat is a distinct kind of design claim that\ndoesn't go to the safe operation of the locomotive; it\ngoes to what hazards are created when a repair worker is\ndoing maintenance work on it.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm not sure I\nunderstand this. Are you talking about wearing a\nparticular hazard suit?\nMR. FREDERICK: That would be --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Are you talking about\nblowing out air? Are you talking about changing the\ndesign so the asbestos comes off without the dust cloud\nthat's generally created?\nMR. FREDERICK: Both. The dust cloud is\nsomething that can be warned against and protected\nagainst with protective gear that has nothing to do with\nthe design of a locomotive. There are, and there is\nevidence that there are, safer and were safer ways -- I\nremind you that asbestos isn't used on locomotives\nanymore, so this is part of an historical debate here --\nbut in ways that could be removed that would not create\nthe cloud dust. That's the essence of the design defect\nclaim. And the LIA and the FRA do not regulate in the\nrepair shop. So, there's a complete gap here in\nterms --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Let me make sure I\nunderstand you. Is -- if the Secretary tomorrow decided\nto issue a regulation saying railroads should no longer\nuse these asbestos-containing brakes because of the\nhazards in the repair shop, do you think the Secretary\ncould not do that under the statute?\nMR. FREDERICK: No. Absolutely --\nabsolutely can do that under the Federal Rail Safety\nAct, which, again, empowers the Secretary.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: But the Secretary cannot do\nthat under LIA? Is that the idea?\nMR. FREDERICK: It -- it very well could\nbecause it's a fitness for service standard. But it\nalways -- and if you look at its regulations, in parts\n229 and part 230 of 49 C.F.R., it always issues these\nregulations under both authorities because the FRSA\nexpanded it.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Okay, then I'm a little bit\nlost. If the Secretary can issue such a regulation\nunder LIA, L-I-A, then isn't it in the scope of\nregulation, and then isn't it also in the scope of\nwhat's pre-empted?\nMR. FREDERICK: It would have to do so under\nthe B&O Railroad case in the early 1930s -- there was\nanother Justice Brandeis opinion -- in which it would\nhave to make a finding that to make that regulation that\nyou posit, Justice Kagan, was necessary to avoid\nunnecessary peril to life or limb. In that case, the\nCourt struck down the ICC's attempt to issue a\nregulation on a particular type of equipment because the\nICC could not make that demonstration.\nSo, in the current world, the FRA would\nregulate under the FRSA; it would not regulate under the\nLIA because under this Court's jurisprudence it is a\nharder standard to meet to implement a regulatory\nstandard. That's our point.\nThe regulatory field here does not need to\nbe read as expansively as the other side posits, because\nthe FRA has all the authority it needs under the FRSA if\nit chooses to promulgate those rules, and it has not\nchosen to promulgate those rules. The FRA can use\nconflict pre-emption to displace any State rule, but\nwhat they are seeking to do is to take the doctrine of\nimplied field pre-emption, gain immunity from State law\nliability, and not be subject to any Federal rules. And\nit's that proposition that is an extraordinary\nproposition of implied field pre-emption. We found no\ncase from this Court that goes that far.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Frederick, could\nyou -- could you clarify what is at stake for the worker\nhere? The railroad worker ordinarily has the FELA\nclaim, but the FELA claim in this case was dismissed.\nSo, can you tell us what recourse -- if you lose, what\nrecovery can this plaintiff get? And also explain to me\nwhy the FELA claim was dismissed.\nMR. FREDERICK: If we lose this case,\nJustice Ginsburg, the decedent's family gets nothing,\ntakes nothing, because the FELA claim was rendered\nsummary judgment on the finding that there was no\nnegligence by the railroad. The only claim that the\ndecedent's family has here is a third-party claim\nagainst the manufacturer for failing to warn or design\ndefect on the basis of State law.\nJUSTICE BREYER: You just -- you just said\nthat, which I think you certainly have the right to\nbring a claim, don't you, to say the repair shop doesn't\nhave adequate warnings. And if -- if that's -- if the\nrailroad's at fault in that, or the manufacturers or the\nowner of the repair shop, everybody who ever puts the\nasbestos in there is negligent in not putting up\nadequate warnings.\nWhat's wrong with that?\nMR. FREDERICK: Well, here -- ordinarily,\nyou'd bring a failure-to-warn claim directly against the\nmanufacturer for not putting in the manual or stamping\non the equipment --\nJUSTICE BREYER: What about -- what about\nnot --\nMR. FREDERICK: -- or providing instructions\nfor safe use.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What about getting away\nfrom the equipment and saying the failure here is not to\nfail to put it on the equipment; it's to fail to put it\nin the repair shop?\nMR. FREDERICK: It's both.\nJUSTICE BREYER: There's something I'm not\nseeing.\nMR. FREDERICK: No. It's -- it's both.\nManufacturers routinely are held liable for failing to\nwarn if in their manuals or in their other instruction\nmaterials they do not provide for instructions for the\nsafe use of their equipment.\nIf I could save the balance of my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Frederick.\nMs. Harrington.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF SARAH E. HARRINGTON\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,\nAS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS\nMS. HARRINGTON: Mr. Chief Justice, and may\nit please the Court:\nI think it's helpful in this case to try to\nseparate out the field pre-emption issues from the\nconflict pre-emption issues. In the Government's view,\nthe only issue properly presented in this case is\nwhether Petitioners' tort claims fall within the field\npre-empted by the LIA, and our view is that they do not\nbecause they arise from injuries that occurred when the\nlocomotive was not in use.\nNow, Respondent would have the Court expand\nthe field that's pre-empted by the LIA to include any\nclaim that has anything to do with locomotive equipment,\nregardless of whether the equipment or the locomotive\nwas in use at the time injury occurred.\nBut it doesn't make sense to --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Don't you think that one of\nthe purposes of the legislation, which everybody\nunderstood, was to enable engine manufacturers to be\nable to construct their engines without having to worry\nabout a variety of different State requirements?\nRailroading is a national transportation industry, and\nwhoever makes the engine has to know, if I do it this\nway, it's going to be okay.\nMS. HARRINGTON: Absolutely.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And you're saying it won't\nbe okay because, although every State may have -- every\nState's requirements may be pre-empted when the -- when\nthe locomotive is in use, all 50 States can have\ndifferent requirements with respect to what the design\nhas to be in order to make the engine safe when it's\nbeing repaired. I think that truly frustrates the\npurpose of the Act.\nMS. HARRINGTON: I completely agree with\nwhat you're saying. And -- and I'm sorry if you\nmissed -- if we didn't state our position clearly in our\nbrief. Our view is that those kinds of requirements --\nrequirements that go to the design, construction, or\nmaterials on a locomotive that will be used, if those\nrequirements are directed at the repair shop, then they\nwould be conflict pre-empted.\nBut they wouldn't fall within the field\nthat's governed by LIA because the LIA's substantive\nstandard of care only applies to locomotives that are in\nuse.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I'm not -- I'm not\nconcerned about conflict pre-emption. I'm not concerned\nabout State requirements that conflict with the Federal.\nI'm talking about 50 State requirements that conflict\nwith each other, so that the manufacturer has to look to\nall 50 States instead of looking to the Secretary here,\nwhich says your engine is safe if you do this. And\nyou're telling me the manufacturer can no longer assume\nthat.\nMS. HARRINGTON: No, I'm sorry. And let me\nclarify. I appreciate the opportunity to clarify. In\nour view, what the conflict is, is not a conflict with a\nFederal rule saying you have to use this piece of\nequipment and you can't use that piece of equipment.\nThe conflict is with one of the purposes of the LIA,\nwhich is that the Federal Government be the only\nregulator of equipment that will be used on a\nlocomotive.\nAnd so, what that means is if -- if the\nFederal Government hasn't spoken as to whether piece of\nequipment A can be used on a locomotive, that means that\nit can be, that the manufacturers know that it's okay.\nAnd if you have a State rule that would have the effect\nof dictating the equipment that can be used on a\nlocomotive, that would conflict with the single\nregulator objective of the LIA.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So, what's the difference\nthen? How do you do it? How do you -- how do you --\nwhat is it you're thinking of that the manufacturer's\ngoing to have to do in respect to his locomotive in\norder to comply with the State law about warning that is\nnot going to mean that he changes the locomotive when it\nruns on the railroad?\nMS. HARRINGTON: Well, I think it depends on\nwhat the warning claim is.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, give me an example.\nMS. HARRINGTON: Well, under the -- under\nthe Respondents' -- under the Respondents' view of the\nfield that's pre-empted, a State could not regulate the\ndisposal of equipment that's removed from a locomotive\nduring their repair process, even though --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Does that have anything to\ndo with this case, the removal, never further -- no\nfurther use of a bit of a locomotive?\nMS. HARRINGTON: No. But also --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No. Okay. Let's get to\nthis case.\nMS. HARRINGTON: Also, in Respondents' view\na State could not regulate workplace hazards, such as by\nrequiring that workers wear goggles or masks.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Oh, I didn't know anybody\ndenied that, that the State could regulate the repair\nshop, indeed require what warnings they wish, indeed\nrequire what equipment workers have to have. I thought\nwe're only talking about those rules of State law that\nwould affect what the manufacturer has to put by way of\ndesign in his locomotive.\nMS. HARRINGTON: Yes, but when you're --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And that's what I'm having\ntrouble thinking of one that would only affect repair\nshops and repairs, but -- maybe there's some kind of\nequipment that you could stick on the front of it, and\nit is a hook or something -- and it holds something, and\nbefore it goes back on the line, you take it off and put\nit in a locker. And -- but, you know, the more I\nthought along those lines, I thought I'm getting into\nouter space. This isn't reality. So --\nMS. HARRINGTON: No. I think you could --\nI'm sorry. I think you could imagine a world where a\nState says when a locomotive comes into a repair shop,\nthe railroad or the repair shop has to attach a certain\nkind of clamp on the wheels, a certain kind of brake,\nthat makes sure that the locomotive won't move while\nit's in the repair shop. And when you're done repairing\nthe locomotive, you take them off, and the locomotive\ngoes back --\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. Now, does that\nhave more than theoretical value in this case?\nMS. HARRINGTON: Well, I think in this case\nthe claims that we say would not be conflict pre-empted\nor within the field are claims -- are the\nfailure-to-warn claims. Now, how a manufacturer\nactually issues the warning that would be required I\nthink is a question that could be worked out as the case\nproceeds.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: If the manufacturer is\nreally not controlling the repair shop, of what value is\nthis failure-to-warn claim?\nMS. HARRINGTON: Well, again, I think it\ndepends how the warning is issued. You could require\nthat the manufacturer tell the purchaser of the products\nto pass the warning along, to post warnings in a repair\nshop. You know, there --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How -- they can't\ncontrol whether they do or don't.\nMS. HARRINGTON: They could require it\ncontractually through the sale of the products. I think\nthose sorts of detailed issues would be things that\nwould be worked out on remand in this case.\nAgain, in our view, the only question\nsquarely presented in this case is the field pre-emption\nquestion. And --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: So, on that question, Ms.\nHarrington, I'm still confused about the scope of your\nregulatory authority and whether you think you have the\ncapacity to issue rules that are meant to protect repair\nworkers on railway equipment. So, can you issue a rule\nunder the LIA that says no asbestos-containing brakes\nbecause we're afraid that these brakes injure the -- the\nguys in the roundhouse.\nMS. HARRINGTON: No. The LIA -- the\nstandard of care under the LIA only goes to whether a\nlocomotive is safe for use, and that is also the limit\nof the FRA's regulatory authority. This Court, in the\nUnited States v. B&O, addressed that issue. The ICC at\nthe time had issued a regulation requiring a certain\nkind of reverse gear instead of a different kind of\nreverse gear.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, what -- what\nself-abnegation by the Federal Government, that \"safe\nfor use\" does not include safe for use when it's being\nrepaired.\nMS. HARRINGTON: Because the statute says\nsafe for use on -- safe for use on the line. It's safe\nfor use on lines of interstate commerce.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: But this does seem a very\nlimiting construction. Napier seems to have a broader\nconstruction, and if I read some of your history right,\nyou've taken a broader understanding of your regulatory\nauthority in the past. So, why this narrow view?\nMS. SMITH: I'm not aware that we've taken a\nbroader view of our regulatory authority under the LIA.\nIn Napier, again, what's important to remember is that\nthe State statutes at issue applied only to locomotives\nthat were in use. And so, I think it's hard to take any\n-- any broad statements that were made in Napier and\nread them as applying outside that context.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but if you're\ntalking about -- I bet there are a lot of things on\nrailroad cars that you can fix in the shop or you can\nfix while it's under way, right? We're not always\ntalking about brakes. So, let's suppose there's one of\nthose things. You get to the shop and the guy says:\nBoy, you got to fix this. And they said: Well, the\ntrain's leaving, and we're going to go in 10 hours. And\nhe says: Okay, I can fix it during the -- while it's in\nuse. Is that covered or not?\nMS. HARRINGTON: Well, again the LIA only\napplies to the locomotives. So, if the thing that's\nbroken that you could fix while it's in use would not\nmake the locomotive unsafe to use, then it would not be\na violation of the statute to use it while --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, the line you've\nbeen talking about between the repair shop and the\nlocomotive on the tracks, that's not really the line at\nall.\nMS. HARRINGTON: The line is in use versus\nnot in use. And that tends to match --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, then -- well,\nthen what's the answer to my question? This is\nsomething you can fix in either place. It's covered\nwhile it's -- if you fix it while the train is under\nway, but it's not covered if you wait until it's in the\nshop?\nMS. HARRINGTON: Well, if it's -- if the\nfact that it's broken makes the locomotive unsafe to\nuse, then the railroad cannot use it, cannot repair it\nwhile it's in use.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, then it's not\nwhether it's in use or in the shop. It's whether it is\nsomething that affects whether the locomotive can go,\nwhether it's --\nMS. HARRINGTON: That's right. But here the\ninjuries occur when the locomotive is not in use because\nit's in the repair shop. And in those situations, the\nLIA's substantive heightened duty of care doesn't even\napply. And so, it doesn't make sense to think of those\nclaims as being within the field that's pre-empted by\nthe LIA because they're not governed by the LIA. Now,\nthose claims might bump up against the LIA in a\ndifferent way by conflicting again with the --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Do you have any --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Can you explain --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I'm sorry. Go ahead.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Can you explain the\ndifference -- you make a distinction between field\npre-emption and conflict pre-emption. Does that have\nany practical significance at all in this case, because\nI thought you agreed that the design defect claim would\nbe barred?\nMS. HARRINGTON: Well, we agree that they\nmight be barred. I think, you know, this case comes to\nthe Court without any real development of the\nplaintiffs' claim. All we have is what they stated in\ntheir complaint. Their complaint incorporates a master\ncomplaint which applies to all sorts of different kinds\nof plaintiffs. And so, I think it's really hard to\nunderstand exactly what their claims are, what the\neffect of their claims would be with respect to the\ndesign defect claims. And so, in our view, they would\n-- the design defect claims would be pre-empted if they\nwould have the effect of dictating the character of\nequipment that could be on a locomotive while it was in\nuse.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMS. HARRINGTON: Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Hacker.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JONATHAN D. HACKER\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. HACKER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe LIA as construed by this Court in\nNapier, in particular in the passage quoted by Justice\nBreyer, delegates to the DOT the exclusive authority to\ndetermine the design and the materials of locomotive\nequipment. Petitioners, however, argue that States in\nfact may dictate locomotive design and materials so long\nas they do so for some purpose other than safety of use\non the line.\nBut, again, in the passage Justice Breyer\npointed out, Napier holds that LIA pre-emption is not\nabout the purpose of locomotive equipment regulation and\nis not about the geographic location of the locomotive\non or off the line when the regulation is enforced. As\nJustice Sotomayor pointed out in the earlier argument\nthis morning, regulatory power is broader than purpose.\nAs Napier says, under the LIA, pre-emption is about the\nlocomotive equipment itself, what Napier referred to as\nthe physical elements of the locomotive.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Well, Mr. Hacker, could you\nexplain to me -- I wasn't sure reading your brief\nwhether you agree or disagree with the Government's\npoint that the agency cannot, under the LIA, issue the\nkind of rule that I suggested just, you know, saying no\nasbestos-containing brakes because of the danger that\nthose brakes pose to the repairmen.\nMR. HACKER: I -- frankly, I would have\nthought it possible. I would have to defer to the -- to\nthe DOT's view. It seems to me it would have been\nwithin DOT's power under the LIA to say a locomotive is\nnot safe to operate if it can't be safely repaired.\nBecause there's no point in having a locomotive ready to\ngo on the line if it -- as soon as it comes off the line\nwith a problem it's going to injure those who work with\nit. But we don't need to assert that position to defend\nthe proposition we have now --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Well, how is that? If they\nare right as to the scope of their authority -- and\nmaybe they're not right, but if they are right about the\nscope of their authority, why doesn't it follow that\nthese claims would not be field pre-empted; might be\nconflict pre-empted but would not be field pre-empted\nbecause we're no longer in the field?\nMR. HACKER: Because the field is not --\nit's not about the repair shop versus not the repair\nshop. The field is the physical elements of the\nlocomotive itself. What States cannot do -- what DOT\nhas exclusive authority over is the design, the\nmaterials, and the construction of the locomotive.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But only the design,\nmaterials, and constructions for use. If you make that\nconcession, it's only those aspects of design,\nmaterials, and construction that pertain to use. And if\nyou take the position that use includes only use on the\nline and not use when it's being repaired in the repair\nshop, I think you're in trouble.\nMR. HACKER: I think we're not, Your Honor,\nbecause the design doesn't change between the line and\nthe repair shop. And that's the key. If a State comes\nin and says --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's design for use.\nMR. HACKER: I understand, but --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I'm not talking about the\nword \"design\"; I'm talking about \"design for use.\"\nMR. HACKER: But the statute -- the reason\nthe statute gives power to the DOT is to ensure that\nlocomotives are safe for use on the line. But in order\nto accomplish that objective, the power they have is\nplenary over the design itself. They -- only one entity\ngets to decide what the design is, and that's DOT. A\nState can't come in and say --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: It's not -- it's not\nclear --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, you're okay --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: It's not clear to me why a\nrailroad executive couldn't say, now I need to use 10\nlocomotives in this division because I will be using two\nof them every week in the repair shop to repair them,\nright? I don't know why that isn't use, but you\ndon't -- you don't seem to agree with that.\nMR. HACKER: Well, I don't necessarily\ndisagree. We would certainly accept that proposition.\nWe're just saying you don't have to go there.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Now, I know it's use on\nthe line, but it seems to me that the repair shop is an\nobvious extension of the line. Everybody knows that\nit's going to have to spend, I don't know, 1 day a month\nin the repair shop, and that's just part of -- of the\nuse.\nMR. HACKER: We don't disagree with that.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Why would their law be\npre-empted, a State law that says since the railroad\nknows that asbestos is dangerous when revealed and since\nit would be revealed in a repair shop, the railroad has\nto provide the repair shops with appropriate worker\nsafety equipment; or alternatively, and lesser, the\nrailroad has to provide for the repair shop's documents\nto be given to the workers which explain the risks and\nhow they can overcome them.\nNow, in respect to that, which I'll lump\nunder various kinds of failure-to-warn claims, how does\nthe Act pre-empt those? It doesn't affect design of the\nrailroad, nor does it affect the use. Neither.\nMR. HACKER: I would say two points, Your\nHonor. First of all, it does affect the design because\na way to comply with that regulation is to use something\nother than asbestos, to change the design. It's the\nState saying, because you're using this design, you can\nonly use it lawfully in this State if you do the\nfollowing two or three things.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought that that was\nnot the nature of the notice claim. The design is\nwhatever it is. But the manufacturer has to issue\nwarnings so that the worker can protect himself against\nthat hazard. So, I thought that the defective design --\nyes, I understand your argument. You would have one\nstandard for on the line and another when it's in the\nrepair shop. But this is not telling them to change the\ndesign in any respect. It just says: Asbestos -- you\ncould take these measures to protect yourself.\nMR. HACKER: At common law, a design -- a\nfailure-to-warn claim was a type of design defect claim.\nIt was a way of saying you can't use that design\nlawfully unless you have the following type of warning.\nIf you -- you can't assume away the design aspect of it\nbecause it still turns on -- it's a State conditioning\nthe design.\nThe LIA and the FRSA and SCAA and OSHA all\ntogether solved this problem by -- and FELA, solved this\nproblem by saying it is the repair shop's responsibility\nto ensure the safety of workers. We are not, to be\nabsolutely clear -- Ms. Harrington was incorrect when\nshe said: We don't believe that repair shop -- States\nhave the power to impose workplace conditions to protect\nemployee safety in the repair shop. They do.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But -- no, no, no. That\nargument would prevent States doing what they can do\nlawfully, which is to regulate the repair shop because\nwith any given repair, with many of them, you could say,\nwell, we wouldn't have to -- we can just change the\nlocomotive design, for example. It carries beds with it\nso that the workers who are repairing it get adequate\nsleep. I mean, that isn't an answer to the argument\nthat it doesn't affect design to say, well, they could\ncomply with it by changing design, I don't think.\nMR. HACKER: Well, what we would say is that\ngenerally applicable laws that govern the repair shop --\nStates have authority -- to the extent not pre-empted by\nOSHA, States have authority to require workplace\nconditions and to require employers to protect employees\nworking. But what they can't do is tell manufacturers\nhere's the conditions under which you can use this\ndesign, sell this design, distribute the design and\nthese materials lawfully within the State --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What would apply to the\nrepair shop would also apply to the locomotive in use,\nI suppose, and it would be of little comfort to the\nmanufacturer that although the engine he has\nmanufactured has been certified as safe for use by the\nSecretary, he is liable unless he warns the engineer:\nOh, it isn't safe for use in these circumstances; I have\nto give you warning.\nI mean, I cannot imagine that that's what --\nthat that's what the statute means as applied, at least\nto the use of the engine on the -- on the tracks.\nMR. HACKER: Well, we agree with that, but\nwe also think it applies with respect to manufacturers'\nliability in the repair shop for the reason I said\nearlier. The locomotive doesn't change. So, when it's\ncertified as safe for use on line, it can't be -- and\nthe locomotive manufacturer knows everything they know\nby looking at DOT regulations. It can't be that a State\ncan come along and say: No, no, you can't use any of\nthat design; you have to use this completely different\none --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, what they're saying\nis --\nMR. HACKER: -- because this will make it\nsafe in the repair shop.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What they're saying is\nbecause when you open up the box, something no one does\non line, you will expose yourself to risk, and what we\nare saying is, therefore, you must post a notice that\ntells workers about those risks. And, indeed, if there\nis a conflict, conflict pre-emption will take care of\nit. But why should that kind of thing fall within the\nscope of field pre-emption even under Napier, which, of\ncourse, referred to equipment while this rule doesn't?\nIt refers to a sign. You're not going to change the\nequipment.\nMR. HACKER: Well, for the reason I said\nearlier, Your Honor, which is, you don't know in\nadvance. If you say, in theory, a State can adopt a\nwarning requirement specific to a design otherwise\napproved by the DOT, you don't know in advance whether\nthe warning requirements -- the manufacturers will be\nable to easily comply with all 50 different types of\nwarning requirements and whether or not the warning\nrequirements -- some will be so stringent that it will\nbe easier to simply adopt a different design. The point\nof the LIA is to take that kind of decisionmaking out of\nthe State's hands and put it into a Federal authority\nwhich can make the relevant and appropriate decisions --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose --\nMR. HACKER: -- as to what designs are\nunlawful.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose the allegation is\nthere's a failure to warn workers to use a special kind\nof mask that's very important if you're working near\nasbestos. That's the claim they want. Now, are you\nsaying that the manufacturer cannot be required to give\nthat warning?\nMR. HACKER: That's correct.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Are you also saying the\nrailroad cannot be forced to give that warning in its\nrepair shop?\nMR. HACKER: The railroad can be required to\nensure the safe protection of employees that work there.\nA workplace safety claim isn't really a warning claim.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: No, no. That was my --\ncan the railroad be held liable for failing to tell the\nworker to use the mask?\nMR. HACKER: It can be under OSHA, be held\nliable for that.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Can the manufacturer be\nheld liable for failing to tell the railroad?\nMR. HACKER: No. That would be a failure\nto --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: How is the railroad going\nto know whether it's unsafe or not?\nMR. HACKER: Because they have the --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: How is the railroad going\nto know whether there's asbestos in there unless the\nmanufacturer at least tells the railroad, even it\ndoesn't have to tell the worker?\nMR. HACKER: Railroads have a duty under\nFELA to ensure a safe workplace environment. That's\nclear. And so, they have adequate incentives to ensure\nthat their employees have a safe work environment. If\nthey're -- if a worker is exposed to asbestos --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But you could -- could\nState law say you need a special kind of mask?\nMR. HACKER: Well, not under the current\nregime because FELA would pre-empt any claim by a\nrailroad worker. So, there wouldn't be -- there isn't\nroom for State law already.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: What about an independent\ncontractor who's not covered by FELA?\nMR. HACKER: Could be -- could not have a\nclaim against the manufacturer. An independent\ncontractor would not have claim against the manufacturer\nfor failure to warn.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Under State law which by\nhypothesis says you need this very special kind of mask.\nIt's required only in Illinois.\nMR. HACKER: Right. The manufacturer could\nnot be held liable under that State law. That would be\na condition on the design, an effort by the State to\nprescribe the condition, the type of design that could\nbe --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Could the railroad be held\nliable for failure to give that kind of mask under State\nlaw if it's not a FELA worker?\nMR. HACKER: If it's a generally applicable\nlaw about asbestos use, yes. I would say at some point\na law like that that's directed at a particular type of\nequipment becomes potentially conflict pre-empted\nbecause it puts a condition on the design of the\nparticular equipment. States are free to enforce\ngenerally applicable laws about safe workplace\nenvironments, asbestos handling --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Let me ask this question:\nIs it your position that the -- that the engine is as\nmuch in use when it's in the shop as when it's running\non the track? Is that your position?\nMR. HACKER: We don't have a problem with\nthat position. We don't have -- we don't have a --\nbecause we don't believe you have to establish that it's\nin use in the repair shop to establish that the\npre-emption described by Justice Brandeis in Napier\ncontrols, because the pre-emption he was describing\nwas -- the regulatory authority was over the equipment\nitself which is the same exact equipment. A railroad --\na locomotive designed a particular way doesn't change\nwhen it enters the repair shop; so, it's designed to be\nfit for service.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, the reason it seems\nto me somewhat important is that I can't conceive of 50\ndifferent State regulations for the kind of gloves and\nthings that the engineer has to wear on -- when he's\nrunning the train on the track. And if that's so, it\nseems to me it would help you to say that the shop was\nthe same, but you seem to say the shop was different.\nMR. HACKER: Well, I only mean to say that\nour position doesn't change whether or not the shop is\ndifferent because it's not -- the LIA pre-emption -- LIA\nregulation isn't about repairing. The DOT may well have\nauthority -- they seem to think not -- over repairs\nunder the LIA, but what the LIA is about is the design\nand the materials themselves. And States can't say for\nthemselves what a better or more preferable or -- a\nlocomotive design is for any other reason. The\nRespondents' brief and reply brief on page 5 makes an\ninteresting point. They think they've proved their case\nwhen they say the LIA doesn't for example permit the DOT\nto impose a U.S. steel requirement, a domestic content\nrequirement, on locomotives. The implication would be,\nof course, that a State could because it's outside the\nfield as Petitioners define it, that a State could say\nlocomotives can only be used within our State if they're\nmade of U.S. steel.\nI don't think that makes any sense at all.\nIt can't possibly be right, and the reason it's not\nright is that it misunderstands pre-emption under the\nLIA as described by Napier. Of course, it's within the\ngeneral authority of the DOT to determine that a\nlocomotive should be made with U.S. steel, but that\nauthority can be abused. It might be arbitrary and\ncapricious; it's not permissible for them to do that.\nBut the content of locomotives is exclusively within the\njurisdiction of the DOT, and States can't decide for\nthemselves that a locomotive otherwise compliant under\nFederal regulations is --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, they're -- they're\nnot saying here you have to manufacture it a certain\nway. They're just saying if you manufacture it in a\nmanner that we consider unsafe, you have to warn people.\nMR. HACKER: Well, that's part of their\nargument, but their main claim is the first one, which\nis that you are prohibited in this State from using\nasbestos. It can't happen, even though Federal\nregulations said you could. That's the main part of\ntheir claim. They have a secondary claim, which is\nfailure to warn and which we submit is essentially a\ntype of design defect claim that says if you're going to\nuse asbestos, then you have to warn.\nAnd we don't even know -- as Ms. Harrington\nwas describing, there's a lot -- there would be a lot to\nbe determined if conflict pre-emption applies to failure\nto warn in a given case. That's the whole problem, Your\nHonors, is that the LIA was saying we don't want to\nexpose manufacturers to the potential of future State\ncourt litigation.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, do we have to reach\nthis failure-to-warn problem in this case?\nMR. HACKER: I think it's presented here. I\nmean, we think it's completely caught up in the design\ndefect issue, but the other side is -- is trying to\ndefend by saying we have a design defect claim, but we\nalso have a failure-to-warn claim. But we submit the\ntwo are bound up together.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I -- if I'm\nunderstanding your argument correctly, you're saying\nthat if Napier controls the design of -- and a\nlocomotive part, that includes any design defect that's\nencompassed by State law, whether it's design in its\ntraditional sense or failure to warn.\nMR. HACKER: That's correct.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's basically what\nthe court below said.\nMR. HACKER: That's correct, and that's what\nJudge Kozinski said in the Law case, and Judge Winter\nsaid in Oglesby.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Just as a practical\nmatter, I'm assuming that some railroad repair yards are\nowned by the railroad itself, so the railroad repair\npeople are railroad employees, correct?\nMR. HACKER: I -- I think that's right, yes.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Are there some that are\nnot?\nMR. HACKER: Well, they might --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: They are not considered\nrailroad employees, but they're considered something\nelse?\nMR. HACKER: I don't -- two things I would\nsay. I don't know the answer for sure, but I think they\nprobably are, but there are also repair shops that then\n-- that are owned by other railroads, and that's part of\na problem that manufacturers have, is you don't know,\nwhen you sell the -- the locomotive to a railroad, who\nis going to be --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Just to be --\nMR. HACKER: -- repairing under what\nconditions.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Just to be clear, under\nyour view of the LIA, there could be other laws that\npre-empt it or prohibit it? States can tell railroad\nyards put signs up, wear protective equipment, do\nwhatever it is to protect the worker from this repair.\nMR. HACKER: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: They just can't tell\nthem --\nMR. HACKER: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- include a warning on\nthe brake, or to --\nMR. HACKER: Specific to the equipment\nitself.\nWhat we would say is the State has to take\nthe locomotive equipment as a given. It is what it is.\nAnd then if that locomotive equipment creates risks for\nworkers, the employer may have to do things to account\nfor those risks, but the equipment can't be regulated by\nthe State. The equipment itself can't be regulated by\nthe State in any respect.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Hacker, do you think we\nwould decide Napier the same way if it came to us today?\nMR. HACKER: I do think so, Your Honor. Of\ncourse, I don't think that matters because Napier is\nwhat it is and has been relied upon for 85 years. But I\nthink there would be a very good argument that it would\nbe decided the same way today under the Ray case that\nJustice Sotomayor mentioned. That was a very similar\nkind of delegation of regulatory authority, and the\nCourt held that there was the same kind of field\npre-emption. There are some differences one could\ndiscuss, but Napier is what it is, as I say.\nIf The Court has no further questions, I'll\ncede the balance of my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Frederick, you have 4 minutes.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT BY DAVID C. FREDERICK\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. FREDERICK: Manufacturers clearly have\nthe best information about the dangerous aspects of\ntheir products, and they issue warnings and instructions\nin manuals and provide all kinds of information so that\npersons working on their equipment are going to know the\nspecial hazards. It doesn't make sense to inoculate\nthose manufacturers from liability where they have the\nbest information to ensure that repair workers are not\ngoing to be exposed to risks.\nWith respect to the point about being on the\nline, the whole idea behind the Locomotive Inspection\nAct was not just for use, Justice Kennedy, but also safe\nto operate on the railroad line. Under the\nregulations -- and this is well established -- yard\nlimits are drawn outside the bowl where switching\noperations and repair operations occur, so that\neverybody knows where the Federal LIA standard applies\nand where it doesn't.\nAnd the reason why the LIA has had this kind\nof history with respect to repair work goes to the\nhistory of -- behind this Court's recognition of the\ncommerce power. Up until the New Deal era, it was well\nsettled that Congress could not legislate on intrastate\nactivities, which are peculiar to repair yards. And so,\nthis Court when it decided the Shanks case in the mid\n1910s held that a railroad worker could not bring an\nFELA claim because his work was not in interstate\ncommerce; it was only in intrastate commerce. And that\nis why the ICC throughout this entire period never\ndevoted regulations to repair yards, because this\nCourt's Commerce Clause jurisprudence precluded Federal\nregulatory activity for that.\nSo, if you look at this case from an\nhistorical perspective, Justice Kagan, it's not clear\nthat the full parameters of the way the Court would\nexplain Napier would be the same, because its approach\nto field pre-emption is so different after the New Deal\nera than it was before the New Deal era. And that is\nalso why when this Court looks at regulatory\nimplications of common law claims, it has had no problem\nallowing State law to have design defect claims with\nrespect to planes, cars, motorboats, and trucks, even\nthough the implications of a State law claim might find\nliability for the insufficiency of the design imposing\nan unreasonable risk to the person who is exposed to\nthat risk with respect to that interstate modality.\nThere's no reason why you have to have a\nbroad and expansive view of the field here because\nCongress subsequently has enacted in this very area to\ngive the Federal agency pre-emptive authority when it\ndeems that authority appropriate. And as the Federal\nGovernment says --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And it knows -- it\nknows about Napier and what's been going on for 85\nyears, and if it wants to pull back on the pre-emptive\neffect of the provisions interpreted in Napier, it's\nfree to do that, too.\nMR. FREDERICK: It did so, though, Your\nHonor in 49 U.S.C. 20106, where it said that unless and\nuntil the Federal Government issues a regulation in a\nparticular field, the States are allowed to have their\nrule be in effect.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But that was -- that was\nthe Safety Act, and they didn't amend the Locomotive\nAct. The Locomotive Act is what it was, and they didn't\nput that clause in it.\nMR. FREDERICK: But that's why, Justice\nGinsburg, the point here is how broadly do you define\nthe scope of the field, and Napier defined it in an\nhistorical context that we just don't live in anymore.\nAnd there's no reason to give manufacturers a complete\npass from liability when they have the best information\nto advise railroad -- railroads and railroad workers how\nto work on their equipment in a safe way without\nexposing their workers to unnecessary risks.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
