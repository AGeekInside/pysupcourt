VERRILLI, JR.,\nON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS\nMR. VERRILLI: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nCopyright infringement is the only commercially\nsignificant use of the Grokster and StreamCast services,\nand that is no accident. Respondents deliberately set out\nto capture a clientele of known infringers to stock their\nservices with infringing content, they intentionally and\ndirectly promote the infringing use of the service, they\nsupport infringing use of the service, and they directly\n--\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I just interrupt for the\none -- you said \"the only significant use.\" There's a\nfootnote in the red brief that says the figure is some 2.6\nbillion legitimate uses.\nMR. VERRILLI: Yes. Yes, Your Honor. I --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Is that correct, or incorrect?\nMR. VERRILLI: Well, I think it's an absolutely\nincorrect assertion of reality, and perhaps I could delve\ninto it and explain why.\nThe evidence in this case, which was presented\nat summary judgment, showed that 90 percent of the\nmaterial on the services was either definitely or very\nlikely to be infringing.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Now, was there a finding of 90\npercent?\nMR. VERRILLI: Well, this was submitted on\nsummary judgment, Your Honor, and we lost summary\njudgment, so the evidence has got to be construed in the\nlight most favorable to us. And the Ninth Circuit decided\nthe case on the assumption, we'd submit, of 90 percent.\nBut with respect to that 10 percent, what\nhappened, and we submit is completely wrong, is that the\nNinth Circuit drew the inference, because it wasn't shown\nby our expert study, which, by the way, is the only\nempirical analysis in the case, to be infringing, that the\nCourt could assume that it was noninfringing and then\nextrapolate from that to a number along the lines of the\nnumber that Your Honor suggested. And I think that that's\ncompletely illegitimate analysis, factually, and, besides,\nthat number is big only because the overall activity is so\nbig. The scale of the whole thing is mind-boggling. If\nthere are that many noninfringing uses --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: It goes to the --\nMR. VERRILLI: -- imagine how many infringing --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- accuracy of your statement\nthat there is no other significant legitimate use.\nMR. VERRILLI: I don't think there -- I think\nit's quite accurate on the summary-judgment record, and\ncertainly drawing the inferences in our favor, as we must\nhere on summary -- on this summary-judgment record, that\nthere is commercially significant noninfringing use.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But there could be. There\ncould be, both with respect to material in the public\ndomain and with respect to people who authorize the\ntransmission.\nMR. VERRILLI: I don't think, in the context of\nthis record in this case and the business model of these\nDefendants, Grokster and StreamCast, that that is true,\nJustice Ginsburg. I don't think that's right. I think\nwhat Grokster and StreamCast are arguing is that this\nCourt's decision in Sony stands for the proposition that\ntheir massive actual infringement is -- gets a free pass,\na perpetual free pass, so long as they can speculate that\nthere are noninfringing uses out there, such as public-\ndomain uses and authorized uses. We don't think that that\n-- that Sony stands for any such proposition.\nWe also want to point out that that doesn't help\nthem -- that proposition doesn't help them with respect to\none very significant part of this case, and that's the\nfact that they intentionally built a network of infringing\nusers, and they actively encouraged and assisted\ninfringement.\nNow, even if there are commercially significant\nnoninfringing uses, and we submit there most definitely\naren't under Sony, but even if there are, that's no\ndefense to a contributory infringement claim based on\nintentional building up of an infringing business and\nactive encouragement and assistance of infringement, and\nit can't be; because, otherwise, then the fact that they\nhad commercially significant noninfringing uses, again,\nwould be just a free pass to actively promote infringing\nuses; not merely to support them, but to promote them.\nAnd so --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: BUt, your argument, I take it,\nwould be the same if the proportions were reversed. Your\nargument with respect to -- your current argument with\nrespect to infringing use would be the same if only 10\npercent -- if it were assumed that only 10 percent of the\nuse were illegitimate and infringing. Is that correct?\nMR. VERRILLI: The active-encouragement aspect\nof our argument would be the same, certainly.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: That's right.\nMR. VERRILLI: They don't get a -- they don't\nget a free pass to encourage any infringement.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Is that the same as active\ninducement --\nMR. VERRILLI: Yes. I think there's --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- as that term --\nMR. VERRILLI: -- there's a lot of --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- is used?\nMR. VERRILLI: Yes, Justice O'Connor, there's a\nlot of lingo floating around in this case -- inducement,\nactive encouragement, assistance.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: If we should think that the\nRespondents are not liable for the type of contributory\ninfringement dealt with in Sony, could this Court reach\nthe question of active inducement on this record?\nMR. VERRILLI: Yes, very definitely. I think --\nI think the Court, of course, should find that there's\ncontributory liability under the Sony theory --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: I know you do, but --\nMR. VERRILLI: -- but with respect to --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- I just said --\nMR. VERRILLI: -- that theory --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- could you --\nMR. VERRILLI: Yes.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- assume, for a moment, that\nwe didn't; could we, nonetheless, address the active\ninducement --\nMR. VERRILLI: Yes, Justice O'Connor, and let me\nexplain why. The District Court in this case issued a\npartial final judgment, under rule 54(b), granting the\nRespondent's summary-judgment motions. Now, we argued for\ncontributory liability on two theories in the District\nCourt and in the Ninth Circuit. We argued that there was a\nlack of commercially significant noninfringing use under\nSony, and we've argued the inducement or active-\nencouragement theory. We argued that both theories entitle\nus to relief against the current operations of the service,\nto entitle us to damages, and entitle us to injunctive\nrelief to eliminate the harmful ongoing infringing\nconsequences of this intentionally built-up infringement\nmachine.\nThe District Court granted summary judgment\nagainst us and gave a clean bill of health, gave\nabsolution, essentially, to the current versions of the\nservices. The only thing that was left to us, as the\nNinth Circuit and the District Court -- and the District\nCourt, both, understood the law, is that we can go back\nand try to show that, with respect to specific past acts\nof infringement, if we can show that they occurred at a\ntime when we had given them notice that they were about to\noccur, and that we had the power to -- and they had the\npower to stop them at the moment we gave them the notice,\nthat we can get damages for those specific things, and\nthose specific things only. That's all that's left in\nthis case. And I think it's quite clear, from the Rule\n54(b) certification order of the District Court that it\nwas only damages with the past services and the past acts\n--\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: It's not clear -- it's not\nclear to me from your brief, focusing on the contributory\naspect of it, not -- and not the inducement part of it --\nit's not clear to me from your brief what your test is.\nWhat do we tell the trier of fact, that if there is a\nsubstantial part of the use which is noninfringement, if\nthere's any part?\nMR. VERRILLI: Here's what I -- here's where I\nthink the test --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Leaving aside the inducement.\nMR. VERRILLI: Right. Here's what I -- here's\nwhat we think the test is on the -- what we'll call the\nSony aspect of the case, that it's -- the question here is\n-- Sony poses to us -- is really a touchstone kind of\nquestion, not a numerical kind of question. The question\nunder Sony is whether this is a business that is\nsubstantially unrelated to infringement. In other words,\nare they building their business on supporting legitimate\nactivity, or, instead, are they building their business\nsupporting infringing activity?\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, then we just throw this\nto the birds on the trier of fact in every case --\nMR. VERRILLI: No, I think --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, how do we know --\nMR. VERRILLI: And that's where you start.\nThat's the touchstone. Now, the numbers, the relative\nproportions of use, are relevant. In a case like Sony\nitself, certainly, where the majority use was\nnoninfringing, that's a legitimate business; you don't\nneed to go further. In a case like this one, where,\ntaking the record at summary judgeent in our favor, as it\nmust be, and the Ninth Circuit's assumption that you've\ngot 90 percent infringing use, billions and billions of\nacts of infringing use, and minuscule actual noninfringing\nuse, it seems to us it's just --\nJUSTICE BREYER: You're not saying -- now you're\nusing different tests. Your test is \"substantial.\" All\nright, on your test, are we sure, if you were the counsel\nto Mr. Carlson, that you recommend going ahead with the\nXerox machine? Are you sure, if you were the counsel to\nthe creator of the VCR, that you could recommend, given\nthe use, copying movies, that we should ever have a VCR?\nAre you sure that you could recommend to the iPod inventor\nthat he could go ahead and have an iPod, or, for that\nmatter, Gutenberg, the press? I mean, you see the\nproblem.\nMR. VERRILLI: Yes, I think my answer to --\nJUSTICE BREYER: What's the answer?\nMR. VERRILLI: -- those questions are: yes, yes,\nyes, and yes.\n[Laughter.]\nJUSTICE BREYER: Because in each case -- for all\nI know, the monks had a fit when Gutenberg made his press\n--\n[Laughter.]\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- but the problem, of course,\nis that it could well be, in each of those instances, that\nthere will be vast numbers of infringing uses that are\nforeseeable.\nMR. VERRILLI: I disagree with that, Your Honor.\nCertainly not -- I don't think there's any empirical\nevidence to suggest, with respect to any of the things\nthat Your Honor just identified -- and let me pick out the\niPod as one, because it's the most current example, I\nguess. From the moment that device was introduced, it was\nobvious that there were very significant lawful commercial\nuses for it. And let me clarify something I think is\nunclear from the amicus briefs. The record companies, my\nclients, have said, for some time now, and it's been on\ntheir Website for some time now, that it's perfectly\nlawful to take a CD that you've purchased, upload it onto\nyour computer, put it onto your iPod. There is a very,\nvery significant lawful commercial use for that device,\ngoing forward.\nAnd, remember, I -- what our test -- our test is\nnot \"substantial.\" Our test is that it's a -- it's a --\nwhen it's a vast-majority use, like here, it's a clear\ncase of contribution --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: How do you -- how do you know,\ngoing in, Mr. Verrilli? I mean, I'm about to start the\nbusiness. How much time do you give me to bring up the\nlawful use to the level where it will outweigh the\nunlawful use? I have to know, going in.\nMR. VERRILLI: Well, I --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And it's one thing to sit back\nand, you know, calculate with this ongoing business, it's\n90 percent/10 percent. But I'm a new inventor, and I'm --\nyou know --\nMR. VERRILLI: I think the weight --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- I'm going to get sued right\naway. I know I'm going to get sued right away, before I\nhave a chance to build up a business.\nMR. VERRILLI: I don't think that's right, Your\nHonor, and here's why. To -- it's not just the absence of\ncommercially significant noninfringing uses that\ndemonstrates contributory infringement. I mean, you have\nto demonstrate that you're making a material contribution,\nwith knowledge that you're doing so. The inventor, at the\noutset, is not in that position. They're not making a\ncontribution with knowledge that they're doing so. Do\nthey have absolute certainty? No, they don't have\nabsolute certainty.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I don't quite understand\nthe -- I take it, inventors are profit-motive-driven, and\nif they know that something they're working on is going to\nhave copyright experience, you -- have got copyright\nproblems, you can't just say, \"Oh, well, the inventor's\ngoing to invent anyway.\"\nMR. VERRILLI: Well, I -- but the problem --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Or did I misunderstand your --\nMR. VERRILLI: No, I -- I think that you have --\nto show contribution, you should have -- you have to be\nmaking a material contribution, with knowledge that you're\ndoing so. And so --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But the inventor of Xerox does\nthat. I mean, he puts out the machine. He knows some --\nhe knows a lot of people are going to use it to Xerox\nbooks.\nMR. VERRILLI: I don't think that's right,\nJustice Scalia. I don't think there's anywhere close to a\nshowing -- I don't think there could be anywhere close to\na showing that you've got the vast majority of use from --\nfor infringement from the time that the device comes out.\nI just don't think that's --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, let's go --\nMR. VERRILLI: -- realistic.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- let's go from Xerox back to\nyour iPod. How is that clear in the iPod case? I may not\nunderstand what people are doing out there, but it's\ncertainly not clear to me. I know perfectly well I could\ngo out and buy a CD and put it on my iPod, but I also know\nperfectly well that if I can get the music on the iPod\nwithout buying the CD, that's what I'm going to do. And I\nthink it's reasonable to suppose that everybody else would\nguess that. So why, in the iPod, do you not have this\nDamoclean sword?\nMR. VERRILLI: Well, because I don't actually\nthink that there is evidence that you've got overwhelming\ninfringing use. I just think that's -- it's not a -- it's\nnot a --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, there's never evidence at\nthe time the guy is sitting in the garage figuring out\nwhether to invent the iPod or not. I mean, that's --\nMR. VERRILLI: I think when you get to the --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- the concern.\nMR. VERRILLI: -- I think when you have vast-\nmajority infringing use, they should be on the hook. Now,\nI don't think --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay, but you're --\nMR. VERRILLI: -- you have that problem --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, but you're --\nMR. VERRILLI: -- with the iPod, and --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- you're not answering --\nyou're not answering the question. The question is, How\ndo we know in advance, on your test, anything that would\ngive the inventor, or, more exactly, the developer, the\nconfidence to go ahead? As was said a minute ago, he\nknows he's going to be sued immediately. There isn't a\nproduct performance out there, as there is in this case.\nSo, on your substantiality theory, why isn't it a foregone\nconclusion in the iPod that the iPod loser -- or developer\nis going to lose his shirt?\nMR. VERRILLI: Well, first of all, I don't -- I\nthink it's just counterfactual to think that there is\ngoing to be overwhelming infringing use of the iPod in the\nway that there indisputably is here. Second, to the\nextent you get the closer cases, it is our position, as I\ngather it is the position of the United States, that you\nlook at -- to see what kind of business model the\nDefendant is operating under. Is it a -- is it -- are\nthey marketing it for legitimate purposes? Are they\ntaking reasonable steps to prevent infringement? If they\nare, then they -- then they're not liable. Third --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's your second argument, I\nthink. I thought you were going to just stick with the --\nwith the first one. I mean, that's an inducement\nargument.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, that's inducement.\nMR. VERRILLI: No, I don't think it is an\ninducement argument, because it doesn't go all the way to\nrequiring us to show, as we can show here, that they've\ngot intent. But I do think that the issue is, you know,\nreally -- in the real world, you know, it isn't the case\nthat these guys have gotten immediately sued. That's just\nnot right. And the -- and the reality is that what\nhappens is what happens here. There's perfectly valid\nuses --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But it is the case under the\ntest you're submitting to us.\nMR. VERRILLI: No, I don't think that's right,\nJustice Kennedy. If there's vast-majority infringing use,\nand you continue to operate your business with the\nknowledge that there's vast-majority infringing use, then\nyou've got liability. Now, of course, we do have all the\nadditional inducement facts here, but we've also got those\nfacts. And in the real world --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, are you dealing with\nactive inducement as just a theoretical add-on, or is that\na satisfactory way to resolve this case?\nMR. VERRILLI: I think that it is a -- I think\n--\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: I don't understand --\nMR. VERRILLI: Neither, is the answer.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- your pitch.\nMR. VERRILLI: Neither, is the answer. It is a\nbasis for resolving this case, but not to the exclusion of\ngetting the law right on Sony.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But you couldn't get summary\njudgment. Your reply brief said, \"This case is so clear\nthat we should get summary judgment.\" If inducement is\nthe theory -- you have just said, you have to show intent\n--\nMR. VERRILLI: Yes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- so you could not --\nMR. VERRILLI: We --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- you'd have to go to trial.\nMR. VERRILLI: We agree with that. We think, in\na situation where the vast majority of the use is\ninfringing and there isn't any evidence of a legitimate\nbusiness plan, on the Sony part of the case we would be\nentitled to summary judgment. We agree with you, Your\nHonor, that with respect to --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Sony itself had a trial --\nMR. VERRILLI: That's right.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- a full trial.\nMR. VERRILLI: It came after the trial, that's\nright. But the -- a key point I think I want to make here\nis that this is not about this technology. What happens\nin the real world is that inventors come up with\ntechnology. Some people use it for lawful purposes and\nvalid purposes, as some people use this technology for;\nsome people abuse the technology to run business that --\nbusinesses that are devoted to expropriating the value of\ncopyrights. That's exactly what's going on in this case.\nIf I could reserve the balance of my time, Mr.\nChief Justice.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Very well, Mr.\nVerrilli.\nMr. Clement, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT\nFOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,\nSUPPORTING PETITIONERS\nMR. CLEMENT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe decision below allows companies, like\nRespondents, to build a business model out of copyright\ninfringement without fear of secondary liability. As long\nas they avoid obtaining actual knowledge that a particular\ncustomer is about to infringe a particular copyright, they\nare free to operate a system that involves massive\ncopyright infringement with full knowledge that the draw\nof the entire system for customers and advertisers alike\nis the unlawful copying. No matter much how much of that\nsystem --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, what do you think Sony\nallowed? It talked about -- if it's, what, capable of\nsubstantial noninfringing use, it's okay?\nMR. CLEMENT: That's right, Justice O'Connor.\nAnd then I think the Court explained and elaborated that\nthe test is whether or not there are commercially\nsignificant noninfringing uses. And I would say what the\nNinth Circuit did in this case is basically adopt the test\nof mere theoretical capability for noninfringing use, plus\nmaybe some anecdotal evidence.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And what -- and your test is\nwhether there's a substantial use that's lawful?\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, I think the way we would try\nto articulate it is that if the way that the business\nmodel of the particular Defendant is set up is that they\nare not involved in a business substantially unrelated\nfrom copyright infringement, that there should be\nliability in that situation. And I think in an extreme\ncase like this, where over 90 percent of the business --\nand I think Mr. Verrilli correctly describes that it's not\na minimum of 90 percent; it's over 90 percent -- because\nthe only evidence on the other side is anecdotal evidence\nthat there are such things as public-domain works.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Mr. Clement, where did\nthe 90 percent figure come from? I know we have to accept\nit because it's summary judgment, but where did it come\nfrom?\nMR. CLEMENT: It came from a study by\nPetitioners' experts of the actual operation of the\nsystem. And what they did is, they identified about 75\npercent of the works as clearly infringing works, another\n15 percent of the works were identified as very likely\ninfringing works, then there were 10 percent they just\ncouldn't tell anything about.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I thought it was just limited\nto music.\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, I think the -- it's not --\nthe system is not limited to music.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I know, but I thought the study\nwas about music.\nMR. CLEMENT: I'm not sure about that, but --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, I thought -- I mean, you\nknow, we've had 90 briefs in this, and some briefs tear it\napart, and others support it, but we also have briefs from\nthe ACLU saying you could put whole libraries within this\nsystem.\nMR. CLEMENT: Well --\nJUSTICE BREYER: The question I wanted to ask\nyou is, given that concern, that there are, conceptually\nanyway, really excellent uses of this thing, does\ndeliberate -- what is the word?\nMR. CLEMENT: Actual inducement?\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes. Because what you are\nworried about, it seemed to me that the actual inducement\nwould take care of. And if you sent it back and said,\n\"Let's have a trial on actual inducement.\" If this really\nis the extreme case you're talking about, why wouldn't the\nPetitioners here be bound to win that trial?\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, based on our review of the\nrecord -- and we haven't been able to see the entire\nrecord -- I agree with you, the Petitioners ought to be\nable to win this case on an active-inducement ground, and\nthat's a narrow way to decide the case. I do think,\nthough, this Court might have to say something about the\nSony issue before it reached that issue. And if it did\nfeel compelled to do that, I think it would be a mistake\nto sanction the Ninth Circuit's reading of Sony, because,\nyou're right, there's a theoretical possibility that\npublic-domain works can be exchanged on this system, but\nit's also true that this system doesn't have much of a\ncomparative advantage for trading in public-domain works.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, you got interrupted a\nbit. Tell us, in the simplest way you can, what test you\nthink Sony stands for and how the Ninth got it wrong, if\nyou believe it.\nMR. CLEMENT: Justice O'Connor, it stands for --\nthe test is whether or not there are commercially\nsignificant noninfringing uses. The Ninth Circuit got it\nwrong because it thought that test was satisfied by a\ncombination of two things: being able to point out that\nthere were such things as public-domain works or\nauthorized sharing of the Wilco album, for example, and\nanecdotal evidence that you could actually do that.\nNow, if that were the right reading of Sony,\nwith respect, I would suggest that footnote 23 of this\nCourt's Sony decision would have been the sum total of the\nCourt's analysis, because in that footnote the Court\nobserved that there were broadcasts of public-domain\nworks.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose the owner of the\ninstrumentality, the program, thinks that there's going to\nbe a vast area of lawful use, and he knows that there's\ngoing to be some abuse at the -- in the short term, but he\ndoes everything he can to discourage that. He says, \"This\nis a two -- P2P is going to revolutionize the way we talk\nto each other, there's things in the public domain.\nPlease don't use this for copyright.\" But he knows that\nthere's going to be some infringement, let's say that\nit'll be 50 percent of the use, in the short term. Can he\nuse the program?\nMR. CLEMENT: If it's 50 percent infringement in\nthe short run? We think, absolutely, yes.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes, that he can --\nMR. CLEMENT: He can --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- use the program.\nMR. CLEMENT: -- use the program. I mean, as we\nsuggest, if you're at a 50-50 -- I mean, if you're\nanywhere below 50 percent, we think that there should be\nno liability under the Sony standard. If you're above\nthat level and there's sufficient evidence that you're\nreally targeting infringing uses, then I think maybe there\nwould be liability. But in the hypothetical you suggest,\nthere would clearly not be liability in that situation.\nWhat we would like to suggest, though, is there\nought to be enough room for -- under the Sony test, before\nyou reach actual inducement, to capture somebody where\nthey've clearly set out, as a business model, to deal with\nthe infringing uses. And the only thing they point to are\nthe theoretical possibility, anecdotal evidence, that it\ncould be used for public-domain works.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: If there's more, they could\nbring it out at trial, could they not? The difference\nbetween your position and Mr. Verrilli, I take it, is that\nyou think there should be not summary judgment for the\nPetitioners, but a trial.\nMR. CLEMENT: I think that's a fair point,\nJustice Ginsburg. We're operating in something of a\ndisadvantage, because we haven't seen the entirety of the\nrecord. Based on the record that I've seen, I think\nthere's a close case, unless perhaps once this Court\nclarifies the legal standard, Respondents put on\nadditional evidence. I think this is a close case, where\nyou actually could grant summary judgment in favor of the\nPetitioners. But certainly we have no objection to having\na trial on the Sony issue in this case. What we object to\nis the Ninth Circuit rule, which, in every case, is going\nto obviate the need for a trial, based on a showing that\nthere are such things as public-domain works.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The inducement -- the\ninducement point doesn't get you very far. Presumably a\nsuccessor to Grokster, or whatever this outfit is called,\ncould simply come in and not induce anybody but say, you\nknow, \"We're setting up the same system,\" know very well\nwhat people are going to use it for, but not induce them.\nAnd that would presumably be okay.\nMR. CLEMENT: I think that's potentially right\n--\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Which is why you need --\nMR. CLEMENT: -- Justice Scalia --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- the Sony --\nMR. CLEMENT: -- and that's why I think it's\nimportant to preserve a role for the Sony test. And,\nagain, this Court, in Sony, could have adopted a simple\ntheoretical-capability test, but this Court, instead,\nadopted a test that required there to be shown some\ncommercially significant use for the -- noninfringing use.\nAnd even in the patent context, where I think the test is,\nand should be, more demanding, even in that context, cases\nlike Fromberg, which we cite at page 19 of our brief, show\nthat there is an analysis to make sure that the suggested\ntheoretical noninfringing use is, in fact, a practical use\nof the item.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Will you give a company ten\nyears to establish that?\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, I don't think --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, what I worry about is\nthe suit that just comes right out of the box, as soon as\nthe company starts up. Will you give the company a couple\nof years to show that it's developing a commercial use?\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, Justice Scalia, we have\nconcerns about that, as well. I don't know that we would\ngive them ten years of, sort of, free space to do as --\nfacilitate as much copyright infringement as possible. I\nthink what we would say is that when you're -- when a suit\ntargets a nascent technology at the very beginning, there\nought to be a lot of leeway, not just for observed\nnoninfringing uses, but for the capacity of noninfringing\nuses.\nI don't think, in fairness, that's what you have\nbefore you in this case, because this is a case where the\npeer-to-peer technology was out there, it was employed in\na particular way, with a centralized server, in a way that\nwas actually -- had a lot of users involved in it, and\nthey were users of the old Napster system, that had a\ndistinct character. They were using that system for\ninfringing copyrighted musical works. And then these\nindividuals come along and seek to capitalize on that\nmarket. That is their business plan from day one. And\nit's not some newfangled idea. The only newfangled idea\nhere is that if you give something of value away for free\nby ignoring the copyright laws, you're likely to draw\nconsumers to your site, and you're likely to attract\nadvertisers. But that cannot be the kind of innovation\nthat we want to further through a development of secondary\nliability into the copyright laws.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Clement, in one way this\npresents an easy case for answering Justice Scalia's\nquestion, but what about a case in which there isn't the\nNapster example to start with? Should there be some kind\nof a flexible rightness doctrine in response to suits, as\nJustice Scalia put it, against the inventor or developer\nright out of the box?\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, whether you call it a\nflexible rightness doctrine or you develop the doctrine in\na way that is very forgiving --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Congress of laches.\nMR. CLEMENT: -- a brand-new technology.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Congress of laches.\nMR. CLEMENT: Right. I mean, I think -- the way\nI would style it is to develop a substantive standard\nthat's very forgiving of brand-new technologies and allows\npeople to point to, in those situations, capabilities for\nfuture uses. I do think that --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: How would you express the --\nhow would you express that, that substantive standard that\nanticipates, just as you suggested we do?\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, I was just trying to\narticulate it, which is to say that this Court has talked\nabout the capacity for noninfringing uses. I think, with\na mature product like this, it's fair to point to how it's\nactually used in the marketplace.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr.\nClement.\nMR. CLEMENT: Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Mr. Taranto, we'll\nhear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD G. TARANTO\nON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS\nMR. TARANTO: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and\nmay it please the Court:\nBecause Respondent's software products are tools\nof autonomous communications that have large and growing\nlegitimate uses, their distribution is protected under the\nclear Sony rule. That rule should be adhered to by this\nCourt, because copyright does not generally step into the\nrole of product control, because doing so would cause\noverkill. The Sony rule safeguards legitimate uses by\nprotecting the product and --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Yes, but active inducement\nis a doctrine that's been employed to curb the intentional\nencouragement of noninfringing uses, isn't it?\nMR. TARANTO: Not in copyright law, it hasn't,\nbut that's not my primary point. My primary point is that\nit is critical, it is jurisdictionally critical, to\nseparate two separate acts, distributing the product and\nany of the past acts that the Petitioners allege\nconstituted encouragement, their synonym for \"inducement,\"\nwhich were explicitly outside the District Court ruling\nthat was certified for interlocutory appeal.\nQuestions about past acts not inherent in the\ndistribution of our product remain in --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But they are inherent. They\nare inherent. I mean, the point is that those past acts\nare what have developed your client's current clientele.\nMR. TARANTO: No, I don't think so, Justice\nScalia. The Petitioners -- this is what I think is here\nand usable about the past acts. They claim that there is\nan intent, as part of the current distribution of the\nproduct, to profit from increased use, including\ngenerically known infringing use, a point on which the\nDistrict Court and the Court of Appeals assumed to be the\ncase. Beyond that, the question whether there were\nencouraging acts, any kind of promotional activity that\nsays, \"We ask you to, and urge you to, use this product\nfor infringement,\" that is not here, because that was\nexplicitly part of the past activities, removed from the\nDistrict Court decision. And when the Petitioners sought\ninterlocutory appeal, they said, expressly, these were\n\"distinct and severable,\" in their terms -- that's a quote\n--\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But I don't --\nMR. TARANTO: -- from the past.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- understand how you can\nseparate the past from the present in that fashion. One,\nI suppose, could say, \"Well, I'm going to make inducing\nremarks Monday through Thursday, and I'm going to stop,\nThursday night.\" The sales of the product on Friday are\nstill going to be sales which are the result of the\ninducing remarks Monday through Wednesday. And you're\nasking, in effect -- you're asking us -- to ignore Monday\nthrough Thursday.\nMR. TARANTO: No, I'm not. Let me try to be\nclear. There is a theory, not present here, along exactly\nthose lines, which Petitioners are entitled to argue, back\nin the District Court, without a remand, because that\nissue remains in the District Court. It is a theory that\nsays, \"You started your business with illegitimate acts,\nyour current business is a causal consequence of that.\" I\nwill say, there is not one bit of evidence that the\nPetitioners introduced, in resisting summary judgment, in\nsupport of that theory. It is, in fact, a highly\nimplausible theory, for reasons that the District Court\ncan explain, because users of software like this switch\nreadily. There is no plausible lock-in effect to this\nsoftware. People go from Kazaa to Grokster to eDonkey to\nBitTorrent week by week. That was -- that is an available\ntheory. You would --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Then why was current -- why was\ninducement, as a current theory of recovery, even the\nsubject of summary judgment? It seems to me that to make\nit a summary judgment is implausible to a nonworldly\ndegree.\nMR. TARANTO: I'm not entirely --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I mean, I thought you were\nsaying that, so far as the inducement theory of recovery\nis concerned --\nMR. TARANTO: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- the only summary judgment\nthat was granted was with respect to current acts of\ninducement, the way the company is acting now, not the way\nthe company was acting last year. And my question is --\nif that is correct, then I don't see how summary judgment\ncould even intelligibly have been considered.\nMR. TARANTO: I think -- because as the\nPetitioners insisted when they pressed for interlocutory\nappeal, they said these were distinct and severable,\nbecause, as Justice Scalia referred to before, the\nimportant question, on a going-forward basis, is whether\nthe current set of activities -- this software, given how\nit operates, being generally distributed -- is a vendor's\n-- the distributor of that software -- secondarily liable\nbecause somebody else, tomorrow, can do exactly the same\nthing, without the baggage of any past acts.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I don't want to get us\ntoo far off the track on this question, but it just seems\nto me that what you've done before bears on what you know,\nor have reason to know, on an ongoing basis.\nMR. TARANTO: I agree with that, Justice\nKennedy, but there's no dispute about that. This case was\ndecided on the assumption, which we are not contesting\nhere, that the Respondents here knew that there would be\nwidespread infringing use of a product that they were\nputting out, and, what's more, that they intended to\nprofit from maximum use of the product, which necessarily\nwould include infringing use, which they had no ability to\nseparate from noninfringing use.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, then why don't you tell\nus what's wrong with the Government's test and with the\nPetitioner's test, the substantial-use part of it?\nMR. TARANTO: Well, I'm not entirely -- I think\nthere are several tests, and I'm not sure I followed them\nall here. We think it is critical that the Court adhere,\nfor innovation protection, to the very clear Sony rule.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: That, Mr. Taranto, is\nsomething I find very puzzling. There is a statement --\none could take it as clear -- \"capable of substantial\nnoninfringing use.\" That would be very clear, I agree.\nBut Sony goes on for 13 more pages. If the standard were\nall that clear, it would have stopped there. And usually\nwhen you're interpreting a document, one rule is, you read\non, and if you read on, you find we need not give precise\ncontent to the question of how much use is commercially\nsignificant. That doesn't sound very clear to me. Or if\nyou then read back, as a careful reader would, then you\nfind this statement that the primary use of the Sony\nmachine for most owners was time-shifting, a use that the\nCourt found either authorized or fair, and, hence,\nnoninfringing.\nSo I don't think you can take from what is a\nrather long opinion, and isolate one sentence, and say,\n\"Aha, we have a clear rule.\"\nMR. TARANTO: Well, that sentence, Justice\nGinsburg, is expressly stated to be the rule of law that\nis being applied. And then the Court went on to apply it\nto say, there are two things that satisfy the test. The\nprimary thing, of course, is what takes up most of those\n13 pages, the question whether in-home time-shifting is\nfair use, a question that was of considerable interest to\ntens of millions of individuals throughout the United\nStates. But the Court, in fact, didn't rely only on that;\nit said, \"In addition, there was this roughly 7 to 9\npercent use of authorized time-shifting.\" It wouldn't\nhave had to even talk about that if the primary use, you\nknow, was the entirety of --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Verrilli, I hope you won't\nwaste a lot of your time on this point. This Court is\ncertainly not going to decide this case on the basis of\nstare decisis, you know, whatever else is true.\nMR. TARANTO: Well, I will -- let me urge that\nthere is, in fact, considerable weight to stare decisis,\nbecause there are major technological industries that have\nrelied on the rule that derives from patent law that there\nis no, kind of, predominant-use kind of meaning to the Sony\nrule. In the patent context from which this came, all\nthere has to be, in Professor Chisum's words, is, uses\nthat are not farfetched, illusory, uneconomical for the\nuser. And the inquiry there is, is this a product whose\n-- where the same features that are alleged to cause the\ninfringement are also, in some nontrivial way, used for\nnoninfringement?\nJUSTICE BREYER: What is -- what is the answer\nto Justice Kennedy's question? I took it, whether -- for\nthe last 21 years, industry throughout America has taken\nthe standard as being approximately whether it is capable\nof substantial -- commercially significant substantial\nnoninfringing uses.\nMR. TARANTO: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I -- and the country seems to\nhave survived that standard. There is innovation. There\nare problems in the music industry, but it thrives, and so\nforth. So there is an argument for just following it,\nbecause it's what it is. But suppose it's totally open.\nWhy should that be the right test, instead of some other\ntest, like substantial use, et cetera?\nMR. TARANTO: I -- because I --\nJUSTICE BREYER: That, I think, was the\nquestion, and I'm very interested in your answer.\nMR. TARANTO: Right. Because I think any\nalternative is worse. A focus on intent to profit means\nthat virtually every business which requires money and has\nthe least bit of sensible forward-looking thinking about\nwhat the usage is going to be will be subject to\nlitigation, arguing about their knowing that a substantial\namount of the value of the product was going to be based\non infringement.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But --\nMR. TARANTO: Every --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- but what you have -- what\nyou want to do is to say that unlawfully expropriated\nproperty can be used by the owner of the instrumentality\nas part of the startup capital for his product.\nMR. TARANTO: I -- well --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And I -- just from an economic\nstandpoint and a legal standpoint, that sounds wrong to\nme.\nMR. TARANTO: Well, I'm not entirely sure about\nthat formulation. Sony clearly sold many more tapes\nbecause of the illicit activity of Library. Sony\npresumably sold more machines, maybe even priced them\nhigher, because there was a group of people who wanted the\nmachine for the illicit activity. The Apple iPod, in the\n60 gigabit version, holds 15,000 songs. That's --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So you think that --\nMR. TARANTO: -- a thousand CDs.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- unlawfully expropriated\nproperty can be a legitimate part of the startup capital.\nMR. TARANTO: No, I -- what I think is that, as\na matter of general judicially formulated secondary\ncopyright liability law, there is no better policy balance\nthat the Court can strike, and that only Congress can make\nthe judgments about what the industry-wide facts are.\nAnd I -- let me pause there a minute -- there are no\nindustry-wide facts in this record. Every citation in the\nPetitioner's brief about the magnitude of harm to the\nindustry is extra-record citation. There are 26 billion\n--\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Then perhaps there should be\na trial so it would all come out.\nMR. TARANTO: Petitioners -- it's not just that\nthey didn't have it in their brief, they did not submit\nany evidence in response to the summary-judgment motion\nthat said the rule of Sony should be applied here because\nthe magnitude of the injury to the recording industry or\nin -- someday in the future, to the movie industry is X.\nZero evidence --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, they weren't\nconcentrating on the damage to them, they were\nconcentrating on the facilitation of copying that was\nprovided. And you don't question that this service does\nfacilitate copying.\nMR. TARANTO: As does the personal computer and\nthe modem and the Internet service provider and the\nMicrosoft operating system. There's -- everything in the\nchain that makes this work is absolutely essential to\nfacilitating the copying. The question is which pieces,\nif any, and under what standard, get singled out for a\njudicially fashioned secondary copyright liability\ndoctrine.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, you said -- I think you\nwere saying -- this is something for Congress to solve;\nit's not for the Court. But the Court is now faced with\ntwo apparently conflicting decisions: Aimster, in the\nSeventh Circuit, the Ninth Circuit decision. And if\nyou're just looking at this in the abstract, you might\nsay, \"Well, it's -- isn't it odd that Napster goes one way\nin the Ninth Circuit, and this case goes another way?\"\nMR. TARANTO: Let me suggest why that's not odd\nand why the cases are not just different, but critically\ndifferent. Napster rests -- never mind the exact words of\nthe opinion -- Napster involves something more than\ndistribution of a product. Napster, the company, was\nsending out, in response to requests, \"Where is this\nfiled,\" an answer, the information, \"The file is here.\"\nEvery time it sent out that information, if it had been\ntold by Mr. Verrilli's client, \"That file may not be\nshared,\" it was, with specific knowledge to that file,\ngiving assistance. That is a classic contributory\ninfringement case based on specific knowledge of\ninfringement. And the reason --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Why isn't this a classic\nwillful-ignorance case?\nMR. TARANTO: Because willful ignorance is about\nhaving possession of information and refusing to look at\nit. This -- that does not occur here. This tool of\nautonomous communication is one in which there is no\nmother-may-I system, no chaperone, no information provided\nto us at the time that there is any request. When I ask\nfor a file from you, there is no information that goes\nback to StreamCast or to Grokster --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Sure, but I thought willful\nignorance was basically a certainty of what was going on\nwithout empirically verifying it, so as to, sort of,\nmaintain the guise of one's hands over one's eyes. And it\nseems to me, if that's what it is, that's what we've got.\nMR. TARANTO: No, I don't think so, I think, on\neither account. My understanding of where in the law\nwillful ignorance has bite is when you do have the\ninformation right in front of you, and you refuse to look\nat it. And, what's more, the change of system to an\nautonomous communication tool, where there is no\nintermediary, which is what all of their filtering systems\nwould require, getting permission in advance, the change\nof tool is not just some way of blinding oneself to the\ninformation.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, I think it would also\ninclude disabling yourself from looking at it. And so, I\nthink it's an important part of your case, that you didn't\nadopt this new system of decentralizing the file so that\nit's in the computers, out there, solely in order to get\naround Napster.\nMR. TARANTO: Right. And I think that the\nsummary-judgment record on this is -- it, I mean, doesn't\nleave any real room for dispute. Seeking --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, wait. In respect to that\n-- I mean, is it open? If you win on the question of the\nstandard, is it open, or would we have to remand it for\nthem to argue, in light of the history, in light of what\nthey do now, they, your client, with knowledge of\ninfringement, actively encouraged users to infringe\ncopyright using their -- using the Grokster technology,\nand, indeed, knowingly would include willful blindness?\nMR. TARANTO: I think --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Because -- as I had gotten that\nfrom one of these amicus briefs, you know, that's their\nstandard -- they say a willful -- of willful, deliberate\ninducement. And that, it seems to me, important that they\nbe able to argue that. Now, can they argue it, in your\nopinion, if we do nothing but affirm the Ninth Circuit?\nMR. TARANTO: I think that they can certainly\nargue, with an affirmance by this Court, that all of the\npast acts, to use the District Court's term, constitute a\nbasis for a -- inducement liability. There would be some\nlegal questions about whether there is such a thing as\ninducement liability, but they get to argue that. No\nremand is required for that.\nThe record in this case establishes that one\nreason for going to the decentralized system, without a\ncentral index and a third-party intermediary, was to --\nwas a reaction to the Ninth Circuit's Napster decision\nthat said, \"That's a legal problem.\" But it is also, I\nthink, beyond genuine dispute, for summary-judgment\nproposes, that there were other reasons. You don't have\nto have the servers to maintain. When StreamCast, in\nparticular, was running a Napster-like system, the so-\ncalled openNap system, it had ten servers, and quickly\nmaxed out and started crashing, and immediately concluded\n-- I think this is at page 789 or -- and 798 of the joint\nappendix -- we would have had to start doubling, tripling,\nquadrupling the number of services, and we didn't have --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Taranto --\nMR. TARANTO: -- the money to do it.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- can I ask -- I'm still a\nlittle puzzled about the posture of the case.\nMR. TARANTO: Yes.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Because I read the District\nCourt opinion. I think he said -- the judge said that\nboth parties agreed that there were no disputed issues of\nfact that would preclude the entry of summary judgment in\neither way, no disputed issues relative to whether to\ngrant relief. And I -- it's on page 24a of the cert\npetition. And I understand you to be saying that leaving\neverything alone, affirming would allow the case to go\nforward with your adversaries seeking damages on an\nactive-inducement theory. Am I correct?\nMR. TARANTO: Yes. I think -- all I read this,\npage 24a, to say is that both sides filed for summary\njudgment, so each one, of course, thought that there was\n-- that it was entitled to summary judgment. Each --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But it says, \"Both parties\nbelieve there are no disputed issues of fact material to\nDefendant's liability.\"\nMR. TARANTO: I think that's just because each\nside filed summary judgment. Each side filed extensive\n--\nJUSTICE STEVENS: So then your answer to my\nquestion is that, yes, if we affirm, as a possibility,\nthey could continue to seek damages on an active-\ninducement theory.\nMR. TARANTO: Yes, absolutely. And there are --\nthere are affirmative defenses that are not even part of\nthis motion that, of course, would, by themselves,\npreclude summary judgment in their favor.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And then one other --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- question I had. Does the\nrecord contain their proposed form of injunction that they\nrequested?\nMR. TARANTO: I don't think it does, beyond the\nstatement at the end of their summary-judgment pleading\nthat asked for a very general injunction, \"Stop the\nDefendants from infringing.\" I'm not aware of anything\nmore specific.\nLet me comment a bit on what the record says\nabout the substantial legitimate uses. This is not a\nquestion of simply saying --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Taranto, before you go\nback to that, I wanted to be clear on what you were saying\nwould be left over for trial.\nMR. TARANTO: Yes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Because, as I read your\nbriefing, it was, \"Well, they can argue about some bad\nthings that Grokster was doing in the past, but this\ndecision says: henceforth, what we're doing is okay. The\ncase zeroed in on now and the future, and the only thing\nthat was left open was something that is over and gone\ncould get damages for it.\" But I thought that this\njudgment gave you an okay, a green light, from now on.\nMR. TARANTO: I -- my view that -- I mean, this\nwas not talked about in these terms. I believe it ought\nto be open to the Petitioners, not only to prove that past\nacts were, themselves, illegal, but that the causal\nconsequence of those past acts should somehow reach\nforward into the current acts.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Then what is the point of the\ncurrent summary judgment?\nMR. TARANTO: The point of the current summary\njudgment is that there is -- the forward-looking\ncharacter of the activities taking place, starting in\nSeptember 2002 on forward, has been held, by itself, not\nto be a basis for --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So you're saying the summary\njudgment simply, in effect, says, \"They're not doing\nanything wrong now, but we have left open the question,\nnot merely of what they have done wrong in the past, but\nwhether what they did wrong in the past can carry forward\ninto the future\"?\nMR. TARANTO: As I say, it wasn't stated in\nthose terms, but, yes, I think that --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: That's bizarre.\nMR. TARANTO: Well, I don't think so, because --\n[Laughter.]\nMR. TARANTO: -- because the important question\nis, to the Petitioners, the entire recording and movie\nindustry, Is this set of activities, which you and I,\ntomorrow, can start engaging in, one that they can stop?\nThere are literally a handful -- on page 7 and 8 of their\nbrief --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So you're saying -- what it\nreally says is, \"There's nothing to enjoin, but there may\nvery well be something to recover for,\" --\nMR. TARANTO: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- \"even as to future\nactivity.\"\nMR. TARANTO: Yes, exactly right. And they\nwould, of course, have had to make the very implausible\nassertion, in a business in which there is no plausible\nlock-in, that somehow a set of isolated events -- e-mails\n-- a handful of e-mails out of literally, between the two\ncompanies, 1700 a day, that might have said, \"Why don't\nyou load some music up\"? -- are somehow the causal -- the\ncause of what is going on today.\nLet me say a few words about what the record\nsays about legitimate activities. Altnet is a company --\nthis is at 1169 and -70 of the joint appendix -- they say\nthat they have distributed, on peer-to-peer systems,\nhundreds of thousands of authorized songs, and, they say,\nmillions of pieces of -- of video games, leading to sales.\nThis is not a trivial number. JIVE, at page 67 to 68,\nspeaks about 250,000 peer-to-peer downloads of a music\nvideo. The Internet archive, which is talked about in the\nrecord, and if you now look at what they are on their\nWebsite, now lists some several hundred musical artists\nwith 20,000 recordings which are being put out there for\npeer-to-peer distribution. The Creative Commons is\nlicensing all kinds of things for authorized public\ndistribution. There are musical bands --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Because, I gather, that some\nartists don't make money from the records, but make money\nfrom the popularity that draws fans to their concerts.\nMR. TARANTO: My understanding --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So they're willing to give away\nthe records for free.\nMR. TARANTO: -- my understanding is \"some\" is a\ngreat understatement, yes.\nThe bands talked about at 159 and 169 to '70 of\nthe joint appendix, which have authorized their live\nconcert recordings to be traded among -- on -- to be\ntraded. The GigAmerica business is in the business of\ncompiling -- this is at 323 of the joint appendix -- of\ncompiling musical recordings and other things for\nauthorized distribution. The world of music distribution\nand video distribution and movie-trailer distribution and,\nin small instances now, text distribution, but growing, is\nchanging and making use of this extremely innovative, low-\ncost tool. The great innovation of this tool of\ncommunication --\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Mr. Taranto?\nMR. TARANTO: Yes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: In your motion for\nsummary judgment, did you ask that the Plaintiff's claim\nbe dismissed?\nMR. TARANTO: Well, we asked for judgment, in\nour favor on their claim, that our current activities\nconstituted a basis for secondary liability. I'm not sure\nif word \"dismiss\" was --\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Were there other\nclaims? You said \"on their claim.\" Were -- did they make\nother claims?\nMR. TARANTO: They had a generic claim about\nsecondary copyright liability. We made the motion -- or,\nactually, StreamCast made a motion that said, \"Let's carve\nthis piece out and talk just about whether the set of\ncurrent activities supports secondary liability.\" The\nother side eventually agreed that that was distinct and\nseverable from their claim of secondary liability as to\npast acts and as to past versions of the software, which\nhas -- which has changed.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Where does one find that?\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: (Inaudible)\nMR. TARANTO: Yes, the motion -- well, it -- the\nsimplest place, I guess, is in the June 2003 District\nCourt ruling, which is in the Joint Appendix and attached\nto the brief in opposition, ruled on the Petitioner's\nmotion for an interlocutory appeal under 1292.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But the motion itself is not\nthere to take it through the opinion of the Court?\nMR. TARANTO: No, the motion is not -- is not in\nthe joint appendix. The -- most of the motions -- in\nfact, both of our summary-judgment motions and their\nsummary-judgment motion, are in the joint excerpts of\nrecord in the Ninth Circuit, can be found in --\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: The text on --\nMR. TARANTO: -- 30 volumes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: -- the text, on pages\n23a and 24a, gives the impression that the District Court\nis disposing of the entire case.\nMR. TARANTO: That -- it may give that\nimpression on those pages. Later, the Court explains that\nit's ruling only on the current versions of the software.\nAnd then in the June 2003 order, the Court was explicit in\nsaying, \"If I haven't been clear enough, let me amend my\nJune -- my April order,\" which is what you were just\nreading from, \"to make explicit the limitation.\" And we\nquote that in our brief.\nThe great virtue of peer-to-peer decentralized\nsoftware is that it doesn't require anybody to put stuff\nonto a server and then bear the cost of bandwidth, of\nbeing charged by the Internet service provider when a\nmillion people suddenly want it. It automatically scales.\nIt -- the more people who want it, the more people will\nhave it, because it will be out there on a million\ncomputers. That is an inherent distributional economy,\ntogether with the autonomy of the user, rather than having\na kind of Mother-may-I system, with having to check every\ncommunication through some third party to say, \"Am I\nauthorized to make this communication,\" that are the\nvirtues of this system and that make it clearly capable of\ngrowing the already large hundreds of thousands, even\nmillions, of uses that this -- that these pieces of\nsoftware already enable people to do.\nOne final -- final word. We're not disputing\nthat there are, in an industry-wide way, a set of\nimportant policy issues here, though there's nothing in\nthe record about what self-help measures -- digital-rights\nmanagement, encryption, other things -- there's nothing in\nthe record what -- about that. There's nothing in the\nrecord about what kinds of real industry harm is being\ndone by this. Right? This is all citations to Websites\nin their brief. These are classic questions of predictive\njudgment, industry-wide judgments that Congress should\nmake to decide whether there is a problem in need of\nsolution, and what solutions ought to be considered,\nwhether changing the rule would have a overriding bad\neffect on other industries. And --\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr.\nTaranto.\nMr. Verrilli, you have four minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD B. VERRILLI, JR.,\nON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS\nMR. VERRILLI: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nI'd like to start by clarifying the inducement\nissue, and then explain why inducement is not enough, and\nthen have a word, if I might, about the reality of this\ncase.\nThe reason, Justice Souter, you find it bizarre\nis because a shell game is going on here. What the\nRespondent's position -- excuse me -- the Respondent's\nposition here is that we can sue for specific\ninfringements that we can show were induced by these\nspecific acts, such as e-mail support. Our position on\ninducement is that we are entitled to injunctive relief\nagainst the continued operation of this gigantic\ninfringement machine, which was built by the inducement.\nNow, I think that the Respondents have quite\nclearly said that they're -- they don't think any\ninjunctive relief is available, going forward. But we're\nentitled, under Section 502 of the Copyright Act, to\neffective relief, not merely a -- relief, judgment\nrelief, that says, \"Go and sin no more,\" but relief that\nundoes the consequences of this inducement, of this\nmassive effort to build a gigantic engine of infringement.\nAnd that is why they're just wrong about that.\nAnd you certainly can't affirm the Ninth Circuit\nand allow us to go forward with anything like that theory,\nbecause the Ninth Circuit said the only thing we can sue\nfor -- the only thing we can sue for -- is a situation in\nwhich we can show that we had knowledge of specific acts\nof infringement at a time when we could stop those\nspecific acts of infringement. So there's just no way to\naffirm and let that go forward.\nNow, why is infringement -- why is inducement\nnot enough? It's not enough because, as Justice Scalia\nsuggested, these companies already operate in the shadows,\nand a ruling here, which would be, I submit, a significant\ncutback of the Sony rule, that inducement is the only\navailable ground of liability, would just leave them to\npaper over -- you know, we do have some paper evidence\nhere, a paper trail here, but that'll just -- they just\nwon't exist next time. And it's just -- it's just not\nenough.\nAnd I submit that Sony was quite clear on this.\nSony said that the staple article-of-commerce doctrine,\nnot copyright law, generally, and not secondary liability,\ngenerally, but the staple article-of-commerce doctrine,\nthe noninducement part of the analysis, has got to strike\nan effective balance -- a real balance that provides\neffective protection of copyright, as well as protecting\nunrelated lines of commerce.\nNow, their rule is a rule of immunity. It's a\nfree pass. It says, all you've got to do is speculate\nabout noninfringing use, and you can continue with\ninfringement, ad infinitum. And that's not a rule that\nprotects innovation; that's a rule that destroys\ninnovation. It certainly destroys the innovation that the\ncreators of the copyright law is supposed to protect, and\nthat's supposed to be the effective protection part of the\nbalance that Sony said this law is supposed to strike.\nIt also -- it also deters legitimate\ntechnological innovation moving towards legitimate means\nof distributing this -- of distributing, in a digital\nformat, music and movies through the kinds of companies\nthat filed amicus briefs and that are trying to do this\nlegitimately. They are inevitably and invariably undercut\nby the kinds of businesses that Respondents and the others\nrun, so it deters innovation; it doesn't move it forward.\nAnd, beyond that, Justice Kennedy, as you\nsuggested, it isn't just that they get to use our\ncopyrighted -- the value of our copyrighted materials as\nthe seed capital, that's the whole business. That is the\nwhole business. And that's the reality here, and that's\nthe problem. They can talk about the hundreds of\nthousands, or maybe even millions, of uses, but the\nreality is that there are 2.6 billion downloads,\nunlawfully, every month. So what they're talking about as\nlawful is a tiny, teeny little fraction of what's really\ngoing on here.\nAnd the problem with the rule which they say is\na clear rule, but it obviously isn't in Sony, because Sony\nsaid, \"strike a balance.\" And the problem with that rule,\nYour Honor, is that it gives them a perpetual license to\nkeep going forward with billions and billions of unlawful\ndownloads a month. They never have to do anything to try\nto bring their conduct into conformity with law. They're\nnot in the position of that inventor that you identified,\nJustice Scalia, who has to, sort of, think through, \"What\nam I doing?\" They're just in a position where they have\nevery economic incentive in the world to maximize the\nnumber of infringing uses, because they make more money\nwhen they do so.\nNow, and with respect to the reality of this\nsituation, let me just say -- and I must beg to differ,\nJustice Breyer, with the suggestion that this industry is\nthriving. What the -- the facts are that we have lost --\nthe recording industry has lost 25 percent of its revenue\nsince the onslaught of these services. And that's\nparticularly critical, because, remember, this is really\n-- the recording business, in particular, is really a\nventure-capital business. Most of the records we put out\ndon't make money. A few make a lot of money. Well, what\ndo you think's getting traded on Grokster and StreamCast\nand the rest of them? It's the few that make all the\nmoney. So they're draining all of the money out of the\nsystem that we use to find new artists and --\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you --\nMR. VERRILLI: -- foster development.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: -- Mr. Verrilli.\nThank you.\n"
