ORAL ARGUMENT OF KEVIN K. RUSSELL
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. RUSSELL: By accepting Federal funds for
its prisons, Texas consented to suit for appropriate
relief for violations of the Religious Land Use and
Institutionalized Persons Act. The question in this
case is whether that appropriate relief encompasses
damages. If you simply asked what kind of relief is
generally appropriate against a State, the answer would
be no relief, not even an injunction, because States
ordinarily are not subject even to suit without their
consent. And so RLUIPA necessarily asks a more precise
question, and that is what relief is appropriate against
a State that has consented to be sued for violations of
this sort. Damages, for example, are perfectly
appropriate against a State that has consented to be
sued for breach of contract.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Now, what would it be,
Mr. Russell, if there were a suit under RFRA because a
Federal penal institution was not allowing for the
religious practices that the act protects?
MR. RUSSELL: In -
JUSTICE GINSBURG: In a suit under RFRA,
could there be -- would damages be an appropriate
remedy?
MR. RUSSELL: In our view they are, although
it's a different context, and we recognize that the
government disagrees with us on that. We can't point to
the Spending Clause-contract analogy that applies with
respect to Spending Clause legislation as RFRA applies
to the Federal Government. But there are other
indications, including for example the long tradition of
damages being appropriate relief for the violation of
civil rights.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, could we back up.
You are saying you could get them against the Federal
Government too, but the government doesn't think so?
MR. RUSSELL: That is our view, although we
recognize that RLUIPA is different in this respect, in
that it's a Spending Clause statute under which -- and
this Court's decision in Barnes v. Gorman makes clear
that damages are traditionally appropriate relief for
the violation of any Spending Clause statute.
Of course, there is also a tradition that
damages are for the violation of civil rights. Take
statutes like Title VI, Title VII, Title IX, section 504
of the ADA, the list goes on and on, where Congress has
created damages as the quintessential remedy to enforce
civil rights, and when Congress has subjected States to
suits under such statutes, it has always put them on
equal footing with other defendants and subjected them
to damages as well. But even beyond that -
JUSTICE SCALIA: But did it use such
language as "appropriate relief"?
MR. RUSSELL: Well, for example -
JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, that's the
question. Our cases say it has to be clear to the State
when they go into one of these schemes, it has to be
clear what liability they are subjecting themselves to.
And in these other cases I think it was clear. I don't
think it's clear with simply the word "appropriate
relief."
MR. RUSSELL: No, we are not saying that the
word "appropriate relief" in itself supplies the
clarity. It's looking at that language and the way the
court interprets statutes generally, among other things,
looking at the tradition of what constitutes appropriate
relief for a violation of this sort.
We do think that Barnes v. Gorman is
appropriate precedent in telling the court -- in telling
Texas what kind of relief is generally thought
appropriate to satisfy Congress's desire to remedy
violations of a Spending Clause statute.
We recognize, of course, that Barnes didn't
involve sovereign defendants, but the local governments
in that case had the same rights as a State would. It
just comes out of the Spending Clause rather than the
Eleventh Amendment. That is, both constitutional
provisions prohibit Congress from subjecting defendants
to damages suits under Spending Clause legislation
without their consent. And this Court has enforced that
identical constitutional right with the same clear
statement test derived from Pennhurst v. Halderman.
Even more, the contract analogy the Court
relied on in Barnes is no less apt simply because one of
the recipients is a State.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The contract
analogy, I suppose, would provide that the meaning of
the contract is interpreted against the drafter. Right?
MR. RUSSELL: That would have been true in
Barnes as well.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes. So to the
extent the State is arguing for a restrictive
interpretation, it gets at least a little help from the
fact that the Federal Government wrote the statute.
MR. RUSSELL: Well, it gets the same amount
of help that the local governments got in Barnes, which
wasn't enough. And Not only does the analogy, I think,
apply; so does the remedy. Damages are a quintessential
appropriate remedy for breach of contract by a State so
long as the State has agreed to be sued for violation of
a contract.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Russell, the State
looks at this statute and says, oh, this statute
preserves the PLRA, and under the PLRA there are no
damages without having a physical injury. So putting
the PLRA together with "appropriate relief," PLRA is
telling us it's not appropriate relief when there is no
physical injury.
MR. RUSSELL: Well, I would say two things
about that. One, keep in mind that the PLRA limitations
only apply to incarcerated individuals. It doesn't
apply to the people RLUIPA protects in State-run nursing
homes or mental health facilities. So Congress wouldn't
have been thinking that appropriate relief is defined in
some sense by the scope of the PLRA.
In addition, we think that the fact that
Congress expressly said that the PLRA applies to limit
the relief that's otherwise available under RLUIPA shows
that Congress didn't think that the PLRA itself made the
relief inappropriate. It's simply that there is some
relief that is otherwise appropriate that will be
limited in some circumstances by the PLRA.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But in the prison
setting, then, isn't it an academic question, because
there are not going to be damages anyway?
MR. RUSSELL: No, that's not true, for a
couple of reasons. One, there are many cases involving
pecuniary damages. There is destruction of religious
items that won't be subject to the PLRA limitation.
There are -- there are cases that give rise
to pecuniary claims. So there is destruction of a
religious item, a Bible or something like that.
There are also cases in which the violation
will result in a physical injury. There are cases where
people are deprived of food for long periods of time.
There is a case where a prison refused to transport an
inmate for medical treatment outside the facility
because he wouldn't take off his yarmulke. Congress, I
don't think would have thought that the PLRA limitations
rendered a damages remedy unimportant. And at the very
least -
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Does it include punitive
damages?
MR. RUSSELL: Excuse me?
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Does it include punitive
damages?
MR. RUSSELL: The statute, I think, does not
in light of Barnes, because Barnes said that you get
traditional contract remedies and punitive damages are
not a traditional contract remedy.
Beyond that tradition, though, there's also
textual cues in the statue itself. There are three of
them that I would like to focus on. I'll list them and
then discuss them.
One is the definitions section, which lumps
States in together with local governments in the
definition of "government." The second is the Federal
enforcement provision, which specifically allows suits
by the United States, but only for the equitable and
declaratory relief that the State says is the only thing
that's available under appropriate relief. And finally
is the fact that the statute separately already
authorizes suits for injunctive relief against State
officials, making the addition of suits against States
effectively surplusage unless some other kind of relief
is available against the State.
Beginning with the definitions section, this
Court recognized in the United States v. Nordic Village
that where Congress, in the Bankruptcy Act, defined
"governmental unit" to include both the United States
and a State, that Congress was making clear, quote, that
"States and Federal sovereigns are to be treated the
same for immunity purposes."
I think the same lesson comes out of the
fact that RLUIPA defines "governments" to include not
only States, but local governments, and subjects all
governments to the same cause of action for the same
appropriate relief. Congress was expressing there as
clear as it could that there was a definitional
equivalence between States and local government.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Yeah, but -- but, I mean,
that means either that the Federal Government -- that
the State government is liable for damages just as
municipalities are, or that municipalities are immune to
suit for damages just as the States are.
I mean, that -- you don't know which way
that cuts, do you?
MR. RUSSELL: Well, I will point you to
other provisions of the statute.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, maybe let's talk
about them, then.
MR. RUSSELL: Okay. One is the fact that,
as I mentioned before, the statute -- and I think the
State agrees -- already allows suits for injunctive
relief against State officials in their official
capacity. The only thing that adding States as
defendant would accomplish in light of that would simply
be a change in the caption of the lawsuit, unless States
are subject to some relief that State officials under Ex
parte Young are not.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, except this would
be a violation of a statute, not a violation of a
constitutional right. So under Ex parte Young they
couldn't necessarily get an injunction.
MR. RUSSELL: Well, I would set aside the
question of whether Ex parte Young applies of its own
force. I think by defining "officials" as a form of
government and authorizing suits for appropriate relief
against officials, I think everybody agrees that that
authorizes suits against the officials for at least
injunctive relief.
And then the question is, well, what does it
accomplish to also authorize suits against States? And
I think the obvious answer is it authorizes a damages
claim against the State. And even in light of Barnes,
the State seems to acknowledge that damages are
appropriate relief against local governments under this
statute.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I can conceive of a
case where -- where the State's violation of RLUIPA
consists of a State statute that simply deprives the
individual of his rights under RLUIPA.
What State official would you -- would you
sue? It seems to me you couldn't sue the State
legislature, so it would make sense to have an
injunction against the State.
MR. RUSSELL: I think it's common in that
circumstance to sue the State attorney general for Ex
parte Young relief, for example, if you have a
constitutional claim against the statute, as may very
well have happened in the California case, or the
governor, I guess. So I don't think that naming -
having a State as a defendant is necessary for that
purpose here.
In addition, as I mentioned before, I think
even the State acknowledges that damages are appropriate
relief against local governments, but Congress made
clear that when it intended the identity of a party to
result in a dramatically different scope of relief, it
did so expressly, and you can see that in the U.S.
enforcement provision. There, Congress specially
authorized suits by the United States and had its own
remedial provision which provides only for declaratory
and injunctive relief.
And that shows both that Congress didn't
expect courts to simply figure out that different kinds
of defendants would be subject to different appropriate
relief, but also -
JUSTICE ALITO: Isn't it argued that a
possible purpose of that was to make it clear that the
Federal Government couldn't sue a State to recover money
that had been given to it?
MR. RUSSELL: Well, the fact -- I would say
two things about that. One is Congress didn't limit
that provision to suits against States. It's anybody
who gets sued by the United States is limited to
equitable injunctive relief.
And that's, again, an example of Congress
treating States the same as everybody else. Whether
they are sued by the United States or sued by a private
party, it is the same relief. It's the same remedial
provision and we think that suggests the same relief.
That provision also kind of -- the language
of that provision, "injunctive or declaratory relief,"
stands in pretty stark contrast to the facially broader
phrase "appropriate relief" in the general provision.
In addition to RLUIPA itself, I think it's
also worth pointing out that the State had independent
notice under section 2000(d)(7) -- this is the
Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1986, where Congress
made clear to Texas that it would be subject to suit for
damages under any statute that -- under a section of any
statute that prohibits discrimination by Federal funding
recipients.
And I think the question here boils down to
whether RLUIPA is materially distinguishable from
section 504, which is listed in section 2000(d)(7) as an
example of a statute prohibiting discrimination. And
if -- I think that means that the catch-all has to at
least be broad enough to encompass section 504, and in
our view, the two statutes are not distinguishable.
Both prohibit both the kind of disparate treatment of
similarly-situated individuals that the State
acknowledges constitutes discrimination and requires
accommodations in some circumstances.
JUSTICE ALITO: You addressed the -- the
effect of the issue here on persons who are in State
institutions other than penal institutions.
What would be -- what's the effect of the
issue here on land use restrictions? Are there many
cases in which issues involving land use restrictions
are -- are raised in litigation against the State as
opposed to a municipality?
MR. RUSSELL: It's quite rare. I am aware
of one pending case in Vermont where there is a
challenge to a -- a State environmental regulation, but
for the most part it isn't.
But if this Court were to, you know,
section -- the provision that we are talking about here
applies to land use as well as to institutionalized
persons, and one would ordinarily think that the statute
would have the same meaning depending on context.
I recognize that the State's basic argument
is that the meaning changes depending on who the
defendant is, and I suppose if you accept that it could
also depend on -- on what provision is being applied.
But that's not normally how statutes work.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the answer to
Justice Alito's question is that in the land use area,
zoning for example, those are mostly cases against
municipalities or counties?
MR. RUSSELL: That is correct.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Not against the State.
MR. RUSSELL: That is correct.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: The government is going to
tell us that the standard for waiver with respect to the
Federal Government is different from the standard with
respect to the State. Do you -- I think that's what
they are going to tell us. Do you agree with that?
MR. RUSSELL: No. I actually don't
understand them to be making that argument, either. But
I know for sure that that's not our position. And the
Court's decision in Barnes I think, for example, is
entirely consistent with the Court's recent decisions,
including for example in Richlin, where it's made clear
that when you are considering the scope of waiver of
sovereign immunity, you engage in ordinary statutory
interpretation and then the sovereign is respected. If
at the end of that interpretation the statute remains
unclear, you know, certainly the sovereign wins. But -
JUSTICE KENNEDY: But it seems to me that
the States are in need of special protection. With -
with the Congress, if it's a Federal immunity, the
Congress can always -- always change its law.
MR. RUSSELL: Well -
JUSTICE KENNEDY: That just can't happen
with the State.
MR. RUSSELL: I don't know that this Court's
cases support the idea that -- that heightened clear
statement rule for States versus the Federal Government.
If anything, I think they suggest the opposite, but so
long as the statute is clear.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: It's the suggestion of the
opposite that -- that I am trying -- I am trying to
explore.
You have your white light on.
MR. RUSSELL: Thank you.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.
Russell.
Ms. Harrington.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF SARAH E. HARRINGTON,
FOR THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,
SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER
MS. HARRINGTON: Mr. Chief Justice, and may
it please the Court:
The Respondent in this case agrees that when
it accepts Federal funds for its correctional system it
voluntarily waives its sovereign immunity to private
suits in Federal court to enforce RLUIPA, and it is
clear under this Court's decisions in cases such as
Franklin and Barnes that that voluntary waiver
encompasses a waiver to suits for money damages.
JUSTICE ALITO: Suppose Congress passes a
statute that creates a private right of action against
both the Federal Government and against the States and
in both instances authorizes all appropriate relief.
Are damages available in the action against the Federal
Government as well as the State government?
MS. HARRINGTON: Well, it would depend on
the context to answer both questions.
JUSTICE ALITO: Well, the State -- the State
provision is a Spending Clause provision.
MS. HARRINGTON: Then the answer would be
yes as to the States. This Court has been clear in
cases such as Franklin and Barnes that in the Spending
Clause context, unless Congress indicates an intent to
rebut the presumption somehow -
JUSTICE ALITO: And what about the Federal
Government?
MS. HARRINGTON: In the Federal Government
probably not, although this Court has looked to
background principles in interpreting words such as
"appropriate."
JUSTICE ALITO: What sense does it make?
Other than -- I know you are representing a client and
so special pleading for your client is -- is to be
expected, but I find that very difficult to accept. If
"all appropriate relief" includes damages as against the
State that accepts Federal money, then you know, what's
good for the State should be good for the Federal
Government.
MS. HARRINGTON: Well, I would say two
things. First, in both cases what you want is a clear
statement of an intent to waive the sovereign's
immunity, either by the Federal Government or the State
government. And also that it's important to keep in
mind that in cases such as Franklin and Barnes, this
Court was construing statutes that did not say anything
about what remedies were appropriate, didn't mention
remedies whatsoever.
And so we don't rely so much on RLUIPA's use
of the phrase "appropriate relief" as we do on the
Spending Clause context.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But those cases did not
involve States, right?
MS. HARRINGTON: Those cases did not involve
States, that's true. But -
JUSTICE GINSBURG: And I think that the -
the core question here is the State -- and Justice Alito
just posed it: the State is being treated with less
dignity than the Federal Government, because your
position is that the Federal Government is shielded by
its sovereign immunity, and you say the State is not.
MS. HARRINGTON: On the contrary, as to the
dignity point, Your Honor, if -- the State voluntarily
waives its immunity when it accepts Federal funds that
clearly condition the acceptance of the funds on the
waiver of its immunity. The State in this case doesn't
contest that it has waived its sovereign immunity
voluntarily to some universe of suits to enforce RLUIPA.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: But we are talking about
general principles of interpretation and the proposition
that we are suggesting is that the State surely should
be entitled to the same dignity, the same protection
against suits as the Federal Government, and you suggest
just the opposite.
MS. HARRINGTON: No, Your Honor.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: And it seems to me that's
contrary to standard principles of the Federal -- of
protecting the Federal balance.
MS. HARRINGTON: If you were construing a
State statute that voluntarily waived its own immunity,
then you might -- we might say the use of appropriate
relief in that statute should be construed the same as
the use of appropriate relief in RFRA. But in this case
you are not talking about a State's waiver of its
immunity through its -- through statutory language. The
Court said in College Savings Bank that when a -- when a
State takes Federal funds that are conditioned on a
waiver of immunity, it is the act of accepting the funds
that is the waiver and it waives its immunity to suits
to the extent that it has noticed that it is doing so.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: But it's -- but it's only
because they accept the funds at all that the Spending
-- that the Spending Clause is even operative.
MS. HARRINGTON: That's right. But again,
it's -- it's the act of accepting the funds that are
clearly conditioned that constitutes the waiver. So
that the waiver -
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the waiver -- I mean,
on the State side they can say it says "appropriate
relief." All right; we accept that we are going to be
vulnerable to an injunction suit. But we're the State
and it's our treasury, and it is not appropriate relief.
We didn't waive it. It's not -- doesn't say in the
Spending Clause legislation that we open up our
treasury.
MS. HARRINGTON: But there is no basis in
either the Eleventh Amendment or the statutory
provisions in RLUIPA for distinguishing relief of an
injunctive nature from relief in damages against the
State. The Eleventh Amendment talks about suits in law
and in equity, and there is nothing in RLUIPA that would
give the States notice that they are waiving their
immunity to suits for injunctive relief, but not give
them notice that they are waiving their immunity to
suits for money damages. This Court -
JUSTICE SCALIA: The word "appropriate" -
the word "appropriate" would -- would suggest that to
me. If -- if I'm a State attorney general, and I -- I
know that the rule is sovereign immunity and -- and
especially with regard to raids on the State treasury, I
think it would be at least plausible that I would -- I
would read "appropriate relief" not to include monetary
relief.
And we have said -- the language from our
cases -- Lane says a waiver of sovereign immunity must
be unequivocally expressed in the statutory text and
will be strictly construed in terms of its scope in
favor of the sovereign. That's -- that's a high test.
MS. HARRINGTON: But even -
JUSTICE SCALIA: And -- and although I might
sit down and come out with a conclusion after intensive
study that yes, maybe the best reading of this statute
is that it allows money damages, I find it hard to say
that it is unequivocally expressed in the statutory
text.
MS. HARRINGTON: Well, two things if I
could, Your Honor. In Lane v. Pena, the question before
the Court was it wasn't -- it was outside the Spending
Clause context, because the question was whether section
504 of the Rehabilitation Act applied to the Federal
Government, and when the Federal Government applies,
even in the Spending Clause context, conditions on
itself there is no contract-like relationship. But the
second thing this Court said in Barnes -
JUSTICE SCALIA: You -- you deny that it has
to be unequivocal?
MS. HARRINGTON: It has to be unequivocal,
but -- but the context in which you are construing
whether -- whether the sovereign is expressing its
intent to waive its immunity is different when you are
talking about the Federal Government applying
obligations on itself than when you are talking about
the Federal Government offering money to a State in -
in exchange for its agreeing to comply with -
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But that has nothing to
do with whether the language is clear or not to
constitute a waiver. There is no principle of law that
you are articulating that says it -- it has to be -
this is not clear enough for the Federal Government, but
it is clear enough for the State. "Appropriate relief"
either has a meaning or it doesn't.
MS. HARRINGTON: Right. And again, we are
not relying so much on the use of the phrase
"appropriate relief" in the statute. What that -- the
work that does is it affirms that the background
presumption of the Bell v. Hood cases applies to proper
defendants under RLUIPA, which include State
governments.
But as this Court said in Barnes, when a -
when a recipient of Federal funds takes the funds, it is
on notice that it is going to be subject not only to the
remedies explicitly provided in the text of the relevant
legislation, but also to remedies that are traditionally
available in suits for breach of contract, and those
include compensatory damages and injunctive relief.
Now the State would have this Court turn
that presumption, in terms of traditional contract
rules, on its head by saying that this -- that this
Court should hold that the State presumptively waived
its immunity to suits for injunctive relief but not for
damages.
JUSTICE BREYER: What do you say about -- I
think I read in one of these briefs that what I think is
the most relevant similar statute, RFRA, has been held
not to encompass the same word -- not to encompass the
monetary relief, and also there was some legislative
history where people testified and told Congress at the
time that the word "appropriate" won't encompass
monetary relief. Am I remembering that correctly?
MS. HARRINGTON: Well, I would give you the
same answer I just gave, which is that we are not
pointing so much to the use of the -- using the phrase
"appropriate relief" in the statute as we are to the
Spending Clause context. And this Court has held that
when there is these conditions placed on Federal funds,
the recipient of the funds understands when it takes the
money that when it intentionally violates the conditions
to which it has agreed it will be subject to suit for
money damages.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But then you're
bracketing the State with counties and municipalities.
It really comes down to a question -- who decides
whether the state fisc is touched. And why isn't it
most appropriate for this Court to say, Congress can
call it either way, but our rule is, Congress, if you
want to reach the State treasury, you have to say so
explicitly. And then there is no doubt when the State
enters a contract that it's going to be subject to money
damages as well as injunctive relief.
MS. HARRINGTON: Well, this Court has
consistently applied a clear notice requirement to
conditions that Congress places on Federal funds. That
clear notice requirement arose out of cases like
Pennhurst and South Dakota v. Dole, in which there were
State recipients of Federal funds. And the Court said
that the validity of Congress's constitutional action in
exercising its Spending Clause authority depends on it
giving the recipients of the funds clear notice of the
conditions that they are agreeing to because of the
contract-like nature of Spending Clause legislation.
Now, that same rule was applied in Franklin
and Gebser and Davis and Dole, even though the
defendants in those cases were not sovereigns. It's
still the same notice requirement and there is no reason
to think that a county government would be able to
understand, would be on notice that it would be subject
to compensatory damages suits, and a State government
would not. To be sure, the State government has more to
give up. It might be a harder choice for the State
about whether to take the money or not. But the choice
is the State's, and when it says yes, I'm going to take
this money, it agrees to the conditions that are
attached to the money.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
MS. HARRINGTON: Thank you.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Ho.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES C. HO
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. HO: The phrase "appropriate relief" is
a textbook example of ambiguity, not unmistakable
clarity. And that should end the inquiry.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: If it is, why is
injunctive relief included at all? Meaning, what you
seem to be saying to me is that no relief should be
appropriate, because no relief is clear whether it's
injunctive relief or damages?
MR. HO: We agree with the U.S.'s reading of
RFRA. The same should attach here. There is an express
cause of action. So that cause of action has to do
something and we are applying to that express cause of
action the narrowest reading, which is -
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Some would say that
injunctive relief attaches more to the public FISC then
compensatory relief. Because future conduct or change
of conduct can have an enormous intrusion on the public
FISC, so why do we draw the line between saying one is
more intrusive than the other?
MR. HO: Two answers, Your Honor. The
traditional line drawing that you see in sovereign
immunity is injunctive relief. Any prospective relief
is less intrusive on sovereign immunity than any form of
retrospective relief, damages and that sort of thing.
But especially true in this context, because when you
talk about the Spending Clause, we can walk away from
injunctive relief, from an injunction at any time. We
can simply stop receiving the funds and stop accepting
the funds and the injunction evaporates, but we can't
walk away from a damage remedy. So we are construing
the express cause of action in RLUIPA, like in RFRA, to
do the judicial minimum. Which is that judicial relief
which requires states to do what we are already required
to do, which is to comply with the substantial burden
mandatory under RLUIPA. So the fact that appropriate
relief is essentially inherently ambiguous should end
the analysis, because after all, the Court is required
unmistakably clear text and rejected merely permissible
inferences for two reasons, to ensure both careful,
robust deliberation by Congress before disturbing the
federal state balance of power, as well as to ensure
clear notice.
JUSTICE BREYER: I was looking at the cases
the best I can at the moment. I think you might say
that there are a lot of cases which interpret the word
"appropriate relief" to include monetary relief. And
then there is some that don't. And to get a rule out of
them, you would have to say, well, they are looking to
context. And in context it sometimes is clear,
sometimes occasionally not. But here, isn't this and
maybe this was asked, but I want your answer. The
context here, the words appropriate relief, govern both
the prison situation and the land use situation, don't
they? You are given an action when the government
through a general land use regulation infringes
somebody's right to build, for example. Now, wouldn't
that kind of interference with the use of property quite
often and normally require some kind of monetary
compensation? This isn't just the odd thing in a
prison, where it's talking about it might be called
building a religious building or building some kind of
parking, all kinds of things that have monetary
compensation. Do you see my question?
MR. HO: I think I do, Your Honor. First of
all, we certainly agree that your premise, which is that
context matters, the Court has said specifically
appropriate relief can enlarge or contract, it could be
mean monetary or it could mean not monetary, so it does
depend on context. I confess that your question is
interesting, we are obviously focused on section 3.
JUSTICE BREYER: I know, but isn't it the
same word that governs both?
MR. HO: It is the same word.
JUSTICE BREYER: If it's the same word that
governs both and if land cases very often involve claims
for money, I would think that would cut against you.
But that's why I ask. I want to get your response.
MR. HO: Well, we are still looking for
express language in the text.
JUSTICE BREYER: But there are loads of
cases that have nothing more than appropriate relief and
in those cases context makes it clear. The only one
really I thought strongly -- your strongest case seems
to me to be RFRA.
MR. HO: RFRA certainly is the direct
context from which the words appropriate relief in this
statute are drawn. And RFRA, of course, is land use,
it's prisons, it's anything, RFRA applies to the federal
government or any activity under the sun.
JUSTICE BREYER: Uh-huh.
MR. HO: So for that reason alone, I think
we might resist the notion that the specific uses of
appropriate relief in RLUIPA would somehow provide any
sort of change or certainly any expectation that we
would have or that Congress would have, for that matter,
that the words appropriate relief would take on a new
meaning just because it's land use.
JUSTICE BREYER: I mean, so often, what I'm
thinking of, a church wands to build, and they can't
because of a land restriction. And it turns out that
that land restriction violates this statute. And in the
meantime they have had to rent buildings, they have had
to maybe build somewhere else and they have had to do
all kinds of things that cost money. And that's why I
would think in that context money would be a natural
thing.
MR. HO: I'm not sure though -
JUSTICE BREYER: To fulfill appropriateness.
MR. HO: I'm actually not sure that that
would be true even in that context. Certainly anybody
might want money, but when it comes to what Congress has
indicated and what states would expect, I would imagine
that the federal government's biggest interest is in
making sure that states and other recipients use the
money for what it's supposed to be for, comply with the
substantial burden mandate. And a local government is
not doing so with regard to a church, then they should
be enjoined so that they would be required to comply
with it. If anything, damages might exacerbate the
problem just in the sense that we are now taking federal
money and applying damages to it.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought a local
government would be subject to damages. We are talking
about the state.
MR. HO: We are talking about the state,
Your Honor. To be clear, we do not actually concede
that damages would even be available against a local
government. Our point here is that simply it doesn't
matter for us, because we obviously are treated very
differently from local governments. I think they have,
both the Petitioner and U.S. have indicated that the
statute should treat state and locals the same way. The
problem with that is the Constitution obviously treats
states and locals very differently. The Constitution
treats the state and federal government in the same way,
in that both enjoy sovereign immunity and included in
that are the principles of sovereign immunity, the need
for specific waiver, not just a clear waiver, but
specific as to the scope of the waiver, and specific as
to the remedies.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So now we have three
distinctions. With respect to land use discrimination,
the Rehab Act would presumably apply. So the Rehab Act
says compensatory damages are permissible for that kind
of discriminatory claim, so now we have compensatory
damages for that. We have, potentially, compensatory
damages for local governments, but not for State or
Federal level.
We are chopping up the statute at each
stage, correct? We are treating different defendants
differently and different claims differently with
respect to the relief that's permissible?
MR. HO: That would not be our submission,
Your Honor. If we are talking about the 2000d(7)
language, all that 2000(d)(7) says if you are a
provision prohibiting discrimination, then you get the
same remedies against a State that you would get against
any other nonsovereign defendant. And if we were
representing the City of Austin, we actually would
argue -- we think we have a good argument -- that
damages would not be available even against the City of
Austin. Our point here is simply that -
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could you explain why?
MR. HO: Sure. I think if I were the City
of Austin, I would make three arguments. One, the words
"appropriate relief" are in the statute. I think
they -- the other one wants to read this as surplusage.
We would think that the words "appropriate relief"
should do something, and we note that there were several
justices who dissented in West v. Gibson, noting that
the words "appropriate relief" seemed to indicate
equitable discretion, or discretion, and therefore
equitable relief.
In addition, we will note that the words
"appropriate relief" in (4)(A) -
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But equity permits money
as well. Equity permits money as well.
MR. HO: In some limited formats, but it
wouldn't be compensatory damages in the sense that we
are talking about in this case.
An additional indication would be the fact
that the words "appropriate relief" aren't just attached
to the claim. It's attached to both claim or defense.
And of course it makes no sense to say that you can get
money damages by asserting RLUIPA as a defense.
So for all those reasons, the City of Austin
might actually have a good case that damages aren't
available even against them. Of course, it doesn't
matter for our case, because the whole point is if the
City of Austin were to lose due to Barnes and Franklin,
what we know for sure here is that Barnes and Franklin
have nothing, nothing whatsoever, to do with the States.
If I may, I would like to spend a little bit
of time on that issue.
JUSTICE ALITO: Before you do that, Barnes
and Franklin were cases involving implied rights of
action; isn't that right?
MR. HO: Yes. With the 2000d(7) backdrop,
but yes, Your Honor.
JUSTICE ALITO: Okay.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: And I'm -- this one
question may be covered, but can you give me any
examples where States have turned down money under the
Spending Clause, say we don't want it, the restrictions
are too great? Does this happen all the time, or ever?
MR. HO: Where States turn down money?
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Where States tell the
Federal Government: No, thank you, we don't want the
money.
MR. HO: It's starting to happen in Texas.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Under programs like this?
MR. HO: I don't -- I can't think of a
situation where Texas has turned down RLUIPA Federal
prison money. But there -
JUSTICE KENNEDY: I mean other States -
they say, oh, the liabilities are just too great, we
don't want it?
MR. HO: I'm not aware of any State in the
country that has turned down Federal prison funds. Of
course, if damages were somehow inflicted, if Congress
changed the law, perhaps States would start to
recalibrate that decision.
Their core argument is that we should just
extend Franklin and Barnes to States. The fatal flaw
with that argument is that the very principle on which
Franklin and Barnes apply -- are premised, that
principle does not apply to sovereigns. When Congress
passes a cause of action and is silent or ambiguous with
respect to the remedies, there is a traditional
presumption that we apply. Non-sovereigns now expect to
be subject to any possible remedy under the sun.
Precisely the opposite rule applies to
sovereigns. We know that for sure as a matter of
precedent in Lane, which rejected Franklin as applied to
a sovereign. We also know this as a more fundamental
basic principle of sovereign immunity, because when it
comes to sovereigns, we have to have not only a clear
waiver, but also a waiver that is specific to the remedy
that is being sought.
These two rules can't be reconciled. You
either can apply the traditional presumption of all
remedies, or you apply the other rule that sovereigns
benefit from.
Petitioner claims that maybe a special rule
should apply that is unique to the Spending Clause, that
maybe that's a way to get around the sovereign immunity
problem, but we submit that fundamentally misreads
Franklin and Barnes, because what's doing the work in
Franklin and Barnes isn't the Spending Clause. It's
actually quite the opposite. The Spending Clause is
cutting back against the traditional presumption.
In Franklin -- I will take each case in
turn. In Franklin, you see pages and pages of analysis
in section 2 of the opinion, where there is exhaustive
research about Bell v. Hood and the traditional
presumptions that the Court has applied for decades
under any thought of Federal power.
The Spending Clause makes an appearance in
Franklin only at the very end in section 4, invoked by
the defense as a potential reason not to apply the
traditional presumption. The court, you know, gets past
that on the grounds that the traditional presumption is
so strong that it does provide the clarity for
non-sovereigns. It doesn't indisputably apply to
non-sovereigns; why not apply it under the Spending
Clause as well?
The point, though, is it's not the Spending
Clause that does the work. It is -- it is the
traditional presumption. That has even more dramatic
force in Barnes v. Gorman. Mr. Gorman would have had a
$1.2 million punitive damage award that he would have
been entitled to, except for the fact that this was a
Spending Clause case, and that's precisely why he lost
that punitive damage award.
So put simply, yes, it could be that under
Barnes and Franklin, remedies would be clear enough in
that one context. The problem is it's not clear enough
in this context, because sovereigns present a completely
different constitutional context.
I want to address very quickly Justice
Sotomayor's question about Ex parte Young. I think you
were exactly right that Ex parte -- that our reading
isn't in any way redundant with Ex parte Young, but I
want to note an additional reason why we are not
redundant.
We need to confirm, Congress needed to
confirm, that there was in fact a privately enforceable
right, and that's why our reading in no way renders the
Ex parte Young concept redundant.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: What do you do with the
practical problem that's been brought up that if a State
is sued, it can release the prisoner, it can transfer
the prisoner, and then no relief is appropriate? That
the only way that the State is going to take its
obligation seriously is if it's exposed to compensatory
damages?
MR. HO: If a prisoner is transferred,
released, or the State simply changes its mind and gives
up and provides the accommodation, in all those
situations, the prisoner is no longer suffering from the
complaint of condition. That's why this Court's
mootness doctrines would apply.
Put another way, mootness is really just
another word for settlement, and we would think that
settlement, the State essentially capitulating and
saying: Our bad, we should have complied, we should
have provided the accommodation, that actually
vindicates the purpose of RLUIPA, and indeed, it avoids
the need for costly litigation to do so.
I want to mention briefly the U.S. -
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What's the inducement to
do it more quickly rather than to delay, to remedy the
wrong faster rather than to delay?
MR. HO: The reason to do it?
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Uh-huh.
MR. HO: Simply to avoid litigation. I
mean, the way this works practically on the ground,
prisons obviously have a lot to deal with, a lot of
security concerns. They set general policies. They may
not be aware that their policy might have an application
for a certain individual of a particular faith. If
that's brought to their attention and -
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's an ideal world,
that they'll respond, but there is an allegation that
some prisons wait until the eve of the trial after
onerous discovery on the plaintiff and after enormous
harm to plaintiffs, physical and otherwise, before they
capitulate. So what's the inducement?
MR. HO: Well, the inducement is to -
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: To move faster.
MR. HO: States are -- States are suffering
the litigation costs as well. We are not in the
business to litigate just because we want to. We have
plenty of other suits to deal with.
This very case, I think, is a good example.
Once the prisoner -- once Mr. Sossamon agreed with
respect to the salt restriction policy, we immediately
abandoned that policy, before litigation was even filed.
With respect to the U.S. cause of action
provision, there was an argument that appropriate relief
has to mean damages, because otherwise just take that
declaratory or injunctive relief language and put it
into the private cause of action. The reason that
argument doesn't work is because these are two
fundamentally different provisions.
There is (4)(F) of RFRA, which is the U.S.
cause of action, and there was (4)(A) of -- I'm sorry,
of RLUIPA -- and there is (4)(A) of RLUIPA, which is not
just a private cause of action, but also a defense. So
again, if you can imagine sticking in the words
"declaratory and injunctive relief" and putting it right
into (4)(A), it doesn't work. It doesn't make any
sense, because what person asserting a defense would
seek an injunctive relief? If you take what's -
JUSTICE BREYER: Let me ask -- get this
information from you. As I understand it, there are
some cases that find the words "appropriate relief" in a
statute to include damages and there's some that don't.
Let's look at the ones that don't.
There is some where it's pretty hard to do
it because it's in a heading called "injunction," and
that's obvious. But there are only two statutes,
really, where the courts have ever held in significant
numbers that the word "appropriate relief" does not
include money damages. One is the IDEA, the
Disabilities Act, and the other is RFRA.
Is there anything else that you've come
across?
MR. HO: Those are two great examples.
JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, but are there any
others? I mean, I just want to get down on a piece of
paper what I have to look at.
MR. HO: Sure. I think there are two -- two
great examples. I would note -
JUSTICE BREYER: All right. So you don't
have any others, I'm judging from your hesitation.
MR. HO: No, no -- I would actually -- I
would note there are two other cases -
JUSTICE BREYER: What?
MR. HO: -- that I would refer you to, and
of course discussed in the briefs. West v. Gibson which
talks about how the words appropriate relief, remedies
in that context, by definition have no fixed meaning;
they can't possibly have fixed meaning. So it has to
enlarge or contract. And prior to 1991 -- prior to 1991
amendment at issue in that case -- the Court would
unanimously agreed that appropriate relief would not
have included money damages.
Ruckelshaus provides similar guidance, in
that I think the phrase was, there was no possible -- no
comprehensible or principled meaning to the phrase
"appropriate" as attached to a remedy.
I will briefly touch on the 2000d-7 issue
unless there are questions about that. Assuming the
issue is even preserved for this Court's consideration,
2000d-7 doesn't allow relief, either. I think there are
a lot of reasons why that would be so, but I think the
simplest is simply to acknowledge the difference between
section 2 of RLUIPA and section 3.
Section 2 of RLUIPA is much like the four
provisions expressly enumerated in 2000d-7, in that all
of them have the word discrimination and more
importantly turn on the concept of discrimination. A
discrimination is an element of a cause of action under
section 2, or under any of the four provisions
enumerated.
By contrast section 3 is not. You can have
discrimination as -- as part of your fact background if
you want but it will have nothing whatsoever to do with
whether have you a valid section 3 claim or not.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: You -- you have already
addressed this but I think it's their -- the position of
your friend on the other side of the case is that with
the Spending Clause you have a contract. The State has
some extra protection, and therefore we need not be
quite so strict in -- in construing waivers -- waivers
of immunity, because you have the contract.
Can you comment on that argument? And -
and you might want to say that the Spending Clause is
potentially so sweeping that the State should have
special protection and we should be particularly careful
about the clear statement rule.
Or do you think the clear statement rule
applies with equal force whether it's a Spending Clause
or a direct regulation under say, the Fourteenth
Amendment?
MR. HO: I'll try to take each of those
points in turn.
We don't see anything in the law that
suggests that sometimes there is a clear statement rule
and sometimes there is a super-duper clear statement
rule. I think there has been some suggestion -- or
maybe there has not been any more; I'm not sure; I read
the briefs the same way, I think the same way that the
Justices did. But they seem not to be arguing that any
more.
So it should be the same standard. I -- I
certainly acknowledge that when it comes to the Spending
Clause as you wrote in your dissent in Davis v. Monroe,
that the Spending Clause if anything does raise special
constitutional considerations as a general matter,
inasmuch as the Spending Clause could be used to impose
Federal restrictions on States that they could never
dream of under Article I otherwise. RLUIPA of course is
a prime example of that.
But at the end of the day, the Spending
Clause is not doing any work with regard to providing an
assumption or presumption of remedies. Again, it's
exactly precisely the opposite. Franklin and Barnes
both articulate that it's the traditional presumption
that applies to any exercise of Federal power. That
traditional presumption is what's doing the work. The
Spending Clause if anything is a cut back. So the
notion that just invoking the Spending Clause suddenly
puts States on this fabulously clear notice, I think
just does not work.
If there are no further questions, Your
Honor?
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Ho.
MR. HO: Thank you.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Russell, you
have four minutes remaining.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF KEVIN K. RUSSELL
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. RUSSELL: Thank you.
Nearly every argument the state made here
today could have been made by the local governments in
Barnes. Ranging from the complaint that the language
like appropriate relief is too unclear, to the assertion
that they were not on notice, that by accepting federal
funds they were subjecting themselves to suits. And
that's because the local government, like any other
state, had the same right to the same clear statement
rule. Unless this Court is, in fact, going to create a
proliferation or hierarchy of clear statement rules, the
Pennhurst rule that applies in the Spending Clause
context of local governments applies in exactly the same
way to a state government under the Eleventh Amendment
and Barnes' Court construed the express private right of
action under section 504, which incorporated by
reference the remedies available under Title XI, which
this Court construed to authorize appropriate relief.
Exactly the same remedy that RLUIPA authorizes. And so
the state for the first time today has suggested that
the city of Austin is not bound by Barnes. I don't see
how they can reach that conclusion. Barnes quite
clearly says that the local government is subject to -
and is on notice that it has clear, there is a clear
statement in every Spending Clause statute that they are
subject to a damages remedy so long as they accept the
funds because of the contractual nature of the
obligation. That applies.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Was that contested in
Barnes?
MR. RUSSELL: Which part, I'm sorry.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Was the liability for
compensatory damages contested in Barnes?
MR. RUSSELL: No. The question in Barnes is
punitive.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Just punitive. And there
is a lot of discussion, the assumption that they were
liable for compensatory, but it really wasn't litigated,
was it?
MR. RUSSELL: Well, the legal principle this
Court adopted to resolve that issue was one that, I take
it, was not just a principle for that case, but that in
general, funding recipients are on notice that they are
subject to contract remedies and unless this Court is
going to back away from that as a general matter, unless
the Court is going to say that Pennhurst applies
differently in the Spending Clause context than it does
in the sovereign immunity context, I don't see how you
can come to a different result in this case.
Justice Breyer, with respect to RFRA, as far
as I know, there is only one court of appeals case that
says the United States is not subject to suits and that
was decided six years after RLUIPA was enacted. With
respect to the IDEA, there are a handful of lower courts
decisions that say damages are unavailable. Those -
they give reasons that are specific to the IDEA and the
fact that that remedial provision is part of the due
process hearing process there. In general, damages are
the quintessential appropriate relief for violations of
civil rights, and there is no reason to think that
Congress was creating in RLUIPA a second class civil
right that wasn't deserving of a remedy that Congress
has provided even against states in every other context.
With respect to the state's belief that the Eleventh
Amendment somehow prefers injunctions over damages
remedies, as counsel for the United States pointed out,
the Eleventh Amendment is no basis for that. It treats
injunctions and damages as equally offensive to state
sovereignty, and in fact, particularly in RLUIPA, where
damages are often capped significantly by the PLRA, the
concern really ought to be on the states by injunctive
relief, which will frequently have a much more
significant effect on the public FISC than a small
damages award.
And finally with the state's argument that
the words appropriate relief are too inherently
ambiguous to meet any clear statement. Well, this Court
rejected that kind of argument in West where it
construed appropriate remedy to encompass a damages
remedy by engaging an ordinary statutory interpretation,
which is entirely appropriate in this context. This
Court has repeatedly in cases like Ruckelshaus, for
example, like Richlin, relied on how statutes apply with
respect to private parties to give meaning to the
otherwise ambiguous word "appropriate" in the federal
statute waiving the federal government's sovereign
immunity. Thank you.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
