FISHER\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. FISHER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please\nthe Court:\nThe sentencing system at issue here contains exactly\nthe same infirmities that the system -- that this\nde-validated two years ago, in Ring versus Arizona. Once a\ndefendant's convicted of a felony, Washington law sets a\nstatutory cap to that a sentencing Judge may not exceed unless\nthere are facts present that are not accounted for in the\nguilty verdict. These are called aggravating facts.\nYet in Washington, just like Arizona, a Judge makes\nthese findings. And in Washington, it's even worse than\nArizona in that the standard of proof is a preponderance of\nthe evidence, rather than beyond a reasonable doubt.\nQUESTION: But it's still within the statutory\nmaximum.\nMR. FISHER: Well, Mr. Chief Justice, the statutory\nmaximum as Apprendi defines that term, as Apprendi and Ring\ndefine that term, is the highest sentence that is allowable\nbased on the facts and the guilty verdict. That -- that\nsentence in this case, is the top end of the standard range,\nit would be 53 months for Mr. Blakely. You're correct that\nWashington law labels an additional cap as what Washington law\ncalls the statutory maximum which is the ultimate exceptional\nsentence, or the ultimate enhancement that could be put\nforward. But that is simply a second cap.\nThe question that this Court in Apprendi and Ring\nasked was what is the maximum sentence to which the defendant\ncan be subjected to, based on the facts in the guilty verdict.\nAnd that is the top of the standard range.\nQUESTION: Well, I assume that if your position were\nadopted it would invalidate the Federal sentencing scheme that\nwe have.\nMR. FISHER: I don't think so, Justice O'Connor.\nQUESTION: Why not?\nMR. FISHER: Well, the big difference, the biggest\ndifference between the Federal system and Washington, is the\nFederal system is a system of court rules. Not a system of\nLegislative mandates. So when Apprendi and Ring use the term\nthe highest penalty authorized by the legislature, or the\nstatutory maximum that is easily applied to this case, because\nall of the\nQUESTION: Two wrongs -- two wrongs make a right, I\nwould say right.\nMR. FISHER: That can sometimes be the case.\nBecause the sentencing system that is at issue here, is fully\nlegislated. However, when it\nQUESTION: I can't see much difference. Your point\nis that if the same scheme that Washington has were adopted by\ncourts, it's okay.\nMR. FISHER: Well, that may well be the case,\nJustice O'Connor, I don't think you have to decide the Federal\n-- that issue in this case. But this Court's clearly held\nWilliams and lots of other cases that if a legislature leaves\nit up to individual judges to decide what kinds of facts they\nwant to consider in meting out sentences that is fully\nconstitutional.\nAnd as this Court described the Federal guideline\nscheme is Mistretta, this Court in pages 395 and 396 of that\nopinion said what we really have is just an aggregation of\nthat same individualized discretion. Just make it a little\nbit more formal in the Federal scheme.\nQUESTION: We did think a big deal in Mistretta, did\nwe not, about the fact that the sentencing commission is in\nthe judicial branch.\nMR. FISHER: Absolutely. That was the crux of the\nholding, Justice Scalia. I realize there was some\ndisagreement on that issue. However, Justice O'Connor, to get\nback to your question, the critical distinction is, if the\nlegislature is content to leave it up to judges, or the\njudicial branch to decide what factors matter and where lines\nshould be drawn, then Apprendi is not triggered in the same\nway that it is when a legislature steps in and says -- as it\nhas done in this case. We are not prepared to allow a court\nto go above a certain threshold unless it finds additional\nfacts. Unless additional facts are present.\nQUESTION: But if the guarantee of jury trial for a\nfinding of fact in Apprendi, it is to be logical, why should\nit make any difference whether the court or the legislature\nsets out the scheme?\nMR. FISHER: Well, Mr. Chief Justice, there are two\nparts of Apprendi, one is -- footnote 16 of Apprendi, this\nCourt talked about the democratic constraints that operate on\nlegislatures vis-a-vis courts. And when a legislature steps\nin and says we're not prepared to let a sentence go above a\ncertain level unless certain facts are present, that's a very\ndifferent system, than when a legislature steps in and says we\nwill let courts operate however they like underneath a certain\n-- underneath a certain system.\nQUESTION: So are you here to say if Washington\nState's legislature said that for a burglary conviction that a\njudge can sentence anywhere from 10 to 20 years. Based on the\njudge's discretion, that's perfectly okay.\nMR. FISHER: Yes, Justice O'Connor, I believe that\nthat's what the holding in Apprendi and Ring would dictate.\nQUESTION: What about the other half. You talked\nabout one half of Apprendi, what about the other half. I\nmean, the other half in effect says, when you allow fact\nfinding by judges to convert crime A into more serious crime\nB, you're making an end run around the right to jury trial,\nisn't the same thing going on here?\nMR. FISHER: Well, I think that is what's happening\nin this case, Justice Souter. And what happens is, and it\ntakes us back to Apprendi\nQUESTION: Why isn't the same -- I mean, no matter\nwhether it's happening under the -- under the immediate\nauthorization of legislation setting up the guidelines or\nlegislation that sets up, or that authorizes a component of\njudiciary set guidelines, isn't the same thing going on?\nMR. FISHER: Well, from the defendant's point of\nview you might say that it is, but there is a difference in\nthat Apprendi talks -- the baseline of Apprendi is deciding\nwhat are elements. And elements -- the wellspring of elements\nand the definition of a crime has to flow from a legislative\nfunction, a legislature or the person who makes the laws sets\nout what facts matter, or what facts don't matter.\nSo it's absolutely the case of course that Winship\nand the Sixth Amendment apply to courts just as much as they\napply to legislatures, however we need a baseline for where\nthose rights kick in, and I think that the proper baseline, or\na proper baseline would be the facts that the legislative body\nor the lawmaker has set out that matter for punishment.\nQUESTION: I guess the tough question is whether the\nsentencing guidelines, or rather the Sixth Amendment are\nunconstitutional, right?\nMR. FISHER: I think the Sixth Amendment is\nconstitutional, Justice\nQUESTION: I just wonder what is the statute in the\nguidelines case, says to the judge, Judge, you must impose a\nsentence that the commission has written unless you depart for\ncertain reasons. The Washington statute says, you must impose\nthe sentence, da, da, da. Unless and it has similar kinds of\nthings, special aggravating circumstances, for example.\nIn neither case can you go beyond the outer limit in\nthe one case, 25 years, or 10 years in the other case, the\nstatutory max in the statute. What again is the difference?\nMR. FISHER: The difference is, in the Washington\nscheme the legislature has in effect -- the legislature has\ncaught it by the sentencing grid. The legislature has enacted\nitself, all of the standard sentencing ranges.\nWhereas in the Federal scheme, the legislature, or\nthe Congress has left it up to courts to decide where the\nstandard sentencing ranges ought to fall, so long as they're\nunder an open\nQUESTION: You know the reason -- the difference is\nthat in sentence -- the Federal statute says, Judge, you must\napply the grid of sentence. And in Washington it says you\nmust apply the word eight years, unless three years, unless -\nin the other words, apply what the commission said. That's\nthe difference, right?\nMR. FISHER: I'm not sure I\nQUESTION: In the Washington statute, it says,\nJudge, if you have an ordinary case, you must sentence the\nperson to three years. But if it's not ordinary go to 10, no\nmore than 10. In a Federal case, it says, Judge, if you have\nan ordinary case, you must apply the sentence, now the\ncommission fills in that blank. But if it's not ordinary, go\nto eight years.\nSo the blank is filled by the commission in one\ncase, by the legislature in the other. The first stage blank.\nWhy does that make a difference constitutionally?\nMR. FISHER: The reason it makes a difference is\nbecause in the Washington system, in the state system the\nlegislature has, as a policy choice with democratic\nconstraints operating upon it, selected a maximum that it's\nnot prepared to let judges go above. So it's constraining the\ndiscretion of judges.\nIn the Federal system, Congress is -- you're right,\nCongress is telling judges, we want you to come up with rules\nand follow them. But it's leaving it up to the judges, the\njudicial branch, to come up with what the rules are. So the\nonly significant difference that comes out of the briefing,\nbetween this case and the Ring Case, is that -- is the state\npoints to the fact that unlike Ring, where you had 10\naggravating factors, here Washington sets out a general\nstandard, and leaves -- and says 11 -- 11 suggested\naggravators, but it calls those aggravators illustrative\nrather than exclusive. However, we believe that under a\nproper application of Apprendi that distinction makes no\ndifference.\nQUESTION: You can -- isn't the one -- isn't that\nWashington prescription, that we talked about in the Williams\ncase, leaving it almost completely up to the judge?\nMR. FISHER: It's not, Mr. Chief Justice. You are\ncorrect but if they did leave it completely up to the judge\nthat would be the Williams case, it would be a very different\ncase than this one. However, the way that the Washington law\nis written, and the way it's been interpreted by the\nWashington courts is that the eleven factors are illustrative,\nand so therefore if a court is going to depart on a factor\nthat is not one of them on the list, it has to be analogous,\nor fairly closely tied into the factors that are on the list.\nSo in the Ammons case for example which is one of\nthe first Washington State Supreme Court cases interpreting\ntheir guideline system. They said very bluntly that the whole\npurpose of this system was to take away the unfettered\ndiscretion that we had in the past and to significantly\nconstrain it.\nQUESTION: So if you prevail the jury gets the list\nof -- of all the 11 factors, plus whatever else the judge\nthinks might come up? During the trial do you have to prepare\nthem for that as well?\nMR. FISHER: Well, in a typical system, Justice\nKennedy, there are one, two, maybe three aggra proposed\naggravating factors. So what we'd be proposing is that yes,\nduring the trial the prosecutor would charge an aggravated\ncrime, and simply -- just like the deadly weapon in this case,\nthey would have charged deliberate cruelty. And the judge\nwould instruct the jury on what deliberate cruelty means.\nQUESTION: Most -- most of these cases like this one\ncome up on pleas. They don't -- they were trials, yes. And\nthe jury would be instructed, but how would -- how would it\naffect the typical case, where there's a plea? Is the bottom\nof your argument that if you enter a plea you're home free,\nfrom any enhancement, there's been no jury. You entered a\nplea before the judge, and just as in here the prosecutor says\nI'm going to recommend the top of the guidelines 29 to 53\nmonths. And you say fine I'll plead to that, and the Judge\nsays I think you deserve more, is the terminal point of your\nargument that with a guilty plea, for the system to be\nconstitutional, no jury now, just a judge, there can't be any\nenhancement.\nMR. FISHER: So long as the guilty plea does not\ninclude any stipulation to an aggravating fact, yes, the top\nwould be the standard range. However\nQUESTION: So the defendant would have to say, yeah,\nI stipulate to 31 more. Otherwise it couldn't be given.\nMR. FISHER: Well, I'm not sure it would work\nexactly that way, Justice O'Connor. I think what would work\nwould be that the defendant in this case\nQUESTION: Justice Ginsburg, yeah.\nMR. FISHER: I'm sorry. Justice Ginsburg, is that\nin this case for example the defendant would have pled guilty.\nAnd he could have said I agree that I committed deliberate\ncruelty in this case, which would raise the cap and the judge\nwould be able to do a sentence anywhere under that cap.\nQUESTION: Well, if he didn't agree to that, there\nwouldn't be a plea. I mean, if the prosecutor says, look, I'm\nclaiming an aggravator here and I want the range increased\nthat would have to be part of that stipulation, the deliberate\ncruelty would have to be part of the plea agreement. If it\nwasn't, there wouldn't be a plea.\nMR. FISHER: Absolutely, Justice Souter.\nQUESTION: Do judges typically impose the higher\npenalty where there's been a plea. It seems to me it's pretty\nhard to do that when you haven't had a trial. What does the\njudge have in front of him to, you know, to enable him to make\nthe fact finding that justifies the aggravator?\nMR. FISHER: Well, the way it works right now in\nWashington, is that if the defendant enters a plea, there's a\npresentence report that goes to the judge. The judge can\nalso, as the judge should in this case, have the victim\ntestify for example.\nHowever, Washington law specifically provides that\nif the judge wants to impose an exceptional sentence, based on\naggravating facts, and the defendant disputes the presence of\nthose facts, Washington law already provides in Section 370,\nthe Judge has to hold a hearing. And that's exactly what the\njudge -- I'm sorry.\nQUESTION: Are you saying that that hearing -- you'd\nhave to convene a jury specially -- in this case it was a\nguilty plea, and the prosecutor was satisfied with 49, 53\nmonths. The judge said I'm not satisfied. Is it your view\nwhen the prosecutor is willing to make that deal, doesn't want\nthe 30 extra months, but the judge wants it, once the guilty\nplea is made, then can the judge say, never mind, prosecutor,\nI don't like that bargain.\nAnd this -- do you have to convene a jury specially\nthen, just this jury specially to hear the evidence on whether\nthere should be -- or the\nMR. FISHER: Well, Justice Ginsburg, certainly my\ncase doesn't stand or fall on the fact that the judge is the\none that did this hearing. However, I think that in that\ncircumstance it seems a sensible result that if the prosecutor\nisn't asking for an aggravated factor and nobody's contesting\nit, then the judge ought to either be bound by the deal, or\nthe judge in the interest of justice, as he always has, can\nsay I don't think this is a fair plea.\nQUESTION: That's right, he can turn down the deal.\nMR. FISHER: Yeah.\nQUESTION: I mean, and does he only get the\npresentence report after the plea is accepted?\nit before the plea is accepted?\nMR. FISHER: I think it varies, Justice Scalia.\nQUESTION: Well, so long as he has it in front of\nhim, before he rules on the plea, he can effectively achieve\nwhat Justice Ginsburg is concerned about by simply refusing to\naccept the plea, unless the defendant is willing to confess to\none of the aggravating factors.\nMR. FISHER: That's right, Justice Scalia.\nQUESTION: So this moves the entire system. I mean\nI am now -- the light has dawned slightly -- the reason I\nguess, I'd like your view, but the defense thought like\nApprendi and pursues these cases because 95 percent of the\npeople in prison are not there pursuant to a jury trial.\nRather they're there because of plea bargaining. And it will\nwork in the plea bargaining context, though it won't work at\nall in the trial context.\nYou'd have to go and argue, my client was in\nChicago, but by the way I'd like to point out that he only hit\nthe person lightly not heavily as the -- so that wouldn't work\nat all. But you don't mind because your job everyday is plea\nbargaining. If I'm right about that, I want to know if I am\nright?\nMR. FISHER: Well, I think that you're right that\nApprendi works in plea bargaining, but with all due respect\nI'm not sure that I accept that doesn't work in\nQUESTION: Okay. Then let's go to the trial. The\nperson, as you know, robbed a bank. Used a gun, took a\nmillion dollars and not just a thousand. Brandished another\ngun, and hurt an old lady. All that's charged. You want to\nsay, my client was asleep at home, yeah. Now, how do you\ndefend yourself against all those aggravators.\nMR. FISHER: Well, Justice Breyer, the same thing\nhappens for example when there's a lesser included offense in\nthe case.\nQUESTION: Of course it does, but they're very\nlimited numbers and you can work with a few. What you can't\nwork with is five or 10, or particularly a very important one,\nbut anyway, you explain it.\nMR. FISHER: Well, as I said, the typical situation\nin Washington is more like two or three aggravators. I\nunderstand the Federal system is more complicated, but in the\nstate system, there's typically two or three aggravators and\nin fact Washington itself proves that this works. Because\nWashington has already singled out several factors they call\nsentence enhancements. Such as using a deadly weapon, selling\ndrugs within a 1000 feet of a school zone and some other ones\non the list that they already require to be treated exactly in\nthis fashion. And then things -- and I've never seen anyone\ncomplain, and with certain\nQUESTION: You know, but I'm just curious. I\nunderstand that that must be so, because you have the\nexperience. But what I'm -- what I want to know is why is\nthat a fact. If my client wanted to say he basically wasn't\nguilty of the offense, then I want to say and also he wasn't\nnear the school, or also he only used, you know, the ones you\nsay. How do you present that to a jury?\nMR. FISHER: Well, Justice Breyer, one other point\nis important here because, in many cases it's not going to be\nsuch a big problem. However, in the one state that we've seen\nthat has adopted this system essentially the fix that we think\nwould be the proper fix here in the State of Kansas, they've\nsaid that if a defendant contests aggravating factors that not\n-- they have to be proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.\nHowever, the statute also provides that in the\ninterest of justice the judge can sever the guilt phase and\nthe sentencing phase, and so if -- it puts the defendant.....\nQUESTION: I don't see the problem -- I don't see\nthe problem of challenging it. It is up to the prosecution to\nintroduce the evidence of the aggravators, right?\nMR. FISHER: That's correct.\nQUESTION: So the prosecution puts on one of the\ncustomers in the bank who says, you know, he was using a gun.\nThe defendant is not going to be testifying anyway, unless\nit's a very strange criminal trial. It seems to me what would\nhappen is exactly what would happen in a normal trial. The\ndefense counsel would seek to break down the story of the\nwitness that this person was carrying a gun. How far away\nwere you, what kind of a gun was it, what color was it. The\nsame thing that would happen in any trial it seems to me.\nMR. FISHER: Well, I think that's generally the\ncase, and that's why I said it's just like what might happen\nfor example in a lesser included case, when murder and\nmanslaughter was charged and it was the defendant's position\nthat it wasn't him. He wasn't around.\nQUESTION: Yeah, put on the witness that says I want\nto tell you -- they say he hit her with a gun and your witness\nwants to say, oh no he only he brandished a gun, he didn't hit\nher. That's quite a good witness to put on at the time that\nyou're claiming that he was across the room.\nMR. FISHER: Right. Well as I said, there are\nQUESTION: Well, sometimes works, sometimes not?\nMR. FISHER: Right.\nQUESTION: The bizarre thing about this, which of\ncourse I said I'm in the minority here. The bizarre thing is,\nit's hard for me to believe that the Constitution of the\nUnited States requires, not that it doesn't permit. But\nrequires a sentencing commission should Congress wish to take\ndiscretion, total discretion away from the judge, which of\ncourse your distinction leads to.\nIt's also very hard for me to believe that the\nConstitution of the United States prohibits Congress from -\nprohibits it from saying, you know, I don't want to leave that\nup -- to each judge to decide whether having a gun is worth\ntwo years, or five years more. I want to regularize this.\nSo those are the two dilemmas because you have to\nchose A or B, if there's something unconstitutional about\nthis.\nMR. FISHER: Well, Justice Breyer, I think the\nConstitution doesn't prevent Congress or any legislature at\nall from regularizing criminal sentencing.\nQUESTION: True.\nMR. FISHER: Sentencing guideline systems are fine,\nand Apprendi says nothing about whether legislatures can come\nin, and regiment out and separate all the factors. The only\nthing Apprendi says, is that if a sentence is conditioned on a\ncertain finding of fact, and there is a dispute about that\nfinding of fact, the defendant should have the right to have\nthe jury make that finding beyond a reasonable doubt rather\nthan have to judge.\nQUESTION: Transfer that whole -- your rationale to\nthe Federal system and you have the grand jury first indict us\nto the aggravators?\nMR. FISHER: Well\nQUESTION: Why not?\nMR. FISHER: Well, assuming the Federal system -- if\nyou're assuming the Federal system was covered by Apprendi. I\nthink that\nQUESTION: I'm saying, assuming we apply your rule\nto the Federal system, I don't know how we couldn't, quite\nfrankly. You can get a grand jury indictment for all the\naggravators.\nMR. FISHER: Well, to whatever extent a grand jury\nneeds to charge aggravated crimes I think they would need to\ncharge it and then apply\nQUESTION: Well, didn't Apprendi say that all the\nelements had to be charged?\nMR. FISHER: Yeah. Apprendi says that under fair\nnotice principles -- I'm going to stumble here a little bit.\nQUESTION: Why don't you just say yes, what's so\noutrageous about that. The man's going to be sent to jail,\nfor another five years, you're saying he has a right to have a\njury find beyond a reasonable doubt that he did the additional\nfact -- act which justifies the five years. What's so\noutrageous that that needs to be\nQUESTION: Can the grand juries indict him for that?\nMR. FISHER: I'm stumbling over the grand jury\nbecause this is a state case, and not a Federal one.\nQUESTION: Yes. But the question was, in the\nFederal system.\nMR. FISHER: Right.\nQUESTION: Obviously we've never held the Seventh\nAmendment grand jury requirement applied to the state.\nMR. FISHER: Right. But to the extent the grand\njury requirement applied it would -- the grand jury would need\nto charge the aggravator just like anything else. And as\nJustice Scalia\nQUESTION: It seems to me you're -- you may not be\ndefendant friendly in all instances. In this case, if the\ndefendant really wants to bargain for the lesser offense,\nkidnaping II instead of kidnaping I, I suppose the prosecutor\nwould say that part of the bargain is that you stipulate to A,\nB, and C. And then he doesn't have the opportunity to argue\nbefore the judge that he wasn't guilty of the aggravators. In\nother words, it could work both ways.\nMR. FISHER: Well, it can, but I think it's\nimportant to look at the injustice in this case, Justice\nKennedy. He made a deal to get kidnaping II, and didn't plead\nto any aggravators, however he got a sentence that was more in\nline with kidnaping I, based on facts that he never\nacknowledged and he disputed.\nQUESTION: Well, the cap for the kidnaping I, was\nmuch higher, and judges so often when they see aggravating\ncircumstances get close to whatever the cap is that they're\napplying. So I'm not sure\nQUESTION: Mr. Fisher, if you're -- if you are\ncorrect here, I suppose all 50 states have sentencing schemes\nthat would fall as a result, isn't that right?\nMR. FISHER: By my study, Justice O'Connor, I don't\nthink that is correct.\nQUESTION: Why not?\nMR. FISHER: Well, there are only about 17 states\nthat have guideline systems right now. By my count, only\nabout 10 of them have a system like the State of Washington's.\nThe other seven have systems where they do create standard\nsentencing ranges, but then they leave it up to the judge to\ndepart from those ranges whenever they want to based on any\nreason. Those systems I think are just fine no matter what\nthis Court says today. So I think we're only talking about\nthose 10 systems like the State of Washington's.\nQUESTION: Setting the systems for States does not\nseem to trouble us in other areas. Such as capital\npunishment, for example.\nMR. FISHER: That's right, Justice Scalia, and\nobviously this Court has thought a lot about that issue\nalready in the prior Apprendi case, as to what -- what the\neffects of its rulings are going to be.\nQUESTION: I guess I'd be afraid the effect is going\nto be enshrine the plea bargaining system forever. Because\nthat will be the only practical thing. Or to say there's a\nconstitutional requirement that you have to have a sentencing\ncommission and the legislature can't do the work itself, which\nis both undemocratic, a little hard to see why that's so -\nand produces just as much unfairness of the kind you're\ncomplaining about. Disabuse me, if you can, of these\npessimistic views.\nMR. FISHER: I'll try.\nQUESTION: You agree that it's undemocratic?\nMR. FISHER: What is undemocratic -- leaving it up\nto judges? Yes, but that's the whole point of Apprendi is\nthat the democratic constraints operate on a legislature, and\nthen when a legislature steps in, that different things apply.\nAnd when the legislature says something, as footnote 16 in\nApprendi mentioned, it's a different force than when leaving\nit up to the judges. If it's all right with the Court, I'll\nreserve the remainder of my time.\nQUESTION: Very well, Mr. Fisher.\nMr. Knodell, would you -- am I pronouncing your name\ncorrectly?\nMR. KNODELL: You are, Your Honor.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN D. KNODELL, JR.\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. KNODELL: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please\nthe Court:\nWhether the statutory maximums in the State of\nWashington is what the legislature says it is, or the upper\nend of the standard range, established only for the purposes\nof enforcing legislative limitations of judicial discretion is\nat the heart of this case. And I would suggest to this Court\nthat the answer to that question lies in the examination in\nthe way that the statute works.\nIn Washington, the legislature of course like all\nStates, initially defines the elements of a crime, and sets\nstatutory maximums. And I think if we look at the elements of\nthe crime, and look at the way they work, you will see that\nthey are substantially different, the kind of sentencing\nfactors that are dealt with in reaching aggravating, or\nmitigating sentences under the Sentence Reform Act. The\ncriminal elements apply equally in every case. They are\nnecessary and sufficient I think, as was put in the General's\nbrief, in each and every case.\nThey are mandatory, and forced to consider each and\nevery one of them, the fact finder. And there's only one\nresult. Conviction -- conviction or acquittal. There's no\nweighing of competing interests, there is no discretion.\nNow, I offer doing this -- the Washington\nlegislature then created the Sentencing Reform Act. The\nSentencing Reform Act, I would submit to you created a\nsituation in the State of Washington where we have three\nzones. There's first a standard range and I would suggest to\nyou that the word standard in the sense that it's used by the\nWashington legislature, it's used in defense as a basis of\nmeasurement.\nThe standard range is a baseline. It is a zone in\nwhich the sentencing court has absolute discretion, as you\nwill see in the guidelines themselves, and provisions, that a\nsentence within these guidelines is not reviewable. That\nthere's absolute discretion. Then in addition, in that\nQUESTION: Excuse me. The sentence is not mandated\nin the standard zone?\nMR. KNODELL: Not\nQUESTION: Just -- you can give them up to 10 years,\nbut if you want to give them two years, that's okay. And\nthat's not reviewable?\nMR. KNODELL: That's exactly right. There is no\nreview. And I would just -- you know, I would just to -- try\nto impress upon you, Justice Scalia, that the -- there is a\nrange then between the upper end of the sentencing -- of the\nstandard range, and the statutory maximum, which is the zone\nwhere the limitations -- the very minor limitations I submit\nto the Court that are imposed upon the sentencing court or\nenforced, that's the zone of limited discretion.\nThis limited discretion is limited only in two ways.\nThe court cannot -- cannot impose a sentence beyond the range\nfor reasons that the legislature considered in defining the\ncrime in the first place, and the court cannot -- cannot up\nthe statutory maximum - cannot impose a sentence because he\nbelieves that the defendant committed a more serious crime\nthan the crime of which he was convicted.\nOne of the primary purposes of the Sentencing Reform\nAct is to -- is to ensure that the defendant, the criminal\ndefendant is punished only for the crime of conviction. The\nstandard range is a baseline, the statutory maximum is a\nborderline. The baseline and the requirement that the court\nenunciate reasons for departure are simply -- they are not a\nhurdle.\nQUESTION: But may I ask you this. You point out\nthat he has to enunciate reasons. Don't the reasons have to\nhave -- don't they have to cover basically two components.\nFirst, they have to cover the component that you've alluded to\nand that is some kind of the reasoning for engaging in the act\nof discretion of going -- going above. It's got to be clear\nthat this is not just, you know, more prejudice or anything\nlike that.\nDoesn't it also have to have as a component the\nidentification, the finding of facts upon which this\ndiscretion can be exercised. Take this case as an example.\nThe basis for going above was cruelty. Unusual cruelty,\nwhatever it was. He would have to articulate the facts I\nsuppose that a gun was used, that the woman was kept in this\nbox a great deal of the time and so on. Which would make it\nsensible to say, well, yeah, there's cruelty here and that's a\nreason for doing what I'm doing.\nIt's a distinction in the case in which somebody\nkidnaps a woman, forced her into a mink coat in the back of a\nlimousine that wouldn't -- that wouldn't do it. So there -\nisn't there a fact finding component, even though the statute\ndoes not set out in advance what those facts must be or limit\nwhat they must be. They simply must be relevant to the act of\ndiscretion, but there is a fact component, isn't there?\nMR. KNODELL: There is a fact component, but if we\nlook only at the fact component, Justice Souter, we will be\ntaking a very impoverished view of what this statute does.\nObviously any sentencing decision, any discretionary decision\nis based in some degree on facts.\nBut look what happens under the Washington\nSentencing Reform Act. The court has a list of illustrative\nfactors from the legislature, it's true, but the court can\nregard -- the court can select them, cannot select them, can\ndisregard some, can regard some. It's an entirely\ndiscretionary procedure.\nQUESTION: But whatever it does select, they've got\nto be facts which at least would morally justify going above\nthe ceiling. The -- the guideline ceiling. Absent those kind\nof facts, as well as a reasoned judgment based on them, the\nceiling governs.\nMR. KNODELL: I disagree with that.\nQUESTION: Well, I don't think I understand what\nyou're talking about. No, I mean I'm missing something in the\ndescription of the system, that's what I need to have.\nMR. KNODELL: Well\nQUESTION: Can he be reversed if there's nothing in\nthe record that shows the fact -- I mean he says I'm giving\nhim another 10 years, because he used a gun. There's nothing\nin the record that shows that he used a gun. You mean he\ncannot go up on appeal and get that additional penalty\nremoved?\nMR. KNODELL: He could.\nQUESTION: Of course. Because it depends on a fact\nfinding.\nMR. KNODELL: No, I disagree with you, Judge, but he\nwould be reversed for two reasons. It would be an abuse of\ndiscretion to base the sentence -- it doesn't make it any less\ndiscretionary. It's an abuse of discretion to overturn -\nexcuse me, to impose a sentence that has absolutely no basis\nin the record.\nQUESTION: You call it an abuse of discretion, call\nit whatever you like. You know, call it piggy back. But the\nfact is if his judgment is not supported by the facts in the\nrecord, he is reversed. So he is making a fact finding.\nMR. KNODELL: Two -- let me make two points about\nthat. Discretion lies at the heart of this case. Discretion\nis the difference between a crime element and a sentencing\nfactor. I believe that that, when you take a look at how the\nstatute works, that's what is at heart -- at issue here.\nIf the -- if the judge makes a decision that's not\nbased upon the record, that's simply pure whim, that's a due\nprocess violation. That's an abuse of discretion. The second\npoint is, I\nQUESTION: It wasn't pure whim. He just made a\nmistake. He got this record mixed up with another. In fact\nthere's not enough evidence to support that fact. The\ndefendant is entitled to get that judgment reversed, because\nthat fact is essential to his being given the additional\npenalty. And as I understand what we said in Apprendi, and as\nI understand the Constitution, when you're sent to jail for an\nadditional amount of time, on the basis of a fact that is\nrequired to be found before you can be sentenced, that has to\nbe found by a jury.\nMR. KNODELL: Well, no particular fact is entitled\n-- is required to be found. It doesn't make\nQUESTION: No particular fact is entitled to be\nfound, but a fact which the judge can select from among, but\nhe has to select a fact. And whichever one he selects,\nwhether it's carrying a gun, or cruelty to the woman, or\nwhatever else. That fact has to be found by the judge and\nthere has to be support for it.\nMR. KNODELL: That process that you're describing\nwhere the judge takes a look at the case -- at the individual\nbefore him, and selects what facts are going to be relevant,\nand decides what weight to give them, and weighs that fact\nagainst competing interests in sentencing is exactly the kind\nof process that the judge went on -- went through in Williams.\nThat is a constitutional process that is not rendered\nunconstitutional\nQUESTION: Yes, but in Williams there was no\nintermediate level that he couldn't go above. There is here,\nisn't there? Under the standard sentencing system, are they\n-- did the other side misrepresenting this? I understood that\ngiven what the man admitted in the guilty plea he could be\nsentenced to what, 53 months. And not above that.\nMR. KNODELL: I disagree with that, very\nrespectfully.\nQUESTION: Without additional procedure before the\njudge?\nMR. KNODELL: There's always going to be an\nadditional procedure before the judge. There's always going\nto be a sentence hearing.\nQUESTION: Which require the judge to find a fact\nthat had not been established previously.\nMR. KNODELL: Yes. And I think that that what you\nhave to remember is that fact finding process, is not like\nfinding the criminal element because the judge is\nQUESTION: But why not, if it increases the sentence\nby five years. Why isn't it exactly the same thing?\nMR. KNODELL: That is -- it is alike only in the\nsuperficial sense, Justice Stevens, because you're -- it\nignores the process that leads to the selection of that fact\nand the way that fact is weighed, and the way it's used.\nQUESTION: But Martin -- did Martin? I thought that\nin the Washington system, if the defendant disagrees, the\njudge says I think you did this cruelly, in the presence of a\nchild, the defendant is then entitled to have a hearing at\nwhich evidence is presented and the judge has to make that\ndecision about the additional time on the basis of a record.\nAnd he has to -- he applies it, it's true, not\nbeyond a reasonable doubt, but preponderance of the evidence.\nBut it is based on a finding of fact.\nMR. KNODELL: That's correct. It's based on a\nfinding of fact, but the finding of fact is not the whole\npicture. After selecting the fact, making the finding, then\nthe judge has to determine whether it's substantial and\ncompelling. Whether this crime is atypical, whether it\ndiffers substantially from other crimes of the same type.\nThat is\nQUESTION: Whatever else he does, the fact is,\nyou're being sent up the river for an additional three years,\non the basis of a fact finding by a judge that more likely\nthan not you were carrying a gun. More likely than not you\nwere cruel to this woman. That doesn't trouble you?\nMR. KNODELL: It -- it's the same process, Justice\nScalia, that you went through in Williams. In Williams, you\nhad the judge making the determination of fact finding that\nwent beyond the -- what was\nQUESTION: But the legislature hadn't put an\nintermediate level on what he could do without the additional\nfinding, which you have here.\nMR. KNODELL: That's right. What I want to\nemphasize to you, is that that limited -- that limited\njurisdiction is for the purpose only of ensuring that the\nreasons that are multi-varied, which could be anything, do not\nviolate the principles of Apprendi, which do not lead to the\ndefendant being punished for some crime that he wasn't\nconvicted of.\nQUESTION: But it is correct that that intermediate\nlimit is something he cannot go above, unless he makes an\nadditional finding of fact? It's not been established at that\npoint.\nMR. KNODELL: That's true. And I would simply add\nhe has to make a finding of fact, he has to select which fact\nis relevant and then he's got to find that fact is substantial\nand compelling. In the same way that a sentencing judge in an\nindeterminate would do. The\nQUESTION: This is a pretty hefty -- I mean if we\nlook at it in practical terms, on the night of incarceration,\nthis was 30 months added on, right? So it was about a third\nof the total sentence?\nMR. KNODELL: That's correct. By my computation\nhowever, under kidnaping, if this had been kidnaping I, it\nwould have been more in the nature of 150 months. It would\nsubstantially exceed the sentencing cap.\nQUESTION: But he didn't plead to -- he pled to\nkidnaping II.\nMR. KNODELL: He pled and he was specifically told,\nJustice Ginsburg, that he could receive up to 10 years, and\nthat the court had the right to go up to that amount if the\ncourt found aggravating circumstances. And he knew that there\nwould be a hearing.\nSo I -- I think what's important there, is not so\nmuch what the number was, but how it was reached. If it was\nreached in a way that basically -- and I don't think mimic,\nbut was similar to the traditional sentencing process, but it\nwas simply structured by the -- structured by the legislature\nand require the judges to enunciate a reason solely for\npurpose, not as a hurdle to it, not as a prerequisite to the\nexercise of jurisdiction beyond the standard range, but more\nas a way for reviewing courts to make sure that the trial\ncourt was not infringing upon the very limited limitations of\nthe Sentencing Reform Act.\nAnd I think it's substantially different than\nApprendi. And it does not violate the Sixth Amendment and\nthat is the way that our supreme court described -- describes\nthis and interprets the Sentencing Reform Act. I think that's\ndue -- due some deference by this Court.\nIf you take a look at Baldwin, for example, you see\nBaldwin describing the process -- excuse me, as one where the\nonly restriction on the court's discretion is a requirement to\narticulate a substantial compelling reason for the imposing a\nsentence. That the guidelines are intended only to structure\ndiscretionary decisions affecting sentences that they don't\nspecify any particular result.\nAnd that makes this, I think, substantially\ndifferent from the kind of enhancements that we're involving\n-- or even the firearm enhancement that Mr. Blakely received\nhere.\nQUESTION: Are there any states, or many states,\nwhere juries hear as many as 10 factors as part of their\ndetermination, and then make special findings in the matters?\nMR. KNODELL: I don't know of any and I would\nsuggest to Your Honor that that kind of a system is really\nimpractical for a number of reasons, we take it. If we\nseparate the logistical problems here, there's some real\nstructural problems with that.\nIn a state like ours where crimes almost have to be\npled. You would basically be left with a system, where the\nprosecutor can tell the Judge, can tell the jury, dictate to\nthem what sentencing factors will or will not be considered.\nWhen you instruct the jury you have to tailor a -- some kind\nof instruction that would somehow try to approximate the kind\nof wide range in discretion the Judge has. I would suggest to\nyou\nQUESTION: I thank you, Mr. Knodell.\nMr. Dreeben, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL DREEBEN\nFOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE\nMR. DREEBEN: Mr. Chief Justice and may it please\nthe Court:\nSentencing guideline systems, like the State of\nWashington's and the Federal Sentencing Guidelines fulfil\nvaluable functions in regularizing the sentencing process, and\nare distinctly different from the systems that this Court\nconsidered in Apprendi and Ring.\nQUESTION: Do you agree that the two standards\ntogether, that if this is invalid, the Federal Sentencing\nGuidelines are invalid?\nMR. DREEBEN: Justice Scalia, the United States will\nargue if this Court applies Apprendi to the Washington\nguideline system, that it should not be further extended to\nthe administrative guidelines that are created by the\nsentencing commission.\nQUESTION: The answer is no, you don't agree.\nMR. DREEBEN: The answer is\nQUESTION: You think it is possible to uphold the\nsentencing guidelines and yet find this to be unlawful.\nMR. DREEBEN: I think it's possible and the United\nStates will certainly contend that this Court apply\nQUESTION: But you don't mean it's easily -- it's\nnot\nQUESTION: It is consistent with what we said in\nApprendi, isn't it?\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, there are some obstacles to it\nthat the Court should be aware of before it concludes that\nApprendi can easily be applied to Washington and not to the\nFederal guidelines. Under Federal law Section 3553 (b) of\nTitle 18 the sentencing courts are required to impose a\nsentence of the kind and within the range specified by the\nsentencing commission. So there is an act of Congress that\nrequires that the sentencing guidelines be applied.\nQUESTION: The sentencing commission is in the\njudicial branch.\nMR. DREEBEN: For administrative purposes\nQUESTION: That was a very important part of our\nopinion upholding the sentencing commission. It's in the\njudicial branch, because Congress said so.\nMR. DREEBEN: The sentencing guidelines themselves\nare not self-operative. They come into play for the\nsentencing courts direction, because of an independent Federal\nstatute. In addition, there are situations which Congress has\ngiven very detailed direction to the sentencing commission\nabout the type of guidelines that Congress.....\nQUESTION: How are the members of the sentencing\ncommission appointed?\nMR. DREEBEN: They're appointed by the President and\nconfirmed by the Senate. And they do not include only members\nof the Article 3 branch. In addition to that Congress has on\noccasion\nQUESTION: But they are -- the commission is in the\njudicial branch. You acknowledge that. You argued that in\nthe case, or the government argued that in the case, right?\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, certainly, Justice Scalia.\nQUESTION: It is the judicial branch.\nMR. DREEBEN: The Court held it in the judicial\nbranch but the question is, what status the guidelines have,\nnot which branch the commission is in.\nQUESTION: So what is your distinction. Look where\nI end up. Apprendi rests on a perception that where a fact is\nfound that means a longer time in jail. It's unfair, not to\nhave the jury find it. That's a true perception.\nSo if you're not going to follow that across the\nboard, there has to be a good reason for not following it.\nAnd the reason is, that if you do follow it, you end up with a\npure charge event system, all power to the prosecutor, very\nbad and unfair. Or California, indeterminate sentencing where\npeople rot forever at the judge's discretion, or a multi-jury\nsystem which is impossible to work with.\nSo that's why you can't follow the perception.\nPractical reasons. But if you're going to limit Apprendi,\nyou're then going to have to find what are - in terms of the\nprinciple, arbitrary distinction. One such arbitrary\ndistinction is it matters whether it was a group of judges\ncalled the commission or the Congress itself that set the\nlower limit before the departure.\nAnother arbitrary suggestion is going to be the one\nyou're going to suggest, and that's what I want to know what\nit is.\nMR. DREEBEN: Thank you for the lead in, Justice\nBreyer. I think that the best way for the Court to look at\nthe problem of sentencing guideline systems is to understand\nthe penalty systems fall on a continuum. At one end of the\ncontinuum are the kinds of statutes that the Court had before\nit, Williams versus New York, in which judicial findings about\nfact were critical to what sentence a defendant actually\nreceived and those findings were not subjected to a jury\ntrial, or proof beyond a reasonable doubt guarantee.\nQUESTION: Not only that but the judge didn't even\nhave to make any findings. He could have just said his name\nis Smith, so I'm going to give him 20 years.\nMR. DREEBEN: I think that that would probably have\nbeen reversed even at\nQUESTION: I don't think so at that time, there was\nvery little appellate review of sentencing on Williams that\nwas decided.\nMR. DREEBEN: Very little but sheer arbitrariness\nwould probably not have sufficed even under Williams. But\nQUESTION: Well, he was foolish enough to say that,\nyou know I don't like the way you comb your hair. But he\nwouldn't say that. He would just say, you know, 40 years.\nMR. DREEBEN: What he did\nQUESTION: He didn't have to give a reason.\nMR. DREEBEN: But what happened in fact in Williams\nis critical. The judge made findings that this defendant had\na long arrest record, he posed a future danger to the\ncommunity and he therefore deserved a longer sentence. And\nthose were facts. They were ascertained by a judge.\nAnd there's no dispute in this Court's jurisprudence\nthat facts that are ascertained by a judge, when the judge has\nwide open discretion in a long range are not subject to\nApprendi. The facts.....\nQUESTION: Not only does he have wide open\ndiscretion, but he has no obligation to make those findings.\nHe did make them in that case, but there was nothing in the\nstatute that required him to.\nMR. DREEBEN: But what the legislature expects,\nJustice Stevens, when it gives wide ranges to judges, is that\nthey will exercise their discretion based on facts to sentence\nthe most serious offenders at the top of the range and the\nleast serious\nQUESTION: That's what they expect under sentencing\nguidelines and what they expect today. It's not what they\nexpected when Williams was decided.\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, Justice Stevens, what I would\nsubmit to the Court is that when a legislature established a\nwide range, say, 10 to 30 years in prison for a particular\noffense, it expected that the judges that heard criminal cases\nwould use their experience and discretion to take into account\nall of the circumstances of the offense and the offender and\ndetermine whether rehabilitation and retribution were properly\nserved by a longer sentence, or a least harsh sentence.\nAnd they did this, in the expectation of calling on\njudicial wisdom based on particular facts. What they\nQUESTION: But it wasn't just facts, you left a lot\nof discretion to the judge. If the judge thought that this\nparticular crime was becoming rampant in this community the\njudge could decide we need to make an example. And for that\nreason give the individual the maximum. It wasn't just fact\nfindings. The judge had a whole lot of discretion, he had\nsentencing discretion.\nIt was really up to him whether this crime, not just\nconsidering the facts of the crime, but considering the needs\nof society, should be given a longer or a shorter sentence.\nMR. DREEBEN: I\nQUESTION: It's a different system.\nMR. DREEBEN: I agree with that, and it was a large\npurpose of the sentencing guideline system to provide some\ncentralization for the policy decisions that are made in\nsentencing to ensure uniformity, and proportionality. But\nthis is what's critical for purposes of the Apprendi decision\nhere, also room for individualization.\nBased on the judge's traditional perception, that\nthere are things in the record, or in the character of this\ndefendant that were not taken into account by the legislature\nand that the judge in the exercise of his discretion will\ndetermine, deserve a higher or a shorter sentence. Now, in\nthe context of\nQUESTION: Mr. Dreeben, just answer me this. I will\nunderstand the government's position if you give me an answer\nto this question. If you do you not think that the meaning of\nthe Sixth Amendment which guarantees trial by jury, if you\ndon't think that the meaning is, that every fact which is\nessential to the length of sentence that you receive must be\nfound by the jury, if that's not what it means, what does it\nmean.\nMR. DREEBEN: It means\nQUESTION: What is the limitation upon the\nlegislature's ability to require facts to be found and yet\nthose facts not to be found by the jury.\nMR. DREEBEN: It means, Justice Scalia, that the\nfacts -- that the legislature itself identifies as warranting\nthe harsher punishment shall be found by the jury. But when\nthe legislature says to the judge, impose a sentence in the\nstandard range, unless you in your discretion determine that\nthere are circumstances that take the case outside the\nstandard range, or outside the heartland.\nIn that event, the judge may exercise his discretion\nto go up to what the legislature determines is the statutory\nmaximum, then what the judge's -- what the legislature has\nattempted to do, is combine a system that will regularize and\nprovide some uniformity but at the same time import that\nWilliams discretion, the traditional discretion that this\nCourt has recognized is consistent with the Sixth Amendment.\nAnd I submit that if in the Williams era a\nlegislature had passed a law that said, judges, we are giving\nyou a range of 10 to 50 years for this offense. We want you\nto figure out who should be sentenced where. We want you to\nfind facts and make judgments that are expressed in writing so\nthat we can see what you are doing. And we want you to put\nthe worst offenders at the top and the least worst offenders\nat the bottom.\nBut this Court would not have held that those sorts\nof inroads on judicial discretion automatically mean that the\nSixth Amendment kicks in. And traditional judicial discretion\nis out the window.\nQUESTION: Does that mean that the facts that are\nelements of the crime must be found by the jury. The facts\nthat are not elements of the crime, that are pertinent to\npunishment can be found by a judge?\nMR. DREEBEN: That is exactly right, and that is\nexactly what Washington purported to do when it said there are\nillustrative factors that we are going to put in a statute\nthat replicate what we know judges have traditionally done,\nbut we are not eliminating your discretion to find other\nfacts. This is a nonexclusive list. We want to call upon\nQUESTION: What determines whether a fact is -- it's\nso facile it's a wonderful solution. What determines whether\na fact is an element of the crime or not?\nMR. DREEBEN: Precisely what you\nQUESTION: You get whacked another five years,\nanother five years for it. But the legislature says, oh this\nis not an element of the crime. It's just a sentencing\nfactor. What -- how do you separate the element of the crime\nfrom sentencing factors?\nMR. DREEBEN: It's not a label. It is a consequence\nof the effect when the legislature says these are the facts\nthat are necessary. Here's the set, you use a gun, you engage\nin deliberate cruelty, you have a certain quantity of drugs,\nyou have one of those facts, and nothing else can justify a\nsentence above the standard range. That would define the\nstandard range as a statutory maximum.\nBut that's not what Washington does and that's not\nwhat the Federal sentencing guidelines do. What those systems\ndo is say, here are some illustrative facts for your\nconsideration. But we are not going to cabin your discretion\nto identify additional aggravating circumstances in the\nexercise of the time immemorial judicial prerogative to look\nat all of the facts of the case in the sentencing. And go up\nto what we have legislated as the statutory maximums.\nQUESTION: But it used to -- they have cabined it,\njudges can be reversed. If they give the additional penalty\nin a manner that is not permitted by the sentencing\nguidelines, or here by Washington's system. Don't say they\nhaven't cabined it and they have?\nMR. DREEBEN: They have cabined. They have cabined\nit.\nQUESTION: It's reversible.\nMR. DREEBEN: Justice Scalia, but my point of the -\nthe point of my hypothetical in which the legislature says to\nthe sentencing judge, find facts, put the worse offenders at\nthe top, apply the following three policies of sentencing.\nProportionality, retribution, and rehabilitation.\nQUESTION: Okay. So it used to be that the answer\nto the elements question was the people will decide what's an\nelement through their elected representatives. But after\nApprendi we have to find some other way, all right. So you're\nsaying, well, if it is a delegation from the legislature, use\nyour judgment, as judges used to do in sentencing, and find\nthose facts in the process. It's not an element, it's\nrelevant to sentencing. Is that the key?\nMR. DREEBEN: That's right.\nQUESTION: Have I got the key?\nMR. DREEBEN: If the delegation\nQUESTION: Rephrase it, because I'm trying to get\nthe precise key to what -- to what it is. I said general -\nI'm using general policies, that isn't the right word. What's\nyour word?\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, Justice Breyer, if what the\nlegislature does is say to the judge, here's a standard range,\nbut you in the exercise of your discretion identifying whether\na factor takes the case outside what the sentencing commission\ncalls the heartland, what Washington calls the standard range,\nthen in that event you may go up to what we have defined as\nthe statutory maximum.\nAnd by doing that, by calling upon judicial\ndiscretion to consider unspecified factors, the legislature\nhas not erected surrogate elements, which is what the Court\nfound in Apprendi.\nQUESTION: Is that the nub of your argument? That\nApprendi is concerned with the erosion of jury trial, by the\ncombined efforts of the legislative and the executive branches\nand we don't have to worry about the erosion of jury trial if\nthe operative determinations are left entirely within judicial\ndiscretion, is that what you're argument boils down to?\nMR. DREEBEN: That is what it boils down to, Justice\nSouter, because we're starting from a spectrum at which one\nend lies Williams versus New York, in which the Court fully\naccepted that it is entirely constitutional for a judge to\nsay, in my courtroom if you commit a kidnaping and you engage\nin deliberate cruelty which I'm going to find by a\npreponderance of the evidence, you're going to get the\nmaximum.\nQUESTION: All right. If that in fact is the\nposition, then I take it, it is open to a legislature in a\ncase like this to say, instead of having a formal maximum\nrange, I forget what it is, but from zero to 10 years, we're\ngoing to make it zero to 100 years, and we're going to leave\neverything else to the discretion of the judiciary, and\nApprendi in effect will be a dead letter.\nBut your argument is that's okay, because we're not\nworrying about the judiciary. Is that what it is, is that\nwhat it boils down to?\nMR. DREEBEN: I think that follows directly from\nWilliams versus New York, and it's an additional reason why\nthis Court should be very reluctant to apply Apprendi to\nsentencing guideline systems. Washington would not have to\nreact to a decision applying Apprendi to its guidelines the\nway Kansas did. Washington could decide that, all right, if\nthe problem is that our standard range created a top of a\nstatutory maximum term, we're just going to do away with the\ntop of the standard range, and we'll leave it to judicial\ndiscretion, with the following policy statements to give some\nguidance to what they do.\nQUESTION: I think you understated the prior -- the\nprior system. Because -- the Williams system, it wasn't just\nthe judge could say, if you kidnap and are cruel to your\nvictims I'll give you the maximum. He could say I -- in my\ncourt if you kidnap, you get the max. I mean there were\njudges around you know, known as Maximum John.\ncommitted a certain crime you would get the maximum. That's a\ndifferent system than what we have now.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Justice Scalia. Mr. Dreeben.\nMr. Fisher, you have four minutes.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L. FISHER\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. FISHER: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. I think\nit's important to make two points about Washington law, lest\nthe Court be left with any confusion. The first is, the\nWashington legislature has most definitely not left it up to\nWashington judges to depart upward for any reason they want.\nThey have not left it entirely up to the judges' discretion.\nA judge has to find, as the judge in this case did,\none of the eleven listed factors or one that is analogous to\nthose eleven factors. And there are case after case in\nWashington, or appellate decisions saying this aggravating\nfact is not good enough.\nBut if the Gore decision, and the Cardenas decision\nboth cited in my briefs. Another example is Barnes -- the\nBarnes decision at 818 P.2d 1088 in which for example the\nWashington Supreme Court said future dangerous which is a\ncommon aggravating factor in other contexts, it's not a valid\naggravating factor in Washington in most kinds of crimes\nbecause the legislature did not list that out.\nAnd in fact what the Washington Supreme Court said\nthere, is they said, if we were to find that we would be\ngiving ourselves too much discretion back for the very point\nof the Sentencing Reform Act was to take discretion away from\nus, to go above the standard sentencing range.\nThe second point about Washington law is, Mr.\nKnodell is right, that there is some discretion built into the\nsystem, but that discretion kicks in only after the judge has\nmade the required factual finding. In that respect the system\nis just like the one in Ring where the aggravating fact is\nnecessary but not sufficient for the ultimate sentence. The\nJudge still can in his discretion - this, Justice Breyer,\ngoes to your question, the judge still once the jury or the\nproper fact finder makes all the required factual findings,\nthe judge can still consider all the facts in the case, and go\nanywhere below that new maximum that's been established.\nSo judicial discretion is still retained in Kansas'\nsystem and it would be retained in Washington's system. And\nthe final thing I'd like to say is that Mr. Dreeben's point\nthat this case is different than Ring because the fact that\nthey're illustrative rather than exclusive would lead to\nApprendi simply being a mere formality because all the\nlegislature would have to do, for example in the Ring case, is\nhave factor number 11 that says anything similar to the others\non this list.\nThen you'd have people saying, well, judges can do\njust about what they were doing, which was finding one of\nthose 10 factors, but because there's factor 11, that says\nsomething similar to this is also good enough that Apprendi\nsomehow doesn't apply. We submit that a straightforward\napplication of Apprendi as it was stated in Ring, requires a\nreversal in this case. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr. Fisher.\n"
