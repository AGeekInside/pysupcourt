DREEBEN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. DREEBEN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nIn Neder versus United States, this Court\nheld that the omission of an offense element from petit\njury instructions can be harmless error, even though\nthat omission violates the Sixth Amendment right to a\njury trial. Our submission is that the same analysis\napplies to the omission of an offense element from a\ngrand jury's indictment. Such an error violates the\nFifth Amendment, but it is harmless when the petit jury,\nhaving been properly instructed on all of the elements\nof the offense, returns a verdict of guilty beyond a\nreasonable doubt.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm not quite sure if this\nworks, but at the trial before a petit jury there's an\nopportunity for counsel to object. There isn't an\nopportunity to object when the grand jury indictment\ncomes down. Now, I guess you could move to quash.\nMR. DREEBEN: That's correct, Justice\nKennedy. In fact, parties do move to dismiss\nindictments for failure to allege all of the elements of\nthe offense. That happened here. The motion was\nerroneously denied by the trial judge. The trial judge,\nunder Ninth Circuit law, under the assumption that the\nNinth Circuit has properly interpreted the law, should\nhave concluded that this indictment failed to allege the\nsubstantial step that was part of the attempt. And if\nthe judge had done that, then the Government would have\ngotten back to the grand jury and obtained a superseding\nindictment.\nInstead what the judge did was deny the\nmotion, finding that the indictment itself was\nsufficient, and then instructed the jury on all of the\nelements that the Ninth Circuit requires as part of this\noffense. And so we have now a petit jury verdict beyond\na reasonable doubt finding that the attempt did involve\na substantial step towards the completion of the\noffense.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Isn't the problem that the\nmotion to quash is going to be made, if counsel is on\nhis toes, is going to be made at the beginning of the\ntrial? And we want to induce the court to look very\ncarefully at it at that point, because if the court is\nwrong, somebody has to go through an entire trial as a\nresult of it. And the way to induce the court to be\nvery careful at the beginning is to say, this is not\nharmless error, and you've got to take this very\nseriously and you can't take any chance on the, in\neffect, the evidence saving you in harmless error\nanalysis later.\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, first of all, Justice\nSouter, motions like this are typically made long in\nadvance of trial, as this one was. Waiting until the\nday of trial is far from the optimum practice.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, I'm sure that's\nright. But that simply reinforces my point.\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, I think what it\nreinforces is that the judge has enough time to look at\nit and conscientiously attempt to get the law right\nwithout the need for the court to apply the heavy hand\nof automatic reversal.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But you concede that the\nerror would always be harmless if you have a trial\nbefore a petit jury, and all of the elements are\ninstructed to be found by the jury?\nMR. DREEBEN: Yes, Justice Ginsburg, that is\nour position.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That doesn't\nnecessarily make sense. You can imagine a situation\nwhere the probable cause and the eventual evidence that\nsupports guilt is adduced after the indictment and the\nprosecutor says, you know, we're going to find that\nevidence once we get into it, we don't have it now, but\nindict anyway without it.\nIn other words, what's your response to the\nsituation where there's no probable cause on an element\nat the time of the indictment, but that evidence is\nlater adduced and is a sufficient basis to convict?\nMR. DREEBEN: My response, Mr. Chief\nJustice, is the same response that this Court gave in\nUnited States versus Mechanik, where it was confronted\nwith an analogous problem. And that was in that case, a\nviolation of the rule that allowed two witnesses to\ntestify at the same time before the grand jury.\nAnd the Court was specifically confronted\nwith the question: Was this harmless error because the\npetit jury has now found guilt beyond a reasonable\ndoubt? And it answered that question yes. And en route\nto that answer, it said, we could logically be persuaded\nthat what we're supposed to do is compare the evidence\nin front of the grand jury to the error and see whether\nthe error was prejudicially consequential for the grand\njury's decision. But we're not going to do that, the\nCourt explicitly said in Mechanik, because once there is\na finding of beyond a reasonable doubt, the question of\nprobable cause is shown a fortiori and --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me, you mean you can\nnever decide this question until after the trial is\ncompleted and you see whether the jury convicts beyond a\nreasonable doubt?\nMR. DREEBEN: No, Justice Scalia, the\ndistrict court should decide this question in advance of\ntrial when it's properly raised and, if the indictment\nis defective, dismiss it. And this Court has recognized\nthat trial judges don't need incentives of an automatic\nreversal rule to get them to comply with the law.\nAnd I want to amend --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Did the U.S. Attorney in\nthis case oppose the motion to quash the indictment?\nMR. DREEBEN: In this case?\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes.\nMR. DREEBEN: Yes. And the Ninth Circuit's\nruling that this indictment was defective was really --\nbolt out-of-the-blue might be too strong. But it was an\nextension of its prior precedents in a way that wasn't\ndirectly foreseeable. The United States Attorney's\noffice had every reason to believe, based on language in\nprior Ninth Circuit cases, that alleging an attempt to\nenter was adequate to allege the offense.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Mr. Dreeben, this touches on\nwhat troubles me about this. I wonder whether we can\nanswer the generic question that you presented, whether\nthe omission of an element of a criminal offense from\nthe indictment can constitute harmless error, without\nconsidering the nature of the alleged defect here.\nI don't know how you can answer -- if you\nlook at whether the alleged defect here is susceptible\nto harmless error analysis, or whether if we were to\nagree with you, in fact, it is harmless, how you can\nanswer those questions without reaching a conclusion\nabout whether there was any defect in the indictment in\nthe first place.\nMR. DREEBEN: Justice Alito --\nJUSTICE ALITO: And it doesn't seem to me\nthat there's any defect in this indictment. It charges\n-- it recites the language of the statute, it uses the\nword \"attempt\" which has a very well-settled meaning in\nthe law. Any lawyer would understand exactly what is\nrequired for an attempt. It sets out the factual basis\nof the charge. So I don't know how you would get to\nthe -- how you can answer the second question without\ngetting into the first question.\nMR. DREEBEN: We did not challenge in our\ncertiorari petition, which this Court granted, the Ninth\nCircuit's holding that in order for an attempt to be\naccomplished there needs to be a substantial step, and\nin an indictment under section 1326, there needs to be\nan allegation of what that substantial step is.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I have the same problem.\nIt's such a difficult requirement to get a hold of. I\nmean, he drives the car, he walks, he breathes. I mean,\nall of these things enable him to get into the country.\nI just don't understand the basis for the rule.\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, it is common law --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: He wasn't forced to go\nover. He did it on his own. It seems to me that's --\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, that's certainly the\nGovernment's position, Justice Kennedy. But it is well\nsettled in the common law that attempts require a\nsubstantial step towards the completion. There are\nvariations that different jurisdictions use. That's the\nModel Penal Code formulation. The Ninth Circuit I think\nhas gone beyond where some other courts have gone, as\nJustice Alito was noting, by saying that the indictment\nneeds to spell out the factual basis for that\nsubstantial step.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: What would that be here?\nThat he drove the car to the border? That he got out of\nthe car? That he presented a document? What -- if you\ncould do it over again, what would the indictment say?\nMR. DREEBEN: The indictment would have to\nsay that he attempted to enter the United States and\ntook a substantial step towards the completion of that\ncrime, to wit he approached the border and came to the\nguard and presented false identifications to the guard\nand lied about his intended destination.\nJUSTICE ALITO: If you went back to the --\nif you went back to the very demanding nineteenth\ncentury criminal pleading laws, criminal pleading laws,\nthey would say that where you use a legal term that has\na well-0established meaning such as attempt, you don't\nneed to spell out the definition of that, of that\nconcept. It's enough to use the term. So what the\nNinth Circuit has done is to resurrect, you know, to go\nback to something that's more demanding than would have\nbeen required in a nineteenth century indictment and\nframe that as a violation of the Fifth Amendment.\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, Justice Alito, I'm not\ngoing to defend what the Ninth Circuit did here, but I\nwill be clear about the following: There is a generic\nlegal issue at stake in this case that we face in the\nNinth Circuit and in other courts around the country\nbecause indictments are not always written perfectly.\nAnd whether it's an element that the Ninth Circuit has\nimproperly read into it or an element that a court has\nproperly read into a statute, we do face the situation\nwhere --\nJUSTICE BREYER: As to the element, I\nthought that what the Ninth Circuit talked about was\novert act. They didn't use the words \"overt act.\"\nMR. DREEBEN: They did, Justice Breyer.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes, all right. I thought\nthat comes out of conspiracy law; it doesn't even out of\nattempt law. Then I thought it's unlikely -- but here\nyou can correct me. The U.S. Code is filled with the\nword \"attempt.\" Just opening it at random, there are\nattempts to assault and steal mail matter, there are\nattempts to steal the mail matter, there are attempts to\nrob a bank, attempts here, attempts there.\nIs it the Government's practice whenever\nthey charge a violation of any of these provisions to\nnot just use the word \"attempt,\" but to use the words\n\"substantial step\"?\nMR. DREEBEN: No.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I would have thought the\nanswer was no. And therefore, this isn't just a small\nerror of a technical sort. The Ninth Circuit is\ncompletely wrong and not even close. And therefore, if\nthey're not even close, can the Government come up here\nwhere there's an obvious error and they decide, the\nGovernment, that it would like to have a declaration by\nthis Court on a matter that they think is quite\ninteresting and important to them in a lot of other\ncases where they can't win the cases easily?\nThat's, I'm putting it a little pejoratively\nbecause I'm trying to get you to see what I'm driving\nat. It's like a hoked-up case. Why not? I'm using it\npejoratively only so that you can see what I'm worried\nabout.\nMR. DREEBEN: We didn't really have a lot of\nchoice about it. I mean, the Ninth Circuit decided to\nread the statute this way and it reversed the\nconviction. There's not a circuit split under section\n1326. We have to bring thousands of indictments in the\nNinth Circuit, so we're not exactly going to set up test\ncases to risk our convictions based on the Ninth\nCircuit's rule.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But you're making the\nconcession only for purposes of this case. That is, in\nanother case you would be free to say the word \"attempt\"\nis good enough; you don't have to spell out in the\nindictment a particular overt act.\nMR. DREEBEN: Justice Ginsburg, it's not\nunusual for this Court to decide a case where the\nGovernment does not challenge the underlying\nconstitutional ruling and make some remedial argument.\nTwo very notable examples are United States versus Leon,\nwhere the Government did not challenge the underlying\nFourth Amendment claim that was found to be valid by the\nlower court, but instead simply asked for a modification\nof the exclusionary rule; and another example is Rose\nversus Clark, which involves a fairly analogous issue to\nthis one, whether it can be harmless error to fail to\nincorporate into the jury instructions the actual\nelement and instead rely on a mandatory rebuttable\npresumption. In that case the State did not challenge\nwhether the instruction violated the Constitution. This\nCourt didn't decide it. Instead, what it decided was\nthe remedial question of harmless error, which is an\nimportant question and I submit doesn't change in\ncharacter depending on the nature of the underlying\nerror.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: We've done it before,\nthere's no doubt about it. But the better practice\nusually is to have a case in which the issue really\npresents the hard question. And you're asking us to\nmake a ruling in this case that would govern failure to\nallege an aggravating circumstance in a death case, for\nexample, which has a different atmosphere to the whole\ncase when you're facing that kind of an issue.\nMR. DREEBEN: It may have a different\natmosphere, but I don't think that it has any different\nlegal analysis behind it.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: A judge's reaction to a\ncase is often affected by just exactly what's involved.\nAnd here it's just hard to see how anyone could claim\nany particular prejudice out of the error in this\nparticular case or, really, it's arguable that there's\nno defect in the indictment at all because it was\nadequate notice to the defendant of what he's charged\nwith. This is much like a case in the State systems\nwhere you have notice pleading. It doesn't seem very\nprejudicial.\nBut you put it in a different context, you\nmight have a different reaction to the case.\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, I think our fundamental\nsubmission here is that with respect to the probable\ncause determination, there is no prejudice because of\nthe petit jury's verdict. With respect to notice, we\nwould acknowledge that a defendant could argue that the\ndefect in a grand jury indictment in a particular case\ncould fail to give him adequate notice such that he\nmight have a case-specific claim of prejudice and be\nable to overturn the conviction. On the facts of this\ncase, I agree with you, Justice Stevens, that would not\nbe a very strong argument. There really is no reason to\nthink that there was any notice problem with this very\ndiscrete transaction which was alleged in the indictment\nas occurring on a particular date in a particular place.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Does this come up very\noften? I think the case -- the issue you want to raise,\nbecause I would think normally there's a motion before\nthe trial, well before the jury is empanelled. The\ndefendant says: I want you to dismiss this; the\nindictment's inadequate. And if that's even close, I\nwould think normally the prosecutor would go back and\nsay: Fine, I'll get a superseding indictment, and that\nwould end the problem. And it seems to me so likely to\nhappen that the chances of the judge wrongly ruling\nagainst the defendant and then it goes through a whole\ntrial almost never happens.\nMR. DREEBEN: Justice Breyer, I think that\nan empirical perspective might be helpful here. And I\nthink an empirical perspective, if you look around the\ncircuits and you see the number of issues, cases, in\nwhich this issue is raised, it becomes clear that there\nare a large number of situations in which mistakes get\nmade.\nI mean, we're talking about a Federal system\nhere in which 70 to 80,000 cases are indicted a year.\nMistakes will happen, and they will happen both by the\ntrial judge and by the prosecutor.\nAnd there will be situations in which the\ncircuits change the law or the interpretation of the law\nafter the decision in question. I think that this is a\ngood example of that, where the Ninth Circuit extended\nits prior precedents to find that an indictment that\ndidn't allege the overt act was inadequate.\nAnd then the Government is stuck, and the\nrule of automatic reversal, which the Court may appear\nto think in this case is particularly disproportionate\nsince the indictment looks fine, functions identically\neven if there's a conceded violation that every member\nof the Court would say yes, there's a missing element\nhere.\nThe fundamental problem is that the grand\njury sits to decide probable cause. It does not decide\nwhether the defendant is actually guilty.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, it sits to\ndecide whether people should be indicted, and yes,\nthey're supposed to determine whether there's probable\ncause, but historically a significant role for the grand\njury has been not to indict people even though the\nGovernment had the evidence to indict them.\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, I actually do not agree\nthat there's any stronger evidence, Mr. Chief Justice,\nthat grand juries didn't indict when the Government had\nadequate evidence than there is historical evidence that\npetit juries did not convict when there's proof beyond a\nreasonable doubt. In both instances, you can point to\nhistorical instances in which grand juries and petit\njuries played a role of in effect nullifying when there\nwas adequate evidence.\nBut it's clear from the Neder decision that\nthat history has not led to the conclusion that this\nCourt cannot evaluate petit jury defects for\nharmlessness, and the same conclusion ought to be true a\nfortiori for the grand jury.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: The trouble with your a\nfortiori argument it seems to me is this: If we accept\nyour argument, then whenever a judge is asked to rule on\na motion to quash, if the judge is in any doubt, the\njudge is going to be induced by your rule to deny the\nmotion to quash and wait and see what happens at trial.\nAnd if in fact they get to trial and they don't prove\nthe element, then it can either be thrown out because an\nelement has not been proven or he can go back and revive\nthe motion to quash.\nIf on the other hand the Government gets its\nact together at that point and does put in evidence on\nthe element, it's going to be harmless error. And so\nthe price of, it seems to me, of your rule is that\nsomeone will always be put to trial if there is any\nquestion about how the judge should rule on the motion\nto quash, whereas if we go the other way the judge will\ngrant the motion to quash and the Government can go back\nto the grand jury and get another indictment.\nIt seems to me that something is seriously\nlost in that situation if we go your way.\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, Justice Souter,\nexperience doesn't show that, in fact, district courts\ndon't grant these motions. They grant them, as Justice\nBreyer indicated, when the indictment is not sufficient.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I'm sure they do grant\nthem. But I'm concerned about the, we'll say, the\ndoubtful case or the judge who can't make up his mind.\nUnder your rule the price of that uncertainty is always\ngoing to be to subject somebody to trial.\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, I do think we can assume\nthat Article III judges are a hearty enough species so\nthat they can make up their minds and they can rule.\nBut to the extent that there is a risk here that judges\nmight reserve the motion, that is the same risk that the\nCourt fessed up to and acknowledged in the Mechanik\ncase, where in fact the judge did reserve the motion.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And it seems to me that the\nprejudice to the defendant in the two -- as between the\ntwo situations simply is not comparable.\nIn Mechanik you had a situation in which two\nwitnesses putting in whatever evidence they were putting\nin were in the jury room and, yes, one could influence\nthe other, et cetera. Here, we're talking about a\nsituation in which it may very well be that the\ndefendant should never be put to trial at all. And your\nrule says if there's any question about it, put him to\ntrial, judge.\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, given that this issue\narises only when you have a petit jury verdict of guilty\nbeyond a reasonable doubt, it seems overwhelmingly\nlikely that any grand jury would have found probable\ncause.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Do we know -- do we have\nthe grand jury transcripts, so do we know that, in fact,\nevidence was put before the grand jury that false\nidentifications were presented at the border?\nMR. DREEBEN: The grand jury transcript is\nnot in this record, Justice Ginsburg, and we do not\nsuggest that the Court adopt a rule in which it reviews\nthe adequacy of the evidentiary showing before the grand\njury. There are important values in grand jury secrecy.\nThey will, of course, be compromised at the trial stage\nif witnesses testify and the testimony is turned over in\nthat context.\nBut more important than the practical aspect\nis exactly the logic that the Court used in Mechanik.\nThe point of the grand jury indictment is to determine\nis there enough to take this person to trial. Once the\nperson has been taken to trial and been found guilty\nbeyond a reasonable doubt, we know that if the\nGovernment went back to the grand jury it would be able\nto get an indictment.\nJUSTICE ALITO: How far would you go with\nthe Mechanik logic? Suppose that someone is charged by\ninformation with a felony without the person's consent\nand for some reason the trial judge refuses to dismiss\nthe information and then the person is convicted. Would\nyou say that because the petit jury returned a verdict\nthat the fact that the person was charged with a felony\nby information calls for no remedy?\nMR. DREEBEN: No, I would not go that far,\nJustice Alito. I would draw the same line that this\nCourt drew in the Midland Asphalt case where it was\nlooking at a somewhat analogous problem of an\ninterlocutory appeal and the same line that it drew in\nNeder itself. In Neder the Court said if the judge\ndirects a verdict of guilty, that's an impermissible act\nand it cannot be rendered harmless no matter how\noverwhelming the evidence is.\nIn the Midland Asphalt case, this Court\ndealt with whether the language of the Fifth Amendment\ncreated a right not to be tried. And it does say \"No\nperson shall be held to answer absent an indictment\nissued by a grand jury,\" and the Court said if you have\na defect that causes an indictment not to be an\nindictment or, as in your hypothetical, Justice Alito,\nno indictment at all, or if you have a defect that\ncauses the grand jury not to be a grand jury, those are\nthe kind of fundamental errors that would give rise to a\nright not to be tried such that you could take an appeal\nbefore trial, an interlocutory appeal.\nAnd I would submit that the same kind of\nprinciple would apply here.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So it's just a\nmetaphysical inquiry, when is an indictment not an\nindictment? It's not some other standard of what's\nfundamentally unfair or, from the Sixth amendment,\nwhether or not there's notice?\nMR. DREEBEN: I'm borrowing the language\nfrom the Midland Asphalt opinion, but I think that it\nwas a poetic way of putting the point that if you don't\nhave --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: You say poetic, I said\nmetaphysical. When is an indictment not an indictment?\nMR. DREEBEN: When you don't have one.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Now why would there be any\ndifference then? That's a question I was about to put\nto you. What if there is no indictment at all? Why\ncouldn't you say the same thing? Well, you know, the\nonly purpose of getting it is to see if there was\nprobable cause and you now have a conviction beyond a\nreasonable doubt.\nMR. DREEBEN: You could push the logic of\nthat argument that far.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't think it's pushing\nit, I think it's there.\nMR. DREEBEN: Just as in the Neder case, you\ncould say that it would be harmless error if a judge\ndirected a jury verdict when the evidence was\noverwhelming on all of the elements. But the Court did\ndraw a distinction between those two situations. And I\nthink that it's one that responds to a kind of common-\nsense view of how fundamental an intrusion is there.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Doesn't an indictment have\nas its purpose in part to tell the defendant what crime\nhe's being accused of committing? Isn't that -- so\nthat's why I thought it would be quite clear, wouldn't\nit, or helpful to say that to the Ninth Circuit? And so\nan error is when it doesn't do that? And an error is\nwhen it leaves out an element, and he doesn't know what\ncrime is being committed, he's accused of. So suppose\nyou had an indictment that really did that. Now he\ndoesn't know what crime he's accused of. And then you\ngo to the trial and so forth and now we have to go into\nat what point did he work out what crime he was being\naccused of, rather hard to say.\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, chances are he did know\nwhat crime he was accused of.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, yes, of course the\nchances are. But there's a possibility he didn't.\nMR. DREEBEN: And we submit --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So if he didn't and\ntherefore the indictment was faulty in that respect,\nthen what? Are you going to say we have to track\ndown -- I mean what it's reminding me of is like trying\nto say whether he got an adequate lawyer, didn't get an\nadequate lawyer, who knows, that kind of problem.\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, it isn't quite like\nthat, I hope, Justice Breyer. I mean, notice defects\nare very commonly alleged by defendants and courts know\nhow to look for prejudice. They know how to say whether\nthe defendant was denied an opportunity to prepare his\ndefense or misled by the indictment in some fashion or\nanother. And that's a very common case by case sort of\nprejudice inquiry that fits with the nature of the\nviolation.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- me until halfway through\nthe trial that it was robbery I was being accused of\nbecause they left robbery out of the indictment.\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, what you get are cases\nwhere there needs to be an effect on interstate commerce\nand it's not alleged and then the Government comes up\nwith proof. I'm not saying that there is going to be a\nvast pool of cases in which defendants would validly be\nable to show prejudice from lack of notice; and that's\nbecause we do have many other means in the criminal\njustice system to alert the defendant to what he's\nfacing.\nThere's discovery, there's the opportunities\nfor a bill of particulars to be filed. Those are the\nkinds of conventional harmless error inquiries that are\nappropriate when you have a claim that the indictment\nfails to give adequate notice. But what is not\nappropriate is for the Ninth Circuit to impose a rule on\nthe Government and on the system of justice that says we\nwill automatically reverse, because there are important\nvalues at stake here whenever a rule of automatic\nreversal is contemplated. And this was true in the\nMickens versus Taylor case where the Court rejected a\nrule of automatic reversal when a judge didn't ask a\nquestion in response to an obvious conflict --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm still not sure of your\ntest. It's whether or not it's fundamentally unfair,\nwhether or not there's notice, which sounds like more\nSixth Amendment than Fifth. Or whether it's not an\nindictment, a rose is a rose type of thing.\nMR. DREEBEN: There are two aspects to our\nrule, Justice Kennedy. The first is that to the extent\nthat the claim of a defective indictment goes to the\nquestion of was there probable cause, that error and\nthat constitutional value is not a basis for reversal\nonce a petit jury has found guilt beyond a reasonable\ndoubt on the same point.\nTo the extent that the defect in the\nindictment goes to inadequate notice, a defendant can\nmake such a claim post trial that the indictment\nprejudiced him because it was inadequately framed. But\nthat should be done on a case-specific basis rather than\non a rule of automatic reversal.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Dreeben, if we disagree\nwith you here, could this defendant be retried? Could\nhe be reindicted?\nMR. DREEBEN: Yes, Justice Scalia. I don't\nbelieve there would be any double jeopardy bar to\nreindicting him since he is the one who's challenged his\nconviction.\nI'd like to reserve the remainder of my\ntime.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.\nDreeben.\nMR. DREEBEN: Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Baggot.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MR. ATMORE L. BAGGOT\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. BAGGOT: Mr. Chief Justice, if it please\nthe Court:\nThe structure created by the Constitution of\nthis country provides a single means of charging a\nperson with a Federal criminal offense. The intention\nof the framers of the Constitution was that a group of\nordinary citizens would take time away from their\nfamilies, their businesses, and their other concerns for\nthe purpose of deciding whether the requirements of the\nFifth Amendment have been met by a Government\nprosecutor, and in, in a few words, whether a trial\nshould proceed. Or not.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: You could say the same\nthing about a petit jury. And in Neder we use the\nharmless error standard.\nMR. BAGGOT: Absolutely, but the proceedings\nbefore a grand jury are secret. We never know what\nhappened inside a grand jury. It's a closed door\nproceeding. It is an independent body. It is not\nsubject to any appeals or reviews by the trial judge.\nThe only thing that we know what happened behind those\nclosed doors was the document that emerges, which is the\nindictment which becomes public knowledge. Nothing else\nis known about what happened in that jury room.\nNow, I'll take a guess as to what happened.\nThe Government told the grand jury that the overt act\nrequirement was not necessary, or perhaps, I'll take\nanother guess, they stated to the grand jury what they\nstated to the district judge, that the indictment does\nin fact state the overt act when plainly it doesn't.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Suppose -- suppose we found\nout. Somebody told what happened, and it was a crime of\nbank robbery or it's an assault of a mailman, a postman.\nAnd you know, it turns out they didn't present one word\nof evidence, not a word that says that this individual\nwho was assaulted had anything to do with the mail.\nThere's complete absence of any evidence whatsoever on a\nmajor element of the offense. And now, suppose we get\nfinished with the trial. Plenty of evidence.\nConviction. Can you go back and raise that?\nMR. BAGGOT: I believe it would be raised --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No. No. I mean can you\nwin.\nMR. BAGGOT: Oh, can you win.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yeah.\nMR. BAGGOT: You can always raise it.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I mean, you see, I'm saying\nis that error? Is that correctible error? I'm saying\nthere is an absolute error. It is far worse than here.\nWe know for a certainty there was no evidence whatsoever\npresented to the grand jury on a major element of the\ncrime.\nMR. BAGGOT: You're assuming somehow the\ntranscript has been disclosed.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes, I assume we know that.\nTake that as a given. We know.\nMR. BAGGOT: The doors are open, they're not\nclosed.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yeah, we know.\nMR. BAGGOT: We know what happened and\nbasically there's zero evidence.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes. Zero.\nMR. BAGGOT: Your Honor, the history of this\nCourt's treatment of grand jury is that they may\nconsider any evidence; they may consider --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes, but what is the answer\nto my question, yes or no? I'm saying after the --\nMR. BAGGOT: I believe in that situation the\npetit jury's verdict would stand.\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's right. So the\nanswer is no?\nMR. BAGGOT: The answer is no.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And if you can't raise\nthat, which is a major area because there's a harmless\nerror is what it really amounts to, why isn't the same\ntrue here where the error is far more likely to be\nsimply technical and make no difference given the\nadequacy of the evidence?\nMR. BAGGOT: Because the Constitution\ncontemplates that the grand jury be independent, that\nits decision --\nJUSTICE BREYER: It does as well in my case.\nMR. BAGGOT: -- not be reviewed, that\nthere's no appeal, there's no review process for what\nthe grand jury did behind its closed doors, whether we\nopen the doors or not.\nJUSTICE ALITO: What if it's perfectly --\nMR. BAGGOT: Sir?\nJUSTICE ALITO: I'm sorry. What if it's\nperfectly clear that the error is simply a clerical\nerror? Let's take a case where somebody is charged with\npossession of a firearm by a convicted felon. And\nbefore the grand jury, we look at the transcript, we see\nthat the prosecutor introduced evidence of five\njudgments of convictions for felony offenses. And the\njury is properly charged that they have to find that\nthis individual was a convicted felon. And there's\nsimply -- and then when the case is tried at, when the\ncase is tried the defense even stipulates that the\nperson is a convicted felon.\nBut there's a clerical mistake in preparing\nthe indictment. And it doesn't recite the fact that the\ndefendant was previously convicted of a felony. It's\nyour position that there must be a reversal there?\nMR. BAGGOT: Your Honor, if there is a\nclerical error, Rule 36 gives the trial judge the\nability, and the power, and the authority to correct an\nerror which is purely clerical. I refer you to the case\nof Contreras-Rojas, which was this exact defense.\nJUSTICE ALITO: But what if it comes up on\nappeal? Nothing is done until it comes up on appeal.\nMR. BAGGOT: Well, I believe --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Which is exactly in the\nposture of this case.\nMR. BAGGOT: Well, Rule 36 says the court\nmay correct clerical errors at any situation. But that,\nyour question presupposes that we know what happened in\nthe grand jury room, that it should have been an\nindictment, they intended it to be in the indictment --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: How do you distinguish\nthe mail -- the letter carrier case that Justice Breyer\nposed, because there you said even though there was no\nevidence at all of what this person was, if the petit\njury found it, that would not be subject to review. I\ndon't think you answered Justice Breyer and he said if\nyou concede that, the failure to introduce any evidence\nthat this person was a letter carrier.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I would like to even\nsharpen Justice Breyer's hypothetical. Let's assume\nthat the indictment did set forth what the overt act\nwas. It did. But there was no evidence of that overt\nact introduced before the grand jury. What would the\nresult of that be?\nMR. BAGGOT: The result --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Then the trial occurs --\nMR. BAGGOT: And he's found guilty.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: He's convicted. And I\nthink you're going -- your position is that conviction\nwould stand.\nMR. BAGGOT: My position is the conviction\nwould stand, yes, sir.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That doesn't seem to me to\nmake a lot of sense.\nMR. BAGGOT: Well, the grand jury is\nindependent. There is no review from the grand jury.\nThe petit jury is an independent institutional body.\nThe function of the grand jury is not only to find\nprobable cause, rightly or wrongly, but the function of\nthe grand jury is also to select the charge. And\nspecifically since your decision in Recuenco versus\nWashington that sentencing enhancements are to be\ntreated the same way as basic elements of the offense to\nbe charged also, the grand jury's role is going to be\neven better.\nMy position is simply that there is no\nreview whatsoever from the grand jury. If you're\nunhappy, you're a defendant, you're unhappy with what\nthe grand jury did, you say there's no evidence, you go\nto trial, you get acquitted. That's the only review\nthere is of the grand jury and what they did. If\nthere's an error the case must go back to the same grand\njury or conceivably another grand jury. There's no\njeopardy at that stage. There's no constitutional\ncomplications. And the Government is free to go back.\nQuite frankly, I'm very surprised the Government did not\njust go back and amend the indictment -- not amend it,\nbut supersede the indictment and allege an overt act.\nThe basic problem we have here is that there\nare so many acts committed by everybody which could be\nin furtherance of a crime. And the problem is going to\ntrial that we don't know which act the Government was\ntalking about. They told us in motion proceedings that\nthe entry itself was the overt act. But the court of\nappeals ruled that that cannot be an overt act. So\npossibly Mr. Resendiz was entitled to judgment as a\nmatter of law.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Can't you ask for a bill of\nparticulars?\nMR. BAGGOT: I could have done that, yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, then you would have\nhad no problem.\nMR. BAGGOT: But bill of particulars are not\nfavored motions. And what is to -- that would still be\nthe Government speaking on behalf of the grand jury.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Were you, were you\nsurprised at trial by the evidence that the defendant\nhad submitted two false identifications? Was the first\ntime you heard about that at trial?\nMR. BAGGOT: Your Honor, Justice Ginsburg, I\nwould submit that the prejudice to the defendant at the\njury trial, the petit jury, was a slight prejudice. The\nreal problem I feel was on appeal, that if the\nGovernment had alleged --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But were you, was there\nany element of surprise in this trial? Did you not know\nbeforehand that the Government was going to present\nevidence of two false identifications?\nMR. BAGGOT: No, I knew that, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So there was no lack of\nnotice; there was no surprise.\nMR. BAGGOT: In our court we have complete\ndiscovery. They copy the file for it and hand it to us.\nSo we know everything they know. But what we did not\nknow is what the Government would rely on as their overt\nact. They said it was the entry itself. The court of\nappeals ruled as a matter of law, rightly or wrongly,\nthat that cannot be an overt act, because it simply --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, surely submitting\nfalse identification could be a overt act.\nMR. BAGGOT: It could be. But --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Is there any doubt about\nthat?\nMR. BAGGOT: It could be an overt act. It\ncould be, lying could be a overt act, tying your shoes\nin the morning with intent to go to --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, but you knew that --\nyou had the file. You knew the Government was going to\nprove this. And you also knew it was an overt act.\nMR. BAGGOT: It could have been. But there\nare many acts.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But your point is not that\nthere was any prejudice here. Your point is that he was\nentitled to a grand jury?\nMR. BAGGOT: He was entitled to a grand jury\nas an independent institutional body. And the problem I\nhave with the Government's point of view is that it\nplaces a judge as a reviewing authority over what a\ngrand jury has done, regardless of the standard that's\napplied. And of course in -- it's a rare case when you\neven know what a grand jury did.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You don't have\nany -- you're not suggesting to us that the grand jury\nthat indicted him for intentionally attempting to enter\nthe United States at or near San Luis would not have\nindicted him if the indictment had gone further and\nsaid, and he submitted false IDs?\nMR. BAGGOT: There are, there certainly are\nscenarios under which they would have indicted him, yes,\nsir.\nJUSTICE ALITO: You think that the -- that\nthe indictment had to specify which of the many things\nthat he did, or the several things that he did when he\napproached the border constituted the overt act that the\nNinth Circuit -- he walked up to the border and he did a\nnumber of things to try to get into the United States.\nMR. BAGGOT: Sure.\nJUSTICE ALITO: And you think that the\nindictment has to specify that walking up wasn't a\nsubstantial step, but presenting the documents might\nhave been, whether it was walking up, presenting the\ndocuments, lying to the agent? You have to go into that\nlevel of detail in order to satisfy the Fifth Amendment?\nMR. BAGGOT: Rule 7(c)(1) of the Rules of\nProcedure states that the indictment must state the\nessential facts. It need not be a memorandum of law\njust spelling out the elements of the crime in a general\nsense, but it must state the essential facts. In the\nCourt's case of Hamling it says very clearly, the\nlanguage of the statute must be accompanied by such\nstatement of facts and circumstances as will inform the\naccused of the specific offense coming under the general\ndescription which is charged.\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's a separate\nrequirement. I don't know if it's constitutional or not\nconstitutional, but I didn't think that requirement was\nat issue here.\nThe requirement of stating the facts is not\nthe requirement of setting out the elements of the law.\nAt least that's my understanding. Now, you can correct\nme if I'm wrong.\nMR. BAGGOT: Well, Your Honor, based upon\nyour Hamling decision, I believe that's what the Court\nsaid, that there must be an allegation of facts under\nthe decision in United States versus --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, I'm not denying that.\nI just didn't think that had anything to do with this\ncase. I mean, I thought that the object of the\nindictment initially was to set forth what crime the\nperson was accused of and inform him of that.\nYou are saying, and then there is another\nrequirement, which seems a little vague. It's been hard\nfor me to find out, to pin this down, and it's the one\nyou state, which is that it says in addition in the rule\nyou have to have facts.\nI don't know if those are the same. I\nthought they were two separate things.\nMR. BAGGOT: Well, Your Honor, one of the\nfunctions of the grand jury indictment is to provide\nnotice to the accused of the exact offense with which he\nis charged. Here, clearly we knew he was charged with\n1326, with attempting. What we did not know is which of\nthe many, many acts that the Government suggested at\nvarious times, which of the many acts they proved at\ntrial, would be the overt act. As I say, the appeal was\nunfair. It's not so much the trial was unfair. It was\nthe appeal that was unfair.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Does the Government have\nto pick one overt act and say that's it, when it\nintroduces evidence of a whole string of them?\nMR. BAGGOT: Well, I don't see how we can\nreally address it unless they tell us what they're\ntalking about. And I would point out as of today the\nGovernment has still not identified a single act that is\ntheir overt act.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, can't you allege\nthat the means by which it was done are unknown, but\nthat it was by one or more of the following?\nMR. BAGGOT: Yes, you could. Many times in\nconspiracy indictments they will allege any of the\nfollowing overt acts.\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's exactly what I -- I\ntried to read some treatises on this, and the more I\nread, the more confused I got.\nI started out thinking, well, it's\nsufficient if you have bank robbery you say on October\n14, 2004, in the city of such and such, at the corner of\nsuch and such, where there is a bank, the defendant\nwalked into the bank and he, he attempted or he did by\nforce or threat of force, take property belonging to\nsomeone else, or whatever it is, and that that would be\nsufficient. And that you don't have to say, and in\naddition he, you know, what the force consisted of, did\nit consist of a knife, or a gun, or a fist. Can you\ngive me some enlightenment, at least if you think that's\nrelevant here?\nMR. BAGGOT: I don't think that's relevant\nbecause that's going into excessive detail. The\nrequirement is that the essential fact --\nJUSTICE BREYER: If it's excessive detail,\nthe central fact, then why isn't on such and such a date\nat such and such a time he attempted to?\nMR. BAGGOT: Because he did many things in\nfurtherance of the attempt according to the Government's\nproof, and we had a right to know, to have notice of the\naccusation, what is the Government talking about?\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. Then why, if\nthat's so, why wouldn't that apply as well if they said\nhe attempted to and committed an overt act in -- that is\na substantial step. And then you're saying in addition,\nthey have to list the particular facts.\nMR. BAGGOT: The essential facts.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I couldn't find any case in\nthis Court that said that. I mean, I found in Hamling a\ncase that went the other way, a general statement. They\nsaid all you have to do is say obscenity, you don't have\nto say how obscene or in what way it's obscene, et\ncetera.\nMR. BAGGOT: But in the Russell case they\nsaid that you have to provide the essential facts, what\nwas the nature of the committee hearing, what was the\nsubject --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And\nthen Russell seems lost from sight for quite a while, or\nisn't followed a lot.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But you come back and you\ntell Justice Breyer, well, that's because we had no\nnotice. But that's a different argument than the fact\nthat there was no indictment. Notice can be cured by a\nbill of particulars, by the fact that you've had a\nchance to contest the evidence at trial, that there was\nno error. That's a quite different rationale than\nsaying that this is not an indictment.\nMR. BAGGOT: Well, it's not an indictment\nbecause it did not allege the essential facts.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But that, it seems to me,\nis your argument, not lack of notice.\nMR. BAGGOT: Well, it didn't provide a\nnotice of what the essential facts was. Those are\noverlapping concepts, certainly, but we did not know\nwhat the facts --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this question.\nShould the test for the missing element be different for\nthe test for the wrong element? In other words, suppose\nthe indictment alleged he walked up to the border and\nthe evidence showed he rode a bicycle. There's a\nvariance. Would that present a different legal issue\nthan if they just leave the overt act entirely out?\nMR. BAGGOT: That presents a different legal\nissue because a variance means they alleged A, they\nproved B. Here they did not allege A. Nothing was\nalleged.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Why should the test for\njudging the two be different?\nMR. BAGGOT: Between a variance --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Between a variance and an\nomission?\nMR. BAGGOT: Well, when you have a variance\nthe question is how much is the variance, how far off is\nthe variance.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, it's clearly\ndifferent. He rode a bicycle instead of walking.\nMR. BAGGOT: Well, he's given notice that\nhe's approaching the border with intent to commit this\ncrime.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: So here you've got notice\nhe made an attempt, but you didn't tell us whether he\nrode the bicycle or he walked.\nMR. BAGGOT: But then the question becomes\nis it material, is the variance material, is it far off\nfrom what alleged? Here nothing was alleged.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: See, the problem I'm\ntrying to think through is why should there be a\ndifferent rule between those two situations. It seems\nto me they're equally likely to produce prejudice or\nlack of notice and a failure to comply with the letter\nof the Constitution.\nMR. BAGGOT: Well, the prime variance case\nis Stirone versus United States in the 1960s, where the\nCourt very simply said that where nothing is alleged\nthis cannot be treated as a simple variance.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But why isn't your answer\nto Justice Stevens that in the case in which there is no\nallegation of an element at all there isn't a sufficient\nindictment to charge him for anything, whereas in the\ncase of the variance on your theory, as I understand it,\nthere is an indictment and the question is simply\nwhether he was misled by the variance and prejudiced?\nMR. BAGGOT: Right.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So why isn't the answer is\nin one case there's an indictment, and in the other case\nthere isn't?\nMR. BAGGOT: Well, the extent is -- it's a\nquestion that can't be answered in the abstract. It's a\nquestion of how material the variance was.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, but why isn't your\nanswer to him that in the case in which there is a\nvariance you have an indictment; in the case that you're\ntalking about there is none? And the reason I press you\non that is that I thought the essence of your case was\nthat there is no indictment here, i.e., the grand jury\nfunction has not been performed and he is entitled to\nthe grand jury function before he goes to trial.\nMR. BAGGOT: Correct.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And if that is the nub of\nyour position, then I would have thought your answer to\nJustice Stevens was what I suggested. If that's not\nyour answer to Justice Stevens, then I'm not sure that I\nunderstand your case.\nMR. BAGGOT: Well, Your Honor, our case is\nsimply that where a material element is omitted the\ngrand jury -- something went wrong in the grand jury\nproceeding, and the only remedy for that is to return\nit, the case, to the grand jury and let them have a\nsecond go --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: What is the result of what\nwent wrong? How do you characterize the grand jury\nproduct in the case in which, as you put it, something\ngoes wrong?\nMR. BAGGOT: Constitutionally deficient and\ndid not fulfill the requirements of the Fifth Amendment.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: An insufficient -- in other\nwords, there is no indictment charging a crime? Is\nthat --\nMR. BAGGOT: That's correct, Your Honor, no\ncrime, and the reason for that -- I'll go one step\nfurther -- is because there's no way of knowing whether\nthe Government --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But that's not an\nelement. You talk about essential facts and material --\nI mean, the statute makes it a crime to intentionally\nattempt to enter the United States having previously\nbeen deported and all that. It doesn't say anything\nabout presenting false identification. So why are those\nessential facts when they're not part of what the\nstatute prohibits?\nMR. BAGGOT: Because that is -- there must\nbe facts to show what the overt act was. Just providing\na legal memorandum of what the elements of the offense\nare doesn't do any good. What the Constitution\ncontemplates is that the essential facts be laid out.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Suppose this indictment\ncharged not an attempt to enter, but unlawful entry.\nThen the indictment would be sufficient, right? There\nwouldn't be any problem with it?\nMR. BAGGOT: Well, if it --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: It charged, not an\nattempt, but an unlawful entry. Anything missing from\nthe indictment?\nMR. BAGGOT: No, because that's a general\nintent crime. There's no specific intent and no\nrequirement that he perform any overt act.\nJUSTICE ALITO: And the defendant could be\nconvicted of an attempt under such an indictment, could\nhe not?\nMR. BAGGOT: Under such an indictment, under\nthis case he could not, because he was under the\nconstant surveillance of the INS at the time and in law\nthat is not a legal indictment, not a legal reentry, an\nillegal reentry. It's one of those quirks in the law,\nand that's why they charged the attempt, to avoid these\nquestions of whether he was under the constant control\nand surveillance of the immigration authorities, which\nhe was. He never got by secondary. So that's why the\ncharge was attempt as opposed to unlawful entry.\nJUSTICE ALITO: But in that situation, you\nwouldn't know what the substantial step was, would you?\nMR. BAGGOT: No, and --\nJUSTICE ALITO: The indictment wouldn't tell\nyou what the substantial step was.\nMR. BAGGOT: And there wouldn't be any need\neither because it's not a specific intent crime and\nthere's no requirement --\nJUSTICE ALITO: If the defendant was\nconvicted of the lesser included offense of attempt\nunder an indictment charging the completed offense?\nMR. BAGGOT: Attempt is not a lesser\nincluded. The Congress has intended to make attempt on\nthe same level as the substantive offense. That is the\nway the case law has been coming out. So whether he\nenters, whether he attempts, or whether he's found in\nthe United States are all on an equal par. It's not a\nlesser included.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I don't understand\nthat. You're saying it's a separate offense, but a\nlesser included offense is a separate offense. It just\nhappens to be embraced within some other offense.\nMR. BAGGOT: Well, it has the same guideline\npunishment. It has the same treatment as the unlawful\nentry. And they're treated -- we have case law in our\ncircuit that says, I think it is Corrales Beltran, that\nsays the attempt is a substantive offense, even though\nit sounds contradictory.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What does that mean, if\nyou're tried for illegal entry and the Government\ndoesn't prove the illegal entry because you're under\nsupervision when you get in, the jury could not convict\nof attempt?\nMR. BAGGOT: If he was charged that way,\nthey probably could, yes. There could be a two-count\nindictment or there could be alternatives. But that\nwasn't this case.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And that would be okay,\njust charge with attempt without setting forth the overt\nacts for the attempt?\nMR. BAGGOT: Well, they would have to set\nout the overt act and the essential facts that\nconstitute the overt act.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Suppose that it's an\nassault and the indictment says on such and such a day,\nat such and such a time, he assaulted the postman,\nright? You also have to say what, that he waved his\nfist or that he had a knife? You have to say that in\nthe indictment?\nMR. BAGGOT: No, I don't think so.\nJUSTICE BREYER: No. All right. So I\nthought normally essential facts means simply the\nfacts -- you can state the essential facts by writing\nthe statute and normally that tells you. Now, is that\ntrue? One case that seems to go the other way is\nRussell.\nMR. BAGGOT: Normally, yes, sir.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Normally, yes.\nMR. BAGGOT: That's correct. However, in\nthis case there is a peculiar meaning to the word\n\"attempt\" that when Congress used the word \"attempt\"\nthey meant to bring with that word its requirements\nunder the common law.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Why more than any other\nword in the statute? \"Attempt,\" people know what that\nmeans.\nMR. BAGGOT: Well, they do and they don't.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And they also know what\n\"assault\" means. And if you tried, you could spell out\n\"assault.\" They know what \"robbery\" means, but you\ncould spell it out.\nSo why does the Ninth Circuit think this one\nyou have to spell out, but all the other words you don't\nhave to?\nMR. BAGGOT: Well, that's why they had an en\nbanc determination, because the judges were in disarray\nover that question. But at the time of this trial of\nthe en banc decision in the Ninth Circuit,\nGracidas-Ulibarry, had established concretely that the\nintent of the legislature was to incorporate the common\nlaw meaning of the word \"attempt.\"\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Baggot, could I come\nback to your answer to my earlier question. You said\nyou could only be convicted of the lesser included\noffense if the lesser included offense is set forth\nexplicitly in the indictment. Are you sure of that?\nMR. BAGGOT: No, sir.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Are you sure that's the\nlaw?\nMR. BAGGOT: No, but here under 1326 it's\nquite different. The intent of the legislature was that\nthe attempt would itself be a substantive offense.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: As I said in my previous\nquestion, every lesser included offense is itself a\nsubstantive offense. That doesn't distinguish attempt\nfrom anything else. And my understanding is if you're\ncharged with a greater offense, the lesser can be a\nsubject of conviction even though it's not explicitly\nset forth in the indictment.\nMR. BAGGOT: Yes, that's correct.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And if that is the case\nhere, then it seems to me he could have been convicted\nof attempt without ever having had set forth in the\nindictment the overt act that you demand.\nMR. BAGGOT: Well, that's a good point. But\nunder our -- all I can tell you, Justice Scalia, is that\nunder our case law the attempt is considered a\nsubstantive offense. That's been the law --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But substantive offense\nis one thing. Lesser included, I think you said earlier\nit couldn't be a lesser included because it's subject to\nthe same punishment. So it is not lesser?\nMR. BAGGOT: Under this statute, under 1326,\nthat's the ruling of our circuit.\nYour Honor, in conclusion, I'd just like to\nemphasize that if the Government's position is adapted,\nwhat you will have is judges reviewing the decision of\nthe grand jury whether or not to allege certain\nelements, essential elements of offenses. That is\nchallenging the independence of the grand jury, which is\npart of the structure set up by the Constitution, that\nthe grand jury is a separate institution. Anything that\nthe grand jury does, any mistakes that are made, need to\nbe returned to the grand jury and not be reviewed by a\nsingle judge, a panel of judges, or an en banc or any\ncourt.\nAre there any other questions by the Court?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.\nBaggot.\nMR. BAGGOT: Thank you, sir.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Dreeben, you\nhave three minutes.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. DREEBEN: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Dreeben, is attempt a\nlesser included offense of the substantive offense of\nillegal reentry?\nMR. DREEBEN: It's a substantive offense.\nIt is an attempt offense. I wouldn't necessarily\ndescribe it as lesser included, but Rule 31 of the\nFederal Rules of Criminal Procedure does allow a trial\njudge to submit an attempt offense to the petit jury\nwhen attempt is a violation of the substantive law.\nI should say that the Government's position\nis that there does not need to be a separate charge of\nattempt in the indictment in order to permit Rule 31 to\noperate, but there is a circuit split over whether\nlesser included offenses can be submitted to the jury\nunless they are included in the indictment.\nSo we're not operating under a uniform rule\nthat would always allow us to do that, and I'm not sure\nwhich way the Ninth Circuit goes on that, although I\ncould hazard a guess.\n(Laughter.)\nThe problem that we have here is that we are\nliving under a rule of law in the Ninth Circuit and in\nat least one other circuit that forces the Government to\npay a tremendous penalty when a mistake is made in an\nindictment, and it does happen. Justice Souter, I can\nassure you that judges dismiss plenty of indictments for\nfailure to dismiss -- state elements, but they don't get\nthem all.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But Mr. Dreeben, isn't the\npoint that the tremendous cost that you refer to is a\ntremendous cost that the Government pays by its choice\nto go to trial, as opposed to going back to the grand\njury and making sure that it has an adequate indictment?\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, the Government is often\nquite confident that it's correct. And I think if you\nput yourself in the position of the prosecutors in this\ncase, you can see why that's true. But there are myriad\nrules and sub-rules of substantive law that this Court\nwill never review, that require the Government to\nconform with various pleading obligations. They're all\nbelow the radar screen. But when you have a rule of\nautomatic reversal like this, they jump up to\nprominence. And the reason that they do is because the\nentire criminal justice system, victims, witnesses, the\njudge, the prosecutors, the defense bar, jurors,\neverybody is being asked to go through a trial that was\nconducted on an error-free basis by hypothesis, simply\nbecause there was a mistake at the charging phase. And\nthe petit jury's verdict we submit makes it clear that\nthat mistake does not entitle the judicial system to say\nlet's throw it all out and start again simply as a\nprophylactic mechanism.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: If you concede there was\nan error, is there anything to prevent us from saying we\ndon't accept that concession, and have you rebrief and\nargue the question of whether or not an overt act is\nrequired?\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, I hope that if the Court\ndoes not choose to decide the question on which it\ngranted certiorari, that it does hold that the Ninth\nCircuit's substantive rule of law here is incorrect, and\nthat there was nothing wrong with the indictment.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But can we do that in the\nface of your concession without having reargument?\nMR. DREEBEN: Oh, I think this Court can do\nanything it chooses, regardless of the Government's\nconcession.\n(Laughter.)\nBut we're not conceding that the Ninth\nCircuit was correct. We simply didn't challenge it\nbecause the important question for us is the rule of law\non harmless error. This pleading rule is something that\nwe can comply with. It may be wrong, but it's\nsomething, like many wrong rules of law, we live with.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\n"
