FREDERICK\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. FREDERICK: Thank you, Mr. Chief\nJustice, and may it please the Court:\nThe Eighth Circuit held that Philip Morris\nis subject to such specific and detailed regulations by\nthe Federal Trade Commission that it is entitled to\nremove this purely State law case from State court to\nFederal court under the Federal officer removal statute.\nThat holding is erroneous and should be reversed for at\nleast three reasons.\nFirst, the court articulated the wrong test\nfor determining when a person is acting under a Federal\nofficer.\nSecond, the court misunderstood the Federal\nTrade Commission's regulatory regime with respect to the\nmarketing of so-called light cigarettes.\nAnd third, the court's approach ignores the\nlong history and purposes of the federal officer removal\nprovision to protect the Federal Government operations\nfrom interference by State court proceedings.\nIn this case, and in this Court, Philip\nMorris largely abandons the Eighth Circuit's rationale\nand offers an alternate ground of affirmance. It should\nbe rejected. The FTC has not delegated authority to\nconduct testing to Philip Morris, and the complaint in\nany event challenges only the company's marketing and\nnot its testing of so-called light cigarettes.\nNow with respect to the first point, the\nEighth Circuit applied and articulated the wrong test\nfor determining when a person is acting under a federal\nofficer. The proper test, as this Court's case in the\nCity of Greenwood versus Peacock Casey elucidates, is\nwhen the person is aiding or acting on behalf of the\nFederal officer in a subordinate role in the officer's\ndischarge of official functions. That is not what is\nhappening here.\nWhat is happening here is that the Federal\nTrade Commission for a time conducted testing on the tar\nand nicotine levels of cigarettes and stopped doing so.\nPhilip Morris asserts that that sequence of events\ncaused, in effect, a delegation of this authority. But\nwhat is really happening is that Philip Morris --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Do they cite any particular\ndocument or statement --\nMR. FREDERICK: No.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- that constitutes the\ndelegation?\nMR. FREDERICK: No. There is nothing,\nJustice Scalia. There is no regulation, this is no\norder, there is no policy statement, there is no\nstatement by the chairman of the FTC before Congress.\nThere is nothing.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So it's perfectly\nall right for them to adopt a new method of testing tar\nand nicotine that yields numbers that are far lower than\nthe Government's method, and to publish an ad saying\nthese are our tar and nicotine figures, and the FTC\nwould have no problem with that?\nMR. FREDERICK: Mr. Chief Justice, the\nanswer to your question is no. And the reason is that\nwhat the FTC did at the time was, it determined that\nthis particular Cambridge filter method was the\npreferred method for ascertaining the level of tar and\nnicotine in cigarettes. And in the D.C. Circuit\nopinion of Federal --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Not just the\npreferred method, but presumably the only one they would\nallow. If you used another one, they would bring a\ndeceptive trade practices action very quickly.\nMR. FREDERICK: That is correct. But what\nwas clear in the Brown & Williamson case decided by the\nD.C. Circuit, a panel of Judges Bork, Scalia and\nEdwards --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: They still might\nhave gotten it right.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. FREDERICK: They most assuredly did get\nit right, Mr. Chief Justice. What they held was that\nthat method, the Cambridge filter method, had not been\ndone according to rulemaking, a trade regulation rule;\nand that, therefore, there might be a testing mechanism\nthat would be different and better, but that with\nrespect to undertaking the deception analysis, which is\nwhat the FTC is charged by -- with doing under Section 5\nof the Federal Trade Commission -- Federal Trade Act, it\nhad to determine whether or not there would be some\nmethod that the cigarette makers were attempting to use\nthat would be deceptive; and what the court in the D.C.\nCircuit held was that there was no other method that had\nbeen determined at that time. There had been no\nstatement or proposed rule made by the FTC, and so for\npurposes of determining deception, that was the best\nthat could be done, while leaving open the possibility\nthat the FTC would promulgate the appropriate --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I understand\nyou have a dispute about whether that is this case, but\nthere are many areas where the Government requires\ntesting of products. You know, the strength of seat\nbelts and stuff, and they specify very precise means to\nwhich those tests have to be conducted.\nAnd if someone, a manufacturer is complying\nwith those requirements, and a challenge is brought,\nsaying something to the effect that that test doesn't\ngive you a good measure or something, in that situation\nwould this removal provision apply?\nMR. FREDERICK: No. Because that's merely\ncompliance with rule and not aiding or acting on behalf\nof the Government officer in a subordinate relationship\nin the discharge of function.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if the\nGovernment says you've got to test your cars, you know,\nevery three months or something, and you've got to send\nus the results of a random -- random test?\nMR. FREDERICK: The reporting of results\ndoesn't change the hypothetical. That's also compliance\nwith the law, and that happens all the time in the\nGovernment. The Department of Labor, the Department of\nCommerce, the Federal Reserve, all of those agencies\nroutinely require reporting on the part of industry.\nBut the reporting of information does not\ntransform a regulated entity into a Federal officer for\npurposes of these cases. And the court's cases are\nhighly instructive in this regard. Beginning with the\nact of 1815 that began the Federal officer removal, the\ncourt's cases have held that when a person is deemed to\nbe acting under, the person is acting in a subordinate\nrelationship to the Federal officer, merely complying\nwith the law does not transform a regulated entity into\nsomeone subordinate to the officer.\nAnd that subordinate relationship is what is\ncritical to understanding when in other contexts someone\nmight have a better claim to being a person acting under\na Federal officer than Philip Morris can assert in this\ncase.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: That is -- this is\ncertainly not your revenue officer needing help from a\ncitizen or the Federal agent going to close down a still\nduring Prohibition. But what about the Government\ncontractor cases that are cited, the Agent Orange was\none example?\nMR. FREDERICK: The Government contractor\ncases present a quite distinct set of issues that, of\ncourse, is not present in this case because there is no\ncontract between the Federal Trade Commission and Philip\nMorris. But I think that the proper way of looking at\nGovernment contractors is to look at contextually what\nis the nature of the contract? Does the contract\nprovide for ongoing supervision by the Federal officer\nand give the Federal officer the power to change or\nalter the conduct of the contracting party? Otherwise,\nmere specifications, detailed as they might be,\nconstitute simply compliance with the terms of the\ncontract rather than a subordinate relationship.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Do all these contracting\ncases involve the contractor imposing law upon somebody,\nexecuting law? On behalf of the Government?\nMR. FREDERICK: In a couple --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Because that's your test.\nI mean, and if that is the proper test, it ought to\napply in the Government contractor situation, too.\nSo, for example, the Government can hire a\nprivate company run prisons; but that would be the\nGovernment hiring somebody to perform Government --\nGovernment functions. Now, do all of those -- a\nfunction that remain as Government function, keeping the\nincarcerated incarcerated. Now do, do all of the\ncontract cases involve that?\nMR. FREDERICK: No. I think and that's why\nit would be --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well --\nMR. FREDERICK: -- a mistake for the Court\nto either categorically say all Government contractors\nare in or all Government contractors are out.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But that puts a whole new\ntheory on your --\nMR. FREDERICK: No, it doesn't.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Oh.\nMR. FREDERICK: Because my theory is that\nthe person acting under has to be aiding or acting on\nbehalf of a Federal officer in a subordinate\nrelationship in the performance of the officer's\nofficial functions. And in the case of some Government\ncontractors, like the chauffeur in Maryland versus\nSoper, for instance, who was an employee of the Reliable\nTransfer Company, he was hired by the Maryland Director\nof Prohibition to serve with the agents when they went\nout doing their investigations.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And he was acting under\ncolor of law as you've described that in your petitions?\nI don't think so.\nMR. FREDERICK: That's a different question,\nJustice Scalia. The question of under color of office\nas the statute defines it depends on the nature of the\nacts and whether there is a causal relationship between\nthe acts that are charged by the State in the State case\nand the actions of the people involved.\nIn the Soper case, the problem wasn't the\ncolor of office, because the chauffeur was out with the\nfour agents, and when there was a death that they\nstumbled upon, the question arose what were the nature\nof the facts, not whether the chauffeur was acting under\ncolor of office. That would be a distinct inquiry not\nrelated specifically to whether a person is acting\nunder, but that's the third part of this question.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I, I it seems to me\ncolor of office, you say color of office, it means that\nits appearance to somebody else is that -- that he is\nbeing an official. And I would think that that requires\nthe fact that he's assisting a Government agent in\nenforcing the law against somebody.\nMR. FREDERICK: And in the Medicare context\nthis happens. Blue Cross-Blue Shield, hired out by the\nGovernment to pursuant to a very detailed contract to\nengage in intermediary payments, and audits, forming\nGovernment functions. I think that is a paradigmatic\ninstance where the Government consists -- and has\nongoing supervisory relationship and a control over the\nconduct as it is implementing the Government's function.\nThe Government employment example, like\nSoper, where the chauffeur is hired and brought into\nwork with the agents, they're having a ongoing\nsupervisory relationship, telling him where to drive,\nwhat to do, where to go. They are able to alter his\nconduct in the same way.\nIn many procurement instances, that is not\ntrue.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: How, how do you\ndistinguish your Blue Cross example from the instance\nwhere drug companies are doing testing required by the\nFDA?\nMR. FREDERICK: That's compliance with the\nregulation. There are all sorts of instances,\nJustice Kennedy, where industry is required to do\ncertain things before they can bring their product to\nmarket. That's not acting --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Blue Cross is different\nbecause there they are acting as an intermediary of the\nGovernment?\nMR. FREDERICK: They are performing a\nfunction at the Government's direction for the\nGovernment. The Government used to --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that doesn't\nseem to be a distinction. The drug companies -- the\nGovernment wants to make sure that drugs are safe and\neffective and so they issue regulations saying here's\nhow you have to test it. They're just, you could say,\ndelegating the testing to the companies.\nMR. FREDERICK: No. Compliance doesn't\nconstitute a delegation, Mr. Chief Justice. And the\nreason is quite clear from the fact that the Code of\nFederal Regulations is full of all sorts of very\nspecific instructions to industry actors. But when they\ncomply with those rules they are not acting on behalf of\nthe Government. They are simply fulfilling a legal\nobligation that all Americans have to fulfill when\nconfronted with a question of Federal law.\nThe situation for acting under is different,\nand in the Medicaid context, there's a very special\nbureaucracy that has been created under the Secretary of\nHealth and Human Services to perform Government\nfunctions that used to be performed that are now\ncontracted out to Blue Cross-Blue Shield, and I\nacknowledge that that is a very different kind of\nsituation.\nBut the Government, of course, in a\nmulti-trillion-dollar budget purchases all sorts of\nitems all the time. Many of them are off the shelf.\nAnd others are subject to very specific and detailed\nspecifications.\nBut the compliance by a contractor with\nspecific and detailed instructions would not itself\ntransform that entity into a person acting under a\nFederal officer.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: There's a difference\nbetween you are providing products and complying with\ntesting. In other words, and if, in fact, the\nGovernment specifies precisely how the testing is\nsupposed to be done to determine whether it, the\nGovernment, will approve the marketing of a particular\ndrug, and the challenge, the litigation is to the\ntesting. Somebody sues as drugs company and says you\nknow, you tested this drug wrong, we think you should\nhave tested it some other way, and the drug company says\nthe Government told us how to test it -- why in that\nsituation aren't they acting under a Government\nofficial?\nMR. FREDERICK: Because it would be\ntransforming a preemption defense into an opportunity to\nuse a Federal officer removal to have a case from State\ncourt to Federal court. This Court has said many times\nthat preemption is an issue that can be decided by State\ncourts, and the mere fact that someone is complying with\ndetailed Federal regulations, and therefore is able to\nclaim the cause of action is preempted as a result of\nthose Federal regulations, does not transform the person\ninto a person acting under a Federal officer.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Just out of curiosity,\nwhat, what happens to the, the employees of the private\ncompanies that run prisons? Could they removed under\nthis provision?\nMR. FREDERICK: It depends on the nature of\nthe contract, Justice Scalia. The things that the Court\nwould look at would depend --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: They either run the prison\nfor a State, or for the Federal Government.\nMR. FREDERICK: What the Court --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- or the Federal\nGovernment.\nMR. FREDERICK: What the Court would look at\nis whether there is a ongoing supervisory relationship\nand whether the Federal officer has the power to\ntransform or alter the conduct. If those circumstances\nare met, then there would be a very strong argument that\nthe person is acting under the Federal officer.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, the prison case,\nthere's not any if about it. A State, municipality, has\na contract with a private entrepreneur to run a prison.\nOne question that I think must have come up\nin that context comes under the 1983 action in --\nagainst a, a prison guard, a privately hired prison\nguard.\nMR. FREDERICK: Of course, this Court has\nheld that in that context there is not State action in\nthat particular circumstance. In fact, in the Third\nCircuit, Philip Morris defended its actions against a\nvery similar claim regarding its marketing, that it was\nnot a State actor for purposes of a Bivens action or a\nSection 1983 claim.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Is that the test here? Is\nthat the test here? If it is State action, it is\ncovered by this statute. If it isn't, it is not?\nMR. FREDERICK: There -- that would\ncertainly be a simple way to determine whether a person\nis acting under a Federal officer, if it meets the\nentwinement test articulated by this Court in that case.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But suppose it doesn't.\nMR. FREDERICK: If it doesn't --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Should I conclude it\ntherefore is not covered?\nMR. FREDERICK: No, I think that the proper\nstandard, Justice Scalia, as I've said, is whether there\nis a ongoing supervisory relationship and the Government\nhas the power to alter the actor's conduct. If those\ntwo conditions are met then a person can be said to be\nacting under the Federal officer within the meaning of\nthis statute.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I don't follow that. The\nGovernment is always altering people's conduct when it\nregulates them.\nMR. FREDERICK: But not on a basis that is I\nthink appropriate to understand a subordinate\nrelationship. The fact that there is alteration through\nGovernment regulation is simply compliance with law.\nBut to be acting under within the meaning of this\nCourt's cases -- and I would direct the Court to the\nGreenwood case, which the other side basically\nignores -- in that case, in footnotes 17 and 20, this\nCourt made clear that the phrase \"acting under\" is\nacting in that kind of subordinate relationship in the\nexecution of laws. Compliance is insufficient.\nOtherwise, it would blow the whole statute apart.\nEverybody in a regulated industry would able to remove\nunder the Federal officer statute.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Has it been done? I\nmean, this is -- I don't recall any case like this. Are\nthere other product liability cases that are removed\nfrom State court to Federal Court on a similar basis?\nMR. FREDERICK: Justice Ginsburg, in our\ncert papers, and we didn't repeat them in our merits\npapers, we give examples where a window blinds\nmanufacturer, a medical device manufacturer, a whole\nseries of others, a bank, a credit union, have attempted\n-- after the Eighth Circuit's decision in this case have\nremoved cases to Federal court on the grounds that they\nare Federal officers because they are subjected to far\nmore extensive regulations than Philip Morris.\nIn fact, if you turn to volume 16 of the\nCode of Federal Regulations and turn to part 408,\nthere's a heading, and it says Deceptive Unfair\nAdvertising of Cigarettes For Health Benefits. Then\nunderneath it it says \"intentionally left blank.\" And\nthe argument that these other entities have made is\nthere are no Federal regulations concerning the\nmarketing of \"light\" cigarettes but there are\nregulations concerning our products. So therefore, we\nmust be a Federal officer because the regime governing\nus is far more specific and detailed than it is for\ncigarettes.\nIf I could reserve the balance of my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Frederick.\nMr. Gornstein.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF IRVING L. GORNSTEIN,\nON BEHALF OF UNITED STATES AS AMICUS CURIAE,\nSUPPORTING PETITIONERS\nMR. GORNSTEIN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may\nit please the Court.\nManufacturers of cars, drugs, medical\ndevices, pesticides, home appliances and numerous other\nconsumer good market their products in accordance with\ndetailed and specific Federal Government regulation.\nIf that in a colorable preemption defense\nwere sufficient to trigger removal, then it would create\nthe potential for a very major shift of traditional\nState law litigation from State to Federal court.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Do they test their products\nbefore they're marketed under rigid Federal testing\nregulations which are supervised by the Federal\nGovernment?\nMR. GORNSTEIN: Let me talk about -- there\nare, there are numerous testing requirements. The\nautomobile industry has to test for fuel efficiency; it\nhas to test for crash testing under very specific\nrequirements. The home appliances have to be tested for\nenergy efficiency under Federal requirements --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Is the Government\nsupervising those?\nMR. GORNSTEIN: Is -- the Government often\nsays exactly what the test has to be.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yeah, but is there some\nGovernment official who's there to make sure that the\ntesting is being done the way, the way it's supposed to\nbe, which is what, what is argued is the case here?\nMR. GORNSTEIN: Well, I -- I -- I can't say\nin every case that somebody is there to make sure --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: They don't have to be there\nevery day.\nMR. GORNSTEIN: But -- the Government is --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Policing --\nMR. GORNSTEIN: Policing and enforcing the\ntesting requirements, and there's testing in all these\nareas. The other thing to say is that there's no --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What's -- what's\nyour conclusion? That those are not people acting under\nFederal officers --\nMR. GORNSTEIN: They are not people acting,\nbecause if they --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Because policing\nsounds like --\nMR. GORNSTEIN: The Government's policing is\nenforcing the law. People who are, who are regulating\ntheir products in accordance with detailed and specific\nFederal Government regulation are acting on their own\nbehalf in marketing the products in -- on -- in\ncompliance with Federal law.\nThey are not acting under Federal officers\n-- within the meaning of the Federal -- within the\nmeaning of this statute.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What about -- what\nabout USDA food inspection? Isn't a lot of that\ndelegated to the producers rather than the Government\nofficials?\nMR. GORNSTEIN: The Government --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But you still get a\nGovernment stamp.\nMR. GORNSTEIN: You can have different\nsituations. And I'm not sure about the precise one\nyou're talking about. But you can have situations and\nthe FAA is one, where the FAA has a statute which says\nyou can delegate to third parties inspecting aircrafts,\nand the Agency certifies through regulation that this\nperson is inspecting as a representative of the FAA.\nNow that's a varied situation. In that kind of\nsituation the person would acting under. But if the\nperson is simply complying with Federal requirements\nabout how to test, that is private behavior, acting on\ntheir own behalf, in order to further the marketing of\ntheir products.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So if you are a\nfederally certified inspector you are acting under --\nMR. GORNSTEIN: Certified as a\nrepresentative of the FAA, yes, you are.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What about private\ntransportation of mail? Is the private contractor who's\ncarrying U.S. mail, is that person -- could he remove a\ncase under this provision.\nMR. GORNSTEIN: The standard for contracts\nis some contracts are in and some contracts are out in\nour minds, depending on whether the -- they are subject\nto the guidance, supervision, or control of federal\nofficers. And so if they are performing a service on\nbehalf of the federal government and they are subject to\ncontrol or supervision, then they could be acting under\nfederal officers.\nNow the situation here, the test that the\ncourt of appeals used, simply acting in conformity with\ndetailed and specific Federal regulation, is one that\nwould lead, as I said, to a very substantial change in\nwhere State court claims have been litigated up until\nnow.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I have a contract to\nprovides food to the Senate cafeteria, okay. And the\nSenate or maybe the Executive Branch, for that matter,\nclosely supervises my preparation and service of that\nfood. Am I acting under, even though I'm not assisting\nthe Government in any governmental function at all?\nDon't you have to be assisting in the performance of a\ngovernmental function?\nMR. GORNSTEIN: But the problem with that,\nwhat you're saying, is the 1948 statute expanded it all\nFederal officers. So if Federal officers were running\nthat cafeteria, those Federal officers could remove\nbecause they are performing a duty under Federal law to\nprovide that service to Federal employees.\nNow, once the statute expanded out in 1948\nto cover Federal officers who perform any function, not\njust enforcement functions, it carried with it persons\nwho act under Federal officers in performing those very\nsame functions. So if the Federal Government hired an\nemployee to serve food who was acting under a Federal\nofficer who was responsible for the delivery of food,\nthat person would be acting under a Federal officer\nwithin the meaning of this statute, assuming that the\nperson was subject to the control, guidance, and\noversight in the delivery of that food.\nNow, this case is very far from the\nhistorical examples of citizens being called upon by\ncustoms officers to assist in the enforcement of the\nrevenue laws or the chauffeur who was, under a Federal\nemployment contract, who then -- assisted revenue\nofficers in carrying out a raid on a distillery, or the\nmilitary corporal who was involved in assisting Federal\nofficers in making an arrest.\nThose are the historical examples. They\npoint to the principle that you are talking about people\nwho are in a subordinate position and who are acting on\nbehalf of or otherwise assisting Federal officers in\ncarrying out their duties.\nAs for the alternative ground for affirmance\nhere, that is that there has been a delegation, testing\ndelegation of authority, there has been no delegation of\nauthority. It is unusual for the Government to delegate\nout its own regulatory responsibilities to the very\nindustry it is regulating and it didn't do that here.\nWhat the Government did is that it had at one time its\nown testing program. It eliminated that testing program\naltogether, which had not been required by statute but\nwas simply the result of a commission vote. And after\nthat, the industry continued to carry on the very\ntesting that it had been doing all along as a result of\nan agreement among industry participants. Now, even if\n--\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You don't care what\nkind of testing they do? They can change the method and\nchange the way to resolve --\nMR. GORNSTEIN: Actually, the Federal Trade\nCommission cannot require the particular testing method.\nBut even if you assume it could, Mr. Chief Justice, that\nwould simply be a regulatory condition on the marketing\nof a product. And acting in accordance with a\nregulatory condition on the marketing of a product is\nnot acting under a Federal officer, for the reasons I've\ndiscussed.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Gornstein, was there\nany Government litigation against the cigarette\ncompanies?\nMR. GORNSTEIN: There has been Government\nlitigation against the cigarette companies for\nallegations that are very similar to the complaint in\nthis case except that it is being brought under the RICO\nstatute. That litigation is pending in the D.C. Circuit\nand the basic allegation, one of the allegations of the\ncomplaint, is that the cigarette companies have falsely\nmarketed their products as being lest dangerous than\nother products when, in fact, they are not.\nNow, the final point to be made is, even if\nthere was a delegation of authority here, it would not\naffect the disposition of this case because this\ncomplaint does not challenge the testing itself.\nWhat this complaint says is that these --\nthat the Respondent here engaged in deceptive\nadvertising by essentially designing cigarettes that\nwould cheat the test and then marketing the cigarettes\nas light when in fact they are not.\nIf the Court has no further questions --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Gornstein.\nMr. Olson.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. OLSON: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nThe heart of this lawsuit is that official\nFTC tar and nicotine ratings generated by testing\nperformed by Respondents under the FTC's supervision and\ntransmitted to the public in Respondent's advertising at\nthe FTC's insistence is misleading; therefore, the\ncreation and transmission of the allegedly misleading\ndata for which Respondents are being sued were acts\nperformed by Respondents to assist the FTC in performing\nits official responsibilities.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Did the FTC ever adopt a\nregulation saying you've got publish these measurements?\nMR. OLSON: No. The FTC did not do it\nthrough a regulation. If the Court were to look at\npages 93 to 110 of the Joint Appendix, you would see\ntestimony by the Chairman of the FTC and the head of the\nconsumer protection part of the FTC saying: We chose\nnot to do it by regulation because we found that it was\nmuch more efficient, much more fast, and much for\neffective to force the tobacco companies into what is\ncalled a voluntary agreement requiring precisely that\ninformation.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But if one of the companies\nhad said, we're sick of doing this, we don't like the\nnumbers we're getting, whatever, we're just not going to\ndo it, presumably if we, you know, accept that testimony\nat face value, the FTC would have moved and said, okay,\nI guess we're going to have to have a reg or a statute\nor what-not. During that period of time, the company\nwouldn't be committing any offense?\nMR. OLSON: Yes, it would. In a 1978\nadvisory opinion, which is found on pages 202 of the\njoint appendix, the FTC stated categorically -- and the\njoint appendix, by the way, Justice Souter, is full of\nexactly what I'm talking about. The FTC said tar values\nin cigarette advertising must be consistent with the\nlatest FTC number and stated that it would be deceptive\nto advertise higher numbers or lower numbers or\ndifferent numbers. In other words, the enforcement\nwouldn't be through the enactment of a regulation. The\nFTC -- again, I refer to the testimony of the Chairman\nof the FTC: The FTC does things this way because --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: What is this -- I'm just\nnot following it. What is the source of the so-called\n\"FTC number\" to which advertising must conform?\nMR. OLSON: The source of the FTC number is\nthe FTC test, alternatively called the Cambridge filter\ntest.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: The Cambridge test, yes.\nMR. OLSON: But the FTC calls it the FTC\ntest. It was devised by the FTC. It has a specific set\nof requirements. The FTC itself performed that test for\na number of years. Then in 1987 the test was\ntransmitted -- the FTC stopped doing it and allowed the\nindustry to do it itself because the -- again, in that\nsame testimony by the Chairman of the Commission, he\nsaid that: It will be more effective and easier for us,\nand we can use our funds for other purposes if the\nindustry does it.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I understand that. But if\nthe -- if a given cigarette manufacturer simply said,\nwe're not going to give any numbers, we're simply going\nto say \"Smoke Marlboros,\" and the FTC wanted numbers and\nthey wanted the numbers in accordance with the Cambridge\ntesting method, they would then have had to regulate,\nadopt a regulation, or get Congress to pass a statute.\nMR. OLSON: It's fairly -- what happened,\nit's fairly clear from what the FTC has said, they would\nbring an action for deceptive advertising if there was\nanything involved in the marketing of those cigarettes\nthat had to do with tar and nicotine levels.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. Now, in my hypo they\njust say: Look, we're just going to say \"Smoke\nMarlboros.\" We're not going to say the nicotine is low\nor anything. The FTC would not at that point have any\nbasis to charge a violation?\nMR. OLSON: No, they wouldn't. But that is\nnot of course this case. This case involves --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: All I'm getting at is the\nFTC had no basis other than a voluntary agreement to\nrequire them to publish any numbers or to publish any\nnumbers in accordance with the Cambridge --\nMR. OLSON: The history of that is set forth\nin the record and it's clear.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Right.\nMR. OLSON: And the answer is that the FTC\nannounced a proposed rule. It then sent a letter to the\ntobacco companies saying, it would be much easier for us\nand much easier for you to enter into a voluntary\nagreement. It gave them 30 days to come up with a\nvoluntary agreement. They produced an agreement which\nthe FTC rejected because it allowed certain flexibility\nwith respect to the testing and didn't adhere\nspecifically to the FTC test that you're referring to.\nIt rejected that first agreement. The\ntobacco companies came back with another agreement. The\nFTC accepted that agreement and said that it would\nenforce the voluntary agreement against the tobacco\ncompanies and if they deviated from it they'd return to\nthe rulemaking process.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Again, you're talking\nabout an agency that has set certain standards that the\nentity its regulating must meet. They must meet all\nkinds of requirements for certain kinds of tests by\nOSHA, say, for example. Think of pesticides, think of\nhazardous substance -- quite precise tests that the\nGovernment says you must make this test before you\nmarket that dangerous product.\nI don't see how cigarettes are any different\nfrom hazardous wastes, pesticides, just the vast number\nof potentially dangerous to health products that are\nmarketed and the Government says: We're not going to\nlet you put those things out on the market unless you go\nthrough a certain testing regimen. That doesn't make\nthe party an agent of the Government for the testing\npurposes.\nMR. OLSON: Let me see if I can answer that\nquestion, Justice Ginsburg. This is not merely\ncompliance with the rule. This is not merely testing of\nproducts. The FTC created the standard. It created the\ntesting mechanism. It performed the tests according to\nvery detailed criteria. Those tests are now performed\nby the industry for the FTC. Those test results must be\nreported to the FTC. The FTC then reports those results\nto Congress and publishes them in the Federal Register\nas the official FTC tobacco ratings, and then the FTC\nrequires --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: They are called FTC\nratings?\nMR. OLSON: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And they are called -- in\nthe regulations it's called the FTC test, even after it\nhas been done by the companies?\nMR. OLSON: Yes, yes, Justice Scalia. And\nin the case that you --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's very careless, isn't\nit?\nMR. OLSON: It's not careless. They are\npronouncing the facts.\nAnd in a case that you participated in in\nthe D.C. Circuit, the brief in that case, the Brown and\nWilliamson case that was mentioned before Justice Bork\nwrote the opinion, in that brief I counted -- I stopped\ncounting about 10 or 12 times after the words \"the FTC\ntest methodology,\" the \"FTC official ratings,\" the FTC\nthis, the FTC that.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But there must be many\ntimes when an agency prescribes a test that a regulated\nparty must comply with. It's still a relationship of a\nregulator, the FTC, sets standards that the regulated\nparty has to meet. I just don't see -- it could be\ncalled \"the FTC test,\" but it's a test for what? Are\nyou complying with the law when you're manufacturing and\nmarketing this product?\nMR. OLSON: Let me try again,\nJustice Ginsburg. If the FTC had said to four local\nhospitals, please perform this test according to this\nspecification for us, the FTC, and then give us these\nresults, which we will then publish as the FTC official\nratings of cigarettes, and then if those hospitals were\nsued because the testing and the results were alleged to\nbe misleading, I think even the government would admit\nthat that case could be removed under the Federal\nofficer removal statute. There is nothing --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: What if in your hypo the\nGovernment came along and said, in order to run your\nhospital, you've got to disclose certain facts.\nOtherwise we're going to shut it down. And those facts\nfrom that point on are like your hypo. Would your\nconclusion then follow, that they were acting under?\nMR. OLSON: No. It would be a vastly\ndifferent situation.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Why isn't that the\nsituation that we've got here?\nMR. OLSON: The difference, the difference\nis, is that, A, the test is, is -- the FTC and the\nrecord is full of this, too; the FTC set a goal for\nitself very early in the regulatory process. It wanted\nconsumers to purchase lower tar and nicotine cigarettes.\nNow how was it going to accomplish that, the FTC goal?\nIt devised this test. It made it official FTC test.\nOfficial FTC ratings. What this is doing is\nconscripting in a way or accepting here's what the --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought that,\nMr. Olson, that the cigarette companies wanted to make a\nlight brand so that they could keep customers who might\nbe tempted to quit if there was only the heavy kind.\nBut to say that, the light cigarettes were forced on the\ncigarette companies by the FTC certainly --\nMR. OLSON: Well, in, in 29 -- this is in\nthe record. The FTC set forth goals, it's 29 Federal\nRegister 530, in -- on January 22, 1964, that the FTC\ndescribed its goal as to encourage the development of\nless hazardous cigarettes. That was done in conjunction\nwith a earlier or a contemporaneous -- nearly\ncontemporaneous Surgeon General report which is reported\nat joint appendix pages 57 to 60, that the Government\nhad as its goal the responsible promotion of cigarettes\nlow in tar and nicotine. Now I'm not saying --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, any product that\nthe Government supervises, certainly the Government\nwould want to promote a safer -- I mean, think of a jet\nski. Think of -- products are marketed because people\nwant them, and off course the Government as supervisor\nwill want to encourage a safer product. But let me ask\nyou a different question, Mr. Olson.\nThe removal area has been really closely\nguarded by Congress. You know it's not easy to get a\ncase out of State court and move it to the Federal\ncourt. In fact, Congress has said if the Federal court\nshifts it back, no matter how wrong a that decision was,\nit stays in the State court.\nOne can't remove -- you may have a wonderful\nFederal defense, a preemption defense. You can't remove\non that basis. You may have a counterclaim, so you're\nreally the same as a plaintiff. You can't remove on the\nbasis of a counterclaim.\nWell, Congress has been so careful to let\nthe State courts do State tort litigation. Then we are\nsupposed to read into a Federal officer removal statute,\nthat kind of, the removal of a State tort case from\nState court to Federal court? Because that's quite the\nfashion.\nMR. OLSON: The Government says that the\ntest is -- is, that if an individual, private actor, is\nassisting the Federal Government in performing the\nofficial Government function, the case is appropriate to\nbe removed. That is what the Government says section\n1441(a)(1) means. This Court has said that section\nshall be liberally construed, not narrow or limited in\nits construction, and not frustrated by a narrow,\ngrudging interpretation.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Is this right? If I have\nit -- I'm using sort of a silly example to explain it to\nmyself. But I'm thinking the FDA -- or no, the\nAgriculture Department decides they're really interested\nin red apples not being red. So they say we hire\nthousands of apple lookers, and the apple lookers look\nat all the apples and they devise a redness test which\nis really fabulous, you know, very precise.\nMR. OLSON: The apple lookers' device?\nJUSTICE BREYER: No. The FDA. The FDA has\nthe apple looking redness test, and the apple lookers\napply the test. And if you pass the test, you can say\nred apple, and if you don't pass the test you don't.\nNow I'll give you two different things that happen. One\nday because of budget cuts the FDA hires a lipstick\ncompany to look, because they're experts on redness;\nthey know how to perform a test.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: The other possibility is\nthey say to the apple companies, you do your own\nlooking. Now I think there'd be the difference that\nyou're trying to argue, and I don't think it cuts or\nyou. Because in the first case, what they've done is\nhire somebody to perform a governmental function. In\nthe second case, what they've done is to the people who\nare regulated and have the interest, in announcing they\nhave red apples, they've said, you do it yourself.\nMR. OLSON: Ah, but Justice Breyer, what\nhappens here is they say you do it yourself, and the\nChairman of the -- Chairman of the FTC said why. Here's\nwhy; he said it's better undertaken by private\nresearchers. It's a mechanism that we can rely on to\nensure accurate reporting.\nThen, what the FTC did is to supervise the\nperformance of the test. It goes into the laboratories.\nIt makes sure it has done it its way. And then it\naccepts those results --\nJUSTICE BREYER: That wouldn't be relevant,\nbecause the -- the problem with the, with the approach\nthat you're taking, as I see it, would be that, that\nthere are probably a lot of instances where a regulated\nfirm, the regulation meaning yes/no, market/not market;\nyes/no, advertise/not advertise, performs all kinds of\ntests to see if it is yes or no.\nAnd if you're going to start taking that\nkind of firm and breaking it apart to say whether it's\ndoing the testing part or some other part, you're really\nopening the gates.\nMR. OLSON: But we're -- we're not. We're\nsuggesting -- you're -- what you're doing in your\nquestion and your statement is to disaggregate the\npieces of the process here. Here it is the FTC's goal,\nit's FTC's method; it's the FTC's test which is\nsupervised but done by the companies. And then it\nbecomes the FTC official ratings which they then must\ntransmit to the company in their advertising. And now\nthey're sued because those ratings that they've done\naccording, for the FTC, according to the FTC standards,\nare alleged to be misleading.\nSo it's -- it's not possible to disaggregate\nit. It is a whole spectrum; the testing itself and the\nreporting -- is done by the industry because the\nFTC wants it as its official numbers, and it wants its\nofficial numbers given to the consumers. And it is\nsetting an advisory opinion, even if you tell them that\nyour cigarettes have higher tar or lower tar, if you\ndon't report our numbers, you will be sued for deceptive\nadvertising.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. So what you are\nsaying is that this function is so separable and it is\nso much a FTC function and it is so much like delegating\nit to the third party that did nothing of the testing,\nthat even if you delegate it to the second party which\ndoes testing and then benefits from the testing, that's\nstill not enough to take it out.\nMR. OLSON: What I was saying in answer --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Is that -- have I got that\nright?\nMR. OLSON: I think so. Let me restate it,\nbecause I think I understand what you've said.\nAnd I think what I was trying to say with\nrespect to Justice Ginsburg's question, if the -- all\nthose private hospitals did it, I think the Government\nwould admit, the Federal -- and then is there an\nexception in the statute? If the regulated entity, in\nthis case the tobacco company, does it rather than the\nhospital? And there's nothing in the statute that says\nthat.\nJUSTICE BREYER: No. But I -- so, so to use\nmy silly example, I mean, it is like the lipstick\ncompany. You're saying, well if they did it to the\nlipstick company it would be clearly that they're the\nGovernment agent. And it is so technical, so\ngovernmental, so heavily involved with the Government\nfor testing, that even though you give it to the apple\ngrowers themselves, they are still Government agents\nwhen they perform it.\nMR. OLSON: The Agency decided they are any\n--\nJUSTICE BREYER: I, I see the argument now.\nMR. OLSON: Yeah.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Then is there any, any\nauthority ever, that you found for that?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. OLSON: This is, as the Eighth Circuit\nsaid, a very unusual situation. But the closest\nanalogies are, are to the Government contractor cases.\nAnd by the way, it doesn't require a contract to be\nacting under the supervision. I heard the Government\nsay that what you had to have is someone supervised by\nthe Government with the Government's power to alter the\nactor's conduct.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well there's one\ndifferent. If you're doing it for the Government, the\nGovernment says we want Agent Orange; we know it's a\nvery dangerous substance. So they give you an order;\nwe're going to make very precise specifications. But\nyou're doing it for us. We, the Government, want that,\nand so we are going to put tight controls on your\nmanufacturing it for us.\nA little was different from a commercial\ncompany going out to sell market goods to the public at\nlarge?\nMR. OLSON: Justice, I understand there's a\ndistinction. Because the Government is the actual\nconsumer of that product. But here the Government\nannounced that its goals were to accomplish a market in\nlower tar cigarettes. And it said with respect to the\ntesting, it's better undertaken by private researchers.\nSo it was fulfilling the Government's desire to have\nsomething they could save the money, if they close down\nthe laboratory, they said in this testimony, we'll use\nthe money for enforcement pumps against the cigarette\ncompany. We can regulate and determine, fulfill the\nofficial functions of the Government more effectively,\nmore efficiently if we do it this way.\nSo it is the Government's objective. It is\nthe Government's results they are seeking to obtain.\nAnd they've conscripted voluntarily the industry to do\nthe thing for it and then it calls it its official\nresults.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Have, have they imposed its\nofficial -- has it imposed, the FTC, its official\nresults on any company that was not a participant in\nthis -- in this testing lab?\nMR. OLSON: I don't know the answer to that.\nI think the answer is no. I think that what, what the\nFTC was able to accomplish at that time was to get every\n-- the major players in the marketplace with respect to\nparticipation in this. I don't know --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Your case would be stronger\nif they weren't doing it just for themselves. If in\nfact that they were doing it for the FTC who imposed it\neven on somebody else.\nMR. OLSON: That's the private hospital\nexample that we were talking about.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yeah.\nMR. OLSON: I don't know that it would be\nstronger. Why would it be weaker --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Because here you're doing\nit for yourself. You want to advertise low -- low --\nlow tar cases. And the FTC says the only way we'll let\nyou do it, the only way we'll let do you that\nadvertising is if you test them pursuant to this, this\nsystem that we established.\nAnd you say okay. We'll test them pursuant\nto the system you've established and -- and everybody\ngoes happily away.\nMR. OLSON: Well, that happens to be --\nthere happens to be a coincidence of what the Government\nwants to accomplish and what the industry is willing to\nand wants to accomplish. I'll accept that. So does\nthat mean there's an exception to the Federal officer\nremoval statute, if the person who is asked to help the\nGovernment, does help the Government, is sued because\nhis actions in helping the Government occasioned someone\nto bring a law suit?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Olson , you've\nbeen talking a lot about testing. But when you look at\nthe complaint in this case, testing is a small part of\nit. They're complaining about the modification of the\ntobacco blend, the weight, rod length, the\ncircumference, use of reconstituted tobacco sheets. In\nother words there's a lot going on here in the complaint\nhere besides the testing. And if the Government is in\nno way specifying the tobacco blend, the weight, the\nlength, all these other things that are allegedly part\nof the manipulation to affect the figures.\nMR. OLSON: Well, in the first place if\nthere's anything in the complaint that allows a removal\nthen the case can be removed. That's the Exxon versus\nAllapattah case that the Court decided just a couple of\nterms ago. But secondly, let me address directly what\nyou are saying.\nThroughout the complaint, in the complaint\nitself, I found references to the testing machine or\nmethod eight times in the complaint. They say -- they\ncomplain about representations that cigarettes contain\nless tar and nicotine than regular cigarettes. They\nbase that on the test results. They then say as\nmeasured by the industry standard testing apparatus.\nAnd let me refer to what the Petitioners\nsaid in their motion to remand to the State court. They\ncomplained -- they said the basis of this complaint is\nmisleading low tar and nicotine ratings as measured by\nthe company's testing procedures. That's in the\nPetitioners' motion to remand. Furthermore, the\ndistrict court interpreted the complaint precisely the\nway we are explaining this to the Court today. The\ndistrict court said that over and over again, words of\nthe district court at page 42a of the petition appendix,\nthe court concludes that the FTC's regulation of the\ncigarette companies' testing and advertising cuts to the\nheart of the plaintiff's lawsuit.\nWell, the heart of the plaintiff's lawsuit\nis testing and advertising. The testing is required by\nthe FTC. The results of the testings are the FTC's\nnumbers. And the advertising contains the FTC's numbers\nbecause the FTC requires it. The circuit court\ninterpreted --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But the company is doing\nit so it can stay in business and market this product,\nnot as a service to the U.S. Government.\nMR. OLSON: I don't deny that the -- the\nRespondents in this case are engaged in industry. A\nregulated industry by the FTC. And that's correct,\nJustice Ginsburg.\nI don't think there's an exception. And the\nGovernment hasn't suggested there's an exception in the\nFederal officer removal statute because someone happens\nto be in the industry which is asked to help the\nGovernment perform a particular function. There is no\nlogic to that, and it certainly would be not a liberal\ninterpretation of the Federal officer removal statute.\nThe circuit court also said the very -- and\nI think this is worth noting, at page 15a of the\nappendix to the cert petition, the very combination the\nplaintiff challenges as deceptive is the same\ncombination the FTC requires not to be -- to put in your\nadvertising in order not to be deceptive.\nSo what is required by the FTC of the\nplaintiffs, the advertising of these test -- official\ntest results -- is precisely what the Petitioners say,\nand the Petitioners say is deceptive. That's the basis\nfor their lawsuit.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well that's a good, that's\na good preemption argument.\nMR. OLSON: If the --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I'm not sure it has much\nbearing upon whether --\nMR. OLSON: Well, it is a good preemption\nargument, Justice Scalia. That will be played out\neither in the State court, depending upon how you rule,\nor the Federal court. But it's -- that's the nexus and\nthe color of Federal authority that you talked about in\nyour dissenting opinion in that Acker case.\nThe Court in the Acker case, Jefferson\nCounty versus Acker, said that the allegations in the\npetition and in the removal petition must be -- and\nespecially since they weren't challenged in this case,\nthe factual allegations and the characterization of the\ncomplaint were not challenged in this case -- must be\naccepted as true by this Court. And Chief Justice\nRoberts, it's not only the allegations in the complaint\nand the characterization in the removal petition, but\nit's what the district court decided the complaint said.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I know all that's involved\nhere is the forum and removal; but if we were to rule\nfor you that there' is Federal officer status here,\nwould that effect any of the substantive determinations\non the preemption question, etcetera?\nMR. OLSON: No, I don't think so. I think\n--\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: It's just a forum\nquestion?\nMR. OLSON: Yes, it is. And this is an\nappropriate case for evaluation of the conduct of the\nperson acting --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I have a quick question.\nIs there anything in the complaint that alleges you\ndidn't perform the tests properly?\nMR. OLSON: Yes. Yes. There is. But as I\nsaid, that is not -- I mean, the part of the complaint,\nas the district court saw it and the circuit court saw\nit, is much more than that. It's the testing and so on\nand so forth. And I don't think it would make any\ndifference because even if there's an allegation, which\nthere is in the complaint, that the test was manipulated\nor gained or circumvented, it goes back to whether it's\na good test or not.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I don't understand\nyour response to Justice Kennedy. If we determine that\nyou're acting under the direction of a Federal officer,\nthat would seem to me highly pertinent on the merits of\na preemption argument. So it would not be just the\nforum, but kind of getting into the preemption merits.\nMR. OLSON: Well, it may perhaps be. But\nwhat, it's an interpretation of the statute. I don't\nthink there's any doubt about that anyway, Chief Justice\nRoberts, because it's clear that what was being done\nhere is something that the FTC wanted done in the way\nthe FTC wanted it done. I don't know how the -- I\nbelieve that the preemption argument is very, very\nstrong, because the lawsuit, the substance, the guts,\nthe core, the heart of the lawsuit, as the district\ncourt said and the Eighth Circuit said is, you're doing\nwhat the FTC required you to do, and the plaintiffs say\nthat it's deceptive.\nAnd by the way, it's very clear from the\nrecord in the joint appendix and in the district court\ndecision and in the remand in the motion -- the motion\nto -- the petition to remove, that the FTC knew exactly\nthe deficiencies that are alleged in the complaint.\nThe FTC has been aware of the fact that\npeople smoke differently, that cigarette -- the design\nof a cigarette may affect the outcome of the test. But\nwhat the FTC, knowing that full well, said, well, people\nmight smoke things differently and you might get more\ntar and nicotine than the FTC ratings produce. And the\nFTC with full awareness said, we understand all that,\nbut what we want is for the consumers to have an ability\nto compare this cigarette with this cigarette, and we\nhave devised a test that will allow you to compare an\napple to an apple. Now there are other things that will\n--\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It all comes back to me\nnow, that case you mentioned. Lip drape, that was the\nlip drape case, wasn't it, where people smoke\ndifferently because some of them cover up the holes in\nthe filter when their lips -- the lip drape. The naked\nlip drape.\nMR. OLSON: That is the case. I don't know\nif you've charactered it the same way I did, but the\napples to apples thing is tied in with your\nhypothetical, Justice Breyer, about the apple\ninspectors.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Is it the apple institute\nwho's doing the testing?\nMR. OLSON: It's the Tobacco Institute\ntesting facility --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, I said apple institute.\nYou know, that seemed to me to be the case where it was\nthe apple institute or whatever it was that was the\ndelegate, and then they applied the test, and the people\nthey were applying the test to weren't.\nMR. OLSON: It's a facility of the tobacco\nindustry. The FTC perceives it as -- these industries\n-- and these companies, and as I said, even the\npetitioners in their remand petition are challenging the\nlow tar and nicotine rate measured by the company's\ntesting procedures. So yes, I'd like to have it be\nsomething different but it isn't something different.\nIt is what the companies have done, and through this\nmechanism.\nThis case comes down to the fact that the\nFTC wanted certain things done. It decided how certain\nthings would be done. It calls the results of those the\nofficial FTC ratings. It wants those ratings delivered\nto the people. And the tobacco companies have done that\nand they're being sued because they say -- because that\ninformation which they're delivering, that they're\ncreating and delivering at the request of the\nGovernment, is alleged to be deceptive. This is the\nperfect case for a removal under the federal officer\nremoval statute.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Olson.\nMr. Frederick, two minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID C. FREDERICK\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. FREDERICK: If this is a perfect case\nfor Federal officer removal, there are easily 40,000\nothers in the State courts waiting to he removed.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, how many others\ninvolve the agency calling the result of the private\naction the FTC figures and the FTC test?\nMR. FREDERICK: I don't know the answer to\nthat, but I can tell you that in lots and lots of areas,\nthe Federal Government wants safer, cleaner cars, safer\nrefrigerators --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But they don't -- they\ndon't put it out to the public as the Federal\nGovernment's figures.\nMR. FREDERICK: They do --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That makes a big\ndifference.\nMR. FREDERICK: It does not make a\ndifference. And the reason it doesn't make a difference\nis if you look on your refrigerator, if you look on your\nlawn mower, if you look on your automobile, there are\nGovernment standard tests that have to be complied with\nfor an industry to be able to sell its products. And if\nPhilip Morris is correct here, you are going to be\nannouncing a dramatic transformation of the role of\nFederal and State courts, because every time there is\neven a colorable argument for preemption, the industry\nwill take the case to Federal court saying we're acting\nunder the Federal officer, and therefore, don't --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Just don't call it the\nGovernment's test. Don't call it the Government's\nfigures. Call it the industry's figures.\nMR. FREDERICK: The description shouldn't\nmake a difference, particularly where it is in a\nvoluntary agreement that was not put out for notice and\ncomment rulemaking, and it was done for precisely this\nreason, Justice Scalia. For decades, the cigarette\ncompanies were rightly perceived as deceiving the public\nabout the health content of their products.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Now the FTC told us\nwhy they did it. They did it because they could save\nthe money by having the industry do it rather than them\ndoing it.\nMR. FREDERICK: They also said, Mr. Chief\nJustice, that they expected the companies to police each\nother, which is exactly what happened when the Barclay\ncigarette came up. Philip Morris was the one that\ncomplained and said that cigarette doesn't comply, it's\nbeen manipulating the FTC Cambridge filter method. So\nthe FTC found a cheaper way to do regulation.\nCompliance with rules does not transform an entity into\na Federal officer. Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel.\n"
