ZINN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMS. ZINN: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may\nit please the Court:\nSovereign immunity should not bar enforcement of\nthe consent decree in this case for two reasons.\nFirst, when State officials ask a district court\nto enter a consent decree, they submit their rights\nconcerning the decree for judicial determination, thereby\nwaiving any possible claim for objection on the basis of\nimmunity.\nSecond, the decree in this case provides\nprospective relief to protect the supremacy of Federal\nlaw, exactly as envisioned by Ex Parte Young.\nQUESTION: May I ask on -- on the first point?\nYou say when State officials submit to -- to a decree.\nIt's -- it's immaterial, as far as you're concerned,\nwhether the State Attorney General defended the -- the\nsuit or represented these officials. Is that right?\nMS. ZINN: No, it's not immaterial. The --\nTexas' Attorney General is authorized by the legislature\nto represent the State and its employees --\nQUESTION: No. I understand that, but suppose\nhe hadn't been and suppose it is just the State officials\nwho appeared in an Ex Parte Young suit. They're --\nthey're sued. There's no other State official who takes\npart in the proceedings. Nonetheless, they enter into a\nconsent decree. Is it your submission that even without\nany other participation by anybody else in the State, that\nconsent decree binds not just them, but I gather you say\nfuture officials in -- in their offices? Right?\nMS. ZINN: Unrepresented by the State Attorney\nGeneral.\nQUESTION: Unrepresented. You would --\nQUESTION: Well, but wouldn't -- wouldn't there\nbe a question of fact in that case? I mean, it would be\nodd, I -- I would suppose not to have the State Attorney\nGeneral there, and -- and wouldn't the -- if I were a\ntrial judge, I'd say, well, is this the State that is\nsubmitting this -- this settlement? I mean, wouldn't --\nwouldn't there be, theoretically at least, a fact question\nin Justice Scalia's circumstances?\nMS. ZINN: Fact and a matter of law, Your Honor.\nThe question under this Court's decision recently in\nLapides would be whether those officials are authorized to\nrepresent the State in court, even absent their attorney.\nThat would be so unusual in Texas I can't imagine it even\nhappening, but --\nQUESTION: No, but that -- but that's a waiver\ntheory. I mean, if you're proceeding on a waiver theory,\nyou -- you need the State there.\nBut let's assume you're not proceeding on the\nwaiver theory. You have the second ground, which is just\nif you have authority to enter the decree, you have\nauthority to enforce the decree. Now, for purpose of that\nargument, does it make any difference to you whether the\nState Attorney General is there or whether these officials\nhave the power to represent the State?\nMS. ZINN:\nposition is that since the decree is a remedy ordered in a\nvalid Ex Parte Young case, it provides prospective relief\nonly from alleged ongoing violations of Federal law. The\n-- the remedy is proper.\nQUESTION: And therefore it's consistent with\nthe Eleventh Amendment without any waiver.\nMS. ZINN: Correct. The Eleventh Amendment is\nnot engaged for that -- for that --\nQUESTION: Can you tell us how it worked? The\nrepresentative of the Attorney General was in court and he\nstands up and he says, we insist on sovereign immunity,\nand the judge say, all right, that's act one. It's\nclosed. And then did the same officials stay and they\nsay, well, now we're here on the Eleventh Amendment? I\nmean, how -- how did this work? And --\nMS. ZINN: In -- in this case --\nQUESTION: And let -- let me just say also\nthere's no excerpt of record or docket entry. The only\nthing I have is the consent decree. Was there any order\nsaying the consent decree dated so and so is hereby\nentered as the judgment of the court? I mean, can I find\nthat anywhere?\nMS. ZINN: Yes, Your Honor. The -- the lodging\nhas the -- as its last page, the order to correct the\nconsent decree which states that the -- the order was --\nthe unopposed motion to -- to correct the consent decree\nhas merit and should be granted. The decree was entered\nas the court's order in February of 1996.\nQUESTION: And --\nQUESTION: There was no separate order. It was\njust this consent decree that's in the lodging. That's --\nMS. ZINN: That's correct.\nQUESTION: -- that's it.\nMS. ZINN: That's correct.\nQUESTION: Okay. Now maybe we can go back and\nyou can tell me who the -- was there an act one and an act\ntwo, act one being the State asserts immunity, act two\nbeing the Eleventh Amendment, or -- or were the same\nparties before the court at all times?\nMS. ZINN: The same parties --\nQUESTION: Wearing different -- wearing\ndifferent hats or proceeding under some different theory.\nMS. ZINN: The same parties were before the\nCourt for the entire case with the exception of two State\nagencies which were dismissed early on.\nQUESTION: Right.\nQUESTION: That's the puzzle in this case. The\nState as State was dismissed at the threshold, and then we\nhave an Ex Parte Young case. And now we're talking about\nEleventh Amendment immunity again. So the State is out of\nthe case. It's proceeding as an Ex Parte Young case. How\ndid it then become converted back into a case against the\nState so that we're talking about whether the State waived\nits immunity?\nMS. ZINN: Yes, Justice Ginsburg. Our position,\nas well recognized apparently, is that this is an Ex Parte\nYoung case. However, the State officials in their\nbriefing have urged that that is not correct and that this\n-- this, at least in part, is not a valid order under Ex\nParte Young.\nQUESTION: The State, if -- if I remember\ncorrectly, came before the judge and urged the approval of\nthis consent decree.\nMS. ZINN: Correct.\nQUESTION: Did it not? And there were -- there\nwere several representatives of the State who so\ntestified.\nMS. ZINN: Correct, and they were unanimous.\nThe -- all of the State officials and their lawyer were\nunanimous in requesting the district court to enter the\nconsent decree.\nQUESTION: That -- that's your waiver. That's\nthe waiver side of your argument.\nMS. ZINN: Correct.\nQUESTION:\ndecide the case on that ground if another ground is\navailable simply because that would require a case-by-case\ninvestigation as to -- to what extent the participation by\n-- by other State officials existed, whether they were\nauthorized to participate and so forth and so on.\nWhereas, your other ground doesn't require that -- that\ncase-by-case investigation, and wouldn't that be a -- a\nmuch clearer line to -- to establish?\nMS. ZINN: In our -- in our view both positions\nare clear in this case. The -- the --\nQUESTION: You have to make sure that the State\nAttorney General was authorized to represent the State in\nthis case or whatever other official you say committed the\nwaiver. That would -- that would be a factual\ninvestigation in every case, wouldn't it?\nMS. ZINN: No. In Lapides, it appeared to -- to\nbe a question of law. The issue --\nQUESTION: No, but Justice Scalia's question\ndidn't go to waiver. It went to representation. And\nLapides says, if you can represent, you can waive. But\nthere would be a question of representation, wouldn't\nthere?\nMS. ZINN: But in Lapides, it appeared to me\nthat that was resolved fairly simply based on the\napplication of Federal law to the State --\nQUESTION: Once -- once it was understood that\nhe could represent.\nMS. ZINN: Yes, which was determined by an\nexamination of the State statutes involved. And the Texas\nlaw on that point is almost word for word the same as the\n-- the Georgia constitutional provisions --\nQUESTION: Oh, sure. Easy. I mean, I'm -- I'm\nnot saying that this would be a difficult case, but you\nwould have to, I suppose, make that inquiry.\nMS. ZINN: But --\nQUESTION: This case might not be difficult, but\nI -- I don't like going rummaging around in State law. I\nfind Federal law hard enough.\n(Laughter.)\nMS. ZINN: I do too, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Ms. Zinn, I thought that you said in\nresponse to my question that this -- this waiver -- that's\nnot your preferred ground. You said you're arguing it\nbecause the State insisted that this was Eleventh\nAmendment and it wasn't waived. But your -- you brought\nan Ex Parte Young suit. You've got a consent decree under\nthat heading, and -- and that argument, if it prevails,\nwould be -- one would not need to reach the question of\nthe Eleventh Amendment in the --.\nMS. ZINN: That's correct.\nlook at this is that given the Texas Attorney General's\nargument that this is not an Ex Parte Young case, not a\nvalid order under Ex Parte Young, to the extent that the\nCourt agrees with that, those points have been waived\nbecause by asking the district court to enter the consent\ndecree, the State officials submitted their rights\nconcerning the decree for judicial determination. And by\ndoing that --\nQUESTION: Let's put -- put it this way. Are\nyou saying that if the State officials negotiate a consent\ndecree that goes beyond the Eleventh Amendment -- or that\ngoes beyond -- pardon me -- that goes beyond Ex Parte\nYoung's --\nMS. ZINN: Yes.\nQUESTION: -- rules, that then there must be a\nwaiver?\nMS. ZINN: No.\nQUESTION: All right. How can they do that\nwithout a waiver?\nMS. ZINN: Well --\nQUESTION: Especially if they've asserted their\nimmunity at the beginning.\nMS. ZINN: Because under this Court's\ntraditional rules concerning equitable decrees, even a\ndisputed injunction need not be specifically tied to the\nprovisions of law for the --\nQUESTION: So you want us to write an opinion\nthat says after the State has specifically asserted its\nEleventh Amendment immunity, its officials may negotiate a\nconsent decree which goes beyond the boundaries of\njurisdiction set forth in -- in Ex Parte Young without\nwaiver.\nMS. ZINN: The question of the scope of remedy\nis a different question from the Eleventh Amendment/Ex\nParte Young question. The Ex Parte Young question is a\njurisdictional question, but the question of the scope of\nproper remedy --\nQUESTION: Well -- well, you introduced the\npoint of remedy. That wasn't part of my question. My --\nmy question was whether or not, having asserted the\nimmunity in a -- in -- under the assumption that the\nimmunity has not been waived, the State officials can\nnegotiate a consent decree that goes beyond the usual\nrules of Ex Parte Young, it goes beyond the authority\ngranted to the courts under Ex Parte Young, without\nrelying on the theory of waiver.\nMS. ZINN: For example, damages? Would that fit\nwithin your hypothetical? Because in that case without\nwaiver, no.\nQUESTION:\nthe decree is entered whether or not it complies with Ex\nParte Young, I would think, because it isn't necessarily\nfought out on the -- in the -- in the trial of the case\nexactly what the remedy will be.\nMS. ZINN: The -- the validity of consent decree\nshould be -- as in an Ex Parte Young case, should be\nmeasured under this -- this Court's decisions, for\nexample, in Milliken and Rufo. Milliken says that the\nremedy must tend to or to remedy the violation proven.\nAnd Rufo says that when you have a consent decree, it may\naim even higher than that. Because in the course of --\nQUESTION: But maybe -- maybe there should be a\nspecial rule for Ex Parte Young cases. In the ordinary\ncase, going beyond the mere violation does not offend any\nother provision of the Constitution, but the argument here\nis, oh, once you go beyond holding the officer to\ncompliance with Federal law, once you go beyond that,\nyou're out of Ex Parte Young and you're moving against the\nState and the Eleventh Amendment is a bar. So maybe\nthere's a special rule with regard to remediation in -- in\nEx Parte Young cases.\nMS. ZINN: Milliken involved a State official,\nand it's one of the key cases about the scope of disputed\ninjunctions. And it says that remedial orders may go\nbeyond the exact scope, the precise scope of the violation\nat issue.\nQUESTION: Is this outside of Ex Parte Young? I\n-- I mean, the way I was thinking about it, which might\nnot be right, is that what you were saying in the second\npart of your argument is that Ex Parte Young permits,\nwithout the consent of a State, an individual to sue a\nState official in his official capacity, asking for an\ninjunction on the ground that the official has violated\nFederal law. That's what Ex Parte Young says.\nMS. ZINN: Correct.\nQUESTION: And now you get that injunction, and\nthat injunction contains provisions that aren't all about\nFederal law. Some of them are about related State law.\nAnd I thought perhaps the way to look at it was, and that\ninjunction does not violate the Eighth -- the Eleventh\nAmendment. You don't need a State to give consent because\nit's all part of an effort to cure the Federal violation\nwith related matters thrown in.\nMS. ZINN: Correct.\nQUESTION: Ex Parte Young authorizes such a\nthing.\nMS. ZINN: Correct.\nQUESTION: Now, is that last statement right?\nMS. ZINN: Yes.\nQUESTION: So then it's not outside Ex Parte\nYoung. You're giving us an interpretation of what Ex\nParte Young means.\nMS. ZINN: Yes.\nQUESTION: And what is your authority for saying\nthat Ex Parte Young validates the going beyond the Federal\nissues involved? You mentioned Milliken. Is that -- is\nthat authority for that?\nMS. ZINN: Milliken. Hutto v. Finney would be\nanother example. A district court need not sit back and\nhope that the State officials will comply with its proper\nremedial order. It can enforce that order.\nQUESTION: Well, I'm not talking so much about\nenforcement as about entering it in the first place\nconsistently with Ex Parte Young.\nMS. ZINN: Well, this Court's decision in\nFirefighters generally sets out standards for entry of a\nconsent decree, and a decree is properly entered, as this\none was found to be, if it furthers -- if it serves to\nresolve a dispute within the court's subject matter\njurisdiction, which is the case here -- this is a Federal\nquestion about the Medicaid Act -- if it is generally\nwithin the scope of the pleadings, which is true in this\ncase, and if the remedy in the decree serves to further\nthe objectives of the -- in this case, the Medicaid Act,\nwhich is true about all of the provisions of the decree in\nthis case.\nQUESTION: So you're really saying that it\ndoesn't go beyond Ex Parte Young. I mean, the -- the\npremises of some of the arguments here that it does go\nbeyond it, in your judgment, is -- is in fact a false\npremise.\nMS. ZINN: That's correct. Our position is that\nthe district court could have entered this -- this decree\nas a disputed injunction if the State officials had not\ndecided to consent.\nQUESTION: When you had --\nQUESTION: Would you help -- excuse me. May I\nask one more question?\nWould you help me on one thing? My\nunderstanding was -- and I -- I may simply be wrong on\nthis. My understanding was that the claim that this went\nbeyond Young was not a claim that it -- it mandated State\nlaw -- or mandated the performance of State law\nobligations, but that it went further than it had to to\nenjoin the Federal violation by getting into details about\nwhat the State officers had to do or had to refrain from\ndo -- from doing. Am I correct that it's -- it's not --\nthe claim is not that it got into State law but that it\nsimply went beyond the scope of a proper remedial order\nunder the Federal law? Is that correct?\nMS. ZINN: Well, I'd hate to put words into Mr.\nCruz's mouth.\nQUESTION: I know. I should be asking --\nMS. ZINN: But I believe that is part of their\nclaim.\nQUESTION: Okay.\nMS. ZINN: May I reserve the rest of my time?\nQUESTION: Very well, Ms. Zinn.\nMr. Gornstein, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF IRVING L. GORNSTEIN,\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,\nAS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS\nMR. GORNSTEIN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nEnforcement of the decree in this case does not\nviolate the Eleventh Amendment for two reasons. First,\nany Eleventh Amendment objection was waived, and second,\nenforcement is permissible under Ex Parte Young.\nNow, the waiver issue arises in this case\nbecause the State officials are arguing that the relief in\nthe consent decree that is directed to them violates the\nEleventh Amendment, and it is that Eleventh Amendment\nobjection that those same officials, together with the\nAttorney General, waived when they asked the district\ncourt to enter the very relief that they are now objecting\nto on Eleventh Amendment grounds.\nAnd the reason that there is waiver is that\nunder this Court's cases, when the Attorney General on the\n-- of the State on behalf of the State invokes a Federal\ncourt's jurisdiction, Eleventh Amendment immunity is\nwaived. Now, when the Attorney General in this case\nentered into a consent decree on behalf of State officials\nin their official capacity and then asked the district\ncourt to enter that decree, he clearly invoked that\ncourt's jurisdiction and waived any Eleventh Amendment\nobjection to the entry of that judgment against those\nState officials.\nQUESTION: Suppose the Attorney General had not\nbeen involved and simply the State officials on their own\nentered into this consent decree.\nMR. GORNSTEIN: First of all, you would have the\nquestion of waiver, and that is answered by the inquiry\nthat Lapides and other waiver cases have -- have\ninstructed, which is do those -- are those officials\nauthorized by State law to conduct litigation on behalf of\nthe State.\nQUESTION: So that would be a factual inquiry in\nevery case whether the particular official --\nMR. GORNSTEIN: Well, I would say -- I would say\nit's a legal question --\nQUESTION: I understand.\nMR. GORNSTEIN: -- that typically in almost\nevery State, Justice Scalia, it would be the Attorney\nGeneral who is authorized to represent the State in\nlitigation.\nQUESTION: Well, Justice Scalia can preserve his\nown hypothetical.\nMR. GORNSTEIN: Right.\nQUESTION: But suppose that there was -- that\nthe officials did not have the authority to waive the\nEleventh Amendment, but they did enter into a consent\ndecree.\nMR. GORNSTEIN: Yes. Then you get to the second\nargument in this case which is an Ex Parte Young argument,\nand the Ex Parte Young issue is that the consent decree in\nthis case is permissible under Ex Parte Young because it\nprovides prospective relief against State officials based\non the Federal Medicaid statute. And those are the three\nrequirements of an Ex Parte Young suit, that it be --\nQUESTION: This -- this carries you so far\nbeyond the theory of Ex Parte Young, and the theory of Ex\nParte Young is you're not impinging upon State sovereign\nimmunity when you are simply requiring State officials to\nadhere to State law. They are acting ultra vires when\nthey're -- when they're violating Federal law, and\ntherefore, you're not impinging upon the State's sovereign\nimmunity.\nBut now with the theory that you're expounding,\nyou're not only holding them to compliance with Federal\nlaw, but you're saying even when you're not acting ultra\nvires, when you have a lot of perfectly legal options of\nhow to comply with Federal law, you will -- you will\nchoose this option. And that -- that is, it seems to me,\nimpinging upon State sovereign immunity in -- in a way\nthat -- that the mere theory of Ex Parte Young does not\njustify.\nMR. GORNSTEIN: In an Ex Parte Young action,\nState officials like all other Federal litigants are free\nto enter into consent decrees that go beyond what is\nstrictly required by Federal law on one or more issues\nbecause there is a tradeoff. They then get less relief or\nno relief on other issues that they may care about. So\nthis is a system that benefits Federal court litigants\ngenerally, and it is also one that benefits the State and\nits State officials.\nQUESTION: I'm not worried about the officials.\nYes, the officials get a good deal. They -- they get of\nthe suit. They get a -- a decree. But what about the\nState who on our -- on our current hypothesis, the State\nis out of the proceeding.\nthere and here are these State officers who are giving\naway a whole lot of -- of options that the State has, and\nthey're -- they're saying, yes, bind the State even though\nthe suit is just against me.\nMR. GORNSTEIN: First of all, we -- we presume\n-- this Court presumes that State officials, when they act\nin their official capacity, are acting in good faith to\nimplement the best interests of the State.\nSecond of all, the State does benefit when its\nofficials can enter into decrees that --\nQUESTION: Mr. Gornstein, is -- is taking the\nAttorney General out of it kind of a hypothetical\nquestion? Do you know of any institutional decree,\nwhether it involves schools, prisons, the Medicaid program\nwhich the State Attorney General isn't there?\nMR. GORNSTEIN: I don't know of any such case,\nand as I was telling Justice Scalia before, all the\nCourt's waiver cases up until now have been ones in which\nthe Attorney General has represented the State and has\nwaived the -- has -- has been authorized by the State to\nrepresent the State's interests in litigation.\nQUESTION: Might be improper for -- for the --\nfor the trial court to go beyond strict compliance with\nFederal law, to -- to approve a consent decree that goes\nbeyond that without the presence of the -- I mean, maybe\nwaiver is a necessary concomitant of -- of the theory of\nEx Parte Young that you're giving us.\nMR. GORNSTEIN: No, I don't think it -- it is a\nnecessary -- waiver is not a necessary concomitant because\nit is a component of an Ex Parte Young case. This Court\nsaid, for example, in the Rufo case that State -- it had\nno doubt that State and local officials, in order to\nresolve litigation, could agree to relief that goes beyond\nwhat's required by Federal law.\nQUESTION: Mr. Gornstein, I want to clarify what\nyou mean in your argument when you say go beyond. There\nare -- and here are two possibilities.\nOne, you throw in an entirely new obligation,\nand you say, you know, by the way, we'll -- we'll also\nagree to a program of pediatric podiatry, which isn't\ncovered by the statute. We'll do that too just to show\nyou how good our faith is.\nA second possibility is we'll show you how we\nwill implement our agreement to abide by what we\nunderstand to be Federal law. We will throw in a how-to-\ndo-it or a how-we-are-going-to-do-it clause.\nI understand your argument, when you refer to\ngoing beyond the letter of Federal law and agreeing to\nthat in a settlement, to refer to a how-to-do-it kind of\nagreement as opposed to a new substantive obligation\nagreement. I assume. Is that correct?\nMR. GORNSTEIN: Yes, but let -- let me explain\nfurther.\nQUESTION: I guess my question is --\nMR. GORNSTEIN: Yes.\nQUESTION: -- why do you acquiesce in this\nphrase, going beyond Ex Parte Young? Have you ever --\nMR. GORNSTEIN: No, I --\nQUESTION: Has anybody seen a consent decree\nthat simply said, we'll obey the law?\nMR. GORNSTEIN: No. I didn't say it went beyond\nEx Parte Young. I said it went beyond what was strictly\nrequired by Federal law. And as this Court said in the\nRufo case, every Federal court remedial order that's\nentered by a Federal court goes beyond what's strictly\nrequired by Federal law.\nQUESTION: That's all --\nMR. GORNSTEIN: And Milliken permits that as\nlong as it's aimed at remedying a violation.\nBut there's one step beyond Milliken here, and\nthat Rufo says that you can even agree to relief that goes\nbeyond what a court would order after a trial as long as\nthe relief furthers the objectives of the underlying law\nbecause there you are operating with the consent of the\nState officials in -- in selecting that relief.\nQUESTION: You should have given a different\nanswer to Justice Souter then because certainly pediatric\npodiatry would further the objectives of the law to\nprovide the medical care to -- to children.\nMR. GORNSTEIN: Well, at some point it has to\nresolve a bona fide dispute within the subject matter\njurisdiction of the court as well, and if there's no\narguable violation of Federal law that the relief relates\nto, then it falls outside of what a court should enter as\na decree under Rufo.\nQUESTION: Well, you really haven't saved us a\nwhole lot of trouble then. I -- I frankly thought that\none of the attractive features of your position was that\nonce you have an order, that's the end of it. You don't\nhave to try the order when -- when you seek enforcement to\nparse out which parts of it go too far and which parts\ndon't go too far. You tell me there are some -- some that\ncan go too far. We have to look to whether this is\npediatric podiatry or -- or not.\nMR. GORNSTEIN: In general, once a decree has\nbeen entered, there's no objection that can be made at the\nenforcement stage other than subject matter jurisdiction.\nBut subject matter jurisdiction would include an inquiry\ninto whether what was at issue in the case was -- if it\nwas an arguable Federal claim or sought to further the\nobjectives underlying an arguable Federal claim. That's\ngoing to be rare that it won't do that, but if it doesn't\ndo that, the State has a right to object to that on\nsubject matter jurisdiction grounds.\nBy the way, the State also has the right always\nto move for modification of provisions under this Court's\ndecision in Rufo that are not arguably related to -- that\nare not related to any arguable violation of Federal law.\nIf it's just a frivolous underpinning to the suit, the --\nthe State could always move for modification and get that\nprovision eliminated under Rufo.\nQUESTION: The Attorney General was involved in\nthe case in Rufo. You said in all of the cases that you\nknow --\nMR. GORNSTEIN: No, no. I -- no. Rufo itself\nwas a suit against local officials, but what Rufo said is\nthat State and local officials can enter into these --\nthese kinds of agreements and that State officials and\nlocal officials could obtain modifications based on\nchanges in circumstances.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Gornstein.\nMr. Cruz, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF R. EDWARD CRUZ\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. CRUZ:\nthe Court:\nThis case presents the basic question whether\nFederal district courts are immune from the strictures of\nsovereign immunity and Ex Parte Young when administering\nFederal consent decrees.\nIn this case, it is clear what Federal law\nrequires. The Medicaid statute is very clear and\neverything that Federal law requires, the State of Texas\nis doing.\nThe dispute that the parties are having here is\nnot simply a theoretical dispute about whether -- what\ndegree of connection there should be between a remedy and\n-- and an ongoing violation of Federal law. There is no\nviolation of Federal law, and that fundamentally is the\nproblem.\nQUESTION: But can I ask you this question? You\nsay there's no violation of Federal law now. Does that\nmean there was no violation of Federal law when the\nlawsuit began?\nMR. CRUZ: It does not necessarily mean that and\nno court has determined that.\nQUESTION: No, but isn't it -- isn't the -- in\norder to determine the court's power to act, don't you\nhave to look at the facts at the time litigation started?\nMR. CRUZ:\nquestion is not retrospectively was there a violation of\nFederal law, but -- but --\nQUESTION: No. I understand that, but still it\nseems to me your -- your jurisdictional inquiry would\nfocus on the situation at the time the litigation\ncommenced.\nMR. CRUZ: There is a strong argument that there\nwas not a violation of Federal law at the time the\nlitigation commenced, but that matter was never\nadjudicated one way or the other.\nQUESTION: That's right because the State, in\neffect, waived its right to adjudicate that.\nMR. CRUZ: What the State did is pursue an\noption to settle the -- the matter and avoid an\nadjudication.\nQUESTION: But doesn't that mean there was at\nleast a potential violation of law that would give the\ncourt jurisdiction to enter a remedy, which might go\nbeyond merely saying, don't violate the law in the future,\nthat because you may have violated the law in the past, I\nhave the power to order you to do some things that may not\nin themselves be illegal?\nMR. CRUZ: We would agree that this case was\ninitially properly brought under Ex Parte Young in that\nthe complaint, under the terms of the Verizon decision,\nalleged a violation of Federal law. However, Ex Parte\nYoung is not simply a formulistic pleading requirement.\nIt also is -- is, under this Court's decision in, among\nother things, Green v. Mansour, a restriction on the\nFederal court's jurisdiction that -- that what there would\nhave to be for your hypothetical, Justice Stevens, to\ncarry through is not simply a determination that there\nmight be a violation of Federal law.\nQUESTION: Well, do you think in order to enter\na consent decree, the judge had to adjudicate that there\nwas a violation of Federal law?\nMR. CRUZ: No, Your Honor. But in order for the\ncourt now to exercise the coercive authority of the\nFederal court and to order the State officials to engage\nin a very detailed course of conduct, the predicate that\njustifies the Young fiction in the first place is an\nongoing violation of Federal law.\nQUESTION: So you're -- you're telling us that\nthe effect of this consent decree, what Texas achieved by\nit, is it comes into court and says, oh, let's -- let's\nnot fight about whether there was a violation or not,\nwe'll accept a consent decree, and the effect of this\nconsent decree is simply we'll fight about this same\nquestion later. Right?\nMR. CRUZ:\nQUESTION: And you haven't given up anything\nelse. You've just said, let's -- let's not fight about\nthis. Why would the other side ever accept such a consent\ndecree? It's crazy.\nMR. CRUZ: Well --\nQUESTION: You're just telling them, you know,\njust dismiss this case, and if you want to get us, bring\nthe same case later. Why would I enter into such a\nconsent decree?\nMR. CRUZ: The consent decree offered the other\nside a great deal. For one thing, the State, as a\nvoluntary agreement, agreed to carry out an extensive\ncourse of conduct. And if you look at the actual\nrecord --\nQUESTION: Only so long as the State chose to do\nit because on your theory, you -- you create this oddity.\nThey had power -- the court had power to enter the decree\nbut not to enforce it.\nWould you take the same position if this had\nbeen a litigated judgment and the exact same decree came\nout at the end of the line? And then the State says,\nwell, this was an Ex Parte Young suit and even though we\nlitigated and lost, we can still say all bets are off\nbecause at the enforcement stage, you have to prove the\ncase all over again.\nNow, are you making a distinction between a\nconsent decree and a litigated judgment, or do you accept\nthat this -- if this case had been litigated and that\ndecree entered, it could be enforced?\nMR. CRUZ: Justice Ginsburg, we're -- we're\nmaking both distinctions. This would be a more difficult\ncase if there had been -- it had been litigated and there\nhad been a determination of a violation of Federal law,\nbut --\nQUESTION: Why? Why would it be more difficult?\nIt seems to me this is more difficult. You agreed to it.\nMR. CRUZ: It would be more difficult because\nyou at least had the predicate for Ex Parte Young in the\nfirst place. You had a violation of Federal law.\nQUESTION: Well, but it seems to me that when\nmatters are in doubt and a consent decree is entered,\nobviously with the consent of both parties -- that's what\nit means -- that it is a question of Federal law. It's a\nFederal judgment.\nMR. CRUZ: It -- it is absolutely a Federal\njudgment, but on the terms of the consent decree, there\nwas no concession of liability. No court at any time has\never found the State of Texas was violating Federal law.\nQUESTION: No. But your argument, as I\nunderstood it a moment ago, is that you can't go beyond\nFederal law because there's no violation of Federal law\nnow. And that would be exactly the same whether the\npredicate was a -- a litigated judgment or a consent\ndecree.\nMR. CRUZ: In essence --\nQUESTION: So we're in -- it seems to me you're\nin the same boat under Justice Ginsburg's hypothetical.\nMR. CRUZ: The second part of Justice Ginsburg's\nhypothetical about whether even if this were fully\nadjudicated, would this content -- consent decree be\nproper, the answer is plainly no because this consent\ndecree does not enjoin ongoing violations of Federal law.\nThere are a number of provisions in this consent decree --\nQUESTION: So in other -- I take that to mean,\nyes, we would be making exactly the same argument --\nMR. CRUZ: Absolutely.\nQUESTION: -- if this had been a litigated\ndecree. We would -- we would say that --\nMR. CRUZ: Absolutely.\nQUESTION: -- that the order saying, A, you did\nsomething wrong, you violated Federal law, and B, in the\nfuture to avoid that, you've got to do the following\nthings, A, B, C -- you would say so long as at the moment\nof enforcement we are not then violating Federal law in\nthe sense found in the judgment, they cannot order A, B,\nC, and D.\nMR. CRUZ: Under Milliken, the question would be\nthe relation --\nQUESTION: No. I want to know under you.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: On your theory, isn't that going to\nbe your answer?\nMR. CRUZ: Our answer is going to be that the --\nthe jurisdiction that this Court has created under Ex\nParte Young and its progeny exists for one purpose, to\nvindicate the Supremacy Clause.\nQUESTION: No, but you're -- you're getting into\n-- into a general answer, and I want a specific answer.\nAs I understand it, you would say that in -- that\nfollowing the litigated case with an A, B, C, D order, you\nwould say that if -- if the State -- if the -- if the\nother side tried to enforce A, B, C, and D, you could come\ninto court and say, we are not now violating Federal law\nin the sense originally alleged. Therefore, A, B, C, D,\nand E cannot be enforced. Isn't that correct, that that\nwould be your position?\nMR. CRUZ: If C and D were necessary to ensure\ncompliance with Federal law, then they would be\npermissible remedies once there was a finding under\nFederal law.\nQUESTION: Well, all right. Let's -- let's\ncompromise on an answer to the question. Your answer\nwould be we can always object to A, B, C, and D. We may\nor may not succeed, but we can always object to it, even\nthough we haven't appealed it.\nMR. CRUZ: If there's an ongoing injunction --\nQUESTION: We didn't -- we didn't appeal saying,\nlook, Supreme Court, they -- you know, they -- they nailed\nus to the wall on liability, but they do not have\njurisdiction to order A, B, C, and D and E because they\ndon't have jurisdiction to enforce it. You didn't take\nthat appeal and yet you feel you can raise that later.\nMR. CRUZ: If the injunction is ongoing, then\nthe State officials could come in at any point and say, C,\nD, and E are not necessary --\nQUESTION: Can I ask you what is the purpose of\ndoing this? I mean, let's think of the Medicare\nprovisions or the Social Security provisions, the\nregulations, the statutes. They cover volumes. Think of\nconsent decrees. Yours is only 80 pages. I guess others\nmight be hundreds of pages. And so what you're saying is\nthat after these have been entered, they've been entered\nbecause there was a violation of Federal law in the view\nof the plaintiff and the defendant agreed. Okay?\nNow, what you're saying is at any time, we go\nthrough these hundreds of pages and we try to figure out\nwhether each word in these hundreds of pages actually in\nitself reflects the Federal law violation, of which,\nremember, there were 3,000 volumes, or the State law\nviolation, of which there were 10,000 more volumes, and\nonce we figured that out, then you're going to say you can\ndo paragraph 867 but you can't do paragraph 868. Now, I\njust wonder what is the purpose of this exercise?\nMR. CRUZ: Justice Breyer, two responses. First\nof all, there was not an agreement that there was a\nviolation of Federal law. It's certainly true the\nplaintiffs --\nQUESTION: No. I -- I don't -- that's not --\nMR. CRUZ: -- consent decree explicitly --\nQUESTION: That's not answering my question at\nall. So would you please direct yourself to my question?\nMR. CRUZ: The second response -- your -- your\nquestion refers to volumes of Federal law and State law\nthat may or may not have been violated. This case is very\nsimple. It's one short section of Federal law.\nQUESTION: I'm not asking about this case. I'm\nasking about the purpose of the exercise that you are\nsuggesting that the Constitution requires us to undertake.\nMy suggestion was that it is -- I was trying to make it\nlook absurd to go through that exercise because it would\nput everybody to a lot of work for no real reason. That\nwas what I was trying to suggest. Now, I suggested it so\nyou would respond to it because I'm sure you don't agree\nwith that, and therefore, I'd like you to present the\nresponse.\nMR. CRUZ: Justice Breyer, the exercise of\nrequiring a -- a violation of Federal law derives from\nthis Court's cases beginning with Ex Parte Young and\nmoving on.\nQUESTION: You're saying the cases require it.\nNow, if that's so, that's the end of it. You're right.\nBut I had the impression a different case had a much\nbetter solution to the problem that you raise, which is\nthat there's some provisions in this thing that really\nhave nothing to do with Federal law at all. And that's\ncalled Rufo. And what the -- what -- what you're supposed\nto do in that situation is you can make your argument.\nYou go to court. You say rule 60(b). You say, judge, you\nsee this provision over here? This has nothing to do with\nanything. And if the judge is right, you win. Now, why\nisn't that a much more practical approach for the problem\nthat you're raising?\nMR. CRUZ: Justice Breyer, under the Fifth\nCircuit precedent, the means to challenge this sort of\ndecree is precisely what we did, to challenge it. Under\nthe Lelsz v. Kavanagh case, the means to challenge it is\nto challenge the enforcement and --\nQUESTION: You mean you can never move for\nmodification prior to an enforcement action?\nMR. CRUZ: Well, you can, and that's the second\npart which is the Fifth Circuit treated what we did as a\nmotion to modify or vacate the decree. That's how the\nFifth Circuit interpreted what we did. The -- the\nplaintiffs came in at a year and a half --\nQUESTION: The Fifth Circuit -- excuse me. The\nFifth Circuit said you had to -- you had to segment this\ndecree into bites, and plaintiff had to prove each one of\nthem as a violation of Federal law. That's worlds\ndifferent from saying, here's a decree, time has shown\nthat it's not -- that it's too onerous, so court, please\nmodify it. 60(b)(5) accepts the decree as valid and\nenforceable, but says that it should be modified in light\nof our experience under it. Now, that's quite different\nfrom saying you can't enforce it. You have to prove the\ncase all over again at the enforcement stage.\nMR. CRUZ: It is true that treating our -- our\nargument as a motion to modify is not purely based upon\nchanged facts and law. It is in part because you have the\n2 years of compliance and the tremendous record the State\nhas, but another fundamental element of it was a challenge\nthat the terms of the consent decree go far beyond what\nFederal law requires. And let me focus just for a\nmoment --\nQUESTION: Why don't you make a virtue of a\nnecessity and say that that is precisely your response to\nJustice Breyer, that you cannot do what you want to do\nunder rule 60(b)?\nMR. CRUZ: That --\nQUESTION: Why not? That's --\nQUESTION: For the reason that Justice Ginsburg\nstated, that all 60(b) enables you to do is to eliminate\nprovisions that -- that have been found too onerous, not\nto eliminate provisions that are not indeed terribly\nonerous but go beyond what -- what the court had\njurisdiction to impose. It's a totally different\nquestion.\nMR. CRUZ: My -- my --\nQUESTION: Right?\nMR. CRUZ: My hope --\nQUESTION: So that's your answer to Justice\nBreyer.\nMR. CRUZ: My -- my hope would be --\nQUESTION: But that -- that leaves you with\nJustice Ginsburg's problem.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. CRUZ: My hope would be to make virtues out\nof either approach and to say that it could either be done\non -- under an effort to modify or a challenge of\nenforcement, that either avenue is available. And the\nFifth Circuit treated it as both. I mean, that's\nprecisely what the Fifth Circuit did. The -- the --\nQUESTION: Modification doesn't depend on\nchanged circumstances, does it, under that theory? You're\nsaying we want to modify it because we shouldn't have\nagreed to it in the first place.\nMR. CRUZ: Well, we don't know what the\ncircumstances were when -- when this matter was entered\nbecause there was no adjudication on the merits. But we\ndo know now --\nQUESTION: Well, but there are allegations of\nfact that would have -- the allegations did allege a -- a\nviolation of Federal law, did they not?\nMR. CRUZ: If those -- they did, and if those\nallegations were true, then there are changed\ncircumstances because the district court was very clear\nthat there is absolutely no evidence that even a single\nclass member has ever requested services and been denied.\nAnd that really is the nub of the dispute because\npetitioner --\nQUESTION:\n-- the statute requires more than waiting for requests to\nbe made.\nMR. CRUZ: But -- but that really is the\ncritical dispute because the statute, the Medicaid\nstatute --\nQUESTION: As I understand the record, you've\nmade marvelous and extensive changes in your practices,\nand that's why you're in such wonderful shape now. But\nmaybe you wouldn't have been if the lawsuit had never been\nfiled.\nMR. CRUZ: That's possible, and so this could be\nfairly characterized as a motion to modify because there\nis not an ongoing violation of Federal law now.\nWhat the Federal law requires is that whenever\nan eligible member requests screening, they receive it.\nPetitioners don't like that reading and what the\npetitioners convinced the Federal district court to do in\nthis case is read the words where they are requested out\nof the statute. And all of this fight about what the\nproper baseline is, is it Federal law or is it the\nconsent --\nQUESTION: Well, but I want to know if you could\ngo -- could you go through 60(b)? That's interesting.\nNow, imagine -- I'll give a silly example to\nmake it clear -- that there's a requirement in the consent\ndecree you have to give every child a hair cut. And\nFederal law doesn't require that, but there's a provision\nin State law that the barbers' union got in. All right?\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: So every child has to have a hair\ncut. So you find the decree and you go say, judge, I want\nthis modified. Look what it is over here. They give\nevery child a hair cut. That has nothing to do with\nFederal law whatsoever. We don't want to give every child\na hair cut. Can you get the decree modified under 60(b)?\nMR. CRUZ: Yes.\nQUESTION: Yes. All right. Well, then if you\ncould get it modified under 60(b), this isn't really a\nsolution. You don't need your solution. You can go in\nunder 60(b).\nMR. CRUZ: And that's what the Fifth Circuit\ntreated what we did. So we --\nQUESTION: All right. So then there's no\nproblem. We're all in agreement.\nMR. CRUZ: We will prevail either way.\nQUESTION: So if we think you have a right to go\nin under 60(b), is that the end of the case?\nMR. CRUZ: If -- if what we did is deemed that,\nbecause --\nQUESTION: Mr. Cruz --\nQUESTION: You have to assume that it's too\nonerous, that everything that goes -- goes a bit beyond\nwhat Federal law demands is, quote, too onerous. Is that\n-- is that your theory of 60(b)?\nMR. CRUZ: It's not a bit beyond and -- and one\nimportant caveat of 60(b) is most of this Court's 60(b)\ncases are in a context where the State or a State official\nis not a defendant.\nQUESTION: Well, 60(b) is basically changed\ncircumstances or changed law, isn't it?\nMR. CRUZ: It is. And --\nQUESTION: But beyond that, Rufo said that when\nyou're dealing with a State or a municipality, that the\n60(b) is more flexible than it would be if you were\ndealing with a private party.\nMR. CRUZ: It -- it did. Rufo was easing the\nstandards for modification, and Rufo did not address the\nEleventh Amendment. That was not an issue that was\nlitigated, and the Court --\nQUESTION: Yes, but we're talking about 60(b).\nAnd I think the -- the -- you're saying, well, this is\nessentially the same thing. It isn't because what you've\nconfronted us with is you said, yes, the court had\njurisdiction to enter this decree, but it had no\njurisdiction to enforce it.\nand that's not a 60(b) position. 60(b) is the court can\nenforce it unless and until you show grounds for\nmodification.\nMR. CRUZ: We don't necessarily concede that the\ncourt should have entered this decree, but the point at\nwhich we litigated it is the point at which the Federal\ncourt began to exercise coercive authority of a Federal\ncourt over the State. And at that point --\nQUESTION: It didn't exercise authority till the\nplaintiffs came in and said, look, they're violating the\ndecree. They're not carrying out all their promises.\nMR. CRUZ: But --\nQUESTION: You could have said, yes, we are.\nMR. CRUZ: But what --\nQUESTION: You didn't say that.\nMR. CRUZ: We did say that. We argued\nextensively that we were carrying out our promises.\nAnd that actually highlights a point. One thing\npetitioners argue a great deal is the unfairness, and that\nwas a motivating factor in this Court's Lapides decision.\nBut I would point out petitioners did not give anything up\nwhen they signed this agreement. It's not as if we could\nsign an agreement with them and agree we're going to\ncomply with 80 percent of Federal law.\nQUESTION:\nyou're -- you're -- and you know, packed up and went home,\nand you're telling them that they -- that they\naccomplished nothing by doing that. They got to re-\ninitiate the whole -- the whole legal process to get you\nto do what they want you to do.\nMR. CRUZ: Justice Scalia, they accomplished a\nnumber of things. One, the State voluntarily engaged in a\nnumber of changes as a result of that agreement. Two --\nQUESTION: Well, you can't say it was\nvoluntarily. They did it because the decree required them\nto do it. That's coercive. I mean, you say it's\nvoluntary, but then why didn't you do it before the\nlawsuit started?\nMR. CRUZ: The State officials endeavored to\nimprove the program --\nQUESTION: To comply with the decree.\nMR. CRUZ: But the decree was drafted as an\neffort to end this -- this litigation.\nQUESTION: Yes, but it imposed obligations on\nthe defendants which they had to perform in -- to avoid\nbeing held in contempt of court.\nMR. CRUZ: Your Honor, that actually opens the\ndoor to yet another reason why we do not believe this\nCourt should hold that Ex Parte Young defendants can\nengage in commitments that extend far beyond Federal law\nbecause that open -- opens a Pandora's box to separation\nof powers problems.\nQUESTION: It's -- it's maybe far beyond. I'm\n-- I'm not sure that it is but it's permissible. Rufo was\nconcerned with requirements that were not permissible\nunder Federal law. And that's -- that's not this case.\nAnd you have the obligation, even under 60(b), to show\nthat compliance is burdensome and there's changed\ncircumstances, and you haven't shown that.\nMR. CRUZ: Justice Kennedy, no body of law,\nFederal or State law, requires virtually everything that's\nin the consent decree. The consent decree requires data\ncollection, and there's no reference to that in Federal\nlaw. The consent decree requires the State officials --\nQUESTION: These are just necessary procedures\nto implement the program and to make it work well.\nMR. CRUZ: I mean, the consent decree --\nQUESTION: And they were agreed to you by your\nclient.\nMR. CRUZ: The consent decree requires that the\nState officials train private health care workers in\ncultural sensitivity. Now, that's not required by Federal\nlaw. That's not necessarily to ensure compliance with\nFederal law. It is something quite simply --\nQUESTION:\nfailure to do this caused serious flaws in the\nimplementation of the program.\nMR. CRUZ: The Federal law requires --\nQUESTION: The court surely has the authority --\nand the parties certainly have the right -- to stipulate\nto provisions that will make the consent decree effective.\nMR. CRUZ: A State official does not have the\nright to bargain away his or her constitutional authority\nor the legislature's. If one might imagine a\nhypothetical. The legislature --\nQUESTION: But that's -- that's the issue.\nQUESTION: Well, excuse me. Certainly the State\nAttorney General has -- and by the way, I would like you\nto say a few words about the other -- the other basis and\nthat is the waiver basis. Certainly the State Attorney\nGeneral does have the power to bargain away the State's\nsovereign immunity if -- if you consider that bargaining\nit away.\nMR. CRUZ: Justice Scalia --\nQUESTION: Why -- assuming everything you said\nis true, that this goes beyond what could have been\nimposed under Ex Parte Young, nonetheless, you had the\nState Attorney General who agreed to all of this. It was\nnot just these individual officers. The State Attorney\nGeneral who had power to waive sovereign immunity signed\nthis consent decree. Why shouldn't that be the end of the\ncase?\nMR. CRUZ: Justice Scalia, the premise of the\nquestion that the Attorney General had power to waive\nsovereign immunity is not correct under Texas law. Now,\nit is admittedly a question of Federal law, but Federal\nlaw looks to State law.\nIn answer to your question about waiver, we have\nseven reasons why we believe the Court should not find\nthat there was a waiver.\nFirst, that this was waived below.\nSecondly, there's no clear and unambiguous\nwaiver, as this Court's decisions require.\nThirdly, there has been no waiver by the\nlegislature of immunity from liability in State court, a\ncritical predicate for Lapides, and in fact, the United\nStates in Lapides argued that all the Attorney General\ncould waive was forum immunity, not immunity from\nliability -- immunity from suit at all.\nQUESTION: May I stop you at that point? Could\na State then simply say -- every State say our Attorney\nGeneral has no authority to waive our sovereign immunity,\nand then you would have the highest legal officer\nappearing in Federal court on behalf of the State and\nrepresentations that that person makes count for nothing?\nIs that --\nMR. CRUZ: Justice Ginsburg, your -- your\nhypothetical is in fact the law in the Texas, in that the\nlegislature has explicitly said the Attorney General may\nnot waive sovereign immunity in Government Code 402.004.\nQUESTION: Then what was the attorney -- then\nthe Attorney General was really deceiving the Federal\ncourt when the Attorney General said, this is a consent\ndecree that we worked out, we urge the court to adopt it.\nNow, if the Attorney General had no authority to enter\nthat consent decree, he should have told that to the\nFederal court, but there was no -- no such representation.\nMR. CRUZ: Justice Ginsburg, the Attorney\nGeneral didn't deceive the court because the Attorney\nGeneral never represented that this was a waiver of\nsovereign immunity. Those words are not found in the\nconsent decree. The consent decree says the defendants'\ndefenses are all preserved. This was an effort, unlike\nall of the voluntary invocation of jurisdiction cases,\nwhere the State makes an affirmative decision, we want to\nbe in Federal court. In this case the State was hailed\ninvoluntarily --\nQUESTION: But nothing required the State to\nagree to this consent decree. I know you distinguished\nthe case -- Lapides was -- you said that they -- the State\nmade the move to get the case into the Federal court. But\nhere, yes, the State is a defendant. Nothing in the world\ncompelled it to enter the consent decree, to urge the\ncourt to accept its consent. So when a State Attorney\nGeneral says to the Federal judge, Federal judge, we think\nthis is a sound decree, we want you to enter it, that's\nhardly being hauled before the court. That's a voluntary\ndecision.\nMR. CRUZ: The State acted in an attempt to\navoid a long, protracted litigation. We were hailed\ninvoluntarily before the Federal court.\nQUESTION: In Gunter, the State was also hailed\ninvoluntarily before the Federal court.\nMR. CRUZ: Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, but Gunter\nwas an adjudication on the merits and found an ongoing\nviolation of Federal law and then enjoined that ongoing\nviolation. Had that happened, we wouldn't have a dispute.\nWe don't --\nQUESTION: Well, you prevented it from happening\nby entering into the consent decree.\nMR. CRUZ: But that could have happened at the\nstage of enforcement. Before a Federal court orders a\nState to do something, this Court has said that Ex Parte\nYoung is a fiction, that -- that the courts will pretend\nthe State official, who is not really a State official, is\nacting ultra vires for the limited purpose of vindicating\nthe Supremacy Clause. That limited purpose is not served\nwhen no court has ever found a violation of Federal law,\nand when there is in fact not a violation of Federal law.\nThe reasons petitioners are litigating today is\nbecause if they had to demonstrate a violation of Federal\nlaw, they could not do so. So what they would, instead,\nlike is for the baseline to be the consent decree.\nQUESTION: Are you suggesting they filed a\nlawsuit they didn't think they could win?\nMR. CRUZ: They filed a lawsuit that was filed\nbefore Judge William Wayne Justice --\nQUESTION: It was filed in good faith alleging\nviolations of Federal law, was it not?\nMR. CRUZ: It was -- it -- we presume it was\nfiled in good faith and it alleged violations of Federal\nlaw. We don't believe they could have demonstrated then\nand we -- we absolutely don't believe they can demonstrate\nnow any violations of Federal law. Both the district\ncourt and --\nQUESTION: Then why enter a consent decree? It\njust doesn't make sense. I assume that whatever counsel\nwas representing the State at that time thought there was\nsufficient grounds to justify entering into a consent\ndecree, unless you want to take the position that the\nattorney was acting totally ultra vires.\nMR. CRUZ: It was an effort to end the\nlitigation. It was an effort that ultimately failed. I\nmean, there -- there are two additional key reasons why\nthere's not waiver.\nQUESTION: No. But you're saying then that the\nconsent decree is basically a continuance.\nMR. CRUZ: It is a voluntary agreement and it\nallows -- it agrees that the district court is available,\nit's familiar with the law and facts and can -- the case\ncan be brought back to it if there's ongoing dispute.\nQUESTION: Right. We'll see -- a consent decree\nmeans we'll see you later.\nMR. CRUZ: Or we'll agree to this and that will\nresolve the matter.\nI will point out if signing a consent decree is\na waiver of Eleventh Amendment immunity or sovereign\nimmunity, then plaintiffs' argument proves too much. It\nmeans every consent decree is utterly immune from Ex Parte\nYoung. It means once a consent decree is there, the\nrequirements of Federal law don't matter.\nQUESTION: Only with the State Attorney General.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: You haven't made another argument\nthat -- that I thought you -- you would make, and that is\nnot applicable to the waiver argument, which requires that\nthe State Attorney General or someone authorized to act\nfor the State is there. What -- what troubles me about --\nabout the non-waiver argument made by the petitioner is\nthat some of these consent decrees are imposed upon --\nupon absolutely willing State officers who want to be\nthrown into the briar patch. A suit is brought against a\n-- a secretary of health and human services in the State\nwho absolutely wants to do these wonderful things for\npediatric care that are not required by Federal law. And\nif the State Attorney General were not in the situation, I\nam very reluctant to think that this official can go in\nand say, yes, require me to do these wonderful things that\nState law does not require, that Federal law does not\nrequire, but that I would like to do, signs the consent\ndecree, and then we're stuck.\nMR. CRUZ: That --\nQUESTION: But that's not this situation. Your\nAttorney General appeared and said, this is okay as far as\nwe're concerned.\nMR. CRUZ: But -- but that is a fundamental\nproblem with these cases. It was a prior Attorney\nGeneral, a prior head of the health department, and those\nprior officers under petitioners' theory had bargained\naway the legislature's authority. It's clear the\nlegislature couldn't pass a statute that said, we're going\nto allow the Federal District Court for the Eastern\nDistrict of Texas to run our Medicaid program. That would\nbe a fundamental violation of federalism and separation of\npowers. Nor could the Attorney General sign a contract to\ndo that. Therefore, they should not be able to sign a\nconsent decree to do that unless it is necessitated by an\nongoing violation of Federal law. It is only the\nSupremacy Clause that justifies that.\nIn addition, this course's voluntary -- this\nCourt's voluntary invocation of Federal jurisdiction cases\nhave, by and large, not been Ex Parte Young cases. In\nLapides, in Gardner, in Clark, they were suits against the\nState. They were not Ex Parte Young cases, and this Court\nwould be breaking new ground by saying an Ex Parte Young\ndefendant who, under the legal fiction, is not the State,\nis simultaneously the State for purpose of being able to\nwaive sovereign immunity by litigating.\nAnd as was pointed out in the earlier colloquy,\nthe State was a defendant, raised the Eleventh Amendment,\nwas dismissed on Eleventh Amendment sovereign immunity.\nAnd to say now that ambiguous and conflicting provisions\nof the consent decree, signed by the State officials as Ex\nParte Young defendants, can waive the sovereign immunity\nis to extend the Ex Parte Young fiction beyond --\nQUESTION: Well, surely they had attorneys,\nState attorneys, representing them, did they not?\nMR. CRUZ: They -- they did, Mr. Chief Justice.\nBut those attorneys, just like the State officials, are\ntemporary officeholders, and temporary officeholders are\nin effect, as this Court recognized in Alden v. Maine and\nalso in Justice Thomas' and Justice O'Connor's opinions in\nMissouri v. Jenkins, there are serious separation of\npowers issues that are raised when one official bargains\naway the authority of another.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Cruz.\nMs. Zinn, you have 4 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF SUSAN F. ZINN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMS. ZINN: Some of the arguments made are not\ntethered in -- tethered or tied to the record in this\ncase. The district court, before enforcing the consent\ndecree, found violations of -- ongoing violations of\nFederal law. That finding is found at pages -- at the\nbottom of page 272 and 273 in the appendix to the cert\npetition. And it -- it refers and relies on the Court's\nearlier extensive findings of fact.\nSecond, there has been no contested motion to\nmodify filed in this case. There was no contested motion\nto modify pending before the district court or pending\nbefore the court of appeals, and this is an important\nmatter for this Court to consider. Of course, a motion to\nmodify would allow State officials to present legitimate\nconcerns, if they have any, concerning the consent decree\nto the district court so that the district -- with them\nhaving the burden of proof, so that they could have their\nbest shot to show the district court what's wrong with the\nconsent decree under this Court's decision in Rufo. That\n-- that burden of proof gives the district court a full\nrecord to base its decision on about whether or not to\nmodify the decree and it also creates an adequate record\nfor appellate review of those questions, which is not\npresent at the moment.\nIndeed --\nQUESTION: Would a change in administrations be\na change of circumstances that -- that justifies 60(b)\nbeing invoked?\nMS. ZINN: No.\nIndeed --\nQUESTION: Is there then a way to deal with the\nproblem that Justice Scalia raised, which is a serious\nproblem I think?\nMS. ZINN: If a change in -- in administrations\nresults in --\nQUESTION:\nthis decree and there all kinds of things in the decree\nthat may be very nice and really helpful to people, but\nactually the legislature would never pass them, and they\nhave nothing to do with Federal law. Now, what he's\nlooking for is a remedy for that situation. I'm not\nsaying your decree has that problem.\nMS. ZINN: Yes.\nQUESTION: But it's a known problem, and what's\nyour solution to it?\nMS. ZINN: As has been pointed out, Rufo does\ncreate a more flexible standard for modification when\nconsent decrees are involved in institutional reform\nlitigation of this type. That flexibility, though, does\nnot sink down to the level of mere inconvenience. So just\nbecause it becomes inconvenient for a successor\nadministration to comply with the consent decree is not\njustification for modification. But if the -- the new\nState officials can bring legitimate concerns to the\ndistrict court's attention, modification may be\nappropriate.\nUnless there are further questions, there's no\nfurther reply.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Ms. Zinn.\n"
