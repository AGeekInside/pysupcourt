GOLDBERG: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nEric Michael Clark was denied his Fourteenth\nAmendment right to a fair trial. Arizona law defined\nthe cognitive elements of first-degree murder as\nrequiring proof beyond a reasonable doubt that Eric\nClark intentionally and knowingly shot and killed a\npolice officer in the line of duty. The State of\nArizona was permitted to offer facts to\ncircumstantially prove these mental and essential\nrequisite elements of mens rea. Under the rule\nespoused by the Arizona Supreme Court in State versus\nMott, as we have been calling it, \"the Mott rule,\" this\nevidence, as offered by the defense both in lay\ntestimony and expert testimony, was arbitrarily\ncategorically excluded as a rule of evidence that's\nunsupported by any valid State purpose.\nIn this case --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It was excluded with\nrespect to mens rea, but, of course, all of the\nevidence came in with respect to the insanity defense.\nMR. GOLDBERG: It came in, yes, Mr. Chief\nJustice, as to the insanity defense, but could only be\nconsidered if Eric knew right from wrong. It cannot be\nconsidered because of the peculiar adoption of an\namendment to 13-502, which is the Arizona insanity\nstatute, that eliminated consideration of the nature\nand quality of his acts.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Is --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- the State telling us --\nand we'll ask the State when they argue -- but is the\nState telling us that it has defined \"intent\" in a\nparticular way for this, so that \"intent\" is just\nhaving the purpose to cause the result --\nMR. GOLDBERG: If they were --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- and, therefore, that\nthis testimony is irrelevant? Is that the State's\nargument, as you understand it?\nMR. GOLDBERG: As I understand the State's\nargument, they are adopting what Justice Ginsburg wrote\nin Montana v. Egelhoff, that the State, by enacting\nthis rule, has made this a substantive choice to make\nevidence of mental illness irrelevant. However,\nArizona did not do that, and Arizona did not argue\nthat below. Below, Arizona argued, repeatedly, that\nEric Clark knew this was a police officer, that Eric\nClark intentionally shot a police officer. On appeal,\nthey argued the same thing. In the appellate decision\nin this case, by the Court of Appeals of the State of\nArizona, the State -- I raised a challenge to the\nsufficiency of the evidence in addressing that issue.\nAnd this is in the joint appendix at -- one -- if I\ncould have one moment -- begins on page 330 of the\njoint appendix -- 336, and proceeds through the court's\ndiscussion of the sufficiency of the evidence, in\nparagraph 17. The court concluded that there was\nsufficient evidence from which a reasonable finder of\nfact could conclude -- and it states, \"reasonable\ninference thereupon that Clark knowingly and\nintentionally shot Moritz, and knew that he was a\npolice officer when he did so.\" There's repeated\nreferences that the Arizona Court of Appeals did not\nunderstand that Arizona had somehow, by adoption of the\nMott rule, decided to redefine the crime of first-\ndegree murder, and -- as it -- we point in our opening\nbrief, they could not constitutionally do so.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, what --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, do you take that --\nplease.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What do you make of the\nvery name that the State gave, not acquitted by reason\n-- not not-guilty by reason of insanity, but guilty,\nexcept insane. Guilty of what? Guilty of the charge.\nAnd the charge is first-degree murder. So, even if\ninsanity is found, apparently that's defined to be\n\"guilty of the charge, except insane,\" therefore not\nsubject to criminal punishment.\nMR. GOLDBERG: That's correct, Justice\nGinsburg. However, guilty of the charge, based on the\nState's evidence, without any consideration of the\ndefendant's evidence. In this case --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But --\nMR. GOLDBERG: -- we offered 16 lay witnesses\nand their testimony, in addition to the experts. And I\nwant to point this -- make this point clear. The State\nwants you to believe that this issue only involves\npsychiatric expert testimony. It does not. And it\ninvolves lay fact evidence, just as in any trial. But\nthese 16 lay witnesses talked about --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But the lay -- I'm\nsorry. That was my question. The lay --\nMR. GOLDBERG: These lay witnesses --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- witnesses still\ntalked about his mental state, correct?\nMR. GOLDBERG: That's correct. But the trial\njudge ruled, under Mott, that he was precluded from\nconsidering all mental health evidence, all evidence of\nmental disease or defect, on the issue of mens rea.\nSo, even though it was admitted, and there's no quarrel\nhere that all of the evidence that we sought to present\nwas admitted, it was not considered by the trial judge.\nHe could not. Because the Mott rule itself is\ncategorical. And I quote from the Mott decision, as\nfollows, \"Arizona does not allow evidence of a\ndefendant's mental disorder, short of insanity, either\nas an affirmative defense or to negate the mens rea\nelements of a crime.\" That states \"all evidence,\" and\nthe trial judge understood it to mean that, and that's\nthe way it is applied in --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No --\nMR. GOLDBERG: -- Arizona.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- what they have here --\nthe -- what the SG says -- which seemed right to me,\nand I would like you to explain why it wasn't -- is\nthat as far as the insanity defense is concerned, that\neveryone in Arizona agrees that you consider whether he\nknows right from wrong in respect to this act. Thus,\nif he thinks the truckdriver is an alien, or he thinks\nhe's an animal, and has a serious mental problem in\nknowing what's going on, that comes right in, as it did\nhere, because it's relevant to whether he knew it was\nright or wrong to shoot this person. And, therefore,\nonce I read that, I thought there is not, at least in\nthis case, a question of whether the insanity defense\nis complete, because it is. Everything that you wanted\nto introduce was introduced. And, indeed, it was\nconsidered, properly, under the insanity defense. And\nif you had convinced the jury, you would -- or the -- I\nguess, the jury -- you would have won on that. Now, am\nI -- what's wrong with what I've just said?\nMR. GOLDBERG: There is a distinction between\nnature and quality of one's acts and knowing whether an\nact is right or wrong. And the State's and the United\nStates position here is not supported by the history of\nthe development of M'Naghten nor the ALI version of the\nModel Penal Code.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes, but I'm interested in\nArizona, remember. I'm not -- what I'm interested in\nis whether if you say, \"Judge, I am going to prove the\nfollowing. My client knows right from wrong, in\ngeneral, but he thought that the truckdriver was a wild\nanimal, and that delusion meant that he is so insane,\nhe could not have formed the necessary intent.\" The\njudge replies, \"You can bring that in, because if he\nthought the driver was a mental -- was a wild animal,\nhe did not know right from wrong in respect to this\nkilling.\" Now, is that what happened --\nMR. GOLDBERG: No --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- in effect? Or would --\ndid the judge say, \"You may not introduce that\nevidence, because it is not relevant\"?\nMR. GOLDBERG: No, Justice -- the trial judge\nruled that we could offer the evidence, because we were\nnot before a jury, and the judge was the trier of fact.\nAnd he stated so, that he would separate out, for\nhimself, what he could consider and what he could not.\nAnd his verdict in this case, on the \"guilty, except\ninsane,\" focused only on whether Eric knew right from\nwrong.\nJUSTICE BREYER: In this case.\nMR. GOLDBERG: In this case --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, fine. So, then, what\nis -- would -- if he thought it was a wild animal, then\nhe would not have known right from wrong in respect to\nkilling that individual.\nMR. GOLDBERG: But that is not the State's\npoint, or -- nor the United States Government's point\nin this case.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What is it?\nMR. GOLDBERG: Their point is that the former\nis subsumed in the latter. In other words, it makes no\ndifference. But the Arizona Court -- the Arizona\nSupreme Court, in a State Court decision, State versus\nChavez, indicated otherwise.\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, but whether it --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I guess maybe the\nquestion is, What is your point? And I have the same\nquestion as Justice Breyer, and I'd just like to pursue\nthat.\nIf a case, a hypothetical case, is one in\nwhich the second prong of M'Naghten, knowing the\ndifference in right and wrong, gets to the question of\nhis capacity to form an intent, isn't that sufficient?\nI think that's Justice Breyer's question.\nMR. GOLDBERG: It would, if Arizona allowed\nconsideration of that evidence. And it does not, at\nall.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But let's --\nMR. GOLDBERG: Now --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but whether it does or\n--\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- let's assume that it can\nconsider the evidence as to -- on the right-and-wrong\nprong.\nMR. GOLDBERG: The right-and-wrong prong --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Does the hypothetical state\n--\nMR. GOLDBERG: In a hypothetical --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- that says, \"We'll let\nthis evidence\" --\nMR. GOLDBERG: In a hypothetical --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- \"in under the right-and-\nwrong aspect of M'Naghten, but not under the nature and\nquality of the act.\"\nMR. GOLDBERG: And your question is whether -\n-\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Why that isn't sufficient\nto answer your contention that his intent is not -- has\nnot been subject to question.\nMR. GOLDBERG: Because, first of all, it is\nnot offered and is not considered to specifically\ndetermine whether it rebuts an inference that the State\nhas raised on factual point key to their case.\nSecondly, the nature and quality is not a consideration\nin Arizona.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: What they said --\nMR. GOLDBERG: And even if it was -- and I\nwould -- can point this out by an example that gets to\nwhat Justice Breyer was saying -- if a person is\nsqueezing a lemon -- and this is a common example in\nlaw school -- and it turns out to be his sister -- he\nknows, in the abstract, that a person -- killing a\nperson is right or wrong. He knows it's wrong. But he\ndoes not know that squeezing a lemon is wrong.\nIn this case, if Eric Clark's evidence showed\nthat he believed the police officer was an alien, and\nthere was substantial evidence in the record to that\neffect -- and I would specifically point you to page 39\nin the joint appendix, where the -- where the expert\ntestified that Eric had a heightened fear of police --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I'll look at\nM'Naghten. I had thought it was whether or not the\naction was right and wrong, whether -- rather than the\n-- than the -- than the moral command was wrong.\nMR. GOLDBERG: That is correct. That is\ncorrect, Justice Kennedy.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Then, what do you do --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Then what you're saying, if\nI understand it, is that when the Arizona statute\nrefers to whether or not the criminal act was wrong,\nthe criminal act that they are referring to, on your\nview, is the act of intentional killing, period. And\nif that's what they mean, then it is irrelevant that he\nthought he was killing a Martian. But if the Arizona\nreference to the criminal act being wrong refers to the\nact in this case -- i.e., killing somebody you believe\nis a Martian -- then the evidence could come in. So, I\nthink your argument means -- your argument rests on\nthe assumption that the Arizona statute's reference to\nthe criminal act being wrong means the criminal act, in\ngeneral, in the abstract -- i.e., intentional killing -\n- as distinct from the act of killing somebody you\nbelieve to be a Martian. Is that correct?\nMR. GOLDBERG: Absolutely. That's not --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.\nMR. GOLDBERG: -- that's not --\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right, if that's --\nMR. GOLDBERG: -- the end of it, as well.\nAnd the Model Penal Code makes this point when they\ntalk about their formulation, which is a -- whether a\ndefendant appreciates the wrongfulness of his conduct.\nAnd they, in their discussions, had indicated -- and\nthese are on pages 166 and 169 of the ALI comments to\nthe Model Penal Code -- that M'Naghten could, under any\nformulation -- a person could, in the abstract, know\nthat killing is wrong, but could also, in the -- in the\n-- their subjective mental state, due to their mental\ndisease, not know that they were killing a human being.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But the Arizona Court, the\nCourt of Appeals, writes that it turns on the finding\nof criminal responsibility at the time of the criminal\noffense. It is difficult to imagine that a defendant\nwho did not appreciate the nature and quality of the\nact he committed would reasonably be able to perceive\nthat the act was wrong. Now, those words, written by\nthe Arizona Court, suggested to me that, in the case of\nthe lemon you're talking about, or in the case of the\nindividual who thinks that the truckdriver was a\nMartian, they would say he does not know right from\nwrong, here, now, in this case. That, it seemed to me,\nis what the Court of Appeals wrote.\nMR. GOLDBERG: That --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And if that's what they\nwrote, then they don't adopt the test you're attacking;\nrather, they do let the very evidence that you want to\ncome in, come in, and it is totally relevant.\nMR. GOLDBERG: They would, if it was not\ninconsistent with previous pronouncements of this very\nsame court. But, although it is -- it is error to not\ninstruct a jury on both prongs when Arizona had both\nprongs, it was harm -- deemed harmless error in State\nversus Chavez. But if --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but --\nMR. GOLDBERG: But not --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- if Justice Breyer --\nMR. GOLDBERG: -- but that it was error,\nbecause they are distinct. They are distinct elements.\nAnd that is to suggest that a psychiatric psychosis is\npervasive throughout an entire person's living.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But if Justice --\nMR. GOLDBERG: But --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- Breyer's explanation is\na correct statement of Arizona law, do you still have\nan argument that your proof should have been accepted,\non the first prong?\nMR. GOLDBERG: Yes.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And what is that argument?\nMR. GOLDBERG: The argument is that the State\nproved, circumstantially, his mental state. The judge,\nas the finder of fact, never -- and stated so in his\nruling on this issue -- could consider the lay\ntestimony and the expert testimony on whether it raised\na doubt, a single reasonable doubt as to the State's\nposition. And I can point this out on four facts.\nFirst of all, the State sought to prove intent and\nknowledge. They did so by first arguing that Eric's\nconduct, in driving around the neighborhood with the\nmusic playing loud, was to lure a police officer. This\nis in the record at -- on August 5th, in the opening\nstatement by the State's attorney, page 15; on August\n27th, at page 50; and that's in the joint appendix, at\n314, in their closing argument.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And your evidence to\nthe contrary that was excluded would have showed what?\nMR. GOLDBERG: That it was equally plausible\nthat he was driving around with his music playing loud\nbecause he was drowning out the voices in his head,\nwhich were --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, it went to\ndiminished mental capacity. And as I understand\nArizona law, it has decided that that evidence can only\nbe presented in the context of an insanity defense.\nMR. GOLDBERG: And that is unconstitutional,\nMr. Chief Justice.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: You mean --\nMR. GOLDBERG: First of all --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- the Constitution --\nMR. GOLDBERG: -- these are facts --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- requires a diminished-\ncapacity defense?\nMR. GOLDBERG: No, not the defense. There's\na very subtle, but important, distinction between the\ndiminished-capacity defense as an affirmative defense\nand diminished-capacity evidence. And it's a shame\nthat --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, if you're going to let\nthe evidence of diminished capacity in, on mens rea,\nyou've done, by -- as it were, by the front door, what\nyou can't do by the back door -- i.e., by a diminished-\ncapacity defense -- because you're making the same\npoint. The burdens of proof are different, but you're\nmaking the same point.\nMR. GOLDBERG: Well, the burdens of proof\ngoes to whether, if we did not -- if we did not prevail\n-- or we did prevail on the second issue, the --\nwhether M'Naghten allows consideration of this --\nwhether it makes a difference. In that situation, the\nburden of proof is on us, by clear and convincing --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Do you -- do you think it is\nunconstitutional for a State to say, \"We know perfectly\nwell that it is much more difficult for both cognitive\nand reason -- reasons -- and reasons of character and\ntraining and so on, for some people to conform\nthemselves to the criminal law than others. We know\nit's harder for some than others. But we don't care\nhow much harder it is, unless it gets to the point that\nwe define as insanity. Because unless we require\nsomething as serious as insanity to excuse, everybody's\ngoing to have an excuse, and there isn't going to be\nany criminal law\" -- is that unconstitutional?\nMR. GOLDBERG: No, it's not.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.\nMR. GOLDBERG: But the --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Isn't that what the State\ndoes when it denies a diminished-capacity -- says, \"We\nwill not have a diminished-capacity defense\"?\nMR. GOLDBERG: If it is framed as a defense,\nyes, but if --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. Now --\nMR. GOLDBERG: -- it is framed --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- isn't --\nMR. GOLDBERG: -- as simply --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, but isn't --\nMR. GOLDBERG: -- lay evidence --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: With respect, isn't that\nalso what the State is getting at when it says, \"We\ndon't allow diminished-capacity evidence in on mens\nrea, which is the State's burden. Rather, we allow it\nin only on the defense of insanity, so that we can keep\nit clear, clear that unless the diminished capacity is\nso great as to amount to insanity, it's not an excuse\"?\nAnd if that is what the State is doing, is there any -\n- anything unconstitutional about that?\nMR. GOLDBERG: The unconstitutionality of\nthat -- of that procedure is that the State's evidence\ngoes uncontested. The State's evidence -- the State's\nevidence -- and this has been fundamental to prove mens\nrea, along with actus, is a fundamental right of the\ndefendant to present a defense to that. And we're\ntalking about presenting facts, not having --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but it only --\nMR. GOLDBERG: -- a psychiatrist get up there\n--\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- goes uncontested --\nMR. GOLDBERG: -- and --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- it only goes\nuncontested if the only way you're going to contest it\nis to show diminished capacity. You could have\ncontested this evidence by showing that, you know, he\nwas a in a rock band, and he wanted to play the music\nfor -- to advertise the concert, not to lure the\npolice. There are a lot of defenses you can present.\nWhat they're saying is, if it goes to diminished\ncapacity, that has to be used to show insanity or not -\n- or nothing at all.\nMR. GOLDBERG: But their justifications for\nthis rule, Mr. Chief Justice, are that it's not\nreliable. And it is reliable evidence. Both the lay\ntestimony and expert testimony is admitted by the State\nfor other purposes, as well as for the defense in other\npurposes, and has been found reliable. And this is\ncited in footnote 15 of our reply brief.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Goldberg, may I ask\nyou to clarify one thing about your argument? You say\nthat you should have permitted -- been permitted to\nintroduce this evidence to show that this act was not -\n- the \"act\" being, kill a police officer -- was not\ndone intentionally or knowingly. But you seem to\nindicate that Clark could have been convicted, under\nthe Arizona code, of some degree of murder. Am I right\nabout that? And, if so, what degree?\nMR. GOLDBERG: Absolutely, Your Honor. Our\nposition -- and I stated this, in fact, in my opening\nstatement to the court, as well as in our motion for a\ndirected verdict after the close of the State's\nevidence -- was that if the court found that the State\nhad failed to prove, considering all the evidence,\nincluding the evidence of his mental illness, that he\ndid not know he was killing a police officer, then he\nwould be found guilty of second-degree murder or\nmanslaughter. And that would be our position as to why\nthis is unconstitutional, in part, because the State\nchose to define a specific crime as requiring that\ncognitive element that he knew he was killing a police\nofficer and then --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And what would --\nMR. GOLDBERG: -- sought --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What --\nMR. GOLDBERG: -- to preclude any\nconsideration of evidence that indicated the contrary.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What was the second -- the\ndefinition of \"second degree\"?\nMR. GOLDBERG: \"Second-degree murder\" is\ndefined as intentional murder, without premeditation.\nThat's one form of second-degree murder in Arizona.\nNow, I want --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, what --\nMR. GOLDBERG: -- to get back to --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: May I just ask, what -- if\nthe proof you'd like to introduce is that the defendant\nconsidered the police officer to be an alien, why would\nhe have any intent? Why wouldn't your argument go, as\nwell, to second degree?\nMR. GOLDBERG: Because if he knew he was\nkilling what he believed to be a alien who had taken\nover a human form, then he may have known that he was\nkilling somebody, but not that it was a police officer,\nbecause, in his mind, he believed that the police\nofficer was an alien.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But it doesn't go to\npremeditation. I think that's Justice Ginsburg's\npoint. And I don't see why that isn't correct. It\ndoesn't got to premeditation.\nMR. GOLDBERG: No, Justice Scalia, but he was\nnot charged with a premeditated murder.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No, but you're saying --\nyou're saying he could have been charged with second-\ndegree murder --\nMR. GOLDBERG: As intentional murder.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- because -- what?\nMR. GOLDBERG: Because the -- because the\ncrime of second-degree murder -- because this is a\nunique --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Does not require\npremeditation. And I --\nMR. GOLDBERG: Right.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- don't see how this goes\nto premeditation, anyway.\nMR. GOLDBERG: Does not go to premeditation.\nGoes to the question of whether he knowingly killed a\npolice officer. If you take -- second-degree murder is\n-- includes all the elements of this particular first-\ndegree-murder statute and adds one, and that one\nelement is knowledge and intent to kill a police\nofficer. And that's the additional element that makes\nsecond degree a lesser included defense of first\ndegree. And the judge was precluded from considering\nthe fact evidence in this case that indicated that Eric\nwas delusional, that he was schizophrenic, that he was\nactively delusional at the time of the crime, and he\nbelieved that its -- our town had been inhabited by\naliens.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right, suppose he did,\nhe believed there -- it's an alien, which is not\nimmoral, to kill an alien, let's say, if he comes from\nMars. I don't know about the morality of that, but --\n[Laughter.]\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- I'll go with you. I'll\nsay that you're absolutely right about that. Now,\nsuppose, in addition, the judge did consider that. He\ndid consider it, because he thought the person wouldn't\nknow right from wrong if he thought this was an alien.\nAll right? A space alien. Now, suppose that's true.\nThen what is the problem, from a due-process point of\nview? After all, you were able to make your claim\nthere. The judge would have heard the evidence. And\nif the judge believed that that was so, he would have\nacquitted the individual. Does there remain a due-\nprocess problem?\nMR. GOLDBERG: Not if it could be considered\nas to going to the element, no. But that's not this\ncase.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Actually, I was --\nMR. GOLDBERG: It does not go to the mental\nstate, in this case, because Arizona law, under State\nv. Mott, precludes its consideration for that purpose -\n-\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, suppose --\nMR. GOLDBERG: -- for any purpose other than\n--\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- I read State v. --\nMR. GOLDBERG: -- whether we made the --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- Mott --\nMR. GOLDBERG: -- other than whether we meet\nour burden of proving he is insane, by clear and\nconvincing evidence.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Is it your argument that it\n-- under Arizona law, it goes to excuse the conduct,\nbut not whether the conduct, in fact, occurred?\nMR. GOLDBERG: It does.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I mean, is that your\nargument?\nMR. GOLDBERG: That's the way the Arizona --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Is that your argument?\nMR. GOLDBERG: Yes. Yes. Well, that's the\nway the Arizona rule is drafted. It can go to -- if we\ncan convince the trier of fact that it -- that his\ndelusions prevent him from knowing the nature and\nquality of his acts, if that was actually included in\nour statute. But, in our case, we were limited to\ntrying to prove his delusional behavior, his delusional\nbeliefs that the officer was an alien, to show that he\ndid not know right from wrong. And that was it. And\nthat places the burden on us, which runs counter to the\nfundamental principles of criminal law that are set\ndown in Winship, that it's the State's burden to prove,\nbeyond a reasonable doubt, every element, including\nthis element, and not without any opportunity of the\ndefense to rebut that element.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, that's a different\nquestion. If, in fact, it came in via the insanity\ndefense, I guess the burden is on the defendant to\nprove it. Is --\nMR. GOLDBERG: Correct.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- that true? Well, if it\ncomes in via mens rea, then the burden is on the State\nto disprove it.\nMR. GOLDBERG: No, the burden's not on the\nState to disprove it, Justice --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Doesn't the State have to\nprove, beyond a reasonable doubt, if it came in via\nmens rea, that the mens rea was there?\nMR. GOLDBERG: Absolutely. The burden never\n--\nJUSTICE BREYER: And so, the State --\nMR. GOLDBERG: -- shifts from the State.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- would have to show that,\nin fact, he was not so insane as to preclude intent.\nMR. GOLDBERG: In a technical sense, yes.\nBut, as a practical matter, no, because the State would\nbe offering all of their evidence, as they did here, to\nshow that, circumstantially, he had the intent. We\nwould be offering the evidence, which is regularly\naccepted and is found reliable for numerous purposes in\nour State, to show that there's a doubt as to whether\nhe had that. And that's a completely different thing\nthan the State attempting -- having the burden on them\nto disprove it, which this Court has so said in\naffirmative-defense cases involving self-defense, for\nexample, that the State does not have to disprove that\na person was justified or had a reasonable belief for\ntheir safety, but that they -- and in the same token,\nyou cannot prevent the jury from considering whether\nthat raises a doubt as to the State's case. And that\nis the fundamental problem, the fundamental due-process\nviolation here.\nIf there are no further questions, I'd like\nto reserve the rest.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.\nGoldberg.\nMr. Howe, we'll hear now from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF RANDALL M. HOWE\nON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT\nMR. HOWE: Mr. Chief Justice, may it please\nthe Court:\nThe answer to both questions before this\nCourt today, Do States have the -- have the discretion\nto define it -- to define the affirmative defense of\ninsanity as the policymakers see fit? And they also\nhave the right to protect that definition by -- as\nJustice Souter's questions indicated -- from an -- from\nan attack on that definition by having evidence of\ndiminished capacity of a different -- a different\ndefinition of \"insanity\" from coming in the back door.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, to prevail, do you\nthink you have to show that, under prong two of\nM'Naghten, the right-and-wrong prong, that the\ndefendant can prove really everything, and, in fact,\ndid have the opportunity to prove everything, that he\nseeks to prove under prong one? If it's -- do you have\nto convince us of that in order to win?\nMR. HOWE: I -- no, Your Honor. There are\ntwo answers to that. The first answer is that the\nM'Naghten definition of \"insanity,\" the heart of it,\nhas always been the right/wrong test. And this Court,\nin Leland, and, I believe, in Powell, as well, have in\n-- have always referred to M'Naghten as the\n\"right/wrong test.\" State courts across the country,\nthey go --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But it's clear,\nCounsel, though, that the first prong of M'Naghten adds\nsomething different, \"You don't understand the nature\nand quality of your acts.\" In other words, it would be\nenough, if you recognized both prongs, if he thought\nthis was a Martian, regardless of whether he knew it\nwas wrong to kill a Martian or not.\nMR. HOWE: Yes, that's correct, Your Honor.\nBut as the lower courts spoke in M'Naghten, we don't\nlook at the -- at the -- at the act in the abstract.\nAs the -- as the Solicitor General's brief points out,\nit says in here, at page 16, that what the traditional\nM'Naghten test looks at was his very conduct. And as\nthe Arizona Court of Appeals noted, it would be -- it\nwould be difficult to imagine a situation where someone\nwould know his conduct was wrong, but not know the\nnature of his act. And I won't pretend that perhaps in\nsome theoretical hypothetical scenario that might --\nyou know, that might occur. But it's very difficult,\nindeed, to imagine that. And the Arizona Legislature\nrationally could, you know -- could have, you know,\ndecided that they will -- that they will reduce the\ndefinition to the heart of M'Naghten, which is\nright/wrong, because the -- you know, the issue of\nnature and quality will rarely, if ever, come up.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But I am correct in\nassuming that it is -- and tell me if I'm wrong -- that\nit is your position, the State's position, that, under\nthe right/wrong prong-two part of M'Naghten, and under\nthe evidence in this case, the court was able to\nconsider, really, all of the evidence that's necessary\nin order to meet this defendant's defense as to -- as\nto intent.\nMR. HOWE: Yes, Your Honor. And so --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I agree with you. I'm\ntrying to think of some theoretical case where it would\nmake a difference. I can't quite come up with a\nhypothetical.\nMR. HOWE: And I've -- you know, I've worked\nwith this case for several months, Your Honor, and I\nhaven't come up with one either.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, wouldn't it make a\ndifference in a case in which an individual\nunderstands, number one, as a general matter, that it\nis wrong to kill people intentionally? He also\nbelieves that there are space aliens. And he believes\nthat it is wrong to kill space aliens. But he kills\none. Under the full M'Naghten test, under prong one,\nhe would have a defense. But under the M'Naghten test\nof prong two alone, since he believed it was wrong to\nkill Martians, he wouldn't have a defense. Isn't that\nright?\nMR. HOWE: No, Your Honor, for two reasons.\nThe first reason is that the heart of the M'Naghten\ntest is knowing right from wrong. And if a State, in\nits -- in its discretion, wants to say that those --\nthat the State will not account for those rare cases\nwhere it might make a difference, a State could do\nthat. The second answer, Your Honor, is, as M'Naghten\nsays, at page 723, what we look at when we're examining\nwhether the defendant knew right from wrong, is his --\nis the very conduct that he committed.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Counsel, I'm puzzled about\none thing. I just -- maybe it's just my stupidity.\nBut assume he thought it was a Martian, and assume he\nthought -- does he have to think it was wrong to kill\nMartians? Or supposing he thinks it is not wrong to\nkill Martians, then what do you do? Does it matter\nwhether he thinks it's right or wrong to kill Martians,\nin other words?\nMR. HOWE: My point, Your Honor, is, if he is\nnot actually killing a space alien, there is grave\ndoubt that he would understand his conduct, and that\nwould make rather meaningless, at some practical level,\nasking the question, \"Did you know that your conduct\nwas wrong?\"\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I'm not sure I understand\nthe answer. I -- that -- is it -- does he -- let me\nput it this way, and maybe you can answer yes or no.\nMR. HOWE: Sure.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Does he have to think it's\nwrong to kill Martians?\nMR. HOWE: No, Your Honor. What he -- what\nhe has to understand is what he is actually doing. And\nif he doesn't actually understand that he is killing a\nhuman being, then it's rather academic, in abstract, to\nask, \"Did you know whether that -- did you know what\nyou thought you were doing was wrong?\" But at -- you\nknow, but, again, I suppose, hypothetically, there may\nbe -- you know, there may be a case where that would\nmake a difference. But the State is clearly free to\nrecognize that that's an incredibly rare circumstance\nand that, \"As a matter of policy, we're not going to\nclutter up the definition of 'insanity' with that.\" It\ncould -- you know, adding that language, a policymaker\ncould very well decide that would be distracting to a\njury or a factfinder.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: The thing that troubles me,\njust to -- and then you can comment on it -- I'm\nassuming it's possible they thought he didn't know\nwhether it was a Martian or not, and that he thought he\nhad a mission in life to kill Martians, that they're\nenemies, they're bad to come, and he wants to kill 'em.\nIf that was the -- what the trial court found, could\nhe be put to death for that killing?\nMR. HOWE: That would raise serious Eighth\nAmendment concerns, Your Honor, and --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Or could he just be found\nguilty of murder, or whatever, on those facts?\nMR. HOWE: If he truly believed that he was\nshooting an alien when he was actually shooting a human\nbeing, he would -- he would certainly have, you know, a\nvery strong case for insanity. But what the factfinder\nfound here was that -- but -- was that his -- was that\nhis evidence that that's what he thought he was doing\nwas --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: No, but there's a --\nMR. HOWE: -- insufficient.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- difference in the burden\nof proof. He has the burden of proof to get the\naffirmative defense or to get the -- in that category.\nMR. HOWE: Surely.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And I'm just wondering if\nhe's -- just raises a doubt as -- so there's not proof\nbeyond a reasonable doubt that he knew the person he\nwas killing was either a human being or an -- a kind of\nindividual that it would be wrong to kill.\nMR. HOWE: Well --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: If there's just a\nreasonable doubt on the issue --\nMR. HOWE: Well --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- would he be guilty, or\nnot?\nMR. HOWE: Well, Your Honor, that raises the\nsecond issue that we're -- that we're discussing today,\nthat, you know, the State, as I've argued, has the\nright to define \"insanity\" as it -- as it sees fit.\nAnd if you -- if you -- if a -- if a State allows\nevidence, that doesn't rise to the standard of\ninsanity, to come in, then you -- then he's able to\nraise whatever his personal definition of \"insanity\" is\nthrough the back door. And the State has a great\ninterest in preserving its definition of \"insanity,\"\nand its ability to define \"insanity\" as it sees fit by,\nas we argued --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But, as you say, it's -- in\na way, it's -- in a sense, it comes in through the back\ndoor, as you say, but, even coming in through the back\ndoor, if it raises a reasonable doubt as to his intent\nto kill a -- make a wrongful killing, why shouldn't it\nbe admissible?\nMR. HOWE: It should -- it isn't -- it isn't\nadmissible, Your -- a State can preclude it, Your\nHonor, because the State has the definite right to\ndefine the element of mens rea, and it is -- again, as\nit sees fit. And as --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Does that mean that it\ncould also exclude the testimony from the lay people or\nthe friends who talked about this person's illness?\nMR. HOWE: It --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Or are we just talking\nabout the expert testimony?\nMR. HOWE: Evidence of mental disease or\ndefect, whether it's expert testimony or lay testimony,\ndoes not come in under Mott.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Howe, would you\nexplain to me how the State has proved intentional --\nnot intentional killing, but of a police officer? If\nthat's the charge, that he intended to kill a police\nofficer, how does the State meet its burden on a police\nofficer if the testimony on the other side is, \"I did\nnot understand that this human that I killed was a\npolice officer\"?\nMR. HOWE: What the -- what the State proved\nin this case, Your Honor, is that, at least, you know,\n2 weeks prior to the murder, he indicated a desire to\ndo -- to do something extremely similar to what he --\nyou know, to what he actually did. There was testimony\nhe had -- he had an extreme dislike toward police\nofficers. On the -- at the time of the killing,\nOfficer Moritz was in -- was in a marked police car, he\nhad a uniform, he turned on his lights and siren, and\nClark -- you know --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I see that on the --\nMR. HOWE: -- pulled over.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- the State side, so the\nState has introduced evidence from which a trier could\nconclude he intended to kill a police officer. But he\nwants to introduce, on the other side, \"I didn't have\nthat intent. In fact, I had delusions. I thought I\nkilled an alien.\" But he's not allowed to introduce\nthat evidence --\nMR. HOWE: Yes --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- to counter --\nMR. HOWE: -- Your Honor.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- the State's proof, as I\nunderstand what the Arizona law is.\nMR. HOWE: Sure. What the Arizona Supreme\nCourt recognized in Mott was -- what the Arizona\nLegislature did when it enacted its criminal code and\nit defined its mens rea, it defined the mens rea in\nsuch a way -- you know, just as you -- you know,\njust as you explained in Egelhoff, Your Honor, that the\n-- that the condition of mental disease or defect does\nnot negate the mens rea. So, what the State has --\nwhat the State has to prove, in general, and had to\nprove in this specific case, is, the State had to prove\nthat Clark either, one, actually had the -- had the\nintent to kill a police officer, at least knowing he\nwas a police officer, or killed under -- or killed\nunder circumstances that would indicate that he,\nknowing -- at least knowingly killed a police officer,\nbut for his mental illness. It's --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Is this an alternative\nargument, so that, if we accept this argument, we need\nnot ask whether the evidence comes in under prong two,\nor is this complementary to the argument that the\nevidence comes in under prong two?\nMR. HOWE: I -- I'm not quite sure how to\nanswer that, Your Honor. What we -- what we've argued,\nthe -- you know, as far as the first issue, is that a\nState is free to define \"insanity\" as it -- as it sees\nfit, under most, if not all, cases -- or most, if all\nreal cases.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why is that, Counsel?\nLet's suppose that the -- one of the cases that come\nup is a language difficulty. The individual -- maybe\nhe's not in uniform -- identifies himself as a police\nofficer. Could the State have a rule that, \"We are not\ngoing to allow evidence of language concerns,\" that the\nindividual didn't speak English, and the officer said,\n\"I'm a police officer,\" so he didn't know, when he shot\nhim? What is it about mental capacity that allows you\nto exclude that type of evidence?\nMR. HOWE: Surely, Your Honor. This Court\nhas always noted that evidence of mental disease or\ndefect is viewed quite skeptically, because lawyers and\npsychiatrists and psychologists very often can't agree\non the meaning or the value or the validity of\npsychiatric evidence. The State also has an -- has an\ninterest in preventing someone, who has -- you know,\nwho -- there's at least a serious question of mental\nillness, from being able to forgo an insanity defense,\nbut raise evidence to negate mens rea, in the hopes\nthat he would walk free instead of being found \"guilty,\nexcept insane,\" and sent to the State hospital.\nThere's also -- you know, a third policy reason, that,\nbecause you -- in your -- because the -- you know,\nbecause the gross question of whether someone is insane\nor sane is a difficult enough question with psychiatric\nevidence, it raises -- it raises the question to a\nwhole other level of complexity to ask the juries,\n\"Well, if we -- if you find that he is sane, but he has\nsome degree of mental illness, just find -- you know,\njust how did that mental illness affect his ability to\nintend.\" And the State, as a matter of policy, you\nknow, may properly say, \"That is -- you know, we're\nfinding on the nature to determine whether someone's\ninsane or not,\" but it's just too complex a question\nto ask the -- a jury or a judge, as in this case, to\nmake fine gradations of ability and responsibility.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Howe, one of the\nthings that puzzled me about your position is, you\nsaid, \"Under Arizona law, while this doesn't come in\nunder mens rea, it does affect sentencing.\" I think\nyou said that the -- his mental state is properly taken\ninto account in the sentencing. And, by that, did you\nmean just the length of the incarceration, or the place\nof the incarceration?\nMR. HOWE: Your Honor, my time is up. May --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You can -- may\nanswer.\nMR. HOWE: Surely. What -- under Arizona\nlaw, if you have a mental illness, that does not rise\nto the level of insanity if the -- if the -- if the\ntrial court or the jury finds that circumstance exists\nby a preponderance of the evidence and it can be found\nas a mitigating circumstance, that he -- that can, in a\ngiven case, reduce the sentence imposed.\nThank you very much.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Howe.\nGeneral Clement, we'll hear now from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT\nFOR THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,\nIN SUPPORT OF RESPONDENT\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may\nit please the Court:\nArizona has decided to adopt a particular\nform of the insanity defense, and it has also decided\nto protect that substantive decision by channeling\nevidence about a defendant's mental capacity into an\naffirmative defense with the burden squarely on the\ndefendant. Neither aspect of that judgment violates\nthe Federal Constitution.\nAnd I think, with respect to the substantive\ndecision, there are two elements to it. First of all,\nArizona wanted to streamline consideration of M'Naghten\nand focus on the heart of M'Naghten, which is the\nright/wrong test. But, equally important, as far back\nas 1965, in the Schantz case, where they first came up\nwith the rule applied in Mott, they also wanted to not\nhave a diminished-capacity defense in the State of\nArizona.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Could the State say that\nit's the defendant's burden to show that it was not a\npolice officer?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: I don't think the State --\ncould the State do that? Is that the question?\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: I don't think the State --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Because the next question\nis, Why didn't they -- isn't that what happened here?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Right. I don't think they\ncould do that. And I don't think that's what happened\nhere. And I think if you look at the evidence in this\ncase -- I mean, it came in, in sort of a strange way,\nin part, I think, because it was a bench trial, but I\nthink what the trial court did is say that, \"All of the\nevidence on insanity, all of the evidence in the second\nphase of the case, is relevant. It's all coming in.\nI'm going to take it into consideration, but I'm going\nto take it into consideration only on the insanity\ndefense, not as part of the mens rea defense.\" And I\nthink that was consistent with Arizona law. What I\nthink would be a harder question -- and let me just\nsay, I think the way that this was postured for the\ntrial court was that the Petitioner argued that all of\nthat evidence comes in for consideration of the mens\nrea.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: It seems to me that you\nintroduced the -- my concern by saying that they -- the\nState can put the burden of proof on the defendant,\nwhich we know is generally true in many States with\nreference to the insanity defense. But when you link\nit with mens rea, then it seems to me you have a\nproblem.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, I don't think so,\nJustice Kennedy, but you're absolutely right to say\nthat there's this tradition with insanity, which is\nquite different than the tradition with respect to\nother elements of a crime. And I think that goes back\nto the common law, and goes back to Blackstone. And if\nyou look at Blackstone, and you look at some of the\ncommon law cases that this Court cited in its Davis\nopinion, they describe murder as having several\nelements. One of them is obviously killing a person,\nand one is malice aforethought. And then, some of the\ncases treat a sound mind as a separate element. But, I\nthink, if you look at the history, it's clear it wasn't\na true element, because the common law put the -- it\nstarted with a presumption of sanity, which you\ncouldn't have with respect to any other element, and\nsaid it was perfectly appropriate to put the burden on\nthe defendant.\nAnd I think what the common law recognizes is\nthe question of criminal responsibility or insanity,\nalthough it has some logical relationship to mens rea,\ncan be separated out and can be dealt with in an\naffirmative defense. And I think if you don't\nrecognize the State's ability to do that, you end up\nallowing a defendant to basically sneak in, through, as\nJustice Souter put it, the front door, all sorts of\nwatered-down insanity defenses in the guise of\narguments trying to negate mens rea.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: It does seem as if the\nargument, that, \"Oh, this all comes in under second --\nunder the second prong,\" means that if there's a --\nthere's another inference. It's a -- it's a secondhand\nargument about lack of mens rea.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, it -- I think,\nJustice Kennedy, though --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Kind of, the second-class --\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- sort of evidence.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: -- I don't think it's\nsecond class. I think what Arizona recognized, in the\nSchantz case and in Mott, in making this rule in the\ncontext of rejecting the diminished-capacity defense,\nis that if you allow a defendant to argue, \"My evidence\nshows that I lack the capacity to form the requisite\nmental state; and, therefore, that comes in on the mens\nrea case,\" you can make that argument in terms of any\ninsanity defense you like. I can argue that, \"I lack\nthe capacity to form the requisite intent, because I\nresponded to an irresistible impulse.\" Well, a State\nthat's decided to have the M'Naghten insanity defense,\nrather than the irresistible-impulse defense, has to be\nable to make the judgment, I submit, that, \"We're going\nto have the M'Naghten defense, and we're going to keep\nit as an affirmative defense, and we're not going to\nallow that defense, that we've rejected, to effectively\ncome in through the front door.\" And, to use Justice\nSouter's --\nJUSTICE BREYER: That would present a serious\nconstitutional question, wouldn't it? Or what -- I\nmean, I -- that's -- but I thought some of these\nquestions might be in this case, but I now doubt -- I'm\nhaving doubts about that. But suppose the State so\nlimits the defense that an individual defendant, who,\nby any ordinary psychiatric test, would be viewed as\nseriously insane, and, therefore, not a person who is\ncapable of being held responsible in any moral sense\nfor the crime, is, nonetheless, going to be convicted\nof murder? I mean -- and that might be -- come up with\nirresistible impulse, because the person is totally\ninsane, not like any other human being. Anyone would\nnormally say he lacked the knowledge of -- he's not\nresponsible for what he does. And then, the State,\nnonetheless, convicts him of murder.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: But, Justice Breyer, they\nwouldn't convict him for murder, because he would\nqualify for an insanity defense. And somebody as\ninsane as you're --\nJUSTICE BREYER: If he knew right from wrong,\nif they -- so, I mean, he -- it's not his intellectual\ncapacity that's wrong, it's his ability to control his\nimpulse.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, I mean --\nJUSTICE BREYER: But that's not in this case,\nI agree with you.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: But --\nJUSTICE BREYER: But is a variation of that\nin this case -- namely, the variation -- but we've\ndiscussed that at length, and I take it you think\nthat's not in this case.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: I don't think it's in this\ncase, but I don't want to mislead you, which is as -- I\nthink you can hypothesize a situation where somebody\nwould be exonerated by one form of the insanity\ndefense, and not exonerated by a narrow form of the\ninsanity defense. And I don't think it follows that\nsomebody that's in that margin has a constitutional\nright to make up the difference, effectively, through a\nmens rea argument. And, otherwise, I think you -- I\nmean, you --\nJUSTICE BREYER: But we don't have to reach\nthat question here, in your view.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, I think you --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Or do we?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: I would think that you\nmight. I mean, I think you could say -- because I\nthink what happened here is, all of this evidence came\nin on the back door through the insanity defense.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But if we have to reach it,\nthis -- they're arguing we do, because they're saying\nthe person is so insane he doesn't know whether this is\na human being or a sack of lemons. Now --\nGENERAL CLEMENT: But then he --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- he said that they didn't\nconsider that in the insanity defense. And he's not\nattacking the burden of proof, at least not in this\nCourt. And so, I -- do you think we do have to -- that\nwe have to --\nGENERAL CLEMENT: I --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- assume that he's right on\nthat?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: I don't think you have to\nreach that question here. But you do have to reach a\nrelated question, I think, which is, I think the trial\ncourt here very clearly, in applying Mott, prevented\nthe Petitioner from making a diminished-capacity\nargument. And then --\nJUSTICE BREYER: What is \"diminished\ncapacity,\" if it is -- what is that?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: It's an argument that is\nbasically a variation on the insanity defense. It's\npartial responsibility. It was basically the governing\nlaw in California until it was --\nJUSTICE BREYER: But partial responsibility\ndoes not -- insanity -- they use the words \"insanity\"\nand \"diminished responsibility.\" I took the word\n\"insanity\" to mean the kind of mental state that would,\nin fact, show a lack of intent. I took the word\n\"diminished responsibility\" to mean there is intent,\nbut it's excusable.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: I think you can draw that --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Now, am I --\nGENERAL CLEMENT: -- distinction, but I do\nwant to make clear that there are arguments here that\nyou could make in a different State that you can't make\nin Arizona because of the substantive decision that,\n\"We don't want to have a diminished-capacity defense,\nand we don't want to have that policy judgment\nfrustrated by having the evidence come in through the\nfront door.\" And to use Justice --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask --\nGENERAL CLEMENT: -- Souter's example --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- this question?\nSupposing the evidence is equally divided on the\nquestion of whether he thought it was a Martian who he\nhad a right to kill. Could he be convicted of murder,\nconstitutionally?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: I think he could, Justice\nStevens. As I understand --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Because then --\nGENERAL CLEMENT: -- the hypothetical, we're\n--\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- there would be --\nGENERAL CLEMENT: -- basically --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- not proof beyond a\nreasonable doubt that he knew he was killing a human\nbeing, and it was wrong to do so.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, I think it would --\nit might depend on exactly what the statutory\ndefinition of \"murder\" in the State was.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, I don't -- I don't --\nI'm just wondering, as a constitutional matter,\nforgetting all the -- as a constitutional matter, can a\nman be convicted of murder if the evidence is equally\nbalanced on the question of whether he knew it -- he\ndid anything wrong and -- or knew that he was killing a\nhuman being?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Maybe not, Justice Stevens.\nIt just depends on the way that the statute deals with\nit. Because, in my view of the statute, if somebody\nreally thought -- if they had to kill a human being,\nand they thought, \"I wasn't doing it. I was killing an\nalien,\" maybe that could come in, on mens rea, but if --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Have we ever held that an\ninsanity defense is required, that a State cannot\nsimply abolish insanity defenses?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: No, Justice Scalia, you\nhave not held --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I didn't we had.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: -- that. And I think --\nbut, equally, I don't think a State would -- is\nrequired to have a diminished-capacity defense. And --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, is a State required to\nadopt any particular mens rea for murder? Is there a\nconstitutional requirement as to the minimum mens rea\nthat can be -- can be set for the offense of murder?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: I don't think so. I mean,\nI think it's very difficult to find, in the Due Process\nClause, the tools necessary to superintend those kind --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But here, there --\nGENERAL CLEMENT: -- of decisions.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- was a charge, \"intended\nto kill a police officer.\" It could have been just\n\"intended to kill.\" And I think Mr. Goldberg conceded\nthat \"intended to kill\" would have been a proper\nconviction, but not \"intended to kill a police officer\"\n--\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- unless he's allowed to\ncounter that add-on.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: With respect, Justice\nGinsburg, I think that starts to confuse the\nhypotheticals with the real case, because I don't think\nPetitioner's argument was that they had no idea that\nthis person was a police officer, and he thought he was\nkilling an alien. I think their argument was much more\none for insanity, and that maybe there were other\nexplanations for the conduct. But the psychological\ntestimony here suggests that maybe he sometimes thought\nthat his mother was also an alien, but he kind of knew\nit was his mother, as well. And so, I don't really\nthink that maps up with the argument they've made.\nThe one point I want to leave you with,\nthough, is, as Justice Souter said, everybody agrees\nthat there's no due-process requirement that Arizona\nhave a diminished-capacity defense. Well, it doesn't\nmake any sense to say that they have to have that\nimplicitly with the burden on the State at the same\ntime.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, General.\nMr. Goldberg, you have 4 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID I. GOLDBERG\nON BEHALF OF PETITIONER\nMR. GOLDBERG: There is a due-process\nguarantee that the defendant can present evidence in\nhis own defense. No matter how the Chambers line of\ncases is viewed by the court, this Court made clear,\nin Montana v. Egelhoff, that in the absence of any\nvalid State justification -- and I'm quoting now, from\nthe plurality decision -- \"exclusion of exculpatory\nevidence deprives the defendant -- it's very basic to\nhave the prosecutor's case encounter and survive the\ncrucible of meaningful adversarial testing.\" And that\n--\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But that certainly\ndoesn't include the right to present any evidence you\nwant.\nMR. GOLDBERG: It's the difference between --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You couldn't have\npresented evidence that this person was, in fact, a\nMartian.\nMR. GOLDBERG: That's correct, Mr. Chief\nJustice. And it's not that we're asking to -- this\nCourt to affirmatively rule that all of this evidence\ncomes in, just that all of it cannot be excluded, per\nse, and that the trial judge is, just as in any other\ntype of evidence, any other fact or opinion evidence,\nserves as the gatekeeper under the rules of evidence to\ndecide whether it's more prejudicial or it's more\nprobative. But Arizona has decided, only for this\npurpose, that this evidence is inherently unreliable.\nAnd then they've taken it to the point where they have\nproven somebody guilty of murder in the first degree of\nkilling a police officer without allowing him to raise\na reasonable doubt as to whether he knew he was killing\na police officer. And that specific argument was made,\ncontrary to what the Solicitor just stated, in my\nmotion for directed verdict that I made in this case.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Was it a reasonable question\nwhether he knew it was a police officer or whether he\nknew it was a human being?\nMR. GOLDBERG: Whether it was a police\nofficer. I moved the court for a directed verdict at\nthe close of the State's evidence, and argued to the\ncourt that if he found -- the judge, as the factfinder\n-- that, in his delusional mind -- and again re-urged\nthis at the close of our evidence -- that he believed\nhe was killing a police officer, then the court could\nfind him guilty of second-degree murder or\nmanslaughter. And I asked the court to do that, and\nthe court refused to do that.\nSo, the --\nJUSTICE BREYER: In the --\nMR. GOLDBERG: -- court precluded any\nconsideration of this evidence.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes, I -- the best I can\nfind in that Court of Appeals opinion, at the moment,\nis that they do reject the idea of diminished\nresponsibility, on Mott -- on the ground of Mott.\nThat's true. They say, \"Don't even consider it.\" But\nI didn't think diminished responsibility went to the\nquestion of whether he had the requisite intent. I\nthought insanity went to that, as they use those words.\nWhat is \"diminished responsibility,\" if it isn't, \"We\nadmit the intent -- we admit that he intended to kill\nthe individual, knew it was wrong, but he isn't as\nresponsible as an ordinary person would be\"? What is -\n-\nMR. GOLDBERG: It's not --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- it, if it isn't that?\nMR. GOLDBERG: It's a fact that -- a fact\nthat he did not know he was killing a police officer.\nJUSTICE BREYER: He thought he was killing\nanother individual.\nMR. GOLDBERG: Correct.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Does that --\nMR. GOLDBERG: Or an alien.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Does the State have to --\ndoes the Constitution have to let you off if that's the\nsituation?\nMR. GOLDBERG: It's not \"let you off,\" with\nall due respect. It's \"judge somebody based on\" --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes, you --\nMR. GOLDBERG: -- \"their personal\" --\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right, but --\nMR. GOLDBERG: -- \"culpability.\"\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- but does the State have\nto say, \"We are going to convict you of a lesser\noffense,\" in the Constitution?\nMR. GOLDBERG: The State -- the State has to\nallow the defendant to present his evidence and have it\nconsidered, if it's relevant, nonprivileged, and\nreliable, for a proper purpose. And here, it was\noffered for a proper purpose, just as in Chambers and\nin Rock, and in all the cases that have been before\nthis Court, where this Court has held so.\nI wanted to add -- answer one question that\nwas raised earlier about whether a State could define\n\"murder\" without a requisite mens rea, essentially,\nwhich is -- or a specific intent, as the State seems to\nsuggest that Arizona has done, inferentially, under the\nMott decision. This Court held, in 1895, in Davis\nversus United States, that, \"No one\" -- and I'm quoting\nhere -- \"No one, we assume, would wish either the\ncourts or juries, when trying a case of murder, to\ndisregard the main principle existing at common law and\nrecognized in all cases tending to support the charge\nbelow to make a complete crime cognizable by human\nlaws, which includes mens rea and an actus rea.\"\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel.\n"
