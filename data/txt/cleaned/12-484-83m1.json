JOSEFFER\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. JOSEFFER: Good morning, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThis Court's decision in Gross does most of\nthe work in this case and the plain language of the 1991\namendments to Title VII do the rest.\nUnder Gross, Nassar must prove that\nretaliation was the but-for cause of the challenged\nemployment action unless Congress has specifically\nrelieved him of that burden by authorizing a mixed\nmotive claim.\nIn -- in the 1991 amendments, however,\nCongress authorized mixed motive treatment only for\nTitle VII claims that challenge -- that challenge\ndiscrimination based on membership in a protected class,\nnot for retaliation claims. And for that reason, a\nTitle VII retaliation claim must prove but-for\ncausation.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: In the -- in the AIDS\ndiscrimination context, there wouldn't be a difference\nbetween the discrimination claim itself and the\nretaliation. They'd both be governed by the same\nstandard, isn't that right, in the age discrimination\narea, the but-for causation? Or am I wrong about that?\nMR. JOSEFFER: Yeah. Well, the Age Act does\nnot permit any mixed motive claims.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes.\nMR. JOSEFFER: So for this purpose in the\nAge Act, everything is but-for, that's correct.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But your argument is that\nin Title VII, where it's very clear what the standard\nCongress wants to have for the discrimination claim,\nyou're going to have a different standard for\nretaliation. So, in these statutes, I thought these two\ntraveled together, whatever the standard is for\ndiscrimination is the same for retaliation.\nMR. JOSEFFER: Well, that -- I mean, to some\nextent within Title VII, that is the question in the\ncase, but what we have here is an amendment within Title\nVII, it is first in Title VII where it's set forth\ndiscrimination based on class and discrimination based\non retaliation as separate types of discrimination, and\nthis provision treats them differently. It specifically\nlimits -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Well, I guess the question,\nMr. Joseffer, is, is there any other discrimination\nstatute in which one can say that there's a different\nstandard for proving retaliation than there is for\nproving substantive discrimination? Because as I sort\nof survey the universe, it seems as though whatever the\nstandard is, the standard is the same for both, and\nthere's no statute in which the two have been divorced.\nAm I wrong about that?\nMR. JOSEFFER: Well, I mean -- the reason I\nask the question -- I would agree in the sense that if\nwhat we're talking about is but-for versus mixed motive,\nright? It's -- it's but-for everywhere except for\nwithin the meaning of this one amendment. Congress\nclearly intended to make an exception here to the normal\nbut-for, so the question is to the scope of it.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: I'll try again. Is there\nany other statute in which we have a different standard\nof causation for a retaliation claim than we do for a\nsubstantive discrimination claim?\nMR. JOSEFFER: No, because it's but-for\neverywhere except for this one amendment.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Well, is there -- I mean,\nit's but-for everywhere. Is there even any time at\nwhich whatever the standard that applied, you know,\npre-Gross, is there ever a moment and is there ever a\nstatute in the history of antidiscrimination laws where\nthere has been a divorce, a different standard for\nretaliation than for substantive discrimination?\nMR. JOSEFFER: Not -- I can't point to\nanything specific because what we had, right, was -\nthere was -- I can't point to anything specific on that.\nUp until the statute, the whole point of Gross, right,\nis that the statute carves out a narrow exception from\nbut-for and -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: All I'm saying, you know,\nGross was a couple of years ago. It said but-for covers\nthe -- the ABA and outside Title VII. You know, we've\nhad a lot of discrimination statutes since 1964. We've\nhad a lot of different standards applying to those\ndiscrimination statutes since 1964.\nAnd you're coming in here and asking for the\nfirst time in all of those many decades that we should\ndivorce the retaliation claim from the substantive\ndiscrimination claim and make them follow two different\nstandards; is that correct?\nMR. JOSEFFER: Well, I mean, yes and no, in\nthe sense that if we're talking about but-for versus\nmixed, right, yes, that's a creature of this specific\nstatute we're talking about. If we're talking about\nother aspects of retaliation and other types of\ndiscrimination, there are differences in the statutes.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Did this court ever hold\nthat a Price Waterhouse framework applied to retaliation\nclaims?\nMR. JOSEFFER: No. And the -- I mean, the\nbackdrop here, which is the whole point of Gross, right,\nis that as of Price Waterhouse, we had, you know, a\nsomewhat confusing and murky alignment of opinions,\nthat -- and I think everyone agrees with this -\ninterpreted only at Section 2a, the discrimination based\non class provision.\nThen, two years later, Congress came in with\nthis amendment to specifically identify what it wanted\nto do about mixed motive. And Gross says that except\nfor when Congress has specifically called for this mixed\nmotive treatment, it's but-for is the holding of Gross.\nAnd when we look to this provision -- I mean, there are\ndifferent ways of looking at it, but one would be to say\nthat I'm not aware of any statute that has a specific\nretaliation provision where this Court has construed\ndiscrimination based on class generally to encompass\nretaliation, because that would make the retaliation\nprovision here in 3a absolutely surplusage. It would\nmake the other statutory cross-references to 3a\nsurplusage, because you'd be taking the specific\nretaliation provision within Title VII and subsuming it\nwithin a general treatment of discrimination based on -\non class, race, and so forth.\nAnd this basic structure of these provisions\nof Title VII is that when Congress wants to refer to all\nTitle VII discrimination claims, it will refer as it did\nin subsection 2n to a claim of employment\ndiscrimination, generally; it will refer as it did also\nin section 2 to an unlawful employment practice, which\nwould cover the waterfront, but when it wants to cover a\nspecific subset, it refers to retaliation as spelled out\nin 3(a), or to discrimination based on membership in one\nof the five protected classes.\nAnd here -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sorry, I somehow\nlost what you were saying. Isn't the law, and our\npresumption in Jackson, that when we talk about\ndiscrimination on the basis of race that it includes\nretaliation generally?\nMR. JOSEFFER: Well, the reason -- well,\nwhat Jackson says of course and Title VII is vastly\ndifferent. And the -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, different because\nit was the beginning of this sort of endeavor of\ncreating a statute.\nMR. JOSEFFER: Well, the distinction that\nJackson draws and also that Gomez-Perez draws expressly\nin distinguishing this type of situation is if -- if you\nhave a broad general prohibition on discrimination or\ndiscrimination based on race, without more -- without\nmore specificity, the Court will presume that that would\ninclude retaliation.\nBut when you have a statute, like this one,\nthat specifically singles that -- specifically describes\nin detail the different types of prohibited\ndiscrimination, including specifically retaliation, this\nCourt has never overridden that specific statutory text\nto put one of those specifically broken-out types of\ndiscrimination into another more general one, such as\ndiscrimination based on race, which is why -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm -- I'm not sure what\ndifference it makes.\nMR. JOSEFFER: Well, because otherwise, you\nare taking the -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Other than in the\noutcome you want here.\nMR. JOSEFFER: As a matter -- well, as a\nmatter of statutory interpretation, right, which then\ndrives the outcome, the difference is that if -- if you\ntreat a specific retaliation reference or provision as\nbeing subsumed within a more general one, a\ndiscrimination based on race, for example, you are\ntreating the specific retaliation reference to be\nsurplusage, to have no effect and to not need to be\nthere, and you're treating the other statutory\ncross-references to it as also being surplusages, which\nis why, when Congress does speaks more directly this\nCourt's never overridden, never said that it will take a\nspecific retaliation provision and treat it like it's\nnot there and toss it and -- based on race, for example.\nAnd that's why -- I mean, that's why those\ngeneral cases they cite, those are our cases, because\nJackson specifically says that Title VII is vastly\ndifferent for this very reason.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Well, Mr. Joseffer, I mean,\nTitle VII is written before any of these cases come\nalong. So Title VII is written and it says we have an\nanti- -- you know, a substantive antidiscrimination\nprovision, and we have a retaliation provision. And\nthen the Court starts issuing cases. And it says, by\nthe way, you actually don't need both. One will do the\njob for you, because one includes the other.\nAnd that's in Sullivan. And that's in\nJackson. And that's in Gomez-Perez, and I'm sure I am\nmissing a few. Three, four, five times, the Court says\nthis.\nSo then in 1991 Congress comes back and it\nsays, we want to make some amendments, what do we have\nto do? Do we have to amend both, the anti -- the\nsubstantive provision and the retaliation provision?\nWell, no, we have been told five times that as long as\nwe say one it means both. And so that's what Congress\ndoes in 1991.\nMR. JOSEFFER: There are a couple -- if you\njust look at 1991, there are a few reasons that we know\nfrom the '91 that doesn't work. One is at almost at the\nsame time in 1991 Congress enacted the Americans With\nDisabilities Act, where it again separately broke out\ndiscrimination based on disability and retaliation,\ntreated them separately. So Congress hadn't forgotten\nthat it was treating them differently.\nAlso, in this very provision, the Civil\nRights Act of 1991, Congress specifically\ncross-referenced both the part of Title VII that\ncontains the general provision and the part of VII,\nSection 3, that contains retaliation. So it's\nspecifically dealing with these separate provisions,\nacknowledging that it has in fact presumptively at least\nhas read them and understands the distinction. I mean,\nI think we presume it anyhow, but we know it from the\nactual statutory text of the '91 -- 1991 Act. And\nthen -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, it seems that the\noverall purpose of the '91 Act was to overrule decisions\nof this Court that Congress thought had not interpreted\nTitle VII properly.\nAnd am I right that what they put about\nmotivating factor, a motivating factor, that is more\nplaintiff-friendly than the -- than the standard that\nthe Court declared in -- in Price Waterhouse?\nMR. JOSEFFER: For -- for those cases\nthat -- that the motivating factor provision governs,\nit's more plaintiff-friendly, yes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So it's -- it's really\nodd to think that in wanting to go beyond what we did in\nPrice Waterhouse, the Court meant to set up an entirely\ndifferent standard for -- for retaliation.\nMR. JOSEFFER: That was basically the same\nargument that this Court rejected in Gross, in -- in\nthat Gross involved an absolutely identical statutory\nprovision, that was lifted in fact, deliberately lifted\nverbatim, from Title VII to be put into the Age Act.\nAnd what this Court held, basically, it was that, look:\nWhatever Congress's overall purpose or general purpose\nbehind the 1991 act as a whole, right, what we have to\ndo is look at what it actually did, what lines it\nactually drew in any given situation. And here -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Let's look at what they\nactually did. If we look at this (m) section, it says,\n\"except as otherwise provided in this subchapter.\" I\ntake it that would include retaliation as well, in the\nsubchapter.\nMR. JOSEFFER: Yes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- \"an unlawful\nemployment practice is established.\" And then when we\ngo over to the retaliation provision, it says, \"it shall\nbe an unlawful employment practice.\"\nSo why doesn't that suggest that the -- \"an\nemployment practice\" under the retaliation provision is\nthe same as \"an employment practice\" under this -\nMR. JOSEFFER: Well, the -- under Title VII,\nthere are basically three different ways to establish an\nunlawful employment practice.\nOne is the general provision for\ndiscrimination because of membership in a class. One is\nbecause of retaliation. And this is another one. So\nthis defines basically a third way of establishing\nwhether an employment practice is unlawful. And what it\nsays is that any employment practice that is motivated\nby one of the five listed factors is an unlawful\nemployment practice. So this is why it all keeps coming\nback to do those five factors, those five motivations,\ndo they or do they not include retaliation? We agree\nwith the Government that that's what it all comes down\nto.\nAnd as to that question, I mean, there was\ndiscussion earlier today about the weight of authority.\nI mean, nine courts of appeals have squarely addressed\nthis. They've all agreed with us because Title VII's\ntext and structure are so clear, that Title VII -- and\nthat was the basis for the distinction of Title VII in\nGomez-Perez. Excuse me. Gomez-Perez distinguished the\nidentical provisions of the Age Act, made the same\npoint. Jackson again was vastly different for this\nreason -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I can't understand you very\nwell. Could you -- maybe you have to lift up your mike,\nor maybe you have to speak more slowly. But I'm having\nan awful time following you.\nMR. JOSEFFER: I apologize, Your Honor.\nI was just saying the basic point is that,\nas Jackson and Gomez-Perez indicated, the specific\ncontrols the general. And when Congress breaks out\nretaliation, that's a different subset of discrimination\nthat's not been subsumed within discrimination based on\nclass.\nOtherwise, you are reading out the\nretaliation provisions and making them surplusage, which\nis why all of the many courts of appeals that looked at\nthis unanimously agreed with us.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The EEOC didn't.\nMR. JOSEFFER: Right. Well, this Court has\nalready disagreed with the EEOC. The EEOC has two\nfootnotes and informal guidance that say that under the\n1991 amendments retaliation claims can be proven under a\nmixed motive theory for any of the statutes that the\nEEOC administers, which is clearly contrary to Gross.\nAnd that informal guidance does not\ncontain -- what it contains basically is, you know,\npolicy analysis of why they would like that to be the\nresult, but no textual analysis whatsoever. There's -\nso the guidance in one doesn't get deference because\nit's contrary to the plain text of the statute, as\nnumerous courts of appeals have recognized.\nAnd two, in terms of its power to persuade,\nI mean, this Court has already rejected it and even as\napplied to Title VII retaliation, you know, courts of\nappeals have unanimously rejected it as well because\nthere is just policy there, there's no textual analysis.\nJUSTICE ALITO: As of 1991 -- well,\nGomez-Perez and Jackson came after 1991, right?\nMR. JOSEFFER: Yes, the other's before.\nJUSTICE ALITO: So as of 1991, was there any\ncase, any decision of this Court other than Sullivan,\nthat could have possibly led Congress to a conclusion\nthat the general prohibition against discrimination\nincluded a prohibition of retaliation?\nMR. JOSEFFER: I think you are right about\nthe timing. And Sullivan was so general that -- I don't\nknow that the law was a whole lot different in 1991 than\nit had been in '64 on this.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Well, but, Mr. Joseffer, in\nCBOCS, we said that because of Sullivan alone, just\nbecause of Sullivan, there was no need for Congress to\nexclude explicit language about retaliation. In other\nwords, we -- we said Sullivan made the point clear.\nNow, Justice Alito was right. After that,\nit goes on. We have done it many more times after 1991.\nBut we have said that Sullivan itself made the point\nclear that you did not need explicit language about\nretaliation.\nMR. JOSEFFER: Right. But the -- and the\nmain point is the one I was making earlier, that in 1991\nitself, Congress was continuing to distinguish between\nretaliation and discrimination based on class, and in\nprovisions of this Act and also in the almost\nsimultaneously enacted Americans With Disabilities Act.\nBut there has been another provision in the\nDisabilities Act that treats retaliation and\ndiscrimination based on -- on disability is\nsignificantly different in terms of the remedies that\nare available for the two. So even at the same time,\nCongress has elsewhere also been distinguishing between\nthe two.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: I mean, here's what you're\nask -- this goes back to Justice Ginsburg's question -\nbut here's what you're asking us to accept,\nMr. Joseffer. Congress comes along in 1991 in a world\nin which there has -- there have never been separate\nstandards for retaliation and substantive\ndiscrimination.\nCongress is trying to codify and make even\nstronger the Price Waterhouse decision, right? They -\nyou know, they say, basically, we like Price Waterhouse,\nbut it's kind of confused and the court was kind of\nfractured. We're going to really put it into place\nlegislatively.\nThey do that, they follow the -- essentially\nthe drafting manuals that we have given them in\nSullivan. And you're saying, well, no. What they\nreally meant was that retaliation would have a different\nstandard and, indeed, retaliation would have a standard\nthat the dissenting justices suggested in Price\nWaterhouse, notwithstanding what Congress was clearly\nintending to do was codify the majority -- the\nplurality-plus position.\nMR. JOSEFFER: Well, what -- Gross rejected\na fair amount of that reasoning, right? I mean, the\npoint is that Price Waterhouse -- you could say that in\nPrice Waterhouse, there is no reason to think that there\nshould be mixed-motive claims, right?\nNow, Congress shortly thereafter came in\nwith the '91 amendments to say, okay. We'll have mixed\nmotive claims in this one category. Gross says that's a\nrelatively narrow category. We're going to assume\nCongress does not want them anywhere else, even though,\nyou know, discrimination under the Age Act or under\nTitle VII, you could ask why should it be different.\nWell, because Congress decided it would be.\nHere -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Well, Gross is talking about\noutside of Title VII. And -- and whatever might be said\nof Gross outside of Title VII, here, where Congress is\nspecifically trying to make Title VII conform with Price\nWaterhouse, with the backdrop of our legislative\ndrafting instructions, and with the backdrop of never\ndistinguishing between retaliation and\nantidiscrimination, you know, how do you get to where\nyou want to be? This would be, like -- talk about\nelephants in mouse holes or talk about -- you know, we\ncan take up all our cliches, the dog that didn't bark.\nYou know, Congress doesn't do things like this without\nsaying something.\nMR. JOSEFFER: Well, first off, it did.\nBecause in this statute, as in others, it distinguishes\nbetween discrimination based on membership in a class\nand retaliation, but it wants to cover all of it, it\nuses a more general phrase. When it wants to cover one\nof them, it says one. Here it said one.\nBut beyond that, again, in terms of the\nbackdrop though -- I mean, the -- the whole point of\nGross is that you -- you stick to the plain language of\n'91, and that's -- that's where mixed motive treatment\nis permitted, and also where there's a -- there's a\nnegative inference elsewhere that is so strong that as\nyou said, it applies even in other statutes. Well, if\nthat negative inference applies in other statutes, it\nwould sure apply within the same statute that -- that\nthis provision exists in and is amending.\nAlso, there are significant differences\nbetween discrimination based on class and retaliation\nthat Congress could -- didn't have to -- but could\ncertainly reasonably choose to follow. One is that\nretaliation is -- well, excuse me.\nThe primary evil Congress was after here,\nright, was discrimination based on race, sex, religion,\nand so forth. Retaliation is an important derivative\nprophylactic provision to help enforce the primary\nright, but Congress could reasonably conclude that the\nsignificant cons with mixed motive treatment did not\njustify extending it to the secondary right. Also -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Where do you see that\nanywhere in the legislative history?\nMR. JOSEFFER: The only thing you'll find in\nthe legislative history, the only thing you'll find\nthat's specific to this, is that Congress was aware of\nretaliation, including aware of Title VII's retaliation\nprovision, and it amended legislation to incorporate\nthat provision when it wanted to.\nYou're not going to find anything else in\nthere.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, but it -- it calls\nit the same thing it calls the substantive\ndiscrimination charge, an un -- it's a -- an unfair\nemployment practice. I mean, I don't understand how\nyou -- where you get to your policy point -\nMR. JOSEFFER: Well, the -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- from the fact that it\ncalls it the same thing on both substantive.\nMR. JOSEFFER: No, my -- my point is this.\nThis Court explained, for example, in Burlington\nNorthern, the two -- the two are both prohibited types\nof discrimination, generally, under but-for standard,\nbut they are different, which is why we have different\nlabels and different names for the two categories.\nAnd -- and Congress could reasonably choose to give\ngreater protection to the primary right and not the\nsecondary one considering the negative.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Calls it both identical\nthings, an unlawful employment practice.\nMR. JOSEFFER: Yes. And textually, but it\nthen describes seven different unlawful employment\npractices. Discrimination based on the five classes and\ndiscrimination based on the two types of protected\nconduct. This provision then applies to the five\npractices and leaves out the two types of protected\nconduct, which is why, textually speaking, and there's\nno contrary legislative history, Congress meant to apply\nthis to some, but not all types of unlawful conduct -\nof unlawful -- of employment practices.\nAnd the reason that that's perfectly\nrational is three things. First, as I mentioned, this\nis the secondary of them. Second, it sweeps -- by its\nnature, retaliation sweeps so much broader, well outside\nof the traditional workplace. While Congress was\nthinking about jettisoning traditional burdens of proof\nand relieving a plaintiff of the -- of the traditional\nburden of proving its own case, they could certainly\nbalk at doing that in a much broader setting.\nAnd third, the potential for meritless and\nabusive suits is particularly pronounced in a\nretaliation context, because any employee at all can opt\ninto a retaliation claim by making a -- a charge of -- a\nrelevant charge, knowing that -- you know, potentially\nknowing that, yeah, the writing's on the wall, probably\nI'm going to get fired. And if you then flip the burden\nso the plaintiff doesn't have prove its own claim, the\nplaintiff can point to the timing of his own complaint,\nthe inevitable employment action would have happened\nanyway, and the proximity, then, is probably going to\nget the plaintiff past summary judgment.\nNow, what you're then looking at is an\nexpensive and unpredictable trial, most defendants will\nbe forced to settle even meritless claims.\nAnd the EEOC's own statistics show that,\none, retaliation claims have become all the rage. They\nare the -- the leading type of claims being raised these\ndays. And, two, the EEOC's reasonable cause\ndetermination show that only 5 percent of them have even\nreasonable cause to support them, which is not an\nespecially high standard.\nSo when we're talking about a potential\nmassive amount and growing amount of mostly meritless\nbut expensive litigation to defend, it's perfectly\nreasonable for Congress to decide, well, within the\nscope of what Price Waterhouse was exactly dealing\nwith -- to get back -- to get back to Justice Kagan's\npoint -- we'll have -- we'll allow some mixed motive\ntreatment there, but that'll be it now, because -\nbecause there are other issues with retaliation that\ncaused -- caused Congress to reasonably do exactly what\nit so clearly did in statutory text.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But that policy argument\njust says Jackson's wrong.\nMR. JOSEFFER: No, not at all.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It just doesn't make\nany -- much sense to me that in 1991, when they were\nthinking about Price Waterhouse burdens, that somehow\nthey thought that it should now apply that burden\ndifferently to retaliation.\nMR. JOSEFFER: It -- it was -- the same\nargument was rejected in Gross, right? Because in\nGross, you had another absolutely identical provision\nto -- to the -- to the two Title VII provisions at issue\nhere. And this Court held that, no, what Congress was\ndoing in 1991 was specifically authorizing mixed motive\ntreatment when it wanted and otherwise casting what this\nCourt called the strongest possible inference that there\nwould be no other mixed motive treatment.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Is -- is this a violation\nof Title VII? I don't know the answer. Smith works for\nJones. Jones' whole job is to supervise Smith and be\ncertain that Smith, a well-known racist, has kept his\nracism under control. He didn't. Smith -- they fired\nsomeone -- Smith did -- did some terrible thing and got\nrid of somebody for racist reasons. He tells his boss.\nHis boss knows it. His boss does nothing about it. All\nright?\nIs the boss violating Section VII? He -- he\nhad no reason for doing nothing about it. He himself\nwasn't a racist. It was just his job. But he didn't.\nIs he -- is he violated Section VII?\nMR. JOSEFFER: If I understand the hypo\nright, there's no question that the immediate supervisor\nand the employer -\nJUSTICE BREYER: The immediate supervisor\ndoes.\nMR. JOSEFFER: But-for, but-for causation.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. Now -\nMR. JOSEFFER: So it's just a supervisory\nhypo question?\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes, yes, yes. Okay. So\nthere what we have is somebody is guilty under\nSection VII. Even though that individual did not\nhimself discriminate on the basis of race, it was\ncircumstances where the subordinate discriminated on the\nbasis of race. All right? And yet the -- there's no\ndoubt that m applies to that. M applies to that, I\nimagine, unless you're going to start distinguishing\nwithin Title VII, are you going to say m doesn't apply\nto that.\nMy question's going to be, if m applies to\nthat, then why doesn't it also apply here? Because you\nsee here, what you have is -- it's at one removed. It\nis the individual who is retaliating been retaliated\nagainst. That individual did not discriminate on the\nbasis of race, nor did the individual in Farr read into\nit, but the whole thing is based on race.\nAnd if sometimes under Section VII\nsimpliciter, people are guilty although the race\nmotive -- the race involvement is one level down. Why\nwouldn't you -- that perhaps is too complicated a\nquestion, and if you only have five minutes left, so I\nwill take your answer as being, \"Judge, you better think\nthis out on your own.\"\n(Laughter.)\nMR. JOSEFFER: No, no, no. No, no.\nHopefully, I'm keeping up with you. If not, just tell\nme.\nIt seems to me that there were basically two\ndifferent parts to that. One is, in terms of your main\nhypo, your first hypo, I don't know that 2(m) even comes\ninto play because it sounds to me like the intermediate\nsupervisor is clearly liable under 2(a) under a but-for\ntheory. And then you just get into a vicarious\nliability question. I don't think 2(a) gets into that.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I would say you are better\noff keeping your time.\nMR. JOSEFFER: I was going to say under 2(m)\nthough, I think the overriding point here is that if I\nhave two thoughts in my head, a bad one, but then I go\nahead and treat the person the same way I would have\nanyhow, then I have done what under Title VII, generally\nunderstood, I am supposed to do, which is I treat\neveryone equally regardless of the bad thought in my\nhead.\nAnd at that point -- and that's why mixed\nmotive claims really threaten to take the statute from\none that ensures equal treatment to one that goes into,\nyou know, thought control.\nBeyond that, I will take the advice and save\nmy time for rebuttal.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Lauten.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF BRIAN P. LAUTEN\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. LAUTEN: Mr. Chief Justice, may it\nplease the Court:\nIt does not make any sense at all for\nCongress to have created two causation standards under\nthe same statute in 1991 without saying anything about\nit at all. There are three good reasons why Congress\nhad not to amend e-3(a) in 1991.\nThe first is in 1964, that is when e-3(a)\nwas originally drafted. It was part of the original\nbill. 5 years later, in 1969 in Sullivan v. Little\nHunting Park, this Court held that 42 U.S.C. 1982\nincluded retaliation. So in 1981, Congress knew that\nretaliation was encompassed within discrimination.\nPoint number 2 -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why did they -- why did\nthey include it in a separate section? If they knew\nthat, why did they have a separate section on\nretaliation?\nMR. LAUTEN: Well, when Congress added e-2\nin, Justice Scalia, it supplemented the Act. It created\na new provision altogether.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I understand that. Why did\nthey do it if they knew it was already included?\nMR. LAUTEN: Well, they didn't have to amend\ne-3(a) because there were policy -- the Burlington\nNorthern case, for example, where this Court held that\nretaliation is considerably broader, that provision,\nwhere the Court held that retaliation in Burlington\nactually went beyond conditions in the workplace. That\nwas the second reason.\nAnd the third reason is, imagine if they had\namended e-3(a) or if they had deleted or repealed it.\nWe would be here saying, well, why did they do that if\nthey had already knew in Sullivan since 1964, why would\nthey amend the Act?\nE-2(m) on its text applies to e-3(a).\nCongress could have very well put an e-2(m) under this\nsection. It could have very well put an e-2(m), an\nindividual's race, color, religion, sex, national\norigin. But what it did is it said a complaining party\nmust demonstrate, and then it lists those things. And\nthen it says \"for any employment practice.\"\nE-3(a) specifically defines retaliation as\nan unlawful employment practice. So the text of e-2(m),\nwhich, again, was a new provision altogether -- Congress\ndid not go in and amend e-2(a) through e-2(d) as it\neasily could have done, but it created a new provision.\nThe motivating factor -\nJUSTICE ALITO: I take you back to your\nopening statement that there is no reason why Congress\nmight have wanted to have a different standard for\nsubstantive discrimination and retaliation.\nWould you disagree with the proposition that\nthe motivating factor analysis creates special problems\nin the retaliation -- in the retaliation context?\nMR. LAUTEN: Not at all, Your Honor, and\nthis is the reason, and this Court needs to keep this in\nmind. Motivating factor causation is not going away no\nmatter what this Court holds today. It's in e-2(m), it\nis going to apply to substantive discrimination. With\nrespect to how it's submitted -\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, I know it's not going\nto go away. Let me give you this example, this\nhypothetical. An employee thinks that he is about to be\nfired. And let's -- let's suppose that the employer\nreally has a good, nondiscriminatory reason for firing\nthe employee. On the eve of that the employee makes a\nspurious charge of discrimination and does it in a way\nto maximize the embarrassment to the employer.\nThen the employer formally makes the\ndecision to terminate the employee. And what the\nemployer says at that time is, we were going to fire so\nand so anyway for all these other reasons, but now\nbecause he has done this and really embarrassed us\npublicly, we are really happy that we are going to fire\nhim. Now, how does that work out under the motivating\nfactor analysis?\nMR. LAUTEN: Very easily, because in that\nsituation the employer wouldn't even have to prove the\naffirmative defense because the employee wouldn't be\nable to prove a violation of the Act because it was a\nspurious claim. That's point number 1. Point number -\nJUSTICE ALITO: Is that correct? Can't\nyou -- can't you succeed on a retaliation claim if your\nunderlying substantive claim is invalid.\nMR. LAUTEN: You cannot prevail on a\nretaliation claim under e-2(m) without proving first a\nviolation of the Act, and that is the distinction\nCongress made in e-2(m) for Price Waterhouse, whereas\nPrice Waterhouse held there was no violation as long as\nthe affirmative defense was proven. What Congress did\nin 1991 was say once you prove a motivating factor and a\nviolation of the Act, only then do you get to the\naffirmative defense.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No, I really don't\nunderstand -- I didn't understand the law to be that.\nYou mean if an employee files a discrimination claim,\nand then is fired -- let's assume there is no other\nreason except retaliation; he's fired for filing that\nclaim -- he has to prove not only that he was fired in\nretaliation for filing, but also that his claim was\nvalid? Is that what you are saying the law is?\nMR. LAUTEN: No, no, no, I'm not saying\nthat. I'm not saying that.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I thought that's what you\nwere saying. I thought that's what Justice Alito's\nquestion asked.\nMR. LAUTEN: No. What I'm saying is that\nthat -- and you can look at the jury instructions in\nthis case -- you would have to prove that the employer\nacted in part to retaliate, and -- for the protected\nactivity.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: In his hypothetical, he\ndid. Justifiable retaliation, as far as I am concerned.\nI mean, the employer files a frivolous claim to\nembarrass the employer. He can't erase that from his\nmind. That's one of the reasons he fired this guy. And\nyou say: Ooh, if that's one of the reasons, no matter\nhow frivolous or anything else, he's liable under the\nlaw.\nMR. LAUTEN: Well, here's -- here's our\nposition, Justice Scalia. Our position, number one, is\nthe Court doesn't even get to that issue because the\nstatute applies. If e-2(m) applies, then motivating\nfactor causation applies. If it doesn't apply, if the\nCourt rejects our statutory argument, then by default we\nare under the Price Waterhouse framework and motivating\nfactor causation should apply.\nBut to the policy question, Justice Alito -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't understand that.\nDo you understand that?\nMR. LAUTEN: Substantive discrimination, the\nteeth of the Act, relies on employees being able to\ncooperate and be witnesses, that they have the guts to\ncome forward. If you take that protection away, you are\ntaking the teeth out of Title VII.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, no, I understand that.\nAnd it's not a policy question. It's a question of\ninterpreting the statute. But I understood your lead\nargument in favor of a particular interpretation of the\nstatute to be it can't mean what the Petitioner wants it\nto mean, what the Petitioner says it means, because that\nwould make no sense.\nAnd the point of my question was to explore\nthe possibility that there might be a very good reason\nwhy Congress would want a different causation standard\nfor substantive discrimination and retaliation.\nMR. LAUTEN: There is nothing in the\nlegislative history in 1991 that supports that. In\nfact, I would argue the contrary. When Congress passed\nSection 101 in 1991, which is 42 U.S.C. 1981, in that\nprovision where it overruled Patterson v. McLean and the\nCourt held that retaliation was encompassed within the\nsubstantive discrimination provision, which is what the\nCourt held in CBOCS v. Humphries, in the House bill that\naccompanied the Act it said that Congress intended for\nretaliation to apply to Section 101, but it's not in the\nsection at all that became 101 that was in CBOCS.\nIn Gomez-Perez v. Potter, as you well know,\nthis Court held the absence of retaliation provision\nunder the Federal sector provision did not undermine the\nargument that retaliation was included, even though\nCongress had a separate anti-retaliation provision in\nthe private sector. And there was a very good argument\nin the court of appeals, as you well know, that, hey, if\nCongress wanted an anti-retaliation provision, why\nwouldn't they have done so, they did it on the private\npart.\nAnd there were arguments the other way, that\nthere was already a civil service remedy in place. And\nthis Court rejected that argument, relied on Sullivan,\nJackson v. Birmingham, and those trilogy of cases -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Over a powerful\ndissent.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I would just like to get to\nwhat I think is one of their arguments and I'm having\nsome -- the argument is purely linguistic, all right?\nAnd they say, read m. M says race is a motivating\nfactor in an unfair employment situation.\nNow, we look to what the unfair employment\nsituation is at the beginning unfair employment\npractice. It is to dismiss a person because of race,\nall right? So obviously, it applies. Now we look to\nthe definition that we're at issue in here. It\nsays it's an unfair labor practice to dismiss a person\nbecause of retaliation. Now, retaliation for what? For\nrace, that's true. But we're -- we couldn't care less\nabout whether that race is part or a little bit or it's\nall -- it could even be totally unjustified. What we're\ninterested in is the retaliation. So they say, you see,\nthe words of (m) do not speak about race. They speak\nabout retaliation. They speak about race. So, whatever\nthe policy reasons are, you can't do it any more than if\nyou have a statute that refers to carrots and you try to\nput in a beet. You just can't do it.\nNow, that's the answer -- I -- I would like\nto hear an answer.\nMR. LAUTEN: Yes, sir, Your Honor. I think\nthe point is that -- that complaining about race is race\ndiscrimination. The Court held that in Sullivan.\nComplaining about gender discrimination is -- it's\ngender discrimination, Jackson v. Birmingham.\nComplaining about -\nJUSTICE BREYER: So you have to say\nretribution for race is race.\nMR. LAUTEN: Retribution?\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes.\nMR. LAUTEN: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Now -- now, what I was\nlooking for, perhaps without success, is some other\nexample that has nothing to do with retribution, but\nwhere that's clearly so. That's why the example came\ninto my mind that it is possible that you could, under\nthe basic unfair employment section, find a person\nliable of race discrimination even though that person\nhimself was not motivated by race, but perhaps had an\nobligation to report a race discrimination, which he\nfailed to do because he wanted to go to the racetrack.\nYou see?\nI'm looking for some other -- is there any\nother example in the history of these statutes where\nwe've said, you, Mr. Jones or Ms. Smith, you are guilty\nof race discrimination, even though that's because of\nyour responsibilities, because of what you did or didn't\ndo, it's not because you yourself held the motive, but\nyou -- you'd attribute the motive to them for reasons to\ndo with the statute.\nIs there -- does that ring any bell at all?\nMR. LAUTEN: If -- if I understand your\nquestion, what I would default to are the three or four\ncases that I mentioned: Sullivan,\nJackson v. Birmingham, CBOCS v. Humphries,\nGomez-Perez v. Potter, where this Court has consistently\nheld that complaining about discrimination is\nintentional discrimination. And I want to bring up -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Now, I have looked -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But -- but not under this\nstatute. What I'm concerned about is the text of this\nstatute, which simply destroys your argument that\nthere's no difference between retaliation and race\ndiscrimination.\nSection 2000e-5(g)(2)(A) limits remedies\nwhere a defendant acted -- and this is a quote from the\nstatute -- \"for any reason other than discrimination\non -- on account of race, color, religion, sex, or\nnational origin, or in violation of Section 2000e-3(a)\nof this title.\"\nIt -- it separates out 2000e-3(a),\nretaliation, from the other aspects of race, color,\nreligion, sex, or national origin discrimination.\nMR. LAUTEN: Justice Scalia, that's\nincorrect, and this is why. This is -- this is exactly\nmy point. 5(g)(2)(A), the text of that, that was\ndrafted by the 1964 Congress. That was a part of the\noriginal bill. 5 years after that text came through,\nthis Court held in Sullivan v. Little Hunting Park that\nretaliation encompasses discrimination.\nSo why in 1991 would Congress go amend\n5(g)(2)(A) from 1964, when it already knew.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Sir, the statute says what\nit says. It doesn't matter when Congress put it in\nthere. The statute has to be read as a whole. And if\nyou read it as a whole, this provision clearly separates\nout retaliation from race discrimination.\nMR. LAUTEN: That -- that -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Period. I mean, it\ndoesn't -- I don't have to psychoanalyze Congress and\nsay did they really mean it, blah, blah, blah. It's\nthere in the statute. They didn't take it out. The\nstatute still makes a clear distinction between the two.\nMR. LAUTEN: Justice Scalia, respectfully,\nthat argument is directly contrary to\nCBOCS v. Humphries, and it's directly contrary to\nGomez-Perez, where this Court held that Congress is\ncharged with knowing what this Court is deciding prior\nto acting.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But it would have\nbeen so easy. There -- it's -- it's a set, race, color,\nreligion, sex or national origin.\nAnd why would they leave it out?\nMR. LAUTEN: Why would they leave 5(g)(2)(A)\nout?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why would they leave\n\"or in violation of Section 2000e-3(a)\"?\nMR. LAUTEN: Well, here's my response to\nthat.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I know your argument\nis well, look, the Court's already said well, that's -\nthat's included, but they've got two provisions fairly\nclose to each other, and I don't know, if they're\nrunning through the usual list, why they wouldn't have\njust run through a list as it appeared in (g)(2)(A).\nMR. LAUTEN: Well, this is really important.\nThe word \"retaliation\" is nowhere in Title VII at all.\nThat's point number 1. Point number 2 is, if --\nCongress could have specifically put in there an\nindividual's race, color, religion, sex or national\norigin, and clearly, that would have been anchored to\ne-2(a) to e-2(d).\nInstead, it created a different provision\naltogether, e-2(m), and specifically said a complaining\nparty demonstrates, and it didn't say under this\nsection, and it defines any unlawful employment\npractice. Any.\nAnd then if you look at e-3(a), it\nspecifically defines what we refer to as retaliation,\nalbeit Title VII doesn't use that word, as an unlawful\nemployment practice.\nNow, I want to make this really clear,\nbecause the Government is not making this -- this\nargument. If you reject our statutory argument, if you\nreject that argument, and you find that e-2(m) does not\ngovern e-3(a), although we strongly urge the Court to -\nto embrace that argument, as the Solicitor General has\ndone as well, but if you reject that argument by\ndefault, we're under Price Waterhouse -- juries have\nbeen instructed since jury trials started in 1991 under\na Price Waterhouse framework in retaliation cases.\nAnd this argument about unwarranted\nretaliation claims, this is the way we've been doing it\nsince 1991. This isn't something new. Juries have been\ninstructed this way since '91. So this idea about\ncreating new jurisprudence, this is a huge step\nbackwards from the framework we've been working under.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But your alternate\nargument would -- would involve two standards, the one\nthat Congress provided for substantive discrimination,\nthe -- the improvement on -- on Price Waterhouse, and\nthen for retaliation, Price Waterhouse.\nMR. LAUTEN: Just -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And I started this -\nthis argument by asking, is there -- in the realm of\nanti-discrimination law, is there any example where you\nhave the -- the substantive charge governed by one\nstandard and retaliation by another?\nMR. LAUTEN: No, ma'am. And -- and you\nbrought up a great point. I am aware -- true to Justice\nKagan's point earlier -- I am aware of nowhere in\nAmerican history of Congress ever creating two causation\nstandards for retaliation and discrimination, especially\nunder the same statute.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It might be a good idea,\nthough, and -- and if so, Congress can do it, right?\nMR. LAUTEN: Well, that's -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, the issue is\nwhether this statute does it or not. The fact that\nnobody has ever done it before, what difference does\nthat make?\nMR. LAUTEN: Well, I think the Court has to\ninterpret the Act, but going back to Judge Ginsburg's -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Do -- do you agree with\nthe Government's position that the limited affirmative\ndefense provisions Congress enacted, that is to say,\nlimited damages when there's multiple or mixed motives\nwould also apply to retaliation cases?\nMR. LAUTEN: Absolutely. If -- if this\nCourt embraces our argument, 5(g)(2)(B) would apply to\nretaliation. But I want to -- this is really important.\nJudge Ginsburg brought up a great point. Justice\nGinsburg. If you do the fallback to Price Waterhouse,\nit doesn't create two causation standards. The juries\nare going to be instructed the same way.\nThe only thing that's going to happen is if\nthey prove the affirmative defense, it's a complete bar.\nWhereas, if you're under the e-2(m) amendment, it goes\nto the remedy, but that is an issue at the time of\njudgment.\nSo no, there -- there won't be two causation\nstandards under Title VII.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Price Waterhouse is a little\ndifferent from subsection (m) though, isn't it? You\nhave to have proof of -- you have to have direct\nevidence of a substantial -- direct and substantial\nevidence before you get into Price Waterhouse, right?\nYou don't need that under subsection (m).\nMR. LAUTEN: I don't have -- I don't have an\nanswer for that. The answer is, I do not know.\nMy -- my belief is that e-2(m) and\n5(g)(2)(B) -- the distinction e-2(m) makes is that it\nmakes it a violation of the Act to prove an illegal\nmotive, whereas in Price Waterhouse, you haven't\nviolated the Act at all until the affirmative defense is\ndisproved.\nSo that that is the distinction with e-2(m).\n5(g)(2)(B) just goes to the remedy, whereas the\naffirmative defense of Price Waterhouse was a complete\nbar. So my point is, is that even if the Court by\ndefault finds that e-2(m) does not apply, you are not\nexchanging or creating two standards.\nAll that is going to happen is that if the\naffirmative defense is prevailed upon under the default\nPrice Waterhouse standard, it's a complete bar, whereas\n5(g)(2)(B) limits the remedies. That's the\nonly distinction.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Isn't it the case that\nJustice O'Connor's opinion in Price Waterhouse required\ndirect evidence and substantial evidence before there\nwas a shift in the burden of proof.\nMR. LAUTEN: I think judge -- I think\nJustice O'Connor in her concurrence did say direct\nevidence under Price Waterhouse, albeit six judges\nagreed in 1989 that motivating factor causation applies.\nThe -- I guess the last point that I want to\nmake is this Court really needs to consider this record\non its face. Dr. Nassar, after going through months of\ndiscrimination, finally reports that he's leaving. In\nthis record, Dr. Fitz admitted to Dr. Keiser.\nDr. Keiser, a white Baptist supervisor to Dr. Nassar,\ngoes and -- and reports it.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMR. LAUTEN: Sorry. Thank you for your\ntime.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Ms. Sherry.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MELISSA ARBUS SHERRY,\nFOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,\nSUPPORTING THE RESPONDENT\nMS. ARBUS SHERRY: Mr. Chief Justice, and\nmay it please the Court:\nI want to start, Justice Alito, with your\nquestion as to why it would make sense or why it might\nmake sense for Congress to adopt a different causation\nstandard with respect to substantive discrimination on\nthe one hand and retaliation on the other.\nAnd what that question reveals is what,\nJustice Kagan, you had mentioned. There is not a single\nstatute that Petitioner can point to and not a single\nstatute that I am aware of where Congress has ever\nexpressly adopted two different causation standards with\nrespect to intentional discrimination under the same\nstatute.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But I thought -- I thought\nthe thrust of Justice Alito's question was that\nretaliation claims are -- are now quite common, and they\ncan almost be used as a defensive mechanism, as a\ndefense when you know you are about to be hired. And if\nthat's true, shouldn't we be very careful about the\ncausation standard?\nMS. ARBUS SHERRY: And on that -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And so -- so that -- that\nwas the thrust of -- of his question.\nMS. ARBUS SHERRY: And -- and I want to\naddress that because I don't think that's quite right.\nYou can't just scream \"Discrimination\" when you're, you\nknow, when the writing is on the wall and you know\nyou're going to get fired.\nAs this Court recognized in Clark County,\nthe courts of appeals have uniformly in opposition cases\nrequired there to be a reasonable good faith belief that\nthe discrimination actually occurred. So if we are\ntalking about truly frivolous claims, I know I am going\nto get fired, you know, I might as well say my boss is,\nyou know, sexually harassing me, that's not going to\nhappen; those cases are going to be weeded out.\nThe other point I would make -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Where are they -\nwhere are they going to be weeded out? On summary\njudgment or on -- after trial?\nMS. ARBUS SHERRY: At summary judgment. And\nthey are weeded out at summary judgment. In cases -\nthere needs to be a protected activity, and it is not a\nprotected activity if your claim of discrimination -\nyou don't have a reasonable belief in that claim.\nAgain, you can't just scream \"Discrimination\" as they\nare kicking you out the door.\nThe other point I would -\nJUSTICE ALITO: That's -- that's a fair\npoint, but it's, like, if we change it a little bit so\nthat it's -- it's not frivolous, but it is clearly\ngroundless once its examined, then you still have the\nproblem.\nMS. ARBUS SHERRY: And then I don't think\nit's as severe of a problem as Your Honor is suggesting,\nfor a couple of different reasons. Number one, if you\nare positing a situation where there is clear evidence\nthat the employer would have made the same decision\nregardless, that is a defense that is available to the\nemployer and there is no reason they couldn't seek\npartial summary judgment with respect to that. That\nseverely limits the remedies that are available.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. I don't\nunderstand. Say again?\nMS. ARBUS SHERRY: In circumstances where\nthe employer would have made the same decision -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Right.\nMS. ARBUS SHERRY: -- even without the\nimproper motive -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes.\nMS. ARBUS SHERRY: -- that is a defense\nunder (g)(2)(B), and it's something that the employer\ncould certainly raise under partial summary judgment\nthat would severely limit the remedies available.\nThe other point I would is it does still\nneeds to be a motivating factor. It needs to actually\nplay a role in the employment decision, and so that is\nthe standard. And it's a standard that, you know, that\nCongress has adopted clearly with respect to substantive\ndiscrimination claims.\nAnd if I could turn now to the language of\nthe statute because that is our primary argument. If\nyou look at the language -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Just before you do\nthat -\nMS. ARBUS SHERRY: Sure.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- because I\nunderstood we are talking about what possible reason\nthere could be for drawing this distinction. It seems\nto me that the protection against discrimination -\nrace, color, religion, sex -- that sets forth the basic\nprinciple of -- of fair and equal treatment.\nThe anti-retaliation provision is more\nfunctional. The way you protect against that\ndiscrimination is you make sure people don't retaliate\nwhen they complain about it. Now that seems to me to be\nan order of -- of hierarchy, removed from the basic\nprinciple. So perhaps you would have a different\nstandard of causation when you deal with that.\nMS. ARBUS SHERRY: And I don't think it is,\nfor the reasons that this Court talked about in\nBurlington Northern and in Thompson and in Crawford.\nAnd what the Court said in those cases is that the two\nare linked together. You do need to have robust\nretaliation protections in order to ensure that that\nprimary purpose, that discrimination, is outside of the\nworkplace. And so if employees are worried or afraid to\ncome forward and report discrimination, the\ndiscrimination is going to persist. It's not going to\nbe remedied.\nAnd so the two are linked together and it\nmakes sense to have the same -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That -- I think that\nwas my point, that they are linked together but they are\nat different levels. I mean, the -- you protect against\nretaliation so that the protection against race, color,\nnational origin can be vindicated.\nMS. ARBUS SHERRY: And I -- I agree with\nYour Honor. I think you -- that is the reason you\nprotect against retaliation. And in order to have\nsufficient protections so that interest can be\nvindicated, individual employees need to feel\ncomfortable coming forward.\nJUSTICE ALITO: The problem is -\nMS. ARBUS SHERRY: And you have a -\nJUSTICE ALITO: The problem is this: It's\none thing to say, and it's a good thing to say to\nemployers: When you are making employment decisions,\nyou take race out of your mind, take gender out of your\nmind, take national origin out of your mind. It's not\nsomething you can even think about.\nBut when you are talking about retaliation,\nwhen you are talking about an employer who has been,\nperhaps publicly, charged with discrimination and the\nemployer knows that the charge is not a good charge,\nit's pretty -- it's very, very difficult to say to that\nemployer and very difficult for the employer to say:\nI'm going to take this completely out of my mind.\nI'm not even going to think about the fact\nthat I am -- have been wrongfully charged with\ndiscrimination. Isn't that a real difference?\nMS. ARBUS SHERRY: I don't think it is and I\nthink it's significant if we are talking about\ndistinguishing between retaliation -- It's significant\nthat Congress in a number of whistleblower statutes, so\nspecifically retaliation statutes, has adopted a\ncontributing factor, a motivating factor standard, and\nin fact has adopted a same-decision defense where you\nneed clear and convincing evidence. So I think\nCongress's judgment is that that distinction is not one\nthat should be made, that it is -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You -- you talk about\nCongress as though it's a continuing body out there, the\nsame people, and would the same people that did this do\nthat. They are not the same people. I don't know what\nCongress it was that passed this particular act versus\nother antidiscrimination acts. Some of them may have\nbeen Democratic Congresses and others may have been\nRepublican Congresses.\nTo -- to assume that there is one Congress\nout there that -- that has to operate logically in all\nthese areas, it seems to me unrealistic. And -- and the\nbest thing we can be guided by is simply the text that\nCongress adopted, however the makeup of that Congress\nhappened to be.\nMS. ARBUS SHERRY: And thank you,\nJustice Scalia. I am actually happy to turn to the\ntext. I think it's important to look at the language of\nSubsection (m) and it's on page 15a of our brief. And\nif you follow that language, it starts off very plainly\nsaying as \"Except as otherwise provided in Subchapter\n(m), unlawful employment practice is established.\" This\nis a means of proving an unlawful employment practice.\nAnd we know when you look at 3a, which is on\npage 17a of our brief, that retaliation is an unlawful\nemployment practice. Congress used that phrase\n\"unlawful employment practice\" in Subsection (m). It's\nan unadorned phrase. It didn't limit it. It didn't say\n\"under this section\"; it didn't say \"under Section\n2000e-2(a). It said \"unlawful employment practice.\"\nAnd if you continue on: \"When the\ncomplaining party demonstrates that race, color,\nreligion, sex or national origin was a motivating\nfactor.\"\nAnd we know under this Court's cases under\nGomez-Perez, under CBOCS, under Jackson and Sullivan\nthat race is a motivating factor in an employment\ndecision that is based on retaliation when you've\ncomplained about race discrimination.\nAnd so the language of (m), the plain\nlanguage, clearly encompasses the retaliation claims in\nTitle VII. And so the only argument, I believe, that\nPetitioner is making is that there are things elsewhere\nin the statute that might make you think otherwise here.\nAnd we would argue that none of them -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but under -- under\nthat analysis, you don't need the final clause on page\n17a of your brief of 3, \"because he has opposed.\" Race\nis enough.\nMS. ARBUS SHERRY: I think that defines what\nthe protected activity is. I don't think it is any\ndifferent than in Jackson or Gomez-Perez. In those\ncases, it was a general discrimination provision, but\nonce retaliation claims are recognized, there -- there\nstill actually needs to be protected activity. There\nhas to be opposition, there has to be participation of\nsome sort. And so I don't think it's any different in\nthat respect.\nJustice Scalia, you were talking about\ng-2(a), and if I could just take a moment on that,\nbecause that is one of the arguments that Petitioner is\nmaking. My colleague made the point that it was adopted\nby the 1964 Congress; it was adopted before Sullivan.\nAnd so if I could focus on the 1991 Congress that\nenacted both subsection (m) and subsection g-2(b), that\nCongress was acting in light of Sullivan. And we know\nit was legislating with full knowledge of Sullivan,\nbecause that's exactly what this Court said in CBOCS.\nCBOCS involved Section 101, rather, of the\n1991 Act; this involves Section 107 of the 1991 Act.\nSo we know that when Congress was writing\n(m) and when it was writing g-2(b), it knew, because of\nSullivan, that it didn't need extra words. It didn't\nneed redundant words. It didn't have to say under\nSection 2000e-2 and Section 2000e-3; it could simply say\nexactly what it said in (m), and that would do the\ntrick. And it's a common rule of statutory\ninterpretation that you don't add extra words if you\ndon't need them. And so what Congress did in (m) is it\nadopted exactly what words it needed to effectuate its\npurpose, which is to have one causation standard, a\nmotivating factor standard available with respect to all\nintentional discrimination claims -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But the maxim that you\ndon't add words where you don't need them doesn't -\ndoesn't help your case. It hurts your case, because in\nthe other provision that was carried over from the prior\nlaw, you -- you were making a nullity of the -- the\naddition after referring to discrimination on the basis\nof race, of, you know, retaliation.\nMS. ARBUS SHERRY: Your Honor, may I? To\nanswer that question, it's important -- what happened in\n1991, Congress didn't add that language, it didn't amend\nthat language; it simply didn't delete it. And I think\nit's completely reasonable when Congress is faced with a\nchoice of deleting language that had been there for\n25 years that wasn't a problem, it's just at worst was\nredundant, chose to leave it in place lest any negative\ninference arise from the deletion, and simply legislate\nin subsection (m), in g-2(b), based on the new\nunderstanding that the Court adopted in Sullivan.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Joseffer, you have three minutes\nremaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DARYL L. JOSEFFER\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. JOSEFFER: Thank you. This case seems\nto boil down to two very simple legislative drafting\nrules or interpretive principles. The first is, from\nGross, we know that Congress doesn't relieve the\nplaintiff of the traditional burden of proof unless it\nspecifically indicates so. And so then we talk to\nsubsection (m) where the relevant bases are the litany\nof race, color, sex, religion, and national origin.\nSo the second interpretive principle is,\nthen, does that litany here encompass, you know,\ncomplaining about unlawful conduct and participating in\nan investigation, which are the protected conduct for\npurposes of retaliation. That principle comes straight\nout of Jackson and Gomez-Perez, that when Congress\nbroadly refers to discrimination on the basis of race in\nthe statute without greater specificity, the Court will\nread retaliation in.\nWhen Congress breaks it out, the surplusage\ncanon -- and I agree with Justice Scalia, I really\ndidn't understand why they were talking about that -\nand also the general canon is the same canon, which is,\nput differently, is that specific provisions, you know,\ncontrol over general ones, they're not subsumed within\nthem.\nThat tells us that when Congress is speaking\nmore specifically, it's speaking more specifically.\nHere, that tells Congress very clearly how to amend\nthese statutes when it wishes to, which it does all the\ntime, and how the courts -- and how lower courts should\nconstrue them.\nIn addition, Title VII, as a whole, is\nespecially clear, because the same subsection 2 within\nTitle VII, when it wants to refer to all types of\nemployment discrimination, it will say \"a claim of\nemployment discrimination.\" And by the way, the 1991\nCongress put that provision in there. So this Congress\nknew how to say \"any claim of employment\ndiscrimination,\" as it did so in subsection (n), which\ncomes right after this one.\nCongress will also say \"an unlawful\nemployment practice\" when it's referring to all of them,\nbut when it wants to specifically refer to one subset or\nanother, it does so. That's a clear, logical, coherent\nreading of the statute as a whole that every court of\nappeals to consider the question has adopted.\nThey're asking you to read various statutory\nprovisions to be surplusage, and there's simply no\nreason to do so, especially because, looking just at\n1991, Congress at that point was not saying, oh, in\nlight of Jackson, we can now just speak more generally.\nBecause it, specifically in 1991, cross-referenced the\nanti-retaliation provision of Title VII when it wanted\nto, and it specifically used broader phrases like \"a\nclaim of employment discrimination\" when it wanted to.\nAnd especially since the whole point of\nGross, or much of the point of Gross was to replace a -\na totally unworkable and confusing regime with something\nthat is clear and straightforward, you've done that.\nAnd the question now is whether to retreat back into a\njurisprudential morass where, within the very same\nstatute, the drafting rules this Court has otherwise\narticulated, no longer apply.\nThe final point I'd make is that, yeah,\nthere's this question about are -- are we treating, you\nknow, retaliation and -- and substantive discrimination\ndifferently within one statute, and the answer is, well,\nyes, as Congress did. The other way of looking at it is\nthey want to treat retaliation differently in this\nstatute than it's treated in every other statute. You\ncan -- you can point to similar anomalies across the\nboard, the reason being that Congress has chosen to have\ntwo different sections within this area. And -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
