        "content": "(11:06 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument\nnext in case 06-6330, Kimbrough versus United States.\nMr. Nachmanoff.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL NACHMANOFF\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. NACHMANOFF: Mr. Chief Justice, and may\nit please the Court:\nDerrick Kimbrough's case is about what a\ndistrict court may consider when imposing sentence in\nconformity with Section 3553(a).\nThat statute directs sentencing courts to do\nexactly what Judge Jackson did in this case. He\nproperly calculated and considered the advisory\nguideline range, the Sentencing Commission's reports,\nMr. Kimbrough's personal history and background, and the\noffense itself, as directed by the statute. He then made\ncase-specific findings to impose an appropriate\nsentence, and he did not make any categorical\ndeterminations.\nThe Fourth Circuit reversed, applying a\nper se rule prohibiting disagreement with the crack\ncocaine guideline. The government, on the other hand,\nargues that Congress has implicitly directed sentencing\ncourts to adhere to the crack guidelines.\nBoth of these positions are wrong.\nWith respect to the Fourth Circuit, the\nFourth Circuit applied a rigid rule that prohibited any\ndisagreement with the crack guideline, which is\ndetermined solely by drug type and quantity. They then\nprohibited the imposition of any sentence outside the\nguideline range, either above it or below it, unless the\ncourt identified facts specific to the defendant or the\noffense.\nThis ruling is inconsistent with the Court's\nholdings in Cunningham and Rita, which hold that the\ncourts must be free to disagree with policies.\nFinally, the Fourth Circuit required that\nthose facts be atypical, which mirrors the exact\nlanguage that was excised in 3553(b)(1).\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Could the Congress have\nmandated the result and the rationale that the Fourth\nCircuit used here?\nMR. NACHMANOFF: Your Honor, Congress can\ncertainly speak explicitly through its statutes to\nimpose further refinements on the penalty structure that\nit set out in 841.\nSection 841, on its face, does no more than\nset mandatory minimums and maximums at two triggering\nquantities. If Congress wanted to specify further\ntriggering quantities which would cabin the discretion\nof sentencing courts, they could do so, but they have\nnot done so and there is no canon of statutory\nconstruction that the government identifies or that I'm\naware of that would justify the notion of the implicit\nbinding directive.\nJUSTICE ALITO: If Congress made a finding\nthat crack and cocaine are equally dangerous and passed\na statute that said, for sentencing purposes, every\ndistrict judge shall treat cases involving these two\nsubstances exactly the same, would there be a Sixth\nAmendment problem with that? Or do you think every\ndistrict judge gets the right to make that policy\ndecision individually?\nMR. NACHMANOFF: Justice Alito, Congress\ncertainly can cabin the discretion of judges. But once\nthey set a floor and a ceiling, pursuant to this Court's\nremedial holding in Booker, judges must be free to\nconsider the entire range of punishment. And Booker\nrelies on the notion that the Guidelines are now fully\nadvisory and, therefore, judges without having to\nidentify specific facts have to have the discretion to\ndisagree with policies or identify things unique to the\ncase in order to fashion an appropriate punishment.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: What's your answer simply\nto the very simple argument that because the floor was\nset on the assumption of a 100 to 1 ratio, set by\nCongress, that any other sentencing assumption,\nregardless of the particular justifications in a given\ncase, is simply incoherent with the statutory scheme and\nfor that reason should be regarded as unreasonable?\nMR. NACHMANOFF: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: It is the coherence problem\nthat is bothering us.\nMR. NACHMANOFF: Yes. There are several\nanswers to that question, Justice Souter. The first is\nthat this Court has recognized with the same statute\nwhich has the same structure that the government argues\ncan only logically be understood one way, that with\nregard to the weight for LSD in the case of Neal versus\nUnited States, it is perfectly appropriate for there to\nbe two different methods of calculating weight for\npurposes of punishment. The Guidelines calculate weight\nbased on a presumed weight of the combination of the LSD\nand the blotter paper or the carrier medium. And the\nstatute defines the method for calculating the mandatory\nminimum by the combined weight of the LSD and the\nblotter paper, regardless of whether it is heavy or\nwhether it is light.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But is that an argument for\nsaying, well, in the LSD case, you approved of\nincoherence and irrationality, therefore, you want to do\nit across the board? I mean, there is still an argument\nhere on the merits regardless of Neal that there is an\nincoherence between the minimum and the kind of\ndiscretion that you're talking about.\nMR. NACHMANOFF: Well, Your Honor, I think\nwhat Neal reflects is that there's no implicit binding\npolicy directive in 841 itself that requires either the\nCommission or sentencing courts to follow in lock step\non a graduated proportionate scheme, whatever it is that\nCongress decided with respect to two specific triggers\nshould be the case.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Did we have the cliff\nproblem in the LSD case?\nMR. NACHMANOFF: Yes, Your Honor. The Court\nrecognized that, in fact, cliffs are the inevitable\nresults of mandatory minimums.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So we are in the same boat,\nthen, you say with Neal in that respect, too?\nMR. NACHMANOFF: Yes, and Your Honor, if I\ncould also point out that there really is a myth here\nwith regard to the 100 to 1 ratio as it stands now and\nas the Commission created it in 1987. The 100 to 1\nratio describes the relative weight of crack cocaine and\npowder cocaine with regard to the levels in the\nsentencing table; so that if you compare, for example,\nthe 10-year mandatory minimum trigger, 50 grams of\ncrack, that gets you to a level 32 in the sentencing\ntable and it requires 5 kilos of powder cocaine or 5,000\ngrams. That's the 100 to 1 ratio.\nAnd it is true that if one compares the low\nend of that table -- 5 kilos to 50 grams, you end up\nwith the same punishment, or likewise, if you compare\nthe top of the range, 15 kilos to a 150 grams.\nBut the way the guidelines have been\nwritten, there are a multitude of ratios that get\napplied right now and were applied in the pre-Booker\nguidelines scheme.\nIn other words, 14.9 kilos of powder\ncompared to 51 grams of crack results in a 292 to 1\nratio. You get the exact same punishment, it is a level\n32.\nLikewise if you flip it, and you compare 149\ngrams of crack to 5 kilos of powder cocaine, you are\nstill within a level 32, and it is a 34 to 1 ratio.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Maybe that was wrong.\nMaybe the Sentencing Commission should have, in order to\nbe faithful to the Congressional determination, should\nhave done it quite proportionately. I mean, I'm not\nhung up on what the Sentencing Commission said. I'm\nhung up on what the courts should do now.\nMR. NACHMANOFF: I agree, Justice Scalia.\nAnd of course, the Sentencing Commission taken to the\nultimate extreme would have had to have a proportionate\nsentencing table by gram or fraction of a gram in order\nto preserve the 100 to 1 ratio, which simply points out\nin combination with Neal the fact that this was a choice\nmade by the Commission, a choice, by the way, not\ngrounded on any empirical evidence or any other reason\nother than what 841 originally indicated.\nIt could have been done differently. It is\ndone differently with regard to other drugs in 841, such\nas LSD or such as marijuana plants, which have a\ndifferent method for calculation under the Guidelines as\nthey do for purposes of mandatory minimums. And, of\ncourse, what that means is that there is no implicit\ndirective, which is the only rational --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: That just goes back to\nJustice Scalia's point. There may very well be an\nimplicit Congressional directive that the Commission did\nnot follow.\nMR. NACHMANOFF: Well -- Your Honor,\nCongress has a method --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: It did not reject them, you\nare saying? So, therefore, in effect, there was a\nCongressional ratification?\nMR. NACHMANOFF: Well, Congress did not\nreject the original table that was created by the\nCommission in 1987. That is correct. But Congress also\ndid not at any time in Section 994, which is where it\nhas given other explicit directions to the Commission to\nfashion guidelines in a particular way, say anything\nabout how to fashion the punishment for crack cocaine or\nany of the other drugs in Section 841.\nSo Congress understands if it wants to give\nfurther guidance to the Commission how to do it.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Nachmanoff, in the\nabsence of anything further from Congress, and accepting\nyour argument that there's no -- that the Guidelines did\nnot have to adopt the ratio that is applicable to the\nmandatory minimum, could a district judge then say, I\nsee that this disparity is untenable, but I think drugs\nare a very bad thing, so I'm going to sentence for\npowder as high as for crack?\nMR. NACHMANOFF: Justice Ginsburg, our rule\ncertainly contemplates the fact that there may be\ncircumstances in which district judges may come to\nconclusions about the appropriate sentence, taking into\nconsideration the purposes of sentencing and the\nparsimony provision --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But if we throw out the\n100 to 1, what is the range open to the district\njudge -- hundred to one is okay, but I have to use\nthe -- I'm going to use the crack for both? Or say\nthere is a difference between the two, so I'm going to\nset it at 20 to 1 and another judge 5 to 1.\nWhat is -- are all those reasonable within\nthe position that you take in this case? Would all\nthose have to pass muster at the court of appeals level?\nMR. NACHMANOFF: Well those certainly are\npositions that judges could take. In this particular\ncase, the judge was presented with information that led\nthe court to conclude that reducing the sentence for\ncrack based on the Commission's overwhelming empirical\nevidence and penological evidence and the statistical\nevidence that was submitted was relevant to the various\nfactors in 3553(a), in particular the purposes of\nsentencing. And that the Guidelines would not be\nappropriate and, therefore, a lower sentence would be\nappropriate.\nJUSTICE ALITO: What if the Fourth Circuit\nsees a number of absolutely identical cases exactly like\nMr. Kimbrough's, and it is apparent in one, the\nsentencing judge either explicitly or implicitly has\nused a 1 to 1, and the next one used 20 to 1, the next\none has used 50 to 1, the next one has used 80 to 1, and\nthe next one has used 100 to 1, what is it to do under\nreasonableness review?\nMR. NACHMANOFF: The court of appeals has\nbeen given explicit instruction by this Court that it is\nto review all of those sentences under an abuse of\ndiscretion, which means that its job is not to\nsubstitute its judgment for the lower court.\nAnd if those sentencing courts have\narticulated reasons and have relied on relevant and\nreliable --\nJUSTICE ALITO: But the cases are absolutely\nidentical. Everything is absolutely identical about\nthem, except for the sentences. Can't introduce any new\nvariables. What is the court of appeals to do?\nThis is not a hypothetical situation,\nreally. This is what courts of appeals who have to see\ndozens of these cases have to do. There's a policy\nquestion there. How severely should crack be treated?\nWhat is the substantive review that the court of appeals\nis supposed to provide in that situation?\nMR. NACHMANOFF: Justice Alito, sentencing\ncourts now are free to consider the full range of\npunishment and to consider the purposes of sentencing in\nboth issue-specific to the defendant and the offense and\nalso general policy issues. That is the clear holding\nof the Booker remedial opinion and reaffirmed in\nCunningham and in Rita. When judges have that full\ndiscretion to consider the guidelines and follow the\nmandates of 3553(a), but then impose a sentence that\nmeets the purposes of sentencing and is consistent with\nthe parsimony provision, there may well be judges that\ncome to different conclusions, as your hypothetical\nposits, about what people with similar or even identical\nrecords and identical circumstances may -- may do.\nI would say that the reality is in the\nlower courts no two cases are alike, and so there are\nalways reasons for judges to make reasoned distinctions\nin imposing sentences, even where, for example, the drug\ntype and quantity is identical.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, I take it your answer\nis that all or most of those cases would be affirmed\nunder reasonableness -- under abuse of discretion\nreview?\nMR. NACHMANOFF: If -- yes.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: If you were representing\nthe one who got the 80 to 1 ratio you would file an\namicus brief, no error in judgment?\nMR. NACHMANOFF: Well, Justice Souter, if\nthe court followed the procedural requirements of\n3553(a), if the information was subjected to the\nadversarial process, and if the court imposed a sentence\nconsistent with the parsimony clause, it would be hard\nto imagine a basis upon which to object.\nJUSTICE BREYER: The basis is that that\nwould be the end of the Guidelines. I mean, that --\nevery judge has his own view of policy and there is a\nvast range. No point having advice -- I mean, fine,\nbut I don't think this Court said it, and I think that\nthe test is supposed to be reasonableness, and I think\n3553(a) does have a lot of instructions, and one of the\nmajor thrusts is follow the Guidelines. It doesn't make\nthem mandatory. But they're in there.\nAll right, so the problem for me is just\nwhat Justice Alito was saying: Is there a path here\nbetween saying, well, judge, leaving everything special\nabout your case out of it -- we're only talking about a\njudge who says there's nothing special about my case --\nI disagree with the policy of the commission.\nIn such a case, is there a choice between\nsaying that no matter what the commission says, the\ncourt of appeals must insist that their district judges\nfollow in terms of a policy; and the opposite, which is\nto say they don't have to do anything that the\ncommission says, because the commission is always\nchoosing among reasonable choices. Very rarely -- maybe\nyou have one in this case -- but very rarely is it\ntotally unreasonable.\nHow do we thread the channel?\nMR. NACHMANOFF: Justice Breyer, the Booker\nremedial opinion makes it crystal-clear that to avoid\nthe Sixth Amendment problem with the mandatory\nGuidelines, judges must be free to disagree with the\nGuidelines.\nJUSTICE BREYER: To the extent that it's\nreasonable, and where we're talking about individual\ncases we've already said, given the history of our legal\nsystem, it's very reasonable to give lots of discretion\nto the district judge.\nNow we're talking about what's reasonable in\nthe context of 3553(a); and I don't think Booker says\none way or the other on that, nor I do believe Rita says\none way or the other.\nMR. NACHMANOFF: Your Honor, 3553(a) is\ndriven by the purposes of sentencing.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Driven by a Congress that\nwrote guidelines; and at the last minute, in a separate\nmatter that we've taken out and wasn't put in the\ninitial draft added the word \"mandatory.\" So the\nhistory of 3553(a) is a history of a statute that is\nseeking uniformity through guidelines.\nAt least that's my view of it. And for\npurposes of the question, which is an important question\nto me, let's assume that.\nMR. NACHMANOFF: Well, Your Honor, the\nappellate courts still have a role to play and that role\nis to ensure that the sentencing courts have followed\nthe mandate of 3553(a), and that --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Indeed, it may be quite\nimpossible to achieve uniformity through advisory\nguidelines, which is why Congress made them mandatory.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. NACHMANOFF: That very well may be,\nJustice Scalia. In -- this Court even in the remedial\nopinion in Booker recognized that uniformity as it was\nunderstood in the pre-Booker days would be reduced, and\nthat there might be more sentences that have different\nresults --\nJUSTICE BREYER: In other words, I'm\nassuming now you have not -- you don't have a good\nanswer to my question. You're saying either we have to\nmake it unconstitutional, which I don't think they are,\nor you have to say anything goes, and that my question\nhas no answer in your view?\nMR. NACHMANOFF: Well, Justice Breyer, your\nquestion certainly is a difficult one. Let me say this:\nWith regard to uniformity, Congress has the power to\nmake sentences more uniform. They can do it in a\nvariety of ways and they have done it where they've\nthought it was important. They haven't done it with\nregard to the 100 to 1 ratio beyond the mandatory\nminimum or the statutory maximum.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And you don't say -- you\ndon't say anything goes. I mean, the hypothetical that\nJustice Alito gave is -- is easy, only because Congress\nhas created the 100 to 1 ratio as presumably reasonable.\nIf Congress enacted it as a statute, it has to be\nreasonable.\nSo that enables you to say anything from 1\nto 1 to 100 to 1 is reasonable. But your position is\nnot anything goes. It's anything that's reasonable\ngoes.\nMR. NACHMANOFF: That is correct, Justice\nScalia. And --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And is \"reasonable\"\ndefined as an appropriate interpretation of\ncongressional intent, or does \"reasonable\" mean\nsomething else, like a just sentence? What -- how do we\ndefine \"reasonable\"?\nMR. NACHMANOFF: Well, Your Honor, I think\nthat that --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Whether or not the\ncommission and then the district judge reasonably\ninterpret the congressional intent, and if the\ncommission reasonably interprets the congressional\nintent is the district court allowed to disregard that?\nMR. NACHMANOFF: Sentencing courts must be\nable to disagree with the commission's conclusions about\ncongressional intent.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Assuming the commission\nwas reasonable, can they still disagree?\nMR. NACHMANOFF: Yes, Your Honor. I think\nthat is the essence of the Booker remedial holding, that\nin order to cure the constitutional problem with\nmandatory guidelines, judges must be free to reject,\nmust be free to reject those guidelines. And in fact\nCunningham makes that clear, that in the California\ndeterminate sentencing area it was the inability of\njudges to impose a higher sentence based on the general\nobjectives of sentencing, as opposed to particular\nfactors or circumstances in aggravation, that made it\nunconstitutional. So whether the commission concluded\nthat the congressional intent was to import the 100 to 1\nratio or not -- and clearly there is no statutory\nconstruction that can be inferred or understood from 841\nby itself. It is not explicit and the government\nconcedes that.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So in your case you ask us\nto establish the proposition that in any case, a\nsentencing judge must always be free to disregard a\nreasonable interpretation of the Commission, a\nreasonable interpretation of a congressional statute?\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I interrupt before you\nanswer. The question isn't whether they can justify a\nreasonable. It's whether they can justify not following\none that creates unwarranted disparities within the\nmeaning of the statute.\nMR. NACHMANOFF: That's -- that's correct,\nJustice Stevens.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: You would go further --\nyou would go further and -- and submit to us the\nproposition that I -- that I just stated?\nMR. NACHMANOFF: Well, Your Honor, if -- if\nI understood it correctly, the question is whether or\nnot when the commission concludes this is what Congress\nintended --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Reasonably.\nMR. NACHMANOFF: -- reasonably -- does it\nsomehow imbue that particular guideline with some\nspecial binding nature. And my response would be that\nthe Booker remedial opinion makes it clear that the\nGuidelines as a whole must be viewed as advisory. The\ngovernment tries to argue that if some Guidelines are\nspecial and are binding, and others are advisory,\nthere's no Sixth Amendment problem. But that ignores\nthe fundamental principle of the Booker remedial hearing\n-- holding, which is that the Guidelines as a whole must\nbe advisory and judges must be able to disagree with\nthem. And of course here is perhaps the paradigmatic\nexample of a time when the commission's original\nguidelines got it wrong, didn't further the purposes of\nsentencing; and, of course, they themselves have made\nthat conclusion, and for sentencing purposes --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But -- and I take it your\nsubmission is that the district court must be able to\nmake the determination that the commission's policy is\nto be disregarded in every case to come before the\ncourt?\nMR. NACHMANOFF: Well, Your Honor, 3553(a)\nrequires individualized sentencing. There's no question\nthat judges are required to follow in every case the\nmandates of 3553(a) and to calculate the advisory\nGuidelines correctly.\nNow, there is no reason why judges cannot in\na certain class of cases conclude that the Guideline\ngets it wrong; that it overstates the seriousness of the\noffense; that it creates an unwarranted disparity; and\nthat they are going to impose a sentence outside of that\nguideline range.\nThat does not in any way remove the\nrequirement that they subject every sentencing to the\nadversarial process to give the parties the opportunity\nto convince them that the guidelines should be followed,\nor not followed, or to be reconsidered.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And Mr. Nachmanoff, I\nthink that you are agreeing, although you don't want to\ncome right out and say it, with Justice Scalia's point;\nthat is, anything from a hundred to one down to one to\none is open to the district judge; and within that\nrange, there is no abuse of discretion.\nMR. NACHMANOFF: Your Honor, I certainly\nagree that that full range is available to the\nsentencing court.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Only because Congress has\nsaid 100 to 1. That strikes me as utterly unreasonable.\nBut if Congress has said it, it can't be unreasonable.\nThat's what makes that an easy hypothetical, but that\nwould not be the normal case, that a 100 to 1 disparity\nwouldn't be -- would not be unreasonable.\nMR. NACHMANOFF: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: In any case, your answer\nis anything from what Congress has said, down to one to\none, would be a reasonable sentence that would be --\nthat would pass muster on appeal because it is not an\nabuse of discretion.\nMR. NACHMANOFF: Well, if I can be clear,\nJustice Ginsburg, sentencing courts must have available\nto them the full range of punishment as defined by\nCongress. And that range, for purposes of 841, are\nbroad ranges based on triggering quantities at 5 grams\nand 50 grams for crack cocaine. Within those ranges, as\nlong as the court follows the requirements of 3553(a),\nconsiders all the purposes of sentencing, engages in an\nindividualized sentencing process, and relies on\nrelevant and reliable information, there would be no\nbasis under abuse of discretion review to reverse the\nsentencing court in that instance.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But you've given me a\nbunch of hand holds that, quite frankly, are quite easy\nfor a district judge to say: Here's my laundry list;\nand I'm going to go through every one of them; but in\nthe end I think the ratio should be 20 to 1; and that's\nwhat I'm going to impose.\nMR. NACHMANOFF: Well, again, Your Honor,\nCongress certainly has the power to cabin that\ndiscretion. They just need to do it explicitly, and\nthey have not done so.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So -- Congress not having\ndone that, then the range is open to the district\njudges, 100 to 1 to 1 to 1.\nMR. NACHMANOFF: That's correct, Your Honor.\nIf if may reserve the remainder of my time for rebuttal.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.\nNachmanoff. Mr. Dreeben?\nORAL ARGUMENT BY MICHAEL R. DREEBEN\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. DREEBEN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the court:\nThe question in this case is essentially,\ncan a district court reasonably disagree with the\njudgment of Congress concerning the ratio between the\nquantity-based sentences for crack and powder.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Dreeben, can I ask a\nquestion right at the outset that is critical for me. I\nthink this case may well be controlled by the decision\nin Neal against the United States, which is not cited in\nthe government brief and wasn't cited in the blue brief.\nBut there the Court held that a policy\njudgment by Congress fixing mandatory minimums on the\nbasis of the weight of the carrier rather than the drug\ndid not justify guidelines based on that ratio -- based\non the same principle -- if that would produce\nunwarranted disparities.\nAnd, as I understand the facts of this case,\nthe Commission has told us actually in some of its\nreports that the 100 to 1 ratio does produce unwarranted\ndisparities. Therefore, we should disregard the entire\nguideline as we did in Neal, and the reason the Neal\ncase is controlling in this case.\nMR. DREEBEN: Justice Stevens, let me start\nwith the Neal decision, because I think Neal is\nfundamentally unlike this case. In Neal this Court had\nto determine whether its prior construction of a\nstatute, Section 841, survived the Commission's\ndecision --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But that is a construction\nof what Congress intended, and for purposes of decision\nwe assumed that Congress intended what we held the\nstatute meant.\nMR. DREEBEN: Justice Stevens, the only\nquestion presented in Neal was, did the Commission's\nweight guideline for LSD require this Court to change\nits interpretation of Section 841. And the Court held\nno.\nThere was no question before the Court about\nwhether the Sentencing Commission had legitimately\nadopted a different formula than the mixture or\nsubstance rule that this Court had held governed the\nstatute.\nThe LSD guideline was not in play in Neal.\nThe government never challenged it. Its rationality was\nnot at issue. All the Court had to hold was that\nwhatever the Sentencing Commission did --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: It does hold that a\nguideline that does not conform with a congressional\njudgment merely expressed in a mandatory minimum is a\nguideline that would survive.\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, I disagree with that,\nJustice Stevens, because no one challenged the guideline\nin Neal. There was nothing at issue in the Court to\ndecide about whether that Guideline was valid. But even\nif the Court thought that Neal does involve some sort of\na principle that the Sentencing Commission has greater\nfreedom to vary from the procedures laid out in a\nmandatory minimum sentencing statute, Neal does not\ncontrol this case, because there is more data about what\nCongress intended the ratio between crack and powder to\nbe, and because Congress changed the basic, organic\nstatute that governs the Sentencing Commission's --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, but there's also more\ndata that the Commission has reflected on all this and\nstill concludes that the 100 to 1 ratio creates an\nunwarranted disparity which is contrary to the statute.\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, the statute, itself,\nSection 841, establishes the ratio of a 100 to 1. When\nthe Commission first considered creating drug\nguidelines --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: It establishes the ratio\nfor mandatory minimum purposes only, is what Neal held.\nMR. DREEBEN: Well I disagree with that,\nJustice Stevens, and I'm trying to explain why the legal\ncontext is different from the legal context in Neal.\nLet me start with a couple of points about\nthis. First of all, when the Commission promulgated the\ndrug Guideline initially, it conformed it to the 100 to\n1 ratio that existed under the mandatory minimum\nsentencing statute, because it recognized -- and these\nwere the Commission's words -- that a logical and\ncoherent sentencing scheme required that there be\nconsistent proportionality throughout the sentencing\nprocess.\nWhen the Commission later studied the\ncrack-powder ratio and concluded that Congress had\ngotten it wrong and, therefore, the Commission, itself,\nhad gotten it wrong by conforming to what Congress did,\nit proposed a Guideline that would have changed the\nratio for Guideline's purposes only to one to one\nbetween crack and powder.\nAnd Congress, for the first time in the\nhistory of its review of Guidelines amendments, rejected\nthat proposal; and it did so with legislation that made\nclear that it believed that if the commission wanted to\ncome back with something new, it should propose\nsomething that would change both the Guidelines and the\nsentencing statutes so that they would continue to work\nin tandem -- that it would preserve a higher ratio of\npunishment for crack than powder because it believed\nthat crack was more serious, and that it believed that\nany ratio should apply consistently across the\nGuidelines and the statute.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And if -- you're\ntalking about Public Law 104-38?\nMR. DREEBEN: That's correct.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, they also\nsaid, quote, \"The sentence imposed for trafficking in\ncrack cocaine should generally exceed the sentence for\npowder cocaine.\"\nMR. DREEBEN: Correct.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's fine,\nbut that's pretty far from 100 to 1. \"Generally\nexceed,\" it suggests to me that Congress itself, in\nterms -- you are relying on this implicit directive from\nCongress. And that's the latest expression of\ncongressional implicit direction, and it just says\n\"generally exceed.\" So, you know, two to one.\nMR. DREEBEN: This, Mr. Chief Justice, is\nwhat Congress instructed the Commission to consider in\nmaking recommendations to change the existing state of\nthe law.\nWe don't dispute --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well I know, but you\nare relying on an implicit directive anyway. So as you\nare looking at that vague direction, it seems to me that\ntheir last expression on what they wanted the Commission\nto do is more probative than a much older pre-existing\n100 to 1 ratio.\nMR. DREEBEN: But they have never changed\nthe 100 to 1 ratio. And what I think is significant\nabout this statute is what it continues to say, and this\nis on page 124-A of the government's brief -- that \"the\nrecommendations concerning an appropriate change to the\nratio that the Commission might believe is warranted\nshall apply both to the relevant statutes and to the\nGuidelines.\" This is on the carryover sentence on pages\n24-A to 25-A.\nAnd what I think that this reflects is\nCongress' recognition that, so long as the mandatory\nminimum statutes are pegged at 100 to 1, the Guidelines\nneed to follow suit. Now if they're going to change,\nthat's fine. But they should change in a manner that's\nconsistent so as to avoid unwarranted disparities\nbetween defendants who are governed by the literal\nmandatory minimum statute and defendants who are not.\nThe alternative is you end up with various\nserious cliff effects which the Commission itself was\ntrying to avoid, where a defendant who has 50 grams of\ncrack is sentenced to a minimum of 10 years. But if you\ndrop the ratio to one to one, a defendant who has\n49.9 grams --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But those are the same\ncliff effects that are the product of Neal, precisely\nthe same.\nMR. DREEBEN: But this Court didn't consider\nwhether those cliff effects were legally valid in Neal\nbecause it had no guideline before it. And I did went\nto get to the other point that I think distinguishes the\nlegal context in Neal from the legal context today, and\nthat is, in 2003, Congress amended the organic statute\nthat governs the Sentencing Commission's promulgation of\nGuidelines to require that the commission make AUDIO\nSTARTS its Guidelines consistent with all pertinent\nprovisions of the United States Code.\nAt the time of Neal, that statute only\nrequired the commission to be consistent with Title 18\nand Title 28, and the drug statute is found in Title 21.\nAnd the legislative evolution of this provision reflects\nthat there was concern that the commission did not have\nto honor --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: In response to that\nstatute, did the commission revise the guideline that\nwas involved in Neal?\nMR. DREEBEN: It did not, and the government\n--\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Shouldn't it have done it?\nMR. DREEBEN: I think it should have, and I\nthink that the commission's decoupling of its guidelines\nfrom the mandatory minimums that Congress has provided\nproduces an irrational disconnect between guideline\nsentencing and sentencing --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, that's because of the\ncliff. But the cliff is undoubledly a negative, but the\ncliff is not as important as sometimes suggested, for\nthe numbers after all, which relate punishment to\namounts of drug, reflect, (a), more seriousness than\nwhat you have -- I mean more people likely to take it --\nbut also the role that the person is likely to play in\nthe organization, high or low, and the likelihood that\nhe is or this -- these groups of people are big deal\noffenders or not, and many other things.\nTherefore, a system that really is basically\nflat or only rises slowly until you get to the cliff,\nand then it again rises slowly to the next rise, is not\nan irrational system. It depends on what those other\ncorrelations are. I say that because suppose a judge,\nnoticing the horrendous effects of this -- that the\ncommission itself has listed and understanding that\ncliffs are not the end-all and the be-all of Guidelines\nthat are rough correlations, suppose a judge said: My\nsystem, which we have before us, which doesn't have the\nabsolute numerical progression, is far more reasonable\nthan the commission's system. There it is. He's\nreviewed the commission's policy.\nWell, Rita says sometimes courts could. And\nso what is the law that forbids the judge from doing\nthat, at least on occasion?\nMR. DREEBEN: Justice Breyer, as a general\nmatter, the government accepts that a sentencing judge\ncan revisit, challenge the Sentencing Commission's\npolicy determinations as an intrinsic feature of an\nadvisory guideline system. It's not because we welcome\nthat result, but because we think that it followed from\nthis Court's decision in Cunningham and that was\nexpressly stated in Rita.\nBut this is not an area where the sentencing\ncourts would be merely second-guessing a commission\njudgment. They would be second-guessing a judgment of\nCongress itself.\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, because Congress has\nnowhere said that you can't have cliffs.\nYou see, Congress could say, our rough\njudgment is that 5 Gs of hard -- of crack really is kind\nof a correlation with a medium-level gang, and 50 Gs is\nprobably a correlation with a fairly high-level gang.\nAnd what has Congress actually thought about this?\nNothing. They never thought about it.\nSo I can't find an instruction there that\ntells the commission that they can't do it this way.\nMR. DREEBEN: But, Justice Breyer, the one\ntime when the commission tried to do that --\nJUSTICE BREYER: They wanted to abolish the\nwhole thing.\nMR. DREEBEN: They wanted to make it one to\none, and Congress recognized that that would produce\nsevere cliffs and said not appropriate; if you want to\nchange the sentencing statutes and guidelines in tandem,\nthat's fine, make a recommendation. And so the\ngovernment's fundamental position here is that Congress\nhas made a judgment that until it says otherwise,\nsentencing ratios of 100 to 1 are appropriate to reflect\nthe increased harms of crack.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Isn't your answer also to\nJustice Breyer's question the post-Neal amendment to the\nstatute which in effect says, you know, make your\nGuidelines consistent with the statute?\nMR. DREEBEN: Yes, it --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Quite -- quite apart from\nthe specific rejection of the proposal they came up\nwith.\nMR. DREEBEN: The two of them work together\nin tandem, I think.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Why? Why? That's my\nquestion. Everyone's assuming that \"consistent with the\nstatute\" means a sentencing system that's smooth without\ncliffs. And I'm sure every mathematician would agree\nwith you, but I'm not at all certain that prosecutors\nand defendants who have actual experience in this would\nagree with you, because there are lots of arguments that\nit's perfectly consistent with the objective of the stat\ntute to have a few cliffs.\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, I think I want to rely\non what the Sentencing Commission itself did before it\nconcluded that it disagreed with the 100 to 1 ratio in\nthe statute. And this is set forward -- forth at page\n50A of the same brief, the Kimbrough brief. This was\nthe commission's original commentary where it explained,\nin the first full paragraph, how it set the basic levels\nfor drug crimes. And it said that it set them because\nthey were either provided directly by Section 841 of\nTitle 21 or, quote, \"are proportional to the levels\nestablished by statute,\" and it said, further refinement\nof the drug amounts beyond those mandatory minimums was\nessential to provide a logical sentencing structure for\ndrug offenses. And I think what the commission --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that's why -- and the\n1993 statute that you said, that you referred to, did\nindeed require the guidelines to track the -- the\nstatutory prescriptions for sentencing.\nMR. DREEBEN: 2003, I believe.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Pardon me?\nMR. DREEBEN: It's 2003.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: 2003. Sorry. I misspoke.\nBut -- but the fact remains that the\nGuidelines are only guidelines and that still doesn't--\ndoesn't convert to an obligation for the district courts\nto follow that scheme so long as that scheme is only\nreflected in the guidelines. The guidelines themselves\nare still just advisory.\nMR. DREEBEN: What distinguishes this area,\nJustice Scalia, I believe, from other guidelines is that\nthe backdrop for sentencing for drug crimes is a\nmandatory minimum statute that goes directly to the\nsentencing court. It's not subject to the commission's\nintervention and it's not subject to a district court's\npower to disagree with. The sentencing court must use a\n100 to 1 ratio in applying the mandatory minimums.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, why don't you just\nskip the Guidelines and say that the effect of the\nsentencing statute is to make it unreasonable for a\nsentencing judge -- never mind the Guidelines -- to do\nanything other than follow the 100 to 1 prescription\nthat Congress has established?\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, I'm happy to do just --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't know what the\nGuidelines add to -- to your game except another --\nanother stage.\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, if -- if it's sufficient\nfor the Court that Section 841 itself establishes the\n100 to 1 ratio and that's something that's off-limits\nfor the district courts to disagree with, I'm content.\nI think there is additional data that\nindicates that Congress vetoed attempts by the\nSentencing Commission to vary from that range and made\nit clear that the Guidelines formulations and the\nstatute worked in tandem, which together expresses a\nnotion of quantity proportionality tied to the 100 to 1\nratio.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I would say that that\nstatute reflects Congress's desire that sentencing,\nwhether it's through the commission or not, be based on\nthe 100 to 1 ratio.\nMR. DREEBEN: And I agree with that, Justice\nScalia. And the upshot of disagreeing with that, which\nis what various district courts have done but no court\nof appeals has endorsed, is that every district court\ncould come up with its own ratio and that that ratio\nwould have to be accepted as reasonable so long as there\nis a cogent, logical data support for it. And here --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But is it not true that\nthat only affects about 20 percent of the crack cocaine\ncases, because they say -- maybe I'm wrong on this --\nthat 80 percent of the sentences are actually fixed by\nthe mandatory minimum?\nMR. DREEBEN: There's a floor in the\nmandatory minimum, but I think that there are quite a\nfew sentences that are above the mandatory minimum and\nthere are sentences that are below the mandatory\nminimum. And in those cases --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I was -- and correct me if\nI'm wrong. I was under the impression that 80 percent\nof the sentences that are actually imposed are at the\nmandatory minimum.\nMR. DREEBEN: I didn't get that out of my\nattempt to plumb the data, Justice Stevens. The\nSentencing Commission's most recent report has a chart\nthat didn't, to my mind, break down adequately the\nfigures so I could answer your question.\nBut I do think that, even if it's true, even\nif 80 percent were at the mandatory minimum, that would\nmean that as to those 20 percent that are not governed\nby a mandatory minimum, you could have one district\njudge say, I'm going to use one to one, like the\ncommission proposed in 1995. Another could say I'm\ngoing to use five to one, like the commission proposed\nin 1997. A third could use 20 to 1, as the commission\nproposed in 2002. And each one of those would have a\nreasonable --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Isn't this another\nalternative? If the district judge concluded, as some\nscholars have, that the 100 to 1 ratio itself creates\nunwarranted disparities, could not a district judge\nsentence by just disregarding the guideline for this\nparticular substance? And then use just ordinary\nprinciples, what's appropriate sentencing in this case.\nMR. DREEBEN: I don't think so, because I\nthink here we're talking about a matter of statutory\nconstruction. Because the courts of appeals are\nreviewing sentences for reasonableness.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: You have a conflict in the\nstatute. One says await the guideline. Another says\navoid unwarranted disparities.\nMR. DREEBEN: That wasn't the two statutes I\nwas thinking of. What I was thinking of is that\nCongress itself has said a 100 to 1 disparity --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, Mr. Dreeben,\nyour office used to argue that when Congress wants to do\nsomething, there's a way to do it. They pass a law\nthrough both houses, then the President signs it.\nThat's the only way they can give legal effect to their\nintent.\nNow you are arguing that there's some\nbinding intent simply because they set mandatory\nminimums and mandatory maximums that carry beyond that.\nI'm wondering how that's consistent with the positions\nthe office has taken before.\nMR. DREEBEN: Our position here, I think, is\nconsistent with our view that you read statutes both for\nwhat they say and for what they mean. And here we are\nnot relying just on Section 841, although I'm certainly\nhappy if members of the Court believe that 841 alone\ndictates a proportionality rule, I'm also relying on the\nfact that Congress vetoed the Commission's attempt to\nbreak apart the Guidelines in the sentencing --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We should read a\nnegative pregnant in the Congress' vetoing of what the\nCommission wanted to do?\nMR. DREEBEN: At least the Court should do\nthis much, that when a court of appeals is reviewing for\nreasonableness a sentence imposed by a district judge,\nthe court of appeals should refract the Section 3553(a)\nfactors through Congress' existing judgment that a 100\nto 1 ratio is warranted.\nJUSTICE BREYER: If Congress passes a\nstatute that says the mandatory minimum sentence of\neight years for possessing a 12-inch shotgun unlawfully,\ndoes that mean it wants four years for a 6-inch shotgun?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. DREEBEN: It doesn't. But, Justice\nBreyer, that's, for two different reasons, not an apt\nanalogy for this. First of all, Congress applied the\n100 to 1 ratio at two different points in the sentencing\nspectrum.\nThen if there was a rational basis for\nviewing shotgun culpability as turning on the length of\nthe barrel, then perhaps there would be a better\nanalogy. But I think here what Congress was focused on\nwas the relative culpability of crack offenders and\npowder offenders.\nJUSTICE BREYER: At the cliff. But, of\ncourse, I've been through -- I hope not being hypnotized\nby numbers myself -- that these numbers reflect\nunderlying realities that are far closer to the shotgun\ncase than you are prepared to admit.\nMR. DREEBEN: No, but I think that Congress\ndoesn't view the Guidelines quantity determinations as\nbeing independent from its mandatory minimum\ndeterminations. And that's why it vetoed the\nCommission's unilateral attempt to impose a one to one\nratio --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And then are you saying\nthat either the guidelines are out of it and the statute\ncontrols, the ratio is a 100 to 1, or that Congress has,\nin effect, made a particular guideline, the one setting\nthe drug quantity, made that mandatory? That\nguideline -- I mean, it sounds to me that if you must\nadhere to the 100 to 1, then that's a mandatory\nguideline.\nMR. DREEBEN: They do come down to the same\nthing, Justice Ginsburg, in the sense that the guideline\nas it exists today incorporates the 100 to 1 ratio. And\nI believe that Congress well understood that it was\npreserving a guideline that maintains fidelity and\nconsistency with its sentencing statute while sending\nthe Commission back to the drawing board and saying if\nwe're going to change this scheme, let's change it in a\nconsistent coherent way. And every district court does\nnot get the power to say we're going to change what\nCongress has prohibited the Commission from changing,\neven though we can't change the mandatory minimum\nstatute.\nThat is Congress' sentencing policy. We\nhave to impose that in cases at the mandatory minimum.\nBut in cases that aren't at the mandatory minimum, the\nposition of the petitioner is basically district judges\ncan say to Congress, you're completely wrong. And our\nposition is that under a sympathetic attempt to\nconstruct reasonableness review that is consistent with\nCongressional intent, a district court can't do that.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why doesn't\nCongress -- why didn't Congress, in fact, do what you\nsay they implicitly did explicitly? They could impose\nthe 100 to 1 ratio throughout as opposed to simply as a\nminimum and a maximum. And they did not do that.\nMR. DREEBEN: Because they had no reason to\ndo it. Until this Court decided Booker, the Guidelines\nwere mandatory. And they fully understood by leaving in\nplace a crack guideline that mirrored the statutory --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Congress has legislated in\nthis area after Booker. They have not imposed the 100\nto 1 ratio throughout the -- other than as a mandatory\nminimum and maximum.\nMR. DREEBEN: I'm not aware that they have\nlegislated in this area after Booker, Mr. Chief Justice.\nAnd I think that since all the court of appeals have\nagreed with the single position that district courts are\nnot free to substitute their own ratios for the 100 to 1\nratio, Congress would not have had a great deal of\nreason to intervene in this area.\nAnd what this case will tell Congress and\nsentencing courts is within an advisory guidelines\nregime, can Congress make certain policy judgments and\nplace certain limits on what a district court can do\nthat it otherwise would have freedom to do in an\nadvisory range.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But that, as you say, in\neffect, makes a certain element mandatory. And why\ndoesn't that come up against the same Sixth Amendment\njudgement that we made in Booker?\nMR. DREEBEN: The only requirement, I\nbelieve, that exists under Booker is that judge not in\nall cases be required to find a fact in order to exceed\nthe guidelines range that would be based on the jury\nverdict alone or the admission of guilt alone.\nBooker did not say that Congress had to\ntolerate every single policy judgment that individual\ndistrict courts might make to vary upward. For example,\nsocioeconomic status. If a particular judge felt in my\ncourtroom college students and white collar\nprofessionals deserve an automatic bump up in their\nsentences above what I would give anyone else because\nthey betrayed the advantages that they have, I think\nCongress could come along and say that's not right. We\ndon't want socioeconomic status to be a variable that\naffects how long someone goes to prison.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It seems to me that the gap\nin your argument is that whatever Congress legislated,\nit did not legislate the manner in which you transferred\nthis 100 to 1 ratio onto the sentencing chart.\nAnd as your opponent points out, it isn't\ndone proportionally. It could have been done in a lot\nof different ways.\nMR. DREEBEN: It is done in a logically\nproportional manner --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Maybe. But there are other\nlogically proportional manners of doing it. Why would\nthe district court be bound to the particular one that\nthe Sentencing Commission chose?\nMR. DREEBEN: The Sentencing Commission at\nleast started where Congress did.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's fine. I'm granting\nthat they got a start where Congress did. I'm assuming\nthat. But why do they have to follow it through the way\nthe Sentencing Guidelines did?\nMR. DREEBEN: I don't think they do have to\nfollow it through exactly the way the Sentencing\nCommission did it, because they don't -- sentencing\ncourts today which are sentencing under advisory\nguidelines need not use exactly the same base offense\nlevels when they come down to final sentences after\nthey've considered what the Commission has done. But\nwhat they cannot do, I submit -- and it is more of a\nnegative -- they cannot say fundamentally the Commission\nhas pointed this out and Congress has enacted, but the\ncrack and powder guidelines are way out of whack. I\nthink that they're wrong.\nI think Congress was wrong. And I'm going\nto do everything I can to try to eliminate that degree\nof disparity. And I may not be able to do everything I\nwant to. This judge here was limited by the 120 months\nthat was the mandatory minimum. But essentially, he, as\nI read the sentencing transcript, thought it was crazy\nfor Congress to treat crack and powder differently. For\na judge to say Congress is crazy, I think, is a sort of\ntextbook example of an unreasonable sentencing factor.\nThe ultimate sentence will turn on how the\njudge applies all of the facts of the case to the\nparticular --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Is it not a fact that this\nguideline is also unique in that it was not based on a\nhistory of other similar crimes like all the other --\nmost of the guidelines were? There's no expert\ninterpretation of the history of sentencing in this\nparticular area?\nMR. DREEBEN: True. But this is an area\nwhere I don't think Congress chose to rely on the\nadministrative expertise of the commission. It made its\nown policy judgment on crack.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I understand. This\nguideline is pretty much unique in that regard. It is\nnot based on experience in sentencing in comparable\ncases.\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, the drug guideline was\nbased on --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: The 100 to 1 ratio is not\nbased on history?\nMR. DREEBEN: No. But entire drug --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Therefore, none of the\nsentencing guidelines relating to crack are based on\nhistory.\nMR. DREEBEN: They are based on the fact\nthat Congress made a supervening policy judgment. And\nin our system, the policy judgments ultimately\npertaining to sentencing belong to Congress.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: So there is really an\nentirely different rationale for defending these\nguidelines than any other guidelines in the system?\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, there are some other\nguidelines where Congress has directly intervened, but\nmy fundamental point here is that so long as Congress\nhas made a determination that it has not changed, that\nit wants 100 to 1 as a mandatory minimum set point,\ndistrict courts should not be free to say I think\nCongress got it wrong, I'm going to sentence on a\ndifferent paradigm. The Commission didn't think that\nwas appropriate when it promulgated the original drug\nguideline, which is why that guideline is not based on\nthe same sorts of empirical data that other guidelines\nmight be deemed to be responsive to. But that only\nreflected that the Commission in its original guideline\nrespected that its role was to carry out congressional\npolicy, not to disagree with or supplant congressional\npolicy, and so long as the Commission was operating in\nthat vein -- which I think was correct -- it follows a\nfortiori that sentencing courts should do the same\nthing.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Does the Guidelines\nsupersede the parsimony provision, because the parsimony\nprovision is general and the Guidelines -- the ratio is\nspecific?\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, I would put it\ndifferently, Justice Kennedy. I would say that Congress\nhas made a legislative judgment that for crack purposes,\nthis ratio is what is needed to have a sufficient\nsentence, and the Congress that decided that might be\nwrong. And if the present-day Congress decides to\nchange that, a new policy will be established, but I\nthink that reading the two statutes together, Section\n3553(a) and Section 841, produces the conclusion that\nthis is a legislative judgment of reasonableness; and\neven if every judge in the Federal system holds a\ndifferent personal view, that doesn't mean that the\nstatute has validated their position over the one that\nCongress expressed in Title 21, in a manner that binds\nsentencing courts irrespective of how the Commission\nsorts out its policy judgments.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose experience shows\nthat the ratio is not consistent with the parsimony\nprovision -- we find that over a course of time?\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, I don't think that the\nCourt can interpret Congress in Section 3553(a) to make\nunreasonable what Congress did in Section 841. I think\nreading all of the statutes together would produce the\nconclusion that Congress deemed that this was the way to\nachieve the purposes of sentencing.\nCrack is more corrosive in the inner cities.\nIt has different kinds of problems than powder. They\nshould be addressed in this more severe sentencing\nmanner, and if that's a policy judgment that warrants\nbeing revisited, the appropriate body to do it is\nCongress, not each individual sentencing judge,\nformulating his or her own ratio, subject to blanket\naffirmance by the court of appeals.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Dreeben.\nMr. Nachmanoff, you have three minutes\nremaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT BY MICHAEL S. NACHMANOFF\nON BEHALF OF PETITIONER\nMR. NACHMANOFF: Thank you, Mr. Chief\nJustice.\nIf I can respond, Justice Stevens, I think\n-- you asked about the percentage of cases in crack that\nare at the mandatory minimum or near it. I would point\nthe Court to page 33, footnote 10 of our opening brief.\nIt is approximately 70 percent or just over that that\nhit at the mandatory minimum or just one or two levels\nabove that.\nSo the large majority of cases involving\ncrack cocaine end up being subjected to the mandatory\nminimum.\nWith regard to the Government's argument\nregarding Section 994(a) and the fact that direction was\ngiven to the Commission to be consistent with pertinent\nstatutes, of course, that's reflected in Section 5(g)\nwhich says that mandatory minimums trump the Guidelines,\nand the Commission recognizes that and of course\nsentencing judges recognize that, and Judge Jackson\nrecognized it here.\nTo suggest that Judge Jackson concluded that\nCongress was crazy, I think is unfair. What Judge\nJackson did was, in a very reasoned opinion, explained\nthat the information from the Sentencing Commission,\nwhich has been persuasive not just to Judge Jackson, but\nto judges across the country and to many others, was\nthat the 100 to 1 ratio overstates the seriousness of\nthe offense, and he understood that Congress had spoken\nclearly with regard to mandatory minimums, and he\nhonored them.\nFinally, Mr. Chief Justice, you point out\nthe heart of the problem with the Government's case.\nCongress has not spoken explicitly in the way the\nGovernment suggests. They are --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But I was wrong that\nthey legislated after Booker.\nMR. NACHMANOFF: Well, Your Honor, Congress\nhas failed completely to address this particular\nproblem, and they have understood since Booker that if\nthey wanted to address the issue of the discretion that\nsentencing courts must have with regard to the advisory\nguidelines, they have a way of fixing the problem. They\ncan change the statute. And so long as they then\nrequire the Government to include in the indictment and\nprove to the jury beyond a reasonable doubt the specific\ndrug type and drug quantity over and above the current\nmandatory minimum and maximums, they're free to do that,\nand there would no Sixth Amendment problem and there\nwould no problem with the advisory guidelines.\nIn other words, right now, the Government\nsimply alleges that a person engaged in the distribution\nof either 5 grams or 50 grams of crack cocaine -- that's\nwhat they have to do to meet the thresholds for the\n5-year and the 10-year mandatory minimums -- in\nvirtually every case the Government will present\nevidence or a court will find under relevant conduct\nthat there was some greater quantity. And if the\nGovernment's theory were to be accepted, those\nguidelines would be mandatory, and it would be in direct\nconflict with the remedial holding in Booker to require\ncourts to adhere to that, absent the procedural\nprotections which are not currently in place.\nJudge Jackson did it right in this case. He\nimposed a sentence consistent with the parsimony\nprovision and the purposes of sentencing and all of the\nfactors in 3553(a).\nHe imposed a long sentence, 15 years, but he\nhonored Congress's explicit mandate, and we would ask\nthe Court to reverse the court of appeals and affirm the\ndistrict court.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.\n"
