Holder.\nMr. Srinivasan.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF SRI SRINIVASAN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Thank you,\nMr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:\nLong-time lawful permanent resident aliens\nwith two convictions for minor drug possession offenses\nare subject to removal from the United States, but they\nare not categorically ineligible to seek discretionary\nrelief from removal from the Attorney General based on\ntheir connections and deep family ties to the country.\nCategorical ineligibility for discretionary relief\narises under the Immigration and Nationality Act when a\npermanent resident has been, quote, \"convicted of an\naggravated felony,\" close quote, with the relevant\ncategory here permanent residents who have been, quote,\n\"convicted of a felony punishable under the Controlled\nSubstances Act,\" close quote.\nIndividuals, such as Petitioner, who have\nbeen convicted of drug possession, but as to whom there\nhas been no finding of recidivism, have been convicted\nof a misdemeanor punishable under the Controlled\nSubstances Act rather than a felony.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Srinivasan, as a\nthreshold question, is there a mootness problem here,\nbecause, as I understand it, the Petitioner came back to\nthe country illegally and committed another minor crime?\nBut his coming back illegally and being turned away\nagain, as I understand the law, means that he cannot get\nany dispensation as a result of the illegal entry.\nSo even if we were to hold in your favor\nnow, I take it that he could not -- he would not have\nany hope of getting any cancellation of removal or any\nother dispensation. Is that so?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: That's not correct,\nJustice Ginsburg, in our view. And the government, it's\nnotable, doesn't make a mootness argument. And I think the\nreason they don't is that the -- in Lopez, this Court\nunderstood that the initial removal doesn't annul the\nability of an individual to get cancellation. And so,\nas Your Honor correctly observes, the question would be\nwhether the reentry has an effect on the cancellation\nand the eligibility for cancellation. And it does not\nbecause Petitioner was removed again by reinstatement of\nthe original removal order. And so, if there's an\nargument that the initial removal order wasn't good\nbecause cancellation should have been granted, that also\ncarries through to the reinstatement.\nAnd as a consequence of that procedural\ncontext, there is no mootness argument and I think\nthat's why the government doesn't make -- doesn't take\nthat position.\nSo the question before the Court --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I -- I -- I'm not sure I\nunderstand what you're saying. You're saying that his\nreentry was not illegal because his removal was illegal?\nIs that what you are saying?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: No, it's not that his\nreentry wasn't illegal. It's that when he was then\nagain removed, that the -- the way that that was\naccomplished was by reinstatement of the original\nremoval order.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I see.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: And so, if the original\nremoval order would have been extinguished by a grant of\nthe cancellation order, then that carries forward to the\nreinstatement of the original removal -- removal order\nas well.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But -- but does --\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Nothing additional happens\nbecause of the reentry.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But does it make the --\nthe second unlawful entry now lawful?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: It doesn't make the --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I thought -- I thought\nit's a separate offense to enter, to reenter improperly,\nand -- and that stays no matter, isn't that correct,\nregardless of the correctness of the prior removal\norder?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: It does, Justice Kennedy --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Or am I wrong?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: -- but I think -- I think\nthe way that gets taken into account is it would be one\nof the discretionary considerations that the Attorney\nGeneral could take into account in determining whether\nto grant discretionary relief in the same way that the\noriginal conviction for drug possession could be taken\ninto account. Our position --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I -- I -- I think also in\nthe picture is that he never contested removability.\nThe only thing was the grace: Would -- would he qualify\nfor discretionary relief by the Attorney General? So\nthe -- the removal order itself, I take it, would stand.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: The removal order would\nstand, but if cancellation were granted, then he\ncouldn't be removed pursuant to that removal order,\nbecause the -- the effect of granting cancellation would\nbe that he's no longer removable. He gets favorable\ndiscretionary relief that enables him to stay in the\ncountry. And I think the predicate of Your Honor's\nquestion is correct, that we don't contest removability.\nHe was removable because of his drug possession -- drug\npossession conviction.\nThe question is whether he retains\neligibility to seek a favorable exercise of relief from\nthe Attorney General based on affirmative equities in\nhis -- in his favor, such as his deep family ties to the\ncountry, the presence of United States citizen children\nhere, his lack of connections to the country to which he\nwould be removed, his employment history, and\nconsiderations of that variety.\nAnd the question before the Court is whether\nhe and other individuals who are similarly situated\nshould have an opportunity to make that case to the\nAttorney General. He is removable. The question is\nwhether the Attorney General is in a -- is in a position\nto grant him a favorable exercise of discretion.\nAnd we think the Attorney General is,\nbecause in order to be categorically ineligible for\ndiscretionary relief from removal, a permanent resident\nalien has to have been convicted of a felony punishable\nunder the Controlled Substances Act. And when you've\nbeen convicted of drug possession and there has been no\nfinding of recidivism, you have been convicted of a\nmisdemeanor punishable under the Controlled Substances\nAct.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What elements would a\nState conviction have to contain to qualify as a finding\nof recidivism in your view?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: What elements?\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Yes. What would have\nhad to have been determined in a State conviction for\nyou to recognize, under your argument, that it would\nqualify as a felony under the Controlled Substances Act?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Justice Sotomayor, at the\nvery least what would have had to have happened is that\nhe would have had to have been found to be a recidivist\nunder a State provision that attaches sentencing\nconsequences to being found to have been a recidivist.\nAnd so, what you need is an analogous State\noffense to the Federal offense of recidivist possession.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Do you know of any State\nlaw that is analogous to the Federal law, precisely\nanalogous?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Well, analogous enough to\ncount, in the sense that what you need under the Federal\nlaw is a finding of recidivism at least. That's our\nprincipal submission.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's what I'm trying\nto -- to get to. What are the elements of that finding?\nWhat exactly -- because different labels are attached to\ndifferent crimes that qualify you for recidivism under\nsome State statutes, et cetera. I'm trying to get you\nto articulate what finding of recidivism counts, what\nare the underlying --\nMR. SRINIVASAN: It's a determination by the\ncourt that --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Which court now, the\nState court?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: By the State convicting\ncourt. In the case of a State conviction, it would be a\ndetermination by the State convicting court that the\nperson in fact has a prior conviction. And then as a\nconsequence under the State scheme, a sentencing\nconsequence would attach.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So are you arguing that\na State court has to make a finding of a valid prior\nconviction; is that it?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Yes, in -- in the context\nof a State conviction. It --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But it doesn't have to be a\nState felony?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: It doesn't have to be a\nState felony, no.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The felony has to be a\nFederal felony, right?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: That's correct. And that's\nthe work done by the words \"punishable under the\nControlled Substances Act.\"\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Punishable as a felony\nunder the Federal Act.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Right.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But this was punishable as\na felony because it was his second drug offense. He was\na recidivist. And although it was only a misdemeanor\nunder State law, under the Controlled Substances Act he\ncould be prosecuted for a felony, for a Federal felony.\nI -- I -- I don't know why that doesn't fit the statute.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: But -- but, Justice Scalia,\nhe has to have been convicted of the felony. That's\nthe critical distinction. He may have committed a\nfelony --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: He can't be convicted of a\nFederal felony in a State court. He has to be convicted\nof a crime --\nMR. SRINIVASAN: He has to have been\nconvicted of a crime --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- which may be a misdemeanor,\nwhich would subject him to a felony conviction in\nFederal court under the Controlled Substances Act. And\nI think that's - that's what this is. He's convicted of\na drug offense, and if - if he were prosecuted in Federal\ncourt, he would -- he was punishable as a felon --\nMR. SRINIVASAN: He was --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- in Federal court under\nthe -- under the Controlled Substances Act.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: He was not punishable as a\nfelon in Federal court for two reasons: First, he was\nconvicted of drug possession. A person in Federal court\nwho is convicted of drug possession is a misdemeanant,\nnot a felon, unless and until there's a finding that\nhe's a recidivist. You have to have the finding of\nrecidivist in order for a felony sentence even to\nconceivably attach to an individual, and you just don't\nhave that in the context of this case, where all you\nhave is a conviction of drug possession alone. A felony\nsentence doesn't even come into the picture unless there's\na finding of recidivism.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Isn't the --\nMR. SRINIVASAN: That didn't happen in the\nState court.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Isn't the crux of your argument\nthat for present purposes the term \"conviction\" must\ninclude a determination of recidivism?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: For present purposes,\nthat's correct. And Justice Alito, I think it's\nimportant to understand -- and this goes to the second\nresponse to your question, Justice Scalia -- that the\nstatute, the Immigration and Nationality Act, defines\n\"conviction\" in a particular way. It defines\n\"conviction\" as \"a formal judgment of guilt ... entered by\na court.\"\nAs Your Honor's opinion for the Court in\nDeal v. United States understood, statutes could define\nconvictions in one of two ways: It could define a\nconviction as a finding of guilty, or it could define a\nconviction as the formal judgment based on that finding.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, what would you say --\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Here we have the latter.\nJUSTICE ALITO: What do you say about\n21 U.S.C. section 851, the Federal recidivism provision,\nwhich says: \"No person who stands convicted of an offense\nunder this part shall be sentenced to increased punishment\nby reason of one or more prior convictions.\"\nSo under that statute, the conviction does not\ninclude the recidivism determination.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Under --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Isn't that right?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Under that statute --\ndifferent statutes conceive of it different ways, but\nthe applicable definition of \"conviction\" here, because\nwe're talking about an immigration consequence, is\nthe definition of \"conviction\" under the Immigration and\nNationality Act. And that definition is set forth at\npage 2a of the appendix to our brief, the blue brief,\nthe opening brief. And it's 8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(48)(A),\nand it says that: \"The term 'conviction' means, with\nrespect to an alien, a formal judgment of guilt of the\nalien entered by a court.\"\nAnd so, here you have \"a formal judgment of\nguilt\" as the operative definition of a conviction, and\nthat formal judgment of guilt includes both the\nadjudication of guilt and the sentence. And so the\nimportant point to bear in mind is that at the time that\nthe conviction, as defined by the Immigration and\nNationality Act, is entered, we know whether the person\nhas been found to have been a recidivist. At that point,\nthe adjudication of guilt has happened, the sentence has\nbeen imposed, and we know whether a finding of recidivism\nhas been made. In the absence of such a finding, the\nmaximum sentence they could attach under Federal law,\nJustice Scalia, is a misdemeanor sentence of 1 year of\nimprisonment.\nA felony sentence is not on the table, and\nif the maximum sentence to which a person is subject is\na misdemeanor sentence, the person has been -- has been\nconvicted of a misdemeanor; they haven't been convicted\nof a felony. And that --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Let's assume we're not\ntalking about immigration consequences. Let's -- let's\nassume we're talking about an American citizen who has\ncommitted a -- a misdemeanor drug offense. When he is\nbrought up under the Controlled Substances Act, even\nthough he wasn't found to have been a recidivist by the\nState conviction, couldn't he be prosecuted under the\nControlled Substances Act for a felony because in fact\nhe is a recidivist?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Oh, sure. But -- but I\nthink -- I think that confuses two things. In that\nsituation, the second proceeding is in Federal court --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: -- and in that Federal court\nproceeding, you can take account of the prior State court\nconviction, but in that second proceeding, the fact that\nhe was convicted previously in State court would have to\nhave been found by the Federal court. That's the relevant\nfinding of recidivism, and in the absence of that finding of\nrecidivism, the Federal defendant wouldn't be subject to\na felony sentence. He would only be subject to a\nmisdemeanor sentence.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No, but -- the crucial word\nhere is \"punishable\" as a felony under the Controlled\nSubstances Act. And the fact is if indeed he's a\nrecidivist, he could be punished for the -- for the\nfelony. Now, you're quite correct that the Federal\ncourt would have to find the recidivism, but -- but\nstill he would be punishable as a recidivist.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: He has to be convicted of a\nfelony, Justice Scalia, and in the absence of a finding\nof recidivism, he can't have been convicted of the\nfelony. He may be punishable as a felon in the abstract\nex ante. So I don't take issue with the proposition\nthat a person commits recidivist possession when they\ncommit possession and they have a prior conviction. In\nthat abstract sense, the person has committed recidivist\npossession, and if they were charged and found to have\nbeen a recidivist, they would be convicted of recidivist\npossession. But in the absence of that finding, they\nhaven't been convicted of recidivist possession, and --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Under the applicable\nState law, what's required before the recidivist\nsentence is triggered? Is it a formal finding of\nrecidivism by the -- by a jury?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: It doesn't have to be by a\njury, and I think it would depend on the State,\nMr. Chief Justice. It doesn't necessarily have to be by\na jury, because I think several States have the\nrecidivism component of the offense as a finding that\ncould be made by the court, but the --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And we've held that's\nokay --\nMR. SRINIVASAN: And you've held --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- that you don't need a jury.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: -- that's okay as a\nconstitutional matter. But --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But we have five States,\nisn't it, that have no recidivist provisions?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: There are --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Is the thrust of your\nargument or the logical consequence of your argument, if\nyou have one of those States with no recidivist\nprovisions and you have ten separate possession\nconvictions, they're still not a recidivist under the\nFederal rules?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: It is in those five States,\nJustice Kennedy, but I don't think that should give the\nCourt a great deal of pause, for the following two\nreasons.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: No, no. In my\nhypothetical, what would happen if -- if there was a\ndeportation proceeding?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: What would happen is this:\nThe person would not be categorically ineligible for\ndiscretionary relief.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Because there is no\nrecidivist finding.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: They wouldn't have been\nconvicted of recidivist possession. But it's important\nto note, Justice Kennedy, that doesn't mean that those\nprior convictions don't enter into the picture at all.\nThey do, because, in the exercise of discretion by the\nAttorney General, the Attorney General can take into\naccount any prior convictions, including those that\ndon't render somebody categorically ineligible.\nAll we're talking about here is whether the\nperson has a chance to make a discretionary case. They\ndo have that chance in Your Honor's hypothetical, but\nthose convictions would be taken into account.\nNow, I want to point out, though, that there's\nanother reason that I think the fact that in that\nhypothetical it wouldn't render the defendant\ncategorically ineligible for discretionary relief\nshouldn't give the Court a great deal of pause. And\nthat's because the relevant category of aggravated\nfelony that we're talking about here is illicit\ntrafficking in a controlled substance. That's the\ncategory that's outlined by the statute.\nNow, with respect to that category, every\nState has trafficking laws. Every State punishes drug\ntrafficking. So every State's offenses do count for\npurposes of this category of aggravated felony. When\nwe're -- that's the iceberg. The tip of the iceberg is\nrecidivist possession, which is a subset of illicit\ntrafficking in a controlled substance. Now, with respect\nto that tip, Federal convictions for recidivist possession\nstill do count, so we have those. With respect to the State --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, but the State\nprosecutors often prosecute when they have a recidivist\nprovision under that, rather than the much more difficult\nillicit trafficking crime. I mean, if you're going to\ngo to jail for a certain amount of years for a\nrecidivist possession, that's easier to show than illicit\ntrafficking.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Well, sure, but if a\nState -- two responses, Mr. Chief Justice: If a State\nprosecutor does prosecute under an available recidivist\npossession offense, then that would count because the\nState prosecutor would have brought the charge, the\nfinding by hypothesis would have been made. That would\nbe felony recidivist possession under Federal law, and\nthere would be categorical ineligibility.\nNow, I think what may be -- what may be sort\nof lurking beneath Your Honor's question is the\nrecognition that the Federal consequences of a State\nconviction are going to turn on State prosecutorial\ndecisions. That's true. But that's a fixed feature of\nany scheme in which Federal immigration consequences\nturns on what happens in State court, and this Court's\ndecision in Lopez recognizes that.\nFor example, States -- several States don't\nhave a Federal offense of possession with intent to\ndistribute drugs. That's a Federal offense. What\nStates, some States, have instead is possession with a\ndegree of penalty attached to the amount of drugs\npossessed. They don't have the separate offense of\npossession with intent to distribute.\nNow, the fact that certain States don't have\nthat offense doesn't mean that an individual who is\nconvicted of state possession with no finding of an\nintent to distribute would be categorically ineligible\nfor discretionary relief from removal, because what\nCongress understood was that some States will have\nqualifying offenses and some States won't. In those\nStates that do, where the State has the offense and\nwhere the State prosecutor makes the decision to charge\nunder that offense will -- at that point the State\nconviction will count as a Federal felony. It will be a\nfelony punishable under the Controlled Substances Act,\nand the person at that point would be categorically\nineligible for discretionary relief.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I don't know. It seems to\nme you go further than you need to and, moreover,\nimagine a State offense that just says possession of\nmarijuana, zero to 5 years. Now, our problem is,\nreading those words, is that or is that not analogous to\na Federal -- a Federal -- what a Federal law would make\na felony? And suppose you discovered as a matter of\nfact that all the people who did have a prior conviction\ngot more than a year. In simple possession, they got\nless than a year, which you'd have to do research to\nfind out.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, if those were the\nfacts, I would say it is analogous to the Federal\nfelony where this person was sentenced to more than a\nyear.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: I don't think it would be,\nJustice Breyer, because --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, we could argue that\none --\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Sure.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- but I don't see where --\nthat there's a line, because it seems to me the rule is\nset forth -- we said in the last sentence here of --\nwhat's the case? You know --\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Lopez?\nJUSTICE BREYER: What?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Is it Lopez? Is that --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes, Lopez. It says: \"A\nstate offense constitutes a `felony punishable under the\nControlled Substances Act' only if it proscribes\nconduct.\" So we're not looking at what happened in\nreality. We're reading some words from a State\nstatute.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Correct.\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's what proscribes\nconduct punishable as a felony under that Federal law.\nThis would be normal. We get some words in the State\nstatute, and you have to decide are the -- those\nwords cover some events in the world. And you look at\nthose words, what -- the events they cover and discover,\ndid they or are they analogous or not analogous to what\nis a felony under Federal law? Sometimes that's easy,\nsometimes it's not.\nYou have a case, I think, that's easy. But\nI can imagine the case you're talking about, not easy.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Well, I --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So you say, what do you do?\nI see no rule there. I see no rule absolute how you treat\nit, so I probably would treat it by trying to look at what\nreally happens under this statute in the world.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Well -- well, with respect,\nJustice Breyer, I don't think that's the inquiry that's\ncalled for even by this sentence. I think what this\nsentence called for is an inquiry into what the State\noffense captures in its offense elements to make up a\nconviction.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Why -- where does it say\n\"offense element\"?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Because I think that's\nthe -- the necessary inquiry that's --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Where does it say that?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: It's -- it's necessarily\nwhat's at issue. It --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Why?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: This sentence doesn't\nnecessarily -- it asks whether --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, where in the statute --\nMR. SRINIVASAN: It asks whether it proscribes\nconduct.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- does it say \"offense elements\"?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: It asks whether -- the\nsentence asks whether the State offense proscribes\nconduct.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: And I read \"proscribes\nconduct\" to mean there would be offense elements\nof proscribed conduct.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, you say that it says\n\"elements.\" I don't see any of our cases that say\n\"elements.\" And I -- and I think that -- that what we\ncould do is look to the conduct that's likely to be at\nissue under these State words, and if in fact it's\nregular that the State does punish people for more than\na year when in fact they do possess for the third time,\nat least there would be a good argument --\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Justice Breyer --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- that that counts. You\nwant to argue it doesn't count, okay. I don't know why\nyou do.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: No --\nJUSTICE BREYER: But, I mean, I'm interested in\nwhy you do, since that isn't your case.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Yes, I don't want to take\nissue -- I don't want to argue against myself,\ncertainly, but I would just make the following point:\nThat if I'm understanding what Your Honor is saying\ncorrectly, and I'm not sure that I am, but if I'm\nunderstanding what you're saying correctly, I would just\npoint out to the Court that the Court dealt with that\nsort of situation in the four corners of Lopez itself\nwhen it talked about -- talks about what happens with\npossession with intent to distribute.\nSome States don't have possession with\nintent to distribute as an offense; they only have\npossession. Now, I -- as I understand what Your Honor\nis suggesting, you could look at all the -- the ken of\nindividuals who have been convicted of State possession\nand you could ask as a matter of fact, do they in fact\npossess with intent to distribute? And then you could\nreach some consequence on that basis.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I know, but the reason I\nask my question is it seems to me your approach, which I\nthink is consistent with Lopez and Nijhawan\nabsolutely --\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Okay.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- does raise the question\nyou are talking about. So I want to know: Why are you\ntalking about it? Because I might be missing something,\nbecause I don't think -- if I'm right, your case doesn't\nraise these issues. Or am I wrong about that?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: I -- I have to confess, I'm\nnot exactly sure what Your Honor is asking. So --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay. Well, skip the\nquestion.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. SRINIVASAN: I think --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Could I ask you this\nquestion --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could I --\nJUSTICE ALITO: If -- suppose a State makes simple\npossession a felony. Now, that doesn't make it a felony\nfor these purposes, right?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Right.\nJUSTICE ALITO: All right. But in\nsentencing the -- the defendant in State court for this\nfelony, the -- the defendant concedes that he had a\nprior conviction, and the judge finds that and takes that\ninto account in imposing the sentence. What would\nhappen there?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: It wouldn't constitute the\nanalogy to the Federal offense of recidivist possession,\nJustice -- Justice Alito, because that could also happen\nin the Federal system. In the Federal system, you could\nhave an individual who is convicted of possession, and\nthen the fact that they had a prior conviction could\nhave some role in the -- for example, in the\npresentencing report.\nJUSTICE ALITO: But what's missing there?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: You don't have --\nJUSTICE ALITO: What is the difference\nbetween that and -- and a situation where, just because\nof the vagary of State law, recidivism is something that\nhas to be proven in order to bring the offense into the\n-- into the felony level?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Two things are\nmissing, Justice Alito: First, you don't have a formal\njudgment of guilt entered by the court, which is what\na conviction requires. And the consequence of not\nhaving a formal judgment of guilt is that the statutory\nmaximum penalty isn't raised. And I think what's\nrelevant here is that when you have a finding of -- a\nformal judgment of guilt of recidivism in the Federal\nsystem, which happens when the prosecutor brings a\ncharge and the court makes the finding at sentencing,\nthe maximum sentence that could be imposed against the\ndefendant is raised from a misdemeanor sentence to a\nfelony sentence.\nBut that doesn't happen in a situation in\nwhich the fact of a prior conviction is taken into\naccount, for example, under a presentencing report. It\ndoesn't raise the statutory maximum, and there's no\nformal judgment entered based on that determination by\nthe court. And so that's the distinction.\nAnd I think the relevant way to look at it\nis you take account of what would happen in the Federal\nsystem and you ask: Would it have the consequence in\nthe Federal system of rendering somebody guilty of the\nfelony of recidivist possession as opposed to the\nmisdemeanor of simple possession? And it wouldn't in\nthe Federal system, and by parity of reasoning it also\nwould not have that consequence in the State system.\nJUSTICE ALITO: That seems to be a totally\nformalistic distinction that's based on the vagaries of\nState law. What -- what is the difference between\nsomeone who is found by a court under a State recidivism\nprovision to have -- to be eligible for an increased\npunishment as a result of that finding and someone who\nis found by a court in the context of sentencing,\ndiscretionary sentencing, to have a felony possession,\nto have a prior -- a prior conviction and receives an\nincreased sentence as a result of that?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Well --\nJUSTICE ALITO: What is the -- is there any\nfunctional difference between those two situations?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Well, I think there is,\nJustice Alito, and let me just say as a preliminary\nmatter it's not based on the vagaries of State law,\nbecause it's -- I'm applying the same analysis to State\nconvictions as I do to -- to Federal convictions.\nBut one way to look at it is to ask, suppose\nthat a State or even Federal law made it salient for\nsentencing purposes whether somebody intended to\ndistribute when they possessed. They were convicted of\ndrug possession. There is an offense of possession with\nintent to distribute, but they're not charged with that\noffense; they're charged with drug possession. And\nthen sentencing somehow makes it salient, not for\npurposes of raising the statutory maximum, but just for\npurposes of sentencing within the range whether the\nperson intended to distribute.\nI don't think anybody would say that the\nindividual was convicted of the felony of possession\nwith intent to distribute because the -- the judge in\nsentencing took into account an intent to distribute\nin some way under a sentencing scheme.\nJUSTICE ALITO: But does it matter in that\nsituation that that's an element, that has to be an\nelement of the offense?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: It has to be a sentencing\nfactor that raises the statutory maximum. And the\nreason that matters is that under this statute, the\nperson has to have been convicted of a felony, and the\nonly way they're convicted of a felony is the offense\nof which they are convicted can lead to a felony\nsentence.\nAnd the sentencing factor in this case of\nrecidivism is necessary in order to give rise to a\nFederal sentence. In the absence of that finding, the\nperson has been convicted of a misdemeanor, because the\nmaximum sentence they can receive is a misdemeanor\nsentence of 1 year of imprisonment.\nIf the Court has no further questions, I'd\nlike to reserve the balance of my time for rebuttal.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Srinivasan.\nMs. Saharsky.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF NICOLE A. SAHARSKY\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMS. SAHARSKY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nCongress's judgment here was that all aliens\nwho engage in the same serious conduct would be treated\nthe same for immigration purposes. And Petitioner\ndoesn't dispute that he has two convictions for drug\npossession, and he also doesn't dispute that had that\nsecond case been prosecuted in Federal court, he could\nhave been punished as a felon. What he is saying is: I\ndon't want my aggravated felony to count because of a\ndifference in State law, because of a difference in the\nState prosecutor's decision.\nBut what this Court held in Lopez is that\nCongress's judgment controls about the seriousness of\nthe offense.\nJUSTICE BREYER: The exact words of\nLopez, which I think are important: \"We hold that a\nState offense constitutes a felony punishable under\nControlled Substance ... only if it proscribes conduct\npunishable as a felony.\" Okay?\nMS. SAHARSKY: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Under Federal law. Now,\nthere's an ambiguity when you use a word like \"offense\"\nor \"crime.\" Sometimes you mean what this guy did, and\nsometimes you're referring to a statute. It's statutes\nthat proscribe, not what this guy did. So we're\ntalking about the statute. So what it tells us to do --\nand we said the same thing in Nijhawan, and I have\nwritten in other opinions the same thing -- you go read\nthe State statute. Forget what he's done. Read the\nstatute and see if the statute proscribes conduct that\nwould amount to a felony under Federal law.\nSo let us read the statute. We turn to the\nstatute of conviction. What it says is it is a class A\nmisdemeanor for which you are punishable of less than a\nyear if you possess less than 28 grams or whatever. It\nsays nothing about recidivism. There is no increased\npunishment for recidivism.\nSo all we did was read the statute. The\nstatute does not proscribe conduct that would be a\nfelony under Federal law; it proscribes conduct that\nwould be a misdemeanor. QED. This person has not been\npunished in Texas under a statute that proscribes\nconduct that would be a felony under Federal law. End\nof case.\nNow, what is the matter with what I just\nsaid?\nMS. SAHARSKY: Because this is a two-step\ninquiry and you only did step one.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What do you mean, \"a\ntwo-step inquiry\"?\nMS. SAHARSKY: A two-step inquiry. There\nare two questions. The first is: Does the State\noffense correspond to an offense under the CSA? Does it\ncorrespond to a Federal offense, and that's based on\nthe elements, and the Court said that that was based on\nthe elements on page 51 of Nijhawan --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay. Okay.\nMS. SAHARSKY: But there's a second\nquestion, which is: If it corresponds to a Federal\noffense, how would that Federal offense be punishable?\nThe \"punishable\" under the CSA language determines that\nwe need to look at that second inquiry.\nJUSTICE BREYER: No --\nMS. SAHARSKY: If in addition to that --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Where does it say\nthat? Where does it say that in the language?\nYou are looking to the conduct that the\nstatute proscribes, not what he engaged in. Suppose the\nState statute says it is a misdemeanor to steal a\nchicken, okay?\nMS. SAHARSKY: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: It is a misdemeanor. He is\nconvicted of stealing a chicken. It turns out that the\nway he stole the chicken was to burn down the farmhouse.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: That is a felony. Now,\nwhat we have written is: Forget the second. I've\nwritten it in five opinions or four or three, most of\nwhich had a majority.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: It is called -- it is\nwritten right here in this case. It is written in\nNijhawan. What is it that tells us to go beyond the\nconduct that the State statute proscribes, not some\nother thing?\nMS. SAHARSKY: The conduct is what the State\nstatute proscribes, but there's an additional question\nof how it is punishable --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Where is the additional\nquestion? Read me the words of the statute that --\nthere might be. I'm not -- I'm being argumentative, but\nI want to know what words in the statute say there -- or\nwhat words in a case say go look to some other thing\nbeyond what the State statute proscribes?\nMS. SAHARSKY: Okay. This is on the gray\nbrief, page 10a, and this is the definition that is\nincorporated into the aggravated felony definition in\nthe INA, and it says that it encompasses, quote, \"any\nfelony punishable under the Controlled Substances Act.\"\nAnd in Lopez the Court interpreted that language to mean\nan offense that is punishable as a felony under the\nControlled Substances Act.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes. What offense? The\noffense proscribed --\nMS. SAHARSKY: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- by State law. That's\nwhy I asked you: Where does the State statute proscribe\nsomething that has to do with recidivism? I've read\nthat State statute three or four times.\nMS. SAHARSKY: Recidivism isn't part of the\noffense. It is a sentencing factor. Justice Scalia\nmentioned that. That's something this Court has\nrecognized on many occasions, that recidivism is\nsomething that can be established by the sentencing\ncourt.\nYou are right: The offense is drug\npossession. He was convicted of drug possession in\nState court. That's what he would have been convicted\nof in Federal court. But the fact that he was convicted\nof drug possession doesn't answer the separate question\nof how that offense is punishable. If it were his first\noffense, it would be punishable as a misdemeanor. If it\nwas his second offense, it would be punishable as a\nfelony.\nAnd we think that that -- that approach is\ndictated by two different opinions, the first of which\nis Lopez, which says we look for a correspondence\nbetween the State offense and the Federal offense, but\nthen we also have this question of how the offense is\npunishable in Federal court, and this punishability\nquestion is extremely relevant. The entire basis for\nthe Court's -- the entire basis for the Court's opinion\nwas that Congress's judgment about the seriousness of\nthe offense controls. It is not State by State\njudgment.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Ms. Saharsky, do we take\ninto account at all -- I mean, in Lopez as I understand\nit, the petitioner prevailed because it would not have\nbeen a felony under the Federal law. Is that right?\nMS. SAHARSKY: Yes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Here we're talking about\ntwo crimes. One is a small amount of marijuana. He\ngets 20 days in jail. The other is a pill that I never\nheard of, a Xan-something, and then he gets, what, 10 days\nin jail for that. If you could just present this scenario\nto an intelligent person who didn't go to law school,\nas you're going to not only remove him from this\ncountry, but say never, ever darken our doors again\nbecause of one marijuana cigarette and one Xan-something\npill -- it -- it just seems to me that if there's a way\nof reading the statute that would not lead to that\nabsurd result, you would want to read the statute.\nIf you are forced to read it because there's\nno other way -- but maybe there is another way.\nMS. SAHARSKY: We don't think that there is\nanother way, because the Court said in Lopez in\ninterpreting the statutory language that the State's\njudgment about how an offense is punished does not\ncontrol. What controls is Congress's judgment, and\nCongress has taken a hard line over the past 20 years on\ncriminal aliens, particularly recidivist criminal\naliens --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But it has --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Can you tell me what --\nMS. SAHARSKY: -- particularly --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: What would happen if\nthere -- forget the State. There are two Federal offenses.\nThe first Federal offense is drug possession; the second\nFederal offense, drug possession, but the prosecutor is\nnot quite sure that he has a strong case or she has a strong\ncase for recidivism because of the first conviction.\nSo the -- on the second go-around, the\nconviction is without the added finding of recidivism.\nWhat does the INA do with that case?\nMS. SAHARSKY: That would count as an\naggravated felony, as punishable as a felony, because\nthe aggravated felony language incorporates the word\n\"punishable,\" how it could be treated under Federal law,\nnot how it actually was punished. And that's because\nCongress made a -- a judgment in the immigration code\nthat what it wanted to do was to take all individuals\nwho had been engaged in the same conduct --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So you're telling us --\nMS. SAHARSKY: -- repeated drug possession,\nand treat them the same.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: What -- what would --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So something's not a\nFederal felony and it's now subject -- because he hasn't\nbeen convicted in Federal court of recidivism -- now\nhe's being punished under the INA or removed under the\nINA for what is not a felony under Federal law?\nMS. SAHARSKY: Because it's punishable --\nyes, because it's punishable as a felony under Federal\nlaw, because Congress made a judgment that those two\ndrug possession offenses, the fact of recidivism makes\nit serious enough that it could be--\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could I just ask you\none --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: If -- if I could just\nfinish on this one -- this one. In this hypothetical\nthat we're discussing, the -- the two Federal offenses\nbut no finding of recidivism, does the INA have the\nauthority to question the first conviction because it\nwas uncounseled or in effect collaterally question the\nfirst conviction?\nMS. SAHARSKY: It -- it's well established\nthat those kind of challenges can't be brought in\nimmigration court. What needs to happen is they need to\nbe brought in the State court of conviction through the\nprocedures that are --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: No, what -- our\nhypothetical here is Federal.\nMS. SAHARSKY: Oh, I'm sorry.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Right.\nMS. SAHARSKY: In that case if it -- the\nindividual would need to seek relief in Federal court in\nterms of getting his conviction --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought if it's in\nthe Federal court, and the -- they are going\nto use it as a recidivist offense, (a) the defendant is\nnotified of that, and (b) is given an opportunity to say\nthere's something infirm about that first conviction.\nThat's totally absent from this picture.\nYou say, oh, well, that's just a matter\nof procedure, so he doesn't have to get that anyplace.\nI think that Congress is requiring that. It's certainly\nan element of fundamental due process fairness, notice\nand opportunity to say, no, the first conviction\nshouldn't count.\nMS. SAHARSKY: With respect, we disagree\nbecause Congress made different judgments in the\nimmigration context and in the criminal context.\nImmigration is very different from criminal proceedings.\nThis Court has said that on numerous occasions the\nrights in terms of due process and counsel and the like\nare very different.\nAnd in immigration, Congress made a\ncategorical judgment that individuals who have been\nconvicted of conduct should all be treated the same and\nthat they all should be removed from the United States\nand should be -- not be able to get discretionary\nrelief. In the criminal sentencing context, which you\nare talking about, section -- the section 851 procedures,\nCongress made a judgment that those procedures which have\ncriminal consequences and already are individualized, that\nthere would be this notice provision. But that provision\nCongress did not apply anywhere in the immigration laws.\nAnd if you look --\nJUSTICE BREYER: You go ahead.\nMS. SAHARSKY: I was just going to say, if\nyou look all through the aggravated felony provisions --\nthey are in our brief; there are 21 of them -- for none\nof those provisions was Congress concerned about notice\nor the like. It said the individual has engaged in\nthis conduct that we think is serious.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But my point is that if\nit all happened in the Federal court, if these two\npossession offenses all happened in the Federal court,\nat the time of the second one the -- the defendant would\nhave gotten the notice and the opportunity to knock it\nout.\nI'm not talking about immigration, but\njust -- and he doesn't have that opportunity the way you\ntreat it. He doesn't -- didn't get that in the State\ncourt because nobody thought that this was a recidivist\noffense in the State court.\nMS. SAHARSKY: That's right. And that's\nbecause Congress made the decision to have those types\nof notice procedures in criminal proceedings, but they\nare not applicable by their terms anywhere in the\nimmigration laws. And just to make sure that I\nunderstand the hypotheticals that you and Justice\nKennedy have been talking about, if there is a Federal\nprosecution and the person has sought to challenge the\nvalidity of his conviction and it has been proven to be\ninvalid, then in that case, yes, there would be a\nquestion whether that conviction could be used in the\nimmigration proceedings. There is an entire body of law\nthat when a conviction has been vacated, it doesn't\ncount as a conviction under the immigration proceedings.\nSo the answer is if it is a person in State\ncourt and they think that there's a problem with their\nunderlying conviction, they need to go to State court or\nuse whatever procedures are available for challenging\nthat. But, again, the Court has said on numerous occasions\nprior convictions are presumed valid. We do not -- we\ndo not assume --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Do we know practically,\nboth on the State side and on the Federal side, do\nprosecutors presented with a simple possession case,\ndo they -- do we ever see in real life this combination\nthat somebody's going to be convicted as a recidivist\nwhen it's one marijuana cigarette on one time and one pill\non another? Do prosecutors, Federal or State, do that?\nMS. SAHARSKY: I -- I can't speak to State\nprosecutors. I know there are circumstances in which\nFederal prosecutors do it, although, quite honestly,\nmost of the Federal drug prosecutions regard the more\nserious drug crimes. The persons that come to our\nattention usually can be charged with at least\npossession with intent to distribute or drug trafficking\nor something like that. And when we do charge them with\npossession, it's usually because they pleaded down and\nwe've agreed not to give them an enhanced sentence.\nBut the judgment here is the one that\nCongress made about whether two drug possessions is\nserious, serious enough to qualify as a felony. And\nCongress --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Can I ask you a related\nquestion, which will show what I'm trying -- another\nthing that's worrying me. Suppose we're in the Armed\nCareer Criminal Act.\nNow, I have -- this is my hypothetical. You've\nheard of cat burglars. Well, this gentleman is\ncalled the pussycat burglar, and the reason is he's never\nharmed a soul. He only carries soft pillows as weapons.\nIf he sees a child, he gives them ice cream.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: It is absolutely\nestablished that this person in breaking into that house\nat night only wanted to steal a pop gun, and he is the\nleast likely to cause harm in the world.\nQuestion: He is convicted of burglary. Is\nthat a crime of violence? Answer?\nMS. SAHARSKY: Well, to the extent that the\nburglary definition depends on the Court's modified\ncategorical approach, you just look to see what he\nhad been convicted of and not the individual --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Correct.\nMS. SAHARSKY: -- circumstances of the case.\nJUSTICE BREYER: The answer is of course,\nbecause we are not looking to whether he is the pussycat\nburglar or the cat burglar. We are to look to the\nstatute of conviction and see what it is that that\nbehavior forbids -- the statute forbids. Lewis,\nNijhawan say -- do precisely the same thing with this part\nof that long list. Indeed, Nijhawan lists this\nprovision as an example of what you would do the same\nthing for.\nNow I'm back to my first question. Let's do\nit. Read the Texas statute. And where in that Texas\nstatute does it say a word about recidivism or punish\nthat conduct?\nNow, if I adopt your position, am I not,\nnot simply overturning Lewis and Nijhawan, but getting a\nvery mixed up area of the law which we have tried to\nstraighten out -- Taylor, ACCA -- once again totally\nmixed up. That's my concern.\nMS. SAHARSKY: With respect, I think that\nour position is entirely consistent and, in fact,\nfollows from Lopez and Nijhawan and is consistent with\nthe Court's modified categorical approach.\nSo, let me just talk about Lopez and\nNijhawan, because I want to make sure there's not any\nconfusion about that. Lopez said that we have a\nquestion here about whether the State offense -- and a\nState offense is made up of here drug possession;\nrecidivism isn't something that you're convicted of,\nit's a sentencing factor.\nYou look at the State offense and you see\ndoes it correspond to a Federal offense? Here it does.\nThere is State drug possession; there is Federal drug\npossession. And then you ask another question. And\nthis Court said in Lopez that that's an important\nquestion because we care about what Congress thought,\nwhich is how is this offense punishable under Federal\nlaw.\nThis is a two-part inquiry where the first\npart, the offense elements, does need to be established\nin State court, and the second part, which goes to how\nit is punishable, does not need to be established in\nState court. And that's exactly what the Court\nrecognized in its opinion under Nijhawan --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Under the Federal --\nMS. SAHARSKY: -- albeit in a second --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Under the Federal statute,\nit's only punishable on -- for recidivism purposes if the\nprior conviction was valid, because, as Justice Ginsburg\npointed out, the statute permits a defendant to object.\nWho has the burden of proof of proving validity is irrelevant.\nIt's not punishable as recidivism unless the prior conviction\nwas valid, constitutionally valid.\nSo why isn't that same standard or proof\nthereof required either in the State conviction under\nyour -- under any theory, or by the IJ? The IJ fails to\nmake that finding, how has he and on what basis has he\nruled that there was a valid prior conviction?\nMS. SAHARSKY: What makes an offense\npunishable as a felony under the Federal Controlled\nSubstances Act is contained in section 844, which\ndefines the substantive punishments available. It says\nthat drug possession is punishable as a felony in\ncertain circumstances. And this Court in Lopez,\nparticularly in footnote 6, recognized that repeat drug\npossession qualifies as punishable as a felony and under\nthe CSA and --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But only under a process\nthat requires notice --\nMS. SAHARSKY: Well, this is what is\ninteresting.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- And --\nMS. SAHARSKY: I'm sorry. What's\ninteresting is the Court cited for this provision\nsection 844(a), which defines the substantive penalties\navailable. It didn't cite -- no one thought was\nrelevant section 851, which defines procedures that\nhappen after a conviction to impose a certain\npunishment.\nSo, what we're talking about are these\nprocedures that are necessary. And it's not a finding\nof a valid conviction. It's -- it's a long set of\nprocedures. There doesn't necessarily need to be a\nfinding of a valid conviction if the defendant doesn't\nobject at all. There's burden shifting. It's very\ncomplicated. Congress did not apply it to the\nimmigration code by its terms. It's not applicable to\nthe States by its terms.\nWhat the Court said in Lopez in saying, in\nfootnote 6, that recidivist possession counts as\npunishable under the CSA, it pointed to section 844,\nwhich defines the penalties available and not anything\nabout procedures. And even conviction --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, you would\nsuggest, then, that even if a prior State court\nconviction was secured without the advice of counsel,\nthat would qualify as a Federal offense of recidivism.\nSo let's assume this case, that in neither the\nconviction for the one marijuana stick or the conviction\nfor the one sleeping pill, that if those convictions\nwere secured without the advice of counsel, that would\nbe enough to qualify him as a recidivist under the\nFederal law.\nMS. SAHARSKY: Well, that -- that raises a\nvery narrow question that, so far as we are aware, has\nnever been addressed in the immigration context, which\nis whether there could be a proceeding to challenge the\nnarrow question of a conviction obtained in the complete\nabsence of counsel.\nThis Court said in Custis that there -- even\nthough there is a very broad general rule that prior\nconvictions are presumed valid, that in one narrow\nsituation, the complete absence of counsel, that a due\nprocess type challenge could be brought.\nNow, that question has never been raised in\nthis case, whether such a challenge could be brought in\nimmigration proceedings despite the general rule that\nthere are no such collateral challenges, but that is a\ndifferent rule and a different body of jurisprudence\nfrom this Court, the due process body, as opposed to\nimporting all of the very complicated section 851\nprocedures into the -- the -- the inquiry here.\nAnd just to get back to the --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Could a -- could a defendant\nwhose prior conviction was under a State recidivism\nstatute claim that that conviction was invalid because\nthat defendant was at that time deprived of the right of\ncounsel? Do you see a difference between that situation\nand the situation in which -- and the situation in the\nsort of case we have here with respect to the issue of\nwhether the prior conviction was invalid because of the\ndeprivation of the right of counsel?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Yes, I think that they're\npotentially distinguishable. But, you know, this is --\nthis is not a question that has ever come up in the\nimmigration context. It would be a special rule that\nwould be based on the Court's decision, we think, in\nCustis and not anything about \"punishable\" referring to\nsection 851 procedures.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, why are they\ndistinguishable? You could -- you can -- you could\n-- a person faced with removal could challenge\na prior conviction on the ground that there was a\ndeprivation of the right of counsel, whether or not it\nwas pursuant to a recidivism -- whether or not there was\na recidivism issue in it, couldn't -- couldn't they?\nMS. SAHARSKY: Yes, but I think\nrecidivism -- I think there's some confusion in the\nCourt's discussion, perhaps, that recidivism is not an\nelement of the offense. You're never convicted of\nrecidivism. You're convicted of an offense, and you\nmight be subject to an increased punishment for that\noffense because you are a recidivist.\nAnd that's essentially what Petitioner wants\nhere, is to define the State court offense as having an\nelement of recidivism, but there is one thing that's\nclear from this Court's jurisprudence to this point is\nthat recidivism is separate and unique from anything\nelse that might --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: What -- what case do I\nread to establish that?\nMS. SAHARSKY: That recidivism is separate\nand unique?\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Right.\nMS. SAHARSKY: Almendarez-Torres would be\none. The Court's decision in Rodriquez would be\nanother.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but\nAlmendarez-Torres was a different offense; was it not?\nI mean this is -- this is a drug offender who -- it's\nnot like a burglar who stops burglary to take up a new\ntrade. This is -- this is a drug offender who continues\nto repeat under the drug offense laws, and I thought the\nposition was that this shows a particular propensity, a\nparticular immoral attitude that's not being corrected.\nAnd so that the recidivism makes him a worse person.\nMS. SAHARSKY: Well, what this Court said in\nRodriguez generally about recidivist punishments is you're\nalways being punished for the last offense, but\nyou're being punished more severely because it's shown\nthat incapacitation and deterrence isn't working for\nyou.\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's what was worrying\nme, that's why I asked the other question. But the --\nwhat was worrying me would be a statute where they --\nit's big enough in the State to cover possession with\nrecidivism or not, and they deal with it at the\npunishment stage, and I can see your point in respect to\nthat. But that isn't this statute.\nThis statute not only doesn't deal with it\nat the punishment stage; it's forbidden to take it into\naccount because what this says is you can only get\nrecidivism if you previously had a conviction for a\nclass A misdemeanor, and the prior conviction here was a\nclass B; and, therefore, one thing we know about the\nstatute is that under this statute, his behavior as a\nrecidivist is as close to irrelevant as you could make\nit. That's why I'm back to the cat burglar.\nMS. SAHARSKY: Right. And what -- what I'm\nsuggesting about that State statute is that -- and this\nCourt said this in Lopez -- that Congress didn't want\nthose variations in State law to change the treatment\nfor individual offenders.\nWhat it wanted, and it did this in\naggravated felony provisions, all throughout them, is to\nidentify categories of persons who had done certain\nconduct that Congress thought was serious enough and\ntreat them all the same for immigration purposes. And\nthe Court said in Lopez, we're not going to make the\nway that State law treats recidivism -- or we're not\ngoing to make State law treats an offense change the\noutcome. The outcome is going to be based on how\nFederal law treats the offense.\nAnd that's why, to get back to one of my\nearlier answers to your questions, we think that this\nCourt's decision in Nijhawan is extremely important\nhere, because what the Court recognized in that decision\nis that Congress, in defining an aggravated felony,\nsometimes talks about required elements of the offense,\nand it sometimes talks about extra facts that can be\nestablished in the immigration court. In Nijhawan, there\nwas a fraud or deceit offense with this extra fact of\nthis loss amount of $10,000 or more. And Congress did the\nsame thing in this provision. They had --\nJUSTICE BREYER: It did? Well, Nijhawan uses\nthis provision as an example of where it didn't.\nMS. SAHARSKY: Well, we think that that\nrefers to the first part of the definition. There are\nactually two parts of the definition. This is I think\non page -- right at the beginning of the appendix to our\nbrief. If you look at page 1a of the gray brief.\nYou know, there are two different parts\nhere. In 43(B), there is \"illicit trafficking in a\ncontrolled substance ... including a drug trafficking crime\n(as defined in section 924(c)).\" So this -- this first\npart, illicit trafficking, is like a generic burglary\ntype offense where you need to just look at whether\nthe -- essentially elements correspond under a modified\ncategorical approach.\nBut then the second part of it, the drug\ntrafficking crime, is the one that's defined as a felony\npunishable under the Controlled Substances Act. And\nwhen you look at a felony punishable under the Controlled\nSubstances Act, which this Court interpreted in Lopez as\na -- an offense that is punishable as a felony under Federal\nlaw, it is just like Nijhawan. It is an offense with\na certain extra fact. In Nijhawan, it was a fraud --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: May I ask you --\nMS. SAHARSKY: -- and deceit offense.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- because your time is\nrunning out. I take it your answer would be the\nsame -- at least these two misdemeanors were\ncommitted a year apart, but if they were 10 years apart,\nyour answer would still be the same?\nMS. SAHARSKY: Yes, and I think that's\nbecause Congress has said when it wants the -- the\ntiming to matter. For example, in the end of the\naggravated felony definitions, Congress said it didn't\nwant felony convictions that were more than 15 years old\nto matter. You know, Congress -- when it wants something\nold not to matter, it says so, an older conviction. So\nwe don't think that there would be a difference for that\npurpose.\nSo I just want to make sure I've answered the\nquestion. We just think this is like that situation\nwhere you have a conviction for a certain type of\noffense, which here is drug possession, and an extra fact,\nhow it's punishable in Federal court, and that extra\nfact can be established in immigration court. It's not\nthe kind thing that this Court has said under\nAlmendarez-Torres needs to be treated like an offense\nelement.\nI should note that --- and this is the point\nyou made, Justice Breyer, that there was not a\nrecidivist enhancement available in Texas court.\nJustice Kennedy, that just highlights some of the\nproblems that you identified in terms of the wide\nvariations that we would see in how similarly situated\npeople who have done the same things, two drug possession\noffenses, would be treated differently under the\nimmigration laws. And that's just not what Congress\nintended.\nWe talk in our brief -- and there's a long\nlist of differences in State laws, not only in the\nState procedures, which vary widely from Federal court,\nbut in the State laws in terms of, you know, if you can\nconsider a second possession offense for recidivist\nenhancement, or only a third or fourth; whether the\nfirst offense has to be final, et cetera, et cetera,\net cetera. That there -- these differences would just\nlead to a -- a patchwork application laws of the\nimmigration laws, and if there's any place where we don't\nwant that, it's -- it's in immigration, with respect to\nimmigration consequences.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: There was another\ncrime, I thought a more serious crime, though still a\nmisdemeanor, in this picture, but the Texas prosecutor\ndidn't make anything of that. Remind me of what that\nwas, but I thought it was a -- a more grave offense.\nMS. SAHARSKY: You might be thinking of his\nprior offense for domestic violence.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes.\nMS. SAHARSKY: That that may have been able\nto be used to -- to enhance his -- his drug crime to an\nenhanced sentence, but that -- there wasn't an\nenhancement sought on that.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes --\nMS. SAHARSKY: That was a -- a 2003\nconviction.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So we respect that\njudgment on the part of the prosecutor, not to make it a\n-- a ground for a recidivist charge, but we don't\nrespect the prosecutor -- Texas prosecutor saying I'm\njust going to treat this like it's a first-time\nmisdemeanor; that's it.\nMS. SAHARSKY: In neither case does the\nprosecutor's judgment matter. What matters is the\noffense conduct that was established by the conviction\nin State court. What matters is the offense that the\nperson was convicted of and if that corresponds to a\nFederal offense that was punishable as a felony in\nFederal court.\nIt is true that some charges may be\nbrought and some charges may not be brought, and that\nwould impact what a person has been convicted of. So\nthere could be disparities based on that. But what\nCongress decided was that it had to balance its need for\nuniformity with a rule that is administrable, and the rule\nthat it picked as administrable is, let's look at the\noffense conduct that was established by the conviction.\nAnd when you look at that offense conduct, you have to ask\nhow it could be punished in Federal court. And it's that\n\"punishable\" language that requires this more hypothetical\ninquiry on how the events -- how the offense could be\ntreated.\nAnd just to summarize, it is clear from the\nlast 20 years that Congress has had a very serious\nconcern about recidivist criminal aliens in the United\nStates, and Congress has made a judgment since 1970 in\nthe drug laws that two drug possession offenses should\nbe punishable as a felony. And under those\ncircumstances, a person who concededly has committed\nthose two drug offenses and who concededly, if taken to\nFederal court, could have been punished as a felony, just\nshould not be able to escape the aggravated felony\ndesignation that Congress intended for all aliens who\nare similarly situated.\nIf the Court has no further questions, we\nsubmit the judgment below should be affirmed.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMs. Saharsky.\nMr. Srinivasan, you have 4 minutes\nremaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF SRI SRINIVASAN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Thank you --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: We usually think of\nrecidivism when we talk about statistics as being\nrepeated for any crime. This is a recidivism of a special\nkind. It's repeating the same -- the same thing. Is\nthat essential to your argument? I know it's essential\nto the -- to the Federal statute.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Right, and because it's\nessential to the Federal statute, it's necessarily a part\nof our argument. I don't think our argument would be\nany different if the Federal statute read differently,\nbut you can only be punishable as a felon under Federal\nlaw if you had a prior drug conviction, and if you had a\nprior drug conviction that was in fact found to exist.\nAnd I think, Justice Kennedy, the first point\nI'd like to make in rebuttal -- there's two points I'd\nlike to make. The first addresses a question you\nraised concerning what happens in a situation in which\nthe second proceeding is a Federal proceeding rather\nthan a State proceeding.\nAnd I think this is important to highlight\nthe government's response, because if the second proceeding\nis a Federal proceeding, we have a person who has a prior\nconviction for drug possession. We have a person who is\nthen prosecuted in Federal court for a second time for\ndrug possession. The prosecutor by hypothesis never\nbrings the initial conviction into play. The court\ntherefore never finds that the person is a recidivist.\nAs a consequence, that person cannot as a matter of law\nreceive a felony sentence. They can only be sentenced\nas a misdemeanant. But nonetheless, the government would\nsay that they have been, quote, \"convicted of a felony,\npunishable under the Controlled Substances Act,\" close quote --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: How do you --\nMR. SRINIVASAN: -- even though no felony\nsentence could be imposed.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: How do you distinguish\nNijhawan? I mean, there what made it a Federal felony\nwas the fact that more than $10,000 was obtained from\nthe victims. But that was not found in the -- in the\nState conviction. It simply was not.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: There were -- there were\ntwo things that made it a Federal felony,\nJustice Scalia. First was it had to be an offense that\ninvolved fraud.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's right.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: And then -- and that had to\nbe found by the convicting court.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Right.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: There was no issue about\nthat. Our --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No issue.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Our point is that --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, what about the\n$10,000? That --\nMR. SRINIVASAN: That's the --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: He was never convicted of\nhaving obtained by fraud more than $10,000 from the\nvictim.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: But -- but there's a very\nimportant textual distinction, Justice Scalia, because\nunder the provision at issue in Nijhawan, the offense\nhad to involve fraud, and then there was a separator in\nwhich the loss exceeds $10,000. And the Court focused\non the fact that the text read \"in which.\" That was\ncritical, and another thing that was critical in\nNijhawan was that if you looked at Federal statutes and\nasked, were there any that as to which the elements would\nrequire a loss in excess of $10,000, there were none.\nAnd because of that practical consequence,\nthe Court reached the conclusion that Congress would\nhave intended, that the $10,000 be something that the\nimmigration judge could have found.\nWe have the opposite situation here.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You still had the word\n\"convicted.\"\nMR. SRINIVASAN: You had -- sure.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Which is what you're\nrelying on. That word was applicable there as much as\nit's applicable here, and we did not require him to\nhave been convicted of having obtained more than $10,000.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Because, again, the test --\nthe text also had \"in which,\" which the Court found\ncritical -- that text is lacking here -- and because the\nstatute would have had no practical consequence, absent\nthe Court's interpretation.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, that's -- that --\nMR. SRINIVASAN: That's not true here.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Because she got to that argument\nat the end, and she said my -- I wrote that, I think, and I --\nwhen I used as an example or the text uses an example, this\nprovision is one where you don't look to real conduct.\nShe said that was a mistake, really. It\nwas overstated, because what they're saying is that\nrecidivism analogous to the $10,000 was meant to be a\nreal conduct aspect, not just offense of conviction, and\n-- and she gave similar reasons. That's why -- similar\nreasons are that the States are too mixed up in\nthis; it will be too difficult to look at that element\nitself. So she's trying to analogize that to the\n$10,000.\nNow, why isn't that a good analogy?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Because for both reasons\nthat the Court found that you could look to the\ncircumstances in Nijhawan, neither of those two reasons\napplies here. You don't have a textual separator. You\ndon't have the words \"in which.\" All you have is the\nword \"convicted.\" And you also don't have the\nconsequence that the -- the provision would cease to\nhave any practical implications under our reading.\nIt would absolutely have practical\nimplications under our reading, because anytime a person\nwas found to have been a recidivist and their sentence\nwas raised, their maximum sentence was raised as a\nconsequence, they will have been deemed to have been\naggravated felon. But here, that didn't happen. You'd\nhave to understand that in the Federal system, even\nthough an individual could not as a matter of law be\nsentenced as a felon, they nonetheless would have been\ndeemed to have been convicted of a felony, and at the\nvery least -- and this is the second point I'd like to\nmake, if I could just --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Make your second\npoint short.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Thank you,\nMr. Chief Justice.\nPrinciples of lenity which the government\nagrees are potentially applicable here would dictate ruling\nin our favor even if you thought that the text was\nambiguous. The principles of lenity do apply. An\nindividual who pleads guilty to possession in exchange\nfor a prosecutor's decision to refrain from charging him\nas a recidivist and, therefore, could only be sentenced as\na misdemeanor I think should be allowed to be convinced\nthat he has been convicted of a misdemeanor rather than\na felony.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
