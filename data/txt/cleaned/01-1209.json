        "content": "(10:03 a.m.)\nJUSTICE STEVENS: We'll now hear argument in our\nfirst case, Number 1209, the Boeing Company against the\nUnited States.\nMr. Geller.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF KENNETH S. GELLER\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. GELLER: Thank you, Justice Stevens, and may\nit please the Court:\nThe Internal Revenue Code generally requires\nevery corporation to pay an annual tax measured by its\nentire net income, but Congress decided 30 years ago in\nthe DISC and FSC statutes that it wished to encourage\nexports by giving favorable tax treatment to the portion\nof a company's net income that's attributable to export\nsales.\nIn order to determine the extent of this income\ntax benefit, it's obviously critically important to\ndetermine precisely how much net income is generated by a\ncompany's export sales in any particular year.\nIn enacting the DISC statute, Congress said\nquite specifically how it expected this export net income\ncalculation to be made. Gross revenues from export sales\nwere to be reduced only by those costs that were directly\nand factually related to the export income. Export sales\nrevenues were not to be burdened with unrelated expenses\nwhich would distort the true amount of export income, and\nthereby reduce the intended incentive.\nThe DISC regulations, which were promulgated\nshortly after the statute was passed, reiterate that there\nmust be a direct factual relationship between export sales\nand expenses.\nQUESTION: Where do you -- do you get that\nproposition in the statute, Mr. Geller?\nMR. GELLER: Justice Scalia, we get it out of\ntwo separate statutory provisions. One is section 994.\nQUESTION: Where are these to be found?\nMR. GELLER: These are -- this is found on\npage 27a of the appendix to the petition.\nAnd specifically, the reference in 994(a) and\n994(a)(2) to the requirement that a determination must be\nmade of the net income, quote, attributable to export\nreceipts. We think that the common sense nature of the\nword attributable, which this Court in the tax context has\nconstrued to mean generated by, or caused by, is that you\nhave to take the export -- the revenues from exports and\nreduce them only by the costs or deductions that are\nrelated to those exports, or else you can't possibly come\nup with a true figure of export -- net export income\nthat's attributable to those -- to those sales.\nQUESTION: I -- I suppose that -- that R&D\nexpenses have to be attributed in a lot of other instances\nunder the code, don't they? And -- and doesn't the\nGovernment use this same procedure that it's been using\nhere in other -- in other areas where it has to\nattribute -- where -- where R&D expense has to be\nattributed?\nMR. GELLER: Yes. It relies on a provision,\nwhich we'll talk about in a few minutes, that has many,\nmany applications, and it may well be that in a number of\nthose other applications, it's perfectly valid. Our\nposition is --\nQUESTION: Well, why is that? I mean, why is\nit attributable --\nMR. GELLER: Well, as I hope to --\nQUESTION: -- okay elsewhere to -- to produce\nthis result, but not okay here to produce this result?\nMR. GELLER: Because it -- the DISC provisions\nare unique in a number of respects, one of which is it\nallows the taxpayer to engage in a particular grouping of\ntransactions, and the -- the -- as we'll talk about in a\nfew minutes, the R&D regulations insist that R&D be\nattributed in a way that disregards the particular\ngroupings that the taxpayer has selected.\nBut there's another statutory provision that I'd\nlike to call your attention to, Your Honor, and that's\nsection 861. 861 is a section of the code that has been\nin the code, was in the code for more than 50 years at the\ntime the DISC statute was passed, and it provides for how\ndeductions are to be allocated to gross income. This --\nthis appears at page 26a of the appendix.\nNow Congress, in passing the DISC statute, said\nquite specifically that it wanted deductions under the\nDISC statute to be allocated in a way generally in\naccordance with the principles of section 861, which were\nwell-established at that time.\nQUESTION: Where -- where did Congress say that?\nMR. GELLER: Congress said that in the reports\nof the House, of the tax-writing committee.\nQUESTION: Just for my benefit, when it's in the\nstatute, would you say Congress said it. When it's in\nlegislative history, would you tell me who said it?\nMR. GELLER: Yes, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Because when you say Congress said\nit, I thought you mean it's in the statute.\nMR. GELLER: Well, it's not in the statute.\nIt's in the reports of the tax-writing committees. But,\nYour Honor, these were not idle statements. These were\nnot statements of individual Congressmen, or statements on\nthe floor. These were deliberate statements put in the\nreports of both the House and Senate tax-writing\ncommittees which focused specifically -- specifically --\non how Congress expected these deductions to be allocated.\nAnd I would refer the Court to page --\nQUESTION: And I'm sure everybody who voted for\nthat knew about those statements.\nMR. GELLER: Your Honor, these were specific\nstatements that went to the heart of the issue that's\nbefore the Court today, and we've quoted them at page 22\nof our brief, the blue brief. Congress said that\nthese 861 rules --\nQUESTION: The committee said. Please, please.\nMR. GELLER: The committee reports said --\nexcuse me, Justice Scalia.\nthat -- that the 861 rules, which are important because\nlater the regulations themselves under DISC reference the\n861 rules, so it's -- and that's the heart of the\nGovernment's argument in this case, so it's important to\nunderstand what people thought at the time these 861 rules\nmeant.\nQUESTION: But -- but why does 861 get you out\nof the general allocation provisions any more than 994\ndoes? In other words, the question was, why do we ignore\nthe usual rule for apportionment of R&D? And you said,\nwell, because 994 is -- is specific and -- and has some\npolicies of its own. And then you said -- and to further\nthat argument, you show us 861.\nMR. GELLER: Yes.\nQUESTION: But the regs that we're talking\nabout, which the Government relies on, are under 861.\nMR. GELLER: Yes, but the -- the regulation,\nJustice Kennedy, that the Government relies on was added\nto 861 after the DISC regulations were finalized. It was\nadded in 1977. The DISC statute was passed in 1971. The\nDISC regulations were finalized in 1975. So our position\nis it's important to understand what Congress in 1971\nthought it was doing in the DISC statute, and therefore it\nseems to us extremely important that it said that it\nexpected deductions, including presumably any deduction,\nincluding R&D, to be allocated in accordance generally\nwith the principles of section 861, which were described\nquite clearly in the Senate and House reports of the\ntax-writing committees to --\nQUESTION: Mr. Geller, there's one problem.\nPerhaps you can cast some light on it. The word is\nattributable that you pointed to in 994. And the R&D you\nhave divided into Blue Sky and program- or product-\nspecific.\nMR. GELLER: Yes.\nQUESTION: That -- that's Boeing's creation.\nThe R&D -- that division is eminently manipulable, it\nseems to me, if it -- it's the distinction whether it's\nallocated across the board because of Blue Sky or\nparticular program or project depends on some official act\nby a corporate board which could be yesterday, could be\nnext month. It's in the control of the corporation.\nMR. GELLER: Not -- not quite, Justice Ginsburg.\nIt's not manipulable. It has to satisfy the regulations\npromulgated under DISC. The DISC regulations -- and here\nI would refer the Court to page 33a of the appendix to the\npetition, and specifically the grouping regulations --\nprovide that a taxpayer can only group -- can only group\ntransactions if they fall within a recognized industry\nproduct line.\nallocate expenses to any sorts of transactions you want.\nThey have to be grouped in a way that's consistent with\nthe DISC statute.\nAnd that's exactly what Boeing did here. The\nBlue Sky R&D was attributable to all of their airplane\nproducts, and therefore it was allocated to the groupings\nof all of the different airplane programs. These\nprogram-specific R&D -- and I don't think there's any\nfactual dispute about this. The program-specific R&D was\nfactually and directly related only to a specific program.\nThe 747 R&D, for example, was -- was factually and\ndirectly related only to the 747 program. And that's why\nBoeing allocated that R&D only to the 747 program.\nQUESTION: Mr. Geller, can I ask you a factual\nquestion that will help me understand? Does the -- is\nthere just one DISC involved here, or do you have several\nDISCs for different product lines?\nMR. GELLER: No. It's one -- it's one DISC.\nQUESTION: So that what difference would it make\nwhether it was the 747 program, or the 727 program if the\nDISC sells them both anyway?\nMR. GELLER: Because, Justice Stevens, under the\nstatute, combined taxable income or export income is -- is\nto be determined on the basis of product groupings, or at\nleast, the taxpayer has the option of choosing to group by\ndifferent products rather than by all the sales of the\nDISC. So, therefore, here, we determine what the export\nincome is for the 747 program, which takes the revenues\nfrom the 747 program and reduces them by the deductions,\nincluding R&D that's factually and directly related to the\n747 program, and you -- you come up with the CTI for the\n747 program. Under -- it's not all mixed together as one\ngroup of export income. Under -- under the statute and\nregulations Boeing was entitled to group transactions.\nThe -- the problem here is that the regulation\nthat the Government relies on takes huge amounts of R&D\nthat are directly related to a specific program and\nallocates them among all of the programs.\nQUESTION: But, of course, the converse, I\nsuppose under your view, all of the R&D would go to the\ndomestic corporation because it all takes place before the\nproduct is put on the market.\nMR. GELLER: No. It doesn't really matter\nwhether the product is on the market or not, Your Honor.\nIt has to be allocated to a class of gross income. Now,\nthat class of gross income may well include, as it does in\nthis case, products or programs that aren't yet on the\nmarket that are being developed.\nQUESTION: Right.\nMR. GELLER:\nare quite clear that the deductions have to be allocated\nto that class of gross income.\nSo, for example, in the 757 program, which was\nin -- which was being developed in 1982, there were no\nsales of the 757 in 1982, and yet there were hundreds of\nmillions of dollars of R&D expended in that year. In our\nview, the regulations make it quite clear that Boeing had\nto allocate those deductions, that R&D and other\ndeductions, to the 757 program.\nQUESTION: Well, what -- what do you say to at\nleast this argument of the Government? I -- I guess the\nGovernment would probably say, sure, there's -- there's a\nkind of factual sense in which there is the kind of\nrelationship that you're talking about. But if you want\nthe closest relationship -- the most perfect\nrelationship -- you would capitalize your R&D and you\nwould start amortizing it when you actually have a product\nthat is generating income that you're selling. That would\nbe the closest match you could get.\nThat match, in effect, has -- has been -- has\nbeen set aside. Instead of forcing you to do that, the\nlaw now allows you to -- to use your R&D as -- as a\ncurrent expense.\nOnce you start using it, once you start treating\nit as a current expense, that very close relationship that\nyou have, if you had capitalized it, is gone. And what\nthe Government is saying is, it's a judgment call how\nclose it's got to be now, now that you have broken the\nlink and have allowed current expense. And that kind of a\njudgment call is quintessentially the judgment call that\nthe -- that the Treasury makes when it's write -- when it\nwrites regulations.\nAnd why isn't that a pretty powerful argument?\nAnd if it is, how do you get over the point of\nreasonableness or -- or Chevron deference as the\nGovernment would see it?\nMR. GELLER: Well, Justice Souter, you've\ndescribed the Government's position. Let me see if I can\nrespond to it.\nBut generally, just -- as to the last point --\nthis is not a legislative regulation. There really is no\nChevron deference that's in play here.\nQUESTION: Well, there's -- there's -- certainly\nthere is some degree of deference here.\nMR. GELLER: There is some degree of\nreasonableness.\nQUESTION: We can argue whether it's Chevron or\nnot.\nQUESTION: It was a notice and comment\nregulation.\nMR. GELLER: It was, but it was promulgated\nunder section 7805. There's no specific provision in the\ncode that allows the Treasury to issue legislative regs\nhere, but I don't want to get off on that because it --\nQUESTION: But you -- if it's -- whether you\ncall it -- if you call it an interpretive regulation --\nMR. GELLER: Yes.\nQUESTION: -- it still deserves some respect\nfrom a court --\nMR. GELLER: Yes.\nQUESTION: -- does it not?\nMR. GELLER: Yes, it does but it has to be\nconsistent, obviously, with the legislative scheme that\nit's interpreting.\nJustice Souter, let me answer your question a\nnumber of different ways.\nFirst, it is not at all unique for expenses to\ngive rise to future year income. In fact, most expenses\ngive rise to future year income. The fact that an expense\nmay occur in year 1, and the income may be generated in\nyear 2, is a commonplace. It doesn't in any way --\nQUESTION: Sure they do.\nMR. GELLER: It --\nQUESTION: But the most precise way to match it,\nI -- I would suppose, is the capitalization way. And the\nGovernment says once you -- once you lose the\nquintessentially perfect way of doing it, then how you're\ngoing to recognize it is a judgment call.\nMR. GELLER: Well, I don't accept -- they can't\ncapitalize it, Your Honor, because Congress made a\njudgment in section 174 of the code in order to encourage\nR&D to allow it to be immediately deducted in the year in\nwhich it's incurred.\nQUESTION: Absolutely. And they say when\nCongress made that judgment, there's a further judgment\nleft and that is the judgment how close has it got to be.\nMR. GELLER: Yes, but the Government's\nregulation here is not close at all. The Government\nconcedes that -- that expenses for R&D give rise to future\nyear income. They can't -- because of section 174, they\ncan't --\nQUESTION: Well, sometimes -- sometimes they do\nand sometimes they don't. I mean, if things work out\nfine, the answer is yes. If they don't work out fine, the\nanswer is no. And that's -- that's one of the -- that's\none of the problems that the Government raises.\nMR. GELLER: Well, look at what the 8(e)(3)\nregulation does, Your Honor. It doesn't make any attempt\nto match current year R&D expenses with some future income\nthat might be generated from that R&D. What it, instead,\ndoes, it allocates all of that income to current year\nexpenses -- to current year revenues for products that\nhave no relation whatsoever to that R&D.\nFor example, let me say -- come back again to\nthe 757 program.\nQUESTION: Well, here -- may -- may I interrupt\nyou with this question?\nMR. GELLER: Sure.\nQUESTION: You say it has no relation\nwhatsoever. I take it then you are saying that the\nGovernment is simply factually wrong when it makes the\nstatement that R&D, which may have a closer relation to\none product line than another, nonetheless tends, as a\ngeneral rule, to have benefits that go beyond product\nlines. We -- they -- they, in effect, say, look, you\nlearn useful things, and you use them all over the place.\nAre you saying that that is factually wrong?\nMR. GELLER: Yes. I'm saying that -- that --\nI'm saying clearly in this case it's factually wrong. For\nexample, this case went off on cross motions for summary\njudgment. There was really no dispute that Boeing had --\nas a factual matter -- allocated the R&D expenses\ncorrectly. As a factual matter. The Government said they\nhad to be reallocated because of this conclusive\npresumption in section 8(e)(3).\nBut, yes, I'm telling you, Justice --\nJustice Souter, that that's incorrect as a factual matter,\nthat in fact, under section 174, in order to take a\ndeduction for R&D at all in any circumstance, DISC or no\nDISC, the taxpayer has to be able to factually relate that\nR&D expense to a particular product.\nQUESTION: Oh, you've got to show the\nrelationship --\nMR. GELLER: Yes, factual relationship.\nQUESTION: -- but it doesn't follow from that\nthat there is no benefit to product lines outside of that\nrelationship.\nMR. GELLER: Yes, but if there -- there could\nwell be a spill-over benefit to future product lines, but\nthat doesn't, A, mean that it's not directly and factually\nrelated a specific current program.\nAnd also, look at the oddity and anomaly of the\nGovernment's position here, Justice Souter. Even if it\nis -- there is some spill-over effect for future product\nlines, when the Government -- when the -- when Boeing was\ndeveloping the 757, it's conceivable that they were\nlearning things that would benefit future products. But\nwhat the Government does is take all that R&D and allocate\nit to existing products, sales of existing products that\ncouldn't possibly have benefitted from that R&D.\nQUESTION: That's so. But could -- I'd like\nvery much to hear your response to Justice Kennedy's\nquestion. Was it -- and where we started was with Justice\nScalia and Justice Kennedy. And as I understand where\nthey were driving, there is a statute, and the statute is\nDISC. And under this statute, there's either some\nlanguage, or there's some history anyway, which is of\ninterest to me, which says when you work out the\nallocation rules, follow section 881 -- or 861.\nMR. GELLER: 861.\nQUESTION: 861, which is for allocation of all\nkinds of things --\nMR. GELLER: Well --\nQUESTION: -- for Puerto Rico, to abroad,\net cetera.\nSo now we look to 861.\nMR. GELLER: But --\nQUESTION: And lo and behold, what they did in\n861, after DISC was passed, is they changed the 861 rules,\nand in those changed rules, it says you're going to\nallocate everything to a SIC category called\ntransportation services. And then it has a little\nsentence here. The taxpayer may not subdivide the\ncategories in this list.\nMR. GELLER: Yes.\nQUESTION: All right? So that's their 861 rule.\nMR. GELLER: That's -- that is the --\nQUESTION: All right. Now, what legally is\nwrong with that --\nMR. GELLER: What's legally --\nQUESTION: -- since Congress told them to use\n861, and here they're using it.\nMR. GELLER: Well -- well, there are a number of\nthings wrong with that, Justice Breyer. The first is, as\nyou yourself pointed out. At the time Congress made this\ncross-reference, at the time the legislative history said\nthat the rules under 861 would be followed, and at the\ntime the regs were issued in 1975 that cross-referenced\n861, this 8(e)(3) rule, which is an aberrational rule,\ndoesn't follow the general guidelines of the 861 rules.\nIt was not even in the regulation.\nQUESTION: That's right. In respect to that,\nfor you to win on that, we'd have to say that Congress\nintended that the rules be different for DISC's than for\nPuerto Rico, for Europe, for Saudi Arabia --\nMR. GELLER: Oh, absolutely. Absolutely.\nQUESTION: -- for everything. Or we'd have to\nsay that we're throwing out this reg for everything.\nMR. GELLER: No, no, no. The reg has many other\napplications, and we're not suggesting that it be --\nQUESTION: So you're saying DISC has to be\ndifferent.\nMR. GELLER: I'm saying DISC is different,\nJustice Breyer.\nQUESTION: Okay, what in --\nMR. GELLER: And let me explain, if I could --\nQUESTION: Yes. That's what I wanted to --\nMR. GELLER: -- why DISC is different.\nQUESTION: That's -- we are. I -- all right.\nMR. GELLER: DISC is different because -- for\ntwo reasons. One is, DISC provides preferential tax\nbenefits to a -- to a subclass of net income, export net\nincome. It is critically important to have an accurate\ncalculation of what the export net income is. You cannot\nhave an accurate calculation of the net income from sales\nof 747s if you're going to start with the gross revenues\nfrom the sale of 747s, and then you're going to deduct\nfrom it expenses that have no factual relationship to\n747s. You inevitably are going to be left with an\nerroneous net income calculation.\nNow, I want to also add that this was focused on\nin 1973 and 1975 when the Treasury was issuing its DISC\nregulations. In 1973, Treasury issued proposed\nregulations under 861 that specifically said how R&D was\ngoing to be -- was going to be allocated in the context of\na DISC. They gave an example, which is identical to the\nexample of this case. It was an example involving a\nmanufacturer that manufactured four-, six-, and eight-\ncylinder engines. Each was grouped as a separate product\nline, as it was entitled to be --\nQUESTION: I'll assume the example was\nidentical.\nMR. GELLER: It is identical.\nQUESTION: And I will take your words that you\nhave just said.\nMR. GELLER: Yes.\nQUESTION: And I will ask you why a different\nperson quoting those words couldn't make the identical\nargument in respect to the tremendous tax advantages given\nto Puerto Rico --\nMR. GELLER: Because --\nQUESTION: -- or in respect to the supreme\nimportance of having allocation between Europe and the\nUnited States among subsidiaries --\nMR. GELLER: You'd have to look -- you'd have to\nlook --\nQUESTION: -- and principal corporations be\naccurate.\nMR. GELLER: You'd have to look at those\nstatutes.\nthere at all if it would lead inevitably to an incorrect\ncalculation of -- of that net income.\nBut there's something in addition here, Your\nHonor. Two things in addition. First, Justice Breyer,\nthe 994 regulations do not incorporate verbatim all of\nthese 861 rules. They don't incorporate 8(e)(3). They\ndon't incorporate -- they say that the allocations to be\nmade under section 994 are to be done generally in\naccordance with the rules under 861.\nAt the time that that was put in the\nregulations, the rules under 861 unequivocally provided\nthat there had to be, for every allocation, a direct\nfactual relationship between the expenditure --\nQUESTION: Yes, but that doesn't mean when --\nyou say in accordance with 861. Does -- does that mean as\nit now exists, or --\nMR. GELLER: Yes.\nQUESTION: -- 861 as it may be amended from --\nor, you know --\nMR. GELLER: I --\nQUESTION: -- as it may be interpreted from time\nto time by -- by --\nMR. GELLER: Not -- not --\nQUESTION: -- by Treasury?\nMR. GELLER:\nan aberrational -- not if a rule could be put in several\nyears later that's inconsistent with the rules that the\ntax-writing committees and that the Treasury Department\nassumed --\nQUESTION: But that --\nMR. GELLER: -- would be the 861 rules.\nQUESTION: That's a different argument. That --\nMR. GELLER: That excepts --\nQUESTION: What I'm saying is it doesn't seem to\nme, even if you believed in -- in legislative history, you\ncan't rely on the fact that they say it's going to be done\npursuant to 861. The Government says, we are doing it\npursuant to 861.\nMR. GELLER: But not pursuant to the rules.\nThis is -- if you look, in fact, at the 8(e)(3)\nregulation, Justice Scalia, it begins by explaining why\nit's deviating from the general rules of 861, why it felt\nthe need for R&D to deviate from the general rules that\nrequire a factual connection between expenditures and\nrevenues.\nNow, there's another -- there's --\nQUESTION: If you -- if you want me to say that\na regulation drawn after a statute was enacted, another\nstatute, is -- is invalid because the intervening statute\nis -- is applicable instead, what -- what case do I cite,\nor what rule? Is -- is the rule just that the specific\ncontrols over the general? I mean, is that all we're\ntalking about?\nMR. GELLER: It is. It is certainly the\nspecific controls over the general. It is also the fact\nthat there was a regime here that requires a -- accurate\ncalculation of export income. The rules that were\npromulgated in 1975 did that. An aberrational rule was\nput in in 1977 which we say is inconsistent with the\naccurate calculation of net income and can't be applied,\nat least in this context.\nBut there's another reason, Justice Kennedy, why\nthe 1977 8(e)(3) regulation is inconsistent with DISC, and\nthat's the grouping regulations, which I want to call your\nattention to, which is a very, very important part of the\nDISC statute.\nIf I could call the Court's attention to the\ngrouping regulations which appear at -- at 994(c)(7),\nwhich is the bottom of page 33a of the appendix to the\npetition, you will see that the -- the taxpayer was\nentitled to group its products, to figure out export\nincome not in gross, but on the basis of each product or\nrecognized product line, which is what Boeing did here.\nAnd if the Court would look at (6)(iv) in the\nmiddle of page 33a, you'll see that the regulations\nprovide that the taxpayer's choice as to how to group is\ncontrolling -- controlling. And the regulations go on to\nsay that costs deductible in a particular year shall be\nallocated and apportioned to the classes of gross income\nresulting from such grouping.\nQUESTION: Now -- now, perhaps you can help me\nhere because this is a complicated statute. Is the\nGovernment going to answer that, of -- of course, that\nis -- is controlling, but that is only for the purpose of\none of the three -- of -- of one of the three choices that\nit makes in -- and -- and it's made the choice to have the\ncombined income?\nMR. GELLER: Yes, that's the Government's\nargument. But it's completely inconsistent with the words\nof the regulations, Justice Kennedy. The regulations say\nthat all of the determinations under (c) have to be made\nconsistent with the grouping, including the allocation of\ndeductions. So --\nQUESTION: And where -- where does it say that?\nMR. GELLER: It says it in the language that I\njust read to you, that the -- all -- that the costs\ndeductible in a taxable year shall be allocated to the\nitems of gross income resulting from such grouping.\nSo, here, Boeing grouped its -- its classes of\ngross income --\nQUESTION: Where were you reading from,\nMr. Geller? I'd like to follow.\nMR. GELLER: Excuse me. Yes.\nQUESTION: What were you reading from?\nMR. GELLER: I'm reading -- I'm reading in the\nmiddle of page 33, Justice Stevens, the (iv), the\nparagraph --\nQUESTION: Oh, number iv, okay.\nMR. GELLER: -- which talks about how costs are\nto be allocated after the taxpayer has chosen particular\ngroupings.\nQUESTION: These are the regulations --\nMR. GELLER: Under DISC.\nQUESTION: -- under the DISC scheme.\nMR. GELLER: That's right.\nQUESTION: Correct?\nMR. GELLER: That's exactly right, Justice\nO'Connor.\nQUESTION: And this is how Treasury initially\nthought the DISC scheme should be --\nMR. GELLER: There's -- there's nothing in\nthis --\nQUESTION: And you're reading under (iii)?\nSub (iii)?\nMR. GELLER:\nQUESTION: Sub (iv).\nMR. GELLER: (iv), Justice Kennedy. This is\ncrucial.\nAnd if you look at the Eighth Circuit's decision\nin St. Jude, this is one of the provisions that it\nreferred to as -- as showing that 8(e)(3) is completely\ninconsistent with the --\nQUESTION: But the problem is then along come\nregulations under the general 861 provision governing R&D\nexpenses, and they don't track each other. So how is it\nthat we --\nMR. GELLER: You have inconsistent --\nQUESTION: -- don't defer to the Treasury\nDepartment interpretation? That's the sticking point for\nme.\nMR. GELLER: Well, Justice --\nQUESTION: We owe some kind of deference.\nMR. GELLER: I appreciate that, Justice\nO'Connor. You don't defer, I think, for several reasons.\nFirst, the language of the statute -- it's\ncritical to determine an accurate calculation of export\nnet income. The 8(e)(3) regulation provides conclusive\npresumptions in place of factual matching so that it\ninevitably will lead to an incorrect -- and secondly, as I\nsaid, the -- it was the understanding of everyone,\nincluding the Treasury Department when it issued the DISC\nregulations in 1975, that the taxpayer's choice of\ngrouping would be controlling, that -- that allocations of\ndeductions, including R&D deductions, would be -- be made\non the -- on the basis of the taxpayer's grouping. And\nwhen 8(e)(3) comes in, it says, no, no, no. For R&D --\nQUESTION: Mr. Geller, on that point doesn't the\nword grouping, the last word in subparagraph (iv), refer\nto the three choices in subparagraph (vi) of the -- on --\non page 32a?\nMR. GELLER: No, no, no. I think it refers to\nthe -- to the choices that are to be made in paragraph\n(vii) at the bottom of page 33a, and the top of 34a.\nThe groupings are -- you can -- you can\ndetermine CTI, Justice Stevens, either on the basis of\neach individual transaction, which would be very, very\ncumbersome. Congress understood that and therefore\nexpected that there would be grouping. The taxpayer is\nentitled to choose two different ways to group its\ntransactions. One is by recognized product line -- which\nis what Boeing did here, the 747s, the 767s, the\nrecognized product lines -- or basis of SIC code. Boeing\ncould have chosen to group its transactions by SIC code.\nIt chose not to do that.\nAnd nonetheless, the 8(e)(3) regulation comes in\nand insists that although all other deductions can be made\non the basis of the product groupings chosen by Boeing,\nwhich the regulations say are to be controlling, this one\nclass of deductions, R&D, has to be allocated on the basis\nof SIC code. And that's completely inconsistent with the\nstatement in the middle of page 33a that we were talking\nabout that says that all of the deductions are to be\nallocated on the basis of the taxpayer's grouping, and\nthat that grouping is, in the words of the regulation,\ncontrolling.\nQUESTION: Mr. Geller, I don't want to eat up\nyour -- your rebuttal time.\nMR. GELLER: That's all right.\nQUESTION: But -- but the Government is going to\ncome back and say, look it, if you did it transaction-by-\ntransaction, we would apply our normal rule under 861.\nMR. GELLER: If you did a --\nQUESTION: You say it's a lot different.\nMR. GELLER: I think the -- actually --\nQUESTION: Would that be correct if they did --\nMR. GELLER: No, no. It would actually help our\nargument. If you did it transaction-by-transaction, you\ntook an individual sale of a 747 --\nQUESTION: Right.\nMR. GELLER:\nout what the export net income was from that sale, it\nseems to me you would start with the cost of the -- of the\nrevenues generated by the sale of that single airplane,\nand then you would try to figure out what costs were\nincurred in producing that airplane, including the R&D\ncosts. You would never, I think, take costs that were\nincurred that year in trying to develop a 787 airplane,\nwhich had no relationship whatsoever to the sale of\nthat 747, and attribute those costs to it in order to\nreduce the net income. That's what the 8(e)(3) regulation\ndoes.\nIf the Court has no further questions, I'd like\nto reserve the balance of my time for rebuttal. Thank\nyou.\nQUESTION: Mr. Jones.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF KENT L. JONES\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. JONES: Thank you, Justice Stevens, and may\nit --\nQUESTION: Mr. Jones, before I lose the thread\nof -- my thread of thought, is it correct what Mr. Geller\njust said, that if it was done transaction-by-transaction,\nyou would not use the same -- the same allocation basis\nthat you're using here?\nMR. JONES: No.\ntransactional basis, which is the -- the base case\nprovision under DISC, 861 regs would tell us how to\nallocate costs to the income from that transaction.\nAnd what -- I mean, really the -- the first\npoint of departure that Mr. Geller made from the statute\nis that he suggests that only costs -- or that any -- the\ncosts must be factually related to an item of income to be\nset off against it. But that's not the statutory\nstandard.\nQUESTION: Well, this is kind of simplistic, but\nit does seem that in -- in the 1970s, Congress wanted to\nencourage exports, and to do that, they thought they\nshould make some income tax advantages for companies\nproducing products for export. And that involved allowing\ngrouping of products and favorable income tax treatment\nwhich, if you didn't have the -- the 861 regulations on\nR&D, would allow the taxpayer to do what the petitioner is\narguing here.\nSo, it seems to me the argument is that the 861-\nregs are just so contrary to DISC that they shouldn't\ngovern and don't govern. Is that the thrust of it?\nMR. JONES: Oh, clearly that's not the case.\nThe 861 regs were -- were formulated for the purpose of\ndetermining combined taxable income for DISCs and FSCs.\nThat's what Congress -- that's what the committee said\nthey wanted the Secretary to do under the DISC, and that's\nwhat the 861 -- if you look at 861(f)(1)(iii), it says\nthat expressly. So --\nQUESTION: But 861 applies generally, doesn't\nit, not just to DISCs?\nMR. JONES: It -- it applies generally, but it\nwas specifically formulated with the calculation of\ncombined taxable income for DISC in mind. And so it's --\nit's illogical to suggest, as -- as they do --\nQUESTION: The statute was, or the reg --\nQUESTION: You mean the reg?\nMR. JONES: I'm sorry. I meant the reg. The\n861-8 reg was -- was formulated with the calculation of\ncombined taxable income expressly in mind, and we know\nthat both by the terms of the reg 861-8(f) --\nQUESTION: Well, how do we know that?\nQUESTION: Getting back to Justice Scalia's\nquestion, and I think it relates to what Justice O'Connor\nis asking too, is -- is your answer to the last argument,\nthat a transaction-by-transaction basis -- we would --\nwould clearly not have this problem -- is we clearly would\nhave this problem and we'd look at 861, and you'd lose\nthere too? Or is that not your answer?\nMR. JONES: Well, that's one way of making the\npoint, but let me -- let me address directly --\nQUESTION: No, no. I want to know what your\nposition is.\nMR. JONES: Well, my position is they've totally\nmisdescribed the grouping provision of the DISC regs, and\nonce you understand it, you will appreciate that the 861-8\nregs apply to all of these transactions. And you can --\nyou can see that by looking at only two pieces of the DISC\nregs.\nThe DISC regs, at page 29a in the middle of the\npage, says, grouping of transactions for purposes of\napplying the pricing method is provided by (c)(7). So,\nyou group to decide what your pricing method is, and if\nthey choose the -- the combined taxable income method,\nwhich they've done here, then you go to (c)(6), which is\nback on page 33a.\n(c)(6) says here's how you determine combined\ntaxable income. You take the income. You deduct the\ncosts of goods sold, and then you allocate under\nprovisions of -- of section 861 regs. And then the\nprovision that Mr. Geller cites says -- is the (iv)\nprovision, which says you that allocate the costs to the\nitems of income resulting from the group. That's what the\ngrouping does. It groups the income, and then against\nthat income, we apply the costs allocated under the\nsection 861-8 regs. It is --\nQUESTION: Where is -- where that's last\nlanguage I'm looking for? It's on --\nMR. JONES: It's 33 of the petition appendix.\nQUESTION: 33a, yes.\nMR. JONES: It's the last phrase of the -- of\nthe item (iv), and it says that we allocate costs to the\nincome resulting from the grouping. Now, that's what the\ngrouping is all about. They're allowed to pick out a\nseries of transactions, group the income, calculate the\nCTI for the group, so they don't have to file a separate\nreport for a thousand different transactions. That's all\nthat the grouping is about.\nNow, that's been the Secretary's interpretation\nof his own regulations for 25 years. And of course, under\nthis Court's precedents, his interpretation of his own\nregulations is entitled to controlling weight unless it's\ninconsistent with the provisions of the text of the regs.\nAnd as the Tax Court explained in the St. Jude case, and\nas I have just described, the text of the reg says you\nallocate under 861 to the income resulting from the\ngrouping.\nQUESTION: All right, that's fine. But he says\nthat -- and what you're supposed to do is you're supposed\nto, I guess, subtract the costs which are allocated to the\nitems of gross income in that group.\nsupposed to do? You take the gross receipts in that\ngroup --\nMR. JONES: You take the gross receipts for that\ngroup --\nQUESTION: -- and you subtract the costs.\nMR. JONES: -- and then you allocate costs --\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. JONES: -- under 861.\nQUESTION: Right. Now, you allocate them\nunder 861.\nMR. JONES: Right.\nQUESTION: So we go to 861 --\nMR. JONES: Right.\nQUESTION: -- and he says, now, if you look at\n861, and try to allocate according to 861 to the group\nthat they've picked out, it's seriously nuts, basically.\nI mean, imagine that you had a farmer and the\nfarmer raised roses, and he had some fishes, and -- and\nwhat he has is he does research on fish diseases. And he\nsays -- you'd say, well, my goodness, you're going to\nallocate his whole laboratory costs which does nothing but\nfish diseases to the growing of roses because both are\nfarming or fisheries.\nNow, is it -- something like that is really out\nof whack, it makes so little sense that that isn't a\nreasonable method of allocation under anybody's theory.\nMR. JONES: That's -- that's a fair synopsis of\ntheir position, and -- and the defects in it --\nQUESTION: Right.\nQUESTION: So why is it reasonable to allocate\nthe fish disease research to rose culture?\nMR. JONES: Well, let me start with what the\nSecretary was supposed to do in the regs, and get to you\nthe answer to your question.\nThe -- the statute on which the regs are adopted\ndoesn't just say you allocate the costs that are\ndefinitely related to the product in determining what\ncosts would be charged against it. It also says you\nallocate to it a share of costs that cannot definitely be\nallocated to any particular item of income.\nNow, when the conundrum for research costs --\nand the reason that we have a separate regulation for it\nis that there's more than one way that research costs are\ntreated under the code. When research costs are\ncapitalized and amortized over their useful life, they're\nthen properly attributed -- as this Court said in\nINDOPCO -- to the revenues as they're received. But when\nthe taxpayer makes the election that section 174 gives it\nto take a current deduction, it severs any relationship\nbetween the costs and the income.\nas we say. There is no proper connection between the\ncosts and the income.\nNow, the reason that we need to -- the -- the --\nin that case where there is no definite relationship\nbetween the costs and the income, the default principle of\nthe statute is that the costs are to be allocated over all\nincome of the taxpayer, not just the income from any\nspecific product, but the income from --\nQUESTION: He'll grant you all that. He grants\nthat.\nMR. JONES: No --\nQUESTION: But he says, you know, sometimes it\nis clear. For example, it is clear that roses don't get\nfish diseases, and similarly, he says, it is equally clear\nthat -- I don't know the factual details, but he says it's\nequally clear that a 727 research is not as vague as a --\nis -- is different from a 757. Just the same -- roses and\nfish diseases. And he says where it's that clear, it's\nnot reasonable for the Treasury to try to pretend that\nit's vague or hard to allocate, et cetera.\nMR. JONES: The -- a reason why the regulation\nis reasonable is because if, as I have just said, the\nstatutory default cases -- you can apply it against all\nincome. What the Secretary has said is, well, I'm not\ngoing to make you apply it against all income. I'm going\nto make you apply it only against a subcategory of income,\nin this case, the income associated with sales of a\nproduct from which foreign sales income might be derived.\nQUESTION: Yes, but you use this link -- this\nseverance argument, and you say, oh, well, once you do\nthis, you sever the expense from the future income.\nI would have thought -- please correct me if I'm wrong --\nthat all expenses are -- are severed in the sense that all\nexpenses can be used for future income.\nMR. JONES: No. That's a -- that's a fallacy\nin -- in the suggestion of Mr. Geller that mismatching\noccurs all the time. It's very rare for mismatching to be\ntolerated. For example, if a taxpayer spends $10 building\na widget in year 1, and sells the widget in year 2, the\n$10 he spent in year 1 isn't mismatched. It's put in the\ninventory costs. It's charged as a component of the costs\nof goods sold in year 2, when the item is sold. The code\nis -- and the Secretary is very thorough about routinely\nrequiring matching of expenses.\nThis is an exceptional situation created by the\nCongress allowing the current deduction, but as Justice\nSouter pointed out, allowing the current deduction for\nresearch doesn't mean that that's -- that Congress decided\nit was definitely related when it was taken. It clearly\nisn't definitely related.\nAnd so my -- my point was that if it would have\nbeen reasonable for the Secretary to just do what the\nstatute says, which is we'll apply it against all income,\nit's more reasonable, the Secretary decided, to apply it\nagainst a smaller category. And then -- and then 5 or 7\nyears later, the Secretary decided it was even more\nreasonable to -- to apply it against a somewhat narrower\ncategory, and we got down to SIC code 3.\nWell, these are all alternatives, each of which\nis reasonable. They're more reasonable than the statutory\ndefault case, the Secretary decided.\nQUESTION: Under code 3, would there be any\ndifference? It was still transportation equipment as a\ncategory.\nMR. JONES: For Boeing, we can go all the way to\nSIC code category 4, which is planes and parts. I mean,\nthis -- this issue is sort of abstract in this case\nbecause whatever, you know, objective test the Secretary\nhad used, it would result in the same in -- in this case.\nQUESTION: Where does the statute say you could\njust apply it across the board? By -- the statute in 994\nthat I have just refers to 50 percent of the combined\ntaxable income, and that doesn't define --\nMR. JONES: I'm talking about section 861, which\nis at page 26a of the petition appendix.\nQUESTION: 26a, yes.\nMR. JONES: And subpart -- part (b) in the\nmiddle says that you allocate a ratable part. It says\npar, but I think that's ratable part of expenses which\ncannot definitely be allocated to some item or class of\ngross income. So you -- and you -- you would under the\ndefault case make that allocation across all items of\nincome.\nQUESTION: Well, his argument is that it can --\nthat -- that the research on fish can definitely be\nallocated to fish.\nMR. JONES: If -- if it's currently deducted, it\ncannot be definitely allocated to an item of income. You\nsee, petitioner just takes two words out of the statute\nand changes them. The statute says you allocate costs\nthat cannot be definitely allocated to an item of income.\nAnd he says, well, we allocate costs that are factually\nrelated to a product. Well, that's not what the statute\neither says, or is about. We allocate costs to income not\nto products.\nNow, the --\nQUESTION: It says item or class of gross\nincome.\nMR. JONES: Right.\nQUESTION:\nincome?\nMR. JONES: Well, for example, if they group\nproducts, they -- they group all the sales of Boeing 707s.\nThen you allocate the costs to that group based on the\ncosts that can be directly allocated.\nQUESTION: For that year.\nMR. JONES: -- and they share --\nQUESTION: You're saying it has to be that year.\nMR. JONES: Yes, and a share of the costs that\ncannot be directly allocated to an item -- to any item of\nincome.\nNow, this -- the reasonableness of this -- of\nthe Secretary's approach is especially clear in light of\nthe alternatives that he faced. If he had adopted the --\nthe position that petitioner prefers, the result would be\nthat petitioner would claim an expense against a product\nthat was going to be built and sold some other time, and\nnever charge that expense against that product when it's\nsold.\nNow, the obvious and unimpeachable result of\nthat is they overstate their foreign sales income. And in\nthis case, they do it by $2 billion over the period that's\nat stake. They overstate their foreign source income,\nwhich has the direct consequence of overstating the -- the\nDISC and FSC benefits that they calculate based on that\namount of combined taxable income.\nQUESTION: But isn't it true, just going back to\nJustice O'Connor's thought, that -- that the\nconsequence -- the Government's position is that all\nresearch and development cost gets allocated to the DISC\nwhen you're in a business like they are?\nMR. JONES: I think that's -- I don't understand\nthe factual context of that statement, but the -- the\nanswer is all research costs, like every other type of\ncost gets charged against the income -- against foreign\nsales income to the extent that --\nQUESTION: Proportionately.\nMR. JONES: Proportionally, yes, thank you.\nPro rata if it's not current -- you know, if it's\ncurrently claimed and not capitalized and amortized.\nIf it's capitalized and amortized -- I should\njust point out because it's -- it is a factual point that\nis worth knowing. If it's capitalized and amortized, then\nthe costs are recovered as part of the cost of goods\nsold --\nQUESTION: No. I -- I understand the\ndistinction between capitalizing it and -- and taking it\nin the current year. But it seems to me that -- that\nthe -- the net result of the Government's approach is\nthat -- that all of the -- all of the research and\ndevelopment expense of the company would be attributable\nto the DISC.\nMR. JONES: It would just be attributable to\nthe -- to -- well, I mean --\nQUESTION: If -- if the DISC is 25 percent of\nits sales --\nMR. JONES: If all --\nQUESTION: -- 25 percent of its R&D --\nMR. JONES: Correct. If all the sales were DISC\nsales, then -- then you would be right. But if -- if some\nportion of the sales were domestic, which is certainly the\ncase with Boeing, then that portion would be allocated to\nthat portion of the income. I mean, this pro rata\nallocation that I've been talking about, that what you're\nallocating between is the sales that the DISC makes and\nthe sales that the DISC doesn't make.\nQUESTION: What are the -- just out of\ncuriosity, what are the rough proportions of -- of\noverseas and domestic sales?\nMR. JONES: I believe the record says something\nlike two-thirds of Boeing's sales during this whole\n10-year period were overseas and, therefore, I assume,\nmade through the DISC.\nQUESTION: But just as a housekeeping matter, if\nBoeing were to prevail here, would it still be open for\nthe Government to say, well, all right, you can allocate\nalong your product lines, but the Blue Sky portion still\nhas to be greatly increased?\nMR. JONES: You mean, would it be open at this\nstage --\nQUESTION: I think I've got the right color.\nThe Red Sky and the Blue Sky. The Blue Sky is the\ngeneral. Correct?\nMR. JONES: Yes. At this stage of --\nQUESTION: And that was about some 20 percent.\nIf -- if the -- if Boeing prevails, can you still go back\nand say, okay, you get the product line, but you've got to\nadd another 20, 30 percent to the Blue Sky?\nMR. JONES: I hate to make a concession that I'm\nnot 100 percent certain -- certain about, but --\nespecially since, you know, it -- it could be of\nimportance. I do not believe that issue is open, but\nit -- but if it were, I would reserve our right to address\nthat. But I don't -- I don't know exactly how it would be\nopen.\nQUESTION: Mr. Jones, I thought -- maybe I'm\nconfused, but I thought the Government's position was Blue\nSky, product-specific -- this is R&D and we treat R&D a\ncertain way and we don't buy into that line, which is set\nby the company.\nMR. JONES: Oh, I agree completely, but -- but I\nunderstood Justice Kennedy to be saying that if the Court\nadopted Boeing's approach, would there then be a factual\nquestion about what part -- whether the Blue Sky amount\nwas accurately described in the record. And I just don't\nknow for certain. My assumption is that that's not still\nopen.\nQUESTION: Is -- is it open as to -- suppose\nthe -- you were to say the following. Where a taxpayer\ncan show that a particular R&D expense can be definitely\nallocated to some item or class of gross income, other\nthan the DISC class in this situation or whatever, where\nthey can show that, then the commissioner cannot require\nthem to allocate it to a different item.\nMR. JONES: Well, it -- I --\nQUESTION: That would be just taking the words\nof the statute. Now, suppose you said that.\nMR. JONES: It sounds -- it sounds like you\ncorrectly described the statute, and let me point out that\nif they, for example, did their fish research or whatever\nit was --\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. JONES: -- and they capitalized and\namortized it to the -- to the appropriate products and\ncharged it, then -- then they would be entitled to --\nQUESTION: So -- so that's what -- that's what I\nfind difficult to reconcile with the 861 -- 861-8 -- what\nis it called? It's 861-8 --\nMR. JONES: (e) --\nQUESTION: -- (3) --\nMR. JONES: (3)(i).\nQUESTION: -- et cetera -- sentence which says\nbut you have to use two-digit SIC categories because\nI think they're so broad, those categories, that it should\nbe possible, like my fish example, to find instances where\nyou could. And why aren't they in that category?\nMR. JONES: First, it only -- that only applies\nif they're deducted under 174. So -- so we've narrowed\nthe issue that much. And when they're deducted under 174,\nas I've said, there were a series of reasonable\nalternatives facing the Secretary based from the statutory\ndefault case that you allocated across all income.\nNow, the reason I keep stressing that point is\nbecause this Court's decisions are very clear that the\nCourt, especially in the context of Treasury regulations,\ndoesn't sit here to decide the wisdom of the particular\nrule chosen. It only -- in the words of Correll -- looks\nto see whether some reasonable method was applied, not\nwhether this was the best one, or the most logical --\nQUESTION:\nyou're doing is -- is quarreling with the decision\nCongress made under 174. Congress said R&D is inherently\nsomething that ought to be capitalized, but we think it's\nso important, it's going to be expensed. And you keep\nsaying that, well, you know, really it can't be expensed.\nWe're going to, in effect, make them capitalize it anyway.\nThat -- that's --\nMR. JONES: No. We're -- we're not making them\ncapitalize it. I mean, I would cite, really, my\nexplanation of that as Justice Souter's question earlier,\nthat -- which is that the -- the decision to allow this\ncurrent deduction is effective in determining taxable\nincome for domestic purposes. We don't dispute that\nthere's a deduction, but I'll point out 861 -- the mere\nfact there's a deduction doesn't tell you how to allocate\nit. And the -- 861 says that if the deduction is not\ndefinitely related to some item of income, then you charge\nit against all the items of income.\nQUESTION: Can -- can I come back to the Blue\nSky expenses? A question that was asked earlier caused me\nto question my understanding of the case.\nAs I understand it, Boeing is willing to accept\na ratable portion of the Blue -- Blue Sky expenses in its\nDISC. Right?\nMR. JONES: Yes.\nQUESTION: Just a -- what it -- what it's\nobjecting to is -- is those expenses that -- you know,\nthat -- that go to fish research, those expenses that are\nidentifiable to a particular category.\nMR. JONES: Just to elaborate, that go to fish\nresearch that that -- that were deducted currently rather\nthan amortized over the proper future income. That's --\nthat's what this case is really all about is this\npeculiarity --\nQUESTION: But that's the whole scheme that\nCongress passed in the '70s to try to encourage exports.\nSo it just -- the interpretation of 861 in the regs seems\nto go somewhat contrary to the overall purpose of the\nscheme for DISCs.\nMR. JONES: Several -- several courts have\ncorrectly said that the purpose of the -- of the combined\ntaxable income calculation is to serve as a limit on the\nDISC and FSC benefits. Congress didn't intend unlimited\nbenefits. They didn't intend to allow benefits of the\ntype that Boeing is seeking where they inflate their\nforeign source income by not -- not putting the costs\nagainst that income in calculating it.\nAnd so, the answer to your question is no. The\nSecretary's rule is designed to accomplish the correct, in\nthe Secretary's view, determination of combined taxable\nincome for this very purpose.\nNow, it -- I think that -- that the issue\nthat -- that may actually be the one the Court wants to\nconsider first is that in 1984, when Congress enacted the\nFSC provision, it -- it in our view ratified and adopted\nthe very cost -- research cost allocation regulation that\nwe have in this case. In -- in the Deficit Reduction Act\nof 1984, there are two provisions that relate to this\ncase. Congress adopted -- enacted the FSC which, of\ncourse, is based on the provisions of the DISC, and -- and\nit also contains the combined taxable income method of\nlimiting the -- the benefit. And -- and at the same time\nthat they adopted the FSC, they enacted a provision that\ntook one piece of this regulation out and suspended it.\nThat's the piece called geographic sourcing. That, for\npurposes of citation, is 1.861-8(e)(3)(ii).\nThis case is about 1.861-8(e)(3)(i), which is\nthe rule that calculates combined taxable income. And\nwhen Congress took out -- said we're going to suspend this\ngeographic sourcing rule in this regulation, they said,\nwe're not suspending this regulation for application in\ncalculating combined taxable income for DISCs and FSCs.\nWell, under this Court's decision in\nLorillard v. Pons, that is a ratification and adoption of\nthe regulation.\nthat when a --\nQUESTION: Can I -- Mr. Jones, can I go back for\njust a second -- and be sure I understand something\nright -- to the fish/roses hypothetical? Am I correct in\nassuming that the fishes -- the research on the fishes\nwould be charged to the DISC only if fishes and roses were\nin the same SIC grouping?\nMR. JONES: Under any scenario, that's correct.\nQUESTION: Oh. So if they're in a different\ngrouping, then the rose farmer wouldn't have to pay for\nthe fish research.\nMR. JONES: That's correct. I was assuming you\ncarefully constructed your question.\nQUESTION: But the -- but the grouping can be as\nbroad as -- as transportation equipment.\nMR. JONES: It can be quite broad.\nQUESTION: That's a pretty broad group.\nMR. JONES: It can be quite broad. But the\npoint is that it's not --\nQUESTION: And it includes, by the way,\nagriculture, forestry, and fisheries. That's one\ncategory.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. JONES: It's not -- it's -- the point is\nit's not as broad as the statutory default rule. The\nstatutory default rule is by definition reasonable, and\nthe -- the narrower rule that the -- that the --\nQUESTION: You've lost me. The statutory\ndefault rule --\nMR. JONES: Is that you apply these costs\nagainst all items of income because they're not definitely\nrelated to an item of income. That's the statutory\ndefault principle.\nQUESTION: Where is that?\nMR. JONES: That's in 861(b) at page 26a of the\npetition appendix. It says that --\nQUESTION: Got you.\nMR. JONES: Okay.\nNow, on the ratification point, Lorillard v.\nPons makes the point that when Congress enacts a statute\nthat's based upon a -- a prior -- the provisions of a\nprior act, it is assumed to have adopted the -- the\nadministrative interpretation. Now, that's not a -- by\nitself an overpowering presumption, but what Lorillard\npointed out was that when Congress, in doing that, looks\nat the agency's interpretation and excised a portion of\nit, the inference that it approved the remaining part is\nvery strong.\nNow, here, it's strong not only because of that\ninference, but because Congress said -- I'm sorry -- the\ncommittee that made this amendment said that they --\nalthough they were excising this part about geographic\nsourcing, that the part about combined taxable income\ncalculations for DISCs and FSCs would remain in effect.\nNow, petitioner says, but 2 years later Congress\ndid something that somehow negates at that ratification.\nWell, of course, the sub -- Congress can't change the law\nas ratified, but that's not what happened in '86 in any\nevent. What happened in '86 was that the -- the committee\nwhat was -- that was removing the suspension of the -- on\nthe geographic sourcing rule said that we're not saying\nwhether the regulation is valid or not. Well, the\nregulation that they were talking about was the geographic\nsourcing rule. Petitioner says, well, they were talking\nabout the whole rule. No. They were talking about the\ngeographic sourcing rule as we know from the last part of\nthat same report which says that nothing in this act has\nanything to do with the use of these -- of the -- of the\nresearch cost allocation regulations for calculating\nCTI -- combined taxable income -- for DISC and FSC\npurposes.\nQUESTION: Correct me if I'm wrong. In the\ncourt of appeals opinion -- and it's the paragraph at\n12(a). I think you'll be familiar with this one, where\nthe court of appeals said, the more narrowly a taxpayer\nchooses to define incomes, the more costs become\nindirectly or indefinitely related. Can I be excused from\ntrying to understand that, or --\n(Laughter.)\nMR. JONES: Well, I can try to help, but I'm --\nI can't promise results. It -- it looked to me like what\nthey had in mind was the thought that this -- that a\ntaxpayer who says my research only relates to wing nuts\non -- on this plane is -- is defining it so narrowly that\nit's not realistic. And -- and indeed, the record of this\ncase reflects that -- that research on one type of plane\nhas applications on other types of planes. And -- and I\nthink what the court was addressing there was his view\nthat -- that this was an appropriate accommodation. This\nwas one of the choices that the Secretary had. It was a\nreasonable choice.\nQUESTION: It really was restating the problem\nrather than offering a specific solution.\nMR. JONES: I think it was restating the problem\nin a way that indicated it felt that the Secretary's\nchoice was a reasonable one.\nQUESTION: Mr. Jones, can you tell us this\ncontinuing significance of this arrangement? I -- we're\nnow past the successor of the FSC. Is that true?\nMR. JONES: Yes.\nIt was replaced by the extraterritorial income\nprovisions -- maybe in '98. I'm not sure.\nQUESTION: What about the two-digit SIC? Is\nthat still with --\nMR. JONES: Two-digit is -- it was replaced by\nthe -- the narrower three-digit band in '94, I believe.\nQUESTION: So if we thought the two-digit was a\nlittle bit going too far, would that throw open all kinds\nof claims on the -- on the -- from all kinds of people?\nMR. JONES: Well, I mean, again, if the Court\nwanted -- felt it needed to look at the two-digit versus\nthree-digit, although to me they're just, you know,\nspectrums along the --\nQUESTION: The degree of specificity -- well, at\nleast three-digit would separate the roses from the fish.\nMR. JONES: This case really doesn't present the\nquestion --\nQUESTION: It doesn't.\nMR. JONES: -- because, as I said, there's\njust -- is -- there's no question that Boeing goes all the\nway to SIC 4. And so if the standard is are the products\nreasonably related, which -- which is --\nQUESTION: So we don't have to consider it. All\nwe'd have to --\nMR. JONES:\nit, but if you did, I think you would do it in the context\nof realizing these are reasonable alternatives, and that\nthe Secretary didn't have to pick the best one. He just\nhad to pick one of them. And I -- if you thought that\nnone of these were reasonable, then -- then, you know, it\nwouldn't matter which one he picked.\nQUESTION: At some point they certainly --\nMR. JONES: If there are no further questions,\nthank you.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Jones.\nMr. Geller, you have a little over 2 minutes\nleft.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF KENNETH S. GELLER\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. GELLER: So much to say.\nJustice Kennedy, I think you put your heart on\nthe -- on the Government's -- the -- the problem with the\nGovernment's position here. It's simply an unwillingness\nto accept the fact that Congress created a number of\nincentives here that were not designed simply to raise\nrevenue. They had other purposes such as the export --\nthe -- the beneficial treatment of export income and also\nthe immediate deductibility of -- of R&D.\nNow, the Government tries to defend this\nregulation here on the -- on the basis that there's this\ntemporal mismatch and it's all the result of not\ncapitalizing. I should say a number of things about that.\nFirst, this was not the basis for the regulation\nat the time the regulation was issued. It was not the\nbasis for defending this regulation in the lower courts.\nAnd it -- and the Government's position is not even\nconsistent with that regulation because if the whole\nproblem here is the lack of a temporal mismatch, you would\nthink that if you had a class of gross income in which in\na particular year there was both revenues and R&D\nexpenses, well, in that situation there's no temporal\nmismatch. They would at least allow you to allocate those\nR&D expenses to that revenue in that year. No. Even if\nthere's revenue in a class of gross income in a particular\nyear, they still insist that those R&D expenses be spread\nacross all of the income in that SIC code.\nNow, I want to mention St. Jude, because in this\ncase we're dealing with airplanes and airplanes, and while\nthe -- the costs are specifically allocated only to\nparticular programs, it gets a little more complicated.\nBut look at St. Jude. In St. Jude, you had a\nmanufacturer who was exporting artificial heart valves.\nThat's all it was doing, is manufacturing and exporting\nartificial heart valves. In the same year, it was\nengaging in R&D for insulin pumps, and for pacemakers.\nThe Government insisted that the export income from the\nsale of those heart valves be reduced, and that the DISC\nbenefit be reduced because of the R&D spent on these other\nproducts that obviously had no basis or relevance to the\nsale of the heart valve simply because they were all\nwithin the broad -- same broad SIC code.\nAnd I should say, Justice Kennedy, the Ninth\nCircuit's opinion I think is somewhat unintelligible.\nThe -- the part that you -- you referred to, we all\nstumbled over because it makes no sense. The more\nnarrowly -- the more narrowly you define your classes of\ngross income, the more that -- that costs will be directly\nallocated to more than one class of income. It's not a\nquestion of anything being indirectly allocated.\nAnd there's no default rule at issue here either\nbecause all of our costs are directly allocable to\nspecific programs. That's all we ask that we be allowed\nto do.\nWe ask that the judgment in the Ninth Circuit be\nreversed. Thank you.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you, Mr. Geller.\n"
