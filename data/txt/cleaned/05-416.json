PERKELL: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe question presented in this case is whether,\nin enacting the Prison Litigation Reform Act's exhaustion\nrequirement, Congress intended to require inmates to\ncomply with administrative grievance procedures or whether\nCongress intended to permit inmates to ignore those\nprocedures.\nPetitioners submit that Congress intended to\nrequire inmates to comply with administrative grievance\nprocedures, for three principal reasons:\nOne, the established principle of exhaustion in\nthe administrative law context requires a grievance -- a\ngrievant to timely comply with administrative agency\nproceedings.\nTwo, in enacting the Prison Litigation Reform\nAct's exhaustion requirement, Congress was responding to\nthis Court's decision in McCarthy v. Madigan, in which\nthis Court presumed that an express or mandatory\nexhaustion requirement for prisoners would necessitate\ncompliance with prison filing deadlines.\nAnd, three, Congress's objectives in enacting\nthe Prison Litigation Reform Act's exhaustion requirement\nare directly facilitated by a rule in which inmates must\ncomply with administrative grievance procedures, including\nfiling deadlines; whereas, those objectives are invariably\nsubverted when an inmate is permitted to ignore those\nprocedures.\nIn the administrative law context, the\nestablished principle of exhaustion generally requires\nthat a grievant comply with administrative agency\nproceedings in a proper and timely manner in order to be\nable to proceed to Federal Court. In this case, Congress\nhas, indeed, enacted an administrative exhaustion\nrequirement. Even the court of appeals agreed that in so doing\nCongress was attempting to bring the exhaustion rule for\nprisoners more into line with established administrative\nexhaustion rules that apply in other contexts.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: What do you say to the argument\nthat that really is an inapposite argument because the 1983\nproceeding is de novo?\nMS. PERKELL: I would suggest -- I -- we concede\nthere's that distinction. However, I would suggest it's\nirrelevant for purposes of how Congress would have\nunderstood the term \"exhaust\" in enacting the statute.\nThe definition of the \"principle of exhaustion\" in\nadministrative law is one in which there's an obligation\nto comply with the agency's grievance proceedings. And\nso, that is the definition of exhaustion that Congress was\npresumably -- I would suggest was presumably invoking in\nthis context.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But that's the -- a function\nof -- you want the first-line decisionmaker -- you need\nthat decision, because, at the second rung, in -- at the\ncourt level, deference is owed to it. But in the prison\nsetting, there's no deference owed to it. So, I would\nthink that this kind of requirement, that you must file\nsomeplace else first, a place that won't get deference, is\nmore like the EEOC example and the Age Discrimination Act.\nMS. PERKELL: Well, Your Honor, in the first\ninstance --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry, Ms. Perkell,\ncould I ask you to speak up just a bit?\nMS. PERKELL: Oh, sure. I --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thanks.\nMS. PERKELL: -- I apologize.\nAgain, we're submitting that Congress understood\nthe term \"exhaust\" in a particular way, given how it's\njust generally used in the administrative context. And\nwith respect to the EEOC context, we think that that is\ninapposite, because primarily that -- the relevant\nstatutes in those contexts invoke the word \"commence,\"\nwhich --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Invoke what?\nMS. PERKELL: The word \"commence\" instead of\n\"exhaust,\" which this Court has expressly, again,\ndistinguished from an exhaustion requirement.\nMoreover, under those statutes Congress has\nlimited the meaning of \"commencement\" in such a way that\nthis Court has interpreted Congress to expressly preclude\nthe possibility of a procedural default by virtue of a\nfailure to comply with State filing provisions.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Are you -- are you saying,\nthen, that those two go together, they're inextricably\ntied together? If you've got an exhaustion rule, then\nembedded in it is always a procedural default rule?\nMS. PERKELL: I'm suggesting in that -- in the\n-- excuse me -- in the administrative law context, which\nis the context in which Congress was legislating under\nthis statute, that that is, indeed, the established\nconception of that term.\nJUSTICE BREYER: They're saying that it's\nspecial here. If you look at the language of the text,\nthe language talks -- is almost identical to the language\nthat was in CRIPA, or whatever is -- you know, CRIPA. Is\nthat the correct pronunciation of the concatenation of --\nMS. PERKELL: I'm sorry, I'm not sure what Your\nHonor --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I'm think -- oh, well, I guess\nit isn't -- unlike IIRIRA, it is apparently unknown.\nMS. PERKELL: Oh.\nJUSTICE BREYER: There was a predecessor act,\nand the predecessor act used this same language, just\nabout. And what it said was, \"Judge, you may require\nexhaustion of such remedies as are available.\" And, given\nthat language, nobody thought that was a procedure default\nrule; it just meant the judge, if there's a remedy\navailable, can say, \"Prisoner, go do it,\" in an\nappropriate case. And all that happened here, if you look\nat the history, is, they changed the \"may\" to a \"must.\"\nAnd all the people that wrote in were writing in about\nthat. Nobody dreamt, nobody said, nothing suggests, that\nwhat Congress intended to do was to bring in the\nprocedural default aspect of it. And there would have\nbeen a lot of objections if they had. So, that's the\nargument the other way.\nNow, I'd like to know what do you have at all\nthat overcomes what I just said?\nMS. PERKELL: Well, I would suggest that, in\npart, the language of the CRIPA, which is -- I believe, is\n-- that's how I pronounce it; I believe that's what Your\nHonor is referring to -- in part, precluded the\npossibility of a default -- procedural default bar largely\nbecause it required a continuance of a case for 90 -- or I\nbelieve it started out as 180 days, and then became 90\ndays. And -- in order to permit the judge to order the\ninmate to go back and exhaust -- and under those\ncircumstances, even if he had been untimely by virtue of\nthe continuance language, he was, nonetheless, permitted\nto return to Federal Court. So, I think by virtue of the\nlanguage of the statute, it's at least possible that\nCongress had a -- deliberately excluded that possibility.\nMoreover, I think that the statutory history and\nthe statutory purposes in this case support the conclusion\nthat Congress intended inmates to require with applicable\ngrievance proceedings.\nAnd if I may refer to the statutory history, in\nthis Court -- excuse me, in Booth v. Churner, this Court\nrecognized that this Court's prior decision in McCarthy v.\nMadigan constituted a substantial portion of the statutory\nhistory from the PLRA's exhaustion requirement. And, in\nrelevant part, for purposes of the question presented here,\nthat decision observed that -- or assumed that an exhaustion --\na mandatory exhaustion requirement for prisoners would\nnecessitate the compliance of administrative filing\ndeadlines.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But that was a comment made\nwhen the decision itself held that there was no\nexhaustion. The -- wasn't that so? I mean, the holding\nin Madigan was in favor of the Petitioner.\nMS. PERKELL: That is so. This Court --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I mean McCarthy.\nMS. PERKELL: This Court made that observation.\nIt was one of two grounds upon which this Court relied in\nholding that this Court would not judicially impose a\nmandatory exhaustion requirement for prisoners under that\ndecision. So, the first part of the decision evaluated\nthe text of the former version of 1997(e), and, in the\nsecond part of this decision, this Court said,\n\"Nonetheless, notwithstanding that the statute doesn't\nexpressly require exhaustion, we will not judicially\nimpose exhaustion in this case for the reason that such a\nrequirement would, indeed, represent a possibility of\nforfeiture of a claim for an inmate's failure to comply\nwith deadlines.\"\nAnd, again, as this Court recognized in Booth v.\nChurner, that decision is a significant part of the\nstatutory history of this provision, and this Court\npresumed that Congress was responding to that decision\nwhen it revised 1997(e).\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, there was -- in\nMcCarthy, itself, the wording was something that -- of the\nkind proposed. And so, it's not clear whether it's\nreferring to -- what was proposed was a rule that would\nincorporate a procedural default motion. It's not clear,\njust from the -- reading that opinion.\nMS. PERKELL: Your Honor, I would respectfully\ndispute that, in that our reading of the opinion, as well\nas the Government's brief in that case, seemed to propose\nno unusual rule of exhaustion. It appeared that the rule\nof exhaustion that was being discussed was an ordinary\nrule of exhaustion. So, I don't believe that there was\nanything unusual about the exhaustion concept that was at\nissue in that case.\nFinally, I would submit that Congress's purposes\nin enacting --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Before you get to the purposes,\nyou quote in your brief -- the only legislative history I\ncould find here -- you said that Congressman LoBiondo\nreferred to McCarthy, which you find relevant, because\nMcCarthy indicated that the word \"exhaustion\" would carry\nalong with it a procedural default rule. So, what did the\nCongressman say?\nMS. PERKELL: What did Representative LoBiondo --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Uh-huh.\nMS. PERKELL: -- say?\nJUSTICE BREYER: Uh-huh.\nMS. PERKELL: The significance of excerpting\nthat provision was to, in part, demonstrate that Congress\nwas, indeed, aware, consistent --\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. So, I take it from\nyour answer he didn't really say anything helpful to you\n--\nMS. PERKELL: He --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- except to refer to the name\nof the case --\nMS. PERKELL: Well --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- in which case, what we have\non the -- all right. Is that right?\nMS. PERKELL: Your Honor, I think there are two\nrelevant things about that statement. First is the\nsignificance of his referencing the McCarthy case and\ndemonstrating affirmatively that Congress was, indeed,\naware of that decision when it revised the statute. But,\nmoreover, it was another iteration of the purposes that\nCongress sought to achieve through enactment of the\nstatute.\nSo, speaking to the third point, which was\npurposes of the statute, our position is that those\npurposes are directly served by a rule in which inmates\nare required to comply with administrative grievance\nproceedings.\nBy contrast, those rules are subverted by a rule\nin which an inmate is permitted to file an untimely\nappeal, which is rejected on procedural grounds, and\nwhich, therefore, receives the benefit of no prior\nadministrative review.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: In thinking --\nMS. PERKELL: It's --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- of what Congress might\nhave meant, one part of the picture is, we're not dealing\nwith statutes of limitations enacted by legislatures.\nWe're dealing with grievance procedures that vary from\nState to State, and maybe even from prison to prison. And\nsome of them have a very short span. I think the brief\nsaid some of them are 2, 3, 5 days.\nMS. PERKELL: That is correct. Those were\nproceedings that were noted on one of the briefs. I think\nit's reasonable to presume that Congress was aware of the\nvariety of prison filing deadlines when it enacted this\nstatute. And I also think that it's reasonable to presume\nthat Congress intended for those -- for whatever grievance\nprocedure the State sets forth to be governing in this\ninstance. And this is because, under the former version\nof the statute, the CRIPA, Congress had required that\ngrievance proceedings comply with specified standards,\nspecified Federal standards. And in the new version of\nthe statute, Congress dispensed with those requirements.\nAnd I think that the obvious conclusion to draw from that\nchange was that Congress was intending for -- whatever\nprison procedures are established in any given situation\nare those that are going to govern the inmate's appeal\nprocess.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: So, you would treat a State\nwith a 2-day statute of limitations just like your State,\nwith a 15-day statute.\nMS. PERKELL: I think the -- always, the\nrelevant inquiry, especially in light of the statute -- or\nprecisely because of the statutory language, the inquiry\nis whether or not remedies are, indeed, available and\ncapable of use by the inmates. So, without any further\nfacts, yes, I would treat a 2-day --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: It was --\nMS. PERKELL: -- filing period.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- available for 2 days, so\nthat satisfies -- so, I suppose it would be okay for 6\nhours, too.\nMS. PERKELL: It could conceivably be. As\nlong as remedies are, indeed,\navailable to the inmate, there is an obligation under the\nstatute that he exhaust --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Is that --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I suppose --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- plausible?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I suppose there can\nalways be a specific objection to the reasonable\navailability of a particular remedy. I mean, if this --\nthe prison remedy is, you know, within 5 minutes you've\ngot to file a complaint or something. But that's not the\nquestion here. The question here is what the PLRA\nrequires, as a general matter, with respect to prison\nremedies.\nMS. PERKELL: Yes, Your Honor, that is correct.\nAnd as -- we are submitting that it does, indeed,\nrequire compliance with the administrative grievance --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Would you agree that there's a\nrequirement that the exhaustion period be reasonable?\nMS. PERKELL: I'm -- I -- the requirement that I\nthink is relevant under the statute is whether or not the\nprocedure is available.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Conceivably, if it's too short,\nit's not reasonably available. I guess --\nMS. PERKELL: That is -- yes, Your Honor, that\nis --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Okay.\nMS. PERKELL: -- that is a conceivable --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's conceivable.\nMS. PERKELL: -- conceivable --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well --\nMS. PERKELL: -- scenario.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- what do you --\nMS. PERKELL: I --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- what do you make of the fact\nthat there was prior law that required -- I forget its\nexact words, but something like \"reasonable procedure,\"\nand that language was repealed?\nMS. PERKELL: I presume, from that, that\nCongress had shifted its focus in the new statute to the\npurposes that we have articulated in the brief, one of\nthem being --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, if that's -- if that's\nthe case, then, on your own reasoning, you can't assume\nthat there's -- that availability requires any reasonable\navailability. It's got to be availability as, I guess, a\nphysical possibility, and that's all.\nMS. PERKELL: I would agree with that, Your\nHonor. That is our --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Do you find --\nMS. PERKELL: -- position.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- it plausible that Congress,\nin effect, would have intended these -- the statute of\nlimitations on 1983 to be truncated in that way?\nMS. PERKELL: Yes, Your Honor, I do believe\nthat. Congress was legislating, enacted this statute for\nthe purpose of addressing a particular category of section\n1983 actions in which it appears that Congress reached the\nconclusion that there was be -- there was an abuse of that\nprocess under 1983. And so, the purpose of -- what this\n--\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but the abuse was not\ncoming from people who filed -- or the -- let's say the\nline that identifies the abuse was not a line between\nthose who file a grievance within 2 days and those who do\nnot. I mean, that's -- that -- it's true, if you -- if\nyou have a 2-hour statute of limitations, you're going to\nkeep out a lot of cases, but it's not a tool that is\nparticularly suited to the problem that Congress was\ndealing with, which is frivolous actions.\nMS. PERKELL: Well, Your Honor, I would first\ndispute that a 2-hour time limitation would necessarily\nkeep out a lot of cases. As long as it's an available\nremedy --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Wouldn't you like to have a 2-\nhour time limit?\n[Laughter.]\nMS. PERKELL: Your Honor, it --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: You'd have a lot -- you know, a\nlot more time at the park.\n[Laughter.]\nMS. PERKELL: Your Honor, it wouldn't\nnecessarily be my preference, but I certainly wouldn't\nsuggest that it was a remedy unavailable or incapable of\nuse by anyone, if you take into consideration other\naspects of the prison grievance procedure.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: May I --\nMS. PERKELL: So --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: May I ask you just one thing\n--\nMS. PERKELL: Yes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- about how this operates\nand who reviews what? One of the claims that was made --\nthis prisoner filed twice. And, the second time, as I\nrecall, he said, \"Every day that I'm here, the clock\nstarts running again, because this is a continuing\nviolation. I'm restricted today, and I'll be restricted\ntomorrow.\" And there was no -- is that something that\nwould be reviewable in court?\nMS. PERKELL: I think what -- in this -- as\noccurred in this case, the inmate has made this contention\nthat there was a continuing violation. It would be\nincumbent upon the district court to evaluate that\nquestion under the grievance proceeding at issue and under\nthe facts --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, what --\nMS. PERKELL: -- as presented.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- role would govern whether\na continuing violation occurred? Would it be --\nMS. PERKELL: I would suggest that the law of\nthe prison grievance proceeding.\nIf there's --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And what is the law of the\nprison grievance proceeding on that point?\nMS. PERKELL: Well, in California the\nrequirement is that an inmate must file a grievance within\n15 working days or 3 weeks of the event or decision at\nissue. The facts in this case --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, he -- that -- his point\nis that the event at issue happens every day.\nMS. PERKELL: Well, I would submit that the\nfacts of this case actually show that the events at issue\nare the two decisions that were made which resulted in\nconsequences with which the inmate was dissatisfied.\nThose two decisions were the first decision --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But your -- but your point --\nyour -- whatever the internal grievance procedure is,\nthere's no judge that would decide that, which you said,\nthis is all for the internal procedure.\nMS. PERKELL: That is correct. And, again, the\ndistrict court could be called upon to address that\nquestion, as appears to be the case here, and the district\ncourt would endeavor to apply the rules of the grievance\nproceeding to the facts regarding exhaustion. If, in the\nevent the grievance proceeding didn't, for instance,\nsufficiently put the inmate on notice, didn't provide\nclarity on whether or not -- on what he had to do under\ncircumstances where there's a continuing consequence to a\ndecision, perhaps in that instance it would be appropriate\nfor the district court to decide, yes, indeed, he had\nexhausted, given the ambiguity on that point in the\nregulations.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Ms. --\nMS. PERKELL: If --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- Perkell, perhaps\nyou'd like to save your remaining --\nMS. PERKELL: Yes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- time for rebuttal.\nMS. PERKELL: Thank you, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you.\nMr. Himmelfarb, we'll hear now from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF DAN HIMMELFARB\nFOR THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,\nIN SUPPORT OF PETITIONERS\nMR. HIMMELFARB: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe United States agrees with Petitioners'\nsubmission that the Ninth Circuit's decision is\ninconsistent with the text, history, and purposes of the\nPLRA exhaustion requirement. We would add that the Ninth\nCircuit's decision has consequences that Congress could\nnot have intended.\nTo begin with, under the Ninth Circuit's\ninterpretation, a prisoner can wait years to file an\nadministrative claim, such that it is virtually certain\nthat the prison will reject the claim as untimely and not\ndecide the claim on the merits. That is hardly different\nfrom not requiring an exhaustion requirement -- not\nrequiring exhaustion at all. Indeed, Respondent candidly\nconcedes -- this is on page 43 of his brief -- that, under\nhis interpretation, if the prison system does not give\nprison decisionmakers any discretion to decide an untimely\nclaim, the prisoner would not have to file an\nadministrative claim at all. All he would have to do is\nwait for the filing deadline to pass.\nIn addition, if the Ninth Circuit's\ninterpretation is correct, the PLRA would be the only\ncontext in the law in which a claimant who is required to\nexhaust would be able to get into Federal Court by virtue\nof untimely exhaustion; that is, without complying with\nfiling deadlines. It would be odd, to put it mildly, if\nCongress intended to adopt such a uniquely forgiving\nexhaustion rule as part of a statute whose very purpose\nwas to combat abusive litigation by prisoners.\nRespondent's submission is that the\nadministrative law principle, the established\nadministrative law principle, that exhaustion requires\ncompliance with the agency's procedural rules, is\ninapplicable here, because what we're dealing with is what\nhe calls an original proceeding rather than a review\nproceeding.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Is his best case, your\nbrother's best case, in your view -- and you probably --\nmay not think of it as a very persuasive case -- Fay and\nNoia, is that the closest Respondents can come?\nMR. HIMMELFARB: Well, probably, Justice\nKennedy. And that is a habeas corpus case that involves\nexhaustion under the habeas corpus statute. It doesn't\ninvolve administrative exhaustion. And, of course, the\nCourt abandoned that principle, which was the deliberate\nbypass exception to the procedural default rule, years\nago, I believe in 1977, in favor of the cause and\nprejudice exception in Wainwright versus Sykes, which was\nsubsequently codified by Congress in AEDPA. But there is\nno administrative exhaustion context, of which we are\naware, where untimely exhaustion is sufficient.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: You --\nMR. HIMMELFARB: Respondent places --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Could --\nMR. HIMMELFARB: -- heavy --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Would Respondent tell us,\nwell, that at least in some administrative law schemes,\ngenerally there is a requirement that the exhaustion\nperiod must be reasonable?\nMR. HIMMELFARB: Well, the -- this Court has\nmade clear, in various cases, including in the very\ncontext of the exhaustion provision at issue here, in the\nBooth versus Churner decision, that there are no\nexceptions to the exhaustion -- to an administrative\nexhaustion requirement when Congress provides otherwise;\nthat is, in the context of statutory, as opposed to a\njudge-made, exhaustion requirement. It is the case that\nwhat is required under the PLRA is exhaustion of available\nadministrative remedies. So, under some of the\nhypotheticals that the Court was suggesting -- for\nexample, if there were a 6-hour filing deadline; and, as\nfar as I'm aware, there is no prison that has a 6-hour\nfiling deadline -- but, if there were, and in that\nparticular case, for some reason, the prisoner were unable\nto comply with the deadline, because, for example, forms\nwere unavailable or he was in a hospital bed,\nincapacitated, or he was in solitary confinement, I think\nit would be appropriate for a Federal Court to conclude\nthat the remedy at issue was not available; and,\ntherefore, that he didn't have to pursue that remedy; he\nwould be able to get into Federal Court, assuming he had\notherwise complied with the prison's procedural\nrequirements.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, wouldn't it go --\nwouldn't that apply -- that principle apply to reasonable\n-- unreasonable remedies? You have to have a reasonable\nremedy. I don't see how you can decide to import half of\nadministrative law and not the other half.\nMR. HIMMELFARB: No, I don't think -- I don't\nthink reasonableness is the right way to think about it,\nJustice Breyer. It is not a -- in our view, it's not a\ncategorical question of whether a particular filing\ndeadline is reasonable or not in the view of the Court.\nJUSTICE BREYER: It's not just a filing\ndeadline. It's the whole procedure. I mean, Rehnquist --\nChief Justice Rehnquist, in McCarthy, lists a bunch of\nreasons in cases where the process subjects the plaintiffs\nto unreasonable delay, to an indefinite timeframe. And\nthere could be others. The normal thing is, you excuse\nexhaustion where the exhaustion requirement was such that\nthe person couldn't reasonably comply.\nNow, either you do want to import that into this\nstatute, or not. And if you do not, then I think you're\nasking us to say we import what goes normally with the\nword \"exhaustion,\" where it favors the Government, but not\nwhat normally goes with the word \"exhaustion\" where it\ndoesn't.\nMR. HIMMELFARB: Our only point, Justice Breyer,\nis that it wouldn't be appropriate for a court to look at\na particular filing deadline in a prison. Most of them,\nincidently, are somewhere between 14 and 30 days. But if\nthere were, for example, a 24-hour filing deadline, our\nsubmission is that it wouldn't be appropriate for a court\nto look at that deadline and say, \"We think that that's\njust too short, and, therefore, unreasonable.\" It would\nonly be appropriate to say that the remedy wasn't\navailable if -- regardless of the length of the filing\ndeadline -- in a particular case, the facts were such that\nliterally the prisoner were unable to pursue that\nadministrative remedy. If he were literally unable to do\nso, the remedy would not be available under the PLRA\nexhaustion provision.\nThe case on which Respondent places --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Would that apply to a prisoner\nwho claimed he'd been raped by a guard or something, but\nwas afraid to bring the proceeding, for 2 or 3 weeks,\nuntil the guard was transferred to another facility? And\nhe alleged those facts, and then he was denied relief\nbecause it was over 15 days. Would that be --\nMR. HIMMELFARB: Justice Stevens, I think there\nwould be cases -- and that might be one of them -- that\nwould present difficult questions. Under your\nhypothetical, for example, if the -- if it were clear that\nthere were explicit threats --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, those are --\nMR. HIMMELFARB: -- from the guard --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- his allegations. These are\njust his allegations. And when that -- and they then\nsaid, \"No, it's -- you're out of time.\" Could a Federal\nCourt take that case?\nMR. HIMMELFARB: If a prisoner filed a 1983 or\nBivens action, and the --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: No, he -- first he files a\nprisoner complaint, 17 days late, but makes the\nallegations I describe, and he's just denied because he's\ntoo late. Could a Federal Court take that case, under\nyour view?\nMR. HIMMELFARB: Well, I would think --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And then he'd have to file a\nsecond -- subsequently file a 1983 case.\nMR. HIMMELFARB: That could be an issue that\nwould have to be litigated in connection with a motion to\ndismiss for failure to exhaust. If the prisoner alleged,\nand could prove, for example, that he received explicit\nthreats from the prison guard that, if he filed this\nadministrative claim, harm would come to him, I would\nthink that a court could permissibly find that that wasn't\nan available remedy. But short of -- short of explicit\nthreats, I think he would -- it would be a more difficult\nissue --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: So even --\nMR. HIMMELFARB: -- and a much harder --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- if it was seven --\nMR. HIMMELFARB: -- case.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- even after the 17th day,\nthe Federal Court could hear a -- have a factual hearing.\nMR. HIMMELFARB: There would have -- if the\nremedy was not available, because the prisoner --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: He's just alleged it isn't -- in\n-- and the only -- the only response from the State is,\n\"You're 2 days late.\" That's all -- that's all the State\nhas said.\nMR. HIMMELFARB: That's right. But there -- you\nwould -- you would often have factual issues in connection\n-- maybe not \"often\" -- you would sometimes have factual\nissues in connection with a motion to dismiss which might\ntransform it, in effect, into a motion for summary\njudgment when there is an exhaustion defense raised by the\nprison. And that might be an example -- I think that\nwould be a rare case, but that might be an example of\nwhere that would happen.\nI do want to respond to Respondent's reliance on\nthe Oscar Mayer case. The distinction between Oscar Mayer\nand this case is that that case did not involve an\nexhaustion provision. The Court explicitly stated, in\nOscar Mayer, that the provision at issue, a provision of\nthe ADEA, does not stipulate an exhaustion requirement.\nThe requirement was one of commencement. It obligated the\nclaimant to go to a State administrative agency, wait 60\ndays, and then he was free to go into Federal Court.\nExhaustion requires a claimant to go to an agency and\ncomplete his remedies. In Oscar Mayer, the Court relied\non features of the provision at issue there that are not\npresent here, and it said, correctly, that the provision\nat issue there had the purpose of providing a claimant\nwith a limited opportunity to obtain relief in the State\nadministrative process.\nThe PLRA exhaustion provision was enacted to\ngive the prison a full and fair opportunity, not a limited\nopportunity, to provide relief before a prisoner is\nentitled to go into Federal Court.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Why did they use the word\n\"until,\" instead of the word \"unless\"?\nMR. HIMMELFARB: There are lots of statutory\nexhaustion requirements that are framed in lots of\ndifferent types of language. Some say \"until,\" some say\n\"unless,\" some say \"before,\" some say \"after,\" some say\n\"only if.\" But, in every single context of which I am\naware, they incorporate the settled administrative law\nprinciple that a claimant has to comply with the agency's\nprocedural requirements.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.\nHimmelfarb.\nMr. Feder.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MEIR FEDER\nON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT\nMR. FEDER: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and\nmay it please the Court:\nThere are three basic reasons that a procedural\ndefault rule should not be read into the PLRA. The first\nis, the text of section 1997(e) is most naturally read as\nrequiring simple exhaustion, which is satisfied once --\nwhen there are no remedies available at the time the suit\nis filed.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I would -- I would not describe\n\"exhaustion\" that way. I would -- I would describe a\nfailure to file within the prescribed time, not as an\nexhaustion of remedies, but as a failure to exhaust\nremedies. I mean, I guess I'm having a terminological\nproblem in this case, as I did in the previous case.\nMR. FEDER: Well, Your Honor, I think -- I think\nthat in the habeas cases the Court has consistently read\n\"exhaustion\" as referring simply to \"no remedies presently\navailable.\"\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, well, we're talking about\nadministrative law, which is a field I used to know\nsomething about, and I've never thought \"exhaustion\"\nincluded \"failure to exhaust,\" which --\nMR. FEDER: Well --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- which is --\nMR. FEDER: -- first --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- what happens when you simply\ndon't file within the prescribed period.\nMR. FEDER: Well, first of all, Your Honor, I\ndon't think we're -- that administrative law is the\nappropriate analogy here. There are a number of reasons\nwhy habeas provides a much closer source of meaning for\nthe word and concept of \"exhaustion\" here, both because of\nthe similarity of the language in the exhaustion provision\nhere, and the habeas exhaustion provision, because of the\nfact that both are prisoner litigation. There is an\noverlap between habeas cases and section 1983 cases in\nthis context. And --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I'm not sure. It seems\nto me, as Justice Scalia's question indicates -- I was\nsurprised that we're talking about procedural default. I,\ntoo, thought this was an administrative law case. And\nit's an administrative law case, because we want the input\nof the administrative -- of the administrative body. In\nthe habeas cases, we're simply giving deference as a\nmatter of comity and courtesy to the State Courts. Is it\n--\nMR. FEDER: Well, actually, Your Honor, I don't\nthink there's any indication that Congress was focused on\ninput from the prison grievance system. In fact, the way\n-- the way it works is that once the prison grievance\nsystem addresses the claim that's of no effect in the\nsubsequent Federal suit, which starts over from square one\n--\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, not so much maybe input,\nbut so that they can -- they can resolve the program --\nthe problem within the institution, and not have to come\nto the courts.\nMR. FEDER: Well, two things. First, as I say,\nthere are a number of reasons why, in looking at the\nlanguage Congress was using, it's more reasonable to look\nto the habeas statute. But even in the administrative law\ncontext, this is dramatically different from most\nadministrative law circumstances, because in those\nsituations you have an administrative decision that is in\nsome way being reviewed, the administrative agency record\nmay have some effect. Here, you don't have that aspect of\nreview, and the administrative context that is close to\nthis, if you're looking for an administrative analogy, is\nthe Title VII and Age Discrimination Act cases, because\nthose cases, similarly, provided for invocation of State\nremedies that were designed to give the State an\nopportunity to resolve the case voluntarily, if that would\nsatisfy the prospective plaintiff, but if the plaintiff\nwere not satisfied, he'd be able to move on.\nAnd I think that both opposing counsel have made\na point of saying that the Oscar Mayer case pointed out\nthat it was not an exhaustion requirement in Oscar Mayer,\nbut, rather, that it used the word \"commence.\" But I\nthink it's important to look at what the Court said it\nmeant by saying it wasn't an exhaustion requirement. And\nthis is at 441 U.S. at 761, and the Court said, \"section\n14(b) does not stipulate an exhaustion requirement. The\nsection is intended only to give State agencies a limited\nopportunity to settle the grievances of ADEA claimants in\na voluntary, localized manner so that the grievants\nthereafter have no need or desire for independent Federal\nrelief.\" So, the sense in which the Court was saying that\nthat's not an exhaustion requirement is basically saying\nthat that scheme is like this one, where the PLRA does not\napproach attempting to reduce the Federal prisoner claims\nby kicking cases out of court indiscriminately or by\ndefaults; it aims to reduce it by raising the degree of\ndifficulty for the prisoner in getting to Federal Court in\nvarious ways --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But how does it do that? I\nmean, if there's any object that Congress had in mind,\nsurely it was to reduce the number of frivolous prisoner\nclaims that are coming into Federal district courts. And\nit hoped to do this by sending the -- making sure that\nthey went through the prison system first. Whether we\nlooked at what the prison system did or not, we hoped that\nthe prison system would get rid of a large -- a large\nnumber of these frivolous claims.\nNow, can you tell me how that purpose is\npossibly served --\nMR. FEDER: Certainly, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- by saying, \"Do nothing. So\nlong as you don't even try to go through the prison\ngrievance system, you can come directly into court.\" It\nseems to me this --\nMR. FEDER: Well, we're not --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- this --\nMR. FEDER: -- we're not saying that, Your\nHonor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, no, \"You -- you have to go\nthere late. You\" --\nMR. FEDER: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- \"you just sit around until\nit's too late, file a grievance that you know will not be\naccepted, because it's too late, and then you can come\ninto Federal Court.\" This is going to cut back\nconsiderably on the number of frivolous claims?\nMR. FEDER: Your Honor, I think that -- there\nare a few points to respond to there -- I think that the\nprovision does make sense that way. I mean, first, it's\nworth noting that the PLRA was working very well before\nprocedural default even came into the picture. The first\ncourt of appeals decision recognizing procedural default\nunder the PLRA was in 2002. The Petitioner has statistics\n-- Petitioners have statistics in their brief showing that\nbetween 1995 and 2000 there was already a nearly 50\npercent drop in the rate of inmate filings. But going\nspecifically --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Maybe because they thought they\nhad to file on time.\nMR. FEDER: But there is no -- there is no\nindication anywhere of there being widespread defaults.\nBut I should address your question about how this advances\n-- why the provision wouldn't be meaningless without\nprocedural default. And there are least three ways that\nit is still meaningful. The first is, it removes any\nrational incentive for the prisoner to evade the grievance\nsystem. I'll come back to that in a second. I just want\nto say the second and third things are, it gives the State\nan opportunity to address the grievance, if it wants to,\nand, at a minimum, it delays and raises the degree of\ndifficulty for the prisoner.\nBut going back to the incentives, there are two\nbasic reasons why an inmate might rationally want to evade\nthe grievance process. And, I mean, there's this notion\nhere of prisoners scheming to get around the grievance\nprocess and deliberate bypass. And it's completely\noverblown, because the -- there are two basic reasons the\nprisoner might want to. First, if proceeding with the\ngrievance and having it adjudicated in the prison\ngrievance system could somehow harm his later Federal\nsuit. Second would be to get to Federal Court faster.\nNeither one of these things happens under the PLRA, even\nwithout a procedural default rule being read into it.\nOn the first thing, the prisoner is not affected\nin Federal Court, unlike, say, a habeas case, where a\nprisoner may want to evade a State Court decision, because\nthat decision will get deference in the later Federal\nhabeas proceeding. Here, the grievance decision is of no\nforce and effect. That incentive is not there.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes it is. Because the\nwhole -- one of the reasons you have reasonably short time\nis that you get the witnesses there, they remember it.\nIf you have to file within 15 days with the\nprison, the prisoner does that, the guard is there, \"Do\nyou remember what happened?\"\n\"Yes. This, this, and this.\"\n\"Who else was there?\"\n\"These people were there.\"\nYou wait 3 months, the prisoner files a\ncomplaint, they ask the guard, \"Do you remember?\"\n\"Not really. It was 3 months ago.\"\n\"Who else was there?\"\n\"I'm not sure.\"\nThen he has -- you know, the evidence against\nhim is much weaker when he files his claim in Federal\nCourt.\nMR. FEDER: I -- Your Honor, I don't -- I don't\nthink it really makes sense to say that, within this kind\nof time periods that we're talking about, that that's\nreally going to help the inmate's claim, because -- I\nmean, we're dealing here within --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, the point is that if\nhe complies with the time limit, it's going to hurt his\nclaim; therefore, he doesn't want to comply with the time\nlimit.\nMR. FEDER: I understand, Your Honor, but\neverything here is within the framework of the section\n1983 statute of limitations. And -- which is set,\npresumably, to be able to adjudicate claims with -- on the\ntheory that it's fresh enough -- reasonably fresh if it's\nwithin whatever that period is in the particular State; 2\nyears, in many States. So, the idea that something --\nthat the guard is not going to be able to testify 6 months\nlater is, I think, you know, maybe at the margins. It's\nnot likely to affect this.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, you were\nsuggesting that the prisoner had no incentive not to\ncomply and go through the State grievance procedure. And\nit seems to me that the reason you have the short\nprocedures are to maintain a fresh record that more\naccurately reflects the truth, and, since Congress was\nacting against the backdrop in which they thought there\nwere too many frivolous cases, they thought that might be\none way to limit those.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And the more frivolous the\ncase, the more likely it is that it won't be remembered by\na guard. I mean, you know, the suit is, \"A guard spat on\nmy painting,\" or something like that, you know. Who's\ngoing to remember anything like that 4 months later?\nMR. FEDER: Well, Your Honor, again, I think\nthat, at a minimum -- even if you grant that there may --\nthe prisoner may see some advantage in that, there is, at\na minimum, a substantially smaller incentive than you\nwould -- than you would have in, for example, a habeas\ncase. But I want to get to the second thing, which is, I\nthink, the more likely incentive that existed before the\nPLRA.\nBefore the PLRA is passed, if a prisoner wants\nto get to Federal Court as quickly as possible, the\nprisoner, the day after he suffers whatever injury he\nfeels he has suffered, can go about filing his Federal\nclaim. The PLRA, with or without a procedural default\nrule, prevents that. He can't do that, because, first of\nall, he has to wait until -- if he's going to avoid the\ngrievance system for some reason, he has to wait until\nthat time has run. But he then can't just go and file in\nFederal Court. If he just files in Federal Court, he's\ngoing to get bounced back, because he still has a\npotential remedy in the grievance system that he hasn't\nfiled.\nThe United States says that we've conceded that\nin systems where there isn't some sort of discretion that's\nclear to consider a late claim, that, in that case, the\nprisoner is not going to have to file. We do not concede\nthat at all. I don't -- you can look at our brief, at\npage 43 -- I don't think we concede that. We do refer to\nthe fact that California and many other States provide for\ndiscretion. But the fact is that, in any event, we're not\ntalking, here, about -- with -- in -- with grievance time\nlimits, we're not talking about something like a notice-\nof-appeal requirement that's jurisdictional, that's going\nto bar it from being appealed. If -- there's always a\npossibility, particularly since many of these systems are\ninternal rules of the grievance system, that, one way or\nanother, it can be considered. And I think --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes, all right, but the thing I\ndon't understand in this, which is hard -- Is there any\nanswer to this point from the other side? What this\nstatute does seem to be about is exhaustion, which\nnormally does carry with it the notion, \"If you don't\nexhaust, you lose.\" Dozens of cases say that. And it\nseems to make it a requirement, not leaving it to the\ndiscretion of the prisoner. Well, your interpretation\nleaves it up to the prisoner. If the prisoner doesn't\nwant to do it, he doesn't do it. He pays a price, he has\nto wait, but it's up to him. Now, that's the point that\nis bothering me the most, frankly.\nMR. FEDER: And what I'm saying now, Your Honor,\nis that he can't just wait and not file.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Why not?\nMR. FEDER: Because he will not have exhausted\nuntil he files and has --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, no, but, I mean, that's a\n-- that sounds to me like a verbal gimmick, to tell you\nthe truth. If he waits, and he waits to past the\ndeadline, sure, he'll put a piece of paper in, but it'll\nbe denied.\nMR. FEDER: Well, two things about that.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Isn't that true? So, I'm not\ncounting he puts a piece of paper in, and it's -- in my\nway of speaking, if what's left for him to do in the\nsystem, because there is this deadline, 6 months, it's\npassed, it's now 9 months, so he says, \"Here's my paper.\nI'm exhausting.\"\nMR. FEDER: Part of --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Denied.\nMR. FEDER: Part of --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay. Now, I'd say that's --\nmeans he isn't exhausting. He's failed to exhaust, as I'm\nusing the term.\nMR. FEDER: Well, Your Honor, I think -- again,\nfirst of all, it's a -- it's important to understand that\nwe are saying he will have to file, in all circumstances.\nIt's not necessarily clear --\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right.\nMR. FEDER: -- that the State --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Now, I want to get rid of that\nargument. Use my --\nMR. FEDER: I understand.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- terminology --\nMR. FEDER: Putting that --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- and now answer what I am,\nfrankly, bothered by the most --\nMR. FEDER: Yes, certainly.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- which is what I just said.\nIt leaves it up to him.\nMR. FEDER: First of all, there is always the\npossibility, depending on the nature of the grievance,\nthat the prison may address it. For instance, if the\ncomplaint is a failure-to-protect claim, and the prisoner\nis being harmed by being placed with another prisoner, who\nis -- who's dangerous to him, if the State gets that\ncomplaint late, they may -- they may very well still want\nto act on it and ameliorate that situation, and that's the\nkind of thing that could, in the end, satisfy the prisoner\nand have him not sue. But the other thing is, even if the\nState -- assuming the State doesn't address it, the\nprisoner, again, has to not just file that; there is an\nappeals process that normally he'll have to go through,\nalthough, in this case, the California -- the -- excuse me\n-- the prison appeals coordinator just said, \"I'm not even\ngoing to file it, so you can't appeal.\" Normally, though,\nyou would think you would be able to appeal. He'll have\nto go through the entire system. At best, for him, he's\ndelayed a long time. And the way Congress approached this\nwas to -- by provisions like for costs and fees and so\nforth -- was to attempt to dissuade prisoners from filing.\nThis, at a minimum, is going to help to dissuade him from\nfiling, coupled with the fact that, because he is not\ngetting to court faster, he doesn't have what, before the\nPLRA, would have been the main incentive to bypass a\nsystem that otherwise isn't going to hurt him.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It seems to me you're\nunderstating the amount of time that he's saving by\nfailing to exhaust. It's not just if he waits six months\nand then puts it in. If he had filed within the right\nperiod, he would get a hearing at one level. And there\nmay be as many as two other levels of review before he's\nfully off -- before he's fully exhausted. Now, here's a\nguy who -- you know, he's lying around in jail. He's --\nthis is a frivolous filer. He wants to get out of the\njail, downtown, you know, to the district court in L.A.,\nwhere he can look at the beautiful people and relieve the\nhumdrum of prison life. He wants to get to district court\nas soon as he can.\nMR. FEDER: Yes, there are a lot of provisions\nin the PLRA that may prevent him from actually attending,\nbut --\n[Laughter.]\nMR. FEDER: -- in -- in any event, I guess the\npoint here is, first of all, he has -- there are appeal\nlevels, whether or not -- no matter what the grounds\nsomething is rejected on, there are -- normally would be\nan appeal through the entire system. There is nothing\nrequiring the State to speed it through the appeals\nprocess if the State feels that it's important for the\nprisoner not to be able to get to Federal Court as quickly\nas possible.\nAnd, also -- I mean, one thing that we're not\ngetting to here, that I think is important -- well, I\nshould state one more thing before leaving that. I mean,\nBooth also tells us that Congress did see value in\nrequiring prisoners to file, even when it seemed very\nunlikely that they would get the relief that they were\nseeking. And the ways in which this requires a prisoner\nto file, and delays him, are significant in many of the\nsame ways.\nBut the other very important point here is that\nin considering the reasonableness of doing this with or\nwithout a procedural default requirement, sure, with\nprocedural -- excuse me, a procedural default rule -- with\nthat, of course, you're going to make the provision\nsomewhat more effective, but there's a tradeoff. And the\ntradeoff is, you're going to make it more effective by\nkicking prisoners out of court on a nonmerits ground. And\nCongress -- the sponsors of the legislation made it clear\nthey were not meaning to kick out potentially meritorious\nclaims. You also are creating another bad incentive,\nwhich is, with this procedural default rule, the prison\nofficials have the incentive to try to get rid of cases on\nnonmerits grounds, because if they rule on a -- on a\nprocedural ground, then the prisoner can't file. If they\nrule -- if they address it on the merits, then the\nprisoner has the chance of going there. So, in that\nrespect, the -- a procedural default rule makes it less\nlikely something gets affected on the merits.\nBut the point is, there's a policy tradeoff\nhere, that there is --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but --\nMR. FEDER: -- no indication --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- but as I interpret your\nargument, you're saying that there is some merit, some\nbenefit, to avoiding the State administrative procedures.\nWhat you're saying is that, \"You know, these\" --\nMR. FEDER: No, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- \"administrative procedures\naren't all that -- they're cracked up to be. There's a\ngood reason to avoid them.\" I --\nMR. FEDER: No, I'm --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: That's a --\nMR. FEDER: -- saying --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- that's a -- that's a\ndifficult argument for us --\nMR. FEDER: To --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- to accept.\nMR. FEDER: No, to the contrary, Your Honor.\nI'm saying there's -- there is -- there is no good reason\nto avoid them. I certainly don't mean to be suggesting\nthat, if I -- if I misspoke.\nBut I think -- the important point here is,\nthough, there's a real policy tradeoff. There is no\nindication anywhere in the language of the Act, or\nanywhere in the legislative history, that this is a policy\ntradeoff that Congress actually was willing to make. And\nI guess I didn't touch on the language, but there are\nnumerous textual indications, as we argue in detail in our\nbrief, even aside from getting to the word \"exhausted,\"\nthat Congress contemplated simple exhaustion, and there's\nno sign of any contemplation of a procedural default rule.\nThe word \"exhausted\" itself, again, I think that habeas,\nfor a number of reasons, is a much closer analogy,\nincluding the fact that this was passed practically\ncontemporaneous with AEDPA. There was -- at one point,\nthere were provisions in the same bill that -- one of\nwhich was an exhaustion provision in AEDPA, and one of\nwhich was the early version of this. There's no\nindication that exhaustion was used in different contexts\nthere. And the habeas cases make clear that a defaulted\nclaim is exhausted, and it's a timely requirement.\nOn the legislative history, if there was an\nexpectation that there would be this sort of procedural\ndefault rule and prisoners would forfeit claims -- and, as\nyou can tell with 2- or 3-day filing deadlines some\nplaces, and other technical requirements elsewhere --\nthere would be expected to be a number of forfeitures, no\nindication in the legislative history that Congress\nthought one of the ways the PLRA would reduce suits was by\ncausing forfeitures.\nAnd, in addition, it's important to understand\nthat, although, as we concede, the provision will be --\nit will not be as effective without a procedural default\nrule, but it still does have some effect without the\nprocedural default rule, the problem with imposing a\nprocedural default rule is that the consequences of that\nare very troubling, because what you'd be doing then is\nessentially incorporating every State, and local jail\nfacility, for that matter, filing deadline as a de facto\nstatute of limitations --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Not necessarily.\nMR. FEDER: -- for section 1983 --\nJUSTICE BREYER: That -- that's what I find\ninteresting. It might be, if you're representing the\ninterests of defendants here, you'd love this to have the\nprocedural default rule, because it will end up with the\nFederal judges all over the country systematically\nreviewing the exhaustion procedures -- or the -- yes, the\nremedies in the prisons. And where those remedies are not\nright or unfair or too short or have other problems with\nthem, the judges will say, \"You can't have this kind of\nremedy. If you want me to apply exhaustion principles,\nyou can't do it.\"\nMR. FEDER: I would like --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And, therefore, we'll get a\nforce for improvement. And that's, I thought, maybe why\nnobody wanted, really, to bring it up.\nMR. FEDER: I would like to think that, Your\nHonor, but, actually, as opposing counsel has indicated,\nCongress eliminated the language -- the pre-existing\nlanguage that placed some sort of requirement -- it\nremoved the \"plain, speedy, and effective\" language,\nremoved the \"minimum standards\" language. The indication\nwas that they wouldn't be reviewed for the adequacy of the\nstandards.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And I suppose you could add to\nthat, that Mr. Himmelfarb wouldn't even accept\n\"reasonable.\" He said it has to be \"impossible\" to comply\nwith.\nMR. FEDER: I think -- I think that's right.\nAnd I think that that's actually an indication that\nCongress was not expecting it to have this sort of harsh\nconsequence, where you're taking whatever procedural rule\nfrom whatever State.\nAnother thing about the PLRA, aside from\nremoving the old language, is that one of the goals of the\nPLRA was to remove intrusive Federal judicial oversight\nfrom prison systems. And if you were going to be in a\nposition of reviewing everything for reasonableness, you\nhave exactly that kind of oversight saying, you know,\n\"Your procedure is adequate. Yours isn't adequate.\" And\nthat's what -- that's what Congress removed.\nThe consequences also mean that if this\nprocedural default rule is accepted, you could have even\ncontinuing violations, continuing unconstitutional conduct\nthat would not be challengeable, could be insulated from\nFederal review after the passage of a short deadline or\nviolation of whatever other procedure, fair or unfair,\nthat a State -- that a State creates --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Let me be sure --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Feder --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- I understand one thing\nabout your position. You do agree, do you not, that in\norder to exhaust, even if the time has run the 15-day\nperiod, there is an obligation to go to the State and ask\nthem to hear the case, even though it's untimely?\nMR. FEDER: Yes. I think there clearly is.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: So that you do say that you at\nleast will give the State the opportunity to decide\nwhether it wants to try and remedy it in an informal or\nhasty manner.\nMR. FEDER: Yes.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yes.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And is that true even if the\nState does not have a procedure for reopening for late\nclaims?\nMR. FEDER: Yes. I think -- I think it is.\nBecause I think that until it becomes absolutely clear\nthat the State --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, suppose --\nMR. FEDER: -- or the grievances --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- the State says, \"We don't\nconsider late claims.\" As they do here.\nMR. FEDER: Sorry?\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose the State says, \"We\ndon't consider late claims.\"\nMR. FEDER: And may -- and if it does it as a\nbinding rule that's not -- that's not subject to change, I\nsuppose that that -- that that would be possible. But the\nfact is -- actually, a good example is, in one of the\nadministrative cases that the United States cites in their\nbrief, the United States versus L.A. Tucker Lines, what --\nthe argument there is, \"We didn't need to present this\nargument to the Interstate Commerce Commission, because\nthey had a rule that meant that they couldn't accept our\nclaim, and the court -- and the court says no to exhaust.\nYou do have to present the claim. They may change it.\"\nJUSTICE ALITO: What if the claim is presented\nin a way that's gibberish, it's impossible to understand?\nMR. FEDER: Then it'll -- then, presumably, if\nthe State rejects it on that ground, if he tries to file\nin Federal Court, he'll get sent back for having failed to\nactually complete his exhaustion obligations until he\nmanages to file a --\nJUSTICE ALITO: But he can --\nMR. FEDER: -- claim that would satisfy --\nJUSTICE ALITO: But it can never be procedurally\ndefaulted, because the claim isn't presented in a\ncomprehensible form to the -- to the prison grievance\nofficials?\nMR. FEDER: I think that maybe it's possible, in\nsome cases, as a sanction for bad-faith conduct.\nConceivably -- I'm not sure where that would come from --\nbut if he fails to present the claim in a -- in a way that\nit can be addressed, he has to -- he can't come to Federal\nCourt until he presents it to them in a way in which it at\nleast could have been addressed.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why is that procedural rule\nbinding on him, but the time procedural rule not binding\non him? I don't know why. I mean, if --\nMR. FEDER: It's only binding --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- they're procedural rules,\nyou have to set it forth in a comprehensible manner, and\nyou have to be on time.\nMR. FEDER: Well, Your Honor, I think that if\nthe State were to say that you -- that, \"This is\ndefinitively rejected, and we're not going to let him\namend it,\" then, in that case, you would have satisfied\nexhaustion, as far as the -- but only if it's definitive.\nOtherwise -- well -- and I should just go back to the --\nto the point I was making about a continuing violation.\nFor instance, let's say there is a failure-to-protect\nclaim. Someone is in danger, doesn't file. He's in --\nhe's in one of the States where it's 2 days. I think\nMichigan is one of those. He doesn't file within 2 days.\nThe State has -- after that, can say, \"You can't go to\nFederal Court, because you haven't met our deadline.\"\nIn this case, here, there was a continuing\nviolation that was alleged, and the -- and the State\nbasically said, \"Our rule is, even if it's continuing, you\nhave to file it within 30 days -- or 15 days of when it\nfirst arose.\" And, I mean, you can imagine a number of\ncircumstances where this rule here would mean -- again,\nany prison or local jail procedural rule, no matter -- is\na -- presumably, until you get to the point of violating\ndue process, would be a basis for saying that prisoners\ndon't have to go to court. There is nothing in the words\nof the statute that suggest that, nothing in the\nlegislative history of the statute that suggest it. The\nonly real argument on the other side is that Congress must\nhave meant to include it, because that's what \"exhaustion\"\nusually means.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Feder, there is one\nanomaly that the Government points out. And I -- before\nyou sit down, I'd like to know what your answer is. They\nsaid, \"Imagine one prisoner who begins the grievance\nprocess on time, he goes to step two, goes to step three,\nthen he stops. And then another prisoner who waits til\nthe time has come and gone, she files. The prison says,\n'We don't take late filings.' The second prisoner gets to\ncourt, and the first, who did go through three steps, but\nstopped short of the fourth, doesn't have any access to\nFederal Court.\"\nMR. FEDER: Well, except that he's not\npermanently barred, because if he -- if he hasn't\nexhausted, he gets sent back and has to at least file the\nlast appeal.\nThank you, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Feder.\nMs. Perkell, you may have a minute for rebuttal.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JENNIFER G. PERKELL\nON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS\nMS. PERKELL: Three quick points, Your Honors.\nIt's not so much that the Ninth Circuit's rule\ncreates an incentive for an inmate to file untimely, it's\nthat it doesn't create the incentive to file timely.\nMoreover, Respondent is relying on the habeas\ncorpus analogy, but, at the same time, he wants the\nresults under the PLRA to be different from under the\nhabeas corpus statute.\nAnd, third, untimely -- the rule of untimely\nexhaustion adopted by the Ninth Circuit undermines the\npurposes of the statute, because, first, prisons will\nusually enforce their deadlines, and grievances will not\nreceive any merits review before they reach Federal Court.\nAnd, second, because grievances filed untimely, and\nparticularly months or years untimely, deprive prisons of\na genuine opportunity to investigate and respond to\nprisoner -- or they do deprive prisons of a genuine\nopportunity to investigate and respond to prisoner\ngrievances, because oftentimes witnesses, evidence, and,\nin particular, recollections, are no longer available.\nUnless the Court has any --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel.\nMS. PERKELL: Thank you.\n"
