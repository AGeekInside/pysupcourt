WAXMAN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. WAXMAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nWe rely on four propositions in this case.\nFirst, there is a long final judgment in the Agent Orange\nlitigation that binds a class which by its terms includes\nrespondents.\nSecond, all of the judges in the direct\nproceedings, the trial judges and the appellate judges,\nconcluded that all veterans should be included in the\nclass and settlement, because all of the veterans, whether\nthey were symptomatic or not, face the overwhelming\nprospect of legal defeat on issues common to the entire\nclass, first and foremost, the Government contractor\ndefense.\nThird, adequacy of representation was expressly\nconsidered several times, both generally and with specific\nrespect to asymptomatic veterans, by both the district\ncourt and the court of appeals, and fourth, there is\nsimply no question that Judge Weinstein, whose scholarship\non class actions the 1966 Rule 23 Advisory Committee\nrepeatedly cited, and who literally wrote the book on mass\ntort litigation, conscientiously applied the procedures of\nRule 23, including, in particular, the obligation that he\ncertify and thereafter ensure adequacy of representation.\nNow, the respondents may certainly challenge the\nres judicata effect of the judgment against them, and the\nquestion presented for this Court is the permissible scope\nand standard of that review. In our view, due process\ndoes not require and finality principles do not permit de\nnovo relitigation from scratch of the adequacy\ndetermination made in this case.\nQUESTION:\nrespondents? It's sort of hard to find, looking back at\nthe settlement agreement and the orders that were entered,\nthat the people in respondent's category were thought to\nbe covered.\nMR. WAXMAN: Well, Justice O'Connor, notice in\nthis case -- I think as the case comes to this Court, the\nCourt certainly cannot decide this case on the principle\nthat the notice was constitutionally inadequate. In the\nfirst place, both the trial court and the court of appeals\nthree times found the notice adequate under Rule 23 and\nunder the Due Process Clause. The Second Circuit below\nsuggested that this Court's decision in Amchem might have\nmade the notice defective, but notice issues were not\npresented by the respondents in this case as an\nalternative grounds for affirmance in their brief in\nopposition, and what is more, their factual record in this\ncase is completely inadequate to conclude that the notice\nwas unsatisfactory with respect to the content.\nI completely understand the argument that\nthey're making with respect to how the words, injured by\nexposure, would have been read at the time, but one cannot\nanswer that question either in a vacuum, without looking\nat the external circumstances, or in hindsight. One has\nto determine whether, in 1984, an asymptomatic veteran, a\nhealthy veteran, would, whether all of them, many of them,\nmost of them, some of them, or some significant number\nwould have understood that that includes me because\nexposure itself has been said to be injurious.\nNow, at footnote 12 --\nQUESTION: Mr. Waxman, I'd like to stop you\nright there, exposure itself has been said to be\ninjurious. This Court in Metro North said, exposure only\npeople have no claim, and it did so purporting to use\ntraditional common law in interpreting the FELA, so\naccording to this Court's decision in Metro North, isn't\nit clear that these people had no ripe claim to state, and\nhow could they be adequately represented when their claim\nhad not yet accrued?\nAs I understand the law of both Louisiana and\nNew Jersey, where these cases come from, the claim doesn't\naccrue until the exposure has manifested itself in an\ninjury, in an illness.\nMR. WAXMAN: Justice Ginsburg, before I answer\nthat, let me just give one more answer to Justice\nO'Connor, and I'll directly address your question.\nThe only other point I wanted to make -- I'm\nafraid I'll forget it -- is that in footnote 12 of our\nreply brief we point out that at the time, that is, at the\ntime of certification and before settlement, publications\nranging from The New York Times to Penthouse Magazine,\nwhich we put at the end of our footnote, and newspapers,\nlocal newspapers in the states that these two respondents\nreside in, understood that the class included all veterans\nin Vietnam who were -- were or may have been exposed, and\nthat's the factual issue that, without which you can't\nresolve the notice issue in this case adverse to us.\nNow, Justice Ginsburg --\nQUESTION: I'd like to ask you later how that\ncomports with, what is it, Eisen and Jacquelin. I mean,\nyou could have, if you really thought this was the class,\ngiven mail notice to all the veterans, all the people who\nhad served in Vietnam, and newspaper service is very nice,\nbut it's rarely seen by anyone, but anyway, let's get back\nto --\nMR. WAXMAN: Well --\nQUESTION: -- that this Court has said, under\nthe common law, people who were merely exposed, who do not\nhave a current injury, don't have any claim. They may\nnever have a claim, but they certainly have no ripe claim\nat this stage.\nMR. WAXMAN: Well, first of all, Justice\nGinsburg, as you pointed out, the Metro North case, a)\nlong post dated the final judgment in this case, and --\nQUESTION: But it purported to apply traditional\ncommon law.\nMR. WAXMAN: No, I do understand that, and it\nwas looking to traditional common law in order to make a\nruling with respect to the FELA.\nNow, at the time, in 19 -- I mean, our\nsubmission essentially is, here the adequacy determination\nand the Article III claims sort of mesh together, but\nour -- our submission here is that injury in fact, which\nis what is necessary in order to include them in the\nclass, is not dependent on the existence of a mature cause\nof action. They clearly alleged that they were injured in\nfact because, as New York State and other states\nrecognized at the time, there was a mature tort for\nexposure, injury by exposure, and many, many states\nrecognized that and applied that rule at the time, and in\nany event, whether or not they had a mature cause of\naction, they plainly had a present right at the time and a\ncognizable interest in the establishment of a -- of a fund\nthat would be available to compensate them. That's the\nword this Court --\nQUESTION: But were they plainly included within\nthe class, so that the class representatives would have\nknown that they were supposed to represent these people,\nand as I understand it -- maybe you could go to -- go to\nthis point. Your -- your friend on the other side has\nsaid, the first time that in writing we saw anything that\nmade it plain, even though it was buried in language\nsomewhere, that the injured class included the exposures\nonly was in the notice of settlement, and so my question\nis, is that correct, and number 2, aside from that point,\nwhy would, why should we understand that the parties\ninvolved, including the representative plaintiffs,\nunderstood that injured included exposures only, so that\nthey knew they were supposed to be representing them?\nMR. WAXMAN: Well, there -- I believe there are\nat least two separate questions --\nQUESTION: There are.\nMR. WAXMAN: -- and I'll deal with the\nrespondents in this case first. They allege that they\nnever saw any notice saying anything at any time, which\nmakes -- and of course we know from Dusenbery, and before\nthat Mullane, that actual notice isn't required, so the\nwording of the no -- these are peculiarly inappropriate\nparties to be complaining about the wording of one of the\nmany notices that went out in this case. There were at\nleast three, and perhaps four notices that went out, and\nthe notice that they are putting their attention on is the\nnotice certifying --\nQUESTION: Well, are you saying that even though\nthe notice was improper, since they didn't see any notice\nat all, they can't complain about it?\nMR. WAXMAN: Not at all. We think that there\nclearly are -- since actual notice isn't required, we\ndon't think that they lack standing to, on behalf of the\n2.4 million people who were in the class --\nQUESTION: Mr. --\nMR. WAXMAN: -- to say that we have -- Mullane\nrequires that the content of the notice be adequate as\nwell as the --\nQUESTION: Actual notice isn't required when you\ndon't know the people. It is required, best notice\npracticable, in Mullane, when you knew the names, they\nwere identified beneficiaries -- Justice Jackson says\nthose people have got to get mail notice. It's only when\nyou don't know the error hasn't -- who the person is, that\nthe other is adequate. Here, there were records, who\nserved in Vietnam from '61 to '72, so you did know.\nMR. WAXMAN: Justice Ginsburg, this point, and\nindeed most, if not all of the points that the respondents\nare making in this collateral litigation, were made by my\nclients in the direct proceedings before Judge Weinstein\nand in the mandamus petition that went up to the Second\nCircuit from his class certification decision.\nWe argued that there should be individual notice\nto all veterans. The Government represented, the\nplaintiffs claimed, and both the trial court and the\nSecond Circuit expressly found --\nQUESTION: Mr. -- Mr. Waxman, that's --\nMR. WAXMAN: -- that there was not such a list.\nQUESTION: Mr. Waxman, that's well and good that\nyour clients, the defendants in this case did that, but\nhere we have a class of people, potential plaintiffs. Who\nrepresented them? Was there anyone in this case, other\nthan the judge, who has a global settlement, is there\nany -- were any of the named representatives asym --\nMR. WAXMAN: Asymptomatic?\nQUESTION: Yes, were any of them?\nMR. WAXMAN: The named representatives were not\nasymptomatic, and by design. Judge Weinstein wanted to\nput in front of the jury the strongest, most sympathetic\ncases for causation, and there -- at the time of\nsettlement in this case, the symptomatic representatives\nwere completely representative of the views of all\nveterans, because they had the following overwhelming\nobjectives: defeat the Government contractor defense\nwhich, as it turns out, was applied both by the district\ncourt and by the court of appeals to grant judgment\nagainst the people who actually opted out and pursued\ntheir claims.\nSecondly, to establish a defense to the\ncompany's defense that the Government had misused it, that\nthe Government had prevented them from putting warnings\non, and to prove general causation, that is, to establish\nproof by a preponderance --\nQUESTION: But when we get past that, Mr.\nWaxman, adequacy of representation has to exist at all\nstages of the litigation, and we're getting to the point\nwhere there isn't going to be any trial. There's going to\nbe a settlement fund, and I suppose if I were representing\nsomeone who was not going to be diseased until 1998, I\nnever would have consented to a settlement fund that will\nrun dry in 1994.\nMR. WAXMAN: Justice Ginsburg, the distinction\nhere, even at the distribution phase -- and remember, the\nparties, the plaintiffs' representatives and the\nplaintiffs' lawyers, recognizing the extreme weakness of\ntheir legal claims, however great the pathos was, and\ngenuine anguish that they suffered, that their legal\nclaims were so weak they were willing to settle this case\nand, on the assumption that Judge Weinstein and the\nSpecial Master would allocate the formula, and the -- I\nwould say the proof in the pudding is that the named\nrepresentatives included six veterans. I believe only two\nof them were ever given cash benefits in this case, as\nopposed to the general benefits that the class received\nfrom the $70 million class --\nQUESTION: But they were symptomatic, all of\nthe --\nMR. WAXMAN: They were all --\nQUESTION: Okay.\nMR. WAXMAN: -- they were all symptomatic, and\nour submission here is that, as Judge Weinstein found and\nthe Second Circuit found, in response to precisely these\narguments, the pervasive, overwhelming, common weakness\nthat all of the plaintiffs had with respect to the legal\nissues made the representation of asymptomatic veterans\nrepresentative. This is --\nQUESTION: Okay, that's get -- all right, let's\nassume for the sake of argument that gets you to the point\nof -- of the settlement, 200, whatever it was, 200 million\nis fine. Then we get to the point that you referred to a\nmoment ago, in which they'd leave it to the judge to\ndecide how the 200 million is going to be split up, and\nwho's in effect going to be sub -- able to claim benefits\nout of what.\nAt that point, I suppose it's fair to say that\nthe symptomatic class representatives are going to be in\nfavor of a division of that fund which gives most of the\nmoney to the presently symptomatic veterans. There was no\none at that point, that I can see, who was standing up for\nthe as yet asymptomatics and saying, wait a minute, you're\nnot setting aside enough money and leaving the money\navailable for a long enough period of time for us, so that\nif you're right up to the point of settlement, why haven't\nyou got the problem once that point is reached?\nMR. WAXMAN: Justice Souter, I -- I do at some\npoint want to argue to the Court why we think that de novo\nrelitigation of adequacy is not appropriate on collateral\nreview, but even if it were, I believe I have a\nsatisfactory answer to your question.\nFirst of all, the way that the distribution, the\nallocation proceedings occurred, with hearings, multiple\nhearings, multiple submissions not only by the class\nrepresentatives whose proposal was uniquely rejected by\nJudge Weinstein, but by individual veterans, veterans\ngroups, actuaries, scientists --\nQUESTION: Individual veterans were heard, but\nthey weren't representatives, and the court wasn't a\nrepresentative.\nMR. WAXMAN: That, to be sure. To be sure, but\nthey were -- the class -- first of all, and Shutts itself\nstands for the proposition, Phillips Petroleum v. Shutts\nstands for the proposition that the court and the parties\nadverse to the class may supply the arguments and the\nnecessary sharpness in an adversary system to assure that\nin the main the procedures followed were sufficiently\nfundamentally fair, but here I think it's very important\nnot to character -- not to understand that in 1984 this\nlooked like the type of futures versus presents that\nexisted in Amchem and existed in Ortiz.\nFirst --\nQUESTION: Okay, why didn't it? Why --\nMR. WAXMAN: Okay, for several reasons. First\nof all, the -- this -- in those cases you had a situation\nin which people who presently suffered from asbestosis and\nmesothelioma and the other -- the other tragic\nmanifestations of asbestos exposure had valuable,\ndemonstrably valuable -- there was a matrix to figure out\nhow much they were entitled to, and the rest of the class,\nwhich, unlike here, included -- in the asbestos context\nincluded -- the entire civilized world who may or may not\nhave been exposed to asbestos, had claims worth nothing.\nIn this case the district court and the Second\nCircuit found repeatedly that what united these people\nwas, none of them had a legal claim that was worth\nanything under the way the law existed at the time, and we\nthink exists now.\nSecondly, the distinction between futures and\npresents was one of many, many, many different ways that\nyou could distinguish among the class. The more salient\none, we think, was between people who would recover\nanything under the settlement and people who would recover\nnothing under the settlement.\nFor example --\nQUESTION: No, but I'm posing the question, as\nat the point -- at the point at which the settlement\nproceeds are being divided, as between those who will get\nsomething and those who will get nothing, and so I'm\nsaying, why was there no distinction between them, for our\npurposes, at that point?\nMR. WAXMAN: I think that there -- there --\nJudge Weinstein recognized, and several people who\nappeared before him and provided testimony, written and\noral testimony in the fairness hearings, in the\ndistribution hearings, in the motion for reconsideration,\nand written objections, and a motion to certify a class,\nmade him very aware that, and he himself was aware from\nreading the literature, that the latency period for many\ndiseases is as long as 40 years, and there would be claims\nthat would come up long into the future that some people\nwould attribute to exposure to Agent Orange, and what he\ndid was, he said, I will --\nQUESTION: Then why -- why was none of the money\nheld over for such late-blooming claims?\nMR. WAXMAN: Well, what Judge Weinstein found,\nand what -- the Second Circuit on appeal insisted that the\nsettlement fund be entirely disposed of within the period.\nWhat Judge Weinstein found was, we have to make provision\nfor all veterans who were exposed. I'm going to do it in\ntwo ways, given the size of the class and the\nindeterminacy of the law. Number 1, I'm going to set\naside a certain pot of this money to provide cash\nbenefits. It will be insufficient. It will be\ninsufficient as a matter of insurance, although more than\nsufficient as a matter of proximate causation, since\nnobody can demonstrate that.\nI'm then going to take what turned out to be $70\nmillion and use it for the benefit of the class as a\nwhole, for educational programs, for counseling programs,\nfor health programs, for the very kinds of programs that\nproduced the enactment of the Agent Orange legislation\nthat now provides, on a monthly basis, more money than\nalmost any veteran got, period, and also funded the\nmedical studies and scientific studies, or prompted\nenactment of legislation that funded the studies that now\nallow them to claim that there are -- that there is\ngreater evidence of an association.\nQUESTION: Mr. --\nMR. WAXMAN: As to the other -- as to the --\npardon me.\nQUESTION:\nclose, and you've said a couple of times you think that\nthe standard on collateral review should be much different\nthan on direct review of a class action settlement. Could\nyou explain why that is, and what standard it would be?\nMR. WAXMAN: Yes, I could. May I say one\nsentence in response to Justice O'Connor --\nQUESTION: Sure.\nMR. WAXMAN: -- and I will.\nWith respect to the 75 percent of the fund that\nwent for compensation, Judge Weinstein understood and did\nreserve a very substantial portion of that for people who\nmanifested in the future, and the respondents in the case\nwere just like the respondents in Ivy/Hartman, which is,\nthey were asymptomatic. They didn't know whether they\nwere going to become ill and, if so, when, and what\nJudge -- and many - - thousands of claims were paid of\npeople who manifested disease in the future, and what\nJudge Weinstein said is, look, at some point, the time\npassage is so great that it simply becomes almost\nimpossible, as a matter of causation, to be able -- we all\nget sick, and unfortunately we all die, and many of us get\ndiseases, and as time passes, he ruled, it becomes less\nand less likely you could ever prove causation, and that's\nwhy he drew the line that he did.\nMr. Chief Justice, our proposition with respect\nto the standard of review is threefold. First of all, it\nshould not be de novo redetermination of adequacy.\nSecond, because there was no showing of collusion or\nfraud, which are recognized exceptions to the res judicata\neffect of a judgment, and because the courts\nconscientiously applied procedures that Congress adopted\nspecifically in response to Hansberry in order to provide\nprocedures that in the main will provide fundamental\nfairness in all but the most extraordinary cases, that\nshould be the end of the inquiry. That is the question on\ncollateral review.\nAnd third, even if that is not true, and even if\na court should take note of the substantive claim of\ninadequacy of representation, the prior determination\nshould be subject to a highly deferential standard that is\nappropriate for a collateral attack on a 20-year-old\njudgment in which pervasive --\nQUESTION: Why? Why?\nMR. WAXMAN: -- finality and reliance\ninterests --\nQUESTION: I mean, suppose I agree with you on that\nnotice has nothing to do with this case. The Second, the\nCircuit, Second Circuit has a footnote where they say,\nwe're not deciding, all right, so we have to assume notice\nis adequate.\nBut suppose I don't agree with you on the last\npoint. Suppose I can't figure out a reason why it should\nbe subject to some special standard of deference. After\nall, this person is claiming, I had nothing to do with\nthis case. I was not properly represented. If I don't\nagree with you about that -- a) why should I agree with\nyou that? b) If I don't agree with you about that,\nstill the Second Circuit said, we're looking into the\nmerits of this, and we think they were not adequately\nrepresented.\nMR. WAXMAN: Well, the --\nQUESTION: Now, to know whether they're right or\nwrong about that, I guess I have to read 500,000 pages of\nthis settlement hearing and find out everything about this\ncase in order to decide whether they're right or wrong --\nMR. WAXMAN: Well --\nQUESTION: -- about their ultimate judgement.\nHow do I do that?\nMR. WAXMAN: Justice Breyer, first of all the\nSecond Circuit did not do that. Notably it didn't do it.\nIt didn't do it in a case in which there are 60 reported\ndecisions, something like 13,000 docket entries in the\ndistrict court alone. What it said is, we're going to\nretroactively apply Amchem. We're going to conclude that\nAmchem was a due process decision, even though it\nexplicitly disavowed that, and --\nQUESTION: There's one thing --\nQUESTION: It has to be -- I think the answer to\nmy question has to be, is just tell the Second Circuit,\nwait, Amchem's a different thing, go back and do it over.\nMR. WAXMAN: Our submission that you --\nQUESTION: Is that what you're saying we should\ndo?\nMR. WAXMAN: Certainly not.\nQUESTION: Well, I mean, if we -- if I reject\na), if I reject --\nMR. WAXMAN: Certainly not.\nQUESTION: Right.\nMR. WAXMAN: I'm just pointing out that Amchem\ndidn't redetermine adequacy as a factual matter. It\nconcluded that as a matter of law --\nQUESTION: And it didn't do anything new. Mr.\nWaxman, you put it in your brief, repeated it today. You\nsaid, retroactively apply Amchem. As far as I know that\ndecision, like Ortiz, were not doing anything new. They\nwere applying the law that existed then that the Court\nthought was the law before, so Amchem was not a change in\nthe law. This was not a new rule. This was the Court's\nattempt to interpret what the rule meant when the rule\nfirst came on the books, and what it meant over time.\nMR. WAXMAN: Justice Ginsburg, with respect, we\ncited in our brief district court decisions in the 1980's\nthat were --\nQUESTION: Two district court decisions.\nMR. WAXMAN: And --\nQUESTION: Not a single court of appeals\ndecision.\nMR. WAXMAN: Both the Second Circuit in this\ncase and the Ninth Circuit in the Epstein case on which we\nrely characterized Amchem as heralding a new era, or being\na watershed decision, and our submission only is that for\npurposes of the new rules, doctrine that this Court\nannounced, for example, in Teague v. Lane and following\ncases, the burden is on the party that seeks to invoke the\nbenefit of a later-decided case to prove that a\nconscientious court prior to the announcement of the rule\nwould have been, quote, compelled to conclude that futures\ncould not be included in the class.\nNow, as to the standard of review, this Court's\ndecision -- this Court even in Teague itself, which was a\ncriminal case, the Court said, to be sure, in civil cases\nfinality concerns are far, far more important, and in\ncases like Brecht and Herrera, this Court has emphasized\nover and over again, even when a defendant's life is at\nstake, that on collateral review, in a subsequent review\nof a final judgment, the showing has to be, quote,\nnecessarily far higher to obtain relief than on direct\nreview.\nThis Court's decisions in the -- in jurisdiction\ncases, subject matter and personal jurisdiction cases,\nwhere we're talking about the fundament of the power of\nthe original court to decide the case prove that, if\nthere -- in Stohl v. Gotlieb, this Court pointed out that\nwith respect to the first proceeding, even without any\nexpress discussion of it, we have to assume, and we will\nconclusively presume that the original court had subject\nmatter jurisdiction unless it would have been a, quote,\nmanifest abuse of authority to have done so, and with\nrespect to personal jurisdiction, Durfee v. Duke and Iowa\nv. Baldwin and those other cases all stand for the\nproposition that if the prior court, quote, has decided\nthe question of jurisdiction over the parties as a\ncontested issue there will be no reinquiry into personal\njurisdiction.\nWe're not even advocating that rule in our\nsecond test. We're just saying, it should be deferential.\nQUESTION: These were all parties who were\nthere. Every case that you mentioned, Durfee, these\npeople weren't there, so -- and in habeas, all the\ncriminal cases, of course the defendant was there. These\nare two people who say, we weren't there, and we didn't\nhave a chance to litigate it.\nMR. WAXMAN: Justice Ginsburg, this is a\nrepresentative suit. There is a judgment that says, at\nthis point, with respect, there is a judgment that said,\nthese parties were there.\nNow, the analogy I think that would be\nappropriate here would be with reference to the -- the\ndefault judgment cases, where you can say, you can't have\na default judgment on jurisdiction because no one appeared\nto contest it. That can't happen in a representative\nsuit. As we pointed out in our blue brief, the judge\ncannot grant a default judgment in a class action. He has\nto --\nQUESTION: If the representation is adequate.\nMR. WAXMAN: He has to make the determination\nthat the representation was adequate, and it was made\nrepeatedly and affirmed repeatedly in this case.\nMay I reserve the balance of my time?\nQUESTION: Very well, Mr. Waxman.\nMr. Smoger, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF GERSON H. SMOGER\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. SMOGER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nMr. Isaacson in New Jersey and Mr. Stephenson in\nLouisiana had no injuries in 1984. They had no claim that\nthey could have brought in 1984. They bring the claim for\ntheir devastating cancers in 1998 and 1999, when they can\nunder their state law. They -- the -- they then get moved\nto dismiss, because others have somehow settled their\ncases without them ever being aware of it, for no\ncompensation, and told --\nQUESTION: Counsel may I ask you just kind of a\npreliminary question about the Isaacson case? I think the\nSecond Circuit may have justified Federal jurisdiction\nover that case under the All Writs Act, and I think this\nCourt recently in something called Syngenta said that\nwouldn't fly. What are we going to do about Isaacson,\nremand it?\nMR. SMOGER: Mr. Isaacson's here, so I wanted to\nsay that, but I think we do a remand.\nQUESTION: I think you have to.\nMR. SMOGER: Yes.\nQUESTION: In light of that case.\nMR. SMOGER: In light of Syngenta, yes.\nQUESTION: It was a state court matter.\nMR. SMOGER: In fact, it is exactly what we\nargued at the time --\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. SMOGER: -- when it was being removed.\nQUESTION: Yes. Thank you.\nMR. SMOGER: So I will just address Mr.\nStephenson in that case.\nQUESTION: Yes, okay.\nMR. SMOGER: Now, Mr. Stephenson is not here to\ncontest whether the overall settlement is fair or not.\nThat's not the issue. The issue here is whether he was\nproperly before the Court, and if he was not properly\nbefore the Court, he cannot be included in any judgment.\nThat's -- that's what the Second Circuit held, and the\nquestion then becomes, what's -- it becomes the question\nof jurisdiction. Is he -- in order to bind somebody to a\njudgment, they have to have notice and an opportunity to\nbe heard.\nIn the class action setting, we've come to an\naccommodation. We say that you don't have to personally\nbe there, but if you have notice, an opportunity to be\nheard, a right to opt out, and adequate representation,\naccording to this Court in Shutts, then we will say that\nyou are deemed to have been there.\nIn this case, Mr. Stephenson had none of those,\nand let me tell you why. To begin with, we're talking\nabout the question of representation and the adequacy of\nrepresentation.\nthere were no representatives selected, not a\nrepresentative reviewed for anyone. The representatives\nwere chosen by the plaintiffs after the court was\ncertified, after the notice was decided on, and when the\nnotice was going out, so there was nobody there to\nrepresent anyone at the time. The class representatives\nwere never specifically approved by the court. They were\nchosen by the plaintiff's counsel for the purposes of\ntrial. All the class representatives --\nQUESTION: Mr. Smoger, supposing this is back in\n1984, when the judgment is about to be entered, and the\nDow says in effect, you know, we think you really have a\nlousy claim on the merits, but we're willing to pay $200\nmillion if we -- we know that this will be the last of it.\nNow, your clients became ill in 19, what, 98?\nMR. SMOGER: 1996 and 1998.\nQUESTION: 1996 and 1998. How could the\ndefendant in this case, or how could the court in this\ncase have affected a settlement that would bind everybody?\nI mean, how about people who perhaps get sick in 2018?\nMR. SMOGER: Well, let's say, if the goal is the\nability to have unexposed people, people that have\nabsolutely no disease, to somehow take care of them, even\nin Amchem and Ortiz there were certain back-end opt-out\nrights that were insufficient.\nopt-out rights here, so one of the things the Court would\nhave to do is to give some kind of back-end opt-out\nrights. It would have to have some kind of mechanism to\ntake care of information that came as a result of science.\nIt's an interesting phenomenon that most cancers\ndon't occur until more than 20 years, of these kinds,\nafterwards. In actuality, with people exposed over 12\nyears, the present claimants probably didn't have anything\nrelated to Agent Orange, because it would be somewhat\nlater, in the 20 to 30 years, that they would actually get\ninjured, and that has to be taken care of if you want to\nlook at futures.\nThere also has to be some kind of insurance,\nsome kind of protective mechanism to look at the value of\nwhat you're getting so that the value for futures in\ncomparative dollars is equivalent. There are a lot of\nthings --\nQUESTION: Now, it sounds to me when you say all\nthose things that you're really saying, can't settle a\nclass action.\nQUESTION: Yes.\nQUESTION: At least not a mass tort action.\nMR. SMOGER: You can settle --\nQUESTION: Because the person who wants to\nsettle, you know, it's always open to any one of million\npeople in the action to come in later and say, now he\ndefines himself as a class in a way that wasn't\nrepresented before, not too hard to do, and he says, you\nshould have had a lawyer for that group, and there's just\nnothing anybody can do about it.\nNow, that, if that's so, you can't settle a mass\ntort class action, so --\nMR. SMOGER: I --\nQUESTION: So I'm putting it pretty strongly,\nbut I want to get your response to that, because that's\nthe kind of thing that's bothering me a lot.\nMR. SMOGER: Well, there's multiple questions\nhere. One is, the advisory committee in 1966 basically\nsaid it was inappropriate for mass torts. Now, if you're\ntrying to make --\nQUESTION: In other words, you say, that's okay.\nThat's not such -- I'm worried about it. You say, don't\nworry. The advisory committee says you shouldn't settle\nmass torts. They all should go to trial and, fine -- I'm\na little hesitant about that, considering asbestos is\neating up about $200 billion without people really getting\ncompensated, but I mean, I'd say that that's a possible\nanswer, and you know more about it than I do, I should\nthink.\nMR. SMOGER:\nquestion on how you can do it, at least you have to have\nthe fundamentals of having somebody represent those\nindividuals, and it's a person so that a lawyer can\nadvocate. If you have an individual that doesn't have an\ninjury, at least you have an advocate for that individual,\nand he's similarly situated, and asking for the same\nrelief as those people that were -- that he wants the\nrelief.\nQUESTION: Well, would it -- would it have been\nsufficient to say, have one class representative be --\nrepresent all those who were then asymptomatic that might\nlater get it, or would you have to break that down?\nMR. SMOGER: Somebody, if that person has\nseparate counsel advocating for them, then that's the\nfirst thing they could do and look at it. I mean, is\nit -- there is a certain difficulty --\nQUESTION: And in this case, as you just heard --\nMR. SMOGER: Yes.\nQUESTION: -- and as you know, there are two\nspecial things about it. One, this is not asbestos, and\nthe reason it's not asbestos is because asbestos involves\nfuture claimants whom I think most people would say have\nbeen hurt by the asbestos, and here, there are future\nclaimants, at least one side says, have not been hurt by\nAgent Orange. They are dying naturally, like 22 percent\nof us will, of cancer, and they're understandably upset,\nbut it wasn't Agent Orange that did it.\nNow, that's what Judge Weinstein thought, and\nthat's why, I take it, he felt that here, unlike asbestos,\nyou don't need that lawyer, that special class.\nNow, all I know is, that's -- this is the third\ntime that question has been raised and litigated. The\nfirst two times it was decided against you. Are we\nsupposed to sit here, knowing virtually nothing about it,\nand decide whether in this particular case that was right\nor wrong? How do we handle this case?\nAnd that's why they're saying, well, what you\nshould do is give some weight to the fact that this was\nalready decided against you twice, although with different\nclients.\nI'm looking for an answer. I'm not --\nMR. SMOGER: Well --\nQUESTION: I'm not trying to put an --\nMR. SMOGER: I --\nMR. SMOGER: I understand. You've given me a\nnumber of questions, but first of all, the first question\nwas never decided against Mr. Stephenson. Mr. Stephenson\nnever had an opportunity to say that he didn't get notice,\nor proper notice, and it's clearly that he wouldn't have\nsaid injured, and we've talked about before, the actual\nnotice that went out said it's limited to people who have\ninjuries, and then described it as injury, disease, death\nor disability. There was no way that Mr. Isaac -- that\nMr. Stephenson would ever have thought he was in the class\nthat had the right to opt out.\nIt's also true in this matter that the opt-out\nperiod ended before the settlement took place, so there\nwas never an opportunity of these people, of the uninjured\nto opt out of the class and have the rights that we give\nthem to have separate litigation.\nAs to the matter of the science, we can -- we\ncan speak to the, you know, speak to the science itself.\nIt has changed tremendously. I understand that Your Honor\nhas written -- has written on this in a footnote --\nQUESTION: - - as of 1984, and what you're saying\nis, it's changed. Now, is that change relevant?\nMR. SMOGER: I think the change is absolutely\nrelevant, because the possibility of the --\nQUESTION: I don't want to get you off the main\npoint. I was very interested in your basic answer, so\ncontinue.\nMR. SMOGER: The change in the science has been\ndramatic, and I'll just say very briefly that in 1984\nthese were not considered human carcinogens. Now they're\nrecognized as human carcinogens by the international\nagency, the research on cancer by the EPA, and it's -- the\nNational Academy of Sciences, so our scientific\nunderstanding is utterly changed because of the time it\ntakes to do those kinds of scientific types of proper\nstudies. That's what has to be taken into account when\nyou initially go about having a settlement and thinking\nabout futures, and that's why you have to think about all\nthe rights. If they had a separate advocate, those rights\nwould have all been, have been considered.\nQUESTION: But, I guess these points were made\nin prior litigation efforts, maybe not by Mr. Stephenson,\nbut these points were litigated, were they not?\nMR. SMOGER: Certain of the --\nQUESTION: Adequacy of representation, and\nnotice, and so forth?\nMR. SMOGER: The issue of adequacy, and the\nissue of the fact that there was never any adequates\nchosen does not appear in any decision, and that is one of\nthe questions. The question is, what does Mr. Stephenson\nhave to rely? There's not a designation of an objector\nthat's chosen. We're -- we're here --\nQUESTION: Well, you're saying that at no time\nin the previous reviews of this judgment was adequacy of\nrepresentation dealt with?\nMR. SMOGER: Adequacy was dealt with writ large,\nand I'll separate -- there's two types of structural\nadequacy versus prosecutorial adequacy, of how it's\nprosecuted. The large part of adequacy was discussed, but\nnot in the terms that -- of the existence of any specific\nrepresentatives, and as I said, again there were none to\nbegin with.\nQUESTION: But formally there had to be made\nan -- you couldn't have a class action. To certify the\nclass action there must be a finding of adequacy. There\ncertainly was such a finding. You're saying that that was\nincorrect, because your clients were not represented by\nanybody.\nMR. SMOGER: Well --\nQUESTION: To certify a class, you must find\nthat the representatives are adequately representing the\nclass.\nMR. SMOGER: Theoretically, Justice Ginsburg,\nbut in reality, Justice, Judge Pratt certified the class,\nsaying he'd find adequate representatives in the future,\nand he would find them.\nWhen Judge Weinstein certified the class, there\nwas still no representatives, and they were said that - - he\nasked the plaintiffs' lawyers to find them. It was\ncertified without any single representatives.\nQUESTION: I thought the adequacy was decided in\ntwo separate instances, first directly, when -- I think it\nwas Ivy and somebody out of Texas brought the same kind of\nclaim that you have brought now, and correct me if I'm not\nright, because I -- and they got to the Second Circuit and\nthe Second Circuit said no, you people were represented\nadequately, and that was similar.\nThen I thought the other time, which is not\ndirectly adequacy, was at the time of the settlement\nagreement some objectors came in, and they raised roughly\nthe same kinds of points you're raising now, and there\nJudge Weinstein said that the settlement was fair, and\nthen it went to the Second Circuit and they said it was\nfair, despite the presence of that objection. That's not\nadequacy, but it's raising the point that you want to\nraise, and base your adequacy argument on.\nSo those are the two things that I thought were\nrelevant. Now, am I right, basically, in that?\nMR. SMOGER: There were certain people, there\nwas one -- there was one objector in the record who was a\nvery informed objector, having been a law school classmate\nof Mr. Waxman. He did raise those personally.\nThere was also a lawyer that raised them who was\ntold that he didn't have any standing to raise them, and\nthere was a question.\ndescribes the future, the issue of adequate --\nQUESTION: What about the Texas litigation?\nMR. SMOGER: The Texas litigation took place,\nand the Second Circuit had an interesting finding there.\nThe Second Circuit said that since the people pre-1994\nwere getting the same compensation as the original, that\nas to those people there wasn't any difference, because\nthey were eligible for the same compensation, so the\nadequacy decision for the Second Circuit went to the fact\nthat the result, that the result was evenhanded between\nMr. Ivy that brought the case and the present\nrepresentatives.\nQUESTION: Is Ivy in the same position as\nStephenson?\nMR. SMOGER: No, because Ivy did -- was eligible\nfor money from the settlement funds. The settlement funds\nran out in 1994. That's why it's different. So they had\na very specific holding on efficiency in -- in -- before.\nGetting back to my other point on prosecutorial\nadequacy, the defend -- the petitioners would ask every\nclass member to constantly monitor adequacy to make sure\nthat all class actions are adequately handled, when they\nsay you can't challenge the adequacy. In this case there\nare two -- there's even a -- there's -- in prosecution of\nit, in not having ever had any people to represent the\nfutures, after the settlement was finalized in 199 -- in\n1988, there was a promise in -- in -- in the fairness\nnotice that there would still be an adjustment made if\nthere were future scientific findings. Nobody ever even\nbegan to look at that, because there was no representative\nto look for that.\nAlso, there was a $10 million reserve fund which\nthe -- which the defendants demanded in case of state\ncourt action, and they demanded that reserve fund, which\ncertainly anticipates that there would be further state\ncourt actions, they demanded that reserve fund go through\nthe year 2008, that in the event of any state court\nactions they would have money that they would get back,\nand that was out of the $180 million.\nIn -- that -- Judge Weinstein had said that that\nreserve fund would be stay -- would be held for futures\nafter 1994. In 1994, that reserve fund at petitioner\nDow's request was then given to the -- to the class\nassistance program, so the reserve fund that was supposed\nto be there to 2008, and had the capability of paying some\nmoney for post 1994 claimants, was also depleted.\nThat's -- I bring that up because that's the\nquestion you had -- the question throughout the\nproceedings, and as this Court said in Shutts, is -- that\nadequacy has to be at all times.\nQUESTION: In this proceeding, what deference\nshould we give to the -- based on the proposition that\nthis is collateral attack and not direct review, and that\nthere have been previous adjudications on this issue?\nWhat's the standard of -- of -- what showing must you\nmake, and what's the standard of review that the Court\napplies?\nMR. SMOGER: I -- the standard is de novo, and\nlet me say why. There are things that you cannot ask for\ncollateral review on. There -- there are many things in\nRule 23. For instance, in Amchem, the predominance\nquestion, that, that is for direct review, whether it, the\nclass is certified.\nThe question as to collateral review goes to due\nprocess protections, and the protections are -- go to in\npersonam jurisdiction.\nQUESTION: It's very odd that abuse of\ndiscretion is the standard on direct review, and on\ncollateral review you have a more generous standard.\nThat's very odd.\nMR. SMOGER: It's -- I don't find it -- I don't\nthink it's odd in the sense of what's being reviewed. The\nquestion that's being reviewed is whether Mr. Stephenson\nwas properly before the court. Whether somebody's\nproperly before the court is reviewed de novo by the\nsecond court because it's a jurisdictional question, so\nthe question, the limited question that's reviewed by the\nsecond court is, in this situation we're saying, somebody\ndoesn't have to be personally before the court --\nQUESTION: But the answer to that question turns on\nthe adequacy of the class certification and the rules for\nclass certif -- service, et cetera.\nMR. SMOGER: It does --\nQUESTION: And that has been reviewed under an\nabuse of discretion standard. Now you're asking us to\napply a higher one.\nMR. SMOGER: We're ask -- it's reviewed by an\nappellate court for abuse of discretion standard related\nto the person that made the claim in the prior, in the\nunderlying court. That person was there to appear, voice\nhis objections before the court, have -- have a chance to\npresent evidence, and was -- and the court had personal\njurisdiction of that person. That's why we think that\nthe -- the allusions to the habeas corpus are\ninapplicable.\nThe question, the fundamental question here is\nnot the settlement as a whole. It was, was Mr. Stephenson\nthere?\nQUESTION: Yes, yes, that's true, but that\nquestion was decided before in respect to another person.\nNow, in respect to that other person, if the Second\nCircuit has decided it, if he really is in the same\nposition as Stephenson, is that first decision, does it\nbear the weight of stare decisis?\nMR. SMOGER: At best.\nQUESTION: Stare decisis, though?\nMR. SMOGER: Yes. Yes.\nQUESTION: So that gives them something, but not\nmore.\nMR. SMOGER: It's -- it's, yes. It's only stare\ndecisis. There was no class represented. Ivy was there\nfor himself, and goes no far- -. I mean, that -- and that\nwouldn't -- and Ivy can't revisit it. That would be this\ndecision, this Court's decision in Moitie, in Federated\nStores v. Moitie, the -- that -- it wouldn't be for Ivy,\nbut Stephenson was not there. He didn't have a chance to\nmake his arguments, and he wasn't -- he --\nQUESTION: Well, but in some cases the fact that\nhe wasn't there has not -- is not going to mean that he\ncan get de novo review, I would think, of the\ndetermination that he's bound by the class settlement.\nYou're saying that when it comes to adequacy of\nrepresentation, it is de novo on collateral review?\nMR. SMOGER: On -- on notice, as -- as the Chief\nJustice wrote in the Shutts decision, the minimum of due\nproces is --\nQUESTION: But Shutts -- Shutts was not a\ncollateral review, I don't believe.\nMR. SMOGER: But the base -- my understanding is the\nbasis for this Court to review Shutts was that\nPhillips stated that there was a potential of collateral\nreview, and that's what gave Phillips standing to be\nbefore the Court, and in -- in that case the Court decided\nthe jurisdictional standard that would allow -- and it set\na minimal jurisdictional standard. You don't -- Phillips\nhad argued you personally have to be there, and this Court\nsaid no, you don't. We'll -- we'll deem you to have been\nthere if you have notice and opportunity to be heard, and\nopportunity to opt out, and adequacy of representation.\nAnd the adequacy of representation is very\nimportant because we have to assume that the person\nrepresenting somebody had the same interests at heart as\nthe person who's never before the court.\nQUESTION: Suppose I agree with you on that.\nOne -- and suppose I agree with you so far.\nMR. SMOGER: Yes.\nQUESTION: Just suppose, for argument, and I\nsay, okay, sure, person, claimant, class member number\n1,000,743 can raise for the fourteen thousandth time class\nrepresentation being inadequate, if he wants. He's\nprobably going to lose because of stare decisis, but he\ncan do it if he wants.\nNow, if that's the analogy, here, I would say --\nthe Second Circuit let him raise it and then said he's\nright, but the reason they said he's right, departing from\ntheir prior decisions, is because of our Amchem and Ortiz\ncase. Now, suppose I think Amchem and Ortiz don't really\ngovern. What am I supposed to do with this case, send it\nback? Or at least, they're relevant but not\ndeterminative.\nMR. SMOGER: Well, let me --\nQUESTION: What do I do?\nMR. SMOGER: Let me raise two things, because\nwhen the Second Circuit here said it, and Judge Cardamone\nsat on both Ivy and this case. He was on both cases and\nsaid we never considered this before, and when he said we\nnever considered this before, it was that this person was\ngetting nothing, and their justification in Ivy, that\nthe -- that Ivy was still eligible for funds was no longer\napplicable to Stephenson, who was eligible for nothing, so\nthat's one part of, of, of the equation.\nThe other part is that adequacy itself, once --\nwe go to what's litigated before. What happened after the\nsettlement has never, could not have been litigated\nbefore, and it was never -- the adequacy deficiencies that\noccurred after the settlement were not before any court\nbefore.\nQUESTION: When you say, after the settlement,\ndo you mean after the settlement figure was announced but\nbefore the judge made the division of proceeds and so on?\nMR. SMOGER: No, after -- well --\nQUESTION: Or --\nMR. SMOGER: -- after the judgment. I mean --\nQUESTION: After the judgment was entered?\nMR. SMOGER: Yes, after the judgement there's --\ncontinued the inadequacy, even after the settlement. I\nmean, it's a peculiar fact in this case in terms of the,\nthe actual settlement and the fairness hearing, the --\nwhether somebody had a reasonable right to object\nwhen the fairness hearing gave no distribution at all, and\njust basically dumped the money into the judge as parens\npatriae and said, decide it however you want without\nrepresentation, the petitioner seems to think that's okay,\nand I think that that would be a very difficult rule of\nlaw to say that you can get around any due process\nprotections and any injustice just by putting money into\nthe -- into a court. That's -- courts would have those\nresponsibilities in every case, because that absolves all\nthe parties of anything that might be -- that might have\nbeen wrong in any type of representation.\nThank you.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Smoger.\nMr. Waxman, you have 2 minutes.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. WAXMAN: Justice O'Connor, the -- the\nIsaacson case can't just be remanded, because we assert\njurisdiction under 1442.\nJustice Breyer, it is not the case -- adequacy\nin general, and specifically with respect to futures was\nspecifically raised and determined before the judgment\nbecame final as well as in Ivy/Hartman. The Second\nCircuit's decision at 818 F.2d 167 says, quote, appellants\nargue that the diverse interests of the class make\nadequate representation virtually impossible. We\ndisagree. They were responding to a brief that\nparticularly brought the precise issue to their attention,\nand --\nQUESTION: I still want to know what to do with\nthis case. I mean, what do I do with this case?\nMR. WAXMAN: I -- we think that you should\nreverse the judgment --\nQUESTION: I mean, he's not bound, Stephenson\nisn't bound by some other person raising that, but it's\nstare decisis, like --\nMR. WAXMAN: He is indeed bound --\nQUESTION: Because?\nMR. WAXMAN: -- by the final judgment of this\ncase both because he was adequately represented, and a\ndetermination after a full consideration was made. He\nwas -- our submission is that there's no argument that --\nthat procedures that were enacted to protect due process\nin the vast majority of cases were followed, and therefore\nhe's bound under Walters and those other, that due process\nline, and in any event, if you take a look at adequacy you\nshould, a) give tremendous deference, and because the\nissue has been decided, because the consequences of not\ngiving deference would be unbelievably unsettling.\nThese adequacy determinations are not easy, and\nres judicata doesn't exist for the easy cases. The\nconsequence of hundreds, if not thousands of other\ncases -- thank you, Your Honor. I see my time has\nexpired.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr. Waxman.\n"
