        "content": "(10:04 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: We'll hear argument\nnow in Number 01-309, Larry Hope v. Mark Pelzer.\nMr. Jones.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF CRAIG T. JONES\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. JONES: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and\nmay it please the Court:\nUnder United States v. Lanier, the law was\nclearly established for purposes of qualified immunity\nwhen it gives officials fair warning that their conduct is\nunlawful. The fair warning standard is met when a rule\nlaid out by prior law applies with obvious clarity to the\nconduct in question, even if the rule arises from a case\ninvolving different facts.\nThe materially similar facts requirement of the\nEleventh Circuit is an unwarranted gloss upon the fair\nwarning standard, just like the fundamentally similar\nfacts requirement which this Court unanimously rejected in\nLanier. It is an impermissible gloss because it\nemphasizes similarity of fact over clarity of ruling.\nQUESTION: And what should be the rule that you\nsay was violated here? If we write out the opinion, we'd\nsay the rule that the officer should have known is, and we\nhave to fill in the blank. What is that rule?\nMR. JONES: The rule established by the Eleventh\nCircuit's own precedent is that it is unconstitutional to\npunish an inmate through the use of restraint, and\nrestraint is punitive if it goes beyond the point in time\nwhich is necessary to quell a disturbance or immediate\nthreat.\nQUESTION: Does the include solitary\nconfinement?\nMR. JONES: No, Your Honor. Restraint involves\ntotal physical immobility coupled with the pain and\ndiscomfort attendant to that.\nQUESTION: And what case establishes that\nproposition?\nMR. JONES: Well, there is a --\nQUESTION: Any physical restraint is unlawful.\nWhat case establishes that?\nMR. JONES: Physical restraint, the precedents\nspeak of physical restraint to a fixed object.\nQUESTION: Yes, and what precedent in\nparticular?\nMR. JONES: Gates v. Collier is the first case\nof a body of law which has developed in our circuit,\nJustice Scalia. Gates v. Collier was a 1974 Fifth Circuit\ndecision which was binding upon the present Eleventh\nCircuit and it held that a variety of forms of corporal\npunishment --\nQUESTION: That's my problem. It was a whole\nvariety. They didn't say that any single one. I mean, as\nI recall that case, there are a number of instances of\nbrutality against prisoners, and the holding of that case\nwas that that was cruel and unusual punishment, but I\ndon't recall that case saying that any single one of the\nmany instances that the case recited, one of which was\nphysical restraint, would qualify.\nMR. JONES: Your Honor, the Fifth Circuit\ndecision in Gates affirmed a district court decision which\nspecifically enjoined each and every one of those\npunishments, and the fact that --\nQUESTION: And you think that amounts to a\nholding that any single one of them would have violated\nthe Eighth Amendment?\nMR. JONES: Yes, Your Honor, if used punitively,\nthat is correct, and --\nQUESTION: But the court ordered stopping each\nand every one of those measures. Wasn't that the nature\nof the injunctive degree, not just a combination of them,\nbut each one?\nMR. JONES: Yes, Justice Ginsburg. This was not\na case where the court viewed the totality of the\ncircumstances and said that the conditions constituted\ncruel and usual punishment and ordered the State of\nMississippi to build a new prison. This was a case where\nthe State was specifically enjoined --\nQUESTION: Did the reasoning follow that line?\nMR. JONES: Well --\nQUESTION: Was the reasoning of the opinion, did\nit examine each one individually and say each one\nindividually was cruel and unusual?\nMR. JONES: It examined a variety of practices,\nand those practices were discussed in a subsection called\ncorporal punishment. The fact that Gates involved\nmultiple holdings does not make it any less important in\nclearly establishing the law, otherwise a case could only\nclearly establish the law if it had a single holding. The\nfact that Gates v. Collier drew multiple bright lines as\nopposed to a single bright line did not make --\nQUESTION: Do we need --\nMR. JONES: Yes.\nQUESTION: In this case, do we need to get into\nthe issue, Mr. Jones of what this Court's holdings amount\nto on this subject, or are we just limiting ourselves to\nthe Eleventh Circuit, perhaps the old Fifth Circuit?\nMR. JONES: With respect to the underlying\nconstitutional violation, or with respect to qualified\nimmunity analysis?\nQUESTION: With respect to each.\nMR. JONES: Well, Your Honor, this Court has\nnever squarely addressed the constitutionality of\ncontinued restraint as a form of corporal punishment. It\nhas acknowledged in decisions that restraints can be\nharmful.\nQUESTION: I suppose one would have to do that,\nyes.\nMR. JONES: Yes, that's correct.\nQUESTION: Are you relying on anything beyond\nthe restraint itself? I mean, in the facts that have been\nrecited, the facts include leaving the individual in the\nsun without a shirt on, and not giving him bathroom\nbreaks, and pouring water out in front of him to taunt\nhim. Are you relying upon those features?\nMR. JONES: Not as -- not for the proposition\nthat the law was clearly established, with regard to those\nfacts. Those facts are certainly relevant on the issue of\nthe damages suffered by the\nQUESTION: Well, do we have to assume that the\nfacts as alleged are true for purposes of deciding whether\nsummary judgment is appropriate?\nMR. JONES: Based -- Justice O'Connor, based\nupon the grant of certiorari by the Court, the issues\nraised in the petition, and the grant, I think that is\ncorrect.\nQUESTION: I would assume we -- I gather we just\nassume those are correct for purposes of evaluating the\nsummary judgment question.\nMR. JONES: I think that is correct.\nQUESTION: And the Eleventh Circuit decided\nthere was a constitutional violation?\nMR. JONES: Yes, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: And there was no cross-appeal on\nthat.\nMR. JONES: That is correct, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: So do we take that as a given, too?\nMR. JONES: I think that this case is like\nSaucier, where the Court acknowledged that the first step\nbe the inquiry of whether there was a constitutional\nviolation made out by the facts. That was resolved by the\ncircuit court.\nQUESTION: Well, that gets back to the Chief\nJustice's question, and I'm wondering again if the Court\nwrites the opinion giving you the judgment that you seek,\nisn't it necessary for us to say, a) this law was clearly\nestablished, and b) it is a correct interpretation, a\ncorrect exposition of the Cruel and Unusual Punishment\nClause, so we are -- it would be a rather odd holding for\nus to say, well, this was established in the Eleventh\nCircuit, but we're not telling you whether or not that was\nright.\nMR. JONES: Well, I think, Justice Kennedy,\nbecause the certiorari was only granted on the second part\nof the Saucier test, that is, on the clearly established\ninquiry, the Court could limit its ruling to the issue of\nwhether the law was clearly established and whether,\nspecifically whether the Eleventh Circuit applied the\nproper standards in determining whether --\nQUESTION: Well, maybe Justice Kennedy is\nsuggesting that it's fairly included within the question\ngranted, that it's quite impossible for a judge to say\nthat it does or does not violate a clearly established\nconstitutional principle if he doesn't think that it\nviolates a constitutional principle at all, clearly\nestablished or otherwise. I mean, isn't -- doesn't -- the\none sort of wrapped up in the other?\nMR. JONES: Yes, Your Honor, and I think that it\nis fairly included. My point is that --\nQUESTION: I take it your position, though, is\nthat all we have to decide is whether the substantially\nsimilar standard is the proper standard, and if we say no,\nit's not, that's like Lanier, which was -- what was it? --\nsubstantially identical, I guess, wasn't it, something\nlike that?\nMR. JONES: The verdict was fundamentally\nsimilar --\nQUESTION: Fundamentally, yes.\nMR. JONES: --in Lanier.\nQUESTION: And if we say that that gloss, the\nsubstantially similar gloss was wrong, what you want us to\ndo is simply vacate and send the thing back, or do you\nwant us to go further and say, no, in fact, there -- we\ndetermined that there can be no sovereign -- that there\ncan be no qualified immunity here, because if we have to\ngo the second step, then we have to get into the issue, it\nseems to me, that Justice Kennedy has raised.\nMR. JONES: Your Honor, I believe that the\nfirst -- the issue of whether there's a constitutional\nviolation is fairly included within the questions which\nwere granted by the Court.\nQUESTION: All right. Now, if that's what we're\ngoing to get into, so we will determine what the violation\nwas and then get to immunity with respect to that\nparticular violation, we won't confine ourselves simply to\nthe substantially similar verbiage, then I go back to my\nearlier question, and I take it -- and I think you've\nanswered it, but I want to make sure I understand you --\nfor purposes of determining whether there's a\nconstitutional violation, you are not arguing, I take it,\nthat we should take into consideration the particular\ncircumstances of the day, the heat, the shirt, the\nbathroom breaks, the water, is that correct? All we look\nat is the restraint itself?\nMR. JONES: Yes, Your Honor, because the conduct\nof these defendants was to restrain this man as a form of\npunishment.\nQUESTION: And some of the allegations of the\nfacts have been questioned, and one point was about the\nlack of bathroom breaks. There's nothing in the\npleadings -- the pleadings didn't allege lack of bathroom\nbreaks, and how does that get into the cases if the other\ncircuits didn't mention that either?\nMR. JONES: Well, I think it got into the case\nbecause the respondents wanted to argue the case rather\nthan the law.\nQUESTION: But that had not been found below,\nand it hadn't been even asserted in the complaint, is that\ncorrect?\nMR. JONES: Yes, that is correct, except to the\nextent that the affidavit of the plaintiff was referenced,\nI think incorporated by reference into the pleadings.\nQUESTION: And the plaintiffs affidavit said\nthat specifically, that he wasn't allowed bathroom breaks?\nMR. JONES: The plaintiff's affidavit is that he\nwas left on the hitching post for 7 hours, and the fair\ninference that can be drawn from that is that he was\nrestrained for 7 hours without breaks, and there's\ncertainly no evidence rebutting that with respect to the\nsecond incident, which he was on the hitching post.\nThe first incident he was on the hitching post,\nthere is evidence that he was given one bathroom break,\nand he was taken down that incident only after 2 hours,\nwhich in itself is --\nQUESTION: That, we got into that. That is, I\nthink, disputed even as to the first instance because I\nthink that the State said he had been offered other breaks\nbut he had declined them. Well, that's one thing, and\nanother argument that was made about the background, if\nwe're going to get anything beyond the hitching, that the\nparticular officers' names were not involved in some of\nthe worst aspects of that.\nThat is, the officers that are named defendants\nhere didn't tell Hope to take off his shirt, and didn't\npour water in front of him and have the dogs drink it.\nThose were other people who are not named defendants, and\nyou don't contest that, do you?\nMR. JONES: I do not contest that reading of the\nrecord, Justice Ginsburg.\nQUESTION: They didn't keep him on there for\n7 hours, as far as we know. Do we know that they were in\ncharge of how long he would stay there?\nMR. JONES: We do not know that, Your Honor,\nalthough we do know that it was their expectation that he\nbe restrained indefinitely. Findings in other cases\nindicate that -- including the published case of Austin v.\nHopper, indicate that inmates were routinely left on the\nhitching post for the remainder of the day.\nQUESTION: You say indefinitely. According to\nthe prison policy, they were kept on until they agreed to\ngo back to the work crew without disrupting it, so that he\ncould have been released at any time that he said I'm\nready to go back on the work crew and do the work, right?\nMR. JONES: Justice --\nQUESTION: That's what the prison policy says,\nanyway.\nMR. JONES: Well --\nQUESTION: Now, is the contention in this case\nthat he was prepared to -- you see, I don't understand\nwhat they could have done. Here is a prison that has a\npolicy of having work crews. You don't contend that\nthat's cruel and unusual punishment, right?\nMR. JONES: That is correct.\nQUESTION: And the allegation is that this\nprisoner refused to work in one case, and disrupted a work\ncrew in another case, and according to the prison\npolicy -- I mean, you have to do something when he does\nthat. To take him back and say, oh, you know, you've got\nto go back to prison, he says yes, that's exactly what I\nwant. What was the prison supposed to do?\nMR. JONES: Well, Justice Scalia, in both\ninstances he was being punished for fighting. He was\nbeing punished for --\nQUESTION: Disrupting the work crew.\nMR. JONES: For an altercation.\nQUESTION: Okay.\nMR. JONES: An altercation which subsided at the\nwork site, which was miles away from the prison property,\nand after he -- in each instant after he was restrained\nand subdued, and whatever disruption he was a part of had\nabated, he was put into a van for 20 minutes without\nincident, another 20 minutes were spent transporting him\nto the facility without incident, he was then walked\nwithout incident, without the necessity for the use of\nforce, to the post.\nQUESTION: And the work rules were not brought\nup by the State. The Eleventh Circuit said specifically,\nwe are not going to consider these work rules because they\nwere never put in the district court record as a reason\nfor the officer's behavior in question.\nMR. JONES: That is correct, Justice Ginsburg,\nand if they were in the record, the evidence would also be\nthey were not followed, which was also consistent with the\nfinding of the Middle District of Alabama in the case of\nAustin v. Hopper.\nQUESTION: Quickly, what are we supposed to take\nas the fact? Do we take the fact in the second affidavit\nof Larry Hope?\nMR. JONES: Yes.\nQUESTION: Okay. There's nothing about bathroom\nbreaks in that.\nMR. JONES: That is correct, but the critical\ntime element here is the time it took them between the\ntime that the disruption had abated and the time that they\ndecided to punish him for past conduct which had occurred\nan hour earlier and 10 miles away. That is the critical\ntime element, not the amount of time --\nQUESTION: You say it's critical. Why is that\ncritical? I mean, must they decide to punish him\ninstantaneously or never?\nMR. JONES: It's critical, Your Honor, because\nrestraint is not a proper form of punishment under those\ncircumstances. They can suspend privileges, they can take\naway TV --\nQUESTION: You say no kind of restraint is\npermissible?\nMR. JONES: Not as a form of punishment. If\nthey need to restrain him to maintain order and discipline\nat the scene of exigent circumstances, that's perfectly\nproper.\nQUESTION: Or to make him go back to work. You\nsay that that issue is not in this case. You say that\nthere's not in this case the fact, contended by the State,\nthat the only reason he was restrained was to get him to\nagree to go back to the work crew, and that as soon as he\nsaid okay, I'll go back and I won't disrupt it any more,\nhe would have been released. You say that's not in the\ncase.\nMR. JONES: Yes, Your Honor, because if you\nfight with five prison guards, you're not going to be able\nto escape punishment simply by --\nQUESTION: So we should leave open -- even if we\ndecide in your favor, you want us to leave open the\nquestion of whether this prison could follow the policy\nthat it has in effect, namely, only restraining people\nthis way as a means of inducing them to go back to the\nwork crew. That would be left open.\nMR. JONES: Yes, Your Honor. We're not\nattacking the policy. We're attacking the conduct which\nwas used in this case in violation of clearly established\nlaw.\nThank you.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Jones.\nMr. Schlick, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF AUSTIN C. SCHLICK\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,\nSUPPORTING THE PETITIONER\nMR. SCHLICK: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nAn official is immune from personal liability\nfor violating Federal rights unless the violation would\nhave been clear to a reasonable officer. Where, as here,\nthe governing legal standard does not itself establish a\nviolation, the practical inquiry would be whether the\nviolation was established by case law is not\ndistinguishable in a fair way.\nQUESTION: What, in your view, is the governing\nlegal standard that you just referred to?\nMR. SCHLICK: The overarching standard would be\nthe Harlow v. Fitzgerald, where the law was clearly\nestablished. The --\nQUESTION: Well, I thought -- you're not\ntalking, then, about a substantive standard?\nMR. SCHLICK: In that, in the particular context\nwhere one looks to case law, this Court's decision in\nSaucier v. Katz uses the formulation whether the facts\nwere distinguishable in a fair way, and that would be an\nappropriate gloss as well. Now --\nQUESTION: I mean, we start with a prohibition\nfor substantive law, the prohibition against cruel and\nunusual punishment. Then how do we work ourselves down\nfrom there, or up from there, whatever you want to call\nit?\nMR. SCHLICK: Yes, Your Honor. We would urge\nthe Court in this case to take the case on the terms on\nwhich it was briefed and decided in the Eleventh Circuit,\nthat is whether the law they applied in the Eleventh\nCircuit in 1995 clearly established the violation. In\nthat context --\nQUESTION: Then we don't get into the question\nof our own view whether -- what the law might, or the\nresult might be in this case?\nMR. SCHLICK: Even under that approach, the\nfirst step would be to ask whether this Court's decisions\nthemselves gave clear notice, and the answer to that in\nour view would be no. It's only because of the Gates v.\nCollier decision that these officers had fair warning, had\nclear notice.\nQUESTION: So then the result could be one thing\nin the Eleventh Circuit and another thing in the Fourth\nCircuit?\nMR. SCHLICK: Yes, the -- it could be. This\nCourt hasn't definitively decided whether, when it takes a\nqualified immunity case, it should analyze the case in\nlight of its own law solely, or whether it should give\ngreater weight to the relevant circuits. In this case, we\nthink it would give most guidance to the lower courts to\nanalyze the case as the Eleventh Circuit did.\nQUESTION: But what is the standard that the\nofficers should have been aware of, first in the Eleventh\nCircuit, and then, assuming that we think we -- that this\ncase presents either the necessity or the proper\nopportunity for us to say what the national standard ought\nto be, what is the standard at a more specific level of\nabstraction than Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause that\nwe should be dealing with?\nMR. SCHLICK: Justice Kennedy, let me address\nthe Eleventh Circuit first. In the Eleventh Circuit, the\nreasonable officer would have looked to the Gates v.\nCollier decision, noted that it held that it violates the\nEighth Amendment to punish an inmate by handcuffing the\ninmate to a fence for a prolonged period of time, or cell\nbars for a prolonged period of time, or forcing him to\nmaintain an awkward position for a prolonged period of\ntime. The reasonable officer --\nQUESTION: Even if -- do you maintain that the\nissue of whether it was done only to get him to return to\nthe work crew is not in the case?\nMR. SCHLICK: Yes.\nQUESTION: We have to assume that he was just\nput on there to punish him, and he couldn't have been\nreleased if he had said I'm ready to go back to the work\ncrew?\nMR. SCHLICK: Yes, Justice Scalia. The Eleventh\nCircuit we think correctly explained that's not a fair\ninference from the record as we must take it.\nIn the Eleventh Circuit, the reasonable officer\nwould -- could not have concluded that there is a\nconstitutional difference between handcuffing an inmate to\na fence or a cell bar and handcuffing an inmate to a metal\npole. Accordingly --\nQUESTION: For purposes of punishment?\nMR. SCHLICK: For purposes of punishment.\nQUESTION: You have to add that.\nMR. SCHLICK: Yes, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: And you're content to have us hold\nthese officers liable when a few years down the line we\nmay find that the Eleventh Circuit's opinion was wrong?\nMR. SCHLICK: Your Honor, we don't suggest a\nview one way or the other on liability. We're simply\nsuggesting that to grant qualified immunity at this stage\nof the case was improper. That brings me, though, to the\nsecond question --\nQUESTION: Well, I understand, but I mean, they\nwould be stripped of their qualified immunity even though\nthe Eleventh Circuit's opinion was wrong, and we find it\nto have been wrong when we finally confront that issue.\nMR. SCHLICK: I think that suggests Justice\nKennedy's second question, which was, absent Gates, how\nwould the case be viewed, and in that situation --\nQUESTION: And don't you think we have to reach\nthat?\nMR. SCHLICK: No. No, we don't think so, Your\nHonor, because it wasn't included in the petition or in\nthe questions on which this Court granted certiorari, and\nreally it hasn't been squarely faced by the parties,\nbecause the State is defending the Regulation 429 rather\nthan the facts that must be taken as true in this case.\nQUESTION: Well, it's not defending Regulation\n429, according to you. Regulation 429 as it reads says,\nhe is released as soon as he agrees to go back to the work\ncrew without disruption.\nMR. SCHLICK: That's right. My point, Justice\nScalia --\nQUESTION: So regulation 429 is not in the case,\naccording to you.\nMR. SCHLICK: -- is that the respondents have\nbriefed the case as if they were acting in compliance with\nRegulation 429, which is not in our view how the case must\nbe taken. Now --\nQUESTION: At least the case in the Eleventh\nCircuit, because it wasn't in the case. It wasn't in the\ncase before the district court. It was -- in the district\ncourt it was just restraint as punishment. The idea of\nthis being a temporal measure to get him to go back to\nwork doesn't show up till the Eleventh Circuit, and the\nEleventh Circuit rejects it because it wasn't raised in\nthe district court.\nMR. SCHLICK: That's correct, Justice Ginsburg.\nQUESTION: So the regulation is not before us,\nyou're saying.\nMR. SCHLICK: That's correct.\nQUESTION: Okay.\nMR. SCHLICK: To answer Justice Kennedy's second\nquestion, how would this Court address the issue if Gates\nv. Collier did not exist, in that case, a reasonable\nofficer -- the question would be, what would a reasonable\nofficer -- what would have been clear to a reasonable\nofficer. The reasonable officer could have made a\ncolorable argument that the appropriate analysis is the\ndeliberate indifference standard established by this\nCourt's decision in Farmer v. Brennan, that standard being\nwhether the officer was deliberately indifferent to a\nsubstantial risk of serious harm.\nThe reasonable officer could further have\nconcluded that neither the May incident in this case nor\nthe June incident in this case presented a substantial\nrisk of serious harm.\nQUESTION: So you think deliberately indifferent\nis a sufficient standard for the imposition of liability\nwithout more specificity. All officers must be aware that\ntheir specific acts can be challenged under the general\nstandard of deliberately indifferent.\nMR. SCHLICK: Yes, we think it would be\nsufficient to establish a substantive violation of the\nEighth Amendment, although as the facts must be taken\nhere, qualified immunity would attach, because there's a\ncolorable argument that the threshold was not crossed, but\nI'd want to say that this Court has not resolved whether\nit's this deliberate indifference standard or rather the\nHudson v. McMillian test, the excessive force test of\nwhether force was used maliciously and sadistically to\ninflict harm, and that is an unresolved question, is,\nit's -- that is that very absence of certainty that would\nbe most relevant absent the Gates v. Collier decision. In\nthis --\nQUESTION: Suppose I think that I have to reach\nthe question of whether it would violate the Constitution,\nnot just whether the Eleventh Circuit said it would. Do\nyou think it would violate the Constitution to make the\ninmate stand in a corner, to immobilize him to that\nextent?\nMR. SCHLICK: You would need to know more,\nnot --\nQUESTION: To go stand in the corner.\nMR. SCHLICK: Not in all instances, no, Your\nHonor.\nQUESTION: So what makes the difference is, you\nsay stand in the corner, and I'm going to handcuff you,\nand that's the difference between cruel and unusual, and\nnot cruel and unusual?\nMR. SCHLICK: The relevant considerations,\nJustice Scalia, would be the degree of pain and the threat\nto the safety of the inmates.\nQUESTION: It's not necessarily the degree of\npain. Being handcuffed to some immobile object, any --\nnot much more than standing in a corner.\nMR. SCHLICK: The overarching question of\nwhether the pain was wanton and unnecessary would focus on\nthe degree of pain, the penalogical justification, and the\nthreat to the inmate's safety, so you would need to know\nthe facts that bear on those inquiries.\nIn this case, as I've said, the Eleventh Circuit\ndecision of Gates v. Collier was directly on point. It\nprovided sufficient certainty for the officers here, and\nit was correct in that as applied to these facts, under\nthis Court's decisions, there was an Eighth Amendment\nviolation.\nQUESTION: I didn't understand your last\nstatement. You say, it would depend on the facts, the\ndegree of pain, the circumstances. I thought your argument\nfor the proposition that any physical restraint as a form\nof punishment is bad.\nMR. SCHLICK: No, Your Honor. That --\nQUESTION: You're not.\nMR. SCHLICK: It's the petitioner's position,\nbut not a position of the United States.\nQUESTION: Ah. All right. All right. All\nright.\nMR. SCHLICK: If the Court has no further\nquestions --\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Schlick.\nMr. Forrester, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF NATHAN A. FORRESTER\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. FORRESTER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nIn the last 15 years, at least eight Federal\nmaster judges and eight Federal district judges in Alabama\nhave read the law to hold that handcuffing a prisoner to a\nrestraining bar or to a similar stationary object does not\nviolate the Eighth Amendment.\nQUESTION: Have they discussed Gates? I didn't\ngo to look at the district court opinions, though you\ncited them, but did those opinions discuss Gates?\nMR. FORRESTER: No, Justice Souter, they didn't\npointedly cite Gates.\nQUESTION: Did they just ignore the pre-Eleventh\nCircuit precedent? I mean, how did they get by without --\nMR. FORRESTER: Primarily they refer to the\nsubsequent authority in Williams v. Burton and Ort v.\nWhite, and I don't think that we can presume that they\nstargazed and ignored it, or that they just thought that\ncase really had been largely superseded by this subsequent\nclarifying authority.\nQUESTION: What was the subsequent clarifying\nauthority? Gates was a specific injunction. It said, we\nwon't use physical restraints or punishments. What came\nafter from the Eleventh Circuit that modified that\ninjunction?\nMR. FORRESTER: Well, the proposition for which\npetitioner's amici wish this Court to read Gates and say\nthat our respondents should have read Gates is this very\nbroad proposition that any form of restraint as a form of\npunishment is unconstitutional, although that proposition\nhas clearly been narrowed not just by the Eleventh\nCircuit's rulings and rulings in Williams v. Burton and\nOrt, which indicated that certainly in an excessive force\ncontext you could restrain a prisoner for a period of\ntime, but also by this Court's rulings in Wilson v. Seiter\nand Whitley v. Albers, and the clarifying ruling in Farmer\nv. Brennan, where this Court indicated that the fact that\na restraint was possibly objectively problematic is not\nenough to create an Eighth Amendment right. There had to\nbe --\nQUESTION: If we are assuming the fact as\nalleged, as it was used here, not to quell a riot, not to\nkeep things calm in an interim, but as a means of\npunishment -- because that's what I understood the\ninjunction in Gates was, not, you couldn't use restraints\nin a temporary situation, but that you could not use it\nstrictly for punishment purposes --\nMR. FORRESTER: Well --\nQUESTION: And that, as far as I know, hasn't\nbeen modified.\nMR. FORRESTER: A couple of responses to that.\nThe first is that the restraint was not used in this case\nas a form of punishment. Petitioner never alleged or\npresented evidence that it was used as a form of\npunishment. That phrase does not appear anywhere in his\nfirst affidavit or his second affidavit. He simply says\nthat he was put on the bar, and our respondents put him on\nthe bar not to punish him, per se, but because he was\nrefusing to work under the regulation.\nQUESTION: But you didn't bring up the\nregulations in the district court. At least the Eleventh\nCircuit said it was nowhere in the record.\nMR. FORRESTER: Well, first of all we think that\nthe Court's entitled to take judicial notice of it,\nbecause it is the law, that you don't have to actually\nintroduce the law into the record, but on top of that, it\nwas always in the mix. The district court -- the activity\nlog for the petitioner's first day on the bar is a copy of\nthe log that comes from the appendix to the regulations.\nQUESTION: What has that got to do with it, that\nreg? I mean, so what? That is, his allegation is that he\nwas left for 7 hours on a very hot day with his arms about\nover his head, standing up, and given no water, except\nonce, so there are 3 hours at least without any water.\nAll right, that's his allegation.\nNow, introduce any regulation you want, why\ndoesn't that create an issue for trial?\nMR. FORRESTER: Well, because, the Your Honor,\nthe most important fact there is that he could have gotten\noff the bar --\nQUESTION: I don't see anything, all right, that\nhe said that was so, and I don't see anything where\nanybody in the record said that was so.\nMR. FORRESTER: The regulation --\nQUESTION: So what is the regulation? Did you\nmove, did you say -- did you say -- I don't see in these\npapers in front of me, say that the reason we're entitled\nto summary judgment is, it was ordinary practice to let\nthe person go off, and then you'd cite that, and here\nthey're following ordinary practice.\nNow, maybe then they'd have to have replied, but\nI couldn't find anything like that. Where does it say\nthat in the trial court?\nMR. FORRESTER: No, Your Honor, we didn't say\nthat, but it was petitioner's --\nQUESTION: Then why isn't it --\nMR. FORRESTER: Because it was petitioner's\nburden, as the plaintiff, to set forth the facts that made\nthat his claim.\nQUESTION: They set forth facts.\nMR. FORRESTER: And once we --\nQUESTION: They set forth facts, and the\nquestion is, why doesn't that -- I gave you the facts, and\nwhy doesn't that present -- I would have thought as a\ntrial judge you'd say, of course that's an issue for\ntrial, unless, of course, there's something unusual here,\nsomething unusual that may be -- and you're saying --\nwhere is this counter thing in the trial court? I don't\nsee it. I have nothing -- I take it I should take this\ncase as there having been nothing along the lines you're\ntalking about in the trial court.\nMR. FORRESTER: The activity log that is in the\nrecord is --\nQUESTION: What page should I look at? I'll\nlook at whatever you tell me to look at in the trial\ncourt.\nMR. FORRESTER: It's pages 38 in --\nQUESTION: I read through once, and I could find\nnothing --\nMR. FORRESTER: I'm sorry, Your Honor. Pages 38\nand 39, the activity log.\nQUESTION: Where do you find that, the joint\nappendix?\nMR. FORRESTER: Of the joint appendix.\nQUESTION: 38 and 39?\nMR. FORRESTER: Yes, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Is that of the second incident? I\nthought there was no activity log of the --\nMR. FORRESTER: Yes, that's the first incident.\nQUESTION: All right. The activity log, as far\nas I see it, says nothing about what you're saying. It\njust says he was placed on a restraining bar for a fight.\nMR. FORRESTER: Yes, Your Honor. It refers to\nthe two --\nQUESTION: I've looked at it now. What does it\nsay?\nMR. FORRESTER: It refers to the two conditions\nthat are the conditions for using the restraining bar\nunder reg 429.\nQUESTION: Why don't you read that?\nMR. FORRESTER: Refusing to work and being\ndisruptive to the work squad.\nQUESTION: And what it says is, refusing to\nwork, fight.\nMR. FORRESTER: Yes, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: That's the reason that they put him\non the bar. Okay. Now what?\nMR. FORRESTER: Yes, Your Honor. Now, the\nbottom of the next page -- unfortunately there's a\ntypographical error in this appendix, but it says, Annex A\nto AR 119. That should be 429, and we have gone back and\nchecked. The actual copy of this log in the record says,\nAR 429.\nQUESTION: Yes, and it says that right after it\nsays, restraining bar to be used only during daylight\nhours, Annex A to AR-119, so -- now, what has that to do\nwith it?\nMR. FORRESTER: That refers -- that's actually\n429, and that is the regulation.\nQUESTION: Okay. Let's suppose that you're a\ngenius as a trial judge, and you happen to know that when\nit says here AR-119 it means AR-429, okay. Now, what it\nsaid is, restraining bar to be used only during daylight\nhours, cite, 429. Now, how does that help?\nMR. FORRESTER: Well, reg 429 is what these\nrespondents were following when they put him on the bar,\nand this petitioner has not alleged that when he was put\non the bar he could not have gotten off.\nQUESTION: Okay. I'll take that into account.\nMy other question is whether or not it is the\ncase that any human being would know that it is cruel and\nunusual to keep a person, if that's what happened -- it's\nwhat he's alleged -- keep a person chained with his arms\nover his head, handcuffed to a bar, for 7 hours, in the\nhot sun, not giving him water but for once, so he goes at\nleast 3 hours without water.\nNow, is there a case that would confuse what I\nthink would be ordinary common sense on that -- at least,\nor tell me why that isn't ordinary common sense to think\nthat that is very cruel, and certainly an unusual thing to\ndo.\nMR. FORRESTER: Yes, Your Honor. Let me preface\nmy response with one quick -- he wasn't cuffed with his\nhands over his head. They were chest high. His own\npictures show that in the joint appendix, but I would draw\nYour Honor's attention to a district court opinion which\nis transcribed in the joint appendix. It starts at --\nQUESTION: One of my pictures happens to show\nit's slightly up here, his hands, and the others show it's\nabout eye level.\nMR. FORRESTER: And he's slumping.\nThe -- I would like to draw Your Honor's\nattention to this district court opinion that is\ntranscribed in the joint appendix at page 81. It's\nentitled, Whitson v. Gillikin, and this was a 1994 case.\nThis was 1 year before the events in this case. Jim\nGates, who is one of the respondents here, was a defendant\nin this case, and in this case the prisoner alleged that\nhe was put on the bar for 8 hours in 95-degree heat, which\nis hotter than this case, was not given any water, was not\ngiven any bathroom breaks, which has not been alleged in\nthis case.\nThe district court, or rather the magistrate\njudge appointed counsel for this pro se litigant,\ninstructed counsel to go out and provide supplemental\nbriefing on the question of whether that circumstance\nviolated a clearly established right, and the court said,\nI have done my own diligent search -- this is on page\n89 -- the court has made a diligent search of the case\nlaw, I requested additional brief from the parties, and\nneither the court nor the parties have identified any\ncases binding or otherwise in this circuit in which it was\nfound that the Eighth Amendment as violated in these\ncircumstances.\nNow, we submit that if you have a learned\nauthority such as this reading the law that carefully and\nnot finding it in this manner, it would be exceedingly\nunfair to hold our respondents --\nQUESTION: This is --\nMR. FORRESTER: -- responsible for doing the\nsame.\nQUESTION: -- a post -- post Gates?\nMR. FORRESTER: Yes. This is a 1994 case. This\nis 20 years after Gates.\nQUESTION: And it seems to me exceedingly\ncareless for the counsel who was appointed not to bring\nthat to the magistrate judge's attention.\nMR. FORRESTER: Your Honor, in 28 years since\nGates v. Collier, no Federal court of which we are aware\nhas ever read it for the broad principle that petitioner\nnow seeks to read it in this case. It's clear in the\ncontext of Gates v. Collier that the officers there were\nemploying -- were handcuffing prisoners to cells and to\nfences for malicious and entirely arbitrary reasons. They\nhad no valid penalogical purpose whatsoever.\nQUESTION: The more drastic episode in this case\nwas the second episode, and there you can't even point to\nan activity log, didn't even write it up. The State\ntreated it as though it didn't happen.\nMR. FORRESTER: Well, Your Honor, it's not clear\nthat they didn't write it up, and furthermore it wasn't\nrespondent's responsibility.\nQUESTION: Whose burden was it -- whose burden\nwould it be to show an entry in the activity log? After\nall, the prisoner doesn't -- is not the custodian of that\nlog. Isn't it the State's obligation to bring it forward,\njust as it was brought forward with respect to the first\ninstance?\nMR. FORRESTER: Yes. We attempted to find it,\nand just couldn't find it, and these three respondents,\nmoreover, were not personally responsible for the activity\nlog. They weren't responsible for keeping it because they\nweren't the one supervising him, and they weren't\nresponsible for his custody after it was kept.\nQUESTION: They weren't responsible for how long\nhe was left on the bar, either.\nMR. FORRESTER: Correct, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Which makes me wonder whether it was\nyour burden to bring in the regulation or, rather, whether\nit was the burden of the plaintiff to show that these\ndefendants, when they put him on the bar, knew that he\nwould be left on the bar for 7 hours, and if that was\ntheir burden, it seems to me it's not up to you to\nvolunteer the defense which is in the public record, that\nin fact, if the prison policy was followed, he wouldn't\nhave been left there for 7 hours as soon as he agreed to\ngo back to the work crew.\nQUESTION: But it's your position, I take it,\nthat so long as the regulation was in place so that he\ncould go back to work, that the State could legitimately\nkeep him --\nMR. FORRESTER: Yes.\nQUESTION: -- hanging to this rail for as long\nas it takes, no matter how hot it is, and without water,\nfor as long as the State chooses to use it, just so long\nas the regulation is there that says, you can go back to\nwork?\nMR. FORRESTER: No, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Is that your position?\nMR. FORRESTER: No, Your Honor, not hanging from\nthe rail.\nQUESTION: Well, like this.\nMR. FORRESTER: Chest high -- chest high, like\nthis --\nQUESTION: All right.\nMR. FORRESTER: -- where he can stand fully\nerect --\nQUESTION: In this case, handcuffed to the\nrail --\nMR. FORRESTER: Yes, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: -- for as long as the State wishes\nwithout administration of water or bathroom breaks, just\nbecause there's a regulation that says he can go back to\nwork. That's your position?\nMR. FORRESTER: No, Your Honor. The regulation\nclearly entitles him to regular water and bathroom breaks.\nQUESTION: But the allegations are that he was\nnot given water and not given bathroom breaks. We take\nthose allegations as true for purposes of a summary\njudgment motion.\nMR. FORRESTER: No, Your Honor, he did not\nallege, ever, nor present evidence that he was denied a\nbathroom break, and he did not allege that he was denied\nwater. He simply said that during one 3-hour stretch\nthese two other defendant, nondefendant officers, who are\nclearly not these three respondents, deprived him of water\nand -- you know, in acts --\nQUESTION: -- certainly in the hot sun for 3\nhours without water is fine. That's fine?\nMR. FORRESTER: If it is being done because he\nhas refused to work -- and I would hasten to add, Your\nHonor, this is --\nQUESTION: But we have nothing in the record, as\nI understand it, to indicate that. Your position on that,\nas I understand it, is that's what the regulation makes\nclear, that that's why they were doing it, but the\nregulation is not on the record, and I don't see any basis\nupon which a United States district court is required to\ntake judicial notice of every State's prison regulations\nif the State doesn't want to put it into the record.\nMR. FORRESTER: Yes, Your Honor. I mean, I\nwould note that even in the absence of the regulation the\ndistrict court didn't find his allegations in evidence\nsufficient to make out a claim that would withstand\nqualified immunity, so introducing that only makes the\ncase all that stronger, but I would hasten to add that the\nCourt did make a finding that he was put on the bar\nbecause he was disruptive to the work crew -- work squad.\nThat is the condition in the regulations. He was not put\non the bar for a strictly punitive purpose in the sense\nthat petitioners are arguing --\nQUESTION: Can you help me with this, Mr.\nForrester? The assumption seems to be in the State's\nargument that if you restrain a person in order to -- then\nchoose the word, convince, coerce him to do something,\nthat is not punishment. I thought one of the purposes of\npunishment was rehabilitation, or corrections, as well as\ndeterrence and prevention.\nMR. FORRESTER: Yes, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Why isn't this punishment if you're\ndoing this in order to have him comply with your command?\nMR. FORRESTER: Yes, Your Honor, it is certainly\npunishment in the broad sense. For instance, it is a part\nof prison life. We're not saying that it shouldn't be\nanalyzed as to whether it's cruel and unusual, but in the\nnarrow sense in which they are using it, and in the narrow\nsense in which Ort v. White sought to distinguish\npunishment from what it termed an immediately necessary\ncoercive measure, this requires --\nQUESTION: Yes, but Mr. Schlick, can I just ask\nyou about the case you called our attention to on page 89-\n90 of the -- and there, according to the magistrate\njudge's opinion, Judge Putman, in that case the plaintiff\nwas refusing to check out in his work detail, but then he\ngave him the choice of either working or being handcuffed\nto the security bar. There's no such allegation in this\ncase, is there?\nMR. FORRESTER: Petitioner never alleged that he\ncouldn't have gotten off the bar --\nQUESTION: But you didn't allege that you gave\nhim the choice, did you?\nMR. FORRESTER: The petitioner bears the burden,\nas the plaintiff, to say I could not have gotten off the\nbar if I had asked for it.\nQUESTION: I must say, I can't understand why\nthat wasn't put in by the State. I can't -- I cannot\nimagine why the State did not raise that point, that he\ncould have gotten off the bar at any time by just saying,\nI'll go back to work. Why -- what's your explanation for\nthat?\nMR. FORRESTER: Well, it is a regrettable --\nQUESTION: Regrettable, it's incomprehensible.\nMR. FORRESTER: -- litigation error.\nQUESTION: Why doesn't the -- Ort, which you say\nhe's the magistrate on page 89 and 90, supports your\nposition. Interestingly enough, that case is cited by the\nGovernment in support of its position, and I suppose the\nreason is because they make very clear in that case that\nit was unusual to deprive a person of water, and in that\ncircumstance, absolutely necessary, and so how, in this\ncircumstance, was it necessary to do what he says they\ndid?\nI was deprived of water, was teased by two\nofficers when I asked for water, on one occasion they\nstarted to bring me water but ended up giving it to some\ndogs, I was given some once or twice during 7 hours, but\nthat was not enough, and at one point during the hottest\npart of the day I was left without water for at least 3\nhours.\nAll right, so for a person reading the case of\nOrt, and then reading that, you would think that Ort\nactually supports the Government, not you, because --\nunless, of course, there's some reason that behavior like\nthat, if it occurred, would have been necessary, so what\nis the necessity, or what can you say about it?\nMR. FORRESTER: Well, I would hasten to add,\nYour Honor, those allegations that you keep reading again\nare not alleged against our three respondents.\nQUESTION: That's, of course, what you say, but\nwhat the allegation says is that it was your three\nrespondents. In -- on -- in the affidavit what he says\nspecifically on that is, he says, I believe that the\nofficer who actually put me on the hitching post was\ndefendant Sergeant Mark Pelzer. However, a report says I\nwas put there by defendant Gates, and an officer named\nMark Dempsey, and then McClaran wrote the report, and in\nMcClaran's reply he suggests he was there, and so I don't\nsee any denial here by your particular clients that they\nwere not responsible for this, and he alleges they were.\nQUESTION: Would that be your burden? Is that\ntheir burden to say, I was not responsible, or is it the\nplaintiff's burden to say, you were responsible for not\ngiving me water?\nQUESTION: That's not there. The language I\nread was the plaintiff's affidavit saying they were\nresponsible in his opinion.\nQUESTION: Responsible for putting him onto the\npost.\nMR. FORRESTER: We do believe it was the\nplaintiff's burden, Justice Breyer. The excerpt you just\nread actually refers to the first day he was on the bar,\nMay 11. The second day was not when Pelzer put him on the\nbar, but it is no way clear from that that either Pelzer\nor Gates, who it would appear put him on the bar, stuck\naround after that.\nQUESTION: It's an important point for me. I\nstill don't understand why coercion to comply with an\norder by a restraint is not a punishment.\nMR. FORRESTER: We do think it's punishment in a\nbroad sense. That's trying to make too fine a point. The\npoint I'm trying to respond to is their contention\nbasically that there was no valid penalogical purpose for\nputting him on the restraining bar, that this was somehow\narbitrary or retaliative, or retributive and not remedial,\nwhich was the purpose. The purpose here was to get him to\ngo back to work. It wasn't --\nQUESTION: But he says, and we must take this as\ntrue I think at this stage, I have no reason to say I'm\nwilling to go back to work because I never for a moment\nsaid I wouldn't work. They took me away from the work\nsite. In one case I was having a fight with somebody, but\nin neither case did I say, I won't work. This was not a\nman who said, I want to be back in my cell watching the\ntelevision and not working.\nMR. FORRESTER: Yes, Your Honor, but getting\ninto the altercation, actually getting to the point where\nhe had his blade raised and was ready to strike another\ninmate, is certainly disruptive to the work squad, and\nthat's a serious security issue for these --\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Forrester.\nMr. Schaerr, We'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF GENE C. SCHAERR\nON BEHALF OF MISSOURI, ET AL., AS AMICI CURIAE,\nSUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. SCHAERR: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nWe believe this case is controlled by any of\nthree common sense principles of law, each of which is\nessential if this Court's qualified immunity doctrine is\nto prevent the problems that it was designed to prevent.\nThe first is that where personal liability is at\nstake, public officials shouldn't be expected to be more\nadept at construing case law than the State court judges\nwhose decisions are reviewed in Federal habeas\nproceedings.\nNow, the United States appears to adopt a\nstandard that would be equivalent functionally to the\nstandard that this Court has already adopted in the habeas\ncontext, and we think the United States' argument in this\npoint is correct, and in fact we believe the Court has\nalready come close to adopting that standard in the\nSaucier decision, which said the proper inquiry is whether\nthe case on which a plaintiff relies occurred, and I\nquote, under facts not distinguishable in a fair way from\nthe facts presented in the case at hand. It seems to me\nthat is just another way of saying that the facts of the\ntwo cases can't be materially indistinguishable.\nQUESTION: Well, let me ask you a different\nquestion, though. What's the conceptual difference\nbetween materially similar, which was used here, and\nfundamentally similar, which was disapproved in Lanier?\nMR. SCHAERR: Well, as I understand, the\nfundamentally similar requirement required a much tighter\nfit between the facts of the two cases than the materially\nsimilar standard does, and I think --\nQUESTION: I mean, maybe you're right, but I\ndon't know that from looking at the two words. I mean, it\nsounds to me as though materially and fundamentally are\nsubstantially similar.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: I mean, I --\nMR. SCHAERR: And not materially -- you got it.\nQUESTION: But it's splitting it pretty fine, it\nseems to me, and wouldn't it be better, wouldn't it serve\nclarity better if we in effect said in this case, look,\nstop paraphrasing the standard, and just stick to the\nbasic standard, and that is, would it be clear to a\nreasonable officer?\nMR. SCHAERR: Well, it seems to me, Justice\nSouter, the way you answer that question is, you look at\nthe case law, and that's what at issue here. There's no\nallegation that the text of the Eighth Amendment or that\nany statute bars the conduct at issue here.\nQUESTION: So you're saying regardless of how\nthey paraphrased it, when you get down to the district\ncourt cases, on any standard, they ought to win. That's\nit. You're not resting anything on materially similar as\nthe right way to describe it.\nMR. SCHAERR: Well, I think it is important and\nuseful for this Court to make the link to the habeas\ncontext, because I think that would provide greater\nclarity in the law, and the ultimate standard under this\nCourt's decisions is whether official action violated\nclearly established law.\nWell, that's the exact -- that's exactly the\nsame phrase that's used in the habeas statute, and that\nthis Court has interpreted in Williams and Penry II as\nmeaning materially indistinguishable, and it would be\nuseful, and I think quite productive to apply that in this\ncontext as well, and would bring greater clarity to the\nlaw.\nQUESTION: But isn't that -- isn't it a concern\nfor the State court, because here we're talking about an\nofficer, and did he follow what was an Eleventh Circuit\ndecision.\nMR. SCHAERR: Right.\nQUESTION: There, we're talking about a Federal\ncourt overriding a determination by a State court, so I\ndon't think the settings are similar. There's a\nparticular concern that the habeas statute reflects, and\nthat is not overriding a State court's determination.\nMR. SCHAERR: Sure, but -- and I agree the two\nsituations are not entirely identical, but if anything it\nseems to me the section 1983 context raises even greater\nfederalism concerns, because as this Court recognized a\ncouple of terms ago in Geyer v. Honda, litigation can\noften be the functional equivalent of a statutory -- of a\nstatute or a regulation, and so what happens in the 1983\ncontext, as illustrated in this case, is that courts\narticulate broad rules that purport to govern the conduct,\nthe day-to-day conduct of elected and nonelected State\nofficials, and so it seems to me if anything the\nfederalism concerns are greater.\nIn another important way, public officials,\nnonlawyer, nonjudge public officials are at a disadvantage\nand that, as this Court noted in Saucier, and I quote,\npublic officials are often forced to make split-second\njudgments in circumstances that are tense, uncertain, and\nrapidly evolving, unlike judges, who can take all the time\nthey want sometimes to --\nQUESTION: Yes, but wait a minute, this is not\nsplit-second. We're talking 7 hours here.\nMR. SCHAERR: I agree with that, Justice\nO'Connor, but the standard, it seems to me, needs to apply\nto the full range of official action that would be covered\nby 1983.\nQUESTION: Yes, but you have to ask whether a\nreasonable officer in these circumstances would have known\nthat what was done was unconstitutional.\nMR. SCHAERR: I think that ultimately is the\nanswer, and it seems to me the way you answer that is\nasking the question posed in Saucier, of whether the two\ncases are materially -- well, are -- whether there's a\nfair distinction between the two cases, which seems to me\namounts to material distinction.\nQUESTION: If you're requested to advise the\ncorrectional officers in your State as to the standard,\nthe constitutional standard they must observe with\nreference to restraining inmates, and circumstances like\nthese, what is the standard that you tell them they must\nfollow?\nMR. SCHAERR: Well, I don't think that's clear\nfrom this Court's decisions at this point, as the United\nStates --\nQUESTION: Well, they come to you, and you're\ntheir attorney, and you have to figure out what we mean up\nhere.\nMR. SCHAERR: Well, at --\n(Laughter.)\nMR. SCHAERR: At worst -- at worst I would tell\nthem they have to follow the standard in Farmer. That is,\ntheir actions can't be objectively cruel, but they also --\nthey also cannot act with a subjective awareness of a\nserious harm to the inmates, and it seems to me that's the\nkey distinction in this case between Gates, or the key\nreason why Gates is not controlling here.\nGates was decided long before Whitley and Farmer and\nall of those decisions that made clear the subjective\nrequirement in the Eighth Amendment, and indeed if you\nlook at the Eleventh Circuit's opinion, there's not even a\nfinding of any awareness of serious harm that would come\nto these inmates. They just completely overlooked the\nserious harm requirement, and so it seems to me Gates,\nbased on this court's current cases, Gates is easily\ndistinguishable, and can't be taken as controlling here.\nNow, the second principle that I'd like to\naddress is the principle --\nQUESTION: Well, I don't see in Gates -- and I'm\nreading from page 1306, where they talk about being put in\nawkward positions, though.\nMR. SCHAERR: Right.\nQUESTION: I don't see any requirement of\nserious harm to the inmates.\nMR. SCHAERR: Well, that's right, and that's why\nit seems to me Gates had been overtaken by this Court's\nsubsequent decisions and therefore was not -- was no\nlonger binding, even if you take it on the terms that the\npetitioner was --\nQUESTION: What decision --\nQUESTION: Yes, what --\nQUESTION: -- of this Court do you rely on as\nchanging what Gates said?\nMR. SCHAERR: Well, Farmer added a new\nrequirement. Well, not just Farmer, but Farmer and the\nother decisions that preceded it added a requirement of\nsubjective awareness of a risk of serious harm. Gates\ndidn't impose that kind of requirement at all, and\ntherefore once this Court's decisions made clear that that\nsubjective requirement was present, Gates, it seems to me,\ncould no longer be regarded as controlling in this\nsituation, even if you interpret Gates on its own terms.\nas the petitioner would have you.\nQUESTION: Well, even if that were a\nrequirement, you think the allegations here don't suffice?\nMR. SCHAERR: No, I don't. At worst, the --\nQUESTION: That one would not -- a reasonable\nperson would not be aware that you couldn't restrain\nsomeone on a post or rail for 7 hours in the heat, without\nwater more than every 3 hours?\nMR. SCHAERR: Well, I think the question is\nwhether the harm that you could foresee from that -- and\nthe record does not suggest that he was without water. He\nsays that he received water only once or twice during that\n7-hour period. Lots of people go without water and food\nfor 24 hours.\nQUESTION: Yes, but also no bathroom breaks.\nMR. SCHAERR: I'm sorry.\nQUESTION: Also no bathroom breaks for 7 hours.\nMR. SCHAERR: There's no allegation of that in\nhis affidavit.\nQUESTION: Well, the court of appeals said there\nwas.\nMR. SCHAERR: The court of appeals made a\nmistake, and this Court has the ability to review the\nsummary judgment record de novo, and it's not a long\nrecord.\nBut that leads me to the -- to my second\nprinciple, and that is that a public official shouldn't be\nheld liable under section 1983, or shouldn't be stripped\nof his or her qualified immunity except on the basis of\nhis or her own actions based on reasonable inferences from\nthe summary judgment record, and it seems to me that\nprinciple is well-illustrated in the Saucier decision that\nthis Court decided last term.\nIndeed, as Justice Ginsburg recognized in her\nconcurrence in that case, the evidentiary predicate for\ndenying qualified immunity must consist of what Rule 56(e)\ncalls specific facts set forth in affidavits or other\nsimilar evidence. General allegations are not enough, in\nthe summary judgment context, even though they might be on\na motion to dismiss.\nQUESTION: Can I just ask you a specific\npoint --\nMR. SCHAERR: Yes.\nQUESTION: -- because he's right about -- my\nthing about the defendants was not June 7, it was, he\nalleges it. Is there any place in the record where it's\ndenied that these are the right defendants?\nMR. SCHAERR: With respect to some of the\nactivity, yes. I couldn't give you the pages as I sit\nhere, but the burden is on the plaintiff to make that\nrecord.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Schaerr.\nMr. Jones, you have 3 minutes left.\nMR. JONES: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and\nmay it please the Court:\nIf the Court has no questions, we submit that\nthe judgment of the court of appeals should be reversed.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Very well. Thank you,\n"
