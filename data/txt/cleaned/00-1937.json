LAMKEN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. LAMKEN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nCongress -- Congress designed the Social\nSecurity disability program to provide benefits to workers\nwho suffered from long-term disabilities, individuals who\nwere, in effect, forced into premature retirement by a\nsevere impairment. Consistent with the program's\norigin --\nQUESTION: Just a moment, Mr. Lamken.\nSpectators are admonished. Do not talk until\nyou get out of the courtroom. The Court remains in\nsession.\nGo ahead.\nMR. LAMKEN: Consistent with the program's\norigin, purpose, and text, the Commissioner has for 45\nyears from the program's inception, in adjudicating tens\nof millions of claims, and throughout repeated amendments,\nadhered to a single and consistent, reasonable\nconstruction of the definition of disability. To be\ndisabled, a claimant must have an impairment that has\nlasted or can be expected to last at 12 -- at least 12\nmonths at a disabling level of severity; that is, the\nimpairment must preclude substantial gainful activity for\nthe 12 months during which it must last.\nQUESTION: Well, now, presumably though, as I\nunderstand it, the Commissioner could evaluate a claim and\nstart benefits in less than 12 months.\nMR. LAMKEN: Correct, Your Honor. That's\nthat's because the statute allows the Commissioner to\naward benefits if the -- if the disabling impairment can\nbe expected to last 12 months. So, for purposes --\nQUESTION: And can disregard possibly periods of\nwork during that period if the commission is satisfied\nthat this is going to be a permanent impairment.\nMR. LAMKEN: Yes. If the work does not evidence\nan ability to engage in substantial gainful activity. For\nexample, the Commissioner has what are called unsuccessful\nwork attempt regulations. If they do not evidence an\nability to engage in substantial gainful activity, they\nmay be disregarded and treated as not evidence of the\nindividual's ability to engage in substantial gainful\nactivity.\nUnder the court of appeals' view, however --\nQUESTION: That seems sort of inconsistent with\nyour view on the second question that trial work periods\nshouldn't begin until the end of the 12 months.\nMR. LAMKEN: Your Honor, no. Our view is not\nthat the trial work period does not begin until the end of\n12 months. Our view is that the trial work period only\nbegins if the -- if the claimant actually becomes entitled\nto benefits at some point, and that's true because the\ntrial work period begins when the claimant becomes\nentitled to benefits. If the claimant never becomes\nentitled to benefits, he never receives a trial work\nperiod.\nQUESTION: What -- what provision in the\nlanguage of the statute says that you can't start a trial\nwork period until the end of 12 months?\nMR. LAMKEN: Again, it's not our position that\nyou can't start a work period -- a trial work period until\nthe end of 12 months.\nQUESTION: Well, you say unless the benefits\nhave started.\nMR. LAMKEN: Right, unless they are entitled to\nbenefits. And we would be relying on 422(c)(3), which\nappears on page 63a of the appendix to the petition for\nwrit of certiorari. And it says that a period of trial\nwork for any individual shall begin --\nQUESTION: Just a moment, Mr. Lamken. Exactly\nwhere on 63a are you reading?\nMR. LAMKEN: I'm sorry. It's at the bottom\nwhere it's numbered 3.\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. LAMKEN: And it says, a period of trial work\nfor any individual shall begin with the month in which he\nbecomes entitled to disability insurance benefits. If the\nindividual never becomes entitled to insurance disability\nbenefits, the individual also cannot, as a matter of\nlogic, become entitled to a trial work period.\nAnd that is also consistent with the -- with\nwhat the trial work period does. The trial work period\nprecludes the Commissioner from considering -- from\ntreating work as evidence that the disability has ceased.\nThe statute in the preceding paragraph number 2 uses the\nword ceased. That means that if the individual isn't\nactually already entitled to benefits, there can be no\ntrial -- there is no purpose in the trial work period.\nIt's only there for determining whether or not the\ndisability has ceased.\nQUESTION: Of course, the difference is the\nother side says that he becomes entitled not when he is\nadjudicated to be entitled, but he becomes entitled when,\nin fact, all of the conditions exist for which the -- the\nbenefits are payable.\nMR. LAMKEN: Yes, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Why aren't they right about that?\nMR. LAMKEN: Because the statute provides that\nthe individual is entitled to benefits if he has a\ndisability which can be expected to last 12 months or has\nlasted 12 months. That's most naturally read as referring\nto the time of the adjudication. In other words, when\nstatutes say if the following conditions are met, you're\nentitled to something and they use the present tense, as\nthis statute does, they're normally understood as\nrequiring those conditions to be met at the time of the\nadjudication.\nQUESTION: Yes, but the -- the trial work\nstatute itself says that any services rendered by an\nindividual during a period of trial work shall be deemed\nnot to have been rendered in determining whether his\ndisability has ceased.\nMR. LAMKEN: Right, in determining whether his\ndisability has ceased. That means that for a person to\nhave a -- to be entitled to a trial work period, he must\nhave what is called a disability, and whether or not an\nindividual has a disability is determined from the\nperspective of the adjudicator at the time of the\nadjudication.\nQUESTION: But I thought you took the position\nin -- I thought you did not take the position in your\nbrief that as a matter of law there had to be an\nadjudication. I thought you said that ordinarily that's\nthe way it -- it works in practice, but that the real\npoint you were making was that if the individual went back\nto work prior to the adjudication and therefore showed\nthat in fact the disability or the incapacity and hence\nthe -- the disability, as you see it, is not going to\nlast, that that's the end of the matter. That would cut\nit off. I didn't think you took as a theoretical matter a\nposition that there had to be an adjudication, merely that\nthere ordinarily would be one.\nMR. LAMKEN: I -- I think you've precisely\ndescribed our position, Justice Souter. The answer is\nthat if the individual produces evidence, such as by\nreturning to work successfully for the period of 2 years,\nfor example, in this case, and shows that he, in fact, was\nnot incapacitated, he was able to work, the adjudicator\ncan take that into account and decide that no, you're not\nentitled to disability benefits, and if you were never\nentitled to disability benefits, you also do not get a\ntrial work period.\nQUESTION: But -- but you would not allow him to\ncome in and say long before I came in for an adjudication,\nI was in fact disabled and entitled to benefits. You\nwouldn't allow him to say that.\nMR. LAMKEN: No. We would not allow him to come\nback and say -- and say, in effect, that I was thought to\nbe disabled for a period of 12 months reasonably but\nmistakenly because the statute requires that you can be\nexpected -- present tense.\nNow, that is consistent with the way courts --\nQUESTION: You're hanging an awful lot on that\n-- on that can be expected I -- I must say.\nMR. LAMKEN: Yes, Your Honor. But actually the\ncontrary view would make -- creates a rather difficult\ntype of adjudication --\nQUESTION: A difficult --\nMR. LAMKEN: -- to make and one that's entirely\nforeign to the law.\nQUESTION: You got to look back 6 months and\nfigure out whether 6 months ago he -- he could be expected\nto --\nMR. LAMKEN: Not merely that. You would have to\nlook back for the entire period covered by the application\nand decide if any moment during that period it could have\nbeen possible, reasonably but mistakenly thought, that his\ndisability would last 6 months. That type of\ndetermination is entirely foreign to the law.\nAnd it's also inconsistent with the purpose of\nthe can be expected to last prong. That exists precisely\nbecause, as Justice O'Connor pointed out, the Commissioner\nneeds to be able to adjudicate claims before 12 months\ngoes by. And therefore when the adjudicator -- when the\nCommissioner decides claims before 12 months have gone by,\nyou look at the can be expected to last prong.\nQUESTION: So, the real significance of the\npresent tense is that it kind of gives an opportunity for\nthe application of a kind of best evidence rule.\nMR. LAMKEN: Yes, yes, exactly. And that is\nconsistent with the -- the -- excuse me -- the statute,\nwhich says that when you're deciding these claims, you\nlook at all of the evidence in the file and you try and\ncome up with all of the available evidence. You don't\ndisregard evidence that is recently arriving merely\nbecause at some earlier time you would have made a\nmistake. And that is also -- I'm sorry.\nTurning back to the question of disability, the\nCommissioner's construction of the term disability in our\nview is supported by the text of the act. The act\nimposes --\nQUESTION: What kind of deference do we give\nhere? At the time this claim was evaluated, the\nregulations hadn't been adopted.\nMR. LAMKEN: That's correct, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: So, we're into Skidmore rather than\nChevron?\nMR. LAMKEN: No, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: No?\nMR. LAMKEN: We believe that the Commissioner is\nentitled to Chevron deference regardless of when the claim\nwas adjudicated. The purpose -- the reason this Court\ngives Chevron deference is when the -- the decision has\nthe formality and uses the procedures that Congress meant\nthe administrator to use when filling in gaps or when\nexplaining the meaning of the statute. It does not matter\nthat, in fact, that the administrator, or in this case the\nCommissioner, used those procedures after the claim was\nadjudicated because we know that after the thoroughness\nconsideration and using the notice and comment procedures,\nthe Commissioner came to the same conclusion, that in fact\nthe best reading of the statute is the one that the\nCommissioner has adhered to for 45 years and through\nrepeated amendments to the statute.\nQUESTION: The -- the court of appeals here said\nthat that simply wasn't consistent with the statute and it\nstruck me that they had a very good argument just looking\nat the statute that you are kind of -- reduced to some\nfairly odd statutory construction to justify your\nposition.\nMR. LAMKEN: No, Your Honor. Actually we\nbelieve that we have the far more reasonable understanding\nof the statute and certainly the one that's more\nconsistent with Congress' intent. The statute --\nQUESTION: Well, supposing we just say that we\nlook to the statute itself for what Congress' intent was?\nMR. LAMKEN: Focusing on the language of the\nstatute.\nQUESTION: Right.\nMR. LAMKEN: The statute imposes two\nrequirements. First, there must be an impairment.\nQUESTION: Where do we find the statute in -- in\nthe --\nMR. LAMKEN: It's 423(d)(2)(A) and (d)(1)(A)\nwhich appear on pages 69 -- just the heading of (d)(1)\nappears on 69a -- and 70a of the appendix to the petition\nfor a writ of certiorari.\nQUESTION: Thank you.\nMR. LAMKEN: Turning at page 70, it establishes\ntwo requirements that are interrelated. The first is that\nthere must be an impairment, which has lasted or can be\nexpected to last 12 months or result in death. Second,\nthe impairment must be one that precludes substantial\ngainful activity, that is, it must be so severe that the\nindividual cannot engage in any work in the national\neconomy. Given Congress' repeated intent not to provide\nbenefits for short-term disabilities, it is most natural\nto read those two requirements together so that the\nimpairment, which must last 12 months, is also an\nimpairment which must preclude substantial gainful\nactivity --\nQUESTION: Well, maybe. You know, once you\nposit that -- that Congress didn't want to provide\ncompensation for short-term disability. But if -- if you\nhad to determine what Congress' intent was purely from\nthat language, I just don't think you get there.\nDisability means an inability to gain -- to engage in any\nsubstantial -- substantial gainful activity. It doesn't\nsay how long that disability has to -- it could be, you\nknow, a week-long inability. And then it goes on, by\nreason of any mentally -- medically determinable physical\nor mental impairment which can be expected to result in\ndeath or which has lasted or can be expected to last for\n12 months. All it requires is that the impairment be a\nlong-term impairment and if that produces even a week-\nlong inability to work, you're -- you're technically\nwithin the language of that -- of that provision.\nMR. LAMKEN: Justice Scalia, that might be one\nway of reading the statute, but it's not --\nQUESTION: I think it's the only way to read the\nstatute. I don't see how else you can read it.\nMR. LAMKEN: We disagree, Your Honor. We\nbelieve that you read the two requirements together\nsensibly so that they overlap. And in fact --\nQUESTION: It is my understanding of your\nposition is you're saying that impairment, given the\ncontext of the statute, means a constantly, continuously\ndisabling impairment, and disabling means that you are not\nequipped to engage in substantial -- whatever SGA stands\n-- substantial gainful activity. So that the word\nimpairment means a disabling impairment.\nMR. LAMKEN: In effect, we're arguing, yes, that\nthe type of impairment that Congress was referring to is\nan impairment that prevents substantial gainful activity\nbecause that's the type of impairment that is referenced\nin the statute.\nQUESTION: And if it isn't -- if it doesn't\nprevent substantial gainful activity, then it isn't an\nimpairment within the meaning of the section.\nMR. LAMKEN: It is not the type of impairment\nthat you must have for 12 months. That's correct, Your\nHonor. That is a correct characterization of our -- our\nposition. I think if --\nQUESTION: So, if you look just at the word\nimpairment and what it means, you get back to the\ninability to do substantial gainful employment for that\ninterval of time.\nMR. LAMKEN: Your Honor, one way you could --\nyou could put your emphasis on the word impairment. The\nCommissioner has traditionally placed the emphasis on the\nword severe in 423(d)(2)(A) or inability to engage in\nsubstantial gainful activity in (d)(1)(A), but that would\nbe one way of achieving the same result that the\nCommissioner has. And that is actually supported by the\ntext of the definition of impairment which makes it clear\nthat --\nQUESTION: I don't know why you don't emphasize\nthe word which.\nMR. LAMKEN: Pardon?\nQUESTION: I don't know why you don't focus on\nthe word which. Does which refer to both inability and\nimpairment or just one of them?\nMR. LAMKEN: I think as a grammatical matter,\nJustice Stevens, we have to confess that the word which\nrefers to the impairment because one would not ordinarily\nexpect the substantial gainful activity to result in death\nor the inability -- better still, the inability to engage\nin substantial gainful activity to result in death. But\nfocusing back --\nQUESTION: One would not expect the inability to\nbe expected to last -- to result in death where it lasted\nfor a continuous period of 12 months? I don't know why.\nMR. LAMKEN: Well, Justice Stevens, we'd be\nperfectly willing to accept that if that were your view,\nbut for purposes of this case, we -- we have -- for\ngrammatical purposes, we believe that the phrase, which\ncan be expected to result in death, modifies the\nimpairment not the inability to engage in substantial\ngainful activity.\nQUESTION: So, you don't think it means both of\nwhich can be expected. It just means one of which can be\nexpected. You're willing to accept that anyway.\nQUESTION: Where is the definition of\nimpairment? I'm trying to find --\nMR. LAMKEN: It's on page 71a, Justice Scalia,\nafter the numeral 3 of the joint -- of the appendix to the\npetition for writ of certiorari. It says: for purposes\nof this subsection, a physical or mental impairment is an\nimpairment -- it's somewhat circular, we confess -- that\nresults from an anatomical, physiological, or\npsychological abnormality that is medically demonstrable.\nThat makes it clear that the impairment isn't\nnecessarily just the underlying medical condition, but it\nsays that it's the -- an impairment that results from the\nanatomical, physiological, or psychological abnormality.\nSo, in a sense the impairment can be viewed not merely as\nthe medical condition but the result of that condition\nsuch as in the case of a mental impairment, inability to\nfocus.\nQUESTION: I'm not sure that's necessarily a\nvery precise reading of that section. It says, impairment\nresults from anatomical, physiological, or psychological\nabnormalities. In other words, the results from is the\nabnormalities.\nMR. LAMKEN: The impairment is what results from\nthe abnormalities. The impairment is what the\nabnormalities produce.\nQUESTION: Right.\nMR. LAMKEN: So, if the condition is, in this\ncase schizophrenia, the impairment would be the inability\nto focus, the inability to think clearly, the impairment\nof the cognitive functions is another way of putting it.\nYour Honor, what -- I believe that the problem\nwith the court of appeals' approach of severing the two\nrequirements of an impairment -- the fact that the\nimpairment must last 12 months and that the impairment\nmust be one that is of disabling severity -- is that it\ndoes not -- it does not eliminate an ambiguity but creates\none. Even if we were to severe those two entirely and to\nsay that the only the -- that only the impairment must\nlast 12 months, it's clear that the impairment must be of\ndisabling severity for some period of time because it\nwould be absurd to suggest you're entitled to benefits for\na minute or a second or actually, Justice Scalia, with all\ndue respect, in my view for the week that you suggest.\nGiven that there is an implied duration of some\ntime for the severity, that it must be severe enough to\npreclude substantial gainful activity for some period of\ntime, it is up to the Commissioner to choose the period\nwhich makes the most sense, is most consistent with the\nstatutory structure and Congress' intent.\nThere are other indicia of -- of the structure\nof the statute that make it clear that Congress was not\ncontemplating short-term disabilities such as a week. For\nexample, the statute does not terminate benefits just at\nthe moment when you are able to return to work. Benefits,\ninstead, continue for an additional 2 months following\nthat. If the statute is, as the Commissioner supposes, a\nlong-term disability statute, that makes sense because\nthose 2 months of additional payments give you a time to\ntransition back to work, to get ready to work to find a\njob.\nIf in fact the statute is, as the court of\nappeals has construed it, a short-term disability statute\nwhere benefits are payable when you're out only for a\nweek, as Justice Scalia suggested, that would mean that an\nindividual who is out of work for a week, because of a\nchronic condition like asthma, anxiety, arthritis, and\nnumerous ones that last a year or more, would be entitled\nto 2 months of benefits plus the one week for which they\nare briefly out. It's hard to believe that that was the\ntype of statute that Congress had envisioned.\nIn addition, that -- that view is supported by\nthe repeated amendments to the statute that Congress\nrepeated amendments to the definition of disability\nagainst the backdrop of the Commissioner's now 45-year-\nold settled construction. Years after the Commissioner\nfirst adopted her construction of the statute in 1957, in\n1965 Congress amended the statute, and when Congress did\nso, it did not merely leave in place the Commissioner's\nby-then settled construction, instead Congress reiterated\nthat construction in the committee reports that were\naccompanying it -- accompanying the amendments and\ndescribed the act in precisely the same terms that the\nCommissioner had through the regulations.\nCongress, in fact, rejected a proposal\nactually a bill -- from the House of Representatives that\nwould have shortened the duration requirement instead of\nto 12 months to 6 months, and the stated reason for\nrejecting that 6-month period was a disability -- it would\nnot be sufficient to preclude the payment of benefits for\nshort-term disabilities. Instead, as the committee\nreports stated, it was necessary to require that the\nindividual be under a disability for a period of more\nof longer than 6 months. Instead, Congress meant to\nrequire that the individual be completely and totally\ndisabled throughout a continuous period of 12 months.\nUnder the court of appeals --\nQUESTION: Well, but actually not because you\ncan have these -- not the trial work, but the unsuccessful\nwork episodes. So, you're able to --\nMR. LAMKEN: That -- that is part of the\ndefinition of substantial gainful activity. It's -- I'm\nbeing somewhat imprecise when I say you're unable to work.\nWhat you have to be able to do is engage in substantial\ngainful activity, and if you return to work for a brief\nperiod of time, for less than 6 months generally under the\nCommissioner's regulations, and then your impairment comes\nback and prevents you continuing that, the Commissioner\nwill not treat that as evidence to obtain -- evidence of\nyour ability to engage in substantial gainful activity.\nIn fact, it's evidence of the opposite because you tried\nto go back heroically, but your impairment prevented you\nfrom successfully doing that. So, it's clear that you're\nnot able to engage in substantial gainful activity.\nQUESTION: So, the term substantial modifies --\nis directed to the length of the activity not the daily\nintensity of the activity.\nMR. LAMKEN: It -- it -- the substantiality does\nmodify the intensity of the activity, but in terms of\ndetermining what kind of evidence shows that you're able\nto engage in that activity, the Commissioner has\nlegislative authority to determine whether work -- whether\ncertain types of work attempts evidence your ability to\nengage in substantial gainful activity. And using that,\nthe Commissioner said there were just certain things that\nshould not count, such as unsuccessful work attempts, work\nattempts generally that are terminated within 6 months of\n-- within 6 months' of when they begin.\nQUESTION: Mr. Lamken, this case is unusual on\nthe facts because he came very close to making the 1-year\nlimit, and there is the anomaly that they -- the person is\napproved for receiving disability benefits in month 8 and\nthen will be able to go on for 2 months past the time the\ndisability ceases. And yet, this person, through no fault\nof his own -- it's kind of haphazard, by chance the one\nwho will make it and -- because it's based on a\nprediction, and the one who maybe -- maybe the Social\nSecurity office is backlogged. What is the reason for the\ndisparity in time of adjudication?\nMR. LAMKEN: In fact, Your Honor, there were two\nadjudications in this case in a very short period of time\nwithin the filing of benefits. The benefit claim was\nfiled in March and April and in the -- there was an\ninitial adjudication on May 18th, basically just over 30\ndays after the April application was filed. In that\nadjudication, a licensed psychiatrist determined that Mr.\nWalton was, in fact, able to engage in substantial gainful\nactivity and that his impairment was not severe enough.\nHe sought reconsiderations in June, and there -- a\ndecision was issued in August.\nThese are very short time frames, and they are\nnot atypical. Typically these types of claims are\nprocessed in less than 90 days for the initial\nadjudication.\nNow, regrettably there will be occasions, as in\nall areas of law, where the outcome is affected by the\ntiming of the decision. And that is true because\nsometimes evidence develops in the interim which would\nallow one person to prevail where, if the adjudication had\nhappened earlier, they would not have known about that\nevidence and the result would have been different.\nBut the fact that some individuals may get a\nwindfall and become entitled to benefits based on an\nerroneous prediction of expectation does not mean that the\nCommissioner is required to reach an erroneous result when\nadjudicating a claim where he has actual evidence that the\nindividual is able to engage in substantial gainful\nactivity, as occurred here.\nIn this case there is evidence that the\nindividual was able to engage successfully in working for\n2 solid years, and the Commissioner is not required to\nignore that probative, indeed dispositive evidence simply\nbecause the Commissioner might have made a mistake had the\nclaim been adjudicated earlier.\nQUESTION: Mr. Lamken, you said -- one of the\nthings you said is if the Fourth Circuit view prevailed,\nthere would be a large increase in the number of people\nwho qualified for disability benefits. This Fourth\nCircuit decision has been in effect now what? Over a\nyear?\nMR. LAMKEN: Yes, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Is there any report of any swell in\nthe approved applications in the Fourth Circuit?\nMR. LAMKEN: Your Honor, I have -- do not have\nany information regarding that.\nBut the -- one of the major concerns about this\nis it substantially increases the number of people who\nhave disabilities because no longer do you have to have an\nimpairment which precludes you from working for a\nsubstantial period of time, but merely an -- a medical\ncondition that last 12 months. When one considers the\nnumber of medical conditions that persist for 12 months\nthat are capable of disabling somebody for a short period\nof time, it clearly would have the effect of establishing\na short-term benefits program that Congress did not intend\nto create.\nIn fact, we are advised that approximately 38\npercent of all Americans have an impairment -- a medical\ncondition which is chronic in the sense that it will last\n12 months that is capable of preventing them from working\nfor short periods of time. And -- when construing the\ndefinition of disability, it is less plausible to believe\nthat Congress intended to pull in so many Americans and to\nmake all of their periods of absence of work on account of\nconditions like asthma, angina, arthritis, bad backs, and\nthe like which -- and turn them into disabilities.\nQUESTION: If we want to say -- and I take it\nyou want us to say -- that if the agency has followed a\nconsistent and well-settled interpretation policy over a\nlong course of time, it's entitled to special deference,\nis that just Chevron, or is there some other case that\ntells us this? What's the best case authority is what\nI'm --\nMR. LAMKEN: Your Honor, we believe this is a --\na classic case of Chevron deference.\nQUESTION: Is there another case other than\nChevron that -- that talks about the length of time that\nthe administration has --\nMR. LAMKEN: Oh, well, that would be classically\n-- if you're -- if what you're referring to is Mead or\nSkidmore deference, yes. But even --\nQUESTION: So, it's Skidmore or Chevron, and\nnothing --\nMR. LAMKEN: Well --\nQUESTION: -- nothing else.\nMR. LAMKEN: Those are the two standards of\ndeference with which I'm familiar, and in fact we believe\nthat we'd win under either one.\nQUESTION: Of course, you claim congressional\napproval too.\nMR. LAMKEN: Yes.\nQUESTION: I don't know whether that falls in,\ntechnically, a deference category, but it gets you to the\nsame point.\nMR. LAMKEN: Well, it -- it certainly adds\nweight to the agency's view and it may make it so that\nthere is only one reasonable construction of a statute\nthat's ambiguous.\nIf there are no further questions, I'd like to\nreserve the remainder of my time for rebuttal.\nQUESTION: Mr. -- Ms. Pryor.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF KATHRYN L. PRYOR\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMS. PRYOR: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please\nthe Court:\nThis case is governed by the plain language of\nthe statutes, the language of the disability definition,\nwhich is the primary focus of the first issue presented,\nand the language of the trial work period and entitlement\nstatutes, which are the primary focus of the second issue\npresented.\nThe plain language of the statutes and the early\nlegislative history demonstrate that from the inception of\nthe disability program, Congress has balanced its desire\nto restrict payment of benefits to only those with long-\nterm severe impairments with its intention to encourage\ndisabled persons to try to work. The Commissioner's\npolicy, in sharp contrast, ignores the work incentive\nprong of Congress' careful balancing act, focusing only on\nthe desire to restrict payment of benefits even to those\nwho suffer with clearly disabling impairments if they\nmanage to attempt to work with great courage and\ndetermination and, despite continuing severe impairment,\nwithin 12 months of the onset of their disability.\nQUESTION: Ms. Pryor, what -- what time limit do\nyou pick? I mean, suppose the person has a disability\nthat indeed is expected to last more than 12 months but it\nonly has caused him to black out and be incapable of\nworking for 1 minute.\nMS. PRYOR: Your Honor, I believe that --\nQUESTION: Does that 1-minute blackout entitle\nhim to come under the program?\nMS. PRYOR: No, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: All right. What about a week?\nMS. PRYOR: The entitlement statute I believe\nshows that a person must be under a disability during the\n5-month waiting period. So, they must have a condition\nwhich is severe enough to prevent substantial gainful\nactivity.\nQUESTION: Excuse me. I just didn't hear you.\nDuring the time of --\nMS. PRYOR: During the 5-month waiting period.\nQUESTION: During the 5-month.\nQUESTION: During the entire 5 months --\nMS. PRYOR: Yes, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: -- the disability must -- must\ncontinue.\nMS. PRYOR: Yes, Your Honor. And if -- and if\nit continues beyond that, then they would then be entitled\nto benefits.\nQUESTION: What establishes that? What\nestablishes the 5 months as -- as --\nMS. PRYOR: The entitlement statute, Your Honor,\nwhich is set out at 423(a) --\nQUESTION: What -- what's the section? 423(a).\nMS. PRYOR: 423(a), which is found at -- on page\n64a and 65a. And that entitlement statute says that\nyou're entitled for each month, beginning with the first\nmonth --\nQUESTION: Where are you reading from on 64a?\nMS. PRYOR: I'm sorry. I'm reading at page 65a\nafter it says that every individual who is insured and\nmeets these criteria shall be entitled to a disability\ninsurance benefit --\nQUESTION: What part of the page? What part of\nthe page 65a?\nMS. PRYOR: I'm sorry. The beginning, right\nafter D.\nQUESTION: Thank you.\nMS. PRYOR: Shall be entitled to a disability\ninsurance benefit for each month beginning with the first\nmonth after his waiting period. So -- and the -- and the\nwaiting period is defined on page 69a at 2 as the waiting\nperiod means the earliest period of 5 consecutive calendar\nmonths throughout which an individual has been under a\ndisability.\nSo, I believe that the entitlement statute does\nrequire that the person be under a disability, be -- have\nboth the impairment and an impairment at such level of\nseverity throughout those 5 months. Beyond the 5 months,\nthey are entitled to a benefit for each month beginning\nwith the first month they satisfy all criteria of\nentitlement.\nQUESTION: So, that would be the sixth month\nevery time. If that's --\nMS. PRYOR: Yes, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: And if you started in -- in month 6\n-- let's take this case. The man did engage in\nsubstantial gainful activity for 2 years. Is that right?\nMS. PRYOR: Yes, ma'am.\nQUESTION: So, it starts 6 months after he has\nbeen disabled and it continues until when?\nMS. PRYOR: Your Honor, because the trial work\nperiod statute dictates that a person is entitled to a\ntrial work period beginning in the first month he's\nentitled to benefits, he would be entitled to benefits\nbeginning in April 1995, which is when he met all criteria\nof entitlement, and he would be entitled to a trial work\nperiod beginning that month.\nQUESTION: That's 9 months.\nMS. PRYOR: And -- yes, Your Honor. It would\ncontinue for 9 months once he started working and would\ncontinue -- then he would get the -- once they determined\nat the end of the trial work period, if they've concluded\nthat his work was continuing and showed he was now able to\nengage in substantial gainful activity, he could be cut\noff after those 2 -- 2 additional months. He would be\nsubject to a 36-month re-entitlement period for benefits\nduring any of those months.\nQUESTION: But in this -- in this case, when he\n-- if he -- he starts at month 6, how many months actually\nwould he be getting disability benefits?\nMS. PRYOR: He returned to substantial -- well,\nhe returned to any work in May of 1995, and he would be\nentitled to a 9-month trial work period plus the\nadditional 3 months, and then for any months during that\n36-month entitlement -- re-entitlement period during which\nhe could not work.\nQUESTION: But just -- just -- if you could just\ngive me the -- the time frame. We know the starting --\nthe start is -- is it April?\nMS. PRYOR: Yes, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: And the end -- the minimum end would\nbe when?\nMS. PRYOR: It would be -- his actual work\nstarted end of May/June, then 9 months, plus additional 3\nmonths, so approximately 14 months I believe.\nQUESTION: So, some considerable time after he\nhas been restored to substantial gainful activity.\nMS. PRYOR: Yes, Your Honor. After he\nbecause that gainful activity is covered by a trial work\nperiod. There is no evidence in this case that Mr.\nWalton's condition ever medically improved. Therefore,\nhis -- his return to work is protected by the trial work\nperiod and that work itself cannot be considered as\nevidence that his disability --\nQUESTION: But once the period is over, making\nsubstantial gainful activity, even though, as you say, his\nimpairment continued, he would not be disabled.\nMS. PRYOR: That's correct. Once his trial work\nperiod had ended, he would -- he could be cut off subject\nto the re-entitlement period.\nQUESTION: So -- so the basic statutory problem\n-- I think -- I see where -- you're debating whether you\nbecome entitled after 5 months or 12 months, and that\nseems to turn on the language in 70a. And the Government\nis reading that -- basically there are many ways of doing\nit, but they're reading it to say a disability is an\ninability by reason to -- to engage in any substantial\ngainful activity by reason of an impairment, which can be\nexpected to result in death or has lasted, you know, for a\n-- which can be expected to result in death or which has\nlasted or can be expected to last. And at this point,\nthey read into it the words: at that level of severity.\nMS. PRYOR: Yes, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: And my problem is, to be absolutely\nfrank, I think you could read it at that level of severity\nor you don't have to read it at that level of severity.\nAnd the Government -- the Social Security Administration\nhas read it the Government's way for 40 years, and nobody\nhas done a thing about it. And indeed, Congress has\npassed some laws that seem to think that's right. And it\nwould be a major change to jump from 12 months to 5\nmonths. So, there we are.\nNow, what is your response to that?\nMS. PRYOR: Well, Your Honor, my response is\nthat that requires this Court to read language into the --\ninto the definition.\nQUESTION: We do that all the time.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: Language -- of course, you can't read\n-- you can't -- if a statute refers to a bear, you can't\ncall it a fish, but if a statute refers to an animal, you\ncertainly can read in that it doesn't mean fleas. I mean,\nthat's common. The statute -- it doesn't say which level\nof severity. It doesn't say it, and so you have to make\nsome assumption.\nMS. PRYOR: Your Honor, I believe that the --\nreading the plain language of the statute -- and the\nCommissioner has conceded this point that the phrase,\nwhich can be expected to result in death and which has\nlasted or can be expected to last for at least 12 months,\nrefers to the impairment, not to the inability to engage\nin substantial gainful activity. And I think that's the\nonly logical reading of that, which is what the Fourth\nCircuit found because otherwise you're saying that the\ninability to engage in substantial gainful activity can --\ncan result in death, and that really doesn't make any\nsense.\nTo read -- read it as the Commissioner would\nhave you do is -- it seems to me is contrary to the most\nfundamental rule of statutory construction, that Congress\nmust be assumed to mean what it says in the statute and\nthat when the language of the statute is clear and\nunambiguous, it should be enforced according to its terms.\nQUESTION: Ms. Pryor, I think you heard -- Ms.\nPryor?\nMS. PRYOR: I'm sorry.\nQUESTION: The -- I asked Mr. Lamken are you\nsaying, in effect, that the word impairment means a\ndisabling impairment. Because I think you would agree too\nthat if you had a condition that severely disabled you for\n1 week, excruciating back pain -- you couldn't do anything\n-- but that impairment continued at a less severe level\nwell beyond a year -- it didn't impede you from\nsubstantial gainful activity -- you would not be disabled.\nAnd yet, if you read the statute literally, you would be.\nMS. PRYOR: Your Honor, I believe the\nentitlement provisions answer that question. The\nimpairment is defined at page 71a as only being\nresulting from anatomical, physiological, or psychological\nabnormalities. It does not contain an element of\ninability to engage in substantial gainful activity. The\nseverity requirement, on the other hand, does, and that --\nbut that has no durational requirement.\nQUESTION: The case I gave you it says a\ncondition that can be disabling. It was severe for a\nshort period of time.\nMS. PRYOR: I believe that the entitlement\nstatute requires that it be disabling for at least 5\nmonths, the -- the waiting period. If it is disabling\nbeyond the 5 months, then the person should be entitled to\nbenefits for those months while it remains severe. At the\npoint that it no longer remains severe, as defined by the\nact, then that person could be cut off, or if they return\nto -- to work and their condition has not improved, they\nwould be entitled to a trial work period and to benefits\nduring that, at the end of which they could be cut off.\nBut I believe the entitlement statute answers\nthat question by saying you must -- you must have a -- an\nimpairment which is at the disabling level for those 5\nmonths. If it continues at the disabling level beyond the\n5 months, you're entitled to benefits for those months.\nQUESTION: So, for the 12 months, it doesn't\nmatter what the level of severity is, but for the 5\nmonths, you must be unable to engage in substantial\ngainful --\nMS. PRYOR: That's correct.\nQUESTION: That's --\nMS. PRYOR: Yes.\nQUESTION: What about -- what about (f)(3)\nwhat am I talking about? I'm talking about section\n423(f)(3) which says that a --\nQUESTION: What page?\nQUESTION: Where are you reading from?\nQUESTION: I'm reading from my own copy of --\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: Page 76a.\nQUESTION: It says that a person who has been\ngetting benefits may be determined not to be entitled to\nbenefits on the basis of a finding that the physical or\nmental impairment, on the basis of which such benefits are\nprovided, has ceased, does not exist, or is not disabling\nonly if such finding is supported by. And then you go\ndown to (3). Substantial evidence which demonstrates that\nas determined on the basis of new or improved diagnostic\ntechniques, the individual's impairment or combination of\nimpairments is not as disabling as it was considered to be\nat the time of the most recent prior decision the he or\nshe was under a disability, and that therefore the\nindividual is able to engage in substantial gainful\nactivity.\nThat seems to imply that the disability consists\nof a continuous inability to engage in substantial gainful\nactivity, not just a sporadic one.\nMS. PRYOR: I believe what this was referring to\nyou, Your Honor, is that the medical improvement must\nor in this case the new or improved diagnostic techniques,\nmust result in that person's then -- their condition no\nlonger being of such severity as to prevent substantial\ngainful activity.\nQUESTION: Yes, but all -- all it requires\nand that therefore the individual is able to engage in\nsubstantial gainful activity. That implies that so long\nas he can engage in some substantial gainful activity,\nit's -- it wouldn't matter if he were disabled\nsporadically for a day here or a day there. So, it\nimplies that it has to be a continuous inability to engage\nin substantial gainful activity.\nMS. PRYOR: Your Honor, I believe that this\nwhole section refers to termination of disability\nbenefits --\nQUESTION: I understand.\nMS. PRYOR: -- for somebody who's already --\nQUESTION: I understand. It refers to\ntermination. But -- but what would apply to termination\ngives you some indication of -- of what -- what the\ninitial condition is -- is expected to be.\nMS. PRYOR: Well, the impairment --\nQUESTION: Namely, a condition of continuous\ninability to -- to work.\nMS. PRYOR: There is a severity requirement\nwhich is part of the -- the definition, yes. And I -- I\nwould not disagree with that.\nQUESTION: But -- yes, but -- but you say that\nthat severity requirement has nothing to do with duration,\nand this termination provision suggests that it does have\nsomething to do with duration --\nMS. PRYOR: I don't --\nQUESTION: -- because if you can engage in any\nsubstantial gainful activity, you're terminated, assuming\nthat there's been the improvement in the condition.\nMS. PRYOR: Your Honor, once there is\nimprovement and -- and you are now able to engage in\nsubstantial gainful activity, I would agree that you could\nbe terminated. It's just that from the outset you do not\nhave to have an impairment that -- that is known to be at\nthat level of severity for 12 months. A person could have\nan impairment at that level of severity for 6 months, and\nin the sixth month, after the waiting period has expired,\nthey become entitled to benefits. And they -- they\ncontinue to be entitled to benefits as long as they have\nan impairment which is at that level of severity. Once\nit's improved, they could be terminated.\nQUESTION: I think you're right. I guess it\ndoesn't get you --\nQUESTION: What if 1 week after the 5 month\nperiod a person goes back to work? Would that mean they\njust got benefits for a week?\nMS. PRYOR: No, Your Honor. If they went back\nto work and unless their condition had medically improved\n-- if their condition had medically improved, then yes, I\nthink they could be terminated at that point. If their\ncondition had not medically --\nQUESTION: And the test of medical improvement\nwould be the ability to go back to work which they could\nnot do before.\nMS. PRYOR: Their ability to go back -- the fact\nthat they had gone back to work would then be protected by\na trial work period, and -- and would be -- that -- the\nfact that they were working would not be able to be\nconsidered as evidence that they were no longer disabled.\nHowever, if they had, in fact, medically improved, they\ncould be terminated during that trial work period.\nQUESTION: May I also ask you? I know you think\nit not legally significant, but do you disagree with the\nGovernment's position that they have consistently\ninterpreted the statute in this way for 40 years?\nMS. PRYOR: I would agree that they have\nconsistently interpreted the statute in this way.\nQUESTION: And -- and would you agree that they\ncorrectly describe the legislative deliberations in 1956 I\nthink it was? But you just say they're totally\nirrelevant.\nMS. PRYOR: Well, Your Honor, I would -- I have\nreferred to the legislative history in 1954, which is when\nthat definition of disability was first defined, and in\nthat instance, the 1954 Senate report delineated two\naspects of disability evaluation, a medically determinable\nimpairment of serious proportions which is expected to be\nof long continued and indefinite duration and a present\ninability to engage in substantial gainful activity by\nreason of that impairment.\nAnd they went on to say that they wanted to be\nassured -- assured that only long-lasting impairments were\ncovered and that that provision was not inconsistent with\nefforts towards rehabilitation because it, quote, refers\nonly to the duration of the impairment and does not\nrequire prediction of continued inability to work. End\nquote.\nThose -- that's the first time Congress defined\nwhat disability is. And it seems to me from the very\nbeginning, they make clear that they wanted to encourage\npeople to work, and -- and they did that by requiring that\nthe impairment be expected to last 12 months, but not\nrequiring that the inability to engage in substantial\ngainful activity lasts 12 months.\nI believe Congress' judgment is expressed\nunambiguously in the statutory language and is -- and\nthat's confirmed by the legislative history and that it\nmust not be disturbed simply because the Commissioner's\nlongstanding policy is at variance with -- with that\npurpose.\nI would acknowledge that legislative history can\nbe read both ways, but it seems to me that the\ncontemporaneous legislative history, when Congress first\nconsidered the definition of disability, should be given\nmore weight and more weight even than that is the express\nlanguage of the statute.\nQUESTION: One other thing I just wonder about\nin a case like this. Has this point been raised before by\nlitigants such as your client?\nMS. PRYOR: Yes, Your Honor. Well, the -- the\nissue of entitlement to a trial work period and\nentitlement to benefits has been decided by five courts of\nappeals.\nQUESTION: The trial work period, but -- but I\nmean the 12 months versus 5 months as the --\nMS. PRYOR: The 12 --\nQUESTION: Has anyone argued this before this\ncase?\nMS. PRYOR: Well, yes, Your Honor. The -- the\nMassachusetts case of White v. Finch considered this\nissue.\nThe Alexander case, I will acknowledge, the\nTenth Circuit case in 1971, went the other direction, and\n-- and they did find that -- that the 12 months applies to\nthe impairment at that level of severity.\nBut that -- the Tenth Circuit case of Walker v.\n-- the Walker case in the Tenth Circuit has essentially --\nit does not explicitly refer to Alexander, but it clearly\nfinds that a person is entitled to -- to benefits and to a\ntrial work period even though they do return to\nsubstantial gainful activity within -- after the 5-month\nwaiting period but within 12 months of onset. So --\nQUESTION: That refers to question 2. Right?\nMS. PRYOR: Yes, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: And on question 2, if I understand\nyou correctly, there is substantial agreement in the\ncourts of appeals that you're correct?\nMS. PRYOR: Yes, Your Honor. The five courts of\nappeals have -- or four others, other than -- and the\nWalton case have -- have gone consistent --\nQUESTION: But that's not the case with question\n1.\nMS. PRYOR: Question 1 has been ruled on\ndifferently by different courts.\nQUESTION: Well, question 2 hinges on question\n-- if you lose on question 1, you lose on question 2,\ndon't you?\nMS. PRYOR: No, Your Honor, I don't believe we\ndo. It's a tougher call. There's no question, but even\nif you find that the inability to engage in substantial\ngainful activity must last 12 months, the language of the\nentitlement statute and the -- the prospective standard\nrequired by the entitlement statute, together with the\nexpectancy language of the disability definition, I\nbelieve together require that benefits be paid and that a\ntrial work period be available in this case.\nQUESTION: Do you agree with the Government's\nestimate that -- that if -- if you win in this case, the\ndifference in -- in payouts under this program is going to\nbe something like $8 billion a year? Is it -- is it that\nexcessive?\nMS. PRYOR: No, Your Honor, I don't agree with\nthat. I believe those are completely unsubstantiated\nfigures and that, one, this isn't probably the proper\nforum for that. I believe that should properly be\naddressed to Congress. But secondly, I think that that --\nthose figures are based on a number of flawed assumptions.\nNumber one, Mr. Walton has never suggested that\nhe is entitled to indefinite payment of benefits while\nengaged in substantial gainful activity. Once his trial\nwork period ends, that work can then be considered and his\nbenefits would be cut off. In addition, someone whose\ncondition has medically improved, unlike Mr. Walton, could\nbe terminated from benefits prior to that, even before\neven during the trial work period.\nSecondly, the Government seems to assume that\nall those cases which have been denied on durational\ngrounds in the past would be approved under the Fourth\nCircuit's ruling. That is far from the case. A person\nmust still have an impairment which is expected to last 12\nmonths and that impairment must still meet the severity\nrequirement.\nThird, there have been acquiescence rulings in\neffect for several years, applying the McDonald case in\nthe Seventh Circuit since 1988, the Walker case in the\nTenth Circuit since 1992, the Newton case in the Eighth\nCircuit since 1998, and the Salamalekis case in the Sixth\nCircuit since late 2000.\nQUESTION: Can I ask you before -- can I just\nask you quickly if you're -- simply repeating these, which\nI -- is that on question 2, am I right in thinking we\ndon't reach question 2 if you lose on question 1?\nQUESTION: That's what I asked.\nMS. PRYOR: No, Your Honor, I don't believe that\nis the case.\nQUESTION: And that's what I didn't understand.\nThat's what I thought maybe you answered. But why would\nwe reach it because how -- if you're not entitled -- if\nyou lose question 1, the person never became entitled to\nSocial Security, and the statute says a period of trial\nwork shall begin with the month in which he becomes\nentitled to Social Security. So, what is exactly -- maybe\n-- I don't mean to have you repeat yourself if I just\nmissed it.\nMS. PRYOR: No, that's okay.\nQUESTION: But what's the response to that?\nMS. PRYOR: No, sir. I would -- I would -- you\nmust be entitled to benefits to be entitled to a trial\nwork period. However, I don't think that finding that the\n12-month duration requirement applies to the inability to\nengage in -- in substantial gainful activity means that we\nlose on entitlement. The entitlement --\nQUESTION: That's what -- but what I didn't\nunderstand is if you lose on question 1 and your client\ntherefore is not entitled to Social Security, isn't that\nthe end of the case? We don't have to reach question 2.\nMS. PRYOR: That's what I disagree on.\nQUESTION: Yes, because --\nMS. PRYOR: But the definition of disability\nisn't the final part of that because the person can -- if\nthe entitlement statute requires a prospective\nconsideration of the criteria of entitlement, every person\nwho's insured, has not attained retirement age, has filed\nan application, is under a disability shall be entitled to\ndisability insurance benefits for each month beginning\nwith the first month after his waiting period. At that\ntime if you look at the requirements of entitlement at the\ntime of his application in April 1995, he was entitled\nbeginning that month because he met all other\nrequirements --\nQUESTION: That -- that's --\nMS. PRYOR: -- and he had a disability even if\nyou look at disability as an expectation --\nQUESTION: Well, but if you lose on question 1,\nhe didn't have a disability.\nMS. PRYOR: If he -- even if there was at that\ntime an expectation that his inability to engage in\nsubstantial gainful activity must last 12 months.\nQUESTION: I'm going have to -- you're going to\nhave to write -- somebody is going to have to write this.\nSo -- so suppose the first conclusion is your client never\nbecame entitled to Social Security. Never. You have a\nlot of different reasons why he did, but suppose every one\nof them is rejected, which maybe they wouldn't be, but\nassume that. Then do we reach question 2?\nMS. PRYOR: If he's never entitled --\nQUESTION: Yes, never entitled.\nMS. PRYOR: -- then I agree he is not entitled\nto a trial work period.\nQUESTION: All right. So, we have to decide,\nfor whatever theories you may have, whether he is or is\nnot entitled.\nMS. PRYOR: My only difference with what you're\nsaying, Your Honor, is that he can be entitled even if you\nfind the duration applies to the inability to engage in\nsubstantial gainful activity.\nQUESTION: That that is because?\nMS. PRYOR: And that is because the entitlement\nstatute is a prospective standard from the point of\napplication, and the --\nQUESTION: Oh, yes, of course. It could turn\nout that your client, even though he hasn't been disabled\nat a level of severity for 12 months, nonetheless is a\nperson that when they decided it I guess, the person -- it\ncould have been after 8 months, and the decider could have\nsaid, oh, but it can be -- it will be expected to last at\nthis level of severity.\nQUESTION: Well, I guess you take the position\nthat it doesn't have to be decided, that the statute\nitself says --\nMS. PRYOR: Thank you.\nQUESTION: -- the person is entitled at the end\nof the 5 months.\nMS. PRYOR: Yes, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: That's your position.\nMS. PRYOR: That is my position.\nQUESTION: It doesn't require a decision maker.\nMS. PRYOR: Thank you.\nQUESTION: But if -- but if -- if we determine\nthat in fact the disability level must be as the\nGovernment claims, then in a case in which the\ndetermination is made before the 12-month period and at\nthat time the person is back working at a substantial\nlevel so that the determination is properly made that the\nperson never qualified, then there would be no reason, in\na case like that, ever to proceed to the second question.\nIsn't that correct?\nMS. PRYOR: Yes, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Okay.\nQUESTION: May I ask this one question? I just\nwant to be sure I haven't missed something in the\nargument. You agree, as I understand it, there is a\nseverity requirement in the impairment. And what is the\nseverity requirement?\nMS. PRYOR: Your Honor, that is set out in\n(d)(2) of 423, which is -- it's found at page 70a. And\nthat provides that an individual shall be determined to be\nunder a disability only if his physical or mental\nimpairment or impairments are of such severity that he's\nnot only able -- unable to do his past work but can't do\nother work.\nThe equivalent of that or even a higher standard\nof that is meeting a listing of impairments, which my\nclient did, and he -- he met the listing --\nQUESTION: If I understand you, you're saying\nthat the -- that the severity requirement is an inability\nto engage in substantial work.\nMS. PRYOR: Well, but -- yes. And considering\nyou can't do your past work or other work considering age,\neducation, and work experience.\nBut another part of that is meeting a listing,\nwhich is a higher level, and the listings are defined as\nthose impairments which are presumed to be -- prevent\nsomeone from being able to engage in any gainful activity,\nnot just substantial gainful activity. My client was\nfound twice by the administrative law judge as being --\nhaving a listing-level impairment. So, by definition, he\nmet the severity requirement and he met that at the time\nof both hearings, the second of which was more than 2 and\na half years after its onset date.\nQUESTION: It seems to me that I -- I really\nhave trouble understanding if there's a severity\nrequirement measured by inability to work for a period of\ntime, why that severity requirement wouldn't continue for\nthe entire period under the statutory definition of\nimpairment. That's what I'm having trouble understanding.\nMS. PRYOR: Well, first of all, Your Honor, the\nseverity requirement does not have a durational element to\nit. There's nothing in that --\nQUESTION: It doesn't say so, but the -- but the\ndisability has a durational requirement and it's not a\ndisability unless it's severe enough.\nMS. PRYOR: Well, the impairment has a\ndurational --\nQUESTION: Impairment I should say.\nMS. PRYOR: And -- and there is a separate\nseverity requirement, but I don't believe that the statute\nsays that -- that it must last at that level of severity\nfor 12 months. Once you no longer have a severe\nimpairment, I would agree that you can -- your benefits\ncan be terminated. But it does not require that -- that\nat the outset there must be an expectation that it will\npersist at that level of severity for the entire 12\nmonths.\nAnd I believe that the legislative history gives\nthe reason for that. Congress wanted to balance its\ndesire to restrict payment of benefits with its desire to\nencourage people to try to go back to work. The\nCommissioner's policy has the opposite effect. It tells\npeople stay home for 12 months or at least until your case\nis adjudicated, before you try to work. I believe that's\na clear disincentive for people like my client who are --\nwho are attempting to work despite the fact that their\nimpairment remains severe.\nQUESTION: Does the record tell us what's\nhappened to the respondent in the interim?\nMS. PRYOR: Your Honor, he -- this is not in the\nrecord, but he subsequently reapplied and is on disability\nbenefits based on the subsequent application.\nThere is no question in this case that Cleveland\nWalton would have been paid disability benefits long ago\nhad he merely stayed home until after his hearing and not\ntried to work. Instead, he has been penalized for his\ncourage and his motivation in trying to work despite his\ncontinuing listing-level impairment.\nThe Commissioner's policy violates the express\nlanguage of the statute. It is contrary to the\nlegislative history of the disability program and to\nlongstanding agency regulations. And it has been\nrepeatedly rejected by courts of appeals and district\ncourts throughout the Nation. The Commissioner's policy\nis also contrary to sound public policy concerns which are\nare reflected both in the legislative history and in the\ncase law.\nAccordingly, the Commissioner's unlawful and\nill-advised policy should be rejected so that other highly\nmotivated disabled persons like Cleveland Walton will not\nbe penalized in the future for their good faith efforts to\nwork.\nI'd be happy to address any other questions you\nmight have.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Ms. Pryor.\nMr. Lamken, you have 4 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY A. LAMKEN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. LAMKEN: I would like to begin by addressing\nthe 5-month trial work -- excuse me -- the 5-month waiting\nperiod. And it's important to emphasize that for a very\nlarge and important component of the Social Security\nprogram, the SSI program, the Supplemental Security Income\ndisability program, there is no 5-month waiting period.\nSo, for anyone who's applying for SSI disability income,\nthey -- that person, under respondent's and the court of\nappeals' interpretation, would be entitled to benefits for\na very brief period of inability to work so long as the\nunderlying medical condition, such as asthma or arthritis,\ncan be expected to last or has lasted 12 months. It is in\nview of the structure of the act, including the\ncontinuation of the payments for 2 months after the\ndisability ceases, hard to believe that that was what\nCongress had in mind.\nSecond, I should emphasize that the 5-month\nwaiting period isn't part of the definition of disability.\nWhat it is is it operates like a deductible. It provides\na period of time during which the individual bears the\nburden of their disability themselves and saves the\nGovernment the -- saves the Government money that would\nhave to be paid for that individual. But it does not\ndetermine what is a disability. It only determines what\nperiod of disability will be paid for and compensated by\nthe Government.\nI'd like to also turn to mention for a moment\nthe legislative history. The legislative history upon\nwhich respondent relies is for a separate program enacted\n2 years before the disability program at issue here. The\ndisability program issued in 1956. When Congress enacted\nit, it clearly understood that the inability to engage in\nsubstantial gainful activity, the disability itself, was\ngoing to have to last the requisite duration and not\nmerely the medical -- not merely the medical condition.\nAnd when Congress changed the duration from long,\ncontinued, and indefinite, which was the original term, to\n12 months, it specifically understood that the 12-month\nperiod applied to the impairment at a disabling level of\nseverity.\nAnd the -- the Senate report, which is quoted on\npage 36 of our brief, makes that lucid. It states that\nthe act, as amended, would provide for disability benefits\nfor an insured worker who has been or can be expected to\nbe totally disabled throughout a continuous period of 12\ncalendar months, and a 6-month period was rejected\nspecifically because it would provide benefits for short-\nterm disabilities.\nFinally, in terms of incentives, the incentive\nto return to work before there is an actual disability is\nproperly addressed by the Commissioner's unsuccessful work\nattempt regulations.\nIn addition, the court of appeals' construction\nis an overbroad response that actually deters returning to\nwork because it would provide benefits not merely to those\nlike Mr. Walton who have a long-term impairment that\nbriefly disables them and then heroically return to work,\nbut also those who have a long-term impairment that\nbriefly disables them and do not actually return to work.\nThe vast majority of applicants who seek benefits do not\nreturn to work, and those -- and those individuals would\nreceive benefits despite an ability to return to work and\ntheir failure to do so.\nIf there are no further questions.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr. Lamken.\n"
