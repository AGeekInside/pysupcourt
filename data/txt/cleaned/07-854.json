COATES\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. COATES: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThis case arises from a Ninth Circuit\nopinion that essentially creates an exception to\nabsolute prosecutorial immunity for chief advocates and\nsupervising advocates. The court's decision in the\nNinth Circuit essentially held that prosecutorial\npolicies that apply to an entire body of cases in a\ntrial office do not qualify for absolute immunity.\nWe submit that this is inconsistent with\nthis Court's decision in Imbler v. Pachtman and its\nprogeny, applying the functional approach to absolute\nimmunity. There is essentially no distinction between a\nchief advocate or supervising prosecutor implementing a\npolicy directing that cases be handled in a particular\nmanner and that particular chief advocate or supervising\nadvocate actually participating in the courtroom.\nBecause of the size of the prosecutorial\nagencies, it's not feasible that a chief advocate or\nsupervisor can be in a courtroom in every single case.\nBut they can put their prosecutorial stamp on each case\nthrough the implementation of policy, through training,\nor through other means.\nHere the policy at issue concerns compliance\nwith the obligation to disclose exculpatory information\nunder Brady v. Maryland and also Giglio v. United\nStates.\nIn Imbler versus Pachtman, the Court\nrecognized that those obligations are core prosecutorial\nobligations that are part of the prosecution's intimate\nrelationship to the fairness of the trial proceedings.\nAnd we submit that that duty, that function, is the same\nwhether it's performed in the courtroom or whether it's\nperformed by a chief advocate or supervising advocate in\nterms of formulating policy or when making particular\npolicy decisions.\nImbler recognized that these core decisions\nhad to be insulated. Otherwise, it would spawn\nlitigation that would burden the judicial process. And\nit might cause them to hesitate to produce particular\nexculpatory information. It might create a burden of\nhaving them involved in more lawsuits than actually\nperforming their function and prosecuting the criminal\nlaw.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Was -- was there an\nelement in Imbler of the fact that you have to\nmake tactical and strategic decisions at -- at the\nmoment that are difficult, that call for judgment that\nhas to be exercised on the spur of the moment?\nThis is somewhat different. This is -- this\nis a long-term commitment or a long-term policy that the\nRespondents are arguing for. It seems to me somewhat\ndifferent than the dynamics that inform the Imbler\ndecision.\nMR. COATES: Well, the court in Imbler did\nmention a time frame in which decisions have to be made\n-- quickly made by individual prosecutors. It also\nnoted the sheer number of decisions that are often made\nin the context of a criminal prosecution.\nI would say, with respect to chief advocates\nand -- and supervisors, the number of those types of\ndecisions is the same. They have the same complexity in\ndetermining what is going to come up in every single\ncase as an individual prosecutor does in a -- in a\nsingle case.\nMoreover, there is a multitude more that\nthey have to consider because they are considering the\npossibility of its impact on thousands of cases within\nthe office. I will note, though, in Butz v. Economou,\nwhere the Court extended absolute immunity to\nindividuals prosecuting agency actions, that same point\nwas raised. But some of the conduct there was a bit\nmore drawn-out in terms of the investigative manner --\nnot the investigative manner, but the -- the\nprosecutorial process used by the administrative agency.\nAnd the court didn't find that -- that longer time frame\nto be dispositive.\nGoing back to Imbler, it again looked at\nwhat the basic function was in the administrative agency\nproceeding and found, yes, it is akin to prosecutorial\nconduct.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask you kind of\nperhaps a farfetched hypothetical question just so I get\nthe case law in mind? Supposing a prosecutor wanted to\ndevelop a policy which would keep -- which would create\na bifurcated regime within the office where the people\nwho interrogate prisoners are entirely separate from the\npeople who prosecute trials, so that they don't have the\nmalicious purpose that your adversary says is involved\nin this case. And supposing the prosecutor then hired\nsome expert layman who had no trial experience at all to\ndevelop such a program, and the program, itself, is\ndesirable from the prosecution's point of view but --\nbut presumably unconstitutional. Would the person who\ndeveloped that program be entitled to immunity --\nMR. COATES: The --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- in my example?\nMR. COATES: The lay person --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yes.\nMR. COATES: The layperson, as a private\nactor, I think would not be. I think the prosecutor\nthat developed the policy would be. It would be like\ndelegating it to a staff member. It might depend also\non how close the relationship is. The Court has noted\nin some of the judicial immunity cases that sometimes\ncourt clerks can perform functions that are essentially\njudicial functions.\nIn that case, though, under the Court's\njurisprudence with private actors, they might have only\nqualified immunity, the private actors. But the\ndecision to use them would be prosecutorial.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, why -- why is it\nqualified immunity if a separate person does it, but not\nqualified immunity if precisely the same task is\nperformed by somebody who happens also to be a\nprosecutor?\nMR. COATES: Because it's not so much the\nphysical task of doing it. It's carrying out the\nobligation of performing that particular function. The\nfunction is compliance with Giglio and Brady. That is\nalways a prosecutorial function. Whether the data is\nkept with a police department or an investigative\nagency, the buck stops with the prosecutor.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And in my hypothetical is\nit or is it not a prosecutorial -- does the layperson\nperform or not perform a prosecutorial function?\nMR. COATES: If he is just collating data,\nthen that is -- that's -- that's a task. Our point is\nthat this isn't about just collating data. It's about\nthe policy that data must be collated and used. That is\nthe Brady-Giglio obligation. You can't divorce the --\nthe information from the purpose for which, why it's\nsupposed to be used.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: No, but I'm trying to\ndivorce the information in the particular case from\ndeveloping the program.\nMR. COATES: Well, I --perhaps I\nmisunderstood the question. It sounds to me that the\nprosecutor has made a decision that he is going to put\nthis thing in place, this process in place. That's\ntheir way that they satisfy or don't satisfy Giglio or\nBrady.\nMaybe they don't satisfy. Maybe it's a\nterrible decision. But I think that decision ends up\nbeing prosecutorial in nature.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Even if it's made by a\nlayman?\nMR. COATES: Setting up the program, no.\nBut the -- I think the buck stops with the prosecutor as\nto whether that's a valid process or not. I mean, the\nperson may adequately perform their function, or they\nmay not. But the person at the end of the day who is\nresponsible for it ends up being the prosecutor.\nAnd he may inevitably -- the person may\ninevitably perform something, but at the end of the day\nthe prosecutor is the one that -- that has the task\nunder Giglio and Brady of ensuring the accuracy of the\ninformation.\nI think that kind of underscores here the\napproach the Respondent has taken is to kind of say,\nwell, this is just a collection of data here, this is\njust bookkeeping. But it's not. The core of the\nconstitutional claim here is that there is an obligation\nunder Brady and Giglio somehow to collect this\ninformation, to disseminate this information.\nAnd that's the obligation that we are being\nsued for, and that's the sort of thing that prosecutors\ndo. And you can you hire someone to do it, but somebody\nis the gatekeeper. Someone has to basically decide what\ngoes in or what doesn't go in and whether it's\nsufficient or insufficient at the end of the day to\ncomply with -- with Brady and Giglio. And so that can't\nbe distinguished from the -- the prosecutorial role,\nwhether it's conducted by a -- a chief advocate or by a\nsupervising advocate.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I -- I suppose that\nis why the Petitioners seemed to change their theory.\nThey -- they -- they were -- they were concerned about\nprosecutorial immunity, so they take it to the higher\nlevel of policy.\nWhen -- when they do that, I suppose they\nmight have the stronger argument if they could show\ndeliberate indifference. Are there cases that help them\non the \"deliberate indifference\"? What's -- what's the\nbest case for them on deliberate indifference?\nMR. COATES: I couldn't say what the best\ncase is for them. I could not say what the best case is\nfor them on -- on \"deliberate indifference.\" We have\nnot pushed on the merits part of this case. It was not\nbriefed down below, and it is not --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: That is why the case is\nhard, and I -- I almost have to see what the violation\nwould be before I could determine the qualified immunity\naspect of the case.\nMR. COATES: Well, indeed. I mean, several\namici has raise the question of whether there is the\nconstitutional violation at all, but it has not been\nraised below. And of course, under this Court's\ndecision in Buckley we have to assume the existence of a\nconstitutional violation.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: That's what we are\ndeciding in sort of in a vacuum. It's a little\ndifficult.\nMR. COATES: Precisely. But I think our\npoint is that -- that if you buy their theory of a\nconstitutional claim, whatever constitutional claim that\nis is a -- a prosecutorial function-related claim,\nbecause that's the nature of the Giglio and Brady\nobligation. They are trial obligations. They don't\nhave any meaning outside the context of an actual\nprosecution.\nAnd so, again we submit that there is really\nno difference to the chief advocate or supervising\nadvocate formulating this particular policy for all the\ncases in the office -- this is what we do -- then there\nis the individual actions of a particular trial attorney\nin a given case or even if it were possible for a\nsupervising attorney or chief advocate to participate in\neverything. They could accomplish the same thing, I\nsuppose, by every time a case is filed sending out an\ne-mail saying: Comply with our policies.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: The Monell case -- does\nthe Monell case rest on the assumption that there can be\ninstances where a policy makes the policy of those who\nadopted the policy liable?\nMR. COATES: I think that's right. Reading\nthe Monell allegations of the complaint against the\nCounty of Los Angeles, I think that that is what it is,\nthat the deputy -- that the district attorney rather,\nacts as a county officer and would be the policymaker\nfor those policies and customs and practices.\nThat obviously is not at issue here.\nPetitioners are being sued as individuals for their acts\nas supervisors and as the chief advocate in formulating\na particular policy concerning compliance with Brady and\nGiglio.\nThese sort of cases, opening this door\nparticularly for the broad claim that plaintiffs are now\ntrying to assert, which is this kind of notion of\ninformation management, can spawn all sorts of claims.\nVirtually any time that you can't reach the individual\ntrial attorney, all you need do is attribute whatever\nyou think that person did to the failure to develop a\npolicy or provide training or to have adequate data\nmanagement to allow them to do the job.\nThis kind of end-run under Imbler will\ncreate the multitude of litigation and drag chief\nadvocates in, as well as supervising advocates, that\nImbler was designed to avoid. And it has the worse\ncollateral effect that it's also going to end up pulling\nin the individual attorneys, the individual trial\nattorneys in a given case, because maybe they don't have\nindividual liability, but they are certainly going to\ncome in; they are going to testify as witnesses.\nSo, it's the worst of both worlds, which is\nyou are burdening the chief advocate with this sort of\nlitigation which may impact the way they formulate\npolicy, and you are burdening the individual line deputy\nattorney, and that's the attorney that Imbler sought to\nprotect as well.\nThose adverse consequences on the judicial\nprocess are what led this Court in Imbler to recognize\nthe importance of absolute immunity for prosecutors. We\nsubmit that it's even more important that that immunity\nbe logically applied to chief advocates and to\nsupervisors. Otherwise, I think Imbler will be\neviscerated and we will have the very evils that Imbler\nwas designed to avoid.\nIf the Court has no further questions, I\nwill reserve the remainder of my time for rebuttal.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.\nCoates.\nOh, excuse me. Sorry about that.\nMr. Dreeben.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,\nAS AMICUS CURIAE,\nSUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS\nMR. DREEBEN: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nThis Court recognized absolute prosecutorial\nimmunity for line prosecutors who are charged with\nviolating an obligation that falls uniquely on\nprosecutors, namely the obligation to disclose\nexculpatory evidence. The Respondents in this case are\nseeking to circumvent that absolute prosecutorial\nimmunity by reformulating the claim as one against\nsupervisors who allegedly failed to fulfill duties under\nthe Constitution to collect information that would\nenable the line prosecutors to comply with the core duty\nunder Giglio and Brady.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is there such a\nconstitutional obligation?\nMR. DREEBEN: Not in our view,\nMr. Chief Justice. In our view the Brady obligation is\none that falls on the Government. Giglio is an\nextension of Brady with respect to impeachment\ninformation. It's designed to ensure the fairness of\nthe trial. It is violated only when the Government has\nsuppressed material exculpatory evidence, that is,\nevidence that can undermine the fairness of the trial.\nIt's intimately linked in a way that really\nnothing else in the adversary system is to preserving\nthe fairness of the trial. It's an obligation on the\nprosecutor to go beyond the normal role of an advocate\nto zealously advocate for his cause, and it puts the\nadvocate in the position of supplying the judicial\nsystem with information needed to be submitted in order\nto have a fair proceeding.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I think you have the\nflip side of the same problem your friend has. In other\nwords, the further it is removed from the constitutional\nviolation or an allegation of a constitutional\nviolation, the less need there is for immunity. The\ncloser it is or the closer we must assume it is to a\nconstitutional violation, then the immunity argument is\nstronger.\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, it certainly is true\nthat if there were a constitutional obligation under\nGiglio and Brady, it would be one that is intimately\ntied to the judicial process, and it should receive\nabsolute prosecutorial immunity.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: In the broad ethical\nscheme of things, apart from liability under this\nstatute, it seems to me that a newly elected district\nattorney would take seriously the obligation to make\nsure that everybody was following Brady.\nMR. DREEBEN: Absolutely, Justice Kennedy,\nand I think that a formulation of policies to achieve\nthat, whether or not required by the Constitution, is\nsomething that relates directly and intimately to the\nprosecutor's duties to assure --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, that's the next\npoint. If I were a prosecutor, I would say: This is my\nconstitutional duty to say it, in the broad sense of --\nof my ethical obligations of my duties to the public.\nMR. DREEBEN: Only in the sense, I think,\nthat -- that a supervisor who has the power to cause or\nprevent constitutional violations may be under some\nobligation not to cause constitutional violations. But\nthe claim here is --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I think it's more\nthan that. He can't be indifferent to sloppy practices\nin the office --\nMR. DREEBEN: You certainly should not.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- consistent with his or\nher obligations to perform their duties.\nMR. DREEBEN: But I think that the\ndeliberated indifference question that you raise,\nJustice Kennedy, is really a direct counterpart of the\nabsolute immunity argument that we are making here. We\nare making here the argument that supervisory\nprosecutors should not be subject to suit based on broad\npolicies that they have adopted that will directly have\nimpact on individual cases in the way that Brady and\nGiglio obligations are fulfilled.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Dreeben, what do you\ndo with my hypothetical? Do you remember it?\nMR. DREEBEN: I remember it,\nJustice Stevens, and I think that the -- I agree with\nMr. Coates on this one. The supervisory prosecutor who\nformulates the policy is the only one who has the unique\n--\nJUSTICE STEVENS: No, I'm -- my hypothetical\nis they hire a layman --\nMR. DREEBEN: Yes.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- to develop a policy\nthat will keep separate from prosecutors information\nabout the way witnesses are developed. And the policy I\nthink is highly unprobable, I agree with you, but the\npolicy is designed to avoid the obligation imposed by\nGiglio and Brady.\nMR. DREEBEN: That's the allegation, of\ncourse. And the first thing that I want to say is that\nif you allow suits based on allegations that you think\nare really bad, you open the door to allegations that\nwill have to be sorted out throughout the judicial\nsystem.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But that's true even\nwithout -- without an immunity.\nMR. DREEBEN: But I think that the point is\nthat the immunity prevents the prosecutors from having\nto fear that they will be subject to those kind of\nsuits.\nBut to answer your question directly, the\nlayperson, if he causes a constitutional violation,\nisn't shielded by the constitutional -- excuse me -- by\nthe prosecutorial immunity that attaches only to\nprosecutors. And that's because if you go back to the\nroots in Imbler, what you see is that prosecutorial\nimmunity is really --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Of course, the next\nquestion is, if that's true, and if there is -- you can\ncompartmentalize the prosecutor's work in the office and\nhe develops a separate chapter of his own duty to just\ndo that performance, why is that trial-related?\nMR. DREEBEN: I think the flaw in\nRespondent's theory is the attempt to bifurcate what the\nprosecutor is doing into an administrative function and\na prosecutorial function. And that's the same, I think,\nmaneuver in your hypothetical, to say that the\nprosecutor is really doing something administrative and\nImbler said administrative things are non-prosecutorial;\ntherefore, we can sue him.\nI think the problem with that is illustrated\nby a hypothetical about judicial immunity. Suppose --\njudges of course have immunity from sitting on cases,\nand if a judge sat on a case that involved a conflict of\ninterest he could not be sued or she could not be sued\nfor having done so, even if it violated the\nConstitution. Suppose that the litigant reformulated\nthe suit and said: Well, the judge should have had a\npolicy to ensure a check of conflicts in all the cases\nthat the judge sat on. And that would have been an\nadministrative duty, set up some notebook that has all\nthe judge's investments and direct some underling to\nensure that no party in any case has an interest where\nthe judge has an investment. That was purely\nadministrative, so we ought to be able to sue. The\njudge for that. And I think that obviously should fail.\nIt would end-run all of the policy reasons for being\nable to assert absolute judicial immunity; and I think\nthat that is identical in form to what the Respondents\nare trying to do here. They are trying to divorce the\nrole of the office in maintaining some sort of a system\nto ensure that information is available to prosecutors\nto disclose under Giglio from the obligation under\nGiglio to ensure the fairness of the judicial process,\nwhich is an obligation that falls uniquely on the\nprosecutor and which Imbler makes clear is subject to\nabsolute immunity.\nAnd you just can't do that. If you do that,\nyou end up exposing the supervisory prosecutors to evils\nthat cannot occur to the line prosecutor himself. And\nit produces anomalies. The line prosecutor, even if he\nintentionally violates Giglio, cannot be sued, but under\nRespondent's theory the supervisory prosecutor, even if\nwhat he did is no more than deliberately indifferent or\nperhaps even negligent, could be sued.\nThe line prosecutor who handles a certain\nnumber of cases cannot be sued, in part because it would\nensure a distraction of the duties of the prosecutor and\nwould divert him from performing his role of enforcing\nthe criminal law. The supervisor, who is responsible\nfor far more cases and is subject to far more\ndisappointed litigants who would like to sue him, that\nperson can be sued. And it would have an even more\ndisruptive effect on an office if supervisory\nprosecutors, who have the responsibility, as\nJustice Kennedy pointed out, of trying to come up with\npolicies that will prevent constitutional violations,\nand that will ensure that the office functions in an\nefficient and an effective manner, they will be the ones\nwho are most deterred -- most deterred from acting,\nbecause they will suffer the possibility of thinking of\ntheir own individual liability rather than focusing on\nwhat they are supposed to do, the public interest, both\ndisclosing information that needs to be disclosed,\nbringing suits that need to be brought, and using\nwitnesses regardless of fears that someone later on is\ngoing to discover information that should have been\ndisclosed and sue the supervisor, saying, \"We know we\ncan't sue the individual prosecutor, but you,\nsupervisor, failed to develop effective policies to get\nthat information to the court.\" That kind of\ncircumvention of Imbler plays no role of fulfilling the\npolicies that absolute prosecutorial immunity is\ndesigned to fulfill.\nIf the Court has no further questions --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.\nDreeben.\nMr. Rosenkranz.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF E. JOSHUA ROSENKRANZ\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Mr. Chief Justice, and may\nit please the Court:\nThis case is not about whether a chief D.A.\ncan set policies about trial strategy. We could\nstipulate that this chief D.A. would be immune from\nthose sorts of suits and it would not affect our case at\nall.\nThis case is about the function of deciding\non an officewide basis whether to track important\nhistorical facts and disseminate them internally within\nan office to employees who need to know those facts.\nThis case is about gathering and preserving information,\ncertain categories of raw data, that may or may not ever\nget into the courtroom, not about how to use those\nspecific pieces of data once you actually have a\nprosecution materializing.\nThis claim is no different from a claim\nagainst a chief of police, for example, for\nsystematically destroying 911 tapes, thereby depriving\ndefendants of exculpatory information.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why isn't --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: This is creating -- this\nis creating a database. And what was the year of this\nprosecution?\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: The prosecution, Your\nHonor, was in 1979, it began. That was the crime; the\nprosecution was in '80.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And back in 1979 we did\nnot have the information-gathering electronic capability\nthat we now have. So what are we talking about? What\nkind of database? How would it operate? Would you --\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Well, Your Honor, so that's\ngetting to the merits of the actual claim. It could be\nas simple as a file cabinet or 3 by 5 cards on which you\nlist the name of the informant and his prior record of\ncollaboration.\nIn the U.S. Attorney's offices that do this,\ncompletely apart from this enormous FBI database, they\ndo it very simply, the ones that I know about. They\nappoint a Giglio czar in each bureau and they say that\nwhen there is contact with the prosecutor's office and\nan informant, you make sure you tell this person, \"send\nan e-mail,\" and he keeps it all in a file.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but that goes\nto the merits, doesn't it? I mean, if -- I -- you could\ndevelop and make the same point, saying U.S. attorneys\nare instructed in complying with Giglio and Brady in\nthis way. But if there is a decision not to -- I mean,\nimmunity is only necessary when you assume some -- there\nhas been some violation. And so the fact that somebody\nelse avoids a violation, it seems to me, is not a good\nargument to deprive other people of immunity.\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Well, Your Honor, this\nCourt has said as clearly as it can possibly say that\nthe location of the injury is irrelevant. I am quoting\nnow from Buckley. In Kalina, the prosecutor executed\nthe challenged certification probably the morning before\nthe morning she walked into court, and it was held to be\nnot immune because that was not the function of a\nprosecutor. She - with the charging document.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You drew a\ndistinction earlier on between a determination by a\nprosecutor not to turn over certain material, which is\nabsolutely immune, and said this was different. But\nwhat if the purpose of the policy is to not provide\nprosecutors with material so they can't turn it over?\nWhy doesn't that go into the same prosecutorial core\nfunction?\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Well, Your Honor, the\nanswer is quite simple. That is the alleged motive in\nthis case, in fact. It was intentional or with\ndeliberate indifference, so the allegation is, the\nintention was to cut the flow of information to the line\nprosecutor. And the reason that's different is because\nwhile Petitioners say compliance with Brady, our answer\nis compliance with Brady comprises at least two\nfunctions.\nThere is the front line function of the\nprosecutor, the advocate, making the decision, \"Do I\nturn this information over to the defense?\" This case\nhas nothing to do with that front line function. This\ncase has to do with the back room function. The\nfunction of --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why isn't that the\nsame as the determination by the supervisor that, don't\nturn this information over. Here's all -- we are not\ngoing to share informant information because we don't\nthink that should be turned over to comply with Giglio.\nThe individual prosecutor they have says I'm not going\nto turn it over. Why isn't it exactly the same?\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Well, Your Honor, if the\ndecree comes from on high, \"we don't turn over Giglio\ninformation here,\" which has actually happened in some\ncases, that would be a different case, because that is\nthe chief administrator directing trial tactics.\nHere it's the chief administrator looking\nentirely inward and saying, like any administrator in\nany major agency or business does, how do we get\ninformation from the people who know it to the people\nwho need it at the front line?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That is certainly -- you\nknow, that's an interesting theory, but it's certainly\nnot the theory on which the decision below was based.\nThe decision below says \"Neither\" -- speaking of Imbler\nand prior cases -- \"Neither the Supreme Court nor this\nCourt has considered whether claims regarding failure to\ntrain, failure to supervise or failure to develop an\nofficewide policy regarding a Constitutional obligation\nlike the one set forth in Giglio are subject to absolute\nimmunity.\"\nAnd I could quote portions of the opinion\nthey are.\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: That's what --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: They are talking about\nsupervising prosecutors. They are talking about\ntraining prosecutors and having an officewide policy\nregarding what you do with -- with Giglio information.\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, the passage you\nread from was the broad passage that the court was\nreferring to when it said this sets up a bunch of hard\nquestions. This case becomes an easy case, the court\nsaid, because we were not dealing with the prosecutor,\nthe chief D.A. setting trial tactics for the line\nprosecutors; we are dealing -- the court says this on\npage 5 of the petition -- excuse me, the petition\nappendix.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Page 5?\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Page 5 of the petition\nappendix at the top. It lays out the theories. Number\none theory is exactly the theory we are presenting here.\nAt the very top line, \"They violated his constitutional\nrights by purposely or with deliberate indifference\nfailing to create a system that would satisfy the Giglio\nobligation.\"\nJUSTICE SCALIA: They are not talking about\njust collecting information.\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: They are talking about, as\nthey clarify later on, a -- a system in which they train\nand supervise and develop an officewide policy regarding\nthe Giglio obligations.\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, no, they -- the\ncourt was very clear that it was talking about\nsupervising and training, about the internal function of\ncirculation of information within the D.A.'s office.\nNot --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Let's assume that's --\nthat's what they did mean. I have to say I read it as\nbroadly as Justice Scalia did, but let's -- let's narrow\ndown the -- the Court's opinion to -- to -- to the claim\nthat you are making right now.\nLet me go back to the Chief Justice's\nhypothetical and add one minor detail.\nLet's assume that in a given department they\nput into effect exactly the policy that you want. They\nhave a fine system of -- of data collection, far more\nsophisticated than three by five cards, and the -- the\nboss D.A. says everybody in this office ought to know\nwhat kind of deals are being made and offered at all\ntimes. And they have such a system.\nAnd the boss D.A. also says and don't you\ndisclose one word of it ever in any case. We are going\nto defy Giglio.\nIf he made that or gave that order so that\nin every case there would be a defiance of Giglio, even\nthough the facts were known, would he have absolute\nimmunity?\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: And he's directing that\norder to trial lawyers?\nJUSTICE SOUTER: That's right.\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Yes, Your Honor. The\nanswer is I don't know. I could imagine a theory, a\nvery strong one --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, you know if in a\ngiven case, if they had this system, and the lawyer\ncomes to him and says, okay, I've consulted our system\nand I realize we that have got a Giglio obligation. And\nthe boss D.A. says: Forget it. Don't tell him a word.\nThere would be absolute immunity, wouldn't\nthere?\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: There absolutely would,\nYour Honor.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: And my point is --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Why would the -- why would\nthe answer be any different if he says don't bother me\nwith particular cases? I am telling you right now what\nthe answer is going to be in every case in which we have\na Giglio obligation and that is, bury it.\nPresumably there would be absolute immunity,\nwouldn't there?\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, I can imagine\nan argument on either side. I can imagine the Plaintiff\nmaking the argument --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: What's your answer?\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: I don't have an answer to\nthat hypothetical because it's so different from our\ncase.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: The trouble is if you don't\nhave an answer to that hypothetical, then we got to\nleave open the possibilities as far as your case is\nconcerned that he would have absolute immunity in that\ncase. And if he would have absolute immunity in that\ncase, then the -- the -- the reason for allowing\nanything less than absolute immunity with respect to\nthis data collection obligation reduces down to\nsomething like an almost a silly point.\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: If --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: If you can get everything\nyou want, and all the prosecutor has got to say is:\nKeep it under your hat and there is going to be absolute\nimmunity and nobody gets anything. What is -- what is\nto be gained by that?\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Well, Your Honor, that may\nwell be a consequence of Imbler. But when Imbler talks\nabout the function, Imbler is very clear that there is a\ndistinction between trial tactics and strategy on the\none hand in the cases under Imbler, and the sort of\nbackroom functions about the flow of information on the\nother --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But if the backroom\nfunction is reduced to an absolute nullity by an\nimmunized decision to -- to bury the Giglio information\nin every case, then I don't see the point of saying\nthere's no immunity for the supposed backroom function,\nbecause nothing will be accomplished even if there is no\nabsolute immunity.\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Sure, Your Honor. We\ncan -- if we imagine a corrupt district attorney who\nwants to make sure that constitutional rights are\nviolated and evades the edict of this Court, sure, that\nis the consequence of Imbler.\nBut my point in -- in not answering the\nquestion about the theory under that case, is that the\nargument of the plaintiff in that case is so different\nfrom the argument that we are making here. The\nplaintiff in that case would be arguing, well, it is\nremoved in time from the -- the actual prosecution which\nis an argument that we, too, can make. The conduct was\nbefore the initiation of criminal proceedings. It's\nnot -- you know, you could not say it's not unique to\nprosecutors.\nHere, our argument is that there is nothing\nunique to prosecutors or to lawyers about the\ninformation management function, about the function of\ntracking information. And by the way, this is not an\nexotic theory. This is exactly the line that this Court\nhas been following in distinguishing between --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Can't you say anything about\ntraining subordinates in any office. There is nothing\nunique about training or not training subordinates in a\nprosecutor's office as opposed to any other government\noffice or, I would suppose, an office in the private\nsector. So does your argument extend to any failure to\nprovided adequate training or any instance where there\nis a deliberate indifference as to the training that is\nprovided?\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: I can see the plaintiff in\na case using our argument to advance that point. But my\npoint here is we don't even need to get to that argument\nbecause --\nJUSTICE ALITO: So a plaintiff could say\nthat it could sue a -- a district attorney for failing\nto have adequate training as to subordinates before\nyou -- they are sent in to deliver a summation so that\nthey know they are not supposed to comment on the\nfailure of a defendant to take the stand --\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: As I said --\nJUSTICE ALITO: They are not supposed to\nvouch for witnesses, that would be a viable theory in\nyour opinion?\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: I -- I believe that there\nis an argument. It's not the argument that I am making.\nThe argument that I am making it matters what the D.A.\nis training on. If the D.A. is training on trial\ntactics, that's one thing. But here the D.A. is\ntraining on how to use a database, and he's not training\nthe lawyers who are going to be using it.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Rosenkranz, you have,\nit seems to me, a theory of this case that is not the\ntheory that the Ninth Circuit went on. I mean, the\nNinth Circuit talks about training and supervising\ndeputy district attorneys. And why do we train them?\nBecause we want to ensure that they share information.\nNow you are cutting out the training and\nsupervision, and you are saying the obligation of the\nsupervising attorney is to have this information bank,\nwhich the deputy attorneys can then -- then consult,\nwhich, may be a very sound policy. But is it an element\nof due process that the supervising attorney has to\ndevise a system to share information? Where is there\nanything -- anything that the Court has held that\nsuggests that there is a data collection function\nrequired by due process?\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: So, Your Honor, let me\nask -- let me answer the first half first, which is\nabout what the Ninth Circuit held. And first, I should\nsay what it is that we argued to the Ninth Circuit.\nIt's on -- it's in our brief, very clearly\nwe've presented on page -- excuse me -- on page 17 of\nour brief, that big paragraph, the only full paragraph,\nwe present both what we argued to the Ninth Circuit,\nwhich was about the creation of a database, and what\nPetitioners argued to the Ninth Circuit, which reflected\nexactly what we were saying. So petitioners were not\nconfused. They attributed to us the argument that they,\nquote, failed to set up a system to disseminate to\ndeputy district attorneys information about plea deals\nand other assistance being offered to informants.\nThat was -- and that was directly out of our\nbrief. That was the first line of their brief, and the\nfirst line of our brief also referred to that.\nI agree, the Ninth Circuit spoke more about\ntraining than about this information database. But the\nNinth Circuit was also speaking only about --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And there is nothing in\nthe Ninth Circuit -- there was nothing that was\npresented to the Ninth Circuit by Mr. Goldstein that had\nto do with this talk about training?\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: There was, Your Honor. In\nour complaint we had two what might be called\ninformation management theories.\nOne -- and you can see it on page 45 of our\ncomplaint of the joint appendix, and so while the Court\nis orienting itself -- there were -- there's a theory of\ninformation management that is the most prominent theory\nin the complaint. If you look at the bottom of page 45,\nabout seven lines up from the bottom, you see two\ndistinct kind of subtheories.\nThe first is -- so it starts -- the line\nstarts purposely or with a deliberate indifference --\ntheory 1-A, that petitioners failed to create any system\nfor the deputy district attorneys handling criminal\ncases to access information, about informants, of\ncourse.\nTheory B, two lines from the bottom, \"that\nthey failed to train deputy district attorneys to\ndisseminate information pertaining to the benefits\nprovided to jailhouse informants.\" That's also about\ndisseminating it internally. If one turns to page 69,\nthe specific allegations against Petitioners, you see\nparagraph 154, repeatedly talking about this information\nsystem, this information sharing system, both as a\nsystem to create and as a failure to train. But, again,\ntrain on what? Train on the need, when you don't have\nthe system, to inform the other guy that you've just\nmade a deal with the informant.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But I would like to follow\nthat up a bit by saying, one, I'm not sure what this\ndifference between what you are arguing now and what you\nare arguing then matters. I don't understand it,\nfrankly. I don't actually understand it, because I\nagree, when you were in the Ninth Circuit, with what you\nsaid: It's a failure to disseminate information. And\nthen you said: And it's a failure to train and\nsupervise. You did say that. Now, why that matters, I\ndon't know, because the problem that -- maybe it does\nmatter, maybe it doesn't. So I have to say I don't\nunderstand it. Now, help my understanding.\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: I don't think it does\nmatter.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. I know you\ndon't, but I'm not worried about that. I'm worried\nabout my understanding of your argument, and that's what\nI am trying to get to. Answer this question, please,\nbecause it will help me: The obvious response is the\nresponse the Government made. You can take any -- which\nis what Justice Alito said. So I would just like to you\nelaborate on it. You can take anything that the D.A.\ndoes that is wrong in the case, you know, some horrible\nthing he did. And maybe he shouldn't be immune, but he\nis, okay? Or maybe he should be. There we are.\nSo, here I know I can't bring this suit, but\nhere's what I claim: You failed to have a system that\ndid... and now we fill in the blank. And whatever that\nblank is, it's going to be something that would have\nstopped him from doing this bad thing. In your case, it\nhappens to be an information dissemination system. In\nother case, it would be some other kind of system that\nwould have the effect of stopping this bad thing. So,\ntheir point is that, if you can go ahead with yours, so\ncan anybody else go ahead with theirs, and that is the\nend of immunity. Okay?\nNow, what is your response? That's what I\nwant to know.\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, my response to\nthat is very simple: I don't know of any other trial\nright -- prosecutorial misconduct, that can be\ncontrolled -- excuse me, where you can evade immunity\nunder our theory the way you can with a theory that is\nbased on the management --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Sure, it's easy. What the\nprosecutor does is he makes the most horrendous\nprejudicial argument you'd ever see. So we say: What\nyou need in the D.A.'s office, since this happens all\nthe time, are classes, or what you need is a special\nsection of the library where they have horrible\narguments underlined, okay?\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: And so, I can do that. So\ncan you. You are very good at it. And any good lawyer\ncan do that. And that's their point. So, if your only\nresponse, that's your response, your point is that a\ngood lawyer, while he can do yours, couldn't do others,\nI understand the response. I'm not sure I agree with\nit.\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: No, Your Honor, and I was\nbeginning to say before that there is nothing at all\nexotic about the theory. The same lines are being drawn\nby this Court all the time. For example, in Kalina, a\nvery fine line between the prosecutor who is creating\ncharging documents on the one hand, writing them,\nsubmitting them to the Court, and then on the other\nhand, signing them. Or, in the investigative cases, the\nline between the process of gathering information, the\nraw data, on the one hand; and on the other hand, the\nassessment of that data for trial.\nAnd so, when you are talking about a\nprosecutor and trying to hold the district attorney\nvicariously liable for decisions of a trial lawyer, that\nis just very different from trying to hold the district\nattorney liable for the process of managing data, raw\ninformation, that may or may not ever make its way into\na courtroom.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Your theory applies to any\nsystem of data dissemination. Is that -- would that be\ncorrect?\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Any one that is\nconstitutionally based, Your Honor. I mean, one where\nyou could imagine a prosecution on the other end with a\nconstitutional right that is violated.\nJUSTICE ALITO: If the prosecutor has the\npolicy of failing to distribute to the line attorneys\nthe latest Ninth Circuit decision or the latest\ndecisions of this Court on important issues of criminal\nconstitutional procedure, because they just don't like\nthe way the law is developing in these areas. So they\nlike the law the way it existed at sometime in the past,\nand they are just not going to distribute any of that.\nWould that be a theory?\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Well, you have to imagine a\nworld in which the district attorney is depriving people\nof the tools of their trade so that they can't get it\nelsewhere. There is actually a real case that I -- that\nI've heard about where, you know, the district attorney\ndecided way back when to stop buying supplements for\nstatutory -- for statute books, and so district\nattorneys, line prosecutors were charging under the\nwrong statutes.\nThat, to me Your Honor, is a commissary\nfunction. It is a function of an administrator trying\n-- making decisions about how to arm the trial lawyer.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Can I ask you this\nquestion? I know we have an immunity case, but your\nunderlying cause of action, the one you just described,\nthe policy there of not filing supplements, or say you\nhad a policy of training lawyers how to evade the Batson\nissue. There are all sorts of troublesome policies that\nmight be developed. Are you aware of any case in which\nthe court has held that such a policy can be challenged\nin the abstract, in the -- as, sort of, on its face,\nrather than as applied?\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: You are asking whether the\npolicy --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: The policy when they --\nwhen they deny someone his Giglio rights or so on and so\non. Have you had any cases like this one in which a\ncourt has held that such a cause of action is available\nagainst an office policy?\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: That such a cause of\naction --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Can be brought under 1983\nfor such a general policy?\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: In the absence of a\nconstitutional injury?\nJUSTICE STEVENS: That it will produce on a\nregular basis constitutional --\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: No, Your Honor, I am aware\nof any such case, but I will say --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Then it seems to me that\nin this case the absolute immunity question is harder\nthan the question that you present on the merits.\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, it's actually\nnot, and I will tell you why. Our -- we do not have to\nallege, for a 1983 case, that the conduct complained of\nwas unconstitutional. All we have to allege was that\nthe conduct caused a constitutional violation. So, for\n1983 purposes, this case is a case -- most clearly, most\nprominently our theory would be that this case is a case\nin which the district attorney was aware of this market\nbazaar atmosphere of trading in illegal -- excuse me --\nin perjured jailhouse confessions and did nothing to\nintervene. It's sort of a classic Hanton claim.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But the bottom line would\nbe, if you are right, that every district attorney in\nthe country, large or small office, would have to have a\ndata bank that can be shared by all prosecutors,\ninformants that are used. That would be the\nconstitutional requirement for every supervising\nprosecutor in the land.\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Not necessarily, Your\nHonor. First of all, Giglio imposes the -- or puts the\ndistrict attorneys on notice as to what they ought to be\ndoing. But the constitutional requirement would be when\nyou were aware of strong warnings of this bizarre\natmosphere in which jailhouse confessions are being used\nin this way, and you are aware that lawyers on one side\nof the office don't know what lawyers on the other side\nof the office are doing, then, yes, you are deliberately\nindifferent to the constitutional violations.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I was surprised by\nyour answer to Justice Stevens's hypothetical, because I\nthought it undermines your case. You said that you\ndon't have to show that the data system is\nunconstitutional. You just have to show that it caused\na constitutional violation. But it would cause a\nconstitutional violation as applied in a particular\ncase. And you would object to it in that case, and\nperhaps all this data sharing information system would\nbe very good evidence in that case. Look, he didn't\nturn over this document. The reason he didn't turn it\nover is because they've got a policy of not giving them\nthe document. But your objection would have to be based\nin a particular case. And we have already held that in\nthat case there is absolute immunity.\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Yes, Your Honor, and that\nis true of almost every prosecutorial immunity case.\nThe injury almost always happens when the lapse\nmaterializes in injury in the courtroom.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Exactly. Now,\ndoesn't that just confirm the concern that has been\nexpressed that all you're doing is circumventing the\nabsolute immunity we recognized at trial.\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: No, Your Honor, not any\nmore --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Even though the data\nsystem, as you've said, doesn't cause a constitutional\nviolation. It's the application of it at trial. Now, I\nknow that's immune. You say, well, I'm going to get\naround it.\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Well, not any more, Your\nHonor, than Buckley or Burns were circumnavigating\naround Imbler. I mean in those cases, the\nconstitutional violations -- excuse me -- the acts that\nwere being challenged were fabricating evidence. Why?\nThe only purpose for fabricating the evidence was to\nproduce it in the courtroom. Giving legal advice to\nextract a confession in a particular way. Why? The\nonly purpose was to use that in the courtroom.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But you began this\ndialogue by suggesting that you don't -- I am saying --\nyou don't have to prove that what you are complaining\nabout causes a -- is a constitutional violation. You\njust have to prove that it causes a Constitutional\nviolation.\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Right, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: In all the examples\nyou just gave me, it seems to me the allegation would be\nthat --\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: No, not -- under Cedank,\nYour Honor, it was not -- it would not be a\nconstitutional violation to extract a confession from\nsomeone until that confession is used in the courtroom.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but that gets\n-- it seems to me a fundamental tension in your case.\nWhen you are talking about the conduct, you need to link\nit to a particular constitutional violation. The data\nsystem has to be linked. But when you are talking about\nimmunity, you want to say, oh, it has got nothing to do\nwith the constitutional violation. It's just shuffling\npaper.\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Well, Your Honor, that's\nexactly right. It is because the functional approach --\nfor purposes of a functional approach, you never look at\nthe case through the lens of a constitutional violation.\nYou look at it through the lens of the conduct that's\nbeing challenged. So that's what, for example, this\nCourt did in Kalina. The constitutional violation\noccurred in the courtroom, but the lens that the Court\nlooked at it through was the specific conduct where this\nCourt said --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But your client's standing\nto challenge this whole policy is the fact that he was\nthe victim of the -- of the use of the policy in a\nparticular case for which the prosecutor has\nabsolute immunity.\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Yes, Your Honor, and that\nis always true in an immunity case. It is always true\nthat the -- that the injury materializes in the\ncourtroom. And this Court said in Buckley and in Burns\nit is utterly irrelevant where the injury materializes.\nWhat is relevant is whether you have a --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But I think you told me\nearlier that there are no prior cases in which such -- a\nperson who suffered such an injury can bring an\nindependent 1983 case challenging the policy at large.\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Well, that's correct, Your\nHonor, but it's a rare event that gets discovered.\nThank you, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nNow, Mr. Coates, you have eight minutes\nremaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF TIMOTHY T. COATES\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. COATES: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nI think some of the Court's comments have\nunderscored the tension in this case that the nature of\nthe constitutional claim here: That the rights that\nwere actually violated are the Giglio and Brady rights.\nBut the function we are talking about is the function of\ncomplying with Brady and Giglio.\nYou can do it in various fashions. Maybe\nit's a data base. Maybe it's something else. Maybe in\nsome cases it's even foreclosing particular witnesses\nfrom testifying because you don't trust them. That is\nessentially what the district attorney's policy is now.\nIt -- it forecloses deputy district attorneys from just,\nwilly-nilly, using jailhouse informants. They have\nsevere restrictions on what they can do.\nIt's hard to imagine a -- a policy that is\nmore directed to courtroom behavior than something\nthat's caveating the discretion of a particular line\nprosecutor as to which witnesses they can use.\nI think what we have here is a\nconstitutional claim that the tighter they try and draw\nnot just the causation, but the nature of the obligation\nitself is tied to the prosecutorial function. Because\nit's part of the prosecutorial function to assure the\ndisclosure of exculpatory information under Brady and --\nand Giglio.\nAnd so I would submit that under Imbler this\nCourt has already held that that conduct by an\nindividual prosecutor falls squarely within immunity.\nAnd I submit that there is -- there is simply no\ndistinction for that kind of conduct when it's done in\nthe courtroom and that kind of conduct when it's done in\nadvance in all cases by a supervising prosecutor or by a\nchief advocate. If the Court has no further questions\n--\nJUSTICE BREYER: I suppose the distinction\nhe's trying to make maybe -- I'm not sure I've got it\nright, but you see there are certain kinds of systems\nthat maybe administratively an office ought to have.\nAnd where it turns out that this is really an\nadministrative system, a lot of offices do have it, some\ndon't, but where it was negligent not to have it and the\nvery presence of it would have prevented the -- the\nindividual in the courtroom from behaving the way he\ndid, well, that's a separate kind of a claim. That's an\nadministrative claim.\nJust as if, for example, suppose you had no\nsecretary or assistants. He says, look, everybody\nshould have secretarial assistance. And if only you had\nsecretarial assistance, these people would not have\nmisread everything the way they did or would have gotten\nthe phone calls or would have done something like that.\nThat's the kind of line -- so he's trying to draw a line\nthere between something that is pretty purely\nadministrative and -- and something that is really\nsupervisory and training. And he is not saying\nsupervisory and training. He is saying that was a\nseparate claim.\nMR. COATES: Well, I think it's hard for him\nto get away from the manner in which he is trying to\ncharacterize it as being just administrative because\nit's not information just sitting there in a vacuum.\nThe key thing is the policy that --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Training in today's world\nor he wants to say in that day's world, whatever it was.\nThey have information systems. They existed, and every\noffice ought to have them. And now he says I might lose\non that claim; but, nonetheless, it's not the kind of\nclaim that falls within Imbler. I think that's his\npoint. I'm not positive. He doesn't have to take my --\nMR. COATES: I think that is -- that is the\npoint. But I think our point is that trying to\ncharacterize that as an administrative system strips it\nof the -- the meaning for which you are collecting the\ndata. I mean, according to them, the reason we have the\nobligation is because of the prosecutorial obligation\nunder Giglio and Brady to make sure that exculpatory\ninformation gets out there. So it's -- it's not just\nadministrative.\nAnd I -- I assume if you look at the Ninth\nCircuit decision -- and I -- and one of the main focuses\nof the Ninth Circuit's decision in the case was not so\nmuch that it was merely administerial. It kind of\nreached that conclusion on this notion that decisions\nabout all cases are different than decisions about a\nparticular case.\nAnd I think our point is that, in looking at\nthe -- at the function performed here, you can't make\nthat distinction. That it really -- there really isn't\na distinction. That if you are making a decision for\nall cases, then you are making a decision for that\nparticular case.\nThere is no difference from making a policy\nin advance and saying everybody has to follow it. And\nthen, as I mentioned before, the criminal complaint is\nfiled, and you send out an e-mail saying comply with\nBrady, or this is how you comply with Brady. There is\nno real difference there.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
