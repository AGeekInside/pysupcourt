ZAS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe Speedy Trial Act protects the public, as\nwell as the personal interests of defendants, by\nmandating the prompt disposition of Federal criminal\nprosecutions. In this case, the Government and the\ndistrict court failed to comply with the clear\nrequirements of the act.\nAs relevant here, the act provides that the\ntrial of a defendant who pleads not guilty and who is\nreleased on bail shall commence within 70 days after\nthe indictment. The act, however, is not as inflexible\nas it sounds. The act permits numerous categories of\ndelay to be excluded from the 70-day limit.\nThe act also provides an enforcement\nmechanism. If more than 70 nonexcludable days elapse\nbetween the indictment and the trial, the indictment\nshall be dismissed.\nThis case concerns two periods of delay, that\neach exceed the 70-day time limit, and I'd like to\nfocus initially on the longer period of delay.\nThis is the delay that took place between\n2000 and 2001, after a competency proceeding was taken\nunder advisement. Just to put this delay in context, a\ncompetency hearing was held on July 10, 2000. The\njudge solicited post-hearing briefs. The matter was\ntaken under advisement on August 23rd, and in our\npapers, we asked the judge to find Petitioner competent\nand to set the matter for trial as soon as possible.\nWe noted that at that point the case was already more\nthan 4 years old. We offered to waive a jury and\nproceed to a bench trial immediately.\nAnd at that point, the case sat idle for the\nnext 195 days. Now, the act excludes only the first 30\ndays of that period. That's section 3161(h)(1)(J). For\nreasons that have never been explained, the court sat\non the proceeding.\nWhen 7 months went by, we filed a motion.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What about, Mr. Zas, that\nthe court thought it was home free on the Speedy Trial\nAct? After all, it had gotten a waiver for all time.\nIsn't that why the 165 days?\nMR. ZAS: That may be, Justice Ginsburg, but\n-- but as of our filing after the competency\nproceeding, we asked for a trial as soon as possible.\nSo putting aside whether the waiver had any validity at\nall, which I'll get to shortly, the waiver had no\neffect when we came in and asked for a trial.\nOtherwise, defendants would have no right to a speedy\ntrial and --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes, but on -- on that one,\nthe -- the Second Circuit said that he was incompetent,\nand you could have excluded the time on (4) because (4)\nallows you to exclude time when he's incompetent. And\nif, in fact, the district judge is sitting there\nthinking he's incompetent, then the failure is simply a\nfailure to write down his reason why it's excluded. I\nguess there's uncertainty here as to what reason\nwas the district judge excluded that time, and it's a\nlittle bit hypothetical for the reason that Justice\nGinsburg mentioned.\nBut if you were to lose on the first point,\nthen I guess on this point, the thing to do would be to\nsend it back and determine whether, in fact, the judge\nintended to exclude on the ground of competency, in\nwhich case his failure was simply a failure to note\ndown his reason, which is not required by the act.\nMR. ZAS: Well, Justice Breyer, I have\nseveral responses for that.\nThe court only made a finding that Mr. Zedner\nwas incompetent on March 21, 2001. Prior to that time,\nthe competency issue was under advisement. It couldn't\nbe that Mr. Zedner's incompetency, if it existed before\nthe finding, is what prevented the court from declaring\nhim incompetent.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: You're not quite through\nyour answer yet, but is there also a requirement that\nthe competency determination be made within 30 days?\nOr am I -- am I in error on that point?\nMR. ZAS: Your Honor is -- is exactly right.\nAny proceeding under section 3161(h)(1)(J) is excluded\nbut only for 30 days once it's taken under advisement.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I'm sorry. My act must read\ndifferently. My act says in (4), any period of delay\nresulting from the fact that the defendant is mentally\nincompetent. It doesn't say anything about 30 days.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But that -- but that's\ndifferent, I take it, from the judge's delay in making\nthe finding of competency.\nMR. ZAS: That's right, Your Honor. Yes.\nOn -- Justice Breyer, on your reading, a -- a\ncourt could sit indefinitely with the competency\nproceeding under advisement.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes, that's why, see, I\nguess on this point, we'd have to send it back because\nif, in fact, the judge had determined in his mind\nwithin the 30-day period that the person was incompetent\nor he was incompetent in fact, then that could have been\nhis reason.\nI'm not sure what to do about this point in\nany case, and I understand that you think he wasn't\nincompetent, or at least it hadn't been so found. The\nSecond Circuit seemed to think he was incompetent\nbecause that was their basis. So I guess if he was,\nit's excluded, and if he wasn't, it isn't excluded.\nAnd I don't know. The Second Circuit said he was. So\nmaybe you should have another chance to argue this\nbefore the Second Circuit.\nMR. ZAS: Your Honor, I'm -- I'm just trying\nto envision what that remand would look like. If the\nCourt were -- if the -- if the case were to go back to\nthe Second Circuit and then go back to the district\ncourt for a finding that this delay resulted from Mr.\nZedner's incompetency, that finding would be clearly\nerroneous. There is no -- there is no basis --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The delay -- the delay was\nnot because we can't try this man because he's\nincompetent, and until he's rendered competent, we --\nwe have to stay proceedings. That wasn't the basis at\nall. It was just I haven't made up my mind yet.\nMR. ZAS: That's right, Your Honor, and the\nact --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Which is what is\nspecifically precluded by the requirement that -- that\nyou act within 30 days, and -- and all the rest of the\ntime, the clock is running.\nMR. ZAS: That's correct, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And I take it the trial --\nthe Speedy Trial Act doesn't say if the judge is\nthinking about something, it requires him to make an\norder.\nMR. ZAS: No, Your Honor. It -- it says that\nthe court has decide the matter within 30 days or the\nclock will start running.\nNow, the court, in a particularly difficult\nor novel question, could -- could enter an order of\nends of justice exclusion and exclude perhaps an\nadditional period of time.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I was going to ask\nyou about that. Or could he vacate submission because\nhe wants new evidence or something? Could you vacate\nsubmission of the -- of the first competency hearing in\norder to take new evidence?\nMR. ZAS: Absolutely, Your Honor. And that\nmatter would -- would be back to a -- a situation in\nwhich there's examinations or hearings or argument or\npost-hearing brief, and -- and the judge can take as\nlong as the judge wants there. But once the court has\nthe matter under advisement, the court only has 30\ndays.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So your view is that we\nshould say that the Second Circuit's statement that the\ndefendant could not have been tried because, at that\ntime, he was incompetent, that we should simply say\nthat's false, that the Second Circuit is wrong to say\nthat.\nMR. ZAS: Well, not quite, Your Honor. The\nquestion -- the question is did more than 70\nnonexcludable days elapse during this period or not.\nOnce the finding was made in March, that's when Mr.\nZedner was incompetent. No further findings was\nnecessary -- were necessary, and the time is then\nautomatically excluded. The time prior counts toward\nthe 70-day period whether or not he was in some\nmetaphysical sense incompetent before then.\nThe question is not whether he could have\nbeen tried or not in that period. The question is did\nmore than 70 days elapse. And if the judge had decided\nthis matter sooner, Mr. Zedner would have been --\nreceived the treatment he ultimately got much sooner,\nand the trial would have occurred much sooner. That's\nthe purpose of the Speedy Trial Act.\nNow, the Government has abandoned the Second\nCircuit's holding to the effect that harmless error\nanalysis applies to a violation of the 70-day limit.\nThat's a wise position for the Government take -- to\ntake, given this Court's holding in Bozeman which\ninterpreted essentially the same language. The Court\nthere held that where the statute says the indictment\nshall be dismissed, there's no room for harmless error\nanalysis. That's the remedy that Congress chose. So\nin this case on the -- on the -- this period of delay\nwe're talking about, more than 70 days elapsed, and the\nremedy must be dismissal.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Now, we've been talking\nabout the competency period. I take it the first\nperiod was one of just repeated requests for\nextensions. That's January '97 until May '97.\nMR. ZAS: That's correct.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And that's this -- that's\nthe first of the two periods that's involved here.\nMR. ZAS: That's correct. This was -- this\nwas a -- an adjournment that was requested by Mr.\nZedner's first lawyer for the stated purpose of\ninvestigating whether the Onited States Bond,\nsupposedly issued by the Ministry of Finance of USA,\nwas genuine. The court, having already obtained a\npurported waiver of a speedy trial for all time,\ngranted the continuance, but made no order of\nexcludable delay, as it had done previously, made no --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I don't know if it makes\nany difference to the case. Do you -- do you think the\ncourt could have made findings that would have been\njustified? I mean, it takes a while to find an expert\nto say that a bond is genuine when it spells United\nwith O, but --\n(Laughter.)\nMR. ZAS: It could take for all time, Your\nHonor.\nI think it would be a very close question as\nto whether that could survive appellate review. That\nmay well be an abuse of discretion to find, after\nhaving let the matter -- delayed the matter already 10\nmonths, to grant another 3 months for that purpose.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Are there -- are there\ncases in which the judge's findings -- let's assume\nthat he made the findings -- are set aside for abuse of\ndiscretion on -- on review for a violation of the\nSpeedy Trial Act?\nMR. ZAS: That is the standard that the courts\nof appeals have generally applied. I can't recall a\ncase where the court actually reversed an ends of\njustice finding. There may well be one based on a\nlegal error where it was some obvious ground that --\nthat is not a basis for an adjournment such as --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Who -- who could complain?\nBecause in -- in all of these instances, it was the\ndefendant who sought the enlarged time. In fact, even\nthough the judge had given -- gotten this all-purpose\nwaiver, he didn't give defense counsel as much time as\ndefense counsel asked for to -- to investigate the\ngenuineness of the bond.\nMR. ZAS: Well, Justice Ginsburg, you're\nright. Certainly the Petitioner and his counsel at the\ntime requested this adjournment. They did get the full\nadjournment they requested, but the judge said that\nthat would be the last adjournment and that the matter\nwould be set for trial then.\nBut whether that time is excludable or not is\nanswered by the statute. The ends of justice provision\nrecognizes that defendants or prosecutors and judges on\ntheir own motion would seek or grant continuances, but\nthat's not enough under the statute. The statute is --\nalthough it's flexible, is rigorous. The court must\nmake a finding that the ends of justice outweigh the\npublic's and the defendant's interest in a speedy\ntrial.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And you think it's -- it's\nnot harmless error if they didn't make the finding but\n-- but could have?\nMR. ZAS: That's right, Your Honor. It's not\nharmless for the same reason the later period is not\nharmless because the statute says that if the defendant\nis not brought to trial within the time limits, the\nindictment shall be dismissed. And it makes very clear\nthat in the absence of an ends of justice finding, the\ntime is not excludable.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, but isn't -- isn't the\ndifference that in the latter period, the court took no\naction, and there is a mandate on the court to act?\nWith respect to this earlier period, the court did act.\nIncidentally, it did exactly what the defendant wanted\nit to do, but it acted so that the only -- the only\nreason for arguing error here is, in effect, a clerical\nreason. He didn't say the magic words or make the\nmagic conclusion. If, in fact, that's because he\ncouldn't have made it, no question. You -- you got a\nviolation of the statute. But if he could have made it\nand -- and simply didn't say the magic words, you're in\na very different position here from what you are in --\nin the case of -- of the failure to act on the -- on\nthe competency issue.\nMR. ZAS: Justice Souter, I would -- I would\nnot characterize this as a clerical error. Congress\nconsidered this provision the heart of -- of a scheme.\nThis was where --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, let's put it this way.\nIt's a failure to speak rather than a failure to act.\nIn -- in the latter case, no action. In this case,\naction, in fact, action as more -- it's as requested.\nBut a failure to speak contemporaneously with the\naction, that's different.\nMR. ZAS: Well, I would disagree, again with\nthe characterization that it's just a failure to speak.\nThe act requires a careful weighing of the public's\ninterest, the ends of justice, the defendant's\ninterest. So it's not just a matter of speaking. This\nis --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, we don't -- we don't\nknow. I mean, on the face of the record, we don't know\nwhether he weighed or whether he didn't weigh. In the\nsecond case, we know that he didn't act, and -- and\naction is what he's got to -- to accomplish. But\nwhether he weighed or not, we don't know. He just\ndidn't say whether he weighed.\nMR. ZAS: That's right, and the court also\ndidn't make the finding --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Right.\nMR. ZAS: -- or state the reasons that the\nstatute specifically requires. And the question for\nthe Court is what flows from that failure. And the\nanswer is given in the sanctions provision. It says\nthat if more than 70 nonexcluded days elapse, the\nindictment shall be dismissed.\nNow, that provision itself builds in\nflexibility to take into account exactly what Your\nHonor is talking about. A judge may dismiss without\nprejudice to re-prosecution depending on various\nfactors, including whether it was just an oversight, a\nfailure to recite words. So that's where --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No. I -- I --\nMR. ZAS: -- that's where this -- this\ndistinction that you're drawing can be taken into\naccount.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But it's -- it requires --\nin order for us to conclude that that's the only way it\ncan be taken account -- into account, we -- we'd have\nto conclude that -- that rule 52 was, in effect,\npartially repealed and made inapplicable implicitly\nhere without any reference to it. And that's -- that\nkind of, let's say, implicit modification of -- of one\nof the rules is, as a matter of normal interpretation,\ndisfavored.\nMR. ZAS: Well, Your Honor, I think that the\nprinciple -- well-accepted principle that the more\nspecific provision will govern over the general governs\nhere. So the remedy provision, the sanctions provision\nhere says that the indictment shall be dismissed\nwhether it's 71 days that elapsed or 200 days or 5\nyears.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But there's always some\nsanction for error, and the point of the harmless error\nrule is to determine whether that specific sanction\nshould be applied.\nMR. ZAS: Yes, but there's not always a -- an\nexpress command from Congress as to what the remedy\nshould be. Once Congress says the indictment shall be\ndismissed, there's no room for a court to say that the\nindictment shall not be dismissed unless there's some\nharm shown. So this specific provision trumps the more\ngeneral provisions of rule 52(a).\nJUSTICE BREYER: I'd like to know how -- how\ndo we know that the judge didn't set forth orally his\nreasons for finding that the ends of justice outweigh\nthe interest, et cetera? Is that in the record what he\nactually said?\nMR. ZAS: Well, you only --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Because I don't know that\nyou'd have to use the exact words, the ends of justice\nserved. You know, you don't have to -- I'd like to\nread what he actually said, and where -- where is that?\nIt's not on page 192, which is somebody's opinion.\nBut rather, if I want to read the words, where do I\nlook?\nMR. ZAS: Your Honor, this -- the only place\nyou will find the words here are the transcript of the\nstatus conference on January 31, 1997. That's the\njoint appendix beginning at page 80, and you will not\nfind a finding regarding the ends of justice. You will\nnot find mention of the -- the public interest or any\nof the other balancing factors in the act --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: He didn't think he needed\nit. He had a perpetual waiver.\nMR. ZAS: That's correct. This judge stopped\ncomplying with the act on November 8th, 1996 because\nthe court ruled that the waiver for all time was valid.\nThat was a -- an injudicious finding, to say the\nleast. 5 minutes worth of legal research would have\nshown that all the courts of appeals at the time had\nalready held that the waivers were invalid.\nSo the court didn't do a balancing, didn't\nthink it was doing a balancing. The court has a\ncolloquy in which it appropriately expressed skepticism\nabout the need for this delay, and the court does, in\neffect, what Congress was concerned about. It indulged\ndefense counsel and said, well, if you don't care\nenough, I don't care enough. Take 3 more months.\nThat's basically what happened.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Zas, are you going to\ntalk about estoppel?\nMR. ZAS: Yes, Your Honor. The -- the\nGovernment, for the first time, here in this Court has\nunveiled a new doctrine that hadn't been in the case\nbefore. It's no longer relying on either the waiver\nfor all time or the sort of mini-waiver for the -- the\nJanuary delay. But it argues that Petitioner is\nestopped from challenging the 90-day delay in 1997.\nThere are several problems with the\nGovernment's argument, but the most obvious one is that\nthe only conduct that the Government cites to trigger\nthe estoppel is the waiver.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, isn't there something\nmore than a waiver here? I mean, waiver is a very\nbroad term. I mean, it would cover a situation, for\nexample, in which the Government asked for time and the\ndefendant said, okay, I waive. In -- in this case,\nthere's -- there's an affirmative act on the part of\nthe defendant. He's not merely waiving. He is\naffirmatively asking for action on the part of the\ncourt, and subject I guess to cutting down the period\nsomewhat, he got what he asked for. This is something\nmore than waiver. This is, in fact, a -- a grant of\nspecific relief requested by him, and he now wants to\nturn the tables based on receiving exactly what he\nasked for. That's more than waiver.\nMR. ZAS: Well, Your Honor, I can't disagree\nwith what you've said, but -- but the --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I can. Did he ask for\na perpetual waiver? I thought the way the colloquy\nwent, the judge said, no, you know, I can't give you a\nwaiver unless you'll -- unless you'll make it a\nperpetual waiver. And then he said, okay, I'll make it\na perpetual waiver. Wasn't -- wasn't the -- the\ninitiative for the perpetual waiver from -- from the\ncourt?\nMR. ZAS: That's right, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And hasn't my brother\ncleverly changed my hypothetical? Because I was --\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- I was not talking about\nthe perpetual waiver. I was talking about the waiver\nfor whatever number of days he actually took in -- in\nthat case, which was what? 90 days?\nMR. ZAS: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yes.\nMR. ZAS: I think -- I think there are two\ndifferent waivers that --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Okay.\nMR. ZAS: -- that are before the Court.\nSo, Justice Souter, your question is about\nnot the waiver for all time, but the more limited\naction in requesting and obtaining the continuance.\nNow, ordinarily without a statute like this,\nthe defendant getting what he wants would amount to a\nwaiver and the defendant could complain. For example,\nan evidentiary ruling. If -- if the defendant wants to\nallow -- he doesn't object to evidence coming in,\nthat's it. He can't later argue that it should not\nhave come in.\nThe problem here is that the statute -- the\nCongress knew that this kind of thing would happen.\nDefendants would want delay. Defendants would be quite\nhappy to put off their trial for as long as they could.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: As long as they're not in\njail pending trial.\nMR. ZAS: That's right. That's right. If\nthey're out in the community, Congress wanted those\npeople to be tried. And so the ends of justice\nprovision specifically says that a request for a\ncontinuance granted by the court is not enough to\nexclude time. There has to be both a finding and a\nstatement of reasons in the record to support the\nfinding before the time will be excluded.\nJustice Breyer --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Maybe you could say then\nthat it's the Government that has the right. If it's\nthe Government that has the right, then Government\nshould have objected.\nI mean, the problem, of course, is obvious,\nthat it's a little hard on the district judges that\npeople come in and both sides tell them what you have\nto have here is a waiver. Are you sure you won't raise\nthis against me later? I'm positive. I swear. You\nmean you absolutely swear a thousand times that no\nmatter what I do and have delay, you will never raise\nthis as an error and it's fine? Yes. Okay? So he\nsays, okay, fine, done. You win. Then he raises it as\nan error. That's rather -- called sandbagging the\njudge.\nAnd obviously, one would look to -- or I\nwould look to ways to avoid that, but you're telling me\nI can't avoid it, and that's what Congress wanted and\nso be it. Is that right?\nMR. ZAS: Well, it's -- it's partially\ncorrect, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: How is it not correct?\nThat's what I'm --\nMR. ZAS: Well, it's not correct because I\nwould -- I would disagree with the characterization, if\nthat's what Your Honor is doing, of -- of anything that\nhappened here as being sandbagging.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I'm not talking about here.\nI'm saying that in your -- if I adopt your position in\nthis case, I would have to have the same position, I\nwould think, in the most egregious cases. Wouldn't I?\nBecause the only reason I'd adopt it here is because\nCongress wanted it no matter what.\nMR. ZAS: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Is that right?\nMR. ZAS: Yes, that -- that is --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay. Then you're -- then\nam I right in characterizing?\nMR. ZAS: Well, that -- that is what the --\nthat is what the statute says. But Your Honor\nshouldn't -- shouldn't tarry too long about the\nconsequences because if this Court holds, as we ask the\nCourt to hold, that waivers are no good -- waivers have\nto be treated essentially as a request for a\ncontinuance -- this problem goes away.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Maybe. I mean, judges are\nvery busy. Not all the prosecutors get the word. It's\nvery hard to ask district judges to raise something on\ntheir own in the face of lawyers who are telling them\nthe opposite. So you say, oh, they'll all know. I've\nnoticed there are a lot of opinions we write that they\ndon't know about --\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- until, say, the lawyers\npoint them out.\nMR. ZAS: Well, Your Honor, the alternative,\nif you go sort of the Government's route here, is to\nessentially perpetuate the confusion that brought us\nhere in the first place. The Government essentially\nargues, well, you can't waive, but sometimes you can\nwaive. We're not quite -- we're not going to tell you\nexactly when you can waive. That's going to put\ndistrict judges in a -- in a worse position, in a more\nconfused position.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: This -- this was a judge\nwho apparently was doing this as a -- a matter of\nstandard practice. He had a form that he whipped out.\nIt must be a very old form. It looked like it was\ntyped on a regular typewriter.\nMR. ZAS: That -- that's right, Your Honor.\nThis form was -- was preprinted or pretyped.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And Gothic print, right?\nJUSTICE SOUTER: It could have come from my\nchambers.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. ZAS: And as we point out in the reply\nbrief, the judge had taken a strong legal position 20\nyears earlier that the requirements of the act could be\nwaived.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I was going to ask what is\nthe date of the Speedy Trial Act? 1975?\nMR. ZAS: I think President Ford signed it on\nJanuary 3rd, 1975.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And it was widely\npublicized among the judiciary then.\nMR. ZAS: Yes, yes. Yes, and you know, this\nis not a new statute. Judges are used to -- to\ncomplying with it. Prosecutors are used to doing it.\nFrankly, I've never seen a waiver for all time before.\nIt's not the kind of thing that will happen and it\nshould never happen again.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Can you make an ends\nof justice finding for all time? Could he start at the\nbeginning, any continuance I grant is granted after my\nweighing the different factors set forth in the statute\nand it's in the ends of justice?\nMR. ZAS: I don't think so, Your Honor. In\nfact, there -- there is a circuit split on -- on\nwhether you can -- whether a court can grant an open-\nended continuance. I think Your -- Your Honor's ends\nof justice continuance would amount to a waiver or a\nsuspension of the act.\nThank you very much.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Joseffer.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF DARYL JOSEFFER\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. JOSEFFER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nOn the first of the time periods, it might\nhelp if I could start by laying out three basic\nprinciples.\nThe first is that a defendant may not opt out\nof the act by waiver.\nThe second is that a -- a defendant is,\nnonetheless, precluded from challenging the grant of a\ncontinuance that he requested if the continuance\nsatisfies the substantive ends of justice standards of\nthe act and the defendant's waiver or other litigation\nconduct induced the court to commit the procedural\nerror of not recording an ends of justice finding in\nthe record.\nAnd the third related point, although it's\nnot presented here, is that the courts of appeals have\nrecognized that if a defendant requests an ends of\njustice continuance and the court in a procedurally\nregular manner grants the ends of justice continuance,\nthe defendant cannot later be heard to contend that\nthere was -- the ends of justice were not really\nsatisfied even though he had told the court that they\nwere.\nWe think the reasons for those three rules\nstems from the reason that defendants cannot opt out of\nthe act in the first place. Although the act does not\ncontain an express anti-waiver or anti-estoppel\nprovision, it does manifest an intent to bind\ndefendants to its requirements in order to protect the\npublic interest in a speedy trial. If a defendant\ncould opt out of the act altogether and thereby obtain\ndelays that are not authorized by the act, that would\nthwart the public interest in a speedy trial.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But -- but as we've\nindicated, the -- the judge was the one that opted out\nof the act by this regular practice of requiring the\nperpetual waiver, or whatever we call it.\nMR. JOSEFFER: I guess there -- there are\ncouple things there. One is that we are not -- we --\nwe are not here relying on the waiver for all time.\nOur point, instead, here is that when defendant\nrequested the continuance at issue here, it was the\ndefendant that said, Your Honor, I -- I need a\ncontinuance and I waive my rights so you should give me\nthe continuance and then also said he needed additional\npreparation time.\nThe court then -- and this -- this is at J.A.\nfrom about page 81 to 85. The court then said, well,\nwhy do you need the time? And the court discussed with\nhim for a while why he really needed additional\npreparation time, reminded counsel that,\nnotwithstanding the waiver, this was a criminal case\nand criminal cases do need to be tried, and ended up\nbalancing the defendant's desire for preparation\nagainst the need for a speedy trial by granting a much\nshorter continuance than requested. And that is\nactually an entirely appropriate ends of justice\nbalancing, ends of justice reasoning.\nJUSTICE BREYER: It's pretty hard to read\nthose pages as if they were anything other than what\nthey seemed to be on their face, that he didn't worry\nabout the Speedy Trial Act because he thought that it\nhad been waived.\nMR. JOSEFFER: I think you're absolutely\nright that the court was not, at that point, thinking\nin terms of applying the Speedy Trial Act.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, then why isn't that\nthe end of that, that the -- if you agree that the\ndefendant can't waive it, well, the reason that he got\nthe continuance is because he waived it, otherwise\nthere would have been something else done and -- or at\nleast might have been.\nMR. JOSEFFER: Right. No. Our -- I mean, we\nthink there are two related points. One is that a\ngenuine opt-out of the waiver and a general opt-out of\nthe act, an attempt to obtain time that's not\nexcludable under the act is not permissible because\nthat would thwart the public interest in a speedy\ntrial.\nBut where the error is a purely procedural\none, a failing to record findings in the record\nregarding a continuance that is permitted under the\nsubstantive standards of the act, then holding the\ndefendant to the waiver, under a theory of either\nwaiver or estoppel -- in our view doesn't matter\nwhich --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: How can we say it's purely\nprocedural with respect to the first time? I mean, the\nreason that was given is I have to -- I need this time\nto find out if these really peculiar looking bonds are\ngenuine.\nNow, the -- the Second Circuit said -- and I\ndon't understand why they said this -- this is a\ncomplex case so that continuance is warranted. Was\nthis a complex case?\nMR. JOSEFFER: Complex defendants can make\nfor complex cases.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. JOSEFFER: And this is, I think, the\nultimate example of that.\nBut in addition, it's important to remember\nthat at the end of this 90-day period that was granted,\ndefense counsel withdrew on the ground that his client\nwas still insisting that he present the frivolous\ndefense that -- that the bonds were genuine. And\nbefore withdrawing and telling the court that, the --\nthe defense counsel had a very serious duty to his\nclient and the court to continue to investigate what\nhis client was saying was the defense and to continue\nto try to work with his client and try to come up with\na plausible defense strategy. Now, it didn't work and\ncounsel had to withdraw, but I don't think he can be\nfaulted for trying.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Did the Government at any\npoint tell the -- tell the court, Your Honor, we think\nthe act requires you to make a specific finding and we\nrequest you do that?\nMR. JOSEFFER: No. The Government -- I mean,\non the one hand, the Government did not seek these\ndelays, did not encourage the waiver, did not rely on\nthe waiver at the -- at the relevant times. However,\nat the time -- I mean --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Because, I mean, you're --\nyou're coming in and saying, oh, well, he waived, but\ncertainly the Government could -- could have asked the\n-- asked the district court to make the necessary\nfindings.\nMR. JOSEFFER: Right, and at the time of --\nof this -- this was about 10 years ago now -- the\nSecond Circuit recently held that waiver is not\nordinarily appropriate, but sometimes is. And so\neveryone in the bar, I mean, has been acting under some\n-- some confusion, we think, that -- that frankly, to\nsome extent, persists to this day.\nWe think that the best way to clarify matters\ngoing forward is -- is a combination of the two things\nI mentioned earlier, to say, first, defendants cannot\nopt out of the act by waiver, to just try to discourage\nwaivers. But to say that mistakes will happen and that\nwhen a -- a continuance -- when a court grants a\nspecific continuance that is authorized under the\nsubstantive standards of the act, that at that point in\ntime, the defendant's waiver or other conduct that\ninduces a court not to make the findings prevents the\ndefendant from trying to seize on a purely procedural\nviolation on appeal because at that point -- remember,\nthe -- the reason for -- for a -- a partial anti-waiver\nrule here is not that there's a specific anti-waiver or\nanti-estoppel provision in the act. It's that Congress\nhas, on the whole, manifested an intent to protect the\npublic interest in a speedy trial. But if the time is\nexcludable under the substantive standards of the act,\na purely procedural error does not diminish the\npublic's interest in a speedy trial because the --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What -- what are you\nhypothesizing? That the court actually made this\nfinding in its mind but just didn't express it? Or are\nyou hypothesizing that the court could have made it but\ndidn't make it, never even went through the mental\nprocess?\nMR. JOSEFFER: We think that, legally\nspeaking, all that matters is that the court could\nhave, and that once --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Could have made it. So --\nso we're going to -- why can't life be simple? We're\ngoing to have to have trials all the time as to\nwhether, in this hypothetical situation, this finding\ncould have been made. I mean, you know, this creates\nsubsidiary litigation that we really don't need.\nMR. JOSEFFER: In -- in some instances, it\nmay add to an additional degree of complexity, although\nI'll say that whatever that might be, it's still less\nthan the complexity of retrying the case. And also, I\nthink more often than not, on the face of the record --\nI mean, these -- these determinations can be made.\nHere, for example -- I mean, if -- if a court\ngrants a continuance for any reason, it's going to ask\nthe reasons why. Here, the court questioned counsel as\nto whether he really needed more time, explained his\nbasic reasoning for doing so. And so when -- when it's\napparent on the record that a continuance could have\nbeen granted, that's certainly a much less complex inquiry\nthan trying the case.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Suppose you ask the judge.\nYou say, Judge, 2 months ago the defendant came to you\nand said, I waive the Speedy Trial Act. Now the\ndefendant says, Judge, I now would like a month's\ncontinuance. The judge says, I'll give it to you. The\nopposing counsel says why. He says, because he waived\nit.\nNow, you're telling me that, one, he cannot\nwaive it, but two, even though the judge said I did it\nbecause he waived it, that still itself is okay. We go\nahead and let him exclude it because the judge might\nhave done something differently. Is that what you're\nsaying?\nMR. JOSEFFER: Well, either -- you would need\nmore on the record there because if the record was\nlimited to what you just said, I don't think there\nwould be a basis for --\nJUSTICE BREYER: But it's possible you could\nargue, looking at the record, that the judge should\nhave tried it -- should have excluded it on a\ndifferent basis. He should have excluded it on the\nbasis of the interests of justice, et cetera required.\nSo what the judge said, just to make it\nclear, is I'm not even thinking about this different\nbasis, though I might. I'm doing it just because he\nwaived it. And now you're telling me, I take it, he\ncan't waive it, but nonetheless, the error is harmless\nbecause he waived it, or something like that.\nMR. JOSEFFER: At this -- at this point we're\nnot at the harmlessness point yet. This would be --\nJUSTICE BREYER: It's not harmless. You're\nsaying it's a procedural error.\nMR. JOSEFFER: Right, and --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So we don't say the judge is\nright because he waived it. We're saying he's right\nbecause the judge made a procedural error. I'm having\na hard time following that.\nMR. JOSEFFER: Well, anytime you're talking\nabout a waiver or estoppel theory, the premise is that\nthere -- there may well have been underlying error, and\nthe question is whether the defendant is precluded.\nAnd here, there's no question there was an underlying\nerror because the findings were not required -- were\nnot reported in the act.\nBut the act does -- again, does not contain\nan express anti-waiver provision, and the speedy trial\ninterests, which are the reason for reading, to some\nextent, an anti-waiver provision, are -- are not\ndiminished when the court could have properly excluded\nthe time from the act. And to the contrary, speedy trial\ninterests would be harmed in that manner for three\nreasons.\nFirst, it gives defendants every reason to\ndelay in hopes of manufacturing a speedy trial\nviolation.\nSecond, waiver and estoppel are generally\nimportant to the efficient and orderly conduct of\nlitigation, and if you take those -- that out, what you\nwill get is less efficient litigation and more delays,\nwhich Congress recognized when, as part of the Speedy\nTrial Act, it required the courts to develop management\nplans for the efficient handling of cases.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But, you know, Congress\ncould have -- could have written it the way -- the way\nyou're proposing it. Congress could have said, you\nknow, when there -- when -- when there is good cause\nfor the continuance, the clock won't run. It didn't\nsay that. It -- it said the judge has to make a\nfinding. I mean, don't we have to give that some\neffect?\nYou're saying it really doesn't matter\nwhether he makes the finding or not. So long as there\nwas good cause so that a finding could have been made,\nthat will be enough.\nMR. JOSEFFER: No. Our -- our view is that,\nI mean, like anytime the waiver or estoppel is at\nissue, one could say that that's being read into the\nstatute, but the point, as this Court has explained in\nHillen and -- and Mezzanatto, is that those are\nbackground principles of law that presumptively apply.\nOur view is this: a court should make the\nfinding, but a -- a defendant may not challenge the\nfinding if a few conditions are satisfied. First, the\ndefendant was the one requesting the continuance and\nbenefiting from it. Second, the finding could have\nbeen made on the record in the case, and third, the\ndefendant is responsible in some way for inducing the\ncourt not to make the finding. It could be by a waiver\nor it could be the defendant's -- or it could be the\ncourt saying, I've decided it's appropriate to make an\nends of justice finding. Now, let me record this in\nthe record, and defense counsel saying, Your Honor,\nplease don't bother. It's late. We've got four more\nthings to do. We don't need the findings. In that\ncircumstance as well, it's not a waiver, but defense\ncounsel would have -- the defendant at that point\nshould not be heard to complain about the absence of a\nfinding that should ultimately --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, it seems to me the\nGovernment is equally remiss for not pointing out the\nobligations of the court under the act.\nBut let me ask you this. Probably you can\nrespond to that as well if you like. What are the\nproblems with reindicting -- I mean, how -- how is the\nGovernment hurt if it can reindict? I recognize that\nit's costly to the system, et cetera. But is there\nany real prejudice there?\nMR. JOSEFFER: Well, I mean, there are two\nconcerns. One is, as you said, the -- the cost of\nhaving to do a brand new jury trial after you've\nalready done a fair one. The second is that -- I mean,\nin this case, the trial was 3 years ago.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, of course, I'm -- I'm\nsupposing that after this rule, there would be no trial\nbecause there would be -- if -- if you don't prevail,\nthere wouldn't be a trial.\nMR. JOSEFFER: Oh, I -- well, if dismissal\nwas required in this case, I think dismissal would be\nwithout prejudice as opposed to with prejudice and\ntherefore --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And I'm asking are there --\nare there severe costs with that when there's been no\ntrial?\nMR. JOSEFFER: If there had not already been\n-- oh.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: There's -- there's no\ntrial.\nMR. JOSEFFER: This is pretrial.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: The -- the action is\ndismissed for a Speedy Trial Act violation because the\nposition of the Petitioner here is accepted by this\nCourt and the Government just reindicts.\nMR. JOSEFFER: Oh, there's already been a\ntrial.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm hypothesizing that\nthere hasn't been.\nMR. JOSEFFER: Okay.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: The case is dismissed.\nMR. JOSEFFER: I see. It's dismissed before\ntrial.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And there is a\nreindictment.\nMR. JOSEFFER: Right. I understand.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: How costly is that to the\nsystem other than getting the grand jury together?\nMR. JOSEFFER: Sorry. I understand. Yes, if\n-- if pretrial --if the district court dismisses, then\nthe Government ordinarily could reindict for -- if the\ncourt dismisses without prejudice, the Government\nordinarily could reindict very quickly, and the cost to\nthe system would not be great.\nThe real cost to the system comes in when the\ndistrict court does not dismiss and holds the trial\nbecause then the trial has been held and then by the\ntime you get back down to the trial court -- I mean, in\nthis case, it'll probably be 4 years. And at that\npoint, sometimes you can do a retrial, but sometimes\nmemories fade, witnesses are lost, other sources of\nproof are lost. And as a result, you end up with --\nwith fairly -- you can end up with very severe\nconsequences in situations where the first trial is\nheld.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: In this -- is there a\nstatute of limitations problem in -- in these cases if\ntheir dismissal is without prejudice?\nMR. JOSEFFER: No. There's a -- the Judicial\nCode contains a -- a provision that generally contains\na 6-month grace period for limitations following\ndismissal by a court. So we would have -- I mean, by\nnow the limitations period would have run, but we would\nhave 6 months to -- to reindict.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- the -- the\nargument you're making is really one of invited error,\nand I'm not sure it even applies on these facts. I\nmean, the -- the defense lawyer didn't, as you\nhypothesized in one of your answers, say something to\nthe effect of don't worry, you don't need to make any\nfindings of the ends of justice or anything like that.\nHe just said I'm waiving my speedy trial rights, and\nthat may mean he's not gong to argue, you know, that\nthe ends of justice don't justify it or whatever. He's\njust saying I don't have any objection. Maybe he\nassumed that the judge would go on and say, okay, I'm\nmaking the findings required by subsection 8(a).\nMR. JOSEFFER: Well, I think that when a --\nwhen a litigant expressly waives his rights under an\nact, that the very natural effect of that is to make\nthe court think he does not have to follow that act and\nthat would include the findings requirement.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, in this case, the\njudge told the defendant I've got a solution to this.\nHere's my form.\nMR. JOSEFFER: No. It was the -- I mean, in\ncontext, there were two -- at the earlier status\nconference that does not relate to this hearing, but at\nthe earlier status, it was defendant who said, Your\nHonor, I want a continuance and I want to waive my\nrights. In response to defendant's invocation of a\nwaiver, the court said, well, if you're going to waive,\nyou have to waive for all time, because the court was\nconcerned the defendant would selectively waive until\nit was inconvenient for the court to try the case. We\ndon't defend the court's response to that, but the\npoint is that even then it was the defendant who raised\nwaiver first.\nAnd then at this status conference regarding\nthis particular continuance, it was -- defendant was\nthe only one talking about waiver. Defendant said --\ndefendant initially raised it and said I -- I waive my\nrights, then came back to it again. I waive my rights,\njust give me the continuance. And the court said -- I\nmean, the court did say that, well, if you've already\nwaived, you don't have to again. But he then said\nthat, notwithstanding the waiver, he couldn't give the\ndefendant an open-ended amount of time because this is\na criminal trial. So it was defendant who was -- who\nwas pressing this at all times.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Do you have any idea how\noften this -- this sort of situation comes up where\nthere's an alleged violation of the act and then a\ndenial by the district court of a pretrial motion to\ndismiss?\nMR. JOSEFFER: I think that happens with some\nregularity. There's quite a lot of court of appeals\ncase law in which defendants are protesting speedy\ntrial violations. I mean, actually quite a lot.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: You -- you made an argument\na moment ago which included the point that he asked for\nthis particular relief and represented what he needed\nto do if he got the relief, the continuance. You --\nyou came right up within a step of -- of making a\njudicial estoppel claim, although you did not use those\nterms. I have two questions.\nDid the Government raise at least the -- the\ntheory of judicial estoppel in the litigation before it\nreached this point?\nAnd the second question is, even if the\nGovernment did not raise that term, asked for -- for\nestoppel to be applied in those terms, did the\nGovernment make the same argument that you have just\nmade which emphasizes the fact that he asked for it and\nhe represented the reasons for -- for needing it?\nMR. JOSEFFER: Yes. In the -- in the court\nof -- the answer your first question, in the court of\nappeals -- we referred to our argument as one of waiver\nrather than estoppel, in part because that's what the\nSecond Circuit had in -- in the past referred to it as\nbeing. And yes, in substance, we were -- we -- we\nraised -- I mean, we were raising a similar waiver\nargument below as the one that we are now.\nWe don't think it matters greatly whether one\ncalls it waiver or estoppel, except that we do think\nthat estoppel is the -- is the -- the preferable way of\nlooking at because we're -- as -- as has been pointed\nout, we're talking here not just about a waiver, but\nalso about a situation where a defendant requests\nrelief --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yes. The difference between\nacquiescence and -- and potentially sandbagging.\nMR. JOSEFFER: Yes. I mean, here the -- the\ndefendant is affirmatively requesting relief on the\nbasis of one -- one position and is now seeking\ndismissal based on the fact that his first position was\naccepted and received that relief. And that's a\nsituation in which judicial estoppel is -- is, frankly,\ntailor-made for, and I think the fact that judicial\nestoppel prevents that very situation helps to\nunderscore the -- that if -- if Congress really wanted\nto --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Except -- except where\nthere's a public policy against what you want to estop\nhim into doing. I mean, it seems to me for the same\nreason that you don't allow a waiver, you shouldn't\nallow an estoppel. There's a public policy against it.\nThe -- the Congress wanted these things tried\npromptly, and -- and whether he merely waives or -- or\ngoes further and affirmatively causes the court to do\nsomething which it shouldn't have done, you're just as\nmuch violating the policy it seems to me.\nMR. JOSEFFER: Well, I think the -- I mean, I\n-- I agree that -- I mean, whether it's waiver or it's\nestoppel, if Congress manifests an affirmative intent\nto displace those doctrines, they don't apply. And it\ndoesn't matter which -- which one you're under.\nBut the -- the affirmative intent that\nCongress manifested here, notwithstanding -- I mean,\nremember, there's no express anti-waiver or anti-\nestoppel provision, but the affirmative intent is to\nprotect the public's interest in a speedy trial. And\nthat -- that intent is entirely protected when a delay\ncould be -- is permitted by the substantive standards\nof the act, and the only error is a procedural one that\nthe defendant helped to induce the court to commit.\nAnd I mentioned -- in that circumstance, there's not\nonly no delay that was not contemplated by Congress.\nBut as I mentioned before there are three\nreasons that permitting a defendant to seek dismissal\nin that circumstance would actually harm speedy trial\nrights. First, the incentive for defendants to delay.\nSecond, the inefficiency, and the third is that,\nremember, one of the main reasons, if not the main\nreason, that Congress wanted speedy trials was that it\nwas concerned that defendants out on bail were\ncommitting crimes. And Congress' concern with crime\nprevention is not served in the least by letting a\ndefendant seek dismissal of an indictment based on a\npurely procedural error that he helped to cause.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: If -- if what you say is\ntrue, I don't know why it makes any difference that the\ndefendant led the court into it. If you -- if you\nbelieve that this is just a procedural nicety that was\nnot complied with, why shouldn't you do the same thing\nwhen -- when the court fails to make the finding but\ncould have made the finding whether or not the\ndefendant was the one that led him into it?\nMR. JOSEFFER: Well, the question then would\nbe harmless error analysis. I mean, we agree the\nstatute requires the finding to be made. It was not\nmade. Therefore, there was an error. And it's the\ndefendant inducing the court to --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: It's harmless error because\nhe -- the evidence of guilt was substantial? What --\nhow does the harmless error work?\nMR. JOSEFFER: No. If -- if one moved beyond\nthe inducement and into harmless error, the question\nwould be -- would be that there here the -- the error\n-- I think as I mentioned before, the error here would\nbe the failure -- would -- would be the clerical one,\nthe error to record findings in the act.\nAnd I think -- and we would agree that the\nact -- pointing to the second question now. But the\nact does expressly say that if a defendant is not tried\nwithin 70 relevant days, the indictment shall be\ndismissed. And that suggests that harmless error\nanalysis would not be appropriate to the question\nwhether 71 or 81 days of delay is appropriate because\nCongress said 70 is 70.\nBut when the error is not that, but the error\nis failing to record something in the record, that's a\ndistinct type of error that's not covered by the\nmandatory dismissal provision. And it could be considered\nharmless, especially in circumstances where the record\nreflects --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why do you -- why do\nyou put that in a separate category? It's kind of\nunusual for Congress to put that type of a requirement\nin the statute. They could have normally -- I suspect\nthey normally would write it. You know, you -- you --\nthey're excludable only if the court finds in the\ninterest of justice. But they went further and they\nsaid if the court sets forth orally or in writing in\nthe record of the case. I mean, they set it forth as a\nseparate requirement. I don't know that we can give it\nsort of a second-class status.\nMR. JOSEFFER: Well, I -- I agree that --\nthat section (h)(8) is different from the incompetency\nexclusion, for example, which I'll turn to in a minute,\nin that it does tie the -- the findings to the\nexcludability. And that makes the -- the harmless error\nargument that we have on that issue, obviously, more\ndifficult than on the -- the incompetency issue.\nBut it's still -- I think it ultimately comes\ndown to how you -- how you view the error. Is the\nerror not trying someone within 70 days, or is the\nerror not recording a finding in the record? And if --\nif you focus on -- on the findings aspect --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Or say the error is\nnot complying with the act.\nMR. JOSEFFER: Right, and then -- but the --\nbut the -- I mean, ordinarily that -- just not\ncomplying with the act generally is harmless, and the\nquestion would be is -- is that -- because, remember,\nthe -- the only thing that's subject to mandatory\ndismissal is not trying someone within 70 relevant\ndays.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, within 70 relevant days\ncounted as the statute requires them to be counted,\nwhich includes the requirement of this finding set\nforth in the record before you can stop the clock\nrunning for -- you know, for some period. I don't\nthink that that's -- I don't think that's very\ncomplicated.\nMR. JOSEFFER: Right. And then, I mean, if\nthat's the way it's viewed, then on the first time\nperiod, the (h)(8), then we would stand on our -- stand\non either of the -- the waiver and estoppel argument or\nalso on the possibility that another middle ground\nwould be if what we're missing is a finding in the\nrecord, the other option would be to remand for the\ncourt to clarify the record.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Which court?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Oh, no, that --\npardon?\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The -- is that -- is there\nany reason to believe that the judge, of course, would\nclarify it and say the ends of justice, if we took your\nremand solution.\nMR. JOSEFFER: Right. And obviously,\nordinarily courts would not be doing that. It's a very\ninefficient thing to do in the ordinary course. But\nhere, where the transcript does reflect the court\nactually considered, on the one hand, the defendant's\nneed for additional time and, on the other hand, the\ninterest in trying -- trying criminal cases sooner\nrather than later and balanced them by granting a lesser\n--\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well --\nMR. JOSEFFER: It does seem more reasonable.\nBut --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: It seems to me that in\nthis case, that -- that all-purpose waiver that the\njudge, and not for the first time, proposed is -- is what\ncaused all this. And -- and my question that I had is\nknowing that this was the judge's practice -- and\nindeed, he had written about it -- did the U.S.\nAttorney's Office try to do something to say, look, the\nact doesn't permit that kind of thing?\nMR. JOSEFFER: At -- at the time, I mean,\nthere was -- there was -- especially this was 10 years\nago. There was, in some sense still is, quite a lot of\nconfusion in the bar on these issues because there's no\nexpress anti-waiver provision. There's an end, and as\nI said, the -- the Second Circuit in Gambino had held\nwaiver is not ordinarily appropriate, but had not said\nit was never appropriate. So there was some confusion.\nBut what -- what the Government never did was\nto encourage a waiver or to encourage any of these\ndelays either.\nNow, in this -- I blurred to some extent in the\nsecond question presented and talking about the -- the\nremand and the harmlessness.\nOn the second question presented, the first\nquestion is whether the incompetency exclusion applies\nin the first place. In our view, it's a very simple\nexclusion. If -- if delay results from the defendant's\nincompetency, the time is excluded, and if the\ndefendant is incompetent, delay results from that\nbecause a person cannot be tried when he is\nincompetent. Because we have a finding here the\ndefendant was incompetent during the relevant period of\ntime, the exclusion applies.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But it was not known at the\ntime that he was incompetent. And -- and therefore,\nthat could not have been the reason that he was not\nbeing tried. The reason he was not being tried was\nthat the -- that there was pending before the judge the\ninquiry into whether he was competent.\nMR. JOSEFFER: Well, the -- the act has a\nlengthy series of these resulting from exclusions, and\nwith the exception of (h)(8), which is unusual in terms\nof the ends of justice finding, these operate\nautomatically as this Court said in Henderson. It's --\nit's an objective standard. If -- if the defendant\ncould not have been tried then, then the delay\nresulted, at least as a concurrent cause, from that.\nAnd there's -- and it's -- it's very\nimportant to understand too that in the context of\nespecially the -- the exclusion for when pretrial\nmotions are pending, the courts of appeals have\nunanimously held that a more complicated causation\nanalysis not only is not required but would throw a\nwrench into the practical application of the act\nbecause what happens, for example, is someone files a\npretrial motion and the parties assume that the -- the\nclock is turned off then for at least some time. But a\ndefendant later argues that, well, the same delay would\nhave resulted anyway because, say, the judge was on\nvacation or the judge was planning on recusing himself\nand reassigning the case. And at that point, the\ncourts have recognized that you don't look to try to\nfigure out which of several potential causes is -- is\nthe relevant one. They're all potential objective\nconcurrent causes, and any other approach make it very\ndifficult to administer the act.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You really don't know the\nanswer of whether the clock is running until the\nfinding is made. If the -- if the judge finds that --\nthat he's not incompetent, well, too bad. You know,\nthe Speedy Trial Act requires dismissal. On the other\nhand, if the judge finds that he is incompetent to be\ntried, there hasn't been a violation of the act. I\nmean, it's a very strange situation.\nAnd it also, as -- as the -- the other side\npoints out, it -- it puts considerable pressure on the\njudge when -- when he is in violation of the Speedy Trial\nAct, to find that the individual is incompetent\nbecause, otherwise, there has to be a dismissal.\nMR. JOSEFFER: I -- I don't think it's\nappropriate to presume that an Article III judge would\nhave a defendant imprisoned and committed if he was not\nactually incompetent.\nBut you are right that the incompetency\nexclusion is -- is, along with the unavailability of\nthe defendant or witness exclusions, are somewhat\nunusual in that you could discover, after the fact,\nthat they applied. But the reason is that if -- if you\nhad tried to try him sooner, you would have discovered\nthe same thing. He actually was incompetent. The\nwitness actually was unavailable. And from a Speedy\nTrial Act perspective, it makes no sense to say the\nspeedy trial clock ran because you didn't try a\ndefendant when he was legally unable to be tried.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Are you -- are you relying\nto any extent on something that I think you brought up?\nHe also could not have been tried because the\nprosecutor was having a difficult pregnancy and she was\non extended leave, which was occurring in this period?\nMR. JOSEFFER: We haven't relied on that\nbecause that would have been the -- that -- that's an\nappropriate basis for an ends of justice continuance,\nbut no continuance was ever sought or granted for the\nrelevant period. So we -- although that is true that\nan ends of justice continuance might have been granted\nfor that reason, there was no continuance of any kind\ngranted during that period. So we're relying solely on\nthe plain language of the incompetency exclusion.\nIf you think about it --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Even if we agree with\nyou on the incompetency exclusion, we still have to\nreach the waiver for all time question. Correct? You\ndon't argue that the incompetency goes back that far,\ndo you?\nMR. JOSEFFER: No. We -- we -- no. With\nrespect to the first time period, we're relying on the\nspecific waiver that was tendered in connection with\nthat actual continuance.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You're not suggesting\nhe was incompetent during that period as well.\nMR. JOSEFFER: Oh, that defendant was\nincompetent the whole time?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes.\nMR. JOSEFFER: No. There was -- actually\nearlier on in the case, there was -- there were three\ncompetency hearings. The first one, he was held\ncompetent, and that -- that was earlier on in the\nproceedings.\nThe finding of incompetency in the record\nhere is the defendant found the defendant incompetent\nat the end of the relevant period based entirely on\nevidence and argument presented at the beginning of the\nrelevant period. So when the -- when the court held\nthat the defendant must be incompetent based on that\nevidence, he was saying the defendant -- necessarily\nwas saying the defendant must have been incompetent\nduring the entire relevant period based on the evidence\nfrom the beginning of the period.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Am -- am I correct that the\n-- the particular provision that you think is relevant\nhere is -- is (h)(1)(A) on page 4 of the -- the\nappendix in the blue brief?\nMR. JOSEFFER: No. I'm sorry. It is (h)(4).\n(h)(1)(A) deals with proceedings regarding the\ndefendant's incompetency.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I've -- I've got it. Okay.\nMR. JOSEFFER: And that applies whether the\ndefendant is competent or not. We're relying on (h)(4)\nwhich applies when the defendant was incompetent.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: What -- what do you make of\nthe language, any period of delay resulting from the\nfact that the defendant is mentally incompetent? I\nmean, the claim here is that -- that the -- that the\ndelay did not result from that fact, but simply from\nthe failure of -- of the judge to make that\ndetermination so that what you're really doing is\nmaking a harmless error analysis.\nMR. JOSEFFER: Well, I'm happy to move to\nthat as well, but before that, I mean, it is -- there\ncan be concurrent causes and there can be objective\nconcurrent causes. And the defendant could not have\nbeen tried during the relevant time period, and\ntherefore, objectively speaking, that was -- I mean, if\nthe -- if the court had tried to try him --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay, but isn't that a --\nMR. JOSEFFER: -- during the relevant time\nperiod, he couldn't.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- isn't that a harmless\nerror analysis rather than a -- a subsection (4)\nanalysis?\nMR. JOSEFFER: Well, I think Congress --\nyou're right that it's based in part on the principle\nthat, look, of course, he couldn't have been tried\nthen. But, no, Congress also made that relevant\nwhether there's a violation at all. Just to simplify\nthings, let's take that off the table. If the\ndefendant is incompetent, there certainly couldn't be a\nconstitutional Speedy Trial violation. Let's just\ntake it off the table for -- for the act purposes as\nwell. The argument has been made that --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But -- but I guess my only\npoint is that (4) does not say any period during which\nthe defendant is mentally incompetent. It says any\nperiod of delay resulting from the fact that he was\nmentally incompetent, and this did not result from that\nfact until at the end of the period the judge says, oh,\nI find him incompetent, so that any period after that\nwould be the result of the fact that he was\nincompetent. But the -- the delay up to that point was\nattributable solely to the judge's failure to make a\ndetermination.\nMR. JOSEFFER: If I could answer the\nquestion.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If it was a question,\nyes.\nMR. JOSEFFER: The -- the fact --\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SOUTER: It was -- it was cleverly\ndisguised, but it really was a question.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. JOSEFFER: I -- I -- I'll try to give a\ncleverly disguised answer.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Isn't -- isn't that so?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. JOSEFFER: The -- the fact existed all\nalong. I mean, the -- the fact doesn't come into\nexistence once it's found. The finding reflects the\nfact that the fact of an incompetency had existed\nduring the entire relevant period.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Zas, you have 4 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF EDWARD S. ZAS\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. ZAS: Mr. Chief Justice, I'd like to pick\nup on questions that both you and Justice Scalia asked\nregarding the -- the language of the statute.\nOne of the Court's bedrock principles is that\njudges are not free to rewrite the statute that\nCongress has enacted. This statute and the whole\nstatutory scheme here speaks very clearly and very\nprecisely, and it would be unwise, even if permitted,\nfor the Court to start tinkering with it because the\nwhole system will start to unravel if the -- if the\nrequirement of express findings and reasons turns into\na could have/would have/should have contest, in which\ncase trial judges will take the act less seriously\nknowing that the court of appeals could make the\nfindings for them. And it will make the court of\nappeals' job harder because they'll be guessing after\nthe fact what discretionary decision the trial judge\nwould have made.\nThis statute -- the ends of justice provision\nis very clear. The Government has cited no ambiguity,\nand it controls. Because the findings were not made,\nwhether they could have been made or should have been\nmade or would have been made, they weren't made, and\ntherefore, the time ran and dismissal is required.\nNow, the Government proceeds under the false\nassumption that but for the waiver, the judge would\nhave granted this continuance on January 31, 1997.\nThere's absolutely no support for that in the record.\nEven before this occasion, on November 8th, 1996, which\nwas the prior court appearance, the court said you're\nnot getting another adjournment unless you waive for\nall time. So there's no reason to think that at this\nlater date the court was about to say, well, forget the\nwaiver, okay, I'll give you 3 months. It's -- it's the\nwaiver that is providing the basis for the exclusion.\nThe judge, if pushed, would have said, no, we're going\nto trial soon. No waiver, no more time. So it's a\nfalse assumption.\nI'd like to turn to the second period again.\nThe Government again assumes that when the judge found\nMr. Zedner incompetent in March of 2001, that that is a\nretroactive determination that he was incompetent from\nJuly, August, September, October, November, et cetera.\nAnd as the Court is aware --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It goes back some way\nbecause he's looking at reports from those earlier\ntimes. It's not only effective as of the date he makes\nthe finding.\nMR. ZAS: Well, the -- the finding is\neffective from that point forward. That has to be the\ncase because, as Justice Scalia pointed out, it's\nimportant for the parties to know, as matters are\nunfolding, what the speedy trial clock is. That way\nthe Government knows to push the cases that are\napproaching the 70-day limit to trial. People can't\nknow that answer if everyone is waiting to find out\nwhat the outcome of a pending motion is. And the\ndefendant, in fact, couldn't move for dismissal under\nthe act until the -- the judge said after 1 or 2 years,\nI find the defendant incompetent.\nJUSTICE ALITO: What do you mean --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I guess you can be -- I'm\nsorry, go ahead.\nJUSTICE ALITO: If the judge, when he finally\nfound the defendant competent, had said expressly, and\nI -- I made this determination in my mind shortly after\nthe hearing and the -- the briefs that were submitted\nat that time, but now I'm putting it on the record,\nthat wouldn't be sufficient?\nMR. ZAS: No, Your Honor. If the judge had\nsaid, I knew this all along back when I heard the\nevidence that this defendant was incompetent, that\nwould be an even more egregious violation. The court\nis not supposed to sit and just let the defendant sit\nout on the streets for month after month after month\nwhen -- when the defendant is incompetent. The court\nis supposed to make a -- a prompt finding.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Where does the act say that,\nthat there has to be a finding at the time?\nMR. ZAS: Well, the court said -- the act\nsays it in -- in section (h)(1)(J). That's the -- the\n-- in the appendix to the blue brief on page 5. The\nact excludes time while the proceeding is -- is going\non for examinations and hearings, et cetera, but at the\nend, it excludes only delay reasonably attributable to\nany period not to exceed 30 days during which any\nproceeding concerning the defendant is actually under\nadvisement by the court. So -- so if the --\nJUSTICE ALITO: No. But there's no\nprovision, is there, that says that the finding under\n(b)(4), that there has to even be a finding under\n(b)(4), much less when the finding has to be made?\nMR. ZAS: If I may answer the question, Your\nHonor.\nWell, the only finding that the court has to\nmake under (b)(4) is that the defendant is incompetent.\nThat automatically will exclude the time going forward\nuntil the defendant is restored to competency.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
