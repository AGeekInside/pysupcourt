PHILLIPS: Thank you, Justice Stevens, and\nmay it please the Court:\nAt issue in this case is the safety of police\nofficers when they attempt to execute a search warrant in\nan inherently unsafe situation.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: May I ask one preliminary\nquestion, Mr. Phillips? Do we have before us here any\nquestion at all about qualified immunity?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, we do believe that a\nqualified immunity issue is bound up with the underlying\nmerits. It was addressed that way by the Ninth Circuit\nbecause --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: But it wasn't -- it wasn't in\nthe questions --\nMR. PHILLIPS: This Court --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- on which we granted cert?\nMR. PHILLIPS: This Court in Procunier treated\nthe qualified immunity issue as part and parcel of the\nunderlying merits of the case and -- and, in fact, skipped\nover the question of what 1983 meant in order to address\nthe qualified immunity issue. And presumably --\nJUSTICE BREYER: How -- how --\nMR. PHILLIPS: -- the Court could do the same\nthing here.\nJUSTICE BREYER: How do we do it? It goes right\nto the heart of this from you, the qualified immunity\nthing, for the reason that if you look at the facts and\ncircumstances, it sounds to me like a somewhat close\nquestion as to whether the police did or did not exceed\nthe reasonable bounds -- reasonable bounds.\nNow, if it's a close question, you have a jury\nverdict against you, and -- and then I think, well, yes,\nbut I begin to come -- become disturbed if I think of\nqualified immunity. I mean, it isn't that clear. So --\nso having read through the thing, I -- I preliminarily\nstart by thinking, well, it could have been excessive\nforce, I mean, given -- you know, I'm using that in\nquotes.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: The jury said it was. Who am I\nto say it wasn't --\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, I mean, this -- this --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- in that situation? But\nqualified immunity. So now, what do I do?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, in the first instance, it's\nreasonably clear to me that you're not bound by the jury's\ndetermination here. This Court has already --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: We -- don't we have to give\nany weight at all to the jury finding there or --\nMR. PHILLIPS: With respect to the historical\nfacts of the case, who did what to whom, of course, you\nhave -- that -- that's subject to clearly erroneous\nreview. On the issue of whether or not the conduct at\nissue here is reasonable, that's an issue of law or at\nleast a mixed issue of fact --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, a lot of it may depend on\nthe --\nMR. PHILLIPS: -- and law that this Court has\ndecided as de novo.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- on the music as to\nhandcuffing and what did they say and what was the\natmosphere and what was the garage really like and how\nrisky was it that there be gang members in the outhouses\nand -- and all kinds of stuff that you might sense from\nthe testimony.\nMR. PHILLIPS: It -- it seems to me that --\nJustice Breyer, that the answer to all of those questions\ngo to the core of what it means to exercise unquestioned\ncommand of the situation, which is a pure legal standard\nthat this Court adopted a quarter of a century ago in\nMichigan v. Summers. And that's a question of law.\nTo be sure, there are lots of elements of it,\nbut what my position would be -- and obviously the\nofficers' position in this case -- is that in exercising\nunquestioned command, you can accept all of the facts as\nyou've just described them and none of that is excessive\nbecause it doesn't expose anyone to anything other than\nwhat is necessary in order to achieve complete control\nunder the circumstances in order to ensure the protection\nof the individual officers and -- and candidly of the\nother individuals who were being -- being detained, all\nfour of them, under these circumstances.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Have you responded to my\ninitial question? Have you said all you want to say about\nqualified immunity?\nMR. PHILLIPS: No, Justice O'Connor. My -- my\nbasic answer to that is that this Court already addressed\nthat issue in Procunier. It considered that the qualified\nimmunity issue was part and parcel of the issue, even\nthough it hadn't been presented in the question presented,\nand indeed, I think in this case it's actually a -- a\nstronger argument that qualified immunity is in this case\nbecause that is the way that the Ninth Circuit\nspecifically addressed the issue. It looked at under\nSaucier. It evaluated whether or not qualified immunity\nwas appropriate and -- and did the two-part test, the\nfirst part being whether it was a constitutional violation\nand the second part whether or not it was reasonable under\nthese particular circumstances.\nSo if I -- if I cannot persuade you that this is\nconstitutional, which obviously I -- I hope I can do, it\nseems to me absolutely unquestioned that there -- that\nwhat the officers did here under these circumstances were\nperfectly reasonable.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, what is the -- what is\nthe function of a jury in this case? What does the jury\nverdict stand for? And the jury doesn't return a special\nverdict and says we find X, Y, and Z. It finds whether\nthe police exercised excessive force, and that's all we\nknow from the jury verdict.\nOther -- I think what you're saying is that\nthese cases should go off on summary judgment or even a\ndemurrer. You assume all the facts as the plaintiff\nalleges them and then the Court decides whether that adds\nup to unreasonable within the meaning of the Fourth\nAmendment.\nMR. PHILLIPS: I -- I'm not saying that that\nwould be true in all cases. I do think in this particular\ncase you did not need to have a jury verdict. We would\nhave been prepared to stipulate to the facts as they were\nfound ultimately and -- and giving the benefit of all of\nthe inferences to the --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: We don't know the fact --\nwhat facts were found because all we have is in the jury\nverdict that this was excessive force. Period. That's\nall.\nMR. PHILLIPS: But that's just a conclusion of\nlaw, Justice Ginsburg. So the -- the facts that you know\nare the facts as they're described --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But it's like was --\nMR. PHILLIPS: -- by the respondent's brief.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- the defendant negligent.\nIs that more or less a conclusion of law? We don't know\nin what respect from the jury verdict. And here, were\nthese police officers acting -- did they use excessive\nforce.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, we know precisely what they\ndid. They kept her in handcuffs throughout the duration\nof the -- of the search. We know that. There's no --\nthere are no additional claims as to having mistreated her\nphysically.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Wasn't there a fact issue as\nto whether she was handcuffed for -- even for a short\nperiod after the search had been completed?\nMR. PHILLIPS: I don't think there is a factual\nquestion like that because I don't think that question was\npresented to the jury, and it was certainly not the basis\non which the Ninth Circuit affirmed the jury's verdict in\nthis case. There -- there was never an argument made to\nthe jury that this -- that this extended beyond the -- the\nperiod of the end of the search. The argument that was\nmade to the jury was that the search should have -- should\nhave been limited to the room where the suspect was -- was\na resident or that the police should have made a decision\nsomewhere in the -- before the end of the 2-hour search\nthat she was no longer a threat to them. And then they\nwere arguing that -- that it even went a little further in\nterms of the timing of it. But they never asked the jury\nto find that that 15 minutes was the basis for a Fourth\nAmendment violation in its own right.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But if -- but if it made a\ndifference as a matter of law, what -- what should we\nassume about that extra 15 minutes? Do we assume that\nthey found the facts in the way that the -- a plaintiff\nargues them or that you think they are?\nMR. PHILLIPS: I think if the jury had been\nasked to make that finding, that you -- and -- and the\njury determined that there -- that it was unreasonable,\nthen I think you'd have to conclude that the 15 minutes\nwere, in fact -- that it did, in fact, go beyond 15\nminutes. I do think there is still a legal issue as to\nwhether that's de minimis under the circumstances.\nBut -- but I agree. I mean, obviously there is\na role for the jury's findings, and you have to give them\na certain amount of respect. But on the core questions of\nreasonableness and suspicion and whether or not the police\nexercised unquestioned command and what those terms mean,\nthis Court has already decided that in the Fourth\nAmendment context it has to decide those issues as a\nmatter of law to regulate the conduct of all police\nofficers and not simply do it on the basis of whatever a\nparticular jury would say in a particular circumstance.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Now, in doing it as a matter of\nlaw here, should we give consideration to the fact that in\nthis case, if -- if I remember correctly, one of the\nofficers testified that had they followed normal protocol,\nonce they had, I think his phrase was, secured the\nbuilding, the -- the main building --\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, the -- all of the grounds\nactually.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Is that the whole compound?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: That -- that they would have --\nthey would have taken off the immediate restraints, and he\nwasn't sure why they didn't. We -- do we -- do we\nconsider that when we're crafting our statement of law as\n-- as to what is or is not excessive?\nMR. PHILLIPS: I think if this Court could\ndetermine that, as a matter of course, the -- the standard\noperating procedures in a particular way, that might\ncertainly inform the Court's Fourth Amendment analysis.\nThat -- I think what's important to keep in mind in this\ncontext, though, Justice Souter, is we're talking about\nfour individuals who are being detained under these\ncircumstances, and each of them poses a distinct issue for\nthe police officers under the -- under -- when trying to\ndecide how best to proceed. One of them had been found\nwith marijuana in his possession. One of them had been\ndetermined to be an illegal alien, and the other two were\nindividuals about whom the police knew virtually nothing.\nSo, you know, is it possible that police\nprocedure, generally speaking, when you're talking about a\nsingle occupant of the residence, oftentimes concludes\nthat he can take away -- you can remove the handcuffs?\nThat may be, although I don't think there's much in the\nrecord here to -- to reflect that.\nBut what the police said here -- and I think\nit's extraordinarily important. Officer Muehler testified\nthat if something had gone wrong, if either a police\nofficer had been injured or one of the occupants of that\nhouse had been shot or otherwise harmed as a -- in the\ncontext of executing the search warrant, the first\nquestion that would have been asked is what was the least\nthat could have been done to prevent those injuries from\noccurring. And he said to himself and he said it quite\nrightly -- and it's a rule this Court ought to embrace\nunder the unquestioned command theory of -- of law -- is\nthat if we keep them in handcuffs through the duration of\na reasonable search, we will make our way through the\nsearch much more rapidly, much more efficiently in order\nto minimize the detention and we will eliminate -- and I\nmean, literally eliminate -- the entirety of the risk\neither to the individuals themselves, the occupants, the\ndetainees, or to the police under these circumstances.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. I take it you obviously\ndon't want us to -- to come down with a kind of a finicky\nversion of -- of excessive force as the touchstone, and I\ntake it you don't want us to come down with simply a\nblanket rule saying that essentially the police can do\nanything in -- in restraining occupants so long as it is\nnot wantonly cruel. Somewhere in between. Do you have a\n-- a statement that would be the kernel of the holding\nthat you want?\nMR. PHILLIPS: I'm -- I'm quite comfortable with\nthe way the Court analyzed it in Michigan v. Summers, that\nthe officer is not required to evaluate the extent of the\nintrusion to be imposed by the seizure. That is, you --\nyou have a categorical rule that allows you, in the\nordinary course, to do whatever is reasonably necessary in\norder to --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But in the facts there, there\nwere no handcuffs. He -- he was just detained. So --\nMR. PHILLIPS: I understand that, and -- but my\n-- my position is that handcuffs don't materially affect\nthe detention under these circumstances other than to\nassure what the Court said, which is unquestioned command\nof the situation.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So -- I mean, I don't -- would\n-- would you say handcuffs are per se lawful for -- for\npurposes of applying Summers?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Yes, but it's important to put\nthat in context because Summers is a narrow exception to\nthe -- not an exception. It's a narrow circumstance under\nthe Fourth Amendment. You have to have a search warrant.\nIt has to be a validly issued search warrant so that we\nknow that there has either been a crime that's likely to\nbe taking place in the premises. It only -- it only\nextends to the residents, occupants of the house, and it's\nonly when the search is for contraband, not just for any\nevidence. So, for instance, when the police go the 60th\ntime to Michael Jackson's estate to go try to find\nevidence of whatever is going on there, I don't think it's\nreasonable to go in and handcuff Michael Jackson and\nanybody else who happens to be on site.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it doesn't -- why is\ncontraband magical? Wouldn't -- wouldn't your point be\nwhen -- when the reason they're investigating gives cause\nto believe that there may be physical danger --\nMR. PHILLIPS: Justice Scalia --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- from letting people wander\naround?\nMR. PHILLIPS: -- absolutely.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Which is the case with\ncontraband, but would be the case for many other reasons\nas well.\nMR. PHILLIPS: I think the important point here\nis that we're talking about guns. These are gangs. These\nare guns. This is a circumstance that is inherently more\ndangerous than any other circumstance the police are\nlikely to confront.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But would you be happy then\nwith a holding that says just what you said? We reaffirm\nSummers and -- but Summers said special circumstances or\npossibly a prolonged detention might lead to a different\nconclusion in an unusual case.\nAnd the only verdict part that I think we're\nconcerned with here -- it was not about four people. It\nwas one person, Iris Mena, and in respect to Iris Mena,\nthe jury found that there was a violation of her -- of her\nFourth Amendment rights. And as to her, you could have\nfound -- you said -- I don't know if you misspoke. You\nsaid it could be more than 15 minutes. In looking at it,\nI was certain whether they kept her for 15 minutes more or\nmore than 15 minutes more, maybe up to an hour more beyond\nthe time that the search ended and kept her in handcuffs,\nboth after the time they had secured the place and also\nafter the time the search ended. Well, that would seem a\nbasis for the jury's verdict and consistent with Summers.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, it -- it could have been a\nbasis for the jury's verdict if they had, in fact, put the\nissue of whether or not they were detained --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But, Mr. -- Mr. -- but may I\npoint out that the judge's instructions did put that issue\nto the jury at page 203. A police officer is required to\nrelease an individual detained in connection with a lawful\nsearch as soon as the officer's right to conduct the\nsearch ends or the search itself is concluded, whichever\nis sooner.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right. That -- I understand\nthat, Justice Stevens, but the point we made in our reply\nbrief is there's not a shred of evidence in this record\nand it was never argued to the jury that this search --\nthat -- that her detention lasted beyond the period of the\nsearch in this case. Indeed, counsel for the police\nofficers specifically said in his closing argument, there\nis no issue but that she was released at the time of the\n-- that when -- as soon as the search was -- was ended,\nthe -- the warrant was executed.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I wonder why the judge gave\nthis instruction then.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Because -- because what he's --\nwell, you know, it's a reasonable instruction.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And why -- why there was --\nthere was a special verdict of sorts, not a detailed one.\nBut the two questions, question 5 and question 6, on page\n255 of the joint appendix --\nMR. PHILLIPS: Yes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: One question concerns whether\nthe force was excessive, and the other one is, do you find\nthat she was detained for a longer period than reasonable?\nThose two questions -- my first is a procedural\nquestion. Did counsel for the defendants object to the\njury getting -- those two questions being submitted to the\njury?\nMR. PHILLIPS: No, Justice Ginsburg. We didn't.\nAnd -- and --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, it seems to me that the\njudge is asking the jury in these questions, one is\nwhether there was a -- a detention, was force greater than\nwas reasonable under the circumstances, and whether the\nduration was longer than reasonable under the\ncircumstances.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right. Justice Ginsburg, you\nhave to put that in context. The argument of the\nplaintiff in this case was that the detention should have\nended at either of two points: after they had completely\ncleared the area and made it safe, or alternatively, at\nsome point after that when they had asked her questions\nand determined that she had no particular involvement with\nMr. Romero. Their argument was anything after that was\nunreasonable, and that's what the jury certainly found,\nwas that that was the reasonable break point.\nOur argument is that's not consistent with the\nnotion of unquestioned command and -- and is wrong as a\nmatter of law. And there is no evidence -- no evidence.\nThere was no testimony that she was kept for a period\nbeyond the execution of that search warrant. It's very\nimportant to understand that.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And you're saying that the --\nthe mere fact that it -- it went to the jury, even went to\nthe jury without your objecting to it, does not mean we\nhave to listen to what the jury said. Is that -- is\nthat --\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right. If it's wrong as a matter\nof law, that's -- then that's absolutely right. But there\nwas no evidence in this case that they kept going. The\nonly thing he said was, he -- he didn't remember. That\nwas -- the question was put to the police officer. Was\nshe kept beyond there? He said he didn't remember. He\nwasn't even the police officer who was involved in it.\nThere's not a shred of evidence of that. It's totally\nmade up. It wasn't their theory of the case in front of\nthe jury.\nI'd like to reserve the balance of my time.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: You might save your time.\nYes.\nMr. Shanmugam.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF KANNON K. SHANMUGAM\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,\nAS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS\nMR. SHANMUGAM: Thank you, Justice Stevens, and\nmay it please the Court:\nWhen executing a search warrant to investigate a\nviolent crime, officers may routinely use reasonable\nrestraints on detained occupants in order to exercise\nunquestioned command over the situation and to facilitate\nthe orderly completion of the search.\nThe Ninth Circuit erred in holding that the\nofficers' use of handcuffs in this case violated the\nFourth Amendment.\nUnder the standard for excessive force claims\nfirst articulated by this Court in Graham v. Connor, as\ninformed by this Court's decision in Michigan v. Summers,\nthe degree of force used here was not excessive. The same\nconsiderations that justified the detention of the\noccupants in Summers, most notably, the paramount concern\nof ensuring the safety of the officers and the occupants\nthemselves, will ordinarily justify the precautionary use\nof handcuffs during the detention.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Then this case should not\nhave gone to the jury on the basis of what you said --\nMR. SHANMUGAM: We --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- because you -- you just\nsaid that this -- the handcuffs -- the circumstances --\nthe circumstances here were reasonable as a matter of law.\nMR. SHANMUGAM: Justice Ginsburg, that's\ncorrect. It is our view that as a matter of law, the\nofficers would have been entitled to prevail on the\nconstitutional issue with regard to excessive force. And\nit's worth noting, I think, that the officers did move for\nsummary judgment. They also orally moved for judgment as\na matter of law at the close of the evidence, and that\nmotion was denied.\nNow, we also believe that the jury, quite\nfrankly, was given insufficient guidance on the excessive\nforce issue, and to turn to the jury instruction cited by\nJustice Stevens at page 203, it's quite clear that the\njury only received one very general instruction on Summers\ndetentions.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well -- well, has the -- the\nobjection to the instruction been preserved here?\nMR. SHANMUGAM: Perhaps an argument could be\nmade that it's fairly included within the questions\npresented. There was an objection made at trial and an\nobjection made before the Ninth Circuit as well, but our\nfundamental position is that the jury was simply given\ninsufficient guidance on the excessive force issue. This\ninstruction --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But on the -- on the question\nwhether they preserved the issue, I -- I took it, implicit\nin what you said a minute ago, that yes, they did not\nobject to the submission of the question. They did not\nobject, in effect, to an instruction or giving of an\ninstruction as such.\nMR. SHANMUGAM: That's correct.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But they -- they had moved for\njudgment as a matter of law at the close of all the\nevidence, and that's enough to preserve the issue?\nMR. SHANMUGAM: I think that's true. It is true\nthat they didn't object to the specific special verdict\nset of questions. I think they proposed slightly\ndifferent language. But ultimately I think our primary\nsubmission is that as a matter of law on these facts, no\nconstitutional violation occurred.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: When you -- is your objection\nthat the jury wasn't given enough guidance on excessive\nforce, or is it that the -- that the ultimate issue of\nexcessive force is not a jury issue?\nMR. SHANMUGAM: We would concede, I think,\nJustice Scalia, that the issue should go to the jury where\nthere are disputed issues of historical fact. We would\nsubmit that there are no relevant --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, but is -- is excessive\nforce an issue of historical fact any more than -- than\nunreasonable search or unreasonable seizure is an issue of\nhistorical fact?\nMR. SHANMUGAM: Well, there are certain --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's historical fact how long\nyou held the person, whether the person was in handcuffs,\nbut the ultimate question was, you know, is this force\nexcessive. Is that any different from the question as --\nof was this seizure unreasonable? If you submit the one\nto the jury, you may as well submit the other.\nMR. SHANMUGAM: Justice Scalia, those facts may\nbe disputed in a particular case. We would submit that\nthey really weren't disputed here, but there may actually\nbe a dispute where the officers would say, yes, we used\nhandcuffs and the --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So when --\nMR. SHANMUGAM: -- or no we didn't use\nhandcuffs.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- when you know all those\nfacts, you're willing to send it to the jury to say, given\nall of these facts, it's up to you to decide whether\nunreasonable force was used or not.\nMR. SHANMUGAM: We believe that it is --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's not a matter of law.\nMR. SHANMUGAM: -- a mixed question of fact and\nlaw, and once the historical facts are established, it is\nessentially --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why -- why any more so -- why\nany -- any more so than -- than whether it's an\nunreasonable seizure?\nMR. SHANMUGAM: Well, we would submit that it is\nno different from the question whether officers had\nprobable cause or reasonable suspicion on any given set of\nhistorical facts which this Court held in Ornelas was a\nquestion subject to de novo review, over your dissent,\nadmittedly. And we believe that the primary rationale for\nthe rule in Ornelas also applies here, namely that\nofficers do need to have a consistent set of substantive\nguidelines by which they can judge the validity of their\nconduct.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Are -- are you saying that the\nonly basis on -- on which the jury could have ruled for\nthe homeowner here, the -- the respondent, is that she was\nhandcuffed for too long?\nMR. SHANMUGAM: We believe that that certainly\nis the primary issue that was at stake. And in fact --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I think you have to say\nthat. Otherwise, we have to uphold the jury verdict, if\nwe can assume that the jury might have thought, well, you\nknow, the handcuffs -- the police had a right to do that,\nbut she was held too long, she was -- they -- they yelled\nat her, she was taken into a -- a place that was\nuncomfortable. If -- if that's true, then we have to\nsustain the jury verdict.\nMR. SHANMUGAM: I think that the handcuffing was\nthe key factor at trial, and I think that the best\nevidence of that, quite frankly, is that respondent in her\nproposed instructions referred only to handcuffing in her\nexcessive force instruction. Unfortunately, that's not\npart of the joint appendix. It is part of the record.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: No, no. But the instruction\nthat was given -- and one was read that's in the briefs --\nit seems to me a -- a perfectly good instruction.\nMR. SHANMUGAM: I think that that's true, but I\nthink that the instruction didn't really provide any\nguidance on excessive force specifically. It was really\nan instruction with regard to the reasonableness of the\ndetention more generally, rather than with regard to\nexcessive force specifically. It was not a Graham v.\nConnor type instruction.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, then it seems to me it\nwas the plaintiff's obligation to submit a clarifying\ninstruction and to bring this -- the denial of that\ninstruction here.\nMR. SHANMUGAM: Well, there were objections to\nthe instruction below, and all I can say is that perhaps\nan argument could be made -- and perhaps Mr. Phillips will\nmake the argument on rebuttal -- that it is fairly\nincluded within the questions presented.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I don't know how you can --\nyou can say that the only thing that was before the jury\nwas the handcuff when the -- there was evidence that she\nwas treated very roughly in -- in the first instance, she\nwas woken from her sleep, she wasn't told that they were\npolice, she thought they were robbers, and she feared for\nher life. That doesn't drop out of the case and what the\njury was asked to determine.\nMR. SHANMUGAM: Justice Ginsburg, it was the\nprimary issue before the jury, and to be sure, there were\nother issues. I think that the other relevant use of\nforce was the initial detention at gunpoint, but -- and\nthose -- and I would add that those are the two factors on\nwhich the Ninth Circuit relied in affirming the jury's\nverdict. Our submission is that both with regard to the\ninitial use of force and with regard to the continued use\nof force, the justifications of Graham v. Connor support\nthe officers' use of force in both instances.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But -- but may I just ask a\nsort of very basic question? One of the instructions\nreads, a detention may be unreasonable if it -- if it is\nunnecessarily painful, degrading, prolonged, or if it\ninvolves an undue invasion of privacy. Now, are you\ntelling us that you think the answer to that question is a\nquestion of law that the judge should provide rather than\nthe jury?\nMR. SHANMUGAM: Assuming that that instruction\nis correct -- and that might very well be a valid\ninstruction --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, it was correct.\nMR. SHANMUGAM: It may very well be a correct\ninstruction --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: All right.\nMR. SHANMUGAM: -- with regard to a challenge to\nthe manner of the detention itself. In that instance,\nthen the jury does have a certain amount of leeway, but I\nthink even then the teaching of Ornelas --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Then it's not a question of\nlaw. The answer to whether it was unnecessarily painful,\ndegrading, prolonged, or involved undue invasion of\nprivacy, is that a question of law or a question of fact\nto the jury?\nMR. SHANMUGAM: It is a mixed question of law\nand fact, and the jury's job is --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: It's a mixed question?\nMR. SHANMUGAM: The jury's job is to -- to\nresolve the underlying factual issues and then --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, I understand the\nhistorical fact, but I'm -- I'm questioning you about the\nconclusions that you draw from the unreasonableness,\ndegrading, and so forth. Is that partly to be decided by\nthe jury or entirely by the judge?\nMR. SHANMUGAM: We believe that that actually is\nultimately a judge issue in the same way that the issue of\nwhether or not probable --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: So this instruction should not\nhave been given.\nMR. SHANMUGAM: That's correct --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I thought your position was\nthat it -- it may be submitted to the jury, but that it\nmay be reviewed as a question of law simply because that's\nthe way we are able to set standards for later cases.\nMR. SHANMUGAM: I think that's exactly right,\nand I think that that is the teaching of Ornelas. And it\nmay very well be that a more specific instruction should\nhave been given so as to make clear that the jury had\nspecific issues of historical fact to resolve. But\nultimately we do believe that it's a question of law in\nthe sense that it should be reviewed de novo for precisely\nthe reasons given in Ornelas.\nAnd if I could just say a couple words on the\nsubstantive issue of excessive force. We believe that in\ncases involving violent crimes, officers should routinely\nbe allowed to use handcuffs. In this case, I would just\nadd that there were several additional case-specific\nfactors that justified the use of handcuffs. In addition\nto the fact that this was a violent crime, the officers\nhad reason to believe that at least one and possibly two\nmembers of a violent gang were living at the house. In\naddition, the officers had previously visited the house on\ntwo occasions to investigate other violent crimes and had\nencountered resistance on at least one of those occasions.\nAnd our fundamental problem with the Ninth\nCircuit's rule is that it seems to suggest that officers\nin the course of a detention should really stop and\ninvestigate whether or not each -- each individual that\nthey encounter poses a safety threat. And we believe that\nthat rule is as unworkable as it is unwise. It would\neffectively divert officers from the primary task at hand\nand could perversely have the effect of prolonging rather\nthan expediting the completion of the search. And for\nthat reason, we believe that the Ninth Circuit's rule, its\nsubstantive constitutional rule, was erroneous.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: How long did it take them to\nfind out whether the -- these other dangerous people were\nthere?\nMR. SHANMUGAM: To find out whether?\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Whether the people they were\nafraid of were -- were on the premises?\nMR. SHANMUGAM: Well, you know, I don't know\nthat they ever actually made a -- a determination other\nthan that Mr. Romero was not on the premises. I think\nthey figured that out once they had actually identified\neach of the individuals, which was fairly early on in the\ndetention.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you.\nMr. Hoffman.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL L. HOFFMAN\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. HOFFMAN: Justice Stevens, and may it please\nthe Court:\nLet me start on the issue of -- that Mr.\nPhillips said we made up. Actually we didn't make it up.\nThe claim that Ms. Mena was detained past the time of the\nsearch was made throughout the case. If you look at\nfootnote 3 in the Ninth Circuit opinion in 2000, the issue\nof the length of the detention was a factual issue that\nprecluded summary judgment. Ms. Mena claimed that the\ndetention lasted for 2 to 3 hours. The officers claimed\nthat it lasted 90 minutes.\nBut more than that, the -- the jury -- the --\nthe special verdict asked the jury to find whether Ms.\nMena had been kept for a longer time than reasonable, and\nin fact, in the closing argument, it was argued that Ms.\nMena had been kept beyond the time that the search ended.\nAnd not only is there not any -- not only is\nthere evidence in the record, there is overwhelming\nevidence in the record that Ms. Mena was kept for a period\nof time, at least 30 minutes, give or take, and possibly\nas long as an hour. And this is not based on Ms. Mena's\ntestimony.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Do you find that the -- that\nthe -- do you define the end of the search as before they\nstarted videotaping everything they had done?\nMR. HOFFMAN: Well, they were videotaping during\nthe course of the search. But if I can go through the\nfacts which might clarify things.\nOfficer Muehler, who was the officer in overall\ncharge of the -- of the search, testified at trial that\nthe search ended at 8:40 a.m. Officer Brill said a little\nbit later than that. He tied -- but there's a second\nvideo. There are two videos. The second video is from\n8:50 to 8:57. At the time that the second -- the second\nvideo started at 8:50, Officer Brill testified that the\nsearch was over. The -- the evidence log -- the last\nentry on the evidence log is 8:45 in terms of evidence\nbeing logged into the -- into the case.\nOfficer Brill testified that Ms. Mena was kept\nfor at least 10 or 15 minutes after the end of the second\nvideo and her handcuffs were not released until she was\nbrought back around from the -- the separate converted\ngarage back into the house and --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Where -- where is that\ntestimony?\nMR. HOFFMAN: The testimony -- Officer Brill's\ntestimony? Is actually -- they cite joint appendix number\n-- on 75 where he says he doesn't recall. On the next\npage, in joint appendix number 76, he's asked -- they\ncontinue to ask the question. And isn't it your memory\nthat about 10 or 15 minutes after that, Iris Mena was\nreleased? That would sound consistent. And that's 10 or\n15 minutes after 8:57.\nIn addition, Ms. Mena testified that she was\nkept between 2 or 3 hours, and that was actually\nconsistent with prior testimony by the videographer\nherself, who testified in deposition and was impeached at\ntrial, that it was 2 or 3 hours that the search lasted.\nThe -- the point being -- and if you take the\ndistance between Officer Muehler's testimony and Officer\nBrill's testimony, Ms. Mena was -- was kept in handcuffs\nat the end of a very long detention in handcuffs, for a\nperiod of approximately 27 to 33 minutes, if you don't\neven take Ms. Mena's testimony into account.\nAnd one of the ironies of the case is that\nthere's testimony that Mr. Romero, the actual target of\nthe case, was released at 8:45 at the time the search\nended. And so while this --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But not from these premises.\nMR. HOFFMAN: No. But in fact, this was a --\nthe search warrant was for two premises. He was picked up\nat his mother's house. And in fact, Officer Muehler had\n-- was -- was to radio the start of both searches, and so\nthere was --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But the -- the -- I thought\nthat this poorhouse, or whatever it was called -- that the\nwarrant covered weapons that were there.\nMR. HOFFMAN: Yes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: That they were looking for\nweapons.\nMR. HOFFMAN: They were looking for a gun.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: They were not looking for a\ngun at Romero's mother's house, were they?\nMR. HOFFMAN: Well, I think the --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Did they have a warrant, a\nsearch warrant?\nMR. HOFFMAN: I think the warrant covered -- I\nthink they were looking for the gun wherever it was found,\nand -- and the -- I believe the warrant --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, this was a -- this was\na pretty extensive search warrant that they had.\nMR. HOFFMAN: Yes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Did they have something like\nthat, the same kind of warrant for the --\nMR. HOFFMAN: Well, it's the same warrant I\nbelieve, Your Honor, in terms of -- we don't have --\nthere's not a lot of information in the record about --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, wasn't -- I thought\nthat this warrant referred to a particular address, a\nparticular house, not -- not any house where one might\nfind Romero.\nMR. HOFFMAN: No, no, no. It -- it referred to\nthe two houses, one on Cimmaron.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, was the other house his\nmother's house?\nMR. HOFFMAN: Yes. The location number one is\nhis mother's house, 2646 Cimmaron, and that's -- and\nOfficer Muehler and this team was in charge of both of\nthese searches pursuant to the same warrant. They had\ninformation that -- the reason they did that is that they\nhad information that -- that he lived in this poorhouse,\nthat he rented a room from the Menas at the poorhouse, and\nthat he also visited his -- his mother from time to time.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Then that would make it even\nmore curious if the place where the dangerous man was\nwasn't searched extensively and -- and the mother --\nnobody was put in handcuffs, and yet for this -- they knew\npretty soon that Romero wasn't on the premises.\nMR. HOFFMAN: Well, they knew right away.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes. And that's, I guess,\nyour -- your point, that the place where the dangerous man\nwas is not --\nMR. HOFFMAN: I think that that explains one of\nthe reasons why the jury imposed punitive damages here\nbecause they -- they knew that at 8:45, at the time that\nOfficer Muehler said that the search was over and all the\nofficers were out of the house and -- and everything was\ndone, that Mr. Romero was cited and released for marijuana\npossession. And at the same time, from 8:45 until\nsometime after 9 o'clock, probably as long as 30, maybe\nlonger, Iris Mena was sitting in a cold, damp, converted\ngarage with her hands behind her back.\nJUSTICE BREYER: You might be able to keep your\nverdict, I -- I think. But I think the problem here is\nthe Ninth Circuit -- you go to the Ninth Circuit and you\nsay, you know, there was excessive force here on anybody's\ndefinition for reasons that you say. And -- and the Ninth\nCircuit says, oh, it was a clear violation of the\nConstitution and we'll tell you why, and then they give\nsome reasons. And two of those reasons are, A, four and a\nhalf pages written the reason that this was\nunconstitutional is because they asked her questions about\nher immigration status, which you -- I don't think you\neven raised. Maybe you did. But anyway, that's -- that's\nthe bulk of the -- of -- of -- that's the bulk of the\nanalysis.\nAnd -- and these are the words that I think\nthey're objecting to. And by any standard of\nreasonableness, Mena was -- the -- the officers should\nhave released her from the handcuffs when it became clear\nthat she posed no immediate threat. And that was long\nbefore the -- the -- because she wasn't a threat. And\nthat was long before the end of the search.\nAnd what their point is on that is, you know, if\nthat's the rule, that's going to interfere with our SWAT\nteams because they can't operate that way. They -- they\ncan't evaluate the individual. They put the individual --\nif there are guns and gangs and danger that she'll grab a\ngun, they put her in handcuffs, and they hold her there\nfor the search for a couple of hours, then they release\nher. Now, that's their argument.\nSo they're objecting not so much to -- to the\nfact they have to pay $30,000 -- or they may object to\nthat. But they're -- they're objecting to the holding of\nthe Ninth Circuit, and if they're right on that, then I\nguess we have to send it back and say, do this over again,\nthough I'll be sorry about that and maybe there is a way\nnot to do it.\nBut -- but I want to know your view of what I\nsee as those two issues here, that the Ninth Circuit's\nanalysis was wrong.\nMR. HOFFMAN: Yes. I mean, first of all, I'd --\nI'd say that the -- the Court could affirm the judgment in\nthis case and the verdict in this case on the ground that\nwe --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes, but then we can't really\nreach the issue. That's a possibility. I see that.\nMR. HOFFMAN: And in fact -- and I -- I think\nthat would be the appropriate thing to do.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, but then suppose that the\nreason that this case is here is because of the\nimplications --\nMR. HOFFMAN: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- of the Ninth Circuit's\nanalysis --\nMR. HOFFMAN: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- not necessarily the extra 30\nminutes because I see your point on the extra 30 minutes.\nMR. HOFFMAN: I think -- I think that there -- I\nwould divide my response to that, Justice Breyer, into two\nparts really. On the questioning issue, I would just say\nthat that -- that was not an issue that was presented to\nthe jury for its verdict as a separate Fourth Amendment\nviolation. It wasn't. And we didn't argue it in the\nNinth Circuit.\nWhat we did -- we did say in our -- in our brief\nto the Ninth Circuit that she was questioned about her\nimmigration status about an issue that was unrelated to --\nto Summers detention. We did say that.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, we could say is their\nopinion -- that's their opinion. It's beside the point,\net cetera.\nMR. HOFFMAN: Right. So, I mean, I -- I think\non questioning, you know, we -- we haven't been pushing\nthat issue.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: If -- if two of the reasons\nthat the Ninth Circuit gave are in our view incorrect, why\nwouldn't we reverse and remand for them to do it without\n-- to make the judgment without taking those two factors\ninto account?\nMR. HOFFMAN: Well, I think what -- first of\nall, it's a separate alternative holding. What they said\nis that there was a separate Fourth Amendment violation\nwhile they affirmed on the basis that we actually won on.\nThe jury found that she had been detained longer than was\nreasonable and with more force than was reasonable. This\nis a jury verdict. The Ninth Circuit affirmed that.\nAnd we've argued in our brief that if the Court\ndid something on questioning, it would really be issuing\nan advisory opinion in this -- in this situation. And,\nyou know, we've -- we've argued the point and we're\nprepared certainly to argue about the merits of that\nquestion because it's obviously an important question. In\nour view, the questioning issue should be governed by the\nmore traditional Terry kind of idea that you can't\nquestion when it goes beyond the scope of the limited\npurposes of the intrusion, but we also understand that\nthat's contested.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- well, it does seem to me\nthat --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: It -- it does seem -- seem to\nme that the Ninth Circuit's opinion is questionable on --\non this key point of when she had to be released. The\nofficers should have released her when it became clear she\nposed no immediate threat and did not resist arrest.\nMR. HOFFMAN: Well --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I think that is critical to\nits holding.\nMR. HOFFMAN: Well --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And that implies that they\nhave a -- a duty at the outset to determine whether --\nwhat her status is rather than to go around looking for\nguns and -- and to secure the premises. That's -- that's\none of my concerns with that.\nMR. HOFFMAN: Well, I would have a different\nposition on that. First of all, I think that the judgment\ncan actually be affirmed on the first ground regardless of\nthis issue because it was a -- a jury verdict and -- and\nthe damages were asked for either/or in terms of question\n5 or 6.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: The -- the first ground being?\nJust an unreasonably long --\nMR. HOFFMAN: Detained beyond the -- the length\nof the search. And so I think technically the judgment\ncan be affirmed on that ground.\nBut with respect to the handcuffing, the\nposition that we would say is that, first of all, you --\nyou would have to view the facts in the light most\nfavorable to the verdict. Now, it's been -- there's been\na lot of questioning about what that means and what the\njury's role is. As we understand it, if Ornelas applies\nto this decision, which we assume the Court would do --\nand that is, that you would first have to take the light\n-- all the facts in the light most favorable to the\nverdict, including the possibility that the -- the jury\nrejected as being incredible the statements that the\nofficers made in terms of justification, if there was\nevidence in the record to show that there was\ncontradicting evidence, which there is in this record.\nAnd so the facts that -- that the other side has tried to\nargue are the facts on which you would make that\nconstitutional decision are not the facts in the light\nmost favorable to the verdict.\nIn the light most favorable to the verdict,\nthere was -- there was lots of planning. There was a\ntactical plan in writing that the jury got to see, which\nsaid that the -- the plan here was to go in and make the\nSWAT entry, to see if there were non-suspects there. They\nwould be patted down, identified, and released. The jury\nwas entitled not to believe the other side's claim that\nthey didn't say when they were going to be released and\nbelieved that the plan was to release them as soon as it\nwas ascertained that they did not have the connection in\n-- in the situation. And in fact, there's testimony from\nthe officers that they knew that they weren't gang members\nand they knew that they weren't connected to the crime.\nAnd they were completely cooperative, and they didn't\nresist arrest and they didn't flee. And Iris Mena is 5\nfoot 1 -- 5 foot 2 inches, and the jury had a videotape of\nexactly how they looked.\nThe officers had a total plan. They -- they\nexercised their command of the situation from the\nbeginning. They cleared it. They made sure it was safe.\nThey took people outside through the pouring rain, which\nactually they say there wasn't evidence about that.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Medium -- medium rain.\nMR. HOFFMAN: Well, actually at -- at joint\nappendix number 183, Officer Allegra, who was one of the\nentry team, said it was pouring. So -- and in fact, the\nstipulation of facts said it was heavy. So Iris Mena was\nbeing -- was being demure when she talked about that. You\ncan even see the rain on the videotape.\nAnd so they took her outside. They took all of\nthem outside. They put them in this little room, which is\nnot connected to the house. They had one or two armed\nofficers outside. There was no place for them to go.\nThey couldn't interfere with the facilitation of the\nsearch because they were in this room. They couldn't flee\nbecause there's only one way out, a door. There were two\narmed guards there. And -- and if all they had to do was\nsit these four people, who were not connected to any gang\nactivity, as to which they had no suspicion ever developed\nthat they had any connection to Mr. Romero, who had\nalready been arrested at his mom's house --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: They can't have a flat rule\nthat while you're conducting a search, you -- you can\nrestrain anybody that you find assuming the search is for\na crime that -- that involves violence.\nMR. HOFFMAN: Well, I think that the --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't want to have to make\nthat call all the time, you know.\nMR. HOFFMAN: Well, but -- but officers do make\nthat call all the time. They make it in the context of\nTerry stops. They make it in the context of lots of\nFourth Amendment issues.\nIn Summers -- in Summers, the man was detained.\nIn many of the post-Summers cases, including many cited by\nthe other side and the Government, handcuffing is not\nviewed as routine. Handcuffing is viewed as something\nthat substantially aggravates the nature of the seizure --\nJUSTICE BREYER: If that's true, is it routine\nin -- I mean, here what sort of pushes the other way on\nthis is this is a dangerous gang. They have lots of\nweapons and they have previously gone to this house, which\nI gather -- sometimes when I read it, I think it's like a\nwarren of little rooms. On the other hand, maybe it\nisn't. I haven't seen the house. There are a lot of\nbuildings around, and they think a lot of people here --\nwe don't know who's what, and we make a mistake in this\nand we're dead. You know, I mean, so that's painting it\nthe other way.\nBut where you have guns and -- and houses and\ngangs and so forth, now that's why they say that it's\nreasonable in those circumstances to say, when we find\nsomeone in the house, we handcuff them through the search.\nWe might let them go earlier, but that's up to us and we\ndon't want the courts second guessing us on that.\nNow, what's -- what's painting it their way, and\nI'd like you to respond.\nMR. HOFFMAN: I -- I understand that. I guess\nthe -- the problem with that is that that means that no\nmatter who they find -- and in this case is a good example\nof it. They were worried that they might find the gang\nmember who had a gun there, and that's what they were\nlooking for. Okay. And so they used the SWAT team. That\nseems perfectly reasonable that they would use a SWAT team\nthe way they did. And they went in and within literally 4\nor 5 minutes, they had -- this is a tiny, little house.\nThey had cleared the house. They had figured out all the\noccupants. They put them in a room completely under their\ncontrol where they couldn't get away from anything. They\nknew there were two 40-year-old people, a young hippie,\nand -- and an 18-year-old girl that was 5 foot --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Did they search that room?\nMR. HOFFMAN: Yes. They searched that room. So\nthe room was searched before they went there. They\nsearched all the rooms. They searched Ms. Mena's room and\nfound absolutely nothing there.\nAnd -- and the testimony -- and this goes to\nJustice Souter's question.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Did they -- did they search the\nindividuals too to make sure --\nMR. HOFFMAN: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I assume they did.\nMR. HOFFMAN: Oh, yes. They -- they searched\nthe individuals. They -- they -- you know, they\ncompletely made sure that -- that when they put them in\nthat back room, there was nothing in the room. There was\nnothing on the individuals. There was nothing that --\nthat could cause them danger.\nAnd -- and the jury, I think, was entitled to --\nto look at those facts and -- and to hear the facts and to\nsee the facts --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: How did the qualified\nimmunity question get resolved here?\nMR. HOFFMAN: Well, the --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: And what -- what role did\nthat play in all of this?\nMR. HOFFMAN: Well, at the -- at the district\ncourt level, the -- the district court heard a rule 59.\nBut one of the things about this case is it was tried\nright around the time that Saucier v. Katz came out, and\nin the Ninth Circuit, there was a question about who got\nto decide qualified immunity. This was June 2001\nactually. And so there was a rule 59 motion about whether\nthe proper standard of qualified immunity had been\napplied.\nThe district judge, looking at the facts, found\nthat there were facts to sustain the verdict, including\nevidence that Ms. Mena had been kept after the end of the\nsearch. The district judge found that. And then in -- in\nthe Ninth Circuit, of course, the Ninth Circuit's\npublished opinion deals with qualified immunity on both of\nthese issues.\nAnd basically the -- the qualified immunity --\non the -- on the over-detention claim, I think they've\nconceded that there just isn't any justification for -- I\nmean, a de minimis exception doesn't extend to 30 minutes.\nI mean, that -- this Court has debated whether 15 or 20 is\ntoo long on a -- on a Terry stop when there's actually\nreasonable suspicion. Here, there's nothing to hold her.\nWith respect to the handcuffing issue --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Is it clear that it was 30?\nMR. HOFFMAN: Well, I think in viewing the light\nmost favorable to the verdict, I think the Court has to\nassume that -- that the jury could have found an hour.\nBut what I'm saying is based on the officer's own\ntestimony alone, viewed in the light most favorable to the\nverdict, it's at least 27 to 32. And so you've got\nsomething that just could not possibly be considered de\nminimis under any kind of exception.\nAnd -- and that's why they fought it on the\nfacts. They haven't even made an argument on the law at\nany point in this.\nAnd with respect to handcuffing, I think our\nposition on the handcuffing is that Summers, first of all,\ndoesn't deal with handcuffing. And the other side has\nconsistently tried to equate detention with restraint.\nAnd I think what -- what Summers indicated was that this\nCourt was willing to allow people to be detained during\nthe course of a search for three specific reasons. And\nwhen balancing the nature of the intrusion against the\njustifications, this Court specifically said it was\nendorsing a limited intrusion, and that it wouldn't be\nvery much different asking someone to sit around --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Doesn't that just go to the\npoint that it's not clearly established at least?\nMR. HOFFMAN: Well, no. I -- I don't think that\nis the case, Justice Kennedy, because in -- in -- Summers\ndoesn't authorize what they did. Graham certainly talks\nabout having to justify force based on a -- on a Fourth\nAmendment analysis. And Franklin v. Foxworth, which is a\nNinth Circuit case that happened before this case, the\nCourt, first of all, used the -- the analysis that we have\nargued is appropriate based on Summers and Graham to\ndecide that a particular Summers detention was carried out\nin an unreasonable manner.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but that was ill\nindividual, a single individual --\nMR. HOFFMAN: Well --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- unclothed, et cetera --\nMR. HOFFMAN: No. I -- I understand that the\nfacts were more egregious, but the -- the Court's analysis\nfor a reasonable officer from a qualified immunity\nstandpoint -- for a reasonable officer reading that\nopinion, you draw at least three conclusions I think. One\nis that the proper analysis to determine whether\nhandcuffing or some additional form of restraint is -- is\nallowed has to be decided under the kinds of\njustifications that Summers provides and under a Graham\nanalysis when it comes to force. And there's lots of\ncases that -- that allow officers to do that. Lots of\nlower court cases. In fact, our view is all the lower\ncourt cases follow that kind of analysis and just come out\ndifferently depending on the facts and circumstances\nconfronted.\nThe second thing, the -- the point about the\ndisabled person and the particular facts made that case\nparticularly egregious, and the Ninth Circuit said those\nwere additional factors, not the line. The Ninth Circuit\ndidn't say that the constitutional standard was\nparticularly abusive or egregious. It -- it applied\ntraditional Fourth Amendment analysis.\nAnd finally and I think very important and not\ndealt with maybe in the briefs as much as it should be is\nthat the Ninth Circuit in -- in Franklin rejected a\nblanket handcuffing policy. That's what the policy was in\nPortland. The Portland police department had a policy\nthat said you are to handcuff everybody until the search\nis over. And the Ninth Circuit said you can't have that\nkind of policy because Summers and -- and Graham require\nit to be individualized justification for that -- for an\nadditional intrusion beyond the limited intrusion that's\nallowed in Summers.\nAnd in fact, in Summers, the Court went out of\nits way to say to compare with what the Court was allowing\nto what it -- to -- to the circumstances in Dunaway, to --\nto circumstances that start to look like an arrest. And I\ndon't know how much more intrusive you could be than what\nthese officers did to Iris Mena, and I think that's one of\nthe -- the issues here. If -- if the --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: And what do we do if we think\nthe Ninth Circuit was off base in -- in whether Mena could\nbe questioned about her immigration status?\nMR. HOFFMAN: Well, I -- I think that --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: That seemed to be an\nimportant part of the Ninth Circuit's rule.\nMR. HOFFMAN: Well, it's certainly -- it's\ncertainly an alternative ground. It's not -- it doesn't\naffect, I think, our verdict. And so I think what -- I\nmean, I suppose the Court could dismiss that question as\nimprovidently granted, could say to the court that it --\nthat it should reverse that part of the ruling.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: It might be useful to say\nthey were wrong in --\nMR. HOFFMAN: Well, that -- you -- you could say\nthat. I mean, I would -- on the merits of the question, I\n-- I would like to -- if we were reaching that, I would\nargue that the Ninth Circuit -- that -- that there is --\nthere should be a limit on questioning in a -- in a\nSummers detention, and the Court should apply the kind of\nTerry analysis that the majority of the -- the circuits\napply.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: What -- what will do if we\nthought the Ninth Circuit was egregiously wrong on that\nand that its opinion was, to use the most polite word,\ndisingenuous when it talked about a garage? That -- that\nwas somewhat off-putting to me when it was a converted\ngarage with a bed.\nMR. HOFFMAN: Well, I mean --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I mean, I -- I thought this\nwoman was standing in -- by some grease rack or something\nand she was --\nMR. HOFFMAN: She wasn't standing by a grease\nrack, but she was made to sit initially by an open door\nbecause the door had basically been obliterated on a very\ncold, rainy February morning where she was very cold, and\nafter -- and had been taken through the -- the pouring\nrain in bare feet and with only a T-shirt and was left\nthere for at least 20 or so minutes without being given a\ncoat or shoes. And she was made to sit by there and she\nwas very cold and uncomfortable. And she did complain\nthat the handcuffs were too tight and she complained that\nthey were uncomfortable and could they be removed.\nIt's not a garage in -- in the way that the\nvision of it, but also if you look at it, it's -- and the\n-- the jury did look at it because it had a videotape of\nthis. You could see that the -- the occupants were made\nto be in a very uncomfortable situation that was\nunnecessary. And that -- that was clearly established law\nin the Ninth Circuit certainly under Franklin that the\nmanner of a search that was unnecessarily prolonged or\npainful or an unnecessary invasion of privacy was clearly\nestablished law in the Ninth Circuit as of 1994.\nI think in the Heitschmidt case, which is very\nsimilar in a lot of ways to our case, that came out after\nthe search, but applied the same reasoning to a 1994\nsearch. You had the same kind of handcuffing of a non-\nsuspect as to whom the -- the officers didn't have that --\nthat kind of -- of suspicion. And the Fifth Circuit found\nthat that was a violation and denied qualified immunity to\nthe officers.\nSo from our standpoint, on the issue of being\ndetained past the time, I think it's just a clear case. I\nthink the other side has conceded that if -- if there's\nthis evidence in the record, which there is, the judgment\nhas to be affirmed on that basis.\nOn -- on the handcuffing issue, we believe the\nsame principle has to apply because the facts have to be\nviewed in the light most favorable to the verdict, and\nwhen you view those facts, I -- it -- it is -- no\nreasonable officer would believe you could do those things\nto Ms. Mena in these circumstances based on the law at the\ntime.\nAnd I think that it would be -- what the -- what\nthe United States and -- and what petitioners' counsel is\nasking for is really for a radical change of law\nthemselves. We're happy with Summers and Graham and the\nway that applies, and the -- the jury instruction was\nbased on -- on Summers and Graham and on Franklin. The\nlanguage is taken directly from those cases.\nAnd -- and the -- the jury in a case like this\n-- qualified immunity obviously provides some protection\nfor -- for officers that when -- when a reasonable officer\nwouldn't know these things. But jury verdicts also play a\ncrucial role in a civil rights case. In this case, a jury\nof our community found that Iris Mena had been subjected\nto an abuse of -- a specific abuse of authority in being\nheld beyond the time of -- of the search, even at a time\nwhen the prime target was -- was free to go about his\nbusiness with a citation, and was held in these painful\nhandcuffs for a period of over 2 hours in circumstances\nwhere, in the totality of the circumstances, she was\ntreated much more harshly than anything this Court, I\nthink, contemplated in the Summers case.\nAnd I think that officers know how to --\nofficers know how to handle the Fourth Amendment issues\ninvolved in this case. They don't need a special rule\nbecause that rule would end up meaning that when you go in\nand you don't find what you're afraid of, that everybody\nis still going to be subjected to this kind of serious\nintrusion on their individual liberty. And so we would\nurge the Court not to go down this new path that the\nUnited States and the petitioners are asking and to affirm\nthe judgment because it was based on clearly established\nprinciples that this Court and other courts around the\ncountry have -- have established.\nThank you very much.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you, Mr. Hoffman.\nMr. Phillips, you have about 3 and a half\nminutes.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. PHILLIPS: Thank you, Justice Stevens.\nI want to start with essentially the question\nthat Justices Breyer and Kennedy raised, which is what do\nyou do when you know that the Ninth Circuit is wrong, that\nthe questioning here violated the Fourth Amendment, and\nwhat do you do when you know that the Ninth Circuit was\nwrong in saying that the officers have an affirmative duty\nin the middle of a Summers detention to make an assessment\non an individualized basis as to the risks posed by any\nindividual detainee. Those are rulings that I submit to\nyou are plainly erroneous and warrant reversal on that\nbasis alone.\nAt that stage, if the respondent wants to argue\nto the Ninth Circuit that that 15 minutes is, in fact,\nproved by the facts of this case, that's fine, but\nunderstand, those issues were put to the Ninth Circuit,\nand the Ninth Circuit did not affirm on the alternative\nground that there were 15 minutes here. The Ninth Circuit\nexpressly never -- or didn't expressly but never said one\nword about a period of time after the search ended in this\nparticular case, and that's not an accident because there\nis no testimony. The officer said he didn't remember and\nwhen asked, well, would 10 to 15 minutes be consistent\nwith your memory, well, of course, it would. He didn't\nremember anything. So there's nothing in that evidence,\nand there's no way -- I have looked at that tape. I ask\nyou to look at that tape. I guarantee you there's no way\nyou can draw any inference as to at what point in this\nprocess she was released vis-a-vis the end of this\nparticular -- this particular search being executed.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So -- so do we have the tape\nhere?\nMR. PHILLIPS: I assume you have the tape. It's\npart of the record. It should be in the clerk's office.\nIf you don't have it, I'd be more than happy to send you a\ncopy.\nThe --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But there was no -- there was\nno objection to that question going to the jury, was the\nduration unreasonable.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Of course not, Justice Ginsburg,\nbecause the issue before the jury was whether or not the\n-- we had an affirmative duty to make an evaluation in the\nmiddle of the search as to whether or not she posed a -- a\nthreat. That was --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But the jury --\nMR. PHILLIPS: -- their theory of the case, and\nthat's what the Ninth Circuit said, is yes, we do have\nthat affirmative obligation.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But the jury answered the --\njust the general question, was the duration unreasonable,\nand the jury said yes.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Not of the search. Of her\ndetention.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Yes, of her detention. And that\nwas based on the jury's determination that we had detained\nher beyond the period we had done the sweep.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So if the district court got\nit right and the Ninth Circuit wrote a poor opinion, why\nshould we upset the judgment in the case? In other words,\nif what we had here was a trial that was okay, a district\njudge that behaved -- gave a proper charge, then the Ninth\nCircuit writes an opinion that doesn't seem to deal with\nwhat the district court and the jury decided.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, the -- the court of\nappeals' obligation here was to evaluate our argument that\nwe should -- we were entitled to judgment as a matter of\nlaw. The court of appeals put forth what it regarded as\nthe most legitimate bases on which to affirm the judgment\nin this case. The fact that neither of those withstand\nserious scrutiny, Justice Ginsburg, seems to me to be a\nbasis for reversing the Ninth Circuit and allowing the\nmatter to go back at this point.\nAnd -- and that is exactly what this Court does\nin -- you know, said it will do in Ornelas, that it is a\nde novo review. Punitive damages, exactly like a punitive\ndamages cases. Juries make punitive damages\ndeterminations every day and every day courts of appeals\nand trial judges review those damages awards de novo\nbecause they -- because the question is not just what are\nthe historical facts -- that you give deference to the\njury on -- but on the fundamental question of what is the\nrule of law that will govern the police officers in the\nexecution of search warrants in circumstances like this.\nThey need protection, Your Honor.\nThank you.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you, Mr. Phillips.\n"
