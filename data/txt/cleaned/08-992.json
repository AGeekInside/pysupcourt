Kindler.\nMr. Eisenberg.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF RONALD EISENBERG\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. EISENBERG: Mr. Chief Justice, and may\nit please the Court:\nJoseph Kindler, after attacking the judicial\nprocess by murdering a witness against him, again\nrepudiated that process by breaking out of prison twice\nand fleeing the country.\nThe court of appeals refused to honor the\nresulting procedural default on the ground that it was\ninadequate because discretionary. This Court should\nclarify that the purpose of the adequate State grounds\ndoctrine isn't to strip State courts of their equitable\npower to excuse procedural defaults, but simply to\nensure that they don't discriminate against Federal\nclaims under the guise of procedural ruling.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I didn't understand the\nThird Circuit rule to equate discretion with inadequacy.\nI thought their position was -- the assertion was that\nthe rule was mandatory; that is, if you are fugitives,\nyou are out forever.\nBut in fact, at the time that Kindler fled,\nthe rule was discretionary, so the mandatory rule hadn't\nbeen firmly established. That's what I thought the\nThird Circuit held. It did not equate discretion with\ninadequacy.\nMR. EISENBERG: That was the -- the argument\npresented, but I think what the Third Circuit held was\nsimply to equate discretion with inadequacy. But in any\ncase, Justice Ginsburg --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Where is that? I mean, why\ndo we have to guess about it? Where -- where do you\nfind that in its opinion? Because I have -- I have the\nsame -- the same problem.\nMR. EISENBERG: I don't think we really have\nto guess, Your Honor. I think, looking, for example, in\nthe third appendix at the top of page 22, where the\nThird Circuit is characterizing its prior law in this\nquestion:\n\"After surveying decisions of the\nPennsylvania courts, we concluded that the Pennsylvania\ncourts had discretion to hear an appeal filed by a\nfugitive who had been returned to custody before an\nappeal was initiated and dismissed. Accordingly, the\nfugitive-forfeiture rule was not firmly established and,\ntherefore, is not an independent and adequate procedural\nrule.\"\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But the fugitive-\nforfeiture rule that they were talking about was the --\nthe mandatory rule wasn't firmly established.\nMR. EISENBERG: Well, I don't think that's a\nfair reading of this language, in and of itself, Your\nHonor. But it really doesn't matter for our position,\nand that's because the rule that was applied to this\ndefendant was a discretionary rule.\nThe Pennsylvania -- the trial court in this\ncase exercised his discretion not to reinstate\npost-verdict motions. The opinion that was written by\nthe trial court and is in the joint appendix at page --\nI believe it's 69, Your Honor -- states that the\nquestion was whether the trial judge abused his\ndiscretion in declining to reinstate post-trial motions.\nWhen the case that Your Honor's --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I -- I have a number of\nproblems with the Third Circuit's opinion, but the\nquestion presented, it seems to me, is not really the\ndispositive point of the opinion. I don't think the\nquestion you presented is really that squarely before\nus.\nMR. EISENBERG: Well, Your Honor --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And I don't see a split,\neither. I mean, of course, there is going to be some\ndiscretion. The question is -- the Third Circuit, as I\nread the opinion, was concerned that it wasn't firmly\nestablished at the time of the waiver.\nI have real problems with whether the waiver\nshould even be -- whether the time of the waiver is\ncontrolling, but that is not the question you asked us\nto resolve.\nMR. EISENBERG: Your Honor, I think the\nproblem here and the reason that we are at this point is\nthat, whether the test is stated directly as being a per\nse ban on discretion or whether simply the standard is\nso high under an interpretation of \"firmly established\"\nthat allows for virtually no deviation in results by the\nState courts, the effect is the same. It's to drive out\nthe exercise of discretion by the State courts.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But this wasn't the\nruling by the court in analyzing your cases and\nsaying -- you know, in six out of the cases -- six out\nof the ten cases, discretion was exercised, in four it\nwasn't, and so it's not firmly established because the\nnumbers are skewed.\nJustice Ginsburg -- you pointed Justice\nGinsburg to page 23, and the Court very directly there\nsays, look, we are rejecting the State's argument that\nthe waiver rule was mandatory.\nMR. EISENBERG: Justice Sotomayor --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And so it characterized\nyour argument that way, that you were saying the\ndistrict court had no discretion.\nMR. EISENBERG: Justice Sotomayor, the State\ndidn't argue in Federal court that the State rule was\nmandatory. We were very explicit.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, whether you think\nyou did or didn't, that's how the court described it, so\nit understood you to be taking a different position.\nAre we going to correct it because it\nmisunderstood you? Or --\nMR. EISENBERG: The problem is that the\nThird Circuit did not engage in any inquiry about the\nnature of the rule that was applied to this defendant,\nso it was not in any position to say that a different\nrule was applied to this defendant than the rule that\nshould have been applied.\nThat's the problem with the argument that a\nnew rule was sprung on this defendant. The rule that\nwas applied to this defendant was discretion, and the\nThird Circuit never discusses anything other than that.\nThey reject our argument that the underlying\nrule was mandatory in that language, but they never\ndiscuss what rule was actually applied to this\ndefendant. We think it was clearly a discretionary\nrule.\nBut the -- the real question is whether, at\nthe time of the default, the default that occurred by\nthe extraordinary act of escaping, the defendant was not\nfairly apprised of the consequences of his action.\nAnd, really, whether or not the rule --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You mean that the\ndefendant might not have escaped if he knew that the\nrule wasn't --\nMR. EISENBERG: Well, I think that's the\nirony of applying this sort of adequacy analysis to this\nkind of default, but that, I think, is more of a problem\nfor Kindler than for the Commonwealth.\nThis Court has consistently held in its\nadequacy cases that the litigant must have ample\nopportunity to comply with the State's procedure.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I don't know why you\nsubmit -- why you seem to concede that that applies\nhere. I can understand why we want to look at the time\nof the waiver if it's an attorney arguing about jury\ninstructions and so forth, but the man escapes when the\ndoor is open or when the window is open, and he doesn't\ngive consideration to these things; and if he does, I\nthink that's quite irrelevant.\nIt seems to me that the waiver point is --\nis something that shouldn't be conceded. I think that\nif ten years elapse between the time of the escape and\nthe time the State formulates its rules, that he is\nbound by those rules when he gets there. But you don't\nargue that. That's not what you presented to us.\nMR. EISENBERG: Well, I think, Your Honor,\nwhat we are presenting is that the nature of the State\nrule here was -- was such that the defendant had\nreasonable notice of what he was facing by escaping,\nwhether or not it would have affected his subjective\ndecision to escape, and therefore that the State ground\ncan't be thrown out in Federal court on the ground of\nadequacy. And really, whether the rule was strictly\nmandatory in 1984 or discretionary doesn't much matter\nfor purposes of putting the defendant on notice that if\nhe escaped, he was going to run into serious trouble\ntrying to appeal at the same time that he was trying to\nstay in Canada for the rest of his life.\nThat's what this case is really all about.\nAnd yet, the lower courts I think have so misconstrued\nthis Court's adequacy doctrine that they have come to\nthe point of saying that even in that situation, the\nrule is inadequate and can be ignored in Federal court.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What court has said? As\nI read the Third Circuit, it says: A procedural rule\nthat is consistently applied in the vast majority of\ncases; even if State courts are willing to occasionally\noverlook it and review the merits of a claim, that\nthat's okay.\nMR. EISENBERG: Your Honor --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So what other circuit\nhas said that any measure of discretion or even a lot of\nuse of discretion bars deference to the State rule?\nMR. EISENBERG: Justice Sotomayor, I think\nif you look at the amicus brief filed on behalf of 25\nStates, you will see that that there are a great many\ncases where that's exactly the analysis that the courts\nhave applied, and in many of those cases they have\nrequired the parties to place before them dozens and\nsometimes hundreds of other examples of the operation of\na State procedural rule so that the lower Federal court\ncan decide whether that --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How many of those cases\nresulted in the overturning or the grant of habeas --\nMR. EISENBERG: I think in California, for\nexample, it's been quite common. The State's rule for\ntimeliness of post-conviction communications is seldom\nenforced in Federal court, as we learned from the amicus\nbrief. In fact, it virtually doesn't exist. And even\nin those cases where the courts --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But do we -- what --\nwhat does that tell us about us establishing the rule\nthat you propose?\nMR. EISENBERG: I think what it tells us is\nthat the lower courts are applying a very different\nadequacy rule than this Court has been applying. We are\nnot really asking for some kind of new rule from this\nCourt as compared to your prior line of cases on\nadequacy.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But you are asking us to\ntake away a part of the inquiry.\nMR. EISENBERG: Not at all, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Your notice -- your\nnotice and an opportunity to comply doesn't address a\nrepeated statement by us, which is that whatever test is\napplied has to get to whether the State court is\nattempting to evade Federal review of constitutional\nquestions.\nMR. EISENBERG: Yes, it does, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. And so your\ntest does nothing to inform that question, for example,\nthe Flowers situation. There was a clear rule, there\nwas more than an adequate opportunity to comply, and yet\nwe said it didn't qualify for deference because it was\nclearly, given the circumstances of the State\napplication of the rule at issue, an attempt to evade a\nconstitutional right.\nMR. EISENBERG: The question is what those\ncircumstances are, Your Honor. And in virtually case\nafter case, the circumstances that have been identified\nby this Court for actually finding a rule inadequate are\nthat the State rule was some kind of bait and switch,\nthat it was a -- to use Justice Holmes' classic\nformulation, that it was a spring -- a trap that was\nsprung on the defendant. One rule existed at the time\nthat the litigant was proceeding, another rule was\napplied when the case reached appeal. And that is\ncharacteristically what has made this Court, not the\nlower Federal courts, but this Court, hold that rules\nwere actually inadequate.\nSo in Ford v. Georgia, for example, where\nthe defendant raised a Batson claim after the jury was\nsworn, because that's what the law was at the time of\nhis trial, when the case reached appeal the appellate --\nthe State appellate court said: No, no; we have a new\nrule now; you have to do it before the jury is sworn.\nAnd they found his claim waived. That rule was\ninadequate.\nIn James v. Kentucky, where the defendant\nasked for an adverse inference charge and he asked for\nan admonition rather than an instruction, and the State\ncourt said, no, no, it was supposed to be an instruction\nrather than an admonition, that was a reversal of prior\nState law.\nThere are many cases very much like that\nwhere there is a spring set by the State in the sense\nthat a different rule is applied on appeal than was\nbefore the litigant at the time that he was trying to\ncomply with the rule.\nNow, this case obviously is quite far from\nthat, and that's exactly why this case should have been\nthe last sort of case where a rule was found inadequate.\nThe higher the standard that the lower courts apply, the\nstricter the standard that the lower Federal courts\napply to analyze the adequacy of State rules, the less\nopportunity there will be for discretion on the part of\nthe States. And the loser in that equation, while it\nmight not be this defendant, will be the vast majority\nof defendants who would have been more entitled, more\ndeserving of discretion, of leniency from the State\ncourts.\nThe State courts need to be allowed to apply\nthe kind of discretion in their procedural rulings that\nthis Court applies, that the Federal courts are allowed\nin -- in Federal procedural rulings -- for example,\nunder the plain error rule, even under the Federal\nfugitive-forfeiture rule.\nIn 1876 this Court said that it's within our\ndiscretion to dismiss a case where the defendant is a\nfugitive, and since then, while there have been a number\nof decisions from this Court concerning fugitive\ndefendants, none of them have laid out the sort of menu,\nthe sort of standards and substandards and subrules that\nthe defendant is now arguing have to be present in a\nrule for it to be adequate.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But the question that you\npresent -- I mean, you state it forthrightly in your\nbrief, and I'm reading from page 7, you say: \"The court\nof appeals interpreted this Court's precedent to compel\na finding of inadequacy for any State procedural rule\nthat permits the State courts to exercise a degree of\ndiscretion. Any discretion is inadequate.\" That's what\nyou say the court of appeals interpreted this Court's\nprecedent to say: Discretion, inadequate.\nWell, I'm looking first at the petition\nappendix page 62, which describes the district court's\nunderstanding, which the Third Circuit affirmed. It\nsays: \"An occasional act of grace by a State court in\nexcusing or disregarding a State procedural rule does\nnot render the rule inadequate to procedurally bar\nadvancing a habeas claim in district court.\"\nWell, that's saying, yes, you can have a\nrule with discretion, not to follow the rule woodenly,\nand that doesn't make it inadequate.\nMR. EISENBERG: Justice Ginsburg, an\noccasional act of grace, that level of -- of leniency or\nflexibility that would be allowed by the district\ncourt's view of the law, or the Third Circuit's, is\nsimply not appropriate in judging the adequacy of State\ngrounds.\nIt's certainly not the kind of miserly,\ncrabbed review of the exercise of discretion that occurs\nin Federal procedural rulings like the plain error rule.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, do you want to\nmodify then what you said? You said that the court of\nappeals said that any -- any degree of discretion means\nthat the rule is inadequate.\nMR. EISENBERG: Justice Ginsburg, we say\nthat because there was no analysis here of what degree\nof discretion or whether discretion was actually applied\nby the State court in this case. That's why, in effect,\nwe say that the Third Circuit's ruling was about the per\nse exercise of discretion.\nBut even if it wasn't automatically about\nthe exercise of discretion, even if it was merely\napplying a rule which is so narrow and strict that in\npractical effect the State courts have little actual\ndiscretion to exercise, that's still a problem and it's\nstill inconsistent with the purpose of the adequate\nState grounds doctrine, which was never intended to\nallow Federal courts or to require lower Federal courts\nto engage in the kind of analysis that many of the lower\nFederal courts are now undertaking.\nBasically, they -- they are taking out their\nmagnifying glasses and starting to split hairs by\nlooking at every single case, by looking at how those\ncases compare to each other, by deciding whether there's\nenough of a standard, is there enough of a precedent,\ndid you tell this little particular little fact to the\ndefendant before. That sort of analysis is not part of\nthis Court's adequacy doctrine.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But what makes -- makes\nthis particularly puzzling is you are attributing a rule\nto the Third Circuit that that very circuit in Campbell\nv. Burris said was not a tool. In the -- in Campbell v.\nBurris, the Third Circuit said a State procedural rule\ncan't be, cannot be rendered per se inadequate merely\nbecause it allows for some exercise of discretion.\nMR. EISENBERG: And I think if the Third\nCircuit had applied that statement in this case, there\nmight have been a different result and at the very least\nthere would have been additional analysis, because that\ncalls for additional analysis beyond the absolute lack\nof analysis in this opinion about the nature of the rule\nthat was actually applied to this defendant.\nWithout that sort of analysis, you can't say\nthat the Court is looking at whether this -- this\nparticular exercise of discretion came within the small\nwindow that that court would allow to the States. That\n-- that --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, it would be really\nodd, considering that one member of the panel was on\nboth cases, Stapleton, and these cases are in the same\nyear, for at least that judge not to think that what he\nsaid in the one case was in no conflict with what he\nsaid in the other.\nMR. EISENBERG: And yet we have a result,\nYour Honor, which is explainable only on the ground that\nthe State court rule maintains some power of discretion\nby the State courts. There is nothing else in the\nopinion that explains the result in this case.\nBut I emphasize again that, even if the\ncourt had applied a different rule, the rule that it\nsaid it was applying in some of the Third Circuit's\nother panel opinions, we would still be left with a\nstandard which is far narrower than anything that this\nCourt has actually applied in its own decisions.\nThere have been a variety of phrases in the\nCourt's decisions, things like \"firmly established,\"\n\"strictly followed,\" \"regularly applied.\"\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But it seems to me that\nthat's not what the Third -- Third Circuit was saying.\nIt was saying that adequacy of the rule is determined by\nthe law in effect at the time of the waiver, and it\nwasn't well-established.\nNow, I have real problems with that as an\nopening premise, but that's not what you asked us to\nresolve in your petition.\nMR. EISENBERG: Well, I don't think that\nthere is an analysis of whether the law was -- was\nestablished at the time of the waiver, Your Honor,\nbecause what the court says, or at least what the\nprecedents it rely on say, is that at the time of the\nwaiver here, assuming for the moment that that's the\nrelevant inquiry, the rule was discretionary.\nThe question then has to be, was that rule\napplied to the defendant? If a different rule is\napplied to the defendant, if the difference --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, I don't know\nhow you say that. Yes, it was clearly established that\nthe district court had discretion -- none of the\njustices below disagreed with this -- to dismiss\npost-verdict motions on the basis of flight. The courts\nbelow themselves said: What we don't have a rule about\nis what we do with respect to a post-judgment motion to\nreinstate or how we the appellate court will treat that\nwaiver once it comes before us. Will we apply it to the\nappellate process as well?\nI understood the Third Circuit to be saying\nthat it was those two latter components, which the\ncourts below themselves identified as new questions,\nthat it was resolving, that involve new rules.\nMR. EISENBERG: Your Honor --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's as simply as I\nthought the issue was. Maybe your adversary will\ndissuade me and concede your point that what the court\nwas saying, the discretionary application, is what was\nat issue, but if as I've described things is correct,\nhow does your position continue to be sustained?\nMR. EISENBERG: That wasn't State law in\nfact, Your Honor. The State courts didn't make the kind\nof decision that the Federal court, not actually in this\ncase, but in the case that it cited, Doctor, tried to\nmake. That is a distinction that Doctor invented from\nState law. It is not a distinction that the State cases\nannounced themselves.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So what you are\ndisagreeing with is the Third Circuit's conclusion of\nwhat the status of Pennsylvania law was?\nMR. EISENBERG: Well, that would have been\nclearer, I think, if we were appealing from the Doctor\ndecision here now rather than from this decision, but I\nthink that there is at the very least a great degree of\nunclarity in exactly what the --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, Doctor dealt with\nwhat will the court do with respect to, not post-verdict\nmotions, but with respect to appeals that are raised\nbefore or after flight.\nMR. EISENBERG: That is what Doctor said was\na distinction in State law.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And that's what Doctor\nsaid?\nMR. EISENBERG: Doctor said that. Only that\nFederal court said that.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So now the only other --\nKindler now raises a new question: What are we going to\ndo -- according to the courts below, what are we going\nto do with post-verdict motions to reinstate and to\nappeals that result after flight and after waiver;\ncorrect?\nMR. EISENBERG: In fact, not a new question\nat all under State law, Your Honor. And we have cited\nseveral State court opinions --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's where the\ndisagreement lies: Did the Third Circuit get\nPennsylvania law wrong on this issue.\nMR. EISENBERG: I think that's at least\nwhere the disagreement lie -- lay between the\nCommonwealth and Kindler below. As I say, I think\nthere's a great --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. Let's assume\nthe Third Circuit, that we take the hypothetical that\nthey were right. How do you still win?\nMR. EISENBERG: Then the question becomes,\nYour Honor, whether the alleged discrepancy, difference\nin the State law or -- or degree of unclarity is\nsufficient to meet this Court's adequacy test.\nAnd that's where I think we get back to\nFederal analogies like the Federal fugitive flight rule.\nAnd I'd like to address that -- that question, and then\nreserve the remainder of my time for rebuttal.\nUnder the Federal fugitive flight rule, many\nof these kinds of distinctions have never been spelled\nout. The courts simply laid out a general rule starting\nin the late 1800s that it was within our discretion to\ndismiss.\nBut despite the fact that the Court hasn't\nbasically subdivided the rule with the nit-picking\nanalysis that the Doctor court tried to impose on the\nPennsylvania cases, that doesn't make the fugitive-\nforfeiture rule inadequate and therefore inapplicable to\ndefendants. In fact, even after this Court's decision\nin Ortega-Rodriguez, which overturned an automatic\nforfeiture rule on -- applied by the Federal Court of\nAppeals, the Court allowed the district court's\ndiscretion to carry out the fugitive-forfeiture rule as\nthey saw fit under the circumstances. And the day after\nOrtega-Rodriguez, despite the fact that no substandards\nhad yet been developed, there was still a Federal\nfugitive-forfeiture rule --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask one question\nbefore your time is gone? Has there ever been a\nprecedent in Pennsylvania where they have applied the\nprocedural default rule against a capital defendant who\n-- who was guilty of flight?\nMR. EISENBERG: No, Your Honor, and I think\nthat that's an excellent example of what I was just\nsaying. The fact that the general rule of fugitive-\nforfeiture hadn't yet addressed the subquestion of\nwhether there should be an exception for capital\ndefendants did not render the State rule inadequate.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But wasn't there -- wasn't\nthere a general rule that capital defendants always get\none shot at their constitutional issues?\nMR. EISENBERG: No, Your Honor. At this\ntime, there was simply a rule that said that in capital\ncases we will apply a limited form of relaxation of\nour -- of our rules to address significant questions.\nWhen you look at that language, it's almost exactly the\nsame as the Federal plain error rule.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But were there\nPennsylvania cases in which they had prevented a capital\ndefendant from raising a Federal constitutional issue\nfor the first time?\nMR. EISENBERG: No, Your Honor. There had\nonly been a few capital cases even decided at the time\nof the flight here.\nThe point is that the way that the --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: How about other rules? In\ncapital cases, had they applied other procedural default\nrules at -- for the first time a capital defendant\nsought to raise a constitutional issue?\nMR. EISENBERG: At that time, I think they\nhad not yet, but really, there are only a handful of --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: So then how can you have a\nfirmly established rule?\nMR. EISENBERG: I don't think you have a\nfirmly established rule, Your Honor, because you have --\nthe firmly established rule was the preexisting rule\nrequiring preservation of error claims, in the same way\nthat under the Federal plain error rule the rule is you\nhave to preserve your claims.\nA defendant cannot come along and say: Hey,\nin Rule 52(b) it says that if my claim is plain and\nsignificant it's not waived, and therefore I have no\nobligation to ever preserve my claims. The Federal\nplain error rule is an exception that might apply to\nyou, but it doesn't do away with the underlying rule of\nissue preservation.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Lawry.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MATTHEW C. LAWRY\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. LAWRY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nI first want to address what is really at\nstake here. The Commonwealth wants this Court to change\nthe adequate State ground doctrine so that Mr. Kindler\nmay be executed with no review by any court of his\nmeritorious claims that his death sentence was\nunconstitutional.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but that's\nbecause he escaped. He avoided judicial process, and\nyou would have him be in the same position once he's\ncaptured and returned and captured and returned as he\nwas before he escaped at all, right?\nMR. LAWRY: Well, the question is, was there\na firmly established and consistently applied State rule\nthat would result in all of his claims being taken away.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And you think\nthat -- and you don't think -- you think you can argue\nthat a State rule saying, look, if you escape and flee\nthe jurisdiction, you bar -- your claims cannot be\nadequate and independent?\nMR. LAWRY: No, I don't think that, Your\nHonor. What -- what -- what this Court has always\nrequired and what we are arguing, this Court has always\nrequired that a State procedural rule be firmly\nestablished and consistently applied in order to take\naway a litigant's claims.\nAnd our position and what the Third Circuit\nbelow held was that in numerous respects, the -- the\nrules that the State court applied here were not firmly\nestablished or consistently applied.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What rules -- I'm --\nMR. LAWRY: Well, it's really --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What is -- what is your\nposition as to what the Third Circuit was saying or\nholding? Are you saying, like your adversary, that they\nwere saying because it was discretionary and there were\na lot of exceptions to it, it wasn't firmly established?\nOr were you -- or do you read it as saying, now that you\nhave made it mandatory, that's a new rule -- the waiver\nmandatory, that's a new rule?\nMR. LAWRY: Well -- well, to begin with,\nwhat we're saying is that --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It's not what you are\nsaying. What do you think the Third Circuit said?\nMR. LAWRY: What -- what I would suggest the\nThird Circuit said is that this case is very like\nDoctor. It said Doctor was controlling precedent, and\nDoctor involved a defendant who fled pretrial or in the\nmiddle of trial, and at that time there was a sort of\ntwo-part rule in Pennsylvania for dealing with fugitive-\nforfeiture.\nOne part was -- and this is in noncapital\ncases. One part was if the defendant flees during the\nappellate process, then the appeal could be dismissed.\nThe other part was if it's any time before that, there\nis discretion.\nAnd -- and so, when Doctor appealed, by the\ntime his appeal was heard, Pennsylvania had changed its\nrule completely to one in which a flight at any time, at\nany time at all, was considered a complete forfeiture.\nAnd that was -- it was that change from a discretionary\nrule to a forfeiture rule that the Third Circuit said in\nDoctor was inadequate. And it said again in Kindler\nthat the same kind of change was inadequate.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What was the change --\nMR. LAWRY: The change --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- that you think the\nThird Circuit was identifying?\nMR. LAWRY: The change that the Third\nCircuit identified was from a -- a situation where there\nwas complete discretion -- and really more often than\nnot, even in noncapital cases, the discretion was\nexercised to hear the issues. It changed from that to\none where there is essentially a -- a presumption of --\nof waiver or forfeiture and some potential way to --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Let's assume that a\nlower court in this case had said: You know, we have\ndiscretion, but we're not going to exercise it because\nyou escaped twice and were away much longer than most\nfugitives. There is a presumption that witnesses'\nmemories fade, that it's harder for trials that are so\ndistant from the event, that distant from an event. We\nare not going to exercise our discretion.\nIs it your view -- because that's the\nundertone I'm hearing -- that under firmly established\nground that the court would have still ruled that that\nexercise of discretion was not adequate under --\nMR. LAWRY: That the Third Circuit would\nhave said that?\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Yeah.\nMR. LAWRY: It's a very -- it's a very\ndifferent case. I think if --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Sure, it is. But what\nyou -- there is a tone to the way you presented this\ncase that says because they chose often to exercise\ndiscretion in the past, if they choose not to in any\ncase, it's no longer an independent State ground.\nThat's what -- is that the point you are arguing?\nMR. LAWRY: No.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Because that's the\nquestion presented.\nMR. LAWRY: That's not the point that we are\narguing. What we are arguing is that there needs to be\nconsistent application of the rules. And --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, that begs your\nadversary's question, which is every case has one or\nmore differences in it. At what point does a lower\ncourt have to -- can it say, you know, yes, because they\nexercised discretion sometimes but not others it's still\nan independent State ground to find forfeiture?\nMR. LAWRY: There -- there are several\nthings that are important in this kind of situation.\nOne is how -- it's really how is the rule being applied.\nAnd if -- if the rule is -- if there is a situation\nwhere -- where in the vast majority of cases the rule is\nbeing applied to deny review and there are occasional\nacts of grace, that's one thing. It's very different\nwhen almost every time the situation comes up review is\nallowed and then in the occasional exception, without\nexplanation, it's taken away.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, following\nup on that, I'd like your answer to this question: Is a\nState procedural rule automatically inadequate and,\ntherefore, unenforceable when the State rule is\ndiscretionary rather than mandatory? Automatically?\nMR. LAWRY: No, it is not automatically\ninadequate.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you agree --\nMR. LAWRY: It's not our position --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you agree with\nthe Petitioner's response to that question? Their\npoint -- their question presented is, is it\nautomatically inadequate because there is discretion?\nThey say no, you say no.\nMR. LAWRY: And we don't think that the --\nthat the Third Circuit said --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but that was\nthe same -- that was the position you took in your\nopposition to certiorari.\nMR. LAWRY: Correct.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And yet we\nnonetheless granted -- granted cert.\nMR. LAWRY: Correct.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, if some of\nus -- or I suppose if several of us -- think that that\nmay have been or was what the Third Circuit said, would\nyou have any objection to us vacating the opinion,\nexplaining since you both agree that the rule is not\nautomatically inadequate, make sure they understand\nthat, and then they can proceed however they see fit?\nMR. LAWRY: I would have no objection to\nthat, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Insofar as the ongoing\nrule is concerned, let's assume that as of the time of\nDoctor, which was a Third Circuit case, 1996, the\nPennsylvania rule was then clear, Pennsylvania for the\nfirst time having made its rule clear. Would it be\nimproper to apply it to this defendant, because he\nescaped before Doctor made it clear? I -- I just don't\nunderstand why the general rules of -- of -- of waiver\napply in this case. It -- it doesn't affect rational\nconduct. It doesn't trap an attorney. Why can't we\ntake the rule as it was when we heard his case after he\nhad been returned as a fugitive?\nMR. LAWRY: Well, part of the problem here\nis that -- that Pennsylvania law and what the\nPennsylvania rule is was a moving target throughout this\ntime period. There was the -- the discretionary sort of\nregime under Galloway which -- which did hold as Doctor\ndescribes it. Then there was a time period when there\nwas absolute forfeiture. Then there was another time\nperiod where they backed away from that.\nAnd so that -- that kind of shifting, of\nturning procedural rules on and off, is the antithesis\nof consistent application of rules.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that may be, but\nwhere -- where do you get that from the opinion of the\ncourt of appeals here? I find it very easy to get from\nthe opinion of the court of appeals the proposition that\nif there is discretion, it's not a firmly established\nrule.\nWhere do you get your theory, that they had\nchanged it from a discretionary rule to a mandatory rule\nat the time that the State court made this ruling?\nWhere do you find that in the opinion of the court of\nappeals?\nMR. LAWRY: Well, I -- I would -- I would\nacknowledge that it's a bit cryptic, but I think because\nthe Third Circuit in Kindler said that Doctor is what's\ncontrolling in its analysis, I think you really have to\nread it in light of Doctor. And Doctor makes very clear\nthat what the Third Circuit was looking at there was a\nchange from a discretionary rule to a mandatory rule.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So they are going to say, I\nimagine below -- I'm not sure -- say: Look, that's\nright, and Doctor talked about the shift from mandatory\nto discretionary, and the district court -- the State,\nin Doctor, said that it was a mandatory -- it's\nmandatory.\nBut in this case, the district court said\nit's discretionary. So insofar as there are two rules\n-- or were at the time, your client got the benefit of\nthe most liberal, and, therefore, insofar as there is a\ndifference, it made no difference.\nMR. LAWRY: Well, actually our client didn't\nget the benefit of a number of things that were clearly\nestablished law in Pennsylvania at the time.\nFirst off, there was the policy of relaxed\nwaiver that applied to all capital cases and meant\nmerits review of all issues. And --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that's -- that's a\ndifferent issue. Now, your -- your assertion is that\nwhat the court of appeals was based on -- decision\nwas -- was not this that you are arguing now, but\nrather, it was based on the fact that there had been a\nchange in the law from discretionary to mandatory.\nI can't find that, frankly, in the opinion,\nexcept in its reference to Doctor, so I have got to go\nback and read Doctor and guess that that's what they\nmeant when they referred to Doctor.\nBut assuming it's true, Justice Breyer says,\neven if it is true, what difference does it make?\nBecause, even if they had changed from a discretionary\nto a mandatory, the trial court in the State had not\nrealized that they had changed and gave him the\ndiscretionary.\nSo what -- what complaint do you have?\nMR. LAWRY: Well, it's not even clear,\nreally, what -- what the trial court was applying, but I\nthink that there are -- there are a number of serious\nproblems with -- with the consistent application in this\ncase.\nIf you want to look for just the most\nobvious ones, Reginald Lewis, a capital defendant, and\nMr. Kindler escaped together, at the same time, the same\nday, together. Mr. Lewis got complete full review,\nmerits review, of all of his issues on direct appeal,\nall of his issues in post-conviction. Mr. Kindler got\nno review.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right. And that\nis -- your objection is that it wasn't fairly applied.\nDiscretion was abused in this case, to borrow from the\nFederal law. They didn't treat them the same. They\nshould have treated them the same.\nBut the question is whether the rule is\nautomatically inadequate if there is discretion. You\nare arguing about how it was applied, which I guess\nmeans that it's not automatically inadequate because if\nthey apply it the way you think it should be then it\nwould be adequate.\nMR. LAWRY: I -- I lost your train of\nthought there. I apologize.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Maybe I did, too.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. LAWRY: No. I don't think --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But the point is you\nare arguing about the application -- the exercise of\ndiscretion. You say the one guy, Lewis, got the benefit\nof the rule; your guy didn't get the benefit of the\nrule; and that's unfair, right?\nMR. LAWRY: That's -- that's part of what\nI'm arguing. Yes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you are not\narguing -- which would be very odd to argue -- that the\ndiscretion always makes the rule invalid because you --\nMR. LAWRY: No. We are not -- we are not\narguing that.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Do I -- Do I take it\nthat -- that Justice -- Justice Breyer's question,\nrepeated by Justice Scalia -- just take that fact,\nthat's the only question before us. If it was\ndiscretionary and it's now mandatory, just focus on that\nonly.\nMR. LAWRY: Uh-huh.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Then your client isn't\nhurt? If you take --\nMR. LAWRY: No, he is hurt if it is now\nmandatory, yes, because -- because it's -- it's like --\nit's like Ford or any of the other cases where -- where\nthe rules are being changed.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: If -- if the new rule was\napplied to him.\nMR. LAWRY: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But the point is the new\nrule wasn't applied to him. The trial court thought\nthat it had discretion.\nMR. LAWRY: Well, yes --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's clear from the trial\ncourt's opinion, isn't it?\nMR. LAWRY: Okay. But -- but what I'm\nfocusing on is what the Pennsylvania Supreme Court did,\nand they did a number of things.\nAnother thing that the Pennsylvania Supreme\nCourt did was they said, in the direct appeal opinion,\nMr. Kindler's flight makes his case like somebody who\naffirmatively goes and gives up his direct appeal\naltogether. All right.\nNow, the people that they mentioned who\naffirmatively gave up their direct appeals altogether,\nwhen those defendants went and sought post-conviction\nrelief, they got full post-conviction review in the\nPennsylvania courts. When Mr. Kindler went, he got no\nreview.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: By whom?\nMR. LAWRY: By any -- I'm sorry. By either\n--\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No, no. Stop.\nIs the relaxed waiver rule one that applies\nto district court consideration or appellate court\nconsideration or both?\nMR. LAWRY: It applies at all levels.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: At all levels. What is\nyour reading of what the new rule that the State was\nannouncing was announcing? That it was doing away with\nthe State court's relaxed waiver rule? Was it doing it\naway with its own relaxed waiver rule? What's your\nposition in this case?\nMR. LAWRY: The -- the State courts simply\ndid not apply relaxed waiver to Mr. Kindler.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: None of them, including\nthe trial court?\nMR. LAWRY: Including -- including the trial\ncourt, yes. Mr. Kindler asked for relaxed -- in fact,\nwhen the Commonwealth initially moved to dismiss his\npost-verdict motions, the Commonwealth said: We know\nthere is this relaxed waiver out there, so if you -- if\nyou don't dismiss his post-verdict motions entirely, at\nleast dismiss the guilt phase and consider his issues\nwith regard to capital sentencing. The Commonwealth\nsaid that.\nSo -- so the -- so there's -- there's no\nquestion that -- that, on the PCRA appeal, what the\nPennsylvania Supreme Court applied was a mandatory rule.\nThey said it's forfeited, no review whatsoever, and --\nand that would be the difference --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: By the trial court and\nby us, is that what you're --\nMR. LAWRY: Yes, yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: How would you fill in this\nsentence? I'm beginning where the Chief Justice did.\nSay everybody said: Look, this opinion is at least\nunclear. It's -- everybody agrees that the simple\nexistence of discretion does not make a State ground\ninadequate, so we send it back for you now. And you\nwill have some good arguments, I guarantee each side\nwill have some good arguments, as to whether they were\nbeing consistent or not, whether there was a consistent\nrule or not.\nMR. LAWRY: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Now, next sentence, which\nmaybe would never be written: This is not to say that\ndiscretion automatically means it's adequate, for it\ncould be applied inconsistently.\nNow, there could be another sentence,\nbecause that other sentence would have to go on to the\nfact that any discretionary rule will never be applied\nwith perfect consistency or anywhere near it. That\nwould be true if you give a trial judge the choice in\nhis discretion to waive a -- a time limit ruling.\nSome will do it with one. Some will do it\nin the other. You can't do it perfectly. So is there\nany sentence we could put in there? So you hedged on\nthere, and probably they will, too, because it's very\nhard to find the right sentence.\nYou don't want the simple application of\ndiscretion, you say -- which inevitably means some\ninconsistency, to make a State rule inadequate. On the\nother hand, they can't go too far. So what is too far?\nMR. LAWRY: Well, I would -- I would\nactually direct you to Judge Harlan's opinion in\nSullivan, where he says: \"A court has an obligation to\nbe reasonably consistent and to explain the decision,\nincluding the reason for according different treatment\nto the instant case.\" But that never happened --\nJUSTICE BREYER: But, but, but, but, but, a\ntrial Supreme Court -- a Supreme Court in a State is\nsupervising lots of trial courts, and you will have\ndifferent human beings sitting there as judges, and they\nwill inevitably be inconsistent with each other to some\ndegree. Have you not noticed that?\nMR. LAWRY: Certainly.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: So is there anything we can\nsay that will improve the situation? That's why I\nstarted out by saying maybe the best thing is to say\nnothing.\nMR. LAWRY: Well, the -- the key is really\nconsistent application and -- and looking to see whether\nthe rules are being turned off and on.\nLike I would -- I would point the Court to\nBarr v. City of Columbia, which I think is a very good\nexample, where there is maybe five people who make the\nsame objection, and four of them get merits review, and\nthe other person doesn't get merits review. Now, maybe\nthere's some explanation somewhere for that, but this\nCourt said: You know, this is not what we call\nadequacy; this is not consistent application.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, the problem --\nJustice Stevens' question brought this up. I mean, how\ndo you address that question if you don't have very many\napplications of the rule?\nMR. LAWRY: Well, it's certainly --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Say it's the first\none that comes up.\nMR. LAWRY: Well, it would certainly help to\ngive a -- a reasoned explanation of what's happening.\nThere -- you -- you're not --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but your\nreasoned explanation --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But all -- all those books\non our wall are the first time it's ever come up. I\nmean, that's how the law -- that's how the law is made.\nSo -- the whole point of the adequate independent State\nground, it seems to me, is part we don't want to affect\nrational conduct retroactively -- not applicable here.\nTwo, we don't want to have the State court use this as a\nsubterfuge or a device to avoid a Federal right. I\ndon't think that's applicable here. You might want to\nargue about that.\nSo it seems to me that the fact that it's a\ncompletely new rule in the case of an escape may mean it\nis still an adequate ground.\nMR. LAWRY: Well, I would -- I certainly\nwould argue that there -- there is every reason to see a\npotential for the State seeking to avoid Federal review.\nLook at the relaxed waiver cases in the attachment to\nthe brief. There are 51 cases over a 20-year period\nwhere the State courts reviewed every single issue on\nthe merits in a capital case, regardless of what\nhappened below.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And they concluded that was\nridiculous, so they stopped doing it.\nMR. LAWRY: But -- but during the time\nperiod, during the relevant time period in Mr. Kindler's\n-- from his escape all the way through his PCRA\nproceedings, that was the rule. And then they changed\nit, which is similar to -- to some of the other things\nthat we see in this case.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But those weren't escape\ncases. Were they all escape cases?\nMR. LAWRY: Oh, no. No.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, that's the point.\nWhy isn't escape sui generis, and how can we ever say\nthat?\nMR. LAWRY: Well, but -- but if you want to\nlook at what the Pennsylvania Supreme Court actually\nsaid here, they said Mr. Kindler's case is in the\ncategory like people who affirmatively waive. Okay,\nthat's what they said on direct appeal. Then you look\nin PCRA, on the PCRA appeal, and they don't treat him\nlike the people who affirmatively waive. That's not\nconsistent application.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You don't doubt that\nit would be an independent and adequate State rule to\nsay whenever anybody escapes they waive their claims?\nMR. LAWRY: That -- certainly, going forward\nthat's -- that's an adequate rule, yes.\nAnother -- another aspect --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, what's the interest\nin not applying this in this case? As you say, that's a\nfine rule. If you are a fugitive, you are out. You say\nthat wasn't the rule at the time he escaped. But you\nare not asserting any reliance interest by the escapee,\nthat, gee, if I knew that the rule was going to be\nmandatory, I wouldn't have a chance to appeal to the\ndiscretion, I wouldn't have escaped.\nThere is no -- there is no absence of notice\nthat -- that matters. I mean, if he had notice he would\nhave still escaped, I assume.\nMR. LAWRY: Yes, but the -- the issue here\nis not solely about notice to Mr. Kindler. There is an\nissue also about evasion of Federal review. That goes\nright back to Ward, in like 1920, talking about State\ncourts seeking to take away this Court's jurisdiction by\n--\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But you just said that it\nwould be okay to have a rule going forward that if you\nare a fugitive, you are out.\nMR. LAWRY: But that -- but that's if it's a\nfirmly established rule that is consistently. And\nthat's not what we see here. And let me give you\nanother example of that. Even in a noncapital case, the\nPennsylvania Supreme Court never held that a\npresentencing flight meant that the defendant would get\nno post-conviction review. They -- they affirmatively\nrejected that idea in Commonwealth v. Huff. But for\nMr. Kindler they said a presentencing flight means no\npost-conviction review. Put simply --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What is -- what is\nthe Federal fugitive rule?\nMR. LAWRY: The Federal fugitive rule is --\nthat was set in Ortega-Rodriguez -- says that a flight\npresentencing does not take away your appellate rights.\nIt says that the district court has discretion how it\nwould want to deal with that. It also --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Has discretion?\nMR. LAWRY: It has discretion. It says, you\nknow, the blunderbuss of dismissal is not -- is not an\nappropriate -- is not usually an appropriate device,\nbecause there are a lot of other things the district\ncourts can do short of taking away all appellate rights,\nno review by any court anywhere.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Does the discretion\nthat the Pennsylvania courts have here -- is that\nsimilar? Can the Pennsylvania Supreme Courts exercise\nthat discretion in a calibrated way, not all or nothing?\nMR. LAWRY: They -- they certainly could.\nThe -- one of the things that --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Were you still answering\nthe Chief Justice's -- I had -- had one more.\nMR. LAWRY: No.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I didn't mean to\ninterrupt.\nYou said there was no post-conviction\nreview. I -- I thought they in this case went on to\nask -- to exercise a limited review. They didn't reach\nthe Mills v. Maryland point, but they did give a limited\nreview to determine the sufficiency of the evidence,\nwhether the death penalty was a product of passion or\nprejudice, whether the evidence fails to support the\nfinding of the aggravating circumstance, whether the\nsentence was extensive or proportional. They did give\npost --\nMR. LAWRY: -conviction review.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- -conviction review on\nall those points.\nMR. LAWRY: Well, those were -- those were\ndirect appeal things that they looked at, yes. The --\nthe -- those are part of the statutory appellate review\nfor capital cases in Pennsylvania.\nAs far as I am aware, nobody has ever gotten\nrelief from that statutorily mandated direct appeal\nreview. But in post-conviction, they -- they gave no\nreview at all to the post-conviction claims, including\nthe ineffective assistance of counsel claim.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: There is a certain irony\nthat the case you're relying on on the merits is Mills,\nwhere if he hadn't escaped he would have gone through\nthe whole process before Mills was decided.\nMR. LAWRY: Well, but he may well have\ngotten relief anyway. He raised -- he actually raised\nan objection, a Mills-type objection at trial. It was\nraised in the post-verdict motions. It would presumably\nhave been raised on direct appeal. And -- and if it had\nbeen so raised on direct appeal he could have -- and he\ndidn't win on direct appeal, he could have sought\npost-conviction relief in Pennsylvania based on the fact\nthat Mills came down later, because the Pennsylvania\nretroactivity rule is that you can get retroactive\napplication of a decision if you -- if you objected. If\nyou raised the issue earlier and a new decision comes\ndown that would help you, you can raise that later.\nSo the idea of a windfall that was raised in\nthe Commonwealth's brief doesn't -- he didn't get a\nwindfall. He didn't get any review in State court, and\nthere's also of course the ineffective assistance of\ncounsel claim. The law has not changed on the\nineffective assistance of counsel claim.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, he got the\nwindfall of being free for eight years, right? I guess\nthat gets back to the point of your friend, which is he\nis in no worse position because he escaped and spent\neight years on the lam than if he had stayed in prison.\nMR. LAWRY: He is in much worse position.\nHe -- he just -- he just had all -- all review taken\naway in the State courts and --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, no. Obviously\nif the State prevails he's in a worse position. But\nunder your view, he's in this -- he's in no worse\nposition. He hasn't waived all his objections and\nclaims, procedures.\nMR. LAWRY: Well, there are certainly other\nthings that the State can do. They can -- they can\nprosecute him criminally for escape. There is\nadministrative confinement, those kinds of things. But\nthere is really --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Before or after his\nexecution?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. LAWRY: Well, there -- this -- this\nCourt said in Ortega-Rodriguez that -- that increasing\nsomebody's sentence by a number of years based on escape\nwould introduce an element of arbitrariness and\nirrationality, and -- and certainly changing the\nsentence from life to death based on disrespect to the\ncourts seems like a fairly -- a fairly serious\nconsequence.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I'm sorry, if\nI could just nail down the point. As far as his rights\nand proceedings in this case, he is in no worse position\nunder your theory having escaped and been out for\neight years than if he had stayed put?\nMR. LAWRY: In -- in Federal court if it's\nheld, as we argue, that the State court rulings were not\nadequate, that's true. And their argument is he should\nbe executed with no review by any court.\nI do want to return for a minute to relaxed\nwaiver because, you know, the primary argument that I\nheard was that in 1984 at the time of the escape that\nrelaxed waiver wasn't that firmly established. That's\nsimply not true. There are four decisions applying\nrelaxed waiver prior to 1984, and those decisions held\nthat a person who affirmatively waived a constitutional\nissue -- I see my time is up.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Finish your\nsentence.\nMR. LAWRY: There -- okay. There are four\ncases and in every case the Pennsylvania Supreme Court\ngave full merits review to all issues, even issues that\nwere only first raised at oral argument.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Can I please --\nMR. LAWRY: Sure.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why do you pick 1984 as the\ntime of the escape? Whether it's an adequate or\nindependent State ground, whether it's been consistently\napplied, it seemed to me -- it seems to me you should\nlook to the time at which the State rule is applied.\nNow, as of 1984 I suppose there are some\nnotice requirements that you can say due process\nrequires, but I don't know why the adequacy of the State\nground, whether it's consistently applied, should be\njudged on the basis of what was the law in 1984, rather\nthan what was the State law at the time they applied the\nrule.\nMR. LAWRY: Well, there -- there is a\nquestion about whether that is introducing a novel rule.\nBut -- but I was -- in the comments I was just making, I\nwas principally addressing the Commonwealth's argument\nthat relaxed waiver wasn't that well established in\n1984.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Eisenberg, you have four minutes.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF RONALD EISENBERG\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. EISENBERG: Mr. Lawry's answer to the\nquestion about a mandatory forfeiture rule, Your Honors,\nI think is the crucial one here. When asked whether an\nautomatic mandatory forfeiture rule would be adequate,\nhe said yes. And I think that's the problem with just\ntrying to remand this case without doing more, because\nthat's where you wind up.\nIf the lower Federal courts continue to\nundertake the kind of consistency analysis that they\nthink consistency requires, it will drive that sort of\ndiscretion out, and you will wind up with forfeiture\nrules and other State procedural rules that are all\nautomatic, because that's the way the Federal courts\nwill be telling the State courts that their rules will\nbe found adequate State grounds and enforceable on\nFederal habeas corpus review.\nThere was no subterfuge here the -- to avoid\nor evade the Federal question. The argument in favor of\nthat position is: Look at all the other cases where the\nState court did address Federal constitutional\nquestions. Well, exactly. Of course we did in many\nother capital cases. And the -- the penalty for trying\nto be lenient in those other cases is that now in the\nworst case we can't apply any sort of forfeiture, any\nsort of procedural bar, even for a guy who breaks out of\njail twice. The State court --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What -- what about his --\nhis colleague who broke out with him? How do you -- how\ndo you explain that.\nMR. EISENBERG: That defendant was gone less\nthan two weeks. And, so, we withdrew our motion to\nquash his appeal. It's not just that the State court\ndidn't grant it, we withdrew it because he was\nrecaptured in New York two weeks later.\nThis guy was out for seven years. After he\nwas captured the first time in Canada and started to\nfight extradition, his post verdict motions were\ndismissed. The motions that he had been -- and told him\nthat under state law at that time were absolutely\nessential to preserving any claim for further review,\nand his response to the dismissal of his post verdict\nmotions after the first escape was to break out of jail\nagain a second time.\nDuring the second escape, somebody died,\nanother prisoner fell to his death. During the first\nescape the plan, the diversion that allowed this\ndefendant to sneak out through the window he sought\nthrough was to have a riot staged on the part of the\nother prisoners, during which they tried to push one of\nthe prison guards off the third tier of the prison cells\nto the floor below. That would -- that caused all the\nother guards to rush up. During that time the defendant\nslipped out the window.\nThat's why this was the case where the court\nexercised its discretion to impose a procedural bar.\nMr. Lawry says, well, the Commonwealth just wants to\nexecute him without any sort of review.\nHe did have limited review, as Justice\nKennedy pointed out, but really you are left with only\nthe two choices of imposing a procedural bar, a bar that\nthis Court said was longstanding and well established in\nAmerican law in Estelle v. Dorrough --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask --\nMR. EISENBERG: -- or else leaving the\ndefendant better off than he would otherwise have been.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this question?\nWe have all been somewhat trouble because some ambiguity\nin the opinion below. What if we -- I think your\nopponent answered this question. What if we were to say\nthat the answer to the question presented, in italics in\nyour brief is no? And send it back to the court of\nappeals and tell them whether they -- that would change\ntheir decision or not.\nWould you agree that were a proper\ndisposition.\nMR. EISENBERG: No, Justice Stevens. I\nthink the reason the case is worth being here is to\nprovide greater guidance than to that provide to the\nlower courts. I think the reason so many States have\nweighed in on this question --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: The guidance you have\nasked us to give is whether there is this automatic\nrule. And if you say there isn't, doesn't that give\nguidance? And the answer -- wouldn't that -- that\nanswer the question on which there is a conflict among\nthe circuits?\nMR. EISENBERG: I'm afraid it doesn't -- it\ndoesn't help resolve the -- the path to which the Third\nCircuit got to that point. And that's really the\nunderlying problem.\nThere has been a lot of confusion about this\nCourt's adequate State grounds doctrine. Not, I would\nsuggest, so much in the results that this case -- that\nthis Court has reached, not in the kind of inadequacies\nthat this Court has found, which by and large deals with\nretroactivity or civil rights era cases where the courts\n-- the State courts were clearly discriminating against\nBlacks defendants in favor of White defendants.\nWe don't have anything like that here.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
