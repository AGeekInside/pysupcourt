        "content": "(10:02 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument\nfirst this morning in case 06-1286, Michael Knight,\nTrustee, v. the Commissioner of Internal Revenue.\nMr. Rubin.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF PETER J. RUBIN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. RUBIN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe question in this case is the meaning of\na statute that provides that, in arriving at a trust or\nestate's adjusted gross income, amounts are allowable in\nfull if they are -- and I quote here from 26 U.S.C.\nsection 67(e), which you can find at the bottom of page\n3a of the appendix to the blue brief -- \"costs which are\npaid or incurred in connection with the administration\nof the estate or trust and which would not have been\nincurred if the property were not held in such trust or\nestate.\"\nI'd like to make three broad points.\nFirst, when one applies the judicial tools\nof statutory interpretation, the statute can mean only\none thing. Second, \"would not\" does not mean \"could\nnot.\" The Commissioner's current reading of the statute\nand the Commissioner's previous readings of the statute\nare wrong. Indeed, the logic of the Commissioner's\nposition supports us. It acknowledges the distinctive\nnature of trusts and fiduciary obligations. Finally,\nour reading makes sense. It is consistent with the\ntreatment of trusts and estates elsewhere in the Code.\nIt puts in place an administrable rule that draws a\nclear line, and by contrast the Commissioner has\nprovided no reason at all why Congress would have wanted\nto subject the fees at issue here to the 2 percent\nfloor.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I think those three points\nare certainly what would help me. Could I ask just two\npreliminary questions? They don't necessarily have to\ndo with this case, just to get something straight. I\ntake it that you couldn't have claimed this deduction\nunder 162 without getting into an argument that it\nshould be capitalized and that's why 212 is in the Code?\nMR. RUBIN: Well, 212 and 162 are really\nsort of two sides of the same coin. 162 is for costs\nincurred in a trade or business, and there's no -- the\ntrust isn't engaged in a trade or business any more than\nan individual who invests for the protection of property\nis in a trade or business. 212, by contrast -- and the\ntext of 212 can be found in the governor's -- the\ngovernment's brief appendix at 5a -- 212 is about\nexpenditures for the preservation of property and for\nincome in that context. So that's why this is a 212,\nnot a 162.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: My other question is\nbackground only. Perhaps I should ask the government.\nAre 162 expenses subject to the 2 percent ceiling?\nMR. RUBIN: My recollection is that 162 --\n162 expenses are not subject to the -- they're not\nmiscellaneous itemized deductions.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, you agree\nthat as a taxpayer seeking an exception to a general\nrule, you have the burden of proof in this case?\nMR. RUBIN: No, Your Honor. We think that\n-- well, there are really two things built into your\nquestion, Mr. Chief Justice.\nFirst is the question of who bears the\nburden of proof in tax cases specifically, and as this\ncourt has made clear, this was litigated below on a\nslightly different theory. The government's theory has\nchanged during the pendency of the litigation. And\nbelow they argued that this was a common expense for\nindividuals; yet they introduced no evidence of that.\nAnd under the United States v. Janis, this Court's\ndecision in that case, they can't -- the government is\nrequired to come forward with something before assessing\ntax. But in terms of exceptions and rules, we can --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We can't take -- I\nguess it's not judicial notice, but we can't assume that\nindividual investors with several million dollars of\nliquid assets might hire investment advisors?\nMR. RUBIN: They might hire investment\nadvisors, Your Honor, but we don't think that --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do they usually hire\ninvestment advisors?\nMR. RUBIN: I don't think it's clear that\nthey usually hire investment advisors, but I think the\nimportant point here, in a way, is the premise of your\nquestion, which is that only certain trusts with certain\nassets, under a test that looked at what the\nCommissioner used to argue, which is commonality or\ncustomariness of a particular expense, only -- the\nCommissioner herself now argues that, that this test is\nunmanageable because there's difficulty in figuring out\nwhat the denominator of the fraction is. Do you mean\nall people? Is it common among everyone, among\ntaxpayers, among taxpayers with certain assets? Would a\n$100,000 trust have to be treated differently than a\nmillion dollar trust? Then there's the question of what\ndo you mean by \"common.\" You suggested \"usually\" or\n\"sometimes,\" \"might.\" That's not clear either. And\nthen ultimately there would have to be a trial somewhere\nto determine whether costs like this are indeed common\nto whatever standard was articulated. And I think this\nis why --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I guess you'd\nconcede, wouldn't you, that you're not entitled to all\nof the investment advice that you receive but perhaps\nonly that that is related to the trust status? In other\nwords, if your investment advisor charges you $50,000\nand, you know, 10,000 of it is unique to the trust, but\n40,000 is the same sort of advice he'd give an\nindividual, you'd only be able to get the 10,000 outside\nof the 2 percent limit?\nMR. RUBIN: We think, Your Honor, that all\ntrust investment fees are distinctive, that what renders\nthem distinctive and renders them fully deductible under\nthe statute is that they are incurred as a result of\ndistinctive fiduciary obligations. We think the statute\ndraws a line between costs like that, that are incurred\nas a result of distinctive fiduciary obligation, which\nwould include all investment management or advice fees,\nand by contrast costs that inhere in ownership of a\nparticular piece of property and that any owner of that\nproperty would have to pay.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I don't -- I don't\nreally see that line. I mean, let's -- let's take, you\nknow, fixing the roof on a house that's in the trust.\nAren't there distinctive trustee obligations with\nrespect to preservation of property, just as there are\nwith respect to preservation of financial assets?\nMR. RUBIN: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I think that's a very hard\nline to draw.\nMR. RUBIN: Yes, Your Honor. I think the\nline is -- is actually easier to draw than your question\nsuggests. I think that fixing a roof on a house might\nbe a cost that is close to the line. It may be that\nsome -- for example, if there were an ordinance in the\ncommunity that required upkeep of a house, we think that\nit would be subject to the 2 percent floor.\nThe archetypal example of a cost that we\nthink Congress intended and by this language we believe\nCongress rendered subject to the 2 percent floor are the\ncosts of pass-through entities that might be owned by\nthe trust or estate. So, for example, if there's an S\ncorporation and its management incurs an expense, that's\nreported back -- because the S corporation has no\nindependent existence, that's reported back to the\nowner, individual or trustee, and is reported as an\nadministrative expense. It would be subject to the 2\npercent floor from the individual who incurred it, and\nit would have been incurred, which is the language of\nthe statute, whether or not --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I'm still --\nMR. RUBIN: -- it was held in such trust or\n--\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I'm still trying to get\nback to my original question. I -- I would like to know\nwhat you think is not an expense that's distinctive to\n-- to a trust, other than fixing the roof, because you\nhaven't persuaded me on that.\nMR. RUBIN: The --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I think fixing a roof is\nfixing a roof.\nMR. RUBIN: The cost of -- not distinctive\ncosts would be the costs incurred by an S corporation\nowned by the trustee.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Anything else?\nMR. RUBIN: A condo fee, for example, that\nsimply essentially runs with the property. Whoever owns\nthis land is going to have to pay the condo fee.\nRequired insurance on a vehicle.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Isn't there a trustee\nobligation to pay all -- all expenses which if not paid\nwill -- would cause a depletion of the assets?\nMR. RUBIN: It's a question of --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Can't you say that that's a\ntrustee response -- I mean, if the criterion is he paid\nthis money only to discharge an obligation as a trustee,\nit seems to me all of his expenses are in that category,\nwith the possible exception of the S corporations you're\ntalking about.\nMR. RUBIN: Well, Your Honor, the costs are\ndistinctive in the case of -- of those things that are\ncaused by fiduciary obligation in the sense that we\ndescribe because that's how they are caused. These\ncosts are incurred without regard to that fiduciary\nobligation. They're paid perhaps because of fiduciary\nobligation, but they are incurred through ownership of\nthe property.\nAnd there is a hint in the text. If you\nlook at the text, you'll note that costs that are paid\nor incurred are deductible. But this asks about whether\nthey would have been incurred if the property were not\nheld in such trust or estate.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Rubin, you were not\nwilling to agree with the Chief when he said: Well,\nmaybe there are some investment expenses that are\nspecial because this is a trust. But there must be some\nthat any investor would incur. But you say it's got to\nbe all one way.\nMR. RUBIN: Yes, Justice Ginsburg. Trustees\ncannot under law, and do not, invest as individuals do.\nTo begin with, they always have to keep their eye on\ncurrent, future, contingent and remainder beneficiaries\nand treat them with equal fairness.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But they don't have\nto hire investment advisors. There is a standard that\nthey may think they can meet on their own. They may --\nyou know, it may be an investment advisor that is the\ntrustee. He doesn't have to hire somebody else.\nSo it's not something that necessarily\ninheres in the nature of the trust.\nMR. RUBIN: Whenever a trustee hires an\ninvestment advisor, it is to fulfill this fiduciary\nobligation. It is true that there may be a trustee who\nis expert in this.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why -- if I could\npause you on that, why is that the case? Let's say it's\na -- the trustee understands perfectly his obligations\nunder the law. Let's just say he is supposed to\npreserve capital and invest conservatively, but he wants\nadvice on which is the best conservative investment.\nYou know, is it railroads or is it\nutilities? And that's the investment advice he seeks --\njust that. He says: I know how I'm supposed to invest\nas a fiduciary, but there are options in there, and I\njust want advice on the options.\nMR. RUBIN: Yes, Your Honor. I think that\nthat is actually quite a typical situation. The\ntrustee, of course, knows his or her obligations. It's\nhis or her inability to figure out how to fulfill them\nthat --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, isn't that\njust like an individual investor? If you have an\nindividual investor with $10 million in liquid assets,\nhe or she might know what he wants to do, either capital\nappreciation or preservation, you know, whatever the\noption is, but just wants some advice on how best to go\nabout that. That sounds exactly like the trustee in our\nhypothetical.\nMR. RUBIN: Well, Your Honor, there are\nunique obligations. Some of these are set out in\nConnecticut statutes. This is in our brief at page 7 of\nthe blue brief. There are ten considerations that\nConnecticut law requires trustees to examine, including\nthings unique to trusts: the nature of the trust, its\nduration. The need for liquidity or income versus\ncapital, which is principal growth versus income, is a\nuniquely trustlike concern.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No. No. No. You\nsee, that's my difficulty with your position. It's not\nuniquely trust because you certainly have individuals\nwho may want income rather than capital appreciation or,\nyou know, preservation of capital. They may have\nexactly the same objectives as a trustee. It's not\nunique to the trust.\nMR. RUBIN: It -- I guess I have two answers\nto that, Your Honor. It may, by happenstance, be that\nout of the black box of investment advice an individual,\nby happenstance, gets the same advice as a trust\nsomewhere; but it would be by happenstance. The\ndecisional process leading to obtaining the advice,\nincurring the cost, is distinct for trust, and indeed\nthe advice they receive is distinct.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, it seems to me that\nthat just simply couldn't have been Congress's purpose\nin passing this statute because now you have a recipe\nfor avoidance. In most States -- California has a rule\nthat the trustee has to make prudent business\ninvestments. I assume a great number of businessmen\noutside the trust context think that they have their\nprincipal objective of making prudent business\ninvestments. But under your theory all expenses for\nthat objective would fall within this exclusion. I just\ndon't think that's what the Congress could possibly have\nintended.\nMR. RUBIN: Well, Your Honor, to begin with,\nthere is no risk here of tax avoidance through creation\nof a trust. These are non-grantor trusts. There are\nsubstantial costs involved in creating them, but, among\nother things, the top bracket of 35 percent --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, is that true just in\nyour case?\nMR. RUBIN: No --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Universally, there is\nnever a danger of tax avoidance? You want us to write\nthe decision on the assumption that tax avoidance is\nnever a problem in the creation of a trust?\nMR. RUBIN: Well, the Commissioner concedes\nat page 37 of her brief that there is no substantial\nproblem of income- splitting through the use of\nnon-grantor trusts; and, indeed, throughout --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Is that true? And I'm\nlooking at testimony given by J. Roger Mintz in 1986\nwhen this measure was before Congress, and in that\nwritten testimony is the statement: \"First, the\ntreatment of trusts as separate taxpayers with a\nseparate, graduated rate schedule can cause income to be\ntaxed at a rate lower than if the grantor had retained\ndirect ownership of the trust assets or given the assets\noutright to the beneficiaries.\"\nSo apparently the Treasury was telling the\nCongress that there is a problem.\nMR. RUBIN: Yes, Justice Ginsburg. That\nproblem was solved in Section 1 of 26 U.S. Code -- and\nthis is described at page 37 of our brief -- by a\ncompression of the tax brackets. The 35 percent bracket\nkicks in for non-grantor trusts at $10,500. For an\nindividual it kicks in at $349,000. As a consequence,\nthere is no incentive to move money into a trust in\norder to avoid taxation at a -- at a lower rate.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. I am not sure\nwhat you mean by \"non-grantor trusts.\" What is a\n\"non-grantor trust\"?\nMR. RUBIN: A non-grantor trust is a real\ntrust with economic substance. A grantor trust is a\ntrust in which the grantor retains certain powers, for\nexample it's revocable, or whatever; and it's treated as\n-- people set them up for estate- planning purposes, but\n--\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Every trust has a grantor,\nI assume.\nMR. RUBIN: Yes, yes, yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So a \"non-grantor trust\" --\nMR. RUBIN: But this is -- I guess this is a\nterm of art.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- is a trust without any\nmoney.\nMR. RUBIN: Yes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: A grantor trust would be\none of those pass-throughs.\nMR. RUBIN: Yes. And, indeed, this, I think\n-- and part of the answer to Justice Kennedy's question:\nThe problem of tax avoidance was dealt with in section\n67)(c), where entities like that were -- were said to be\ntreated as pass-through entities with no independent\nexistence. But trusts and estates were excepted\nspecifically from that because of this absence of risk\nof income-splitting. And, indeed, we think that the --\nthe structure of the statute, not merely its text, but\nthe structure of the statute, indicates that this is\nwhat Congress intended.\nIt's not -- it's not written the way I would\nhave written it, Your Honor. But none of the other\nreadings are textually even supportable, and this --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this sort of\nelementary question, and it may reveal my stupidity.\nBut actually sometimes these costs are incurred by\nindividuals, and sometimes they're not. But -- so that\nyou would normally think there's going to be a\ncase-by-case analysis of what happened in the particular\ncase.\nBut do I understand correctly that both you\nand the government take the position that we should\napply the same rule across the board regardless of the\nactual facts?\nMR. RUBIN: I wouldn't say \"regardless of\nthe actual facts,\" Your Honor. But I would say this:\nWe believe it's a categorical test.\nThe first of what the Commissioner calls her\ntextually plausible readings is literally a case-by-case\nexamination of what would have happened with this\nproperty if it were held by whomever, the beneficiary,\nthe grantor, it's not clear whom. And, as they\ndescribed, Congress can't have meant that. And this\nwould be an imponderable. How would you ever --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: That's the most normal\nreading of the language, it's a case-by-case test. It\nseems to me the -- probably the most unwise reading,\nalso.\nMR. RUBIN: Well, Your Honor, I think -- I\nsee your point. And I think this is why, if you look at\nthe structure of Section 67, which treats pass-through\nentities but not trusts and estates as presenting a risk\nof income-splitting; if you look at the Code more\nbroadly, which permits deductions by trusts and estates\nin many circumstances -- section 68 does; section 154\ndoes -- when they're not permitted by individuals and\nespecially when you look at the statutory history\nhere --\nBoth houses of Congress -- well, this was\npreexisting law, I should begin by saying. And then\nboth houses of Congress passed in the '86 Act this\nstatute without the second clause.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I've read the legislative\nhistory, which shows to me, anyway, precisely no light\nwhatsoever. It's -- the only relevant sentence, which\nis the third sentence, simply repeats the statute. And,\ntherefore, I thought that what Congress is trying to do\nis say, treat trusts like individuals, except in respect\nto special expenses.\nWhat are special expenses? Those that\nare related to the trust and that an individual wouldn't\nhave occurred -- incurred. I can't say it much clearly\nthan that. But I have an absolutely clear idea what it\nmeans. To me it means that if this is an expense that\nthe trust is saying is special, I would say, would a\nreasonable person who did not hold these assets in\ntrust, would such a person be likely to make that kind\nof expenditure?\nAnd if the answer to that question is yes,\nwell, then I would say it's not a special expense. And\nif the answer is no, I would say it was.\nAnd then the IRS and you will come and say\nthat isn't precise enough. And I'd say the IRS has\nplenty of authority in its regs to give lists of\nexamples which they do in such instances.\nNow, I'm posing that, not because I bought\ninto it, though I'm tempted to, but I'd like to know\nwhat your response is.\nMR. RUBIN: Well, Your Honor, I guess my\nresponse is severalfold. To begin with, the statute\ndoesn't ask what usually happens on the outside or\ncommonly or customarily, and indeed the Commissioner has\nabandoned this reading of the statute precisely because\nit presents the kind of imponderables that I was\ndiscussing with the Chief Justice: What is usually\ndone? Do trusts of different sizes have different\nrules? When a trust's assets come below a certain\npoint, what about that? And most importantly, it's not\nin the text of the statute.\nNow, the Commissioner concedes the\ndistinctive nature of trusts. And if you look at the\nexamples that she gives on page 23 of her brief of what\nit is that, that is deductible in full, it's the same as\nthis: Fiduciary income tax preparation. Well,\npeople -- many people get income tax preparation for\nindividual income tax returns. The only difference is\nit's a Form 1040 or a Form 1041.\nOur case is much further from the line than\nthat because the investment advice must be tailored to\nthese, to these rules under Connecticut law.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay. Well, then\nlet's take that. Let's suppose that the trustee goes to\nan investment advisor, doesn't tell him that he is a\ntrustee, just says, I need to know, I can't decide,\nshould I invest in Union Pacific or CSX? I'm going to\ninvest in a railroad; which one do you like better? He\ndoesn't tell him he's a trustee, gets some advice and\ngets a bill. Is that subject to the 2 percent floor,\nbecause presumably the advice has got nothing to do with\nfiduciary responsibilities?\nMR. RUBIN: If it has nothing to do with\nfiduciary responsibilities, Your Honor, we think it\nwould be a breach of fiduciary obligation to get --\nwaste the trust money paying for the advice and to act\nupon it.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Oh, no. It's a\nreasonable -- let's say a railroad stock is a reasonable\ninvestment for a trust. He just wants to know which one\nis the best one.\nMR. RUBIN: We think that this is intended\nas a categorical rule. And we think that asking that\nquestion is in furtherance of these unique obligations\nand the prudent investor standard, which is not -- this\nis a new standard that's developed in the United States\nover the next decade or so. It is not merely what a\nprudent man would do under the old Harvard College v.\nAmory common law test.\nInvestments that individuals can and do\ninvest in are not open to trustees who have a series of\nrules, some of which are counterintuitive, in fact,\nabout what they can do. And these are listed at pages 7\nto 10 of our brief. But that -- what you're describing\nwe think is investment advice and if it's properly\nobtained it is distinctive.\nI should say also in response --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How can it be\ndistinctive if the advisor doesn't even know that the\nperson's a trustee?\nMR. RUBIN: Well, the question is the\ndecisional process of the trustee. When the trustee\ncalls up anyone, the income tax preparer, and says I'd\nlike to hire you, he doesn't have to say at the moment\nof hiring it's for a trust.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, when it's\nfilled out --\nMR. RUBIN: He'll figure it out --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- he knows it's on\nForm 1041 rather than 1040.\nMR. RUBIN: He will eventually come to know\nthat the form is different, Your Honor, yes. But I\ndon't think the subjective knowledge of the person from\nwhom one gets the advice is the question. The question,\nI think, is textually directed to the incurment of the\ncost.\nAnd I should say also in part of response to\npart of Justice Breyer's question, the statutory history\nisn't merely the legislative history. It's the fact\nthat, despite having just the first prong in it when it\nwas passed by both houses of Congress, there was a floor\namendment in the Senate on the day that it passed the\nSenate that dealt with pass-throughs. The first part of\n67(c), and the changes made in the conference committee,\nagain as the Commissioner acknowledges at page 37 of her\nbrief, the changes made in conference, including the\naddition of this, were to deal precisely with how should\nwe deal with pass-throughs and trusts, and trust\nownership of pass-throughs --\nJUSTICE BREYER: There's nothing that I\ncould find anywhere that talked about pass-throughs in\nrespect to the special situation of trusts and estates.\nIn the first sentence it speaks to it in respect to\nindividuals. It all makes sense. And what they seem to\nbe saying is just what I said initially. We do agree\ntrusts do have a special claim, but only in respect to\nspecial trust expenses. And which are they? They're\nthe ones an individual wouldn't have incurred.\nAnd I'll put a gloss on it, like we do in\nlaw. I say a reasonable individual. I say wouldn't\nreasonably have incurred. And then I leave it up to the\nIRS to say which are the expenses that an individual\nwould likely incur and which ones he wouldn't likely\nincur.\nNow, that runs throughout tax law, doesn't\nit, that kind of list, what's a necessary expenditure,\nwhat isn't. I mean, they do that all the time, don't\nthey?\nMR. RUBIN: Yes, Your Honor. Regulations,\nhowever, have to be both reasonable --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Not buying into they're\nthing with \"could.\" I mean, that isn't my problem.\nMR. RUBIN: Okay. If they drew a list of\nwhat are the distinct trust costs, it would have to\ninclude, if it includes fiduciary, income tax\npreparation or, better yet, judicial accounting,\nindividual duties in the case of guardianships and so\non. This is of the same caliber and at the same level\nof generality we think would have to be covered.\nJUSTICE ALITO: But have they issued a\nregulation drawing up this list at this point?\nMR. RUBIN: There's only a proposed\nregulation, Your Honor. And we believe that because\ntheir readings are not textually supportable, are\nunadministratable and aren't what Congress intended,\nthat after applying the ordinary tools of statutory\nconstruction, there is only one meaning that this text\ncan have.\nI'd like to respond to --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Why is it not\nadministerable? Whether you think it's a faithful\nrendition of the statute is one thing, but this is\nexactly what Justice Breyer was talking about. It says\nthese are the things that are special to the trust, and\nthen these are the things that are not. That's what the\nproposed reg does, right?\nMR. RUBIN: Yes, Your Honor. It is -- it's\na little bit of a moving target but it does say that.\nIf those are nonexhaustive lists and the difficulty of\nallocating these costs of attributing them to one thing\nor another, putting in place systems that trustees that\ncharge unitary fees, which is what corporate trustees\ndo, is enormous. And some of this can be seen in the\ncomments, the public comments to the regulation, some\nexcerpts of which are included in the appendix to our\nreply brief.\nBut this is not a simple test. And indeed,\nthe Commissioner essentially concedes that, saying that\nshe would need to have safe harbors or some other\nunprincipled line because of the difficulty.\nI'd like to reserve the balance of my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Rubin.\nMr. Miller.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC D. MILLER\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. MILLER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nSection 67(e) creates a narrow exception to\nthe 2 percent floor for costs which would not have not\nhave been incurred if the property were not held in\ntrust.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: It wasn't narrow in the\nbeginning, right?\nMR. MILLER: Well, that's correct, Your\nHonor. The second clause was added in a floor\namendment. Initially Congress had drafted just the\n\"which are paid\" -- \"which are incurred or paid in\nconnection with the administration of the estate or\ntrust.\" Then the second clause was added. And that\nclause demands that the costs would not have been\nincurred if the property were not held --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: This is somewhat of a\nmystery, the wording of that clause. And since it came\nin at the very last minute, isn't it appropriate to give\nit a limited reading, rather than, in your suggestion,\nthat this provision that up until the very end read just\nadministration, \"costs paid or incurred in connection\nwith the administration of the estate or trust,\"\nperiod? And then there was this add-on. Why should we\ngive that an expansive meaning?\nMR. MILLER: I think, regardless of the\ntiming, Your Honor, Congress chose to enact it and that\nchoice has to be given effect. And I think when you\nlook at the way that the section as a whole is set up,\n67(e), the first introductory clause creates the general\nprinciple that for purposes of this section the adjusted\ngross income of an estate shall be computed in the same\nmanner as in the case of an individual, except that, and\nthen there is clause one.\nSo in the context of this section, we have a\ngeneral rule and then an exception. And that ought to\nbe interpreted in light of the usual principle that\nexceptions, particularly ambiguous exceptions, should\nnot be construed so as to swallow up the entirety of the\nrule, which is essentially what Petitioner's\ninterpretation would do.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why do you think that the\nonly instances where the expense would not have occurred\nare those instances where it could not have occurred?\nThat doesn't strike me as self-evident.\nI mean, I understand why you do it, so that\ncan you have a nice clear line, which I am all for. But\nthe line given by your colleague is just as clear. I\ndon't know why I should accept yours when -- I mean,\n\"would\" just does not mean \"could.\" I mean, would have,\ncould have, should have, it's -- they're different\nwords.\nMR. MILLER: Well, they are -- they're\ncertainly different words. We're not suggesting that\nthey are synonyms. But we are suggesting that there are\ncontexts in which the word \"would\" can carry the same\nmeaning that is also expressed through the word \"could.\"\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Give me a context where --\nwhere -- other than this statute, where in common\nparlance people use \"would\" to mean \"could.\"\nMR. MILLER: Another example would be if I\nwere to say that that glass would not hold more than 8\nounces of water, that would mean that it could not hold\nmore than 8 ounces of water.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No, I don't think it would\nmean that.\nJUSTICE BREYER: A glass --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Anything that could not be\ndone of course would not be done. But that doesn't mean\nthat the -- that the two words mean the same thing.\nMR. MILLER: But --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's true that one is\nincluded within the other, but they don't mean the same\nthing.\nMR. MILLER: Would -- I think that the\nunadorned use of the word \"would\" here --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What could not happen would\nnot happen, of course. But it doesn't mean that -- the\ntwo concepts are not the same.\nMR. MILLER: I think, when -- when you have\nthe word \"would,\" as we have in this statute, that's not\nqualified in any way, it's ambiguous in the sense that\nit can mean definitely would not have been incurred,\nprobably would not have been incurred, customarily,\nordinarily would not have been incurred, which is the\nmeaning --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You didn't think\nmuch of this argument before the Second Circuit adopted\nit, did you? You didn't argue this before the Court of\nAppeals?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. MILLER: We did not argue it before --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you have a\nfallback argument.\nMR. MILLER: Well, that -- that's right.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, now might be a\ngood time to fall back.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: Before -- I mean, we have\nlots of good examples. I mean, I could have colored my\nroom at home, painted it with light green plastic, but I\nwouldn't have done it. I mean, endless examples.\nMR. MILLER: Right. And certainly the\nstatute also admits of the reading given to it by the\nFourth and Federal Circuits, which is that \"would not\nhave been incurred\" means customarily or ordinarily\nwould not have been incurred by individuals.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: If we can rush to the\nfallback position, is it acceptable to have a test that\nsays would the expense have been incurred if the\nnontrust business wanted to achieve an objective that\nthe trust wanted to achieve here, fixing the roof?\nMR. MILLER: I -- I think that that raises\nthe question of what is the relevant comparison group\nfor -- for individuals outside of the trust side of it.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And I think the structure\nof the statute requires us to -- to do that.\nMR. MILLER: That's right. And -- and we\nwould suggest that the relevant comparison is\nindividuals with -- with similar assets, right, because\nit's in the absence of a trust, not if the property did\nnot exist. So you have to look at an individual who\nheld those assets outright, and an individual with those\nassets trying to achieve those goals might well seek\ninvestment advice.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Will, you give as an example\nof something that wouldn't fall within the 2 percent\nfloor the cost of preparing and filing a fiduciary\nincome tax return. What is the difference between that\nand getting fiduciary investment advice?\nMR. MILLER: The -- the difference is --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Just because it's a\ndifferent form that's filled out?\nMR. MILLER: What --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Is it more expensive to --\nto fill out a 1041 than to fill out the 1040?\nMR. MILLER: It's more expensive because\nit's an additional cost. If an individual were to hold\nthe property outright, he or she would simply put the\nincome from that property on his own 1040. If in\naddition there is a trust, then the trust has to fill\nout a 1041, the trust also has to prepare Form K-1s and\nsend them out both to the beneficiaries and to the IRS,\nshowing the beneficiaries' share of the trust income,\nand then the individual still has to file a 1040. So\nthe existence of the trust has created this whole\nadditional set of filing and reporting obligations.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but it's the\nindividual who has to file the 1040. What the trustee\nis filing is the 1041. And -- and why do you place -- I\nwas going to ask the same question that Justice Alito\ndid, and that is why do you place so much significance\neither in the label, i.e., it's fiduciary return, or in\nthe peculiar fact that it is a fiduciary who is filing\nthat return?\nIt's a tax return and -- and I think your --\nthe government's argument is that with respect to -- to\nother items that may be disputed, you should regard them\nat a fairly general level, i.e., investment advice, not\nfiduciary investment advice. But when you come to the\ntax return, you don't regard it as a general -- at a\ngeneral level; you regard it at a very specific level,\ni.e., a fiduciary tax return. It seems to me that the\ngovernment with respect to the tax return is doing\nexactly what it criticizes the taxpayer for doing with\nrespect to investment advice. And I don't understand\nthe distinction.\nMR. MILLER: With respect to the tax return,\nit's not that it's a fiduciary tax return as opposed to\nan individual tax return; it's that it's an extra tax\nreturn that has to be filed.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, it's the only tax\nreturn that the fiduciary has to file; isn't that\ncorrect? The fiduciary files that tax return and the\nbeneficiary files a 1040.\nMR. MILLER: That's right, but if the\nbeneficiary --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But the only return the\nfiduciary's filing is the 1041; isn't that right?\nMR. MILLER: That's the only -- but in that\n-- in the system of the beneficiary and the fiduciary\nthere are two tax returns that have to be filed, whereas\n--\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay; I understand that\nthat is a factual difference, but I don't understand\nwhat it is that makes that a difference in principle.\nMR. MILLER: I think that -- that's an extra\nobligation that would not have been incurred in the\nabsence of the trust. And I think, turning to the case\nof investment advice, I think there is really no level\nof generality or particularity at which one can look at\ninvestment advice such that there is anything unique\nabout trust investment advice.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, can't you ask it --\ncan't -- can't you ask this question pointing towards\nsomething unique: If the individual investor does a\nvery poor job of managing his investments, all he can\nultimately do is cry about it. But if the trustee does\na very poor job, the trustee is going to get sued. So\nthat when the trustee asks for an investment advisor's\nadvice, the trustee is addressing an issue that the\nindividual does not have. The trustee wants to be\ncovered. He also, I presume, wants to be a good\ntrustee. But he is in fact doing something which is, to\nuse your phrase, in addition to what the individual\ninvestor would do. He is looking out for somebody else\nand he is looking out for himself if the investment goes\nsouth. Why isn't that a sufficient difference that is\nat least comparable to the difference that you talk\nabout in the filing of a fiduciary tax return?\nMR. MILLER: It's not a difference, because\nif the individual invests poorly he'll lose money. And\nif the -- and he'll lose his own money. If the\nfiduciary invests poorly he may get sued and the measure\nof damages in that suit will be the amount of money he\nlost. So they're both facing the possibility of losing.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but whether -- whether\nhe gets socked with damages or not is going to depend in\npart whether he is covered by an investment advisor's\nbit of advice; and that is -- that is a different item\nin the calculus of liability. He is providing for\nsomething that the individual investor does not provide\nfor or need to provide for.\nMR. MILLER: Well, the -- the standard of\nconduct that is supposed to govern the fiduciary is the\nprudent investor rule, which looks at what a reasonable\nprudent individual would do in managing his own money so\nI think that --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I have the same\nproblem. You know, I -- it seems to me that it is\nentirely reasonable to say only a trustee can seek\ninvestment advice concerning what he should do to\nfulfill his responsibilities under the trust. Only a\ntrustee can do that. A private individual might seek\ninvestment advice as to how he could maximize the income\nor -- or the growth of the funds that he has, but\nonly -- only a trustee seeks advice as to how he can\nfulfill his responsibilities under the trust. And you\ncould say that's distinctive. No individual would do\nthat because he's not a trustee.\nMR. MILLER: But there's no distinction in\nthat case in the -- in the fee that's charged or in the\nadvice that's given by the investment advisor. In\neither case somebody goes to the advisor and says, I\nhave the following goals that I want to achieve with\nthis money. It may be my money; it may be a trust's\nmoney. And the advisor thinks about those goals and\ncomes up with -- with investment advice. And those\ngoals --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It may -- it may well be\nthe same advice, but in -- but in one case it is -- it\nis advice sought by and given to a trustee, a unique\nkind of advice. In -- in substance, it may turn out to\nbe the same; but it's not the same advice you're giving\nto a private individual. You're saying here's the trust\ninstrument and here are the objects to be achieved by\nthe trust instrument and this is the -- the advice that\nwill best do that. That doesn't happen with an\nindividual.\nMR. MILLER: I mean, but for the fact that\nthe word \"trust\" is in there, I think the substance of\nthe interaction with the investment advisor is exactly\nthe same.\nJUSTICE ALITO: But doesn't your proposed\nregulation concede that there is investment advisory\nadvice that is unique to -- to estates and trusts?\nIsn't that what subparagraph C says?\nMR. MILLER: No. Subparagraph C has two\nlists, both of which are nonexclusive: a list of items\nthat are unique to trusts and a list of items that are\nnot unique to trusts. In the list of items that are not\nunique to trusts is investing for total return. There\nis no type of investment advice --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Why that limitation? Why\nwouldn't it say just \"investment advice,\" but it's --\ninvesting for total return is more limited?\nMR. MILLER: I think perhaps because that's\nmost obviously the type of advice that is not unique to\ntrusts. But the -- the proposed regulation does not\nidentify any kind of advice that is unique to trusts.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: It doesn't say it's one\nor the other. So it's not so sure, right? It's sure\nabout advice on investing for total return.\nMR. MILLER: And --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: In other words, the\nregulation, the proposed regulation, doesn't answer this\ncase of investment advice in general as opposed to\nadvice on investing for total return.\nMR. MILLER: You're right that the\nregulation in terms of the enumeration in subsection (b)\nis silent on the question of other types of --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Can you really spice up\nadvice that way? You ask the advisor, say, which --\nwhat percentage of your advice was the advice that went\nto maximizing total return and what percentage went to\nthis other thing? I mean, gee, I don't want to get\ncourts into trying to figure that out, or private\nindividuals or financial advisors in trying to figure\nthat out. That's just a crazy way to run a tax system,\nit seems to me.\nMR. MILLER: I think that's right, and\nthat's why I think that the -- despite the fact that\ninvesting for total return is the only example given in\nthe list, which, again, is described as not exclusive.\nI think the best reading of the proposed regulation is\n--\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But that's not all advice.\nThat's just some of the advice, right?\nMR. MILLER: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Now, what about the rest of\nit? How do you slice up, you know -- now, investment\nadvisor, tell me what percentage of your advice went to\nthe total return and what percentage went to other\nthings. I don't think the investment advisor is going\nto be able to tell you.\nMR. MILLER: I think the best reading of the\nproposed regulation, and perhaps the Service may well\nclarify this during the rule-making process, is that all\nadvice is not unique to trusts because there's no type\nof advice that a trustee could seek that an individual\ncould not --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: They certainly weren't\nsure about it when they drafted this regulation,\nproposed regulation.\nMR. MILLER: Well, it is -- it's just a\nproposal, again, and I think they picked what's perhaps\nthe most obvious.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But in other categories,\nthey express no such limitation. Custody or management\nof property, not qualified. And they -- but when you\nget to investing, it has that total return. Everything\nelse has got maintenance, repair, insurance.\nMR. MILLER: That's right. And there's also\na fairly extensive list of nonexclusive -- of nonunique\nproducts or services, and that does not include any\nother type of investment advice. So I think what one\ncan draw the opposite inference from that list, but in\nany event, that's something that could be clarified in\nthe rule-making process.\nReturning to --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So how does your\ncustomary or commonly incurred test work? Let's say you\nhave two trusts, one $10 million, the other 10,000. I\nthink an individual with $10 million might well seek\ninvestment advice, but an individual with only 10,000\nmight decide it's not worth it. Would you have a\ndifferent application of the 2 percent rule for those\ntwo trusts?\nMR. MILLER: I think if the test is whether\n-- whether the individuals would have -- would commonly\nordinarily incur that cost, I think one might well look\nat that because the comparison would be individuals with\nsimilar assets, and, as Your Honor knows, there might be\na difference depending on the size.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How many -- how many\nindividuals do you need? Let's say it's $3 million in\nthe trust, and we think maybe 60 percent of people would\nhire an investment advisor; 40 percent would think they\ncan do just as well on their own. Is that customarily\nincurred by individuals?\nMR. MILLER: I think it might well be enough\nthat -- for something that the Service could clarify\nthrough --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Your answer to both\nquestions is \"might well be,\" and that's a fairly vague\nline when it comes to taxes.\nMR. MILLER: The --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And whatever line you --\nyou pick, I guarantee you, trusts are going to break\nthemselves up into mini-trusts that fall under the line.\nI mean people aren't stupid.\n(Laughter.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Or, even worse,\nadvisors are going to break themselves up into different\nadvisors. There's going to be somebody who says I'm a\nfiduciary advisor whenever a trustee calls, but, I'm a\nnormal advisor, when it's an individual.\nMR. MILLER: I think the difficulty in\napplying that test is one of the reasons why we suggest\nthat the categorical -- the more categorical approach,\nwhich we think is also a permissible reading of the\nstatute, is the preferable one. But, in either event,\nif the test is customarily or ordinarily incurred, it\nwas Petitioner's obligation in the tax court to show\nthat they qualified for the exemption from the 2 percent\nfloor. And so it would be Petitioner's burden to show\nthat this is a cost not that's customarily or ordinarily\nincurred by individuals.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What's your best\ncase for that proposition? Your colleague resisted the\nnotion that he had the burden and what's your best case\nfor that?\nMR. MILLER: It's not a case, but it's the\nrule. Tax Court Rule 142 places the burden of proof on\nthe taxpayer. Petitioner sites --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But I thought that\nrule applied to the applicability of individual\nexemptions. Here we have a different question. It's\nhow to read an exception to the general rule. Do you\nhave a case for a proposition that the taxpayer has the\nburden in those cases? You said that in your brief, but\nit didn't have a case cite with it.\nMR. MILLER: No. We don't have a case, but\nthe rule is unqualified in terms of its applicability.\nIt doesn't say only on particular issues. And the case\nthat Petitioner cites is United States against Janis,\nwhich is about a \"naked\" assessment, which is far\nremoved from what we have here.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Are you saying --\nMR. MILLER: A \"naked\" assessment is --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Are we saying, as a\nquestion of law, the taxpayer has the burden of proof?\nIf it isn't a question of proof, it isn't a question of\nevidence?\nMR. MILLER: No. I was referring to\nquestions of fact. I understood the question to be if\nthe legal test turns on the factual question of what is\nit, what is customary or ordinary for individuals to\nincur, then on that fact, that would be a factual issue.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, what would -- that's\nwhy I made the suggestion I had earlier. I was doubtful\nabout the wisdom of trying to turn this matter into a\npurely factual one. And so suppose you said, which\nwould come to about the same thing, that expenditure\nwould be incurred in this instance by someone who didn't\nhold these assets in trust. What that means is would a\n-- an investor not in the trust, not holding it in\ntrust, reasonably have been, or a reasonable investor\nhave been likely to make this expenditure? That turns\nit into a more quasi-legal question where people -- and\nthen it's a matter of judgment, which these things do\ncome down to. That's what judges are there for, to\njudge. And thereby we avoid the burden-of-proof\nproblem. It comes to about the same thing. Is there\nany objection to it? What's the reason not to do it?\nMR. MILLER: If that is the test, then it's\nvery easy to apply to the case of investment advice,\nbecause we know that the trustee's obligation is to act\nas a reasonable and prudent individual would. And so we\nknow that if -- to the extent that the trustee seeks\ninvestment advice in pursuance of that obligation --\nJUSTICE BREYER: But are you --\nMR. MILLER: -- that would --\nJUSTICE BREYER: You would be, of course,\nexactly right, that there could be trusts, very big\ntrusts. Children get into fights trying to split up the\nassets. Millions is paid on lawyers and investment\nadvisors to see if each share, figured 14 different\nways, is going to earn this money or that money. And\nthat kind of thing exists. And there the investment\nadvisors are likely to be special. So you can't say\ninvestment advice is always special or never special.\nNow, again, this seems to me not unknown,\nthis kind of problem, to the Internal Revenue law, and\ntherefore there tend to be methods of allowing\nexceptions, of putting burdens. I mean, is this case\nsomehow -- am I wrong about that?\nMR. MILLER: I think that to the extent that\nyou're suggesting that the Service could be -- could\nclarify the statute through the use of regulations, we\ncertainly agree with that. The service has the ability\nto resolve some of the ambiguities.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I'm looking really for a\nform of words to write that does not use the word\n\"could\" but which gets at what I think the statute was\nafter, which is: Let them have this no floor for their\nspecial stuff but not for ordinary stuff that others\nwould have incurred regardless. I want to know what\nform of words. I find it difficult to go beyond the\nstatute, frankly.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I think \"would not have\noccurred\" is pretty good --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- actually.\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's right. That's\nright.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. MILLER: The -- the formulation that the\nService has proposed of course is to look at costs that\nare unique to --\nJUSTICE BREYER: If I reject this word\n\"could\" and \"uniqueness,\" now what form of word should I\nwrite?\nMR. MILLER: I think \"ordinarily\" or\n\"customarily\" is also a permissible interpretation of --\nJUSTICE BREYER: If had you to choose\nbetween that and getting the idea of the reasonable\ntaxpayer who didn't hold this in trust, which would you\nchoose?\nMR. MILLER: I think they are actually very\nsimilar inquiries, because we expect that the reasonable\nperson is the ordinary person. So I think in practice,\nthose formulations get you to the --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: It almost sounds like\nordinary and necessary under 162?\nMR. MILLER: Well, ordinary and necessary\nunder -- I mean here we are talking about -- as\nMr. Rubin said, it's under 212.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: 212. I understand that.\nMR. MILLER: It's not in connection with a\ntrade or business. Ordinary and necessary in that\ncontext means simply that it's a legitimately connected\nto the production of income. That's a requirement for\nit to be deductible at all.\nJUSTICE ALITO: It seems to me the\ndifficulty is in characterizing the level of generality\nat which you describe the cost, not whether it's\nordinary or customary or unique. You run into the same\nproblem no matter how you do that, but you have to\ndecide whether you're talking about investment advice or\nfiduciary investment advice, tax preparation costs or\nfiduciary tax preparation costs. And what is the\nformula for making that distinction?\nMR. MILLER: I think what the Service is\ntrying to do in the proposed regulation and what we have\nsuggested is appropriate is simply a common sense\npractical approach to that. And there may be some\ndifficult cases at the margin. And that's one of the\nthings that the service will try to --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And this must be one.\nThe Service must think this is one because it was\ncertain about the tax return. It says tax return that\ndoesn't get the subject to the 2 percent but only this\nkind of investment advice for total return. So that the\nService didn't see this as a clear and certain category.\nMR. MILLER: Again, I think what the Service\nwas doing there was picking out just the most obvious\nexample. But there simply is no such thing as fiduciary\ninvestment advice that is distinct from --\nJUSTICE ALITO: How do we deal with this\nproblem until there is a regulation? It may be that if\nthe Service issues a regulation and says that these fall\ninto one category and these fall into the other, that\nwould be entitled to a deference. But right now we\ndon't have a regulation, right? So what do we do?\nMR. MILLER: I think what we have suggested\nis there are two -- there are a couple of possible\nreadings of the statute based on the ambiguity in the\nword \"would.\" And in the absence of a regulation, we\nare not suggesting that the Service's position is\nentitled to deference under Chevron. But I think some\ndeference to the consistent position of the Service\nsince the statute was enacted that the investment advice\nbe subject to the 2 percent floor.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask you the same\nquestion I asked your adversary? Whether you use the\nterm \"could\" or \"customarily\" or whatever you're\nformulating, the bottom line, as I understand your\nposition, is that these costs will never be deductible?\nMR. MILLER: They will -- they will be\ndeductible but they will be subject to the floor.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But they will never -- you\nwould not say some trusts yes, and some trusts no?\nMR. MILLER: Well, under -- I mean, if the\ntest were customarily or ordinarily, it might be the\ncase that a trust could show that given the nature of\nthe assets in it, if it were --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Would you have to have a\ncase-by-case analysis of the facts as to whether the\nparticular advice would have been sought, whether the\nadvice was by a trustee or by an individual?\nMR. MILLER: It's not -- we are not\nsuggesting that it's at the level of that particular\nadvice. The question would be --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The cost of the advice?\nWhat percentage of the costs incurred by a trust do you\nthink the investment advice consists of? I mean, it\nseems to me the main thing a trustee ordinarily does, at\nleast if he is a trustee of just cash, is to invest it.\nIt seems to me his major expense must be getting\nfinancial advice, isn't that right?\nMR. MILLER: I don't know the answer to\nthat. The Service --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, imagine something\nelse. Guess. What other, what other expense could even\napproximate that?\nMR. MILLER: One --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And then my follow-up is,\nis there any -- I don't care about legislative history\nbut some of my colleagues do. Is there any -- is there\nany indication that Congress thought it was, it was\nwhacking trusts with this immense new tax with respect\nto their major expenditure? I expect it must be their\nmajor expenditure.\nMR. MILLER: To take your second question\nfirst, the legislative history is silent on specifically\nwhat Congress's objective was in section 67(e).\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The dog didn't bark.\nMR. MILLER: But I think -- but I think what\none can infer from legislative history of the '86 Act\nand more broadly and from the text of the statute is\nthat Congress wanted property to be treated the same,\nregardless of whether it was held by an individual\noutright or held by a trust. So if an individual would\nincur certain costs if he held the property outright,\nthose costs shouldn't be able to escape the 2 percent\nfloor simply because the property is placed into a\ntrust. But if the trust -- the existence of the trust\nrelationship creates some new or additional costs that\nwould not have existed otherwise, then those are not\nsubjected to the 2 percent clause.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you know a trust is\nsort of like a business. And deductions that an\nindividual could not take if he were not in a business\nare perfectly okay for a business. And I don't know why\ntrusts wouldn't be treated the same way. A trust has to\nget investment advice. True? When it's -- when it's an\nindividual getting it, you wouldn't allow a deduction,\nbut a trust is different.\nAnd unless Congress is clearer than this\nstatute, I -- it seems to me that no individual would\nget trust investment advice. Only a trust can get trust\ninvestment advice.\nMR. MILLER: Well, individuals could get --\ncould and do get investment advice that is no different\nin substance from the advice the trust might get. And a\ntrustee might decide that he didn't need investment\nadvice if the trustee is financially sophisticated and\ndoesn't need an advisor. To go --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if you get a\nbill from the investor advisor, and it's $50,000 and\nit's broken up, 30,000 is general stock picking advice,\nand 20 percent is specialized fiduciary advice? In\nother words, they figure out what good stocks are they\npushing these days and they go down and say, well,\nyou're a trustee, you can't buy this you can't buy that.\nYou would -- would you agree that the $20,000 is not\nsubject to the 2 percent floor but the 30,000 is?\nMR. MILLER: Yes. As we acknowledged in our\nbrief, if the advisor -- or another example would be if\nthe advisor imposed some extra charge on the fiduciary\naccounts for whatever reason, that would be an expense\nthat an individual going to that same advisor could not\nincur or ordinarily would not incur.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But the individual who\nwanted to maximize income, for example, if the trustee\nhas to maximize income for some of the life\nbeneficiaries or something, an individual could seek\nthat same advice if he wanted that particular result\nfrom the investment, couldn't he?\nMR. MILLER: That's right. I understood the\nquestion to refer to the case where the advisor charges\nsome extra fee because the client is a trust.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, I didn't understand it\nto be that. I thought it was going to be, you know, the\nadvisor had to figure out we need so much for the, for\nthe remainder man and so much for the life beneficiaries\nand so forth. You don't think that would be enough?\nMR. MILLER: No. No. It wouldn't be.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Miller.\nMr. Rubin, you have four minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PETER J. RUBIN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. RUBIN: Trust investment advice is\nalways distinct from the investment advice that's given\nto individuals, both because of the demanding legal\nobligations specifying certain factors that have to be\ntaken into account by the trustee in investing and\nbecause of the risk of personal liability.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: What do you have to\nsupport that? I resist accepting that broad\nproposition, and I don't know where to look or who to\nask in order to determine its -- its truth or falsity.\nMR. RUBIN: Well, I think, Your Honor, if\nyou look at, at our brief, at pages 7 through 10, there\nis a discussion of the specific legal factors that are\ncodified in Connecticut law in the Uniform Prudent\nInvestor Act, which does not, as the Commissioner\nsuggested, require people to invest as a prudent\nindividual, but it's a different standard.\nSo, for example, safe investments,\nconservative investments are not permitted any more in\nmany circumstances to trustees when an individual could\nwell engage in that kind of investment. Investment in\nareas that the trustee is familiar with is not adequate\nto meet this obligation. So the advice really is\ntailored as a matter of state law in the trust\ninstrument in every case to the trust.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But it could also be\ntailored to an individual with particular circumstances\nthat are similar to that of the trust. So an individual\ncould incur it. An individual with the same amount of\nmoney involved probably would incur it.\nMR. RUBIN: No trust, Your Honor, has\nexactly the same circumstances as a trust, because\ntrusts always have, by definition, more than one\nbeneficiary. There is always a remainder beneficiary,\nat least. Ordinarily there will be --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So an individual\nmight have more than one child he wants to provide for\nand as far as a remainder, there may be more than one\ngrandchild. It could be exactly the same -- an\nindividual could have exactly the same objectives as a\ntrustee.\nMR. RUBIN: The decision process for the\ninvestments will be different in the case of a trustee,\nthough, than for an individual. And a trust, of course,\ncould be multigenerational. This trust will probably\nlast for about a hundred years from the time that it was\ninitially adopted.\nI should also say --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Rubin, is it the advice\nthat's different or is it -- is it the inquiry that's\ndifferent.\nMR. RUBIN: Both. The decision -- the\ndecision to hire the investment advisor is an exercise\nof fiduciary judgment taking into account these -- these\nfactors; and the advice that you're paying for is a\ndifferent service that's tailored to the trust. This,\ntherefore -- the Commissioner acknowledges that -- that\nthe -- that trusts are distinct. But -- but resists\nthe -- the analogy between, for example, fiduciary\nincome tax returns or judicial accountings and other tax\nreturns.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Rubin, is there a\nsubcategory of investment advisors who hold themselves\nout to be fiduciary investment advisors?\nMR. RUBIN: I believe, Your Honor, there may\nbe specific fees for trust investments that are offered\nby firms that -- that provide investment advice.\nWhether there are specific advisors who will take only\nfiduciary clients, I don't --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Or even those who\nadvertise themselves as specialists in fiduciary advice?\nI never heard of them. Maybe there are.\nMR. RUBIN: Well, I think that this actually\npoints out, Justice Stevens, part of the problem with\nthe Commissioner's position, which is it relies on\nlabels. The Commissioner has said it's a common --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: As far as a tax return,\nare there accountants this specialize in trust tax\nreturns as opposed to individual or corporate returns?\nMR. RUBIN: Not that I know of, Your Honor.\nMy sense is that an income tax preparer will be willing\nto prepare an income tax return for a fiduciary or an\nindividual. I see that my time has expired.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\n"
