KASNER\nON BEHALF OF PETITIONER\nMR. KASNER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nIn an effort to limit State-law securities\nclass-actions which undermine the market for nationally\ntraded securities, Congress enacted SLUSA, a statute of\nbroad preemption. SLUSA, which is reprinted at page 8(a)\nof Petitioner's blue brief, preempts, subject to three\nspecific statutory extensions, all State-law-covered class\nactions, quote, \"by any private party who alleges\nmisrepresentations, omissions, or fraudulent behavior in\nconnection with the purchase or sale of a covered\nsecurity.\" The Second Circuit erred in implying an\nexception, that nowhere appears in the statutory language,\nand is wholly at odds with the purpose in the enactment of\nthe statute for holders claims, a type of claim in which a\nplaintiff alleges, \"I did not purchase\" or \"I did not\nsell, but would have, had I known the allegedly false\ninformation,\" a type of claim which this Court, in Blue\nChip Stamps, over 30 years ago, recognized as the most\nvexatious and abusive type of securities class-action\nclaims.\nThe court below erred, for a number of different\nreasons. First and foremost, it completely violated the\nnatural meaning of the statute. As I have mentioned, an\nexamination of SLUSA, beginning at page 8(a), reflects\nthat no covered class action may be maintained, quote, \"by\nany private party,\" a clause that this Court, time and\nagain, has interpreted as perhaps the broadest way of\nphrasing \"any and all private parties\" making certain\ntypes of allegations. Those allegations appear in (a) or\n(b), focusing on the conduct of the defendant in\nconnection with the purchase or sale of a covered\nsecurity.\nNow, Congress could have -- had it intended to\ninject a purchaser/seller limitation, consistent with what\nthe court below concluded, Congress could have phrased\nthat language differently. As the Court is aware, in the\nboth the 1933 and 1934 acts, Congress has made express\ncauses of action, subject to an explicit purchase or\nseller requirement. For example, section 11 of the '33\nact affords a private right of action to purchasers of\nsecurities in registered offerings. Section 12 affords a\nprivate right of action to persons from whom an offer or\nsale of securities. Section 9(e) of the '34 act,\nsimilarly, affords a purchase or seller requirement.\nSignificantly, SLUSA nowhere speaks in terms of\na purchase or sale. And it could have. For example,\nCongress could have provided that no covered class action\nby any private party alleging \"his or her sale\" of a\ncovered security is preempted. It could have said, \"Any\nprivate party alleging a misrepresentation or omission of\na material fact in connection with the plaintiff or that\nparty's purchase or sale.\" It did not.\nThe decision of the court below is also at odds\nwith this Court's teaching in United States versus\nO'Hagan, which was decided 1 year before SLUSA was enacted\nby Congress. In United States versus O'Hagan, this Court\nconcluded that the so-called \"misappropriation theory\"\nstated a viable claim in a criminal case brought by the\nUnited States Government. In responding to an argument by\nthe defendant that no one involved that had been defrauded\npurchased or --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I just ask you this\nquestion about the plain language? If the word in\n1(f)(1)(A) had not been \"in connection with the purchase\nof sale -- sale of security,\" had been \"in connection with\nhis or her purchase or sale,\" then it would have been\ncovered, would it not?\nMR. KASNER: Justice Stevens, if, by \"his or\nher,\" it's referencing \"any private party,\" I would agree\nwith that. That would be a different case in --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: So, the question is whether we\nshould construe the word \"the\" to be the functional\nequivalent of \"his or her.\"\nMR. KASNER: In essence, Justice Stevens --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Is that true?\nMR. KASNER: -- that's correct. And I think\nthat that question has been answered by this Court, on a\nnumber of different occasions. Again, in United States\nversus O'Hagan, this Court concluded that the \"in\nconnection with the purchase or sale of a security\" does\nnot mean \"in connection with the purchase or sale by\nanother party to the securities transaction,\" but, rather,\nmeans \"in connection with the purchase or sale by anyone.\"\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Kasner, the -- does the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission have enforcement\nauthority in this -- in this area?\nMR. KASNER: It does, Justice Scalia.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Have they issued any rules or\nregulations on this -- on this point?\nMR. KASNER: The point being, Your Honor,\nwhether --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: On the point that you're\narguing, whether the critical language means the person's\nown sale, or not --\nMR. KASNER: Yes, Your Honor. In adjudicatory\nproceedings referenced in our brief, the SEC has\nunanimously, and uniformly, taken the position that it\ndoes not. In briefs to this Court in criminal\nprosecutions, in civil prosecutions, the Government has\nconsistently taken the position, as it has in this case,\nas an amicus, and as it did in the court below.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Is it your position that we owe\ndeference to the interpretation of the SEC?\nMR. KASNER: That is our position, Your Honor.\nWe do take the position that this Court should defer to\nthe views of the SEC on that issue. What that deference\nis, should it be Chevron or Skidmore, is not a question\nYour Honor has asked. I'm happy to say that we believe,\nvis-a-vis 10(b)(5) --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, if it's just Skidmore,\nforget about it.\n[Laughter.]\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, that's --\nMR. KASNER: Well, Your Honor, I actually\ncarefully studied yesterday's opinion, where this Court\ndiscussed the Skidmore deference, and, either way, we\nthink that this is -- the statute is so clear that,\ndeference or none, there really is no other way to read\nthe language of the statute.\nAs I say, this Court, in United States versus\nO'Hagan, concluded squarely that this language does not\nmean the purchase or sale of the plaintiff's securities.\nJustice O'Connor's concurring opinion, joined in by\nJustice Stevens, in the Holmes case makes that same point.\nSignificantly, Your Honors, the \"in connection with\"\nlanguage, as a statutory matter, has consistently been\nconstrued by the Securities and Exchange Commission, and\nby this Court, as one of incredible breadth. Most\nrecently, in United States versus Zandford, this Court\nconcluded that the \"in connection with the purchase or\nsale\" language means anything that coincides with a\nsecurities transaction. And what is significant in this\ncase -- it is conceded by the Respondent at page 8 of his\nbrief -- that the conduct alleged by the plaintiff below\nis in connection with the purchase or sale of securities.\nThere really can be no other conclusion. At myriad\nparagraphs in the pleadings, appearing, among others, at\njoint appendix 53, paragraph 4; joint appendix 53(a),\nparagraph 5; joint appendix 59 to 60 --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Kasner, may I just\ninterrupt those references to ask you -- one could agree\nthat, for SEC-enforcement purposes, for prosecutorial\npurposes, the \"in connection with\" is as broad as you\nsuggest. But for purposes of private actions, it isn't\nthat broad; it is limited, as this Court said in Blue Chip\nStamps. It is possible for the same words, even in the\nsame statute, in difference contexts, to mean different\nthings.\nMR. KASNER: Justice Ginsburg, I believe that\nthis Court has answered Your Honor's question in the Blue\nChip Stamp case, where it specifically rejected that sort\nof an approach, and the one that was consistent with the\ncourt below. What the Court, in Blue Chip Stamp -- which,\nof course, was a civil case involving an alleged holder's\nclaim was a class action -- what this Court said, for\npurposes of a civil proceeding, is, \"purchase or seller\nrequirement nowhere appears in the statutory language.\"\nThe statute clearly says \"in connection with the purchase\nor sale of securities.\" But, as a statutory matter, this\nCourt concluded, Your Honor, that a violation of 10(b)(5)\nhad been alleged, notwithstanding going on to conclude\nthat the plaintiff could not recover, as a matter of\nprivate cause of action.\nSo, we understand -- we believe, Your Honor,\nthat it -- and it is undisputed on this record -- that all\nparties agree, as the court below concluded, that this --\nCongress intended to impart 10(b)(5) interpretation as a\nstatutory matter into SLUSA. We also think, Justice\nGinsburg, that, were Your Honors to conclude that somehow\n\"in connection with\" means something different in a civil\ncontext, a narrower reading than in the broader context,\nthat would, of course, violate, in our view, the rule of\nlenity that is applied by this Court. It would also mark\nwhat we believe to be the first time, insofar as we have\nbeen able to determine -- and Respondent cites no\nauthority to the contrary -- in which the same provisions\nin a statute that have civil and criminal --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Would you explain the rule\nof lenity? Because, on criminal, it is as broad as can\nbe. I didn't know that there was a rule of lenity that\napplied strictly to civil liability.\nMR. KASNER: Your Honor, we -- and we have cited\nauthority, including the Leocal decision of this Court,\nlast year, in which, for statutory construction purposes,\nwhere you have a civil and a criminal statute that has\nboth elements to it, the rule of lenity would dictate that\nthe narrower reading be the one that is written. So, in\nother words, if this Court were to have concluded, in Blue\nChip -- excuse me -- in United States versus O'Hagan,\nthat, as a criminal matter, the \"in connection with\"\nlanguage is not tethered to the purchase or sale by a\nparticular party in the case, that is a broader reading\nthan the reading that the court below adopted in a civil\ncase. And so, what we're urging is that the rule of\nlenity would suggest that, if this Court, in U.S. v.\nO'Hagan, took the view that the \"purchase or sale\"\nrequirement does not apply in a criminal context, that\nshould also apply in a civil context, that a narrower\nreading should not be imparted into a civil context than\nyou would find in a criminal context.\nWe also --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But one reason you might\nwant to adopt a narrower reading, though, is, we're\ndealing here with the preemption provision. It's one\nthing to say that, when you're talking about the SEC's\nenforcement powers, you adopt a broad reading; but it's\nquite another thing, when you're talking about displacing\nState law, that you would necessarily adopt the same broad\nreading.\nMR. KASNER: Mr. Chief Justice, I think, in this\ncase, there is no other purpose to be served by this\nstatute than to preempt. To the extent that embedded in\nYour Honor's question is a question with respect to the\nso-called presumption against preemption, we don't think\nthat those concerns, or the concerns to which Your Honor\njust referred, apply in this case, because the statute is\nclear; there is no ambiguity in the language that Congress\nused, and hence -- and it would have made no sense, Mr.\nChief Justice, for Congress to have --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But there's a lot of --\nI think our cases establish that a phrase like \"in\nconnection with\" carries with it a lot of ambiguity. You\ndon't know exactly how rigorous the connection has to be.\nI mean, a auto accident by a broker who's leaving his\noffice -- he wouldn't be in the office if he weren't\nbuying and selling securities. I mean, is that auto\naccident \"in connection with the purchase and sales of\nsecurities\"? No. And yet, you know, theoretically it\ncould be. It's a -- there's a lot of ambiguity in\ndetermining how much breadth to give that phrase.\nMR. KASNER: Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I would\nagree with you that, in terms of deciding, for -- as a\nsubstantive matter, for purposes of 10(b)(5), \"in\nconnection with,\" such as in SEC versus Zandford, how far\nthe outer reaches of the \"in connection with\" language go\nmay well be susceptible of differences of opinion. There\nis no difference of opinion to which there can be any\ndisagreement, in this case, about the plain language of\nthe preemption, because the conduct -- no matter what the\nconduct is that is involved \"in connection with the\npurchase or sale of securities,\" one thing that is totally\ncrystal clear, based on this Court's cases and\ncongressional purpose, is that the \"in connection with the\npurchase or sale\" language, as used here, does not\nrestrict its application to the purchase or sale by the\nplaintiff such that --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: No, but that's a normal\nreading of the words, wouldn't you -- when you say a\npurchase or -- it normally would be \"in connection with\nthe purchase or sale of securities by the party to the\nlitigation.\" That would be your first take on it. But\nthen you say, \"Well, we have cases out there that construe\nit a little more narrowly.\" And is it not somewhat\nunusual -- and I know it's not totally unusual -- for\nCongress to preempt a State cause of action that without\n-- where there is no parallel Federal remedy.\nMR. KASNER: Justice Stevens, one misimpression\nI believe that the court below was under, and I believe is\nperpetuated by Respondent in his amici, this statute does\nnot preempt a State-law claim. This is not like the\ncases, for example --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: It just preempts class\nactions.\nMR. KASNER: It preempts class actions. And\nit's significant, because Congress made a policy judgment.\nOriginally, as originally introduced in the House, SLUSA\nwould have preempted all State-law securities cases. All\nof them. As the statute wound its way through the House\nand the Senate, it -- and principally in response to\ntestimony by the SEC Commissioner Levitt, who went to the\nHill three separate times on this legislation -- specific\nstatutory exemptions were put in.\nBut it -- getting back, though, to the purpose\nbehind --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: In going through that\nlegislative history, did you find any evidence that they\nintended to preempt any State-law claims that were not --\ndid not have a parallel Federal claim?\nMR. KASNER: Justice Stevens, the --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Other than the language of the\nstatute?\nMR. KASNER: Well, we believe that the --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yes.\nMR. KASNER: -- this inquiry --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But you --\nMR. KASNER: -- begins and ends --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- you brought up the\nlegislative history.\nMR. KASNER: Yes.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: So, you're an expert on that\nsubject.\n[Laughter.]\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yes.\nMR. KASNER: Your -- Justice Stevens, the only\nreference to the purchaser-or-seller issue is one that is\nreferenced by the Respondent. And, in that instance, a\nprofessor from Cornell, Professor Painter, went to the\nHill, and he said, \"If you enact this statute, you are\ngoing to be closing off claims of people who are not\npurchasers or sellers, because those cannot be bought in\nthe Federal court.\"\nBut back for a moment, though, to the issue of\nwhat is not preempted in the policy behind this statute,\nthere was another component that Congress was seeking to\nremedy here, and that was the so-called \"safe harbor.\" In\n1995, when Congress enacted the Private Securities\nLitigation Reform Act, one piece of that was an effort to\nencourage public companies to make predictive statements\npublicly. There had been a rash of litigation, at the\ntime, against public companies whose predictive statements\nproved false. And so, Congress said, \"Wait a minute. We\nwill allow you an insulation from liability, if your\nforward statements prove false, if the plaintiff cannot\nallege either that they were made with actual knowledge or\nnot accompanied by meaningful cautionary language.\"\nAnother purpose of this statute was to --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: May I interrupt? Because I'm --\nMR. KASNER: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- your time is running out.\nMR. KASNER: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Is my understanding correct\nthat, on your reading, State class actions of less than 50\nparties are also left unpreempted?\nMR. KASNER: Justice Souter, the definition --\nyes. The answer to --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.\nMR. KASNER: -- your question is, yes.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So --\nMR. KASNER: The definition --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- individual actions and small\nState class actions.\nMR. KASNER: Individual actions, less than 50\npeople, arbitrations, public enforcement.\nAnd, with that, Mr. Chief Justice, I would like\nto reserve the balance of my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Kasner.\nMr. Hungar.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS G. HUNGAR\nFOR THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,\nSUPPORTING THE PETITIONER\nMR. HUNGAR: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and\nmay it please the Court:\nThe fundamental flaw in the Court of Appeals\nanalysis is that it requires the phrase \"in connection\nwith\" to be given two different and irreconcilable\ninterpretations, depending on the identity of the plaintiff.\nNothing in the text or history of the securities laws\njustifies that implausible interpretation.\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Hungar, I just wonder if\nthat's correct. Is -- am I not right to say that the word\n\"the\" had been read to mean \"his or her,\" that argument\nwould not apply?\nMR. HUNGAR: I think that's correct, Justice\nStevens, but --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, then you don't have to\nhave differing interpretations of \"in connection with.\"\nYou just have to know what the word \"the\" means.\nMR. HUNGAR: Well, the \"in connection\" -- that's\nnot the approach that the Court of Appeals took, of\ncourse, but -- and also, as Mr. Kasner indicated, that\nissue has been dispositively resolved by this Court and\nthe Commission in concluding that the purchaser/seller\nrule is not a limitation on the scope of the prohibition\nin section 10(b). And if your interpretation were the one\nthat were adopted, that would not be the case.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I always thought \"the\" meant\n\"the.\"\n[Laughter.]\nMR. HUNGAR: Certainly, that would be our\nsubmission.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And \"his or her\" means \"his or\nher.\"\nMR. HUNGAR: Yes, Your Honor. And, again --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, but you --\nMR. HUNGAR: -- if it --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- think it means \"any.\"\nMR. HUNGAR: I'm sorry?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You think it means\n\"any,\" right? You're reading \"the\" to mean \"any.\"\nMR. HUNGAR: Right, it's \"the\" -- well, it's\n\"the,\" in the sense of \"the activity of purchasing and\nselling securities,\" yes. It's -- and that's how this\nCourt has interpreted, in the O'Hagan case, for -- if that\ninterpretation -- if \"the\" were read as \"his or her,\" then\nit's impossible to see how the SEC could bring an\nenforcement action, or the Justice Department could bring\na prosecution, in a case like O'Hagan, where the -- where\nthe Court specifically said that the purchaser or seller\nwas not defrauded. It's not that -- it's not true that\nsection 10(b) requires that the purchaser or seller be\ndefrauded. And so, we submit that this would be --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, it certainly doesn't\nrequire the Commission to be a purchaser or seller,\neither. You know --\nMR. HUNGAR: Well, we certainly would agree with\nthat, Your Honor, that --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yes.\nMR. HUNGAR: But, more generally, it doesn't\nrequire that there be a purchaser or seller who's\ndefrauded, and yet the purchaser/seller rule, for the\npurpose of implied actions, does require that.\nJustice Stevens, you asked about whether there\nis any indication in the legislative history that Congress\nintended this act to preempt class-action claims where\nthere would be no Federal remedy. The answer to that is,\nabsolutely yes. It is perfectly clear from the\nlegislative history that Congress knew, and expected, that\nclaims that could be brought under State law as class\nactions, such as aiding-and-abetting claims or negligent-\nmisrepresentation claims, claims that would not satisfy\nthe Federal --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Right.\nMR. HUNGAR: -- scienter requirements for --\nand, of course, the claims that would not satisfy the\nrequirements of the PSLRA. None of those could be brought\nin Federal court, because they're barred by the various\nprovisions of Federal law.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: No, but they would be at --\nadjudged under a different standard, you're dead right.\nAs far as the parties involved, the -- that's what I was\nreally asking.\nMR. HUNGAR: Well, in cases where the -- where\nthe only claim is against aiders and abetters, those\nparties would be -- would be out of court; or, likewise,\ncases where parties could not satisfy the scienter\nrequirement, those parties would be out of court. So,\nCongress knew that it would be foreclosing remedies for\ncertain categories of claims, and that was part of the\npoint of the act, as the conference committee report makes\nclear.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What about the --\nMR. HUNGAR: Congress was --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- the claim that's made\nhere, the second claim, where the broker said, \"We lost\nclients, so -- as a result of this deception -- and we\nwant to be compensated for that,\" nothing about the\ninflated price of the security --\nMR. HUNGAR: Your --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- just that \"our clients\ndon't trust us anymore, because we gave them such bad\nadvice.\"\nMR. HUNGAR: Your Honor, the -- that issue is\nnot before this Court --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I know, but I --\nMR. HUNGAR: -- because it was not --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- wanted to know what the\nGovernment's position was on that claim. Could that be\nbrought in a State court --\nMR. HUNGAR: The --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- even as a class action?\nMR. HUNGAR: The Commission addressed that\nquestion in its amicus brief in the Court of Appeals, and\ntook the position that that claim was not in connection\nwith the purchase or sale of securities, because the\ninjury occurs after the fraud has been completed, and is -\n- and has to do with the lost future relationship, rather\nthan fraud in connection with the purchase or sale of\nsecurities. And so, we didn't address that in our brief\nhere, obviously, but the Commission took the position,\nbelow, that that would not be preempted, because it's not\nin connection with the purchase or sale of securities.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: How do you deal with the\nCourt's -- the footnote in the Blue Chip Stamp -- that\nthe court says -- in the Federal court -- \"these 10(b)\nactions have to be limited to actual purchasers and\nsellers,\" but that limitation is attenuated, because\ndeserving claims by nontraders would lie under State law,\nincluding the very suit that was involved in Blue Chip\nStamps and in the Second Circuit case that paved the way\nfor Blue Chip?\nMR. HUNGAR: Your Honor, that was an accurate\ndescription of the state of the law, as it existed at the\ntime, at least in theory, although, as a practical matter,\nRespondents have not been able to point to a single\nreported case a -- of a holder class action in State court\nprior to the adoption of the Uniform Standards Act. So,\nwhile it was true, as a theoretical matter, that such\nclaims could be brought under the law of some States,\nthere are -- there is no history of State class actions in\nthis area, which is one of the reasons why we think the\nreliance on the assumption of nonpreemption makes no sense\nhere. Securities class actions prior to the PSLRA were\nbrought in Federal court, and it was only the PSLRA that\nresulted in cases, such as the type of case at issue here,\nbeing brought in State courts. And Congress -- once it\nsaw that problem, Congress was concerned that the\nrequirements of the PSLRA were being evaded, and it was\nalso concerned, as the conference committee report makes\nclear, that, now that these securities class actions were\nbeing brought in State court, there was the potential\ndanger of 50 varying State standards being applied, as\nthis very case suggests, and Congress acted to remedy both\nof those problems, as the conference committee report\nmakes clear, both the risk of nonuniformity in securities\nclass actions that are targeted by the act, and the risk\nof evasion of the PSLRA.\nRespondent's position would frustrate both of\nthose objectives, because it would -- it would permit the\nmost abusive category of lawsuits to proceed in State\ncourt, and it would permit such holder claims to be\nbrought -- for instance, based on negligence, if State law\npermitted that; based on conduct that would be protected\nby the Federal safe harbor for forward-looking statements\nunder the PSLRA. So, the PSLRA protections would be\nfrustrated by their interpretation.\nSo, the very goals that Congress explicitly\nsought to achieve, stated in the -- in the text of the\nstatute, in the purposes section and also in the\nconference committee report, would be frustrated. And,\nagain, that approach requires the Court to accept an\ninconsistent interpretation of the text of the \"in\nconnection with\" requirement, depending on the identity of\nthe plaintiff, which would be an extraordinary way to\nconstrue a statute, particularly when there's nothing in\nthe legislative history that provides even a hint of a\nsuggestion that Congress would have intended that result.\nAnd with respect to Blue Chip, Your Honor, it's\nimportant to remember what Blue Chip was doing. Blue Chip\nwas not a case about the scope of the \"in connection with\"\nrequirement or the section 10(b) prohibition. Instead, it\nwas a case about what to infer about what Congress would\nhave wanted to authorize as an -- as a right of action, if\nit had addressed the question. And that's why the Blue\nChip court made very clear that the conduct at issue there\ninvolving injuries to holders can be a violation of\nsection 10(b) -- i.e., it can be in connection with the\npurchase or sale of securities -- it's just that they did\nnot think that Congress would have wanted to authorize a\nprivate right of action.\nSo, again, when we're talking about the scope of\nthe \"in connection with\" requirement, which is what is at\nissue here, that approach is the same approach that should\nbe followed here, the same approach that was in --\nfollowed in O'Hagan and in Zandford, and compels the\nconclusion that, since the conduct at issue here is\nunquestionably \"in connection with the purchase and sale\nof securities,\" as this Court has construed that phrase,\nit is preempted by the Uniform Standards Act.\nIf the Court has no further questions, I thank\nthe Court.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Hungar.\nMr. Frederick.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID C. FREDERICK\nON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT\nMR. FREDERICK: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nOur position is that SLUSA does not preempt\nclass actions asserting holder claims. Congress\nincorporated this Court's interpretation of \"in connection\nwith\" from Blue Chip Stamps when it enacted SLUSA. SLUSA\nrechanneled State suits to Federal court. It was not\ndesigned to eliminate State remedies that could not be\npursued as Federal 10(b)(5) claims. That interpretation\nis the better reading of the text, the context, and the\nhistory of SLUSA's handling of private securities actions.\nIf I could start with the text --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Can you tell me, do you agree\nthat a holder action falls within 10(b)(5), generally?\nMR. FREDERICK: No, because this Court, in the\nBlue Chip Stamps case, said that it did not. In footnote\n5, Justice Rehnquist --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But what about enforcement\nactions taken by the --\nMR. FREDERICK: In enforcement --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- SEC?\nMR. FREDERICK: -- actions, the SEC can bring\nenforcement authority, pursuant to 10(b)(5). And so, to\nthat extent, misconduct that would be connected to what,\nin a private context, would be deemed a holder claim, does\nfall within the SEC's --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But then, the --\nMR. FREDERICK: -- jurisdiction.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- then it does fall within --\nholder actions do fall within 10(b)(5), for some purposes.\nMR. FREDERICK: They do, for enforcement\npurposes; they do not, for private civil-action purposes.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So, you want us to interpret\nthe text two ways, depending on the purpose.\nMR. FREDERICK: No. What I want you to do is to\nunderstand what Congress intended. And what Congress\nintended, in SLUSA, I think is quite clear if you start at\nthe beginning of the statute and you just start reading\nyour way through it, because what Congress did in SLUSA\nwas attempt to stop a flight of cases that had been\nbrought in Federal court heretofore, but were migrating to\nState court, Congress perceived, as a result of the\nenactment of the PSLRA.\nSection 2 of SLUSA -- and it is very important,\nYour Honors, that you look carefully at section 2 of\nSLUSA, because it has five congressional findings. They\nare not adequately briefed, or even discussed, by the\nSecond Circuit, but one of them says that the PSLRA sought\nto prevent abuses. The second one says, since an\nenactment of that, Congress perceives that a number of\nsecurities class-action lawsuits have shifted from Federal\nto State courts. The third one says, that shift has\nprevented the act from achieving its objectives. The next\none says, State securities regulation is of continuing\nimportance. And the then, the fifth one says, in order to\nprevent certain State private securities class actions\nalleging fraud from being used to frustrate the objectives\nof the PSLRA, it is appropriate to enact these national\nstandards.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The Government doesn't say that\n\"all\" are covered. The Government acknowledges that there\nare some actions that could still be brought in State\ncourt.\nMR. FREDERICK: The point, though, Justice\nScalia, is that what Congress, in the PSLRA, was doing was\nattempting to ratchet up the pleading requirements for\nFederal-law claims.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So -- it's so\ncounterintuitive. As the Government points out, these\nholder claims lend themselves to abuse much more than do\nthe narrow purchase-and-sale claims.\nMR. FREDERICK: Absolutely --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And why --\nMR. FREDERICK: -- not.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- why the Government would\nwant to police the one, and let the other, you know,\nproliferate, seems very strange to me.\nMR. FREDERICK: That's not correct, Justice\nScalia. And it's important to emphasize this. What the\nCourt addressed in the Blue Chip Stamps case was a very\ndifferent kind of case. It involved nonpurchasers. And\nthe Court reasoned that it would be speculative for\nsomebody out there to say, \"Well, I would have purchased\nthe security, had I known.\" A holder claim, as recognized\nfor a century in various State courts, involves a claim by\nsomebody who holds a security and is induced by fraud not\nto sell that security. The restatement set of torts,\nsection 525, recognizes that the fraud by forebearance of\n-- to cause you not to take an action is just as much a\nfraud as one that --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But the --\nMR. FREDERICK: -- induces you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But the fraud is caused\n-- the fraud causes other people to want to buy the\nsecurity. They do so at a higher price. It causes the\nprice to go up. It's \"in connection with a purchase or\nsale,\" maybe not of the holder's securities. But it's\ncertainly -- the holder's claim wouldn't exist, but for\npurchases and sales that caused the price to go up.\nMR. FREDERICK: In most circumstance, that's\ncorrect, Mr. Chief Justice. But that, I don't think is\nmaterial. The level of damages that a holder sustains\nshould not determine what the elements of the liability\nare. And what is striking about the Government and\nMerrill Lynch's position here is that intentional fraud is\ngoing to be given a pass because of those persons who are\nuniquely harmed, because, for 20 years --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But what your clients\nwant to do is cash in on the fraud. They don't -- their\nclaim is that they didn't get to sell the stock at an\ninflated price to somebody who didn't know about the\nfraud. That's the damages that they want to collect. And\nthat seems to be an odd claim to recognize.\nMR. FREDERICK: That's the same kind of claim\nthat in -- to get back to Justice Scalia's question --\narises in the purchaser/seller context. The only\ndifference is that the measure of damages is computed by\nwhen you purchase or sell, as opposed to when you bought\nit, before the fraud occurred. I mean, Wall Street has\nbeen telling investors, for two or more decades, \"Buy and\nhold. Rest your retirement, hold your securities.\"\nJUSTICE BREYER: In that --\nMR. FREDERICK: In --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- in -- suppose a person\nbought the stock at price 30 before any fraud took place,\nand then he holds it, and then the fraud, and then,\nsubsequently, the word of the fraud gets out, the price\nfalls a lot, and he sells it. Does he have a claim, under\nFederal -- ordinary -- you know, does he -- can he go into\nFederal court?\nMR. FREDERICK: No.\nJUSTICE BREYER: No.\nMR. FREDERICK: Blue Chip --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay.\nMR. FREDERICK: -- Stamps said no.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes.\nMR. FREDERICK: In State courts, in the\nWeinberger case that we cite, they -- they very carefully\nsay this was not a State-court class action, but what\nJudge Friendly, in the Weinberger case, addressed was a\nState-law holder --\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right, then --\nMR. FREDERICK: -- class action --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- then -- I see that -- then\nwhat's worrying me is this, that -- one thing worrying me\nis that -- let's take an ordinary buyer case. All right?\nAnd what happened is that the -- some buyers would like to\nbring a fraud suit in Federal court. They have to go to\nFederal court now. They can't go into State court. But\nthey have a little brainstorm, or the lawyers do, and they\nsay, \"Well, in any case where a buyer would have a claim,\nand we don't want to go into Federal court, there surely\nare going to be a class of holders that would also have\nthe kind of claim you say.\" So, there we are, same\nactions, all in the State court, just happens to have\nfound a different class of claimant. And there always\nwill be such a class.\nMR. FREDERICK: There will be, in most\ncircumstances. There are some circumstances where harms\nare unique to holders. But, Justice Breyer, can I point\nout to you that, in the antitrust context, there is, under\nIllinois Brick, a requirement that you must be in the\ndirect chain, in a direct purchaser, but there are some 30\nStates that have allowed standing for people --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, that's fine. And I --\nMR. FREDERICK: -- that are indirect purchasers.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- and what I'm not facing, in\nthe antitrust area, is what, it seems to me, on your\ninterpretation now, would be, Congress passes a law, which\nbecomes a futile act, because what they're anxious is --\nto do is to get the cases in the class actions -- not all\nthe cases -- but the class actions in the Federal court.\nAnd then, in every single case, or 99.999 percent, where\nwe've kept this action out of Federal court, there's going\nto be a comparable action, with holders as the plaintiff,\nin a State court.\nMR. FREDERICK: Well --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Now, what -- that's a -- my\nconcern. What do you --\nMR. FREDERICK: And let me address that this\nway. What court -- what -- Congress was very clear in the\nlegislative debates, was -- it did not want to cut off\nmeritorious claims. It simply wanted to rechannel them.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Can you -- can you ease my\nconcern there? Is there anything you can say that could\nease my concern that we'll have the same set, that they'll\njust be in State court with a different class?\nMR. FREDERICK: Many States doesn't recognize\nholder claims as a matter of State law, and they have the\nsame kinds of heightened pleading requirements that were\nimposed under the PSLRA.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And, by the way, my concern is\nnot that it's a \"bad thing,\" in quotes. My concern is\nthat it's hard for me to think Congress would have done\nsomething that wouldn't have had much effect.\nMR. FREDERICK: I think your concern should be,\nWhat did Congress intend? And --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, what do you make of --\nMR. FREDERICK: And --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Right. That's just --\nMR. FREDERICK: And I don't think Congress\nintended to eliminate a swath of class actions concerning\na type of claim that this Court had said could not be\nbrought under --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, then --\nMR. FREDERICK: -- Federal law.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- what do you make of the\nlegislative history? I mean, your friend on the other\nside pointed out that there was very clear testimony to\nthe effect that if the statute passed, with the text that\nwe're dealing with, that it would, indeed, cut out a\nseries of claims.\nMR. FREDERICK: I don't think that that was --\nif you read that in context, I don't think that it was a\nstatement by the speaker, in that instance, of Congress's\nintent to go beyond those claims that were cognizable\nunder Federal law, and to cut off a whole category of\nclaims that were unique to State law.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Frederick, you mentioned\ncutting off a whole category of claims. And, earlier, you\nsaid they didn't want to give a pass to this kind of a\nclaim. But this is not a pass, because there are all\nsorts of remedies retained -- derivative suits, 49-person\nactions, and so forth. And are you aware -- you mentioned\nthe 100 years of State precedent -- is there any precedent\nin the State law for class actions for holder claims?\nMR. FREDERICK: Well, we think the Weinberger\ncase recognized that class actions could be brought, under\nNew York law. It was a Federal case --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But this --\nMR. FREDERICK: -- but it was --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- is not a case where we have\na 100-year body of law of class action after class action\nbrought on State-law grounds for this type of claim.\nMR. FREDERICK: True. But, in the '90s, you had\na unique form of fraud that was being perpetrated on Wall\nStreet that did affect holders in a unique way. And we've\nhighlighted market timing in our briefs. In that\ncircumstance, it would be futile for 49 holders to get\ntogether and assert that they had been harmed by market\ntiming, because the aggregate of their harm is so small\nthat you really have to look at it in a large context.\nJohn Vogel, the head of Vanguard for many years,\nand one of most respected mutual-fund advisors, says that\nthere are as many as $5 billion lost by people who buy and\nhold, as we've been taught to do by Wall Street, but whose\naggregate losses accrete every year by virtue of market\ntiming. That is a unique harm caused to holders, which,\nunder their theory, would not be cognizable, because it\nwould be preempted, and it would be impossible, as a\npractical matter, for someone to get together with 48 of\nhis or her fellow victims and try to bring a claim to\nredress that. There's --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But you're --\nMR. FREDERICK: -- no evidence --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- you're describing the\npresent importance of the -- that. But I don't think\nyou've answered my question about historic -- as a matter\nof history, we don't have a history of timer claims.\nMR. FREDERICK: We don't have a history of timer\nclaims, but what we also don't have, Justice Stevens, is\nan indication by Congress, throughout the entire\nlegislative debate or the conference reports or anything,\nwhere holder claims which had been brought were perceived\nto be a problem and were perceived to be within the ambit\nof what Congress was doing. Because, remember --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No, because they -- I mean, the\nargument made by the Government: \"Of course not, because\nthe only reason they're brought is precisely to evade this\ncongressional legislation.\" They didn't exist, before;\nand they've become common, afterwards. Now -- you know, I\n-- you can say --\nMR. FREDERICK: They could --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- that they --\nMR. FREDERICK: -- they could not be brought\nunder Federal law, before. And I would acknowledge that,\nbecause of a series of this Court's decisions, it is\neasier to prove a purchaser/seller claim, where the facts\nwarrant that, under 10(b) prior to the PSLRA than it was\nto prove a holder claim. Judge Friendly, in the\nWeinberger opinion, makes very clear that the value to be\nattributed to the class-action settlement there has to be\ndiminished because of the difficulty of proof of such\nclaims. But that --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I thought that there were --\nwell, never mind.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: There would --\nMR. FREDERICK: I'd like to address the point\nthat the Government makes about how this would supposedly\naffect the SEC's enforcement authority --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Before --\nMR. FREDERICK: -- because --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- you get to that, just --\nMr. Frederick, the logic of it -- but -- here, Congress is\ntightening the requirements for class actions, but then\nthere is this class, which -- Blue Chip did say there's a\nlot -- room for a lot of abuse in holder classes -- would\nbe left to the State courts for whatever strict or lenient\nrules. So, why would Congress, with respect to this\ncategory, want there to be a more plaintiff-friendly rule\nthan the rule that Congress has just put in place for the\npurchaser/seller 10(b) actions?\nMR. FREDERICK: Justice Ginsburg, I don't think\nthat it's correct to characterize it as more plaintiff-\nfriendly. If you're in Minnesota, you can't bring one of\nthese claims, because State law doesn't recognize it.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, at least in some\nStates.\nMR. FREDERICK: In some States, you -- where the\ncommon law or the State statutes recognize these claims,\nall that we're arguing is that Congress didn't focus on\nthese. In the normal presumption against preemption, you\ndon't, you know, cut through a wide swath of claims where\nCongress hasn't expressed an intent specifically to\npreempt them. That's our position, and particularly where\nthe congressional findings --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But you -- you're admitting\nthat an -- that anomaly could be part of the scene, that\nyou'd have a State that allows you to sue for negligence,\nand doesn't have heightened pleading requirements for\nholder claims; and so, those claims would be treated more\n-- in a more plaintiff-friendly way than Federal claims.\nMR. FREDERICK: Yes. Certainly, just as \"breach\nof fiduciary duty\" and \"breach of the covenant of good\nfaith and fair dealing\" are State-law claims, negligence\nis a State-law claim, all of those give rise to\nvariations, State by State. But what Congress was getting\nat were fraud claims that were Federal-law fraud claims.\nAnd, when it did so, it was heightening the pleading\nrequirements and, seeing what people were doing was taking\nwhat were Federal-law claims and migrating them to State\ncourt under, ostensibly, more lenient standards --\nJUSTICE BREYER: But why, in your theory --\nsuppose you're right. You're right. I assume that.\nYou can have these holder claims. But why couldn't\nany buyer, who's -- has to go to Federal court because he\nhas a buyer claim, just say, \"I'll bring the holder claim\"?\nMR. FREDERICK: He can't do that under the --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Because?\nMR. FREDERICK: -- under the Second Circuit's\ntest, because --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I know. But what I'm asking\nis, What's the logic of that? I mean, you're either right\nor you're wrong. If Congress didn't want to cut off the\nholder claim, they didn't. So, what's to show that they\nwanted to cut it off for some people, but not other\npeople?\nMR. FREDERICK: The logic is that, for the\nbuyers of those claims, they are meeting the Federal\nstandard of \"in connection with\" --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Not in this suit.\nMR. FREDERICK: -- \"purchase or sale.\"\nJUSTICE BREYER: Not --\nMR. FREDERICK: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- in this suit.\nMR. FREDERICK: Yes, they are, because they're\nbuying -- the reason why these people have -- under the\nSecond Circuit's standard, which we think is correct, is\nthat you had to have bought the stock before the fraud,\nand you were holding it throughout that period of fraud;\nand so, your purchase is not \"in connection with\" the\nfraud, the misrepresentation. But somebody who sees the\nprospectus, who sees what Mr. Blodget was saying, which\nwas that there were stocks that were, quote, \"a piece of\ncrap,\" but they were giving them the highest buy\nrecommendation -- those people are making their purchase\n\"in connection with\" --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So, if I'm both --\nMR. FREDERICK: -- \"a fraud.\"\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- I bought it in May, in\nreliance on this ridiculous thing. \"Buggy whips make\ngold.\" I believed it. I bought buggy whips. Now --\nwe're now in December. And every month, they kept\nrepeating it. And my claim is, \"Yes, I know, I bought it\nin May, in reliance, but I kept it in July, because I kept\nseeing it repeated and repeated.\" Do I --\nMR. FREDERICK: I think --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- have a claim?\nMR. FREDERICK: I think, actually under the\nSecond Circuit's standard, that --\nJUSTICE BREYER: In the Second Circuit, I do\nnot. But I want to know why not.\nMR. FREDERICK: Well, I think that the reason\nwhy not is that if the fraud is affecting the plaintiff's\ndecision to purchase, then that falls within SLUSA, and\nthat is preempted, although it allow -- you are allowed to\nhave a Federal remedy under that standard. You're\nrechanneled to Federal court. But if you buy -- to use\nyour hypothetical, you buy in January, but the fraudulent\nmisrepresentations are not made until May or June, you're\nprecluded from bringing a Federal-law claim.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What if I choose not to\ncomplain about my buying, I just choose to complain about\nmy holding? It's true, I was harmed because I jumped in.\nAnd that's one harm. But it's an entirely separate harm\nthat I was induced to hold it --\nMR. FREDERICK: That's --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- by these continuing\nmisrepresentations. Why can't that part of the suit be\nbrought in State court?\nMR. FREDERICK: That's our position.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It is? Okay. So, you --\nMR. FREDERICK: Yes. Our position --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- you --\nMR. FREDERICK: -- is that --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- you agree --\nMR. FREDERICK: -- is that --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- you agree that a buyer --\nMR. FREDERICK: I --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- who -- whose purchase is\nexcluded, can nonetheless sue --\nMR. FREDERICK: No, I --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- in a State --\nMR. FREDERICK: No, I'm sorry, I misunderstood\nyour hypothetical. I thought your hypothetical was that\nif you bought, prior to the fraud --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No, no, no, no. You bought --\nMR. FREDERICK: If you bought --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- in reliance --\nMR. FREDERICK: -- in connection with --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- on the fraud --\nMR. FREDERICK: -- a fraud --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes.\nMR. FREDERICK: -- then you are -- you are --\nyou are forced into Federal court --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why?\nMR. FREDERICK: -- under SLUSA.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why? I have --\nMR. FREDERICK: Because --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- a buying claim, and I have a\nholding claim. Why do --\nMR. FREDERICK: That was --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What is there in the statute\nthat says the two have to go with each other?\nMR. FREDERICK: That was the decision that\nCongress made.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Where?\nMR. FREDERICK: In this preemption provision --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I'm not making --\nMR. FREDERICK: -- that your --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- a buying claim. I -- and\nthere's nothing in my complaint about my buying the stock.\nI say --\nMR. FREDERICK: Your --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- \"I was induced to hold the\nstock by these representations that occurred in February,\nMarch, April, and May. I bought, in January, also in\nreliance on fraud, but I'm not complaining about that.\"\nMR. FREDERICK: What the Second Circuit said,\nwhich I think is correct, is that -- is that your damages\nhave to be totally and apart from the fraud as a\npurchaser, and that where --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But they are --\nMR. FREDERICK: -- the reason why they set this\ntimeframe for holder claims is that those kinds of claims\nthat you're talking about, Justice Scalia, would be a\nclassic purchaser/seller-type claim, and you can bring\nthat in Federal court. And that's the point here, that,\nwhere you've got long-term holders, and you've got people\nwho purchased in the '80s or in the '70s, and they're being\ninduced to hold for decades, and they may want to make --\nthey may suffer their damages as a result of collateral\nthat they want to borrow against -- they have no practical\nmeans of recovery --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: As a practical matter, my\ndamages from the holding may be much greater than my\ndamages from the initial purchase. And you're saying,\n\"Tough luck, Charlie. You bought a month too soon -- or a\nmonth too late. You should have brought -- bought before\nthe fraud.\"\nMR. FREDERICK: What the Second Circuit said,\nwhich I think is correct, is that that becomes a level of\nline-drawing that we don't think Congress did intend to\nget into.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I agree with you. But that's\nthe trouble. Because, in order to make the Second\nCircuit's argument, you have to say the following,\n\"Congress couldn't have intended to allow people who have\na buyer claim to make a totally separate holder claim,\nbecause that would gut the statute, and they wouldn't want\nto engage in a futile act.\" But now you're asking us to\ndo about the same thing, when you talk about a person who\ndoesn't have the buyer claim and you're trying to get us\nto say, \"Congress thought -- Congress thought an\nindividual action there, their own separate action in the\nState court, wasn't good enough; it would have wanted to\npreserve the holder claim for them.\" Now, that's\npossible, but it requires me to think Congress is going\nthrough quite a few hoops here.\nMR. FREDERICK: The hoops that Congress went to,\nand which I have articulated, in the congressional\nfindings, are that the particular harm that Congress was\naddressing in SLUSA -- this was a narrow -- you know, this\nwas a narrowly framed preemption as to Federal-law claims,\nbecause a -- the PSLRA only governed Federal-law claims.\nAnd if you could not bring a holder claim under Federal\nlaw, because of Blue Chip Stamps, you were forced into\nState court. Okay? So, when Congress is debating the\nevasion of the PSLRA, it is only talking about Federal-law\nclaims. And there's nothing in the legislative history\nthat they've cited, or that we have found, to suggest that\nCongress gave any thought to preempting a class of holder\nclaims. Now, certainly --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Frederick, can I ask sort\nof a background question? Ever since Blue Chip -- it's\nbeen on the books for a long time -- has Congress ever\nconsidered legislation that would expand the 10(b)(5)\nprivate remedy to include holder claims?\nMR. FREDERICK: I'm not aware of legislation,\nYour Honor.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I'm not, either. I -- just\nwondering if there was some we could --\nMR. FREDERICK: But what -- what this Court did\nsay, in Blue Chip Stamps, was that, when the Birnbaum\ndecision -- and it was an interpretation of \"in connection\nwith purchase or sale\" by what one Justice on this Court\ndescribed as the \"Mother Court of the Court of Appeals\" --\nit was Chief Judge Swan, Judge Augustus Hand, and Judge\nLearned Hand -- and they construed the words \"in\nconnection with purchase or sale\" to mean the plaintiff's\npurchase --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, but Blue --\nMR. FREDERICK: -- or sale.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- but Blue Chip did not adopt\nthe rationale of the Birnbaum case.\nMR. FREDERICK: Well, I think it -- it did adopt\nthe rule, though, as a basis of the wording. And if you\nlook at page 733 of the Court's opinion, it was adopting\nthe rationale, in the sense that it saw Birnbaum as a\nconstruction of the language, and it adopted that. And\nthen in note 5, when Justice Rehnquist's opinion says, \"It\nwould be odd to read 'in connection with purchase or sale'\nto give a,\" quote, \"'cause of action to everybody in the\nworld,'\" I think it's clear that that was suggesting that\nState law could recognize something that this Court said\nwas not recognized under Federal law.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Frederick, it seems to me\nthat the language \"in connection with,\" you know, whether\nit means what Blue Chip meant or whether it means what the\nstatute meant, is at least ambiguous. And, if that's the\ncase, why shouldn't we be guided by the Securities and\nExchange Commission's determination, under Chevron, Mead,\nyou know, anything but --\nMR. FREDERICK: This statute is a -- about\nprivate civil actions, and it doesn't affect the SEC's\nenforcement authority or any action. In fact, the SEC\ndoesn't derive any greater power, or lesser power, as a\nresult of the enactment of SLUSA. It is entirely\nlegislated against private civil actions.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The --\nMR. FREDERICK: So, the SEC --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Have we not given any weight to\nSEC determinations, as to its interpretation, where civil\nactions are involved? I'm surprised at that.\nMR. FREDERICK: This is an act, Justice Scalia,\nwhere the SEC's enforcement authority isn't affected one\njot. And so, I think it would be a strange application of\nChevron, or even Skidmore, deference to say that the SEC\ngets some special weight because it's construing words in\nan enactment --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes.\nMR. FREDERICK: -- that's addressed to private --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Do you know --\nMR. FREDERICK: -- civil litigation.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- whether the SEC filed an\namicus brief in Blue Chip?\nMR. FREDERICK: Yes. And it took the position\nthere that \"in connection with\" did have a broad\nconstruction. And that position was rejected.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: It took the position that the\nSeventh Circuit took in Eason, didn't it?\nMR. FREDERICK: That's correct.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yes.\n[Laughter.]\nMR. FREDERICK: But the Court, there, I don't\nthink was -- it said that it was not in -- giving any\ndeference to the SEC's position, because it was an implied\nprivate right of action that this Court had recognized,\nand that the lower courts had recognized.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Before you finish -- there's\ntwo questions I would like to ask him. One is -- we know\nabout the holder claims. They are saved for State\nactions. They're not preempted. What else would fall in\nthis category that is not -- that SLUSA doesn't affect,\nthat can be brought as class actions in State court?\nMR. FREDERICK: Well, there are class actions\nthat concern breaches of fiduciary duty, negligence. And\nthe question of whether or not they are \"in connection\nwith purchase or sale\" is going to have a profound impact\non whether or not those claims are also preempted. I\ncan't spell out for you what the necessary consequences\nare, but there are a lot of State-law claims brought under\nBlue Sky laws and other State remedies that traditionally\nhave been observed and brought, even as State claims, but,\nunder a -- you know, the all-encompassing parameter of \"in\nconnection with purchase or sale\" advanced on the other\nside, a decision that would favor that could have unknown\npreemptive consequences, which I would submit would be\ncontrary to the normal way you would put Congress to the\ntest of determining, \"Did it intend to preempt those\nclaims?\" before adopting a broad interpretation that would\ndo so. And if I could point out --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You --\nMR. FREDERICK: -- one of the strange things\nabout this case and the SEC's position is that district\ncourts are going to be put in the rather unusual position\nof paying a rather high cost, because if they are\nconfronted with a removal of a case brought under State\nlaw, where the defendant asserts that it is preempted\nunder SLUSA, and the SEC hasn't taken any action at all,\nand has expressed no interest in this particular area, the\ndistrict court, to determine preemption, has to intuit\nwhether or not this is within the SEC's enforcement\nauthority. So, you have -- ordinarily, you would have\nprivate plaintiffs suing for wrongdoing on the same side\nof the case as the SEC, as the public enforcer. But,\nhere, you have them at loggerheads. And the only way that\nthe district court can properly figure that out, whether\nor not the private victim can get a private remedy, is to\ncut back on the SEC's enforcement authority, will -- if\nyou will -- would exact an awfully high cost.\nI would submit that that kind of an anomaly is a\nrather unusual one, particularly where the SEC isn't a\nparty in the case, and it is not being invited to submit a\nbrief. And yet, district courts, in order to determine\nthe preemption question here, are going to have to rule\nagainst the SEC in order to give a private remedy -- to\nrecognize a private remedy under State law, or to cut back\non a remedy under State law by holding that it is within\nthe SEC's enforcement jurisdiction.\nUltimately, what Merrill Lynch here is asserting\nis an immunity for a fraud that uniquely affects a certain\nclass of holders who do not have a remedy under Federal\nlaw. And I would submit that, where any party is seeking\nto get an immunity from an intentional fraud, the party\nbears a heavy presumption that that is, in fact, what\nCongress intended. And I would submit to you that, both\nwith the language of the statute, the findings that\nCongress made in the legislative history, Congress did not\nexpress an intent to eliminate holder class actions of\ngreater than 49 persons.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I agree with that presumption\nagainst preemption, where the question is, Does this\nFederal statute, which says nothing about preemption,\naccidentally preempt some State law? -- that there, the\npresumption makes sense. But here, you have a statute,\nthe whole object of which is preemption. And I'm not sure\nthat what you shouldn't do in that case is just give the\nlanguage its most reasonable meaning, with no thumb on\neither side of the scale.\nMR. FREDERICK: But it's preemption to\nrechannel. And that's the important point, Justice\nScalia. The point was not to allow State-law claims under\nState-court systems, but to rechannel those actions into\nFederal court. And if there are a category of victims of\nfrauds who have no Federal remedy, it doesn't make sense\nto infer that Congress, without saying so, left those\npeople without any remedy whatsoever.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Frederick, I want to be\nsure of one question. I'm not sure I understood your\nargument about how the district court has to deny the\nright to the SEC. But the SEC wouldn't be bound by the\ndistrict court's decision, would it?\nMR. FREDERICK: Well, it depends on how the\ncourts would construe the SLUSA cases as affecting the \"in\nconnection with purchase or sale\" in the SEC enforcement\nauthority. If you were to accept the premise that the\nCourt's Zandford and O'Hagan decisions are binding on the\nSLUSA preemption language, anytime a court is construing --\nMay I finish, Mr. Chief Justice?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Certainly.\nMR. FREDERICK: Anytime a court is construing\nthat language, in the SLUSA context, it would necessarily\nhave a collateral impact on the SEC's enforcement\nauthority in 10(b).\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, but the SEC could\nrelitigate it, I would think. It wouldn't be bound by the\njudgment in a private suit.\nMR. FREDERICK: It could certainly relitigate\nit. But the point of the persuasive authority of a\nconstruction of \"in connection with purchase or sale,\" I\nthink, would have effects that are inappropriate.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel.\nMR. FREDERICK: Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Kasner, you have 3\nminutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JAY B. KASNER\nON BEHALF OF PETITIONER\nMR. KASNER: Counsel referred to the findings in\nthe legislation. And I know this Court will go back and\nreview those. The -- finding number 5 does not use the\nword \"certain\" anywhere in it. What finding number 5 does\nsay, however, \"It is appropriate to enact national\nstandards for securities class-action lawsuits involving\nnationally traded securities while preserving the\nappropriate enforcement powers of State securities\nregulators and not changing the current treatment of\nindividual lawsuits,\" quote/unquote.\nJustice Breyer and Justice Ginsburg asked\nquestions that I think illustrate that Congress could not\nhave intended such an anomalous result by allowing\nholders' claims to proceed as nonpreempted.\nJustice Breyer, as a practical matter, you are\n100 percent right in the premise of your question. If\nthis Court agrees with -- that the court below is correct,\nevery single securities class action that is brought in\nFederal court from that day forward will have a companion\nclaim brought with it, asserted by holders. And it's not\nsimply holders in the fashion that Mr. Dabit appears,\nwhich is somebody who claims, \"I would have sold, had I,\nessentially, known inside information,\" a proposition\nwhich Judge Friendly expounded on in the Levine case in\nthe Second Circuit, but you will also have holders -- you\nwill also have claims by people who come to court, in the\nState court, and say, \"You know, I would have bought\nsecurities if you had not issued such unduly pessimistic\nprojections,\" just as was the case in the Blue Chip Stamp\ncase. And imagine the impact that that result would have\non the safe harbor, which Congress enacted with the PSLRA\nto protect public companies in the United States and\nabroad, encouraging them to make forward-looking\nstatements. If you allow a result which affords putative\npeople, who would have bought and would have sold, in\nState court where the safe harbor doesn't apply, you will\nabsolutely be gutting the statutory protections that\nCongress was seeking to protect.\nI'd like to just make one point about the\nWeinberger verse -- the Weinberger v. Kendrick case that\nis mentioned. That involved an approval of a Federal-\ncourt class action where State-law holders' claims were\nbeing released. In fact, the consideration that was\napproved there was less, because the claims were weaker.\nWe've heard a lot, Your Honors, about why\nCongress didn't mention holders' claims by name. The\nreason they didn't mention holders' claims by name is that\nit wasn't until SLUSA was enacted and creative plaintiff\nstrike-suit lawyers brought holders' claims, in an effort\nto avoid SLUSA, that this problem became exacerbated. But\nthere is no doubt that the plain and natural meaning of\nSLUSA picks up all claims by any private party in\nconnection with the purchase or sale of security.\nIf there are no --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: It's surprising that the\nholder claims didn't respond to Blue Chip. I think your\nargument would suggest they should have responded to Blue\nChip by bringing a whole host of holder claims in the\nState court.\nMR. KASNER: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yes.\nMR. KASNER: Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel.\n"
