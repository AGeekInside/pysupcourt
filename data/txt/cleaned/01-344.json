The Western\nStates Medical Center.\nMr. Kneedler.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. KNEEDLER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nIt has long been a fundamental requirement of\nthe Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act that a new drug\nmay not be marketed unless it has first been found by the\nFood and Drug Administration to be safe and effective for\nits intended use.\nCongress concluded that the protection of the\npublic health requires that safety and effectiveness be\nrigorously established by scientifically valid studies\nrather than the impressions of individual doctors, and\nalso that persons who promote and distribute new drugs\nshould be the ones to undertake the studies necessary to\nestablish their safety effectiveness.\nIn 1997, Congress carved out a narrow exception\nto the new drug approval and certain other requirements of\nthe Food and Drug Act for certain compounding by\npharmacists. The exemption is addressed to what is often\nreferred to as extemporaneous compounding. That is,\ncompounding undertaken in response to a physician's\nprescription based on the idiosyncratic needs of a\nparticular patient. Such compounding is typically based\non an existing relationship among the pharmacist,\nphysician, and patient.\nCongress provided in section 353(a), which it\nenacted in 1997, that the exemptions from the new drug\napproval and other requirements of the act would be\nlimited, and available only in circumstances that\nconformed to extemporaneous compounding by pharmacists.\nQUESTION: Mr. Kneedler, a moment ago you say\nthis is based on an existing relationship between the\nphysician, the druggist, and the patient. What is meant\nby that term?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, I -- it's based on the\nrelationship.\nQUESTION: Well, I could tell that.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Typically an existing\nrelationship in the sense that the need for compounding\noften arises where there may be a commercially available\nproduct that maybe the physician has prescribed, but it\nmight -- or would have otherwise prescribed, but it might\ncontain an ingredient to which the patient is allergic, or\nit may come in a dosage that would be inappropriate for a\nchild or an older person, and therefore the physician and\nthe pharmacist would consult and say, the pharmacist would\nbe asked, could you modify this in some way, or develop\nthe same drug without the ingredient, so --\nQUESTION: The plaintiffs here seem to be\nengaged in a Nation-wide business.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Yes.\nQUESTION: They're not a corner --\nMR. KNEEDLER: No, it is -- and the record in\nthe case, the materials submitted in the district court,\nconfirm exactly what you say. This is far different from\nthat sort of situation. They're engaging in conduct that\nis essentially indistinguishable from that of any\nmanufacturer or producer of drug products that is governed\nby the manufacturing --\nQUESTION: Well, can't Congress limit the\ncompounding to the ordinary prescription service that we\nexpect pharmacists to be doing?\nMR. KNEEDLER: And that's exactly what Congress\nhas done. If I --\nQUESTION: Well, but they added this ban on\nadvertising.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, if I could explain, the ban\non advertising is one of the conditions that confine the\nexemption to traditional extemporaneous compounding. The\nothers are, for example, that it has to be on the basis of\nan unsolicited prescription, that the drug can't be\nprepared in advance of the prescription except in --\nQUESTION: Well, don't all those things take\ncare of the Government's interest in problems? What\njustifies the additional ban on promotion and advertising?\nMR. KNEEDLER: That condition is essential to\nprotecting the integrity of the new drug approval process,\nfor this reason. The general rule under this act is that\nthe introduction of any new drug in interstate commerce\nmust conform with the prior approval requirements of the\nFood and Drug Act. This is a narrow exception from that,\nbut what Congress had to do was draw the line between what\nis extemporaneous compounding and what is not.\nQUESTION: Yes, but what I don't understand is,\nif Congress can limit in all these other ways the use of\ncompounding of drugs, then why does it need this\nadditional ban? The court below seemed to think that it\nwas not necessary, and I think I have the same problem.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, I -- first of all, we think\nthat the court of appeals really misunderstood what the\ngovernmental interest here -- the -- is here. The\ngovernmental interest, again, is maintaining the integrity\nof the Government approval process and making sure that\nthose who hold themselves out as marketers and\ndistributors of new drugs comply with those requirements\nin the same way that any other manufacturer must do. The\nmixing together of ingredients --\nQUESTION: Well, is there any allegation here\nthat the ads are false or fraudulent, misleading,\ndeceptive? I mean, you could always attack that.\nMR. KNEEDLER: But that's not really the basic\npoint behind this. Again, no one, whether he holds a\npharmacist's license, a physician's license, or not, may\nmanufacture and market drugs in this economy without going\nthrough the prior approval requirement, and --\nQUESTION: And what does manufacture mean? I\nmean, that's a problem I have with this case, they\nmanufacture it. The manufacturer does exactly the same\nthing that the compounder does, puts together two or more\nother ingredients into a new drug.\nMR. KNEEDLER: I think that's a very important\npoint. There is nothing distinctive about a pharmacist\nputting together ingredients to produce a new drug as\ncompared with a traditional manufacturer.\nQUESTION: Exactly.\nMR. KNEEDLER: But what distinguishes it is that\nCongress carved out a narrow exception, is the existence\nof this relationship between the pharmacist, among the\npharmacist, the physician, and the patient.\nQUESTION: But why does that -- why does\nadvert -- you see, I don't mind -- don't mind. I mean,\nsurely Congress can constitutionally limit it to try to\nprevent evasion of the normal approval process, but there\nare other ways of limiting it, like saying, as you\nobserved, this particular druggist operates Nation-wide\nand sells, you know, thousands and thousands of dollars.\nFine, put a dollar limit on the amount that any single\ndruggist can do. Wouldn't that achieve -- the problem is\nthat the Government has sought to achieve its limitation\nby placing a limitation on speech.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well --\nQUESTION: Why did it have to do that? Why does\nadvertising equate with manufacturing?\nMR. KNEEDLER: It -- what it equates with is the\nmarketing of products in the economy, and this is not the\nonly situation under the Food and Drug Act where the\nadvertising that someone does is what triggers regulation.\nThis Court last term in the Buckman decision\naddressed a very analogous situation, and if I could\nexplain why it's analogous, I think it would be\ninstructive here. There, the Court pointed out that the\nFDA is faced with competing considerations. On the one\nhand there is a rigorous premarket approval process for,\nin that case, devices, which is very analogous to the\nrigorous new drug approval process for drugs, but the\nCourt at the same time recognized that it is permissible\nfor physicians to prescribe for off-label uses,\nphysicians, but if a manufacturer of the drug advertises\nthe product for a use that is not on the label, that is\nprohibited. What someone cannot do is market in the\neconomy a drug for an intended use that is not on the\nlabel, because in that situation, as here, Congress was\ntrying to draw the line between marketing of drugs and\nprotection of profession --\nQUESTION: No, but it wasn't a distinction\nbetween manufacturers. I mean, the problem there is, if\nyou're saying it is good for this, that is one of the\nintended uses, and you have to have gotten approval for\nthat intended use. I mean, that's what did the trick\nthere.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Yes, but --\nQUESTION: It wasn't an equation of advertising\nwith manufacturing.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, what it is, it's an\nequation of advertising with what triggers the, in that\ncase the prior approval process and in this case the prior\napproval process. When someone holds himself out as\nproducing and distributing drugs, then it is fair to make\nthat person, like every other manufacturer that\ndistributes drugs in the national economy comply.\nQUESTION: Mr. Kneedler, would you explain\nsomething to me? Going back before the point where --\neverybody seems to agree that compounding and\nmanufacturing is no different, but there once was a world\nwhen there were mostly corner pharmacists, and there was\nsomething called compounding which surely was discrete\nfrom manufacturing, and it seems to me that what you\ndescribed as an exemption for the compounding was the\nfirst time that compounding is put together with new\nmanufactured new drugs.\nBefore the 1997 alteration, how was compounding\ndealt with by the FDA?\nMR. KNEEDLER: The FDA had taken the position\nfor quite a while before the 1997 amendments of at least\ntwo decades that pharmacy compounding, at least if it\nincluded such an indicia of manufacturing as advertising,\nor large volumes, a number of things that take it out of\ntraditional pharmacy compounding, extemporaneous, and put\nit into the basically predetermined or planned marketing\nof a product, that's the line Congress is trying to draw.\nQUESTION: But I mean, there's two kinds of\ncompounding. Let's just say, it's the physician who's\nprescribing this medication for a child, so it needs to be\ndiluted, pharmacist-diluted, is that manufacturing?\nMR. KNEEDLER: It would be producing a new drug\nwithin the meaning of the new drug provisions of the act,\nit would have been prior to 1997. The position that\nFDA -- FDA formalized its enforcement policy in 1992 to\nsay that compounding that occurs in the normal course, the\nordinary course of the practice of pharmacy,\nextemporaneous compounding that you've described to dilute\na commercially available product, or to extract an\ningredient from it, that would be all right, but when the\npharmacist stepped out of that role and behaved in ways\nthat a regular producer of drugs subject to the act\nbehaves, then the person is subject to the prior approval,\ngood manufacturing practices requirements of the act,\nbecause again, in terms of function, putting together\ndifferent ingredients to produce a product, whether it's a\nmanufacturer, or whether it is someone with a pharmacy\nlicense doing it, that doesn't matter, and the important\npublic health considerations --\nQUESTION: What you're doing -- tell me if I'm\nincorrect. You're equating the size of the market with\nwhether there's manufacturing or compounding, and it seems\nto me that advertising is not necessarily a good proxy for\nthat. Suppose you had a pharmacy that's near a home for\nsenior citizens, and they have particular success with one\ndoctor in compounding a particular drug.\nI take it if they advertise to the other doctors\nthey take care of these people, now we can compound this\ndrug for you, that that's a violation of the law. I don't\nthink that that's a proxy for being a manufacturer. We\nhave the other paradigm of this huge, Nation-wide chain\nthat advertise and they look more like a manufacturer. I\njust don't know that that's an adequate proxy.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Several things in response to\nthat. First of all, the new drug provisions of the act\nare directed at single incidents of introducing a new drug\ninto interstate commerce, or a single incident of\nreceiving this branded drug in interstate commerce, so the\nact applies irrespective of the volume. Now, obviously\nthe magnitude of the public health problem expands as more\nand more people are affected, but advertising, along with\nthe other conditions Congress put in the act, were a\npretty good indication of trying to draw a distinction\nbetween traditional pharmacy and what the FDA\nQUESTION: No, but that's based on the size of\nthe market, I take it.\nMR. KNEEDLER: No, it's based on the undertaking\nby the person who is producing, who is trying to put the\ndrug out on the market. It's really a difference between\noffering services and offering drugs.\nQUESTION: I'll look at your brief again, but I\nthought that your whole theory was that advertising is a\nproxy for market, which is a proxy for manufacturing,\nversus the compounding. I thought that was the heart of\nyour case.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, it would certainly lead to\nthose consequences. My point is, though, that the line\nCongress drew is not at a particular volume. It looked at\nthe traditional operation of the act, which prohibits\nindividual instances of introducing drugs --\nQUESTION: Which is why advertising is such an\nimprecise proxy.\nMR. KNEEDLER: No, I -- well, with all respect,\nwhat the pharmacist can do is advertise his services, his\nprofessional services, and what the act does -- this\nexemption in the act does is, respect that professional\nservice and the relationship that grows out of that\nprofessional service.\nQUESTION: Which can produce an enormous volume.\nUnder the act, it's perfectly okay to advertise, you know,\nXYZ pharmacy. We compound whatever you want, best prices\nin the country, guaranteed lowest prices for all\ncompounded drugs. That advertising's perfectly okay, so\nlong as you don't name one particular compound that you're\noffering, right?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Yes.\nQUESTION: And that's going to lead to certainly\nvery, very much increased volume.\nMR. KNEEDLER: But what that does is conform to\nthe line Congress was trying to draw. It allows the\nadvertising of the services, but it does not allow the\nadvertising and therefore the attempt to develop a market\nfor a particular product, or drug.\nAgain, the Federal act is concerned with\npromoting drugs, not services, so when you hold yourself\nout as someone who says, I will sell drugs -- and if you\nlook at the record in this case, the plaintiffs have\nadvertising that lists a whole variety of drugs available\nfor infertility, for cancer, for things like that. They\nare behaving just like any manufacturer, any -- just like\nexactly the sorts of persons that the new drug approval\nand the good manufacturing practice provisions of the act\nwere designed to reach.\nI want to go back to Justice Kennedy, because I\nwould like to extrapolate a little bit on your answer to\nhim. I thought, is this the -- what the Congress is after\nis, it's simply a matter of volume, and you said no, so I\nsaid, well, what is it?\nNow, in my own mind what I thought is, it's the\ndirection where the demand comes from. There might be\nchildren, and there are, who find it very difficult to\nswallow pills and who are undergoing chemotherapy, and\ntherefore there must be a way of adjusting that pill.\nNow, with some medicines, maybe there's one\nchild out of a million. With others, maybe there's one\nout of 10. Both cases you want the demands for the\nspecial drug to flow from the doctor, through the patient,\nto the pharmacist, and what you don't want is it to flow\nfrom the pharmacist to the patient to the doctor back to\nthe pharmacist.\nMR. KNEEDLER: That's exactly right.\nQUESTION: The one is promotion and soliciting.\nThe other is the doctor determining there's a genuine need\nfor a special medicine.\nMR. KNEEDLER: That's exactly right, and that's\nexactly what the FDA was referring to and others have\nreferred to as extemporaneous compounding. It arises out\nof the relationship, so Congress -- in carving out this\nexemption, Congress was doing a number of things. It was\nlooking at the --\nQUESTION: But you have prohibited, or the\nGovernment prohibits the pharmacy from advertising to the\ndoctor the availability of this remedy.\nMR. KNEEDLER: The -- it doesn't prohibit the\navailability of the advertising services, which can\ninclude, we can prepare a product to remove something to\nwhich a patient may be allergic. We can compound a\nproduct --\nQUESTION: No, no. Suppose, in Justice Breyer's\nexample, that doctors didn't know that this could be done\nwith this pill, and -- but under the statute you're\ndefending, the pharmacy could not advertise to doctors\nthat it can prepare this drug in that way.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, but it -- what it can do,\nthough, is advertise in general terms that it can remove,\nor it can produce a product that is like a commercial one,\nbut while removing ingredients to which the person may be\nallergic, or dilute a dosage. That is enough to get the\ncritical information --\nQUESTION: Well, how do we know that, because\nundoubtedly I think what Justice Kennedy said must be\nright. One of the negative effects of the statute is, it\ndoes prevent the pharmacist from, through advertising,\ntelling the doctor that we have this special way of making\ndrug X. That is a negative impact. On the other hand,\nthere are counterbalancing positive impacts in preventing\nthe general solicitation of the public, which will produce\na demand you don't want.\nNow, is there anything that tells us how that\ncomparison breaks down?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Yes, and I think the most\ncritical thing that tells us that is the new drug approval\nprovisions of the Food and Drug Act itself, which Congress\nenacted in 1938 and strengthened in 1962 precisely to\nreach the conduct of people developing new drugs and\nadvertising and promoting drugs that have not been shown\nto be safe and effective to individuals or to the public\nat large. It is the act of --\nQUESTION: Yes, but when you have the basic\nprovision that compounding can only be conducted in\nresponse to a prescription by a physician, it's hard to\nunderstand why it has to be accompanied by a ban on\ntruthful speech about it.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well --\nQUESTION: I mean, we've had a long history in\nthis very Court of giving voice to the notion that\ntruthful advertising is acceptable in this country.\nMR. KNEEDLER: But the new drug approval\nprovisions of the Food and Drug Act rest on the premise\nthat the judgment of the individual physician is not\nsufficient. That is the very purpose of requiring prior\napproval and requiring the person who wants to --\nQUESTION: Yes, but presumably compounding\ncannot be done without resorting to approve -- the use of\napproved drugs. It's diluting it, it's mixing it some way\nfor children, it's adding some kind of sweetener so they\ncan swallow it.\nMR. KNEEDLER: That's one variation, but again,\nif you look at the record in this case, there are products\nthat have been compounded that don't resemble that at all.\nWhat they are, are people holding themselves out as\npharmacists who really see themselves as developing new\ncures, not just tinkering with an existing product, but\nputting --\nQUESTION: Mr. Kneedler, isn't it true that --\nwe haven't talked about the severability issue, but as I\nunderstand it, the whole statute has been held\nunconstitutional, because they disagreed with the district\ncourt on the severability point.\nMR. KNEEDLER: That's correct.\nQUESTION: It seems to me that you still can\nenforce -- I would have thought the parties to be arguing\nthe opposite sides of this case, to tell you the truth.\nIt seemed to me the statute actually helps the\ncompounders, because it makes legal something that is\notherwise illegal, and if the statute's knocked out, you\nhave all your enforcement mechanisms to prevent them from\ndoing the mass marketing, don't you?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Yes. Well, not -- it would\nrevert to the situation before, in which this would be\nabsolutely prohibited.\nQUESTION: Right.\nMR. KNEEDLER: And FDA would have the\ndiscretion, and again it's not just mass marketing, it is\nthe situation, as Justice Breyer described, of where the\ndemand comes from, and -- but more fundamentally, the act\nrests on the notion that it is fair to require people who\nhold themselves out and who attempt to develop and exploit\na market to go through the new drug approval requirements.\nQUESTION: I understand that, but it seems to me\nthat the -- your opponents would be better off if the\nstatute were held to be constitutional than having it held\nunconstitutional, because you now may prevent them from\ndoing what you're basically saying is the wrong -- is\nmarketing new drugs.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, you make an important\npoint, because Congress looked at this problem in 1997\nand, as the committee reports we quote show, it consulted\nbroadly about this and arrived at a consensus about\nexactly where this dividing line should be between\nextemporaneous traditional compounding and the traditional\nkind of promotion of new drugs that the act was directed\nto.\nQUESTION: Well, maybe you can't do it that way.\nI mean, maybe the Government is just trying to ride two\nhorses at the same time, the one horse being that all\ndrugs must be approved by the FDA and the other one being,\nwell, we're going to let, you know, drugs that are\nprescribed, special drugs prescribed by doctors are okay,\nand we're going to ride both of these horses at the same\ntime by imposing a restriction on truthful advertising. I\nmean, just maybe you can't do that. I mean --\nMR. KNEEDLER: This case --\nQUESTION: -- it seems to me that the ultimate\nproblem with the case is that the Government is trying to\nhave it both ways. --\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well --\nQUESTION: It's trying to say, it's not enough\nto have the doctor approve this drug. We don't trust\ndoctors. We want FDA approval. But then on the other\nhand it's saying, well, on the other hand, if it's a\ndoctor and an individual druggist, it's okay. I don't\nunderstand why that makes any sense.\nMR. KNEEDLER: The Central Hudson doctrine that\nthis Court has developed for evaluating restrictions on\ncommercial speech, its virtue is that it allows the\nrecognition of these very real problems that regulatory\nagencies face.\nAgain, it's exactly the sort of balance the\nCourt was addressing in Buckman last term between\nrespecting the integrity and creating incentives for\nproducers to go through the new drug approval process on\nthe one hand, but respecting professional services,\nexisting relationships on the other, and under the Central\nHudson analysis, as we explain in our brief, we think this\nstatute easily passes muster, maintaining the integrity of\nthe new drug approval process, and maintaining incentives\nfor manufacturers to go through it is clearly, in our\nview, a substantial governmental interest.\nQUESTION: They're talking about Central Hudson\nand the narrow tailoring notion, or whether it's\nsufficiently tailored. I forget the exact language.\nI take it you'd have a much stronger case if the\nprohibition was limited to prohibition of advertising\ndirected at consumers, as opposed to advertising directed\nat doctors.\nMR. KNEEDLER: No, I -- again, the new drug\napproval process of the act rests on the premises that\ndoctors themselves cannot make independent judgments about\nthe safety and effectiveness of products, and that is --\nthat was a very firm understanding of Congress when it\npassed the new drug approval process.\nQUESTION: Unless they're druggists. Unless\nthey're druggists who don't sell too much. Unless they do\nit with druggists who truthfully advertise. Why does that\nmake any sense?\nMR. KNEEDLER: But the paradigm that the act was\ndirected to is where there is an approved new drug\nproduct, or an approved product on the market, and what\nthe pharmacist is being asked to do is tinker with it a\nlittle bit by diluting it, by something on that order, to\nmake it -- to adjust it but not be in the business of\ndeveloping new cures, or advertising new cures for\nexisting diseases.\nQUESTION: No, but I thought just as Justice\nScalia did, that you've really got two paradigms in it.\nOne paradigm is, yes, you can't on a broad global scale\ndepend upon the prescriptions of doctors to guarantee that\nthe drugs the patients are going to get are safe. That's\nnumber 1.\nNumber 2 seems to be that so long as you can be\nsure that the doctor is focusing on what you earlier\ncalled sort of the idiosyncracies of a particular patient,\nso long as we know the doctor is really paying attention\nto detail, we can tolerate it up to a point, and the\nproblem that the Congress I thought was addressing is, how\ndo we draw the line so that we don't get a situation in\nwhich the doctor seems to be addressing idiosyncracies,\ni.e., he writes a prescription, but the volume gets so\ngreat that you know that that is not going on, and the act\nseems to have two different answers. One answer is, don't\nadvertise, because we know what that may lead to, and the\nother answer is, a restriction on volume that pharmacies\ncan write, or can produce.\nThe question, I guess, that's bothering all of\nus is, why do you need the advertising in addition to the\nvolume restriction. You can have it both ways, and you\ncan have it both ways by enforcing the volume restriction.\nMR. KNEEDLER: The volume restriction is on the\naggregate number of compounded drugs.\nQUESTION: Then have a narrower volume\nrestriction.\nMR. KNEEDLER: But a drug that --\nQUESTION: Why can't a narrow volume restriction\nwork?\nMR. KNEEDLER: A drug-by-drug volume restriction\nwould be extraordinarily difficult to administer, with\nthousands and thousands of pharmacies across the country,\nand having to keep track of particular patient's names --\nQUESTION: Then have a lower -- then why not\nhave a lower aggregate?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Again, Congress, we think, was\nentitled to look at the conduct of the pharmacist and take\nthe pharmacist at his word. If he stops being a\npharmacist --\nQUESTION: No, but that begs the question,\nbecause you know, the question is, under Central Hudson,\nis the pharmacist entitled to have his word, and --\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, under --\nQUESTION: And why can the object not be\naccomplished by restrictions in volume rather than\nrestrictions on speech?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Because the restrictions on\nvolume is directed at the overall character of the\npharmacist. The restriction on the solicitation and\nadvertising of a particular product is exactly what the\nFood and Drug Act is directed at, which is the promotion\nof a new drug, not just a volume, but a new drug, and\nCongress was specifically concerned about that as well.\nIf I could reserve the balance of my time.\nQUESTION: Very well, Mr. Kneedler.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Thank you.\nQUESTION: Mr. Hoffman, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF HOWARD M. HOFFMAN\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. HOFFMAN: Mr. Chief Justice, may it please\nthe Court:\nI think in response to some of the Court's\nquestions I would like to give our position, the\nrespondents position and a couple of key points on which\nthere may yet be some confusion, and I start with the\nproposition of why a compounding pharmacist is not a\nmanufacturer, which seems to be a key point before this\nCourt this morning, and I can understand why.\nLet me address what it is the manufacturer does,\nhow he does it, and what a compounding pharmacist does,\nand I will also say that there are in these respondents\nspecialty compounding entities so that when the court was\nconcerned about, they sell their compounds Nation-wide,\nthey dispense them Nation-wide, indeed, some of them do,\nand that's because they happen to specialize in\ncompounding, and do that as a special service,\nspecializing in the interaction, as part of their triad,\nwhere they work with patients, they work with the\nspecialist physician to, for example, treat cancers, treat\ntumors --\nQUESTION: Mr. Hoffman, I take it all of this is\nin the record somewhere.\nMR. HOFFMAN: Yes, Your Honor. It is -- in\nfact, it's in the affidavits in the lower court and the\nverified complaints. They work as part of this triad,\nthey are specialists, and they work with infertility\nspecialists, for example, for the purpose of helping\nchildless couples be able to have children.\nQUESTION: May I ask -- you have large companies\nas clients. Is it lawful, or is it part of the practice\nto compound a large volume, have an inventory available\nthat you then can advertise to the doctors, consumers that\nif you prescribe it, we will sell it to you?\nMR. HOFFMAN: All that is lawful, and all --\nQUESTION: And is that part of the practice that\nthey follow?\nMR. HOFFMAN: That is not what they do, except\nto this limited extent, and I don't want to mislead the\nCourt. Yes, these compounding pharmacists do not compound\nin advance before getting prescription orders vast\ninventories. If that was the Court's question, the answer\nis yes, they do not.\nHowever, do they not at all pre-compound some\ninventory, and the answer is yes, they do, because under\nState laws and under the practice of pharmacy as it is\ndeveloped, if they know that there is, for a certain\ncompound, a historical ordering pattern, a week --\nQUESTION: Under your view of the case, it would\nbe perfectly permissible for them, if they can anticipate\na large volume of sales of a particularly tailor-made\ncompound, they could store up a huge inventory and then\nmarket it later?\nMR. HOFFMAN: No, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Why not?\nMR. HOFFMAN: My concern is with the word, huge\ninventory. If the inventory is merely based upon a week,\nor --\nQUESTION: It's based on a prediction of what\nthe doctors will prescribe.\nMR. HOFFMAN: Over the next week or two, yes.\nQUESTION: Why is it limited to the next week or\ntwo?\nMR. HOFFMAN: Mostly shelf life, and we don't\nknow how long in advance this particular compound --\nQUESTION: The shelf life of some of these drugs\nis only a week?\nMR. HOFFMAN: No, we don't know that, but we\ndon't want to go further than a week or 2 weeks for the\nsake of erring on the side of safety. We don't need to do\nthat, we don't want to do that, and that's not what we do.\nI don't want to leave the impression we stockpile huge\ninventory amounts, because we don't. We just do enough\nwhere there's a series of patients that are now under that\ntreatment to once compound it for that 1 or 2-week period\nif we know those kinds of refill orders are going to be\ncoming back in again.\nQUESTION: Let me ask you what's going to\nhappen -- the Government for some reason did not raise on\ncertiorari the issue of the severability of the\nadvertising provision, so if it is determined here that we\nshould affirm the judgment below, and the cause is not\nseverable, then do we go back to the old regime, which\nwould allow no leeway for compounding?\nMR. HOFFMAN: I'm sorry, it would allow what?\nQUESTION: No leeway for compounding. Do we go\nback to a more limited regime for your clients, I assume?\nMR. HOFFMAN: First, we will revert back to the\npre-FDAMA area, whatever that was. The Government now\nmaintains that this compounding practice, under all\ncircumstances, as they say at page 18 of their opening\nbrief, was always illegal. We strongly disagree with\nthat. We also believe that it's not an issue before this\ncase because it wasn't preserved, but to the extent the\nCourt wants to know about it, there are innumerable\nprovisions in both title 21, which clearly indicate that\ncompounds are not new drugs. The Government itself\nacknowledges, even under FDAMA, it would not, and it is\nnot able to submit compounds for pre-market approval,\nbecause of the extemporaneous numbers in which the need\nfor them arises.\nI really want to go back, if I may, to\nmanufacturing versus compounding, and that we somehow\nconfuse the fact that once a volume reaches a certain\nlevel, it's suddenly manufacturing and not compounding,\nand that isn't the case at all, and let me explain why,\nand by the way, these are distinctions that are both\ncovered in section 360(a)(1) -- at least one of them is --\nin title 21 of the United States Code, and also in the\nState statutes governing pharmacy, and regulating pharmacy\nof each of the several States.\nQUESTION: Mr. Hoffman, in doing that, would you\ntake into account what Mr. Kneedler told us this morning,\nbecause I put the question to him, what is the difference,\nand he said, the Government's position is, compounding is\na form of making a new drug, that everything fits under\nthe new drug, and that this section is designed to allow a\nlimited kind of new drug-making. In other words, you are\ntelling us that there are two categories, compounding and\nmanufacturing. The Government is saying, there are new\ndrugs and, by the grace of Congress, we're allowing some\nof those new drugs to escape the full process.\nNow, you have told us in your brief that there's\na bright line between compounding and manufacturing. In\ntelling us what that bright line is, will you also say how\nyou respond to the Government that says, we define\neverything as a new drug?\nMR. HOFFMAN: And to address that, Your Honor,\nwe turn to 21 United States Code, section 321(p)(1), which\ndefines a new drug, and the Government talks about --\nQUESTION: Where is that? Is that in the\nbriefs?\nMR. HOFFMAN: It's cited in the briefs.\nQUESTION: Is it --\nMR. HOFFMAN: It's referenced in the briefs.\nIt's in Roman II of our response brief, 321(p)(1).\nQUESTION: Is the text there, or just the\ncitation?\nMR. HOFFMAN: Just the reference. It's the\ncitation. The text is not in the brief.\nMr. Kneedler has it. Where is it from? It's in\nsection 5(a) of the petition. Thank you.\nAnd Your Honor, on that, under that it says that\nnew drugs need to be submitted for testing to be generally\nrecognized for safety and efficacy. The Government\nacknowledges throughout, in all the pleadings in this\ncase, in all the --\nQUESTION: I'm sorry, it's not 5a of the\npetition. 5a of the --\nMR. HOFFMAN: It's on page 5 -- I'm sorry, 85a.\nQUESTION: 85a, thank you.\nMR. HOFFMAN: And in that section it talks about\nsubmitting to the FDA for pre-market approval testing to\ndetermine safety and efficacy. Throughout, in the\nGovernment's briefs, the Government's briefs acknowledge\nthat that is not possible for compounds. Compounds are\nincapable of being treated as new drugs, and that is\nbecause they appear so infrequently that you can't get a\nstatistical data base to determine to the scientific\ncertainty --\nQUESTION: I have difficulty with saying it's so\ninfrequent, on the one hand, and you want to engage in\nnational advertising on the other hand.\nMR. HOFFMAN: I'm sorry, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: You say it's so infrequently used,\nbut then you say you want the right to advertise\nnationally.\nMR. HOFFMAN: Let us also talk about the\nnational advertising that we allegedly do, and I don't --\nI think I will come back to respond to the Court's\nquestion. I hope I do.\nQUESTION: You know, you say the national\nadvertising that you allegedly do, well, there's an\nallegation in your complaint which I presume you don't\nreally want to abandon, that advertising and promotion\nessential to do business in a market national in scope,\nand to inform physicians and patients of availability and\nbenefits of the special class, specific classes and types\nof drugs the plaintiff compounds.\nMR. HOFFMAN: But the Government keeps asserting\nthat what we are advertising is finished products, and\nthey try to impress upon the Court, which is absolutely\nuntrue, that the finished product sits on shelves waiting\nto be shipped out in bulk to individuals or to middle\npeople. That's just not what we do.\nThe advertising we do is to tell mostly the\nscientific community, nurses, medical care providers,\nmostly physicians, and at that special physicians --\nQUESTION: Well, you say in your complaint, you\nadd patients, too.\nMR. HOFFMAN: And to patients, yes, that there\nare ingredients that are capable of being compounded, and\nthen in working with the physician, a mixture of\ningredients, together with the inactive ingredients, will\nbe compounded into a delivery format that's best suitable\nfor a patient, be it a suppository form, an injectable\nform, an oral form, a pill, a patch form, et cetera.\nQUESTION: Mr. Hoffman, what you're telling us\nis something any doctor would know. Of course they know\nthat things can be compounded and put in various forms.\nDoesn't your advertising get down to something pretty\nspecific?\nMR. HOFFMAN: It is specific in the ingredients\nthat we list as being capable of being put into a compound\nsuitable for a particular patient.\nQUESTION: And don't you key it to a particular\ncompound for a particular condition, or a particular kind\nof patient?\nMR. HOFFMAN: It will lead to a particular\ncompound in a particular dosage, worked out together\nbetween the pharmacist, the patient, and the physician --\nQUESTION: All right. Isn't that, therefore,\nwhere your argument is weakest? You're arguing that\nthere -- that compounding cannot be manufacturing, because\ncompounding is essentially patient-specific. It is\nidiosyncratic in the sense that Mr. Kneedler used the term\nand yet, for your advertising to be of any value and,\nindeed, as you have just described the advertising, you're\ngetting beyond specific patients. You're getting into\nclasses of patients, and when you get into classes of\npatients, this neat distinction that you draw dissolves.\nMR. HOFFMAN: We're getting into classes of\ndrugs, and we're getting --\nQUESTION: All right, classes of drugs and\nclasses of drug-takers. It's the same point.\nMR. HOFFMAN: And if there are classes of\npatients that require those classes of drugs, physicians\ndo not know, always, what is available for their\nparticular patient, and they have to --\nQUESTION: That's -- I'm sure that's true --\nMR. HOFFMAN: Correct.\nQUESTION: -- and that's a different point, but\nI mean, this neat distinction between the, in effect, the\nmass manufacturer and purely idiosyncratic compounding\njust isn't a neat distinction.\nMR. HOFFMAN: And we do not mass manufacture,\nand for some reason -- I apologize terribly that I'm not\nmaking that point, because let me explain what we do do.\nQUESTION: Let me just say, my concern here is\nthat you're telling us what the general practice of your\nparticular client is. I thought what we were hearing was\nthe legal question whether or not the Government may\nforbid you from advertising that you compound a specific\ndrug, and it may be that that's not what you usually do.\nMR. HOFFMAN: Correct.\nQUESTION: But that's the question that we have\nbefore us, and if we affirm the judgment in your favor,\nyou are going to be allowed to do advertising in a lot\nmore specific ways than you now describe, and that's the\nlegal issue we have to decide.\nMR. HOFFMAN: That's correct, and given what the\nGovernment-asserted interests are, that is to protect\npublic safety, through theoretically ineffective and\nunsafe drugs, then the ban on advertising doesn't do that\nat all. In fact, FDAMA had in it the laudable sections\nwhich would have, in fact, been specifically addressed,\nwhich until the Ninth Circuit were still a part of FDAMA,\nonly the advertising ban until then hadn't been held\nunconstitutional.\nQUESTION: Well, but the advertising ban is\nsurely devoted to keeping demand down, is it not?\nMR. HOFFMAN: Well, it seems to be, that is\ncorrect, and that is a most inappropriate way to address\ndemand, by withholding truthful information from patients\nand physicians who might benefit from that.\nQUESTION: Well, why doesn't it specifically\njust -- what they say, I gather, it's one thing for a\ndoctor, together with his patient, to understand the\npatient's allergy, or the hesitancy to swallow a pill, and\nsay to the druggist, will you adjust this. They want to\npermit that.\nWhat they don't want to permit is the kind of\nadvertising which is a form of soliciting, which leads\nlots of patients, as I might -- or you might. Suppose\nthey found something good for baldness, and suppose you\ncould only do it through compounding, and I read that in\nthe newspaper, I go to my doctor and I say, you know, the\ndruggist over here, I saw it on the Internet, is there\nanything -- he says, is it safe? I guess so, I say,\nthat's what it said on the Internet. He looks it up\nthere, and he prescribes that in reaction to what I want,\nrather than his thinking of it because of my special need.\nNow, once that happens, they say, you will see\nwidespread demand for certain drugs where there has been\nno double-blind study, there has been no normal testing,\nthere's nothing here but the word of the pharmacist, and\nthat is not sufficient to protect the public health and\nsafety.\nNow, you say that that advertising ban serves no\npurpose, they say, that's the purpose, so what's wrong\nwith that argument?\nMR. HOFFMAN: There are many wrongs with that,\nand let me explain. First of all, it denigrates the role\nof the pharmacist. It assumes that there's not a dialogue\nthat commences, for example, with the pharmacist.\nQUESTION: There's a dialogue, but what they\nhaven't had is the double-blind test.\nMR. HOFFMAN: Correct.\nQUESTION: And Congress in this act says, we\ndon't want dialogue. We want double-blind studies before\nwe let something go out into the marketplace, that's what\nthey say, and that isn't here.\nMR. HOFFMAN: And the Government won't even\nchange that, their intent of reducing volume theoretically\nis to protect widespread --\nQUESTION: Oh, it's not quite reducing volume.\nIt might be that there are 10 million children who have a\nhard time taking pills. It's to make certain that the\ndemand initiates with the doctor and the patient, and the\ndoctor recognizes the need of the patient, rather than a\nresponse to solicitation. That's the purpose, and it's\nnot quite volume.\nMR. HOFFMAN: Right, and at the end of the day,\nbefore any drug can be dispensed, the physician has to\nwrite a prescription, he has to approve it, and it makes\nno difference at which end of the spectrum it commences,\nbecause it always ends up with the physician.\nQUESTION: It makes no difference. If that's\ntrue, why when I turn on the television set do I see\nadvertisement after advertisement asking me to ask my\ndoctor for -- and now, you fill in the blank -- if it\nmakes no difference?\nMR. HOFFMAN: What's the harm in the patient\ngoing to the physician?\nQUESTION: The harm is that there are no double-\nblind studies for this particular test, and therefore,\nwhile we'll make an exception where the doctor initiates\nthis together with the patient, we don't want Breyer and\nhis friends seeing this on television and putting pressure\non their doctors.\nNow, that may sound a little vague, but what the\nCongress says, and what the FDA says, is that's necessary\nto protect the public health, and what they say is not\nwithout plausibility.\nMR. HOFFMAN: There are innumerable\nopportunities to preserve and protect the public safety\nwithout resorting to First Amendment restriction.\nQUESTION: Of course, the advertising man\ndoesn't just apply that advertising to the general public.\nYou cannot advertise to doctors, either.\nMR. HOFFMAN: I did not hear, I'm sorry.\nQUESTION: Does the advertising ban apply only\nto advertising to the general public? My understanding\nis, it applies to all advertising.\nMR. HOFFMAN: And it's not just --\nQUESTION: My understanding also is that most of\nyour advertising does not go to the general public, but\ngoes to the doctors and medical professionals.\nMR. HOFFMAN: That is correct. First of all --\nQUESTION: So it is not a matter of getting John\nQ. Public to put pressure on his doctor.\nMR. HOFFMAN: And it is not just advertising.\nIt is even the promotion and solicitation. As the lower\ncourt pointed out -- I think it was the Ninth Circuit, I\nforget which, where it did not find or understand the\nrationale for why the patient or the doctor would have to\nask the critical question, what's the best thing for this\npatient, or what's the best thing for me, because they\nwould first have to ask the question.\nAnd the whole concept of promotion and\nsolicitation -- forget about just advertising.\nAdvertising conjures up a specific type of sales provoking\ntelevision ad, billboard ads, but pharmacists, as part of\nthe canon of their ethics, is required as a professional,\nas part of the triad, who is not just a passive order-\ntaker, who doesn't just count out and push pills, but a\nperson who plays a scientific role in the context, he has\nto be able to on his own speak out and say, consistent\nwith the canons of his professions, this is better for\nyou. This is what the doctor brought in.\nQUESTION: Well, but --\nMR. HOFFMAN: I --\nQUESTION: -- it's a little less chummy than you\nmake it sound, I think, judging from your complaint. You\nhave seven clients. They dispense in interstate commerce\n5 percent of their total sales, which amounts to 60 or 95\npercent of their total sales in another capacity, and you\nsell all over the country, do you not?\nMR. HOFFMAN: We do.\nQUESTION: Well, then, your portrait of the\nintimate relationship between the pharmacist and the\ndoctor I think is a little, perhaps, overblown.\nMR. HOFFMAN: It is -- with all due respect,\nYour Honor, it is not, and let me explain why. We have\nthe same patient profiles in our records, notwithstanding\nthat there may be a half-a-country separating patient and\npharmacist. We have 800 numbers that the patients call in\non, just as you would call to a local pharmacist.\nThe only thing that is different is, there's a\nlittle bit more distance. It may take an extra day or\nhalf-day to get the prescription out there, but that\nintimacy in the relationship via the patient profiles, via\nthe ability to consult, is the same with these pharmacists\nas it is with the corner druggist, if you will.\nQUESTION: Mr. Hoffman, perhaps I've deflected\nyou before, but you were going to tell us something about\nthis bright line between what's a manufactured drug and\nwhat's a compounded drug.\nMR. HOFFMAN: Yes, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: So how do we tell whether one is a\ncompound and whether it's a new drug?\nMR. HOFFMAN: Under Federal statute, for\nexample, manufacturing is defined as distribution to\nsomeone other than the ultimate consumer, and that's found\nin 21 United States Code, section 360(a)(1). 360(a)(1)\ndefines manufacturing as distribution to a middle man, or\na distributor, or a wholesale -- wholesaler, so right\naway, the first distinction is the pharmacist only\ndispenses directly to the patient in the context of the\ntriad. He's available for consultation, he gives\ndirections on use, he has the patient profile on his\nrecords. He knows what drug interactions there may or may\nnot be with this particular drug and this particular\npatient.\nSecond of all -- and, of course, the\nmanufacturer doesn't do that, having no relationship with\nthe physician, having no relationship with the patient.\nIn addition to that, they do, manufacturers do a\none-size-fits-all type of product. They have determined\nthat there is this vast, multimillion person individual\nneed for a particular drug, and they fit that niche, and\nthey play to it, and they market to it, and they\nmanufacture for it, unlike --\nQUESTION: The definition in 360(a)(1) applies\nequally to manufacturing and compounding.\nQUESTION: And compounding, yes.\nMR. HOFFMAN: I'm sorry.\nQUESTION: The definition in 360(a)(1) is a\ndefinition of the term, manufacturing, preparation,\npropagation, compounding or processing.\nMR. HOFFMAN: Then I may have --\nQUESTION: It describes them in the same\ndefinition.\nMR. HOFFMAN: I may have mis-cited. Then it's\n368, but it talks about manufacturing, and I apologize\nthat I don't have that number.\nQUESTION: Oh, this talks about manufacturing,\nbut it also -- what it says is, manufacturing as well as\ncompounding shall include repackaging or otherwise\nchanging the container in furtherance of the distribution.\nMR. HOFFMAN: Correct.\nQUESTION: It has nothing to do with what we're\ntalking about here. What's the other section you\nwanted --\nMR. HOFFMAN: And the other section will be\nsection 374(a)(2).\nQUESTION: 374(a)(2).\nMR. HOFFMAN: 374 -- actually, it's 374(2), or\n360(g)(2). They're identical.\nQUESTION: Where do we find these?\nMR. HOFFMAN: Your Honor, I'm sorry, I don't\nhave the reference cites here.\nQUESTION: Well, I -- you know, I found --\nQUESTION: 106(a).\nMR. HOFFMAN: I'm sorry.\nQUESTION: 106(a).\nQUESTION: Well, can I turn to 321(p), which is\nthe other section --\nMR. HOFFMAN: Yes, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: -- you cited earlier, and you said\nthat that section makes clear that compounding --\nQUESTION: What page are you on?\nQUESTION: That's 85a of the Government's\npetition. You said that 321(p) makes clear that\ncompounding is not manufacture of a new drug?\nMR. HOFFMAN: No. What I said was, it defines\nnew drugs, and under a new drug, it has to be capable of\nbeing submitted to the FDA's new drug process. The\nGovernment --\nQUESTION: You said more than it just defines\nnew drug. You said that that definition makes it clear\nthat compounding isn't included.\nMR. HOFFMAN: No, but by --\nQUESTION: And that that's why it's no problem\nto you if we invalidate the whole statute and you go back\nto the status quo ante, because you say compounding is not\na new drug anyway, right?\nMR. HOFFMAN: That's correct.\nQUESTION: That was the context in which it came\nup.\nMR. HOFFMAN: It is not a problem.\nQUESTION: Okay.\nMR. HOFFMAN: We would be delighted --\nQUESTION: Now, what is it in that definition\nthat you think exempts compounding?\nMR. HOFFMAN: Because it talks about drugs that\nare capable of being submitted, and the Government itself\nacknowledges that we cannot submit compounds for new drug\napproval --\nQUESTION: I don't see anything in the\ndefinition that says -- I mean, we went through this in\nthe tobacco case. I thought that a new drug was any drug,\nexcept grass.\nMR. HOFFMAN: But how can it be a new drug that\ncannot be tested?\nQUESTION: I don't know. That's why I'm just\nsaying --\nMR. HOFFMAN: Right.\nQUESTION: -- that's what it says here, so if\nthere is some exception for some of these things --\nMR. HOFFMAN: No.\nQUESTION: I don't see it --\nMR. HOFFMAN: I really think --\nQUESTION: Where does it say capable of being\nsubmitted? I -- where does it say capable of -- that's\nnot --\nMR. HOFFMAN: But you have to read it into --\nthe word -- it does not use the words, capable of. It\nsays -- it says, has to be --\nQUESTION: Will you read it verbatim, please,\ninstead of just trying to conjure it up?\nMR. HOFFMAN: It -- what I was referring to is,\nany drug which is not generally recognized among experts,\nqualified by science as safe and effective, the case law\nunder that determines that in order to determine safety\nand efficacy, the drug has to be submitted to this\nexhaustive FDA free market approval process. The\nGovernment acknowledges that that costs hundreds of\nmillions of dollars. It also requires, as case law\nidentifies, a huge data base from which to be able to draw\nand determine the safety and effect -- efficacy, none of\nwhich can be done for --\nQUESTION: That's why they want the exception.\nOf course you're right about that. They want the\nexception, but the issue before us concerns one part of\nthe definition of the exception, and so I don't really see\nwhat you're talking about now has to do with that.\nI mean the real issue, it seemed to me, was what\nwe've been trying to get, which is the pros and cons of\ndefining this exception a particular way.\nMR. HOFFMAN: Okay, because there would have\nbeen ways to make compounds safe and effective, and these\nways would have been -- and they were in FDAMA until they\nwere held not severable by the Ninth Circuits, and this\nwas the use of ingredients that appear in the\npharmacopeia. We took no quarrel with that. That seemed\nto be something that addressed the safety of the public.\nIt also required that the Secretary prepare some\nlists. One of them was, if there was an ingredient that\nwas necessary for compounding, the Secretary could be\npetitioned -- I'm sorry, if there was an ingredient\nnecessary that didn't appear in the pharmacopeia, the\nSecretary could be petitioned to put onto that list\nsomething that the Secretary would determine was safe and\neffective.\nIf there was something that was established that\nwas not safe and effective for compounding, FDAMA included\na list to be prepared by the Secretary to forbid these\nkinds of products to be used as ingredients in\ncompounding. Compounding would have to be done by\nlicensed physicians. It would have to be done by licensed\npharmacists. These were all the conduct-specific related\nregulations that one would applaud, that Congress has a\nright to do.\nBut to try to reduce the demand, and try to keep\ntruthful information by restrictions on First Amendment\nis, this is what's offensive about that part of FDAMA. We\ndidn't seek to have the conduct-related provisions\nstricken, and in fact it was the Government that it,\nitself put it in, then went to the Ninth Circuit and said,\nwell, we can't have the First Amendment restriction, we\ndon't want the others, either.\nI also want to point out that when it comes to\nmanufacturing, manufacturing, going back to Justice\nGinsburg's question, we sell it retail, they sell it\nwholesale. We sell pursuant to a prescription. They sell\njust to a middle man distributor. We provide\nconsultation. There is no consultation when it comes to a\nmanufacturer.\nThere's also, on this issue of widespreadedness,\nthe degree, or the volume concern. First of all, we can\nonly dispense, and we routinely only prepare upon receipt\nof a pharmacist's -- of a physician's prescription, but in\naddition to that, if volume were such a concern, there was\nunlimited intrastate transportation allowed, dispensing of\npharmaceuticals, so I seriously question, for example,\nwhether or not they even -- FDAMA even addressed\nadequately the volumes, the volume restrictions it was\ntrying to impose.\nAlso, for example, positron emissions\ncompounding, and radiopharmaceutical compounding were\nexempted from the operation of FDAMA, so that potentially\nthe most lethal, most dangerous of all the compounds could\nbe advertised, promoted, solicited, and no pharmacopeia\ningredients could have been used for them.\nThey also provided for industry transportation\nin the event of a memorandum of understanding. Up to 20\npercent of the total pharmaceutical sales by that pharmacy\ncould be shipped intrastate, so that if, for example,\nthere were five compounding pharmacists in a State, they\ncould fill 100 percent of the outside -- of the out-of-\nState demand, so at the end of the day, as in Greater New\nOrleans, this case -- I'm sorry, this statute was so\nriddled with exemptions -- with exceptions that undermined\nthe Government's own very purpose, that it would fail just\nbecause it was simply irrational.\nAs the Court pointed out already, it is\nirrational to suggest that only speech that's provoked by\nthe physician can be unregulated, whereas the same speech\nin the context of a professional relationship as provoked\nby the pharmacist, then somehow it becomes\nunconstitutional.\nIn the lower court we pointed out the following.\nThat means under this statute a pharmacist would have to\nhave a little sign on his counter. On this little sign it\nwould say, please ask me to tell you what I think you\nshould know, but because of FDAMA, I, under restrictions\non advertising, promotion, solicitation, am forbidden from\ntelling you.\nIf there are no further questions, I shall\nconclude.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Hoffman.\nMr. Kneedler, you have 3 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. KNEEDLER: Mr. Chief Justice, what Congress\nwas trying to do here was to make sure that the narrow\nexemption that it intended did not swallow the critical\ngeneral rule that new drugs have to be submitted to prior\napproval.\nThe question of volume limitations has been\nraised. The act contains an aggregate volume limitation\nbut, as I mentioned, individual drug-by-drug volume\nlimitations would be very difficult to administer, and\nCongress was not required to go down that path, but an\nadditional point about that is that if you look -- if you\nadd up a couple of prescriptions by each pharmacy, Nation-\nwide you will be talking about a pretty large volume of a\nnew drug, which is precisely the sort of thing that should\nbe submitted to the FDA for prior approval.\nThe act does not just prohibit manufacturing new\ndrugs, it prohibits the introduction in interstate\ncommerce of new drugs. It isn't just focused on large\nvolumes, it's focused on individual instances. So are the\nmisbranding and adulteration provisions of the act.\nThe line Congress drew here that includes\nsolicitation and advertising among the conditions was not\ninvented in 1997. In case law it goes all the way back to\n1978 in the Cedars case we mentioned in the brief, where\nthe Court there was trying to define the scope of the\nexpress exemption for pharmacy in registration and\ninspections, and among the factors it says when someone\nsteps out of the traditional pharmacy role was, do they\nengage in promotion of the product.\nThe definition also appears in the Model Rules\nof Good Pharmacy Practice of the State of the National\nAssociation of State Boards of Pharmacy, which says that\npharmacists should not solicit or advertise compounded\ndrugs.\nAll of this represents a general understanding\nthat compounding by pharmacists has to be contemporaneous\nand responsive --\nQUESTION: How does the doctor find out -- how\ndoes the doctor find out that -- he knows that Joe Smith\nthe pharmacist deals with compounding generally. He\nthinks that this patient might use the compounded drug.\nHow does he know that this particular drug can be\ncompounded?\nMR. KNEEDLER: That's what he is supposed --\nQUESTION: How does he find that out?\nMR. KNEEDLER: The pharmacist holds himself out\nas having pharmacy services and expertise, and that's\nwhere the promotion of the consultation and the\nprofessional relationship --\nQUESTION: No, no, but does he have to call the\npharmacy --\nMR. KNEEDLER: No. The pharmacist can advertise\nthat he engages in the pharmacy services.\nQUESTION: Take my question. My question is not\nwhether this pharmacist engages in compounding. We know\nit. How does the doctor know that the pharmacist can\ncompound this drug?\nMR. KNEEDLER: He has to ask.\nUnder respondent's theory, a pharmacist, someone\nholding a pharmacist license presumably could promote\nLaetrile, or could promote Prozac and advertise it to the\nmarket at large, and Congress certainly did not expect\nthat sort of thing.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr.\n"
