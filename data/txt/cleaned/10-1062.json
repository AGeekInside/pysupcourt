The\nEnvironmental Protection Agency.\nMr. Schiff.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF DAMIEN M. SCHIFF\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. SCHIFF: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nMike and Chantell Sackett are here today\nbecause 4 years ago the Environmental Protection Agency\nissued against them a compliance order charging them\nwith violations of the Clean Water Act, requiring that\nthey restore their property to its alleged\npredisturbance wetlands condition, and imposing upon\nthem the threat of tens of thousands of dollars per day\nin civil fines if they did not immediately comply with\nthe order.\nBut in these 4 years, the Sacketts have\nnever been offered a meaningful opportunity for judicial\nreview of the compliance order, an opportunity that they\nare guaranteed under the Due Process Clause and the\nAdministrative Procedure Act.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Of course, there would have\nbeen a daily fine with or without the compliance order,\nwouldn't there, if they were indeed in violation of\nthe -- the Act?\nMR. SCHIFF: Justice Scalia, the fine would\nonly have been attributable to the statute itself. But\nwith the compliance order in effect, essentially, the\nSacketts are now subject to double liability. They can\nbe held liable for the statute as well as for actions\ninconsistent with the compliance order.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: So, Mr. Schiff, your\nunderstanding is that each day your clients are subject\nto $37,500 of fines for the violation of the statute,\nand an additional 37.5 for violation of the compliance\norder. Is that the way you understand the penalties\nscheme to work?\nMR. SCHIFF: Yes -- yes, Justice Kagan. It\nis -- it is in fact, I might add, how the EPA\nunderstands the penalty provisions. In its brief at\npages 30 and 31, they essentially concede that the\nexistence of the compliance order does subject the\nSacketts to liability for both violations of the statute\nas well as violations of the compliance order.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But the court of appeals\ndid say that there would be no independent liability\nunder the -- for violation of the compliance order.\nThat is, unless there was a violation of the statute,\nthere would be no penalty for violation of the\ncompliance order.\nMR. SCHIFF: That is correct, Justice\nGinsburg. The court held that as a predicate for any\nliability for a compliance order violation, there must\nbe first a finding of a statutory violation. But that\ndoesn't change the fact -- even according to the Ninth\nCircuit, doesn't change the fact that one can still be\nheld liable for both, that there is a distinct civil\nliability that is traceable only to the compliance\norder.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What -- what kind of\nreview are you seeking? I mean, one thing you could say\nis you dispute that this property is subject to the Act.\nThat might be a question that's reviewable. Do you seek\nmore than that? Do you seek review at this stage of\nanything more than whether the property is subject to\nthe Act?\nMR. SCHIFF: No, Your Honor, we seek review\nof that jurisdictional question as it is incorporated\ninto the compliance order. The compliance order is the\nagency action for which we believe the Sacketts have a\nright of review under the Administrative Procedure Act.\nAnd our challenge under the APA to the compliance order\nis precisely that there is no jurisdiction and,\ntherefore, there has been no statutory violation.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Can you tell me, what\nwould be the scope of your holding? How would -- how\nwould -- if you could write the opinion for the Court on\nthis part of your case, what would the rule be?\nI mean, health inspectors go into\nrestaurants all the time and say: Unless you fix this,\nI'm going to give you a citation. Fire inspectors, the\nsame thing. And I'm -- I'm wondering how your general\ntheory or your general principle that you want us to\nadopt would fit with that rather routine type of\nenforcement?\nMR. SCHIFF: Well, Justice Kennedy, we do\nnot believe that what we are articulating extends as far\nas -- as creating a right under the APA for review\nbecause a health inspector has come onto your property.\nAll we're arguing is that the compliance order is a\nfinal agency action; it has stopped the Sacketts home\nbuilding; it has imposed upon them significant civil\nliability; and, therefore, they should have a right\nunder the APA --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So, this is under -- this\nis under the APA.\nMR. SCHIFF: Correct.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: This is the APA prong of\nyour argument.\nMR. SCHIFF: Correct, Justice Kennedy. And\n-- and we should emphasize that we believe that the\nSacketts' due process rights can be satisfied by\nallowing their APA cause of action to go forward.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It seems to me there --\nthere's another distinction, a more significant one,\nbetween routine inspections by fire marshals or -- or\nrestaurant inspectors, and that is that if you -- if you\ndisobey their order, you're not subjected to any more\nsubstantial liability than -- than you would have been\nsubjected to had they not issued the order.\nIt isn't the order that -- that produces\nany -- any new fine, is it?\nMR. SCHIFF: That is exactly correct,\nJustice Scalia. That's -- that's the principal\ndistinction between the compliance order in this case\nand many of the agency actions that the EPA has set\nforth in its brief.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if the sanction\nimposed each day was not the $37,000, but was $10? If\nyou don't comply, you know, we can bring an action any\ntime to enforce this, and you'll be subject to the\nstatutory maximum, but during the period, the additional\nsanction for the -- under the administrative order, or\nthe compliance order, is $10 a day.\nMR. SCHIFF: Mr. Chief Justice, I don't\nbelieve that would change the Court's finality analysis\nunder Bennett. The -- the fact that the fine is only\n$10 as opposed to 37,000 doesn't --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But it might go to\nadequacy of judicial review, the adequacy of the\njudicial review that would come when the EPA brings the\nenforcement action. I understood your argument to be\nthat there was a significant extortion impact from the\nfact that these were such significant fines -- double,\nas you say -- that you could rack up for 5 years. But\nif it's only $10 a day, that takes a lot of the wind out\nof your sails, doesn't it?\nMR. SCHIFF: Well, to begin with,\nMr. Chief Justice, in addition to the independent\nliability that the compliance order imposes, there are\nother legal effects. Even if the compliance order had\nno independent liability, there are other legal effects\nthat even EPA has conceded to. For example, the\nexistence of the compliance order makes it materially,\nsubstantially more difficult for the Sacketts to apply\nfor an after-the-fact permit. A higher --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: To apply for a --\nMR. SCHIFF: For an after-the-fact permit.\nThe -- once an compliance order is issued, an\nafter-the-fact permit is -- can only be applied for\nunder the \"clearly appropriate\" standard in the Corps's\nregulations.\nBut -- but, Mr. Chief Justice, in response\nto the question, yes, of course, the amount of the fine\ncertainly factors into meaningfulness of review. It\nfactors into coerciveness. But even if there were no\nfines, there is -- attributable to the compliance order,\nthere is still the fact that the Sacketts cannot\nindependently initiate, cannot trigger, review of the\ncompliance order.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What -- what do you care?\nI mean, you have the fines, don't you? So, why don't\nyou just argue that? Why do we have to wrestle with the\nmore difficult situation where there are no fines? It's\nconceded that there are fines, isn't it?\nMR. SCHIFF: That's correct, Justice Scalia.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So, you know, sufficient\nunto the day the evil thereof. We don't have to\nconsider more difficult cases.\nBut, as I understand it, you can get review\nby applying for an after-the-fact permit from the Corps,\nand the only -- the only expense you would incur in\norder to get that would be to fill in, as the order\nrequires you to do, which is something like, what,\n$27,500 or so?\nMR. SCHIFF: Well, Justice Scalia --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Is that such a hard -- a\nhard hit? That's a lot less than, you know, 37.5 a day.\nMR. SCHIFF: Well, the difficulty,\nJustice Scalia, is that the Sacketts cannot obtain\njudicial review of the compliance order within the\ncontext of the permitting process. The compliance order\nis the order that has caused the deprivation, that has\nimposed upon the Sacketts this double liability.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, but their challenge\nto the compliance order is simply that they don't have\nwetlands. It's the jurisdiction of the EPA. And surely\nthat can be raised in the -- before the Corps of\nEngineers, no?\nMR. SCHIFF: That issue might be raised,\nYour Honor, but the Sacketts could never get review of\nthat issue within the context of the compliance order,\nwhich is, of course, the -- the agency action that has\ncaused their harm. Moreover, there's frankly no\nguarantee that the Sacketts could even get into court\nthrough the permitting process, because the Corps might\nvery well say, well, you know, we don't believe that\nthere are wetlands on the property; and so, we're not\ngoing to issue you a permit. And, therefore, there is\nnothing for the Sacketts to then litigate over in\nFederal court.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: How long does it take to\nget one of those after-the-fact permits?\nMR. SCHIFF: There -- there is a study, Your\nHonor. In terms of averages, I think it's about a year.\nBut there's nothing in our record that would show\nnecessarily that the Sacketts are eligible for a\nnationwide permit. But more importantly is the fact\nthat the permitting process doesn't provide review of\nthe burden of the deprivation that the Sacketts are\nenduring right now.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Could the -- I don't\nunderstand what exactly you might get from the Army\nCorps of Engineers. Obviously, they might give you a\npermit, and I take it that cuts off liability; you can\ndo what you're hoping to do. They might say you don't\nget a permit because these are wetlands. Can they do\nsomething in the middle, which is: It's kind of hard\nfor us to tell; you're on your own?\nMR. SCHIFF: Very much so. In addition to\nsaying we're not going to issue a permit because we\ndon't believe there are wetlands on the property, they\ncould also say, under the regulations that even EPA\ncites in its brief, that we're not even going to\nentertain your after-the-fact permit application while\nthe compliance order is still outstanding, meaning that\nyou will likely have to comply, be fully deprived, with\neverything the compliance order says, allow EPA onto\nyour property, requiring significant expensive\nrestoration of your property to its alleged wetlands\nstate, before you even have the privilege of applying\nfor a permit.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Is that what -- is that\nwhat's critical, Mr. Schiff? If that were not true, if\nyou could go in, even with the compliance order on your\nproperty, and get an adjudication of whether you had\nwetlands in the context of an after-the-fact permit\nproceeding, would that be sufficient?\nMR. SCHIFF: No, it would not, Justice\nKagan, because, again, the fact is that the -- the\ncompliance order is -- well, the permitting process is\nan entirely separate agency action. It's -- it's an\nagency action that the Army Corps goes through. The\nSacketts could get no review of the -- of the compliance\norder.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Well, why does that matter?\nYou're getting review of the question that you care\nabout, which is the question whether you have wetlands\non your property. And if they said you don't have\nwetlands on your property, here's a permit, your\nproblems are finished.\nMR. SCHIFF: Justice Kagan, the difficulty\nis that that judicial decision would have no impact and\nwould not remedy the deprivation that the Sacketts are\ncurrently enduring.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Do they issue permits when\nthere are no wetlands? I thought it was a permit\nallowing you to do something on wetlands which otherwise\nwould -- would not be allowed?\nMR. SCHIFF: That's -- that's correct,\nJustice Scalia.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So, if they decide that\nthere's -- that it's not a wetland, what do they -- what\ndo they do? They do nothing? Is that it?\nMR. SCHIFF: That's my understanding. The\nCorps would simply say there's nothing to permit because\nthere are no wetlands to fill. But the difficult --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But then the compliance\norder would automatically be vacated? I mean, doesn't\nthe compliance order presume that they are wetlands?\nHasn't the agency already made that determination?\nMR. SCHIFF: The difficulty,\nJustice Kennedy, is that we're talking about two\nagencies. And this -- this is really the -- why -- one\nadditional reason why the permitting process is -- is an\ninapt solution to the Sacketts' problem. The Sacketts\nhave been injured by EPA, by the compliance order. And\nnow --\nJUSTICE ALITO: That seems very strange for\nthat -- for a party to apply for a permit on -- on the\nground that they don't need a permit at all. If you\napply for a permit, is the Army Corps of Engineers going\nto decide whether you -- whether it's wetlands? Isn't\nit presupposed if you're applying for a permit that you\n-- you need one because there's -- they are wetlands?\nMR. SCHIFF: That's -- that's exactly right,\nJustice Alito. The -- that underscores how bizarre it\nis to force the Sacketts to go through a process.\nThey've been injured by the EPA, by a compliance order,\nand they're told they must initiate an entirely separate\nadministrative action with an entirely different agency\nin order to get indirect, tangential, possible review of\nthe compliance order that has turned their world upside\ndown for the last 4 years.\nThe -- that is why the permitting process\ncannot provide meaningful judicial review to the\nSacketts. That's why the Administrative Procedure Act\nis the ready-made answer. And, frankly, there's no\nindication that Congress intended anything other than\nthe Administrative Procedure Act to provide an adequate\nadministrative review for the -- for the adjudication of\ncompliance orders.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What would the standard\nbe that -- before -- you have APA review. So, it's just\nthat -- that the EPA acted reasonably in determining\nthat you have wetlands?\nMR. SCHIFF: Yes, Justice Ginsburg, it would\nbe your typical arbitrary and capricious standard of\nreview, substantial evidence based upon the record that\nwas before the EPA when it made its finding of statutory\nviolation, which is the statutory predicate for the\nissuance of the compliance order.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, wait, wait. Surely,\nyou wouldn't go in and -- and try to fight arbitrary or\ncapricious. It's arbitrary or capricious or otherwise\nin violation of the law. Wouldn't you go in and say\nthat this is in violation of the law?\nMR. SCHIFF: No, exactly, Justice Scalia. I\nmean, I don't mean to limit ourselves to just that one\nstandard of review. But it would be a --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't think that one\nstandard of review would do you very much good, to tell\nyou the truth. They've thought about this. Maybe they\ngot it wrong, but to say it's arbitrary or capricious,\nyou're going to lose.\nMR. SCHIFF: Well, I certainly hope not,\nJustice Scalia. But -- but the difficulty is we don't\neven know at this point what sort of record the EPA has.\nIn fact, the law as it stands now is that EPA doesn't\neven need probable cause to issue a compliance order.\nAnd --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Given -- given the rather\nvague nature of the test that's been adopted for\ndetermining whether something is part of the waters of\nthe United States, wouldn't you have a very difficult\ntime showing that a determination that it was, was\narbitrary and capricious?\nMR. SCHIFF: There's no question,\nJustice Alito, that there -- there -- yes, it would be a\ndifficult time. But that -- just because the Sacketts\nmight have an uphill battle I don't believe is any\nreason to say that they should have no opportunity. I\nmean, as it stands now, they've been told you cannot\nbuild your home, you must convert your property into\nwetlands, and you are being charged $37,500 per day if\nyou don't immediately comply. And yet, you get no day\nin court?\nJUSTICE KAGAN: And, Mr. Schiff, is the way\nyou see this operating that you bring an action\ncontesting on the basis of the arbitrary and capricious\nclause or -- or otherwise not in accordance with law?\nIf -- if then the court rules against you but you\ncontinue to fail to comply, does the EPA then have to\nbring a separate enforcement action?\nMR. SCHIFF: Yes. The only way EPA can\nactually take money away from the Sacketts is by filing\na civil action, but that would be true whether or not\nthe Sacketts bring an APA cause of action.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, you -- would\ncollateral estoppel apply to you because of the judicial\ndetermination on the compliance order in the subsequent\nenforcement action? In other words, you lose. You seek\nAPA review, and the court says, you know, we think it's\na wetland. And then the EPA brings an enforcement\naction. They have to establish it's a wetland. Don't\nthey just attach a copy of the decision?\nMR. SCHIFF: Well, not necessarily,\nMr. Chief Justice, because, for one, the standard of\nreview would be different. It would be -- under the\nAPA, it would be the traditional deference afforded to\nagency action.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, not -- I guess\nI'm back to Justice Scalia's question. This -- it\nstruck me as a purely legal, jurisdictional issue: Are\nthese wetlands or not? And I don't know why you would\ngive deference to the agency's determination on a legal\njurisdictional issue like that.\nMR. SCHIFF: No, you're correct,\nMr. Chief Justice. I mean more in terms of the\nsubstantial evidence standard that usually supports\nagency action under the APA. But -- but certainly here\nthe Sacketts also contend, regardless of questions of --\nof Rapanos and connection to navigable waters, the\nSacketts contend that there are no wetlands at all on\nthis property, and that ultimately is -- is, of course,\na factual question that would be informed by what's in\nthe record.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: But to go back to the Chief\nJustice's --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: If they're wrong about\nthat, if there is a finding in the APA process that\nthese are wetlands, is that the end of it? Or within\nthat, the context of that review, can you say, well,\nthey are wetlands, but only to a minor extent, and these\nconditions were onerous and -- and far more than\nnecessary to protect the wetlands? Can you argue that\nin the APA review? Or is it just up or down: Wetlands,\nyou lose; not wetlands, you win. That's it?\nMR. SCHIFF: No. I mean -- Justice Kennedy,\nwe would argue that, even if there are wetlands on the\nproperty, which we do not believe there are, that --\nthat the compliance order would still be invalidated if\nthere were not a significant nexus between the -- the\nalleged wetlands on the property and some navigable\nwater in the vicinity. But -- but --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Who would review that\nand where? Going back to Justice Kagan's question of --\nlet's assume you went through an APA process, and they\nfound it was wetlands and that the compliance terms\nwere -- had a substantial nexus. What happens when you\ngo into an enforcement action?\nMR. SCHIFF: Well, at that point, then both\nsides get to create a new record, consistent with what\nthe Ninth Circuit held. That --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: So, the Chief Justice's\nsuggestion that there would be preclusion you do not\nagree with?\nMR. SCHIFF: No. In addition to the fact\nthat the standards of review would be different,\npreponderance of the evidence in a civil action as\nopposed to substantial evidence in the APA, it would\nalso be the fact that -- that, even as the Ninth Circuit\nunderstood a civil action, when it goes forward, both\nsides have an opportunity to create a new record or\nto -- to establish by a preponderance of the evidence\nthe elements of -- of the offense.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, does anything get\nestoppel?\nMR. SCHIFF: I'm sorry, Justice --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Does anything get\nestoppel? Assuming it's not a legal question, would the\nfactual findings that there's a substantial nexus\nbetween the remedy ordered and the violation -- would\nthat get estoppel?\nMR. SCHIFF: It -- it would be difficult to\nimagine a case of estoppel, because, again, in the APA\ncontext, it's just based upon the record at the time the\ncompliance order is issued. And so, the records are\nalways going to be different, because the civil action\nwill build upon that administrative record. And then,\nsecondly, in terms of the differing standards of review,\nI suppose one could find a -- a purely factual question\nperhaps that -- where the standards of review wouldn't\nmatter, or a purely legal question, but --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: This wouldn't be a problem\nif -- if this procedure were not employed, if there were\nnot this -- this prior compliance order that issues\nbefore actual suit by the -- by EPA to hold you liable\nfor violating the Act. Then you'd just have one -- one\nsuit, and the -- the issue would be clear as to what\nburden the agency has to sustain. But it's -- it's\nreally the dual nature of this process that creates the\ndifficulty, isn't it?\nMR. SCHIFF: Yes, Justice Scalia, to some\nextent it is, of course, the process that -- that\nCongress --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But that's in the statute.\nThe agency didn't make that up, right? The statute\nprovides for compliance orders, and it calls them\n\"compliance orders,\" doesn't it?\nMR. SCHIFF: It -- it does indeed. And so,\neven if the Sacketts on remand don't get their ideal\nmode of judicial review, something is frankly better\nthan nothing. They have been told for 4 years they\ncannot build their home. They have been threatened with\nruinous civil penalties. And, to date, they have had no\nopportunity for their day in court.\nThe -- the Sacketts cannot trigger an\nenforcement action. I mean, perhaps if Congress had\nwritten the statute differently to allow for some sort\nof judicial review that the Sacketts could -- could\ninitiate for a compliance order, that might -- that\nmight answer, Justice Scalia, your concerns. But that\nis not the statute we have. We have a statute where\nCongress has said EPA can issue a compliance order, and\nwe have in combination with that the presumption in\nfavor of judicial review of final agency action; we have\nthe avoidance canon; all that point to allowing for the\nSacketts to get their day in court and at the same time\nto satisfy and to vindicate Congress's intent.\nCongress wanted EPA to be able to issue\nthese -- these compliance orders. Congress gave\nsignificant statutory penalties for violating these\ncompliance orders. But at the same time, there has to\nbe balance. One cannot tell landowners --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Of course, you know, you're\n-- you're not going to be out of the woods. Even if you\nget this APA review, okay, some of the factual questions\nthat go to whether these are wetlands or not are going\nto be decided giving substantial deference to the\nagency's determination of the facts, right?\nMR. SCHIFF: No, that is correct,\nJustice Scalia. And that --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And so, even if you lose on\nthat, you might still think you can win when the EPA\nfinally brings a -- a civil action seeking to impose a\npenalty, where the burden will be on the EPA without --\nwithout any deference to its factfinding. So, you still\nwon't know where you are, will you?\nMR. SCHIFF: Well --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You've lost one, but you\nmay win the other. You'll have to roll the dice.\nMR. SCHIFF: Well, respectfully,\nJustice Scalia, it's more than rolling the dice. It's\nsubjecting the -- the Sacketts to an interminable\nDamoclean sword, if -- if the only way they can get\nreview is simply waiting, well, when will EPA let the\nsword drop and bring a civil action to enforce this\ncompliance order that who knows how old it is?\nWith EPA's theory of continuing violation,\nthe statute of limitations never even runs. And so, you\nhave the Sacketts who are forever subject to this cloud\nover themselves, cloud over their title. They can't get\nanyone to come onto their property to build their home.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Is there no limitation on\nthe compliance order? It just -- it can be there\nforever until the EPA decides to bring an enforcement\naction?\nMR. SCHIFF: As -- Justice Ginsburg, as EPA\ninterprets the -- the statute of limitations for\ncollecting civil penalties, so long as the \"discharge,\"\nquote, unquote, remains in place, it's considered a\ncontinuing violation. And so, the statute of\nlimitations never even begins to run. And so, Sacketts\nmight -- might build their home and, 10 years down the\nroad, be surprised that here comes EPA with its civil\naction.\nOh, now the Sacketts get judicial review but\nat a significant cost. They can't even enjoy the home\nthat they might build because there is always this cloud\nhanging over them, a cloud that can be dispelled if they\ncan simply have an opportunity, which, Justice Scalia,\nmay not be the best opportunity, but something is better\nthan nothing, an APA cause of action to review the EPA's\nassertion of its authority over their property.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I asked you earlier, in\nthis APA review, would there be any further question\nafter the determination is it wetlands, is it not? And\nyou had said no, that's -- that would be it. But you\nanswered another question that would suggest it may be\nwetlands, but it shouldn't -- there should be -- you\nshould be allowed to build your home anyway.\nMR. SCHIFF: Allow me to clarify, Justice\nGinsburg. In this APA cause of action, the Sacketts\nchallenge the -- the jurisdictional predicate, and that\nis really a two-part determination. One is, are there\nwetlands on the property? And, two, are those wetlands\nsufficiently connected to navigable waters to justify\nFederal regulation? And both of those fit into our\nfirst claim for relief, our APA cause of action.\nAnd so, in this case, that is what our APA\ncause of action on remand would look like. We would say\nlet's look at the -- at the record that EPA has\nassembled at the time it issued the compliance order,\nand does that record support the finding of statutory\nviolation?\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You're conceding that\nthe compliance order, assuming there is a violation, is\nall right? You're not challenging any of the terms of\nthe compliance order other than the finding of a\nviolation?\nMR. SCHIFF: That -- that is correct,\nJustice Sotomayor. Yes, that is correct. That is all\nthat we are challenging.\nMr. Chief Justice, if I may reserve the\nbalance of my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Stewart.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM L. STEWART\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. STEWART: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nI'd like to begin with the question of\ndouble penalties because I think it helps to clarify\nexactly what the compliance order does and does not do\nin terms of altering the legal regime to which the\nSacketts are subject.\nThe compliance order is intended to specify\nthe violation that EPA believes to have occurred and the\nmeasures that EPA believes are necessary in order to\nachieve prospective compliance. And the statute does\nprovide separately for penalties for violating the\nstatute and penalties for violating the compliance\norder.\nAnd, as an exercise of our duty of candor to\nthe Court, we acknowledged in our brief that the\nGovernment reads the statute to allow the legal\npossibility of double penalties; that is, up to 37,500\nper day for violating the statute, up to 37,500 per day\nfor violating the compliance order. I think that's\nreally a theoretical rather than a practical --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Why? You say \"practical.\"\nThe order itself says that. It says you don't do it,\nyou're going to get penalized up to 32.5, which is now\n37.\nMR. STEWART: Well, that language in the\norder would have been accurate even if the statute\ndidn't authorize penalties for violating the -- the\norder itself. That is, even if the statute authorized\npenalties only for violating the Act, it would have been\naccurate for EPA to say we believe this is what is\nnecessary to achieve compliance, and if you don't do it,\nyou will potentially be subject to these civil\npenalties; namely, civil penalties for violating the\nstatute.\nBut the reason I say that it's -- the double\npenalties as a theoretical possible -- let me say that\nagain. If there were no provision for penalties for\nviolating the compliance order, only penalties for\nviolating the statute, EPA could accurately have said we\nbelieve that the following steps are necessary in order\nto achieve prospective compliance with the Act, and if\nyou don't do these things, you will be subject to the\nfollowing penalties because you will then be in\nviolation of the Act and you will be subject to the\npenalties --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: But, Mr. Stewart --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I don't follow -- I\ndidn't follow that. What is your response to the\nassertion that you're subject to double penalties?\nMR. STEWART: It is --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: One, for violating\nthe Act; two, for violating the compliance order.\nMR. STEWART: The first is it is a legal\npossibility. We're not aware of any case in which a\ndistrict court has ever imposed penalties of greater\nthan the 37,000 --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but you don't\ndoubt that -- you don't doubt that they have the\nauthority to do that?\nMR. STEWART: They have the authority to do\nthat. I guess the other thing I would say is the\npossibility that penalties would be increased doesn't\ndistinguish this scheme from the sort of regime that\nJustice Kennedy referred to or the sorts of regimes that\nwe've discussed in our brief. That is, it's very common\nfor law enforcement agencies of all sorts to give\nwarnings to regulated parties: We think you're\nviolating the statute.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Has the --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, Mr. Stewart,\ngiven --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Has the --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sorry.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Justice Alito.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Has the United States\nadopted a rule or announced a policy that it will never\nseek anything more than the penalty for the underlying\nviolation? It will not seek an additional penalty for\nviolation of the compliance order?\nMR. STEWART: We have not adopted a policy\nto that effect.\nAnd I guess what I -- I do want to\nclarify --\nJUSTICE ALITO: So, it's more than\ntheoretical, then. I don't really understand what\nyou're saying. You're saying that we may ask for more,\nbut it's unlikely courts will actually provide for more.\nMR. STEWART: I guess the two -- I don't\nknow that we have ever asked for more than the 37,500\nper day. Now, I think it is often the case what -- that\nwhat district courts will do is, within the 37,500\nstatutory maximum, they will say we are imposing a\ngreater penalty for the period after the compliance\norder was issued because it shows greater culpability to\ncontinue with the violation after you've been warned.\nBut that's not a feature of the compliance\norder that distinguishes it from all manner of other\nagency warnings.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, your order could have\nread, it could have read -- \"Notice is hereby given that\nviolation of or failure to comply with the foregoing\nOrder\" -- cap \"O\" -- \"may subject Respondents to, one,\ncivil penalties\" of up to 32.5 -- now 37.5 per day.\nThat's how it reads. It could have read: Violation of\nor failure to comply with the Environmental Protection\nAct may subject Respondents to civil penalties.\nIt's quite specific that it is violation of\n-- failure to comply with the foregoing order, which\nincludes not letting -- filling in immediately and so\nforth. It says what it says. It's the violation of the\norder that -- that the additional penalties are attached\nto.\nMR. STEWART: And, again, we don't dispute\nthat violating the order could as a realistic matter\ncause the penalties to be greater within the statutory\nmaximum. But, as I was saying, in many situations,\nagencies give warnings to regulated parties: If you\nkeep doing this, you may be subject to penalties.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It could -- it could as a\ntheoretical matter double the penalties.\nMR. STEWART: That's correct.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You're just saying, as a\npractical matter, it doesn't often do that.\nMR. STEWART: As a practical matter, we are\nnot aware of any case in which the penalties imposed\nhave been greater than the per-day statutory maximum for\nthe violation.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I'm not going to bet my\nhouse on that.\nMR. STEWART: It -- in terms -- I think,\nfirst of all, we would say that until we floated the\ntheoretical possibility in our opening brief, the\nSacketts seemed to be entirely unaware of it. That is,\nall of the Sacketts' calculations as to the penalties to\nwhich they would be exposed if they continued to engage\nin their present conduct were premised on the idea that\n37,500 was the statutory maximum. But the main point I\nwant to --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Stewart, I --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: They were getting a good\nnight's sleep? But they are getting a good night's\nsleep before they read your brief?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. STEWART: I don't think -- I guess\nthat's really my point, that the one thing the Sacketts\nhave never argued is, if it were just the 37,500 per day\nfor violating the statute, we would be willing to build\nour house and take our chances, but once you double\nthat, we're not willing to take the risk any longer,\nthat the --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, and that's not\ntheir argument today, either.\nMR. STEWART: Right.\nThe one point before I move on that I do\nwant to make clear is, in a wide variety of contexts,\nagencies will issue warnings to regulated parties that\nthey are believed to be in violation of a statute. And\nit is common under schemes where the amount of the\nsanction is up to the judge's discretion that penalties\nwill -- may be greater for conduct that occurs after the\nperson has been warned --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, but those\nsituations are slightly different because the Act\ndoesn't specify any specific remedies that apply to any\nspecific property. It just says you violate the Act by\nfilling in wetlands. It doesn't say that you violate\nthe Act by not removing the fill and not planting trees\nand not doing this or doing that. What it says is you\nviolate the Act if you don't comply with the compliance\norder that tells you to do those things. So, it's a\nvery theoretically different violation that's going on.\nOne is in the affirmative act prohibited by\nthe statute; that's the violation of the statute. And\nthe other is the violation of the remedial steps that\nthe compliance order is the only thing that has set\nforth.\nMR. STEWART: I don't think that's correct,\nYour Honor. First, as to of the requirement in earlier\nversions of the compliance order that herbaceous plants\nbe planted, et cetera, those were removed from the --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But those are not in the\nstatute. They're permitted by the statute, but they're\nnot set forth as requirements under the statute.\nMR. STEWART: EPA's view of the statute is\nthat -- without regard to the issuance of a compliance\norder, once fill material is deposited in waters of the\nUnited States, EPA's view of the penalty provisions\nwould be that the violation continues for as long as the\nfill remains in the wetlands.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That has nothing to do\nwith the fact that the Act doesn't specifically tell you\nto remove it.\nMR. STEWART: The Act doesn't\nspecifically -- and the Act doesn't specifically tell\nthe person to remove it, but that's our interpretation\nof the statute. And it's either right or wrong. That\nis, if we're wrong about that, if the only days on which\npenalties can be assessed for violating the statute\nitself are days on which fill was actually discharged,\nthen the provisions of the compliance order that\ndirected the Sacketts to remove the fill and restore the\nproperty would be beyond the scope of a proper\ncompliance order under 13 --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, you\nreferred a couple of times to the EPA's view of the\nstatute. I take it that's your view as well?\nMR. STEWART: That's our view as well. I'm\njust saying that hasn't been definitively resolved by\nthis Court. But the position that we've taken, again,\nwith respect to the statute itself is that in computing\nthe daily penalties and asking how many days of\nviolation were there, the district court should take\ninto account not just the days on which fill was\nactually deposited but the days on which fill remained\nin the wetlands.\nAnd Petitioners have specifically expressed\nagreement this morning with that view of the statute. I\nthink the view of the Petitioners' amici is to the same\neffect, because in many of the amicus briefs there are\ncalculations of the very large penalties to which people\ncould be subject if they didn't adhere to compliance\norders, and they're all premised on the idea that every\nday fill remains in the wetlands --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What about those provisions\nof the original order? I must say I was not edified by\nthe fact that, when litigation was threatened or\nactually brought, the EPA modified its order: Oh, you\ndon't have to plant the trees.\nDoes it do this as a matter of practice,\nissue compliance orders that go well beyond what the --\nwhat the EPA would -- would demand?\nMR. STEWART: I don't know about well\nbeyond. I think the -- every version of the compliance\norder said to the Sacketts if you think that there are\nthings here -- in here that are wrong or compliance\nmeasures that you regard as infeasible, you're welcome\nto tell us. And I think --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that's very nice.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's very nice, when\nyou've received something called a compliance order,\nwhich says you'll -- you're subject to penalties of 32.5\nfor every day of violation.\nMR. STEWART: I think the portion of the\norder dealing with the planting of plants, which is the\nprimary one that was eliminated in the final iteration\nof the order, is really removed from what the Sacketts\nhave been complaining about. That is, the Sacketts --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But it shows the\nhigh-handedness of the agency, it seems to me, putting\nin there stuff that is simply not required by the EPA.\nMR. STEWART: Well, I think in the main what\nevery version of the compliance order required was\nappropriate if you accept the initial determination that\nthere was a violation, that these were waters of the\nUnited States.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What would you --\nwhat would you do, Mr. Stewart, if you received this\ncompliance order? You don't think your -- your property\nhas wetlands on it, and you get this compliance order\nfrom the EPA. What would you do?\nMR. STEWART: Well, as we know from\ndocuments that have -- were not in the record of the\ncase, but have been provided to --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If they weren't in\nthe record, I don't want to hear about them. You\nappreciate that rule, that we don't consider things that\naren't in the record.\nYou get a compliance order. You don't think\nyour property has wetlands. What do you do?\nMR. STEWART: I think, at that stage, your\noptions would be limited. You could apply for an after-\nthe-fact permit --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You wouldn't do\nthat, right? You know you'll never get an\nafter-the-fact permit if the EPA has sent you a\ncompliance order saying you've got wetlands.\nMR. STEWART: Or you could simply comply\nwith the compliance order at the cost of, it's been\nestimated, $27,000. Once the compliance order has been\nresolved, there would be no further impediment --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's what you\nwould do? You would say: I don't think there are\nwetlands on my property, but EPA does. So, I'm going to\ntake out all the fill; I'm going to plant herbaceous\ntrees or whatever it is; and I'll worry about whether to\n-- that way, I'll just do what the government tells me I\nshould do.\nMR. STEWART: It may be that the Sacketts at\nthat point were in an unattractive position. But I\nthink in determining whether it's an unfair position or\nhow the statutory scheme is supposed to operate, we\nought to look not just at the opportunities that were\navailable to them at that moment but the opportunities\nthat they had forgone already.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Could I ask you --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, Mr. Stewart, if you --\nif you related the facts of this case as they come to us\nto an ordinary homeowner, don't you think most ordinary\nhomeowners would say this kind of thing can't happen in\nthe United States? You don't -- you buy property to\nbuild a house. You think maybe there's a little\ndrainage problem in part of your lot. So, you start to\nbuild the house, and then you get an order from the EPA\nwhich says: You have filled in wetlands; so, you can't\nbuild your house. Remove the fill, put in all kinds of\nplants, and now you have to let us on your premises\nwhenever we want to. You have to turn over to us all\nsorts of documents, and for every day that you don't do\nall this, you're accumulating a potential fine of\n$75,000. And, by the way, there's no way you can go to\ncourt to challenge our determination that this is a\nwetlands until such time as we choose to sue you.\nMR. STEWART: Well, the first thing I would\nsay is, as a matter of standard EPA practice, the\ncompliance order would not be the first communication\nfrom the agency that would alert the landowner to the\nbelief that there was a violation. The record in this\ncase does not make clear whether that agency practice\nwas followed in this case, but EPA's typical practice is\nto alert landowners through prior communications that a\nviolation is existing --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, so what? Somebody\nfrom the EPA says we think that your backyard is a\nwetlands; so, don't build. So, what do we -- what does\nthe homeowner do, having bought that property?\nMR. STEWART: Well, once that --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, all right, I'm just\ngoing to put it aside as a nature preserve.\nMR. STEWART: At the time that that sort of\nletter is issued, there's no compliance order, and\nthere's no impediment to an after-the-fact permit. That\nis, at that point, the landowner could ask for a permit\nand --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: In other words, what\nthe landowner is supposed to do -- the agency says,\nbecause you didn't apply for a permit, you're in trouble\nbecause you didn't give us a chance to say whether we\nwere going to take away your constitutional rights or\nnot; so, we can do it.\nMR. STEWART: Well, the first two things I\nwould -- the first thing I would say is it's not simply\na hypothetical means of challenging CWA coverage to seek\na permit. That is, in both SWANCC, Solid Waste Agency\nof Northern Cook County, and Carabell, which was one of\nthe two companion cases that this Court adjudicated in\nRapanos, that was the way that the suit got into Federal\ncourt.\nThe landowners applied for permits, they\nwere denied, they sought judicial review of the permit\ndenials and argued, inter alia, that there was no need\nfor a permit because the relevant tracts were not waters\nof the United States.\nThe second thing I would say is it's often\nthe case that judicial review is contingent upon\ncomplying with some sort of deadline or some sort of\nprerequisite, and once a person has missed the deadline,\nthat person may as a practical matter be in the same\nposition as if judicial review had not been made\navailable at all.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: But I'm --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Suppose the Corps of\nEngineers agrees that it's not a wetland, and its basis\nfor refusing to issue the permit is we don't give a\npermit; you don't need a permit.\nMR. STEWART: It would issue a letter either\nto the effect that there was no wetland or that it was a\nwetland that was not covered by --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Is that binding on --\nMR. STEWART: Yes, we --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- the Environmental\nProtection Agency?\nMR. STEWART: Yes, we would --\nJUSTICE BREYER: How can they bring an\naction? I'd like some clarification here. The Corps's\nregs say the Corps will accept an after-the-fact permit.\nI mean, one after -- if they applied tomorrow, the day\nafter getting this order, you'd run up against the reg,\nwhich says we won't give you any after the fact -- we\nwon't even consider this matter, until any required\ninitial corrective measures are made.\nAnd then, just to be safe, they say that no\npermit application will be accepted unless the Corps\ndetermines that concurrent processing of an\nafter-the-fact permit application is clearly\nappropriate. \"Clearly.\"\nSo, I looked at those two things and said,\nof course, you can't apply to the Corps of Engineers;\nthey're not going to accept it unless you have a very\nunusual case. So, I expect you to tell me why I'm wrong\nabout that, if I am, or how many after-the-fact permit\napplications has the Corps of Engineers accepted. Maybe\nthere are a lot.\nMR. STEWART: It's not precluded, but I\nwould agree with you: It's very unlikely that without\ncomplying with the order --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay. All right. I agree.\nThen, if we agree, then look, for 75 years the courts\nhave interpreted statutes with an eye towards permitting\njudicial review, not the opposite.\nMR. STEWART: But --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And yet -- so, here you're\nsaying this statute that says nothing about it precludes\nreview, and then the second thing you say is that this\nisn't final. So, I read the order. It looks like about\nas final a thing as I've ever seen. So, tell me why I'm\nwrong on those two points.\nMR. STEWART: Well, we're not arguing that\nthe statute precludes all judicial review. That is, the\nquestion whether the Clean Water Act applied to this\ntract could have been teed up for a court in either of\ntwo ways.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay. If it doesn't --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Well, you are arguing --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- you're on the final\npart.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: You are arguing that the\npresumption of reviewability does not apply.\nMR. STEWART: To this particular order.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: And that seems a very\nstrange position. Why would the presumption of\nreviewability not apply?\nMR. STEWART: I think first because the\norder doesn't express the final -- the agency's final\nview both in the sense that it invites the Sacketts to\nprovide further comment --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But they asked -- they\nasked for a hearing. Didn't they ask EPA for a hearing\non whether their lands fell within the statute? They\ndid ask for a hearing, and the EPA said no.\nMR. STEWART: EPA said no to a formal\nhearing, but I think that would be characteristic agency\npractice; that is, when the agency is exercising what is\nessentially its prosecutorial function, that is, warning\nregulated parties we may do -- we may sue you if you\ndon't do the following things. It would be quite common\nfor enforcement personnel to entertain informal\novertures from the regulated party or his legal\nrepresentative, but I think it would be extraordinary,\nfor instance, for a U.S. Attorney's Office to grant a\nformal hearing to a potential criminal defendant in\norder to discuss the -- in order to resolve the question\ncriminal charges should be brought. But --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: There's -- there's one\nthing I do want you to tell us is -- EPA has three\nchoices. It can go to a compliance order; it can issue\nan administrative -- trigger an administrative penalty\nwhen -- where there would be APA review; or it can bring\nan enforcement action. How does the agency decide which\nof those three routes it's going to take in a given\ncase?\nMR. STEWART: I think the -- the agency's\nnormal practice would be to issue an administrative\ncompliance order before initiating judicial proceedings.\nThat is, the statute doesn't require it, but the EPA\nordinarily would not commence a lawsuit without first\ngiving the regulated party one final opportunity to come\ninto compliance.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But what about this\nadministrative order that -- the administrative order\ninternally within EPA subject to judicial review? When\ndoes it use that as opposed to a compliance order?\nMR. STEWART: It could use that. It would\ntypically use that for violations that it perceived to\nbe less serious. The statutory cap on penalties is much\nlower than the cap in the judicial enforcement actions.\nI think it would probably be the case that it would\nissue an administrative compliance order in those\nsituations as well.\nNow, one of the things that the\nadministrative -- the cover letter to the administrative\ncompliance order does say is, even if you comply, you\nare still not immune from the possibility of enforcement\nproceedings with respect to past violations. And I\nthink that's --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Can -- can the EPA issue a\nwarning instead of using this -- this order procedure?\nCompliance order procedure?\nMR. STEWART: Oh, absolutely. I mean, there\nis no express statutory authorization for that, but I\nthink most agencies regard it as within their ordinary\nauthority to enforce the statute to send less formal\ncommunication.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: And doesn't most of --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So, they could just -- just\ndispense with this compliance order and tell the\nSacketts, in our view, this is a warning; we believe\nyou're in violation of the Act; and you'll be subject\nto -- you are subject to penalties of 37.5 per day for\nthat violation; and to remedy the violation, in our\njudgment, you have to fill in and you have to plant, you\nknow, pine trees on the lot. It could do that?\nMR. STEWART: They could use the letter for\nthat mechanism. And --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And there would be no\nreview of that.\nMR. STEWART: We would certainly argue there\nwould be no review of that. And if the Court said that\nthere was review of the administrative compliance order\nbased on features that were distinct to the order,\nnamely, the fact that it is couched as an order, the\nfact that penalties can be imposed for violation of the\norder itself, an opinion along those lines wouldn't\nsuggest that.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Is there anything you've\ngot by -- I mean, I'm -- you've got me now into the\narea; we're applying the APA; and the question is Abbott\nLabs and is it final? Well, here there doesn't seem\nanything more for the agency to do, and here the -- the\nperson whom the order is directed against is being hurt\na lot.\nSo, the only thing I -- left in my mind here\nis the order itself does say come in and talk to us\nabout this. Which may suggest it isn't final. So, do\nyou have any information on that point? That is, have\nyou looked up or has the EPA told you that really when\nwe issue these things, in fact people come in and we\nmodify them X percent of the time?\nMR. STEWART: We don't have statistics on\nthat. Now --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Do you have any impression\nthat you could tell us?\nMR. STEWART: I -- I would have the\nimpression that it's -- in a nontrivial number of cases,\nthe landowner does approach EPA. Now, it's--\nJUSTICE BREYER: Do they --\nMR. STEWART: Well, I will -- I will say\nthat the statistics I do have are that only a very small\npercentage, you know, a rough estimate somewhere on the\norder of 3 percent of wetlands-related compliance orders\nunder the Clean Water Act ultimately culminate in\nlawsuits for enforcement.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: But, Mr. Stewart, you --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If you --\nMR. STEWART: That would -- that would\nencompass both the cases in which the landowners came in\nand talked to EPA and those in which they just complied.\nI'm sorry.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Stewart, you suggested\nthat -- that some communication occurs before this\ncompliance order. And my guess would be that most of\nthe back and forth between the agency and the person\ndoes happen before the compliance order rather than\nafter.\nAnd the notion that the person can come in\nafter the compliance order and say you were wrong --\nwell, they can, but they can do that with respect to any\nadministrative action. So, am I wrong about that? That\nreally the back and forth here takes place before the\ncompliance order issues rather than after?\nMR. STEWART: I mean, I think you're right\nas a matter of typical agency practice that there would\nbe an invitation well before the compliance order was\nissued to come in and give your side of the story. And\nyou're probably right that, if we got to the point where\na compliance order was issued, then the likelihood that\nfurther communications would sway the agency\nsubstantially might be reduced.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Stewart --\nMR. STEWART: So, I would think your point\nthere --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sorry. Finish your\nanswer, and then --\nMR. STEWART: So, yes, I would agree with\nthat.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You were cut-off. You\nwere saying if we were troubled by the additional\npenalties, and you were going to suggest something. If\nwe were troubled by that aspect of the order alone, and\nyou haven't dealt with the permit issue after the fact,\nwhat would be your approach to the case then?\nMR. STEWART: Well, I guess the two things,\none of which may be more troubling rather than less\ntroubling, is to say that if you're troubled by this,\nthen there are a lot of other things that might be\ntroubling as well because it's often the case that\nwarnings are issued to regulated parties, and it's often\nthe case that if the regulated party continues with the\nconduct after receiving the warning, the penalties may\nbe enhanced.\nJUSTICE BREYER: This is not a warning. I\nmean, really all you have to do is look at it. I was\nquite moved by the fact when I looked at it, it didn't\nsay a warning. It said this is an order. It looks\nextremely formal. I even overstated in your favor the\nquestion of negotiating because it doesn't say\nnegotiating about changing the order; it says\nnegotiating about amending the order. And -- so, this\nis not just a warning, is it?\nMR. STEWART: It is not -- it is phrased as\nan order, but the only thing that EPA is authorized to\ndo under section 1319(a)(3) is to order people to do\nwhat they were already legally complied -- required to\ndo; that is, order them to comply with their legal\nobligations.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Can't you usually obtain a\ndeclaratory judgment if prosecution is threatened and\nyou think that there is no basis for it, and you\ncan't -- you're not -- you're not compelled to just\nstand there and wait for the prosecutor to -- to drop\nthe hammer? Can't you normally bring a declaratory\njudgment action saying there's no basis for prosecution?\nMR. STEWART: There is no -- the Court has\nheld that there is no constitutional bar to that and\nthat a declaratory judgment remedy can be made available\nin that circumstance. But, again, I think it would\ncause a huge upheaval in the practices of many agencies\nto say that declaratory relief is --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, but the --\nMR. STEWART: -- typically available when\nthe agency issues an informal warning.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, in -- maybe with an\ninformal warning, but when you have something as formal\nas this which shows that the agency does intend to\nprosecute, why wouldn't you be able to bring a\ndeclaratory judgment action?\nMR. STEWART: Again, I don't think that\nthere would be any value to agencies or to regulated\nparties to encourage the agencies to hedge their bets or\nto say less than what they really mean. That is --\nJUSTICE BREYER: More of a -- that's what\nI'm trying to get you to talk about just for one minute.\nI mean, you're talking about a huge upheaval. My honest\nimpression is that it is the Government here that is\nfighting 75 years of practice --\nMR. STEWART: Well, to speak --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- because -- because the\nissue is the Abbott Labs issue of finality.\nMR. STEWART: The --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And, of course, a warning\nisn't reviewable. But this seems to meet the test where\nthat fails. Now, please correct me if I'm wrong about\nthe agency practice. I can't find support for you --\nMR. STEWART: The Court in Abbott Labs\nemphasized that that was an industry-wide regulation\nhaving the force of law and that the basis for\nchallenging it was a purely legal ground. And one of\nthe reasons that we think judicial review of the\nadministrative compliance order within this scheme would\nmake no sense, would be out of keeping with the rest of\nthe statutory regime, is that it wouldn't solve the\nproblem.\nAs the discussion in the first part of the\nargument made clear, Petitioners share our view that the\nadministrative compliance order would be subject to\nreview if it's reviewable under a deferential standard.\nAnd if the Court held that the order was not arbitrary\nand capricious, that still wouldn't eliminate the\npossibility that if we pursued an enforcement action --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But in concrete, Mr.\nStewart --\nMR. STEWART: -- the Petitioners could argue\nthat they weren't actually in violation.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- how would it work?\nYou say it's a lesser standard under the APA. But the\nquestion is, is this wetlands or is it not?\nMR. STEWART: It's more than just is it\nwetlands. It's are these wetlands that have the\nrequisite connection to traditional navigable waters?\nAnd that can turn in part on factual and scientific\njudgments, and those are --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But as far -- as far as\nthe EPA is concerned, they're finished with that\nquestion. This is not something that, well, we might\nlook at it again tomorrow based on new evidence. The\ndetermination that these are qualifying wetlands -- that\nhas been made.\nMR. STEWART: I think they have reached that\nconclusion for now. I don't think it would be accurate\nto say that we have done all the research we would want\nto do if we were going to be required to prove up our\ncase in court. And that's really the second half of\nthe -- the problem, that if Petitioners' claim were\nreviewable and a court held EPA didn't do sufficient\ninvestigation based on the record before it at the time,\nthere was no sound basis --\nJUSTICE ALITO: That makes the EPA's conduct\nhere even more outrageous: We -- we think now that this\nis wetlands that are -- that qualify; so, we're going to\nhit you with this compliance order, but, you know, when\nwe look into it more thoroughly in the future, we might\nchange our mind.\nMR. STEWART: I would assume that any\nprosecutor, any enforcement person, would want to be\nbetter prepared when a case actually went to trial than\nwhen he was communicating to the potential defendant\nthat there's a real likelihood that we would sue you.\nBut the other --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But you're required to\nmake a finding that there's a violation. You're not\nsuggesting that the government is going to act\nwilly-nilly and it's not going to act on sufficient\nevidence in -- in sending a letter that says we find you\nare violating the Act.\nMR. STEWART: Obviously, we would feel that\nwe had sufficient evidence for doing that. But the\nsecond part of the point that I was going to make is,\neven if a court found that we didn't have sufficient\nevidence before us at the time the administrative\ncompliance order was issued and that the order was\ntherefore arbitrary and capricious, that wouldn't\nprovide the Sacketts the protection that they needed,\nbecause that wouldn't foreclose EPA from --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's --\nthat's right. In other words, you hope you have --\nyou've looked at it. You hope you have a sufficient\nbasis. And because of the administrative compliance\norder, you're really never going to be put to the test\nbecause most landowners aren't going to say, I'm going\nto risk the $37,000 a day. All EPA has to do is make\nwhatever finding it wants and realize that in 99 percent\nof the cases, it's never going to be put to the test.\nMR. STEWART: I -- I guess the only point I\nwould make is, if Petitioners had wanted a judicial\nresolution of the coverage question without subjecting\nthemselves to potential penalties, they could have filed\na permit application before discharging. They could\nhave gotten review there. All we're saying is they\ncan't discharge fill, wait to see whether EPA notices,\nand then insist upon immediate judicial review if EPA\nnotices and objects.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Schiff, you have 4 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DAMIEN M. SCHIFF\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. SCHIFF: Mr. Chief Justice, unless the\nCourt has any additional questions --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I do, actually, because I\nsee their point better than I did. This, I think, is\nwhat they're worried about: They're worried that when\nyou get judicial review of this kind of order, the court\ndoesn't refer on factfinding that isn't made on a\nrecord. The substantial evidence test applies to\nfactfinding made on a record, or 556/557. And so,\nthey'll have a hard time -- or a harder time -- in each\nof these cases subjecting it to judicial factfinding.\nAnd they think that the purpose of this, the\npurpose of this procedure given to them by statute was\nto call it -- the shots in favor of them, because there\nmight be thousands of these things, and they can't\nprepare all that formal thing. Now, I -- I see that as\na -- as a -- now I understand their concern. I'm not\nsaying they're right. I understand their concern.\nSo, if you want to comment, is there some\nway to accommodate their concern that also accommodates\njudicial review? Or are we just in a kind of -- they're\nin a Hobson's choice, in a sense.\nMR. SCHIFF: Well, Justice Breyer, the\ndifficulty is essentially of EPA's own creation. I\ndon't understand why -- why EPA would want the power to\nissue compliance orders that, as the Court has\nrecognized, are -- are tremendously coercive. And not\nhave --\nJUSTICE BREYER: They want the power because\nthey have thousands of these things. They investigate\nit, and they find the facts. They think it's\nsufficient, but judicial factfinding is carried out\nbefore a judge who doesn't have their experience, et\ncetera, and, therefore, there is a risk of incorrect\ndecisionmaking, at least too -- under the statute, it\nwould be too pro-homeowner rather too pro-environment.\nThat's why it's more of a dilemma than I thought.\nMR. SCHIFF: I think, Justice Breyer, the --\nthe fear of it being too pro-homeowner is in fact\nprotected by the fact of the APA standard of review.\nWe're not talking about -- about the agency being forced\nto sort of --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but maybe the agency\nis only entitled to deference when in fact it has made a\nrecord. When it hasn't made a record, maybe there's no\nreason to give it deference.\nMR. SCHIFF: You're correct, Justice Scalia.\nIf there is no record, certainly there's by necessity no\nsubstantial evidence, and in that case, the compliance\norder would be --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, they might -- the\nmight change their -- their system here, if you -- if\nyou win this, and provide for various kinds of pre-order\nprocedure or post-order procedure where they'd be open\nto change. I see a number of possibilities. I can see\ntheir dilemma.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But they'll just issue\nwarnings, is what they'll do.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Are there cases in the\ncourts of appeals or the district courts where\nlandowners, having received these notices or compliance\norders, have said that there's a taking of the property,\ninverse condemnation?\nMR. SCHIFF: I'm not aware of that, Your\nHonor, but -- Justice Kennedy, but, as this Court I\nbelieve held in Riverside Bayview, a takings claim under\nthe Clean Water Act is not considered ripe until a\npermit application has been -- has been attempted.\nNow, if a compliance order is issued, then\nthe permit application might be off the table. And, in\nfact, one could see that a compliance order might\npotentially have a total taking effect in this case.\nBut certainly, at this point, we are willing\nto let EPA have the power. Yes, let EPA administer the\nAct and issue compliance orders, but let's also give\nlandowners a fair shake, too. Let them have their day\nin court to contest what the agency has done.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Schiff, I take it -- the\nGovernment agrees that there's not much of a chance that\nyou could get an after-the-fact permit, but its view is\nyou should have gotten a before-the-fact permit. And\nputting aside the weirdness which Justice Alito points\nout of making you go get a permit for something you\ndon't think you need a permit for -- putting that aside,\ncouldn't you have gotten the legal determination that\nyou wanted through that process?\nMR. SCHIFF: We -- Justice Kagan, we don't\ndeny that by applying for a permit and having the Corps\nmake a decision on the permit that that's one way to get\ninto court. But the difficulty for the Sacketts and\nfor, you know, the thousands of folks in this country\nwho are recipients of compliance orders is that that's\nsmall or no solace once EPA has already acted, you know,\nonce EPA has made the finding of violation and then\nthreatens these ruinous penalties on -- on landowners.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Well, I think what EPA is\nsaying is, as long as you knew that your lands were\npotentially wetlands, you could have gone in from the\nget-go and -- and sought a determination that they were\nnot wetlands through the permit process.\nMR. SCHIFF: That's correct, Justice Kagan.\nBut, frankly, the way EPA and the Corps interpret the\nscope of their jurisdiction, that would make essentially\nevery landowner in this country potentially on notice\nrequiring them to apply for a permit or some other\nmanner, and the agency will then probably have even a\nworse situation; it will be flooded by permits.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel,\ncounsel.\n"
