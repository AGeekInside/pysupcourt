GELLER\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. GELLER: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, may\nit please the Court:\n58 years ago almost to the day the United States\nand its allies defeated Nazi Germany and World War II came\nto an end in Europe. Ever since that time, the United\nStates Government has been actively engaged in a series of\ninitiatives to obtain just compensation for victims of the\nwar. These efforts continue to the present day.\nBeginning in the mid-1990s, the Federal\nGovernment has been engaged in extensive negotiations with\nother Governments concerning claims of Holocaust victims.\nThe President himself has stated repeatedly that it's in\nthe foreign policy interests of the United States to have\nthese claims resolved exclusively in an international\nforum and through nonadversarial means, rather than\nthrough costly, time-consuming and contentious litigation.\nTo achieve these goals in the context of unpaid\ninsurance claims, the President has taken three actions.\nFirst, the United States has facilitated and encouraged\nthe establishment of the International Commission on\nHolocaust Era Insurance Claims, or ICHEIC.\nSecond, the United States, with the personal\nintervention of the President himself, has negotiated\nagreements with Germany and Austria under which those\ncountries and their insurance companies agreed to provide\nhundreds of millions of dollars in compensation for unpaid\ninsurance claims and to follow procedures worked out with\nICHEIC to process insurance claims in a nonadversarial\nmanner and under relaxed standards of proof, and --\nQUESTION: Mr. Geller, I -- let me mention a\ncouple of things that I find troubling about the case, and\none is that when Congress passed a law in this area it\ndidn't include any language preempting State laws such as\nCalifornia has, and when the President put out his\nexecutive order or agreement it doesn't expressly do so,\neither. How does that affect our analysis, do you think?\nMR. GELLER: Well, the statute that Congress\npassed was the Holocaust Assets --\nQUESTION: Yes, right.\nMR. GELLER: -- Commission Act, which clearly\ngave authority to the President to take control of this\nissue, and didn't provide any role for the States\nwhatsoever.\nQUESTION: But it didn't preclude a role.\nMR. GELLER: But in the area of foreign affairs,\nunder this Court's decision in Zschernig, and in the area\nof foreign commerce under many of this Court's\ndecisions --\nQUESTION: Well, Zschernig has never been cited\nsince it was written. It's kind of a troublesome thing to\nhang your whole --\nMR. GELLER: Our whole case does not depend on\nZschernig --\nQUESTION: -- case on, and we have in the\nmeantime decided, for instance, Barclay's Bank, which has\nsome language in it that speaks against recognizing the\nkind of --\nMR. GELLER: I don't --\nQUESTION: -- authority you talk about, and we\nhave the Breard case, that criminal case, Breard versus\nGreene. Now, how do we deal with those?\nMR. GELLER: Well, to begin with I think\nBarclay's is completely distinguishable, Justice O'Connor,\non at least three grounds. First, Barclay's concerns\nsolely the Foreign Commerce Clause, and the Court said in\nBarclay's that Congress has primacy under the Foreign\nCommerce Clause, and it read the record in that case to\nconclude that Congress had acquiesced in or approved what\nCalifornia was trying to do in the area of taxation, so\nthere was no suggestion that what California was trying to\ndo in that case prevented the Federal Government from\nspeaking with one voice in the area of foreign commerce.\nThere's nothing, to begin with, comparable in this case to\nsuggest that Congress has done anything to authorize\nCalifornia to engage in regulation of foreign insurance\npolicies involving foreign companies and foreign\nbeneficiaries.\nSecondly --\nQUESTION: But the United States must have been\naware that this California legislation existed.\nMR. GELLER: I --\nQUESTION:\nthis State legislation was on the books before the\nexecutive agreement with Germany and Austria that you've\njust applauded, so when California acted there wasn't any\nsuch accord.\nMR. GELLER: Well, several things, Justice\nGinsburg, and then I want to get back to answer Justice\nO'Connor's question. First, the Holocaust Act, the\nFederal Holocaust Act was passed before the HVIRA, so it\ncould not in any way be read as acquiescing in or\napproving anything that California was doing in this area.\nSecondly, and Mr. Kneedler will, I think, speak\nto this, the executive agreement did not expressly preempt\nany claims, because these were claims largely by foreign\nnationals against foreign companies, and the President did\nnot believe it would be appropriate to extinguish all of\nthose claims, but we're not dealing in this case with\nclaims by individuals. We're dealing with actions by a\nState which interfere with what the President himself has\nsaid are his goals in an area, a very sensitive area of\nforeign affairs.\nAnd this case is not like -- this case is much\nstronger than Zschernig, because in Zschernig, the Federal\nGovernment had done nothing in the area. Nonetheless,\nthis Court said that the States cannot enter into an area\nwhere it has the potential for embarrassment, or to\ninterfere with the --\nQUESTION: Zschernig involved criticism of a\nforeign government.\nMR. GELLER: So does this statute. This statute\ncriticizes --\nQUESTION: Is that really a sound basis for a\ndecision like Zschernig, to say Oregon probate judges were\ninquiring about the policies of Eastern European\ncountries? I mean, I -- I don't regard that as a very\nstrongly reasoned opinion.\nMR. GELLER: But this case, Chief Justice, is\nmuch stronger than Zschernig because this is not a case,\nunlike Zschernig, where the President has done nothing in\nthe area. Here, the President has aggressively entered\nthe area and tried to impose a solution which he has\nconcluded is in the best interests of the foreign policy\nof the United States, so it's not a question of field\npreemption.\nZschernig could be looked at as a case of field\npreemption. What the Court essentially said, I think, in\nZschernig is that there is a field of foreign affairs\nwhere, even if the United States Government has done\nnothing, the States cannot enter. This is a case that I\nthink gets much more clearly analogous to conflict\npreemption.\nCongress, has aggressively moved to try to solve a very\nserious international problem, and --\nQUESTION: But Mr. Geller, said in that very\nagreement there is to be no preemption. The President\nsaid that when California law was already on the books.\nMR. GELLER: I don't think it specifically says\nthere's to be no preemption. We're not dealing here, to\nbegin with, Justice Ginsburg, with claims by individuals.\nWe're dealing here with State legislation, and in the\nexecutive agreement the President -- the President\npromised to use his best efforts to prevent the States\nfrom interfering with the executive agreement. He has\nconcluded on many occasions that what California has tried\nto do here is a direct interference, a direct interference\nwith the foreign policy position of the United States,\nwhich is to funnel all of these claims through an\ninternational commission.\nQUESTION: Well, if we can look just at the\nagreement, isn't this what is usually called an executory\nagreement, rather than a -- than a fully executed\nagreement? In other words, it says the United States,\nrecognizing the importance of the objectives of this\nagreement, shall in a timely manner use its best efforts\nin a manner it considers appropriate to achieve those\nobjectives.\nThat's not --\nMR. GELLER: No, I think, Justice --\nQUESTION: It sounds to me like executory,\nrather than fully --\nMR. GELLER: I think what the agree -- Just --\nMr. Kneedler is probably better equipped to address the\nmeaning of the executive agreement, but it seems to me\nwhat -- what the President has chosen to do there is to\npromise to use his best efforts to look to see whether any\nStates or localities are taking actions which interfere\nwith the promises that the President has made to foreign\ncountries and foreign insurance companies to try to\nachieve legal peace in the United States, and in those\ninstances where the States have taken action which\ninterferes directly with that -- with that promise, the\nPresident has promised to use his best efforts, such as to\nfile briefs in this Court and others, arguing that\nthese -- these State statutes are preemptive, so it's --\nthere's no -- I think in the lingo of a statute there is\nno express preemption here, but there's clearly implied\npreemption under the Supremacy Clause.\nQUESTION: Mr. Geller, I may have misheard you,\nbut didn't you describe the agreement a little more\nbroadly than its terms? The President's agreement, as I\nunderstood it, was to funnel all the claims through the --\nthe -- this -- this new body, and I don't understand that\nproducing the information that's sought in this case would\npreclude that from being done.\nMR. GELLER: Well, the -- the international\ncommission not only set up a claims resolution process, it\nalso has procedures for the disclosure of information\nwhich take into account European privacy laws, Justice\nStevens. It was a very --\nQUESTION: But that's a different argument. I\nmean, that's not based on the text of the executive\nagreement.\nMR. GELLER: Well, the executive agreement chose\nthe -- the President chose through the executive agreement\nand through his negotiations with foreign countries to use\nthe ICHEIC system, rather than any parallel system, in\npart because of the concern about violating European\nprivacy laws. The California statute would be a blatant\nviolation of European --\nQUESTION: Well, but as I understand it, the\nCalifornia -- one of the purposes of the California\nstatute is to -- to uncover claims that might not be known\nabout. It produces the information that would then allow\nthe claimant to go to the -- the --\nMR. GELLER: But the international commission\nhas a separate -- separate policy for divulging\ninformation that -- and right now the, it's in the process\nof finalizing that. Under the international commission,\nall of the insurance companies are producing their data\nbases in private --\nQUESTION: But all, Mr. Geller, would you\nclarify all, because I had the impression from the briefs\nthat there were only five companies, and that they cover\nsomething like a little over 35 percent --\nMR. GELLER: No, that's -- that's --\nQUESTION: -- of the universe of -- of claims?\nMR. GELLER: -- false, Justice Ginsburg. It's\nbased on outdated information. In light of the agreements\nthat the United States has reached with Germany and\nAustria, all the insurance companies in those countries\nhave agreed to follow the ICHEIC procedures so that with\nthe inclusion of all the German insurance companies, all\nthe Austrian insurance companies, all the Dutch insurance\ncompanies, and many of the Swiss insurance companies, I\nwould say that the ICHEIC system now covers at least\ndouble the percentage that the --\nQUESTION: It's still a wholly voluntary --\nQUESTION: How -- how specifically does the --\ndoes the California statute interfere with the operations\nof the commission?\nMR. GELLER:\ndifferent ways, Justice Kennedy. It interferes, to begin\nwith, because it presents the possibility that these\ncompanies will have to pay twice, and it was a specific\npromise on the part of the United States that they would\nnot have to pay twice.\nQUESTION: Well, that's assuming there's a suit\nbrought later, but --\nMR. GELLER: That's assuming, that's -- this is\nall a part of the California system. The only purpose --\nQUESTION: And that doesn't meet Justice\nStevens' point that this is just a disclosure --\nMR. GELLER: Well, that's -- I want to get to\nthat as the second reason, but I want to make sure the\nCourt appreciates the first reason. It was very important\nthat these companies not be made to pay twice, and the\nPresident --\nQUESTION: I -- I don't understand. Why would\nthat be? Why is there a risk?\nMR. GELLER: It would be because under the\ninternational commission these companies have already made\na substantial payment, over $100 million, to settle their\nclaims, but if the California process is allowed to\ncontinue, it's possible that people will be able to bring\nsuit in California and recover separate --\nQUESTION:\nstatute --\nMR. GELLER: It's --\nQUESTION: -- there's other legislation that is\nnot before us.\nMR. GELLER: I under --\nQUESTION: We are talking about a statute that\ndoesn't authorize anybody to bring suit. It simply\nrequires disclosure.\nMR. GELLER: But the only purpose of the\nstatute, and this is as clear as can be from the face of\nthe statute, is to provide information so that\nCalifornians can bring suit in California, but the second\nway in which the California statute, Justice Kennedy,\ninterferes with the ICHEIC process is that all of these\ncompanies agreed to the ICHEIC process on the assumption\nthat European privacy laws would be respected. That's --\nthat is one of the principal reasons why the United States\nhas negotiated this alternative system. Under the --\nQUESTION: Mr. Geller, one -- would you explain\none thing that is troubling? The privacy interest that is\nbeing asserted, one can understand an insured doesn't want\nthe insurance company to divulge the insured's records,\nbut we are dealing with a unique situation here in that\nmany of these insureds, the insureds that were concerned,\nwere killed in the Holocaust, and it seems to me to raise\na privacy interest with respect to those people and their\nbeneficiaries is -- is kind of ironic.\nMR. GELLER: But Justice Ginsburg, this is very\nimportant. Under -- we're dealing with tens of millions\nof insurance policies here. Only a small percentage of\nthose policies has to do, have to -- relate to Holocaust\nvictims. California would require, and this is a critical\npoint for the Court, California would require disclosure\nof the intimate details of all 10 million of those\npolicies, 99.9 percent of which have nothing at all to do\nwith California, and nothing to do with any victims of the\nHolocaust. Under the ICHEIC system, under the ICHEIC\nsystem, the only policies that will be publicly disclosed\non a data base are policies held by -- by possible victims\nof the Holocaust.\nQUESTION: How does one know that?\nMR. GELLER: It -- it know -- under I -- under\nthe ICHEIC system, all of the policies written during this\nera that are on electric data base are to be -- are to be\nput into a system, and independently ICHEIC has done a\ncensus of all of the possible Holocaust victims in Germany\nduring the pre-war period through various records and come\nup with several hundred thousand names which will be\nmatched against the list of policyholders, and when there\nis a match, that list will be put out on a public data\nbase. The German --\nQUESTION: There was a list --\nMR. GELLER: The German --\nQUESTION: There was a list that was due out in\nApril. Has --\nMR. GELLER: That will -- I'm told that list\nwill be out by the end of this month, and the German\ninsurance authorities have concluded that publication of\nthat list would not violate any privacy laws because it\nwould be for the benefit of the people who are trying to\nrecover on these unpaid Holocaust era insurance policies.\nCalifornia, by contrast --\nQUESTION: I take it you could make that\nargument even absent the claims commission.\nMR. GELLER: Absolutely. Absolutely. What\nCalifornia has tried to do here would violate the foreign\naffairs power as well as the Commerce Clause, even absent\nthe -- the personal intervention of the President himself\nto seek an alternative solution to this vexing\ninternational problem, that's right.\nFor California, which has absolutely no\nrelationship to any of these policies, to insist that they\nall be made public is, we think, a clear violation of the\nCommerce Clause.\nQUESTION:\nsuppose we want to link the harm that this does under the\nprivacy laws to the operation of the commission. How do\nwe do that? Just, the -- the burden and the cost to the\ncompanies that might better be expended on the claim --\nMR. GELLER: It's simply that California has no\nrelationship to any of these policies. These policies\nwere all policies written in Europe by European companies,\nand California's --\nQUESTION: But that's a separate argument from\nthe operation of the commission.\nMR. GELLER: It is a separate argument from\nthe -- I think the -- the --\nQUESTION: Tell us briefly the principle of\nFederal law that you say governs this. All of the sudden\nyou're talking about the Foreign Commerce Clause.\nMR. GELLER: Yes. We made three arguments --\nQUESTION: And I thought earlier in the argument\nyou had said, oh, that really isn't our case, we don't\nneed that, and that's what Zschernig --\nMR. GELLER: No, I -- that's not true, I was --\nI was trying to distinguish the Barclay's case -- the\nBarclay's case.\nQUESTION: All right. Well, what do you --\nMR. GELLER: In addition --\nQUESTION:\nflaw?\nMR. GELLER: There are -- there are three\narguments that we have made to attack this California\nstatute. One is, is that it is, under many decisions of\nthis Court, including the recent decision in Crosby, in\nclear conflict with United States foreign policy. The\nPresident has set out a particular policy to try to\nresolve the last remaining issue from World War II. It\ninvolves channeling all of these foreign claims into an\ninternational commission in a way that respects European\nprivacy laws. California has set up a --\nQUESTION: And what case -- what case\nestablishes that principle, clear conflict?\nMR. GELLER: I would submit, United States\nversus Pink, United States versus Belmont are two cases in\nwhich the President issued executive agreements and the\nCourt found that they preempted State law. I would --\nQUESTION: Yes, but here you -- that's the big\ndifference between those. They preempted State law.\nThere's no pretense by -- the executive says I'm going to\nuse my best efforts.\nMR. GELLER: Those case -- those executive\nagreements, I do not believe, had any express preemption\nprovisions in them. The Court simply concluded --\nQUESTION:\nundertook, which was just to use best efforts, that\ndoesn't sound like --\nMR. GELLER: Under the Supremacy --\nQUESTION: -- this Court would have much to --\nMR. GELLER: Justice Ginsburg, I think it's the\noperation of the Supremacy Clause. Here, the President\nhas set out a policy for the United States, and has issued\nan executive agreement with foreign countries to try to\nimplement that policy, and I think it is clear under the\nSupremacy Clause that the States cannot do anything that\nwould frustrate or interfere with the operation --\nQUESTION: With full knowledge, when the\nPresident did that, that there were these laws in\nCalifornia.\nMR. GELLER: And at the time that the -- that\nthese laws were in the process of being passed, the\nPresident's personal representative, Stuart Eizenstat,\nwrote a letter to the Governor of California saying,\nplease do not pass this law because it will interfere with\nwhat the United States is trying to do in the area of\nforeign policy, and I think it would be a shame if this\nlaw went into effect because of the disastrous impact it\nwould have on the ICHEIC system, which the President of\nthe United States -- which two successive Presidents of\nthe United States have concluded is in the best foreign\npolicy interests of the United States, and the best\ninterest of Holocaust victims in order to get money into\ntheir hands quickly.\nBut secondly, Justice O'Connor, in addition to\nthe foreign affairs power, we think this is a blatant\nviolation of the -- of the Foreign Commerce Clause, which\nonce again is not within the power of the States to\ninterfere with. Here we have foreign insurance policies\nthat have absolutely no nexus to the State of California.\nThey are regulated by foreign --\nQUESTION: Why do you say they have no nexus to\nCalifornia? Is it not true that there are 4- or 5,000\nresidents of California who may or may not be\nbeneficiaries of policies that they don't know about?\nMR. GELLER: Yes, but this -- first of all, this\nCourt has held that the fact that someone --\nQUESTION: Am I right on that assumption?\nMR. GELLER: You're right on that assumption,\nbut to begin with, Justice Stevens, we're talking about\n10 million policies that you're trying to regulate, and at\nthe maximum they say they may --\nQUESTION: Well, you have to go through a big\ndata base to find the 5,000.\nMR. GELLER: Well, I don't -- I don't think that\nthere, that under this Court's decisions that the fact\nthat there may be a few thousand people in the State\ngives --\nQUESTION: But if they do nothing more than\nidentify policies people don't know about, how will that\ninterfere with the basic program? Couldn't they then\nrequire those claims be prosecuted in the tribunal that\nthey're setting up?\nMR. GELLER: Because ICHEIC has set up an\nalternative disclosure system and the -- which respects\nEuropean privacy laws and secondly because the -- the\nState of California simply has no power to exert its\ninfluence, even in the form of a disclosure obligation, on\ncontracts that have no -- absolutely no nexus to the\nState.\nQUESTION: Mr. Geller, as I understand it, this\nICHEIC system is wholly voluntary. There's no law that\nenforces it. And update me on something else that you did\nearlier. You said many more insurance companies that were\nin it than 35, 40 percent. As I understand it, 80 percent\nof the claims that were made to ICHEIC were turned down\nbecause the claimants were not able to identify\nsufficiently their heirs themselves --\nMR. GELLER: I think most of the information in\nthe record, Justice Ginsburg, and the information that the\nState relies on relates to several years ago, not to the\ncurrent ICHEIC process before the German foundation and\nthe Austrian foundation and a number of the Dutch\ncompanies had decided to participate fully in that\nprocess.\nQUESTION: Is this in the record?\nMR. GELLER: These are all events that --\nthey're in the public record. They're not in the record\nof this case, Justice Souter, but there are public\ndocuments from ICHEIC and from the President describing\nall of this.\nIf the Court has no further questions, I'd like\nto reserve the balance --\nQUESTION: Very well, Mr. Geller.\nMr. Kneedler, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,\nSUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS\nMR. KNEEDLER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe California statute at issue here is not a\nstatute of general application that happens to have an\nincidental impact on foreign Nations, foreign countries,\nor foreign transactions. It is a statute that is written\nexclusively and specifically with respect to a category of\nforeign insurance transactions occurring in foreign\ncountries between foreign companies and foreign nationals\nmore than 50 years ago, and it concerns a subject matter,\nthe settlement of claims arising out of international\nconflict, that has -- has always been understood by this\nCourt to be the responsibility of the national Government,\nas reflected most recently in Dames & Moore.\nQUESTION: Mr. Kneedler, I thought that the only\nrequirement is put on a company licensed to do business in\nthe United States. The -- California isn't reaching out\nto grab a foreign insurance company that isn't doing\nbusiness in the United States. It is asking questions of\na company licensed to do business in the State of\nCalifornia.\nMR. KNEEDLER: But disclosure is a form of\nregulation. This is true, this is obvious from our\nsecurities laws, it is -- it is evident from this Court's\ndecision in the BMW case of several years back, where the\nCourt -- which had to do with disclosure, and the Court\nsaid that one State may not try to enforce its policies\nwith respect to the disclosure of information in other\nStates, and we think that --\nQUESTION: Did we do that? Does the United\nStates do that, or States under blue sky laws in the\nsecurities area? Do we require disclosures of, say,\naffiliates that are set up in --\nMR. KNEEDLER: Under blue sky laws, under the, I\nbelieve it's the Hall decision, the Court said that a\nState could require disclosures -- with respect to\nin-State transactions it could require disclosures about\nissuance of securities out of State that are related to\nin-State transactions. We have no in-State transaction\nhere.\nCalifornia has claimed two possible connections\nto the State to justify this statute. The first is that\nthe companies, the insurance companies, certain insurance\ncompanies do business in California. Those are not the\nones that issued these policies, but they do business in\nCalifornia. Under this Court's decisions, I think most\nnotably the Connecticut General case that is cited in the\npetitioner's brief, is a case where the Court said the\nfact that insurance companies do business in the State is\nnot a sufficient basis for a State in that case to tax\ntransactions, insurance policies that are entered into\noutside of that State, so it's clear that the fact that\ncertain insurance companies do business in the State does\nnot give California a right to regulate through disclosure\ntransactions and policies that happened outside the State\nand, a fortiori, that's true with respect to foreign\ntransactions.\nThe other interest that California has been --\nhas asserted, which I think Justice Stevens referred to,\nis the fact that some number, a very small percentage of\nHolocaust survivors are in California, and with respect to\nthat, this Court's decision in Shutts make, and other\ndecisions make clear that moving to the forum State an\nadjudicatory jurisdiction is not a sufficient nexus, or --\nor legislative jurisdiction is not a sufficient nexus for\na State.\nWhat we have here, again, is one State of the\nUnion trying to establish its own foreign policy, in the\nwords of the Zschernig suit --\nQUESTION: Mr. Kneedler, suppose there were no\nFederal efforts in this area, which there weren't for\nsometime, and as I said, the executive agreements we're\ntalking about post-dated this California disclosure law,\nsuppose there was nothing, would you still say that\nbecause of the potential for interference there could be\nno State disclosure legislation of this character?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Yes. This, in our view, is -- is\na violation of the Constitution. We think that the --\nthat the longstanding efforts by the National Government\nto work out cooperative agreements with Germany and -- and\nother countries in Europe arising out of the Holocaust\nunderscores vividly why this is a matter of national\nconcern, but we would be making the same argument\nirrespective of that.\nThe -- the structure of our Constitution assigns\nto the National Government the resolution of foreign\npolicy issues, and this is a -- this is a very major and\nlongstanding foreign policy issue about how foreign\ncountries should resolve claims about their own nationals.\nThese policies were issued to European nationals. It may\nbe that there are beneficiaries or policyholders in\nCalifornia now, but this is -- this is exclusively a\nmatter for the National Government --\nQUESTION: Mr. Kneedler, could I ask you to\ncomment on one aspect? As I understand it, one of the big\ninsurance companies is an Italian company here that had --\nwrote policies throughout Europe. Does this -- does the\nexecutive agreement with Germany and Austria have any\nbearing on that -- on that?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Not, not directly, but -- but we\ndo think that the executive agreement manifests the\nexecutive branch's policy with respect to the resolution\nof Holocaust era claims, and there are, I think, two\nprincipal conflicts with respect to the United States\npolicy. One is the one, and I want to underscore this,\nthe one that was mentioned with respect to the -- to the\nlists.\nICHEIC is establishing essentially a registry,\nthe very thing that California wants to do, but in a much\nnarrower sense that has been negotiated specifically to\navoid conflict between German privacy laws and -- and\nUnited States law, and what -- what -- through this\nmatching exercise and through use of various lists of --\nof Holocaust survivor organizations, Jewish organizations,\nand census lists in Germany will be putting together a\npretty comprehensive list of Holocaust survivors and\ninsurance policies issued in Germany to disclose in a way\nthat German authorities believe that list will not violate\nGerman privacy laws. The California statute, Germany\ntakes the firm position would violate German -- German\nprivacy laws.\nThe other conflict is the whole thrust of the\nUnited States policy has been voluntary and cooperative,\nnot mandatory and regulatory.\nQUESTION: That's -- that's part of the problem\nI have with the executive agreement argument. It seems\nexecutory. It seems like something further is to be done,\nthe United States will use its best efforts.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, but the best efforts was,\nit will use its best efforts with State and local\ngovernments, in other words in direct communications,\nand -- and Assistant Secretary -- Secretary Eizenstat and\nothers communicated --\nQUESTION: Well, it could sign a supplemental\nagreement saying that we now agree that these laws should\nbe superseded, just like we did in Pink.\nMR. KNEEDLER: But this -- this agreement says\nthat -- says two things, that it would be in the interest\nof the -- this is on page 155a of the -- of the petition\nappendix, that it would be in the interest of the two\ncountries for the foundation to be the exclusive remedy\nfor the forum of the resolution of claims, and on\npage 156a the agreement provides for the resolution of\nclaims through ICHEIC and supplemental procedures to be\ndeveloped through ICHEIC, which includes the development\nof this -- of this list.\nQUESTION: Mr. Kneedler, how does that relate to\nthe litigation that was ongoing in the Eastern District of\nNew York that I think involved a slave labor question?\nDid the United States take a position that that\nlitigation, which involved people who moved here, or their\nsurvivors moved here after, that that was improper\nlitigation?\nMR. KNEEDLER: No. Those -- that did not\ninvolve State regulation, that involved private lawsuits,\nand there was a settlement which the United States\nencouraged. Again, this was part of the overall approach\nof the United States Government.\nQUESTION: But you were -- one branch of this\nwas that the -- the United States people who moved here\nafter, there was no connection with them.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Right, and if -- if --\nQUESTION: Well, those plaintiffs were all\npeople who were certainly not in the United States when\nthis happened.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Right, and if -- if there are\nsufficient adjudicatory connections to the United States,\nthat would be fine.\nI wanted to mention --\nQUESTION: What were they in that case?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, if the, if the -- if the\ndefendant was doing business in the United States, if a --\nif a suitable class action --\nQUESTION: Was that so of the companies that\nwere defendants in that case?\nMR. KNEEDLER: It wasn't -- it wasn't entirely,\nbut there was a settlement there. Some of these issues\nwere not definitively resolved.\nQUESTION: My only question was, did the United\nStates take the position --\nMR. KNEEDLER: I don't --\nQUESTION: -- to stop that litigation --\nMR. KNEEDLER:\nQUESTION: -- because it was interfering with\nthe executive --\nMR. KNEEDLER: I don't -- I don't believe so\nspecifically, but that was early in the -- in the -- in\nthis settlement effort.\nI want to make two important points about the\nUnited States, the -- the Constitution's assignment of\nresponsibility. The Constitution assigns responsibility\nto the National Government for foreign relations and\nforeign commerce because any retaliation or any adverse\nimpact will be felt by the Nation as a whole, not by the\nState that -- that triggers it, and this is a point that\nthe Court has made in Japan Lines and numerous cases over\nthe years, and this case illustrates that, because what is\ngoing on here is complicating. It is an impediment with\nour relations with European countries at a very sensitive\ntime, and you have one State who -- that is not\nparticipating in all of those other efforts and doesn't\nhave to balance the -- the insult that might arise from a\nstatute like this against all of the other issues that are\non the United States' plate in dealing with foreign\nGovernments at a particular time.\nThis is the very reason, that the States don't\nhave enough information and the full responsibility and\nthe National Government has to look out for the interests\nof the Nation as a whole, why one State may not thrust\nitself into foreign policy like this. The due process and\nforeign commerce arguments are very complementary of that\nbecause they impose independent limitations on a State\nthrusting its regulatory power outside of not only its own\nborders but in this case outside the Nation's borders to,\nagain, regulate through disclosure information about\ninsurance policies in other countries. The very fact that\nGermany and California insurance regulations generally\nmaintain privacy of insurance information shows that\nquestions of privacy and disclosure are matters of\nregulation.\nQUESTION: Mr. Kneedler, would your argument be\ndifferent if California, instead of providing this\nregistry in public disclosure said, we want this\ninformation in order to decide whether we will allow these\ncompanies to do business in California?\nMR. KNEEDLER: May I -- may I answer?\nYes, that would present a different question.\nWe don't think that California could require this blanket\ndisclosure. I think under international comity analysis,\nunder this Court's decision in Aerospaciale, there may be\nsome ability for the State to request certain relevant\ninformation --\nQUESTION:\nMR. KNEEDLER: -- to investigate the\nsuitability.\nQUESTION: Mr. Kaplan, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF FRANK KAPLAN\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. KAPLAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nCalifornia's reporting statute addresses a\ndespicable practice by insurance companies. That practice\nis the deception of elderly Holocaust survivors in the\nrefusal to provide them with basic policy information.\nThat stonewalling has occurred for decades, and it\ncontinues today, and it continues in California.\nCalifornia responded to this insurance --\nQUESTION: Was the United States unaware of this\nproblem when it negotiated an executive agreement?\nMR. KAPLAN: Absolutely not, Justice Kennedy.\nThe United States was well aware of California's efforts\nin this regard. The 1998 statute that was referred to\nearlier that was passed by Congress occurred about\n4 months after there was substantial testimony at a\ncongressional hearing in which several State insurance\ncommissioners --\nQUESTION: No, my -- my question was, was\nUnited -- the United States unaware of -- of the\nwrongdoing that you're describing to us, or the -- or the\ninappropriate corporate response, and the answer is, I\nassume that they were, and they did nothing about it in\nthe executive agreement, other than to have this very\nspecific claims procedure.\nMR. KAPLAN: That -- that's correct, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: It's not as if California has\nuncovered something the United States didn't know about.\nMR. KAPLAN: That's right. There were -- there\nwere numerous hearings held by the National Association of\nInsurance Commissioners that are matters of public record\nin 1997 and 1998. There was a congressional hearing in\n1998, again in the year 2000, 2001, 2002, all of which\ndescribed in extensive detail the stonewalling that had\nbeen committed by survivor -- against survivors.\nQUESTION: I -- I don't think -- the problem, at\nleast for me, doesn't concern the desirability of the\ninsurance company practice. I'll concede, absolutely it's\ntotally undesirable.\nThe problem, I think, for your side in my mind\nis letters, for example, from the Deputy Under Secretary\nof State Eizenstat to California, the insurance\ncommissioner and the Governor, about this very statute,\nwhere he's speaking in an official capacity to say that\nthe statute has the unfortunate effect of damaging the one\neffective means now at hand to process quickly and\ncompletely unpaid insurance claims from the Holocaust\nperiod, that this law has already potentially damaged and\ncould derail the settlement, et cetera, so the record is\nfull of the Deputy Under Secretary of State who negotiated\nthe settlement, Eizenstat, Ambassadors, the President,\nlists of -- in treaties, or executive agreements anyway,\nand you the -- and you know what I'm referring to. All\nright.\nWhy doesn't all of that, taken together,\nconstitute what Justice Harlan in dissent in Zschernig\ncalled a Federal policy in the foreign affairs area, so\nthat if we take the dissent in Zschernig it would seem,\nhypothetically, for -- I'm trying to get your answer --\nthat that long list of things shows a Federal policy such\nthat Harlan and Stewart and the others, Harlan being at\nthe extreme there, would have to say that California's\nstatute is contrary to the Federal policy in this area,\nhas an impact on foreign affairs of a negative nature\nthrough the conflict with the privacy statutes of\nSwitzerland and Germany, and therefore is contrary to the\nforeign affairs power given to the executive branch by\nArticle 2 of the Constitution.\nAll right, that's a long question, but those are\nthe things that I'd like you very much to focus on from my\npoint of view.\nMR. KAPLAN: I will, Justice Breyer. Thank you.\nWe're dealing here with a State commercial\nregulation, and -- and, in fact, we're dealing with a --\nan area of State regulation that is a quasi-public\nbusiness, insurance. It's long been regulated by the\nStates. Congress delegated that authority to the States\n60 years ago, and the States have been in that business\never since. We believe that it's Congress, not the\nexecutive, that deals with matters of foreign commerce.\nQUESTION: Do you think that the -- the\nPresident cannot effectively preempt on foreign policy\ngrounds by his action an agreement? Do you take that\nposition?\nMR. KAPLAN: I -- I take the position, Your\nHonor, that in limited circumstances such as this Court\ndealt within the Pink and Belmont case, where you -- you\nhad the recognition of a foreign Government, or in the\nDames & Moore situation where you had a foreign policy\ncrisis and you --\nQUESTION: I think you could answer yes or no.\nMR. KAPLAN: I apologize, Your Honor. Would you\nrepeat the question? I apologize.\nQUESTION: Well, do you take the position that\nthere can never be a preemption on foreign policy grounds\nby action of the President alone?\nMR. KAPLAN: No. I think it's possible that the\nPresident could do that in some limited circumstances that\nI've indicated, but those circumstances do not exist here.\nYou have an expressly nonpreemptive executive agreement\nentered into after our law was passed. The -- the\nagreement was entered into after --\nQUESTION: Well, of course -- of course, if\nthere were a preemptive -- I'm trying to bring you back to\nmy question.\nMR. KAPLAN: Sure.\nQUESTION: I mean, if, in fact, we had a\npreemptive statute, or if we had a preemptive treaty, and\nI think, but I'm not sure, that an executive agreement is\na kind of treaty, we would be dealing with the Supremacy\nClause. We wouldn't be dealing with the foreign affairs\npower of the President.\nBut the argument here is not the Supremacy\nClause. Nobody claims that there is preemption. What\nthey are claiming is, is that there is interference with,\nin Harlan's words, a Federal policy in the foreign affairs\narea, so if you're taking the position it has to be\npreemptive under the Supremacy Clause, then you're saying\nthat all this material is totally irrelevant.\nNow, that's a possible position, but I want to\nknow what your view is.\nMR. KAPLAN: Our view is that where the\nexecutive simply expresses an aspiration where -- which is\nthe situation here, where he's indicated he'll use his\nbest efforts, it's no different than --\nQUESTION: Oh, no, it's -- what I've read to you\nis not an aspiration. What I read to you were statements\nby the Deputy Secretary of State --\nMR. KAPLAN: Yes.\nQUESTION: -- that said the California statute\nis totally contrary to the efforts that they were trying\nto make. I would -- of course, it's not legally saying\nCalifornia is illegal, and that's why I'm -- that's what I\nwant you to explore.\nMR. KAPLAN: The response, Justice Breyer, is\nthis. Under the Barclay's decision, Congress is the\nprimary authority when -- when dealing with --\nQUESTION: I thought Barclay's had to do with\nthe Commerce Clause.\nMR. KAPLAN: It dealt with both the Commerce\nClause and the foreign affairs power. The Zschernig case\nwas taken for review by the Court. The Court did not\ndispose of that, and we believe that the foreign affairs\nissue is subsumed within the Barclay's decision when\nyou're dealing with matters of State commercial\nregulation.\nQUESTION: The -- Barclay's dealt with the\nForeign Commerce Clause, and it made the point that the\none voice in that area was Congress, not the President.\nIt wasn't dealing -- that case did not deal with executive\nagreements, as I recall it, and I think I have a pretty\ngood memory of that case.\nMR. KAPLAN: Yes.\nQUESTION: And that being so, you see, the --\nthis is not the same for that reason, and also what we're\ntalking about here is, the Governments of Switzerland and\nthe Governments of Germany, not private people, saying\nthat if California enforces this statute, 98 percent of\nwhich has nothing to do with Holocaust victims, that is,\nthe insurance policies don't, that is, what we're worried\nabout under our privacy statutes is Gwendolyn finds out\nthat Uncle Harry in England left all the money to Cecily\ninstead of Gwendolyn and, of course, Cecily doesn't want\nthat to occur. That's her private affair. That's why\nGermany and Switzerland have laws that say these matters\nare quiet, silent, private, and those Governments are\ntelling us that your statute violates their privacy law\nbecause of its overbreadth.\nMR. KAPLAN: Foreign Governments were\nextraordinarily upset about the -- the tax that was the\nsubject of the Barclay's case. In fact, the British\nGovernment passed retaliatory legislation, and this --\nthis Court found that that was not sufficient when there\nwas no specific indication by Congress of an intent to bar\nthe State law.\nHere, you've had testimony by Deputy Secretary\nEizenstat before Congress --\nQUESTION: Yes, but -- but that's -- the\nCongress has principal concern with revenue and fiscal\npolicy. It doesn't have principal concern with foreign\npolicy. It's very different.\nQUESTION: And that was the reason that Barclay\nsaid you -- yes, you're right that the executive branch\nwas in there saying look, all these foreign countries are\nupset, and we think that they have a good case. That was\nthe executive position, and this Court said, but you're\ndealing in an area where Congress has the lead, holds the\nlead rein and not the President. That's the only point\nthat -- we -- when we were talking about the Foreign\nCommerce Clause authority, that's a different question\nthan the executive authority.\nMR. KAPLAN: I -- I believe, Justice Ginsburg,\nthe issue here is whether the President, by engaging in\nsome negotiation, or expressing an aspiration as to what\nthe President thinks the foreign policy ought to be, can\ntrump a State regulation, and I think the consequence of\nthat being so would be dramatic for matters of State\nregulation, because State regulation often has some sort\nof foreign implication to it, since we're dealing with a\nglobal economy and there are often foreign affiliates that\nare called upon to report on information, and if -- if\nthat law was overturned because a foreign Government or\nthe executive branch complained about that conduct, State\nregulatory law would effectively be thwarted.\nQUESTION: Well, we can -- we can distinguish\nthose cases. As -- as pointed out by -- by your\nadversary, the difference in this law is that it is only\ndirected at foreign Nations.\nMR. KAPLAN: No -- no, Your Honor --\nQUESTION: The -- the only -- the only\ndisclosure required is -- is by affiliates abroad, isn't\nit?\nMR. KAPLAN: Justice Scalia, that's not correct.\nThe disclosures are required by California licensees,\nincluding companies that wrote insurance who were\nCalifornia licensees.\nQUESTION: What disclosures are required by\nthose licensees?\nMR. KAPLAN: Disclosure of the name of the\npolicyholder, where the policyholder lived, and the name\nof the beneficiary --\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. KAPLAN: -- and the status of the policy as\nto whether it's paid --\nQUESTION: Of policies written by them?\nMR. KAPLAN: Yes, or their affiliates. Or their\naffiliates. You have a situation, for example, where\nGenerali has been licensed to do business in California\nsince 1935 --\nQUESTION: Policies written anywhere in the\nworld?\nMR. KAPLAN: Written in Europe.\nQUESTION: Ah. In other words, it's only\ndirected at the regulation of foreign matters.\nMR. KAPLAN: It's -- it's direct --\nQUESTION: We can -- we can easily distinguish\nthose -- those California's laws that -- that are general\nlaws which have some indirect effect upon foreign affairs.\nThis -- this thing is directed at foreign operations.\nMR. KAPLAN: It's directed at a concern that\nCalifornia has by reason of the migration of -- of a large\nnumber of Holocaust survivors to the State and, in fact,\nthe numbers that we've indicated in our submissions, Your\nHonor, are that there are at least 20,000 Jewish Holocaust\nsurvivors, and we don't know how many non-Jewish Holocaust\nsurvivors there are in the State.\nQUESTION: And to that -- and for that reason\nCalifornia candidly made specifically reference to\nNazi-controlled Germany, to present-day Germany, and to\nEurope, and to the Holocaust, none of which are of\nCalifornia's concern when it conflicts with the\nPresident's power to deal with those matters.\nMR. KAPLAN: Justice Kennedy, I -- I guess I\ndisagree. I think California has a substantial concern.\nIt has a concern about people in the State who don't have\nbasic policy information that they're seeking.\nQUESTION: Why don't they, because you see,\nas -- as it's been argued to us anyway, there are two ways\nof achieving this result. Way number 1 would have\nprivately people whom you select, or trust, to go through\nthe 10 million policies that were sold, pick out all those\nthat might have to do with Holocaust victims, and make\nthem public. I take it that's the route that Secretary\nEizenstat negotiated.\nThe other way is California's way, which is, you\nmake the whole 10 million public, so Gwendolyn and\neverybody else finds out everybody else's information,\nwhich happens to be a way that would violate the privacy\nlaws of Switzerland and Germany.\nNow, what interest does California have in doing\nit the second way, rather than the first way?\nMR. KAPLAN: California has an interest in\nobtaining information that companies doing business in the\nState have so far exhibited they're unwilling to provide.\nBy requiring the information that the law asks for, we\nwill be sure that there's no further stonewalling\noccurring in the State, and that companies that want to do\nbusiness in the State will not engage in that conduct in\nthe future. It will also assure that people --\nQUESTION: Well, it looks like the way this\nscheme is written is, the -- the companies doing business\nin California have to provide the information even if\nthey're unable to do so, even if when they go to an\naffiliated, or company related somewhere down the line,\nlet's say in Germany or Austria, and ask for the\ninformation, and German or Austrian law prohibits that\nfrom being disclosed, then the California company will\nhave its license yanked. Now, what kind of law is that?\nMR. KAPLAN: It's the same kind of law, Your\nHonor, that the Europeans practice, too. We've cited\nsomething in the record. It's the European directive that\nappears at 2 E.R. 2747 to 2748. European regulators, just\nlike State regulators, deal with situations all the time\nwhere there may be a conflict with a foreign law or the\nlaw of another State, and if States are -- are able to\neffectively regulate the business that -- that is going on\nin the State and the companies doing business here, they\nhave to have the right to be able to apply their law.\nOtherwise, there could be a law established\nin -- in the Cayman Islands that established a privacy\nright for companies doing business in the State, and a --\na company could assert that the law of a foreign country\nprecluded that company from -- from complying with a State\nregulatory law, and we don't think that's how the law\nworks.\nQUESTION: Well, are -- are you saying that\nthere is no way that the United States could act that\nwould, in fact, have that effect?\nMR. KAPLAN: I'm sorry --\nQUESTION: I mean, if -- if Congress passed a\nstatute in effect condemning what California had done, not\nrepealing McCarran-Ferguson but simply condemning it,\nor -- or authorizing the President specifically to make\nwhat the -- the agreements that the President has made on\nan executive basis now, are you saying that neither of\nthose acts in effect would preclude California from doing\nwhat it is doing under this statute?\nMR. KAPLAN: No, Justice Souter. I think you'd\nhave a serious preemption problem there under the --\nQUESTION:\nto an argument about the executive power alone, is that\ncorrect?\nMR. KAPLAN: Yes, it does. It boils down to a\nseparation of --\nQUESTION: Well, is -- is your argument -- and\nI -- I will be quiet after this question and let you say\nwhatever you wanted, but what I want you to focus on is --\nMR. KAPLAN: Yes.\nQUESTION: -- do you take the position that\nwhenever the executive, let's say, agreement by\nexecutive -- action by executive agreement is, in the\nopinion of a State regulator, inadequate to address the\nregulatory problem as the regulator sees it, that the\nregulator is free, in effect, to disregard the policy in\nthe executive agreement? Do you take that position?\nMR. KAPLAN: I do unless the executive agreement\nis preemptive and unless there's something else about the\nexecutive agreement that would give it preemptive quality.\nClearly, the executive agreement --\nQUESTION: Well, are we talking about form of\nwords? If the President and executive agreements had in\neffect said, and no State can do anything which is\ninconsistent with this policy, would your position be\ndifferent?\nMR. KAPLAN:\nbe dealing with a situation there where arguably it would\nbe a preemptive executive agreement which might carry the\nsame status as a -- a statute by Congress.\nQUESTION: Why does he have to --\nQUESTION: What if Congress had -- had ratified\nwhat the President did so that it's no longer just an act\nof the President but an act of the President approved by\nCongress? Would your position be any different?\nMR. KAPLAN: Your Honor, then you might have a\nsituation like Dames & Moore, where there was a pattern of\ncongressional acquiescence in the kind of executive\nagreements that occurred there.\nQUESTION: Well, but this isn't -- this isn't\njust acquiescence in a -- in an executive agreement. This\nis Congress saying, we approve and ratify it.\nMR. KAPLAN: Then -- then you might have the\nkind of specific disapproval of State action that this\nCourt talked about in the Barclay's case. You don't --\nQUESTION: Well, why would it be any more\nspecific than this is? If the executive agreement is not\nexpressly preemptive, and Congress passes a statute\nsaying, we agree with it; we think the executive agreement\nis right on the money, it wouldn't, in fact, be any more\nrestrictive or less restrictive than it is now.\nMR. KAPLAN:\nHonor, is then you have Congress acting, you have Congress\nspeaking, which is what this Court in Barclay's thought\nwas the appropriate actor to speak in matters of foreign\ncommerce.\nQUESTION: Congress makes laws. The President\ndoesn't make laws. I'm not sure that the President can\nmake an executive agreement preemptive which is not\npreemptive in its nature. I mean, all -- all he can say\nis, is there any -- any State action which is inconsistent\nwith our foreign policy expressed in this agreement is\ninvalid, but that's not -- not something that occurs by\nreason of his pronouncement. It occurs, if it occurs at\nall, by reason of the Constitution, automatically, so it\nreally doesn't matter whether he says that or not. His\nsaying it cannot make it happen, and his not saying it, I\nthink, cannot not make it happen.\nMR. KAPLAN: I agree.\nQUESTION: You shouldn't agree.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. KAPLAN: Then I won't.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: May I ask you whether you think\nthat --\nQUESTION: I mean, if you agree -- the problem\nis, if you agree with that, that you're then going to say\non the tough kinds of things that you raised, how do we\nknow if this is a Cayman Island situation fake, or how do\nwe know if it's a really genuine important policy of a\nforeign Government, say, the privacy policy?\nThere are one of two people who can decide that,\nthe Secretary of State or, say, the Governor or Insurance\nCommissioner of California and the problem for you, I\nthink, is that the Constitution seems to give the\nauthority to decide that to the Secretary of State and not\nthe Insurance Commissioner of California because it's a\nforeign affairs matter.\nMR. KAPLAN: I -- I think actually the -- the\nConstitution gives that authority to Congress, and if the\nexecutive branch --\nQUESTION: You mean, Congress is supposed to run\nforeign affairs on every -- all of these matters?\nMR. KAPLAN: Congress is supposed to run\nforeign -- matters of foreign commerce, including\nobjections by foreign Governments about the way States are\nbehaving. If they -- if they think they're behaving\nbadly, then the executive can go to Congress, lodge a\ncomplaint, and if Congress is so inclined, Congress can do\nsomething about it.\nClearly, here, Congress has done nothing about\nit.\nstatute. There was testimony before Congress. Congress\ndidn't say stop doing that. Congress said, we bless what\nyou've done, we think you're doing a good job, keep doing\nit.\nQUESTION: In what way did Congress say this?\nMR. KAPLAN: Congress said that in --\nQUESTION: I mean, was it a committee report, or\nan act of Congress?\nMR. KAPLAN: There were statements made by -- by\nMembers of Congress in response to testimony that was\ngiven, including the 2002 hearing --\nQUESTION: Well, you're -- you're saying that is\nthe voice of Congress?\nMR. KAPLAN: No, I'm not. I'm saying the\nMcCarran-Ferguson Act is the voice of Congress, the --\nQUESTION: Well, but you just said a moment ago\nthat Congress had -- had approved this.\nMR. KAPLAN: Yes. Congress has approved\nit either implicitly or directly through the\nMcCarran-Ferguson Act, which gives the States authority to\nact in matters of insurance. In the Holocaust Commission\nAct Congress, in effect, endorsed State action to deal\nwith Holocaust insurance matters.\nQUESTION: Is it not true that the -- what the\nCongress endorsed there was presidential leadership, not\nState action?\nMR. KAPLAN: But in -- but in that statute\nCongress recognized that States were acting in this area.\nThe statute said that the commission there should\ncoordinate its activities with the States, and it asked\nthe National Association of Insurance Commissioners to\npass -- to prepare a report, rather, on the activities of\nforeign and domestic insurance companies doing business in\nthis country, and the Ninth Circuit found, and we believe\nit was reasonable for it to find that Congress\nanticipated, understood, and -- and knew that -- that the\nStates would be acting pursuant to State law and might\nhave to seek information from entities located outside the\nborders of this country.\nQUESTION: Mr. Kaplan, there -- there was a\nreason, I think, why the Federal Constitution gave the\npower to conduct foreign affairs not to the Congress but\nto the executive, and the reason was that Congress is not\na very good instrument for that purpose, that there are\nall sorts of matters that come up where -- this being one\nof them, where it is very difficult for a Member of\nCongress to cast a vote against Holocaust victims. That's\nwhat we're talking about.\nWhy -- why should the situation exist that,\nalthough the President has the responsibility without\nCongress for conducting foreign affairs, his conduct of\nforeign affairs can be frustrated by the States unless\nCongress comes to his assistance? Why -- why should that\nfollow?\nIt would seem to me it should follow that he can\nprotect this foreign affairs field on his own, and does\nnot have to call for the assistance of Congress.\nMR. KAPLAN: We believe that that would lead\nto -- to a situation where, any time the executive decides\nthat there's a matter of -- of foreign policy concern to\nhim, legitimate State regulation would have to take a back\nseat to that, so you have, in essence, presidential\nlawmaking without any --\nQUESTION: Well --\nMR. KAPLAN: -- any sort of accountability that\nyou normally have --\nQUESTION: It just shifts -- it just shifts the\ninertia, really. Congress is the 900-pound gorilla. If\nit doesn't like what the President is doing in the field\nof foreign affairs, it can stop him as quickly as it\nlikes. All it has to do is pass a resolution cutting off\nany funds for that purpose, cutting off any funds for\nthis -- for further negotiations about this institution.\nCongress always has the trump card.\nBut why should we -- should we require Congress\nto protect the President from the States? Why shouldn't\nhe have an automatic protection from it?\nMR. KAPLAN: Because except in limited areas\nsuch as Zschernig, in Belmont, in Pink, and in Dames &\nMoore, where you have a foreign policy crisis or a\nrecognition, ordinarily I don't believe that this Court\nwants the executive to go off and announce foreign\npolicy issues that will have effect on State regulation.\nIt affects issues of federalism and separation of powers.\nHere, in fact, it was the State regulators that\nformed ICHEIC. This was a creature of the State\nregulators, and after 4 years of not having done anything,\nthe State regulators decided that enough's enough, these\npeople are not getting the information. There were 77,000\nclaims submitted. Only 700 offers were made, less than\n1 percent. These people are in a line to nowhere, because\nwithout this information they can't make a claim to\nICHEIC. They can't even call the insurance company,\nbecause they don't even know which insurance company --\nQUESTION: Mr. Kaplan, we've been told that\nthat -- that's past history --\nMR. KAPLAN: It's not.\nQUESTION: -- as a result of these recent\nefforts, that there's much more disclosure coming out of\nICHEIC.\nMR. KAPLAN: There's not, Your Honor. There --\nthere's been -- there's expected to be some disclosure\nfrom German companies. We don't know what that's going to\nbe.\nThe -- insurance was written all over Europe.\nThe German market was only a small part of this European\nmarket. Generali wrote insurance all over Eastern Europe,\nand all the countries in Eastern Europe. They have a list\nnow sitting in Trieste, Italy, with 340,000 names on it.\nThey could turn that list over tomorrow. They've refused.\nThere's no privacy issue involving Generali. There's no\nItalian law that precludes it. They've simply refused to\nturn it over.\nThese survivors do not have access to this\ninformation. They do not know whether their policies were\nwritten by Generali or some other country -- company\nbecause they simply don't have the information that\nenables them to even think about making their claim.\nThis is not a claims-paying statute. We're not\nasking these companies to pay twice. Survivors would be\ngrateful if they paid once. There's nothing whatsoever in\nthis statute that -- that deals with the legitimacy of\nthese claims, whether they're rightful or not. It simply\ngives these people information that allows them to make a\ndecision as to whether they want to pursue a claim. They\ndon't have that ability now.\nIf there are no further questions I would --\nQUESTION: Yes, I have one question, if I might.\nMR. KAPLAN: Yes, sir.\nQUESTION: I would draw a distinction in my\nquestion between Eizenstat's letter, which in effect says,\nplease don't enforce these subpoenas because that will\nlouse up our negotiations and so forth. Put that to one\nside, and -- and I ask you if you would agree or disagree\nwith the suggestion that if you do enforce the subpoenas\nyou will violate a -- a provision of one of the two\nexecutive agreements?\nMR. KAPLAN: I don't think there's any violation\nof the executive agreements. Those agreements simply\nprovide, with respect to State regulatory action, that the\nUnited States will use its best efforts. To me, that's a\nrecognition and an understanding that the Federal\nGovernment knew that insurance is a State matter, a State\nregulation. That's all that the Federal Government was\ndoing. It said, we'll try our best to get the States to\nback off, we're making no promises to you because we don't\nthink we have the authority. We believe in matters of\ninsurance it's the States that have that authority.\nQUESTION: Or it could be an acknowledgement by\nthe President that this is a matter that ultimately\ndepends upon whether his foreign affairs power is -- is --\ntrumps the State action in this field, and -- and it could\nbe a commitment by him to come to this Court to ask us to\nmake that declaration, which is not a declaration that he\ncan authoritatively make.\nMR. KAPLAN: On -- on page 17 of the Solicitor\nGeneral's brief in this matter the Solicitor General takes\nthe position that even as to the executive agreements it\nonly would have some preemptive effect, if it has any at\nall, as to the companies and the countries where the\nagreements were made, so I believe the Solicitor General\nacknowledges it wouldn't have any preemptive effect\nwhatsoever for the Italian companies, the Swiss companies,\nor companies anywhere else in Europe.\nQUESTION: What about the letter? I -- I --\nthat's why I asked the question at the beginning.\nEizenstat's letter -- it's on 99a of the appendix. I -- I\ndidn't know whether that's limited to the subpoena part or\nwhether it had to do with the disclosure, or whether it's\nreferring to the statute as a whole. When I read it,\nhonestly, I thought it was the, probably the statute as a\nwhole, but I don't know. Do you have any light to shed on\nthat?\nMR. KAPLAN: I -- I do not, Your Honor. I don't\nrecall the --\nQUESTION: You think it could be the statute as\na whole he's talking about?\nMR. KAPLAN: It could well have been.\nQUESTION: Yes, all right.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Kaplan.\nMR. KAPLAN: Thank you very much.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Mr. Geller, the\nmarshal says you have 5 seconds left, and under the\nprinciple of --\n(Laughter.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: -- de minimis non\ncurat lex the case is submitted.\n(Whereupon, at 11:08 a.m., the case in the\nabove-entitled matter was submitted.)\n"
