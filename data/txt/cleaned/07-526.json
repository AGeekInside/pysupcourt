        "content": "(1:00 p.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument\nnext in Case 07-526, Carcieri v. Kempthorne.\nMr. Olson.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. OLSON: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nCongress squarely addressed and\nunambiguously answered the first question in this case\nwhen it enacted the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934.\nIt authorized the Secretary to take land in trust for\nIndians, and it declared, as used in this Act, Indians\nwere \"members of any recognized Indian tribe now under\nFederal jurisdiction.\" The word \"now\" had the same\nmeaning in 1934 as it does every morning in this Court\nwhen the Marshal announces that \"The Court is now\nsitting.\"\nWhen Congress said \"now under Federal\njurisdiction,\" it did not mean \"then under Federal\njurisdiction,\" but that is what the Government contends.\nIn fact, the word \"then\" is the antonym for \"now.\"\n\"Now\" must be given its ordinary meaning, which the\nGovernment concedes on -- in its brief, is the date,\neffective date of the statute.\nIn this statute, the term \"now\" and synonyms\nare used repeatedly throughout the Indian Reorganization\nAct. The word \"now\" appears five times in the same\nsense throughout the Act. The word \"hereafter\" is also\nused. The word -- the term \"now\" or \"hereafter\" is used\nthree times; \"heretofore\" is used three times. I\nmention these things because the Congress that read and\nenacted the statute had a keen sense of the temporal\nnature of the terms used in the Act.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What about a poster that\nsays \"Give blood now.\"\nMR. OLSON: Pardon me, Justice Breyer? I\ndidn't hear you.\nJUSTICE BREYER: They put up a poster that\nsays \"Give blood now.\"\nMR. OLSON: Well, it is --\nJUSTICE BREYER: It doesn't mean when it was\nprinted.\nMR. OLSON: Of course, of course, Justice\nBreyer. There are many contexts in which one could\nconceivably, but the context would tell you. In fact,\nthe Government's -- one of the Government's examples is\nthe use of the word \"now\" in a will. Of course,\neveryone knows the will speaks as of the date of the\npassage of the individual. There's another reference in\nthe statute where the Government refers to that, and the\nstatute itself has a very clear, different meaning.\nMy reference to the statute and the use of\nthe word \"now\" in this statute is very, very clear. The\nlegislation -- the statute refers to legislation \"now\npending.\" That had to mean 1934. It refers to\nboundaries \"now existing or hereafter established.\" It\nrefers to positions and Indian tribes \"now or hereafter\ncreated.\" It refers to lawsuits \"now pending or\nhereafter filed.\" It refers to tribes \"now under\nFederal jurisdiction.\" All of those uses of the word\n\"now\" are consistent. If the Government was correct,\nthe word \"now\" would have no meaning in that statute.\nI think it was interesting, if one takes the\nquestion presented as articulated by the Government, it\nsays, \"Whether the Indian Reorganization Act authorizes\nthe Interior Secretary to take into trust on behalf of\nan Indian tribe that was not recognized\" -- \"a not\nrecognized Indian tribe under Federal jurisdiction on\nJune 18th, 1934,\" if you take that word \"not\" and strike\nit out of the question presented, you get the statute.\nSo, what the Government is asking for is the\nexact opposite of what the statute clearly requires.\nAnd all one has to do is look at the question presenting\n-- presented as --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What about -- what\nabout the additional definition in section 19 of\n\"tribe,\" which is not limited the way the first sentence\nis?\nMR. OLSON: But it says, Chief Justice\nRoberts, it says \"Indian tribe.\" And the word \"Indian,\"\nin that very section, at the very beginning of the\nsection, says \"the term 'Indian' as used in this Act,\"\nblah, blah, blah. So then, later in that same section,\nit refers to \"Indian tribe.\"\nIt's important to juxtapose section 5, which\nis codified as 465, and section 19, which is codified as\n479, to look at the statute. The first part of section\n5 authorizes the Secretary to take land for Indians.\nNow, the way the Government addresses that in the\nGovernment's brief, they took the word \"tribe\" at the --\ntowards the end of Section 465 and said the statute\nauthorizes taking land for tribes. It actually says\ntaking land for Indians, and then in the latter part of\nsection 5, it says \"title\" -- \"When property is taken\nfor Indians, title may be vested in an individual Indian\nor in a tribe.\" Then when you get to section 19,\nCongress very carefully said, \"As used in this Act, the\nterm 'Indian' shall mean\" what we've been talking about\nhere today, and that's an adjective that describes\n\"tribe\" later in the sentence.\nThere's two things that the Government does\nin their brief which I find very interesting. First of\nall, the Government says the use of the word \"Indian\"\ndoesn't necessarily mean Indians.\nBut Title I, section 1, of the United States\nCode, the first sentence in the United States Code,\nsays: \"The word 'singular'\" -- \"The word 'singular'\nshall include the plural, and the plural shall include\nthe word 'singular.'\"\nSo the United States is disregarding that\nmaxim. Of course, the context can always indicate\nsomething different. But the Government asks you to\nignore the singular or plural. And then the other thing\nthat the Government does is to ask you to understand\nthat the word \"Indian\" means something when it's a noun\nand something else when it's an adjective, violating\nanother primary construct -- construction, statutory\nconstruction.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Doesn't it have to be\ncorrect because in -- in section 19 it says that the\nterm \"Indian\" means, among other things, all other\npersons of one-half or more Indian blood. Now, the use\nof \"Indian\" there can't be limited. It would be\ncircular if that definition applied to the use of that\nadjective there.\nMR. OLSON: The -- the -- yes. I understand\nthat, Justice Alito, and -- and no statute, if you -- if\nyou come along 70 years later, is it not possible to\nfind something like that. But the fact is that the only\nconsistent way to look at that term throughout the\nstatute -- and I would say, first of all, it's the\nlanguage of the statute. It's the context of the words\nin the statute where the word \"Indian\" has to mean\ncertain things.\nIt has to have some limitation. Otherwise,\nthe Secretary can do anything, and -- and Congress\ncertainly didn't intend that. It's not just the text of\nthe statute. It's the purpose for the statute, which\nwas to protect and remediate Indians and Indian tribes\nthat have been harmed by the allotment policy.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: What sort of -- excuse me.\nWhat sort of tribes were not under Federal jurisdiction?\nMR. OLSON: Well, the use of the word\n\"tribe\" in that question is -- is causing me a problem\nmomentarily.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Pardon me. What -- what\n-- yes, what members of tribes were not under Federal\njurisdiction?\nMR. OLSON: Well, there were all sorts of\nIndians who were not under Federal jurisdiction. What\n-- there is a -- there is a document that the Government\nproduced in 19 -- in just this summer. There are four\ndocuments I urge the Court to look at that the\nGovernment suddenly discovered after 10 years of\nlitigation and produced in August of this summer, all of\nwhich are Interior Department documents which support\nour position in this case, Justice Kennedy.\nWhat -- the fact is that there were many\nIndians throughout the United States that were not\nrecognized -- recognized as a part of tribes. They\nweren't groups of individuals with whom the United\nStates had made treaties. The United States had various\ndifferent relationships with groups of Indians,\nincluding tribes.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Were there, then -- were\nthere persons of Indian descent who were not under\nFederal jurisdiction?\nMR. OLSON: Yes. And --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: What -- what kind of\npersons would those be, persons without a tribal\naffiliation?\nMR. OLSON: Yes. In fact, many -- many of\nthe Indians throughout the United States were not\nconnected or -- or tied up into a formal tribe. The\npurpose for the Indian Allotment Act was to take a --\nland out of reservations and out of the possession of\nIndian tribes and distribute that to -- to Indians in\nfee simple so that they could sell it to someone else.\nCongress decided, the United States decided, in the '30s\nthat that policy had been -- ill-served the Indians and\nill-served the United States. So the Indian\nReorganization Act was intended to address and remediate\nthat.\nAt the same time the United States was\nconcerned and the Congress was concerned that there had\nto be some limit. If there were Indians that had not\nbeen adversely affected by the Allotment Act, they were\nnot intended to be, generally speaking, covered by the\nIndian Reorganization Act.\nSo what I mean -- I was saying in response\nto Justice Alito's question -- it's not just the text of\nthe statute. It's the purpose for the statute, which\nwas to provide some benefits and some limitations on the\ndamage done by the allotment policy. So it was natural,\nwhen it was necessary to come up with some restriction\non who would be the potential beneficiaries of the\nstatute, to look at the tribes that were under Federal\njurisdiction in 1934 who had been harmed in some\nfashion.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: My understanding --\nmaybe I've got this wrong, but there was not then, as\nthere is now, a list of tribes that are recognized and\nunder Federal jurisdiction. So how -- how do you tell\nin 1934 who is under Federal jurisdiction?\nMR. OLSON: Well, what the Interior\nDepartment did was, in compliance with the statute --\nwas to set about and create a list. There was a list\ncreated in 1936, as I understand it, Chief Justice\nRoberts. There was subsequent legislation that has even\na List Act.\nBut the -- what --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But I guess the\npoint is that, given the weight that you are placing on\nthe word \"now,\" you would think there was some clear way\nto say who was recognized before then and who was\nrecognized after that. And I -- I just don't know what\nthe test of recognition was in 1934.\nBut if they were drawing -- if Congress were\ndrawing a sharp line, presumably, it would be based on a\nsharp distinction; and, yet, as I understand it, there\nis no real sharp distinction.\nMR. OLSON: Well, there was a relatively\nsharp distinction. That is to say, it was Indians that\nhad treaties with the United States, or tribes that had\ntreaties with the United States, or had been recognized\nin some fashion by the United States Government in terms\nof a relationship between the Government of the United\nStates and the Indian tribes.\nNow, the Federal Register and Federal\nrecords in 1934 were not what they are today, and that's\nthe reason why, when these words were used, the Interior\nDepartment set about to look through the history of the\nInterior Department and to come up with a list of tribes\nthat would have been covered, would have been embraced,\nby that term now recognized in 1934.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But we're told that that\n-- that effort was ridden -- ridden with mistakes. So\ncould you have, under your definition, a tribe that is\nrecognized relatively recently, whether it is about 16,\nbut that was, in fact, a tribe in 1934; that is, the --\nalthough it wasn't formally recognized until later, it\nwas, in fact, a tribe in 1934?\nMR. OLSON: Yes. Yes, Justice Ginsburg. In\nfact, to the extent that it's necessary to go back and\n-- and it happened on a few occasions subsequent to 1934\nthat historical records were reviewed, relationships\nbetween the tribe and the Federal Government were\nreviewed. In fact, in the Government's brief, the\nGovernment talks about three tribes for which land was\ntaken into trust that didn't fit the definition of now\nrecognized -- tribes recognized in 1934.\nWe went back and looked at two of those\nthree tribes where -- in fact did have treaties with the\nUnited States and would have been included. The other\nwould have probably been included and could be included\njust exactly the way you suggested in your question.\nThe other point that I think is very\nimportant to emphasize is that 15 times since the\nenactment of this statute Congress has acted\nspecifically to apply the Indian Reorganization Act to\nan Indian tribe that had not been covered in 1934,\nevidencing some congressional understanding that it --\nit took an act of Congress to bring a particular tribe\nunder the Act. There is these --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Of course, I suppose if the\nphrase \"now under the jurisdiction of the United States\"\ndid not have any clear meaning when the statute was\nenacted, it -- it wouldn't have any clear meaning for\nthe future, either. So you don't -- you don't solve\nthat problem by reading \"now\" to mean \"then,\" right?\nMR. OLSON: Well, what -- what -- I think I\nunderstand your question. What the Government wants to\ndo is just take the word \"now\" out of the statute\naltogether.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes. I'm saying it doesn't\nhelp if you do what the Government suggests. That\ndoesn't give any clearer content to the meaning of being\nunder Federal jurisdiction. It is still going to have\nto be worked out somehow. The question is whether you\nwork it out and apply it as of the time of the statute\nor work it out and apply it time by time.\nMR. OLSON: The only way the statute makes\nsense is to construe \"now\" to mean 19 --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No. No. No.\nThat's not true, because now you have a very clear\nsystem. You are recognized if you are on the list. If\nyou don't -- you know, maybe you shouldn't be on the\nlist; maybe you should be. But you are recognized if\nyou are on the list. That wasn't the case in 1934.\nMR. OLSON: Chief Justice Roberts, what --\nit was intended -- members of Congress had to think the\nword \"now\" meant something. In fact, there is a\ncolloquy between Senator Wheeler and Commissioner --\nBureau of Indian Affairs Commissioner Collier that is\nreferred to in the briefs where Senator Wheeler was\nsaying: Well, there are some -- some groups out in --\nin California that are no more Indian than you or I.\nWhat are we going to do about that?\nAnd Commissioner Collier, who is the author\nof the Act, says: We will stick the words \"now under\nFederal jurisdiction in there.\" And then he explains\nexactly what was meant by that: That would -- that it\nwould cover tribes that existed in -- in 19 -- that\nwould -- he says that would limit the Act to Indians now\n-- and he is speaking at the time the statute was being\ndebated -- under Federal jurisdiction.\nThose documents that the Government suddenly\ndiscovered in August of this year, which were lodged\nwith this Court in the latter part of August of this\nyear, include a 1936 -- circular letter by Commissioner\nCollier to all of the superintendents throughout the\nUnited States. This is the author of the statute\nspeaking in 1936, and he says \"all persons of Indian\ndescent who are members of any recognized tribe that was\nunder Federal jurisdiction at the date of the Act.\"\nNow your point, Chief Justice Roberts, is\nthat maybe it was unclear at the exact moment of -- of\nenactment which 198, or whatever number it might have\nbeen, tribes were under that, but that's the sort of\ninformation that can be discerned by looking at the\nhistory and the records so that a finite group could be\nidentified. It isn't perfect, as Justice Ginsburg's\nquestion suggests, but it is a verifiable method of\nlimiting what Congress obviously intended to limit --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Olson, can I ask you a\nkind of a -- maybe it's too obvious -- preliminary\nquestion? Is there a definition of the term \"Indian\ntribe\" in the statute?\nMR. OLSON: No. Not in -- it says \"Indian\ntribe\" --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Section 19 defines the\nterm \"Indian,\" but there is no definition of what an\nIndian tribe is.\nMR. OLSON: It refers, in the second-to-last\nsentence of section 19 or 479, \"The term 'tribe'\nwherever used in this Act shall be construed to refer to\nany Indian tribe.\" That's -- that --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: See that -- that word\nisn't limited by time or date, is it?\nMR. OLSON: Well, the word \"Indian\" is, if\nyou accept the word --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, but the word\n\"Indian\" -- it says the word \"Indian,\" in the last\nsentence, \"'adult Indian' wherever used in this Act\nshall be construed to refer to Indians who have attained\nthe age of 21 years.\"\nMR. OLSON: Well, that just simply, I\nsubmit, defines the word \"adult.\"\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Where -- where were you\nreading from? I --\nMR. OLSON: We were reading from section\n479, which is at page 15a of the Carcieri brief.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I'm looking at the\nGovernment brief. That's --\nMR. OLSON: Yes. Yes. Now, the Government,\nI think, has the codified version of it as well as there\nare some changes --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's what's causing me\nconfusion there. You're talking about -- I wish we\nwould just use the statutory numbers, but do what you\nlike.\nMR. OLSON: Well, I'm happy to do it either\nway. The -- the brief -- when we put it in -- in the\nappendix to our blue brief, we did that.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Thank you.\nMR. OLSON: And I think -- but nonetheless,\nJustice Scalia, for the purposes of this, it is quite\nclear that if you were a member of Congress in 1934\nreading this statute and seeing the words \"now or\nhereafter\" meaning now or sometime afterwards and seeing\nthe words \"now pending,\" \"now recognized,\" \"now\nexisting,\" and so forth, you would think that the word\n\"now\" meant 1934. In fact, when this Court in 1978 was\nconstruing the statute --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Olson, am I not\ncorrect that the membership in the tribe is just one\ncategory of persons who are included in the broader\ndefinition of the term \"Indian\"?\nMR. OLSON: There are three categories,\nJustice Stevens.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And one of the them is\nmembers of the tribe.\nMR. OLSON: Yes.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Another is one who --\nIndians who have attained the age of 21 years. The\nother other is -- let's see. \"The term 'tribe' wherever\nused in this Act shall be construed to refer to any\nIndian tribe, organized band, pueblo, or the Indians\nresiding on one reservation.\" Now, that reference to\nthe term \"tribe,\" as opposed to \"Indian,\" doesn't have\nany limit on the time.\nMR. OLSON: Well, if you take the word\n\"Indian\" out, but the word -- the phrase is \"Indian\ntribe.\" And Congress specifically said the word\n\"Indian\" wherever -- now that's where the Government\nsays the word used as a noun doesn't mean the same as\nthe word used as an adjective. That doesn't make any\nsense.\nBut Congress was clearly talking about --\nwhen it made three categories at the beginning of that\nsentence, Justice Stevens, it made three categories\nbasically to cover the tribes that were recognized and\nthen under jurisdiction in 1934, and that's -- the\nauthor of the statute said that in 1936. He said that\nin an exchange with Senator Collier. In fact, the two\nother Justice Department -- Interior Department\ndocuments that were reproduced were documents from the\nSolicitor of the Interior Department to the Indian\nAffairs person saying the same thing in 1978, the same\nthing in 1980, and the same thing in 1994. And when\nthis Court construed the statute in -- in an indirect\nway with respect to the Choctaw Tribe in 1978, in the\ncase of U.S. versus John, the Court said members of any\nrecognized bracket, in 1934, \"tribe now under Federal\njurisdiction.\"\nJUSTICE BREYER: Do you think -- do you\nthink the meaning of that -- the words specifically that\nwere added were \"now under Federal jurisdiction.\" The\nword \"recognized\" was already in the statute. So, it\nlooks like the \"now\" applies to \"under Federal\njurisdiction.\"\nNow, my law clerks, in doing research on\nthis, came up with a number of instances where the tribe\nwasn't recognized until 1976. I think that was true of\nsomething called the Stillaquamish Tribe.\nMR. OLSON: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And it's recognized in\n1976, but then they go back and they say, well, was it\nunder Federal jurisdiction in 1934? And that seems a\nrather loose term that includes the fact that you are\nunder Federal jurisdiction if, for example, the Federal\nGovernment has a treaty with you that requires the\nFederal Government to do something. Suppose that's the\nright reading of this. Then should we send this back?\nMR. OLSON: No. The meaning is quite clear.\nIn fact, Justice Breyer --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, I'm saying I'm\nagreeing with you on the meaning. The meaning is \"now,\"\nbut it's \"now under Federal jurisdiction.\" So, there\nwould be a question. This tribe wasn't --\nMR. OLSON: There's no question that this\ntribe would not qualify --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No.\nMR. OLSON: -- and there's no contention\nthat it would. No matter how you define that and the --\nthe --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: They wouldn't qualify for\ntwo reasons -- A, they weren't recognized; and B, they\nweren't, in 1934, under Federal jurisdiction? Or\neither?\nMR. OLSON: Both, Justice Kennedy. They\nweren't either.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Because I suppose that\nwhat the Government wants us to do is put in two commas:\nThe Indian as used in section -- a person of Indian\ndescent, comma, who are members of any recognized Indian\ntribes, comma, now under Federal jurisdiction. That\nstill might not help if they weren't under Federal\njurisdiction in 1934.\nMR. OLSON: That's correct. It does not\nhelp --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Even if they were\nrecognized later?\nMR. OLSON: They can be recognized later,\nJustice Kennedy. In fact, Congress specifically did\nthat 15 times between -- for the first time, it was\n1936, and the last time it was 1994.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: You don't agree that\n\"recognized later\" complies with this statute in your\ncase.\nMR. OLSON: No, because here's what Congress\nsaid: In each one of those 15 cases, Congress said --\nthe statute, including section 5 and 19, which is what\nwe are talking about here, \"shall hereafter apply,\"\n\"shall hereafter apply,\" \"shall be hereby extended,\"\n\"hereby,\" \"hereby extended.\" So, Congress, on 15\noccasions, decided that it was necessary to --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Olson, let me just\nmake sure I get this off my chest, and then I'll be\nquiet. The first sentence in section 19 defines the\nterm \"Indian.\" And that's the section you're talking\nabout?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What section are we talking\nabout -- 19? Or are we talking about some other number?\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- in this Act. The\nsecond refers to -- the second sentence refers to\nEskimos. The third sentence defines the term \"tribe,\"\nthe term \"tribe\" -- and in that definition there is no\nreference to time.\nMR. OLSON: No, but it says the word\n\"Indian.\"\nJUSTICE STEVENS: No. I'm talking about the\nthird -- the first sentence defines the term \"Indian\";\nthe third sentence defines the term \"tribe.\"\nMR. OLSON: May I read this, Justice\nStevens?\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yes.\nMR. OLSON: \"The term 'tribe' wherever used\nin this Act shall be construed to refer to any Indian\ntribe.\"\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Right.\nMR. OLSON: So, the word --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: \"Organized band, pueblo,\nor the Indians residing on one reservation.\"\nMR. OLSON: I submit that, for purposes of\nconstruction of the statute and using the word\nconsistently, the word \"Indian\" modifies tribe, the word\n\"Indian\" as defined, that's consistent with the purpose,\nthat's consistent with the legislative history. It's\nconsistent with the construction --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: The word \"Indian\" does not\nmodify the word \"tribe\" as used in the third sentence.\nThat's my point.\nMR. OLSON: Well, I think you and I must be\nreading a different thing because the sentence that --\nthe sentence that defines the word \"Indian\" says \"the\nterm 'Indian' as used\" --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I'm saying for purposes of\ngetting the meaning of the word \"tribe,\" just look at\nthe sentence defining that term, and that doesn't refer\nto any time limit.\nMR. OLSON: But it does include the word\n\"Indian,\" which does have a temporal limitation. If it\nwas \"brown cow\" and the word \"brown\" was defined, you\nwould look to the word \"brown\" to determine what a brown\n--\nJUSTICE STEVENS: It doesn't limit it to\nIndian tribe. It says, shall include \"any Indian tribe,\norganized band, pueblo, or the Indians residing on a\nreservation.\"\nMR. OLSON: Well, I think that the\nconstruction of the statute, including the way this\nCourt read it in 1978, the history, the purpose that it\nwas intended to accomplish, the use of those words\nthroughout the statute which are consistent, all\nsupports the proposition that it had meant Indian tribes\nrecognized and under Federal jurisdiction.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I assume that you think\n\"Indian\" modifies \"organized band\" and \"pueblo\" as well.\nMR. OLSON: Yes. And if I may, Mr. Chief\nJustice, reserve the remainder of my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMs. Maynard.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF DEANNE E. MAYNARD\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMS. MAYNARD: Mr. Chief Justice, and may\nit please the Court:\nThe text of the Indian Reorganization Act\nsupports the Secretary's action here for three\nindependent reasons. First, section 5 authorizes the\nSecretary to take land into trust for any Indian tribe,\nand the Narragansett tribe is a tribe as that term is\nseparately defined in the Act. Second, even if one\nlooks to the definition of \"Indian\" in section 19, the\nbest reading of \"now\" in the first definitional example\nis at the time that the Act is applied.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So -- so the statute\nreads the same whether \"now\" is in there or not? You\nread it as saying any recognized Indian tribe under\nFederal jurisdiction.\nMS. MAYNARD: Yes, Your Honor. And I think\nthat if you look at the legislative colloquy, it -- it\nonly makes sense, the addition of \"now under Federal\njurisdiction,\" if what they meant by that was to use it\nat the time the Act is invoked. Senator Wheeler's\nconcern, as Mr. Olson explained, was that there were\nIndians in California who were then --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you're saying the\nonly way that makes sense is to read it as if it weren't\nthere.\nMS. MAYNARD: Ironically, Your Honor, I\nthink the Congress added the term \"now under Federal\njurisdiction\" to the Act, yes, to make clear that it --\nit was a contemporaneous application of the term.\nSenator Wheeler was concerned about Indians who were\nalready under Federal jurisdiction, and he said sooner\nor later they must have come out from under the Act.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I'm not sure he was,\nbecause when I looked through that whole thing it seemed\nto me what they were worried about -- Senator Thomas was\nworried about remnants of tribes, and they were talking\nabout an example of the Catawba Indians in South\nCarolina, and they had a discussion about that; and then\nit seemed everybody on the committee agreed that these\nCatawba Indians should not be included if they were only\none quarter Indian. They should be included if they\nwere half Indian. And that meant that they had to fall\nwithin the other phrase, not the phrase that we are\ntalking about.\nSo then they say how do we get this result?\nI mean, because they are a tribe. Because they are\ncertainly a tribe and they are recognized, the Catawbas.\nAnd then the answer to that was -- what's his name --\nthe Collier -- Collier. Collier says: I'll tell you\nhow: We add the words \"now under Federal jurisdiction.\"\nAnd he thought what he was doing was ruling out the\nCatawbas and only allowing the half Indians to come in.\nNow, ironically, later on, in the '40s I\nthink, the government decides that the Catawba tribe is\nin fact under Federal jurisdiction in 1934 because a\ntreaty exists.\nAnyway, that's how I read it and the\nCalifornia Indians were quite secondary to what they\nwere talking about. They didn't -- they didn't know\nwhether they were under a tribe or not a tribe or\nanything.\nMS. MAYNARD: Well, the colloquy is\ncertainly not clear, Justice Breyer. I'll grant you\nthat. But I do think the best reading --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I thought it was fairly\nclear.\nMS. MAYNARD: I -- I think the best reading\nof it is that Commissioner Collier is addressing Senator\nWheeler's concern, not the earlier concern about the\nCatawbas, because he says \"Senator Wheeler\" -- \"Senator\nWheeler, will this not address your concern?\"\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes, but they -- I mean,\nSenator Wheeler was worried about the Catawbas. Then\nWheeler decides, okay, the half-Indian Catawbas fall in,\nbut the quarter-Indian Catawbas don't.\nMS. MAYNARD: My memory of it --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I'll go back to it.\nMS. MAYNARD: My memory is that it was a\ndifferent Senator who was concerned about the Catawbas.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Where -- where was this\ninteresting conversation? Was it even on the floor of\nthe Congress? It couldn't have been, because one of the\nmembers wasn't a Congressman, right?\nMS. MAYNARD: Well, I think it was at a\nhearing, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It was at a hearing, oh.\nJUSTICE BREYER: You learn a lot at\nhearings, actually.\nMS. MAYNARD: But if I could, going back to\nthe text, Justice Scalia, the text of the Act\nindependently support the Secretary's reading for three\nreasons, the third being that even if one reads \"now\" in\nthe first definitional -- in the first definition to\nmean unambiguously June 18, 1934, the definition by its\nterms is expressly inclusive, setting forth the category\nof people that the Secretary must include but not\nlimiting the Secretary to --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: He can include anybody\nelse? He can include, for example, people who are only\none quarter-Indian blood, even though, you know, they\nwent to the trouble of defining it as 50 percent Indian\nblood?\nMS. MAYNARD: I think that would be a\nmore --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Very strange statute, just\nleaving it up to him to do whatever he wants.\nMS. MAYNARD: I think the proper way of\nreading, as this Court said, definitions that start with\n\"shall include\" is that they are illustrative examples\nof a general group.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So -- so there is no\nlimitations. It includes this and it also includes\nwhatever else he wants. Is that it?\nMS. MAYNARD: No, Your Honor; I think an\nillustrative example of a general class, it would be\npersons listed like the listed person. You example of\nthe quarter blood would be more difficult, perhaps. But\nhere what the Secretary has done is include within the\nmeaning of \"Indians\" persons who are every bit as much\nan Indian as those who were members of recognized tribes\nunder Federal jurisdiction in 1934.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's -- that's a very\nstrange reading of \"shall include\" when you're dealing\nwith a word that does not itself have any solid content.\nWhen you're dealing with a word that's pretty much\nself-defining, yes, you can say \"shall include this,\"\nbecause what in addition is included is -- is pretty\nclear.\nBut these words have virtually no -- no\ncontent; and if you say \"shall include\" means, you know,\nit has this, I'm still left with well, what else does it\nhave? I can't believe that the statute was meant to be\nthat expansive, to let the Secretary buy land for\nwhomever he wanted.\nMS. MAYNARD: Well, it doesn't do that, Your\nHonor. I think both -- both the definitions of -- of\n\"tribe,\" for example as Justice Stevens points out,\n\"tribe\" is a separately defined term; and I don't think\nyou can work the statute in the plain text way that\nMr. Olson suggests. You can't take the word \"Indian\"\neverywhere it appears in the statute and plug in the\ndefinition of \"Indian.\" And that's proven by looking at\nthe definition of \"Indian\" itself, which uses the\nadjective \"Indian\" to define the term \"Indian\" four\ntimes. So you can't take --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Ms. Maynard, would you\nclarify one other thing for me? The sentence in\nquestion with the word \"now\" in it and so forth, does\nthat have the meaning that it includes descendants who\nare less than a half-blood, quarter-blood, eighth-blood\nand so forth?\nMS. MAYNARD: Yes, Your Honor. I think the\nstraightforward reading of that would be any descendant\nwho meet the terms of that provision would be included.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: So that is an expansive\ndefinition of the term \"Indian,\" right?\nMS. MAYNARD: The descendants. Yes, we\ninterpret that to be descendants who were living on the\nreservation on June 1, 1934, but they wouldn't even have\nto be members of tribes, and there would be no blood\nquantum requirement.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Oh, so you're\napplying now, when you're talking about who is of Indian\ndescent --\nMS. MAYNARD: No, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- Indian descent of\nthose in 1934, but not when it's determining -- in other\nwords, you say the Indian descent as of when?\nMS. MAYNARD: Descendants who were on June\n1st, 1934. That's not using -- that's not applying the\ndefinition of the word \"now.\" That's in fact using a\nvery different phrase, the second phrase, where Congress\nused a date when it meant a date in 1934 --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Oh, I see.\nMS. MAYNARD: -- rather than the definition\nnow. In fact, if you look at the verbs in the\ndefinitional phrase, all of them are \"are,\" \"are,\"\n\"are\": \"Are members of recognized Indian tribes,\" \"are\nhalf-bloods,\" \"are descendants,\" except when they're\ntalking about June 1st, 1934: \"Who were on June 1,\n1934, residing on a reservation.\"\nAnd I think the best reading of \"now\" in\ncontext -- and Mr. Olson has pointed you to several\nplaces in the text where they use \"now\" in very\ndifferent clauses: \"now pending,\" \"now or hereafter\" --\nand -- but in two places in the Act, and that's why I do\nthink it's important to look at the Act itself, Justice\nScalia, because this hasn't been codified into positive\nlaw. In two places in the Act, section 14 and section\n18, Congress used the phrase \"at the time of passage of\nthis Act.\"\nSo it knew how to use that phrase. It\ndidn't use that phrase in \"now.\" And in fact when those\n--\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What do you do about\nUnited States v. John? There the Court in describing an\nIndian, Indian descent, went out of their way to include\nin brackets the phrase \"any recognized in 1934 tribe now\nunder Federal jurisdiction\"?\nMS. MAYNARD: Well, that's obviously dicta\nin the context of the decision, but I think in fact the\naddition of the brackets shows that it's ambiguous. If\nit were so clear, they wouldn't have needed to add the\nphrase.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but it -- it\nmay have shown it's ambiguous, but it shows how -- shows\nhow we resolved the ambiguity.\nMS. MAYNARD: Well, the Court wasn't\nresolving the meaning of the first definition in John,\nso I don't think the Court was resolving anything. But\nI do think if it had been so clear, the Court wouldn't\nhave needed to add the phrase. The --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's pretty clear what the\nCourt thought it meant, though, isn't it? Whether it's\ndictum or not, it's pretty clear that the Court thought\nit clearly enough meant that, that they were willing to\nsay bracket -- you know.\nMS. MAYNARD: It's certainly not a holding,\nJustice Scalia --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I agree.\nMS. MAYNARD: -- that the text unambiguously\nforecloses any other reading.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I agree.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What do I do about --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It suggests that it's not\nvery ambiguous, I think.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What do I do about the fact\n-- I was looking this up -- Collier and Felix Cohn, the\nworld's authority on Indian law, both write at the time:\nthis means under Federal jurisdiction in 1934; and they\nwrite it and they rewrite it and they rewrite it. They\nsay nothing to the contrary.\nI mean, they are the ones who did it, so I\nhave to admit I'm pretty much moved by the fact that\nthey thought that's what it meant.\nMS. MAYNARD: Well, apart from the Collier\nmemo, which I would like to address, the Secretary when\nadministering this Act has uniformly, since the\nbeginning, applied the definition that applies today.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I could only find one\ninstance, which is that Biloxi tribe, where the --\nsomething, you know, the ones in Louisiana -- aside from\nthat instance, I have not found one other instance that\nis inconsistent with the words \"now under Federal\njurisdiction\" meaning Federal jurisdiction in 1934.\nMS. MAYNARD: I don't know --\nJUSTICE BREYER: If you want to list them,\nI'll look them up.\nMS. MAYNARD: I don't know that the\nSecretary has ever undertaken to make such a list.\nThere was no list at the time. And the Act was a\nforward-looking act in its view of organized tribes and\nby its nature assumed that there would be no tribes.\nBut in the 1930s and 1940s, the Solicitor's opinions\nthat we cite and discuss in our brief apply the question\nof whether a group is a tribe who can organize under\nsection 16 or can have land taken into trust for them\nunder section 5.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I believe that's organized\nor recognized, because what they did in several cases, I\nfound, like the one, the Stillaquamish or whatever, they\nsaid, yes, we recognize them now. They weren't\nrecognized in 1934, but they were under Federal\njurisdiction in 1934 because there were treaties that\napplied between the Federal Government and the Indians\nwhich gave these Indians rights then. And that -- that\nseems consistent with what -- what Collier and the\nothers say.\nMS. MAYNARD: My understanding is that the\nSecretary interprets \"recognized\" and \"under Federal\njurisdiction\" to not have much difference with respect\nto tribes. I think the \"under Federal jurisdiction,\"\nthe Court of Appeals suggested this might have more\ncontent when you're talking about individuals, and that\nmakes more sense --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: That, seems to me, not to\nhelp you, because if they are the same, then that would\napply to both.\nJustice Breyer was suggesting, as I had\nearlier, that maybe you can make a distinction between\nthose were under Federal jurisdiction then and\nrecognized tribes now.\nMS. MAYNARD: And possibly you could. I\ndon't know that that would help the Narragansett Tribe\nhere. But the Secretary has always looked at whether --\nwhether a tribe could reorganize or have land taken into\ntrust for them under section 16 and section 5, to which\nthe same definitional -- definitions apply as to whether\nor not the tribe was a tribe at the time the Secretary\nwas applying that decision.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: This is -- we are\ntalking about an extraordinary assertion of power. The\nSecretary gets to take land and give it a whole\ndifferent jurisdictional status apart from State law and\nall -- wouldn't you normally regard these types of\ndefinitions in a restrictive way to limit that power\ninstead of saying whenever he wants to recognize it,\nthen he gets the authority to say this is no longer\nunder Rhode Island jurisdiction; it's now under my\njurisdiction?\nMS. MAYNARD: Well, there is -- there is a\ncompeting presumption there that I think is -- Chief\nJustice Roberts, which is that Indian statutes are\ninterpreted to the benefit of the Indian. And this was\nsupposed to be a new deal for the Indians --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, how do we know\nwhich one of them benefits the Indian? I mean, have the\nIndians benefited from Federal jurisdiction in the last\n50 years?\nMS. MAYNARD: Well, the Indians are the ones\nwho made the request to have the land taken into trust.\nAnd I assume they know -- that they believe it's in\ntheir interest to have the land taken into trust.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What are the plans\nthe Indians have of doing with the land once it's\ndetermined to be Indian land subject to trust of the\nFederal Government?\nMS. MAYNARD: The administrative record\nreveals that HUD loaned the -- or granted the tribe\nmoney to build housing.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes, of course, the\nuse of that land would not be limited to housing, right?\nThey could engage in other activities that Indian tribes\ncan engage in, correct?\nMS. MAYNARD: According to the\nadministrative record, there are some HUD restrictions\non the land. If what you're concerned with is the\nspecter of gaming, our interpretation of the Indian\nGaming Regulatory Act is that the tribe could not\nunilaterally decide to game on this property were it\ntaken into trust.\nBut as to your point, the -- with respect to\nthe clarity of these definitions, the terms \"Indian\ntribe,\" \"organized band,\" \"Pueblo,\" they had been\ninterpreted by this Court in 1934 several times. In --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: The Chief Justice's\nquestion, and I was going to put the same question to\nMr. Olson, is whether or not there is -- is some canon\nof construction, some principle of Federalism which\nmakes us be very cautious before we take land out of the\njurisdiction of the State. It sounds to me plausible.\nIs there any authority for the proposition I just\nstated? Have we said that in cases or --\nMS. MAYNARD: Well, you've said --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Or have we said the\nopposite, that there is no --\nMS. MAYNARD: Here I think it's very clear\nthat the purpose of section 5 was to allow the Secretary\nto take land into trust for Indians. And then --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But is there any\noverriding principles about which we must be most\ncautious before we interpret the statute as depriving\nthe State of the ownership and jurisdiction of this\nland? Is there anything in the cases either way on that\npoint?\nMS. MAYNARD: I don't know -- I don't know\nstanding here and, Petitioners haven't cited anything\nfor that principle in their brief, although they suggest\n-- of that. There is a competing principle that Indian\nsovereignty is not lightly to be set aside.\nOne important point I think is that the\npurpose of this statute -- that the Secretary's\ninterpretation makes more sense. The -- the purpose of\nthis statute was a forward-looking one. It was to\nrevitalize and reorganization rights.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Of course, your\nfriend on the other side says the exact opposite. It\nwas backward-looking. They had had the allotment\npolicy, which they decided was not a good idea, and yet,\nthat had resulted in Indian land being turned over to in\nfee simple, and this is a way to compensate for the\ndiscredited allotment policy.\nSo, if you weren't recognized in 1934, you\nwere not penalized by the allotment policy, so you\ndidn't need the benefit. I think that backward-looking\nperspective seems to make perfect sense.\nMS. MAYNARD: Well, the historians brief, I\nthink, makes a good case that that's not the right view\nof history. But the text also debunks that view. The\nhalf-blood definition is in no way limited to whether or\nnot you were an Indian who was a member of a tribe who\nwas allotted.\nThe inclusion of Pueblos also makes clear\nthat that was not the purpose of the Act, because\nPueblos never had their lands allotted. This was a new\ndeal legislation for Indians to let them revitalize. It\nwas the beginning of what now has consistently been,\nwith the exception of the 1950s, the -- you know,\nCongress has set about to allow the Indians to govern\nthemselves. The acquisition of land is extremely\nimportant to the ability to do that, to revive\neconomically, to have self-governance.\nThe line that Petitioners pose would create\nan entirely arbitrary result.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: As you read the statute,\nMs. Maynard, the words \"now under Federal jurisdiction\"\ncould be deleted and the statute would mean the same\nthing that you're urging.\nSo what do the words \"now under Federal\njurisdiction\" add?\nMS. MAYNARD: Well, I think, as I was saying\nearlier, I think the colloquy was -- reveals that what\nthey were trying to do was make the statute fluid so\nthat it would apply at the time of application\ncontemporaneous move with the times. As I said earlier,\nI don't think there is much distinction between\nrecognition and under Federal jurisdiction when one is\nspeaking about tribes, but perhaps --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, there may -- there\nmay not be, but let me on that score, take you back to\nan answer that Mr. Olson gave.\nAssume for the moment, for the sake of the\nquestion, that we were to read this the way Justice\nKennedy and Justice Breyer suggested, and that is to\ndraw a distinction between the reference -- the now\nreference between recognition and jurisdiction and say\nthat the now refers to jurisdiction and it refers to the\ntime of passage. If that is the way we read it, should\nwe remand this case to the circuit? Mr. Olson said no.\nThere is no claim that, in fact, the tribe was, in fact,\nunder jurisdiction at the time of passage. What is your\nanswer?\nMS. MAYNARD: I'm not certain enough to say,\nJustice Souter. I'm not sure it was litigated on\nthat -- on that premise.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, tell us what you want\nus to do.\nMS. MAYNARD: I mean, you know, if the Court\nis going to take that view of the statute, then I\nsuppose a remand is preferable to let it be worked out.\nBut the Secretary's preface.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: In any case, you are not\nhere to represent that, in fact, we may assume that\nthere was no jurisdiction over the tribe at the time of\nthe passage?\nMS. MAYNARD: You know, I just don't know\nthat it's ever been looked into from that perspective,\nespecially if one draws the difference --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, if it hasn't -- if it\nhasn't, then you're not in the position to make the\nrepresentation that Mr. Olson -- I think Mr. Olson's\nanswer suggested would be a correct one.\nMS. MAYNARD: I believe that the Secretary's\ninterpretation from the beginning, as I suggested\nbefore, has -- has understood recognition and under\nFederal jurisdiction at least with respect to tribes to\nbe one and the same. And the -- the -- if the Court\nwere to draw a distinction and, you know -- from the\nbeginning of the 1930s and '40s the opinions show that\nwhat the Secretary looked at was at the fact at the time\nas in 1964 there were published regulations interpreting\nIndians and tribe not limited by --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I'm sorry. Are we in a\nposition to -- to draw or accept that conclusion here?\nI mean, that -- that wasn't worked out. Shouldn't we\nremand and have that specifically addressed and\nspecifically address the question of jurisdiction?\nMS. MAYNARD: Which wasn't worked out?\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, you were -- you were\nsaying that the -- that a distinction simply had not\nbeen drawn at the BIA level, I guess, between\njurisdiction and recognition. And I don't think -- I\ndon't think we are in a position to say, yes, that's so\nor, no, that isn't so. So that would seem to me to\nargue for a remand in and of itself.\nMS. MAYNARD: Well, I think there --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Would you agree?\nMS. MAYNARD: Well, if the Court limits its\nview to the one definitional example in the IRA, then\nperhaps a remand is certainly preferable to a reversal.\nBut there is no need to remand, because there are two\nseparate reasons. For the Petitioner's to prevail here,\nthe text has to unambiguously foreclose the possibility\n--\nJUSTICE BREYER: I wouldn't know that that's\nso, because the -- the question I ask myself on that is:\nWere I in Congress, is this the kind of thing I would\nhave delegated to the Secretary to decide.\nAnd it's very hard for me to think that\nCongress wanted to delegate the power to the Secretary\nto decide whether \"now\" happens to mean 1934 or \"now\"\nmeans any time in the future. Well, I mean that's\nsomething Congress would decide: They meant by \"now\"\n1934, or they meant by \"now\" any old time it's applied.\nNow -- now, you could argue that both ways,\nbut why would you want to delegate? What human being\nwould want to say: The meaning of the word \"now\" is\nsomething I'm leaving to the Secretary?\nMS. MAYNARD: Even if you think, Justice\nBreyer, that \"now\" unambiguously means June 18, 1934,\nthere are two other --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I'm not -- I'm not saying\nit unambiguously means it. That's not what I'm saying.\nI'm saying it's totally ambiguous, but what the\nSecretary has to say about it is enlightening only\ninsofar as the Secretary knows more about it than I.\nThat's fine. But not insofar as it delegates power to\nthe Secretary to make up his own mind.\nMS. MAYNARD: Well, I think that one -- if\none can't tell from the text in Chevron and other\nprinciples, that you allow the Secretary, in light of\nhis understanding of the purposes of the statute, the\nplight of the Indians, contemporaneous things, to decide\nwhat the statute means. But there are two other\nprovisions in the statute that, apart from that, the\nother side, for them to prevail, the statute has to\nunambiguously foreclose the taking of land in trust for\ntribes, setting apart the example of \"Indian.\" And the\ndefinition of \"tribe\" is, as Justice Stevens pointed\nout, it's separately defined. That --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Can I ask you a question?\nIt seems to me that the limited definition of \"the\ntribe\" really is quite irrelevant to this -- to this\ncase. The term \"Indian\" is defined to include two\nclasses of persons: One who are members of a certain\ncategory of tribes and others who have more than half\nIndian blood. It seems to me that -- and then you get\nto the definition of \"tribe\" that comes later.\nIt seems to me that when you're talking\nabout the definition of \"tribe,\" the statute would have\nexactly the same meaning if, instead of it limiting by\ntime from 1934, it said tribes located west of the\nMississippi. If they just limited it to that, that\nwouldn't have limited the definition of \"Indian.\" I\nmean the definition of \"tribe.\"\nIt would have made the category of -- of\npersons of Indian dissent or eligible to be treated as\nIndians and whose eligibility is determined by tribal\nmembership, limited but the -- not to include all\ntribes. So you can limit it, as I say, to tribes west\nof the Mississippi.\nBut then when you get down to defining the\nterm \"tribe,\" there is no such definition. So that I\njust think the fight about what \"now\" means is totally\nirrelevant to the meaning of the definition of \"tribe.\"\nMS. MAYNARD: I agree. I agree\nwholeheartedly, and I think there might have been\nreasons that the Court of Appeals concluded they might\nhave wanted to limit the definition of any of the\nbenefits the Act allows individuals, but not limit the\nAct's coverage of tribes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I'm interested -- I'm\ninterested in the Secretary's conclusion that recognized\n\"tribe\" and \"tribe now under Federal jurisdiction\" are\none and the same; that the words are used redundantly.\nDoes he know the rule that we usually don't\n-- I guess he doesn't because he interprets \"now\" to\nmean nothing. Does he understand that we usually do not\ninterpret words to have no meaning? Why would they say\nboth if they both mean the same thing?\nMS. MAYNARD: Well, I think maybe I didn't\n--\nJUSTICE SCALIA: \"Recognized tribe under\nFederal jurisdiction,\" that, to me, means two different\nrequirements.\nMS. MAYNARD: I think it can capture tribes\nthat were previously recognized but that either disband\nor become -- become not -- not vibrant. But in terms of\ncurrently recognized tribes, tribes that the Secretary\ntoday recognizes as tribes that have always been tribes\n-- and that's all we are talking about here: Tribes\nthat were tribes before European contact, have had a\ncohesive political entity since that time. And that's\nwhat the Narragansetts are.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I have difficulty with the\n\"tribe\" thing. I think it's a very difficult case. I\nhave a hard time. But the difficulty with the word\n\"tribe\" is that either that tribe has some people in it\nwho are Indians, or it doesn't, right? That has to be\ntrue.\nNow, if it has some people in it who are\nIndians, i.e., a person who falls within the definition\nof \"Indian,\" then, of course, the Secretary can take\nland for that because the whole thing is for the purpose\nof giving land to Indians. But let's imagine a\ntribe that has no Indians in it within the definition of\nthe Act. You are saying that this Act would give to the\nSecretary the power to take land for an entity that has\nno members within the Act. Now, that is pretty hard for\nme to accept.\nMS. MAYNARD: Two points, Justice Breyer.\nThere is nothing in the definitional section that\nrequires the drafting of \"Indian\" on to the definition\nof \"tribe.\"\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, there is one thing.\nIt says it's for the purpose. We -- we give the\nSecretary the power to take land for a tribe for the\npurpose of giving land to Indians.\nMS. MAYNARD: But in --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And now we have assumed a\ntribe that has no such members because \"Indian\" has a\nspecial definition.\nMS. MAYNARD: But later on in Section 5 it\nsays we can take land in trust on behalf of an Indian\ntribe or an individual Indian for whom the land is\nrequired.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't -- I don't\nunderstand how you say that -- that the term \"tribe\" has\nno limitation to Indians. \"The term 'tribe,' whenever\nused in this Act, shall be construed to refer to any\nIndian tribe, organized band or Pueblo, or the Indians\nresiding on one reservation.\"\nMS. MAYNARD: Well, we have to graft on to\nthe last clause where -- Indians residing on a\nreservation. But it can't graft on to \"Indian tribe,\"\nJustice Scalia, because \"Indian tribe\" is used to define\n\"Indian,\" as well. And the whole thing is circular, and\nit --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it's -- I mean\ncircular definitions are nothing unusual in the\nlegislation that Congress comes up with.\nMS. MAYNARD: But it -- that may be so but\nit doesn't unambiguously foreclose the Secretary's\ninterpretation here. And that must mean they must show\nthat it unambiguously forecloses --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What meaning -- what\nmeaning do you think the sentence has when it says:\n\"The term 'tribe' shall be construed to refer to any\nIndian tribe, organized band, Pueblo, or the Indians\nresiding on one reservation\"?\nMS. MAYNARD: This Court had interpreted --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: How can you interpret that\nnot to be limited to Indian tribes?\nMS. MAYNARD: In Montoya this Court had\ninterpreted in an earlier statute the term \"Indian\ntribe\" and \"organized band\" to mean a distinctly Indian\ncommunity that shared political, ethnic, and cultural\nattributes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: An Indian -- an\nIndian community. Now, if we are looking for a\ndefinition of \"Indian,\" we go back to the first\nsentence.\nMS. MAYNARD: But the definition of \"Indian\"\nuses the adjective \"Indian\" to define it four times,\nMr. Chief Justice. That can't be clear. You can't take\ntheir -- their plain-text argument where you just take\nthe word anywhere.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, if it does it\nfour times, you ought to give effect to it at least\nonce. It says \"Indian tribes now under Federal\njurisdiction.\" It seems to me that that is the key\nrestriction, and that it's not taken away by that last\nsentence, which again reiterates that it's \"Indian\ntribe.\" And then in the last clause to which you refer,\nit's still \"Indians residing on one reservation.\"\nMS. MAYNARD: Well, the --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's a defined term.\nMS. MAYNARD: Yes, and I grant you that it\nmay graft on to the last clause. But it doesn't graft\non to \"Indian tribe, organized band, or Pueblos.\"\nJUSTICE STEVENS: It just describes the\nsubcategory of Indian tribes who -- for whom members can\nqualify even though they don't have half blood. That's\nthe point. It picks up people who are less than half\nblood if they are members of of those tribes.\nMS. MAYNARD: Well -- but if you look\nbroadly at the Act, Justice Stevens, there are\nprovisions that are meant to address tribe issues and\ntribal issues. And -- and I think that the purpose of\nthe Act -- it makes more sense to read \"tribe\" as -- as\nnot limited by the date and the provisions that apply to\n\"tribe,\" which is how the Secretary has always read it.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Then Collier, himself,\nwould have been wrong. Because Collier in this great\nfamous colloquy says, when he adds these four words, he\nsays to the Committee: That would limit the Act to the\nIndians -- the Act would be limited to the Indians now\nunder Federal jurisdiction except that other Indians of\nmore than one-half Indian blood would get help.\nSo what he is thinking in his mind is if you\nhave any kind of entity or a person who is more than\none-half Indian blood, fine. The Secretary can act.\nBut suppose we have an entity that has only people who\nhave less than one-half Indian blood. Then they are out\nof luck unless they are now under Federal jurisdiction.\nMS. MAYNARD: As we -- I discussed earlier,\nI don't agree with your reading of the colloquy. I do\nthink it's ambiguous. I think, at a minimum, the\nstatute doesn't foreclose the secretary's interpretation\nof the provisions. And \"Indian\" used in Section 1\nclearly is not the \"Indian\" defined in Section 19.\nBecause in Section 1 they talk about Indians who have\nentered into treaties. And that would have included\nboth Indians who were and were not under section --\nunder -- would meet the definition of \"Indian\" in\nSection 19; nor would plugging that definition into\nSection 1 make very much sense.\nThe -- if I could, just before time runs out\n-- if the Court gets to the second question, as we think\nyou should, the -- the Settlement Act clearly does not\nrepeal the Secretary's authority to take land into\ntrust.\nAnd if the Court has any questions about\nthat, it addresses jurisdiction in Rhode Island\nexpressly and limits Rhode Island's jurisdiction to the\nsettlement land. It contemplates that the Secretary may\nsome day take land into trust on behalf of the tribe.\nOther acts, similar acts, do expressly address that\nquestion. Unlike the Rhode Island Act, they have\nsimilar extinguishment premises, and, yet, they -- they\nwent on. I just -- the Rhode Island extinguishment\nprovisions just don't have the meaning that -- that\nPetitioners say.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Of course if we just\n-- I'm sorry to jump back to the other provision, but if\nwe disagree with your interpretation and Congress thinks\nwe are wrong they can pass another one of these 15, 16\nprovisions that they have that says this tribe is -- is\nrecognized now.\nMS. MAYNARD: They could. If I could make\none point in response to that? Congress has already\nacted on the presumption that the Secretary's reading is\ncorrect. In ILCA section 2019 there is an exception --\nit's in the back of our brief on page 30 -- IGRA; sorry,\nIGRA -- page 35a that lands taken into trust as part of\nan initial reservation of any tribe acknowledged by the\nSecretary under the Federal acknowledgment process.\nIn other words, Congress understands the\nSecretary to have the authority to take land in a trust\nfor tribes that have been duly recognized under the\nSecretary's acknowledgment process.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well -- I'm sorry to\nkeep you there longer than you may want to be.\n(Laughter.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why -- why else --\nwhy would Congress then enact these 15 or 16 separate\nprovisions if they think the -- if in this provision\nthey think it's not necessary?\nMS. MAYNARD: In the ones of which I'm aware\nI think just to make it clear beyond doubt that Section\n465 applies to bribes. Often the ones that I know of\njust have a list of statutes and say these are -- now\napply to the -- to the tribe. In -- in other acts\nCongress has acted; in fact it's amended section 16 of\nthe IRA in 1994. And there has been decades -- since\n1964 the Secretary has interpreted section 16 to apply\nto any recognized Indian tribe; and Congress amended it\nto add authority -- (f) and (g) -- instruct the\nSecretary to treat all recognized tribes the same.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel.\nMr. Olson, you have four minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. OLSON: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nLet me start with Justice Kennedy's\nquestion, and I think one other justice asked about\nother canon of construction, specifically with respect\nto sovereignty of States. This Court said in Vermont\nAgency in 2000 if Congress is to alter the\nconstitutional balance between States and the Federal\ngovernment, it must make its intention to do so\nunmistakably clear; and Justice Kennedy, I think you\nasked that question in the context of the relationship\nbetween States and Indian tribes, and I would refer the\nCourt to Seminole Tribe, in which the Court said the\nCongress must unequivocally express its intent to\nabrogate States' immunity.\nAs the Chief Justice was pointing out, this\nis a very broad grant of authority, if it is what the\ngovernment says it is. The Secretary can take property\nfrom the State, particularly a small State like Rhode\nIsland, but it would be the same anywhere, and strip the\nState of jurisdiction and give jurisdiction to a dual\nsovereign operating within that State. We submit that\nthe legislative history, the legislative language, the\nlegislative purpose, the contemporary construction of\nthe statute by the author of this statute, and\neverything stands for the proposition that there was\nsome limitation intended here. I think the Government\noverlooks the fact and it somewhat misstates it by\nsaying land may be taken for tribes. I've heard that\nseveral times not just in the brief but during oral\nargument.\nSection 5 which is the grant of authority\nsays the Secretary is authorized to take land for the\npurposes of providing land for Indians and then section\n19 defines the term Indians.\nNow it may -- once it decides that it may\ntake title it may take land for Indians, it can then\nvest the title in -- as it says at the end of section\n5 -- in individual Indians, individual Indians or\ntribes. But it takes lands for Indians; they have to be\nIndians or land cannot be taken.\nThe other canons of construction, besides\nthe ones that must recognize State sovereignty, is that\nwords must be given their ordinary meaning absent a\ncontrary context. Words are not to be considered to be\nsuperfluous. There are several instances of efforts to\nrepeal by implication in the Government's brief; and I\ncould go on and on. There are several violations of\nvarious canons of construction.\nThe colloquy is clear when it's put in\ncontext. It's exactly what I think you were getting at,\nJustice Breyer. There is a difference between you know,\nIndians under jurisdiction, which is what\nMr. Commissioner Collier meant, and Indians that may\nhave had some connection with the Federal Government.\nThat whole colloquy is explained quite clearly in the --\nin the document the Government discovered in August; and\nit's dated 1980; it's a memorandum by the assistant\nsolicitor, and I explains -- it explains the context.\nSection -- the tribe was not -- this\nparticular tribe I submit -- and we would describe this,\nthis question came up in a couple of the questions, was\nthis tribe under Federal jurisdiction and should the\ncase be remanded. I know of nothing that suggests that\nit was under Federal jurisdiction. I invite the Court\nto look at page 7 of our brief. The tribe was under\nState jurisdiction, under State control and there is a\nreference to that in an explanation in the joint\nappendix at pages 21a and 23a. I don't have time to\nelaborate on that, but that is answered there.\nU.S. versus --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: How did it get to be\nrecognized? I thought the recognition reflects that\nit's had a history going way, way back?\nMR. OLSON: It had -- the -- the group of\nIndians called the Narragansetts, yes, have history that\ndoes go way back; but the are relationship with the\nFederal Government was what was being considered where\n-- the Indian Reorganization Act is -- and that\nrelationship did not exist at that time. U.S. v John,\nthe bracketed phrase doesn't mean that that phrase was\nunambiguous. The Court clearly understood that it meant\n1934, the same as Commissioner Collier meant, and the\nsame as the statute indicated. It doesn't show that it\nwas ambiguous. The Court was speaking in 1978, so it\nwas quite natural -- instead of using the word \"now\" to\nput in bracket 1934; and it was necessary to get to that\nquestion of Indian blood which the Court finally got to\nin U.S. v John to -- because otherwise we wouldn't have\nneeded to get to that question, if it had been otherwise\nanswered as -- with respect to the meaning of section\n19.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel.\n"
