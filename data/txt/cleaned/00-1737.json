The Village of Stratton, Ohio.\nMr. Polidoro.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. POLIDORO\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. POLIDORO: Mr. Chief Justice and may it\nplease the Court:\nIt's 11:00 Saturday morning in the Village of\nStratton. Good morning. In light of recent events, I've\nmade a special effort to come to your door to speak to you\nabout what the Prophet Isaiah has referred to as something\nbetter. That's the good news Christ Jesus spoke about,\nthe good news of the Kingdom of God.\nIt is a criminal act to go from door to door in\nthe Village of Stratton and deliver that message unless\none has first obtained a permit from the village to do so.\nIt is also illegal to go from door to door and hand out a\nleaflet that says, democracy is wonderful, please vote\nnext week.\nIn drafting a permit scheme designed to address\nfraud and privacy that includes those interested in pure\ndiscourse, Stratton has eliminated the ability to engage\nin door-to-door, one-on-one political advocacy. As such,\nwe submit the ordinance is overbroad and unconstitutional.\nQUESTION: I don't see how it has eliminated any\nchance of a political -- going door to door in a political\ndiscourse if you register with the mayor and you can't be\nturned down if you fill out that form. You can go door to\ndoor, except where there's a no-trespassing sign.\nMR. POLIDORO: Your Honor, we are not suggesting\nat all that a resident cannot post a no-trespassing sign\nand keep all away from their door. However, in order to\nget the right to go to that door, one must go to the\nmayor, give his name, give a brief description of the\ncause they want to speak about, as well as their\nassociation or affiliation.\nWe believe that this Court in McIntyre said\nthere's an interest in having anonymous works enter the\nmarketplace of ideas, and that unquestionably outweighs\nany interest in requiring disclosure as a precondition to\nentry.\nQUESTION: Well, do you focus on the right of\nanonymity, or the right of unrestricted speech, as of the\ntime you get to the door, or when you go to the mayor's\noffice, because our most recent cases talk about going to\nthe door, and that's where your brief focuses on.\nIt seems to me that what you've begun with, and\nit's also troubling to me, is that you have to make the\ndisclosure to the mayor as well, so I take it those are\ntwo different parts of your case.\nMR. POLIDORO: Correct, Justice Kennedy.\nQUESTION: But you emphasize only the latter,\nreally, in your briefs. Are the records that the mayor\nkeeps, are they open to the public?\nMR. POLIDORO: They are, absolutely, indeed,\nYour Honor. Under Ohio State law those records are open\nto the public, so anyone would be able to go to look at\nthe record, which would include the name, your message,\nand your associations.\nQUESTION: So you would have no objection to\nthis statute if you didn't have to give your name?\nMR. POLIDORO: Your Honor, we --\nQUESTION: It's perfectly okay to say, you can't\ntalk to anybody without getting a permit, so long as you\ndon't have to give your name when you get the permit?\nMR. POLIDORO: Your Honor, we believe the name\nis the constitutional infirmity in deed.\nQUESTION: That's the only problem, so if this\nwere revised somehow so that all you had to give was a\nreference, maybe somebody in the community who would vouch\nfor the integrity of these Jehovah's Witnesses, that would\nthen be okay, because they wouldn't have to --\nMR. POLIDORO: Your Honor --\nQUESTION: The only problem is if they have to\ngive their name. You see, I would have thought you would\nhave objected to the necessity of going to the mayor and\nsaying, please, Mr. Mayor, can I talk to your citizens\ngoing house-to-house, but that's not your problem. Your\nonly problem is that you have to disclose your identity.\nMR. POLIDORO: No, Your Honor. We do not\nbelieve that anyone needs to go to the Government for\npermission to speak to their neighbor about any message,\nmost importantly, a message --\nQUESTION: I think that's the strongest part of\nyour case.\nMR. POLIDORO: Yes, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: But you call them neighbors, but I\ntake it in many cases they're simply strangers who come\ninto town.\nMR. POLIDORO: Well, actually, Your Honor, in\nthis circumstance the Village of Wellsville, which is a\nneighboring village, has assumed responsibility for\npreaching door to door in the Village of Stratton, and\nmany individuals are, in fact, known to each other, and\nthat's common in most areas of this country. We don't\nbelieve that one is required to go to the Government to\nget permission to speak to a private resident owner when\nthe power belongs to that private resident owner to keep\nall away from their door if that owner so chooses.\nQUESTION: Can you tell me why that is? I agree\nthat at some level it seems contrary to our traditions,\nbut if we can focus just on going to the mayor's office,\nit seems to me that one of the strongest parts of your\ncase is that you have to identify your cause. That seems\nproblematic to me. Is that part of your case, and if so,\nwhat is the root constitutional principle that's violated\nthere?\nMR. POLIDORO: Your Honor, Jehovah's Witnesses\nhave a long historical memory as to what they've suffered\nat the hands of municipalities --\nQUESTION: Well --\nMR. POLIDORO: -- purely to go door to door to\nspeak the good news. In this instance, the village is\ncompelling disclosure of name, cause, and associational\ninformation.\nQUESTION: What's wrong with identifying the\ncause?\nMR. POLIDORO: Your Honor, we believe that under\nthis Court's holding there are some individuals who do not\nwant to identify their cause. It opens them up, as\nMcIntyre said, to official retaliation, to economic\nretaliation, to social ostracism, and perhaps, as McIntyre\nsaid, they just don't want to disclose more of their\nprivacy than they have to.\nWe don't believe that on this record the village\nhas shown a necessity to so incumber pure discourse that\nis not the source of harm. There's no allegation in this\ncase that pure religious speech, or pure political speech,\ncause the harm that the village seeks to protect its\nresidents against.\nQUESTION: But I take it your argument only goes\nto the political speech, because as I understand it,\nJehovah's Witnesses do not object to identifying\nthemselves, and your concern is with the overbreadth that\ngoes into the political sphere, is that correct?\nMR. POLIDORO: That is absolutely correct,\nJustice Souter. Jehovah's Witnesses will, indeed,\nidentify themselves at the door, but it's their personal\ndecision to do so.\nQUESTION: And yet the question that you phrase\nsays that this permit, which contains one's name, now,\nwhen we turn to the village's brief, they say, no, it\ndoesn't. The permit doesn't require any names. You have\nto have your name at the mayor's office, the mayor has to\naccept all-comers, as long as you're not fraudulent.\nThere's no discretion that is what infected the old\nprohibitions against the Jehovah Witnesses' speech, so\nhere anybody can go door to door. The name is at the\nmayor's office. The name doesn't have to be disclosed to\nthe homeowner.\nNow, you said in your brief the name has to be\ndisclosed to the homeowner. They say in their brief, no,\nit doesn't, so which one is right?\nMR. POLIDORO: Justice Ginsburg, if I might, at\nthe joint appendix on page 248a there's a copy of the\nblank permit and it says, permit to canvass, to solicit,\net cetera, and it says, in accordance with the relevant\nprovision of the statute, the mayor of the Village of\nStratton, Ohio, has issued to the above applicant a\npermit, the above applicant a permit, so we believe on the\nplain language of the permit, the name is, indeed,\ndisclosed.\nQUESTION: Did you ever apply for a permit?\nMR. POLIDORO: We never did, Chief Justice\nRehnquist.\nQUESTION: So you don't know, as a matter of\npractical fact, how that would work out?\nMR. POLIDORO: That's correct, with respect to\nJehovah's Witnesses.\nQUESTION: It might be a number, applicant\nnumber 5.\nMR. POLIDORO: There's no showing, Justice\nSouter, in the ordinance that there's any sort of\nnumbering scheme.\nQUESTION: Well, no, there's no -- that's the\ntrouble, I think, with the argument. There is no showing,\nbut I suppose the exhibit is consistent with a numbering\nas well as a naming system on the permit card.\nMR. POLIDORO: But Justice Souter, I believe the\nexhibit would be inconsistent with the concession of the\nvillage that name disclosure is, in fact, required at the\ndoor. At page 27 of their brief, and page 29 to 30 of\ntheir brief, they do say that name identity is compelled\nto be disclosed by a resident or by a police officer in\nfurther of his official business.\nQUESTION: They said about five times in their\nbrief that the permit that must be shown to the police\nofficer or the homeowner does not have a name on it --\ndoes not have a name on it. Now, it's very confusing, but\nthis -- I looked at this and said, well, maybe this is the\nbottom -- you have the application, then, you know, you\ntear off the bottom, and this is the bottom, and the\napplicant is above, but the permit that you put in your\npocket doesn't have that name.\nIf that's the case, then why isn't this case\njust like the Buckley case, where this Court said, the\nbadge doesn't have to have the name on it, but we\nrecognize that the Colorado law also says that with every\nset of petitions the circulator has to have an affidavit,\nand that affidavit is filed with the petition, so there is\nan official record of the name and the address of the\ncirculator. Why isn't this just the same thing?\nMR. POLIDORO: It's different for two reasons,\nJustice Ginsburg. First, Buckley dealt with the mechanics\nof the electoral process, and clearly that's a compelling\ngovernmental interest to ensure there's no corruption in\nthat process. The circulator in Buckley wanted to make\nherself part of that process. The rules of that game are\nthat you submit your name when you submit the affidavits.\nWe have something different here indeed. We have just\npure speech unrelated to the mechanics of the electoral\nprocess. The interesting --\nQUESTION: I thought you were saying it only\napplied to those who were engaged in the political -- I\nthought that was the point of your overbreadth objection.\nMR. POLIDORO: I think there's a distinction,\nJustice Souter, to just pure speech, the dissemination of\ninformation and ideas, and speech that in some way\ninvolves the mechanics of the electoral process. You're\ngoing to do something with the information that you obtain\nfrom that householder, and then submit yourself to an\narea, an arena that the Government has a right to have\nsome play in. We don't submit that the Government does\nhave a right in one-on-one intimate conversation about\nreligion or politics, to have a play there.\nQUESTION: But one of your examples was that\ndoor to door solicitation of signatures for an initiative\nto put on the ballot, and that's exactly what was involved\nin the Buckley case.\nMR. POLIDORO: Yes, Justice Ginsburg, but that\ndisclosure took place after the one-on-one dissemination\nof information was done. If that individual did not want\nto submit those affidavits, she could have maintained her\nanonymity. The question is, when can the Government\ncompel you --\nQUESTION: She could not have been a circulator,\nthen, because a condition of being a circulator -- she\ncould not have submitted her petition, because to submit\nher petition she has to have this affidavit, and I don't\nsee -- I really can't see any difference in consequence\nwhether the official form is made before or made after.\nThe point is that the name and address is in an official\nrecord.\nMR. POLIDORO: Because of the compelling\ngovernmental interest that's involved, Justice Ginsburg,\nand that's the distinction. When we have one-on-one --\nQUESTION: That doesn't handle your example. I\nmean, why don't you just say it was a bad example? You\nshouldn't have used the example. It's not worth your\ntime. You shouldn't have used the example of a petitioner\ncirculator. You are concerned about people who just want\nto come up and say, I want to talk to you about why you\nshould vote for Smith.\nMR. POLIDORO: That's correct, Justice Scalia.\nQUESTION: Is that the case?\nMR. POLIDORO: It is, indeed, the case.\nQUESTION: Is it the case that your clients\ndon't ask for any money, not a penny, and they don't sell\nBibles, and they're not selling anything, all that they do\nis say, I want to talk to you about religion? They don't\nask for any --\nMR. POLIDORO: Your Honor, the record is\nabsolutely clear, in the Village of Stratton, Jehovah's\nWitnesses did not ask for money. In other jurisdictions\nthe record is equally clear that sometimes they will\nmention a voluntary donation arrangement. However, to\nmake our interest absolutely clear, what we're involved\nwith in Stratton, we did not mention the voluntary\ndonation arrangement. We are not seeking a solicitation\nof funds. We're merely seeking to talk to people about\nthe Bible.\nNow, Justice Ginsburg --\nQUESTION: Don't you hand out the Watchtower,\ntoo?\nMR. POLIDORO: We do, Your Honor, on a no-cost\nbasis if someone's interested in reading it. We would\nsend that out.\nQUESTION: So you said just -- you briefly\nmentioned -- because you know, I've had many fine\nconversations with Jehovah's Witnesses. It's fine. But\nI've never noticed any of them objecting to anything about\ngiving their name. I mean, is this a real issue here,\nthat for some reason this particular group objects to\ngiving their name? What's the situation?\nMR. POLIDORO: No, Your Honor, Jehovah's\nWitnesses have no objection to giving their name. The\nobjection to giving their name comes in the realm of\nanonymous political discourse. Jehovah's Witnesses have\nfelt that this ordinance, which is designed to regulate\nbusiness transactions, need not have reached pure\nreligious speech, need not have reached pure political\nspeech.\nQUESTION: But you would say that without\nreference to the name. Isn't your position that you don't\nhave to go to the mayor and ask for permission to talk to\na neighbor about something that's interesting?\nMR. POLIDORO: That's correct, Your Honor.\nThat's quite correct.\nQUESTION: Is that here in front of us? I mean,\nwhat I'm having a hard time getting our hands on is, it\nlooks as if a group of people who really don't mind giving\ntheir name are objecting to the name of a different group\nof people who might not, and those might be people who\nmight want to say, vote for Smith, and what's worrying me\nabout deciding this case in the context which is obvious\nfrom the briefs is, that might have considerable legal\nimplications for the question of whether you can require\ndisclosure of campaign contributions, which is a totally\ndifferent issue, but would seem legally related, so I'd\nappreciate those three things that I've mentioned -- you\nsee what I'm -- what the blur is in my mind, and I'd\nappreciate your views on that.\nMR. POLIDORO: Justice Breyer, it has been our\ncontention that the ordinance was drafted in an overbroad\nmanner, meaning reaching speech that was not the source of\nharm, including our religious speech, but also including\npure political speech. When we put forth the interest of\nthose interested in anonymous political discourse, that\nwas under this Court's overbreadth doctrine, and we don't\nbelieve that the Court has to wait until a violation takes\nplace to remove this potential weapon, some sort of weapon\nfrom the hands of the village.\nQUESTION: Of course, to do that we would just\nsay, you can't require the names to be disclosed. We can\nstill require you to check in with the mayor before you go\ndoor to door.\nMR. POLIDORO: Your Honor, we don't see how --\nQUESTION: Have you photograph taken, maybe, you\nknow. You don't have to give a name, but we'll have your\nphotograph on file just in case. That's okay, then,\nright?\nMR. POLIDORO: No, Justice Scalia.\nQUESTION: That's what you want us to do?\nMR. POLIDORO: No, not at all. We don't\nbelieve --\nQUESTION: I didn't think so.\nMR. POLIDORO: We don't believe that this Court\nshould sanction a regulation of a Government that requires\none citizen to get a license to speak to another citizen\nat that citizen's home.\nQUESTION: Okay, but the basis -- as I\nunderstand the nub of your argument is -- goes back to\nyour answer to Justice Ginsburg, and that is -- in\ndistinguishing Buckley, and I think what you were saying\nwas, in Buckley the Government had an interest because it\nhad an interest in checking the veracity of the\nendorsement solicitation, the petition solicitation\nprocess, are these real people, go to the person who asked\nand check, whereas here, if we're not talking about the\nsolicitation of money and of signatures in a political\nsphere, there's nothing for the Government to verify, and\ntherefore there is no interest here, whereas there was an\ninterest in Buckley, and that's the distinction. Is -- am\nI --\nMR. POLIDORO: Precisely.\nQUESTION: -- stating your argument correctly?\nMR. POLIDORO: Precisely, Justice Souter.\nQUESTION: Okay.\nMR. POLIDORO: Precisely.\nQUESTION: The brief didn't mention -- you took\nBuckley as being 100 percent in your favor, and that's\nwhat surprised me, is that Buckley made the very\ndistinction that you say is inappropriate here, that is,\nface-to-face encounter, you don't have to have your name,\nbut back in an official's office, you do.\nMR. POLIDORO: Your Honor, I think that Buckley\nfollowed on language in Your Honor's portion of the\nopinion in McIntyre, where you spoke to limited -- there\nmight be larger circumstances where identification might\nbe required, and in the electoral process, the mechanics\nof how an election works, those are larger purposes.\nWe don't think those larger purposes are present\nin one-on-one conversations --\nQUESTION: You have in your case -- most of the\nJehovah's Witnesses cases dealt with that official who was\nexercising discretion to keep out the Witnesses but\nletting in the Republicans, and that was that line of\ncases. Then we have the, what I call the Village Green\nline of cases. McIntyre would fit in that category.\nBut is there any precedent for saying that if\nyou want to go into private homes in this town, we want to\nknow who you are, and -- but anybody, that applies to\nanybody, and we will give the permit to anybody.\nMR. POLIDORO: Justice Ginsburg, the only\nprecedent that I'm aware of with respect to identification\nschemes comes from the dicta in Cantwell and Martin that\nspeaks about a municipality, a municipality's interest in\nknowing strangers in the community when connected with the\nsolicitation of funds. I don't believe there's any --\nQUESTION: Don't you think that the practice\naround the country of various towns and cities is to\nrequire permits for people to go door to door in\nresidential areas? I think I even live in a community\nthat probably does that. The concern may stem from a\nconcern about preventing burglaries and unfortunate\nincidents in the area, and they want to identify the\npeople who are going door to door.\nMR. POLIDORO: Justice O'Connor, my experience\nis quite to the opposite, that after the battles between\nJehovah's Witnesses and the municipalities in the thirties\nand forties, municipalities have stopped attempting to\nregulate Jehovah's Witnesses by forcing them to get a\npermit to go from door to door. This is an experience\nthat we're having in the past few years, that more and\nmore municipalities are now requiring not only a permit\nbut, as Justice Scalia touched on, finger-printing.\nQUESTION: Well, there was a story in the paper\njust last week here about the double murder up at\nDartmouth, how the kids who did it went from house to\nhouse purporting to be taking a survey, and then what they\nwere actually doing was casing the houses for robbery, so\nthat's certainly something that a municipality can take\ninto consideration, isn't it?\nMR. POLIDORO: Chief Justice Rehnquist, we think\nit's implausible to think that someone intent on\ncommitting a violent crime would stop at the city hall to\nget a permit or in any way be deterred, and in the\ncircumstance Your Honor posits of someone just going door\nto door and observing, or taking notes, the ordinance in\nthis instance doesn't prevent that. The only time the\nordinance comes into play is --\nQUESTION: But it does give a record of who it\nwas, which would probably deter someone.\nQUESTION: I think you're wrong when you said,\nonly if they speak, that the mayor requires anybody who\nrings door to door. That was my understanding of this\nordinance. Anybody who rings door to door has to sign up\nin the mayor's office.\nMR. POLIDORO: No, Chief Justice -- no, Justice\nGinsburg, I believe it's anyone who wants to go door to\ndoor to discuss a cause, and that's the language of the\nordinance. It's the --\nQUESTION: Now, suppose --\nQUESTION: It goes broader than that. It would\napply if you were leaving a leaflet saying, I repair\nroofs, or I do painting, and I'm just going to leave it at\nthe door. It obviously covers all of that without saying\na thing.\nMR. POLIDORO: Which is a speech interest,\nJustice O'Connor. That is a speech interest.\nQUESTION: But suppose I am concerned that the\nmayor, in my view, or the Government has no right to\ndemand previous registration or to give his consent before\nI go to my neighbors to talk about neighborhood problems,\nor whatever. What case do I put down when I write the\nopinion to that effect for --\nMR. POLIDORO: Excuse me, Justice Kennedy, I --\nQUESTION: What's your best case, or best --\nwhat are your best cases for the proposition that it is\nsimply unconstitutional for the Government to require a\npermit before you go door to door to talk about a cause?\nWhat are your best cases?\nMR. POLIDORO: Martin, predicated on Lovell,\npredicated on Schneider. There are interests that the\nGovernment may have to interpose themselves into that\nprocess, Your Honor, but there has to be some sort of real\nsubstantial basis. We think the equity lies with --\nQUESTION: Most of those cases -- I think\nthey're the closest, too, but they're not right on point,\nbecause they were concerned with the discretion --\nMR. POLIDORO: Justice Kennedy --\nQUESTION: -- that the official had --\nMR. POLIDORO: -- there is discretion in this\ninstance. If we look at the ordinance --\nQUESTION: And also may I say there's language\nin those cases that suggests that it would be -- you read\nit yourself, this stranger has to identify himself or\nherself. That runs in those cases as well, but those were\nall cases where the danger was the official who was going\nto pick and choose, and it was wide-open discretion.\nMR. POLIDORO: If I might, Justice Ginsburg and\nJustice Kennedy, when we look at the ordinance on appendix\n4a, and it's section 116.03(b)6), it says that the mayor\ncan ask for such other information --\nQUESTION: 4a of the petition?\nMR. POLIDORO: Of -- I'm sorry, it's our brief\nfor petitioners, Chief Justice Rehnquist, page 4a, section\n(b)(6), such other information concerning the registrant\nand its business or purpose as may be reasonably necessary\nto accurately describe the nature of the privilege desire.\nNow, in this instance --\nQUESTION: That has been taken out of the case.\nMR. POLIDORO: No. No, Justice --\nQUESTION: I thought that the only thing that\nthe mayor asked -- isn't -- wasn't there something in the\ndistrict court opinion that cut that back?\nMR. POLIDORO: No, Your Honor. That is still\nvery much in the case, and very much part of the case.\nThe only thing the district court cut out was the\nreference to Jehovah's Witnesses in the administrative\npaperwork. The Court also said that it was an onerous\nrequirement to make individuals list all the addresses one\nwanted to visit, and said the village could cure that.\nQUESTION: But I thought the village made a\nconcession. It says, all we're going to ask is the name.\nDidn't the village make that concession in some court?\nMR. POLIDORO: No, Your Honor, not at all. This\nprovision --\nQUESTION: I'll ask the village if they did,\nbecause I remember something that said we're going to ask\nonly for the name and the address.\nMR. POLIDORO: No, it --\nQUESTION: Even if that's so, I mean, where a\nslight state of confusion is, I thought this case now\nsounds very theoretical. I thought it would have to do\nwith requiring your name on a permit.\nNow I get into it, and I discover we don't know\nif they require the name on a permit. Then I thought,\nwell it had to do with requiring the name when you go to\nthe city hall, and now I see there's a problem here\nbecause your group doesn't mind, but you're trying to talk\nthrough somebody else. Then I thought, well, maybe it\nrequires a matter of discretion at the city hall, but then\nI get a record which is forcing me to decide this on the\nassumption, all you do is go to city hall, and they give\nit to you automatically. Then I thought it had to do with\nfraud, but there's no money.\nSo now I think it has to do with somebody who\ngoes there and asks for a permit, which he gets\nautomatically, and what's the objection to that? You\ndon't want to do it, and what's to be said on the other\nside, not much --\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: -- but I guess they'll say, well,\nhere at least he'll read the rules. At least he'll see\nthat there are some people who don't want any\nsolicitation, and we can be sure that that will happen, so\nit looks like there's something on the one side and I\ndon't know how much on the other.\nQUESTION: Mr. Cantor, I'm confused here. I\nthought that you object to this even if the name doesn't\nhave to be disclosed, and even if there is not excessive\ndiscretion with the mayor.\nMR. POLIDORO: Exactly, yes.\nQUESTION: Is that your objection, that you do\nnot want to have to go to city hall in order to ring\ndoorbells --\nMR. POLIDORO: Precisely, Justice Scalia.\nQUESTION: -- no matter what?\nMR. POLIDORO: Precisely.\nQUESTION: They want you there because they know\nat least you'll find out which homeowners don't want\npeople around, and you'll read what the rules are, all\nright. Is that good enough?\nMR. POLIDORO: Justice Breyer, we have not\ncontested that provision of the ordinance, section 116.07,\nwhich allows a homeowner to post a no-solicitation sign\nand then go to the village and say, I want this group and\nnot this group, has not been contested.\nQUESTION: But your position is, of course, that\nGovernments always want to know what it's people are\nthinking, but they don't have any right to find out.\nMR. POLIDORO: Well, that's an expression of the\nresidents' interest in who they want. It's not the\nGovernment making the decision for them.\nNow, with respect to the --\nQUESTION: I'm talking about your clients.\nMR. POLIDORO: Your Honor, we --\nQUESTION: Take it. Take it. It's good.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. POLIDORO: I think that's an appropriate\npoint Chief Justice Rehnquist asked. If I may reserve the\nbalance of my time.\nQUESTION: Very well, Mr. Polidoro.\nMR. POLIDORO: Thank you.\nQUESTION: Mr. Cantor, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF ABRAHAM CANTOR\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. CANTOR: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nStratton is exercising its police power when it\nseeks to protect the privacy of its residents, when it\nseeks to deter crime. The no canvassing or soliciting on\nprivate property ordinance simply requires preregistration\nand the carrying of a permit during the course of the\ndoor-to-door activity.\nQUESTION: Do you know any other case of ours\nthat has even involved an ordinance of this breadth, that\ninvolves solicitation, not asking for money, not selling\ngoods, but even, you know, I want to talk about Jesus\nChrist, or I want to talk about protecting the\nenvironment? Is there -- have we had a case like that?\nMR. CANTOR: There is --\nQUESTION: The mere fact that -- I'm familiar\nwith something like -- maybe they've become current now,\nbut the mere fact that I don't even know of such cases,\nover two centuries, makes me --\nQUESTION: You haven't been around that long.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: I -- do you know of any?\nMR. CANTOR: Your Honor, there's no holding by\nthis Court that identifies this --\nQUESTION: Never mind a holding, a case. A case\nin this Court involving -- the breadth of this thing is\nnovel to me.\nMR. CANTOR: There is no case that identifies\nthe breadth of this case, but perhaps that might be part\nof the beauty, beauty in the sense that it is content-\nneutral, and that is --\nQUESTION: You think it's a beautiful idea that\nI have to ask the Government for permission before I go\ndown the block, where I don't know all of the people, I\nwave to them but I don't really know them, I say, I want\nto talk to you because I'm concerned about the garbage\npick-up, because I'm concerned about our Congressman,\nwhatever. I have to ask the Government before I can do\nthat?\nMR. CANTOR: No, Your Honor --\nQUESTION: It's astounding.\nMR. CANTOR: No, Your Honor. What we are\ntalking about is canvassers, hawkers, and those who are\ngoing door to door for a cause.\nQUESTION: Well, how about trick-or-treaters?\nDo they have to go get a permit?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. CANTOR: Interesting --\nQUESTION: Under this ordinance it looks like\nit, doesn't it?\nMR. CANTOR: Your Honor --\nQUESTION: And they're soliciting, too.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: They are. Does it cover them? I'm\nserious.\nMR. CANTOR: The answer is no, and --\nQUESTION: Why not? Literally it does.\nMR. CANTOR: The track --\nQUESTION: You may not enforce it, but it\nliterally covers them, doesn't it?\nMR. CANTOR: That hypothetical was raised by the\ntrial court judge, Your Honor, and it was answered by\nMr. Bruzzese to the negative, and the reason why it was\nanswered to the negative is that these people are not --\nwho are going door to door are not seeking to communicate,\nthey are begging candy, and therefore --\nQUESTION: That's Girl Scouts.\nMR. CANTOR: Yes, Girl Scouts would be covered.\nQUESTION: Or Christmas carollers?\nMR. CANTOR: Sale -- sale would constitute\nconduct that would be require --\nQUESTION: Or how about borrowing --\nQUESTION: This is really --\nQUESTION: -- a cup of sugar from your neighbor?\nDo I have to get a permit to go borrow a cup of sugar from\nmy neighbor?\nMR. CANTOR: No, Your Honor, I don't believe --\nQUESTION: This is really a novel argument.\nYou're saying this thing is okay, this ordinance is okay\nbecause it addresses only communication.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: Anything else is okay. It's only\ncommunication that we're concerned about.\nMR. CANTOR: The limiting language, Your Honor,\ndeals with canvassing and hawking of the area.\nQUESTION: Okay, go back to Justice Kennedy's\nexample that started all of this. The neighbor wants to\ngo up and down the street because he doesn't think the\ngarbage collection is very good. That's a cause. He's\ngot to register, right?\nMR. CANTOR: No, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Why?\nMR. CANTOR: Because it is not the type of cause\nthat the communication is directed at.\nQUESTION: Well, who knows? I mean, where's the\nrestricted definition of cause?\nMR. CANTOR: Within the beginning of the\nordinance.\nQUESTION: And what's the language that you rely\non?\nAll right, you're on page what?\nMR. CANTOR: I'm looking at section 116.03. It\nis in the respondent's brief, page 3a.\nQUESTION: 3a, okay. Okay, now tell me where\nyou're reading from, and let's go --\nMR. CANTOR: No canvasser, solicitor, peddlar,\nhawker, itinerant merchant, or transient vendor of\nmerchandise or services who is described in 116.01 of this\nchapter, and who intends to go in or upon private\nproperty, or a private resident of the village, for any\nother purposes described in .01, shall go in or upon such\nprivate property or residence without first registering.\nQUESTION: Okay. Well, in .01, where does the\ndefinition exclude people with a cause, like Justice\nKennedy's neighbor who wants the garbage picked up?\nQUESTION: I mean, unless you're interpreting\ncanvasser very literally, in which case it wouldn't\ninclude Jehovah's Witnesses -- why are Jehovah's Witnesses\ncovered? Are they canvassers, solicitors, peddlers,\nhawkers, itinerant merchants or transient vendors of\nmerchandise or services? They're none of those, are they?\nMR. CANTOR: The district court determined that\nthey were canvassers.\nQUESTION: They were canvassers. So you have a\nvery broad definition of canvassers, if it includes\nJehovah's Witnesses. I would have thought a canvasser was\nsomebody who said, I'm doing a survey, I'm canvassing\npublic opinion, or something like that, but if it includes\nJehovah's Witnesses, it certainly includes the, you know,\nthe garbage canvasser, so --\nQUESTION: The dictionary says canvasser is a\nperson who's looking for a vote. It doesn't include them\nat all, at least the dictionary definition wouldn't, but\nyou've -- it's conceded that the city does -- what's the\npurpose? That is, what -- your brief is all about fraud,\nbut fraud seemed to have to do with money, and the\nordinance seems to have to do with money. I haven't read\nanything in your brief that says what the purpose is for\nrequiring these people who are not interested in money,\nnot interested in selling, not even interested in votes,\nto go the city hall and register. What's the city's\npurpose?\nMR. CANTOR: The city's purpose is to prevent\nannoyance of the property owner. Chief Justice Rehnquist\nmentioned that there was a no-trespassing provision within\nthe ordinance. There is also a no-solicitation -- there's\na no-trespassing portion in the ordinance. There's a no-\nsolicitation portion in the ordinance. That portion\nallows a registrant who lives within the community and who\nhas private property to register with the community and\nindicate they do not want to be solicited, they don't want\nto be canvassed.\nQUESTION: That's not challenged, as I\nunderstand it.\nMR. CANTOR: That is correct, Your Honor, that\nis not challenged.\nQUESTION: All right, so given that, what's the\npurpose of the registration?\nMR. CANTOR: The purpose is to prevent -- the\npurpose of the registration, the initial registration is\nto identify who in the community is going door to door.\nQUESTION: Because?\nMR. CANTOR: Because of two factors, the privacy\nof the person who is --\nQUESTION: How does it work? Spell it out. I\nmean, how does it work? I mean, what's the connection\nbetween the purpose and the result, which is you have to\ncome to the mayor and get a permit? It's not obvious to\nme. Maybe I'm being dim, but I don't see it. I see it\nwith asking for money. You want to know who's asking for\nmoney so if they lie, you find out later, but where\nthey're just interested in a cause, spell it out, if you\ncan, please, for me.\nMR. CANTOR: In Martin v. Struthers, Your Honor,\nin footnote 5, this Court relied upon the utilization of a\nbook as well as an FBI bulletin to determine that those\nwho go door to door may be doing so as a guise. The Sixth\nCircuit Court of Appeals identified that you cannot\ndetermine who is going door to door with regard to the\ncriminality aspect of it, and therefore it would not\nsuffice to simply say that just because you are having a\nconcern over money or sales, that that's enough. You can\ngo door to door for a purpose such as spreading the new,\ngiving additional information. That can be the outward,\nthe outward point of view, but in reality it could be\nsomething very different.\nQUESTION: It could be, and I suppose you could\nsay everybody who gets up on a soapbox may provoke a riot,\nbut you know, this seems to me one of the normal risks of\nlife. It doesn't let the Government go around making it a\nprivilege to go -- I love the last provision of the\nordinance -- what is it, 116.03(b)(6) says that the mayor\ncan demand such other information concerning the\nregistrant and its business or purpose as may be\nreasonably necessary to accurately describe the nature of\nthe privilege desired, the privilege of going about to\npersuade your fellow citizens about one thing or another.\nI just can't understand that.\nQUESTION: That was the provision that I thought\nwas out of it because of the concession that the city\nmade. If I'm wrong on that --\nMR. CANTOR: Your Honor, the provision remains.\nThe provision is a catch-all to determine -- make sure\nthat the identifying information is present, the\nidentification of the individual as well as the cause.\nQUESTION: Wasn't there some point when the\nmayor said, all I'm going to ask is the name and the\naddress?\nMR. CANTOR: The first five sections of that\nsubsection give the information. That information is\nconsistent with this Court's suggestion in Martin v.\nStruthers at footnote 14 as well as Cantwell.\nThe purpose has also been discussed in the\ncontext, Your Honor, of how it would benefit the\ncommunity. There was testimony at the time of trial from\nHelen MacMurray, chief of the public -- chief of the\nConsumer Affairs Section of the Iowa Attorney General's\nOffice, and she determined that legislation of this type\nis helpful because it deters individuals who have an\nimproper motive from signing up and going door to door.\nQUESTION: Well, footnote 14 of Martin has to do\nwith solicitation of funds.\nMR. CANTOR: That's correct, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: And your ordinance is much broader\nthan that.\nMR. CANTOR: That's correct, Your Honor.\nThere -- it is indistinguishable to determine who was\ngoing door to door. The -- Justice O'Connor had indicated\na situation where people were claiming they were going\ndoor to door prior to the commission of a murder. They\nwere going for a reason that was --\nQUESTION: No. No. No, the -- footnote 14 of\nMartin v. Struthers --\nMR. CANTOR: Yes, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: -- you cited when we were talking\nabout whether or not you can at least give your name, said\nthis is necessary for those who solicit funds, but your\nordinance goes much -- sweeps much more widely than the\nsolicitation of funds, so footnote 14 doesn't support the\nordinance that is now before us.\nMR. CANTOR: I'm going to suggest to Your Honor\nthat it does, and the reason that it does is because it\nrequires identification information, and that\nidentification information is necessary regardless of\nwhether someone is going to solicit funds, or whether or\nnot he is going to go door to door for some other purpose,\nas a pretext.\nQUESTION: Well, what about using the telephone?\nI -- you know, that's a common ploy of people who want to\ncommit a crime. You know, my car broke down, can I use\nthe telephone. Is there a risk of that? Of course. Of\ncourse there's a risk. So should you require everybody\nwho rings a doorbell to get finger-printed at city hall\nbefore you can ring a doorbell? That minor risk of a\ncrime occurring is enough to require everybody who wants\nto ring a doorbell to register at city hall? Of course it\nisn't.\nMR. CANTOR: The determination of the nature and\nthe amount of risk is perhaps highlighted by MacMurray's\ntestimony. She found that legislation of this nature had\npreviously been suggested in communities where disasters\nhad occurred. It was her opinion that, as a result of\nthis type of legislation, that potential fraudulent\ntransactors decided to not register within the community\nand would bypass it.\nIn addition, it was an aid to law enforcement in\nthe event that there was, in fact, some type of\ncriminality, and finally, it was an aid to the elderly,\nand it was an aid to the elderly because it gave them a\nbright line to determine whether or not the individual\nbefore them was one that was properly registered. In\notherwise, it heightened the awareness of the propriety of\nthe individual at the door.\nBoth the district court as well as the Sixth\nCircuit Court of Appeals determined that this was content-\nneutral legislation, that it applied to the parties in\nthis case --\nQUESTION: Well, McIntyre suggests that an\nanonymity requirement makes it content-based. What are we\nto do about that?\nMR. CANTOR: Your Honor, the issue in -- at the\nregistration aspect deals with that we are not at the\npoint of persuasion. McIntyre was a automatic inclusure\nof information when the reader took the document and was\nattempted to be persuaded.\nThe pre-registration format is probably closer\nto Buckley, where that is the other end of the book end,\nwhere this is not at the point of persuasion. Buckley is\nafter the persuasion occurs, so we would suggest to you\nthat it is appropriate to register in advance of going\ndoor to door to prove the purpose of the ordinance.\nQUESTION: Well, the disclosure means that it\ncertainly is not anonymous. How do we resolve the dispute\non what the permit has to contain, whether it contains the\nname or not?\nMR. CANTOR: Your Honor, I would suggest that\nyou would resolve it based on the record. The record\nidentifies the permit. The record identifies an\nidentification of that permit, which is the testimony of\nthe village's mayor, and it is found at page 386 of the\njoint appendix. That is the only information concerning\nthe identification of the permit.\nQUESTION: Well, we're not supposed to be\nresolving these back-door questions. In the first\ninstance you can't tell from that form whether it has an\napplicant's name or a number or nothing.\nMR. CANTOR: Your Honor, this case was tried on\nthe registration requirement. This, we would suggest to\nyou, is a belated attempt on the issue of the content of\nthe permit to bring it before the Court.\nQUESTION: Well --\nQUESTION: You mean, it originally was that they\njust didn't want to register, anonymous or not?\nMR. CANTOR: No, Your Honor. The attack was\nalways on the registration issue. The attack was always\nto determine whether or not they were included within the\nphraseology --\nQUESTION: Right. Right.\nMR. CANTOR: -- of the language.\nQUESTION: Well, the question we took refers to\ndisplay upon demand.\nMR. CANTOR: The permit --\nQUESTION: We've not limited the case to that.\nMR. CANTOR: The display, there is a display of\nthe permit required on demand.\nQUESTION: One of the things in this record that\nyou did delete, at one time you gave the homeowners a\nchoice specifically of Jehovah Witnesses in or out, but --\nMR. CANTOR: Yes, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: And that, now you've deleted that,\nbut could the village say to the homeowner, it's your\nchoice, you tell us who you want and you don't want, and\nwe'll enforce that, so if you don't want the Jehovah\nWitnesses you don't have to have them, you don't want the\nDemocrats you don't have to have them? Would that be\npermissible for the village to do to facilitate the\nhomeowner's choice?\nMR. CANTOR: The village would be acting as a\nbulletin board. It would be the homeowner, the private\nresident would be making a determination as to who would\nbe making the content, so in that type of a context --\nQUESTION: And the village could enforce that\nprivate discrimination?\nMR. CANTOR: Your Honor, there is no requirement\nthat anyone decide that anyone allow someone else to come\ninto their home whether for a good or a bad purpose. The\nindividual has the right to exclude even valid ideas from\ntheir home place. It is the privacy issue here that we\nare suggesting --\nQUESTION: Does the State -- when the State\nassists that private choice -- we're talking about\nlimitations on the State, not on the homeowner.\nMR. CANTOR: Well, we're only assisting -- the\nprior cases that this Court has considered deals with the\nGovernment being some type of a censor or a limiter of the\nspeech that is going.\nStratton doesn't do that. Instead, it says,\neveryone's going to come to your door unless you register\nto indicate no solicitation. At that point in time, the\nidentification of who can come to the door is identified\nby the resident of that dwelling. That information is\nprovided to the person who is going door to door not to go\nto this particular place if you fall within the framework.\nQUESTION: Suppose the homeowner said, only\nCaucasian solicitors?\nMR. CANTOR: No, I believe that that would be\ninvalid on its face. The -- it would not be different\nfrom something in a title search situation, where there\nwould be something, a remnant from the forties.\nQUESTION: How is that any different from no\nJehovah Witnesses?\nMR. CANTOR: Because the issue there is that\nthis is a speech that is not -- that they do not wish to\naccept.\nQUESTION: That's very nice. I don't know. I\ndon't know. We have general trespass laws, and I suppose\nif somebody doesn't want a Jehovah's Witness to trespass\nand is perfectly willing to let everybody else trespass, I\nguess the State might enforce that. I don't know.\nMR. CANTOR: Well, the issue here, Your Honor,\nis dealing with whether or not this is a consensual\nintrusion. If it's with consent, then there is no\ntrespass.\nWith regard to no solicitation, it should be\nreminded that the record below would indicated that the\nJehovah Witnesses do not consider themselves as\nsolicitors, and therefore would not abide by a no\nsolicitation sign, and that -- they, however, would abide\nby a no trespassing sign.\nQUESTION: I take it there are many gated, so-\ncalled private communities where the solicitor can never\ngo in at all. I don't know, maybe that -- I assume that's\nthe way they work. I'm not sure.\nMR. CANTOR: In the Village of Stratton --\nQUESTION: And in a sense, I guess you're just\ntrying to give your residents the protection that people\nhave when they live in a closed-in place.\nMR. CANTOR: That would be appropriate to\ncompare it to.\nQUESTION: Although I don't -- I haven't seen\nany cases. That would be like Marsh v. Alabama, perhaps.\nMR. CANTOR: Thank you, Your Honor. Thank you.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Cantor.\nWe'll hear from you, Mr. Gormley.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID M. GORMLEY\nON BEHALF OF OHIO, ET AL., AS AMICUS CURIAE,\nSUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. GORMLEY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe ordinance in this case differs from the\nstatute in McIntyre in two critical ways. First, it\napplies only when someone goes onto the private property\nof a village resident. Of course, in McIntyre, that Ohio\nstatute required Mrs. McIntyre to put her name on a piece\nof paper wherever she wanted to distribute it, on a public\nsidewalk, even in her own home, outside a polling place,\nanywhere. This ordinance is much more narrow. It only\napplies when the speaker wants to go onto someone else's\nprivate property.\nQUESTION: Not necessarily. I mean, you're\nenvisioning little cottages with a pathway up to the door.\nDon't you have anybody who's in an apartment building,\nwhere the Jehovah's Witness knocks on the door? He's not\non that person's private property. He just knocks on the\ndoor.\nMR. GORMLEY: But Your Honor, the ordinance --\nQUESTION: Or maybe another house, that they\ndon't have a setback restriction, the door is right, you\nknow, right on the public sidewalks, knocks on the door.\nMR. GORMLEY: But the point is, Your Honor, the\nordinance is designed to protect the concerns that village\nresidents have, no matter how much space is between them\nand a sidewalk.\nQUESTION: That's a different point, but I mean,\nI don't think you can say that the difference is that this\ninvolves only speech that occurs on private property, not\nnecessarily. Not necessarily.\nMR. GORMLEY: Nonetheless, Your Honor, the point\nwould be that when someone knocks on a door, no matter how\nfar away they are from a sidewalk or a street, there is\nconcern on the part of the resident that this often a\nstranger, certainly an uninvited person, is here on my\nproperty, perhaps just a few inches away from a public\nway, but nonetheless coming to my home, perhaps asking to\nactually enter my home, and I think the village is\nentitled to say, we're concerned about that kind of\nactivity.\nQUESTION: Oh, you're concerned about people who\nwere even not concerned about it. I mean, that's the\nproblem. Those people that are concerned can put up a\nsign that says, no solicitors, but the village is saying\neven those people who welcome Jehovah Witnesses, they're\nsitting their lonely, they would love to talk to somebody\nabout anything --\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: -- and these people still have to go\nregister with the mayor to get the privilege of ringing\ntheir doorbell.\nMR. GORMLEY: But Your Honor, that's no\ndifferent than the Frisby case decided by this Court 14\nyears ago. It may well be that some people are not\nconcerned about picketing outside a home. Nonetheless,\nthe Court upheld an ordinance there that was content-\nneutral and so described by the Court, and said a village,\na city was entitled to enforce it. The same is true --\nQUESTION: Well, we have always said that\npicketing is an activity which is focused, it's constant,\nit repeats a message over a long period of time, and\nthat's simply different from a single encounter, which is\nwhat you prevent.\nMR. GORMLEY: Nonetheless, I think in both\nsituations, Your Honor, the Government is rightly\nconcerned about an activity that causes some public\nproblem. In the one case, certainly annoyance of a\ncontinuous nature, in the other, natural fear on the part\nof people when some uninvited person shows up on their\nproperty, and --\nQUESTION: But that is met, as has already been\npointed out, by the opportunity to put up a no-\ntrespassing, no solicitor sign.\nMR. GORMLEY: It addresses --\nQUESTION: Why does the ordinance have to do\nmore?\nMR. GORMLEY: Sure, well, certainly no\ntrespassing signs address some of the problem, but those\noften provide after-the-fact remedies, if someone actually\ninvades the space you can prosecute, but by then you may\nwell not be able to find the person any more, and even\nwith the no-solicitation registration form that the\npetitioners have not challenged, that does not protect the\nperson who, for whatever reason, chooses not to put up\nsuch a sign.\nPerhaps people want to be visited by solicitors\nonce they've registered and, in fact, it may well\nencourage some people who would otherwise put up a no-\nsolicitation sign on their property to take that down,\nbecause they now have confidence in this village that\nthese people are registered, there'll be some way to track\nthem down if something goes wrong.\nQUESTION: Well, what standard of review should\nwe apply, do you suppose, in looking at this ordinance?\nMR. GORMLEY: Well, I think that both of the\ncourts below applied the proper approach. It's a content-\nneutral, time, place and manner regulation. The mayor has\nno discretion in terms of issuing the permits.\nQUESTION: Well, that would be intermediate\nscrutiny?\nMR. GORMLEY: That's what the court of appeals\ncalled it, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: And under that standard, aren't\nyou -- the Government required to show that it restricts\nno more speech than is reasonably necessary to accomplish\nits interests?\nMR. GORMLEY: That's correct.\nQUESTION: I take it that's the standard?\nMR. GORMLEY: Yes, Your Honor, and I think\nthat's true here, because every time that someone\napproaches the private property, comes onto the private\nproperty of a village resident, those residents are\nrightly concerned about who this uninvited person is, and\nwhat are they going --\nQUESTION: Why couldn't you serve all those\npurposes if you just print up some signs that people can\nput up if they want saying, no canvassers without a\npermit. People who want to get all that assurance can get\nit, people who don't, don't have to.\nMR. GORMLEY: But I think the village rightly is\nconcerned with having some information --\nQUESTION: Given, say, the imaginary signs, what\nis the purpose? What is the purpose to require them just\nto come down to the mayor?\nMR. GORMLEY: Because it gives some record on\nfile about who these people are, thereby giving village\nresidents a little greater sense of security that if\nsomething goes wrong when this person is on my land, I'm\nnot going to be left without any --\nQUESTION: If that person turns out to be a con\nman, too, it would enable a better chance of locating him\nto make --\nMR. GORMLEY: Absolutely. In the worst case\nscenario though, the purposes are certainly clear, I\nthink.\nQUESTION: Can you give me an example of a con\nman who doesn't want any money or anything else?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. GORMLEY: Oh -- just coming into --\nQUESTION: We're serious.\nMR. GORMLEY: -- into your house, maybe he wants\nto steal your property. I don't know if that's\nnecessarily taking money, but he might want to come in\nand --\nQUESTION: Potential thief, a person --\nMR. GORMLEY: Sure.\nQUESTION: A potential thief who is willing to\nrape and burgle, but stops short of failing to register at\ncity hall, right?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. GORMLEY: Your Honor --\nQUESTION: This gives your citizens treat\nconfidence that --\n(Laughter.)\nMR. GORMLEY: But, Your Honor, I think the fact\nthat the ordinance is not going to catch everyone who's\ngoing to do something wrong doesn't mean that the village\nis not entitled to try to do something to give its\nresidents some comfort. You probably passed people this\nmorning on the highway who don't have a license to drive.\nIt doesn't mean the Government can't --\nQUESTION: The question is, how much? How\nnecessary is it? We can all stipulate that the safest\nsocieties in the world are totalitarian dictatorships.\nThere's very little crime. It's a common phenomenon, and\none of the costs of liberty is to some extent a higher\nrisk of unlawful activity, and the question is whether\nwhat this is directed at stops enough unlawful activity to\nbe worth the cost of requiring the privilege of ringing\nsomebody's doorbell.\nMR. GORMLEY: I think it does, Your Honor, and\nit's a very modest restriction. Remember, there's nothing\nthat the mayor can do to prevent someone from getting the\npermit. It's essentially a declaration that I intend to\ngo door to door in your community, and whether the mayor\nwants to give it out or not, he's going to do it, but that\nseems to me much different than a --\nQUESTION: It's so modest that we can't find a\nsingle case reporting a single municipality that has ever\nenacted an ordinance of that type. I don't think that's\nmodest.\nMR. GORMLEY: Well, but I think, Your Honor,\nit's a -- it shows that this village is perhaps trying to\ntake some proactive steps that other communities have not\nto try --\nQUESTION: Do we know where the village got it\nfrom? I don't think it was original with this village,\nwas it?\nMR. GORMLEY: I'm not sure. In Richard Riordo's\namicus brief, he refers to similar ordinances in Plano,\nTexas, Oshkosh, Wisconsin, and Grand Rapids Township,\nMichigan. I believe that the village solicitor -- and odd\ntitle, the village's attorney came up with the draft of\nthis ordinance on his own. There had been, as I\nunderstand it, similar ordinances in this village dating\nback into the forties. My guess as they probably had the\nsame defects that Cantwell and other ordinances had.\nQUESTION: The mayor here said in his\ntestimony -- it's on 385a of the -- I've never -- I never\nhave denied anybody a permit. Nobody has ever asked for\none.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. GORMLEY: I think --\nQUESTION: That's extraordinary.\nMR. GORMLEY: I think he was speaking about the\nJehovah's Witnesses, Your Honor. At the time of the\nhearing in the district court, six people had requested\npermits and received them. Those begin on page 230 of the\njoint appendix. I believe now 15 people have received\npermits.\nQUESTION: Could the city say, to facilitate the\nhomeowners' choice, we're going to say, nobody rings bells\nfor anything, but the homeowner -- make the homeowner the\none to come to sign up in city hall to say, I don't mind\nhaving solicitors.?\nMR. GORMLEY: Certainly that's the part of the\nordinance that the petitioners have not challenged here.\nHomeowners can both post the no --\nQUESTION: But suppose, in order to meet the\nobjection that the solicitors don't want to sign up, or\nthe canvassers don't want to sign up, the city says, well,\nwe'll just have a total ban on ringing doorbells, but any\nhomeowner who wants to have it can?\nMR. GORMLEY: I mean, given your -- the Court's\ndecision in Martin, I'd be hesitant to say you can have an\noutright ban on ringing doorbells or knocking.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Gormley.\nMR. GORMLEY: Thank you, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Mr. Polidoro, you have 4 minutes.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. POLIDORO\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. POLIDORO: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. If\nI make a few points, please.\nJustice O'Connor asked a question as to whether\nthis would apply to trick-or-treaters. I open to the\njoint appendix, page 199, which is one of the no-\nsolicitation registration forms, Your Honor. Indeed,\ntrick-or-treaters are -- and specifically, point 13,\ntrick-or-treaters during Halloween are mentioned, so\nthey're encompassed under the ordinance.\nToo, I heard a point being made about the\nordinance being a way to help track down the bad guys.\nThere's no independent verification mechanism in this\nordinance at all. I can go to the village hall and say\nI'm Abraham Cantor and get a permit and go from door to\ndoor. Mr. Bruzzese at page, transcript page 174, and\nMs. MacMurray, page 478a, both recognized the ordinance\nhas no verification mechanism to tie in to the person\nwho's asking for the permit.\nWith respect to discretion, Mayor Abdullah\ntestified that -- and this is in the transcript, pages 124\nand 126, that if someone came, gave their name, address,\ncause, and said they were unaffiliated with an\norganization, he would likely not issue a permit to them.\nWe believe that this is manifestly exercise of discretion.\nAnd lastly, Your Honors, I've heard our door-\nto-door activity be referred to as an annoyance to be\ncompared to obnoxious picketing at the home. I\nrespectfully suggest that our activity indeed lies at the\nheart of the First Amendment.\nQUESTION: I wanted to ask you, if you're\nthrough --\nMR. POLIDORO: Yes.\nQUESTION: -- I don't want to take your rebuttal\ntime -- as I looked at page 199 and I thought that was a\nlist of exceptions to the ordinance.\nMR. POLIDORO: It is, and what --\nQUESTION: So that in other words the trick-or-\ntreaters are expressly excepted, just like Christmas\ncarollers and the others listed.\nMR. POLIDORO: Well, what had happened there,\nJustice Stevens, they would be accepted if the box was\nchecked and they were allowed, and on that particular\nform, no one was allowed at the door.\nQUESTION: You mean the person applying for the\nordinance has to check all these things to be -- I don't\nquite understand how it --\nMR. POLIDORO: No, what --\nQUESTION: This is the homeowner who allows\ncertain solicitations. This is the homeowner's form.\nMR. POLIDORO: That's the homeowner's form.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr.\nPolidoro.\nMR. POLIDORO: Thank you.\n"
