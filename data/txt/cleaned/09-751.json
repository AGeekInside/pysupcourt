        "content": "(10:02 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument\nfirst today in Case 09-751, Snyder v. Phelps.\nMr. Summers.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF SEAN E. SUMMERS\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. SUMMERS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nWe are talking about a funeral. If context\nis ever going to matter, it has to matter in the context\nof a funeral. Mr. Snyder simply wanted to bury his son\nin a private, dignified manner. When the Respondents'\nbehavior made that impossible, Mr. Snyder was entitled\nto turn to the tort law of the State of Maryland.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Are we just talking about a\nfuneral? That's one of the problems I have with the\ncase. There was also this video that -- that your\nclient watched, right, later, after the funeral?\nMR. SUMMERS: There was a flier that was\nsent out prior to the funeral. We have the funeral and\nwe have what they described as the \"epic,\" which was put\non the Internet afterwards, which --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Right. Well, what does\nthat have to do with the funeral?\nMR. SUMMERS: As the district court\nexplained, and the circuit court followed their logic,\nand I think the facts at trial confirmed this, that the\nepic was essentially a recap of the funeral protest\nitself. That's --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's fine, but it -- it\ndoes not intrude upon a funeral. I mean, no. You --\nyou either have two separate causes of action -- one is\nthe intrusion upon the funeral, and the other is the\nharm caused by viewing this -- this posting on the\nInternet. But I don't see how they both relate to\nintrusion upon the funeral.\nMR. SUMMERS: Well, the --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And they were just\nsubmitted to the jury as one big lump, right?\nMR. SUMMERS: Well, we had the flier that\nwas submitted, that was sent out before the funeral. We\nhad the facts of the funeral. And, yes, the epic did --\nof course, we focused on the personal, targeted comments\nin the epic when we presented our evidence. But, yes,\nit was --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Suppose there hadn't been a\nfuneral protest, just the epic. Would that have\nsupported the cause of action you -- you assert here?\nMR. SUMMERS: I think that's a closer call.\nBut when we have the personal --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes or no?\nMR. SUMMERS: I would say yes, because we\nhave the personal, targeted epithets directed at the\nSnyder family.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Even though it's -- he\ndoesn't have to watch them? They're just posted on the\nInternet.\nMR. SUMMERS: That's correct,\nJustice Scalia.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's his choice to watch\nthem, but if he chooses to watch them he has a cause of\naction because it causes him distress.\nMR. SUMMERS: Well, the -- he has a cause of\naction. That doesn't mean he's going to win. You still\nhave the pleading standards, the summary judgment\nstandards, and the motion to dismiss standards.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, why does he have a\n-- a claim? As I understand it, after this case arose\nMaryland passed a statute putting time, place, and\nmanner restrictions. I read that statute, and it seems\nto me that there was nothing unlawful, nothing out of\ncompliance with that statute, that was done here.\nIt was at considerable distance. There was\nno importuning anyone going to the funeral. It stopped\nbefore the funeral, the service, began.\nAm I right that, under the current statute,\nthis conduct was not unlawful?\nMR. SUMMERS: Justice Ginsburg, the statute\nwasn't in place at the time. But there's a complicated\nanswer to the question, because they were positioned\nabout 30 feet from the main vehicle entrance to the\nchurch, and they rerouted the funeral procession so they\nwere 200 to 300 feet away from there.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Didn't they -- didn't\nthey stand where the police told them to?\nMR. SUMMERS: Well, they -- they told the\npolice where they wanted to stand, and the police said\nokay. So the police didn't say, please stand here.\nThey said -- in fact, they sent out a flier --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And they were there to\nthe knowledge of the police and with the permission of\nthe police.\nMR. SUMMERS: It's true they did not violate\nany criminal statutes, Justice --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Is there anything to suggest\nthat the Maryland legislature, in enacting that statute,\nintended to occupy the field of regulations of events\nthat occur at funerals?\nMR. SUMMERS: I believe the -- the Maryland\nlegislature made it clear that they didn't want people\nto protest funerals in general. When you --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But they didn't prohibit\nit.\nMR. SUMMERS: They did prohibit it under\ncertain circumstances and in a certain --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Which this the case,\nwhich the facts here meet.\nMR. SUMMERS: For statutory enforcement.\nBut what we're dealing with here is tort law.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, if that statute\napplies to any protest at funerals, protesting the\nVietnam War, protesting whatever, your case involves, at\nleast if we accept your version of it, a protest of the\n-- of a dead soldier who -- who is going to Hell and\nwhose parents have raised him to go to Hell. So simply\nto say you can have a protest within a certain distance\nis not to say you can have a protest within a certain\ndistance that -- that defames the corpse. That's --\nthat's a different issue, isn't it?\nMR. SUMMERS: That's our position, yes,\nJustice Scalia. And --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You -- you knew just what\nwas going on. Do you suppose -- because this had been\ndone before. In fact, wasn't this the very same day\nthey picketed at Annapolis and at the State Capitol?\nMR. SUMMERS: They picketed, yes, those\nthree locations that day.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So they knew what the\nsigns were going to be. Could they have gotten an\ninjunction, do you suppose, against this protest?\nMR. SUMMERS: I don't think they could have\nbeforehand because, although you said we knew what the\nsigns were going to be, generally from their pattern I\nthink we could guess what the signs may have been, but\nyou don't really know what the signs are going to be\nuntil they show up. For example, in this case, they had\na sign that said \"Priests Rape Boys\"; they had a sign\nthat said \"God Hates You\"; \"You're Going to Hell.\"\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So you could go into\ncourt and say the signs were this, that, or the other\nthing at the State Capitol, the same signs at Annapolis;\nthey're going to use the same signs at this protest.\nMR. SUMMERS: As -- Justice Ginsburg, from\nour perspective, the signs that said \"God Hates You\";\n\"You're Going to Hell\" referred directly to Matthew\nSnyder, and we would hope and believe that the district\ncourt could enjoin those types of specific targeted\nepithets.\nIf, for example, this was done at a public\npark in Montana, logically I think you could conclude\nthat it wasn't directed at the family. But when you\nshow up at a 20-year-old Marine's funeral and say\n\"You're Going to Hell\" --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Did they have the \"Going\nto Hell\" sign at the State Capitol at Annapolis?\nMR. SUMMERS: They had -- the majority of\nthe signs were the same, yes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Those particular ones\nthat you mention, did they have those at the other two?\nMR. SUMMERS: Yes. I believe the only ones\nthat they changed were they have a sign for each\ndifferent branch of the service. Matt was a Marine, so\nhe --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So it sounds like the\n\"you\" is the whole society, the whole rotten society, in\ntheir -- in their view.\nMR. SUMMERS: If we're forced to accept\ntheir view, yes, Justice Ginsburg, that's what they\ntestified to. Mr. Snyder's view, the view of the Fourth\nCircuit, was that these \"God Hates You\" and \"You're\nGoing to Hell\" signs specifically referred to Matthew\nSnyder and the \"Thank God for Dead Soldiers\" -- Mr.\nSnyder certainly interpreted that as referring to his\nson, because after all Matthew Snyder was the only\ndeceased Marine/soldier at the funeral.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Where did -- you said the\nFourth Circuit found that those signs targeted the\nfamily rather than the whole U.S. society?\nMR. SUMMERS: The \"God Hates You\" and the\n\"You're Going to Hell\" sign were the ones that the\nFourth Circuit said they can avoid that issue, because\nthey can simply say this was hyperbolic and protected\npursuant to its interpretation of Milkovich under\ndefamation law and then its extension of\nHustler v. Falwell.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Do you think that the epic\nis relevant as an explanation of some of these arguably\nambiguous signs that were displayed at the funeral? For\nexample, \"You're Going to Hell\"; \"God Hates You\" -- who\nis \"you\"? If you read the epic, perhaps that sheds\nlight on who \"you\" is.\nMR. SUMMERS: It can shed light, but if you\nput this in the context of a funeral-goer,\nJustice Alito, what you have is -- it was a typical\nfuneral. Family members driving in and --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, yes, but the signs say\n\"you,\" and the argument is made \"you\" doesn't mean\nMatthew Snyder; it means a larger group. And then you\nhave the epic, which is directed directly at Matthew\nSnyder. Doesn't that show -- shed light on what \"you\"\nmeant on those signs?\nMR. SUMMERS: Correct, and that's where I\nwas going to go with that, Justice Alito. The epic\nspecifically referenced Matthew Snyder by name,\nspecifically referenced Matthew's parents by name. So\nin our judgment, and the defendants testified that the\nepic sort of explained, at least in their explanation,\nexplained the funeral protest itself.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I'm not certain that this\nis about the funeral. I mean, I understand there was a\nfuneral in it, but the First Amendment question seems to\nme a different -- possibly a broader and different\nquestion. Did your client see the signs? I gather from\nthe record he didn't see what the signs were; he just\nsaw tops of signs. So he didn't read anything on the\nsigns; is that right?\nMR. SUMMERS: He didn't read the content.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So he hadn't seen them. So\nhow does -- how did your client find out that the signs,\nthe tops of which he saw at the funeral when the\ndemonstrators were standing with the approval of the\npolice, 300 feet away -- how did he find out what they\nsaid?\nMR. SUMMERS: Your Honor, 2 days in advance,\nthey sent out a flier announcing they were going to\nprotest the funeral. They had Matthew Snyder's picture\nthere. They claimed they were going to protest at\nSt. John's Catholic dog kennel.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Did they say in -- my\nquestion is, how did your client find out these very\nobjectionable things on the signs? How did he find out\nwhat they said?\nMR. SUMMERS: He found out about the\nspecifics of the signs --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes, that's what I'm\ninterested in.\nMR. SUMMERS: -- by going to the family wake\nimmediately following and seeing it on the television.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay. So now we have two\nquestions. One is, under what circumstances can a group\nof people broadcast on television something about a\nprivate individual that's very obnoxious? And because\nof the funeral, you said that -- I accept that from your\npoint of view; that is very obnoxious. And the second\nis, to what extent can they put that on the Internet,\nwhere the victim is likely to see it? Either on\ntelevision or by looking it up on the Internet.\nNow, those are the two questions that I'm\nvery bothered about. I don't know what the rules ought\nto be there. That is, do you think that a person can\nput anything on the Internet? Do you think they can put\nanything on television even if it attacks, say, the most\nprivate things of a private individual? Does\nMaryland's -- does Maryland's law actually prohibit\nthat? We know it does. And what should the rules be\nthere?\nHave I said enough to get you talking?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. SUMMERS: Yes, Your Honor.\nRight now the rule we're stuck with is\nHustler v. Falwell for intentional infliction of\nemotional distress, and the --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Your -- your claim is\nthat Hustler was a -- Falwell was a public figure, and\nthe Snyder family is not. So I think what I got from\nyour brief is you don't fall under that case because\nyou're not dealing with a public figure.\nMR. SUMMERS: That's correct, Justice\nGinsburg.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay. Were you\nfinished --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, you can go ahead and\nfinish --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Were you finished\nanswering Justice Breyer's question?\nJUSTICE BREYER: The more you say about\nthis, the happier I'll be, because --\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: I'm quite interested.\nMR. SUMMERS: The private, targeted nature\nof the speech, in our judgment, is what makes it\nunprotected. So, for example, the epithets directed at\nthe family would be unprotected. If, for example, a\nperson repeatedly put on the Web site that Mr. Smith has\nAIDS, whether it's true or not, essentially at some\npoint in time, it might rise to the level of an\nintentional infliction of emotional distress. There\nwould have to be other facts combined there.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You -- so you have\nno objection if the sign said \"Get out of Iraq\" or\nantiwar protests; in other words, not directed at this\nparticular individual?\nMR. SUMMERS: Correct. I don't think\nthere'd be --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So no objection\nthere?\nMR. SUMMERS: I don't think there'd be any\nconstitutional impediment to bringing -- or the\nConstitution would not -- would bar that claim from\ngoing forward.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Excuse me --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So the intrusion upon the\nprivacy of the funeral is out of the case then, right,\nbecause that sign would intrude upon the privacy of the\nfuneral just as much? That's not really what you're\ncomplaining about. You're complaining about the\npersonal attacks, aren't you?\nMR. SUMMERS: Yes, Justice Scalia, and I\nthink under a certain scenario, you could have --\nregardless of the signs, you could have a scenario where\nthe funeral was disrupted, and it was disrupted in this\ncase.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: It was or it wasn't?\nMR. SUMMERS: It was, Justice Ginsburg.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought that -- that\nwhen the service itself began, the protesters stopped.\nMR. SUMMERS: The police testified that, I\nthink it was, about 8 minutes after the funeral started,\nthat the protesters left the area.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Were they heard and\ndeterred --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I thought that they had to\nturn in a different entrance? Is that -- is that the\nextent of the disruption?\nMR. SUMMERS: Well, according to, I believe,\nall the witnesses, yes, they had to come in --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: In order to avoid the\nprotest?\nMR. SUMMERS: That, and they certainly took\naway -- according to the priest that was coordinating\nthe mass, they certainly took away the peaceful\nexperience that all private figures --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But you wouldn't have\nobjected to that if there weren't these nasty signs, you\njust said, right?\nMR. SUMMERS: No. I said -- I hope I said,\nJustice Scalia, that under the right context, just the\nsigns alone -- if that's all we're saying, there's a\nsign out there that says \"God Hates America,\" I don't\nthink that we could have a claim there. But if they, in\nfact, disrupted the funeral, I do think in some set of\nfacts there could be a claim.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: All right.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, I'm trying to\ntease out the importance of the -- whether the person's\na private nature or public figure -- a private person or\na public figure. Does it make a difference if I am\ndirecting public comments to a public or private figure?\nMR. SUMMERS: Well, in the context of\ndefamation, we had the Rosenbloom followed by the Gertz\ndecision.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No, I'm talking about in\nterms of infliction of emotional distress. If I am\ntalking to you as a Marine, if you were a Marine, and I\nwas talking about the Iran war and saying that you are\nperpetuating the horrors that America is doing and said\nother things that were offensive, would you have a cause\nof action because you are being called a perpetrator of\nthe American experience?\nMR. SUMMERS: I'd think there'd be -- have\nto be a lot more facts involved, harassing type of\nfacts. The --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But you're saying yes.\nSo public speech, speech on a public matter, if directed\nto a private person, should be treated differently under\nthe law? I think that was part of what Justice Breyer\nwas asking. Is that what your position is?\nMR. SUMMERS: Public speech, even directed\nto a private figure, should be treated differently than\nas directed towards a public official.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. And under\nwhat theory of the First Amendment would we do that?\nWhat case would stand for -- our case -- stand for the\nproposition that public speech or speech on a public\nmatter should be treated differently depending on the\nrecipient of the speech?\nMR. SUMMERS: Gertz v. Welch treated the\npublic versus private figure status different, albeit --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: That was defamation,\nwasn't it?\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's defamation.\nThat's false -- truth or falsity. But --\nMR. SUMMERS: Correct. Correct, but the\nproblem is the only other case we have that deals with\nintentional infliction of emotional distress from this\nCourt is Hustler v. Falwell, and Hustler v. Falwell\nclearly dealt with a public figure. The States have\ninterpreted Hustler v. Falwell as not applying to a\nprivate figure.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But have they done it in\nthe context of differentiating between public and\nprivate speech?\nMR. SUMMERS: Yes, there is an Illinois case\nthat we've cited in the brief where it was specifically\nsaid it was a matter of public concern, and they said\nthe plaintiff was not a public figure; therefore, the --\njust you have to meet the elements of intentional\ninfliction of emotional distress.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I was not talking about\nState cases. I was talking about a Supreme Court case\nthat suggested that we would treat -- we would treat the\nFirst Amendment and the right to -- to speak on public\nmatters differently, depending on the person to whom it\nwas directed.\nMR. SUMMERS: I think Gertz v. Welch says\nthat. Dun & Bradstreet says you have to at least look\nat the context of the situation.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So it always goes to the\ncontext. Now, going to the context of this speech, do\nwe look at the words on a sign alone, or do we look at\nthe entire context of what all of the other signs said\nat the demonstration, to determine whether or not the\nspeech here was public or private speech?\nMR. SUMMERS: I think you have to look at\nthe particular signs, because if you don't, anyone could\ncome up with a public concern, because they could direct\nany type of epithets at a person. In the middle of\ntheir paragraph they could say I'm for taxes or I'm\nagainst taxes. And, therefore, the entire statement\nwould be --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, in that case --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Summers, I'm a little\nconcerned at your apparent acceptance of -- of the\nproposition that if one comes up to a Marine and says,\nyou're contributing to a -- a terribly unfair war, that\nthat alone would -- would form the basis for the -- the\ntort of intentional infliction of an emotional distress.\nWhat -- what are the requirements for that?\nI thought that it had to be outrageous conduct. Doesn't\nit have to be outrageous conduct?\nMR. SUMMERS: It does, Justice Scalia, and I\nwasn't suggesting that --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I mean -- I mean, why\naccept that as -- as parallel to what -- to what you're\nclaiming here?\nMR. SUMMERS: And I hope I didn't. What I\nmeant to say, if I didn't, was there would have to be a\nlot more facts involved to rise to the level of an\nintentional infliction of emotional distress case if you\njust told the Marine, for example, you're not in favor\nof the war.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What about the -- taking --\nif you have an instance where the defendant has said on\ntelevision or on the Internet something absolutely\noutrageous. You show that. You show that it was\nintended to and did inflict serious emotional suffering.\nYou show that any reasonable person would have known\nthat likelihood. And then the defendant says: Yes, I\ndid that, but in a cause, in a cause. And now -- in a\ncause that we are trying to demonstrate how awful the\nwar is.\nAt that point, I think the First Amendment\nmight not leave this alone. But if it's not going to\nleave this alone, there's where we need a rule or we\nneed an approach or we need something to tell us how the\nFirst Amendment in that instance will begin to -- enter\nand force a balancing.\nIs it that you want to say no -- no punitive\ndamages in such a case? Or that you would have to\ninsist upon a particularly clear or a reasonable\nconnection between the private part of this and the\npublic effort?\nHave you thought about that at all? Because\nthat's where I am thinking and having trouble.\nMR. SUMMERS: The -- I think the standard\nshould be Hustler v. Falwell generally does not apply --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Hustler -- Hustler v.\nFalwell is defamation.\nMR. SUMMERS: I thought Hustler v. Falwell\nwas intentional infliction of emotional --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Intentional infliction,\nokay, good. Thank you. Go ahead.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Summers --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, answer then, please.\nMR. SUMMERS: I think the rule should be\nHustler v. Falwell generally does not apply to a private\nfigure unless the defendants can show some compelling\nconnection there, and if you --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Compelling.\nMR. SUMMERS: If you -- or at least\nreasonable, rational connection. In this case, they\ndon't even claim there's a connection. They just used\nthis moment to hijack someone else's private event when\nthey are grieving over a 20-year-old child's funeral.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Summers, Hustler seems\nto me to have one sentence that's key to the whole\ndecision, and it goes like this. It says:\n\"'Outrageousness' in the area of political and social\ndiscourse has an inherent subjectiveness about it which\nwould allow a jury to impose liability on the basis of\nthe jurors' tastes or views, or perhaps on the basis of\ntheir dislike of a particular expression.\"\nHow does that sentence -- how is that\nsentence less implicated, in a case about a private\nfigure than in a case about a public figure?\nMR. SUMMERS: Well, at least in Hustler --\nJustice Kagan, at least in Hustler v. Falwell we had a\ntraditional area of public discourse. We had a parody.\nI believe the opinion went to great length to explain\nthat.\nHere what we're talking about is a private\nfuneral. I don't -- I would hope that the First\nAmendment wasn't enacted to allow people to disrupt and\nharass people at someone else's private funeral.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: But that goes back to the\nquestion that was asked previously about -- suppose you\nhad a general statute that just said there will be no\ndisruptions of any kind at private funerals. You know,\npick your distance, 500 feet, 1,000 feet, but something\nthat didn't refer to content, that didn't refer to\nideas, that just made it absolutely clear that people\ncould not disrupt private funerals. What harm would\nthat statute not address in your case?\nMR. SUMMERS: Well, the States have -- in\nthe statutory case, they have the interest of penalizing\nthe offending party. In tort law, the State's interest\nis to provide a remedy for its citizens. Under the\nFourth Circuit's interpretation of these facts, Mr.\nSnyder has absolutely no remedy, none. He's a private\nfigure, a grieving father, and he is left without any\nremedy whatsoever.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: We have other instances\nwhere conduct is lawful, meets all the terms of the\nstatute that's meant to govern protests at funerals, and\nyet there's an award of damages permitted.\nMR. SUMMERS: I believe that the\nHustler v. Falwell was a -- had several tort claims, but\nthere was no criminal statute violated. I understand\nthat it went the other way because of the public figure\nstatus, but that would be an example.\nAnother example --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, that was a -- I'm\nasking you for an example where -- a Federal case where\nthe conduct was permitted by the statute, by the\npolicemen there, and yet there was -- was a damage\naward.\nMR. SUMMERS: Justice Ginsburg, I'm not\naware of any case, but I think the -- if, for example,\nsomeone sued someone for defamation, there probably\nwouldn't be a statute that was violated so I don't -- I\nwould presume --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I'm talking about this\nintentional infliction of emotional distress claim that\nyou're bringing.\nMR. SUMMERS: Other than Hustler v. Falwell,\nI do not have any Federal cases to cite to you. The\nState cases we cited in our brief --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Is this a situation in which\nall conduct that complies with the Maryland funeral\nprotest statute is lawful? If the Maryland legislature\nsaid this is the -- these are the exclusive regulations\nthat apply here, so that if someone came up to Mr.\nPhelps at the funeral and spat in his face, that would\nnot be -- that wouldn't be illegal?\nMR. SUMMERS: Justice Alito, I don't know\nwhether that would be criminally --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Because it's not\nspecifically prohibited by the statute?\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, it certainly\nwouldn't be because of the distance. I mean, you'd have\nto be a lot closer than the Maryland statute allows to\nspit in someone's face.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Perhaps you would\nlike to answer Justice Alito's question.\nMR. SUMMERS: I believe that you could\ncommit a tort and still be in compliance with the\ncriminal code, Justice Alito.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Summers, can I -- can I\nask this? Suppose -- suppose I don't think you have a\ncause of action for invasion of privacy when these\npeople were at this distance from the funeral. But that\nwas one of the causes of action submitted to the jury.\nIf I disagree with you on that cause of\naction, I suppose I'd have to say there has to be a\nretrial now.\nMR. SUMMERS: Of course, this Court could do\nthat, Justice Scalia, but --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So you have to support both\ncauses of action here, the intentional infliction of\nemotional distress and the invasion of privacy, right?\nMR. SUMMERS: Yes, Justice Scalia. But\naccording to the Fourth Circuit, we agree that the\nRespondents waived that issue by not appealing that\nissue.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Waived -- waived what\nissue?\nMR. SUMMERS: The invasion -- or elements of\nthe invasion of privacy. They didn't contest that we\nmet the elements of the tort. They -- they contested\nthe constitutional issue, but not whether or not we met\nthe elements of the tort.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, all right. Okay.\nMR. SUMMERS: Could I reserve the remainder?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMs. Phelps.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MARGIE J. PHELPS\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMS. PHELPS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nWhen members of the Westboro Baptist Church\nentered an ongoing, extensive, public discussion and\nwide array of expressive activities taking place in\ndirect connection with the deaths and funerals of\nsoldiers killed in Iraq and Afghanistan, they did so\nwith great circumspection, and they did so with an\nawareness of the boundaries that have been set by the\nprecedents of this Court.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Ms. Phelps, suppose --\nsuppose your group or another group or -- picks a\nwounded soldier and follows him around, demonstrates at\nhis home, demonstrates at his workplace, demonstrates at\nhis church, basically saying a lot of the things that\nwere on these signs or -- or other offensive and\noutrageous things, and just follows this person around,\nday-to-day.\nDoes that person not have a claim for\nintentional infliction of emotional distress?\nMS. PHELPS: Any non-speech activity, like\nstalking, following, importuning, being confrontational,\ncould indeed give rise to a cause of action.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Demonstrations outside the\nperson's home, outside the person's workplace, outside\nthe person's church -- demonstrations, not disruptions,\nbut saying these kinds of things: You are a war\ncriminal -- what -- what would -- whatever these signs\nsay or worse.\nMS. PHELPS: My answer, Justice Kagan, is\nno, I don't believe that that person should have a cause\nof action or would under your cases have a cause of\naction. You couldn't give that cause of action without\ndirect reference to the viewpoint, which is exactly what\nhappened in this case. And --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: My goodness. We -- we did\nhave a doctrine of fighting words, and you acknowledge\nthat if somebody said, you know, things such as that to\nhis face, that wouldn't be protected by the First\nAmendment.\nMS. PHELPS: We agree that fighting words\nare less protected under the First Amendment.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Unprotected.\nMS. PHELPS: I will go with unprotected,\nJustice Scalia. And if I may add this: Fighting words\nrequire imminence, they require proximity, and they\nrequire a lack of those words being part of a broader\npolitical or social speech.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Is -- is that so? Do we\nknow that?\nMS. PHELPS: I beg your pardon?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Do we know that? Is it the\ncriterion of the fighting words exception to the First\nAmendment that there be an actual fight? Certainly not\nthat. Is -- is it a requirement that there be a\npotential for a fight? I doubt it.\nMS. PHELPS: I think --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Where -- where do you get\nthe notion that it has -- that there has to be an\nimminent fight?\nMS. PHELPS: I get the notion from the\nseries of cases starting within 7 years after your\nChaplinsky case with the Gooding case and on down\nthrough the Brandenburg case and on down --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Which say what?\nMS. PHELPS: That say that --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The person was too remote?\nThe fight was not -- was not imminent?\nMS. PHELPS: The -- the definition, the\nworking definition of \"fighting words,\" is that they\nhave to be words which by their nature are likely to\nincite an immediate breach of the peace and not occur in\nthe context of some social, artistic, educational, or\npolitical kind of speech.\nAnd if I may hasten to add, Justice Scalia,\nthese Respondents were not charged with fighting words.\nThe jury was not instructed to limit themselves to\nfighting words. No element of the torts under which\nliability attached included fighting words.\nThe words that were at issue in this case\nwere people from a church delivering a religious\nviewpoint, commenting not only on the broader public\nissues that the discussion was under way in this nation\nabout dying soldiers, about the morals of the nation --\nJUSTICE ALITO: But is it --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Ms. Phelps, there's no\nquestion that these signs and the signs like that we saw\nduring the Vietnam War. But you had the demonstration\nat the capitol, and you had the demonstration at\nAnnapolis. This is a case about exploiting a private\nfamily's grief, and the question is: Why should the\nFirst Amendment tolerate exploiting this bereaved family\nwhen you have so many other forums for getting --\ngetting across your message, the very same day you did?\nMS. PHELPS: Right. So several pieces to\nthat, Justice Ginsburg. When I hear the language\n\"exploiting the bereavement,\" I look for what is the\nprinciple of law that comes from this Court? And the\nprinciple of law, as I understand it, is without regard\nto viewpoint, there are some limits on what public\nplaces you can go to, to deliver words as part of a\npublic debate.\nIf you stay within those bounds -- and under\nthese torts even, this notion of exploiting, it has no\ndefinition in a principle of law that would guide people\nas to when they could or could not. And if I may --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Is it your -- is it your\nargument that the First Amendment never allows a claim\nfor the intentional infliction of emotional distress\nbased on speech unless the speech is such that it can be\nproven to be false or true?\nMS. PHELPS: In --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Is that your -- is that\nargument?\nMS. PHELPS: With a -- yes, Justice Alito,\nand with a little bit more from your cases, if I may:\nAnd not under an inherently subjective standard, and\nwhere you're only claiming that the impact of the speech\nwas adverse emotional impact.\nJUSTICE ALITO: All right. Well, Justice\nKagan gave you one example. Let me give you another\nexample along the same lines.\nLet's say there is a grandmother who has\nraised a son who was killed in Afghanistan or in Iraq by\nan IED. And she goes to visit her son's -- her\ngrandson's grave, and she's waiting to take a bus back\nto her home. And while she's at the bus stop, someone\napproaches and speaks to her in the most vile terms\nabout her son: He was killed by an IED; do you know\nwhat IEDs do? Let me describe it for you, and I am so\nhappy that this happened; I only wish I were there; I\nonly wish that I could have taken pictures of it. And\non and on.\nNow, is that protected by the First\nAmendment? There's no false statement involved, and\nit's purely speech.\nMS. PHELPS: Right. And -- and it may give\nrise to some fighting words claim, depending on the\nproximity and the context. And I would have to know\nwhat --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, it's an older -- it's\nan elderly person. She's really probably not in -- in a\nposition to punch this person in the nose.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And she's a Quaker, too.\n(Laughter.)\nMS. PHELPS: Justice Scalia, let us assume\nthat the grandmother had not done what Mr. Snyder did in\nthis case. Mr. Snyder, from the moment he learned of\nhis son's death, went to the public airways multiple\ntimes in the days immediately before and immediately\nafter --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Do you think that\neverybody --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What is your answer\n-- what is your answer to Justice Alito's question? Do\nyou think the First Amendment would bar that cause of\naction or not?\nMS. PHELPS: There would have to be a very\nnarrow circumstance where it didn't, Mr. Chief Justice.\nThat's my answer.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you think there\nare situations where a tort of intentional infliction of\nemotional distress is allowed, even for a matter of\npublic debate?\nMS. PHELPS: Not public debate,\nMr. Chief Justice. That is not the way I understood the\nhypothetical he posed me.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I understood\nthe hypothetical, that the person disagreed with the war\nin Iraq and the sending of American troops there.\nMS. PHELPS: Right. And knew that this\nelderly woman was the grandmother of a soldier. And I\nwould ask the question in the hypothetical, how they\nknew, which is why I was making reference to what Mr.\nSnyder did.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, if that --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The person selects\nthe grandmother because he thinks that will give maximum\npublicity to his views. Now, is -- does the First\nAmendment bar that cause of action or not?\nMS. PHELPS: If the grandmother entered the\npublic discussion, the First Amendment bars it.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, no --\nJustice -- Justice Alito posed, the grandmother was\nreturning from the grave of her grandson. She didn't\nenter the public discussion at all. So I'm anxious to\ndetermine whether in those circumstances you think the\nFirst Amendment allows that cause of action or not.\nMS. PHELPS: I'm reluctant to say that it\ndoes not, Mr. Chief Justice. However --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But you gave the answer\nbefore about -- you said stalking.\nMS. PHELPS: Right.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Isn't this comparable to\nstalking?\nMS. PHELPS: And that's what I was trying to\nliken it to, and that's what it sounds more like to me.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you think it\nsatisfies the normal tort or law against stalking for\nsomeone to come up to an individual and engage in\ndiscussion? I thought a lot more was required.\nMS. PHELPS: Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I\nwould not file that claim for that person, for that\nelderly grandmother. I am not prepared, without knowing\nmore, to say absolutely there could be no cause of\naction. What I am prepared to say is there was\nabsolutely much more than that in this case.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, if that -- if that's a\npossibility there's a claim there, then what\ndistinguishes that from this case?\nNow, I thought you were beginning to say\nthat my hypothetical is different because Mr. Snyder\nmade his son into a public figure, and the question I\nwanted to ask in that connection is whether every\nbereaved family member who provides information to a\nlocal newspaper for an obituary thereby makes the\ndeceased person a public figure?\nMS. PHELPS: Not the deceased person,\nJustice Alito. We don't allege that the young man dead\nwas a public figure. We do --\nJUSTICE ALITO: But if the grandmother\ncalled up the local paper and said: Let me tell you\nsomething about my grandson --\nMS. PHELPS: Yes.\nJUSTICE ALITO: -- who was just killed in\nIraq. You know, he liked football and camping.\nMS. PHELPS: Right.\nJUSTICE ALITO: That makes him -- that makes\nher a public figure?\nMS. PHELPS: It's getting closer. And\nJustice Alito, if she went on then to say: And how many\nmore parents like me and my ex-wife are going to have to\nsuffer this way and when will this senseless war end,\nand I've gotten Congressman Murtha on the phone and\ntalked about this situation, and I'm against the war?\nAnd then proceeded to repeat that question in the public\nairwaves repeatedly, then a little church where the\nservants of God are found say, we have an answer to your\nquestion that you put in the public airwaves, and our\nanswer is you have got to stop sinning if you want this\ntrauma to stop happening --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But Your response --\nyour response to Justice Alito is dwelling on the facts\nof this particular case.\nMS. PHELPS: Yes, sir.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm interested in\nknowing what your position is on the broader question.\nCan you imagine a circumstance where this same type of\ndiscussion is directed at an individual and yet would\ngive rise to the tort of emotional distress?\nMS. PHELPS: Yes, I can imagine,\nMr. Chief Justice.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry -- can or\ncannot?\nMS. PHELPS: I can.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You can.\nMS. PHELPS: I can imagine that there could\nbe a circumstance, a hypothetical, where there was not\nthis level of involvement, and it was out of the blue\nand it was \"up close,\" if I may use the term,\nconfrontational.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay. So if you\nrecognize that there can be a tort of emotional distress\nin circumstances like that, isn't that the factual\nquestion of whether it rises to that level of\noutrageousness, which is part of the tort for the jury?\nMS. PHELPS: I don't agree with that,\nMr. Chief Justice, because you've now taken an\ninherently subjective standard with the absence of any\nof these non-speech misbehaviors. And now you are back\nto only -- the only barrier between a person and their\nFirst Amendment right to robust public debate, including\nthis Court has said, outrageous statements --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Does it make --\nMS. PHELPS: -- is that an --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry.\nMS. PHELPS: -- with just that subjectively\ninherent standard and that subjective statement of\nemotional impact. This Court has said repeatedly --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Does it make a\ndifference --\nMS. PHELPS: -- we won't let that go.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Does it make a\ndifference, which seems to me to be the case here, that\nMr. Snyder was selected not because of who he was, but\nbecause it was a way to get maximum publicity for your\nclient's particular message?\nMS. PHELPS: That is not accurate,\nMr. Chief Justice, with due respect.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, assuming it is\naccurate, does that make a difference?\nMS. PHELPS: The -- the motive of the\nspeaker to get maximum exposure, which every public\nspeaker pines for, looks for, strives for, and is\nentitled to -- does not change the legal principle\nthat's at play.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, it might\naffect whether or not the selection inflicts emotional\ndistress for a reason unconnected with the individual\nwho is the subject of emotional distress.\nMS. PHELPS: Well, if --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: In other words, if\nthe person is selected because, as I indicated, it gives\nmaximum publicity, rather than because of a particular\nconnection to the matter of public debate, I wonder if\nthat makes a difference.\nMS. PHELPS: I think it makes a difference\nwhen you are looking at what role the plaintiff had in\nthat public discussion and how tied the words that they\nseek to punish are to his role in that public\ndiscussion. I think that's how you get to the point --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Well, Ms. Phelps, let's say\nthat we disagree with you as to whether Mr. Snyder had\nat all injected himself into this controversy. Or let's\ntake a case where it's clear that the father of the\nfallen soldier had not injected himself, had not called\nany newspapers, had not said anything to anybody, but a\ngroup knew that this funeral was taking place and was\nthere with the same signs, with the same -- are you --\nare you saying that that makes the difference? That\nthere, there would be a claim?\nMS. PHELPS: I'm -- I'm saying it does make\na difference, and no -- but no, there would not be a\nclaim there in my opinion because --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: So it's not a difference\nthat matters.\nMS. PHELPS: It is a difference that matters\nin some measure, I believe, Justice Kagan, in this wise:\nI believe that the umbrella of protection under the\nFirst Amendment that this Court has established firmly\nis speech on public issues. Sometimes you get under\nthat umbrella because it's a public official or it's a\npublic figure, but the umbrella that you give the\nprotection for is speech on public issues.\nNow, when a plaintiff comes to your Court\nand says, I want $11 million from a little church\nbecause they came forth with some preaching I didn't\nlike, I think it does make a difference for the Court to\nlook closely at what role did that man have in that\npublic discussion.\nJUSTICE ALITO: But your argument depends on\nthe proposition that this is speech on a matter of\npublic concern; is that correct?\nMS. PHELPS: Absolutely, Justice Alito.\nJUSTICE ALITO: So let me -- let me give you\nthis example. Suppose someone believes that\nAfrican-Americans are inferior, they are inherently\ninferior, and they are really a bad influence on this\ncountry. And so a person comes up to an\nAfrican-American and starts berating that person with\nracial hatred.\nNow, is that -- this is just any old person\non -- any old African-American on the street. That's a\nmatter of public concern?\nMS. PHELPS: I think the issue of race is a\nmatter of public concern. I think approaching an\nindividual up close and in their grill to berate them\ngets you out of the zone of protection, and we would\nnever do that.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But that simply --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: That simply points out\nthat all of us in a pluralistic society have components\nto our identity; we're Republicans or Democrats, we're\nChristians or atheists, we're single or married, we're\nold or young. Any one of those things you could turn\ninto a public issue and follow a particular person\naround, making that person the target of your comments,\nand, in your view, because this gives you maximum\npublicity, the more innocent, the more removed the\nperson is, the greater the impact -- the Justice Alito\nhypothetical in -- in the grandmother case.\nSo I -- I think -- I think your -- your\npublic concern issue may -- may not be a limiting factor\nin cases where there is an outrageous conduct and where\nthere should be a tort.\nMS. PHELPS: Well, but, again, this Court\nhas given substantial, longstanding protection to speech\non public issues. And how could it be gainsaid that the\ndying soldiers is not on the lips of everyone in this\ncountry? And it is a matter of great public interest\nand why they are dying, and how God is dealing with this\nnation. Were you to consult the Joint Appendix and see\nthat at the very same funeral, right outside the front\ndoor of the church, were people with flags and signs\narticulating the \"God bless America\" viewpoint, and so\nthis little church --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But your position is that\nyou can take this and you can follow any citizen around\nat any point? That -- that was the thrust of the\nquestions from Justice Kagan.\nMS. PHELPS: Not follow --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And -- and Justice Alito,\nand it seems to me that there -- you should help us in\nfinding some line there.\nMS. PHELPS: Yes, I will help you,\nJustice Kennedy, and I am pleased to do that because we\ndon't do follow-around in this church. We were a\nthousand feet away, seven picketers a thousand feet\naway, out of sight, out of sound, not just standing\nwhere the police said to stand --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But in the -- but the\nhypotheticals point out that there can be an intentional\ninfliction of emotional distress action for certain\nharassing conduct.\nMS. PHELPS: For harassing conduct, not for\nspeech. Not for public speech, Justice Kennedy.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But torts and crimes are\ncommitted with words all the time.\nMS. PHELPS: I agree with that. And there\nhas never been any allegation in this case that the\nwords of the Westboro Baptist Church were in any\ncategory of low-value or less protected speech.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, that's --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Let's talk\nabout subjectively. You're concerned about -- surely\nfighting words is -- you know, whether something is a\nfighting word, that's a very subjective call, isn't it?\nMS. PHELPS: I believe that your cases give\nsome good light on that, Justice Scalia.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You don't think it's\nsubjective?\nMS. PHELPS: There may be in some people's\nmind an element of subjectivity. My 20 years of --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You think that's solid,\nabsolutely, what's a fighting word; whereas, what is an\noutrageous statement is -- is very much different from\nwhat's a fighting word? I don't see the difference.\nBesides which, isn't it the case that in\norder to recover for the tort of intentional infliction\nof emotional injury, you have to substantiate the injury\nwith some physical manifestation, which the plaintiff\nhere had?\nAnd, my goodness, for fighting words, you\ndon't even need that. You can just say, these words\nangered me to the degree that I would have been inclined\nto fight. At least for this tort, you have to have\nphysical manifestations.\nWhy isn't that a very objective standard?\nMS. PHELPS: Well, because the Court said it\nwas inherently subjective in the Falwell case. And I\nthink that the language that Justice Kagan brought\nforth, and there's a few more paragraphs that follow,\nidentify why it's inherently subjective.\nAnd the way this case was tried identifies\nwhy it's inherently subjective, where although two signs\nand then three were identified as actionable by a\nstrange reading of those words, all of the preachments\nof Westboro Baptist Church, including all of the signs\nat that picket, all of the signs at other pickets, and\nall their doctrines went to a jury with that inherent --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So your point depends --\nMS. PHELPS: -- inherently subjective\nstandard.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- depends upon the\nproposition that what is outrageous is more subjective\nthan what is fighting words, right?\nMS. PHELPS: Well, Justice Scalia, I must\nhasten to say this: I am not a fan of the fighting\nwords doctrine. I do think it has problems. I just\ndon't think it applies in this case.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The Court has made that a\nvery narrow category, hasn't it? I mean, we have not\nallowed the fighting words -- you say that to me and I'm\nimmediately going to punch you in the nose, because I\nhave -- it's an instinctive reaction.\nI think the Court has rejected spreading\nfighting words beyond that.\nMS. PHELPS: And especially not to where\nthere's just emotional injury. That's where I\nparticularly think, although Chaplinsky would have\nsuggested in some broad language you would go that way,\nyou have not gone that way in any of the cases. And\nagain I have to reiterate, you have required immediacy\nand intent.\nWhether a fight ensues or not, I do\nunderstand that hasn't been pinned down as a\nrequirement. But in intent, it's your purpose, is to\nmix it up with somebody, not to go out and say: Nation,\nhear this little church. If you want them to stop\ndying, stop sinning.\nThat's the only purpose of this little\nchurch. A thousand feet away could not possibly be\nfighting words.\nJUSTICE BREYER: We are still worried about\nthe statements on television and on the Internet and the\nknowledge there. And I'm not -- I'm starting -- I'm\ntrying to get the same answer from you I was trying from\nyour colleague.\nBrandeis said that the right to be let alone\nis the most important, and so he must have been thinking\nthere could be a tort there for interference with\nprivacy, and the First Amendment doesn't stop State tort\nlaws in appropriate circumstances.\nMS. PHELPS: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And emotional injury,\ndeliberately inflicted, could be one. All right.\nNow -- and I think it is one. But I see that in some\ninstances that could be abused to prevent somebody from\ngetting out a public message, and, therefore, I'm\nlooking for a line.\nNow, let me suggest a couple. See what you\nthink. Maybe you can think of some others.\nYou could have a judge make the decision,\nsince the First Amendment is involved, not the jury, and\nthe judge could say whether in this instance it was\nreasonable for the defendant to think that it was\nimportant to interfere with the emotional life of that\nindividual.\nYou could say if that was so, there will\nstill be no -- there would be no punitive damages.\nThere could be ordinary damages.\nYou could remove all protection from the\ndefendant in an instance where the defendant nonetheless\nknew, actually knew, that they were going to cause an\nindividual who's private severe injury, emotional\ninjury, irrespective of their public message.\nSo what I'm doing is suggesting a number of\nthoughts of ways of trying to do what I'm trying to\naccomplish, to allow this tort to exist --\nMS. PHELPS: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- but not allow the\nexistence of it to interfere with an important public\nmessage where that is a reasonable thing to do.\nNow, maybe this is impossible, this task.\nBut I'd like your thoughts on it.\nMS. PHELPS: Thank you, Justice Breyer. And\nI'm taking that we are speaking now of the intrusion\nclaim, and I believe that I could offer you a compare\nand contrast two extremes that may help us here.\nOn the one hand, you have a body of law that\ncomes under the heading of captive audience. And you\ncan go into that body of law and read all those cases in\none sitting, so to speak, from which you would conclude\nthat it is very narrow, it is very limited, and there\nmust be some actual physical sound, sight, intrusion, if\nyou're talking about invasion of privacy.\nAt the other extreme, for a compare and\ncontrast, is what they seek in this case, what the trial\njudge gave them in this case, which is: In an\nunspecified period of time that each individual will\ncall their mourning period, no one, at any time, any\nplace, any manner, may say any word that that mourner\nsays caused me emotional distress.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Why aren't the members of\nthe family --\nMS. PHELPS: That would chill too much\nspeech.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Why aren't the members of\nthe family of the deceased a captive audience at the\nfuneral?\nMS. PHELPS: If -- if we were right outside\nthe door like the other expressers were in these\nexhibits, they might have been. Your body of law about\ncaptive audience, when you -- Hill v. Colorado, Madsen,\nSchenck -- that line of cases recently, taking the\npicketing, where they, by the way, specifically said at\nfootnote 25, this isn't about content. You've got to be\nup -- again, I will uses the colloquial term -- up in\nyour grill. The term I think the Court used was\n\"confrontational.\"\nNow, you can't be a captive audience with --\nto someone that you couldn't see when the test is --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, I thought the targeted\npicketing of a person's house is not protected by the\nFirst Amendment.\nMS. PHELPS: Focused picketing, per Frisby,\ndirectly in front of, can be regulated. And even in\nFrisby, the Court --\nJUSTICE ALITO: What's the difference\nbetween that and picketing around the site of the\nfuneral?\nMS. PHELPS: Proximity, Justice Alito.\nBecause the captive audience doctrine, as fleshed out in\nthose abortion picketing cases, what you were looking at\nwas is it practical for the person to avoid it without\nhaving to run a gauntlet?\nThat's why you said images observable, the\nonly objection you can have there is content. Get up\nand close the blinds.\nJUSTICE ALITO: So it doesn't have to do\nwith whether this is a -- what you characterize as a\npublic funeral as opposed to a private funeral? That's\nnot the distinction you are relying on any longer?\nMS. PHELPS: Not primarily. I'm primarily\nrelying upon proximity. I do think that you could have\na public event where there was not an element of\nvulnerability in the people going in. You might even\nlet them up in their grill. I don't know for sure, but\nwe don't have to worry about that.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, I'm following\nyour argument that the bulk of your speech in the epic,\nand even the bulk of your signs, involve public speech.\nWhat you have not explained to me is how\nyour speech directed at the Snyders constituted public\nspeech, or speech about a public matter, because you're\ntalking about them raising Matthew for the devil,\nteaching him to, I think, defy the creator, to divorce\nand to commit adultery.\nAt what point and how do we take personal\nattacks and permit those, as opposed to -- I fully\naccept you're entitled in some circumstances to speak\nabout any political issue you want. But what's the line\nbetween doing that and then personalizing it and\ncreating hardship to an individual?\nMS. PHELPS: Right. I believe, Justice\nSotomayor, that the line is where it was in this case:\nWhen the father used the occasion of the son's death to\nput a question out in the public airwaves repeatedly.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So if we disagree that\nthat made him a public figure, if we view him as a\nprivate figure, is that enough to defeat your argument?\nMS. PHELPS: No, Justice Sotomayor.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. So assume\nthat he's a private -- that the Matthews are private\nfigures, and you did this.\nMS. PHELPS: Right. I think --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So explain to me how you\nare protected by the First Amendment.\nMS. PHELPS: If, without regard to what\nlabel is put on a person who steps into the public\ndiscussion --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You want to change my\nassumption.\nMS. PHELPS: Okay.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: We assume that he' a\nprivate figure. You have now made a public statement\nand directed personal comments at an individual who is a\nprivate figure. Is that actionable?\nMS. PHELPS: Well, I don't know, Justice\nSotomayor. I don't know that I can give you a\ndefinitive answer as you've framed it. What I can tell\nyou is that I think the Court would have great\ndifficulty making a rule of law that whether you call\nyourself private, public, limited, whatever, you -- not\nthe person you're mad at over their words -- but you\nstep into the public discussion and make some public\nstatements, and then somebody wants to answer you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, so that --\nwhat -- what if -- did Mr. Snyder, the father, become a\npublic figure simply because his son was killed in Iraq?\nMS. PHELPS: No, Mr. Chief Justice. I\ndon't --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay. So if didn't\ntake out --\nMS. PHELPS: I don't allege that here.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If he didn't take\nout the usual obituary notice, then this case should\ncome out the other way?\nMS. PHELPS: It's not the obituary notice,\nMr. Chief Justice, he went far beyond that.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: All right. Well,\nlet's just say he does nothing. He does nothing other\nthan bury his son.\nMS. PHELPS: Right.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: He is then not a\npublic figure?\nMS. PHELPS: If he does nothing, we don't\npicket him. And I don't know for sure --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's because\nif he does nothing and it's not publicized, you don't\nget the maximum publicity that your clients are looking\nfor. My question is, if he simply buries his son, is he\na public figure open to this protest or -- or not?\nMS. PHELPS: I don't know, in the context of\na war, if I can give a definitive answer to that. It\nwas not an issue of seeking maximum publicity; it was an\nissue of using an existing public platform to bring a\nviewpoint that was not being articulated. For 2 years\nthis church watched --\nJUSTICE ALITO: And what if a parent is\ncalled after the -- he puts in the obituary information\nand called by the local newspaper and asked for a\ncomment, and he says or she says, I'm proud of my son\nbecause he died in the service of our country? Does\nthat -- is he stepping into a public debate by doing\nthat?\nMS. PHELPS: How -- by however you call it,\nJustice Alito, a church or anybody has the right to\nanswer that public comment; that is our position.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Ms.\nPhelps.\nMS. PHELPS: Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Summers, you\nhave 4 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF SEAN E. SUMMERS\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. SUMMERS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Summers, could I ask you\nto go back to an answer that you gave to one of my\ncolleagues when you were last up there? You said that a\n-- a more standard antiwar demonstration -- \"get out of\nIraq,\" \"war is immoral\" at this funeral, same distance,\nsame-sized signs -- that a more standard antiwar\ndemonstration would be protected by the First Amendment\nfrom an intentional infliction of emotional distress\nsuit.\nAnd I'm wondering why that is. If you think\nthat what is -- what causes the lack of protection here\nis the kind of glomming on to a private funeral, the\nexploitation of a private person's grief, the -- the\nappearance for no other reason than to gain publicity at\na private event -- if that's the problem, why doesn't it\nalso apply to a standard, you know, \"get out of Iraq,\"\n\"war is wrong\" kind of demonstration?\nMR. SUMMERS: Justice Kagan, I say that is\na -- one, it's a much closer call, and, two, I would\nlook to the facts of the case to see if the funeral\nitself was disrupted.\nBut that isn't the facts of our case. The\nfacts of our case was, one, that it was disrupted, and,\ntwo, that it's personal, targeted assaults on Mr.\nSnyder.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Well, suppose it's not\ndisrupted and suppose -- and I know that this is -- that\nyou contest these facts -- that yours wasn't disrupted,\nthat they stopped when you started, that they were a\nsufficient number of feet away from the funeral and so\nforth.\nSo we're just talking the fact that there\nare people who have -- who are appropriating and taking\nadvantage of a private funeral in order to express their\nviews, and they are in compliance with all the\ncontent-neutral rules.\nMR. SUMMERS: I'd say that's a much closer\ncall and not the --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: But why is it a closer call?\nMR. SUMMERS: It's a closer call because\nit's not the personal, targeted nature of the attack on\nthe Snyder family that we have in this case.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: So does that mean that now\nwe have to start reading each sign and saying \"war is\nwrong\" falls on one side of the line, but \"you are a war\ncriminal\" falls on another side of the line? Is that\nwhat we would have to do?\nMR. SUMMERS: I think that, generally\nspeaking, yes, Justice Kagan. The court -- the district\ncourt would have to look at the signs, as the district\ncourt did in this case, and determine which one he\nbelieved were directed at the family and which ones were\nnot. There was a comment earlier that all the signs\nwere presented. Well, all the signs were presented by\nthe Respondents, not by Mr. Snyder. So we --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I guess that that kind of a\ncall is always necessary under -- under the tort that\nyou're -- that you're relying upon. The conduct has to\nbe outrageous, right?\nMR. SUMMERS: Correct. And that --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That always requires that\nkind of a call, unless the tort is unconstitutional, as\napplied to all -- all harm inflicted by words.\nMR. SUMMERS: Correct, Justice Scalia, the\nelement of intentional infliction of emotional distress\nrequires outrageousness.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Well, that's true, but I was\nassuming a situation in which the -- a jury found that\nthe \"war is wrong\" -- that a jury did find that\noutrageous, and the question was: Were we going to\nreverse the jury verdict because we -- the First\nAmendment prohibited it?\nMR. SUMMERS: Again, I believe that's a\ncloser call, and I would say yes, if it's a general\nstatement, does not disrupt the funeral, does not target\nthe family. I'd say that it's one -- a much closer\ncall, and, yes, it's more likely that the Constitution\nis going to prevent that claim from going forward.\nThe -- I see that I'm out of time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Summers.\n"
